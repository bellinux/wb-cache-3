5|$|The next {{interchange}} for the M-5 freeway {{connects to}} Grand River Avenue and 10 Mile Road. This {{section of the}} freeway bypasses residential areas of Farmington Hills. Further east, M-5 crosses into Farmington where it bypasses the downtown area of the suburb. Past 9Mile Road, the freeway ends at the intersection with Grand River Avenue, and M-5 follows Grand River southeasterly as a boulevard, a type of divided street. Traffic that wishes to make left turns <b>must</b> <b>use</b> a Michigan left maneuver along {{this section of the}} highway. Additionally, traffic that needs to change sides of the street <b>must</b> <b>use</b> crossovers in the median to perform a U-turn. Once again running through suburban Farmington Hills, the trunkline passes Botsford Hospital before intersecting 8Mile Road. This intersection marks the place where M-5 crosses into Wayne County, and the western terminus of the M-102 designation on 8Mile Road. Grand River Avenue runs through the northern section of Redford Township in Wayne County and crosses into Detroit at the intersection with 7Mile Road and 5Points Street.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the game, {{the player}} can procure various weapons, {{including}} melee weapons, pistols, shotguns, and alien weapons. Non-melee weapons degrade with use and will break {{if they are}} not regularly repaired with maintenance tools. There are a variety of ammunition types, each of which is most damaging to a specific enemy. For example, organic enemies are vulnerable to anti-personnel rounds, while mechanical foes are weak against armor-piercing rounds. Similarly, energy weapons cause the most damage against robots and cyborgs, and the annelid-made exotic weaponry is particularly harmful to organic targets. Because ammunition is scarce, to be effective the player <b>must</b> <b>use</b> it sparingly and carefully search rooms for supplies.|$|E

5|$|Although the prequel/sequel to Superstar Saga, the game's plot is {{completely}} unrelated {{to that of}} its predecessor with more emphasis on the time-traveling theme, which involves the protagonists traveling in between {{the past and present}} of the Mushroom Kingdom. The adventure follows Mario, Baby Mario, Luigi, and Baby Luigi while they search for Princess Peach, who has been abducted by an alien species only known as the Shroobs. The gameplay centers on the co-operation between the quartet, who <b>must</b> <b>use</b> their specific qualities and skills to solve puzzles to progress through and features multiple role-playing game elements, but with a turn-based battle system focused on timing accuracy. The game is considerably darker in tone than its predecessor, especially in its plot and themes.|$|E
5|$|Ambulances {{may also}} carry an emblem (either {{as part of}} the passive warning {{markings}} or not), such as a Red Cross, Red Crescent or Red Crystal (collective known as the Protective Symbols). These are symbols laid down by the Geneva Convention, and all countries signatory to it agree to restrict their use to either (1) Military Ambulances or (2) the national Red Cross or Red Crescent society. Use by any other person, organization or agency is in breach of international law. The protective symbols are designed to indicate to all people (especially combatants in the case of war) that the vehicle is neutral and is not to be fired upon, hence giving protection to the medics and their casualties, although this has not always been adhered to. In Israel, Magen David Adom, the Red Cross member organization use a red Star of David, but this does not have recognition beyond Israeli borders, where they <b>must</b> <b>use</b> the Red Crystal.|$|E
5|$|Candidates {{may use the}} Internet {{to publish}} {{election}} advertising, including posting content on electronic media applications (such as digital banners, instant messaging software, mobile applications, RSS feed readers and widgets), social networking services and other websites, and sending e-mails. SMS and MMS messages can also be sent. Candidates must notify the returning officer of each platform on the Internet {{that is used to}} publish election advertising within 12 hours after the start of the campaign period (that is, the time when the place of nomination closes on nomination day) and thereafter each time before a platform is used for such publication. Candidate and their election agents <b>must</b> <b>use</b> their best efforts to ensure that all Internet election advertising is published in accordance with the law; in other words, the returning officer must be satisfied that all reasonable steps in the circumstances were taken. Contravening any regulations relating to election advertising on the Internet is a criminal offence punishable by a fine of up to $1,000, jail of up to 12 months, or both.|$|E

5|$|Cannon Fodder 2 is a military-themed action {{game with}} {{strategy}} and shoot 'em up elements. The player controls a small squad {{of up to}} four soldiers. These soldiers are armed with machine guns which kill enemy infantry with a single round. The player's troops are similarly fragile, and while they possess superior fire-power at the game's outset the enemy infantry becomes more powerful as the game progresses. As well as foot soldiers, the antagonists include vehicles and missile-armed turrets. The player must also destroy buildings which spawn enemy soldiers. For these targets, which are invulnerable to machine gun fire, the player <b>must</b> <b>use</b> secondary, explosive weaponry: grenades and rockets. Ammunition for these weapons is limited and the player must find supply crates to replenish his troops. Wasting these weapons can potentially result in the player not having enough to fulfil the mission objectives. The player can opt to shoot crates – destroying enemy troops and buildings in the ensuing explosion – at less risk to his soldiers than retrieving them, but again at {{a greater risk of}} depleting ammunition.|$|E
5|$|During StarCraft: Ghosts gameplay, the player's {{character}} Nova <b>must</b> <b>use</b> stealth {{and darkness}} to reach objectives and remain undetected. Nova has a cloaking device {{that allows for}} temporary concealment, but certain hostile non-player characters can overcome this with special devices and abilities. Nova is also equipped with thermal imaging goggles and a special EMP device for disabling electronic devices and vehicles. In addition to the focus on stealth elements, StarCraft: Ghost includes a complex combat system. Blizzard planned to include a small arsenal of weaponry with assault and sniper rifles, grenades, shotguns, and flamethrowers. Nova can engage in hand-to-hand combat and uses these skills to eliminate enemy threats quietly. If alerted, enemy characters will hunt for the player, set up traps, and fire blindly to nullify Nova's cloaking device.|$|E
5|$|In Flint Township, M-21 follows Corunna Road {{and meets}} I-75/US23 at exit118. The road crosses a former branch {{line of the}} Canadian National Railway (converted into a bicycle trail) east of the interchange. Corunna Road angles to the {{northeast}} near Bradley Avenue and terminates at Court Street. The trunkline turns east and follows Court over {{a tributary of the}} Flint River near Aldrich Park. Northeast of the stream, M-21 splits along a one-way pairing of Court and 5th streets. Eastbound traffic follows 5th Street past the city and county buildings in the area. The highway passes over I-475 and terminates at the east frontage road. Traffic connecting between M-21 and I-475 <b>must</b> <b>use</b> the frontage roads to make the connection.|$|E
