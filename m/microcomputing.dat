25|$|Colossal Cave Adventure set {{concepts}} and gameplay approaches {{that would become}} staples of text adventures and interactive fiction. Following its release on ARPANET, numerous variations of Colossal Cave Adventure appeared throughout the late 1970s and early 1980s, {{with some of these}} later versions being re-christened Colossal Adventure or Colossal Caves. These variations were enabled by the increase in <b>microcomputing</b> that allowed programmers to work on home computers rather than mainframe systems. The genre gained commercial success with titles designed for home computers. Scott Adams launched Adventure International to publish text adventures including an adaptation of Colossal Cave Adventure, while a number of MIT students formed Infocom to bring their game Zork from mainframe to home computers and was a commercial success.|$|E
25|$|Although one of {{the first}} {{peripherals}} for the IBM PC was a SoftCard-like expansion card that let it run 8-bit CP/M software, CP/M rapidly lost market share as the <b>microcomputing</b> market moved to the IBM-compatible platform, and it never regained its former popularity. Byte magazine, at the time {{one of the}} leading industry magazines for microcomputers, essentially ceased covering CP/M products within a few years of the introduction of the IBM PC. For example, in 1983 there were still a few advertisements for S100 boards and articles on CP/M software, but by 1987 these were no longer found in the magazine. InfoWorld described the unsuccessful efforts at introducing CP/M based home computers in 1983 and in 1986 stated that Kaypro had stopped production of their 8-bit CP/M-based models to concentrate on sales of MS-DOS compatible systems, long after most other vendors had ceased production of new equipment and software for CP/M.|$|E

2500|$|Early {{reviews of}} Temple of Apshai praised the game's {{graphics}} and unusual complexity, while criticizing long loading times and slow screen build-up for the dungeon graphics. Compute! stated that Temple of Apshai for the PET [...] "is {{for anyone who}} is tired of simple 'video games' ... is quite an experience". It advised readers {{to be aware that}} [...] "this is a serious game. Be prepared to THINK". Jerry Pournelle in BYTE called it [...] "an excellent real-time dungeon game", and later reported that his sons had [...] "nearly worn out the Dungeons of Apshai". Kilobaud <b>Microcomputing</b> criticized the long load times, but liked the game's graphics and [...] "excellent" [...] documentation. PC Magazine stated that the IBM PC version did not fully exploit the computer's graphics capability, but that players [...] "will find excitement and entertainment ... it's certainly worth the silver to grab this game for the PC". The magazine was also favorable towards Upper Reaches of Apshai, which it called [...] "better than Temple of Apshai in some ways". Popular Science called Temple of Apshai [...] "a good example of a graphic adventure game", but also stated that in it and other games like it [...] "the play seems to drag" [...] because [...] "it takes time to draw the pictures". The Addison-Wesley Book of Atari Software 1984 gave Temple of Apshai an overall B rating, concluding that it was [...] "an excellent game, one that's very involving", and gave the same grade to Hellfire Warrior and Curse of Ra.|$|E

40|$|Computed Tomography and <b>Microcomputed</b> Tomography are X-ray based technologies. They {{were tested}} in this thesis as {{potential}} tools for the optimization of the processing of dry-cured meat products. On one hand, several prediction models and Computed Tomography analytical tools were developed for the non-destructive analysis of water activity, salt content and water content distribution within dry-cured hams during processing and were successfully applied to three case studies. On the other hand, <b>Microcomputed</b> Tomography were used to characterize, evaluate and correlate {{the changes in the}} microstructure with the texture of non-acid pork lean fermented sausages. Some <b>Microcomputed</b> Tomography parameters could be correlated with the instrumental texture, although the <b>Microcomputed</b> Tomography was not accurate enough to distinguish between lean and fat when these constituents were emulsified. In conclusion, Computed Tomography and <b>Microcomputed</b> Tomography can be considered as suitable technologies for the non-destructive characterization and for the optimization of dry-cured meat processing.

30|$|In this paper, we {{developed}} a workflow for the characterisation of heterogeneity of unconventional shale rock samples. The degree of heterogeneity was evaluated using 1 <b>microcomputed</b> tomography (micro-CT) image from Eagle Ford parallel. The sample was divided into 96 for descriptive statistical analysis. Meanwhile, REV for porosity was evaluated using a set of two <b>microcomputed</b> tomography (micro-CT) images from Eagle Ford parallel and perpendicular. Finally, corner point reference techniques where each {{of the sample was}} cropped into 7 were used to achieve REV for porosity. The images were processed, digitised, thresholded, segmented and each feature captured using marching cube algorithm. This allows the segmentation of each sample into four distinct entities, consisting of pores, organic matter, shale grains and minerals.|$|R

Healing was assessed by <b>microcomputed</b> tomography and histomorphometry. Results: The delayed implants (placed 14 days after osteotomy) showed better osseointegration than the immediately placed implants.

Under different levels of compressive strain, the material was scanned using X-ray <b>microcomputed</b> tomography to obtain three-dimensional (3 D) images of its internal microstructure. Experiments with the same parameters were carried out to investigate repeatability. The microscopic observations have suggested that damage nucleation occurs at the weakest microspheres. When applied strain increases, shear collapse bands (SCBs) develop local to the fragmented microspheres due to stress concentration and bending deformation around SCBs occurs. After significant strain, {{the thickness of the}} SCBs increases owing to the accumulation of the broken microspheres.
