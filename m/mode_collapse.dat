40|$|Generative {{adversarial}} networks (GANs) are innovative {{techniques for}} learning generative models of complex data distributions from samples. Despite remarkable recent improvements in generating realistic images, {{one of their}} major shortcomings {{is the fact that}} in practice, they tend to produce samples with little diversity, even when trained on diverse datasets. This phenomenon, known as <b>mode</b> <b>collapse,</b> has been the main focus of several recent advances in GANs. Yet there is little understanding of why <b>mode</b> <b>collapse</b> happens and why existing approaches are able to mitigate <b>mode</b> <b>collapse.</b> We propose a principled approach to handling <b>mode</b> <b>collapse,</b> which we call packing. The main idea is to modify the discriminator to make decisions based on multiple samples from the same class, either real or artificially generated. We borrow analysis tools from binary hypothesis testing [...] -in particular the seminal result of Blackwell [Bla 53] [...] -to prove a fundamental connection between packing and <b>mode</b> <b>collapse.</b> We show that packing naturally penalizes generators with <b>mode</b> <b>collapse,</b> thereby favoring generator distributions with less <b>mode</b> <b>collapse</b> during the training process. Numerical experiments on benchmark datasets suggests that packing provides significant improvements in practice as well. Comment: 40 pages, 19 figure...|$|E
40|$|We propose {{studying}} GAN training dynamics as regret minimization, {{which is}} in contrast to the popular view that there is consistent minimization of a divergence between real and generated distributions. We analyze the convergence of GAN training from this new point of view to understand why <b>mode</b> <b>collapse</b> happens. We hypothesize the existence of undesirable local equilibria in this non-convex game to be responsible for <b>mode</b> <b>collapse.</b> We observe that these local equilibria often exhibit sharp gradients of the discriminator function around some real data points. We demonstrate that these degenerate local equilibria can be avoided with a gradient penalty scheme called DRAGAN. We show that DRAGAN enables faster training, achieves improved stability with fewer mode collapses, and leads to generator networks with better modeling performance across a variety of architectures and objective functions.

30|$|A {{commonly}} faced {{problem when}} training GANs {{is a phenomenon}} called <b>mode</b> <b>collapse</b> (Tolstikhin et al. 2017; Metz et al. 2016; Salimans et al. 2016), where the network focuses on {{a subset of the}} modes of the underlying data distribution. In these regions where the generator is fooling the discriminator well, the gradient signal becomes weak and the discriminator might be unable to properly lead the generator to the right target distribution. the generator might converge to them, leaving out parts of regions of the target distribution. Wasserstein- 1 loss, has some empirical evidence to prevent <b>mode</b> <b>collapse</b> but still suffers from it.|$|E
40|$|Particularly {{intriguing}} {{problem in}} structural engineering practice is eccentric patch loading-thin-walled steel I-girder loaded over flange by local load having a certain eccentricity regarding the web plane. Depending on girder geometry and load eccentricity, eccentrically patch loaded girders might have <b>collapse</b> <b>mode</b> and <b>collapse</b> load {{the same as}} centrically loaded girders (i. e. {{as if there is}} no eccentricity) or completely different <b>collapse</b> <b>mode</b> than in case of centric load, with reduced collapse load due to load eccentricity. It is essential to know <b>collapse</b> <b>mode</b> of eccentrically loaded girder in order to determine its collapse load. Patch loading research projects at the University of Montenegro, among extensive experimental research and different theoretical research ways, included application of artificial neural networks (ANN) for solving simultaneous problems of determination of <b>collapse</b> <b>mode</b> and <b>collapse</b> load in eccentrically locally loaded steel I-girders. Presented example of ANN modelling proves possibility of successful and useful application of this method in engineering practice. Not only that such models might be used to forecast <b>collapse</b> <b>mode</b> of particular girders. They might also help in establishing general criteria for <b>collapse</b> <b>mode</b> identification in eccentrically patch loaded girders...|$|R

Compress- expand member is a compact, multiple-combined cylinders, to be {{proposed}} as energy absorbers. Previous studies on the compress- expand member have clarified its energy absorption efficiency, proposed an approximate equation to describe its deformation characteristics and also highlighted the improvement that it has brought. However, for the member to be practical, the actual range of geometrical dimension that it can maintain its applicability must be investigated.

30|$|In {{learning}} the cosmic web structures, {{which are more}} feature-rich than projected convergence maps, we encountered and addressed several important challenges. The first was to handle data with very large dynamic range of the data; the density in the images created from slices of N-body simulations span several orders of magnitude. Secondly, we explored how <b>mode</b> <b>collapse,</b> a feature of GANs causing the model to focuses on a single local minimum, affects the quality of results (Tolstikhin et al. 2017; Metz et al. 2016; Salimans et al. 2016). As <b>mode</b> <b>collapse</b> is expected {{to depend on the}} degree of homogeneity between samples, we tested the performance of GANs for both large and small cosmological volumes, of size 500 and 100 Mpc; the matter density distributions in large boxes are considerably more homogeneous than in small boxes.|$|E

40|$|Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have {{recently}} been proposed as a promising avenue towards learning generative models with deep neural networks. While GANs have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance on multiple vision tasks, their learning dynamics are not yet well understood, both in theory and in practice. To address this issue, we take a first step towards a rigorous study of GAN dynamics. We propose a simple model that exhibits several of the common problematic convergence behaviors (e. g., vanishing gradient, <b>mode</b> <b>collapse,</b> diverging or oscillatory behavior) and still allows us to establish the first convergence bounds for parametric GAN dynamics. We find an interesting dichotomy: a GAN with an optimal discriminator provably converges, while a first order approximation of the discriminator leads to unstable GAN dynamics and <b>mode</b> <b>collapse.</b> Our model and analysis point to a specific challenge in practical GAN training that we call discriminator collapse...|$|E

The elastic-plastic and overtaking shocks are observed at different shock strengths. The simulated Hugoniot states can be described with a modified, power-law P−α (pressure–porosity) model, and agree with shock experiments on Cu powders, {{as well as the}} compacted Hugoniot predicted with the Grüneisen equation of state. Shock-induced melting shows no clear signs of bulk premelting or superheating. Voids collapse via plastic flow nucleated from voids, and the exact processes are shock strength dependent.

40|$|The paper {{suggests}} {{the introduction of}} patterns {{to the surface of}} conventional thin-walled square tubes to improve the energy absorption capacity under axial compressive loads. A quasi-static axial crushing analysis has been conducted numerically by the nonlinear explicit finite element code LS-DYNA. Two types of patterns constructed using the basic pyramid elements were introduced. Type A pattern was aimed at triggering the extensional mode for relatively thin square tubes whereas type B pattern was intended to develop new <b>collapse</b> <b>mode</b> capable of absorbing more energy during collapse. A total of 30 tubes with a length of 120 mm, thickness 1. 2 mm and widths of 40 or 60 mm were simulated. Numerical results showed that all tubes with type A patterns developed the extensional <b>collapse</b> <b>mode</b> instead of the symmetric <b>collapse</b> <b>mode</b> and absorbed about 15 - 32. 5 % more energy than conventional thin-walled square tubes with a mass increase less than 5 %. Meanwhile, a new <b>collapse</b> <b>mode</b> named octagonal <b>collapse</b> <b>mode</b> was observed for tubes with type B pattern and the energy absorption of tubes developing this mode increased by 54 - 93 % compared with the conventional tube. The influence of various configurations of the patterns on the deformation and energy absorption of the tubes was also discussed.

Various experimental results show that generators trained with our distributional adversaries are much more stable and are remarkably less prone to <b>mode</b> <b>collapse</b> than traditional models trained with pointwise prediction discriminators.

40|$|As an {{effective}} way of metric learning, triplet loss has been widely used in many deep learning tasks, including face recognition and person-ReID, leading to many states of the arts. The main innovation of triplet loss is using feature map to replace softmax in the classification task. Inspired by this concept, we propose here a new adversarial modeling method by substituting the classification loss of discriminator with triplet loss. Theoretical proof based on IPM (Integral probability metric) demonstrates that such setting will help the generator converge to the given distribution theoretically under some conditions. Moreover, since triplet loss requires the generator to maximize distance within a class, we justify tripletGAN {{is also helpful to}} prevent <b>mode</b> <b>collapse</b> through both theory and experiment...|$|E
40|$|We {{propose a}} new {{approach}} to train the Generative Adversarial Nets (GANs) with a mixture of generators to overcome the mode collapsing problem. The main intuition is to employ multiple generators, instead of using a single one as in the original GAN. The idea is simple, yet proven to be extremely effective at covering diverse data modes, easily overcoming the <b>mode</b> <b>collapse</b> and delivering state-of-the-art results. A minimax formulation is able to establish among a classifier, a discriminator, and a set of generators in a similar spirit with GAN. Generators create samples that are intended to come from the same distribution as the training data, whilst the discriminator determines whether samples are true data or generated by generators, and the classifier specifies which generator a sample comes from. The distinguishing feature is that internal samples are created from multiple generators, and then one of them will be randomly selected as final output similar to the mechanism of a probabilistic mixture model. We term our method Mixture GAN (MGAN). We develop theoretical analysis to prove that, at the equilibrium, the Jensen-Shannon divergence (JSD) between the mixture of generators' distributions and the empirical data distribution is minimal, whilst the JSD among generators' distributions is maximal, hence effectively avoiding the <b>mode</b> <b>collapse.</b> By utilizing parameter sharing, our proposed model adds minimal computational cost to the standard GAN, and thus can also efficiently scale to large-scale datasets. We conduct extensive experiments on synthetic 2 D data and natural image databases (CIFAR- 10, STL- 10 and ImageNet) to demonstrate the superior performance of our MGAN in achieving state-of-the-art Inception scores over latest baselines, generating diverse and appealing recognizable objects at different resolutions, and specializing in capturing different types of objects by generators...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: By {{changing}} the end constraints, the behaviour of mild steel and aluminium alloy tubes of relatively low D/t ratio, subjected to an axial crushing load, is studied. Many combinations of end constraints were produced by radially constraining {{one or both}} ends of the loaded tube outwards, inwards or in both directions. Partially constrained mild steel and aluminium tubes are found to collapse into either a pure concertina mode or a pure diamond mode, depending on the ratio D/t and the material characteristics. Mixed concertina ± diamond modes would generally result by radially constraining the tube at both ends. Constraining the tube radially outwards at one end does not signi ® cantly aVect the load ± displacement characteristics and the <b>mode</b> of <b>collapse.</b> However, con-straining the tube radially inwards produces a diVerent mode than that observed under outward, inward or combined outward/inward constraint. New <b>modes</b> of <b>collapse</b> have been observed under diVerent combinations of outward and inward constraints at both ends. Fully constraining the tubes in the radial direction results in the removal of the initial overshoot in the load ± displacement curve, which is responsible for the overestimation of the mean crushing load and the energy absorption capacity of tubular elements. The <b>mode</b> of <b>collapse</b> and the energy absorbed could be controlled with the proper choice of the end constraints...|$|R
