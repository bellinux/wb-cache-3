40|$|The {{power train}} {{performance}} of load leveled electric vehicles {{can be compared}} with that of nonload leveled systems by use of a simple mathematical model. This method of measurement involves a number of parameters including the degree of load leveling and regeneration, the flywheel mechanical to electrical energy fraction, and efficiencies of the <b>motor,</b> <b>generator,</b> <b>flywheel,</b> and transmission. Basic efficiency terms are defined and representative comparisons of a variety of systems are presented. Results of the study indicate that mechanical transfer of energy {{into and out of the}} flywheel is more advantageous than electrical transfer. An optimum degree of load leveling may be achieved in terms of the driving cycle, battery characteristics, mode of mechanization, and the efficiency of the components. For state of the art mechanically coupled flyheel systems, load leveling losses can be held to a reasonable 10 %; electrically coupled systems can have losses that are up to six times larger. Propulsion system efficiencies for mechanically coupled flywheel systems are predicted to be approximately the 60 % achieved on conventional nonload leveled systems...|$|R

40|$|For ages {{flywheels}} {{have been}} used to achieve smooth operation of machines. The early models where purely mechanical consisting of only a stone wheel attached to an axle. Nowadays flywheels are complex constructions where energy is stored mechanically and transferred to and from the flywheel by an integrated motor/generator. The stone wheel {{has been replaced by a}} steel or composite rotor and magnetic bearings have been introduced. Today flywheels are used as supplementary UPS storage at several industries world over. Future applications span a wide range including electric vehicles, intermediate storage for renewable energy generation and direct grid applications from power quality issues to offering an alternative to strengthening transmission. One of the key issues for viable flywheel construction is a high overall efficiency, hence a reduction of the total losses. By increasing the voltage, current losses are decreased and otherwise necessary transformer steps become redundant. So far flywheels over 10 Â kV have not been constructed, mainly due to isolation problems associated with high voltage, but also because of limitations in the power electronics. Recent progress in semi-conductor technology enables faster switching and lower costs. The predominant part of prior studies have been directed towards optimising mechanical issues whereas the electro technical part now seem to show great potential for improvement. An overview of flywheel technology and previous projects are presented and moreover a 200 Â kW flywheel using high voltage technology is simulated.

50|$|Because the {{flywheels}} are {{a mechanical}} power source, {{it is not}} necessary to use an electric <b>motor</b> or <b>generator</b> as an intermediary between it and a diesel engine designed to provide emergency power. By using a transmission gearbox, the rotational inertia of the flywheel can be used to directly start up a diesel engine, and once running, the diesel engine can be used to directly spin the flywheel. Multiple flywheels can likewise be connected in parallel through mechanical countershafts, without the need for separate <b>motors</b> and <b>generators</b> for each <b>flywheel.</b>|$|R

40|$|Brookhaven {{operates}} a 9 MW <b>motor</b> <b>generator,</b> made by Siemens, {{as part of}} the main magnet power supply of the Alternating Gradient Synchrotron (AGS) accelerator. A cycloconverter power supply system is utilized to ensure that during pulsing the main magnets of the AGS up to 50 MW peak power, the input power of the <b>motor</b> <b>generator</b> remains constant. There is also another <b>motor</b> <b>generator</b> (MG set) at Brookkhaven, a 40 year old system manufactured by Westinghouse. This MG set could be pulsed up to 34 MW peak power while the input average power should not exceed. 4. 1 MW. A project is underway to upgrade this MG system and it’s controls, so it {{could be used as a}} spare while doing maintenance on the Siemens MG and thus not interrupting the RHIC physics program. The purpose of this paper is to show that it is possible to pulse the AGS magnets using the Westinghouse MG system without utilizing a cycloconverter power supply, and still be able to maintain the input power to the <b>motor</b> <b>generator</b> constant. Calculations will be provided to show that we can pulse the position of the liquid rheostat in the motor rotor circuit to support the above, while taking out the power necessary to pulse the AGS magnets. This solution is being implemented due to budget constraints and overall simplicity. The hydraulic system to accomplish this task will also be described...|$|R
