5000|$|The organic {{standards}} in Germany cover plant production, animal husbandry, aquaculture, wine, and third country imports. Key points for each standard {{area will be}} addressed. Plant production requires preservation of soil fertility and <b>multiannual</b> <b>crop</b> rotations. Animal husbandry forbids tethering and promotes animal’s natural immunological defense. Aquaculture protects marine animals and seaweed in that it aims to minimize the productions’ negative impact on aquatic environments. Wine regulations ban the use of labels stating [...] "wine from organic production grapes" [...] and only allows organic labels to be used if all organic products were used. Third country imports follow equivalence standards for production and inspection qualifications.|$|E
40|$|What are the {{performances}} of different stockless organic crops systems? And more specifically, are there rotations more efficient than other for economic, technical and / or environmental criteria? This work aims to present the method of co-construction of simulated cases for an evaluation of economic, environmental and technical performances, at rotation and production system scale. Fifteen «test cases» have been defined in the partner regions of CASDAR projects ROTAB and ProtéAB and evaluated {{with a set of}} quantitative and non-aggregated indicators (tool Systerre ®). The results provided many references at different scales. In the current context, profitability was ensured for all cases studied, but the production environment had a major impact on the overall performance. Long rotations with <b>multiannual</b> <b>crop</b> rotation (often alfalfa), sometimes less economically efficient, had strong advantages regarding agricultural sustainability. They also seemed to be less sensitive to changes in economic conditions and provided that the crop harvest was performed by a company, (it requires less work time). The typical cases are upgradeable tools to be adapted to different simulations or prospective studies...|$|E
5000|$|Cultivated cottons are {{perennial}} shrubs {{most often}} grown as annuals. Plants are 1-2 m high in modern cropping systems, sometimes higher in traditional, <b>multiannual</b> <b>cropping</b> systems, now largely disappearing. The leaves are broad and lobed, with {{three to five}} (or rarely seven) lobes. The seeds are contained in a capsule called a [...] "boll", each seed surrounded by fibres of two types. These fibres are the more commercially interesting part of the plant and they are separated from the seed by a process called ginning. At the first ginning, the longer fibres, called staples, are removed and these are twisted together to form yarn for making thread and weaving into high quality textiles. At the second ginning, the shorter fibres, called [...] "linters", are removed, and these are woven into lower quality textiles (which include the eponymous Lint). Commercial species of cotton plant are G. hirsutum (>90% of world production), G. barbadense (3-4%), G. arboreum and G. herbaceum (together, 2%). Many varieties of cotton have been developed by selective breeding and hybridization of these species. Experiments are ongoing to cross-breed various desirable traits of wild cotton species into the principal commercial species, such as resistance to insects and diseases, and drought tolerance. Cotton fibres occur naturally in colours of white, brown, green, and some mixing of these.|$|R
40|$|<b>Multiannual</b> <b>crops</b> such as {{fruit tree}} crops are {{affected}} by soil sickness or yield decline. "Replant disease" is the main biological component of this problem due to the eco-functional intensification of growing areas specialising in fruit production. The severity of this etiology is mediated by plant vigour, physiological state of plants and a-biotic factors, therefore its occurrence is actually an indicator for fruit growers of the degraded status of soil’s biological processes on his crops. The project aims to develop innovative management options able to increase soil biological functioning, focusing the attention on soil suppressiveness: the natural ability of soil to control soil-borne pathogenic agents of replant disease. The activities are planned on two target crops: citrus and apple, representing two main agro-environments of Europe. Cover crops taken from local germoplasm collections or from the natural vegetative covers and recycled high quality organic materials are the natural resources upon which the project focuses, {{in order to develop}} innovative cropping practices which will enable soil biodiversity preservation and exploit its biological features. The early evaluation of plant response and the use of advanced methodologies to evaluate microbial response toward the inputs are the strategies used to identify natural resources and techniques capable of increasing microbial biomass and diversity and selectively affecting beneficial and pathogenic microbial populations. The resulting innovative cropping practices are also easily transferred to other crops such as stone fruits and strawberries. Each country’s activities are planned in close cooperation with regional agricultural research centres working on organic farming and laboratories with specific expertise. The dissemination plan of the BIO-INCROP project should increase grower’s awareness of soil biodiversity as a resource for developing new technologies. ...|$|R
