5|$|During oral {{argument}} before the Court, Scalia asked <b>more</b> <b>questions</b> and made more comments {{than any other}} justice—and a 2005 study found that he provoked laughter more often {{than any of his}} colleagues did. His goal during {{oral argument}}s was to get across his position to the other justices.|$|E
5|$|Gabriel Logan and {{his partner}} Lian Xing {{investigate}} a series of biological outbreaks triggered by international terrorist Erich Rhoemer. When fellow agent Ellis loses contact during a mission in Costa Rica, the top-secret Agency dispatches Gabe and Lian to find him. They discover Ellis is dead, and Rhoemer's suspected drug operation is a cover for the viral operation. Another outbreak in Nepal leads to <b>more</b> <b>questions</b> when an infected person who should have died somehow survived.|$|E
5|$|After the ten minutes, {{the first}} team comes on-stage, while the second team is placed in a sound-proof booth. The host then asks the team {{questions}} from the announced category. Each question is given, in rotation, to one player, who cannot confer with teammates. Both teams play {{the same set of}} questions. Each team has a total of 60 seconds to answer as many questions as possible, and the team that answers <b>more</b> <b>questions</b> correctly wins $20,000 for their charity; the runners-up win $5,000 for their charity. Teams that win this round advance to a semi-final game; the winners of that episode advance to the season finale, where the team that wins this round wins $100,000 for their charity as well as all winnings from previous episodes.|$|E
60|$|And {{indeed there}} was no <b>more</b> <b>question</b> of my mysterious {{vocation}} between us. There was to be no <b>more</b> <b>question</b> of it at all, no where or with any one. We began the descent of the Furca Pass conversing merrily.|$|R
5000|$|In addition, the Open Data Barometer adds two <b>more</b> <b>question</b> {{for their}} {{evaluation}} of the open data portal, and they are: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Only one <b>more</b> <b>question,</b> Dr. Mortimer. You {{say that}} before Sir Charles Baskerville's death several people saw this {{apparition}} upon the moor?" ...|$|R
5|$|Citizen Kane eschews the {{traditional}} linear, chronological narrative, and tells Kane's story entirely in flashback using {{different points of}} view, many of them from Kane's aged and forgetful associates, the cinematic equivalent of the unreliable narrator in literature. Welles also dispenses {{with the idea of}} a single storyteller and uses multiple narrators to recount Kane's life. The use of multiple narrators was unheard of in Hollywood films. Each narrator recounts a different part of Kane's life, with each story partly overlapping. The film depicts Kane as an enigma, a complicated man who, in the end, leaves viewers with <b>more</b> <b>questions</b> than answers as to his character, such as the newsreel footage where he is attacked for being both a communist and a fascist.|$|E
5|$|In the meantime, Hari {{gets his}} son Sankarshan (Saksham Kulkarni) married. Once Hari finds Uma sitting outside {{the room of}} the newly married couple, {{listening}} to their playful banter. Disgusted by Uma's behaviour, Hari starts avoiding her. Upset by this behaviour, Uma tries to talk her heart out to Hari's friend Balwant (Sanjay Khapre) and requests him {{to find out the}} reason. Coincidentally, Hari overhears this and severs his relations with Balwant. Unaware of the reason for Hari's changed behaviour, Uma starts staying aloof, while her health starts degrading. Worried Sankarshan requests his sister Shanti (Manava Naik) to talk to Uma. Frustrated and unknowing of what loss she had throughout her life, Uma opens her heart but situation raises <b>more</b> <b>questions</b> about her relation with Hari.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} week, Ronnie Mitchell (Samantha Womack) spots her ex-boyfriend Jack Branning (Scott Maslen) {{talking to}} Marsden; Jack tells Ronnie {{that he was}} fishing for information. With no new leads, Marsden's boss threatens to take her off the case. She reviews the suspects and decides to question Jack, since he is asking <b>more</b> <b>questions</b> than he has answered. In the café Marsden and Hughes discuss new information she has obtained, ensuring that she is overheard. Chinese whisper-style rumours circulate, ending with the certainty that Marsden would arrest Ronnie. Ronnie sees Marsden in the Square, and a struggle ensues. She knocks Marsden down, is {{arrested and charged with}} assaulting a police officer but is released on bail. Marsden suspects Ronnie further, saying that she has now shown her true colours. Later, DC Jasmine Field (Karen Ascoe) enters the pub with other officers to arrest a suspect; frightened, Ronnie leaves Walford. The police officers are there to arrest Dot Branning (June Brown), who was accused by Dotty Cotton (Molly Conlin) after Dot slapped her. Jack confronts Marsden for unnecessarily sending a uniformed officer to arrest Dot and unsettling the locals, and realises there was no new information.|$|E
60|$|When {{they reached}} the hall-door she had one <b>more</b> <b>question</b> to ask; {{but she could not}} look in her father's face as she asked.|$|R
60|$|I {{recognized}} that fact fully, and yet I lingered to ask one <b>more</b> <b>question,</b> never fancying {{of how much}} importance the answer might be to us.|$|R
6000|$|... "One <b>more</b> <b>question</b> and I have done," [...] {{said the}} captain. [...] "Do {{you see any}} {{particular}} objection to practicing a pious fraud on Mrs. Lecount?" ...|$|R
5|$|Wheeler {{presented}} the {{bill on the}} floor of the House of Representatives on April 6, 1918. He was quizzed by North Carolina's Claude Kitchin, who asked whether there had been a unanimous recommendation by the committee, whether McAdoo and Baker had approved the bill, and whether there was precedent for a half dollar in honor of a state's centennial (there was not). Wheeler reassured Kitchin as to the unanimity of the committee, and the approval by the officials, but did not answer the centennial question definitively, instead citing instances of prior commemorative issues (the Louisiana Purchase Exposition dollar and the Panama-Pacific commemorative coins). Ashbrook intervened, assuring Kitchin that his committee had unanimously approved it. Kitchin had no <b>more</b> <b>questions,</b> and the House approved the bill without a recorded vote.|$|E
25|$|A random {{selection}} of passers (generally {{understood to be}} those who get 35 or <b>more</b> <b>questions</b> correct) of this exam are later {{invited to participate in}} regional in-person auditions.|$|E
25|$|The {{publication}} of the report caused a sensation in Ireland, {{as shown by the}} political and media reaction. It is generally agreed that the report raised <b>more</b> <b>questions</b> than it answered and that it opened up new avenues of inquiry.|$|E
6000|$|... "One <b>more</b> <b>question,</b> Mr. Macheson," [...] Deyes {{continued}} quietly. [...] "Where do we {{find the}} lost souls--I mean upon what principle of selection do we work?" ...|$|R
60|$|And {{indeed there}} was no <b>more</b> <b>question</b> of my mysterious {{vocation}} between us. There was to be no <b>more</b> <b>question</b> of it at all, nowhere or with any one. We began the descent of the Furca Pass conversing merrily. Eleven years later, month for month, I stood on Tower Hill {{on the steps of}} the St. Katherine's Dockhouse, a master in the British Merchant Service. But the man who put his hand on my shoulder at the top of the Furca Pass was no longer living.|$|R
6000|$|... "None at all," [...] Wrayson declared. [...] "But, Colonel! {{there is}} one <b>more</b> <b>question</b> that I must ask you. Did Louise speak to you about her brother?" ...|$|R
25|$|Point of Origin is {{the second}} book in The Survivors series and was {{published}} on June 10, 2012. The second book picks up quickly where The Survivors ended and immediately poses <b>more</b> <b>questions</b> and theories behind Sadie and her family's existence.|$|E
25|$|Following a mid-October leak of {{information}} about his work record as a borough attorney, Miller {{held a news conference}} telling reporters that he was drawing {{a line in the sand}} and would not answer any <b>more</b> <b>questions</b> about his past.|$|E
25|$|Human Rights Watch {{likewise}} {{called for}} an independent international inquiry, saying that the IDF's report did not explain the attack, that it in effect raised <b>more</b> <b>questions</b> than it answered, and that contradicted eyewitness accounts of the timing, which denied legitimate military targets were around the building.|$|E
6000|$|... "Good!" [...] Staunton declared. [...] "One <b>more</b> <b>question.</b> You {{say that}} on the {{committee}} of the Rifle Club was a German officer. Do you know who he was?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "One <b>more</b> <b>question</b> I {{was going}} to ask you and it shall be the last," [...] he said, as though {{divining}} my feeling. [...] "Were you born here?" ...|$|R
50|$|Since 2015/16, {{the number}} of tasks is reduced to 4 (no <b>more</b> <b>question</b> 0, ie. enumeration), and the format are more like IOI (batch score and real time feedback).|$|R
25|$|This theory too had its problems, in {{particular}} the fact that Indra was already evidently a divine figure, and not a man, in the Mittani treaties, where he appears {{in the company of}} Mitra and Varuna. That again raises <b>more</b> <b>questions</b> since the treaties echo the Rig Veda's invocation of all three as protectors of contract, again, not a property associated with Verethragna.|$|E
25|$|With {{the jury}} absent, Fuhrman was {{called back to}} the witness stand by the defense to answer <b>more</b> <b>questions</b> about the {{discovery}} of the blood marks and leather glove that he found on Simpson's property. When questioned by attorney Gerald Uelmen, Fuhrman, with his lawyer standing by his side, pleaded the Fifth Amendment to avoid self-incrimination and further questioning after his integrity was challenged.|$|E
25|$|Nickell {{contends that}} the pirate theory raises <b>more</b> <b>questions</b> than it answers. He contends that a journey into Kentucky was a {{dangerous}} undertaking, and that Swift {{could just as easily}} set up a clandestine coining operation in the backwoods of Virginia or aboard his ship. He also questions why Swift would take the time to produce such a detailed journal to cover his story.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, I can't!" [...] he {{declared}} bitterly. [...] "You always {{get the best}} of it. I'll only ask you one <b>more</b> <b>question.</b> Are you having the wireless hauled down?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "One <b>more</b> <b>question,</b> and I have done. Have you on some {{occasions}} {{heard the}} sound of horses' hoofs in your yard at about the time that your son came in?" ...|$|R
30|$|As a {{digression}} {{from our}} main theme, and since recursively presented groups are mentioned in Appendix A, we formulate one <b>more</b> <b>question,</b> {{which is in}} some sense dual to Question 1.1.|$|R
25|$|Arithmetic word {{problems}} involve written text {{containing a}} set of data followed by one or <b>more</b> <b>questions</b> and {{require the use of}} the four basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division). Researchers suggest that successful completion of arithmetic word problems involves spatial working memory (involved in building schematic representations) which facilitates the creation of spatial relationships between objects. Creating spatial relationships between objects {{is an important part of}} solving word problems because mental operations and transformations are required.|$|E
25|$|Milton Bradley {{also created}} a Fine Edition and a Collector's Edition with <b>more</b> <b>questions.</b> The magic slates came {{enclosed}} in a gold-looking folder, plus a dial to keep score instead of the pegboard. The scoring and point values were just like the TV show. The only difference between the Fine Edition and the Collector's Edition is that instead of being packaged in a normal cardboard box, it came in a leatherette case with buttons on the front apron..|$|E
25|$|England's second innings batting {{effort was}} an {{improvement}} on the first, but still left people with <b>more</b> <b>questions</b> than answers. Andrew Strauss was out for 0, Michael Vaughan looked brilliant for 21 runs but then edged Makhaya Ntini through to Mark Boucher. Alastair Cook scored a decent score of 60, {{but not enough}} to get England out of trouble. Kevin Pietersen came in for the most criticism, scoring 13 runs of 4 balls before edging through to the keeper off the bowling of Jacques Kallis.|$|E
50|$|His {{most notable}} brush with fame was using {{his right knee}} to stop Australian prime {{minister}} Malcolm Fraser from closing his Commonwealth car passenger door to get in one <b>more</b> <b>question.</b>|$|R
6000|$|Jimmy Skunk chuckled. [...] "One <b>more</b> <b>question,</b> Unc' Billy," [...] said he. [...] "Did {{you ever}} know {{me to pick}} a quarrel and use that bag of scent without being attacked?" ...|$|R
