5|$|The use {{of writing}} has made {{language}} even <b>more</b> <b>useful</b> <b>to</b> humans. It {{makes it possible}} to store large amounts of information outside of the human body and retrieve it again, and it allows communication across distances that would otherwise be impossible. Many languages conventionally employ different genres, styles, and registers in written and spoken language, and in some communities, writing traditionally takes place in an entirely different language than the one spoken. There is some evidence that the use of writing also has effects on the cognitive development of humans, perhaps because acquiring literacy generally requires explicit and formal education.|$|E
25|$|Decimal numbers, while arguably <b>more</b> <b>useful</b> <b>to</b> {{work with}} when {{performing}} calculations, sometimes lack the precision that common fractions have. Sometimes an infinite repeating decimal {{is required to}} reach the same precision. Thus, it is often useful to convert repeating decimals into fractions.|$|E

For example, one could focus on the region of the curve with low false positive rate, which is often of prime interest for population screening tests. Another common approach for classification problems in which P ≪ N (common in bioinformatics applications) is to use a logarithmic scale for the x-axis.|$|E
25|$|During the Second World War the German Operation Bernhard {{attempted}} to counterfeit denominations between £5 and £50, producing 500,000 notes each month in 1943. The original {{plan was to}} parachute the money into the UK {{in an attempt to}} destabilise the British economy, but it was found <b>more</b> <b>useful</b> <b>to</b> use the notes to pay German agents operating throughout Europe. Although most fell into Allied hands {{at the end of the}} war, forgeries frequently appeared for years afterwards, which led banknote denominations above £5 to be removed from circulation.|$|E
25|$|The Jacobite cause did {{not entirely}} {{disappear}} after 1746 but {{the exposure of}} the key factions' conflicting objectives ended it as a serious threat; Stuart Unionism meant an independent Scotland was no longer attainable, while the ineffectiveness of the English Jacobites was highlighted by failure to provide substantive support (the only Englishmen punished for their part in the Rebellion {{were members of the}} Manchester Regiment). France's biggest issue was Britain's increasing financial strength; a Stuart king would not change that and d'Eguilles argued a low level civil war in Scotland was far <b>more</b> <b>useful</b> <b>to</b> France.|$|E

25|$|This changed due to France's {{concern at}} the huge {{expansion}} in British commerce and wealth arising from the commercial clauses of the Treaty of Utrecht. This increased their ability to finance a war while the British monarch's dual status as ruler of Hanover complicated France's strategic aims in Europe. A Stuart regime might {{solve the problem of}} Hanover but not Britain's economic power. This made an ongoing, low cost Jacobite insurgency <b>more</b> <b>useful</b> <b>to</b> France than a full scale Restoration, as Charles himself later pointed out. In addition, their statesmen continually underestimated the cost and complexity of seaborne invasions which meant a great deal of planning but very little action.|$|E
25|$|Eye colour {{varies from}} brown to blue, and {{occasionally}} eyes of differing colour occur; {{this is usually}} seen with merles. The ears of the Border Collie are also variable — some have fully erect ears, some fully dropped ears, and others semi-erect ears (similar {{to those of the}} rough Collie). Although working Border Collie handlers sometimes have superstitions about the appearance of their dogs (handlers may avoid mostly white dogs due to the unfounded idea that sheep will not respect a white or almost all white dog), in general a dog's appearance is considered by the American Border Collie Association to be irrelevant. It is considered much <b>more</b> <b>useful</b> <b>to</b> identify a working Border Collie by its attitude and ability than by its looks.|$|E
25|$|News of {{the conference}} leaked and Tory churchmen were shocked that Rochester might have wavered in his faith. Rochester {{requested}} another conference and James consented. Rochester {{let it be known}} to influential Catholics at court that he would do everything they requested (except convert) so long as he remained in office. He told them that as a Protestant he would prove <b>more</b> <b>useful</b> <b>to</b> them than as a Catholic. However, on 17 December James called Rochester into an audience and told him that so high an office of Lord Treasurer could not be held by a staunch Anglican under a Catholic monarch. James asked him to think again on his refusal to convert but Rochester would not and on 4 January 1687 he was dismissed. However he received a pension of approximately £4000 per annum and £40,000 and estates from a convicted traitor.|$|E

25|$|In 1831 Casimir Périer {{formed a}} more {{vigorous}} and compact administration, terminated in May 1832 by his death; {{the summer of}} that year was marked by a formidable republican rising in Paris, {{and it was not}} until 11 October 1832 that a stable government was formed, in which Marshal Soult was first minister, Victor, 3rd duc de Broglie took the foreign office, Adolphe Thiers the home department, and Guizot the department of public instruction. Guizot, however, was already unpopular with the more advanced liberal party. He remained unpopular all his life. Yet never were his great abilities <b>more</b> <b>useful</b> <b>to</b> his country than while he filled this office of secondary rank but of primary importance in the department of public instruction. The duties it imposed on him were entirely congenial to his literary tastes, and he was master of the subjects they concerned. He applied himself in the first instance to carry the law of 28 June 1833, which established and organized primary education in France.|$|E

500|$|Due to {{the limited}} {{circulation}} of the cumbersome [...] Eisenhower dollar, it was decided in the 1970s that a smaller dollar coin might prove <b>more</b> <b>useful</b> <b>to</b> the public. On September 26, 1978, Congress approved legislation to provide for a smaller dollar coin to be minted, which would depict Susan B. Anthony, a prominent American suffragette. These new dollars also proved unpopular, {{due in large part}} to their similarity in size and metallic composition to the quarter-dollar. Since there was little interest in the coin as a circulating medium, most were placed in United States Mint and Federal Reserve vaults throughout the country, and mintage ceased after 1981.|$|E

500|$|Bryan Enk, {{writing for}} UGO, {{states that the}} myth-making story of Söze's origins is a classic ghost story that would be right at home in horror fiction. Writing about psychopaths in film, {{academic}} Wayne Wilson explicitly compares Söze to Satan and assigns to him demonic motives. Wilson states that Söze allows himself to be caught just to prove his superiority over the police; this compromises his ultimate goal of anonymity, but Söze can not {{resist the urge to}} show off and create mischief. In The Journal of Nietzsche Studies, Lewis Call states that Söze's mythological status draws the ire of the authoritarian government agents because he [...] "represents a terrifying truth: that power is ephemeral, and has no basis in reality." [...] According to Call, Söze's intermediaries – the [...] "usual suspects" [...] themselves – are <b>more</b> <b>useful</b> <b>to</b> the police, as they represent an easily controlled and intimidated criminal underworld, in direct contrast to Söze himself.|$|E
