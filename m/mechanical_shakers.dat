To remedy the situation, Malmark Co. {{has created a}} bell made of aluminum instead of the traditional bronze. Holograms were taken of two G 1 handbells. The accelerance curves of both bells were plotted. It was found that except for the (2, 0) and the (3, 0) modes, all the other modes in the bronze and aluminum bells occur at different frequencies. In the bronze bell we observed a family of (m, 3 #) modes not found in smaller handbells. This was an unexpected result. The <b>mechanical</b> <b>shakers</b> and the magnet-coil vibrators were used to drive different objects and the results compared.

40|$|An {{important}} aspect {{that must be}} considered in harbor design and construction is the water quality within the basin, which depends on the water exchange between the harbor and the surrounding water body. The most internationally distinguished methods to counteract diminished flushing and insufficient renewal occurring leeward of coastal structures include <b>mechanical</b> <b>shakers,</b> overflows, pumps, permeable breakwaters, and flushing culverts. Among these methods, the construction of flushing culverts is favorable due to the low costs of construction and operation. In the present paper, wave transmission through flushing culverts was investigated experimentally in two physical models. Incident wave and transmitted wave heights were determined using wave gauges for various combinations of wave characteristics and geometric characteristics of the flushing culverts. Wave height transformation through the flushing culvert was processed and analyzed for all experimental conditions. The sensitivity of the wave transmission coefficient with respect to other dimensional and non-dimensional parameters was comprehensively investigated in order to define which parameters could most effectively predict the wave transmission coefficient. The wave transmission coefficient increased when the incident wave period, the width, and the height of the flushing culvert increased, the incident wave became steeper, the length of the flushing culvert decreased, and the incident wave angle approached 90 degrees. An empirical equation that correlates the wave transmission coefficient with the wave characteristics and the geometrical characteristics of the flushing culvert was derived using non-linear regression analysis.

40|$|The {{tree shaker}} {{is a high}} {{throughput}} hydro-mechanical systems used in nut and fruit harvest. Many commercial tree shakers use stacked counter rotating eccentric mass energy-wheels to dislodge the crop from the tree by attaching and shaking the trunk. Tree shakers are known to cause tree trunk damage by approach impact, barking, and bruising of the tree trunk. Tree trunk damage, catastrophic or accumulative, could account for a 4 % lifetime production loss, 1408 kg/hectare.;The energy-wheels are commonly known to create planer pulse forces. The pulse is created by the rotation of eccentric mass about a fixed common shaft. The frequency and magnitude of the force {{is determined by the}} weight, angular velocity, and center of gravity location of each energy wheel. The industry has developed pads and slings to conform to the tree trunk and transmit the force while minimizing the potential for trunk damage. Lubrication of the slings reduces the coefficient of friction and allows unwanted force dissipation. Lubrication of the slings reduce the transfer of non-normal forces.;This research discloses the presence of moments and extends the planer equations to allow analysis of moment magnitudes and the introduction of planer losses in the y-axis. Moments and planer forces are always present in stacked counter rotating eccentric mass energy-wheel systems. Moments are non-normal forces and are dissipated in the slings, pads, shaker head suspension system. Moments and y-axis losses reduce the efficiency of the system and require additional hardware and systems to control adverse effects on the tree trunk.;Understanding the magnitude of moments will allow development of new systems to extend the application of <b>mechanical</b> <b>shakers</b> to other crops and applications...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.), Department of Biological Systems Engineering, Washington State UniversitySweet cherry {{industry}} has been challenged by increasingly uncertain availability and rising cost of farm labor. As harvesting is the most labor-intensive operation, {{there is a need}} for developing automated harvesting solutions to address labor related challenges. Over the past several decades, researchers have studied <b>mechanical</b> <b>shakers</b> for efficient sweet cherry harvesting. Automating a shaking harvester using a machine vision system for detecting and locating tree branches has the potential to further reduce the labor demand for cherry harvesting. This research focused on detecting cherry tree branches in full foliage canopies. The branch detection method used visible branch sections in canopy images to reconstruct whole branches. Morphological features of the visible branch sections including orientation, length and thickness were used to group sections of the same branch together, which were then connected using a model equation. This method achieved a branch detection accuracy of 89 % in cherry trees trained in vertical trellis system. Using this method, in Y-trellis system with denser foliage, only 55 % branches were detected. Therefore, cherry clusters were detected and integrated for locating highly occluded branches. This method identified series of cherry clusters growing along specific branches and a model equation was fitted to reconstruct complete branches. This method led to a branch detection accuracy of 94 % in Y-trellis system. After branch detection, a method was developed to determine shaking positions on branches for effective cherry harvesting. Shaking locations were first identified in the color images. For each shaking position identified in the color image, 3 D location information was estimated using 3 D camera images. The distance to shaking positions from the camera was estimated with a root mean square value of 0. 064 m with this method. Cherry tree branches were then shaken at the estimated locations using a handheld shaker. Maximum fruit removal efficiency was found to be 93 % and 87 % in Y- and vertical trellis system respectively. The results of this research have shown a great potential for machine vision-based automated solutions for cherry harvesting.

Based on these tests, an active suspension system for the helicopter seat has been developed to be integrated on helicopter seats to reduce the vibration locally. This active suspension system included two stacked piezoelectric actuators installed on the seat frame as active struts to provide effective control authority to the critical mannequin vibration modes. A proof-of-concept active suspension system has been retrofitted on a full-scale Bell- 412 pilot seat and the performance has been evaluated through extensive closed-loop control experiments performed on a <b>mechanical</b> <b>shaker</b> system.
