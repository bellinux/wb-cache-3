On 22 October 1989, an alarm woke the shuttle crew when the gas generator fuel pump system A heaters on Auxiliary Power Unit (APU) 2 failed to recycle at the upper limits of the system. There were also some minor problems with the Flash Evaporator System for cooling the orbiter, and the cryogenic oxygen <b>manifold</b> <b>valve</b> 2, which was left closed {{for the rest of the}} mission.

50|$|Barrel sealed {{manifolds}} {{with two}} O-rings in parallel are {{more tolerant of}} minor misalignment and varied centre distance than face-sealed manifolds with single O-ring seals which {{are more likely to}} leak if impacted. Isolation manifolds provide the possibility of closing off one cylinder if there is an unrecoverable leak, conserving the remaining gas in the other cylinder. Cylinder or <b>manifold</b> <b>valve</b> knob extension operators (slobwinders) can be stiff, can trail and snag on things, and can be difficult to find when needed. Valve- and manifold protector frames are not necessary and may be worse line-traps than the valves.

40|$|Air {{motion in}} a {{cylinder}} of a {{spark ignition engine}} affects the air-fuel mixing behavior, combustion quality {{and the production of}} the exhaust gas emission. With upcoming stringent market regulations for petrol engines, it is necessary to enhance air-fuel mixing for proper combustion. Air-fuel mixing in an engine combustion chamber is studied by assessing the induced air flow swirl motion. Swirl is a rotational motion of a bulk mass within cylinder. Swirl is generated by shaping and contouring the intake <b>manifold,</b> <b>valve</b> ports and even the piston face. Swirl enhances air-fuel mixing and helps to spread flame-front during combustion. The objective {{of this paper is to}} analyze the impact of the asymmetric intake valve lift configurations towards in-cylinder air flow swirl behavior. The study is done on 4 cylinders, 1. 3 L engine. The engine has 2 intake valves in every cylinder. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) was used as a tool to assess the swirl motion in the case study models. At the end of this paper, the characteristics of the swirl flow motion on every case study models is studied by measuring the swirl ratio value inside the combustion chamber. Also, the pattern of the swirling flow inside the combustion chamber is studied by analyzing the velocity vector and turbulent kinetic energy plots...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{describes}} a {{drug delivery system}} for chronic pain that can accommodate multidrug protocols. An element {{that is important to}} the function of the system is a customized silicon micromachined <b>valve</b> <b>manifold.</b> Each <b>valve</b> is piezoelectrically actuated and operates by pressing an elon-gated valve seat against a shared glass substrate. The dual-valve substrate has two inlets and one outlet; a piezoresistive pres-sure sensor is embedded in the Si structure near each of these three ports. The sensors, which permit closed-loop control and error monitoring of the flow rate, have a typical sensitivity of 698 ppm/kPa. The 1 × 1. 5 × 3 cm 3 manifold provides modu-lation and mixing capabilities. The manifold is integrated into a stainless steel housing with a total volume of 130 cm 3 and a reservoir volume of 40 cm 3. Two spring-loaded polyethylene reservoirs feed the <b>valve</b> <b>manifold</b> at pressures up to 0. 52 kPa/mL. Benchtop tests of bolus and continuous flow delivery demonstrate flow rates ranging from 2. 30 to 0. 51 mL/h. (Both larger and smaller rates can be achieved by adjusting the parameters of the <b>manifold</b> <b>valves</b> or reservoir springs.) Additional tests suggest that the system can compensate for changes in spinal fluid pressure and that pressure profiles can be used to detect catheter occlusions and disconnects.

40|$|The {{design of}} intake <b>manifolds</b> and <b>valve</b> ports in {{internal}} combustion engines {{is a fundamental}} aspect of obtaining high volumetric efficiency and originating in-cylinder flows of proper intensity. CFD calculations using the RANS approach may support steady-state flow measurements {{in the design of}} intake <b>manifolds,</b> <b>valve</b> passages, and combustion chambers. On the other hand, the geometrical complexity of these engine parts hardly allows to mesh them by means of fully hexahedral grids and the accuracy of computations is strongly compromised. The paper presents the results of an experimental and numerical study performed on the head of a motorbike high-speed spark ignition engine. The work aims at investigating the reliability of CFD RANS computations performed on polyhedral grids of different size and assessing the mesh size required for accurate computations on such a type of grid. Discharge flow coefficients of the intake valves, in-cylinder tumble intensity, and static pressure along the surface of intake manifolds have been measured in a discharge flow test rig operating in steadystate conditions. Detailed geometry of actual bell-mouth inlet, intake ports and valves, combustion chamber roof, and cylinder wall has been obtained by using a reverse engineering technique. The geometry is used to build a CFD model which allowed to simulate the steady flow field measured during the experiments for several values of valve lift...|$|R
