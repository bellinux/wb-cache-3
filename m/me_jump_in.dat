I was to have gone by the boat train which left half an hour ago. I had taken a seat, and they assured me that the train would not leave for at least ten minutes, as the mails weren't in. I went down the platform to buy some papers and stood talking {{for a moment or two}} with a man whom I know. I suppose I must have been longer than I thought, or they must have been quicker than they expected with the mailbags. Anyhow, when I came back the train was moving. They would not let <b>me</b> <b>jump</b> <b>in.</b> I could have done it easily, but that fool of an inspector over there held me." ...|$|E
60|$|Well, I was all impatience now to {{get back}} to the others, and I had just given Violette her head, when {{suddenly}} I saw something glimmering in a field by the roadside. It was the brass-work upon the chasseur hat which had flown from Montluc's head; and at the sight of it a thought made <b>me</b> <b>jump</b> <b>in</b> the saddle. How could the hat have flown off? With its weight, would it not have simply dropped? And here it lay, fifteen paces from the roadway! Of course, he must have thrown it off when he had made sure that I would overtake him. And if he threw it off--I did not stop to reason any more, but sprang from the mare with my heart beating the pas-de-charge. Yes, it was all right this time. There, in the crown of the hat was stuffed a roll of papers in a parchment wrapper bound round with yellow ribbon. I pulled it out with the one hand and, holding the hat in the other, I danced for joy in the moonlight. The Emperor would see that he had not made a mistake when he put his affairs into the charge of Etienne Gerard.|$|E

6000|$|Up {{he goes to}} Mark, {{and begins}} wriggling against his knees, and looking up as only dogs can. [...] "Oh, want to go {{first-class}} with <b>me,</b> eh? <b>Jump</b> <b>in,</b> then!" [...] And <b>in</b> <b>jumps</b> the hound, and Mark struggles after him.|$|R
6000|$|... "For {{just one}} moment I wished I {{was back in the}} old Vallambrosa, {{starving}} and hoping. And then I got numb, and didn't care. And then I felt that somebody else was in the water close by me, holding me up. He had followed <b>me,</b> and <b>jumped</b> <b>in</b> to save <b>me.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{was enough}} for <b>me.</b> I <b>jumps</b> <b>in.</b> 'All over,' I says. 'My kid wins on a foul.' 'Foul nothing,' says Whiting. 'It was an accident, and you lose because you jumped into the fight, same as Connie McVey did when Corbett fought Sharkey. Think {{you can get away}} with it, pulling that old-time stuff?' I didn't trouble to argue with him. 'Oh,' I says, 'is that it? Say, just take a slant at your man. If you don't stop him quick he'll be in Texas.' ...|$|R

60|$|The {{name had}} given <b>me</b> a <b>jump.</b> Once, <b>in</b> another world, I had known a Jane Harvey. But Clark's Miss Harvey couldn't be Jane. A month before I had read a {{newspaper}} item {{to the effect that}} Jane was on the Pacific coast. Moreover, Jane, when I knew her, had certainly no manifest vocation for settlement work. I didn't think two years could have worked such a transformation. Two years! Was it only two years? It seemed more like two centuries.|$|R
5000|$|Louder Than The Musics Jono Davies noted how [...] "you {{can tell}} that Rhett will create music his way and say {{what he wants to}} say. This can be {{refreshing}} to hear but also makes listening to the songs an unsettling experience. Yet isnt being uncomfortable sometimes an inspiring thing? This album has turned me into a fan of Rhett Walkers work. Maybe for <b>me</b> the album <b>jumps</b> <b>in</b> styles a little too much, but the songs make up for it in so many ways." ...|$|R

"If you'll believe me, fully {{seven out}} of every ten of the club members had been knocked over from one to three times before we got any sense into Jimmy's wild head, and those who hadn't already come to harm were {{roosting}} mighty high, as if afraid that Slowly might lose his grip and come sailing up among the branches, {{as he would have}} done if any part of Jimmy's tail had come off suddenly. It didn't seem to me as if I had any call to mix up in the show, even though the president kept singing out for <b>me</b> to <b>jump</b> <b>in</b> and catch the crazy hedgehog, for when you find me mixing myself {{up with a lot of}} quills that are moving around as Jimmy's were then you'll catch Butcher Weasel asleep.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, Miss Tita--ah, Miss Tita," [...] I stammered, for all reply. I did {{not know}} what to do, as I say, but at a venture I made a wild, vague {{movement}} in consequence of which I found myself at the door. I remember standing there and saying, [...] "It wouldn't do--it wouldn't do!" [...] pensively, awkwardly, grotesquely, while I looked away to the opposite end of the sala as if there were a beautiful view there. The next thing I remember is that I was downstairs and out of the house. My gondola was there and my gondolier, reclining on the cushions, sprang up as soon as he saw <b>me.</b> I <b>jumped</b> <b>in</b> and to his usual [...] "Dove commanda?" [...] I replied, in a tone that made him stare, [...] "Anywhere, anywhere; out into the lagoon!" ...|$|R
60|$|The inexorable {{logic of}} facts had thus {{convinced}} the Professor of {{the impossibility of}} keeping all undergraduates permanently at a safe distance: {{and there was nothing}} open for him now except resignedly to acquiesce in the situation so created for him. However much he might object to my presence, he could hardly, as a Christian and a gentleman, request <b>me</b> to <b>jump</b> <b>in</b> and swim after my canoe, or even, when we had at last successfully brought it alongside with the aid of the pole, to seat myself once more on the soaking cushions. After all, my mishap had come about in the endeavour to render him a service: so he was fain with what grace he could to let me relieve his daughter of the pole, and punt him back as far as the barges, with my own moist and uncomfortable bark trailing casually from the stern.|$|R
6000|$|... "That's better," [...] he said. [...] "Well, I {{waited for}} a quarter of an hour, or more, when {{suddenly}} there came a noise like people struggling inside the house. Next moment the door was flung open and two men appeared, one of whom was Drebber, and the other was a young chap whom I had never seen before. This fellow had Drebber by the collar, and when they came {{to the head of the}} steps he gave him a shove and a kick which sent him half across the road. 'You hound,' he cried, shaking his stick at him; 'I'll teach you to insult an honest girl!' He was so hot that I think he would have thrashed Drebber with his cudgel, only that the cur staggered away down the road as fast as his legs would carry him. He ran as far as the corner, and then, seeing my cab, he hailed <b>me</b> and <b>jumped</b> <b>in.</b> 'Drive <b>me</b> to Halliday's Private Hotel,' said he.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm {{a pretty}} fair runner," [...] {{continued}} Pedro, [...] "but my friend is a better. He passed {{me like a}} deer. `Come on,' he cried, `you've no time to lose.' From which I knew he meant that the blackguards would cross the river in canoes and pursue me. He led me across a spit of jungle-land where the river took a sudden bend, and {{came out on the}} bank {{at the head of a}} long rapid. On reaching the bank he pulled out a small canoe which had been concealed there, and told <b>me</b> to <b>jump</b> <b>in.</b> `You'll have to run the rapid. It's not much of a chance, but it's your only one.' I squeezed his hand, thanked him hastily, and was soon paddling quickly with the current. In a few moments I heard my friend shouting with rage and brandishing his knife. He was acting, I knew. Looking back I saw that a number of men had joined him, and again the arrows began to drop around me, but I was soon beyond their reach and battling with the rapid.|$|R

40|$|Abstract Explosions {{generate}} extreme {{forces and}} pressures. They cause massive displacement, deformation and breakage of nearby objects. The chief damage mechanism of high explosives is the blast wave which they generate. A practical theory of explosives, blast waves and blast loading of structures is presented. This {{is used to}} develop a simplified visual model of explosions for use in computer graphics. A heuristic propagation model is developed which takes object occlusions into account when determining loading. The study of fracture mechanics is summarized. This is used to develop a fracture model that is significantly different from those previously used in computer graphics. This model propagates cracks within planar surfaces to generate fragmentation patterns. Visual results are presented, including the explosive destruction of a brick wall and the shattering of a window. iii Acknowledgements It is a pleasure to write acknowledgements {{at the end of}} a body of work. First of all, it gives you a chance to thank the people that have made the work possible. Second, it indicates that the work is finally done! To begin, I would like to thank my supervisor, Eugene Fiume. His insight contributed greatly to this work and his passionate nature was an important source of inspiration. My second reader, Michiel van de Panne, provided thoughtful and thorough feedback that significantly improved this thesis. More than this, he made himself available throughout this work to answer my numerous questions. I am also grateful to James Stewart and Demetri Terzopolous for useful discussions. My fellow students in DGP provided important help during this work and also made DGP a fun place to be. I'd like to thank some wonderful friends for providing an important source of distraction. Whether it was late night stories of Taiwanese pop stardom, driving across the continent with <b>me</b> to <b>jump</b> <b>in</b> the ocean or just getting me out of the lab for a few hours, thanks for being there...|$|R
