25|$|Both {{have higher}} risks than a vaginal birth with no {{previous}} caesarean section. There are many issues {{which must be}} taken into account when planning the <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> <b>delivery</b> for every pregnancy, not just those complicated by a previous caesarean section and there is a list of some of these issues in the list of indications for section in the first part of this article. A vaginal birth after caesarean section (VBAC) confers a higher risk of uterine rupture (5 per 1,000), blood transfusion or endometritis (10 per 1,000), and perinatal death of the child (0.25 per 1,000). Furthermore, 20% to 40% of planned VBAC attempts end in caesarean section being needed, with greater risks of complications in an emergency repeat caesarean section than in an elective repeat caesarean section. On the other hand, VBAC confers less maternal morbidity and a decreased risk of complications in future pregnancies than elective repeat caesarean section.|$|E
25|$|Since its inception, NETS has {{delivered}} its signature road safety campaign, Drive Safely Work Week (DSWW), through member companies and state partners. DSWW typically has an overarching theme, with specific topics or learning points delivered each {{day during the}} course of a week in October. As technology has evolved, the <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> <b>delivery</b> for DSWW materials has shifted from printed materials to electronic materials that may be downloaded from the Internet. Over the years, prevention of distracted driving has been a common theme for DSWW. In 2010 and 2011, NETS worked in partnership with the U.S. DOT to offer DSWW campaign materials on distracted driving free of charge, an arrangement that resulted in over 6,000 organizations downloading materials during 2010. One of NETS’s member services is the “Safety in Numbers” fleet safety benchmarking program, which provides international benchmarking services, with both qualitative and quantitative data from large companies representing various industry sectors. As a group, NETS member companies participating in the benchmarking program operate nearly half a million vehicles worldwide, with more than nine billion miles driven annually (Network of Employers for Traffic Safety, unpublished data).|$|E
25|$|The {{technique}} of selecting only one embryo {{to transfer to}} the woman is called elective-single embryo transfer (e-SET) or, when embryos are at the blastocyst stage, {{it can also be}} called elective single blastocyst transfer (eSBT). It significantly lowers the risk of multiple pregnancies, compared with e.g. Double Embryo Transfer (DET) or double blastocyst transfer (2BT), with a twinning rate of approximately 3.5% in sET compared with approximately 38% in DET, or 2% in eSBT compared with approximately 25% in 2BT. At the same time, pregnancy rates is not significantly less with eSBT than with 2BT. That is, the cumulative live birth rate associated with single fresh embryo transfer followed by a single frozen and thawed embryo transfer is comparable with that after one cycle of double fresh embryo transfer. Furthermore, SET has better outcomes in terms of mean gestational age at delivery, <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> <b>delivery,</b> birthweight, and risk of neonatal intensive care unit necessity than DET. e-SET of embryos at the cleavage stage reduces the likelihood of live birth by 38% and multiple birth by 94%. Evidence from randomized, controlled trials suggests that increasing the number of e-SET attempts (fresh and/or frozen) results in a cumulative live birth rate similar to that of DET.|$|E

60|$|But the {{deficiency}} which {{struck me}} most forcibly in the American post-office, was {{the absence of}} any recognized official delivery of letters. The United States post-office does not assume to itself the duty of taking letters to the houses of those for whom they are intended, but holds itself as having completed the work for which the original postage has been paid, when it has brought them to the window of the post-office of the town to which they are addressed. It is true that in most large towns--though by no means in all--a separate arrangement is made by which a delivery is afforded to those who are willing to pay a further sum for that further service; but the recognized official <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> <b>delivery</b> is from the office window. The merchants and persons in trade have boxes at the windows, for which they pay. Other old-established inhabitants in town, and persons in receipt of a considerable correspondence, receive their letters by the subsidiary carriers and pay for them separately. But the poorer classes of the community, those persons among which it is of such paramount importance to increase the blessing of letter writing, obtain their letters from the post- office windows.|$|E
60|$|As to any {{suspicion}} that Mr. Gilfil did not dispense the pure Gospel, or any strictures on his doctrine and <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> <b>delivery,</b> such thoughts never visited {{the minds of}} the Shepperton parishioners--of those very parishioners who, ten or fifteen years later, showed themselves extremely critical of Mr. Barton's discourses and demeanour. But in the interim they had tasted that dangerous fruit of the tree of knowledge--innovation which is well known to open the eyes, even in an uncomfortable manner. At present, to find fault with the sermon was regarded as almost equivalent to finding fault with religion itself. One Sunday, Mr. Hackit's nephew, Master Tom Stokes, a flippant town youth, greatly scandalized his excellent relatives by declaring that he could write as good a sermon as Mr. Gilfil's; whereupon Mr. Hackit sought to reduce the presumptuous youth to utter confusion, by offering him a sovereign if he would fulfil his vaunt. The sermon was written, however; and though it was not admitted to be anywhere within reach of Mr. Gilfil's. It was yet so astonishingly like a sermon, having a text, three divisions, and a concluding exhortation beginning 'And now, my brethren', that the sovereign, though denied formally, was bestowed informally, and the sermon was pronounced, when Master Stokes's back was turned, to be 'an uncommon cliver thing'.|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{importance}} of the therapist’s education and experience for the successful behavior treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) has not been investigated. Data on the relative effectiveness of self-controlled versus therapist-controlled in vivo exposure with response or ritual prevention (ERP) have yielded conflicting results. The present study compared the effectiveness <b>of</b> 4 different <b>modes</b> <b>of</b> <b>delivery</b> <b>of</b> ERP in a referred sample of OCD patients. Method: Of the 146 eligible OCD outpatients, 118 patients enrolled in this randomized controlled trial and {{were randomly assigned to}} (1) therapist-controlled ERP performed by experienced behavior therapists; (2) therapist-controlled ERP performed by master’s students of clinical psychology; (3) self-controlled ERP performed by experienced behavior therapists; and (4) self-controlled ERP performed by master’s students of clinical psychology. This trial was performed from January 1999 to January 2005. Results: Our analyses revealed no significant differences in clinical outcome between any <b>of</b> the different <b>modes</b> <b>of</b> <b>delivery</b> <b>of</b> ERP at posttreatment. The different ERP <b>modes</b> <b>of</b> <b>delivery</b> were associated with significant pretreatment to posttreatment improvement on all measurements, with large effect sizes on the primary outcome measure, the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale. Conclusions: Our results indicate that clinically inexperienced master’s students with no postgraduate training can be as capable as experienced and certified behavior therapists in treating OCD patients, as long as therapists adhere to a standardized treatment manual and adequate training and supervision is provided. In contrast to other studies, we did not find a supposed benefit of therapist-controlled ERP versus self-controlled ERP in patients with OCD...|$|R

40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the relation between}} elective cesarean section and vertical transmission of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1), we performed a meta-analysis using data on individual patients from 15 prospective cohort studies. North American and European studies of at least 100 mother-child pairs {{were included in the}} meta-analysis. Uniform definitions <b>of</b> <b>modes</b> <b>of</b> <b>delivery</b> were used. Elective cesarean sections were defined as those performed before onset of labor and rupture of membranes. Multivariate logistic-regression analysis was used to adjust for other factors known to be associated with vertical transmission. The primary analysis included data on 8533 mother-child pairs. After adjustment for receipt of antiretroviral therapy, maternal stage of disease, and infant birth weight, the likelihood of vertical transmission of HIV- 1 was decreased by approximately 50 percent with elective cesarean section, as compared with other <b>modes</b> <b>of</b> <b>delivery</b> (adjusted odds ratio, 0. 43; 95 percent confidence interval, 0. 33 to 0. 56). The results were similar when the study population was limited to those with rupture of membranes shortly before <b>delivery.</b> The likelihood <b>of</b> transmission was reduced by approximately 87 percent with both elective cesarean section and receipt of antiretroviral therapy during the prenatal, intrapartum, and neonatal periods, as compared with other <b>modes</b> <b>of</b> <b>delivery</b> and the absence of therapy (adjusted odds ratio, 0. 13; 95 percent confidence interval, 0. 09 to 0. 19). Among mother-child pairs receiving antiretroviral therapy during the prenatal, intrapartum, and neonatal periods, rates of vertical transmission were 2. 0 percent among the 196 mothers who underwent elective cesarean section and 7. 3 percent among the 1255 mothers with other <b>modes</b> <b>of</b> <b>delivery.</b> The results <b>of</b> this meta-analysis suggest that elective cesarean section reduces the risk of transmission of HIV- 1 from mother to child independently of the effects of treatment with zidovudine...|$|R
