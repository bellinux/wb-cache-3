Model agreement with observations {{depends on the}} length of the precipitation <b>accumulation</b> <b>period,</b> with similar results for both warm and cold halves of the year. For 6 - and 12 -h <b>accumulation</b> <b>periods,</b> simulated and observed spectra show little overlap. For daily and longer <b>accumulation</b> <b>periods,</b> the spectra are similar for moderate precipitation rates, though the model produces too many low-intensity precipitation events and too few high-intensity precipitation events for all <b>accumulation</b> <b>periods.</b> The spatial correlation of simulated and observed precipitation events indicates that the model 2 ̆ 7 s 50 -km grid spacing is too coarse to simulate well high-intensity events. Spatial correlations with and without very light precipitation indicate that coarse resolution is not a direct cause of excessive low-intensity events. The model shows less spread than observations in its pattern of spatial correlation versus distance, suggesting that resolved model circulation patterns producing 6 -hourly precipitation are limited in the range of precipitation patterns they can produce compared to the real world. The correlations also indicate that replicating observed precipitation intensity distributions for 6 -h <b>accumulation</b> <b>periods</b> requires grid spacing smaller than about 15 km, suggesting that models with grid spacing substantially larger than this will be unable to simulate the observed diurnal cycle of precipitation...|$|R

30|$|The {{estimation}} of the permeability of reservoirs with different diagenetic facies indicated that the permeability of the reservoir ranged from 10  ×  10 − 3  μm 2 to 4207  ×  10 − 3  μm 2 in the early <b>accumulation</b> <b>period.</b> When there is no fault development in the sand body, the fluid pressure increased by hydrocarbon generation is the main accumulation dynamic. The fluid pressure increased by hydrocarbon generation is 1.4 – 11.3  MPa with an average value of 5.1  MPa. Using the minimum accumulation dynamics of 1.4  MPa, the maximum cutoff-value for permeability in the <b>accumulation</b> <b>period</b> at a formation temperature of 125  °C was calculated to be 0.058  ×  10 − 3  μm 2. The permeability of the reservoir in the early <b>accumulation</b> <b>period</b> was much higher than this cutoff-value, so all the studied reservoirs could accumulate hydrocarbon. When there is fault development in the sand body, the surplus pressure is the main accumulation dynamic. The surplus pressure is 1.8 – 12.6  MPa {{with an average of}} 6.3  MPa. Using the minimum accumulation dynamics of 1.8  MPa, the maximum cutoff-value for permeability in the <b>accumulation</b> <b>period</b> at a formation temperature of 125  °C was calculated to be 0.037  ×  10 − 3  μm 2. The permeability of the reservoirs in the early <b>accumulation</b> <b>period</b> was much higher than this cutoff-value, so all the studied reservoirs could accumulate hydrocarbon.|$|R
30|$|In {{the later}} <b>accumulation</b> <b>period</b> the {{permeability}} {{had been reduced}} {{and was in the}} range of 0.015  ×  10 − 3  μm 2 to 62  ×  10 − 3  μm 2. The fluid pressure increased by hydrocarbon generation was 0.7  MPa to 12.7  MPa with an average of 5.4  MPa in the late <b>accumulation</b> <b>period.</b> Using the minimum accumulation dynamics of 0.7  MPa, the maximum cutoff-value for permeability in the <b>accumulation</b> <b>period</b> at a formation temperature of 125  °C was calculated to be 0.203  ×  10 − 3  μm 2. Using the maximum accumulation dynamics of 12.7  MPa, the minimum cutoff-value for permeability in the <b>accumulation</b> <b>period</b> at a formation temperature of 125  °C is calculated to be 0.001  ×  10 − 3  μm 2. So, at the high level of accumulation dynamics hydrocarbon can accumulate in all studied reservoirs. Reservoirs with diagenetic facies A and diagenetic facies B do not develop accumulation conditions at the low level of accumulation dynamics, because the permeability of reservoirs with diagenetic facies A and diagenetic facies B is lower than the maximum cutoff value. The surplus pressure is 1.3 – 16.2  MPa with an average of 6.6  MPa. Using the minimum accumulation dynamics 1.3  MPa, the maximum cutoff-value for permeability in the <b>accumulation</b> <b>period</b> at a formation temperature of 125  °C was calculated to be 0.066  ×  10 − 3  μm 2.

So, different kinds of reservoirs can all accumulate hydrocarbon with high accumulation dynamics.

30|$|The {{relationships}} between permeability and dynamics in hydrocarbon accumulation determine oil-bearing potential (the potential oil charge) of low permeability reservoirs. The evolution of porosity and permeability of low permeability turbidite reservoirs {{of the middle}} part of the third member of the Shahejie Formation in the Dongying Sag has been investigated by detailed core descriptions, thin section analyses, fluid inclusion analyses, carbon and oxygen isotope analyses, mercury injection, porosity and permeability testing, and basin modeling. The cutoff values for the permeability of the reservoirs in the <b>accumulation</b> <b>period</b> were calculated after detailing the accumulation dynamics and reservoir pore structures, then the distribution pattern of the oil-bearing potential of reservoirs controlled by the matching relationship between dynamics and permeability during the <b>accumulation</b> <b>period</b> were summarized. On {{the basis of the}} observed diagenetic features and with regard to the paragenetic sequences, the reservoirs can be subdivided into four types of diagenetic facies. The reservoirs experienced two <b>periods</b> of hydrocarbon <b>accumulation.</b> In the early <b>accumulation</b> <b>period,</b> the reservoirs except for diagenetic facies A had middle to high permeability ranging from 10  ×  10 − 3  μm 2 to 4207  ×  10 − 3   μm 2. In the later <b>accumulation</b> <b>period,</b> the reservoirs except for diagenetic facies C had low permeability ranging from 0.015  ×  10 − 3  μm 2 to 62  ×  10 − 3  μm 2. In the early <b>accumulation</b> <b>period,</b> the fluid pressure increased by the hydrocarbon generation was 1.4 – 11.3  MPa with an average value of 5.1  MPa, and a surplus pressure of 1.8 – 12.6  MPa with an average value of 6.3  MPa. In the later <b>accumulation</b> <b>period,</b> the fluid pressure increased by the hydrocarbon generation process was 0.7 – 12.7  MPa with an average value of 5.36  MPa and a surplus pressure of 1.3 – 16.2  MPa with an average value of 6.5  MPa. Even though different types of reservoirs exist, all can form hydrocarbon accumulations in the early <b>accumulation</b> <b>period.</b> Such types of reservoirs can form hydrocarbon accumulation with high accumulation dynamics; however, reservoirs with diagenetic facies A and diagenetic facies B do not develop accumulation conditions with low accumulation dynamics in the late <b>accumulation</b> <b>period</b> for very low permeability. At more than 3000  m burial depth, a larger proportion of turbidite reservoirs are oil charged due to the proximity to the source rock. Also at these depths, lenticular sand bodies can accumulate hydrocarbons. At shallower depths, only the reservoirs with oil-source fault development can accumulate hydrocarbons. For flat surfaces, hydrocarbons have always been accumulated in the reservoirs around the oil-source faults and areas near the center of subsags with high accumulation dynamics.|$|R

3000|$|With the {{increasing}} interest {{in oil and}} gas exploration and development, low permeability clastic rock reservoirs are becoming key exploration target areas (Yang et al. 2010; Cao et al. 2012). The low permeability clastic rock reservoirs have gone through complex diagenetic events (Yang et al. 2010; Wang et al. 2011). The distribution of sandstone porosity is not consistent with the hydrocarbon accumulation. The porosity of sandstone during the <b>accumulation</b> <b>period</b> is the key factor to determine the oiliness of the reservoirs (Cao et al. 2012; Liu et al. 2014 a; Wang et al. 2014 a). Some researchers have attempted to extract data from the porosity of low permeability clastic rock reservoirs during the <b>accumulation</b> <b>period</b> (Cao et al. 2011, 2012, 2013; Wang et al. 2013 a; Liu et al. 2014 a). However, they did not calculate the cutoff values for porosity of the reservoir under the control of accumulation dynamics during the <b>accumulation</b> <b>period</b> (Pan et al. 2011; Wang et al. 2014 a; Liu et al. 2014 a). The distribution of the oil-bearing potential of reservoirs is still poorly understood. The relationships between porosity and the oil-bearing potential of turbidite reservoirs of the middle part of the third member of Shahejie Formation (Es 3 z [...]) in Dongying Sag are complex, even though the reservoirs have similar accumulation conditions. The high or low porosity and permeability sandstone reservoirs either contain oil or not. Liu et al. (2014 a, b) analyzed the relationship between porosity and the cutoff-values for porosity in the early <b>accumulation</b> <b>period</b> of Es 3 z [...] turbidite reservoirs in Niuzhuang subsag with the guide of porosity estimation and effect-oriented simulation. They concluded that the porosity of reservoirs in the early <b>accumulation</b> <b>period</b> was higher than the cutoff-values for porosity of the reservoirs. So the reservoirs could be charged with oil. The permeability is the main controlling factor for percolation and the development of low permeability reservoirs (Meng et al. 2013). There were several stages of accumulation for the Es 3 z [...] turbidite reservoirs in the Dongying Sag and the later <b>accumulation</b> <b>period</b> was the most important (Cai 2009). The permeability and the cutoff-values at the later <b>accumulation</b> <b>period</b> are the most important for the distribution of the oil-bearing potential of reservoirs today.|$|R

30|$|Similar {{reservoir}} sandbodies and fault conduit {{systems in}} the sandstone reservoirs in the middle Es 3 member of the Niuzhuang Sag have been problematic for a long time. The following problems remain unsolved: 1) The distribution of sandstone porosity is inconsistent with the hydrocarbon accumulation. The oil sandstones have low porosity instead of high porosity. 2) Sandstones, which have the same properties, have different levels of oiliness, and the sandstones with almost the same properties show different degrees of oil-bearing capacity. This study analyzes the condition of reservoirs in the research area during the <b>accumulation</b> <b>period</b> in terms of paleoporosity estimation and discusses the critical porosity of the sandstone reservoirs during the same period. The following conclusions {{can be drawn from}} the results. 1) Although reservoir properties are low at present and some reservoirs have become tight, the paleoporosity ranging from 18 % to 25 % is greater than the critical porosity of 13.9 %. As the loss of porosity is different in terms of burial history, the present porosity cannot reflect porosity during the <b>accumulation</b> <b>period.</b> Similarly, high porosity during the <b>accumulation</b> <b>period</b> does not indicate that the present porosity is high. 2) The present reservoir location is consistent with the distribution of high paleoporosity during the <b>accumulation</b> <b>period.</b> This result indicates that high porosity belts are prone to hydrocarbon accumulation because of the dominant migration pathways generated as a result of property discrepancies under similar fault conduit conditions. Consequently, the hydrocarbon mainly accumulates in high porosity belts. Paleoporosity during the <b>accumulation</b> <b>period</b> is found to be a vital controlling factor. Therefore, high paleoporosity sandstones in the middle Es 3 member of the Niuzhuang Sag have great potential for future exploration.|$|R
