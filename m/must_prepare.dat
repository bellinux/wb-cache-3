5|$|Certain {{events can}} take place while {{managing}} the tower. For example, terrorists may phone the player {{to let them know}} that they have hidden a bomb in the building, and that they demand a ransom. If the ransom is not paid, then security services must find the bomb before it detonates, or else the tower will incur significant damages. If the player builds facilities underground, the game may notify them that their workers have discovered gold treasure, which gives the player a significant amount of funds. At random intervals during the game, there are notifications that state that a VIP will be visiting the tower soon, so the player <b>must</b> <b>prepare</b> for their visit. If the VIP enjoys their visit because of variables such as a comfortable hotel suite and efficient navigation, the VIP will give the tower a favorable rating. A favorable rating would then allow the tower to advance to the next star level, assuming the other qualifications are met. Although it does not have any impact on the tower, at the end of the fourth quarter every year in the game, Santa Claus and his reindeer fly across the tower.|$|E
25|$|As {{part of the}} Single Audit, {{the auditor}} <b>must</b> <b>prepare</b> and submit three {{individual}} reports to the recipient and to the federal government. The first report is an opinion, or a disclaimer thereof, on whether the recipient’s financial statements are presented in conformity with US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, identical to a financial audit’s report on a non-recipient entity. The second report is {{about the status of}} internal controls relative to the financial statements and major programs. The third report is an opinion, or a disclaimer thereof, on {{the degree to which the}} recipient has complied with laws, regulations, and the terms and conditions of the federal assistance awards. Following the last two reports, if the Single Audit produced audit findings, the auditor <b>must</b> <b>prepare</b> the Schedule of Findings and Questioned Costs discussed earlier.|$|E

It {{contains}} only butter, water, flour and eggs. Instead of a raising agent, it employs high moisture content to create steam during cooking to puff the pastry. The pastry is used in many European and European-derived cuisines.|$|E

However, {{there is no need}} to stop if his way is clear. A driver who stops has yielded his right of way to another. The yield sign, but not the yield traffic rule itself, was invented in 1939 by Tulsa police officer Clinton Riggs.|$|E
25|$|The Atari 2600 is {{generally}} considered to be a very demanding programming environment, with a mere 128 bytes of RAM available without additional hardware, and no video frame buffer at all. The programmer <b>must</b> <b>prepare</b> each line of video output one at a time as it is being sent to the television. The only sprite capabilities the 2600 offers are one-dimensional 1-bit and 8-bit patterns; creating a two-dimensional object requires changing the pattern between each line of video.|$|E

25|$|Grizzly bears {{hibernate}} for 5–7 months {{each year}} except where {{the climate is}} warm, as the California grizzly did not hibernate. During this time, female grizzly bears give birth to their offspring, who then consume milk from their mother and gain strength {{for the remainder of}} the hibernation period. To prepare for hibernation, grizzlies <b>must</b> <b>prepare</b> a den, and consume an immense amount of food as they do not eat during hibernation. Grizzly bears do not defecate or urinate throughout the entire hibernation period. The male grizzly bear's hibernation ends in early to mid-March, while females emerge in April or early May.|$|E
25|$|Legal writing values precedent, as {{distinct}} from authority. Precedent means the way things have been done before. For example, a lawyer who <b>must</b> <b>prepare</b> a contract and who has prepared a similar contract before will often re-use, with limited changes, the old contract for the new occasion. Or a lawyer who has filed a successful motion to dismiss a lawsuit may use the same or a very similar form of motion again in another case, and so on. Many lawyers use and re-use written documents in this way and call these re-usable documents templates or, less commonly, forms.|$|E
25|$|As well {{as being}} an {{everyday}} beverage, Turkish coffee is {{also a part of}} the traditional Turkish wedding custom. As a prologue to marriage, the bridegroom's parents (in the lack of his father, his mother and an elderly member of his family) must visit the young girl's family to ask the hand of the bride-to-be and the blessings of her parents upon the upcoming marriage. During this meeting, the bride-to-be <b>must</b> <b>prepare</b> and serve Turkish coffee to the guests. For the groom's coffee, the bride-to-be sometimes uses salt instead of sugar to gauge his character. If the bridegroom drinks his coffee without any sign of displeasure, the bride-to-be assumes that the groom is good-tempered and patient. As the groom already comes as the demanding party to the girl's house, in fact it is the boy who is passing an exam and etiquette requires him to receive with all smiles this particular present from the girl, although {{in some parts of the}} country this may be considered as a lack of desire on the part of the girl for marriage with that candidate.|$|E

500|$|Thor {{is again}} the main {{character}} in the poem Hymiskviða, where, after the gods have been hunting and have eaten their prey, they have an urge to drink. They [...] "sh the twigs" [...] and interpret what they say. The gods decide that they would find suitable cauldrons at Ægir's home. Thor arrives at Ægir's home and finds him to be cheerful, looks into his eyes, and tells him that he <b>must</b> <b>prepare</b> feasts for the gods. Annoyed, Ægir tells Thor that the gods must first bring to him a suitable cauldron to brew ale in. The gods search but find no such cauldron anywhere. However, Týr tells Thor {{that he may have}} a solution; east of Élivágar lives Hymir, and he owns such a deep kettle.|$|E
500|$|Feng {{also participated}} in the women's team {{competition}} with Li Jiawei and Wang Yuegu. They were beaten 0–3 by Japan in the semifinals, but took the bronze medal by edging out South Korea 3–0.

Li and Wang then succeeded in the doubles game against Seok and Dang Ye Seo 11–9, 11–6, 6–11, 11–5. This {{marked the first time}} Singapore had won more than one medal at an Olympic Games.

500|$|The first verse {{reflects}} Harrison and Prabhupada's {{discussion that}} day – although {{the reference to}} political leaders [...] "acting like big girls" [...] {{is an example of}} Harrison reverting to [...] "Scouse parlance", according to author Alan Clayson. The latter also notes the antipathy that Harrison felt towards politicians following the Bangladesh aid project, when the American and British governments continued to withhold funds intended for the millions of starving Bangladeshi refugees. The lyric centres on maya, or the illusory nature of human existence, as Harrison sings of humankind behaving as if [...] "we own this whole world", oblivious to the consequences and the end that awaits the individual in this life. Allison summarises the message to mean: [...] "karma is the law of our existence; substituting ego for God is our problem; we <b>must</b> <b>prepare</b> ourselves for death." ...|$|E
500|$|On September 6, General Clinton wrote {{a letter}} to Cornwallis, telling him to expect reinforcements. [...] Received by Cornwallis on September 14, this letter may have been {{instrumental}} in the decision by Cornwallis to remain at Yorktown and not try to fight his way out, despite the urging of Banastre Tarleton to break out against the comparatively weak Lafayette. [...] The British military leadership in New York held a council on September 17 in which they agreed that Cornwallis could not be reinforced until they had regained control of the Chesapeake. [...] Historian Richard Ketchum describes the decision of the council as leaving Cornwallis [...] "dangling in the wind." [...] One day earlier, Cornwallis wrote a desperate plea for help: [...] "I am of the opinion that you can do me no effectual service but by coming directly to this place." [...] Before dispatching the letter on the 17th, Cornwallis added, [...] "If you cannot relieve me very soon, you <b>must</b> <b>prepare</b> to hear the worst".|$|E
500|$|Act three {{introduces}} the Shadow Reavers, a sect of powerful undead mages {{that include a}} revived Garius, still intent on resurrecting the King of Shadows. The player <b>must</b> <b>prepare</b> Crossroad Keep for imminent battle by fortifying its troops and lands. After additional shards are retrieved by defeating Shadow Reavers, the shards are reformed into a powerful unique weapon for the player character, the Silver Sword of Gith. The sword, stolen by Ammon Jerro in the first battle against the King of Shadows, is the only weapon that can resist the enemy's power. The army of the Shadow Reavers lays siege to Crossroads Keep and is repelled by the occupants. After making their way through Garius' new stronghold, the party engages the mage in a second confrontation. After Garius is defeated, good members of the party begin the final fight against the King of Shadows. Evil and neutral characters (including the player character, if applicable) can decide to attack the King or fight alongside him. A cutscene afterwards details the battle's effect on the world, and ends on a cliffhanger which is continued in the [...] expansion pack.|$|E
