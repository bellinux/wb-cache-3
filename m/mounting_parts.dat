50|$|The seal is {{designed}} to have a point contact between the O-ring and sealing faces. This allows a high local stress, able to contain high pressure, without exceeding the yield stress of the O-ring body. The flexible nature of O-ring materials accommodates imperfections in the <b>mounting</b> <b>parts.</b> But {{it is still important}} to maintain good surface finish of those mating parts, especially at low temperatures where the seal rubber reaches its glass transition temperature and becomes increasingly crystalline. Surface finish is also especially important in dynamic applications. A surface finish that is too rough will abrade the surface of the O-ring, and a surface that is too smooth will not allow the seal to be adequately lubricated by a fluid film.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} a new method for an {{improved}} load prediction for <b>mounting</b> <b>parts</b> of railway vehicle running gears will be introduced. This approach enhances, among other things, {{the possibility of}} a systematic investigation of different influences on the loads caused by track irregularities. The simulation model which is used within this thesis is based on an elastic multibody system (EMBS) of a bogie. The solution and therefore also the load assumption is carried out in the frequency domain. For the load assumption several frequency response functions (FRF) are calculated which represent the system behavior. Finally based on the system excitation in combination with the system response, the load for certain system outputs can be calculated. Furthermore, by the variation of different parameters the impact of the track associated excitation on the load of the <b>mounting</b> <b>parts</b> can be investigated more structured...|$|E

The device is used for matching the unique size and shape of the head of a wearer. The device which is provided with an electrode array which is arranged in the device and can be mounted on the head comprises <b>mounting</b> <b>parts</b> which can be mounted on the head, and the <b>mounting</b> <b>parts</b> are mutually connected by mechanical fasteners to be convenient for the adjustment of the size and the position of the device which can be mounted on the head. An elastic sleeve array is arranged in a part of each mounting part which can be mounted on the head. A single electrode is accommodated in each sleeve array which is deformable for self orientation. The deformation of the sleeves causes the center shaft of the single electrode accommodated in the elastic sleeve to be maintained at the position nearly perpendicular to the plane tangent line of the scalp part relatively positioned below the electrode. 基于径向可调节的电极提供了一种可头部安装并具有脑电图用电极的装置，以匹配佩戴者独有的头部尺寸和形状。具有设置在其中的电极阵列的可头部安装的装置包括可头部安装的装置部分，其通过机械紧固件互连以方便可头部安装的装置的尺寸和位置调节。每个可头部安装的装置部分中设有弹性套筒阵列。每个弹性套筒容纳单个电极，且为可变形的以自定向。套筒的变形使得穿过容纳在弹性套筒内的单个电极的中心轴维持在相对位于电极下的头皮部分的平面切线近似垂直的位置处。Interdisciplinary Division of Biomedical EngineeringIndustrial CentreInventor name used in this publication: 汤启宇Inventor name used in this publication: 俞斌Inventor name used in this publication: 彭民杰Inventor name used in this publication: 何思杰Inventor name used in this publication: 胡晓翎Inventor name used in this publication: 谭惠民Inventor name used in this publication: 吴树滔Title in Traditional Chinese: 一種可頭部安裝並具有腦電圖用電極的裝置Chin...|$|E
30|$|The {{major factors}} {{determining}} the mechanical conditions of a healing fracture or osteotomy, {{in addition to}} the biomechanical specifications of the fixation device, the fracture configuration and the accuracy of reduction, are the amount and type of stresses occurring at the bone ends dictated by the functional activity and the loading at the fracture gap [1]. The biomechanical principle of the Ilizarov external fixator relies on axial compressive loads and micromotions that occur on weight loading [4, 5, 11]. Ilizarov and other authors recommend mobilisation of the patients with full weight bearing when treated with the Ilizarov external fixator [15, 16, 17], and the beneficial effects have been shown in vivo during distraction osteogenesis [18]. Precise knowledge of the biomechanical effects of the different <b>mounting</b> <b>parts</b> of the Ilizarov fixator is important to estimate the possible amount of interfragmentary motions during treatment. All biomechanical studies on the Ilizarov external fixator were performed with force application on both bone segments as in direct weight loading. This study showed a substantial effect when axial weight was applied only from the proximal bone end, which is the practical effect of a weight-bearing platform.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{a new type}} of hybrid {{reluctance}} actuator is presented. This linear hybrid reluctance actuator is a two phase double sided actuator in which the stator is composed by four normalized U cores, each with a coil wrapped around the yoke connecting the two arms of the core or with two coils wound on each of the arms and a permanent magnet placed near the air gap between and in contact with both arms. The mover is comprised of rectangular poles without connecting iron pieces between them but mechanically joined by non-magnetic <b>mounting</b> <b>parts.</b> The magnets are arranged so that their flux is in parallel to the flux created when the coils are energized, both fluxes are added and the total reinforced flux links the stator and the mover. But when no currents flow through the coils no flux crosses the air gap, and the flux of the magnets is closed through the back iron that supports them. An analysis and simulation of the motor using 2 D finite element and MATLAB Simulink is carried out. Finally, a comparison of this type of actuator with respect a linear reluctance stepper motor of the same size is shown. Postprint (published version...|$|E
