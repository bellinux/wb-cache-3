5|$|Monument 65 is a {{badly damaged}} {{depiction}} of a human head in Olmec style, dating to the Middle Preclassic. Its eyes are closed and the <b>mouth</b> <b>and</b> <b>nose</b> are completely destroyed. It is wearing a helmet. It is located {{to the west of}} Structure12.|$|E
5|$|Beagles may {{exhibit a}} {{behaviour}} known as reverse sneezing, {{in which they}} sound {{as if they are}} choking or gasping for breath, but are actually drawing air in through the <b>mouth</b> <b>and</b> <b>nose.</b> The exact cause of this behaviour is not known, but it can be a common occurrence and is not harmful to the dog.|$|E
5|$|It is {{difficult}} to make a single, definitive description of the folkloric vampire, though there are several elements common to many European legends. Vampires were usually reported as bloated in appearance, and ruddy, purplish, or dark in colour; these characteristics were often attributed to the recent drinking of blood. Blood was often seen seeping from the <b>mouth</b> <b>and</b> <b>nose</b> when one was seen in its shroud or coffin and its left eye was often open. It would be clad in the linen shroud it was buried in, and its teeth, hair, and nails may have grown somewhat, though in general fangs were not a feature. Although vampires were generally described as undead, some folktales spoke of them as living beings.|$|E

50|$|Columbian ground squirrels, when encountering each other, {{commonly}} {{will touch}} their <b>mouths</b> <b>and</b> <b>noses</b> together, an act resembling kissing. These greetings last 1-5 seconds and may precede other social interactions, including sexual activity.|$|R
5|$|Positive airway pressure, {{initially}} in {{the form}} of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), is a useful treatment for obesity hypoventilation syndrome, particularly when obstructive sleep apnea co-exists. CPAP requires the use during sleep of a machine that delivers a continuous positive pressure to the airways and preventing the collapse of soft tissues in the throat during breathing; it is administered through a mask on either the <b>mouth</b> <b>and</b> <b>nose</b> together or if that is not tolerated on the nose only (nasal CPAP). This relieves the features of obstructive sleep apnea and is often sufficient to remove the resultant accumulation of carbon dioxide. The pressure is increased until the obstructive symptoms (snoring and periods of apnea) have disappeared. CPAP alone is effective in more than 50% of people with OHS.|$|E
25|$|The {{traditional}} Shar Pei that is {{most popular}} in China is more faithful {{to the history of}} the breed (taller, less wrinkly, flatter <b>mouth</b> <b>and</b> <b>nose,</b> horse coated). As puppies, they have lots of wrinkles and as they get older, they get fewer wrinkles.|$|E
25|$|Water torture: The {{victim was}} tied up and laid flat on the ground. Water was forced through the <b>mouth</b> <b>and</b> <b>nose</b> until the victim's stomach became distended, after which the interrogators would jump on the victim's stomach to force out the water, until the victim lost consciousness.|$|E
60|$|Presently he {{came within}} earshot, and listened attentively, though without much interest, {{to a deal}} of boastful small talk with which the marauders beguiled the time, while they {{fumigated}} their <b>mouths</b> <b>and</b> <b>noses</b> preparatory to turning in for the night.|$|R

25|$|If {{hospital}} {{care is not}} possible, the World Health Organization has guidelines for care at home that have been relatively successful. In such situations, recommendations include using towels soaked in bleach solutions when moving infected people or bodies and applying bleach on stains. It is also recommended that the caregivers wash hands with bleach solutions and cover their <b>mouth</b> <b>and</b> <b>nose</b> with a cloth.|$|E
25|$|Rescue {{involves}} {{bringing the}} person's <b>mouth</b> <b>and</b> <b>nose</b> {{above the water}} surface. A drowning person may cling to the rescuer and try to pull {{himself out of the}} water, submerging the rescuer in the process. Rescuers should avoid endangering themselves unnecessarily and where possible should provide assistance from a safe position, such as a boat, or by providing flotation or a means of towing from a distance.|$|E
25|$|Cutting fluids {{present some}} {{mechanisms}} for causing illness or injury in workers. Occupational exposure {{is associated with}} increases in cardiovascular disease. These mechanisms {{are based on the}} external (skin) or internal contact involved in machining work, including touching the parts and tooling; being splattered or splashed by the fluid; or having mist settle on the skin or enter the <b>mouth</b> <b>and</b> <b>nose</b> in the normal course of breathing.|$|E
60|$|I {{glanced toward}} Xodar and the youth {{and saw that}} they had slipped {{over the edge of}} the dock into the water. In {{accordance}} with our plan they were to remain there clinging to the metal rings which studded the concrete-like substance of the dock at the water's level, with only their <b>mouths</b> <b>and</b> <b>noses</b> above the surface of the sea, until I should join them.|$|R
30|$|As we know, when {{considering}} the mechanism of pronunciation for human, the history phoneme information, including the shape changes of vocal cords, <b>mouths,</b> <b>and</b> <b>noses,</b> occupy the most impacts of sequential information. The future information play an auxiliary role, such as continuous changes of vocal organs. In addition, one of the successful key points behind the RNN is that they model the temporal relationships over phonemes. In general, the relationships between phonemes are constrained within word boundaries. The future information within word boundaries may be most useful to help to learn the current phoneme information.|$|R
50|$|The central {{region of}} the Sea of Dust is the most alien. Rather than gray ash, the {{substance}} of the Sea is a white, caustic powder that blows around and causes those who do not protect their <b>mouths</b> <b>and</b> <b>noses</b> with damp cloths to cough blood. Mixed with water, it forms a strong lye. The light reflecting off the white dunes will blind those who do not protect their eyes with slitted visors or masks. Glassy depressions in the central Sea are said to correspond to former cities of the Suel.|$|R
25|$|Leishmaniasis is {{a disease}} caused by parasites of the Leishmania type. It is spread by the bite of certain types of sandflies. The disease can present in three main ways: {{cutaneous}}, mucocutaneous, or visceral leishmaniasis. The cutaneous form presents with skin ulcers, while the mucocutaneous form presents with ulcers of the skin, <b>mouth,</b> <b>and</b> <b>nose,</b> and the visceral form starts with skin ulcers and then later presents with fever, low red blood cells, and enlarged spleen and liver.|$|E
25|$|In December 2007, The Washington Post {{reported}} {{that there were some}} discrepancies regarding reports about the number of times Zubaydah was waterboarded. According to a previous account by former CIA officer John Kiriakou, Abu Zubaydah broke after just 35seconds of waterboarding, which involved stretching cellophane over his <b>mouth</b> <b>and</b> <b>nose</b> and pouring water on his face to create the sensation of drowning. Kiriakou later admitted that he had no first hand knowledge of the interrogation and accused the CIA of using him to spread disinformation.|$|E
25|$|Vitiligo is a {{long term}} skin {{condition}} characterized by patches of the skin losing their pigment. The patches of skin affected become white and usually have sharp margins. The hair from the skin may also become white. Inside the <b>mouth</b> <b>and</b> <b>nose</b> may also be involved. Typically {{both sides of the}} body are affected. Often the patches begin on areas of skin that are exposed to the sun. It is more noticeable in people with dark skin. Vitiligo may result in psychological stress and those affected may be stigmatized.|$|E

5000|$|CGPD is {{characterized}} by the presence of small, raise, dome-shape papules primarily distributed around the <b>mouth,</b> eyes, <b>and</b> <b>nose.</b> Affected children may also have papules on the ears, eyelids, cheeks, forehead, <b>and</b> <b>nose.</b> [...] CGPD skin lesions affecting areas of the skin other than the face are rare.|$|R
25|$|Pathologist Luca Lalli, from Perugia's {{forensic}} science institute, performed the autopsy on Kercher's body. Her injuries consisted of sixteen bruises and seven cuts. These included several bruises {{and a couple}} of insubstantial cuts on the palm of her hand. Bruises on her nose, nostrils, mouth, and underneath her jaw were compatible with a hand being clamped over her <b>mouth</b> <b>and</b> <b>nose.</b> Lalli's autopsy report was reviewed by three pathologists from Perugia's {{forensic science}} institute who interpreted the injuries, including some to the genital region, as indicating an attempt to immobilize Kercher during sexual violence.|$|E
25|$|Even at Second Ypres, Germany, still {{unsure of}} the weapon's effectiveness, only issued {{breathing}} masks to the engineers handling the gas. At Ypres a Canadian medical officer, {{who was also a}} chemist, quickly identified the gas as chlorine and recommended that the troops urinate on a cloth and hold it over their <b>mouth</b> <b>and</b> <b>nose.</b> The first official equipment issued was similarly crude; a pad of material, usually impregnated with a chemical, tied over the lower face. To protect the eyes from tear gas, soldiers were issued with gas goggles.|$|E
25|$|After a {{successful}} approach, negatively buoyant {{objects such as}} a weight belt are removed. The priority is then to transport the person to the water's edge in preparation for removal from the water. The person is turned on their back with a secure grip used to tow from behind. If the person is cooperative they may be towed {{in a similar fashion}} held at the armpits. If the person is unconscious they may be pulled in a similar fashion held at the chin and cheeks, ensuring that the <b>mouth</b> <b>and</b> <b>nose</b> are well above the water.|$|E
60|$|He landed wet and soppily against Skipper's rain-wet chest, {{his tail}} bobbing frantically against Skipper's {{containing}} arm, his body wriggling, his tongue dabbing madly all over Skipper's chin <b>and</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>and</b> cheeks <b>and</b> <b>nose.</b> <b>And</b> Skipper {{did not know}} that he was himself wet, and {{that he was in the}} first shock of recurrent malaria precipitated by the wet and the excitement. He knew only that the puppy-dog, given him only the previous morning, was safe back in his arms.|$|R
50|$|Michele Cascella {{left school}} early, owing to bad results, {{and began to}} work in his father’s {{chromolithographic}} laboratory in Pescara. He {{was involved in the}} various lithographic processes of transfers and proofs. Meanwhile, Basilio had Michele copy the drawings of the masters (Leonardo, Pisanello, Botticelli, and Donatello) or details of <b>mouths</b> <b>and</b> <b>noses</b> which the father prepared specifically for Michele to practice over and over again. Soon Basilio would send Michele and Tommaso alone, at dawn, to the shores of the Pescara River and the surrounding hills or to the Majella to study the scenery from close by and interpret the language of nature.|$|R
5000|$|This {{video was}} {{exhibited}} in Taura, Japan in 2001. To create the video, Hamilton used a small surveillance camera positioned very near a black-and-white photograph of her son, over which {{she moved her}} hand in a continuous, slow motion. Because of the camera's position, the small lens, {{and the movement of}} her hand, which she calls [...] "hand-seeing," [...] the image in the video is often abstract and out of focus, a blur of <b>mouths</b> <b>and</b> <b>noses.</b> The artist claims that the movement illustrates that [...] "the picture is still...as in not moving...but also as in 'still here'...the way history haunts and inhabits the present." ...|$|R
25|$|A {{full-face}} mask encloses both <b>mouth</b> <b>and</b> <b>nose,</b> {{which reduces}} the risk of the diver losing the air supply compared to a half mask and demand valve. Some models require a bailout block to provide alternative breathing gas supply from the umbilical and bailout cylinder, but are not suitable for accepting an alternative air supply from a rescue diver, while a few models accept a secondary demand valve which can be plugged into an accessory port (Draeger, Apeks and Ocean Reef). The unique Kirby Morgan 48 SuperMask has a removable DV pod which can be unclipped to allow the diver to breathe from a standard scuba demand valve with mouthpiece.|$|E
25|$|During World War II, both Japanese {{military}} personnel, {{especially the}} Kempeitai, {{and the officers}} of the Gestapo, the German secret police, used waterboarding {{as a method of}} torture. During the Japanese occupation of Singapore, the Double Tenth Incident occurred. This included waterboarding, by the method of binding or holding down the victim on his back, placing a cloth over his <b>mouth</b> <b>and</b> <b>nose,</b> and pouring water onto the cloth. In this version, interrogation continued during the torture, with the interrogators beating the victim if he did not reply and the victim swallowing water if he opened his mouth to answer or breathe. When the victim could ingest no more water, the interrogators would beat or jump on his distended stomach.|$|E
25|$|The {{easiest way}} to breathe during breaststroke is to let the head follow the spine. When the swimmer's elbows have reached the line of his eye and have begun to rise, his head starts to lift. If he uses his high elbows as a hinge for the inward sweep {{of his hands and}} forearms, he will create the {{leverage}} he needs to use his abdominal muscles to bring his hips forward. When his hips move forward, his chest, shoulders and upper back will automatically lift up. Breathing is usually done during the beginning of the insweep phase of the arms, and the swimmer breathes in ideally through the mouth. The swimmer breathes out through <b>mouth</b> <b>and</b> <b>nose</b> during the recovery and gliding phase. Breaststroke can be swum faster if submerged completely, but FINA requires the head to break the surface once per cycle except for the first cycle after the start and each turn. Thus, competitive swimmers usually make one underwater pull-out, pushing the hands {{all the way to the}} back after the start and each turn.|$|E
50|$|Mast {{cells are}} present in most tissues {{characteristically}} surrounding blood vessels and nerves, and are especially prominent near the boundaries between {{the outside world and}} the internal milieu, such as the skin, mucosa of the lungs, and digestive tract, as well as the <b>mouth,</b> conjunctiva, <b>and</b> <b>nose.</b>|$|R
