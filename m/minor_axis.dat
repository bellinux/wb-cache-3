40|$|Modeling of multi-dimensional ground {{motions for}} {{earthquake}} response analyses of 3 D structural systems {{require that the}} principal axes of ground motions be accurately determined.

2500|$|A {{polarization}} {{state can}} then be described {{in relation to the}} geometrical parameters of the ellipse, and its [...] "handedness", that is, whether the rotation around the ellipse is clockwise or counter clockwise.

The ellipticity parameter is an alternative parameterization of an ellipse's eccentricity , or the ellipticity angle, χ=arctanb/a=arctan1/ε as is shown in the figure. The angle χ is also significant in that the latitude (angle from the equator) of the polarization state as represented on the Poincaré sphere (see below) is equal to ±2χ.

2500|$|Many {{different}} reference ellipsoids {{have been}} used in the history of geodesy.

Since latitude is defined with respect to an ellipsoid, the position of a given point is different on each ellipsoid: one cannot exactly specify the latitude and longitude of a geographical feature without specifying the ellipsoid used. Many maps maintained by national agencies are based on older ellipsoids, so one must know how the latitude and longitude values are transformed from one ellipsoid to another. GPS handsets include software to carry out datum transformations which link WGS84 to the local reference ellipsoid with its associated grid.|$|E
6000|$|If one {{of these}} {{supposed}} galaxies is so remote that its distance dwarfs our interstellar spaces into points, and therefore makes the dimensions of our whole sidereal system relatively insignificant; does it not inevitably follow that the telescopic power required to resolve this remote galaxy into stars, must be incomparably greater than the telescopic power required to resolve the whole of our own galaxy into stars? Is it not certain that an instrument which can just exhibit with clearness the most distant stars of our own cluster, must be utterly unable to separate {{one of these}} remote clusters into stars? What, then, are we to think when {{we find that the}} same instrument which decomposes hosts of nebulæ into stars, fails to resolve completely our own Milky Way? Take a homely comparison. Suppose a man who was surrounded by a swarm of bees, extending, as they sometimes do, so high in the air as to render some of the individual bees almost invisible, were to declare that a certain spot on the horizon was a swarm of bees; and that he knew it because he could see the bees as separate specks. Incredible as the assertion would be, it would not exceed in incredibility this which we are criticising. Reduce the dimensions to figures, and the absurdity becomes still more palpable. In round numbers, the distance of Sirius from the Earth is half a million times the distance of the Earth from the Sun; and, according to the hypothesis, the distance of a nebula is something like half a million times the distance of Sirius. Now, our own [...] "starry island, or nebula," [...] as Humboldt calls it, [...] "forms a lens-shaped, flattened, and everywhere detached stratum, whose major axis is estimated at seven or eight hundred, and its <b>minor</b> <b>axis</b> at a hundred and fifty times the distance of Sirius from the Earth."[11] And since it is concluded that the Solar System is near the centre of this aggregation, it follows that our distance from the remotest parts of it is some four hundred distances of Sirius. But the stars forming these remotest parts are not individually visible, even through telescopes of the highest power. How, then, can such telescopes make individually visible the stars of a nebula which is half a million times the distance of Sirius? The implication is, that a star rendered invisible by distance becomes visible if taken twelve hundred times further off! Shall we accept this implication? or shall we not rather conclude that the nebulæ are not remote galaxies? Shall we not infer that, be their nature what it may, they must be at least as near to us as the extremities of our own sidereal system? ...|$|E

40|$|An {{observational}} {{evidence is}} presented for the alignment between the cosmic sheet {{and the principal}} axis of the velocity shear field at {{the position of the}} Virgo cluster. The galaxies in and around the Virgo cluster from the Extended Virgo Cluster Catalog recently constructed by Kim et al. are used to determine the direction of the local sheet. The peculiar velocity field reconstructed from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7 is analyzed to estimate the local velocity shear tensor at the Virgo center. Showing first that the <b>minor</b> principal <b>axis</b> of the local velocity shear tensor is almost parallel to the line of sight direction, we detect a clear signal of alignment between the positions of the Virgo satellites and the intermediate principal axis of the local velocity shear projected onto the plane of the sky. Furthermore, the dwarf satellites are found to appear more strongly aligned than the normal counterparts, which is interpreted as indication of the following: (i) The normal and the dwarf satellites fall in the Virgo cluster preferentially along the local filament and the local sheet, respectively. (ii) The local filament is aligned with the <b>minor</b> principal <b>axis</b> of the local velocity shear while the local sheet is in parallel to the plane spanned by the minor and the intermediate principal axes.
