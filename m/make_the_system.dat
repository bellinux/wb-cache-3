25|$|If the {{environment}} is controlled (especially in recirculating systems), corrosion inhibitors can often be added to it. These chemicals form an electrically insulating or chemically impermeable coating on exposed metal surfaces, to suppress electrochemical reactions. Such methods <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>system</b> less sensitive to scratches or defects in the coating, since extra inhibitors can be made available wherever metal becomes exposed. Chemicals that inhibit corrosion include some of the salts in hard water (Roman water systems are famous for their mineral deposits), chromates, phosphates, polyaniline, other conducting polymers and {{a wide range of}} specially-designed chemicals that resemble surfactants (i.e. long-chain organic molecules with ionic end groups).|$|E
25|$|Both {{hard-wired}} (cable) and through-water electronic voice {{communications systems}} {{may be used}} with surface supplied diving. Wired systems are more popular {{as there is a}} physical connection to the diver for gas supply in any case, and adding a cable does not <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>system</b> any different to handle. Wired communications systems are still more reliable and simpler to maintain than through-water systems. The communications equipment is relatively straightforward and may be of the two-wire or four-wire type. Two wire systems use the same wires for surface to diver and diver to surface messages, whereas four wire systems allow the diver's messages and the surface operator's messages to use separate wire pairs.|$|E
25|$|In October 1991, Chrétien first {{gave his}} views {{about how best}} to end the {{recession}} which had begun in 1990. Chrétien argued that the answer was a policy of slow devaluation where the dollar would be allowed to decline against other major world currencies, which would have the effect of both pricing out foreign imports and by giving Canadian firms a competitive advantage in world markets, boost exports. However, Chrétien concluded that his planned export offensive powered by a low dollar would come to nothing if other nations maintained tariffs to keep Canadian goods out of their markets. In order to make his plans to export Canada back into prosperity work, Chrétien decided that the solution was globalization. Besides for globalization, Chrétien also argued to combat the recession, the federal government needed to <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>system</b> of unemployment insurance less generous, and to end the policy of high interest rates maintained by the Bank of Canada governor John Crow to achieve his target of 0% inflation, which Chrétien argued was needlessly crippling the economy.|$|E

The attribute of the PGNMF (i.e. learning parts-based representation) {{and use of the}} local features along with the global features helps to enhance the discrimination capability of the proposed algorithm. The combination of local features with the global features also <b>makes</b> <b>the</b> <b>system</b> capable of identifying the forged regions in the manipulated images.|$|R
25|$|Several {{researchers}} {{proposed a}} solution to these problems by introducing space into the initial model either explicitly or {{in the form of}} a spatial segregation within compartments. Bresch et al. proposed a package model as a solution for the parasite problem. Later on, Szathmáry and Demeter proposed a stochastic corrector machine model. Both compartmentalized systems proved to be robust against parasites. However, package models do not solve the error threshold problem that originally motivated the idea of the hypercycle. A few years later, Maarten Boerlijst and Paulien Hogeweg, and later Nobuto Takeuchi, studied the replicator equations with the use of partial differential equations and cellular automata models, methods that already proved to be successful in other applications. They demonstrated that spatial self-structuring of the system completely solves the problem of global extinction for large systems and, partially, the problem of parasites. The latter was also analysed by Robert May, who noticed that an emergent rotating spiral wave pattern, which was observed during computational simulations performed on cellular automata, proved to be stable and able to survive the invasion of parasites if they appear at some distance from the wave core. Unfortunately, in this case, rotation decelerates as the number of hypercycle members increases, meaning that selection tends toward decreasing the amount of information stored in the hypercycle. Moreover, there is also a problem with adding new information into the system. In order to be preserved, the new information has to appear near to the core of the spiral wave. However, this would <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>system</b> vulnerable to parasites, and, as a consequence, the hypercycle would not be stable. Therefore, stable spiral waves are characterized by once-for-ever selection, which creates the restrictions that, on the one hand, once the information is added to the system, it cannot be easily abandoned; and on the other hand, new information cannot be added.|$|E

40|$|This paper investigates {{determinants}} of individual use of social network sites (SNSs). It introduces a new con-struct, Perceived Sociability of Use (PSOU), {{to explain the}} use of such computer mediated communication ap-plications. Based on a field study of 113 Facebook users it shows that PSOU in the sense of maintaining social contacts is a significant predictor of Perceived Benefits (PB), Perceived Enjoyment (PE), attitude toward use and intention to use. Inspired by Benbasat and Barki, this paper also attempts to answer questions “what <b>makes</b> <b>the</b> <b>system</b> useful”, “what <b>makes</b> <b>the</b> <b>system</b> enjoyable to use ” and “what <b>makes</b> <b>the</b> <b>system</b> sociable to use”. As a consequence it pays special focus on systems characteristics of IT applications as potential predictors of PSOU, PB and PE, introducing seven such designable qualities (user-to-user interactivity, user identifiability, system quality, information quality, usability, user-to-system interactivity, and aesthetics). The results indicate that especially satisfaction with user-to-user interactivity is a significant determinant of PSOU, and that satis-factions with six of these seven designable qualities have significant paths in the proposed nomological network...|$|R
