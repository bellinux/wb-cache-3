40|$|In {{this article}} I reflect on {{how in the}} last two decades my {{personal}} biography - having been confronted with the problem of not getting pregnant when I wanted to and having been able to overcome this problem by means of IVF - and <b>my</b> <b>academic</b> <b>biography</b> have been interwoven. While I acknowledge and show the impact of my personal biography on my academic work (and vice versa), at the same time I contend that its impact should not be overstated. This is related to a number of factors, including the invisibility of my condition, which gave me the freedom to disclose or not disclose it; the fact that I chose not to exchange in-depth experiences with my informants; and the openness of informants to share their experiences. I argue that, based on the different positioning of myself and my informants in two studies (varying in context and temporality), a comparable physical condition does not necessarily have to be experienced as a shared, similar or same experience or situation, either by the informants or by the anthropologist. In both study situations I considered myself rather a ‘partial insider’, even though I once was - physically speaking - a ‘full insider’. At the same time I argue that the implications of similar circumstances for other social scientists, having different histories and experiences, may be quite different. Therefore, I emphasize the importance of a full disclosure of researchers’ relevant biographical experiences, to increase both the credibility and the value of the ethnographic texts anthropologists produce...|$|E

40|$|Identification with {{academics}} is {{the extent}} to which academic pur-suits and outcomes form the basis for global self-evaluation. This is conceptually distinct from, albeit related to, self-esteem and self-con-cept. Whereas academic self-concept is generally defined as the summation of knowledge concerning an individual's academic perfor-mance (such as, I am good at math), academic self-esteem constitutes one facet of overall (global) self-esteem-the evaluation of performance in a specific domain, which is academics (Rosenberg, et al., 1995). In more technical terms, identification with academics {{is the extent}} to which one's self-evaluation in a particular area (academics) affects one's over-all self-evaluation (global self-esteem). Although probably empirically related, academic self-esteem and identification are theoretically orthogonal. One can have high academic self-esteem without that being strongly identified (I am happy with <b>my</b> <b>academic</b> performance, however I stillfeel worthless as a human being). One can have high academic self-esteem while being strongly identified (I am happy with <b>my</b> <b>academic</b> perfonnance; that makes me feel like a worthwhile human being). Likewise, one can have poor academic per-formance without being strongly identified (I am dissatisfied with <b>my</b> <b>academic</b> performance, however I am still a worthwhile human being), or poor academic performance that is strongly identified (I am dissatis-fied with <b>my</b> <b>academic</b> performance; that makes me feel worthless).

40|$|I {{am aware}} that an ever-greater task awaits me, a {{commitment}} I take on willingly, and grounded in <b>my</b> <b>academic</b> credo: integrity, excellence, relevance and freedom. Rites or rituals are Janus-faced. It changes (transforms) and maintains (repeats, reinforces). Rituals are ordered events or processes, laden with regalia {{to distinguish the}} initiate from the rest. In fact, anthropologist Arnold von Gennep described rituals as a three-phased process including separation, transition and incorporation (Manning 2000 : 5, 9). In following von Gennep, tonight marks my incorporation. Scholars subsequent to von Gennep have added a fourth element – departure or exit – to this process (Manning 2000 : 9).
