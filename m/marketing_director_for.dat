25|$|Lucasfilm hired Charles Lippincott as <b>{{marketing}}</b> <b>director</b> <b>for</b> Star Wars. As 20th Century Fox gave {{little support}} for marketing beyond licensing T-shirts and posters, Lippincott {{was forced to}} look elsewhere. He secured deals with Marvel Comics for a comic book adaptation, and with Del Rey Books for a novelization. A fan of science fiction, he used his contacts to promote the film at the San Diego Comic-Con and elsewhere within science fiction fandom. Worried that Star Wars would be beaten out by other summer films, such as Smokey and the Bandit, 20th Century Fox moved the release date to May 25, the Wednesday before Memorial Day. However, fewer than 40 theaters ordered the film to be shown. In response, the studio demanded that theaters order Star Wars if they wanted the eagerly anticipated The Other Side of Midnight {{based on the novel}} by the same name.|$|E

James Kang, <b>marketing</b> <b>director</b> <b>for</b> Warner Music in Asia, noted that Koda's sexy image is popular not only with men but also with women, even [...] "", because she uses her image to [...] "make a feminist statement [...] She's constantly telling women to believe in themselves and do what they want to do".

500|$|Mirroring the {{deliberately}} vague detail {{within the}} novel, the blurb {{on the book}} is unusually written, in {{that it does not}} name the characters or reveal the plot. It was written by a team at Sceptre led by marketing consultant Damian Horner, and has the approval of Cleave, who described it as [...] "genius". Cleave explained: [...] "I think readers are quite smart and don't really need the whole thing spelt out for them in a plot summary. It's nice to let them discover the book at their own speed. And the technique of the book is to release these dirty secrets gradually." [...] The content of the blurb varies between UK and American editions of the novel, but both begin: [...] "We don't want to tell you too much about this book. It is a truly special story and we don't want to spoil it." [...] and end: [...] "Once you have read it, you'll want to tell everyone about it. When you do, please don't tell them what happens either. The magic is in how it unfolds." [...] James Spackman, Sales and <b>Marketing</b> <b>Director</b> <b>for</b> Sceptre, was initially sceptical of the blurb, particularly disliking the use of [...] "we" [...] for the publisher to address the reader directly. Once the book became a best-seller, however, he revised his stance, and now believes that the reason the blurb works is because it makes a virtue of denying the reader information, with an unusual format and [...] "arrestingly direct" [...] tone. The blurb won Sceptre the [...] "Best Blurb" [...] award at the 2010 Book Marketing Society Awards.|$|E

40|$|International audienceManuscript type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: Do the {{presence}} and independence of nominating committees within boards of directors affect the extent of rewards and sanctions provided by the labor <b>market</b> to <b>directors</b> {{with a reputation for}} being active in monitoring management? Research Findings/Insights: Results drawn from a longitudinal sample of directors sitting on the board of 200 public French firms suggest that the stronger a <b>director's</b> reputation <b>for</b> being active in increasing control over management, the larger the number of his/her subsequent appointments to (1) boards with a nominating committee, (2) to boards with a nominating committee which excludes the CEO and (3) to boards with a nominating committee dominated by non-executive directors. In contrast, we found that a director's reputation of being active in increasing control over management does not impact the number of his/her subsequent appointments (1) to boards without a nominating committee, (2) to boards with a nominating committee which includes the CEO and (3) to boards with a nominating committee dominated by executive directors. Theoretical/Academic Implications: This study shows that the outcome of the power struggle between the CEO and incumbent directors during the candidate selection process determines the profile of directors who will ultimately obtain the board appointment. On the one hand, independent nominating committees are likely to reduce the influence of CEOs over the process of a director's appointment, and therefore are likely to increase the recruitment of <b>directors</b> with reputations <b>for</b> being active in exercising control over managers. On the other hand, nonexistence of nominating committees or presence of weak nominating committees {{under the influence of the}} CEO decouple directors' reputations for being active in controlling management from the likelihood of obtaining new appointments. Practitioner/Policy Implications: This study offers insights to policy makers interested in increasing the efficiency of the labor <b>market</b> <b>for</b> <b>directors.</b> More specifically, it highlights the conditions under which directors with a reputation of being active in increasing control over management are likely to be rewarded by the labor <b>market</b> <b>for</b> <b>directors.</b> These conditions include (1) the creation of a nominating committee; (2) exclusion of the CEO from this committee and (3) domination of this committee by outside directors.
