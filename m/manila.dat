40|$|The larva of Spodoptera litura (Fabricius) is a generalist pest in Taiwan. It causes serious {{economic}} losses on several important crops. In the past, using pesticides {{is the main}} way to control this pest. However, pesticides not only cause the pollution in environment but may also injure our health. Recently, sustainable agriculture and organic farming practices promote using natural way to control the pests. There are two advantages, specialization and actively proliferate, gradually parasitoids become more important for pest control. Snellenius <b>manilae</b> (Ashmead) is one kind of parasitical enemies for S. litura. S. <b>manilae</b> is a solitary larval endoparasitoid, and its host range covers only several species of Noctuidae of Lepidoptera. Therefore, this parasitoid becomes a suitable natural enemy to control S. litura. The {{purpose of this study}} was to identify the optimal host instars and growth temperature for S. <b>manilae,</b> knowing the oviposition dynamics of S. <b>manilae,</b> and test the effect of cocoon cold storage. The results indicated that the second instar of S. litura could be the most suitable host instar, and the suitable growth temperature for S. <b>manilae</b> is 25 - 30 ℃. Each female of S. <b>manilae</b> could parasitize 214. 4 offspring averagely, and 64 % of eggs were laid on the first four days after female eclosion. Therefore, it is promising to use S. <b>manilae</b> controlling S. litura population. In addition, no matter S. <b>manilae</b> cocoons were stored in 10 or 15 ℃, it should not be stored over than one week. In the future, study for applying S. <b>manilae</b> in field is necessary. Combine with monitoring of S. litura population, mass releases S. <b>manilae</b> at the right time may able to control S. litura effectively. 斜紋夜蛾(Spodoptera litura (Fabricius)) 幼蟲食性廣，可危害多種作物，並造成相當嚴重的損害，為台灣農業重要害蟲。過去多使用化學藥劑防治，但容易對生態環境及人體造成傷害，近年來提倡有機農業及永續經營之概念，逐漸使用無化學藥劑的防治方法來取代化學防治，其中生物防治中的寄生性天敵由於專一性高、主動擴散能力強，而逐漸受到重視。在數種斜紋夜蛾之寄生蜂當中，馬尼拉小繭蜂(Snellenius <b>manilae</b> (Ashmead)) 為單元性幼蟲內寄生蜂，寄主專一性高，只以幾種夜蛾科幼蟲為寄主，且在台灣分布普遍，適合用來防治斜紋夜蛾。本研究之目的為研究適合馬尼拉小繭蜂發育之斜紋夜蛾齡期及溫度，瞭解馬尼拉小繭蜂之產卵高峰期，以及研究低溫儲藏繭對馬尼拉小繭蜂之影響。由試驗結果發現，以斜紋夜蛾為寄主時，最適合馬尼拉小繭蜂發育的寄主齡期為二齡之斜紋夜蛾，適合的溫度為 25 ～ 30 ℃，馬尼拉小繭蜂雌蜂平均可產下 214. 4 個後代，其中有 64 %的卵會集中在成蜂羽化之後的前四天產下，適合應用於斜紋夜蛾之生物防治。另一方面，無論將馬尼拉小繭蜂之繭低溫儲藏於 10 或 15 ℃，皆不宜儲存超過一週。未來可針對馬尼拉小繭蜂之田間應用方面深入研究，評估應用馬尼拉小繭蜂防治斜紋夜蛾之可行性，並可配合田間斜紋夜蛾之偵測與監控，於適當時機於田間大量釋放馬尼拉小繭蜂，以抑制斜紋夜蛾族群。中文摘要 [...] i 英文摘要 [...] ii 目次 [...] iv 一、前言 [...] 1 二、前人研究 [...] - 2 三、材料與方法 [...] 8 四、結果 [...] 14 五、討論 [...] 20 六、參考文獻 [...] 25 七、圖表 [...] 33 八、附錄 [...] 4...|$|R

The charges arose from incidents that included the Rape of Nanking, the Bataan Death March and <b>Manila</b> massacre.
