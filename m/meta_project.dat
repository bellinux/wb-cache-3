40|$|Linda Florence creates large scale, {{surface pattern}} spatial {{interventions}} which challenge audience expectations and invite personal engagement and response. She {{was commissioned by}} the Sheffield Millenium Gallery to create an installation for their main entrance hall, a busy public space. The <b>project,</b> <b>Meta</b> Table Setting, aimed to focus participants’ attention on overlooked surfaces and environments such as floors, glass walls, hallways and lifts. Florence based her designs on research {{into the history of}} metalwork using the museum’s world-famous collection and archive of Sheffield-made cutlery and tableware. The large-scale floor prints were applied as hand-cut, screen-printed, flocked sandpaper. The normal pattern of visitors’ steps was disrupted – both visually and physically – as they explored the different textures of the sandpaper surfaces with their feet, prompting consideration of the rhythms of their steps, and of the images and designs. A further element of the work, also drawing on cutlery design, was produced in vinyl around the glass sides of the gallery’s lift, alongside scratch-card silver wallpaper depicting outlines of Sheffield metal hallmarks. Visitors were invited to scratch their initials into the hallmarks, creating marks of their own, thereby engaging with and shaping the content of the exhibition...|$|R

40|$|ISIS and META are two {{distributed}} systems projects at Cornell University. The ISIS project, {{has developed a}} new methodology, virtual synchrony, for writing robust distributed software.

40|$|The semi-annual {{status report}} covers {{activities}} of the ISIS project {{during the second half}} of 1989. The project had several independent objectives: (1) At the level of the ISIS Toolkit, ISIS release V 2. 0 was completed, containing bypass communication protocols. Performance of the system is greatly enhanced by this change, but the initial software release is limited in some respects. (2) The <b>Meta</b> <b>project</b> focused on the definition of the Lomita programming language for specifying rules that monitor sensors for conditions of interest and triggering appropriate reactions. This design was completed, and implementation of Lomita is underway on the Meta 2. 0 platform. (3) The Deceit file system effort completed a prototype. It is planned to make Deceit available for use in two hospital information systems. (4) A long-haul communication subsystem project was completed and can be used as part of ISIS. This effort resulted in tools for linking ISIS systems on different LANs together over long-haul communications lines. (5) Magic Lantern, a graphical tool for building application monitoring and control interfaces, is included as part of the general ISIS releases...|$|E
40|$|Like all EU countries, Spain should {{design and}} promote {{a fair and}} {{homogeneous}} generalized road pricing scheme. Tolls should vary according to infrastructure damage, degree of congestion, risk of accident, and environmental nuisances. An initial study (Spanish road pricing model project: META) of interurban transport pricing {{has been carried out}} at national level, considering the valuation of the internal and external costs to define efficient road pricing schemes of different type of roads and appropriate price levels in different interurban road contexts, shifting from a toll for financing infrastructure construction to a toll for recovering social costs. The <b>META</b> <b>project</b> has developed an easy-to-apply pricing methodology, based on a bottom-up approach. The main variable is the AADT -daily flow- applied to accurately estimate generalized road transport costs for each kind of vehicles and each type of road. Based on the current Spanish road network, the META model estimates all social costs: internal costs (fuel, vehicle maintenance, labor, insurance and tax) and external costs (infrastructure, congestion, accident and environmental nuisances). Computed for the 13, 156 Km of interurban highways network, the model calculates the costs for each vehicle type (Car, HGV, LGV and bus) and for each road network section following the interurban road characteristics (AADT, capacity and traffic composition for each section of highway network). The two main results of META model for costs in terms of policy implications suggest to moderate the construction of new interurban road infrastructures in Spain and to analyze congestion before to built new metropolitan roads. If we decide for a road pricing scheme based on the environmental, accident and infrastructure costs, because of the reduced number of the congestion situation, we can use the average external costs that are very similar to the marginal external costs...|$|E
40|$|The {{installation}} and performance, META forms {{a constellation of}} many mobile referential platforms that together address new ways of making and knowing dance practice. In both modalities, I am attempting to weave together my research over the past 3 years and to bring forth concepts as samples of ideas I have both experimented with and experienced. These concepts have been developed in studio-based practice, in documentation processes, in conversations with other dancers, writings on my website, for conference papers, the exegesis, and within the thinking that takes place around, within and through all of these processes. Within the installation, my intention {{is to make the}} investigation of the body visible across the writings on my website (stephhutchison. com), the interactive task-based ‘A Piece for Upper Body and Dots’, and the video screens that sample my Physical Thinking Prototypes (studio-based processes). In addition, the performance of META offers a further portal to the thinking surrounding my research. META mobilizes ideas across video, text, sound and body as I draw upon key Physical Thinking Prototypes that I have established throughout my research. The Physical Thinking Prototypes, WORK, <b>meta,</b> and <b>project</b> poser, all offer a different perspective into my studio-based practice proposing new ways of thinking and moving. On the website under ‘Projects’ in the menu tab, you can find each of these prototypes listed and click through to find more information. Each of the Physical Thinking Prototypes emanated from the production of specific constraints, while working with concepts, that sought to elicit new or novel ways of moving / constructing new bodies in dance. Explanatory notes on META can be found in ‘PhD Research’ from the menu tab on the website. Here I discuss how I have constructed my research into the form of an event. What is fundamental to this investigation is the idea of sampling and creating a space that seeks out the history of the studio-based processes in multiple iterations – text, video and body. I specifically ask how can this multi-disciplinary approach convey key elements of the body-based investigation in writing, edited video, and also within my body...|$|R
