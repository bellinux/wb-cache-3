40|$|Preventing {{overloads}} in {{wind tunnel}} model supports {{is crucial to the}} integrity of the tested system. Results can only be interpreted as valid if the model support, conventionally called a sting remains sufficiently rigid during testing. Modeling and preliminary calculation can only give an estimate of the sting’s behavior under known forces and moments but sometimes unpredictable, aerodynamically caused model behavior can cause large transient overloads that cannot be taken into account at the sting design phase. To ensure <b>model</b> <b>integrity</b> and data validity an analog fast protection circuit was designed and tested. A post-factum analysis was carried out to optimize the overload detection and a short discussion on aeroelastic phenomena is included to show why such a detector has to be very fast. The last refinement of the concept consists in a fast detector coupled with a slightly slower one to differentiate between transient overloads that decay in time and those that are the result of aeroelastic unwanted phenomena. The decision to stop or continue the test is therefore conservatively taken preserving data and <b>model</b> <b>integrity</b> while allowing normal startup loads and transients to manifest...|$|E

Logic {{programming}} (LP) {{is often}} seen {{as a way to}} overcome several shortcomings of the Web Ontology Language (OWL), such as the inability to <b>model</b> <b>integrity</b> constraints or perform closed-world querying.

To help resolving this debate, we investigate the practical use cases which seem to be addressed by logic programming. In fact, many of these requirements have already been addressed outside the Semantic Web. By drawing inspiration from these existing formalisms, we present a novel logic of hybrid MKNF knowledge bases, which seamlessly integrates OWL with LP. We are thus capable of addressing the identified use cases without a radical change in the architecture of the Semantic Web. ...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} a methodology for incremental development of large discrete-event simulation models. The proposed methodology has evolved during a project performed {{in collaboration with}} BT Products. The methodology is based on configuration management to secure simulation <b>model</b> <b>integrity</b> and modularization of the model. Modularization reduces complexity, allows modeling {{at a higher level}} of abstraction and is a prerequisite for both configuration management and incremental development. These are well known methods in the software arena which have been merged and applied to discrete-event simulation. Concurrent development was performed in a heterogeneous environment at geographically separated sites. Due to the incremental approach, results are implemented at successive stages which increases flexibility. Being performed in increments the modeling effort is less susceptible to changes in the studied system thus reducing risk. The lead-time to implementation is reduced since each successive stage is ended with an implementation phase. ...|$|E
40|$|Database {{integrity}} has two complementary components: validity, which {{guarantees that}} all false information is {{excluded from the}} database, and completeness, which guarantees that all true infor-mation {{is included in the}} database. This article describes a uniform <b>model</b> of <b>integrity</b> for relational databases, that considers both validity and completeness. To a large degree, this model subsumes the prevailing <b>model</b> of <b>integrity</b> (i. e., integrity constraints). One of the features of the new model is the determination of the integrity of answers issued by the database system in response to user queries. To users, answers that are accompanied with such detailed certifications of their integrity are more meaningful. First, the model is defined and discussed. Then, a specific mechanism is described that implements this model. With this mechanism, the determination of the integrity of an answer is a process analogous to the determination of the answer itself...|$|R

40|$|When {{modelling}} {{low capacity}} energy {{systems such as}} a small (5 – 150 kWel) organic Rankine cycle unit, the governing dynamics are mainly concentrated in the heat exchangers. As a consequence, accuracy and simulation speed of the higher level system model mainly depend on the heat exchanger model formulation. In particular, the modelling of thermodynamic systems characterized by evaporation or condensation, requires heat exchanger models capable of handling phase transitions. To this aim, the finite volume (FV) and the moving boundary (MB) approaches are the most widely used. The two models are developed and included in the open-source ThermoCycle Modelica library. In this contribution a comparison between the two approaches is performed. Their performance is tested in terms of <b>model</b> <b>integrity</b> and accuracy during transient conditions. Furthermore the models are used to simulate the evaporator of an ORC system and their responses are validated against experimental data collected on an 11 kWel ORC power unit...|$|E

Expression of multiple MMPs was significantly induced in WNV-infected HBCA cells.
