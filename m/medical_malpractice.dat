25|$|<b>Medical</b> <b>malpractice</b> is {{professional}} negligence by act or omission by {{a health care}} provider in which the treatment provided falls below the accepted standard of practice {{in the medical community}} and causes injury or death to the patient, with most cases involving medical error. Claims of <b>medical</b> <b>malpractice,</b> when pursued in US courts, processed as civil torts.

25|$|Doctors' groups, patients, and {{insurance}} companies have criticized <b>medical</b> <b>malpractice</b> litigation as expensive, adversarial, unpredictable, and inefficient.

More recent research from the same source has found that tort costs as a percentage of GDP dropped between 2001 and 2009, and are now at their lowest level since 1984. Jury Verdict Research, a database of plaintiff and defense verdicts, says awards in medical liability cases increased 43 percent in 1999, from $700,000 to $1,000,000. However, more recent research from the U.S. Department of Justice has found that median <b>medical</b> <b>malpractice</b> awards in states range from $109,000 to $195,000.|$|E

40|$|The post-Mao China {{has been}} {{increasingly}} managed mathematically, {{not the least}} in its judicial system. In this paper, I looked {{into some of the}} mathematical indicators used to judge the performance of judges in this nation, and ascertained their effects on the judicial decisions on <b>medical</b> <b>malpractices</b> in Shanghai. The findings of this paper support the previous study that qualitatively identified the judicial responses to such a quantified evaluation system. Underlying the effect of performance indicators is the Chinese judiciary’s bending toward populist pressure. Essentially, therefore, this paper serves to place in perspective the judicial populism well documented in the latest literature on Chinese judiciary. At the same time, however, my study also endorses the theory on courts’ reluctance to exercise discretion in a hierarchical judicial system. Thus, as hinted by the data, the actual behaviors of Chinese judges might be complex under a combination of institutional constraints embodying policy preferences of political leaders as well as structural characteristics of the judiciary. © 2017 Springer Science+Business Media New Yor...|$|R

When severe neurological deficits are alleged to have resulted from professional negligence, relief may be sought through litigation; however, the American tort system often yields inconsistent results or no compensation for patients. We sought to identify a reasonable, objective, and data-based monetary range for a no-fault compensation system with high- and low-financial limits for those with severe neurological deficits. Based on documented life expectancies and attendant care cost studies, the data analysis indicates a no-fault settlement payment ranging from US$ 479, 712. 24 to $ 3, 098, 504. 16, reasonably ensures care and services for life.

So the requirement of techniques to detect the occurrence of cancer nodule in early stage is increasing. A disease that is commonly misdiagnosed is lung cancer.

Earlier diagnosis of Lung Cancer saves enormous lives, failing which may lead to other severe problems causing sudden fatal end. Its cure rate and prognosis depends mainly on the early detection and diagnosis of the disease. This thesis provides a Neural Network and SVM model for early detection of lung cancer.

40|$|Disruptive {{behavior}} among healthcare workers {{can have a}} significant and detrimental effect on the provision of safe and effective patient care.

In order to minimize the adverse effects of disruptive behavior, healthcare organizations need to develop zero tolerance policies, provide education to employees and patients, and implement strict standards to effectively deal with this issue. An increased understanding of the causes and consequences of disruptive behavior will help members of the healthcare team effectively deal with frustrations inherent to the high stress {{environment in which they}} work and help minimize displaced anger. A better understanding of disruptive behavior will also help organizations and medical schools provide education and training that can lessen the likelihood of disruptive behavior and improve the overall effectiveness of the healthcare team...|$|R
