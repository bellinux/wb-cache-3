5|$|Since the Confederacy was founded, {{among other}} things, on states' rights, one {{important}} factor in Davis's choice of cabinet members was representation from the various states. He depended partly upon recommendations from congressmen and other prominent people. This helped maintain good relations between the executive and legislative branches. This also led to complaints as <b>more</b> <b>states</b> joined the Confederacy, however, because there were <b>more</b> <b>states</b> than cabinet positions.|$|E
50|$|The {{minimum number}} of state {{variables}} required to describe a system equals {{the order of the}} differential equation; <b>more</b> <b>state</b> variables than the minimum can be defined.

5|$|By the 1890s, {{support for}} the {{introduction}} of direct election for the Senate had substantially increased, and reformers worked on two fronts. On the first front, the Populist Party incorporated the direct election of senators into its Omaha Platform, adopted in 1892. In 1908, Oregon passed the first law that based the selection of U.S. senators on a popular vote. Oregon was soon followed by Nebraska. Proponents for popular election noted that ten states already had non-binding primaries for Senate candidates, in which the candidates would be voted on by the public, effectively serving as advisory referenda instructing state legislatures how to vote; reformers campaigned for <b>more</b> <b>states</b> to introduce a similar method.|$|E
5|$|The Clause {{has led to}} {{very little}} litigation, {{in part because of}} its overlap (as a {{practical}} matter) with the venue provision of Article Three and Rule 18 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. Further, {{with the exception of the}} District of Wyoming, which includes the portions of Yellowstone National Park in Idaho and Montana, no federal judicial district includes the territory of two or <b>more</b> <b>states</b> (although the short-lived District of Potomac once did).|$|E
5|$|The NCTA {{negotiated}} with Virginia, Maryland and the District of Columbia {{for the formation}} of a new regional entity. The authority was created by an interstate compact, a special type of contract or agreement between one or <b>more</b> <b>states.</b> Pursuant to the Compact Clause of the U.S. Constitution, any such compact must be approved by Congress. After the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority Compact was approved by the Maryland General Assembly in 1965, and passed through the Virginia General Assembly and Congress in 1966, WMATA was founded on February 20, 1967.|$|E

5|$|As Boykett argues, any {{one-dimensional}} reversible {{cellular automaton}} {{is equivalent to}} an automaton in rectangular form, in which the cells are offset a half unit at each time step, and in which both the forward and reverse evolution of the automaton have neighborhoods with just two cells, the cells a half unit away in each direction. If a reversible automaton has neighborhoods larger than two cells, it can be simulated by a reversible automaton with smaller neighborhoods and <b>more</b> <b>states</b> per cell, in which each cell of the simulating automaton simulates a contiguous block of cells in the simulated automaton. The two axioms of a semicentral bigroupoid are exactly the conditions required on the forward and reverse transition functions of these two-cell neighborhoods to be the reverses of each other. That is, every semicentral bigroupoid defines a reversible cellular automaton in rectangular form, in which the transition function of the automaton uses the operation to combine the two cells of its neighborhood, and in which the operation similarly defines the reverse dynamics of the automaton. Every one-dimensional reversible cellular automaton is equivalent to one in this form.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the first}} event, Packer wanted {{to expand the}} race to take in <b>more</b> <b>states.</b> The 1990 race started on May 4 in Wilmington in Delaware, a state which Trump {{considered}} important for his three casinos in Atlantic City, and also visited Baltimore, after Trump agreed to local racecourse owner Joe De Francis's condition that he moor his yacht the Trump Princess in Baltimore Harbor during the race. It finished in Boston on May 13. Entrants in 1990 included 1989 winner Dag Otto Lauritzen, Greg LeMond, who was coming back from a virus and food poisoning, Steve Bauer, who had finished second in Paris-Roubaix that year, Andrew Hampsten, Davis Phinney, Ekimov, {{in his first year}} as a professional, and East German rider Olaf Ludwig. The race was won by Mexican rider Raúl Alcalá of the PDM-Concorde team.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} become {{recognised}} fully by the American Kennel Club, they must first compete in a Miscellaneous Class. The requirements to compete in that class are to demonstrate a following by having a minimum of 100 active members in a national breed club, a population of 300 to 400 dogs, with third generation pedigrees and for all dogs in those pedigrees {{to be of the}} same breed, a distribution across twenty or <b>more</b> <b>states,</b> and the breed standard must be reviewed and approved by the AKC. Currently there are five dogs in the AKC's Miscellaneous Class which are Dogue de Bordeaux, Redbone Coonhound, Irish Red and White Setter, Norwegian Buhund and Pyrenean Shepherd. Typical stays in that class are between one and three years, and the national club of the breed must have held seminars, shows and judges workshops prior to being fully recognised.|$|E

5|$|Through this process, Patel {{obtained}} {{the unification of}} 222 states in the Kathiawar peninsula of his native Gujarat into the princely union of Saurashtra in January 1948, with six <b>more</b> <b>states</b> joining the union the following year. Madhya Bharat emerged on 28 May 1948 from a union of Gwalior, Indore and eighteen smaller states. In Punjab, the Patiala and East Punjab States Union was formed on 15 July 1948 from Patiala, Kapurthala, Jind, Nabha, Faridkot, Malerkotla, Nalargarh, and Kalsia. The United State of Rajasthan was formed {{as the result of}} a series of mergers, the last of which was completed on 15 May 1949. Travancore and Cochin were merged in the middle of 1949 to form the princely union of Travancore-Cochin. The only princely states which signed neither Covenants of Merger nor Merger Agreements were Kashmir, Mysore and Hyderabad.|$|E
