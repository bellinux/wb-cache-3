40|$|The study {{describes}} significant {{outcomes of}} the Metrology for Meteorology' project, MeteoMet, which {{is an attempt to}} bridge the meteorological and metrological communities. The concept of traceability, an idea used in both fields but with a subtle difference in meaning, {{is at the heart of}} the project. For meteorology, a traceable measurement is the one that can be traced back to a particular instrument, time and location. From a <b>metrological</b> perspective, <b>traceability</b> further implies that the measurement can be traced back to a primary realization of the quantity being measured in terms of the base units of the International System of Units, the SI. These two perspectives reflect long-standing differences in culture and practice and this project - and this study - represents only the first step towards better communication between the two communities. The 3 year MeteoMet project was funded by the European Metrology Research Program (EMRP) and involved 18 European National Metrological Institutes, 3 universities and 35 collaborating stakeholders including national meteorology organizations, research institutes, universities, associations and instrument companies. The project brought a metrological perspective to several long-standing measurement problems in meteorology and climatology, varying from conventional ground-based measurements to those made in the upper atmosphere. It included development and testing of novel instrumentation as well as improved calibration procedures and facilities, instrument intercomparison under realistic conditions and best practice dissemination.

For each gender, age-standardised (world standard population) {{mortality rates}} were computed by the direct method, and joinpoint analysis was used to identify significant changes in rates. A favourable pattern in colorectal cancer mortality for both genders was observed in most European countries from the 1990 s onwards. Colorectal cancer mortality rates were still in the upward direction in some Eastern European countries, as well as in some Mediterranean countries. Mortality rates tended to converge at around 20 / 100000 in men and around 11 / 100000 in women. This converging pattern is even clearer when colorectal mortality rates are examined in three broad European regions. Similar mortality rates over recent calendar years have been reached by countries where mortality has been decreasing in recent decades and in those countries (mainly Eastern European and Mediterranean countries) which have experienced a recent levelling-off and decrease. If recent trends are maintained, colorectal cancer mortality is likely to decline further in Europe in the current decade.

O. info:eu-repo/semantics/article article 2009 Medical Physics 3693891 - 3896 <![CDATA[PURPOSE: A helical tomotherapy accelerator presents a dosimetric challenge because, to this day, there is no internationally accepted protocol for the determination of the absolute dose. Because of this reality, we investigated the different alternatives for characterizing and measuring the absolute dose of such an accelerator. We tested several dosimetric techniques with various <b>metrological</b> <b>traceabilities</b> as well as using a number of phantoms in static and helical modes. METHODS: Firstly, the relationship between the reading of ionization chambers and the absorbed dose is dependent on the beam quality value of the photon beam. For high energy photons, the beam quality is specified by the tissue phantom ratio (TPR 20, 10) and it is therefore necessary to know the TPR 20, 10 to calculate the dose delivered by a given accelerator. This parameter is obtained through the ratio of the absorbed dose at 20 and 10 cm depths in water and was measured in the particular conditions of the tomotherapy accelerator. Afterward, measurements were performed using the ionization chamber (model A 1 SL) delivered as a reference instrument by the vendor. This chamber is traceable in absorbed dose to water in a Co- 60 beam to a water calorimeter of the American metrology institute (NIST). Similarly, in Switzerland, each radiotherapy department is directly traceable to the Swiss metrology institute (METAS) in absorbed dose to water based on a water calorimeter. For our research, this traceability was obtained by using an ionization chamber traceable to METAS (model NE 2611 A), which is the secondary standard of our institute. Furthermore, in order to have another fully independent measurement method, we determined the dose using alanine dosimeters provided by and traceable to the British metrology institute (NPL); they are calibrated in absorbed dose to water using a graphite calorimeter. And finally, we wanted to take into account the type of chamber routinely used in clinical practice and therefore measured the dose using a Farmer-type instrument (model NE 2571) as well. RESULTS: We found the tomotherapy TPR 20, 10 value to be around 0. 629, which is close to a 4 MV conventional linear accelerator value. During static irradiation, the secondary standard and the alanine dosimeters were compatible within 0. 5 %. The A 1 SL relative deviation to the secondary standard was 1. 2 % and the NE 2571 relative deviation to the secondary standard was - 1. 7 %. The measurement in dynamic helical mode found the different dosimeters compatible within 1. 4 % and the alanine dosimeters and the secondary standard were even found under 0. 2 %. CONCLUSIONS: We found that the different methods are all within uncertainties as well as globally coherent, and the specific limitations of the various dosimeters are discussed in order to help the medical physicist design an independent reference system. We demonstrated that, taking into account the particular reference conditions, one can use an ionization chamber calibrated for conventional linear accelerators to assert the absolute dose delivered by a tomotherapy accelerator...|$|R

It is associated with certified reference material (CRM) and reference method (RMet). When it is used in the supply chain by diagnostic kit manufacturers, it ensures accuracy of the results yielded by laboratories. Objective: This study shows the availability of information on <b>metrological</b> <b>traceability</b> provided by diagnostic kit manufacturers. Method: It was done with the information obtained in kits of glucose, urea, creatinine, uric acid and cholesterol participants in a proficiency testing program throughout 2012 and 2013. Results and conclusion: In the research, 18 producers of reference materials (RMs) and 204 measurands available for laboratory medicine were found. In the study of <b>metrological</b> <b>traceability,</b> the preferential use of CRM was demonstrated by kit manufacturers (glucose 60 %, urea 69 %, creatinine 60 %, uric acid 50 %, and cholesterol 43 %).

40|$|<b>Metrological</b> <b>traceability</b> of {{measurement}} results {{is a key}} requirement for the comparability of such data {{in time and space}} and with legal or product specifications. Similarly, traceability of the certified values of a certified reference material is a prerequisite for its usefulness. Consequently, the statement on <b>metrological</b> <b>traceability</b> of the certified value of the specified property is a requirement of the ISO Guide series on Reference Materials. The establishment of the traceability of a value assigned to a property of a reference material to a stated reference is pivotal to the use of this material. <b>Metrological</b> <b>traceability</b> is related to a combination of four attributes which are assigned to a clearly identified matrix: description of the property, description of the quantity/kind-of-quantity, a number with its corresponding uncertainty and the measurement unit. The first two items define the identity of the measurand, whereas the latter two describe value that is assigned to this measurand. Therefore, the concept of traceability rests on two anchor points, namely identity and quantity value. The identity of a measurand van be defined by its structure alone or by an operational/procedural definition, the quantity value of the measurand can refer to the SI, or to an artefact, if standards of arbitrary values have been used for the calibration of equipment (e. g. WHO standards; international units etc.). The presented approach splits traceability statements of certified reference materials into a description of the identity of the measurand an the quantity value and provided a solution to overcome the conflict whether a measurement result should be declared as traceable to the SI or traceable to a method.

In particular, the application of metrological concepts to the determination of organic pollutants in different matrices is a challenge. In fact, it deals with {{an enormous amount of}} different compounds, which are present at various concentrations, often at trace level, and can interact with the matrix constituents. For such kinds of measurements, the achievement of <b>metrological</b> <b>traceability</b> is a non trivial aspect and one of the tasks to be carried out is the evaluation of measurement uncertainty taking into consideration all relevant contributions. At I. N. Ri. M. a research activity dealing with organic analysis has started. The first analytes taken into account are polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). The choice is due to their relevance as environmental pollutants, a reason that led to their inclusion among the twelve classes of Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs), selected by United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) under the Stockholm Convention on POPs in 1997. Traceable PCBs standards of different congeners in iso-octane are prepared by accurate weighing by diluting certified reference materials. A correct uncertainty budget is developed taking into account all the possible uncertainty sources, deriving both from the reference materials and from the weighing process. The PCBs are determined by a gas-chromatograph coupled with a single quadrupole mass spectrometer (GC-MS). The interpretation of mass spectra obtained in scan mode allows the identification of the different congeners. GC-MS is calibrated using the traceable standard solutions prepared by weighing. The PCBs congeners amount in unknown samples is determined by comparing the ion current generated by each congener with respect to the calibration curve, assuring <b>metrological</b> <b>traceability</b> of results.

Thus, food safety has become a main concern of many countries for protection of their population's health. Analytical chemical measurements are increasingly important to ensure consumer protection, particularly in the field of antibiotic residues. International comparability and reliability of measurement results can be achieved by establishing and demonstrating the <b>metrological</b> <b>traceability</b> of those results to the International System of Units (SI). To ensure the <b>metrological</b> <b>traceability</b> of measurement results, reference methods and certified reference materials (CRMs) are needed. Nitrofuran antibiotic drugs used for the treatment of bacterial and protozoan infections in animals were studied in this thesis. A high accuracy reference method and an appropriate CRM for the detection of nitrofurans in prawns have been developed. A reference method for the measurement of mass fractions of nitrofuran metabolites 3 -amino- 5 -methyl-morpholino- 2 -oxazolidinone (AMOZ), 3 -amino- 2 -oxazolidinone (AOZ), semicarbazide (SEM) and 1 -aminohydantoin (AHD) has been developed utilising an exact matching double isotope dilution mass spectrometry (IDMS) method. A feasibility study on a fortified reference material was carried out by preparing fortified samples containing the four nitrofuran metabolites. The stability testing results showed that the analytes in the freeze-dried matrix were more stable than in the wet form. Freeze-dried certified reference materials of nitrofurans in prawns have been produced; an incurred AOZ (CRM_P 1) and incurred AOZ and fortified SEM (CRM_P 2). The reference method developed was applied for the characterisation of certified reference materials for homogeneity, stability study and certification. The prepared certified reference materials were found to be homogeneous and remained stable under normal transport conditions. The measurement uncertainty of the measurement results obtained by the reference method developed was determined by thoroughly examining all possible sources of potential bias and precision effects. An initial measurement uncertainty for certified values of AOZ in both materials has also been estimated. <b>Metrological</b> <b>traceability</b> of measurement results obtained by the developed reference method and the reference value of the prepared certified reference materials has been established through the use of the traceable primary ratio method of exact matching double IDMS, the use of certified nitrofuran metabolite standards, and gravimetric preparation of samples...|$|E
