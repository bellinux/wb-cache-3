5|$|Lissitzky, {{aware of}} severe <b>mismatch</b> <b>between</b> his {{ideas and the}} {{existing}} urban landscape, experimented with different configurations of the horizontal surface and height-to-width ratios so that the structure appeared balanced visually ("spatial balance is in the contrast of vertical and horizontal tensions"). The raised platform was shaped {{in a way that}} each of its four facets looked distinctly different. Each tower faced the Kremlin with the same facet, providing a pointing arrow to pedestrians on the streets. All eight buildings were planned identically, so Lissitzky proposed color-coding them for easier orientation.|$|E
5|$|The {{organisation}} {{of society}} depends on means of production. Literally, those things, like land, {{natural resources and}} technology, necessary {{for the production of}} material goods and the relations of production. In other words, the social relationships people enter into as they acquire and use the means of production. Together, these compose the mode of production and Marx distinguished historical eras in terms of distinct modes of production. Marx differentiated between base and superstructure, with the base (or substructure) referring to the economic system and superstructure, to the cultural and political system. Marx regarded this <b>mismatch</b> <b>between</b> (economic) base and (social) superstructure as a major source of social disruption and conflict.|$|E

5|$|In April 1975, {{a single}} Jaguar {{was used to}} test the aircraft's rough {{airstrip}} capacity, by landing and taking off multiple times from the M55 motorway, the final test flight was conducted with a full weapons load; the ability was never used in service but was considered useful as improvised runways might be the only runways left available in a large scale European conflict. In a high intensity European war, the role of the Jaguar was to support land forces on the Continent in resisting a Soviet assault on Western Europe, striking targets beyond the forward edge of the battlefield should a conflict escalate. The apparent <b>mismatch</b> <b>between</b> aircraft numbers and nuclear bombs was a consequence of RAF staff planners concluding that there would be one third attrition of Jaguars in an early conventional phase, leaving the survivors numerically strong enough to deliver the entire allocated stockpile of 56 nuclear bombs.|$|E
5|$|The {{pattern of}} 105.5, 8, 121.5 and 8 years {{is not the}} only pattern that is {{possible}} within the 243-year cycle, because of the slight <b>mismatch</b> <b>between</b> the times when the Earth and Venus arrive at the point of conjunction. Prior to 1518, the pattern of transits was 8, 113.5 and 121.5 years, and the eight inter-transit gaps before the AD 546 transit were 121.5 years apart. The current pattern will continue until 2846, when it will be replaced by a pattern of 105.5, 129.5 and 8 years. Thus, the 243-year cycle is relatively stable, but the number of transits and their timing within the cycle will vary over time. Since the 243:395 Earth:Venus commensurability is only approximate, there are different sequences of transits occurring 243 years apart, each extending for several thousand years, which are eventually replaced by other sequences. For instance, there is a series which ended in 541 BC, and the series which includes 2117 only started in AD 1631.|$|E
5|$|The record {{football}} {{attendance at}} the stadium not involving its host team Manchester City is 43,878, which was set at the 2008 UEFA Cup Final game between Zenit Saint Petersburg and Rangers on 14 May 2008. As is customary for such games, the then 47,715 maximum physical capacity of the stadium had been reduced by UEFA to around 44,000 for this final. However, neither limit {{would have been able}} to accommodate the vast number of supporters of the Scottish club, estimated to be in excess of 130,000, that travelled down from Glasgow to Manchester on the day of the game, despite the club's official ticket allocation being just 13,000 and police requests for fans without tickets to stay home. This order of magnitude <b>mismatch</b> <b>between</b> the numbers of traveling fans and those holding tickets ultimately led to a serious public disorder incident in the centre of the city now inextricably associated with this final, despite the fact that the 44,000 or so crowd who watched the game inside the stadium were perfectly well-behaved.|$|E

25|$|There is {{therefore}} a physical requirement for a controlling agency, the transmission system operator, to coordinate the dispatch of generating units to meet the expected demand of the system across the transmission grid. If there is a <b>mismatch</b> <b>between</b> supply and demand the generators speed up or slow down causing the system frequency (either 50 or 60 hertz) to increase or decrease.

30|$|The second {{approach}} {{is almost the}} same as that for the environment identification in Section 3.2. 1. In this approach, estimated reverberation and reverberant speech are directly used as inputs of the reverberation-aware (DAE) as shown in Fig. 4. The one-step environment-dependent DAE can estimate and suppress the environment-dependent reverberation automatically. So, it is expected to reduce the influence of <b>mismatches</b> <b>between</b> training and test environments. On the other hand, the conventional DAE does not use environment-dependent reverberation, so its performance will not be robust for <b>mismatches</b> <b>between</b> training and test conditions.|$|R

Our solution addresses both signature and behaviour level and covers both asynchronous and syn-chronous communication between components.

In this case, though, the circuit will be susceptible to input bias current drift because of the <b>mismatch</b> <b>between</b> the impedances driving the V+ and V− op amp inputs.|$|E
