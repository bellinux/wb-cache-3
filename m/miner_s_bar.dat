At the fixed w/s ratio of 0. 4 the mechanical strength of the system at early ages (1 - 28 days) increased with higher C(4) A(3) (<b>S)</b> over <b>bar</b> content. However, depending on the curing conditions, compositions containing more than 50 % C(4) A(3) (<b>S)</b> over <b>bar</b> showed expansion, cracking and loss of strength at later ages, due to the insufficient water used. Moreover compositions with more than 20 % C(4) A(3) (<b>S)</b> over <b>bar</b> and increasing C(4) A(3) (<b>S)</b> over <b>bar</b> content gave progressively lower mechanical strength, when hydrated with the fixed water/reactants (C(4) A(3) (<b>S)</b> over <b>bar</b> + C (<b>S)</b> over <b>bar)</b> ratio of 0. 86, i. e. 10 % more than the stoichiometric water requirement.

The FRC is a compact toroid with negligible toroidal field in which the plasma is confined by a poloidal magnetic field associated with toroidal diamagnetic current. Although many MHD modes are predicted to be unstable, FRCs have been produced successfully by several formation techniques and show surprising macroscopic resilience. In order to understand this discrepancy, we have developed a new 3 D nonlinear hybrid code (kinetic ions and fluid electrons), M 3 D-B, which is used to study the role of kinetic effects on the n = 1 tilt and higher n modes in the FRC. Our simulations show that there is a reduction in the tilt mode growth rate in the kinetic regime, but no absolute stabilization has been found for <b>s</b> <b>bar</b> less than or approximately equal to 1, where <b>s</b> <b>bar</b> is the approximate number of ion gyroradii between the field null and the separatrix.

As simultaneous electroencephalography (EEG) is often unavailable, decoding of potentially confounding sleep patterns from rs-fMRI itself might be useful and improve data interpretation. Linear support vector machine classifiers were trained on combined rs-fMRI/EEG recordings from 25 subjects to separate wakefulness (S 0) from non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep stages 1 (S 1), 2 (S 2), slow wave sleep (SW) and all three sleep stages combined (SX). Classifier performance was quantified by a leave-one-subject-out cross-validation (LOSO-CV) and on an independent validation dataset comprising 19 subjects. Results demonstrated excellent performance with areas under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUCs) close to 1. 0 for the discrimination of sleep from wakefulness (<b>S</b> 0 vertical <b>bar</b> SX), <b>S</b> 0 vertical <b>bar</b> <b>S</b> 1, <b>S</b> 0 vertical <b>bar</b> <b>S</b> 2 and S 0 |SW, and good to excellent performance for the classification between sleep stages (<b>S</b> 1 vertical <b>bar</b> <b>S</b> 2 : similar to 0. 9; <b>S</b> 1 vertical <b>bar</b> SW:similar to 1. 0; <b>S</b> 2 vertical <b>bar</b> SW:similar to 0. 8). Application windows of fMRI data from about 70 s were found as minimum to provide reliable classifications. Discrimination patterns pointed to subcortical-cortical connectivity and within-occipital lobe reorganization of connectivity as strongest carriers of discriminative information. In conclusion, we report that functional connectivity analysis allows valid classification of NREM sleep stages. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|R
