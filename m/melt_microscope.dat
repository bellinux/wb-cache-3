40|$|Abstract. To {{study the}} {{influence}} of fining temperature on glass qualities, different fining temperatures from 1400 ℃ to 1500 ℃ were used to prepare a series soda-lime-silica glass with identical chemical compositions. Infrared spectroscopy {{was used to determine}} the water content of glass, general analyzer of melt physical properties was used to study the viscosity and surface tension change of glass <b>melt,</b> <b>microscope</b> was carried out find glass bubbles, wet chemical analyses were used to determine the F...|$|E
50|$|Takagi first {{observed}} {{melting point}} depression of {{several types of}} metal nanoparticles in 1954. A variable intensity electron beam from a transmission electron <b>microscope</b> <b>melted</b> metal nanoparticles in early experiments. Diffraction patterns changed from characteristic crystalline patterns to liquid patterns as the small particles melted, allowing Takagi to estimate the melting temperature from the electron beam energy.|$|R
40|$|General. All {{reactions}} {{were carried out}} in distilled anhydrous solvents under a nitrogen atmosphere using oven-dried glassware. 1 H-NMR and 13 C-NMR spectra were run on a Varian Gemini 200 or a Varian VXR 300 spectrometer. Melting points (uncorrected) were determined using a Koffler <b>melting</b> point <b>microscope.</b> Several compounds displayed liquid crystalline behaviour, in these cases no melting points are reported. THF was purified over basic Al 2 O 3, activity 1 (Merck). Elemental analyses {{was carried out by}} Mr. J. Hommes in the Analytical Department of the University of Groningen. D(+) -glucose and PLC plates (20 ⋅ 20 cm, Silicagel 60 F 254, 2 mm) were purchased from Merck. Oleyl alcohol (75 - 80 % cis), oleic anhydride (100 % cis), 1, 8 -diamino- 3, 6 -dioxaoctane, cellulose powder from Spruce and D(+) -mannose were obtained from Fluka. NaBH 3 CN, 10 % Pd/C and 1, 6 -diaminohexane were from Acros. For the synthesis of the bolaamphiphiles an autoclave was used. Mass spectra were obtained on a NERMAG R 3010 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer equipped with an in-house-built atmospheric pressure ionisation source and ionspray interface...|$|R
40|$|Submicron-sized {{crystallites}} of lead, tin, indium and bismuth were melted in situ in {{the modified}} specimen chamber of a Siemens transmission e lectron <b>microscope.</b> <b>Melting</b> point and size determinations were made {{directly from the}} dark field images of the crystallites. Particles exhibited melting points that decreased with decreasing particle size. A near-linear relationship was observed for the melting point {{as a function of}} the reciprocal of the radius. Thermodynamnic expressions based on the significant contributions of the surface energy to the free energy of the system also suggest a linear relation. Other factors, such as shape and surface contamination, were also observed to affect the size-dependent melting of particles. Crystallites of extended platelet shape did not exhibit a significant depression in melting point. Elevated residual gas pressures were found to lessen the melting point depression of spherical particles...|$|R
40|$|ZnO {{nanorods}} with Sn {{core regions}} grown by a thermal evaporation–deposition method from {{a mixture of}} SnO_ 2 and ZnS powders as precursors, are used to study the behaviour of liquid metal in the nanotubes' core regions {{and the formation of}} liquid metal nanodrops at the tube ends by in situ TEM experiments. The compositions of the core materials and of the nanodrops were assessed by employing HAADF-STEM imaging and spatially resolved EDXS measurements. By applying variable thermal load through changing the electron-beam flux of the electron <b>microscope,</b> <b>melting</b> of the metallic core can be induced and the behaviour of the liquid metal of the nanorods can be monitored locally. Within the nanorod core, melting and reversible thermal expansion and contraction of Sn core material is reproducibly observed. For nanotubes with core material near-tip regions, a nanodrop emerges from the tip upon melting the core material, followed by reabsorption of the melt into the core and re-solidification upon decreasing the heat load, being reminiscent of a 'soldering nanorod'. The radius of the liquid nanodrop can reach a few tens of nanometres, containing a total volume of 10 ^ 20 up to 10 ^ 18 l of liquid Sn. In situ TEM confirms that the radius of the nanodrop can be controlled via the thermal load: it increases with increasing temperature and decreases with decreasing temperature. In addition, some phenomena related to structure modifications during extended electron-beam exposure are also described...|$|R
