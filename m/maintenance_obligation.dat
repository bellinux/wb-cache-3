50|$|The Reformation had {{the effect}} that the {{territory}} of the Margrave of Baden-Durlach only Lutheran pastors were permitted. The Jus patronatus was, however, in many case owned by Catholic monasteries or religious orders, which would now have to pay for a Lutheran pastor. This, of course, caused resistance. The Peace of Augsburg had clear rules for this kind of situation. Religious institutions were allowed to keep their possessions in Protestant areas, but they indeed had to for the evangelical pastor. Based on the territorial claims of the House of Habsburg on the Upper Baden lordships mentioned above, the prelates held that the <b>maintenance</b> <b>obligation</b> did not apply to them, and the intended to keep the tithes. Charles then seized their estates and used them to fund the maintenance of churches and pastors. Johann Ulrich Zasius mediated and reached a compromise: the confiscated estates were returned to their owners, but Baden-Durlach was allowed to retain the funds necessary to pay the pastors. However, the Austrian authorities in Innsbruck did not accept this compromise and the confrontation escalated. After some prelates made separate agreements with Baden-Durlach, the negotiations were resumed and led to the treaty of Neuenburg am Rhein of 24 April 1561, with essentially the same result as the earlier agreement.|$|E

Prior Work: This is the reason why we have chosen this topic and the analysis of the typology to which such an obligation adapts and, of course, the correlative right to which it gives birth. Approach: In our current system of law there are provided different forms of exercising this obligation, preserving, improving, but also innovating, in some aspects, the previous regulation. Specifically, we will relate in this study to a brief analysis of all types of maintenance obligations, generated by two distinct sources: the law and the will of the parties (contract), in this case we are speaking of an obligation based on the law or a contractual obligation. The angle from which we are analyzing this type of obligational relationship between the maintenance creditor and the maintenance debtor also allows us to recall both the passive or active patrimonial side, and also the analysis of the legal characters that it presupposes each of the two above-mentioned generic types of maintenance obligations. Value: Starting from the conceptualization of the <b>maintenance</b> <b>obligation,</b> the present study will be oriented towards the analysis in the current legal context of the doctrinal points of view expressed in the specialized literature, using as a method the documentary research, the interpretative method and the comparative method...|$|E
