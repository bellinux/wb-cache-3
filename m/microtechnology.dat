2500|$|Despite its {{inherent}} difficulties {{to secure}} research funds in {{a developing country}} where private sponsorship barely accounts for 1.1% of the national spending on science, a new institutional mission in 2005 made social and scientific research in Mexico's strategic areas one of its top priorities for the next decade. As a result, new corporate endowments and funds were committed, new research programs were created (including the first research program financed by Google in Latin America) and important labs and infrastructure have been built, such as the [...] Femsa Biotechnology Center, the Water Center for Latin America and the Caribbean (financed by the Inter-American Development Bank and the Femsa Foundation), the Motorola Research and Development Center on Home & Networks Mobility, its [...] Center for Advanced Design at the Guadalajara Campus and, {{in association with the}} Mainz Institute of <b>Microtechnology</b> of Germany (IMM), the first center of chemical micro process engineering in Latin America.|$|E
2500|$|One {{nanometer}} (nm) is one billionth, or 10−9, of a meter. By comparison, typical carbon-carbon bond lengths, or {{the spacing}} between these atoms in a molecule, {{are in the}} range , and a DNA double-helix has a diameter around 2nm. On the other hand, the smallest cellular life-forms, the bacteria of the genus Mycoplasma, are around 200nm in length. By convention, nanotechnology is taken as the scale range [...] following the definition used by the National Nanotechnology Initiative in the US. The lower limit is set by the size of atoms (hydrogen has the smallest atoms, which are approximately a quarter of a nm diameter) since nanotechnology must build its devices from atoms and molecules. The upper limit is more or less arbitrary but is around the size below which [...] phenomena not observed in larger structures start to become apparent and can be made use of in the nano device. These new phenomena make nanotechnology distinct from devices which are merely miniaturised versions of an equivalent macroscopic device; such devices are on a larger scale and come under the description of <b>microtechnology.</b>|$|E

40|$|Nano- and <b>microtechnologies</b> are {{receiving}} increased {{attention in the}} field of topical vaccine delivery. Aónumber of nanoparticles varying in composition, size, shape, and surface properties have been studied for vaccine delivery. The use of nanoparticles in vaccine formulations can improve antigen stability, induce immunogenicity, enhance targeted delivery, and provide slow release of antigen. Their role either as a delivery system to enhance antigen processing and/or as an immunostimulant adjuvant to activate or enhance immunity is the focus of this chapter. The transfollicular route is also highlighted as a delivery pathway for nanoparticles into the skin. <b>Microtechnologies</b> that have been used in vaccine development are also discussed. In summary, nano- and <b>microtechnologies</b> are merging with vaccine technologies for improved delivery, adjuvant effects, and improved release profiles that can be effectively used in topical applications.

40|$|The {{guidance}} of axons to their proper targets {{is not only}} a crucial event in neurodevelopment, but also a potential therapeutic target for neural repair. Axon guidance is mediated by various chemo- and haptotactic cues, as well as the mechanical interactions between the cytoskeleton and the extra-cellular matrix. Axonal growth cones, dynamic ends of growing axons, convert external stimuli to biochemical signals, which, in turn, are translated into behavior, e. g., turning or retraction, via cyto-skeleton–matrix linkages. Despite the inherent mechanical nature of the problem, the role of mechanics in axon guidance is poorly understood. Recent years has witnessed the application of a range of <b>microtechnologies</b> in neurobiology, from microfluidic circuits to single molecule force spectroscopy. In this mini-review, we describe <b>microtechnologies</b> geared towards dissecting the mechanical aspects of axon guidance, divided into three categories: controlling the growth cone microenvironment, stimulating growth cones with externally applied forces, and measuring forces exerted by the growth cones. A particular emphasis is given to those studies that combine multiple techniques, as dictated by the complexity of the problem...|$|R
