5|$|In an {{analysis}} of its components, IHS's iSuppli estimated that the production cost of the 16GB model of the Nexus7 is $159.25 per unit, $19 <b>more</b> <b>per</b> unit than Amazon.com's competing tablet, the Kindle Fire. The Nexus7's higher production costs were attributed to its use of a higher-quality display, a quad-core processor (instead of the Fire's dual-core), and its inclusion of a camera and near field communications (NFC) functionality. The firm's senior analyst Andrew Rassweiler suggested {{that the success of}} the HP TouchPad's fire sale helped increase the commercial viability of low-cost tablets from major brands, and the failures of other high-end tablets helped reduce the cost of parts, making tablets like the Kindle Fire and Nexus7 possible. However, he also noted that both tablets were being sold at thin profit margins, primarily due to their respective ties to content services.|$|E
