40|$|The present work {{proposes a}} {{methodology}} to model multitemporal knowledge within an automatic image interpretation framework. The method uses state transition diagrams {{to express the}} possibilities of class changes within a given time span. The change possibilities are estimated upon data of the same region acquired at a previous date by using genetic algorithms. Classification results obtained from multitemporal reasoning are combined to pure spectral classification by using fuzzy logic techniques. The proposed approach was evaluated using LANDSAT 7 images of three consecutive years of an area in southwest Brazil showing encouraging results. The multitemporal knowledge always improved the classification performance in comparison to a pure spectral classification. In addition, the genetic algorithm was in all cases superior to the manual trial and error alternative for the parameter estimation of the <b>multitemporal</b> <b>model...</b>|$|E
40|$|The most {{reliable}} independet prognostic {{factor for the}} disease evolution of head&neck cancer patients {{is the presence of}} lymph node metastasis. A computer aided evaluation and follow up assessment of relevant lymph nodes in different imaging modalities using a multimodal <b>multitemporal</b> <b>model</b> has many advantages, in particular in terms of reproducibility. However, this requires the robust automated registration and segmentation of lymph nodes from multi-modal time series medical images. In this work, new approaches for both imaging problems are presented because existing solutions do not satisfy the requirements. For the segmentation of lymph nodes from CT-data, a radial ray based 3 D-method is treated comprehensively. From a seed point, rays are cast into all directions and an optimization technique determines a radius for each ray based on image appearance and shape knowledge thereby obtaining a segmentation. For the first time, different appearance cost functions are compared and parameters are selected using a data driven approach. With an average symmetric surface distance of only 0. 46 mm, the segmentation accuracy is close to manual segmentation and outperforms existing semiautomatic methods. The inter-observer-variablity for volume assessment is approximately three times lower compared to manual volume assessment. Beyond lymph nodes, this method is also suitable for the segementation of other spherical structures such as tumors and offers an alternative to model based segmentation approaches for certain organs like the prostate. Prerequisite for a registration of individual lymph nodes is the automated deformable registration of the entire head&neck images. Therefore, the first fully automated general purpose multi-rigid registration method is presented. It is based on an articulated atlas combining shape and appearance knowledge of individual bones with information about their relative spatial locations (articulation). It is created from annotated training data and used to obtain a segmentation of individual bones from CT-data. Based on that, the atlas is personalized and then adapted to the other imaging modality or time series image, thereby incorporating the learned articulation space. The resulting rigid transformations for each bone are propagated into the surrounding soft tissue in a two step process resulting into a dense deformation field. Finally, the accuracy within the lymph nodes is improved using local rigid registration. Advantages of the multi-rigid image registration approach presented in this work are the huge capture range as well as low sensitivity towards imaging artifacts due to global regularization. The average registration accuracy in the lymph node centers is 5. 05 mm. Compared to B-spline registration, this is 37 % better {{while at the same time}} a considerable better quality of the deformed images is achieved. The major contributions of this work to the segmentation of lymph nodes are a new cost function, a comprehensive comparison of cost functions and a data driven parameter selection. The main contributions to image registration are the learned articulation, a dynamic adaptation strategy and the personalization of the articulated atlas...|$|E

40|$|Results of {{observations}} of the Mt. Vesuvius caldera, carried out by means of terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) in May 2005, October 2006 and June 2009, are reported here. In each survey the whole crater was acquired with 17 / 20 scans from 6 different viewpoints and the corresponding digital surface models were generated and registered into the UTM-WGS 84 reference frame. In this way, a comparison between the <b>multitemporal</b> <b>models</b> leads to {{an evaluation of the}} occurred changes. The deformation maps, i. e. the contouring plots {{of the differences between the}} models along the direction of maximum variations, showed a progressive mass loss due to rock-falls from the NE vertical crater wall whose area was about 5000 m 2. The TLS data also showed the accumulation at the bottom. The volume loss which occurred from 2005 to 2009, was computed by subtraction of volumes defined with respect to reference planes parallel to the caldera walls and was estimated to be 20 300 m 3. The volume uncertainties due to registration errors, subsampling noise effects, and effects due to choice of the reference plane, were also estimated. Some results were also interpreted on the basis of micro-seismic and meteorological data in order to plan a monitoring technique where seismic signals related to rock-fall and/or signals of intense rainfalls are used as alarms for fast TLS surveys able to characterize the corresponding changes of the caldera walls. The proposed methodology, in particular the simple but effective approach used in the estimation of volume uncertainties, can be applied to each rock slope instability phenomenon, regardless of the particular environment...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} and illustrates {{an approach}} to predict soil organic carbon (SOC) change in time after land use change as derived from SOC differences in space.

SOC of LSU with equal soil type but different land use type are compared and the observed differences in SOC are interpreted as the expected SOC change after the corresponding land use change. From a confrontation with time series of agro-statistical data on crop and grassland areas and on animal manure production, we conclude that the approach is a low-cost alternative for more complex methods like <b>multitemporal</b> assessments and <b>modelling,</b> provided that (i) an inventory reflecting current management and climate conditions and (ii) additional information on the extent and type of recent land use changes are available.

Modern geospatial technologies such as lidar, real time kinematic GPS, and three-dimensional GIS provide tools for efficient acquisition of high resolution data, geospatial analysis, feature extraction, and quantification of change. These techniques were applied to the Jockey’s Ridge, North Carolina, the largest active dune field {{on the east coast}} of the United States, with the goal to quantify its deflation and rapid horizontal migration. Digitized contours, photogrammetric, lidar and GPS point data were used to compute a <b>multitemporal</b> elevation <b>model</b> of the dune field capturing its evolution for the period of 1974 – 2004. In addition, peak elevation data were available for 1915 and 1953. Analysis revealed possible rapid growth of the dune complex between 1915 – 1953, followed by a slower rate of deflation that continues today. The main dune peak grew from 20. 1 m in 1915 to 41. 8 m in 1953 and has since eroded to 21. 9 m in 2004. Two of the smaller peaks within the dune complex have recently gained elevation, approaching the current height of the main dune. Steady annual rate of main peak elevation loss since 1953 suggests that {{increase in the number of}} visitors after the park was established in 1974 had little effect on the rate of dune deflation. Horizontal dune migration of 3 – 6 m/yr in southerly direction has carried the sand out of the park boundaries and threatened several houses. As a result, the south dune section was removed and the sand was placed at the northern end of the park to serve as a potential source.

The comparison between <b>multitemporal</b> <b>models</b> provides a space-time description of geophysical processes, {{and can be used}} to estimate deformation patterns, displacements, surface variations, volumes involved in mass movements, and other physical features. Several techniques, including GPS kinematic methodology, digi- tal aerial and terrestrial photogrammetry, airborne and terrestrial laser scanning, satellite-based and ground-based interferometric radar and optical satellite imagery systems, are suitable surveying methods that provide appropriate spatial resolution. Terrestrial Laser Scanning (TLS) allows an accurate and cost-effective representation of the topographical details of the observed surface. For this reason, TLS is currently used in geologic survey, engineering practice, cultural heritage, and mobile mapping. Besides the geometric data, the point cloud provided by a TLS observation con- tains radiometric information, i. e. the intensity of the received pulses, {{that can be used for}} classification purposes. Moreover, some instruments are equipped with a calibrated camera to add RGB color data to the intensity data. Since a TLS survey, including the corresponding data processing and analysis, can be carried out in relatively short time, an operational procedure can be planned and executed. The TLS and other remote sensing techniques, like digital photogrammetry, can be integrated to profit from the strength of each single technique and overcome the corresponding weakness, leading to a better modeling of the observed system. We show the results of observations on three Italian volcanoes by using a TLS recently implemented in the moni- toring system of the INGV. The most complete set has been acquired on Mt. Vesuvius crater in May 2005, October 2006 and June 2009. The whole crater was measured with several overlapped scans and the corresponding digital surface models were generated and registered into the UTM-WGS 84 reference frame. The comparison between the models leads to an evaluation of the occurred changes. The deformation maps showed a progressive mass loss due to rock-falls in an area of about 5000 m 2 with a corresponding accumulation at the bottom of the crater. The volume loss which occurred from 2005 to 2009, was computed by subtraction of volumes defined with respect to reference planes parallel to the caldera walls and was estimated to be 20300 m 3. Some results were also in- terpreted on the basis of micro-seismic and meteorological data in order to plan a monitoring technique where seismic signals related to rock-fall and/or signals of intense rainfalls are used as alarms for fast TLS surveys able to characterize the corresponding changes of the caldera walls. The proposed methodology, in particular the simple but effective approach used in the estimation of volume uncertainties, can be applied to each rock slope instability phenomenon, regardless to the particular environment. Two measurements were carried out at Vulcano in April 2009, by surveying the whole “La Fossa” crater and the “La Forgia” unstable slope, and in April 2010, by re-surveying again the “La Forgia” slope. All measurements were acquired with several overlapped scans. The comparison between the two measurements at “La Forgia” shows small change in the morphology that will be further investigated by new measurements; new measures will also be carried out to image again the “La Fossa” crater. Measurements at Stromboli were aimed at testing the capability of the technique in very difficult surveying con- ditions: the 2007 lava fan in the Sciara del Fuoco, an inaccessible and unstable area of the Stromboli volcano. In such a condition, TLS observes the fan only with high incidence angles and from distances longer than La Fossa case.

To exploit the potential of stereo satellite and aerial imagery for time series analysis, the employed methodology and software can be critical. A statistical analysis based on quartiles is presented to eliminate the influence of registration and elevation errors in DTMs. For our analysis, we used multi-temporal airborne and spaceborne stereoscopic images. The oldest images were recorded in the 1960 s by the US American reconnaissance satellite Corona, while the most recent imagery are 2007 Cartosat- 1 stereo scenes, along with one ASTER stereo pair. Complex panoramic distortion and limited spatial resolution resulted in the Corona and ASTER DTMs having the highest RMSEz. Due to differing acquisition techniques, applied software packages and temporal differences DTMs will never be identical. Therefore, we propose a relative vertical accuracy assessment with a master DTM. We chose the Cartosat- 1 DTM as it showed the highest absolute accuracy. Inaccuracies between the master and the slave DTMs were adjusted by means of trend surfaces and outliers were successfully eliminated applying the interquartile range...|$|R

To support rational policies for sustainable urban development, remote sensing technologies such as Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) enjoy increasing popularity for collecting up-to-date and reliable information such as urban land cover/land-use. With the launch of advanced spaceborne SAR sensors such as RADARSAT- 2, multitemporal fully polarimetric SAR data in high-resolution become increasingly available. Therefore, development of new methodologies to analyze such data for detailed and accurate urban mapping is in demand.   This research investigated multitemporal fine resolution spaceborne polarimetric SAR (PolSAR) data for detailed urban land cover mapping. To this end, the north and northwest parts of the Greater Toronto Area (GTA), Ontario, Canada were selected as the study area. Six-date C-band RADARSAT- 2 fine-beam full polarimetric SAR data were acquired during June to September in 2008. Detailed urban land covers and various natural classes were focused in this study.   Both object-based and pixel-based classification schemes were investigated for detailed urban land cover mapping. For the object-based approaches, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and rule-based classification method were combined to evaluate the classification capacities of various polarimetric features. Classification efficiencies of various multitemporal data combination forms were assessed. For the pixel-based approach, a temporal-spatial Stochastic Expectation-Maximization (SEM) algorithm was proposed. With an adaptive Markov Random Field (MRF) analysis and <b>multitemporal</b> mixture <b>models,</b> contextual information was explored in the classification process. Moreover, the fitness of alternative data distribution assumptions of multi-look PolSAR data were compared for detailed urban mapping by this algorithm.   Both the object-based and pixel-based classifications could produce the finer urban structures with high accuracy. The superiority of SVM was demonstrated by comparison with the Nearest Neighbor (NN) classifier in object-based cases. Efficient polarimetric parameters such as Pauli parameters and processing approaches such as logarithmically scaling of the data were found to be useful to improve the classification results. Combination of both the ascending and descending data with appropriate temporal span are suitable for urban land cover mapping. The SEM algorithm could preserve the detailed urban features with high classification accuracy while simultaneously overcoming the speckles.

The models were developed in 1992 for an area around Tapachula, Chiapas, using Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) satellite data and geographic information system functions. Using two remotely sensed landscape elements, the discriminant model was able to successfully distinguish between villages with high and low An. albimanus abundance with an overall accuracy of 90 %.

Erosional rates were not constant but varied up to approximately 15 times depending on the period, from 2.5 to 36.5  cm/year, although seasonal variances between the summer and winter seasons were unclear. As the potential main triggers of rockfall and slope failure, we examined the occurrences of high sea waves and significant earthquakes. The average wave height was approximately 2.0  m and the wave height maximum value was 5.9  m. The number of occurrences of a wave height greater than 3.0  m showed relatively good correspondence with the time series of eroded volume. On the other hand, the number of occurrences of an earthquake of a seismic intensity greater than two on the Japanese Scale did not show a clear correspondence with the eroded volume.

Visual investigations of the deposit and witness statements of villagers suggest that the primary event was an avalanche composed mostly of snow, while the collapsed glacier ice could not be dominant source for the total mass. Succeeding events were multiple rockfalls which may have been triggered by aftershocks. From the initial deposit volume and the area of the upper catchment, we estimate an average snow depth of 1. 82  ±  0. 46  m in the source area. This is consistent with anomalously large snow depths (1. 28 – 1. 52  m) observed at a neighboring glacier (4800 – 5100  m a. s. l.), which accumulated over the course of four major snowfall events between October  2014 and the earthquake on 25  April  2015.

In this study photogrammetry has been applied to extract multitemporal DEMs datasets of a hydrographic basin affected by landslides (Bologna, Italy) and GIS techniques have been used for morphologic enquiry on the test site. A time series of stereo digital images, derived from aerial photogrammetric surveys (1976, 1986, 1988 and 1993), was analysed and processed for obtaining high spatial resolution DEMs through softcopy photogrammetric techniques. DEMs accuracies, strictly related to the quality of images, to the adopted systems and strategies and to the morphologic features of the test area, were estimated.

To reconstruct the DsGSD evolutionary stages and to evaluate its controlling factors, a complex methodology has been applied, integrating orthophotos, stereo models and 3 D models of the DsGSD with field and literature data concerning tectonic and glacial history of the Seymour Valley. General geomechanical properties of the deforming rock mass has been then evaluated for using in numerical models of the failure mechanism at Blais Creek and to define a broad geomechanical characterization of different portions of the DsGSD. The combination between the aerial and terrestrial photogrammetry was appropriate {{in terms of the}} quality of the information obtained more than the quantitative information. Several Ground Control Points (GCPs) and Tie Points (TPs) were selected from the original DEM received by the BC Government. The use of a multitemporal aerial triangulation gave the possibility to minimize the error relative to every single block of images. Couples of oriented photos were used to create stereoscopic <b>models.</b> <b>Multitemporal</b> variations of the Blais Creek slope were observed and compared to the actual situation of the slope. The use of terrestrial photogrammetry through Adamtech software confirmed some of the qualitative data obtained from aerial interpretation and from field survey. The limited use of terrestrial photogrammetry was due to the impossibility of orienting the 3 D terrestrial models. Anyway these models were also useful to confirm one of the possible mechanisms used to describe the evolution of Blais Creek. Geomechanical analysis was performed through field work and laboratory tests to characterize the entire slope and to produce some of the values useful for a possible numerical analysis of Blais Creek. It showed interesting differences in geomechanical properties between the calc-silicate and quartzite/gneiss. The kinematic analysis showed very the different instability areas along the slope, even if variations in landforms and rock masses volume weren’t widespread along Blais Creek slope during the time span covered by aerial photographs (1973 - 2007). Indeed, the multitemporal analysis outlined very active instability along the large upper trench and the lateral active slopes of Blais Creek. Even without significant level of risks in the area, considering the remote area involved in this instability, some relevant hazards could occur, related to the possible collapse of SE side of Blais Creek DsGSD. Regarding the long term evolution of the DsGSD, the extensive network of linear features at Blais Creek is of a large deforming rock mass. Movement probably began with the retreat of valley glaciers during deglaciation when the oversteepened valley sides were debuttressed. By these evidences it is possible to theorize that the post-glacial retreat of the rock face and removal of the ice buttress from both the Seymour and the Blais Creeek Valleys lowered the factor of stability of the mass as a whole, allowing a deep-seated shear surface to develop gradually over time by progressive creep...|$|R
40|$|The {{increasing}} {{availability of}} the new generation remote sensing satellite hyperspectral images provides an important data source for Earth Observation (EO). Hyperspectral images are characterized by a very detailed spectral sampling (i. e., very high spectral resolution) over a wide spectral wavelength range. This important property makes it possible the monitoring of the land-cover dynamic and environmental evolution at a fine spectral scale. This also allows one to potentially detect subtle spectral variations associated with the land-cover transitions that are usually not detectable in the traditional multispectral images due to their poor spectral signature representation (i. e., generally sufficient for representing only the major changes). To fully utilize the available multitemporal hyperspectral images and their rich information content, {{it is necessary to}} develop advanced techniques for robust change detection (CD) in multitemporal hyperspectral images, thus to automatically discover and identify the interesting and valuable change information. This is the main goal of this thesis. In the literature, most of the CD approaches were designed for multispectral images. The effectiveness of these approaches, to the complex CD problems is reduced, when dealing with the hyperspectral images. Accordingly, the research activities carried out during this PhD study and presented in this thesis are devoted to the development of effective methods for multiple change detection in multitemporal hyperspectral images. These methods consider the intrinsic properties of the hyperspectral data and overcome the drawbacks of the existing CD techniques. In particular, the following specific novel contributions are introduced in this thesis: 1) 	A theoretical and empirical analysis of the multiple-change detection problem in multitemporal hyperspectral images. Definition and discussion of concepts as the changes and of the change endmembers, the hierarchical change structure and the multitemporal spectral mixture is given. 2) 	A novel semi-automatic sequential technique for iteratively discovering, visualizing, and detecting multiple changes. Reliable change variables are adaptively generated for the representation of each specific considered change. Thus multiple changes are discovered and discriminated according to an iterative re-projection of the spectral change vectors into new compressed change representation domains. Moreover, a simple yet effective tool is developed allowing user to have an interaction within the CD procedure. 3) 	A novel partially-unsupervised hierarchical clustering technique for the separation and identification of multiple changes. By considering spectral variations at different processing levels, multiple change information is adaptively modelled and clustered according to spectral homogeneity. A manual initialization is used to drive the whole hierarchical clustering procedure; 4) 	A novel automatic multitemporal spectral unmixing approach to detect multiple changes in hyperspectral images. A <b>multitemporal</b> spectral mixture <b>model</b> is proposed to analyse the spectral variations at sub-pixel level, thus investigating in details the spectral composition of change and no-change endmembers within a pixel. A patch-scheme is used in the endmembers extraction and unmixing, which better considers endmember variability. Comprehensive qualitative and quantitative experimental results obtained on both simulated and real multitemporal hyperspectral images confirm the effectiveness of the proposed techniques...|$|R
