For example, a musnad might begin by listing a number of the hadith, complete with their respective sanads, of Abu Bakr, and then listing a number of hadith from Umar, and then Uthman ibn Affan and so on.

Cladistics is a <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>arranging</b> species based strictly on their evolutionary relationships, using a statistical analysis of their anatomical characteristics. In the 1980s, cladistic methodology was applied to dinosaur phylogeny for the first time by Jacques Gauthier and others, showing unequivocally that birds were a derived group of theropod dinosaurs. Early analyses suggested that dromaeosaurid theropods like Deinonychus were particularly closely related to birds, a result that has been corroborated many times since.|$|E
500|$|The {{proximity}} of trench lines {{made it easy}} for soldiers to shout greetings to each other, and this may have been the most common <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>arranging</b> informal truces during 1914. Men would frequently exchange news or greetings, helped by a common language; many German soldiers had lived in England, particularly London, and were familiar with the language and the culture. Several British soldiers recorded instances of Germans asking about news from the football leagues, while other conversations could be as banal as discussions of the weather or as plaintive as messages for a sweetheart. One unusual phenomenon that grew in intensity was music; in peaceful sectors, it was not uncommon for units to sing in the evenings, sometimes deliberately with an eye towards entertaining or gently taunting their opposite numbers. This shaded gently into more festive activity; in early December, Sir Edward Hulse of the Scots Guards wrote that he was planning to organise a concert party for Christmas Day, which would [...] "give the enemy every conceivable form of song in harmony" [...] in response to frequent choruses of Deutschland Über Alles.|$|E

Thus, the natural process of teaching, based on performing particular actions by teacher and students in relays, is disturbed.

60|$|Dorothea seldom {{left home}} without her husband, {{but she did}} {{occasionally}} drive into Middlemarch alone, on little errands of shopping or charity such as occur to every lady of any wealth when she lives within three miles of a town. Two days after that scene in the Yew-tree Walk, she determined to use such an opportunity in order if possible to see Lydgate, and learn from him whether her husband had really felt any depressing change of symptoms which he was concealing from her, and whether he had insisted on knowing the utmost about himself. She felt almost guilty in asking for knowledge about him from another, but the dread of being without it--the dread of that ignorance which would make her unjust or hard--overcame every scruple. That {{there had been some}} crisis in her husband's mind she was certain: he had the very next day begun a new <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>arranging</b> his notes, and had associated her quite newly in carrying out his plan.

But Owen had looked at it quite in another light. He had, in justice, no right to inquire into all those circumstances of his old cousin's marriage. Such a union was a marriage in the eye of God, and should be held as such by him. He would take no advantage of so terrible an accident.|$|E
6000|$|From {{good old}} Baron Steuben, we find, not a {{manuscript}} {{essay on the}} <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>arranging</b> a battle, but a commercial draft, in a small, neat hand, as plain as print, elegant without flourish, except a very complicated one on the signature. On the whole, the specimen is sufficiently characteristic, as well of the Baron's soldier-like and German simplicity, as of the polish of the Great Frederick's aide-de-camp, a man of courts and of the world. How singular and picturesque an effect is produced, in the array of our Revolutionary army, by the intermingling of these titled personages from the Continent of Europe, with feudal associations clinging about them,--Steuben, De Kalb, Pulaski, Lafayette!--the German veteran, who had written from one famous battle-field to another for thirty years; and the young French noble, who had come hither, though yet unconscious of his high office, to light the torch that should {{set fire to the}} antiquated trumpery of his native institutions. Among these autographs, there is one from Lafayette, written long after our Revolution, but while that of his own country was in full progress.

One part of the debate will be on the Honors of the Pantheon, agreeably to what has been decreed by the Constitutional Assembly." ...|$|E
40|$|The major {{development}} {{in this paper}} concerns the failure, in earlier studies, to consider interaction between alternative <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> <b>arranging</b> sales in the housing market. A seller may market a house by direct negotiations with buyers, without the intermediation of real estate brokers, or by listing {{the house with a}} broker. A rational seller would choose the option which offers the higher expected return on the house. In a sequence of models we argue that the seller's option <b>of</b> a <b>method</b> <b>of</b> sale induces competitive pressure in the choice of the commission rate by the broker. We also consider the split rate in a multiple listing system, ease of entry of brokers and the cartel hypothesis as applied to brokers. We conclude that the competitive pressure of direct negotiations between sellers and buyers, relative free entry of brokers and the inappropri-ateness of the cartel hypothesis cast serious doubt about a general consensus of opinion that the brokerage system is characterized by price fixing, excessive commissions and excessive marketing costs.

We had no other means of collecting the rain than by holding the sheet spread out with one of the forechain-plates in the middle of it. The water, thus conducted to the centre, was drained through into our jug. We had nearly filled it in this manner, when, a heavy squall coming on from the northward, obliged us to desist, as the hulk began once more to roll so violently that we could no longer keep our feet. We now went forward, and, lashing ourselves securely to the remnant of the windlass as before, awaited the event with far more calmness than could have been anticipated or would have been imagined possible under the circumstances. At noon the wind had freshened into a two-reef breeze, and by night into a stiff gale, accompanied with a tremendously heavy swell. Experience having taught us, however, the best <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>arranging</b> our lashings, we weathered this dreary night in tolerable security, although thoroughly drenched at almost every instant by the sea, and in momentary dread of being washed off.

Subjects of research include arrangements made by the composer {{as well as those}} made by other arrangers. Principal works studied include the Brahms Clarinet Sonatas Op. 120, Nos. 1 and 2, and the Mozart Clarinet Concerto in A. Examples are also included from other relevant works fitting the criteria. Following the analysis on arranging techniques, I have used knowledge gained from my research to prepare an arrangement for viola of the Saint-Saens Clarinet Sonata in E-flat, Op. 167. Saint-Saens, who wrote no solo music for the viola, wrote many pieces for both the violin and the cello, some of which are standard in the solo repertoire for these instruments. Since there is a dearth of viola music by romantic composers, a Saint-Saens arrangement will help fill a gap in the solo repertoire for the viola. This sonata has qualities that make it an ideal candidate for a successful arrangement for viola. Following this project, I will attempt to publish the arrangement, so that it may be available to violists around the country...|$|R

There are various <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> <b>arranging</b> layers <b>of</b> references/annotations within a document. Other reference works (for example dictionaries, encyclopedias) also developed a precursor to hypertext: the setting of certain words in small capital letters, indicating that an entry existed for that term within the same reference work.
