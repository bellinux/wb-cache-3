500|$|In an 8 November 2002 Slate article, Chris Suellentrop likened Potter to a [...] "trust-fund kid whose {{success at}} school is largely {{attributable}} to the gifts his friends and relatives lavish upon him". Noting that in Rowling's fiction, magical ability potential is [...] "something you are born to, {{not something you can}} achieve", Suellentrop wrote that Dumbledore's maxim that [...] "It is our choices that show what we truly are, far <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>our</b> abilities" [...] is hypocritical, as [...] "the school that Dumbledore runs values native gifts above all else". In a 12 August 2007 New York Times review of Deathly Hallows, however, Christopher Hitchens praised Rowling for [...] "unmooring" [...] her [...] "English school story" [...] from literary precedents [...] "bound up with dreams of wealth and class and snobbery", arguing that she had instead created [...] "a world of youthful democracy and diversity".|$|E

But {{what happens when}} you don't find any????" [...] Brees immediately issued another statement to clarify, [...] "My WMD comment {{has nothing to do with}} politics or our brave military. Merely an analogy to show how media influences public perception." [...] He went on to say, [...] "I apologize if the WMD comment offended anyone. Especially our military. There is no one I respect <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>our</b> service men and women." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{battle was}} {{conducted}} during the tropical wet season. Average rainfall for December was , although this figure does not lend itself to a full appreciation {{of the impact of}} rain. It was characterised by heavy tropical storms, usually in the afternoon. While the worst of the monsoon held off until after the battle, rain was nonetheless a prevalent feature of the battle. Lieutenant General Robert L. Eichelberger wrote: [...] "At Buna that year it rained about a hundred and seventy inches [...] I have found out since that we got <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>our</b> share in December and January 1942–43." [...] Daily rainfall totals of [...] were not uncommon. Under these conditions, the few tracks, seldom more than foot trails, quickly became boggy.|$|E

The star {{is also more}} metal-rich, meaning it contains two times <b>more</b> metals Fe/H <b>than</b> <b>our</b> Sun.

2500|$|Portkeys {{are first}} {{mentioned}} in Goblet of Fire by Mr. Weasley. They are {{an alternative to}} Apparation but {{can also be used}} to transport a group of people at once. Created by using the Portus spell, a Portkey can be set to transport anybody who touches it to a designated location or to become active at a predetermined time and transport itself and anyone touching to its set destination. It may be created for one-way, one-time use or to transport the holder to and from a particular place in a round trip. The creation of Portkeys is highly restricted and controlled by the Department of Magical Transport, Portkey office. Cornelius Fudge objects to Dumbledore spontaneously creating one, stating that Dumbledore hasn't got authorisation; and at one point Lupin says, [...] "...it's <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>our</b> life's worth to set up an unauthorised Portkey." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "After {{almost seven}} years of being in Relient K, our {{cherished}} and lifelong friend, Brian Pittman has decided {{to move on to}} other things. That IS crazy, huh? Brian decided to leave the band in July, so we've {{had plenty of time to}} let the initial shock die down. We're aware that a lot of you already knew, so we apologize for not announcing this sooner. There were many reasons. He thought long and hard about his decision, and he came to the conclusion that he would like to do other things than play bass for the band. We respect him for it. We'd be lying to say that we're not all completely bummed that Brian won't be a part of Relient K anymore. And though we know things won't be the same without him, it must be said that we have always valued our friendships with him <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>our</b> on-stage relationship.|$|E
2500|$|St Thomas Aquinas interprets 'You should {{love your}} {{neighbour}} as yourself' as meaning that love for ourselves is the exemplar {{of love for}} others. Considering that [...] "the love with which a man loves himself is the form and root of friendship" [...] and quotes Aristotle that [...] "the origin of friendly relations with others lies in our relations to ourselves," [...] he concluded that though we are not bound to love others more than ourselves, we naturally seek the common good, {{the good of the}} whole, more than any private good, the good of a part. However, he thinks we should love God more than ourselves and our neighbours, and <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>our</b> bodily life—since the ultimate purpose of loving our neighbour is to share in eternal beatitude: a more desirable thing than bodily well being. In coining the word Altruism, as stated above, Comte was probably opposing this Thomistic doctrine, which is present in some theological schools within Catholicism.|$|E

Our ancient indulgence [Footnote: 23] has been said to be pursued to a fault. It may be so.
