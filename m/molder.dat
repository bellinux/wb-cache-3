25|$|On one occasion, {{they entered}} the Hudson's Bay Company Department Store to {{publicize}} their grievances to shoppers. The police came to evict the men, and a bloody clash ensued. After that incident, the unemployed congregated at Victory Square Park, where McGeer came and read the Riot Act. The camp strikers left the city after two months to begin the On-to-Ottawa Trek. They felt they accomplished all they could in Vancouver and voted to take their grievances directly to Prime Minister R. B. Bennett. Shortly before the trekkers left, another Communist-led strike broke out on the waterfront, culminating with another bloody clash that {{became known as the}} Battle of Ballantyne Pier. Gerry McGeer treated these protests not as strikes, but as an attempted Bolshevik uprising. Although he came from a background as an iron <b>molder</b> and union representative, he came to be seen as an enemy of organized labour because of these events.|$|E
500|$|Ed Reis, a {{volunteer}} historian for Westinghouse, {{noted that the}} original image was not shown to female riveters during the war, so the recent association with [...] "Rosie the Riveter" [...] was unjustified.

500|$|On 1 July 1935, Leutnant <b>Mölders</b> {{was posted}} to Fliegergruppe Schwerin (I./JG 162 [...] "Immelmann"). On 7 March 1936, during the remilitarisation of the Rhineland, <b>Mölders</b> and his {{squadron}} (Staffel) {{were moved to}} Düsseldorf. During this period, <b>Mölders</b> met Luise Baldauf, whom he was to marry a few years later, shortly before his death. On 20 April 1936, Adolf Hitler's birthday, numerous promotions were handed out, and <b>Mölders</b> advanced to Oberleutnant, effective as of 1 April 1936. At the same time, he became leader of the fighter training squadron of the 2nd Group of Jagdgeschwader 134 [...] "Horst Wessel". This group was {{under the command of}} Major Theo Osterkamp, who became another of Mölders' early mentors. <b>Mölders</b> was appointed squadron leader (Staffelkapitän) of the 1st squadron of Jagdgeschwader 334 on 15 March 1937 and served as an instructor in Wiesbaden.|$|R
5|$|On 5 June 1940, on his 133rd combat {{mission of}} the war, {{engaging}} in aerial combat for the 32nd time, <b>Mölders</b> was shot down near Compiègne at about 18:40 by Sous lieutenant René Pomier Layrargues, flying a French Air Force Dewoitine D.520. <b>Mölders</b> was taken prisoner but liberated three weeks later upon the armistice with France. While in French captivity, <b>Mölders</b> asked {{to shake hands with}} the pilot who had shot him down, and learned that Pomier-Layrargues had been killed in action 30 minutes after their encounter. His initial experience in French captivity was harsh; he sustained abrasions to his face and his Knight's Cross was stolen from him. A French officer, Capitaine Giron, intervened, ensured he was treated fairly, and returned the stolen medal. When a French soldier was later sentenced to death by the Germans for beating <b>Mölders,</b> <b>Mölders</b> approached Hermann Göring and requested clemency, which was granted.|$|R

2500|$|It was Saint-Léon who {{commissioned}} Minkus's first {{score for}} a full-length Grand Ballet, the three-act La Flamme d′amour, ou La Salamandre (The Flame of Love, or The Salamander), which the Ballet Master produced {{especially for the}} renowned Russian Prima ballerina Marfa Muravieva. The premiere on [...] was a great success for the ballet company of the Bolshoi Theatre. Saint-Léon subsequently [...] mounted the work in St. Petersburg for the Imperial Ballet in an elaborated staging for the benefit performance of Muravieva under the title Fiametta, ou L′amour du Diable (Fiametta, or The Love of the Devil). This version was first performed on [...] at the Imperial Bolshoi Kamenny Theatre. Minkus later accompanied Saint-Léon to mount this work in a new staging for the ballerina Muravieva at the Théâtre Impérial de l'Opéra in Paris. For this staging the ballet's title was changed again as Néméa, ou L′Amour vengé (Néméa, or The Avenged Love). At that time, ballets were performed at the Paris Opéra only as diversions during the intermissions of full-length operas, and as such Saint-Léon's ballet was reduced to two-acts. The first performance took place on 11 July 1864 with an audience that included the Empress Eugénie. Featured along with Muravieva {{in the title role}} of Néméa was the celebrated Premier danseur Louis Mérante in the role of Count <b>Molder</b> and the ballerina Eugénie Fiocre in the role of Cupid. Minkus's score was praised by the critics of day, among them Théophile Gautier, who found the music be filled with a [...] " [...]. haunting, dreamy quality. The music for the dances were filled with sparkling melodies and infectious rhythms." [...] Néméa, ou L′Amour vengé was retained for fifty-three performances in the Opéra's repertory until 1871. Saint-Léon also mounted the work for the ballet of the Teatro Communale in Trieste, where it premiered on 15 March 1868 as Nascita della Fiamma d′Amoure (Birth of the Flame of Love). The change of titles of this work has caused much confusion among historians, many of whom have claimed that each of these productions were completely different works altogether.|$|E
50|$|Additional mergers {{followed}} in the 1980s. The International Brotherhood of Pottery and Allied Workers merged with the Glass Bottle Blowers Association to form the Glass, Pottery, Plastics and Allied Workers International Union (GPPAW). Six years later, in 1988, the International <b>Molders</b> and Allied Workers, a union of iron <b>molders,</b> merged with the union to form the Glass, <b>Molders,</b> Pottery, Plastics and Allied Workers International Union (GMPIU). Barrel makers, the Coopers' International Union of North America, {{followed in}} 1992.|$|R
500|$|Other {{evidence}} has surfaced illustrating Mölders' ambiguous {{relationship with the}} National Socialist regime. <b>Mölders</b> {{may have been in}} contact with bishop Clemens August Graf von Galen, who was highly critical of the Nazi regime. Von Galen publicly criticised the regime for the Gestapo's tactics and the deportation and euthanasia of the mentally ill. According to the diary kept by Heinrich Portmann, von Galen's secretary and chaplain, <b>Mölders</b> threatened to return his awards if von Galen's euthanasia accusation turned out to be true. Furthermore, Portmann stated that Hitler had asked <b>Mölders</b> during the presentation of the Diamonds to the Knight's Cross if there was anything he wished for. <b>Mölders</b> reportedly responded, [...] "Please leave the bishop of Münster alone." [...] Hitler assured him that [...] "Yes, nothing will happen to the bishop of Münster." [...] The MGFA concluded in 2004 that this story was most likely false. The MGFA revised its position again on 28 June 2007, concluding that there had been contact between <b>Mölders</b> and von Galen.|$|R
500|$|<b>Mölders</b> also flew unofficially on missions, and {{actively}} commanded his old unit, JG 51, {{for several more}} months. On 9 August 1941, he took Herbert Kaiser on a [...] "teaching" [...] mission against a formation of Il-2 Sturmoviks. <b>Mölders</b> showed Kaiser how to shoot them down.|$|R

60|$|The {{graveyard}} was an inclosure on {{the grounds}} of Mr. Wharton, which had been fenced with stone and set apart for the purpose, by that gentleman, some years before. It was not, however, intended as a burial place for any of his own family. Until the fire, which raged as the British troops took possession of New York, had laid Trinity in ashes, a goodly gilded tablet on its walls proclaimed the virtues of his deceased parents, and beneath a flag of marble, in one of the aisles of the church, their bones were left to <b>molder</b> in aristocratical repose. Captain Lawton made a movement as if he was disposed to follow the procession, when it left the highway, to enter the field which contained the graves of the humble dead, but he was recalled to recollection by a hint from his companion that he was taking the wrong road.|$|E
50|$|Jan de <b>Molder</b> (sometimes Jean de <b>Molder,</b> fl. 1494-1550) was a Northern Renaissance {{wood carver}} active in Antwerp {{in the early}} 16th century. His work {{represents}} the beginnings of Antwerp Mannerism.|$|E
50|$|After his {{transfer}} to JG 27, Galland met <b>Mölders</b> again. Due to his injuries, Galland could never match <b>Mölders</b> sharp eyesight; the {{shards of glass}} in his eyes denied him that capacity. However, <b>Mölders,</b> by that time a recognised ace (a pilot with five or more aerial victories), shared what experiences he could with Galland; leadership in the air, tactics and organisation. <b>Mölders</b> was Geschwaderkommodore of Jagdgeschwader 53 {{at the time of}} their meeting. In order for Galland to gain experience on the Bf 109E, which Galland lacked, he offered Galland the chance to join his unit which was flying patrols along the French border. During these sorties, Galland learned <b>Mölders</b> tactics, such as using spotter aircraft to indicate the position of enemy formation, as an early warning system. Galland learned to allow the Staffel to operate freely in order to seize the initiative and surprise. Taking his findings back to JG 27, its commander Max Ibel, agreed to their implementation. Galland gained further experience as a combat leader acting as the Gruppenkommandeur, when the Gruppenkommandeur went on leave.|$|R
500|$|Returning to Germany, <b>Mölders</b> was {{promoted}} to Major on 19 July 1940 and took command the following day of Jagdgeschwader 51 (JG 51) from the recently promoted Generalmajor Theo Osterkamp. At the time, JG 51 were based at Saint-Inglevert, Pas-de-Calais, France. <b>Mölders</b> flew his first combat sortie with JG 51 on 28 July, attacking a No. 41 Squadron Supermarine Spitfire flown by Flying Officer A.D.J. Lovell. On this mission, according to legend, <b>Mölders</b> was hit in a dogfight over Dover by the South African ace Sailor Malan, sustaining three splinter wounds in the lower leg, one in the knee {{and one in the}} left foot. Oberleutnant Richard Leppla shot down the pursuing Spitfire, and <b>Mölders</b> was able to make an emergency landing at Wissant, France. Recent research suggests <b>Mölders</b> was actually wounded in combat by Flight Lieutenant J.T (John Terence) [...] "Terry" [...] Webster DFC in a Spitfire of 41 Squadron. Webster was killed in action on 5 September 1940. <b>Mölders</b> wounds, although not serious, kept him from further operational flying for a month. Generalmajor Osterkamp briefly led the Geschwader again during Mölders' convalescence. On 7 August 1940, <b>Mölders</b> returned to the Geschwader without medical clearance for combat, to participate in Operation Eagle Attack (code name Adlertag). Adolf Hitler had issued Führer Directive no. 17 (Weisung Nr. 17) on 1 August 1940; the strategic objective was to engage and defeat the Royal Air Force (RAF) so as to achieve air superiority in preparation for Operation Sea Lion (Unternehmen Seelöwe), the proposed amphibious invasion of Great Britain.|$|R

50|$|In 2009 on the PGA Tour, <b>Molder</b> {{broke out}} in June at the St. Jude Classic, where he shot a second round 63 {{followed}} by a third round 65 and was one shot behind 54-hole leader Brian Gay going into the final round. <b>Molder</b> went on to finish in a tie for 2nd with David Toms on Sunday, four strokes behind the winner, Gay, for his best finish in a PGA Tour event at the time. A few weeks later, <b>Molder</b> finished fourth at the AT&T National, posting 272, five strokes back of winner Tiger Woods.

Three days later, on 15 July 1941, <b>Mölders</b> surpassed the C mark, claiming victories Nos. 100 and 101, and celebrated with a victory roll over the airfield. The following day he received news that he had been awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves, Swords and Diamonds (...)

The diamonds added to the Knight's Cross were introduced officially on 28 September 1941, more than two months after <b>Mölders</b> earned the award. <b>Mölders</b> was promoted to Oberst on 20 July 1941, effective immediately, and banned from further combat flying. Surrendering command of JG 51 to Major Friedrich Beckh he was transferred to the Reich Air Ministry, a temporary position he held until 6 August 1941. <b>Mölders</b> was summoned to the Wolfsschanze again, where he received the Diamonds from Adolf Hitler on 26 July 1941.
