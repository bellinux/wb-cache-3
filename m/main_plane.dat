500|$|... 0n 19 August 1940, Johnson flew a Spitfire for {{the first}} time. Over the next weeks he practised handling, {{formation}} flying, attacks, battle climbs, aerobatics and dogfighting. During his training flights, he stalled and crashed a Spitfire. Johnson had his harness straps on too loose, and wrenched his shoulders – revealing that his earlier rugby injury had not healed properly. The Spitfire did a ground loop, ripping {{off one of the}} undercarriage legs and forcing the other up through the port <b>main</b> <b>plane.</b> The commanding officer (CO) excused Johnson, for the [...] "short airfield" [...] was difficult to land on for an inexperienced pilot. Johnson got the impression, however, that he would be watched closely, and felt that if he made another mistake, he would be [...] "certainly washed out". Johnson tried to pack the injured shoulder with wool, held in place by adhesive tape. He also tightened the straps to reduce vibrations. Johnson found he had lost his [...] "feel" [...] in his right hand, and it became numb. When he practised dives, the pressure also aggravated his shoulder. He often tried to fly using his left hand only, but the Spitfire would have to be handled with both hands during anything other than simple manoeuvres. Despite the difficulties with his injuries, on 28 August 1940, the course was complete. Johnson had 205.25 hours on operational types including 23.50 on the Spitfire.|$|E

50|$|The {{horizontal}} {{elements of}} the rear wing consist of the <b>main</b> <b>plane</b> and the flap. The DRS allows the flap to lift a maximum of 50 mm from the fixed <b>main</b> <b>plane.</b> This reduces opposition (drag) to airflow against the wing and results in less downforce. In the absence of significant lateral forces (straight line), less downforce allows faster acceleration and potential top speed, unless limited by the top gear ratio and engine rev limiter. Sam Michael, sporting director of the McLaren team, believes that DRS in qualifying will be worth about half a second per lap.|$|E
50|$|Tabular {{crystals}} grow {{along the}} edges {{and not on the}} <b>main</b> <b>planes.</b> Similarly, tabular crystals dissolve mainly {{along the edges}} and this causes the crystals to be more difficult and slow to fix in the fixing stage. Users of tabular grain films are advised to ensure sufficient fixing time, at least twice the clearing time in rapid fixer.|$|R

50|$|Each {{stability}} derivative {{is determined}} by the position, size, shape and orientation of the missile components. In aircraft, the directional stability determines such features as dihedral of the <b>main</b> <b>planes,</b> size of fin and area of tailplane, but the large number of important stability derivatives involved precludes a detailed discussion within this article. The missile is characterised by only three stability derivatives, and hence provides a useful introduction to the more complex aeroplane dynamics.|$|R
50|$|In {{presence}} of molecular orientation anisotropy in the sample, CARS images often display artefacts due to polarization-dependent selection rules {{that affects the}} measured intensity with respect of the alignment between the polarization plane of the incident light and the <b>main</b> orientation <b>plane</b> of the molecular bonds.This is due because the four-wave mixing process is more efficient when the polarization plane of the incident light is aligned with the <b>main</b> orientation <b>plane</b> of the molecular vibrations.|$|R

50|$|The player {{starts out}} with a {{propelled}} plane that can fire air-to-air twin machine guns and air-to-ground rockets. These weapons are used for destroying waves of enemy planes and ground and sea units. The <b>main</b> <b>plane</b> is destroyed by one hit. If a certain enemy is destroyed the player can collect a comrade fighter to fight alongside the <b>main</b> <b>plane.</b> Up to two comrade fighters can be collected. The comrade fighters can be assigned {{to fight in the}} air to fire bullets or they can be assigned to fight at low altitude to fire air-to-ground rockets. The comrade fighters can also be launched to do a kamikaze attack explosion against the enemy. After kamikaze attacks, the comrade fighters are retrievable, but they are lost if they are shot or crash into an enemy. In some areas of certain stages, the player will fly at a lower altitude armed with only twin machine guns and shooting down parked planes and turrets and can take a limited amount of damage from multiple shots and crashes. At the end of each stage, the player must destroy a boss vehicle to proceed.|$|E

50|$|Tabular {{crystals}} {{usually have}} two twinned planes parallel to each other. They are formed {{at the very}} beginning of the crystallization.

Tabular crystals probably existed from very early days of silver-gelatin photography.
