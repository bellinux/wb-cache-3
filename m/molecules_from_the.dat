5|$|AD is also {{considered}} a tauopathy due to abnormal aggregation of the tau protein. Every neuron has a cytoskeleton, an internal support structure partly {{made up of}} structures called microtubules. These microtubules act like tracks, guiding nutrients and <b>molecules</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> body of the cell {{to the ends of}} the axon and back. A protein called tau stabilises the microtubules when phosphorylated, and is therefore called a microtubule-associated protein. In AD, tau undergoes chemical changes, becoming hyperphosphorylated; it then begins to pair with other threads, creating neurofibrillary tangles and disintegrating the neuron's transport system.|$|E
5|$|Interstellar {{molecules}} {{are formed}} by chemical reactions within very sparse interstellar or circumstellar {{clouds of dust}} and gas. Usually this occurs when a molecule becomes ionized, often {{as the result of}} an interaction with a cosmic ray. This positively charged molecule then draws in a nearby reactant by electrostatic attraction of the neutral molecule's electrons. Molecules can also be generated by reactions between neutral atoms and molecules, although this process is generally slower. The dust plays a critical role of shielding the <b>molecules</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> ionizing effect of ultraviolet radiation emitted by stars.|$|E
5|$|Many {{important}} biochemical reactions, such {{as energy}} generation, use concentration gradients across membranes. The {{general lack of}} internal membranes in bacteria means reactions such as electron transport occur across the cell membrane between the cytoplasm and the periplasmic space. However, in many photosynthetic bacteria the plasma membrane is highly folded and fills most of the cell with layers of light-gathering membrane. These light-gathering complexes may even form lipid-enclosed structures called chlorosomes in green sulfur bacteria. Other proteins import nutrients across the cell membrane, or expel undesired <b>molecules</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> cytoplasm.|$|E

5|$|Three main {{modalities}} of RRT are available: hemodialysis, continuous hemofiltration and peritoneal dialysis. The former two require {{access to}} the bloodstream (a dialysis catheter), while peritoneal dialysis is achieved by instilling fluid into the abdominal cavity and later draining it. Hemodialysis, which is normally done {{several times a week}} in chronic kidney disease, is often required on a daily basis in rhabdomyolysis. Its advantage over continuous hemofiltration is that one machine can be used multiple times a day, and that continuous administration of anticoagulant drugs is not necessary. Hemofiltration is more effective at removing large <b>molecules</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> bloodstream, such as myoglobin, but this does not seem to confer any particular benefit. Peritoneal dialysis may be difficult to administer in someone with severe abdominal injury, and it may be less effective than the other modalities.|$|E

Although small molecules can enter the nucleus without regulation, Proteins, transfer RNA, and assembled ribosomal subunits are exported from the nucleus due to association with exportins, which bind signaling sequences called nuclear export signals (NES). The ability of both importins and exportins to transport their cargo is regulated by the small Ras related GTPase, Ran.|$|E

25|$|The {{second half}} of {{glycolysis}} {{is known as the}} pay-off phase, characterised by a net gain of the energy-rich molecules ATP and NADH.

40|$|Background: NMR {{experiments}} {{show that}} even water molecules {{that are well}} ordered in a crystal structure exchange with the external solvent. Despite crucial progress on {{the understanding of the}} exchange of crystal-buried water molecules, the detailed pathways followed by a water <b>molecule</b> to escape <b>from</b> or penetrate into the protein interior are unknown. Results: The exchange of a crystal water molecule buried in the low-density lipoprotein receptor-binding domain of human apolipoprotein E with a water <b>molecule</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> external solvent was detected and monitored in a molecular dynamics simulation. This simulation shows that the escape of <b>the</b> crystal water <b>molecule</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> protein interior and the penetration of <b>the</b> water <b>molecule</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> bulk occur by a single-pathway mechanism involving conformational fluctuations of arginine and tryptophan sidechains. Along the pathway the exchanging water molecule interacts specifically with protein atoms by way of a varying pattern of hydrogen bonds. Conclusions:The exchange pathway revealed by the molecular dynamics trajectory suggests a mechanism by which hydrogen bonds work in relay to permit either the penetration or the expulsion of a water molecule. This result may have important implications not only on the process of water exchange but also to probe ligand binding to proteins...|$|R
25|$|The {{trivalent}} lanthanides mostly form ionic salts. The trivalent ions {{are hard}} acceptors and form more stable complexes with oxygen-donor ligands than with nitrogen-donor ligands. The larger ions are 9-coordinate in aqueous solution, 3+ but the smaller ions are 8-coordinate, 3+. There {{is some evidence}} that the later lanthanides have more water molecules in the second coordination sphere. Complexation with monodentate ligands is generally weak because it is difficult to displace water <b>molecules</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> first coordination sphere. Stronger complexes are formed with chelating ligands because of the chelate effect, such as the tetra-anion derived from 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid (DOTA).|$|E
25|$|Bile emulsifies fats {{contained}} in the chyme, then pancreatic lipase cleaves triacylglycerol molecules into two fatty acids and one 2-monoacylglycerol. Enterocytes readily absorb these small <b>molecules</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> chymus. Inside of the enterocytes, fatty acids and monoacylglycerides are transformed again into triacylglycerides. Then these lipids (i.e. triacylglycerols, phospholipids, cholesterol, and cholesteryl esters) are assembled with apolipoprotein B-48 into nascent chylomicrons. These particles are then secreted into the lacteals {{in a process that}} depends heavily on apolipoprotein B-48. As they circulate through the lymphatic vessels, nascent chylomicrons bypass the liver circulation and are drained via the thoracic duct into the bloodstream.|$|E
25|$|To {{create a}} {{population}} inversion under these conditions, {{it is necessary}} to selectively remove some atoms or <b>molecules</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> system based on differences in properties. For instance, in a hydrogen maser, the well-known 21cm wave transition in atomic hydrogen, where the lone electron flips its spin state from parallel to the nuclear spin to antiparallel, can be used to create a population inversion because the parallel state has a magnetic moment and the antiparallel state does not. A strong inhomogeneous magnetic field will separate out atoms in the higher energy state from a beam of mixed state atoms. The separated population represents a population inversion which can exhibit stimulated emissions.|$|E

500|$|At {{seawater}} pH, {{most of the}} CO2 {{is immediately}} converted back into [...] The reaction results in a net transport of one <b>molecule</b> of CO2 <b>from</b> <b>the</b> ocean/atmosphere into the lithosphere. The result is that each Ca2+ ion released by chemical weathering ultimately removes one CO2 <b>molecule</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> surficial system (atmosphere, ocean, soils and living organisms), storing it in carbonate rocks where {{it is likely to}} stay for hundreds of millions of years.

25|$|Dip-pen {{nanolithography}} is {{a process}} that uses an atomic force microscope to transfer molecules on the tip to a substrate. Initially the tip is dipped into a reservoir with an ink. The ink on the tip evaporates and leaves the desired molecules attached to the tip. When the tip is brought into contact with the surface a water meniscus forms between the tip and the surface resulting in the diffusion of <b>molecules</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> tip to the surface. These tips can have radii in the tens of nanometers, and thus SAM molecules can be very precisely deposited onto a specific location of the surface. This process was discovered by Chad Mirkin and co-workers at Northwestern University.|$|E
25|$|The {{majority}} of signal transduction pathways involve the binding of signaling molecules, known as ligands, to receptors that trigger events inside the cell. The binding of a signaling molecule with a receptor {{causes a change}} in the conformation of the receptor, known as receptor activation. Most ligands are soluble <b>molecules</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> extracellular medium which bind to cell surface receptors. These include growth factors, cytokines and neurotransmitters. Components of the extracellular matrix such as fibronectin and hyaluronan can also bind to such receptors (integrins and CD44, respectively). In addition, some molecules such as steroid hormones are lipid-soluble and thus cross the plasma membrane to reach nuclear receptors. In the case of steroid hormone receptors, their stimulation leads to binding to the promoter region of steroid-responsive genes.|$|E
25|$|Titan has {{by far the}} densest {{atmosphere}} of any moon. The Titanean atmosphere is in fact denser than Earth's, with a surface pressure of 147 kPa, {{one and a half}} times that of the Earth. The atmosphere is 98.4% nitrogen, with the remaining 1.6% composed of methane and trace amounts of other gases such as hydrocarbons (including ethane, diacetylene, methylacetylene, cyanoacetylene, acetylene, propane), argon, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, cyanogen, hydrogen cyanide and helium. The hydrocarbons are thought to form in Titan's upper atmosphere in reactions resulting from the breakup of methane by the Sun's ultraviolet light, producing a thick orange smog. Titan has no magnetic field and sometimes orbits outside Saturn's magnetosphere, directly exposing it to the solar wind. This may ionize and carry away some <b>molecules</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> top of the atmosphere.|$|E

25|$|This {{variation}} of the patch clamp method {{is very similar to}} the whole-cell configuration. The main difference {{lies in the fact that}} when the experimenter forms the gigaohm seal, suction is not used to rupture the patch membrane. Instead, the electrode solution contains small amounts of an antifungal or antibiotic agent, such as amphothericin-B, nystatin, or gramicidin, which diffuses into the membrane patch and forms small pores in the membrane, providing electrical access to the cell interior. When comparing the whole-cell and perforated patch methods, one can think of the whole-cell patch as an open door, in which there is complete exchange between molecules in the pipette solution and the cytoplasm. The perforated patch can be likened to a screen door that only allows the exchange of certain <b>molecules</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> pipette solution to the cytoplasm of the cell.|$|E
25|$|Pseudo-panspermia (sometimes called soft panspermia, {{molecular}} panspermia or quasi-panspermia) {{proposes that}} the organic molecules used for life originated {{in space and}} were incorporated in the solar nebula, from which the planets condensed and were further —and continuously— distributed to planetary surfaces where life then emerged (abiogenesis). From the early 1970s it was becoming evident that interstellar dust consisted of a large component of organic molecules. The first suggestion came from Chandra Wickramasinghe, who proposed a polymeric composition based on the molecule formaldehyde (CH2O). Interstellar molecules are formed by chemical reactions within very sparse interstellar or circumstellar clouds of dust and gas.

25|$|The {{atmospheric}} composition {{in the stratosphere}} is 98.4% nitrogen—the only dense, nitrogen-rich atmosphere in the Solar System aside from Earth's—with the remaining 1.6% composed of mostly of methane (1.4%) and hydrogen (0.1–0.2%). Because methane condenses out of Titan's atmosphere at high altitudes, its abundance increases as one descends below the tropopause {{at an altitude of}} 32km, leveling off at a value of 4.9% between 8km and the surface. There are trace amounts of other hydrocarbons, such as ethane, diacetylene, methylacetylene, acetylene and propane, and of other gases, such as cyanoacetylene, hydrogen cyanide, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, cyanogen, argon and helium. The orange color as seen from space must be produced by other more complex chemicals in small quantities, possibly tholins, tar-like organic precipitates. The hydrocarbons are thought to form in Titan's upper atmosphere in reactions resulting from the breakup of methane by the Sun's ultraviolet light, producing a thick orange smog. Titan has no magnetic field, although studies in 2008 showed that Titan retains remnants of Saturn's magnetic field on the brief occasions when it passes outside Saturn's magnetosphere and is directly exposed to the solar wind.
