5|$|These SWNT forests (buckypaper) {{were grown}} by the super-growth CVD method to about 10 μm height. Two factors could {{contribute}} to strong light absorption by these structures: (i) a distribution of CNT chiralities resulted in various bandgaps for individual CNTs. Thus a compound material was formed with broadband absorption. (ii) Light might be trapped in those forests due to <b>multiple</b> <b>reflections.</b>|$|E
5|$|Pale Blue Dot, {{which was}} {{taken with the}} narrow-angle camera, was also {{published}} {{as part of a}} composite picture created from a wide-angle camera photograph showing the Sun and the region of space containing the Earth and Venus. The wide-angle image was inset with two narrow-angle pictures: Pale Blue Dot and a similar photograph of Venus. The wide-angle photograph was taken with the darkest filter (a methane absorption band) and the shortest possible exposure (5 milliseconds), to avoid saturating the camera's vidicon tube with scattered sunlight. Even so, the result was a bright burned-out image with <b>multiple</b> <b>reflections</b> from the optics in the camera and the Sun that appears far larger than the actual dimension of the solar disk. The rays around the Sun are a diffraction pattern of the calibration lamp which is mounted in front of the wide-angle lens.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} Rihanna singing the hook while wearing a low cut green dress and dancing {{in front of}} {{tropical}} plants on a beach, whilst singing the hook. Key lighting is used to place emphasis on Rihanna, whilst the backdrop remains virtually dark and unseeable. For the first verse, Rihanna is featured dancing against a plain grey background, wearing a white top and silver glitter mini-skirt, whilst flirtatiously dancing with the male dancer. Halfway through the verse, another scene is introduced, with Rihanna wearing a pink dress in a mirrored room, showing <b>multiple</b> <b>reflections</b> of the singer from different angles. For the first chorus, Rihanna is mainly featured wearing the green dress on the beach, but a new scene of Rihanna wearing black lace is introduced {{toward the end of}} the chorus, where she, as well as four male dancers, perform a choreographed dance routine. Scenes of Rihanna in the mirrored room are intercut with the previous scene for the duration of the chorus. For the second verse, a further scene of Rihanna is depicted, this time featuring the scenes performing a dance routine with a group of female dancers, in the same setting as the one at the start of the video. For the second chorus, another scene of the singer sitting on a chair whilst listening to music is shown. For the remainder of the video, including the bridge and final chorus, all scenes featured in the video are intercut with one and other, displaying a total of five different scenes and settings.|$|E
40|$|<b>Multiple</b> <b>reflection</b> of X-rays may be {{important}} when an accretion disc and its hot corona have a complicated geometry, or if returning radiation due to gravitational light bending is important, or in emission from a funnel such as proposed in some gamma-ray burst models.

25|$|Michelson sought another measurement, {{but this}} time in an {{evacuated}} tube to avoid difficulties in interpreting the image owing to atmospheric effects. In 1930, he began a collaboration with Francis G. Pease and Fred Pearson to perform a measurement in a 1.6km tube 3 feet in diameter at the Irvine Ranch near Santa Ana, California. In <b>multiple</b> <b>reflections</b> the light path was increased to 10 miles. For {{the first time in}} history the speed of light was measured in an almost perfect vacuum of 0.5mm of mercury. Michelson died with only 36 of the 233 measurement series completed and the experiment was subsequently beset by geological instability and condensation problems before the result of 299,774±11km/s, consistent with the prevailing electro-optic values, was published posthumously in 1935.|$|E

500|$|Animals {{can also}} appear {{coloured}} due to structural colour, {{the result of}} coherent scattering perceived as iridescence. The structures themselves are colourless. [...] Light typically passes through multiple layers and is reflected more than once. The <b>multiple</b> <b>reflections</b> compound one another and intensify the colours. [...] Structural colour differs according to the observer's position whereas pigments appear the same regardless of the angle-of-view. Animals that show iridescence include mother of pearl seashells, fish, and peacocks. [...] These {{are just a few}} examples of animals with this quality, but it is most pronounced in the butterfly family.|$|E
500|$|The image {{analysis}} {{starts with a}} calculation of the input and output impedances (the image impedances) and the transfer function of a section in an infinite chain of identical sections. This can {{be shown to be}} equivalent to the performance of a section terminated in its image impedances.Laplante, p.341. The image method, therefore, relies on each filter section being terminated with the correct image impedance. This is easy enough to do with the internal sections of a multiple section filter, because it is only necessary to ensure that the sections facing the one in question have identical image impedances. However, the end sections are a problem. They will usually be terminated with fixed resistances that the filter cannot match perfectly except at one specific frequency. This mismatch leads to <b>multiple</b> <b>reflections</b> at the filter terminations and at the junctions between sections. [...] These reflections result in the filter response deviating quite sharply from the theoretical, especially near the cut-off frequency.|$|E
