5000|$|Subsurface flow CWs: {{the flow}} of {{wastewater}} occurs between {{the roots of the}} plants and there is no water surfacing (kept below gravel). As a result, the system is more efficient, doesn't attract mosquitoes, is less odorous and less sensitive to winter conditions. Also, less area is needed to purify water—5 - 10 m2. A downside to the system are the intakes, which can clog or bioclog easily, although some larger sized gravel will often bypass this problem. For large applications, they are often used in combination with vertical flow constructed wetlands. In warm climate, for organic loaded sewage, they require about 3.5 m2 / 150 L for black and grey water combined, with an average water level of 0.50 <b>m.</b> <b>In</b> <b>cold</b> climate they will require the double size (7 m2/150 L).

40|$|The {{effects of}} surface {{temperature}} and clouds on the CO 2 forcing are studied, based {{on use of}} the Colorado State University GCM. Results are reported {{from a pair of}} perpetual July simulations in which the sea surface temperatures differ by 4 K. The precipitable water is about 1. 5 times larger in the warm run. The increased water vapor concentration amplifies the radiative effects of CO 2, leading to greater CO 2 forcing in the warm run. <b>In</b> the <b>colder</b> run the globally averaged reduction in upward longwave radiation due to a doubling of CO 2 is 4. 3 W/sq m at the level of maximum forcing, or the 'CO 2 tropopause'. Above and below this level the CO 2 forcing decreases, resulting in a net tropospheric warming of 0. 033 K/day and a net stratospheric cooling. In the warm run the CO 2 forcing at the CO 2 tropopause is 4. 6 W/sq m, and is associated with a tropospheric warming of 0. 04 K/day. The clear-sky CO 2 forcing at the CO 2 tropopause is 5. 0 W/sq <b>m</b> <b>in</b> the <b>cold</b> run, and 5. 2 W/sq <b>m</b> <b>in</b> the warm run.

A second leaf was waved for 2 <b>m.</b> <b>in</b> water at 125o (51o.6 Cent.) and quickly examined as before; the tentacles were well inflected; the purple fluid in all the cells had shrunk a little from the walls, and contained many oval and elongated masses of protoplasm, with a few minute spheres. A third leaf was left in water at 125o, until it cooled, and when examined after 1 hr. 45 m., the inflected tentacles showed some aggregation, which became after 3 hrs. more strongly marked, but did not subsequently increase.

40|$|A key {{challenge}} in oceanography is {{to capture and}} quantify processes that happen on short time scales, seasonal changes and inter-annual variations. To address this problem the P&O European Ferries Ltd. Ship MV Pride of Bilbao was fitted with a FerryBox from 2002 to 2010 and data returned to NOC in real time providing near continuous measurements between UK (Portsmouth) and Spain (Bilbao) of temperature, salinity, chlorophyll-fluorescence and oxygen. Additional monthly samples were collected on manned crossings. Over 6000 samples were analysed for nitrate (nitrate and nitrite) concentrations. The timing of nitrate concentration increases (with winter mixing) and decreases (with the spring bloom) are different on and off shelf and in autumn nitrate concentrations remain high on the shelf. Off shelf in the Bay of Biscay, the mixed layer depth assessed using Argo floats, was found to vary from 212 <b>m</b> <b>in</b> relatively mild winters (such as 2007 / 2008) to 476 <b>m</b> <b>in</b> <b>cold</b> winters (2009 / 2010). Years with deeper mixing were associated {{with an increase in}} nitrate concentrations in the surface waters (~ 3 ?mol l? 1) and the increased vertical nutrient supply resulted in higher productivity the following spring. Bloom progression could be seen through the increase in oxygen anomaly and decrease in nitrate concentrations off shelf prior to changes further north on the shelf and phytoplankton growth was initiated as shoaling begins.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the process of}} metal-free star formation in the first galaxies with a high-resolution cosmological simulation. We consider the cosmologically motivated scenario in which a strong molecule-destroying Lyman-Werner (LW) background in-hibits effective cooling in low-mass haloes, delaying star formation until the collapse or more massive haloes. Only when molecular hydrogen (H 2) can self-shield from LW radiation, which requires a halo capable of cooling by atomic line emission, will star formation be possible. To follow the formation of multiple gravitationally bound ob-jects, at high gas densities we introduce sink particles which accrete gas directly from the computational grid. We find that in a 1 Mpc 3 (comoving) box, runaway collapse first occurs in a 3 × 107 M dark matter halo at z ≈ 12 assuming a background inten-sity of J 21 = 100. Due to a runaway increase in the H 2 abundance and cooling rate, a self-shielding, supersonically turbulent core develops abruptly with ∼ 104 <b>M</b> <b>in</b> <b>cold</b> gas available for star formation. We analyze the formation of this self-shielding core, the character of turbulence, and the prospects for star formation. Due {{to a lack of}} frag-mentation on scales we resolve, we argue that LW-delayed metal-free star formation in atomic cooling haloes is very similar to star formation in primordial minihaloes, although in making this conclusion we ignore internal stellar feedback. Finally, we briefly discuss the detectability of metal-free stellar clusters with the James Web...|$|R
50|$|Evolutionarily, bracken may be {{considered}} one of the most successful ferns. Bracken, like heather, is typically found in moorland environments, and is commonly referred to by local populations in the north of England as 'Moorland Scrub'. It is also one of the oldest ferns, with fossil records over 55 million years old having been found. The plant sends up large, triangular fronds from a wide-creeping underground rootstock, and may form dense thickets. This rootstock may travel a metre or more underground between fronds. The fronds may grow up to 2.5 m long or longer with support, but typically are in the range of 0.6 - 2 <b>m</b> high. <b>In</b> <b>cold</b> environments, bracken is deciduous and, as it requires well-drained soil, is generally found growing on the sides of hills.|$|R

METHODS: A prospective cohort study {{was used to examine}} divers from diving clubs around Lac Léman and Geneva University Hospital. The subjects were 215 healthy recreational divers (diving with self-contained underwater breathing apparatus). Main outcome measures were: measurement of global CBF by (133) Xe SPECT (single photon emission computed tomography); psychometric and neuropsychological tests to assess perceptual-motor abilities, spatial discrimination, attentional resources, executive functioning, and memory; evaluation of scuba diving activity by questionnaire focusing on number and maximum depth of dives and geographical site of the diving activity (cold water v warm water); and body composition analyses (BMI). RESULTS: (1) A negative influence of depth of dives on CBF and its combined effect with BMI and age was found. (2) A specific diving environment (more than 80 % of dives in lakes) had a negative effect on CBF. (3) Depth and number of dives had a negative influence on cognitive performance (speed, flexibility and inhibition processing in attentional tasks). (4) A negative effect of a specific diving environment on cognitive performance (flexibility and inhibition components) was found.

In this study, we assessed the spatial and temporal variability of alpine spring snowline across major Dall sheep mountain areas in Alaska and northwestern Canada. We used a daily MODIS snow fraction product to estimate the last day of 2000 – 2016 spring snow for each 500 -m pixel within 28 mountain areas. We then developed annual (2000 – 2016) regression models predicting the {{elevation of}} alpine snowline during mid-May for each mountain area. MODIS-based regression estimates were compared with estimates derived using a Normalized Difference Snow Index from Landsat- 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) surface reflectance data. We also used 2000 – 2009 decadal climate grids to estimate total winter precipitation and mean May temperature for each of the 28 mountain areas. Based on our MODIS regression models, the 2000 – 2016 mean May 15 snowline elevation ranged from 339 <b>m</b> <b>in</b> the <b>cold</b> arctic class to 1145 <b>m</b> <b>in</b> the interior mountain class.

The aqueous extracts of bark of M. tenuiflora have phytotoxic effects on seedling growth of lettuce, and in higher concentrations drastically affect the length of the root and shoot...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The cirrate octopods are deep-sea, cold-adapted {{cephalopod}} molluscs {{that are}} found throughout the world’s oceans, usually at depths in excess of 300 <b>m,</b> but shallower <b>in</b> <b>cold</b> water at high latitudes. The gelatinous bodies of the cirrates, which deform when preserved, coupled with low capture rates have caused considerable confusion in the systematics of the group. The taxo-nomically relevant morphological features are briefly reviewed and the taxonomy revised. On the basis of morphological and molecular information the cirrates are divided into four families, the Cirroteuthidae (including the genera Cirroteuthis, Cirrothauma and Stauroteuthis), Cirroctopodidae (Cirroctopus), Grimpoteuthidae (Cryptoteuthis, Grimpoteuthis and Luteuthis) and Opisthoteuthidae (Opisthoteuthis). A total of 45 species are recognised. The opisthoteuthids are primarily benthic animals, the grimpoteuthids and cirroctopodids benthopelagic and the cirroteuthids essentially pelagic, but generally close to the sea floor. With the exception of two common, shallow, Opistho-teuthis species, the biology of the cirrates is poorly studied. The data on reproductive biology indicate that spawning is extended, with growth continuing during a reproductive period that probably occupies much of the life cycle, an unusual strategy in cephalopods. Diet studies suggest that benthic cirrates feed on small-sized organisms with low swimming speeds and the main prey are amphipod...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Small towns <b>in</b> <b>cold</b> region {{own special}} {{ecological}} environment. Aiming at their particular climate characteristics, the green space system planning of small towns <b>in</b> <b>cold</b> region was studied. Through analyzing {{the problems of}} the green space system planning of small towns <b>in</b> <b>cold</b> region, the study proposes five levels planning strategy, including developing the regional integrated green space system planning of small towns <b>in</b> <b>cold</b> region, building the stable green network structure of town, improving quantity and quality of green space of small towns <b>in</b> <b>cold</b> region, strengthening winter landscape construction of small towns <b>in</b> <b>cold</b> region, and inheriting ice and snow culture of small towns <b>in</b> <b>cold</b> region, <b>in</b> order to promote the sustainable development of green space system planning of small towns <b>in</b> <b>cold</b> region...|$|R
50|$|This {{plant is}} quite {{variable}} in appearance, {{and it has}} been bred into a number of cultivars. In general, this plant is an erect shrub growing to 3 <b>m</b> <b>in</b> height and width, generally remaining smaller <b>in</b> <b>cold</b> climates. It can grow from ground level to 1.5 <b>m</b> <b>in</b> one growing season. It grows from a thick root system. The stems may be 3 cm in diameter. The leaves are each made up of three oval leaflets up to 5 cm long. The inflorescence is a raceme of up to 15 open pealike flowers, which are pink and purple in color. There are also cleistogamous flowers which self-pollinate and do not open. The fruit is a flat legume pod nearly a centimeter long which contains one seed.|$|R
