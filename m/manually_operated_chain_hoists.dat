2500|$|The {{river is}} crossed by two <b>manually</b> <b>operated</b> {{pedestrian}} <b>chain</b> ferries, these being the Hampton Ferry in Evesham and the Stratford-upon-Avon Ferry in Stratford-upon-Avon.|$|R
5000|$|The clubhouse {{is linked}} to Benn's Alley, a narrow [...] on the {{northern}} bank by a <b>manually</b> <b>operated</b> pedestrian <b>chain</b> ferry at the downstream end. Hampton Ferry connecting to Molesey operates {{to the east of}} the island using a separate set of steps or slipway and directly facing to St Mary's Church.|$|R
5000|$|The Stratford-upon-Avon chain ferry is a <b>manually</b> <b>operated</b> {{pedestrian}} <b>chain</b> ferry {{across the}} River Avon {{in the town}} of Stratford-upon-Avon in the English county of Warwickshire. The ferry is owned by Stratford-upon-Avon District Council. It links Waterside, roughly halfway between the Royal Shakespeare Theatre and Holy Trinity Church, with the water meadows {{on the opposite side of}} the river. The vessel used on the service is named Malvolio, after the character of the same name in William Shakespeare's comedy Twelfth Night.|$|R
50|$|Common small {{portable}} hoists are of {{two main}} types, the <b>chain</b> <b>hoist</b> or <b>chain</b> block and the wire rope or cable type. <b>Chain</b> <b>hoists</b> {{may have a}} lever to actuate the hoist or have a loop of <b>operating</b> <b>chain</b> that one pulls through the block (known traditionally as a chain fall) which then activates the block {{to take up the}} main lifting chain.|$|R
50|$|For a given {{rated load}} wire rope is lighter in weight {{per unit length}} but overall length {{is limited by the}} drum {{diameter}} that the cable must be wound onto. The lift chain of a <b>chain</b> <b>hoist</b> is far larger than the liftwheel over which chain may function. Therefore, a high-performance <b>chain</b> <b>hoist</b> may be of significantly smaller physical size than a wire rope hoist rated at the same working load.|$|R
50|$|A rigger is {{a person}} who specializes in the lifting and moving of {{extremely}} large or heavy objects, often with the assistance of a crane or derrick or <b>chain</b> <b>hoists.</b>|$|R
50|$|Steam shovels {{became more}} {{popular in the}} latter half of the nineteenth century. Originally {{configured}} with <b>chain</b> <b>hoists,</b> the advent of steel cable in the 1870s allowed for easier rigging to the winches.|$|R
50|$|B16.44- <b>Manually</b> <b>Operated</b> Metallic Gas Valves for Use in Aboveground Piping Systems up to 5 psi. This Standard {{applies to}} new valve {{construction}} and covers quarter-turn <b>manually</b> <b>operated</b> metallic valves in sizes NPS 4¼ and tubing sizes 1¼ O.D. These valves {{are intended for}} indoor installation as gas shutoff valves when installed in above ground fuel gas piping downstream of the gas meter outlet and upstream of the inlet connection to a gas appliance. The valves covered by this Standard are limited to application temperatures between 32 F and 125 F at pressures not to exceed 5 psig. This Standard {{does not apply to}} <b>manually</b> <b>operated</b> gas valves which {{are an integral part of}} a gas appliance. <b>Manually</b> <b>operated</b> gas valves intended for application to a particular appliance are covered in the American National Standard for <b>Manually</b> <b>Operated</b> Gas Valves for Appliances, Appliance Connector Valves, and Hose End Valves, ANSI Z21.15/CGA 9.1.|$|R
