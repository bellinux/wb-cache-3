Prior to the yield point the material will deform elastically and will return to its original shape when the applied stress is removed. Once the yield point is passed, some fraction of the deformation will be permanent and non-reversible.|$|E
25|$|Abdur Rouf Choudhury's novel Natun Diganta (three volumes: {{published}} in 1991, 1992, 1993 and complete collection in 2005 by Pathak Shamabesh) is a quality {{work of art}} by any standard and most successful writing on pre- Bangladesh Liberation War. Choudhury most vividly depicted the unity of Bengal and the articulation of Bengali nationalism in his novel Natun Diganta (New Horizon) (vols. 1-3). Reason and humanity – these are its two eternal pillars. The essence of Choudhury's thought is a complete faith in the efficiency of these two immeasurable forces. Its most striking characteristic is its insistent association of work, precept and practice. It appeals not to controversial tests, not to any appearance of sweet reasonableness but to trials in the rough and tumble of life, and it will accept no other judgment. Natun Diganta gives warning against: 1) dogma, mysticism, ceremonial, hypnotism, the binding {{of the mind and}} will by oaths, and other inventions of external authority in religion and politics, 2) participation in violence, individual or social, and organisation's dependence on violence, 3) exploitation, luxury and <b>material</b> <b>property,</b> 4) self-degradation and 5) devotion to self-sacrifice.|$|E

Methods: The researches were grounded on simulation of acoustic radiation energy at change of mechanically treated composite <b>material</b> <b>properties</b> dispersion for the mechanical model of its surface layer destruction. The data processing with definition of acoustic radiation statistical energy parameters was conducted. The analysis of acoustic emission energy parameters sensitivity to change of composite <b>material</b> <b>properties</b> dispersion, and as the analysis of influencing of composite <b>material</b> <b>properties</b> dispersion on AE amplitude and energy parameters was conducted. Results: Were obtained that at decreasing of composite <b>material</b> <b>properties</b> dispersion there is increasing an average level of acoustic radiation energy and value of its deviation. Is determined, that at decreasing of composite <b>material</b> <b>properties</b> dispersion the greatest increasing there is an acoustic emission energy average level dispersion. It is show that the increasing of acoustic radiation energy parameters advances increasing its amplitude parameters. Discussion: The simulation of acoustic radiation energy at composite material machining for the mechanical model surface layer destruction at decreasing of composite <b>material</b> <b>properties</b> dispersion (spread) is conducted. It is shown, that the decreasing of composite <b>material</b> <b>properties</b> dispersion does not influence on acoustic radiation energy nature change. At the same time, the ascending parameter, that describing of composite <b>material</b> <b>properties</b> dispersion decreasing, results in increase of acoustic radiation signal energy parameters. The obtained outcomes can be used at mining methods of verification, diagnostic and monitoring of composite material machining technological processes. Thus during the composite material machining is possible to control and to determine of composite <b>material</b> <b>properties</b> rejection by analysis of acoustic emission signal energy average level dispersion. </em...|$|R
40|$|Introduction The <b>material</b> <b>properties</b> of MEMS devices {{can greatly}} in- uence their {{mechanical}} behavior. If these <b>material</b> <b>properties</b> vary during processing, a given device can behave quite dierently than expected. A {{great deal of}} {{research has focused on}} detecting variations in <b>material</b> <b>properties</b> from test structures [8, 9, 3, 1]. Each of these methods relies on some simulation software to derive <b>material</b> <b>properties</b> from observed behavior. Unfortunately, most MEMS simulators lack generalized support for deriving <b>material</b> <b>properties</b> from devices, and designers are relegated to creating specialized models for nding specic parameters.

The emotional note of our parting on the occasion I have just related was not again struck, and when I went eagerly to see her again a few days later I was conscious of limitations,--not too conscious: the freedom she offered and which I gladly accepted was a large freedom, nor am I quite sure that even I would have wished it larger, though there were naturally moments when I thought so: when I asked myself what I did wish, I found no answer. Though I sometimes chafed, it would have been absurd of me to object to a certain timidity or caution I began to perceive in her that had been absent in the old Nancy; but the old Nancy had ceased to exist, and here instead was a highly developed, highly specialized creature in whom I delighted; and after taking thought I would not have robbed her of fine acquired attribute. As she had truly observed, we were both conventional; conventionality was part of the price we had willingly paid for membership in that rarer world we had both achieved. It was a world, to be sure, in which we were rapidly learning to take the law into our own hands without seeming to defy it, in order that the fear of it might remain in those less fortunately placed and endowed: we had begun with the appropriation of the <b>material</b> <b>property</b> of our fellow-citizens, which we took legally; from this point it was, of course, merely a logical step to take--legally, too other gentlemen's human property--their wives, in short: the more progressive East had set us our example, but as yet we had been chary to follow it.|$|E

60|$|No man, I imagine, would object more {{strongly}} than Euphorion to communistic principles in relation to <b>material</b> <b>property,</b> but with regard to property in ideas he entertains such principles willingly, and is disposed to treat the distinction between Mine and Thine in original authorship as egoistic, narrowing, and low. I have known him, indeed, insist at some expense of erudition on the prior right of an ancient, a medieval, or an eighteenth century writer to be credited with a view or statement lately advanced with some show of originality; and this championship seems to imply a nicety of conscience towards the dead. He is evidently unwilling that his neighbours should get more credit than is due to them, {{and in this way}} he appears to recognise a certain proprietorship even in spiritual production. But perhaps it is no real inconsistency that, with regard to many instances of modern origination, it is his habit to talk with a Gallic largeness and refer to the universe: he expatiates on the diffusive nature of intellectual products, free and all-embracing as the liberal air; on the infinitesimal smallness of individual origination compared with the massive inheritance of thought on which every new generation enters; on that growing preparation for every epoch through which certain ideas or modes of view are said to be in the air, and, still more metaphorically speaking, to be inevitably absorbed, so that every one may be excused for not knowing how he got them. Above all, he insists on the proper subordination of the irritable self, the mere vehicle of an idea or combination which, being produced by the sum total of the human race, must belong to that multiple entity, from the accomplished lecturer or populariser who transmits it, to the remotest generation of Fuegians or Hottentots, however indifferent these may be to the superiority of their right above that of the eminently perishable dyspeptic author.|$|E

A discriminatively trained regression model is then used to predict the physical properties of fabric from these features.
