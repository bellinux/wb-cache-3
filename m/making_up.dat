5|$|Bromine has two stable isotopes, 79Br and 81Br. These are {{its only}} two natural isotopes, with 79Br <b>making</b> <b>up</b> 51% of natural bromine and 81Br <b>making</b> <b>up</b> the {{remaining}} 49%. Both have nuclear spin 3/2− and thus {{may be used}} for nuclear magnetic resonance, although 81Br is more favourable. The other bromine isotopes are all radioactive, with half-lives too short to occur in nature. Of these, the most important are 80Br (t1/2 = 17.7min), 80mBr (t1/2 = 4.421h), and 82Br (t1/2 = 35.28h), which may be produced from the neutron activation of natural bromine. The most stable bromine radioisotope is 77Br (t1/2 = 57.04h). The primary decay mode of isotopes lighter than 79Br is electron capture to isotopes of selenium; that of isotopes heavier than 81Br is beta decay to isotopes of krypton; and 80Br may decay by either mode to stable 80Se or 80Kr.|$|E

5|$|Chlorine has two stable {{isotopes}}, 35Cl and 37Cl. These are {{its only}} two natural isotopes occurring in quantity, with 35Cl <b>making</b> <b>up</b> 76% of natural chlorine and 37Cl <b>making</b> <b>up</b> the remaining 24%. Both are synthesised in {{stars in the}} oxygen-burning and silicon-burning processes. Both have nuclear spin 3/2+ and thus {{may be used for}} nuclear magnetic resonance, although the spin magnitude being greater than 1/2 results in non-spherical nuclear charge distribution and thus resonance broadening {{as a result of a}} nonzero nuclear quadrupole moment and resultant quadrupolar relaxation. The other chlorine isotopes are all radioactive, with half-lives too short to occur in nature primordially. Of these, the most commonly used in the laboratory are 36Cl (t1/2 = 3.0×105y) and 38Cl (t1/2 = 37.2min), which may be produced from the neutron activation of natural chlorine.|$|E
