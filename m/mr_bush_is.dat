Miller had consistently voted with Republicans. In a Wall Street Journal editorial Miller cited that the reason for his defection was that, [...] "I barely recognize my party anymore." [...] He continued, [...] "Today, it's the Democratic Party that has mastered the art of division and diversion. To run for president as a Democrat these days you have to go from interest group to interest group, cap in hand, asking for the support of liberal kingmakers."

[...] Specifically, the assertions to which Wilson objected were Pinker's writing that (in Wilson's summation), [...] "George W. Bush 'infamously' supported torture; John Kerry was right to think of terrorism as a 'nuisance"; 'Palestinian activist groups' have disavowed violence and now work at building a 'competent government.'

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work is to design a {{semi-active}} magnetorheological (<b>MR)</b> hydraulic <b>bushing.</b> The semi-active <b>bushing</b> <b>is</b> intended {{to be used to}} isolate a cylinder deactivating engine. Cylinder deactivation causes high transient torsional loading in addition to changing the magnitude and mode of engine vibrations requiring an adaptive or controllable isolator. Practical and simple semi-active control strategies are inspired by investigating the optimization of linear and slightly cubic nonlinear single degree of freedom isolators. Experimental verification of the optimization technique, which minimizes the root mean square (RMS) of engine acceleration frequency response and RMS of the force transmitted frequency response, shows that this method can be implemented on real linear systems to isolate the engine from harmonic inputs. This optimization technique is also applied to tune selected model parameters of existing two degree of freedom hydraulic bushings. This thesis also details the development of a <b>MR</b> hydraulic <b>bushing.</b> The <b>MR</b> <b>bushing</b> design retrofits an existing bushing with a pressure driven flow mode valve on the inertia track. A new efficient valve design is selected and developed for the application. The <b>MR</b> hydraulic <b>bushing</b> <b>is</b> designed, mathematically modeled, and numerically simulated. The simulation results show that the <b>MR</b> <b>bushing</b> tends to increase the low frequency dynamic stiffness magnitude while simultaneously decreasing the phase. The next stage of the project is fabrication and testing of the semi-active bushing. The performance of the manufactured <b>MR</b> <b>bushing</b> <b>is</b> tested on a base excitation apparatus. Varying the current input to the MR valve was found to have a small effect on the response of the suspended mass. The results are in agreement with the effects demonstrated by the dynamic stiffness numerical simulation...|$|R

John Courtenay, who was later to write Conduct of the Dissenters in England (1790), raised the matter in Parliament, as a general feeling of unease about the issue began to become apparent. A legal counsellor in 1788 gave his opinion that if the writs had been correctly issued, there seemed no possibility of them being released from prison, unless their marriages could be made out to be Quaker, or their Roeite marriages could be made legal by a new Act of Parliament. In August 1790 Lord Kenyon, the Lord Chief Justice said {{that they could be}} released if they did penance, but the two sisters were not at all penitent and refused.

But <b>Mr.</b> <b>Bush</b> has not overcome some practical concerns about an invasion." [...] He concludes, after detailing five practical concerns about invading Iraq, [...] "So if <b>Mr.</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>were</b> really addressing these concerns, weighing them and then concluding that on balance it's worth an invasion, I'd be reassured.

[...] In a column entitled [...] "The Day After" [...] in September 2002, during a reporting visit to Iraq, he declared: [...] "In one Shiite city after another, expect battles between rebels and army units, periodic calls for an Iranian-style theocracy, and perhaps a drift toward civil war. For the last few days, I've been traveling in these Shiite cities—Karbala, Najaf and Basra—and the tension in the bazaars is thicker than the dust behind the donkey carts. So before we rush into Iraq, we need to think through what we will do the morning after Saddam is toppled. Do we send in troops to try to seize the mortars and machine guns from the warring factions? Or do we run from civil war, and risk letting Iran cultivate its own puppet regime?" ...|$|R

As a result, most evacuations and the mass exodus which ensued in the aftermath was done so by private charter through personal & Corporate expense, with or without official permission. It was also a collective decision within the government at that time to turn away two British warships that had arrived the day after the storm with supplies. This decision was met by outrage from the Islanders who thought that it should have been their decision to make.
