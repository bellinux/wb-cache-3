40|$|Background: In September 2015, Japan {{experienced}} an unusual increase in acute asthma hospitalizations of children that coincided with an enterovirus D 68 (EV-D 68) epidemic. The {{objective of this}} study is to investigate whether EV-D 68 had a causal relationship with the spike in asthma hospitalizations. Methods: A nation-wide retrospective survey of asthma hospitalizations of children was performed for the period from January 2010 through October 2015. The Japanese Society of Pediatric Allergy and Clinical Immunology asked its affiliated hospitals to report monthly numbers of hospitalizations, ICU admissions and <b>mechanical</b> <b>ventilations</b> due to acute asthma exacerbation. The data were retrieved from medical databases using predefined search criteria: diagnosis of asthma or asthmatic bronchitis, admission, and age < 20 years. Monthly numbers of EV-D 68 detection were also obtained from the Infectious Disease Surveillance Center of Japan. A Granger causality test was used to analyze the association of EV-D 68 detections for asthma exacerbation. Results: A total of 157 hospitals reported 87, 189 asthma hospitalizations, including 477 ICU admissions and 1193 <b>mechanical</b> <b>ventilations,</b> during the survey period of 5 years and 10 months. The numbers of these events increased drastically in September 2015. The Granger causality test verified the association between EV-D 68 and asthma hospitalizations/mechanical ventilations. The most-affected age group was 3 – 6 years old. Conclusions: The spike in pediatric asthma hospitalizations in Japan in September 2015 was found to be associated with the EV-D 68 epidemic. Respiratory pathogens can cause “epidemics” of asthma exacerbation. Coordinated surveillance of infectious diseases and asthma may be beneficial for prevention and better control of both illnesses...|$|R
5|$|Preterm newborns {{are known}} to be at higher risk for bronchopulmonary {{dysplasia}} with extended exposure to high concentrations of oxygen.

40|$|The real {{utilisation}} {{scenario of}} non-invasive ventilation (NIV) in Swiss ICUs {{has never been}} reported. Using a survey methodology, we developed a questionnaire sent to {{the directors of the}} 79 adult ICUs to identify the perceived pattern of NIV utilisation. We obtained a response rate of 62 %. The overall utilisation rate for NIV was 26 % of all <b>mechanical</b> <b>ventilations,</b> but we found significant differences in the utilisation rates among different linguistic areas, ranging from 20 % in the German part to 48 % in the French part (p < 0. 01). NIV was mainly indicated for the acute exacerbations of COPD (AeCOPD), acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema (ACPE) and acute respiratory failure (ARF) in selected do-not-intubate patients. In ACPE, CPAP was much less used than bi-level ventilation and was still applied in AeCOPD. The first line interface was a facial mask (81 %) and the preferred type of ventilator was an ICU machine with an NIV module (69 %). The perceived use of NIV is generally high in Switzerland, but regional variations are remarkable. The indications of NIV use are in accordance with international guidelines.

5|$|Guillain–Barré {{syndrome}} (GBS) is a rapid-onset {{muscle weakness}} {{caused by the}} immune system damaging the peripheral nervous system. The initial symptoms are typically changes in sensation or pain along with muscle weakness, beginning in the feet and hands. This often spreads to the arms and upper body with both sides being involved. The symptoms develop over hours to a few weeks. During the acute phase, the disorder can be life-threatening with about 15% developing weakness of the breathing muscles requiring <b>mechanical</b> <b>ventilation.</b> Some are affected by changes in {{the function of the}} autonomic nervous system, which can lead to dangerous abnormalities in heart rate and blood pressure.|$|E
5|$|Endotracheal {{intubation}} and <b>mechanical</b> <b>ventilation</b> {{may be used}} {{to ensure}} proper oxygen supply and provide a secure airway. Hypotension (low blood pressure), which has a devastating outcome in TBI, can be prevented by giving intravenous fluids to maintain a normal blood pressure. Failing to maintain blood pressure can result in inadequate blood flow to the brain. Blood pressure may be kept at an artificially high level under controlled conditions by infusion of norepinephrine or similar drugs; this helps maintain cerebral perfusion. Body temperature is carefully regulated because increased temperature raises the brain's metabolic needs, potentially depriving it of nutrients. Seizures are common. While they can be treated with benzodiazepines, these drugs are used carefully because they can depress breathing and lower blood pressure. TBI patients are more susceptible to side effects and may react adversely or be inordinately sensitive to some pharmacological agents. During treatment monitoring continues for signs of deterioration such as a decreasing level of consciousness.|$|E
5|$|Pneumonia, another {{potential}} complication, develops {{in as many}} as 20% of people with pulmonary contusion. Contused lungs are less able to remove bacteria than uninjured lungs, predisposing them to infection. Intubation and <b>mechanical</b> <b>ventilation</b> further increase the risk of developing pneumonia; the tube is passed through the nose or mouth into the airways, potentially tracking bacteria from the mouth or sinuses into them. Also, intubation prevents coughing, which would clear bacteria-laden secretions from the airways, and secretions pool near the tube's cuff and allow bacteria to grow. The sooner the endotracheal tube is removed, the lower the risk of pneumonia, but if it is removed too early and has to be put back in, the risk of pneumonia rises. People who are at risk for pulmonary aspiration (e.g. those with lowered level of consciousness due to head injuries) are especially likely to get pneumonia. As with ARDS, the chances of developing pneumonia increase with the size of the contusion. Children and adults have been found to have similar rates of complication with pneumonia and ARDS.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Spontaneous <b>ventilation,</b> <b>mechanical</b> {{controlled}} <b>ventilation,</b> apneic intermittent ventilation, and {{jet ventilation}} {{are commonly used}} during interventional suspension microlaryngoscopy. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate specific complications of each technique, with special emphasis on transtracheal and transglottal jet ventilation. METHODS: The authors performed a retrospective single-institution analysis of a case series of 1, 093 microlaryngoscopies performed in 661 patients between January 1994 and January 2004. Data were collected from two separate prospective databases. Feasibility and complications encountered with each technique of ventilation were analyzed as main outcome measures. RESULTS: During 1, 093 suspension microlaryngoscopies, ventilation was supplied by <b>mechanical</b> controlled <b>ventilation</b> via small endotracheal tubes (n = 200), intermittent apneic ventilation (n = 159), transtracheal jet ventilation (n = 265), or transglottal jet ventilation (n = 469). Twenty-nine minor and 4 major complications occurred. Seventy-five percent of the patients with major events had an American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status classification of III. Five laryngospasms were observed with apneic intermittent ventilation. All other 24 complications (including 7 barotrauma) occurred during jet ventilation. Transtracheal jet ventilation was associated with a significantly higher complication rate than transglottal jet ventilation (P < 0. 0001; odds ratio, 4. 3 [95 % confidence interval, 1. 9 - 10. 0]). All severe complications were related to barotraumas resulting from airway outflow obstruction during jet ventilation, most often laryngospasms. CONCLUSIONS: The use of a transtracheal cannula was the major independent risk factor for complications during jet ventilation for interventional microlaryngoscopy. The anesthetist's vigilance in clinically detecting and preventing outflow airway obstruction remains the best prevention of barotrauma during subglottic jet ventilation...|$|R

5|$|Tracheotomy {{consists}} {{of making an}} incision {{on the front of}} the neck and opening a direct airway through an incision in the trachea. The resulting opening can serve independently as an airway or as a site for a tracheostomy tube to be inserted; this tube allows a person to breathe without the use of his nose or mouth. The opening may be made by a scalpel or a needle (referred to as surgical and percutaneous techniques respectively) and both techniques are widely used in current practice. In order to limit the risk of damage to the recurrent laryngeal nerves (the nerves that control the voicebox), the tracheotomy is performed as high in the trachea as possible. If only one of these nerves is damaged, the patient's voice may be impaired (dysphonia); if both of the nerves are damaged, the patient will be unable to speak (aphonia). In the acute setting, indications for tracheotomy are similar to those for cricothyrotomy. In the chronic setting, indications for tracheotomy include the need for long-term <b>mechanical</b> <b>ventilation</b> and removal of tracheal secretions (e.g., comatose patients, or extensive surgery involving the head and neck).|$|E
