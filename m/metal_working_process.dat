In addition, bending is used in many sheet metal forming, such as deep drawing and stamping processes. Bending process is usually followed by some elastic recovery upon unloading, called spring-back. A static approach is described to determine new formulas for the bending force, the shift of neutral-axis {{and the value of}} spring-back, in V-die bending process. Due to friction force between the sheet-metal and the die edge, a variable neutral-axis shift is deduced in the elastic zone of the bending length. The amount of shift is, rapidly, decreased with the distance starting from the die edge, along the bending length. Based on the reflexive action in elastic zone, and the residual stresses, in elastic-plastic zone, the amount of spring-back is derived. As a case study, the obtained expressions are applied to compare the values of bending force and the spring-back in, previously, published experimental study on V-die bending conducted on two different die-angles 90 ° and 120 °.

40|$|M. Ing. In {{the design}} and {{analysis}} of components and structures, detailed information on the material behaviour and its properties is required. When a material is loaded dynamically, such as in metal punching, the material properties {{may not be the}} same as when loaded statically. This is known as the strain rate sensitivity of a material, which implies that properties such as the yield strength, tensile strength and ductility may vary with {{the rate at which the}} material is loaded. South Africa is one of the large stainless steel producing countries. Seventy percent of the known chromium ore reserves are found in the Bushveld Igneous Complex in the Northern Province and Mpumalanga. To compete on the global stainless steel market it is essential that the South African producers have all the relevant product information directly available. Considerable research has been performed on mild steel at different strain rates and temperatures[1]. Work has also been done on some austenitic stainless steels. Very little, or no work has been done in this regard on ferritic and martensitic stainless steels and on the proprietary alloy 3 CR 12 [2]. The aim of this thesis is to investigate the strain rate sensitivity of Types 304, 430 and 316 stainless steel, 3 CR 12 corrosion resistant steel and mild steel at different temperatures. To achieve this, tensile tests are performed. at strain rates between 10 's - 1 to approximately 100 s - 1 and at temperatures ranging from - 40 °C to 140 °C. Shear tests are also performed at various strain rates, to investigate the effect that material behaviour has on a typical <b>metal</b> <b>working</b> <b>process.</b> The results obtained show that all the materials tested are strain rate sensitive.

When performing these functions, they become contaminated with foreign organisms, causing coolants to lose effectiveness and develop foul odors. Hence, coolants are used only for a short time and then discarded. The practice of discarding and recycling coolants can be costly and troublesome. Many small- and medium-scale enterprises often dispose the used coolant and cutting fluids in an improper manner into the environment, often neglecting the consequences of such behavior. The wastes, if not recycled or treated properly before disposal, have negative impacts on the environment in terms of water, soil, and sediment pollution [3].

The most common materials for lightweight production are high and highest strength steel.

The Fraunhofer IPT developed the laser-assisted sheet <b>metal</b> <b>working.</b> Selective laser based heating of the part directly before machining softens the material locally. Thus the quality of the following cut can be increased, for example for shearing 1. 4310 the clear cut surface ratio can be increased from 20 % up to 100 % using a shearing gap of 10 % of the sheet thickness. Because of the softening of the material and thus the increased formability, parts with a higher complexity can be produced.

40|$|Abstract. Hot {{stamping}} of quenchenable {{high strength}} steels represents {{the most promising}} forming technology for the manufacturing of safety and crash relevant car parts. In such process, the manganese-boron steel 22 MnB 5 is homogeneously austenitized, formed and subsequently quenched in one process step, so that complex geometric structural components can be formed with an ultimate tensile strength up to 1500 MPa. Due to the high temperature, no lubrication is used during the process with consequent high wear and reduced service-life of the dies. Commercial available steel blanks usually present an Al-Si coating that has been specifically developed as a protection from oxidation and decarburization and, at the same time, has proved positive influence also on the decreasing the friction at interface between the blank and the dies during the forming. Although such coating is generally accepted as the only lubrication medium in hot stamping, its performances are considered not appropriate for a good lubrication. The paper presents the comparison of the standard Al-Si coating and a new Zn coating when applied to metal sheets in hot stamping. A novel apparatus to investigate the tribological conditions during sheet <b>metal</b> <b>working</b> <b>processes</b> is presented.

This process is easily observed while working a material (in <b>metals</b> cold <b>working</b> of <b>process).</b> Theoretically, {{the strength of a}} material with no dislocations will be extremely high (τ=G/2) because plastic deformation would require the breaking of many bonds simultaneously. However, at moderate {{dislocation density}} values of around 107-109 dislocations/m2, the material will exhibit a significantly lower mechanical strength. Analogously, it is easier to move a rubber rug across a surface by propagating a small ripple through it than by dragging the whole rug. At dislocation densities of 1014 dislocations/m2 or higher, the strength of the material becomes high once again. Also, the dislocation density cannot be infinitely high, because then the material would lose its crystalline structure.|$|R
40|$|The {{lubricants}} {{that are}} used today by Sandvik Materials Technology AB in the cold pilger process contain chlorinated paraffins. Due to environmental, economic and health reasons, these lubricants have to be replaced. The method for trying out new pilger lubricants today is full scale trials in cold pilger mills. The main aim of this thesis has been to investigate whether {{it is possible to}} evaluate pilger lubricants by using some standard laboratory tribological test methods. In addition to this, a review of published literature and a description of the cold pilger process in tribological terms have also been conducted. The literature review included the published work pertaining to cold pilgering in tribology related scientific journals and books. This review indicated that only very limited information is available in open literature and the survey was therefore broadened to include other similar <b>metal</b> <b>working</b> <b>processes.</b> The test methods that have been used are the sliding four ball test machine and the SRV (Schwingung Reibung Verschleiß) reciprocating friction and wear tester. The test specimens for the four ball machine were standard bearing steel balls. In the SRV tests, cylinder on disc and a ball on disc test specimen configurations were used. The cylinder specimens were manufactured from the tube material and the disc specimens were made of mandrel material. The balls for the SRV were made of standard stainless steel. In the four ball machine, both the wear preventive characteristics and extreme pressure properties have been evaluated. In the SRV Optimol machine, seizure and wear tests have been performed. To analyse the surfaces, Wyko 1100 NT optical surface profiler has been used. A more thorough analysis of test specimen surfaces was also carried out by using SEM/EDS at SMT. The results show that the SRV cylinder on disc and ball on disc seizure tests are very representative of the cold pilger process. The ranking of various lubricant formulations from these tests correlate very well to the ranking from the full scale cold pilger trials. The surface damage modes and material transfer in the tests correspond well with those observed in the actual process. The SRV wear test corresponds only to a limited extent and {{the reason for this is}} that the ranking of cold pilger lubricants is not based on wear. The four ball EP tests do not correlate that well with the real ranking. This is attributed to the use of different test specimen material in four ball tests as compared to that actual tube/mandrel materials and the test method may not reproduce the conditions prevalent in the cold pilger process. The four ball wear tests do not correlate at all to the actual ranking of lubricant formulations owing to the same reasons and also in view of the fact that the ranking is not based on wear.
