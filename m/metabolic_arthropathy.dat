40|$|Eighty-three {{consecutive}} {{patients with}} rheumatoid factor-negative polyarthritis seen during a 1 -year period were evaluated clinically, radiologically, {{and with the}} B 27 test. Patients with definite spondylitis, juvenile chronic polyarthritis, a collagen disease, a known <b>metabolic</b> <b>arthropathy,</b> or primary generalized osteoarthritis were excluded. The patients could be classified into two groups independent of any knowledge of B 27 testing. Twenty-five had a spondylitic "variant " syndrome. These could be diagnosed on clinical grounds, and included a male preponderance and a high frequency of B 27 positivity. Fifty-eight patients, who could generally be classified by American Rheumatism Association criteria as having definite or classic rheumatoid arthritis, included a female preponderance and a normal prevalence of B 27.

40|$|The <b>metabolic</b> <b>arthropathies</b> are {{characterized}} by the deposition of abnormal substances in or around joints. Certain features {{of some of these}} arthropathies and their significance have only recently been recognized and others have been insufficiently emphasized. An important group of conditions are the arthropathies related to renal failure and its treatment, namely, aluminum toxicity, periarticular calcification and crystal deposition, hyperparathyroidism, and dialysis-related amyloidosis. Crystal deposition diseases, specifically, gouty arthritis, calcium pyrophosphate deposition, and calcium hydroxyapatite deposition, are also reviewed...|$|R
40|$|Musculoskeletal manifestations are {{commonly}} observed in metabolic disorders. Here we review the recent literature on several <b>metabolic</b> <b>arthropathies.</b> Hemochromatosis should be suspected {{in patients with}} {{the sign of the}} "iron salute". Screening for this disorder by routine measurement of transferrin saturation appears to be a cost-effective procedure in white men aged 30 years or older. In dialysis arthropathy, radiologic lesions of the hand joints increased in size and frequency with the duration of dialysis. However, destructive arthropathy of the fingers is not necessarily related to amyloid deposition. In patients with dialysis-related beta 2 -microglobulin amyloid deposition, renal transplantation improved clinical rheumatologic manifestations but did not prevent progression of destructive arthropathies nor dissolution of amyloid deposits. In ochronotic arthropathy, spinal changes may resemble those seen in ankylosing spondylitis and can lead to cord compression. The presence of brownish-blackish rods in the synovial fluid is an unusual but useful diagnostic tool. Metabolic factors are likely {{to play a role in}} the pathogenesis of diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis, and recent studies have demonstrated elevated insulin and growth hormone but normal insulin-like growth factor- 1 levels in these patients. Other metabolites that may play a role in this condition include retinoids and bone morphogenetic protein- 2...|$|R
40|$|AbstractPainful wrist {{osteoarthritis}} {{can result}} in major functional impairment. Most cases are related to posttraumatic sequel, <b>metabolic</b> <b>arthropathies,</b> or inflammatory joint disease, although wrist osteoarthritis occurs as an idiopathic condition in {{a small minority of}} cases. Surgery is indicated only when conservative treatment fails. The main objective is to ensure pain relief while restoring strength. Motion-preserving procedures are usually preferred, although residual wrist mobility is not crucial to good function. The vast array of available surgical techniques includes excisional arthroplasty, limited and total fusion, total wrist denervation, partial and total arthroplasty, and rib-cartilage graft implantation. Surgical decisions rest on the cause and extent of the degenerative wrist lesions, degree of residual mobility, and patient's wishes and functional demand. Proximal row carpectomy and four-corner fusion with scaphoid bone excision are the most widely used surgical procedures for stage II wrist osteoarthritis secondary to scapho-lunate advanced collapse (SLAC) or scaphoid non-union advanced collapse (SNAC) wrist. Proximal row carpectomy is not indicated in patients with stage III disease. Total wrist denervation is a satisfactory treatment option in patients of any age who have good range of motion and low functional demands; furthermore, the low morbidity associated with this procedure makes it a good option for elderly patients regardless of their range of motion. Total wrist fusion can be used not only as a revision procedure, but also as the primary surgical treatment in heavy manual labourers with wrist stiffness or generalised wrist-joint involvement. The role for pyrocarbon implants, rib-cartilage graft implantation, and total wrist arthroplasty remains to be determined, given the short follow-ups in available studies...|$|R
40|$|Background The {{systemic}} {{nature of}} psoriasis and {{its association with}} <b>arthropathy,</b> <b>metabolic</b> syndrome and cardiovascular disease is well established. In contrast, the association between psoriatic disease and other autoimmune disorders is still {{a matter of debate}} and data available in the literature are scarce. Objective The aim {{of this study was to}} examine the association of common autoimmune diseases (ADs), specified a priori, in an Italian cohort of patients affected by psoriasis and/or psoriatic arthritis (PsA), referred to two integrated Dermatology/Rheumatology outpatient clinics, over a 3 -year period. Methods Five hundred and two patients, affected by plaque psoriasis, PsA 'sine psoriasis' or a combination of psoriasis and PsA and with a diagnosis of at least one AD, were retrospectively evaluated. Univariate and multivariate binary logistic regression was employed to identify possible association between psoriasis, PsA, psoriasis-PsA and ADs, by calculating corresponding odds ratios and 95 % confidence intervals. Results Patients with psoriasis or PsA may develop one or more autoimmune diseases during their lifetime, with a higher prevalence of most ADs in psoriasis subgroup. We demonstrated for the first time that the combination of psoriasis-PsA appears to be protective towards some autoimmune diseases. However, a gender effect should always be considered due to the different distribution of autoimmune disorders between males and females. Conclusion The new concept of psoriatic disease, focusing on genetic and molecular aspects which are at the basis of the pathogenesis of psoriasis and its related manifestations, extended the traditional idea of a disease confined to skin and joints. In this context, the multidisciplinary assessment of patients in the combined Dermatology/Rheumatology outpatient clinics would allow to identify early clinical and laboratory abnormalities not limited to skin and joint.
