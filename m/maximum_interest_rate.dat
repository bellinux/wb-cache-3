25|$|Japan has various laws restricting {{interest}} rates. Under civil law, the <b>maximum</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> {{is between}} 15% and 20% per year {{depending upon the}} principal amount (larger amounts having a lower maximum rate). Interest in excess of 20% is subject to criminal penalties (the criminal law maximum was 29.2% until it was lowered by legislation in 2010). Default {{interest on late payments}} may be charged at up to 1.46 times the ordinary maximum (i.e., 21.9% to 29.2%), while pawn shops may charge interest of up to 9% per month (i.e., 108% per year).|$|E
25|$|Since HELOCs are {{intended}} by banks to primarily sit in second lien position, they normally are only capped by the <b>maximum</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> allowed by {{law in the}} state wherein they are issued. For example, Florida currently has an 18% cap on interest rate charges. They are risky to the borrower {{in the sense that}} they are mostly indexed to the Wall Street Journal prime rate, which is considered a Spot Index, or a financial indicator that is subject to immediate change (as are the loans based upon the Prime Rate). The risk to borrower being that a financial situation causing the Federal Reserve to raise rates dramatically (see 1980, 2006) would effect an immediate rise in obligation to the borrower, up to the capped rate.|$|E

40|$|Observers {{routinely}} {{claim that}} the Japanese government during the high-growth 1960 s and 70 s rationed and ultimately directed credit. It banned investments by foreigners, barred domestic competitors to banks, and capped loan <b>interest</b> <b>rates.</b> Through the resulting credit shortage, it manipulated credit to promote its industrial policy. In fact, the government did nothing of the sort. It did not bar foreign capital, did not block domestic rivals, and did not set <b>maximum</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> that bound. Using evidence on loans to all 1000 -odd firms listed on Section 1 of the Tokyo Stock Exchange from 1968 to 1982, we show that the observed <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> reflected borrower risk and mortgageable assets, and that banks did not use low-interest deposits to circumvent any interest caps. Instead, the loan market probably cleared at the nominal rates. We follow our empirical inquiry with {{a case study of}} one of the industies where the government tried hardest to direct credit: ocean shipping. We find no evidence of credit rationing. Rather, we show that non-conformist firms funded their projects readily outside authorized avenues [...] so readily that the non-conformists grew with spectacular speed and earned their investors enormous returns. ...|$|R

The Court ruled in 1978 that a Federally chartered bank like First National could offer credit card services nationwide and the <b>maximum</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> to cardholders was that allowed by the State the bank was located in and not the customer's State.

40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{studies the}} effects of <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> {{restrictions}} on loan allocation. In 1714, the British government tightened the usury laws, reducing the <b>maximum</b> permissible <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> from 6 to 5 percent. A sample of individual loan transactions from a goldsmith bank allows us to examine how <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> restrictions affected loan allocation. Average loan size and minimum loan size increased strongly. Access to credit for those of noble origin improved, while it worsened for those with less “social capital”. Collateralized credits, which had accounted for a declining share of total lending, returned to their former role of prominence. While we have no direct evidence that loans were misallocated, the discontinuity in loan receipts makes this likely. Our {{results suggest that the}} usury laws distorted credit markets substantially. We find no evidence that they offered a form of Pareto-improving social insurance...|$|R
