40|$|A {{conversation}} with a friend, which likened human yearning to moths drawn to light, inspired my curiosity. I learned <b>moths</b> use the <b>moon</b> to navigate flightlines; a closer light may prompt them to over correct, clustering around globes before spiraling in free-falls. As the <b>moon</b> guides <b>moths</b> through sky, it guides fish through sea. These creatures trust instinct. Both of their forms begin with skeleton, end in scales—intricately armored, yet vulnerable to interference from the human environment. The same scales that flake in fingers compose eyes, fur, tongues and glands—inspiring my object material. Grains of sugar bond in layers constructing my insects. While boiling sugar to a cracking point, I scratch a drawing through the hard ground that films a zinc plate. I drizzle and mold wings and antennae from cooled sugar-glass by hand. An acid bath nibbles my drawing into the zinc. Reheated sugar glues bodies together. I dust the zinc with rosin, bathe multiple times to achieve desired tones. I suspend the insects to swarm around the viewer. I ink and wipe the plates, roll many times with multiple colors, run once through the press. The prints document process. They are static specimens, fossils flattened and preserved. The moths are pinned in their prime beside fish who reveal basic form. In the meantime, the objects process. They move and react, melt and drip, crack and break...|$|R
60|$|That {{wonderful}} smiling mask--the inscrutability of Youth--was laid {{aside by}} her at night. Sitting at her window, under the <b>moon,</b> 'a gold-bright <b>moth</b> slow-spinning up the sky,' {{she watched the}} darkness hungrily, {{as though it were}} a great thought into whose heart she was trying to see. Now and then she stroked herself, getting strange comfort out of the presence of her body. She had that old unhappy feeling of having two selves within her. And this soft night full of the quiet stir of the sea, and of dark immensity, woke in her a terrible longing to be at one with something, somebody, outside herself. At the Ball last night the 'flying feeling' had seized on her again; and was still there--a queer manifestation of her streak of recklessness. And this result of her contacts with Courtier, this 'cacoethes volandi', and feeling of clipped wings, hurt her--as being forbidden hurts a child.|$|R
60|$|That {{evening after}} dinner which he {{scarcely}} touched, after his cigar which he left half-smoked for {{it made him}} feel faint, he went very slowly upstairs and stole into the night-nursery. He sat down on the window-seat. A night-light was burning, and he could just see Holly's face, with one hand underneath the cheek. An early cockchafer buzzed in the Japanese paper with which they had filled the grate, and one of the horses in the stable stamped restlessly. To sleep like that child! He pressed apart two rungs of the venetian blind and looked out. The moon was rising, blood-red. He had never seen so red a moon. The woods and fields out there were dropping to sleep too, in the last glimmer of the summer light. And beauty, like a spirit, walked. 'I've had a long life,' he thought, 'the best of nearly everything. I'm an ungrateful chap; I've seen a lot of beauty in my time. Poor young Bosinney said I had a sense of beauty. There's a man in the <b>moon</b> to-night!' A <b>moth</b> went by, another, another. 'Ladies in grey!' He closed his eyes. A feeling that he would never open them again beset him; he let it grow, let himself sink; then, with a shiver, dragged the lids up. There was something wrong with him, no doubt, deeply wrong; he would have to have the doctor after all. It didn't much matter now! Into that coppice the moon-light would have crept; there would be shadows, and those shadows would be the only things awake. No birds, beasts, flowers, insects; Just the shadows --moving; 'Ladies in grey!' Over that log they would climb; would whisper together. She and Bosinney! Funny thought! And the frogs and little things would whisper too! How the clock ticked, in here! It was all eerie--out there in the light of that red moon; in here with the little steady night-light and, the ticking clock and the nurse's dressing-gown hanging {{from the edge of the}} screen, tall, like a woman's figure. 'Lady in grey!' And a very odd thought beset him: Did she exist? Had she ever come at all? Or was she but the emanation of all the beauty he had loved and must leave so soon? The violet-grey spirit with the dark eyes and the crown of amber hair, who walks the dawn and the moonlight, and at blue-bell time? What was she, who was she, did she exist? He rose and stood a moment clutching the window-sill, to give him a sense of reality again; then began tiptoeing towards the door. He stopped at the foot of the bed; and Holly, as if conscious of his eyes fixed on her, stirred, sighed, and curled up closer in defence. He tiptoed on and passed out into the dark passage; reached his room, undressed at once, and stood before a mirror in his night-shirt. What a scarecrow--with temples fallen in, and thin legs! His eyes resisted his own image, and a look of pride came on his face. All was in league to pull him down, even his reflection in the glass, but he was not down--yet! He got into bed, and lay a long time without sleeping, trying to reach resignation, only too well aware that fretting and disappointment were very bad for him.|$|R

5000|$|Much of {{the science}} fiction work of Jack Vance: the Big Planet duo, the Alastor trio, the Durdane tetralogy, the Cadwal Chronicles trilogy, the Tschai or Planet of Adventure tetralogy, most of the Magnus Ridolph stories, the Demon Princes pentalogy, and various {{stand-alone}} novels such as Maske: Thaery and short stories such as The <b>Moon</b> <b>Moth.</b>|$|E
50|$|Argema mimosae (African <b>moon</b> <b>moth)</b> {{is a giant}} {{silk moth}} of the Family Saturniidae. Similar in {{appearance}} to the giant Madagascan <b>moon</b> <b>moth</b> (Argema mittrei), but smaller, this moth can be found widely in Eastern Africa and more locally in Southern Africa, including near {{the east coast of}} South Africa. An adult can measure 10 to 12 cm across its wingspan and 12 to 14 cm from head to the tip of its elongated 'tail-like' second pair of wings. Its forward wings have a distinctive grey-coloured 'furry' leading edge, giving a very rough surface, presumably for aerodynamic reasons. Apart from the eye-like markings on its wings, the colouring and shape of the wings give the appearance of a piece of foliage, especially the 'tail-like' structures of the rearmost wings which resemble a dried out leaf stem - presumably for camouflage in its natural environment.|$|E

50|$|Eventually, Thissell {{solves the}} mystery by {{borrowing}} a slave {{from each of}} the suspects and determining their masters' mask preferences before and after Angmark's arrival. He succeeds in identifying his quarry, but is captured and forced to walk unmasked in public (the ultimate humiliation to the natives), while Angmark masquerades as Thissell by wearing his <b>Moon</b> <b>Moth</b> mask. However, the Sirenese turn on Angmark and kill him for the perversion of unmasking another man and, ironically, for Thissell's previous gaffes.|$|E

5000|$|Edwer Thissell, the new consul from Earth to {{the planet}} Sirene, has trouble {{adjusting}} to the local culture. The Sirenese cover their faces and heads with exquisitely crafted masks that indicate their social status (strakh) and mood. They also communicate by singing, accompanying themselves with one of a score of musical instruments, selected based on the social situation and feelings. Furthermore, errors of etiquette may prove fatal. Thissell is a clumsy musician and lacks confidence in the alien society, so he is forced to wear a lowly <b>Moon</b> <b>Moth</b> mask.|$|E
50|$|Another way {{in which}} Vance expands the usually narrow focus of most Speculative Fiction (SF) writers are the {{extensive}} details ranging from the culture of language, to food, and music.

50|$|The {{comet moth}} (Argema mittrei) or Madagascan <b>moon</b> <b>moth</b> is an African moth, {{native to the}} rain forests of Madagascar. The male has a {{wingspan}} of twenty centimeters and a tail span of fifteen centimeters, {{making it one of}} the world's largest silk moths. The female lays from 120-170 eggs, and after hatching the larvae feed on Eugenia and Weinmannia leaves for approximately two months before pupating. The cocoon has numerous holes to keep the pupa from drowning in the daily rains of its natural habitat. The adult moth cannot feed and only lives for 4 to 5 days. Although endangered in the wild due to habitat loss, the Comet moth is being successfully bred in captivity.|$|E
50|$|Hong Kong has a rich insect fauna. At least 6,784 {{species has}} been {{recorded}} so far and 700 additional species {{are expected to be}} found. There are about 240 butterfly species, including the beautiful Swallowtails and Birdwings (Troides helena and Troides aeacus). Of over 2,000 moth species recorded, the Atlas moth (Attacus atlas) is outstanding for its large size with wing span up to 30 centimetres, while the Chinese <b>Moon</b> <b>Moth</b> (Actias ningpoana) is eye-catching for its long hindwing tails. Endemic moth species include Athetis hongkongensis, Ugia purpurea, Athetis bispurca and Egira ambigua. The dragonfly fauna is diverse, with over 110 species recorded, some of which are endemic to Hong Kong. Hong Kong also has 235 species of ants, 17 species of praying mantids, 31 species of cockroaches, 6 species of flea, 78 species of mosquitoes and 124 species of grasshoppers. 4,583 species are known to be plant eating (phytophagous) and over 1,000 species are beneficial insects either preying on or existing as parasites over other pests.|$|E
40|$|Gene pools become {{subdivided}} {{because of}} many different reasons, but it is generally quite difficult to pinpoint the main factors contributing to that process. In each generation, individual phenotypes are confronted with changing environments and their fitness is assessed. If the bet to some variant proves correct, the prize can be a magnificent adaptive radiation; if wrong, extinction is the maximum penalty, because some choices may become irreversible. Systems formed by host plants and phytophagous insects are, a priori, very good candidates {{for this kind of}} studies. In this communication we explore the phylogeographic relationships between populations of the Spanish <b>Moon</b> <b>moth</b> Graellsia isabellae and those of different Pinus spp. hosts. G. isabellae is a montane species whose larvae feed either on P. sylvestris, P. nigra or P. halepensis, depending on the population. Attending to morphological characteristics, the species is subdivided into five subspecies, associated to different mountain systems. Our results indicate that the mitochondrial genomes of these subspecies are indeed differentiated, that the time of coalescence of many of the identified mutations precedes the LGM, and that none of the Pinus hosts offers a phylogeographic pattern completely concordant with the relationships observed among them...|$|E
