25|$|Canada had <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>offer</b> {{entrepreneurs}} and business risk takers. The population was increasing gradually, communications were advancing, {{and real estate}} was cheaper compared to that from across the river. Labour and materials also cost less in Canada {{than it did in}} the States. Walker looked into expanding over to Canada. Also with the expansion of America through the Great Western Railroad, trade opportunities opened up for businessmen like Walker. Walker ventured into Canada across the border from Detroit into what is currently known as Essex County. At this time, the population in this area was considerably smaller than that of Detroit merely consisting of small village settlements under the Township of Sandwich such as the villages of Windsor and Sandwich. Most of the land in this area was vast farm land. In 1856, he bought his first piece of land from the Labadie family through grandson Eugene Hall for £300. This transaction took place on December 22, 1856 using the British currency system that Canada was still employing at the time. A month later on January 24, 1857 he decided to acquire another 300 acres of land consisting of lots 95 and 96 for which he paid £750. Also on this day, he purchased yet another 104 acres for £250. The remainder of 1857 involved building on much of this land and Walker, still a resident of Detroit, often crossed the border to oversee the construction being done. His plan was to open a steam- powered flour mill, which didn’t exist in the area, and a distillery, in which he had very little serious competition. He also had his hands in the agricultural industry with owning cattle and hogs, as well as farming.|$|E

Ed Semrad called the game [...] "a worthy sequel that fortunately {{is better than the}} original", similarly noting the game's size as well as difficulty.

500|$|Maxwell's {{purpose in}} {{constructing}} this analogy {{was not to}} represent mechanical systems in terms of electrical networks. [...] Rather, it was to explain electrical phenomena in more familiar mechanical terms. [...] As electrical phenomena became better understood the reverse of this analogy, using electrical analogies to explain mechanical systems, started to become more common. [...] Indeed, the lumped element abstract topology of electrical analysis has <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>offer</b> problems in the mechanical domain, and other energy domains for that matter. [...] By 1900 the electrical analogy of the mechanical domain was becoming commonplace. [...] From about 1920 the electrical analogy became a standard analysis tool. [...] Vannevar Bush was a pioneer {{of this kind of}} modelling in his development of analogue computers, and a coherent presentation of this method was presented in a 1925 paper by Clifford A. Nickle.|$|E

2500|$|While Wolfram advocates simple {{programs}} {{as a scientific}} discipline, he also argues that its methodology will revolutionize other fields of science. The basis of his argument is {{that the study of}} simple programs is the minimal possible form of science, [...] grounded equally in both abstraction and empirical experimentation. Every aspect of the methodology advocated in NKS is optimized to make experimentation as direct, easy, and meaningful as possible while maximizing the chances that the experiment will do something unexpected. Just as this methodology allows computational mechanisms to be studied in their simplest forms, Wolfram argues that the process of doing so engages with the mathematical basis of the physical world, and therefore has <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>offer</b> the sciences.|$|E

His art shows the interiors of East End bars, where you get acquainted with the dark side of life. His art however isn't any 'social' [...] art of the arrogant, placarding character there was so much of especially during the 1920's and 30's. It's social, not in attitude or trend, but with objectivity and revealing sharpness in the human portrayal that sometimes seems almost brutal - repulsive, but sadly true. Yet it's, however always carried by compassion. Never by sentimentality. This involves a simple statement of: 'Such is man'. But from the ravaged features, and the gout-ridden limbs stiff from work there's still a notion emanating of how man should look like and could look like." ...|$|E
