[...] "Money and the Dispersion of Relative Prices", Journal of Political Economy, April 1981.Variability {{over time}} in {{aggregate}} indices of price level, such as the CPI, {{is often associated with}} a greater dispersion in relative prices at a point in time. To model this phenomenon, Zvi Hercowitz uses a variant of the celebrated Lucas-Barro island model. In a world where people have incomplete information, individuals are confronted with the problem of determining whether price changes in specific goods are caused by general price inflation or by shifts in the supply and demand for this good. In the Lucas-Barro island model perfectly perceived <b>money</b> <b>growth</b> should not affect relative prices. <b>Money</b> <b>growth</b> has to be unperceived to have real effects. Using data from the German hyperinflation, an equation that relates price change dispersion to exogenous unperceived money shocks is estimated. Zvi finds that unperceived <b>money</b> <b>growth</b> does affect price dispersion, as the model predicts, while perceived money has no effect. This paper derives from Zvi's thesis at the University of Rochester.|$|E

5000|$|With the {{exception}} of the first discount rate cut, most of the discount cut was closely motivated by international policy to intervene in the foreign exchange market. Despite aggressive monetary easing by BOJ, the US dollar slid as much as 35% from ¥237/U$ (September 1985) to ¥153/U$ (February 1987). Consequently, the move by the BOJ was heavily criticized since such moves appeared to influence the outcome of the yen, a much neglected domestic factor. As a result of such move, <b>money</b> <b>growth</b> was out of control. In the 1985-1987 period, <b>money</b> <b>growth</b> had been lingering around 8% before being pushed up to more than 10% by the end of 1987.

[...] This inflation growth was much lower than that of World War II, during which wholesale prices increased about 70 percent. While <b>money</b> <b>growth</b> was very high and volatile during World War II, averaging 18 percent between 1940 and 1946, the average <b>money</b> <b>growth</b> rate during the Korean War was 4 percent. In response to this growth in inflation, the government implemented price and wage controls.

40|$|This paper uses {{annual data}} for the period 1952 - 2002 to {{investigate}} the inflationary process in Indonesia within the cointegration and Granger´s causality framework. The empirical {{results suggest that the}} consumer price index (CPI), the stock of narrow (M 1) or broad money (M 2) and real permanent income form a weakly cointegral relationship for the complete sample period. This relationship remains broadly stable for several sub-samples, especially when the model is estimated with the narrow definition of money. Three testable hypotheses in particular are investigated: (1) Does the <b>money</b> supply <b>growth</b> Granger-cause inflation? (2) Does currency devaluation Granger-cause inflation? (3) Does inflation affect economic growth? The empirical results suggest that in Indonesia, there existed a bi-directional causality between <b>money</b> supply <b>growth</b> and inflation and between currency devaluation and inflation. For the complete sample period, the causality running from inflation to narrow <b>money</b> supply <b>growth</b> was stronger than that from narrow <b>money</b> supply <b>growth</b> to inflation. This result is consistent with the view that in high-or hyperinflationary economies, inflation does have a strong feedback effect on <b>money</b> supply <b>growth</b> and this generates a self-sustaining inflationary process. The bi-directional causality between currency devaluation and inflation was, however, weak or not so robust for the complete or any shorter sample period. On the relationship between inflation and economic growth, the results suggest that there was no causality from inflation to economic growth for the complete or any sub-sample period. ...|$|R

5000|$|At that time, the Fed {{argued that}} rising and {{variable}} inflation since 1965 was largely attributable to non-monetary forces {{such as the}} power of labor unions and oil price shocks, and {{had little to do}} with rapid <b>money</b> <b>growth.</b> Based on the principles of monetarism developed earlier by Milton Friedman, the SOMC blamed the Great Inflation squarely on Federal Reserve policies that featured excessive <b>money</b> <b>growth.</b> [...] The SOMC's principal message that persistent inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon has been widely accepted by central bankers and economists. That framework still forms the basis for the Committee's comments on and criticisms of Federal Reserve policy actions and strategy. Over time, the SOMC has broadened its focus to include issues relating to policies on international trade, exchange rates, and taxes, as well as the regulation of the U.S. banking and financial systems. [...] The SOMC continues to meet twice per year and maintains an active website that includes an archive of the SOMC's position papers and [...] "Core Beliefs" [...] statement as well as papers of its members.

He believed giving governments any flexibility in setting <b>money</b> <b>growth</b> would lead to inflation and therefore, the central bank should follow an acyclical monetary policy and expand the money supply at a constant rate, equivalent to the rate of growth of real GDP.|$|E

5000|$|The term [...] is {{the change}} in money {{balances}} (i.e. <b>money</b> <b>growth).</b> By printing money the government is able to increase nominal money balances {{to pay off the}} debt (consequently acting in the debt way that debt financing does, in order to balance the government's expenditures). However, the effect that an increase in nominal money balances has on seignorage is ambiguous, as while it increases the amount of money within the economy, the real value of each unit of money decreases due to inflationary effects. This inflationary effect from money printing is called an inflation tax.|$|E

50|$|Much of {{the text}} of the Federal Reserve Reform Act {{pertains}} to Congress leveraging its oversight power over the Federal Reserve to make it disclose its monetary objectives. Since Congressional Resolution 133 was passed in 1975, the Federal Open Market Committee had announced the long-term monetary aggregates of M1, M2, and M3. This policy was codified in the Federal Reserve Reform Act. Congress enacted this policy under the belief that the actions of the Federal Reserve directly impacted the business climate, and it wanted {{to keep track of the}} Federal Reserve's attempts to alter it. Leaders at the Federal Reserve who objected were not necessarily motivated by a desire for secrecy. Rather, they felt that disclosing the Fed's views made their plans more difficult to realize in the future, because markets would respond to the Fed's plans and alter the Fed's projections. In other words, certain market actors would use the Fed's disclosures to engage in profitable investments, which would alter market outcomes and neutralize the Federal Reserve's actions. Furthermore, the Federal Reserve argued that this benefit would accrue to a few individuals, which would not be in the public interest. This was the reason that the Fed regularly overshot targets for <b>money</b> <b>growth</b> until the Volcker years.|$|E
5000|$|Allan Meltzer has {{described}} the circumstances that led him, together with Karl Brunner, to organize the Shadow Open Market Committee, and has also chronicled the SOMC’s early history. When, in 1971, President Richard Nixon adopted wage and price controls {{in an attempt to}} reverse the acceleration of inflation, which by then had risen above 4 percent, Brunner and Meltzer wished to form a group of [...] "like-minded economists" [...] to argue against the effectiveness of wage and price controls as a tool for ending inflation and in favor of a gradual reduction in <b>money</b> <b>growth</b> as a preferred alternative. Together with William Wolman, Brunner and Meltzer chose the name [...] "Shadow Open Market Committee," [...] as a reference to both the Federal Open Market Committee, the Federal Reserve's monetary policy making arm, and the Shadow Cabinet as the group of ministers chosen from the opposition party within the U.K. Parliamentary system. The original SOMC featured twelve members, equal to the number of voting members of the Federal Open Market Committee, chosen from academic institutions, financial institutions, and nonfinancial businesses. Beginning on September 14, 1973, the group met semi-annually in New York City. John Allan of the New York Times described the first SOMC meeting and policy statement. The Committee urged the Fed to abandon its efforts to fine tune the economy, and focus instead on reducing the rate of <b>money</b> <b>growth</b> from 6 ½ to 5 ½ percent per year, as an initial step towards working inflation down to more acceptable levels. [...] In 1988, the SOMC moved its meeting location from New York to Washington. Changes in membership gradually occurred, with some former SOMC members leaving to accept high-ranking positions at the Federal Reserve. In this sense, Meltzer points out, the SOMC has functioned somewhat like the U.K. Shadow Cabinet, with its members rotating periodically into official policymaking positions. Original SOMC member Robert Rasche served as Executive Vice President and Policy Advisor at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis from January 1999 until his retirement in June 2011. Beryl Sprinkel, another original SOMC member, became Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers in 1985. SOMC member Jerry Jordan served {{as a member of the}} Council of Economic Advisors in 1981 and 1982 and as President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland from 1992 through 2003. Lee Hoskins served as President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland from 1987 through 1991; William Poole as President of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis from 1998 through 2008; and Charles Plosser as President and of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia from 2006 through 2015. [...] Anna Schwartz was the longest-serving member of the Shadow Open Market Committee. One of the 12 original members in 1973, Schwartz continued to attend and participate actively in SOMC meetings through 2010.|$|E
50|$|Quantitative easing {{may cause}} higher {{inflation}} than desired if {{the amount of}} easing required is overestimated and too much money is created by the purchase of liquid assets. On the other hand, QE can fail to spur demand if banks remain reluctant to lend money to businesses and households. Even then, QE can still ease the process of deleveraging as it lowers yields. However, {{there is a time}} lag between monetary growth and inflation; inflationary pressures associated with <b>money</b> <b>growth</b> from QE could build before the central bank acts to counter them. Inflationary risks are mitigated if the system's economy outgrows the pace of the increase of the money supply from the easing. If production in an economy increases because of the increased money supply, the value of a unit of currency may also increase, even though there is more currency available. For example, if a nation's economy were to spur a significant increase in output at a rate at least as high as the amount of debt monetized, the inflationary pressures would be equalized. This can only happen if member banks actually lend the excess money out instead of hoarding the extra cash. During times of high economic output, the central bank always has the option of restoring reserves to higher levels through raising interest rates or other means, effectively reversing the easing steps taken.|$|E

40|$|Traditionally, monetarists {{hold on to}} {{the belief}} that the task of {{monetary}} policy is always to stabilize the price level, and that this is to be achieved by controlling the money supply, such that the money supply grows at the same pace as the national output. In the real world, few central banks would adhere to such a policy. In general, they prefer a more flexible approach, allowing the money supply, whether broadly or narrowly defined, to have a range of growth targets. Thus, in practice, discretion is inevitable. No real central bank would be bound by rules in a mechanistic way. While it is true that inflation may be easily get out of hand if the <b>money</b> supply <b>growth</b> exceeds output growth significantly, interpretation of what is excessive <b>money</b> supply <b>growth</b> becomes difficult in the face of important changes in institutions or exogenous changes to the prices of certain important goods.
