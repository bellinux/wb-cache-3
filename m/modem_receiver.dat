40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{the design and}} software implementation of an under-water acoustic <b>modem</b> <b>receiver.</b> Communication links in underwater environments face several undesired effects. These include multipath signal reflections, inter-symbol interference, and channel fading. This receiver design uses a combination of time and spatial diversity inputs combined with an adaptive feedback equalizer to counteract those effects. The design is based on three modules. A front-end module demodulates and Doppler-compensates the incoming data. A channel combiner module receives data from one or more front ends for spatial diversity and combines repeated transmissions for time diversity. The data from each input channel is time aligned and stored in a 'job ' structure. The channel combiner also calculates tap sizes and locations for the feedback equalizer. Completed 'job ' structures from the channel combiner are then sent to an equalizer module. The modules are implemented in C language code written and compiled fo...|$|E
40|$|Abstract- User demand, {{standards}} and products for digital nomadic communications are evolving quickly. The combination of this changing environment {{together with the}} need for short time-to-market pushes for more flexible implementations. Software Defined Radios (SDR) have been introduced as the ultimate way to achieve such flexibility. The reduced energy budget required by battery-powered solutions makes the typical worst-case static dimensioning unaffordable under highly dynamic operating conditions. Instead, more energy-scalable algorithms and implementations are entailed to provide flexibility while maintaining the required energy efficiency. Particularly, energy-scalable implementations can exploit data format properties to offer different tradeoffs between accuracy and energy. In this paper, such a technique is developed and applied to the SDR implementation of a 2 antennas 200 Mbps+ OFDM (Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing) inner <b>modem</b> <b>receiver</b> on a C-programmable CGA (Coarse Grain Array) processor with extensive SIMD (Single Instruction Multiple Data) support.

40|$|Recent {{advances}} in embedded electronics have a remarkable {{influence on the}} health care system. One of the most important applications is to monitor the health care of the patients at anytime and anyplace. In the last two decades, many researchers have focused mainly on heart rate variability (HRV) measurements. Patient 2 ̆ 7 s heart rate variability should be continuously monitored to help them in case of emergency. Under these circumstances, patients are required to have a HRV measuring kit for a constant observation. The proposed project focuses on the development of a heart rate variability measurement system with the use of embedded electronics. This project consists of two systems: transmitter and a receiver side system. The transmitter section composed of sensor, amplifier, processing unit, and display unit, and transmitter module. The sensors, which are pasted on the body, are used to sense the electrical activity of the heart. These electric signals are given to an amplification unit. This amplification unit is designed with IC ADS 1293 to amplify and filter the signals, and also reduce the noise. The output of the amplifier is given to the processing unit. Here, the microcontroller is programmed to process the input signal, and calculate the heart rate. The output of the microcontroller is transmitted to the display unit. The display unit shows the current value of the heart rate. The continuous measurement of heart rate variability is done in the transmitter side system. In case of abnormalities, a GSM module is used to transmit the heart rate alert, which has been processed by the control unit, to the user 2 ̆ 7 s mobile phone and GSM <b>receiver</b> <b>modem.</b> In the <b>receiver</b> system, GSM <b>receiver</b> <b>modem</b> receives the data and processed with Visual Basic program to display, and, in the mobile phone, data is received and displayed as a text message.

40|$|Achieving {{effective}} through-water acoustic {{digital signaling}} (telesonar) requires {{an ability to}} adaptively accommodate a complex and possibly time-varying acoustic channel. Variable combinations of noise, interference, multipath, and motion impair real-world telesonar channels. When considering {{any one of these}} factors individually, performance degradation may be predicted from theory. But the combination of these factors can confound our theoretical predictive capabilities. A computer simulation of the acoustic channel is useful for developing telesonar waveforms and modems. The simulation directly drives the <b>modem</b> <b>receiver</b> with a virtually propagated analog signal, enabling us to test the performance of the synthetic end-to-end telesonar link. We have observed a close correlation between simulation-based performance and observed performance in at-sea channels exhibiting similar characteristics. The fact that telesonar performance is now quite predictable {{in a wide variety of}} channels is due, in large measure, to the use of channel simulation. The simulation presented here does not rely on physical modeling of the channel. Rather, it is based on the combination of theoretical multipath models (e. g., a Rician channel) with rapidly time-varying impulse response functions, where the statistics are derived from at-sea experiments or governed by values derived from independent physics-based models (e. g., PC-SWAT, Bellhop, etc). Noise and other additive interference are combinations of theoretical and stored data, and range rate-induced compression and dilation are incorporated...|$|E

40|$|Analog-to-digital {{converters}} play {{an essential}} role in <b>modem</b> RF <b>receiver</b> design. Conventional Nyquist converters require analog components that are precise and highly immune to noise and interference. In contrast, oversampling converters can be implemented using simple and high-tolerance analog components. Moreover, sampling at high frequency eliminates the need for abrupt cutoffs in the analog anti-aliasing filters. A technique of noise shaping is used in σδ converters in addition to oversampling to achieve a high-resolution conversion. A significant advantage of the method is that analog signals are converted using simple and high-tolerance analog circuits, usually a 1 -bit comparator, and analog signal processing circuits having a precision that is usually much less than the resolution of the overall converter. In this thesis, a technique to design the σδ converters for 70 MHz will be described. Impulse-invariant-transformation is used to transform a discrete-time (z-domain) loop-filter transfer function into continuous-time (s-domain). The continuous-time loop-filter is then implemented using a transconductor-capacitor filter. A latched-type comparator and a TSPC D Flip-flop are being used as the quantizer of the σδ converter. Two second-order band-pass σδ converters have been implemented in a MOSIS HP 0. 8 μm CMOS technology and a MOSIS HP 0. 5 μm CMOS technology respectively. For the first converter, at supply voltage of 3 V, the maximum signal-to-noise-and-distortion-ratio (SNDR) is measured to be 35. 14 dB, which corresponds to a resolution of 5. 9 bits, at an input voltage being 0. 17 V. The total current supply at 70 MHz is around 10 mA. For the second converter, at both supply voltages of 2. 5 V and 3 V, the maximum SNDR is measured to be 42. 0 dB, which corresponds to a resolution of 7 bits, at an input voltage being around 0. 2 V.
