It also determinates the effects and conditions of discharge. Selection of the “proper law” to adjudicate the <b>marine</b> <b>contract</b> is a difficult task in Admiralty Jurisdiction because {{the issue of whether}} enforcement of the maritime lien is allowed by international law may turn on interpretation of the law of the country where the litigation is. So, the question is over the priority of the law where the lien was created (lex loci), as opposed to the law of where the court exercising jurisdiction (lex fori).|$|E
50|$|They {{moved to}} larger {{premises}} in Warroch Street, Anderston, where {{they began to}} focus on marine work. In 1850 they obtained their first major <b>marine</b> <b>contract,</b> to supply the machinery for the tug ‘Clyde’. From then onwards the company grew in strength and rapidly earned a reputation for ability and at least equality to much larger and longer established firms. In 1855, the Inglis brothers provided the machinery of the large screw steamer Tasmanian, {{one of the largest and}} fastest vessels built up until that date. The success of the ‘Tasmanian’ caught the attention of William Mac Kinnon who established the British India Steam Navigation Company and the Imperial British East Africa Company. From that moment the name Inglis became synonymous with fine design and engineering. Success followed success and before long the Warroch Street premises had to be extended to cope with the increased scope of work and award of contracts.|$|E

40|$|Marine {{contractors}} {{deal with}} {{processes that are}} understood qualitatively but are hard to quantify. The amount of data available for these processes is ever growing, and so too the intrinsic value that lies within this data. Several data driven model approaches {{can be used to}} analyse this process data, one being a Bayesian Network (BN) approach. A BN is a statistical tool that has been used in previous research for predicting processes in the area of <b>Marine</b> <b>Contracting.</b> The BN approach is further explored in this thesis as a way to analyse process data. The objective of the research was to determine how a data driven model approach like the BN approach can be used to effectively analyse process data that drive everyday <b>Marine</b> <b>Contracting</b> practices. To this end, first a theoretical study was performed. Then the BN method is applied to three processes that are dealt with on a regular basis in the <b>marine</b> <b>contracting</b> practice. The first process concerns the wear of cutter suction dredger tools. The pickpoints that are used for cutting soil wear down depending on various parameters. Being able to predict this wear process is of high importance for any soil cutting project. The BN proved to have some predictive skill though the errors were quite large. This research it could not conclude if the predictive skill is an improvement on the currently used methods for geology- or wear prediction. The second process is the cliff erosion at the island of Lolland (Denmark). As part of a large tunnel construction project an erosion cliff is to be constructed with the purpose of supplying adjacent coast {{with a certain amount of}} sediment. The erosion cliff will be constructed in two phases. Using a data driven model approach, the first phase can be used as a pilot in which various construction configurations are monitored. This process data can then be used to feed a data driven model, like a BN, to optimise the construction of the second phase. The third process is the wave overtopping of coastal structures. A database with quite a lot of well-defined overtopping cases is readily available for feeding a data driven model approach. Several other calculation methods, based on the same data, are readily available as well. Due to time constraints, the actual validation of an overtopping BN and the comparison with other overtopping methods is has not been completed for this research. Concluding, the benefit of using a data modelling approach like the BN approach for the <b>Marine</b> <b>Contracting</b> industry lies mostly in the collection, storage and management of data. Well-defined instances (sets of process parameter values related to one single case) needed for feeding a BN is the most vital aspect of its benefit. These instances give a good handle on large quantities of available data. A BN’s main strength is that its structure in combination with the properly managed data is capable of holistically capturing highly complex processes.

5000|$|Living {{conditions}} on Guadalcanal {{were some of}} the most difficult ever faced by Marine aviation. Pilots and mechanics lived in mud-floored tents in a flooded coconut plantation called [...] "Mosquito Grove." [...] These living conditions led to most <b>Marines</b> <b>contracting</b> tropical diseases such as malaria, dysentery, dengue fever, or fungal infections. At night, Japanese warships would periodically bombard the airfield, and by day, Japanese artillery shelling frequently struck. The worst night of bombardment was on 13-14 October 1942, when two Japanese battleships fired more than 700 rounds of heavy shells into Henderson Field—providing cover for the Japanese Navy's landing of Marine and army reinforcements further west on Guadalcanal.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{remarkable}} {{growth of}} bio-based industry {{has led to}} a rapid increase in the bioprospecting activities. The marine biomes are a rich reservoir of unique life systems making them an attractive target for bioprospecting for identification and development of potential drug molecules for human therapeutics. Many of the drug molecules such as ara-c, trabecetidin and eribulin have been discovered from marine organisms. It is noteworthy that indigenous communities have developed, preserved as well as evolved the marine traditional knowledge from one generation to next. Pharmaceutical companies utilize marine life based traditional knowledge developed by the communities at various stages of drug development, unfortunately, many a times without having a mechanism of access and benefit sharing in place. One such example is the <b>marine</b> bioprospecting Fiji <b>contract</b> that illustrates the role played by Fijian community and the lacuna in access and benefit sharing mechanisms. The present study is an attempt to explore the mechanism of fair and equitable sharing of the benefits arising from use of marine bioresources with the local communities as marine traditional knowledge holders in marine areas. It briefly describes the various international conventions and protocols that emphasize on the development of fair and equitable benefit sharing mechanisms. The study proposes <b>marine</b> bioprospecting <b>contracts</b> that are based on mutually agreed terms among the key stakeholders (the State with the genetic resources, traditional knowledge holders and marine bioprospectors). <b>Marine</b> bioprospecting <b>contracts</b> eventually will need to be customized as per the legislation of a country because of territorial nature of law. Also, the <b>marine</b> bioprospecting <b>contracts</b> will differ from other bioprospecting contracts due to various unique parameters associated with the activity such as economics of deep sea explorations (expensive processes of exploration and sample extraction), continuous supply of sample, the jurisdiction of marine areas and traditional knowledge associated. The present study elucidates the concept of <b>marine</b> bioprospecting <b>contracts</b> by considering India as a case study emphasizing sharing of benefits with traditional knowledge holders as well as ensuring sustainable use of marine genetic resources by the pharmaceutical sector...|$|R

40|$|The <b>Marine</b> Corps <b>contracting</b> {{community}} continually refines {{its policies}} and procedures {{as a response to}} the changing environment it operates in. The objective of this thesis was to develop a permanent contracting command structure in order to maximize the training, education and potential of the military contracting officers. To accomplish this objective, this thesis identified the historical and statutory basis for government contracting, where billets for qualified <b>Marine</b> Corps military <b>contracting</b> officers exist and where they are currently non-existent yet in demand, and the roles and responsibilities of the <b>Marine</b> Corps military <b>contracting</b> officers. Based upon this archival research and interviews with members of the contracting community, this thesis developed a framework for a new permanent contracting command structure through the use of an integrated systems model. This model assists in creating more military contracting officer billets, standardizes the reporting and operational chains of command, promotes stability, growth and development, aids in boosting retention, and creates a path for career progression. This study is a proactive approach to the changing environment of contracting that will better prepare the contracting community to support the operational forces and lead the Marine Corps through the 21 st century.
