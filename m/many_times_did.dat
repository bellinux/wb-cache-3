2500|$|England {{took four}} fast bowlers; Frank Tyson, Fred Trueman, Brian Statham and Peter Loader, which Swanton thought was one too many, and the all-rounders Trevor Bailey and Ted Dexter. Tyson {{had been the}} decisive force in England's 3-1 victory on the {{previous}} tour, but had been dogged by a heel injury since 1955 and had played only intermittently for England ever since. Though still capable of blazing his way through many First Class cricket teams, Tyson struggled on the slow, plumb wickets used in the Tests. The outspoken Yorkshireman Fred Trueman called himself [...] "The Best Bloody English Fast Bowler That Ever Drew Bloody Breath" [...] and with considerable justification. He possessed a text-book side-on action which generated great pace and menacing late swing which was coupled with the fitness and stamina to bowl a [...] On this tour he was strangely subdued, he was overbowled {{at the start of}} the injury-struck tour and took just 9 wickets (30.66) in the last three Tests, but took 28 wickets (19.54) in his other matches. Brian Statham was the [...] "straight man" [...] of the England fast bowling attack, running up the hill and into the wind while Tyson and Trueman let rip from the other end. He maintained a nagging line and length, but [...] "George" [...] was regarded as an unlucky bowler, so <b>many</b> <b>times</b> <b>did</b> he beat the batsman only to see the ball miss the stumps by the thinnest of margins. He lived by two mottos, the first [...] "bowling in matches keeps me fit for bowling" [...] preferring a quiet cigarette to physical training or net practise. The second was [...] "if they miss, I hit", never more aptly demonstrated than in the match against [...] when he took 7/47 - six bowled and one l.b.w.. He was one of the few England players to have a successful tour with 12 wickets (23.83) despite missing the Fifth Test along with Peter Loader due to a car crash. Loader had been in and out of the England team and had toured Australia in 1954-55 without playing in any of the Tests. A fast-medium swing bowler with a wide range of pace and a nasty bouncer he took the first post war Test hat-trick in his 6/36 against the West Indies at [...] in 1957. He bowled consistently well and took 26 wickets (19.50) on the tour, but only 7 wickets (27.57) in what was to be his last Test series. Along with Tyson, Laker and Loader Trevor Bailey was on his final tour, but did not improve his reputation. A fast-medium swing bowler whose grudging accuracy mirrored his famously negative batting he could be very dangerous in the right conditions, taking [...] in 1953-54 and [...] in 1957 against the West Indies, but was mostly used for containment and failed on the tour. Ted Dexter was a late reinforcement and a capable swing bowler, but did not bowl in the Tests.|$|E

(Psa 106:23). Samuel is reckoned excellent this way, yea, so excellent, that when Israel had done that fearful thing as to reject the Lord, and choose them another king, he prayed, and the Lord spared, and forgave them (1 Sam 12). But yet neither Moses nor Samuel can save a barren fig-tree.

This was a very wicked, but open trade, in former days, and may in time come to be so again: fellows went about the streets, crying 'Brass money, broken or whole;' that is to say, they would give good money for bad. It was at first pretended that they were obliged to cut it in pieces, and if you insisted upon it, they would cut it in pieces before your face; but they as often got it without that ceremony, and so made what wicked shifts they could to get it off again, and <b>many</b> <b>times</b> <b>did</b> put it off for current money, after they had bought it for a trifle.|$|E

60|$|It is {{not half}} as {{innocent}} {{a thing as}} it looks, that shaking little pieces of carpet--at least, {{there may be no}} great harm in the shaking, but the folding is a very insidious process. So long as the shaking lasts, and the two parties are kept the carpet's length apart, it is as innocent an amusement as can well be devised; but when the folding begins, and the distance between them gets gradually lessened from one half its former length to a quarter, and then to an eighth, and then to a sixteenth, and then to a thirty-second, if the carpet be long enough, it becomes dangerous. We do not know, to a nicety, how many pieces of carpet were folded in this instance, but we can venture to state that as many pieces as there were, so <b>many</b> <b>times</b> <b>did</b> Sam kiss the pretty housemaid.|$|E
60|$|And {{yet they}} fear not God: alas! they believe not these things. These things, to carnal men, are like Lot's preaching to his {{sons and daughters}} that were in Sodom. When {{he told them that}} God would destroy that place, he seemed unto them as one that mocked; and his words to them were as idle tales (Gen 19:14). Fearless men are not won by words; blows, wounds, and killings, are the things that must bring them under fear. How many {{struggling}} fits had Israel with God in the wilderness? How <b>many</b> <b>times</b> <b>did</b> they declare that there they feared him not? And observe, they were seldom, if ever, brought to fear and dread his glorious name, unless he beset them round with death and the grave. Nothing, nothing but a severe hand, will make the fearless fear. Hence, to speak after the manner of man, God is put upon it to go this way with sinners when he would save their souls; even bring them, and lay them at the mouth, and within sight of hell and everlasting damnation: and there also charge them with sin and guilt, to the breaking of their hearts, before they will fear his name.|$|E

60|$|Such was my fixed resolutions; and {{accordingly}} I set myself {{upon the}} scout, {{as often as}} I could, till such time as I was heartily tired of it. I waited for above {{a year and a}} half, the greatest part of which I went out to the west, and south-west corner of the island, almost every day, to look for canoes, but none appeared. This was a very great discouragement; yet, though I was very much concerned, the edge of my design was as keen as ever, and the longer it seemed to be delayed, the more eager was I for it: in a word, I never before was so careful to shun the loathing sight of these savages, as I was now eager to be with them; and I thought myself sufficiently able to manage one, two, or three savages if I had them, so as to make them my entire slaves, to do whatsoever I should direct them, and prevent their being able at any time to do me any mischief. <b>Many</b> <b>times</b> <b>did</b> I used to please myself with these thoughts, with long and ardent expectations; but nothing presenting, all my deep projected schemes and numerous fancies vanished away, as though, while I retained such thoughts, the decrees of Providence was such, that no savages were to come near me.|$|E

But suppose God deals not {{either of}} these ways with the backslider, but shines upon him again, and seals up to him the {{remission}} of his sins a second time, saying, [...] "I will heal their backslidings, and love them freely," [...] what will the soul do now? Surely it will walk humbly now, and holily all its days. It will never backslide again, will it? It may happen it will not, it may happen it will; {{it is just as}} his God keeps him; for although his sins are of himself, his standing is of God; I say, his standing, while he stands, and his recovery, if he falls, are both of God; wherefore, if God leaves him a little, the next gap he finds, away he is gone again. [...] "My people," [...] says God, [...] "are bent to backsliding from me." [...] How <b>many</b> <b>times</b> <b>did</b> David backslide; yea, Jehoshaphat and Peter! (2 Sam 11,24; 2 Chron 19:1-3; 20:1-5; Matt 26:69-71; Gal 2:11-13). As also in the third of Jeremiah it is said, [...] "But thou hast played the harlot with many lovers, yet return unto me, saith the Lord" [...] (verse 1). Here is grace! So many time as the soul backslides, so many times God brings him again--I mean, the soul that must be saved by grace--he renews his pardons, and multiplies them.

On she worked, regardless of choking, blinding smoke--regardless of the glare of flame--never driven from the field but by a deluge from a fire-engine; when stumbling down-stairs, guided by the banisters, she finally dismayed her father, who thought her long ago in safety, by emerging from the house, dragging after her a marble-topped chess table, when half the upper windows were flashing with flame.|$|E
