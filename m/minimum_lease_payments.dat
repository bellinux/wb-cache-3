5000|$|The {{present value}} of the <b>minimum</b> <b>lease</b> <b>payments</b> (MLP) is {{equal to or greater}} than 90% of the fair market value of leased property. To {{understand}} and apply this criterion, you need familiarize yourself with what is included in the <b>minimum</b> <b>lease</b> <b>payments</b> and how the present value is calculated. The <b>minimum</b> <b>lease</b> <b>payments</b> include the minimum rental payments minus any executory cost, the guaranteed residual value, the bargain purchase option, and any penalty for failure to renew or extend the lease. The amount calculated is then discounted using the lessee’s incremental borrowing rate. However, if the lessee knows the implicit rate used by the lessor and the rate is less than the lessee’s rate, the lessee should use the lessor’s rate to discount the minimum lease payment.|$|E

And while it's fully negotiable, a credit {{in the range of}} 15%-25% is often offered. So, for example, if fair market rent for that unit would be $1,000, the seller might charge $1,100 with $200 of that being credited toward the purchase price.|$|R

50|$|Under American and British {{accounting}} rules, {{a finance}} lease is generally defined {{as one in}} which the lessor receives substantially all rights of ownership, or in which the present value of the <b>minimum</b> <b>lease</b> <b>payments</b> {{for the duration of the}} lease exceeds 90% of the fair market value of the aircraft. If a lease is defined as a finance lease, it must be counted as an asset of the company, in contrast to an operating lease which only affects the company's cash flow.|$|E
40|$|Leases {{may include}} a {{residual}} value or first-loss guarantee (Guarantee) by the lessee of the leased property. Those Guarantees {{are used by}} lessors {{as a means of}} transferring some of the risks in the property to the lessee and of ensuring that the lessor receives a return on and of its investment. Paragraph 5 (j) of Statement 13 includes Guarantees in <b>minimum</b> <b>lease</b> <b>payments</b> for purposes of determining the classification of leases. As discussed in paragraph 25 of Statement 13, the 90 percent test in paragraph 7 (d) of Statement 13 is not applicable to a lease of land only, and thus a Guarantee would not be considered in determining the classification of a lease of land only. However, for a lease of both land and building(s), applying paragraph 26 (b) of Statement 13 results in a Guarantee being included in <b>minimum</b> <b>lease</b> <b>payments</b> for purposes of performing the 90 percent test in paragraph 7 (d) of Statement 13. If the fair value of the land is 25 {{percent or more of the}} total fair value of the leased property at the inception of the lease, paragraph 26 (b) (ii) of Statement 13 requires that the lease be separated into its land and building components for purposes of applying the economic Copyright © 1992, Financial Accounting Standards Board Not for redistributio...|$|E

For purposes of classifying the lease as an operating lease or a sales-type lease, the consensus states that the <b>minimum</b> <b>lease</b> <b>payments</b> (as defined in paragraph 5 of Statement 13) should be calculated as {{the difference between the}} proceeds upon the equipment's initial transfer and the amount of the residual value guarantee to the purchaser as of the first exercise date of the guarantee. 2. The Status section of Issue 95 - 1 was updated to reflect the issuance of Interpretation 45, which partially nullified Issue 95 - 1. The effect of that partial nullification is that manufacturers will continue to apply the principles of Statement 13 to transactions within the scope of Issue 95 - 1 and will continue to apply the provisions of Issue 95 - 1 in determining "minimum lease payments.

40|$|Subsidiary S (seller-lessee), a {{subsidiary}} of Company A, enters into a sale-leaseback transaction for a building with Company B (buyer-lessor). Company B requires Company A to provide an unsecured guarantee of the <b>lease</b> <b>payments.</b> The transaction otherwise meets all of the provisions under Statement 98 for Subsidiary S to use sale-leaseback accounting. The issue is whether Company A's unsecured guarantee of Subsidiary S's <b>lease</b> <b>payments</b> {{is a form of}} continuing involvement that precludes the application of sale-leaseback accounting under Statement 98 in (1) Subsidiary S's separate financial statements and (2) Company A's consolidated financial statements. EITF DISCUSSION The Task Force expressed the view that an entity's unsecured guarantee of its own <b>lease</b> <b>payments</b> is not a form of continuing involvement that precludes sale-leaseback accounting under Statement 98 because such a guarantee does not provide the buyer-lessor with additional collateral that reduces the buyer-lessor's risk of loss, except in the event of the seller-lessee's bankruptcy.

Prior to the expiration of the original lease term, the lessee and lessor agree to modify the lease by shortening the lease term and increasing the <b>lease</b> <b>payments</b> over the shortened lease period.

The issue is how the adjustment to the lease term {{and the increase in}} the <b>lease</b> <b>payments</b> over the shortened lease period should be accounted for. EITF DISCUSSION The Task Force reached a consensus that the treatment of the increase in the <b>lease</b> <b>payments</b> over the shortened lease period is a matter of judgment that depends on the relevant facts and circumstances. If the increase is, in substance, only a modification of future <b>lease</b> <b>payments,</b> the increase should be accounted for prospectively over the term of the modified lease.
