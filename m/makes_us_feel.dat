500|$|It was {{followed}} that {{year by the}} neo-noir crime thriller Mulholland Falls, which featured the murder of Allison Pond (Connelly), mistress of General Timms (John Malkovich), and the investigation {{by a group of}} detectives led by Maxwell Hoover (Nick Nolte). New York magazine wrote about a clip that reveals the link between Timms and Pond: [...] "This footage is actually dirty. That is, it <b>makes</b> <b>us</b> <b>feel</b> like voyeurs when looking at it, but it's so juicily erotic that we can hardly look away". About nudity in the movie, Connelly said: [...] "It kind of shocked everyone who knows me that I wound up doing this movie, because I had always been so careful about nudity, it was {{very much a part of}} this character and I couldn't be coy or guarded or self-conscious--otherwise it wouldn't work. It was sort of a challenge I wanted to take on, I guess".|$|E
500|$|The film conveys {{what some}} viewers have {{described}} as {{a sense of the}} sublime and numinous. Roger Ebert writes in his essay on 2001 in The Great Movies: [...] In a book on architecture, Gregory Caicco writes that Space Odyssey illustrates how our quest for space is motivated by two contradictory desires, a [...] "desire for the sublime" [...] characterized by a need to encounter something totally other than ourselves—"something numinous"—and the conflicting desire for a beauty that <b>makes</b> <b>us</b> <b>feel</b> no longer [...] "lost in space," [...] but at home. Similarly, an article in The Greenwood Encyclopedia of Science Fiction and Fantasy, titled [...] "Sense of Wonder," [...] describes how 2001 creates a [...] "numinous sense of wonder" [...] by portraying a universe that inspires a sense of awe, which {{at the same time we}} feel we can understand. Christopher Palmer wrote that there exists in the film a coexistence of [...] "the sublime and the banal," [...] as the film implies that to get into space, mankind had to suspend the [...] "sense of wonder" [...] that motivated him to explore space to begin with.|$|E

500|$|In April 2014, Minaj {{posted a}} picture on Instagram of herself with Soulja Boy in a studio. Later that month, he posted a Vine of him singing the song's chorus. Originally, Joseph DaVinci & Soulja Boy created the song's beat but {{according}} to him, it lacked a hook. However, he later {{came up with the}} idea for the hook while making a Vine, and added it into the song. He then brought the unfinished version of [...] "Yasss Bish" [...] to Minaj, who was impressed by the song and recorded her vocals. After Minaj sent the track back to him, it took [...] "about a day" [...] for Soulja Boy to finish mixing the record. In May 2014, Minaj spoke of the meaning behind the word [...] "yasss": [...] "When I watch RuPaul's Drag Race,' I live for the way they speak. Females, we adopted it and it <b>makes</b> <b>us</b> <b>feel</b> like very cocky and very just like sexy and feminine. So saying 'yass' as opposed to 'yes,' it's just putting on a billion times more attitude to the word 'yes'." [...] On May 3, 2014, Minaj posted the song on her official SoundCloud shortly after midnight.|$|E
500|$|Bob Boilen of NPR wrote, [...] "I simply couldn't {{believe my}} eyes and ears. Seeing Jackie Evancho sing {{for the first time}} is nearly beyond belief." [...] He called her voice [...] "beyond-beautiful" [...] when she {{performed}} [...] "for a stunned audience at the NPR Music offices. She clearly is a very happy girl with an amazing musical gift." [...] A review of her 2011 Sun Valley concert stated that [...] "Evancho transported [...] with pure, joyous, unaffected notes". Marcia Adair of the Los Angeles Times commented in reviewing Dream With Me that [...] "her voice has matured quite a lot over the past 10 months. ... hat <b>makes</b> <b>us</b> <b>feel</b> like she will survive the journey from child star to adult performer is her magnificent sense of pitch, her natural ability to shape phrases and the ease with which she performs." [...] Jon Caramanica, in The New York Times, reviewed her Avery Fisher Hall concert: [...] "In {{the first half of the}} show Ms. Evancho often receded, but toward the end of the night she found purpose, delivering 'A Time for Us' with punch, and closing out Sarah McLachlan’s 'Angel' with what felt like real yearning". The Wall Street Journal called Evancho's 2011 performance of the song [...] "Angel" [...] on the Tonight Show [...] "moving".|$|E
500|$|Diamond Rio {{released}} its twenty-third official chart single, [...] "Stuff", in May 2000. The song was {{originally intended to}} be the title track to their sixth studio album, {{which would have been}} released on August 22 of the same year, but according to Truman, [...] "Certain radio stations, for some reason, didn't want to play 'Stuff'." [...] As a result, [...] "Stuff" [...] was withdrawn after peaking at number 36 on the country charts, and the album was delayed until February 2001. Following this song's failure, the band released [...] "One More Day" [...] later in 2000. The song was written by Steven Dale Jones and Bobby Tomberlin, the same two writers who wrote [...] "She Misses Him on Sunday the Most". [...] "One More Day" [...] went on to spend two non-consecutive weeks at No.1 on the country charts, with the album, by this point re-titled One More Day, having its release date moved up to February 6, 2001. The song also peaked at No.29 on the Billboard Hot 100, in addition to reaching top 10 on the Adult Contemporary charts (the band's first appearance on that chart). Regarding the song's popularity among fans who have used the song to cope with personal losses, Prout said, [...] "Actually, 'One More Day' was recorded as a love song. Then one of Oklahoma State's basketball team's plane went down, then in early 2001 we lost Dale [...] in Daytona, and then of course, 9/11 came after that. And every event of that year, the song took on a different meaning to different people... We hear quite often in e-mails and people talking to us in shows. If you're asking how it <b>makes</b> <b>us</b> <b>feel?</b> Pretty darn special... to know that you had that impact on someone's life and helped in a tough time of healing and hope." ...|$|E

Team director Wasim Akram shared that the third season of PSL [...] "will be a treat for the crowd which will now get to see more home games".|$|E
2500|$|In May 2016, Keys {{initiated}} a #NoMakeup movement, where she wrote on Lenny [...] "Before I started my new album, I wrote {{a list of}} all the things that I was sick of. And one was how much women are brainwashed into feeling like we have to be skinny, or sexy, or desirable, or perfect. One of the many things I was tired of was the constant judgment of women. The constant stereotyping through every medium that <b>makes</b> <b>us</b> <b>feel</b> like being a normal size is not normal, and heaven forbid if you're plus-size. Or the constant message that being sexy means being naked". Keys presented her movement at various events, and received a range of both complimentary and critical responses.|$|E
2500|$|The Times commented, [...] "there is another, sweeter side to her travails. [...] Miranda loves singing and, despite – {{or perhaps}} because of – the satire, becomes an {{evocation}} of something all humans love to do and have done since before we discovered language. The very act of singing, however dire the sound, <b>makes</b> <b>us</b> <b>feel</b> good." [...] Ballinger noted that the TV show Glee (to which Miranda submitted an [...] "audition" [...] in 2010) is causing a resurgence of interest in singing in schools: [...] "Everyone is talking about Glee and choirs and musical theatre, igniting a flame that has been dimmed for a long time. ... Live performance and musical theatre were almost a lost art ... people need to be reminded that it takes a lot more effort to sing than just watching movies or TV shows." [...] Miranda followed up on this idea, saying: [...] "Since I became so famous ... everyone is watching more music and singing more – because everyone wants to be more like me." [...] As the Miranda character matured, its popularity grew especially with younger audiences of the Glee generation, with most of those attending her concerts being teenagers or in their twenties. Ballinger says that she gets the most satisfaction from her live performances.|$|E

2500|$|In early 1889, Damala reappeared at Bernhardt's door haggard, ill, and penniless. Bernhardt {{instantly}} forgave him, {{and offered}} him {{the role of}} Armand Duval in a new production of Dame aux Camélias at the Variétés. They performed together from 18 May until 30 June. He looked exhausted and old, confused his diction, and forgot his lines. The critic for Le Rappel wrote: [...] "Where is, alas, the handsome Armand Duval who was presented to us {{for the first time}} a few years ago at the Gaiéte?" [...] The critic Francisque Sarcey wrote simply, [...] "he <b>makes</b> <b>us</b> <b>feel</b> sick." [...] When his contract ended, he was able to get another contract as an actor at a different theater, and continued to harass Bernhardt. He attended one of her performances sitting in the first row, and made faces at her. Her current lover, Philippe Garnier, saw him and beat him. Later, he entered her house and ravaged the furniture. Bernhardt was a Roman Catholic, and did not want to divorce him. He continued to act, sometimes with success, particularly in a play by Georges Ohnet, Le Maître des Forges, in 1883. However, his morphine addiction continued to worsen. In August 1889, Bernhardt learned that he taken an overdose of morphine in Marseille. She hurried to his bedside and nursed him until he died on 18 August 1889, at the age of 34. He was buried in Athens. Bernhardt sent a bust she had made of him to be placed on his tomb, and when she toured in the Balkans, always made a detour to visit his grave. Until the end of her life, she continued to sign official documents as [...] "Sarah Bernhardt, widow of Damala".|$|E
