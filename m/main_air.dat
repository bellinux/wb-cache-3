5|$|After the war ended, {{the airport}} was initial {{taken over by}} the Royal Air Force, but they soon withdrew leaving the Norwegian {{military}} in charge. Numerous squadrons, including 332, 331 and 337 were stationed at Værnes in the post-war years. In 1952, the pilot school was moved to Værnes, but in 1954 Ørland <b>Main</b> <b>Air</b> Station became the <b>main</b> <b>air</b> force base in Central Norway, and the majority of the armed air forces (with the exception of the school) moved to Ørland.|$|E

5|$|The Norwegian Ministry of Justice owns 12 Mk43B Sea Kings {{which are}} {{operated}} by the Royal Norwegian Air Forces's 330 Squadron. The aircraft are used for SAR and air ambulance missions and are {{under the command of}} the Joint Rescue Coordination Centre of Southern Norway and Northern Norway. Introduced in May 1973, they were originally stationed at Bodø <b>Main</b> <b>Air</b> Station, Ørland <b>Main</b> <b>Air</b> Station, Sola Air Station and Station Group Banak. In 1997, the squadron conducted 237 SAR and 747 air ambulance missions. From 1995 to 1998, one helicopter was stationed at Ålesund Airport, Vigra, and since 1999, one has been stationed at Rygge Air Station. Florø Airport became a station for one helicopter from 2009.|$|E

In May 2014, it became the eighth busiest airport in the world with 62.1 million passengers. It is also the busiest airport in the Southern Hemisphere. In October 2015, the airport is named as Asia's largest megahub, and ranked the 17th most-connected airport in the world.|$|E

The {{aircraft}} {{are part of the}} 335 Squadron, based at Gardermoen Air Station, although the flights from Jan Mayen operate from Bodø <b>Main</b> <b>Air</b> Station. The runway is not open for commercial traffic, although it can be used for research and search and rescue operations.|$|E
5|$|Station Group Banak, {{formerly}} Banak Air Station, {{comprises the}} airfield's military activity. It is organizationally part of Bodø <b>Main</b> <b>Air</b> Station.

The air station is regularly visited by the General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon for use in the shooting range at Halkavarre. The Garrison of Porsanger is located close to Lakselv.|$|E

5|$|The {{airfield}} {{was built}} {{in connection with the}} LORAN-C transmitter at Olonkinbyen and was completed in 1960. Jan Mayensfield is served eight times per year by Lockheed C-130 Hercules aircraft of the 335 Squadron from Bodø <b>Main</b> <b>Air</b> Station, which provide supplies and change crew at the outpost. The nearby Beerenberg volcano can cause a Kármán wind, which creates difficult landing conditions.|$|E
5|$|Air Norway {{was founded}} in 2003 by Gunnar Hagsveen. Scheduled {{services}} from Ørland to Oslo commenced on 23 May 2003. The company had originally planned to also operate aircraft between Ørland and Bodø Airport, to two <b>main</b> <b>air</b> stations of the Norwegian Air Force, but these plans were abandoned. Just after the route commenced, the owner became seriously ill, and marketing and sales efforts were neglected, causing a less-than-predicted cabin load. Hagsveen died on 26 December, and his heirs encouraged local businesses to purchase shares in the company. Air Norway commenced weekly flights from Oslo to Aalborg Airport in Denmark from 31 January 2004. In February 2004, the company received a loan for NOK650,000 from the municipality to operate pay off other debt. At the same time, the airline was sold to Sven Rosenvinge.|$|E

5|$|During {{the first}} leg of the flight, at about 15:00, Keč, wearing a winter coat, got up from his seat and walked {{to the front of the}} aircraft. A flight {{attendant}} stopped him. After talking for a short while, and another flight attendant came by, he was let into the cockpit. No information about the hijacking was given to the passengers until arrival at Bodø. Bodø Airport was evacuated and the aircraft parked at Bodø <b>Main</b> <b>Air</b> Station, the military section. After landing, by order of the hijacker, the passengers were informed that all women, children under 18 and people over 60 were to leave the aircraft. After this had happened, there were 77 passengers and four crew members left. The aircraft departed Bodø at about 16:00 and headed for Oslo Airport, Gardermoen, which was closed for all other traffic.|$|E
5|$|The airline {{was owned}} 40% by Nordic Air, 40% by the Municipality of Ørland and 20% by North Flying. All {{operations}} were flown by North Flying, who operate a 19-seat Fairchild Metro 23 in Air Norway livery. The municipality subsidised the route with NOK1 million per year. The company had {{a managing director}} in a 20% position, plus one person who coordinated booking on an hourly basis. In 2008, the airline had a revenue of NOK16 million and made NOK800,000 in profit. Ørland Airport is the civilian section of the military Ørland <b>Main</b> <b>Air</b> Station. Traditionally, the main customer group for Air Norway was military personnel.|$|E
5|$|Interest from {{military}} leaders for an airport at Banak returned in 1955. For {{the air force}} the main concern was {{that they could not}} reach the eastern-most parts of Norway from Bodø <b>Main</b> <b>Air</b> Station. This resulted in several Soviet infringements of Norwegian air space. Alternative locations were considered, such as Kautokeino, were there had been built a radar. NATO supported a reconstruction of Banak, partially raised by increased focus on flanking maneuver strategies, and also to serve {{as a part of the}} nuclear program. NATO was ready to provide funding in 1957, but by the Norwegian authorities wanted to delay its construction, citing lack of personnel to man the station and that it would not be usable in times of war. The government decided in 1957 to not allow nuclear warheads to be stored in Norway during peacetime, thus eliminating NATO's strategic need for Banak. The airport was therefore removed from the investment program.|$|E

5|$|The bay {{has been}} {{strategically}} {{important for the}} military. General Zachary Taylor stationed his men on Rincon Point during the Mexican-American War, and a Union invasion was halted by Confederates on the same point in 1862, during the American Civil War. The Port of Corpus Christi {{was used by the}} Confederates to bring in supplies during the war effort until the Union bombarded Corpus Christi and occupied the bay and port from 1863 to 1870. In 1940, the Naval Air Station Corpus Christi was established on the bay, and by 1944 had transformed into a major base with one <b>main</b> <b>air</b> station and six additional stations. Notably, during a March 1960 practice run from the base, future Senator John McCain lost track of his altitude and speed, and his single-seat, single-pistoned-engine AD-6 Skyraider crashed into Corpus Christi Bay and sank to the bottom. He squeezed out of the cockpit, swam ten feet to the surface, and was carried to safety by a rescue helicopter, therefore escaping without major injuries.|$|E
5|$|Værnes Air Station {{is one of}} two air {{stations}} in Central Norway, the other being Ørland <b>Main</b> <b>Air</b> Station. There are no aircraft permanently stationed at Værnes, but the station serves the Home Guard, including its training center and the headquarters of the Trøndelag District (HV-12). Most of the military installations are located {{on the north side of}} the runway, although some are also located on the south side, to the east of the civilian terminal. Værnes also serves as a storage base for the United States Armed Forces as part of the Marine Corps Prepositioning Program-Norway. The military owns the runways and taxiways, but these are operated by Avinor. Three to four hundred military aircraft are handled at the air station each year. The military installations contain places for up to six aircraft of the size of a C-5 Galaxy and barracks to house 1,200 soldiers. The Ring Road connects the northern to the southern installations and passes the main runway on the east side.|$|E
5|$|Værnes {{was taken}} into use by the Royal Norwegian Army in 1887. The first flight was made in 1914, and aerodrome {{facilities}} were gradually installed. The first main installations, including three concrete runways, were built during World War II by Luftwaffe. After the war, the Air Force Pilot School moved to Værnes, although in 1954 {{most of the other}} air force activities for Central Norway were moved to Ørland <b>Main</b> <b>Air</b> Station. Civilian aviation started in 1951, when half a barracks {{was taken into}} use as a terminal, with the whole building being utilized from 1958. Jet aircraft started serving Værnes from 1963, and the second terminal opened in 1965. The third (the current international Terminal B) was opened in 1982, and the fourth, Terminal A, was opened in 1994, along with the train station. From 1956 to 2004, Braathens was one of the largest airlines at the airport.|$|E
