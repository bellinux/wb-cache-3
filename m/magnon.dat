In November 2011 tests conducted at the Oxford Radiocarbon Accelerator Unit in England on what were previously thought to be Neanderthal baby teeth, which had been unearthed in 1964 from the Grotta del Cavallo, dated teeth from between 43,000 and 45,000 years ago.|$|E
40|$|To {{describe}} anomalous zone-boundary softening and damping of <b>magnons</b> in manganites {{we present}} a phenomenological two-fluid model containing ferromagnetic Fermi-liquid and non-Fermi-liquid components. The Fermi-liquid component accounts for softening of zone-boundary <b>magnons</b> and for the Landau damping of <b>magnons</b> in the Stoner continuum arising at low frequencies due to zero-point effects. Coupling of the Fermi-liquid and non-Fermi-liquid fluids yields conventional long wavelength <b>magnons</b> damped due to their coupling with longitudinal spin fluctuations.

25|$|From the {{perspective}} of solid state physics, Brillouin scattering is an interaction between an electromagnetic wave {{and one of the}} three above-mentioned crystalline lattice waves. The scattering is inelastic i.e. the photon may lose energy (Stokes process) and in the process create one of the three quasiparticle types (phonon, polaron, <b>magnon)</b> or it may gain energy (anti-Stokes process) by absorbing one of those quasiparticle types. Such a shift in photon energy, corresponding to a Brillouin shift in frequency, is equal to the energy of the released or absorbed quasiparticle. Thus, Brillouin scattering can be used to measure the energies, wavelengths and frequencies of various atomic chain oscillation types ('quasiparticles'). To measure a Brillouin shift a commonly employed device called the Brillouin spectrometer is used, the design of which is derived from a Fabry–Pérot interferometer.|$|E
2500|$|A later brigade {{was founded}} by Leonor Villegas de <b>Magnón</b> in 1913 that aided {{soldiers}} along {{both sides of the}} Texas-Mexican border near Laredo, Texas. A close-knit group of women and American doctors who helped the wounded during fighting, treated the wounded in Magnón's home, which had already been a makeshift kindergarten classroom. <b>Magnón</b> considered the preservation of Latino history important, and therefore had a [...] "semi-official" [...] photographer for Cruz Blanca, Esuebio Montoya. She made it understood that selling negatives or pictures was out of the question. In further strides to preserve the history of Cruz Blanca, <b>Magnón</b> wrote The Rebel, a third-person memoir and account of the activities of Cruz Blanca. Unfortunately her manuscript was not published in her lifetime due to many reasons, one of them including unconventional gender roles. It was not until 1994 when Arte Publico Press would pick up the manuscript from her granddaughter.|$|E
2500|$|Contre-Amiral <b>Magnon</b> {{had been}} out from Dunkirk 18 days and had {{captured}} the ship Belisarius, of Newcastle, the brig Scipio, and Content's Increase. The last two had cargoes of coal and the privateer had sent them straight into Dunkirk. A British naval brig had recaptured Belisarius within two hours of her capture. The masters of all three British vessels, together with their crews, some 20 men in all, were on Contre Amiral Magon {{at the time of}} her capture and Cruizer took them on board. Cruizer sent Contre-Amiral Magon into Yarmouth where soon afterwards she was wrecked by being driven on shore. Her crew were sent to prison, but Captain Blauckman remained aboard [...] He managed to escape and shortly thereafter returned to Dunkirk.|$|E
40|$|We {{experimentally}} {{show that}} exchange <b>magnons</b> {{can be detected}} {{using a combination of}} spin pumping and inverse spin-Hall effect (iSHE) proving its wavelength integrating capability down to the sub-micrometer scale. The <b>magnons</b> were injected in a ferrimagnetic yttrium iron garnet film by parametric pumping and the iSHE-induced voltage was detected in an attached Pt layer. The role of the density, wavelength, and spatial localization of the <b>magnons</b> for the spin pumping efficiency is revealed. This study opens the field of the magnon-based information processing to <b>magnons</b> with nano-scale wavelengths...|$|R
40|$|In this Thesis, spin-injection from a {{ferromagnetic}} to a non-ferromagnetic {{region is}} discussed using drift-diffusion theory. This {{is an important}} subject in spintronics nowadays where the spin of the electron is used instead of its charge. First, a simple system with a charge current density is presented. Then, spin-injection due to a constant temperature gradient is studied. <b>Magnons</b> are then brought into this system to see what effect they have. The contribution of the <b>magnons</b> {{is found to be}} substantial and results in injected spin accumulations that are around 10 ^ 2 higher than without <b>magnons.</b> We also study the temperature dependence to see in what temperature regimes <b>magnons</b> and electrons are important. At low temperatures, <b>magnons</b> seems to have the biggest contribution...|$|R

50|$|A <b>magnon</b> is a quasiparticle, a {{collective}} excitation of the electrons' spin structure in a crystal lattice. In the equivalent wave picture of quantum mechanics, a <b>magnon</b> {{can be viewed}} as a quantized spin wave. Magnons carry a fixed amount of energy and lattice momentum, and are spin-1, indicating they obey boson behavior.|$|E
40|$|The lifetimes of <b>magnons</b> {{propagating}} in the c-direction of Tb at 4. 2 K {{have been}} measured by inelastic neutron scattering. In {{contrast to the}} behaviour at higher temperatures, where magnon-magnon scattering predominates, the broadening of the <b>magnons</b> increases towards the boundary of the single Brillouin zone, both in the acoustic and optical branches. This suggests that the scattering of the <b>magnons</b> by conduction electrons is important, and the observed lifetimes are consistent with a recent estimate {{of the magnitude of}} this effect. The acoustic <b>magnons</b> of very long wavelength behave anomalously, presumably due to dipolar interactions...|$|R
40|$|It is {{well known}} that <b>magnons,</b> {{elementary}} excitations in a magnetic material, behave as bosons when their density is low. We study how the bosonic character of <b>magnons</b> is governed by the amount of a multipartite entanglement in the vacuum state on which <b>magnons</b> are excited. We show that if the multipartite entanglement is strong, <b>magnons</b> cease to be bosons. We also consider some examples, such as ground states of the Heisenberg ferromagnet and the transverse Ising model, the condensation of <b>magnons,</b> the one-way quantum computer, and Kitaev's toric code. Our result provides insights into the quantum statistics of elementary excitations in these models, and into the reason why a non-local transformation, such as the Jordan-Wigner transformation, is necessary for some many-body systems.

40|$|Last years several {{experiments}} were performed, which studied the Bose-Einstein condensation of quasi-particles, in particular, <b>magnons</b> in magnetically ordered systems. Recently the Bose-Einstein condensation of <b>magnons</b> {{was observed at}} room temperatures in a ferromagnetic film. The theory of the condensation (re-distribution) of <b>magnons</b> under the conditions of pumping, which explains many features of that experiment, is presented.

50|$|The {{better part}} of Magnón's life was {{dedicated}} to the Mexican revolution; she even began {{her life as a}} refugee—her father brought her family to the United States to escape the fighting in Mexico. By 1895, <b>Magnón</b> had received her bachelor's and teaching certificate at New York's Academy of Mount St. Ursula, and after school, married Aldopho <b>Magnón</b> and settled in Mexico City to teach kindergarten out of their home. <b>Magnón</b> also began to write articles criticizing then Mexican dictator Porfirio Díaz in La Crónica, a Spanish-language newspaper founded by the Idar family (of Jovita Idar) that exposed injustices against the community.|$|E
50|$|In {{the nine}} years {{following}} the inn's closing, the Thénardier family had assumed the name Jondrette. In addition, they had born two more sons, whom they essentially sold to <b>Magnon</b> {{so that she could}} pass them off as the children supported by Marius' grandfather M. Gillenormand for the sake of procuring child support. <b>Magnon</b> had accused M. Gillenormand of fathering the two children, which he denied, although he agreed to support them as long as <b>Magnon</b> did not bring him any more children to support. The Thénardiers' eldest son, Gavroche, was left to the streets, where he became a gamin.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Magnón</b> {{detailed}} {{her experiences}} as a volunteer in La Cruz Blanca in her autobiography, The Rebel, {{and this is where}} we get much of the information about Cruz Blanca's operation. <b>Magnón</b> was careful to leave two versions of her memoirs—one written in Spanish, and one translated into English, entitled The Lady was a Rebel. <b>Magnón</b> wrote these manuscripts (called [...] "novelized memoirs") in the third person, and wrote about important figures in the revolution, including women who helped carry out Cruz Blanca's operations. Unfortunately, her memoirs would not be seen by the public until 1994, when her granddaughter was able to publish it through Arte Publico Press.|$|E
40|$|We study giant <b>magnons</b> {{in the the}} D 1 -D 5 {{system from}} both the {{boundary}} CFT and as classical solutions of the string sigma model in AdS(3) x S- 3 x T- 4. Re-examining earlier studies of the symmetric product conformal field theory we argue that giant <b>magnons</b> in the symmetric product are BPS states in a centrally extended SU(1 vertical bar 1) x SU(1 vertical bar 1) superalgebra with two more additional central charges. The <b>magnons</b> carry these additional central charges locally but globally they vanish. Using a spin chain description of these <b>magnons</b> and the extended superalgebra we show that these <b>magnons</b> obey a dispersion relation which is periodic in momentum. We then identify these states on the string theory side and show that here too they are BPS in the same centrally extended algebra and obey the same dispersion relation which is periodic in momentum. This dispersion relation arises as the BPS condition for the extended algebra and {{is similar to that}} of <b>magnons</b> in N = 4 Yang-Mills Yang-Mills...|$|R

Scattering from the spin waves could be observed continuously from the thermal level through the nonlinear region of parametrically excited <b>magnons.</b> <b>Magnons</b> with small wave vectors propagating perpendicular to the static field are seen to have the lowest critical field as predicted theoretically. The spectra of these parametric excitations show a pronounced structure...|$|R
40|$|Momentum {{transfer}} from incoming <b>magnons</b> to a Bloch domain wall is calculated using one dimensional continuum micromagnetic analysis. Due to the confinement {{of the wall}} in space, the dispersion relation of <b>magnons</b> {{is different from that}} of a single domain. This mismatch of dispersion relations can result in reflection of <b>magnons</b> upon incidence on the domain wall, whose direct consequence is a transfer of momentum between <b>magnons</b> and the domain wall. The corresponding counteraction force exerted on the wall can be used for the control of domain wall motion through magnonic linear momentum transfer, in analogy with the spin transfer torque induced by magnonic angular momentum transfer.

40|$|We {{report the}} {{detection}} of electromagnetic waves radiated by current-driven <b>magnons</b> in a Co/Cu magnetic multilayer. The <b>magnons</b> were excited {{by means of a}} high current density approximate to 10 (8) A/cm(2) injected into the multilayer through a point contact. The point contact itself was used as a high frequency mixer to mix electromagnetic waves radiated by the current-driven <b>magnons</b> with externally generated microwave radiation. Here the external microwaves are used as a direct probe of the high-frequency behavior and partial phase coherence of the current-induced excitations. When the external frequency equaled the frequency of the <b>magnons</b> generated in the multilayer a DC voltage was found to develop across the contact. Investigation of how this voltage varies with exciting current, magnetic field, and microwave frequency provides detailed information on the spectrum of the current-driven <b>magnons.</b> Our observations support the feasibility of a spin- wave maser, or spin-wave amplification by stimulated emission of radiation.
