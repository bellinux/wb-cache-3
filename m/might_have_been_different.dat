5|$|Although the {{authorities}} {{had won a}} total military victory, they refrained from inflicting further draconian measures on the general population. The whole affair had clearly demonstrated that the cities depended on the support of their rural subjects. Putting down the insurrection had been achieved only with difficulties, and only {{with the help of}} troops from Zürich and Uri. Had the peasants succeeded to extend the Huttwil League to encompass the countryside of Zürich, the outcome of the conflict <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>different.</b> The city authorities were well aware of their essentially lucky escape, and their actions in the following years reflect it. While they took steps to disempower the rural population politically, they also fulfilled many of the peasants original fiscal demands, alleviating the economic pressure on them. Tax reforms were passed, to the point that for instance in the canton of Lucerne the overall taxation of the population decreased {{in the second half of}} the 17th century.|$|E
5|$|The Years of Rice and Salt is an {{alternate}} history novel written by science fiction author Kim Stanley Robinson {{and published in}} 2002. The novel explores how world history <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>different</b> if the Black Death plague had killed 99% of Europe's population, instead of a third. Divided into ten parts, the story spans hundreds of years, from {{the army of the}} Muslim conqueror Timur to the 21st century, with Europe being re-populated by Muslim pioneers, the indigenous peoples of the Americas forming a league to resist Chinese and Muslim invaders, and a 67-year-long world war being fought primarily between Muslim states and the Chinese and their allies. While the ten parts take place in different times and places, they are connected by a group of characters that are reincarnated into each time but are identified to the reader by the first letter of their name being consistent in each life.|$|E

25|$|Experimental and {{statistical}} criticisms followed. Until approximately a decade ago, critics of Bateman’s model {{focused on his}} experimental design. In recent years, they have shifted attention to the actual experimental {{and statistical}} calculations Bateman published throughout his trials. Birkhead wrote a 2000 review arguing that the since Bateman’s experiments lasted only three to four days, the female fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, may not have needed to mate repeatedly, as it can store sperm for up to four days; if Bateman had used a species in which females had to copulate more often to fertilize their eggs, the results <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>different.</b> Snyder and Gowaty (2007) conducted the first in-depth {{analysis of the data}} in Bateman’s 1948 paper. They found many sampling biases, mathematical errors, and even statistical misinterpretations.|$|E
500|$|Hunter Davies {{recalled}} that while {{working with the}} Beatles on their authorised biography in 1968, [...] "when the subject of Pete Best came up they seemed to cut off, {{as if he had}} never touched their lives. They showed little reaction … I suppose it reminded them not just that they had been rather sneaky in the handling of Pete Best's sacking, never telling him to his face, but that for the grace of God, or Brian Epstein, circumstances <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>different</b> and they could have ended up [...]" [...] During the height of Beatlemania Best attempted to commit suicide, but his mother, Mona, and his brother, Rory, talked him out of it.|$|E
500|$|Because of {{her closer}} {{proximity}} to Wright's column, Takanami {{was the target}} of most of the Americans' initial gunfire. [...] Takanami returned fire and launched her full load of eight torpedoes, but was quickly hit by American gunfire and, within four minutes, was set afire and incapacitated. [...] As Takanami was destroyed, the rest of Tanaka's ships, almost unnoticed by the Americans, were increasing speed, maneuvering, and preparing to respond to the American attack. [...] All of the American torpedoes missed. Historian Russell S. Crenshaw, Jr. postulates that had the twenty-four Mark 15 torpedoes fired by U.S. Navy destroyers during the battle not been fatally flawed, the outcome of the battle <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>different.</b>|$|E

500|$|Over the two bridges, Harrison {{presents}} a more engaged perspective. He states that he's [...] "too much in love", but had {{he and his}} lover met [...] "some other day", the outcome <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>different.</b> Fontenot cites these lyrics as the reason why some commentators attach an alternative meaning to the song, whereby the singer is already in a committed relationship and is addressing another woman, {{with the prospect of}} continuing a casual encounter. While considering that Harrison appears to be [...] "playing his options, albeit gently", author John Kruth deems the line [...] "Carve your number on my wall" [...] to be [...] "one of Rubber Souls most enigmatic lyrics" [...] and an evocation of the imagery in [...] "Norwegian Wood".|$|E
500|$|Operationally, {{the battle}} proved to the Australian high command how {{effective}} armour could be {{when used in}} close co-operation with infantry and in protecting the lines of communication. The use of machine gun carriers {{to carry out the}} wounded had also been quite effective. While the Japanese soldiers and officers on the ground fought bravely, continuing the assault even when it was clear it had failed, ultimately the battle proved to be a decisive Australian victory; however, James notes that poor planning and unreliable communications had also contributed to the result. Long goes on to argue that if the Japanese commander had been more flexible in his tactics, the result <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>different.</b> The Australian right flank had been vulnerable, but Akinaga did not exploit this opportunity.|$|E
2500|$|I am {{not sure}} we handled it all correctly. [...] The mass {{intrusion}} of pickets into Notts, not just Yorkshiremen; I accept some responsibility for that, and so will the left have to. [...] I think if as an executive we had approached Notts without pickets, it <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>different.</b> [...] Because I reject, I have made this clear since the strike, that 25 or 30,000 Notts miners, their wives and families and communities are scabs and blacklegs. [...] I refuse to accept this. [...] We did alienate them during the strike.|$|E

2500|$|Before {{granting}} a writ of coram nobis, {{the trial}} court must {{be satisfied with the}} reliability of the newly discovered evidence and determine that the defendant is without fault in timely discovering such evidence. The trial court must then review the evidence presented at trial and at the coram nobis proceeding and determine whether a reasonable basis exists for concluding that had the new evidence been presented at trial, the result of the proceedings <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>different.</b> [...] Coram nobis claims are not easily resolved {{on the face of the}} petition and often require a hearing; however, an evidentiary hearing is not statutorily required in every case.|$|E
2500|$|On August 3, 1984 the {{district}} decision was overturned by the appellate court. The appellate court ruled that, despite the mission listed in their application, the Gay Student Services group {{was primarily a}} social organization. The appellate court found that Texas A [...] "did not and has not {{to the time of}} trial in this case, recognized fraternal organizations, i.e. student groups whose principal if not sole purpose is to hold social gatherings to encourage friendships and personal affinity", and that this was the primary reason for the refusal to grant official status. [...] Although trial testimony had centered on other issues, the appellate court ruling hinted that the outcome <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>different</b> if Texas A had argued that the denial was a result of public health concerns. This decision was rendered before there was much public awareness of AIDS.|$|E
2500|$|A few {{critics were}} less than {{impressed}} by King's victory; she was 26 years younger, and some experts claimed {{that it was more}} an age versus youth game. According to Jack Kramer, [...] "I don't think Billie Jean played all that well. She hit a lot of short balls which Bobby could have taken advantage of had he been in shape. I would never take anything away from Billie Jean—because she was smart enough to prepare herself properly—but it <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>different</b> if Riggs hadn't kept running around. It was more than one woman who took care of Bobby Riggs in Houston." [...] Before the match, however, King had forced the American television network ABC to drop Kramer as a commentator. King said, [...] "He doesn't believe in women's tennis. Why should he be part of this match? He doesn't believe in half of the match. I'm not playing. Either he goes—or I go." ...|$|E
