25|$|Dextran is a {{polysaccharide}} {{derived from}} bacteria; {{it is usually}} produced by enzymes from certain strains of leuconostoc or Streptococcus. It consists of α-1,6-linked D-glucopyranose residues. Cross-linked dextran hydrogel beads {{have been widely used}} as low protein-binding matrices for column chromatography applications and for microcarrier cell culture technology. However, it has not been until recently that dextran hydrogels have been investigated in biomaterials applications and specifically as drug delivery vehicles. An advantage of using dextran in biomaterials applications include its resistance to protein adsorption and cell-adhesion, which allows specific cell adhesion to be determined by deliberately attached peptides from ECM components. AEMA was copolymerized with Dex-MA in order to introduce primary amine groups to provide a site for attachment of ECM-derived peptides to promote cell adhesion. The peptides can be immobilized using sulfo-SMMC coupling chemistry and cysteine-terminated peptides. Copolymerization of Dex-MA with AEMA allowed the <b>macroporous</b> geometry of the scaffolds to be preserved in addition to promoting cellular interactions.|$|E

5000|$|The {{addition}} of polyethylene glycol (PEG) {{to the process}} causes silica particles to aggregate into a <b>macroporous</b> continuous block, allowing access to a monolithic morphology. PEG polymers with allyl or silyl end groups with a molecular weight of greater than 2000 g mol−1 are required. The Stöber process is initiated under neutral pH conditions, so that the PEG polymers will congregate around {{the outside of the}} growing particles, providing stabilization. Once the aggregates are sufficiently large, the PEG-stabilized particles will contact and irreversibly fuse together by [...] "sticky aggregation" [...] between the PEG chains. This continues until complete flocculation of all the particles has occurred and the monolith has been formed, at which point the monolith may be calcined and the PEG removed, resulting in a <b>macroporous</b> silica monolith. Both particle size and sticky aggregation can be controlled by varying the molecular weight and concentration of PEG.|$|E
50|$|The {{diameter}} of a molecular sieve {{is measured in}} ångströms (Å) or nanometres (nm).

50|$|Prior {{to these}} studies, HPLC {{analyses}} were tuned by modifying the mobile and stationary phases only. Gradient elution for HPLC merely meant changing {{the ratio of}} solvents to improve column efficiency, and this {{requires the use of}} sophisticated solvent pumping mechanisms along with extra steps and precautions in the chromatographic analysis. Enlightened by the prospect of using temperature gradient elutions for HPLC analyses, Hosoya et al. sought to make surface modification of HPLC stationary phases more accessible. Their study utilizes graft-type copolymerization of PNIPAAm onto <b>macroporous</b> polymeric materials. The in-situ preparation compared the use of cyclohexanol and toluene as porogens in the preparation of the modified polystyrene seeds. Reverse-phased size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) revealed pore size and pore size distribution of the particles and its dependence on temperature. Cyclohexanol acted as a successful porogen showing a dependent relationship of pore size to temperature. The use of toluene as a porogen gave results that were similar to unmodified <b>macroporous</b> particles. This indicates that PNIPAAm can be successfully grafted onto the surface and within the pores of <b>macroporous</b> materials. The application of this preparatory technique gives rise to tunable pore sizes. Temperature gradient elutions can be used to improve column efficiency through the changing of pore size in SEC. The mechanism of the change in pore size is simple, the pores are smaller under LCST due to the elongated chains of PNIPAAm within the pores, as temperature increases to and above LCST, the chains retract into a globular formation increasing the pore size.|$|E
50|$|The {{porosity}} {{value of}} silicon is a macroscopic parameter and doesn’t yield any {{information regarding the}} microstructure of the layer. It is proposed that the properties of a sample are more accurately predicted if the pore size and its distribution within the sample can be obtained. Therefore, porous silicon has been divided into three categories based {{on the size of}} its pores; <b>macroporous,</b> mesoporous, and microporous.|$|E
50|$|Currently, {{there exists}} a {{hydrogel}} based scaffold which acts as a channel to deliver nerve growth-enhancing substrates while providing structural support. These factors would promote nerve repairs to the target area. Hydrogels' <b>macroporous</b> properties would enable attachment of cells and enhance ion and nutrient exchange. In addition, hydrogels' biodegradability or bioresolvability would prevent the need for surgical removal of the hydrogel after drug delivery.

50|$|High speed {{photography}} of the reactive Leidenfrost {{effect of}} cellulose on porous surfaces (<b>macroporous</b> alumina) was also shown {{to suppress the}} reactive Leidenfrost effect and enhance overall heat transfer rates to the particle from the surface. The new phenomenon of a 'reactive Leidenfrost (RL) effect' was characterized by a dimensionless quantity (φRL= τconv/τrxn), which relates the time constant of solid particle heat transfer to the time constant of particle reaction, with the reactive Leidenfrost effect occurring for 10−1< φRL< 10+1. The reactive Leidenfrost effect with cellulose will occur in numerous high temperature applications with carbohydrate polymers including biomass conversion to biofuels, preparation and cooking of food, and tobacco use.|$|E
5000|$|Nanoelectronics {{and brain}} science. The {{development}} of nanoelectronics-enabled cellular tools underpins Lieber’s views on transforming electrical recording and modulation of neuronal activity in brain science. Examples {{of this work}} include the integration of arrays of nanowire transistors with neurons at the scale that the brain is wired biologically, mapping functional activity in acute brain slices with high spatiotemporal resolution and a 3D structure capable of interfacing with complex neural networks. He developed <b>macroporous</b> 3D sensor arrays and synthetic tissue scaffold to mimic the structure of natural tissue, {{and for the first}} time generated synthetic tissues that can be innervated in 3D, showing that it is possible to produce interpenetrating 3D electronic-neural networks following cell culture. Lieber’s current work focuses on integrating electronics in a minimally/non-invasive manner within the central nervous system. Most recently, he has demonstrated that this <b>macroporous</b> electronics can be injected by syringe to position devices in a chosen region of the brain. Chronic histology and multiplexed recording studies demonstrate minimal immune response and noninvasive integration of the injectable electronics with neuronal circuitry. Reduced scarring may explain the mesh electronics’ demonstrated recording stability on time scales of up to a year. This concept of electronics integration with the brain as a nanotechnological tool potentially capable of treating neurological and neurodegenerative diseases, stroke and traumatic injury has drawn attention from a number of media sources. Scientific American named injectable electronics one of 2015’s top ten world changing ideas. Chemical & Engineering News called it “the most notable chemistry research advance of 2015.” ...|$|E
50|$|Hydrophilic {{membranes}} {{are more}} widely available. The commercially most successful pervaporation membrane system {{to date is}} based on polyvinyl alcohol. More recently also membranes based on polyimide have become available. To overcome the intrinsic disadvantages of polymeric membrane systems ceramic membranes have been developed over the last decade. These ceramic membranes consist of nanoporous layers {{on top of a}} <b>macroporous</b> support. The pores must be large enough to let water molecules pass through and retain any other solvents that have a larger molecular size such as ethanol. As a result, a molecular sieve with a pore size of about 4 Å is obtained. The most widely available member of this class of membranes is that based on zeolite A.|$|E
50|$|In 1999 a {{two-stage}} modification {{was reported}} that allowed the controlled formation of silica particles with small holes. The process is undertaken at low pH {{in the presence of}} a surface-active molecule. The hydrolysis step is completed with the formation of a microemulsion before adding sodium fluoride to start the condensation process. The non-ionic surfactant is burned away to produce empty pores, increasing the surface area and altering the surface characteristics of the resulting particles, allowing for much greater control over the physical properties of the material. Development work has also been undertaken for larger pore structures such as <b>macroporous</b> monoliths, shell-core particles based on polystyrene, cyclen, or polyamines, and carbon spheres.|$|E
50|$|Important {{examples}} of SA in materials science include {{the formation of}} molecular crystals, colloids, lipid bilayers, phase-separated polymers, and self-assembled monolayers. The folding of polypeptide chains into proteins and the folding of nucleic acids into their functional forms are {{examples of}} self-assembled biological structures. Recently, the three-dimensional <b>macroporous</b> structure was prepared via self-assembly of diphenylalanine derivative under cryoconditions, the obtained material can find the application {{in the field of}} regenerative medicine or drug delivery system. P. Chen et al. demonstrated a microscale self-assembly method using the air-liquid interface established by Faraday wave as a template. This self-assembly method can be used for generation of diverse sets of symmetrical and periodic patterns from microscale materials such as hydrogels, cells, and cell spheroids.|$|E
5000|$|Porosity {{is defined}} as the {{fraction}} of void within the pSi layer and can be determined easily by weight measurement. During formation of porous silicon layer through anodization, the porosity of a wafer can be increased through increasing current density, decreasing HF concentration and thicker silicon layer. The porosity of porous silicon may range from 4% for <b>macroporous</b> layers to 95% for mesoporous layers. A study by Canham in 1995 found that [...] "a 1 µm thick layer of high porosity silicon completely dissolved within a day of in-vitro exposure to a simulated body fluid". It was also found that a silicon wafer with medium to low porosity displayed more stability. Hence, the porosity of porous silicon is varied depending on its potential application areas.|$|E
