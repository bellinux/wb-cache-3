However, in Dano v Jobcenter Leipzig, the Court of Justice held that the German government was entitled to deny child support to a Romanian mother who had lived in Germany for 3 years, but had never worked. Because she lived in Germany for over 3 months, but under 5 years, she had to show evidence of [...] "sufficient resources", since the Court reasoned the right to equal treatment in article 24 within that time depended on lawful residence under article 7.|$|E

This paper discusses some key policies that are used or can be used to increase economic self-sufficiency by increasing earnings, including mandating higher wages, subsidizing work, and increasing skill formation.

In order to lower the rate of working poverty, conservatives advocate reducing welfare benefits and enacting less stringent labor laws. On the other hand, many liberals argue that working poverty can only be solved through increased, not decreased, government intervention.

40|$|This {{introductory}} essay questions putting {{nearly all}} effort into social policywhich {{has failed to}} reduce povertyand calls instead for reinvigorating other tactics and re-imagining the unfinished dream of economic justice. Indeed, what Martin Luther King, Jr. envisioned was an actual war on poverty, not merely the abbreviated, under-funded, and ultimately unsuccessful effort of the 1960 s, nor the imposter war on welfare that has dominated our social policy effort since. But our social policy has not only failed to reduce poverty, it failed to focus long-needed attention on poverty and inequality. Nor has social policy facilitated the political mobilization of poor people or secured their legal rightstwo other means for seeking economic justice. Thus, this essay reviews {{the problems associated with}} working for less than a <b>minimum</b> <b>living</b> <b>wage</b> (No Acres and No Mule), including the lack of political power (No Politics), and constitutional rights (No Rights).

40|$|Attention to the {{implicit}} and explicit wage theories articulated by economic actors and embedded {{in public policy}} reveals the underlying social norms and values in specific historical and industrial contexts. The Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (FLSA), the first federal minimum wage legislation in the United States, legitimated and institutionalized the idea that living standards and workers' needs matter in setting wages. They matter not simply in generating labor supply, but {{as the basis for}} government intervention in market mechanisms. Rather than viewing market mechanisms and government regulations dichotomously, economic actors debating the FLSA treated both market mechanisms and socially defined living standards as legitimate elements of wage-setting. Wage regulations also, by necessity, must grapple with issues of identity, that is, which workers (especially as defined by class, gender, and race - ethnicity) are deserving of particular living standards. Debates over the language in the FLSA reveal the contested nature of masculinity during the period of economic crisis in the 1930 s. Advocates responded by defining a multiplicity of <b>living</b> <b>wages</b> corresponding with different living standards, as well as a multiplicity of strategies for achieving them. <b>minimum</b> <b>wage,</b> <b>living</b> <b>wage,</b> New Deal, gender, masculinity, economic policy,...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Living wage {{campaigns have}} succeeded in about 100 jurisdictions in the United States. But <b>living</b> <b>wage</b> campaigns have also been {{unsuccessful}} in numerous cities. Some campaigns were derailed due to a state legislative or judicial decision preventing <b>living</b> <b>wages.</b> Other campaigns failed to get legislation passed at the city level due to a negative city council vote or a mayoral veto. The analysis in this paper exploits the information provided by failed and derailed <b>living</b> <b>wage</b> campaigns in estimating effects of <b>living</b> <b>wage</b> laws. These unsuccessful <b>living</b> <b>wage</b> campaigns provide a better control group or counterfactual for estimating the effects of <b>living</b> <b>wage</b> laws than the broader set of all cities without a <b>living</b> <b>wage</b> law, and also permit the separate estimation {{of the effects of}} <b>living</b> <b>wage</b> laws and <b>living</b> <b>wage</b> campaigns. The findings indicate that <b>living</b> <b>wage</b> laws raise wages of low-wage workers but also reduce employment among the least-skilled, especially broader <b>living</b> <b>wage</b> laws that cover business assistance recipients, and <b>living</b> <b>wage</b> laws accompanied by similar laws in nearby cities...|$|R

It is estimated that workers who qualify for the <b>living</b> <b>wage</b> legislation are currently between 1-2% of the bottom quartile of wage distribution.

Approach – The article examines how compulsory and voluntary wage floors are being determined, in the UK and in particular the role of public consensus in contributing to the calculation and adoption of a <b>living</b> <b>wage.</b> It then reflects on the future sustainability of a system of wage floors in which the concept of the <b>living</b> <b>wage</b> plays a significant role.

The <b>living</b> <b>wage</b> idea has stimulated more decisive efforts to do so; however, if a compulsory version of a <b>living</b> <b>wage</b> were to reach a level shown to be harming jobs, this could seriously undermine such efforts. Moreover, the extent to which adequate wages are compatible with high employment levels can also be influenced by state support for households, especially tax credits and Universal Credit.
