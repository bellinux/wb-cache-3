5|$|As {{part of the}} Mukilteo <b>Multimodal</b> Project, Sound Transit and the Washington State Department of Transportation are partnering {{to build}} a new ferry {{terminal}} on State Route 525 in Mukilteo. The preferred alternative, selected in 2013, will move the terminal closer to the existing station and include a new transit center for buses.|$|E
5|$|When {{the lesion}} is localized, it is {{generally}} curable. However, long-term survival for children with advanced disease older than 18 months of age is poor despite aggressive <b>multimodal</b> therapy (intensive chemotherapy, surgery, radiation therapy, stem cell transplant, differentiation agent isotretinoin also called 13-cis-retinoic acid, and frequently immunotherapy with anti-GD2 monoclonal antibody therapy).|$|E
5|$|A {{wide variety}} of AAC systems have been used with {{children}} with developmental verbal dyspraxia. Manual signs or gestures are frequent introduced to these children, and can {{include the use of}} fingerspelling alongside speech. Manual signs have been shown to decrease errors in articulation. Aided AAC systems typically include communication boards and speech generating devices. A <b>multimodal</b> approach is often used, with several AAC approaches introduced so that the child {{can take advantage of the}} most effective method for a particular situation.|$|E
5|$|The City of Everett {{selected}} a straightaway track segment east of downtown as the preferred {{location of a}} <b>multimodal</b> train/bus station, to replace the existing Amtrak station at Bond Street, in 1993. The Everett City Council chose a two-block industrial site bordered by Pacific Avenue to the north in 1995, estimating a cost of $30 million and an opening in 1998. Everett Mayor Ed Hansen proposed adding two additional stories to the station building to house classrooms and space for career counseling services, inspired by a similar project in Oakland, California. The Sound Transit Board passed a resolution in February 1999 allowing the use of $14 million to begin work on the Everett <b>Multimodal</b> Facility, {{which was to be}} the terminus for Sounder commuter rail and Sound Transit Express bus service. A groundbreaking ceremony was held on July 13, 2000, allowing for construction on Everett Station to begin. Sound Transit began with the construction of the Pacific Avenue overpass, replacing an earlier at-grade crossing, that opened on November 14, 2001 at a cost of $20 million. The station building was designed by the Zimmer Gunsul Frasca Partnership and built by Wilder Construction Company in 2000 and 2001.|$|E
5|$|Widnes {{continues}} to be an industrial town and its major industry is still the manufacture of chemicals although there has been some diversification in recent years. In 2006 a new freight park, known as the 3MG Mersey <b>Multimodal</b> Gateway, was opened in the West Bank area of the town. This provides a link for freight arriving by road, air or sea to be transferred to the rail network. It is expected to create up to 5,000 new jobs.|$|E
5|$|Home to {{approximately}} 7.68 million people, the nine-county Bay Area contains many cities, towns, airports, and associated regional, state, and national parks, {{connected by a}} complex <b>multimodal</b> transportation network. The larger combined statistical area of the region, which includes twelve counties, is the second-largest in California (after the Greater Los Angeles area), the fifth-largest in the United States, and the 41st-largest urban area {{in the world with}} 8.75 million people. The Bay Area's population is ethnically diverse: for example, roughly half of the region's residents are Hispanic, Asian, African American, or Pacific Islander, all of whom have a significant presence throughout the region.|$|E
5|$|Transportation in the San Francisco Bay Area is {{reliant on}} a complex <b>multimodal</b> {{infrastructure}} consisting of roads, bridges, highways, rail, tunnels, airports, and bike and pedestrian paths. The development, maintenance, {{and operation of}} these different modes of transportation are overseen by various agencies, including the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans), San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency, and the Metropolitan Transportation Commission. These and other organizations collectively manage several interstate highways and state routes, two subway networks, two commuter rail agencies, eight trans-bay bridges, transbay ferry service, local bus service, three international airports (San Francisco, San Jose, and Oakland), and an extensive network of roads, tunnels, and paths such as the San Francisco Bay Trail.|$|E
25|$|Other types include reality therapy/choice theory, {{cognitive}} processing therapy, EMDR, and <b>multimodal</b> therapy.|$|E
25|$|<b>Multimodal</b> {{stimulation}} and music: By combining music, such as lullabies, and <b>multimodal</b> stimulation, premature infants were {{discharged from}} the NICU sooner, than those infants who did not receive therapy. <b>Multimodal</b> stimulation (MMS) includes the applications of auditory, tactile, vestibular, and visual stimulation that helps aid in premature infant development. The combination of music and MMS helps premature infants sleep and conserve vital energy required to gain weight more rapidly. Studies have shown that girls respond more positively than boys during <b>multimodal</b> stimulation. While the voice is a popular choice for parents looking to bond with their premature infants, other effective instruments include the Remo Ocean Disk and the Gato Box. Both are used to stimulate {{the sounds of the}} womb. The Remo Ocean Disk, a round musical instrument that mimics the fluid sounds of the womb, has been shown to benefit decreased heart rate after therapeutic uses, as well as promoting healthy sleep patterns, lower respiratory rates and improve sucking behavior.|$|E
25|$|<b>Multimodal</b> Freight Sdn. Bhd., {{incorporated}} in 1988, was licensed as a Government approved Container Haulier in 1991, {{and went on}} to obtain the Government approved <b>Multimodal</b> Transport Operator (MTO) status in 1999. The company operates a fleet of 225 Prime Movers and 1,300 trailer of both 20-feet and 40-feet configurations. The fleet is deployed at all major seaports and the inland ports of Ipoh and Nilai.|$|E

25|$|In the {{developing}} world, {{the migration from}} rural to urbanized habitats has progressed differently. Many areas of {{the developing}} world have urbanised without significant motorisation and the formation of suburbs. A small portion of the population can afford automobiles, but the automobiles greatly increase congestion in these <b>multimodal</b> transportation systems. They also produce considerable air pollution, pose a significant safety risk, and exacerbate feelings of inequities in the society. High population density could be supported by a <b>multimodal</b> system of walking, bicycle transportation, motorcycles, buses, and trains.|$|E

25|$|Polyethylene with <b>multimodal</b> {{molecular}} weight distribution consists of several polymer fractions, which are homogeneously mixed. Such polyethylene types offer extremely high stiffness, toughness, strength, stress crack resistance and an increased crack propagation resistance. They consist of equal proportions higher and lower molekularerer polymer fractions. The lower {{molecular weight}} units crystallize easier and relax faster. The higher molecular weight fractions form linking molecules between crystallites, thereby increasing toughness and stress crack resistance. Polyethylene with <b>multimodal</b> {{molecular weight distribution}} can be prepared either in two-stage reactors, by catalysts with two different active centers on a carrier or by blending in extruders.|$|E
25|$|The {{first line}} {{approach}} {{as an alternative}} to hip replacement is conservative management which involves a <b>multimodal</b> approach of medication, activity modification and physical therapy. Conservative management can prevent or delay the need for hip replacement.|$|E

25|$|The city is {{planning}} a new centralized <b>multimodal</b> train station called the Gateway Station. It is expected to house the future LYNX Purple Line, the new Greyhound bus station, and the Crescent line that passes through Uptown Charlotte.|$|E
25|$|As, in {{the general}} case, the theory linking data with model {{parameters}} is nonlinear, the posterior probability in the model space may {{not be easy to}} describe (it may be <b>multimodal,</b> some moments may not be defined, etc.).|$|E
25|$|When the {{probability}} density {{function of a}} continuous distribution has multiple local maxima {{it is common to}} refer to all of the local maxima as modes of the distribution. Such a continuous distribution is called <b>multimodal</b> (as opposed to unimodal).|$|E
25|$|Internally, {{businesses}} use <b>multimodal</b> platforms for {{analytical and}} systemic purposes, among others. Through multimodality, a company enhances its productivity {{as well as}} creating transparency for management. Improved employee performance from these practices can correlate with ongoing interactive training and intuitive digital tools.|$|E
25|$|The Gateway <b>Multimodal</b> Transportation Center in St. Louis is {{the largest}} active multi-use {{transportation}} center in the state. It is in downtown St. Louis, next to the historic Union Station complex. It serves as a hub center/station for MetroLink, the MetroBus regional bus system, Greyhound, Amtrak, and taxi services.|$|E
25|$|REBT clearly {{acknowledges}} that people, {{in addition to}} disturbing themselves, also are innately constructivists. Because they largely upset themselves with their beliefs, emotions and behaviors, they can be helped to, in a <b>multimodal</b> manner, dispute and question these and develop a more workable, more self-helping set of constructs.|$|E
25|$|Multimodality also obscures an audience’s {{concept of}} genre by {{creating}} gray areas {{out of what}} was once black and white. Carolyn R. Miller, a distinguished professor of rhetoric and technical communication at North Carolina State University observed in her genre analysis of the Weblog how genre shifted with the invention of blogs, stating that “there is strong agreement on the central features that make a blog a blog. Miller defines blogs {{on the basis of their}} reverse chronology, frequent updating, and combination of links with personal commentary. However, the central features of blogs are obscured when considering <b>multimodal</b> texts. Some features are absent, such the ability for posts to be independent of each other, while others are present. This creates a situation where the genre of <b>multimodal</b> texts is impossible to define; rather, the genre is dynamic, evolutionary and ever-changing.|$|E
25|$|Levomepromazine is {{frequently}} prescribed and valued worldwide in palliative care medicine for its <b>multimodal</b> action, to treat intractable nausea or vomiting, and for severe delirium/agitation {{in the last}} days of life. Palliative care physicians will commonly prescribe it orally or via subcutaneous syringe drivers in combination with opioid analgesics such as hydromorphone.|$|E
25|$|From {{the formal}} marking {{line of the}} Atlantic Entrance, one enters Limón Bay (Bahía Limón), a large natural harbor. The {{entrance}} runs 5½ mi (8.4 km). It provides a deepwater port (Cristóbal), with facilities like <b>multimodal</b> cargo exchange (to and from train) and the Colón Free Trade Zone (a free port).|$|E
25|$|As {{classroom}} technologies {{become more}} prolific, so do <b>multimodal</b> assignments. Students {{in the 21st century}} have more options for communicating digitally, be it texting, blogging, or through social media. This rise in computer-controlled communication has required classes to become <b>multimodal</b> {{in order to}} teach students the skills required in the 21st-century work environment. However, in the classroom setting, multimodality is more than just combining multiple technologies, but rather creating meaning through the integration of multiple modes. Students are learning through a combination of these modes, including sound, gestures, speech, images and text. For example, in digital components of lessons, there are often pictures, videos, and sound bites as well as the text to help students grasp {{a better understanding of the}} subject. Multimodality also requires that teachers move beyond teaching with just text, as the printed word is only one of many modes students must learn and use.|$|E
