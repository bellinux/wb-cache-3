40|$|The {{objective}} of this work is to study the acoustic behavior of chimney organ pipes. The working hypothesis is that its role is to reinforce the fifth harmonic of the tone of a stopped pipe. According to Helmholtz, the chimney should have the length of an open pipe resonating at {{the frequency of the}} fifth harmonic. This design appears to be the least favorable one, except if the chimney is placed half inside and half outside the main pipe, and should therefore be avoided. The ratio <b>of</b> the <b>modulus</b> <b>of</b> the <b>admittance</b> <b>of</b> the different harmonics appears to describe, for the chimney pipe used in this study, the dependency of the ratio of the measured amplitude of the fifth, third, and first harmonic with the geometry of the chimney. The admittance curve can therefore be used {{to determine the effects of}} the geometry of the chimney on the timbre of the organ pipe. This result is used in order to determine the optimal diameter of the chimney as a function of its length...|$|R
40|$|International audienceLocal Electrochemical Impedance Mapping (LEIM) {{methodology}} {{was adopted}} {{to quantify the}} propagation of electrochemically active regions with a micrometric precision. The method consisted in the use <b>of</b> the gradient <b>modulus</b> <b>of</b> the <b>admittance</b> map as a parameter for the spatial quantifi-cation. Numerical simulations were used to optimize the experimental conditions, namely the AC frequency, {{the distance between the}} local bi-probe and the working electrode, and the distances between the probes for the local bi-probe used for the local current mapping. This analysis was reinforced by experimental verifications on coated electrodes. The quantitative LEIM methodology was successfully applied to follow the delamination kinetics on Zn coated with the polyvinyl butyral polymer in NaCl solutions. At 1 kHz, the LEIM response only reflected the position of the anodic front beneath the polymer because oxygen reduction reaction was diffusion limited and hence, independent of the applied potential. This novel LEIM methodology completes the set of usual tools used to investigate the delamination mechanisms on metal substrates...|$|R
