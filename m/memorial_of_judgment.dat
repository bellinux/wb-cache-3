40|$|The review essay {{discusses}} Wayne Martin’s Theories <b>of</b> <b>Judgment,</b> {{which claims}} that theories <b>of</b> <b>judgment</b> confront the difficulty that its object belongs to three distinct sciences: logic, psychology, and phenomenology. The essay denies {{that there is}} such a thing as a phenomenology <b>of</b> <b>judgment,</b> as judgment is not an object of experience, but an act of spontaneity. Moreover, it suggests a more radical reading of Kant than the one proposed by Martin: Kant was right to identify the unity of the content <b>of</b> <b>judgment</b> with the force <b>of</b> <b>judgment,</b> which entails that the subject matter of logic, insofar as it treats of relations <b>of</b> contents <b>of</b> <b>judgment,</b> and psychology, insofar as it treats <b>of</b> acts <b>of</b> <b>judgment,</b> is the same...|$|R

40|$|In the Critique of the Power <b>of</b> <b>Judgment,</b> Kant {{develops}} a rigorous formulation <b>of</b> aesthetic <b>judgments,</b> {{in which he}} makes a sharp distinction between <b>judgments</b> <b>of</b> taste and <b>judgments</b> <b>of</b> the agreeable (both of which are, I claim, types <b>of</b> aesthetic <b>judgments)</b> if only to dismiss <b>judgments</b> <b>of</b> the agreeable as worthy objects of study. Kant is primarily concerned with <b>judgments</b> <b>of</b> taste, the main example of which is judging something to be beautiful (whether it be {{a work of art}} or a natural object). He asserts that such judgments are subjective, universal, necessary, disinterested, and do not presuppose a purpose. The other type <b>of</b> aesthetic <b>judgment</b> are <b>judgments</b> <b>of</b> the agreeable, “which are the kind <b>of</b> <b>judgment</b> expressed by saying simply that one likes something or finds it pleasing. ” These are <b>judgments</b> <b>of</b> what, in Kant’s words, please “the senses in sensation” as opposed to pleasing ourcognition in reflection...|$|R

[...] Within Kant’s aesthetics, she has proposed a controversial interpretation <b>of</b> <b>judgments</b> <b>of</b> beauty as self-referential judgments which claim their own universal validity.
