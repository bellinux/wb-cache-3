He was brought here to talk football, and he broke that trust. Rush told us the social commentary for which he is so well known would not cross over to our show, and instead, he would represent the viewpoint of the intelligent, passionate fan. Rush Limbaugh was not a fit for NFL Countdown." ...|$|E

[...] If the state or the hospital had really wanted the right to enter employees' offices, it could have followed the example of the Mint and the Customs Service and promulgated a regulation stating that employees' property could be subject to search.|$|E

40|$|Thank you for {{the kind}} {{introduction}} and for the very clear summary of the arguments of Multicultural Citizenship. So I thought I’d just mention {{a couple of the}} ideas that I’ve been working with more recently. The first concerns this. There are two main types of groups that I’ve been thinking of - immigrant groups and national minorities. What kinds of rights are appropriate for these two different types of groups. I discuss this in the book. I’ve been thinking a little bit just about trying to be more precise about the types of institutions and policies that are appropriate for these two kinds of groups and I’ve changed the terminology a bit. I would now talk about these in terms of immigrant multiculturalism for immigrant groups and multi-nation federalism for national minorities. So let <b>me</b> <b>just</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> I hope it’s not dramatically different from what’s in the book but let me just clarify what I mean by those terms, because I will use them...|$|E

This is about one of those situations where the strange place that I ran into him was an awards show. I was seated a couple of seats {{away from him and}} there was so much that needed to be said, and neither one of us was willing to say it. We were both acting like we were engaged in conversations with people that we don't even know. It was just miserable.

[...] With which she came to him under the compulsion, again, that had united them shortly before, and took hold of him in her urgency to the same tender purpose. It was her form of entreaty renewed and repeated, which made after all, as he met it, their great fact clear. And it somehow clarified all things so to possess each other. The effect of it was that, once more, on these terms, he could only be generous. He had so on the spot then left everything {{to her that she}} reverted {{in the course of a}} few moments to one of her previous--and as positively seemed--her most precious ideas.

5000|$|Wired Magazine {{came out}} with a big exposé of [...] "the new atheists". I was interviewed for it—and yet I think I was {{included}} as a sidebar but not as a main feature and I think the main reason they did that was because they noticed that I wasn't that happy billing myself as an atheist. To <b>me</b> it <b>just</b> doesn't <b>say</b> <b>that</b> much; it doesn't say much about you. Instead I bill myself as a naturalist, which I think says a lot more. Because a naturalist is someone who... first of all—they study natural science, and they have a hopeful message—I think—to send to the world, which is... we can agree on what the truth is... {{and it has to be}} through experimentation, verification, and new discoveries, followed by more verification. So... if we can agree on those terms, we can agree that the truth changes, based on new discoveries, and the structure of science is such that you can never be so sure of something, because a new discovery can rework the framework—it can reconstruct the framework of your science and you have to look at the world differently. That makes it a very dynamic and exciting place to be. And if you say [...] "you're an atheist", it's not really saying much about how you came to that conclusion. But if you say [...] "you're a naturalist", I think it says something. You've reached that point because you've studied science, because you believe there's a fundamental way of looking at the world that is part of a long tradition. And so, I prefer naturalist.

6000|$|Nevertheless, {{they were}} happy in a boy and girl fashion, eating heartily, and, I fear, not always decorously; {{scrambling}} somewhat for the strawberries, and smacking their lips over the Sally Lunn. Meantime, it was arranged that Mr. Hamlin should inform Miss Mix that Sophy would leave school {{at the end of}} the term, only a few days hence, and then transfer herself to lodgings with some old family servants, where she could more easily pursue her studies in her own profession. She need not make her place of abode a secret, neither need she court publicity. She would write to Jack regularly, informing him of her progress, and he would visit her whenever he could. Jack assented gravely to the further proposition that he was to keep a strict account of all the moneys he advanced her, and that she was to repay him out of the proceeds of her first pictures. He had promised also, with a slight mental reservation, not to buy them all himself, but to trust to her success with the public. They were never to talk of what had happened before; she was to begin life anew. Of such were their confidences, spoken often together at the same moment, and with their mouths full. Only one thing troubled Jack; he had not yet told her frankly who he was and what was his reputation; he had hitherto carelessly supposed she would learn it, and in truth had cared little if she did; but it was evident from her conversation that day that by some miracle she was still in ignorance. Unable now to tell her himself, he had charged Hannibal to break it to her casually after he was gone. [...] "You can let me down easy if you like, but you'd better make a square deal of it while you're about it. And," [...] Jack had added cheerfully, [...] "if she thinks after that she'd better drop <b>me</b> entirely, you <b>just</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> if she wishes to STAY, you'll see that I don't ever come here again. And you keep your word about it too, you black nigger, or I'll be the first to thrash you." ...|$|R
