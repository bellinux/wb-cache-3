5|$|In {{the western}} Mojave Desert, human {{settlement}} and land development {{have led to}} an estimated 16-fold increase in the common raven population over 25 years. Towns, landfills, sewage treatment plants and artificial ponds create sources {{of food and water}} for scavenging birds. Ravens also find nesting sites in utility poles and ornamental trees, and are attracted to roadkill on highways. The explosion in the common raven population in the Mojave has raised concerns for the desert tortoise, a threatened species. Common ravens prey upon juvenile tortoises, which have soft shells and move slowly. Despite this, and there being no danger of extinction, the US Congress added ravens to the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918 in 1971. Plans to control the population have included shooting and trapping birds, as well as contacting landfill operators to ask that they reduce the amount of exposed garbage. A hunting bounty as a <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>control</b> was historically used in Finland from the mid-18th century until 1923. Culling has taken place to a limited extent in Alaska, where the population increase in common ravens is threatening the vulnerable Steller's eider (Polysticta stelleri).|$|E
5|$|Shooting {{by trained}} marksmen is {{considered}} to be the most practical <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>control</b> due to its effectiveness. The NSW Department of Primary Industries believe shooting is the preferred method of population control as it does not subject the horses to the stresses of mustering, yarding, and long-distance transportation, all of which are related to 'capture and removal' methods. Horses that are only initially wounded from shooting are tracked and dispatched if they are in accessible, open country. However, shooting of horses in mountain ranges is not regarded as a humane means of control. Helicopter shootings allow for aerial reconnaissance of a large area to target the densest populations, and shooters may get close enough to the target animals to ensure termination. This method is considered the most effective and cost efficient means of control, but disapproval is high amongst those that believe it is inhumane. Organizations supporting Brumbies argue that aerial shooting is unnecessary and that alternative population control methods have not been given adequate trials, while government officials express concern about the need to control rapidly growing populations in order to avoid ecological problems associated with too many feral horses in certain areas.|$|E

5|$|The primary {{method of}} {{controlling}} A. aegypti is by eliminating its habitats. This {{is done by}} getting rid of open sources of water, or {{if this is not}} possible, by adding insecticides or biological control agents to these areas. Generalized spraying with organophosphate or pyrethroid insecticides, while sometimes done, is not thought to be effective. Reducing open collections of water through environmental modification is the preferred <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>control,</b> given the concerns of negative health effects from insecticides and greater logistical difficulties with control agents. People can prevent mosquito bites by wearing clothing that fully covers the skin, using mosquito netting while resting, and/or the application of insect repellent (DEET being the most effective). However, these methods appear not to be sufficiently effective, as the frequency of outbreaks appears to be increasing in some areas, probably due to urbanization increasing the habitat of A. aegypti. The range of the disease appears to be expanding possibly due to climate change.|$|E

25|$|Research into {{methods to}} control the spread of E. sturtii {{initially}} focused on regeneration following severe fires in 1974 in the Ivanhoe (NSW) district. The results showed that E. sturtii was particularly good at regeneration after fire and ‘recovery seemed independent of burning conditions and shrub size’.

25|$|The main way {{to prevent}} malaria is through vector control. There are mostly three main forms that the vector can be controlled: (1)insecticide-treated {{mosquito}} nets, (2)indoor residual spraying and (3)antimalarial drugs. Long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLNs) are the preferred <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>control</b> {{because it is the}} most cost effective. The WHO is currently strategizing how to ensure that the net is properly maintained to protect people at risk. The second option is indoor residual spraying and has been proven effective if at least 80% of the homes are sprayed. However, such method is only effective for 3-6months. A drawback to these two methods, unfortunately, is that mosquito resistance against these insecticides has risen. National malaria control efforts are undergoing rapid changes to ensure the people are given the most effective method of vector control. Lastly, antimalarial drugs {{can also be used to}} prevent infection from developing into a clinical disease. However, there has also been an increase resistance to antimalarial medicine.|$|E
25|$|Nearly all DAPs {{consists}} {{of some kind}} of display screen, although there are exceptions, such as the iPod Shuffle, and a set of controls with which the user can browse through the library of music contained in the device, select a track, and play it back. The display, if the unit even has one, can be anything from a simple one or two line monochrome LCD display, similar to what are found on typical pocket calculators, to large, high-resolution, full-color displays capable of displaying photographs or viewing video content on. The controls can range anywhere from the simple buttons as are found on most typical CD players, such as for skipping through tracks or stopping/starting playback to full touch-screen controls, such as that found on the iPod Touch or the Zune HD. One of the more common methods of control is some type of the scroll wheel with associated buttons. This <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>control</b> was first introduced with the Apple iPod and many other manufacturers have created variants of this control scheme for their respective devices.|$|E

2500|$|Another form of {{chemical}} removal other than herbicides is soil solarization. Soil solarization is a thermal (heat) method that utilizes solar-enhanced heating {{of the soil}} to kill the root system of the plant, thereby avoiding the use of pesticides and other more dangerous (fire-based) means to control the plant. [...] Soil solarization affects the micronutrients and macronutrients in the soil. The most prominent effect of this <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>control</b> is the increase in potassium (K). The higher level of K in all soils undergoing solarization demonstrates the successful release of K from decomposing kudzu plant tissues. Such a rise in K levels by solarization is important for soils in the Southeastern United States that tend to be highly weathered and generally have low K contents.|$|E
