50|$|The {{mechanism}} of the Boekelheide reaction begins by an acyl transfer from the trifluoroacetic anhydride to the N-oxide oxygen. The α-methyl carbon is then deprotonated by the trifluoroacetate anion.

40|$|Photocatalytic {{oxidation}} of <b>methylpyridine</b> isomers (2 -methylpyridine, 3 -methylpyridine, and 4 -methylpyridine) {{was investigated}} in a mixed solution of acetonitrile and water or acetonitrile using various kinds of TiO 2 powders as photocatalysts. The main products from <b>methylpyridine</b> isomers were pyridinecarboxaldehyde isomers (2 -pyridinecarboxaldehyde, 3 -pyridinecarboxaldehyde, and 4 -pyridinecarboxaldehyde). Rutile large TiO 2 particles showed {{the highest level of}} activity for oxidation of 2 -methylpyridine probably because band bending was necessary for the oxidation of 2 -methylpyridine. On the other hand, a fine particle having an anatase or rutile phase showed a higher level of activity than large TiO 2 particles for oxidation of 3 -methylpyridine. A rutile fine particle showed the highest level of activity for the reaction. It was found that pure rutile or pure anatase particles were inactive for oxidation of 4 -mathylpyridine. If the particles are not extremely small, pure rutile and pure anatase powders show fairly high levels of activity, and those containing both anatase and rutile phases show the highest level of activity. The activity of pure rutile particles was also enhanced by physically mixing them {{with a small amount of}} small anatase particles, which were inactive for this reaction. These results can be explained by the synergism between rutile and anatase particles. All of these reactions effectively proceeded even under anaerobic conditions. Photocatalytic reduction of <b>methylpyridine</b> isomers concomitantly proceeded on TiO 2 particles under the conditions used. These results suggest that the activities of TiO 2 photocatalysts for oxidation of <b>methylpyridine</b> isomers are dominated by the oxidation potential of alkylpiridine and band bending of TiO 2 particles...|$|E

40|$|An {{organism}} {{capable of}} growth on pyridine was isolated from soil by enrichment culture techniques and identified as Micrococcus luteus. The organism oxidized pyridine for energy and released N {{contained in the}} pyridine ring as ammonium. The organism could not grow on mono- or disubstituted pyridinecarboxylic acids or hydroxy-, chloro-, amino-, or <b>methylpyridines.</b> Cell extracts of M. luteus could not degrade pyridine, 2 -, 3 -, or 4 -hydroxypyridines or 2, 3 -dihydroxypyridine, regardless of added cofactors or cell particulate fraction.

Cell extracts of M. luteus had constitutive amidase activity, and washed cells degraded formate and formamide without a lag. These data are consistent with a previously reported pathway for pyridine metabolism by species of Bacillus, Brevibacterium, and Corynebacterium. Cells of M. luteus were permeable to pyridinecarboxylic acids, monohydroxypyridines, 2, 3 -dihydroxypyridine, and monoamino- and <b>methylpyridines.</b> The results provide new evidence that the metabolism of pyridine by microorganisms does not require initial hydroxylation of the ring and that permeability barriers do {{not account for the}} extremely limited range of substrate isomers used by pyridine degraders...|$|R

So far as the selectivity of the pyridine formation is concerned, close results are obtained on H-ZSM- 5 zeolite: the pyridine/picoline ratio of ≈ 1 / 1; the content of lutidines is for practical purposes, the same as on the H-Beta catalyst. It is worth to mention the higher selectivity of the “heavy-products” formation as compared to H-Beta zeolite. A distinction of the H-ZSM- 12 zeolite catalyst is the higher content of methyl- and dimethylpyridines in the {{reaction products}} amounting about 77  % of the pyridine total.

40|$|Our {{review of}} the {{metabolic}} pathways of pyridines and aza-arenes showed that biodegradation of heterocyclic aromatic compounds occurs under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions.

Our review indicated that different organisms are using different pathways to biotransform a substrate. Our review also showed that the transformation rate of the pyridine derivatives is dependent on the substituents. For example, pyridine carboxylic acids have the highest transformation rate followed by mono-hydroxypyridines, <b>methylpyridines,</b> aminopyridines, and halogenated pyridines. Through the isolation of metabolites, it was possible to demonstrate the mineralization pathway of various heterocyclic aromatic compounds. By using 14 C-labeled substrates, it was possible to show that ring fission of a specific heterocyclic compound occurs at a specific position of the ring. Furthermore, many researchers have been able to isolate and characterize the microorganisms or even the enzymes involved in the transformation of these compounds or their derivatives. In studies involving 18 O labeling as well as the use of cofactors and coenzymes, it was possible to prove that specific enzymes (e. g., mono- or dioxygenases) are involved in a particular degradation step.

40|$|Graduation date: 1990 The {{relative}} {{rates of}} hydrogen atom abstraction {{from a series}} of 13 homoaryl and heteroarylmethanes by the nucleophilic undecyl radical, thermally generated from lauroyl peroxide, were determined at 70 °C. A reactivity range of 15 was obtained. Substantial differences in reactivity among isomers were found. The relative reactivities of the compounds studied were correlated with SCF-PPP calculated energy differences. Modest correlation was obtained when a carbanion model was used for the transitions state (r = 0. 88). Much poorer correlations were obtained when either a carbocation or radical was used to model the transition state. Best correlations were obtained when the logarithms of the relative rates of hydrogen atom abstraction are plotted against those for base catalyzed hydrogen-deuterium exchange (r = 0. 91). These results are suggestive of substantial negative charge development in the transition state. The free-radical reduction of all isomers of chioromethylpyridine and chloromethylquinoline with triphenyltin hydride at 70 °C was also investigated. Small differences in reactivity among isomers were found. A reactivity range of ca. 4. 5 was obtained. This is much smaller than the reactivity range found for hydrogen atom abstraction from <b>methylpyridines</b> and methylquinolines by undecyl radical. This is rather surprising since Hammett studies suggest that the selectivities in these two systems should be at least comparable. It is felt that the rate determining step might involve an electron transfer rather than direct atom abstraction. Good results (r = 0. 94) are obtained for correlation involving plotting the logarithms of the experimental relative rates against the logarithms of the corresponding calculated relative rates using a four parameter equation based on SCF relative LUMO energy differences of the parent unsubstituted systems and SCF total energy differences for a carbanion model...|$|R

The neutron single crystal diffraction instruments SXD and VIVALDI have been used to provide conclusive results in cases of suspected unusual hydrogen bond behaviour in molecular materials. 2, 4 -dihydroxybenzoic acid and its isomer 2, 5 -dihydroxybenzoic acid have been examined using X-ray and neutron diffraction to investigate possible disordered cooperative hydrogen bond systems. The energy difference of the three possible tautomers of 2, 4 -dihydroxybenzoic acid in different environments have been calculated in theoretical computations which concur with the neutron results. Single crystal neutron diffraction experiments were also carried out on isonicotinamidium formate, 2 -iodoaniliium picrate, chloranilic acid 2, 4 -lutidine and malonic acid, where unusual behaviour in the hydrogen systems was also suspected. The molecular complexes of chloranilic acid with various pyridine-based molecules have been the main focus of the X-ray diffraction work of this thesis. Multiple crystallisations over a range of different conditions were set up for chloranilic acid with various series of molecules including lutidines (dimethylpyridines) and picolines (<b>methylpyridines).</b> This resulted in a large number of new crystal structures, determined by X-ray diffraction and all found to contain a bifurcated hydrogen bond motif producing two robust hydrogen-bonded supramolecular synthons.
