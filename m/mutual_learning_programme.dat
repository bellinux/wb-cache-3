40|$|Over {{the last}} decades, {{a phase of}} {{experimental}} social policy has emerged in the EU {{in the wake of}} various generations of funding programmes and projects that actively encouraged transnational exchange and <b>mutual</b> <b>learning.</b> Underlying these <b>programmes</b> are a number of assumptions: that transnational exchange will lead to individual learning, that individual learning will lead to organisational learning and that the result of organisational learning will be changes to policy and practice. These assumptions were tested using an EU-funded project named ‘Local Strategies for the Active Inclusion of Young People facing multiple disadvantages—Com. In’. This project was carried out by local authorities, NGOs and research organisations in four European cities from 2011 to 2013. The results demonstrate a number of barriers to moving from transnational exchange to changes to policy and practice. However, it also identified inter- and intra-agency relationships as a key area where positive change could come about and the conditions that made such change possible. The role of ‘institutional entrepreneurs’ is shown to be crucial to exploiting the exceptional setting created by the exchange and initiating a change process...|$|R

40|$|<b>Mutual</b> <b>learning</b> is a {{fundamental}} element in transdisciplinary (Td) sustainability research. It allows for integrating knowledge and experiences gained in different contexts, including the building of consensus about necessary transformations to reach sustainability solutions. To successfully achieve <b>mutual</b> <b>learning,</b> appropriate conditions are required. These range from providing boundary objects that serve knowledge integration, {{the development of a}} common language and knowledge, and shared experiences to transparency concerning the objectives and motives of all those involved. <b>Mutual</b> <b>learning</b> is particularly challenging from an intercultural perspective in both local and global processes. Interaction among the participants is based on experiential, educational, and cultural dimensions that induce different types of knowledge and cognition, thought styles, socializations, constraints and preferences in socio-political structures and day-to-day practices. In this article, formats of case-based <b>Mutual</b> <b>Learning</b> Sessions (cbMLS) that organize <b>mutual</b> <b>learning</b> based on a single case or a set of cases are presented. The different formats have been developed and studied {{in the context of a}} global Td process on phosphorus management (i. e., the Global TraPs project). After presenting the formats of cbMLS, the paper presents the first results from an empirical, integrated qualitative study based on interviews and observations, and discusses potentials and limitations of cbMLS, in particular their application in an international context. We further highlight challenges and learning experiences that have to be met in Td <b>mutual</b> <b>learning</b> processes...|$|R

40|$|<b>Mutual</b> <b>learning</b> {{of a pair}} of tree parity {{machines}} with continuous and discrete weight vectors is studied analytically. The analysis is based on a mapping procedure that maps the <b>mutual</b> <b>learning</b> in tree parity machines onto <b>mutual</b> <b>learning</b> in noisy perceptrons. The stationary solution of the <b>mutual</b> <b>learning</b> in the case of continuous tree parity machines depends on the learning rate where a phase transition from partial to full synchronization is observed. In the discrete case the learning process is based on a finite increment and a full synchronized state is achieved in a finite number of steps. The synchronization of discrete parity machines is introduced in order to construct an ephemeral key-exchange protocol. The dynamic learning of a third tree parity machine (an attacker) that tries to imitate one of the two machines while the two still update their weight vectors is also analyzed. In particular, the synchronization times of the naive attacker and the flipping attacker recently introduced in [1] are analyzed. All analytical results are found to be in good agreement with simulation results...|$|R

40|$|Model {{distillation}} is {{an effective}} and widely used technique to transfer knowledge from a teacher to a student network. The typical application is to transfer from a powerful large network or ensemble to a small network, that is better suited to low-memory or fast execution requirements. In this paper, we present a deep <b>mutual</b> <b>learning</b> (DML) strategy where, rather than one way transfer between a static pre-defined teacher and a student, an ensemble of students learn collaboratively and teach each other throughout the training process. Our experiments show {{that a variety of}} network architectures benefit from <b>mutual</b> <b>learning</b> and achieve compelling results on CIFAR- 100 recognition and Market- 1501 person re-identification benchmarks. Surprisingly, it is revealed that no prior powerful teacher network is necessary [...] <b>mutual</b> <b>learning</b> of a collection of simple student networks works, and moreover outperforms distillation from a more powerful yet static teacher.

The international exchanges also helped strengthening connections between local government and non-governmental actors in the involved countries. The potential for <b>mutual</b> <b>learning</b> was however not fully utilised due to the absence of clear learning strategies, existing language barriers and the lack of strategic involvement of other actors...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this article is to analyze how {{learning}} occurs in inter-organizational online communities, despite highly diverse even conflicting knowledge claims among participants. Design/methodology/approach – We compared two inter-organizational communities in the domain of development aid through inductive qualitative case study. Findings – We found that diverse communities proved more likely to yield conflicting knowledge claims in terms of expertise, value consensus and formal position. However, they were also better positioned for enabling <b>mutual</b> <b>learning,</b> than communities with a more uniform representation. Research limitations/implications – We provide theoretical insights for knowledge management by showing how the negotiation of knowledge claims facilitates <b>mutual</b> <b>learning</b> in inter-organizational online communities. Practical implications – The findings are practically relevant for managers of knowledge-intensive organizations by showing how knowledge is shared in diverse online communities. The research also shows that the recognized challenges which diverse communities can yield are likely to be outweighed by their benefits: enabling <b>mutual</b> <b>learning,</b> generating useful expertise and a stronger negotiating position. Social implications – The paper conceives of a development approach that is more inclusive of non-dominant perspectives and solutions in decision-making processes, contributing to improved participation of marginalized people in decision-making processes. Originality/value – We add a new dimension to knowledge management literature, showing how conflict and learning can be a mutually reinforcing process. Contrary to prior knowledge-based views, we found that a diverse community, with a higher concentration of conflicting knowledge claims, facilitated <b>mutual</b> <b>learning</b> more adeptly than a more uniform community. This is important for knowledge management theory and practice because it shows how inter-organizational communities can benefit from heterogeneity, and how conflict can enable and even strengthen <b>mutual</b> <b>learning...</b>|$|R
