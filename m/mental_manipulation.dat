Longitudinal studies of gifted children indicate that visuospatial imagery plays {{a pivotal role in}} exceptional achievements in science and mathematics. We asked whether visuospatial imagery is enhanced in individuals with schizophrenia (SZ). We compared SZ and matched healthy controls (HC) on five visuospatial tasks tapping parietal and frontoparietal functions. Two aspects of visuospatial transformation, spatial location and <b>mental</b> imagery <b>manipulation</b> were examined with Paper Folding Test and Jigsaw Puzzle Task, respectively. Visuospatial intelligence was assessed with Ravens Progressive Matrices, which is associated with frontoparietal network activity. Hemispatial inattention implicating parietal function was assessed with line bisection task. Mediated by prefrontal cortex, spatial delayed response task was used to index working memory maintenance, which was impaired in SZ compared to HC. In contrast, SZ showed intact visuospatial intelligence and transformation of location. Further, SZ performed significantly better than HC on jigsaw puzzle task indicating enhanced <b>mental</b> imagery <b>manipulation.</b> Spatial working memory maintenance and <b>mental</b> imagery <b>manipulation</b> were strongly associated in HC but dissociated in SZ. Thus, we observed enhanced <b>mental</b> imagery <b>manipulation</b> in SZ but the dissociation of mental imagery from working memory suggests a disrupted frontoparietal network. Finally, while HC showed the expected leftward pseudoneglect, SZ showed increased rightward line bisection bias implicating left hemispatial inattention and impaired right parietal control of spatial attention. The current results chart a unique profile of impaired, spared and enhanced parietal-mediated visuospatial functions implicating parietal abnormalities as a biobehavioral marker for SZ. We discuss these results in relation to creative cognition...|$|R

Mikhail teleported himself and his brother to another dimension that was a series of rocky caves. Not wanting to physically kill his brother, he decided to leave him in the rock dimension where he would die in a matter of weeks. However, away from Sinister for a period of time, he was able to overcome his <b>mental</b> <b>manipulations</b> and came to his senses, rescuing his brother. His final decision was to teleport to a world named The Dark Zone, a dimension from which it was impossible to return and also once entered, impossible to die in. This protected the rest of the Rasputin line from the depredations of Sinister as at some point Mikhail would have been the sole surviving Rasputin, which would then trap his ancestor in the dark zone. Colossus tried to persuade him to save himself, but Mikhail determined that it would be best for the possible problem and for his own insanity.|$|R

However, Jones managed to free Archangel, and the Ravens were defeated with the assistance of X-Factor and two members of the X-Men, the mutant techno-wizard Forge and the sonic-screaming Banshee. As a result of their brief psychic linking, Archangel admitted that it was Jones' courage that helped him overcome the Ravens' control.

40|$|We {{designed}} our own cognitive task {{to evaluate}} and to train approximate number system (ANS) in preschoolers. In our research we use EEG for understanding this type of brain activity, but this task {{can also be used}} for evaluating behavioral responses. More accurately, our task is based on approximate number comparison, which is one of two basic ANS cognitive functions. We do so regarding two basic reasons. Firstly, preschoolers are incapable of more complex <b>mental</b> <b>manipulations</b> (e. g. number conservation) and therefore we believe the type second type of ANS function (approximate arithmetic) is not suitable owing to its difficulty. Following reason is negative influence of the task's spatial architecture on EEG signal. For instance, if participants are shown two different quantities on a computer screen (yellow dots on the right and blue dots on the left) and we want them to say which is more, they have to move their eyes from left to right (or else from right to left) to view both of the numerical quantities. Eye movements have negative influence on spatial architecture of the task on EEG signal that is in a form of noise (artifact) significantly devaluing the signal. For this reason we separate the screen with central cross and place the quantity into the centre. In our recently published research (Plassová et al., 2016) we confirmed that using our paradigm we are able to stimulate brain activity in intraparietal sulcus, which is basically the neuroanatomical centre of ANS...|$|R
30|$|In {{addition}} to {{the advantages of the}} proposed method we described in previous sections, we introduced an experimental task in order to evaluate multi-user interaction toolkits -like the one proposed in this work- on multi-touch surfaces. Based on our observations, the dot-to-dot collaborative task we chose while developing the evaluation strategy of the proposed interaction techniques proved to be a valid decision. Despite the fact of being mainly a physical performance task—a task that involves physical behaviour as opposed to symbolic, or <b>mental</b> <b>manipulations,</b> [18] or [28]—it produced valuable results and shed light to users’ strategies while collaborating on the screen. Users tried to improve their time, used verbal communication, pointed others what to do, helped each other, worked in parallel or isolated in a partition of the screen and tried to resolve conflicts. Users were mainly focused on the interaction and on completing the puzzle-style task and saw it as a battle between them and the other teams that had completed the task previously with a better time. Based on our experience with the dot-to-dot collaborative task, its main advantages are: (a) it is a simple to administer task, (b) it is a traditionally played game and thus does not demand knowledge from the users, (c) it is fast and enhances competitiveness among different teams or cooperation among teams’ members, (d) it demands coordination skills and it also demands from the users to be aware of what other users do, (e) it allows for either working in parallel or performing joint work (as the task used by [28]) and (f) it is effective in producing reproducible results.|$|R
40|$|Younger {{and older}} college {{students}} judged whether letters, rotated from 0 to 180 degrees away from normal, upright position, were standard letters or mirror-images of standard letters. The analysis separated basic {{speed of response}} from {{the rate at which}} <b>mental</b> <b>manipulations</b> of the images of the letters took place. With letters from the English alphabet, younger (mean age, 21. 6 years) and older (mean age 55. 9 years) subjects did not differ either in basic speed or in rate of manipulation. With un-familiar, lower-case Greek letters, however, the basic speed of older subjects (mean age, 56. 5 years) was slower than that of younger subjects (mean age, 21. 2 years) while {{there was no difference in}} rate of manipulation. The results are inconsistent with an hypothesis of general slowing of central nervous system activity. IT is a common finding that there is a markeddecline in the speed of response with ad-vancing age (see Welford, 1977, for a review). The source of the lengthened reaction time could lie at any stage in the processing se-quence. Birren (1974) has suggested that the aging individual undergoes a generalized slow-ing of activity in the central nervous system that, in turn, impairs all processes involved in normal functioning. This hypothesis implies that the degenerative changes that occur with age are global and will, therefore, attack cen-tral, cognitive functions such as imagery, transformation, and judgement as profoundly as more peripheral processes such as sensory acuity or the execution of motor sequences. In fact, Birren argues that higher cognitive processes would be disproportionally damaged by this generalized slowing, since larger numbers of neural components would be in-volved in these more complex mental activi-ties, and the effects of reduced speed at each juncture would be cumulative...|$|R

40|$|The {{current study}} {{examined}} {{the question of what}} type of instructional strategy most effectively facilitates the learning of music intervals for beginning music majors. The three types of instructional strategy were programmed instruction {{in the form of a}} linear programmed text, mastery learning using computer-assisted instruction (CAI), and self-practice using a textbook-study approach. This study also explored the variable of information retention overtime. The delayed-retention test was given 48 hours after the test of immediate retention. Results on the dependent measure of retention indicated that mastery learning-CAl was a significantly better instructional strategy for learning music intervals than programmed instruction or self-practice. The results indicated a significantly higher performance score for mastery learning-CAl and programmed in-struction over self-practice. The self-practice condition was left at a disadvantage in this regard because the learner had to decide what was relevant and what must be learned from what should be ignored. The attitude measure result indicated that learners prefer instructional information to be well organized. The learner's cognitive or <b>mental</b> <b>manipulations</b> on to-be-learned in-formation forms a major determinant in the potential effectiveness of his or her processing of information (Dansereau, Actkinson, Long, & McDonald, Note 1). The effective cognitive organization of newly en-countered information is the basis for successful information processing. Effective cognitive organization means that the learner has gone beyond mere rote learning of data and has successfully assimilated new informa-tion into his or her existing knowledge structure. The effective information processing of to-be-learned information can be significantly facilitated when the learner uses a learning strategy that aids his or her cognitive organization of to-be-acquired information (Hil-gard & Bower, 1975). It has now been shown that learners can be taught information processing strategies that facilitate their cognitive organiza-tion of academic material and thus improve learning (Bower, 1973).

40|$|Background: The {{study is}} {{concerned}} with the cognitive abilities of children with specific language impairment (SLI). Previous research has indicated that children with SLI demonstrate difficulties with certain cognitive tasks despite normal non‐verbal IQ scores. It has been suggested that a general processing limitation might account for the pattern of language and cognitive difficulties seen in children with SLI. The performances on a visuo‐spatial short‐term memory task and a visuo‐spatial processing task were considered in a group of young children with SLI. Verbal short‐term memory was also measured. Aims: To identify whether children with SLI demonstrate difficulties with visuo‐spatial memory as well as verbal short‐term memory. To see whether a visuo‐spatial processing task without short‐term memory requirements is problematic for children with SLI. To consider performance on these tasks over time. Methods & Procedures: Nine children with SLI (mean age 3; 9 years at the study outset) and nine typically developing children (mean age 3; 9 years at the study outset) were visited on three occasions over 1 year. Verbal short‐term memory, visuo‐spatial short‐term memory and visuo‐spatial processing tasks were administered to the children, and performance over time was compared between the two groups. Outcomes & Results: The children with SLI performed at a lower level than the typically developing children on the verbal short‐term memory task. Both groups showed similar development on the verbal short‐term memory task and the visuo‐spatial processing task over time. Only the visuo‐spatial short‐term memory task showed slower development over time in the children with SLI relative to the typically developing children. Conclusions: Children with SLI demonstrated slower development on a visuo‐spatial short‐term memory task relative to typically developing children of the same chronological age. This finding has implications for speech and language therapists and other professionals working with children with SLI. It may mean that only certain types of visual support are suitable, and that children with SLI will have difficulty with tasks requiring a high level of processing, or a number of <b>mental</b> <b>manipulations...</b>|$|R
