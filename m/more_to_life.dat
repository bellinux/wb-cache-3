Managing the tour's first goal, against Rio de Janeiro, he also scored against Paulistano and made quite a name for himself. In 1914, he again set sail with the Corinthians for Brazil...however this tour was {{cancelled}} when still at sea, the side discovered War had been declared at home. At once, the Corinthians decided, true to their ethos that there was <b>more</b> <b>to</b> <b>life</b> than just sport, to return and join the army. After a quick stop in Rio, allowing the players a brief walk around the town, they set sail for home. Dodging German U-Boats and torpedo fire, they eventually made it back to England. For Max, it would be his last adventure abroad with Corinthian FC.|$|E

500|$|Jackson {{recorded}} with Queen singer Freddie Mercury from 1981 to 1983, including a demo of [...] "State of Shock", [...] "Victory" [...] and [...] "There Must Be <b>More</b> <b>to</b> <b>Life</b> Than This". The recordings were intended for {{an album of}} duets but, according to Queen's then-manager Jim Beach, {{the relationship between the}} singers soured when Jackson insisted on bringing a llama into the recording studio. The collaborations were not officially released until 2014. Jackson went on to record the single [...] "State of Shock" [...] with Mick Jagger for the Jacksons' album Victory (1984). Mercury included the solo version of [...] "There Must Be <b>More</b> <b>To</b> <b>Life</b> Than This" [...] on his Mr. Bad Guy album (1985). In 1982, Jackson combined his interests in songwriting and film when he contributed the song [...] "Someone in the Dark" [...] to the storybook for the film E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial.

500|$|During the 2008 season, {{political}} {{discussions were}} {{common in the}} Maryland locker room because of the presidential election. Turner and fellow quarterback Jordan Steffy, a conservative and supporter of presidential candidate Senator John McCain, were the most frequent debaters, while defensive tackle Dean Muhtadi was described as the primary instigator. During the summer of 2009, Turner held an internship on Capitol Hill working for Democratic Representative Steny Hoyer, the House Majority Leader and Maryland's fifth district congressman. Turner had previously considered volunteering for the presidential campaign of Barack Obama, which he said probably annoyed his conservative father, John Turner. Describing his experience during the internship, Turner said, [...] "It's funny to compare how serious politics is and how serious football is.

500|$|A main {{element of}} Debuts sound is its {{incorporation}} of dance music, reflecting the contemporary styles of London's club culture, {{with which the}} singer had established close ties. While the echoes of subgenres such as Euro-house, acid jazz, worldbeat and IDM can be noted, [...] "they hadn't yet broken free from the primal thump of four-on-the-floor house music." [...] Tom Breihan of Stereogum asserts that [...] "even as dance music took on all these new sounds, that basic pulse was still {{the most important thing}} about it, and that pulse reverberates all through Debut." [...] Björk said: [...] "A lot of the songs on my record have dance beats, but I think they're beats that are more reflective of daily life—like life in the middle of the day in a city, as opposed to the night life of the clubs." [...] The [...] "four-on-the-floor" [...] style —typical of house music— is mostly evident in songs such as [...] "Human Behaviour", [...] "Crying", [...] "Big Time Sensuality", [...] "There's <b>More</b> <b>to</b> <b>Life</b> Than This" [...] and [...] "Violently Happy". Björk felt house music was [...] "the only pop music that [...] truly modern," [...] stating in 1993 that it was [...] "the only music where anything creative is happening today." ...|$|E

500|$|De Fratus is {{a devout}} Roman Catholic who, {{though he was}} raised in a large Catholic family, {{struggled}} with his faith after an injury early in his career, but ultimately determined the injury was a gift from God to help him better understand his faith: [...] "I really feel that the setback was God telling me, ‘Hey you are not done. [...] You are not done yet figuring out what you need to figure out, and I am {{going to give you a}} little more time.’ [...] There is a big reason why that injury happened and I feel that I used it as best as I could have." [...] He noted that he would like to take classes at a seminary to help proselytize to others. Early in his professional career, he struggled to find fellow Catholics, and noted that most of his teammates were either Protestants or not religious. Moreover, in many small towns that house minor league teams, there are no Catholic churches, so De Fratus found it easy to slide away from leading a Catholic lifestyle. However, upon realizing that there is <b>more</b> <b>to</b> <b>life</b> than material success, he discovered a need for God, and has thus developed his faith. Aside from his faith, he enjoys writing and recording music, and playing the guitar. He has two brothers, the older of whom, Steve, played in the minor leagues, and the younger of whom, Chris, caught a foul ball during De Fratus's major league debut.|$|E
500|$|Album opener [...] "Human Behaviour" [...] {{features}} a [...] "bouncing riff" [...] sampled from Antônio Carlos Jobim, with [...] "its syncopated beat consigned to a venerable orchestral instrument, the timpani." [...] Its lyrics [...] refer to Björk's {{experience as a}} child, finding the behaviour of adults [...] "rather chaotic and nonsensical," [...] instead finding harmony with other children, nature and animals. Inspired by naturalist David Attenborough, she sings {{from the point of}} view of an animal, with its opening line being [...] "If you ever get close to a human/And human behaviour/Be ready, be ready to get confused". Following track [...] "Crying" [...] shows a contradiction between its [...] "bubbly, shiny-surfaced acid disco-pop" [...] sound and lyrics that describe the turmoil of feeling alienated in a big city. [...] "Venus as a Boy" [...] —considered an ambient track by Rolling Stone— reflected Björk's newly found interest in Bollywood, having befriended people of Indian origin in London, most notably Talvin Singh. In a spontaneous fashion, the song's strings —and also those of [...] "Come to Me"— were recorded by a fim studio orchestra in India. The lyrics of the track are about the sensitivity of her then boyfriend Dominic Thrupp, with lyrics that have been described as [...] "sweet and just the slightest bit naughty." [...] In the dancefloor-oriented [...] "There's <b>More</b> <b>to</b> <b>Life</b> Than This", Björk leaves romance behind, with [...] "her mischievous side [...] to the fore". Its lyrics were inspired by a party she attended and promptly left. [...] "Like Someone in Love" [...] is one of the several jazz standards the singer recorded with Corky Hale, with her voice [...] "cradled in harp and swoony strings." ...|$|E
500|$|I'm Going to Tell You a Secret {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. O'Brien noted how the film revealed a [...] "strange isolation {{at the cost}} of stardom" [...] from Madonna. She complimented the scenes featuring her father, and the scenes where Madonna was not self-conscious, like when she interacts with her children, talks about her [...] "fat Italian thighs" [...] and also the performance in rain at Dublin. O'Brien criticized other portions of the film, which she said was [...] "affected" [...] by conscious behavior in front of the camera, like backstage parties, poem and piano recitals. Author J. Randy Taraborrelli wrote in his book [...] that the film allowed a much closer look at the singer's family. He was particularly impressed by the scenes featuring Lourdes, believing that she [...] "revealed herself to be sophisticated beyond her years". Kathryn Flett from The Observer newspaper described it as [...] "Fascinating, [...] tiny flashes of insight into her relationship with , which occasionally involve her being just as girlie and ever so slightly insecure as the rest of us." [...] Rupert Smith from The Guardian reported that the director [...] "squeezed every last drop of spectacle from a highly stage-managed performance", but commented that [...] "she gave away far more in 1991's In Bed with Madonna; this time she gave only the illusion of candour". However, he complimented saying [...] "Even the easy-to-mock pre-show prayers brought a tear to the eye. We don't need to be told that 'there's <b>more</b> <b>to</b> <b>life</b> than fame and fortune– something deeper, more profound', or that 'the material world' is a bad thing.

2500|$|The band {{spent much}} of 2005 in the studio in Glasgow working on their {{follow-up}} album, You Could Have It So Much Better, which was released on 3 October 2005. The band initially intended to leave the album self-titled like their debut, but they changed it to You Could Have It So Much Better...With Franz Ferdinand before settling on the final title. The album's cover design was modelled on Alexander Rodchenko's 1924 portrait of Lilya Brik. The band attempted to broaden its musical range on the album; Hardy said, [...] "There's <b>more</b> <b>to</b> <b>life</b> than disco-beat guitar music". It was generally well received {{in the press and}} seen as an album equal to, or better than, their first by most critics. It entered the UK Album Charts at Number 1 and the US charts at Number 8. The album eventually sold 2 million copies worldwide. To support the album, four singles were released. Included in that set is a double A-side single that contained a video-clip-only single as well (both the AA-side [...] "L. Wells" [...] and the video-clip [...] "Jeremy Fraser" [...] are not featured on the album, recorded in early 2006 during the band's tour of Australia in support of the album). Also included is another video-clip-only single called [...] "Wine, In the Afternoon" [...] which is the B-side to [...] "Eleanor Put Your Boots On", and was also not featured on the album, but recorded on tour in Michigan.
