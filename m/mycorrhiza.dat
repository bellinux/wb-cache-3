5|$|The {{roots of}} Epacris impressa are colonized by fungi forming ericoid <b>mycorrhiza.</b> It is {{believed}} that the fungal species vary between regions.|$|E
5|$|A mutualistic {{association}} {{similar to}} ectomycorrhiza {{but with some}} hyphae penetrating into the plant root cells, termed arbutoid <b>mycorrhiza,</b> is formed by Russulaceae with shrubs of the genera Arbutus and Arctostaphylos, both in subfamily Arbutoideae of the Ericaceae.|$|E
5|$|Some Russulaceae are {{associated}} with myco-heterotrophic plants of the Ericaceae subfamily Monotropoideae, forming monotropoid <b>mycorrhiza.</b> This is an epiparasitic relationship, where the heterotrophic plant ultimately derives its carbon from the primary, ectomycorrhizal plant partner of the fungus. The association is often very specific, with the heterotrophic plants only associating with selected fungus partners, including Russulaceae.|$|E
5000|$|Mycorrhizae- <b>Mycorrhizae</b> {{are similar}} to rhizobia in that they {{interact}} with plants at their roots. Whereas Rhizobia are bacteria that fix nitrogen, <b>mycorrhizas</b> are fungi that bring nutrients to the plants in return for carbon. <b>Mycorrhizas</b> are also capable of improving water uptake and communicating to their hosts to resist to pathogens. Three main types of <b>mycorrhizae</b> exist: ...|$|R
25|$|<b>Mycorrhizas</b> {{are present}} in 92% of plant {{families}} studied (80% of species), with arbuscular <b>mycorrhizas</b> being the ancestral and predominant form, and the most prevalent symbiotic association found in the plant kingdom. The structure of arbuscular <b>mycorrhizas</b> has been highly conserved since their first appearance in the fossil record, with both the development of ectomycorrhizas, {{and the loss of}} <b>mycorrhizas,</b> evolving convergently on multiple occasions.|$|R
50|$|<b>Mycorrhizae</b> {{include a}} broad variety of root-fungi {{interactions}} characterized by mode of colonization. Essentially all plants form mycorrhizal associations, {{and there is}} evidence that some <b>mycorrhizae</b> transport carbon and other nutrients not just from soil to plant, but also between different plants in a landscape. The main groups include ectomycorrhizae, arbuscular mycorhizae, ericoid <b>mycorrhizae,</b> orchid <b>mycorrhizae,</b> and monotropoid <b>mycorrhizae.</b> Monotropoid <b>mycorrhizae</b> are associated with plants in the monotropaceae, which lack chlorophyll. Many Orchids are also achlorophyllous for at least part of their life cycle. Thus these mycorrhizal-plant relationships are unique because the fungus provides the host with carbon as well as other nutrients, often by parasitizing other plants. Achlorophyllous plants forming these types of mycorrhizal associations are called mycoheterotrophs.|$|R
5|$|The white, porous {{hymenium}} has a {{thickness of}} 1–2mm and turns brown when bruised. Per millimeter, {{there are two}} to three square pores. When dried, the hymenium's color becomes pinkish-brown. The hymenium extends slightly down the stipe, and is sharply defined. Dried tissue smells similar to fenugreek. The morphology of the <b>mycorrhiza</b> {{has not yet been}} described; however, as with all other types of Boletopsis {{it is likely to be}} ectomycorrhizal.|$|E
5|$|Historically, Sarcosphaera coronaria {{has been}} {{assumed to be}} saprobic, {{acquiring}} nutrients from breaking down decaying organic matter. The fungus, however, is only found with trees known to form <b>mycorrhiza,</b> and it is often locally abundant where it occurs, year after year in the same location, indicative of a mycorrhizal lifestyle. The results of a 2006 study of Pezizalean fungi further suggest that the species is an ectomycorrhizal symbiont, and more generally, that the Pezizales include more ectomycorrhizal fungi than previously thought.|$|E
5|$|Russulaceae {{are also}} an {{important}} group of orchid mycorrhizal fungi. This symbiosis is mutualistic {{in the case of}} green orchids, but a partly or fully epiparasitic relationship in the case of myco-heterotrophic and mixotrophic orchids, respectively. In some cases, the association with Russulaceae is, as in monotropoid <b>mycorrhiza,</b> very specific: the Mediterranean orchid Limodorum abortivum predominantly associates with Russula delica and closely related species; in Corallorhiza maculata, different genotypes of the same species have distinct Russula partners.|$|E

40|$|This project {{sought to}} examine whether it was {{possible}} to re-introduce naturally occurring soil fungi called vesicular arbuscular (VA) <b>mycorrhizae</b> back into disturbed soils as part of a normal seeding operation for restoring a prairie. The project consisted of three phases; 1) a survey to determine the types of VA <b>mycorrhizae</b> occurring in different soils and vegetation types (i. e. general roadside, prairie remnant, prairie planting); 2) collect from the wild and then grow prairie VA <b>mycorrhizae</b> species in a greenhouse at the University of Minnesota; 3) install the VA <b>mycorrhizae</b> along with seed from a conventional native seed drill and monitor whether the cultured VA <b>mycorrhizae</b> formed mycotrophic associations with prairie species in the field. This project was a preliminary feasibility study and was not intended to answer long term questions regarding the possible benefits VA <b>mycorrhizae</b> may confer to roadside plantings or other prairie restorations. All phases of the project were successful. The survey indicated that differences in VA <b>mycorrhizae</b> composition exist between different sites. It is possible to produce VA <b>mycorrhizae</b> in a greenhouse by culturing on living plant hosts. The VA <b>mycorrhizae</b> produced was successfully installed along with seed into field plots and did form mycotrophic associations with newly planted prairie species.

5|$|Amanita regalis is a {{rare species}} {{typically}} found growing {{on the ground in}} mountainous forests, both deciduous and coniferous. It is a mycorrhizal fungus, and exists in a symbiotic relationship with certain tree species. The system of fine below-ground threads, the mycelium, envelopes the roots of the trees and supplies them with needed minerals, trace elements and water from the soil, while the tree, in turn, supplies the fungus with food from its own supply, which it produces through photosynthesis. A.regalis has been shown experimentally to form <b>mycorrhiza</b> with birch, Scots pine, Mountain pine, and Norway spruce. Fruit bodies have been reported to grow in fairy rings.|$|E
5|$|The {{branches}} of the silver birch often have tangled masses of twigs known as witch's brooms growing among them, caused by the fungus Taphrina betulina. Old trees are often killed by the decay fungus Piptoporus betulinus and fallen branches rot rapidly on the forest floor. This tree commonly grows with the mycorrhizal fungus Amanita muscaria in a mutualistic relationship. This applies particularly to acidic or nutrient-poor soils. Other mycorrhizal associates include Leccinum scabrum and Cantharellus cibarius. It has been shown that, as well as <b>mycorrhiza,</b> the presence of microfauna in the soil assists {{the growth of the}} tree, as it enhances the mobilization of nutrients.|$|E
5|$|Although Calvatia craniiformis is {{generally}} considered a saprobic species, in controlled laboratory conditions, an ectomycorrhizae between the fungus and American sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua) was reported in a 1966 publication. A Chinese study showed that C.craniifromis would readily form <b>mycorrhiza</b> with poplar seedlings on unsterilized, but not on sterilized soil. Later research was unable to establish any similar association between C.craniiformis and Pinus ponderosa. Brain puffballs grow singly or in groups in fields and open woods, hardwood forests, and wet areas. In Asia, it has been recorded from China, India, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, and South Korea. The brain puffball has been recorded from Australia. In North America, its range includes the eastern and southern United States, and Mexico. In Michigan, {{it is one of}} the few macrofungi found regularly in black locust plantations. Fruit bodies serve as a food source for several species of flies.|$|E

Firstly, to become mportant space, is dried up (K 0) which consists of 3 different levels of treatment, field capacity (1000 ml), ½ field capacity (500 ml) and ¼ field capacity (250 ml) and the secondary space is Bradyrhizobium japonicum and <b>mycorrhizae</b> Tablets (BM), which consists of 4 different levels of treatment, namely Bradyrhizobium japonicum and without <b>mycorrhizae</b> tablet (BM 0), Bradyrhizobium japonicum and 1 <b>mycorrhizae</b> tablet (BM 1), Bradyrhizobium japonicum and 2 <b>mycorrhizae</b> tablet (BM 2), Bradyrhizobium japonicum and 3 <b>mycorrhizae</b> tablet (BM 3).

Both vesicular-arbuscular (VA) and ericoid <b>mycorrhizae</b> {{were present in}} epiphytes growing 1 - 3 m above the forest floor on dead and living tree trunks and on living tree ferns in montane wet forest sites. All eight angiosperm species were mycorrhizal, and 13 of 22 pteridophytes possessed VA <b>mycorrhizae.</b> The high frequency of <b>mycorrhizae</b> in epiphytic species suggests that propagules of mycorrhizal fungi routinely are dispersed to these microsites.

2500|$|Endomycorrhizas are {{variable}} {{and have been}} further classified as arbuscular, ericoid, arbutoid, monotropoid, and orchid <b>mycorrhizas.</b> [...] Arbuscular <b>mycorrhizas,</b> or AM (formerly known as vesicular-arbuscular <b>mycorrhizas,</b> or VAM), are <b>mycorrhizas</b> whose hyphae enter into the plant cells, producing structures that are either balloon-like (vesicles) or dichotomously branching invaginations (arbuscules). The fungal hyphae do not in fact penetrate the protoplast (i.e. {{the interior of the}} cell), but invaginate the cell membrane. The structure of the arbuscules greatly increases the contact surface area between the hypha and the cell cytoplasm to facilitate the transfer of nutrients between them.|$|R
5|$|In the soil, {{the roots}} {{encounter}} the hyphae of fungi. Many {{of these are}} known as <b>mycorrhiza</b> and form a mutualistic relationship with the tree roots. Some are specific to a single tree species, which will not flourish {{in the absence of}} its mycorrhizal associate. Others are generalists and associate with many species. The tree acquires minerals such as phosphorus from the fungus while it obtains the carbohydrate products of photosynthesis from the tree. The hyphae of the fungus can link different trees and a network is formed, transferring nutrients from one place to another. The fungus promotes growth of the roots and helps protect the trees against predators and pathogens. It can also limit damage done to a tree by pollution as the fungus accumulate heavy metals within its tissues. Fossil evidence shows that roots have been associated with mycorrhizal fungi since the early Paleozoic, four hundred million years ago, when the first vascular plants colonised dry land.|$|E
5|$|The fungus forms a tough mat of mycelia in the humus {{and upper}} soil of pine forests. This mycelial mat grows larger with old trees, and can cover {{an area of}} several square meters. These areas {{generally}} lack dwarf shrubs and promote the vigorous growth of mosses; reindeer lichens often occur {{in the center of}} large mats. The presence of the fungus changes the nature of the soil, resulting in a thinner humus layer, decreased groundwater penetration, decreased soil pH, and increases in the level of root respiration as well as the quantity of roots. The fungus also decreases the organic carbon and nitrogen concentrations. Soil with the mycelium becomes more podzolized than the surrounding soil. Similar to some other Hydnellum species, H.ferrugineum is sensitive to the increased nitrogen deposition resulting from clear-cutting, a forestry practice used in some areas of Europe. The fungus forms an unusual type of <b>mycorrhiza</b> with Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) in which the ectomycorrhiza appears normal at {{the leading edge of the}} mycelial mat, but leaves behind dead and atrophied roots at the trailing edge, showing saprophytic tendencies.|$|E
25|$|This type of <b>mycorrhiza</b> {{involves}} {{plants of}} the Ericaceae subfamily Arbutoideae. It is however different from ericoid <b>mycorrhiza</b> and resembles ectomycorrhiza, both functionally {{and in terms}} of the fungi involved. The difference to ectomycorrhiza is that some hyphae actually penetrate into the root cells, making this type of <b>mycorrhiza</b> an ectendomycorrhiza.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} {{parasitic}} root knot nematodes (Meloidogyne exigua) {{and how to}} decrease their pathogenic effect on coffee plants (Coffea arabica), by examining the behaviour of and the interactions between nematodes, coffee plant and arbuscular <b>mycorrhizae</b> (AM). The experiment was carried out at the seedling stage, with six (6) treatments (plants with M. exigua, plants with arbuscular <b>mycorrhizae,</b> plants with both organisms, and the same time, first <b>mycorrhizae</b> plants, then nematodes were inoculated and vice versa). After 5 months the measured variables were: dry biomass (roots and shoot), nematode knots caused by M. exigua in root, nematode juvenile (J 2) found in 100. 0 g of soil, and mycorrhizal percentage. Plant nutrients (P and N) contents were analysed. Significant {{differences were found in}} all the variables, but concentration N content in plants. Plants with <b>mycorrhizae</b> and plants with <b>mycorrhizae</b> and then inoculated with nematodes have the same behaviour. Control plants and plants with nematode and then inoculated with <b>mycorrhizae</b> behave similarly. It is thought that arbuscular <b>mycorrhizae</b> are formed before the nematode infestation, allowing coffee plants to regain the energy lost by the parasitic interaction. AM may help coffee plants with lignifications of the plant cell wall cuticle. As the cuticle thickens it is more difficult for nematodes to penetrate and enter into plant roots. Therefore, arbuscular <b>mycorrhizae</b> help coffee plants to uptake and transport nutrients, improving its nutritional status and stabilizing nematode attacks.
