40|$|Abstract: Coriolis <b>mass</b> <b>flowmeters</b> (CMF) are {{claimed to}} be not {{affected}} by {{the properties of the}} liquid such as heat conductivity, heat capacity and viscosity. They are direct <b>mass</b> <b>flowmeters</b> and form a real mean along the flow profile. However, there is some evidence from field applications that the devices, in particular with single straight pipe, suffer under the null drift. Therefore, the zero shift must be adjusted to the properties of liquid, installation site and operating conditions. The zero shift is caused by asymmetry of the oscillating system. A change in the asymmetry leads to the zero shift. This paper presents two methods to determine the zero shift: a sensor and a model based approach. The first uses additional acceleration sensors to measure the vibration of the straight pipe’s mounting. The motion of the mounting represents asymmetries in dissipation. The second method utilizes a model which includes the asymmetries as parameters. These can be detected by auxiliary exitation of the oscillating system...|$|R

40|$|A project history review, {{literature}} review, and vendor search {{were conducted}} to identify a flowmeter that would improve the accuracy of gaseous flow measurements in the White Sands Test Facility (WSTF) Calibration Laboratory and the Hydrogen High Flow Facility. Both facilities currently use sonic flow nozzles to measure flowrates. The flow nozzle pressure drops combined with corresponding pressure and temperature measurements have been estimated to produce uncertainties in flowrate measurements of 2 to 5 percent. This study investigated the state of flowmeter technology to make recommendations that would reduce those uncertainties. Most flowmeters measure velocity and volume, therefore mass flow measurement must be calculated based on additional pressures and temperature measurement which contribute to the error. The two exceptions are thermal dispersion meters and Coriolis <b>mass</b> <b>flowmeters.</b> The thermal dispersion meters are accurate to 1 to 5 percent. The Coriolis meters are significantly more accurate, at least for liquids.

40|$|To {{combat the}} growing {{emissions}} of CO 2 from industrial processes, Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) and Carbon Capture and Utilization technologies (CCU) {{have been accepted}} worldwide to address these pressing concerns. So as to efficiently manage material and financial losses across the entire stream, accurate accounting and monitoring through fiscal metering of CO 2 in CCS transportation pipelines are core and required features for the CCS technologies. Moreover, these technical requirements {{are part of the}} legal compliance schemes and guidelines from various regulatory bodies. The CO 2 transportation pipelines will likely have multiple inputs from different capture plants, each with varying composition of CO 2 and thus introducing impurities into the CO 2 stream. The presence of other ordinary or hydrocarbon gases in the CO 2 gas stream could affect the functionality of metering instruments by introducing additional errors, particularly in the case of volumetric flowmeters. In this study, volumetric and direct mass measurement methods for the flow measurement of CO 2 mixtures using two totally different metering principles are experimentally evaluated. An Averaging Pitot Tube with Flow Conditioning Wing (APT-FCW) and Coriolis <b>mass</b> <b>flowmeters</b> (CMF) are used to assess the flow metering of CO 2 in a binary gaseous mixture. Different gases (nitrogen, air, oxygen, argon and propane) are diluted as contaminants into the pure CO 2 gas flow for various mass fractions to produce an adulterated mixture of the CO 2 gas. Comparative analysis of the measurement results under these flow conditions relative to that of pure CO 2 gas show that the measurement error of the APT-FCW sensor increases with the mass fraction of the diluent component, and gases with density closer to that of CO 2 have a much lesser effect on the performance of the APT-FCW flow sensor for smaller mass fractions. The CMF proved to be very reliable in the gas combination processes and as a reference meter for the APT-FCW sensor. Further analytical observations are discussed in detail...|$|R

The flowmeters were designed and the performance assessed for liquid, supercritical and superfluid helium down to 1. 8 K and with pressures up to 0. 3 MPa. A testing regime and equipment to enable the performance of a range of developed flowmeters to be validated at working cryogenic temperatures and pressures is described in the thesis. In particular a novel cryogenic flow test facility with 1. 5 % accuracy as well as an irradiation test station designed, constructed and used as part of the evaluation work are described in the thesis. The final validation with metrological certification down to 0. 5 % accuracy was performed in collaboration with the Colonnetti metrological laboratory in Italy. Devices based on the thermal exchange and transport properties of the fluid were developed and proven to be reliable and inexpensive but with accuracy poorer than 10 %. As part of this work a new empirical heat transfer correlation for supercritical helium in the piping geometry and operating conditions of the LHC was established. Industrially available Coriolis meters which had not been employed before at such low temperatures were extensively investigated. It was found that with some minor modifications in the electronics (drive system) and in the elasticity modulus (Young’s modulus) value for the flow tubes material at low temperature, accuracy down to 0. 5 % could be achieved. Additional features in the mechanical and electrical design were also introduced to improve robustness and reliability at cryogenic temperatures. They mainly consisted in purging the meters secondary containment with helium to avoid gas freezing at low temperatures and increasing the internal gauge wire to improve its fatigue strength. The elasticity modulus of 316 L stainless steel below 20 K was characterised and compared to available literature data. The successful Coriolis flowmeters were validated to meter the cryogenic power distribution in the 27 -km long superfluid helium system of the future collider and are now extensively and successfully used in superconducting devices test facilities at CERN and in companion laboratories...|$|R
