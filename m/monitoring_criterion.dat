40|$|Event-related {{potentials}} {{were used}} to investigate {{if there is a}} lexical bias effect in comprehension monitoring. The lexical bias effect in language production (the tendency of phonological errors to result in existing words rather than nonwords) has been attributed to an internal self-monitoring system, which uses the comprehension system, and which employs lexical status as a <b>monitoring</b> <b>criterion.</b> It has been suggested that we monitor language comprehension too, and that the P 600 reflects comprehension monitoring processes. If both production and comprehension monitoring rely on the comprehension system it is plausible that both processes are very similar. Hence the lexical bias effect is expected in comprehension monitoring. We presented high-cloze sentences that could contain a correct word, a lexical error, or a nonlexical error. There was a larger N 400 in the lexical error and the nonlexical error conditions compared with the correct word condition. Importantly, the P 600 was the largest in the nonlexical error condition, intermediate in the lexical error condition, and the smallest in the correct condition. Apparently, the comprehension monitor is sensitive to lexicality, suggesting that production and comprehension monitoring use similar criteria for error detection...|$|E

In recent years，transmission lines icing {{leads to}} failure and accidents，such as large area ice flashover, {{fittings}} damaged, line dancing, pole (tower) failure, lines breakage even large-scale power outage, causing {{serious threat to}} grid. Nowadays, icing monitoring system mainly relies on detecting the meteorological parameters and the changes of dynamic characteristics for early warning, but the methodologies need additional equipment for data collection. In order to ensure the security and reliability of the grid, a safe, effective and economical methodology of monitoring transmission lines icing has great significance. The project proposed a Transmission Line Icing monitoring principle and algorithm, the method based only on the voltage and current from both ends of transmission lines can be generated dynamically <b>monitoring</b> <b>criterion</b> line icing. According to the criterion maximum, line icing center area, extent and severity can be recognized.

40|$|Fault Detection on {{transmission}} lines forms {{an important part}} of monitoring the health of the power plant and is an indicator of when potential faults can lead to catastrophic failure of equipment. This research analyses the early detection of generator, transmission line faults and also researches methods of fault detection via the application of Artificial Neural Network techniques. The monitoring of the generator voltages and currents, of transmission line performance parameters forms an important <b>monitoring</b> <b>criterion</b> of large power systems. Failures lead to system down time, damage to equipment and it presents a high risk to the integrity of the power system, and affects the operability and reliability of the network. This dissertation therefore deals with fault detection on the Eskom {{transmission lines}} from a simulation perspective. Electrical faults have always been a constant source of conflict between transmission lines and power consumers. This dissertation presents the application faults detection on the transmission lines using Artificial Neural Networks. The ANN is used to model and to predict the occurrence of a transmission line fault, and classifies faults according to its transient characteristics. Results show that the ANN can be used to accurately identify and to classify faults, given accurate problem set-up and training.

The pH <b>monitoring</b> <b>criteria</b> were {{selected on the basis}} of a preliminary study comparing statistically measurements of 32 variables recorded in 15 patients who all had clinical, radiological and endoscopic evidence of GER and in 8 asymptomatic controls. Although patients with symptomatic GER differed significantly from the asymptomatic ones for 27 variables examined, 6 variables emerged as having the highest value for discrimination (overlap score 0 - 1). Among these, the Euler-Byrne index (number of reflux pH less than 4 + 4 times the number of reflux episodes of more than 5 min), the percentage of total reflux time and the number of reflux episodes 1 h post-cibal scored 0 (no overlap). GER was considered to be present when at least five of these six parameters were abnormal.

40|$|Introduction Transcranial motor evoked {{potentials}} {{are routinely}} used at The Children’s Hospital at Westmead {{to monitor the}} spinal cord in spinal surgery. This study is a prospective review of all spinal cord monitoring procedures from 1999 to 2004 in patients undergoing elective spinal deformity correction surgery at The Children’s Hospital at Westmead and Westmead Hospital. Spinal cord monitoring with Somatosensory Evoked Potentials (SSEP) and MEP has been widely used in combination during spinal surgery with good sensitivity and specificity. The use of CMAP as the only modality has not been widely used and its efficacy has not been fully elucidated. Using MEP and CMAP only may increase the sensitivity of spinal cord monitoring compared with combined SSEP and MEP monitoring. Methods The intra-operative monitoring outcomes were compared with patient’s post-operative clinical outcomes. The sensitivity and specificity were calculated and determined for our monitoring protocol. Results Transcranial MEPs were measured in 146 patients in 175 procedures. In 2 patients (2 procedures) {{we were unable to}} record any CMAPS. There were 15 intra-operative monitoring changes (8. 7 %). There were no new post-operative neurological deficits. Our results compare favourably to the literature with respect to the false-negative rate or new neurological events. Discussion Using our anaesthetic protocol and spinal <b>monitoring</b> <b>criteria,</b> we were able to successfully monitor patients undergoing elective spinal deformity correction surgery for a variety of diagnoses. The <b>monitoring</b> <b>criteria</b> are sufficiently strict to achieve a sensitivity of 1. 0 (95 %CI = 0. 66 – 1. 00) and a specificity of 0. 97 (95 %CI = 0. 83 – 0. 99).

To determine intraoperative response amplitude criteria for transcranial electrical motor-evoked potential monitoring that warn of neurologic damage, {{and to determine}} the additional value of monitoring six instead of two muscle sites. Summary of Background Data. Transcranial electrical motor-evoked potential monitoring provides immediate and reliable information about {{the integrity of the}} motor pathways during spine surgery. Although this monitoring technique is more frequently used, criteria for interpretation of the amplitude responses have not been defined. Methods. The intraoperative monitoring outcomes were compared with the patient's clinical outcomes. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were determined for four different <b>monitoring</b> <b>criteria.</b> Results. Transcranial electrical motor-evoked potential monitoring was possible 142 of 145 patients undergoing corrective surgery. In this study, 16 patients had a neurologic event, and 11 patients showed recovery of response amplitude after a second surgical maneuver, whereas the remaining 5 patients had permanent partial neurologic damage. The criterion {{that at least one of}} six recordings must show an amplitude decrease of more than 80 % was sufficiently strict to achieve a sensitivity of 1. 0 and a specificity of 0. 91. Less strict criteria, including recording at two instead of six sites, resulted in lower sensitivity, with the lower bound of the 95 % confidence interval at 0. 62. Conclusions. Transcranial electrical motor-evoked potential monitoring allowed successful intraoperative <b>monitoring.</b> The <b>criterion</b> of one recording showing a response amplitude decrease of more than 80 % during a surgical action can be considered a valuable warning criterion for neurologic damage.
