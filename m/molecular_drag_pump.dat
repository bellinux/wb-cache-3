50|$|Most turbopumps have a Holweck pump (or <b>molecular</b> <b>drag</b> <b>pump)</b> {{as their}} last stage to {{increase}} the maximum backing pressure (exhaust pressure) to about 1-10 mbar. Theoretically, a centrifugal pump, a side channel pump, or a regenerative pump {{could be used to}} back to atmospheric pressure directly, but currently there is no commercially available turbopump that exhausts directly to atmosphere. In most cases, the exhaust is connected to a mechanical backing pump (usually called roughing pump) that produces a pressure low enough for the turbomolecular pump to work efficiently. Typically, this backing pressure is below 0.1 mbar and commonly about 0.01 mbar. The backing pressure is rarely below 10−3 mbar (mean free path ≈ 70 mm) because the flow resistance of the vacuum pipe between the turbopump and the roughing pump becomes significant.|$|E

40|$|Normetex pumps used world-wide for tritium {{service are}} no longer available. DOE and other {{researchers}} worldwide have spent significant funds characterizing this pump. Identification of alternate pumps is required for performance and compatibility with tritium gas. Many of the pumps {{that could be used}} to meet the functional performance requirements (e. g. pressure and flow conditions) of the Normetex pump have features that include the use of polymers or oils and greases that are not directly compatible with tritium service. This study assembles a test system to determine the flow characteristics for candidate alternate pumps. These tests are critical to the movement of tritium through the SHINE Tritium Purification System (TPS). The purpose of the pump testing is two-fold: (1) obtain baseline vacuum pump characteristics for an alternate (i. e. ''Normetex replacement'') pump intended for use in tritium service; and (2) verify that low pressure hydrogen gas can be transported over distances up to 300 feet by the candidate pumps. Flow rates and nominal system pressures have been identified for the SHINE Mo- 99 production process Tritium Purification System (TPS). To minimize the line sizes for the transfer of low pressure tritium from the Neutron Driver Accelerator System (NDAS) to the primary processing systems in the TPS, a ''booster'' pump has been located near the accelerator in the design. A series of pump tests were performed at various configurations using hydrogen gas (no tritium) to ensure that this concept is practical and maintains adequate flow rates and required pressures. This report summarizes the results of the tests that have been performed using various pump configurations. The current design of the Tritium Purification System requires the ''booster'' pump to discharge to or to be backed by another vacuum pump. Since Normetex pumps {{are no longer}} manufactured, a commercially available Edwards scroll pump will be used to back the booster pump. In this case the ''booster pump'' is an Adixen <b>Molecular</b> <b>Drag</b> <b>Pump</b> (MDP 5011) and the backing pump is an Edwards (nXDS 15 iC) scroll pump. Various configurations of the two pumps and associated lengths of 3 / 4 inch tubing (0 feet to 300 feet) were used in combination with hydrogen and nitrogen flow rates ranging from 25 - 400 standard cubic centimeters per minute (sccm) to determine whether the proposed pump configuration meets the design criteria for SHINE. The results of this study indicate that even under the most severe conditions (300 feet of tubing and 400 sccm flow rate) the Adixen 5011 MDP can serve as a booster pump to transport gases from the accelerator (NDAS) to the TPS. The Target Gas Receiving System pump (Edwards nXDS 15 iC) located approximately 300 feet from the accelerator can effectively back the Adixen MDP. The <b>molecular</b> <b>drag</b> <b>pump</b> was able to maintain its full rotational speed even when the flow rate was 400 sccm hydrogen or nitrogen and 300 feet of tubing was installed between the drag pump and the Edwards scroll pump. In addition to maintaining adequate rotation, the pressure in the system was maintained below the target pressure of 30 torr for all flow rates, lengths of tubing, and process gases. This configuration is therefore adequate to meet the SHINE design requirements in terms of flow and pressure...|$|E

Recent advances in sensor technology {{have led to}} the development of very small mass spectrometer detectors as well as other analytical instruments such as scanning electron microscopes. However, the vacuum systems to support these sensors remain large, heavy, and power-hungry. To meet this need, a miniaturized vacuum system was developed based on a very small, rugged, and inexpensive-to-manufacture <b>molecular</b> <b>drag</b> <b>pump</b> (MDP). The MDP is enabled by a miniature, very-high-speed (200, 000 rpm), rugged, low-power, brushless DC motor optimized for wide temperature operation and long life. The key advantages of the pump are reduced cost and improved ruggedness compared to other mechanical hig-hvacuum pumps. The machining of the rotor and stators is very simple compared to that necessary to fabricate rotor and stator blades for other pump designs. Also, the symmetry of the rotor is such that dynamic balancing of the rotor will likely not be necessary. Finally, the number of parts in the unit is cut by nearly a factor of three over competing designs. The new pump forms the heart of a complete vacuum system optimized to support analytical instruments in terrestrial applications and on spacecraft and planetary landers. The MDP achieves high vacuum coupled to a ruggedized diaphragm rough pump. Instead of the relatively complicated rotor and stator blades used in turbomolecular pumps, the rotor in the MDP consists of a simple, smooth cylinder of aluminum. This will turn at approximately 200, 000 rpm inside an outer stator housing. The pump stator comprises a cylindrical aluminum housing with one or more specially designed grooves that serve as flow channels. To minimize the length of the pump, the gas is forced down the flow channels of the outer stator to the base of the pump. The gas is then turned and pulled toward the top through a second set of channels cut into an inner stator housing that surrounds the motor. The compressed gas then flows down channels in the motor housing to the exhaust port of the pump. The exhaust port of the pump is connected to a commercially available diaphragm or scroll pump...|$|E

The machining of the rotor and stators is very simple compared to that necessary to fabricate TMP (turbo molecular pump) rotor and stator blades. Also, the symmetry of the rotor is such that dynamic balancing of the rotor is greatly simplified. Finally, because of the simplified design, the number of parts in the unit is cut by nearly a factor of three.

An innovative answer to the problem is to employ an electrohydrodynamic (EHD) pumping mechanism to remove heat from precise locations in a strictly controlled fashion. This can potentially be achieved by micro-cooling loops with micro-EHD pumps. Such pumps are easily manufactured using conventional microfabrication batch technologies. The present work investigates ion <b>drag</b> <b>pumping</b> for applications in reliable and cost effective EHD micropumps for spot cooling. The study examines the development, fabrication, and operation of micropumps under static and dynamic conditions. An optimization study is performed using the experimental data from the micropump prototype tests, and a numerical model is built using finite element methods. Many factors were involved in the optimization of the micropump design. A thorough analysis was performed of the major performance-controlling variables: electrode and inter-electrode pair spacing, electrode thickness and shape, and flow channel height. Electrode spacing was varied from 10 µm to 200 µm and channel heights from 50 µm to 500 µm. Also, degradation of the electrodes under the influence of an intense electric field was addressed.

A test facility was built for the measurement and evaluation of friction in a superconducting magnetic bearing {{as a function of}} operating temperature and pressure in the vacuum vessel. The bearing consists of a commercial disk shaped magnet levitated above single grain, melt-textured YBCO high-temperature superconductor material. The superconductor was conduction cooled by an integrated AEG tactical cryocooler. The temperature could be varied from 50 K to 80 K. The pressure in the vacuum chamber was varied from 1 bar to 10 (exp - 5) mbar. At the lowest pressure setting, the drag torque shows a linear frequency dependence over the entire range investigated (0 less than f less than 40 Hz). Magnetic friction, the frequency independent contribution, is very low. The frequency dependent drag torque is generated by molecular friction from molecule-surface collisions and by eddy currents. Given the specific geometry of the set-up and gas pressure, the <b>molecular</b> <b>drag</b> torque can be estimated.

Successful control leads to reduction of <b>drag</b> and <b>pumping</b> power within the former approach, whereas the latter leads to an increase of the mass flow rate and pumping power. In practical applications, however, money and time define the flow control challenge: a compromise between the energy expenditure (money) and the corresponding convenience (flow rate) achieved with that amount of energy has to be reached so as to accomplish a goal which in general depends on the specific application. Based on this idea, we derive two dimensionless parameters which quantify the total energy consumption and the required time (convenience) for transporting a given volume of fluid through a given duct. Performances of existing drag reduction strategies as well as the influence of wall roughness are re-evaluated within the present framework; how to achieve the (application-dependent) optimum balance between energy consumption and convenience is addressed. It is also shown that these considerations can be extended to external flows...|$|R
40|$|The {{impact of}} photons upon a {{spacecraft}} introduces small forces and moments. The magnitude {{and direction of}} the forces depend on the material properties of the spacecraft components being illuminated. Which components are being lit depends on the orientation of the craft with respect to the Sun as well as the gimbal angles for any significant moving external parts (solar arrays, typically). Some components may shield others from the Sun. To determine solar pressure in the presence overlapping components, a 3 D model can be used to determine which components are illuminated. A view (image) of the model as seen from the Sun shows the only contributors to solar pressure. This image can be decomposed into pixels, each of which can be treated as a non-overlapping flat plate as far as solar pressure calculations are concerned. The sums of the pressures and moments on these plates approximate the solar pressure and moments on the entire vehicle. The image rasterization technique {{can also be used to}} compute other spacecraft attributes that are dependent on attitude and geometry, including solar array power generation capability and free <b>molecular</b> flow <b>drag...</b>|$|R
40|$|It is {{observed}} both {{in nature and}} in technological processes that filaments with anisotropic molecular-scale structure are less susceptible to breakup due to capillary instability than homogeneous, isotropic fluids in similar filament flows. Here we provide rigorous evidence that the strong coupling of microstructure to the hydrodynamics of cylindrical axisymmetric free surface filaments indeed fundamentally alters the linearized stability of cylindrical jets. We extend Rayleigh's classical inviscid analysis of cylindrical jets to the 3 -dimensional (3 -D), macroscopic flow-orientation equations derived from the Doi kinetic theory for liquid crystalline polymers (LCPs). These equations assume rigid rod-like molecules and incorporate LCP effects of <b>molecular</b> relaxation, anisotropic <b>drag,</b> polymer kinetic energy, LCP density, and an intermolecular potential which couple orientation dynamics to standard free surface fluid equations. Depending on the LCP density, there are between o [...] ...|$|R
40|$|The torque {{associated}} with overcoming the losses on a rotating disc {{is of particular}} importance to the designers of gas turbine engines. Not only does this represent a reduction in useful work, but it also gives rise to unwanted heating of metal surfaces and the adjacent fluid. This paper presents a numerical study {{on the effect of}} rotor-mounted bolts on the moment coefficient and velocity distributions within a rotor-stator cavity under conditions representative of modern gas turbine engine design. Steady-state, 2 D and 3 D, CFD simulations are obtained using the FLUENT commercial code with a standard k- turbulence model. The model is validated against experimental data and then used to investigate the effects of varying the number of bolts and also a continuous ring. Two test cases are investigated: one corresponds to where the flow structure is dominated by the superimposed flow (T = 0. 35); the other, where rotation is expected to govern the flow structure (T = 0. 35). It is possible to separate out the contributions due to skin friction and pressure related (form <b>drag</b> and <b>pumping</b> loss) in the CFD results. This shows that the contribution of skin friction to the overall moment coefficient reduces as the number of bolts increases and the pressure related losses increase. There also appears to be a point where increasing the number of bolts does not bring about an increase in the overall moment coefficient. It is also interesting to report that the moment coefficient {{associated with}} a continuous ring is similar to that for a plain disc...|$|R
30|$|The model {{solves the}} {{primitive}} equations. It includes gravity wave (GW) parameterisation, parameterised ion <b>drag,</b> <b>molecular</b> heat conduction, Joule heating {{in the upper}} atmosphere and a full radiation scheme to allow self-consistent tidal forcing. The extreme ultraviolet (EUV) heating in the thermosphere is included. Solar fluxes and absorption coefficients for each EUV spectral interval and each constituent were calculated using the model proposed by Richards et al. (1994). The constant value of 0.366 for the EUV heating efficiency {{has been used as}} recommended by Roble (1995). To integrate the prognostic equations, the Marchuk-Strang approach was used, which includes splitting of the initial Cauchy problem into the set of simpler problems according to the considered physical processes (Marchuk 1967; Strang 1968). Finally, to solve the equations obtained in the result of splitting the Cauchy problems, we use the Matsuno (1966) time-integration scheme with a time step-size 100 s.|$|R
40|$|An {{algorithm}} {{has been}} developed {{to take advantage of}} the graphics processing hardware in modern computers to efficiently compute high-fidelity solar pressure forces and torques on spacecraft, taking into account the possibility of self-shading due to the articulation of spacecraft components such as solar arrays. The process is easily extended to compute other results that depend on three-dimensional attitude analysis, such as solar array power generation or free <b>molecular</b> flow <b>drag.</b> The impact of photons upon a spacecraft introduces small forces and moments. The magnitude and direction of the forces depend on the material properties of the spacecraft components being illuminated. The parts of the components being lit depends on the orientation of the craft with respect to the Sun, as well as the gimbal angles for any significant moving external parts (solar arrays, typically). Some components may shield others from the Sun. The purpose of this innovation is to enable high-fidelity computation of solar pressure and power generation effects of illuminated portions of spacecraft, taking self-shading from spacecraft attitude and movable components into account. The key idea in this innovation is to compute results dependent upon complicated geometry by using an image to break the problem into thousands or millions of sub-problems with simple geometry, and then the results from the simpler problems are combined to give high-fidelity results for the full geometry. This process is performed by constructing a 3 D model of a spacecraft using an appropriate computer language (OpenGL), and running that model on a modern computer's 3 D accelerated video processor. This quickly and accurately generates a view of the model (as shown on a computer screen) that takes rotation and articulation of spacecraft components into account. When this view is interpreted as the spacecraft as seen by the Sun, then only the portions of the craft visible in the view are illuminated. The view as shown on the computer screen is composed of up to millions of pixels. Each of those pixels is associated with a small illuminated area of the spacecraft. For each pixel, it is possible to compute its position, angle (surface normal) from the view direction, and the spacecraft material (and therefore, optical coefficients) associated with that area. With this information, the area associated with each pixel can be modeled as a simple flat plate for calculating solar pressure. The vector sum of these individual flat plate models is a high-fidelity approximation of the solar pressure forces and torques on the whole vehicle. In addition to using optical coefficients associated with each spacecraft material to calculate solar pressure, a power generation coefficient is added for computing solar array power generation from the sum of the illuminated areas. Similarly, other area-based calculations, such as free <b>molecular</b> flow <b>drag,</b> are also enabled. Because the model rendering is separated from other calculations, it is relatively easy to add a new model to explore a new vehicle or mission configuration. Adding a new model is performed by adding OpenGL code, but a future version might read a mesh file exported from a computer-aided design (CAD) system to enable very rapid turnaround for new design...|$|R

Currently, industries use pumps to maintain the pressure in the pipeline for transportation. In order to solve this problem, researchers were developing drag reduction technique using different types of materials to get an alternative for <b>pumps.</b> <b>Drag</b> reduction is a technique where a minute of amountof drag reduction additives, usually parts per million (ppm), is added into liquid which reduce the frictional drag greatly. However, researches are mostly done in macroscale where {{there will be a}} waste in reagent. In this experimental study, investigation the effect of variable concentration of nanopowders with different size of microchannels and different flow rate on drag reduction is carried out. The nanopowder (Bismuth (III) oxide, Iron (II,III) oxide, Silica and Titanium (IV) oxide) is dissolved in DI water and the fluid is pumped into microchannels with the width and depth of 50 μm, 100 μm and 200 μm respectively which is connected to pressure transmitter through syringe pump.
