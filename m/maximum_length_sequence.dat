40|$|An {{attempt is}} made to develop {{mathematical}} formulas to {{provide the basis for}} the design of pseudorandom signals intended for applications requiring accurate knowledge of the statistics of the signals. The analysis approach involves calculating the first five central moments of the weight distribution of subsequences of hybrid-sum sequences. The hybrid-sum sequence is formed from the modulo-two sum of k <b>maximum</b> <b>length</b> <b>sequences</b> and is an extension of the sum sequences formed from two <b>maximum</b> <b>length</b> <b>sequences</b> that Gilson (1966) evaluated. The weight distribution of the subsequences serves as an approximation to the filtering process. The basic reason for the analysis of hybrid-sum sequences is to establish a large group of sequences with good statistical properties. It is shown that this can be accomplished much more efficiently using the hybrid-sum approach rather than forming the group strictly from <b>maximum</b> <b>length</b> <b>sequences...</b>|$|R

50|$|As {{early as}} 1982 it was {{discovered}} that <b>maximum</b> <b>length</b> <b>sequences</b> based on bent functions have cross-correlation and autocorrelation properties rivalling those of the Gold codes and Kasami codes for use in CDMA.

50|$|<b>Maximum</b> <b>length</b> <b>sequence</b> based diffusors {{are made}} of strips of {{material}} with two different depths. The placement of these strips follows an MLS. The width of the strips is smaller {{than or equal to}} half the wavelength of the frequency where the maximum scattering effect is desired. Ideally, small vertical walls are placed between lower strips, improving the scattering effect in the case of tangential sound incidence. The bandwidth of these devices is rather limited; at one octave above the design frequency, diffusor efficacy drops to that of a flat surface.|$|E
5000|$|Smaart {{is based}} on {{real-time}} fast Fourier transform (FFT) analysis, including dual-FFT audio signal comparison, called [...] "transfer function", and single-FFT spectrum analyzer. It includes <b>maximum</b> <b>length</b> <b>sequence</b> (MLS) analysis as a choice for impulse response, for the measurement of room acoustics. The FFT implementation of Smaart is a multi-time window (MTW) solution in which the FFT, rather than being a fixed length, is made increasingly shorter as the frequency increases. This feature allows the software to 'ignore' later signal reflections from walls and other surfaces, increasing in coherence as the audio frequency increases.|$|E
50|$|The {{process of}} {{generating}} a Kasami sequence is initiated by generating a <b>maximum</b> <b>length</b> <b>sequence</b> a(n), where n=1..2N-1. Maximum length sequences are periodic sequences with {{a period of}} exactly 2N-1. Next, a secondary sequence {{is derived from the}} initial sequence via cyclic decimation sampling as b(n) = a(q*n), where q = 2N/2+1. Modified sequences are then formed by adding a(n) and cyclically time shifted versions of b(n) using modulo-two arithmetic, which is also termed the exclusive or (xor) operation. Computing modified sequences from all 2N/2 unique time shifts of b(n) forms the Kasami set of code sequences.|$|E

The set of the 2n &minus; 1 exclusive-ors of the two sequences in their various phases (i.e. translated into all relative positions) is a set of Gold codes. The highest absolute cross-correlation in this set of codes is 2(n+2)/2 + 1 for even n and 2(n+1)/2 + 1 for odd n.|$|E
50|$|Electro-acoustic {{devices such}} as {{loudspeakers}} and microphones present special problems for analysis, as they must receive or transmit signals through air. In these cases, the DUT in the model shown above must be replaced with the complete electro-mechanical system, e.g., a power amplifier to drive a loudspeaker, a loudspeaker, a measurement microphone and microphone pre-amplifier. The actual device under test can be measured only when the other devices in this system are fully characterized, so that the contributions from these devices may be subtracted from the response. Many modern audio analyzers contain measurement sequences that automate this procedure, and the focus of recent developments has been on quasi-anechoic measurements. These techniques allow loudspeakers to be characterised in a non-ideal (noisy) environment, {{without the need for}} an anechoic chamber, which makes them ideally suited for use in high volume production line manufacturing. Most quasi-anechoic measurements are based around an impulse response created from a sine wave whose frequency is swept on a logarithmic scale, with a window function applied to remove any acoustic reflections. The log swept sine method increases signal-to-noise ratio and also allows measurement of individual distortion harmonics up to the Nyquist frequency, something which previously impossible with older analysis techniques such as MLS (<b>Maximum</b> <b>Length</b> <b>Sequence).</b>|$|E
50|$|Loudspeakers {{differ from}} most other items of audio {{equipment}} in suffering from 'colouration'. This {{refers to the}} tendency of {{various parts of the}} speaker: the cone, its surround, the cabinet, the enclosed space, to carry on moving when the signal ceases. All forms of resonance cause this, by storing energy, and resonances with high Q factor are especially audible. Much of the work that has gone into improving speakers {{in recent years has been}} about reducing colouration, and Fast Fourier Transform, or FFT, measuring equipment was introduced in order to measure the delayed output from speakers and display it as a time vs. frequency waterfall plot or spectrogram plot. Initially analysis was performed using impulse response testing, but this 'spike' suffers from having very low energy content if the stimulus is to remain within the peak ability of the speaker. Later equipment uses correlation on other stimulus such as a <b>Maximum</b> <b>length</b> <b>sequence</b> analyser or MLSSA. Using multiple sine wave tones as a stimulus signal and analyzing the resultant output, Spectral Contamination testing provides a measure of a loudspeakers 'self-noise' distortion component. This 'picket fence' type of signal can be optimized for any frequency range, and the results correlate exceptionally well with sound quality listening tests.|$|E

50|$|In {{order to}} {{maximize}} the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in a measured HRTF, {{it is important that}} the impulse being generated be of high volume. In practice, however, it can be difficult to generate impulses at high volumes and, if generated, they can be damaging to human ears, so it is more common for HRTFs to be directly calculated in the frequency domain using a frequency-swept sine wave or by using <b>maximum</b> <b>length</b> <b>sequences.</b> User fatigue is still a problem, however, highlighting the need for the ability to interpolate based on fewer measurements.|$|R

40|$|<b>Maximum</b> <b>length</b> <b>sequences</b> (MLS) {{have been}} used to improve the {{signal-to-noise}} ratio (SNR) of otoacoustic emissions [Thornton, J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 94, 132 – 136 (1993) ] and the auditory brainstem response [Thornton and Slaven, Br. J. Audiol. 27, 205 – 210 (1993) ]. By implication, a shorter recording time would be required to give equal signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). This study aimed to establish whether it is also possible to improve the SNR of the auditory-evoked potential termed the middle latency response (MLR) using <b>maximum</b> <b>length</b> <b>sequences</b> (MLS). Recordings of 180 s each were made using a conventional recording rate and MLS rates of 42, 89, and 185 clicks/s. Three different stimulus intensities were used in the range 30 to 70 dB nHL. The rate of 89 clicks/s was found to produce most improvement in SNR for both the Na–Pa region of the MLR and the Na–Pb region. This improvement in SNR using MLS implies that an MLS rate of 89 clicks/s would produce a fourfold reduction in recording time for equal SNR over conventional recording for the Pa–Nb region of the MLR at a stimulus intensity of 70 dB nHL. The latency of the Nb wave was found to reduce significantly using MLS. An MLR could not be recorded from every subject in this study, but more subjects had an identifiable response for MLS than for conventional recordings. Use of MLS to record the MLR appears to offer the potential for reduction in test time and better wave identification...|$|R
