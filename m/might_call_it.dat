25|$|The {{arrangement}} of Matt Dennis's Everything Happens To Me (June Christy, vocal) {{was not done}} under Kenton's aegis but with Christy's later to be husband Bob Cooper as the leader just after the second AFM recording ban. This {{is added to the}} CD and shows the continuity of Graettinger's writing and recorded works for Capitol; the chart had originally been done for the full Kenton instrumentation but was never recorded. The small 11 piece group (to include violin and cello) provides some real insight to the inner workings of Graettinger's writing. The aesture nature of his arrangement and use of pantonality (one <b>might</b> <b>call</b> <b>it</b> atonality in spots) makes one wonder how June Christy is able to pick off the 9th of the F minor chord {{at the top of the}} tune; there is basically no clue given by Graettinger as to what pitch is coming for the singer (the glue that holds this together is the Bb pedal point at the bottom). Interestingly, after first stating the entire tune there is a tutti ensemble section that gives way to the 'last 'A' of the form'. Also, his harmonic transitions between sections are key in their departure from the tune compared to the established harmony while June Christy sings.|$|E

[...] Ted Nugent said, [...] "If you don't know every Chuck Berry lick, you can't play rock guitar." [...] Bob Dylan called Berry [...] "the Shakespeare of rock 'n' roll". Springsteen tweeted, [...] "Chuck Berry was rock's greatest practitioner, guitarist, and the greatest pure rock 'n' roll writer who ever lived." ...|$|E

Eliot claimed: [...] "Among [...] {{small number of}} music-hall performers, whose names are familiar to {{what is called the}} lower class, Marie Lloyd had far the strongest hold on popular affection." [...] Her biographer and friend MacQueen-Pope thought that Lloyd was [...] "going downhill of her own volition. The complaint was incurable, some <b>might</b> <b>call</b> <b>it</b> heartbreak, perhaps a less sentimental diagnosis is disillusionment." [...] The impersonator Charles Austin paid tribute by saying [...] "I have lost an old pal, and the public has lost its principal stage favourite, one who can never be replaced." ...|$|E

Feminist writer Cicely Hamilton wrote of Macmillan that [...] "she was {{the right kind of}} lawyer, one who held that Law should be synonymous with Justice... Her chief aim in life—one <b>might</b> <b>call</b> <b>it</b> her passion—was to give every woman of every class and nation the {{essential}} protection of justice. She was, herself, a great and very just human being... She could not budge an inch on matters of principle but she never lost her temper and never bore a grudge in defeat." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Sweet Life" [...] was raved {{by music}} critics. John Calvert of The Quietus {{described}} the song as [...] "really big. Like R. Kelly's [...] "I Believe I Can Fly" [...] big. Like Superman eating a super hotdog while fighting King Kong while...ok {{you get the}} picture. If you were looking around for a high concept pitch-style descriptor, with its synth brass and Philly soul strings you <b>might</b> <b>call</b> <b>it</b> 'Stevie Wonder meets N.E.R.D in space'. But then {{that would be too}} simplistic a definition for the multifaceted, resolutely accomplished 'Sweet Thing'." [...] Pitchforks Larry Fitzmaurice labeled it a [...] "Best New Track" [...] and noted that [...] "this was a week where Frank Ocean bravely invited us to learn more about his personal story; 'Sweet Life' is another reminder of how well he can structure a narrative in the musical realm." [...] The Telegraphs Neil McCormick noted that Ocean took the R genre and pushed it out into strange new places, with tracks like the [...] "blissful, jazzy jigsaw of 'Sweet Life', which seems to assemble itself from disconnected elements as it goes along." [...] AllMusic's Andy Kellman mused that the track served as one of the album's lighter moments, and wrote that [...] "the bright 'Sweet Life' and the relatively exuberant 'Monks,' both of which would be standouts on any N.E.R.D. album, offer more than bright coating, dealing in surrealism and sharp observations that are equally penetrating." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} {{received}} over 2,500,000 YouTube views {{in less than}} two days. Billboard writer Andrew Hampp said its production was a [...] "historic milestone in the realm of YouTube creators". Cowan of Canadian Business said, [...] "Cynics will view this as a decidedly stodgy brand trying to make itself hip by hanging out with cool kids. But a less-jaded eye <b>might</b> <b>call</b> <b>it</b> something else—arts patronage for the 21st century". Writing for music website Idolator, Bradley Stern called the video a [...] "squeaky-clean visual," [...] and praised its bright and colorful imagery, while Daily Express writer Stefan Kyriazis called it [...] "red hot". Mike Pell of MTV UK wrote that the clip continued the bubbly, bright themes of Trainor's [...] "All About That Bass" [...] video, and that the singer's sequinned kitty top resembled one [...] Katy Perry wore for the 2014 MTV Europe Music Awards. Yahoo! writer Lyndsey Parker remarked about Trainor's fashion in the video; and said it [...] "seems to be an unofficial campaign to land her own M.A.C. Viva Glam endorsement deal". Fuse's Hilary Hughes wrote that the video was a bold and sassy sentiment, and that its style shift from [...] "All About That Bass" [...] "definitely made a statement". Hughes described the video's dance routine as [...] "fierce"; she called it [...] "a super-meta technicolor dance party". Mashable's Brian Anthony Hernandez wrote, [...] "The visuals are what you would expect from a bouncy pop song: young dancers, colorful backgrounds, quirky outfits and exaggerated expressions".|$|E
