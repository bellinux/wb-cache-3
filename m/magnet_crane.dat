40|$|<b>Magnet</b> <b>Crane</b> {{represent}} an appliance used to remove metal type goods {{from one place}} to other place. <b>Magnet</b> <b>Crane</b> made to be able to quickly process operate for evacuation of metal type goods, because in evacuation of goods do not need cordage process and release at goods manually. To reach the target hence have to be supported by other aspect that is by controlling its speed with existence of heavy change of removed goods, so that process operation evacuation of goods can stabilize. This system of apparatus detections of speed use network of optocoupler and of detections heavy use potensiometer combination with spiral spring, method used to control motor of DC is to use PWM (Pulse With Modulation) and microcontroller as controller of prototype. Input of FLC (Fuzzy Logic Controller) is goods weight and speed, the next processed to get value of duty PWM signal cycle as reference generating of PWM. With method of FLC this speed of motor will be controlled fulfill to set wanted speed point. From result of examination conducted for burden 1 Kg, <b>magnet</b> <b>crane</b> can work as according to scheme. To make a move to go up happened mistake equal to 3. 33...|$|E
40|$|The diploma thesis {{deals with}} crab frame of bridge <b>magnet</b> <b>crane</b> with lifting {{capacity}} 15 t used in steel mill for handling billets. Thesis contains strength analysis and fatigue strength check of crab frame based on ČSN EN 13001. Strength analyses {{are made by}} using beam and shell models of finite element method.

40|$|The diploma thesis {{deals with}} {{some parts of}} bridge <b>magnet</b> <b>crane</b> with 15 tons of nominal lifting capacity. This crane is {{designed}} for operation in the steel mill for handling billets using magnets suspended on the traverse. This work is focused on design of hoisting and traverse mechanism of crane trolley, selection of individual components {{on the basis of}} relevant standards and calculations. Next part of this thesis is investigation magnet traverse in terms of its strength according to standard ČSN EN 13001...|$|E
5000|$|The second alien race to {{actually}} look alien, the Insectoids were insect-like humanoid cyborgs {{especially interested in}} [...] "energy orbs" [...] which included magnetic stickers so that <b>magnets</b> attached to <b>cranes</b> could lift them. Insectoids are unusual in that Lego had never before in Lego Space released two [...] "bad guy" [...] factions in a row. According to the LEGO Group, the Insectoids had crash-landed on an alien planet filled with enormous bugs, {{and in order to}} steal their giant egg orbs to refuel their spaceships and escape, they were forced to disguise themselves and their spaceships as bugs. After escaping the planet, the Insectoid went out into the galaxy to make life miserable for the other races with their mischievous and pest-like nature, while looking for more [...] "energy orbs" [...] to power their technology. This is usually considered to be the last Space subtheme in which the entire theme is [...] "good", [...] "bad", or [...] "civilian".|$|R
