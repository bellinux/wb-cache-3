This study has aimed {{to assess the impact}} of change in Mr due to moisture increase on pavement performance using the HDM- 4 and AASHTO 2008 ’s roughness prediction models. As a case study, the paper utilises seven selected flexible pavement road groups of Queensland, Australia that cover 50 % of the major road network. Both the results match closely when pavement strength data are accurate. The deterioration predictions are verified with actual after flood data and t-tests for two major roads in Logan City, and found consistent. The study has observed some interesting findings on change in degree of saturation, pavements flood resilience and life-cycle performances with flooding scenarios. It is believed that these results would be useful in obtaining accurate ΔIRI change at varying Mr values due to a flood to select appropriate post-flood rehabilitation. A road authority can use pavements flood-resistance and life-cycle performance results for deriving a maintenance strategy.

40|$|AbstractThis study {{introduced}} {{at first the}} background of numerous highway widening projects {{that have been developed}} in recent years in China. Using a large ground settlement simulator and a fiber Bragg grating (FBG) strain sensor network system, a large-scale model test, with a similarity ratio of 1 : 2, was performed to analyze the influence of differential settlement between new and old subgrades on pavement structure under loading condition. The result shows that excessive differential settlement can cause considerable tensile strain in the pavement structure of a widened road, for which a maximum value (S) of 6 cm is recommended. Under the repetitive load, the top layers of pavement structure are subjected to the alternate action of tensile and compressive strains, which would eventually lead to a fatigue failure of the pavement. However, application of geogrid to the splice between the new and the old roads can reduce differential settlement to a limited extent. The new subgrade of a widened road is vulnerable to the influence of dynamic load transferred from the above pavement structures. While for the old subgrade, due to its comparatively high stiffness, it can well spread the load on the pavement statically or dynamically. The test also shows that application of geogrid can effectively prevent or defer the failure of pavement structure. With geogrid, the <b>modulus</b> <b>of</b> <b>resilience</b> of the subgrade is increased and inhomogeneous deformation can be reduced; therefore, the stress/strain distribution in pavement structure under loading condition becomes uniform. The results obtained in this context are expected to provide a helpful reference for structural design and maintenance strategy for future highway widening projects...|$|E

40|$|With {{increased}} demand on sponges for cosmetic and biomedical purposes, natural sponge fishing grounds {{are no longer}} able to cope with the demand. With sufficient research and development, sponge aquaculture is likely to supply demand while allowing the preservation of natural sponge stocks. However, due to the array of different environmental conditions found amongst the habitats of different species, and differences amongst the species themselves, detailed research on the amenability to common culture methods, survival and growth rates, recovery processes, and the environmental requirements for any one species is required before commercial culture may be considered. Furthermore, due to the diverse morphological variation that occurs in sponges due to the environment, quantitative quality testing protocols must be established to experimentally determine the optimal environmental conditions required for production of quality bath sponges. In this study, survival (in situ and in vitro), growth rates (in situ), and recovery processes (in vitro) were measured for two potential sponge aquaculture candidates, Rhopaloeides odorabile Thompson et al (1987) and Coscinoderma n. sp. [Phylum Porifera: Order Dictyoceratida Minchin (1900) : Family Spongiidae Gray (1867) ], cultured at the Palm Islands, central Great Barrier Reef. Sponge survival was dependent on species, culture method, and time with the highest mortality occurring soon after excision of sponge material from the parent stock. R. odorabile had the greatest survival of the two species in vitro, and the lowest survival in situ. Growth rates of 85. 9 ± 23. 7 % and 115. 2 ± 23. 4 % per annum, for R. odorabile and Coscinoderma n. sp. respectively, were not significantly different over the 21 month experimental period. Both species demonstrated initial size dependent growth rates with smaller explants growing fastest through the first season (78 days). Explant recovery rates were rapid for both species with a protective layer of collagen forming over the surface within 24 hrs. This layer was later replaced by pinacoderm as the subsurface tissue was reorganised to recreate a functional surface including redevelopment of the aquiferous system. A quantitative testing protocol was developed to assess the quality of sponges using mechanical engineering techniques. Techniques quantified the directly measurable physical properties of sponges (density, fibre width, and fibre length) and the quality characteristics of firmness, compression modulus, compressive strength, tensile strength, elastic limit, elastic strain, modulus of elasticity, <b>modulus</b> <b>of</b> <b>resilience,</b> absorbency, and water retention efficiency. These were measured for R. odorabile and Coscinoderma n. sp. and three commercial species. There were significant differences between species for all quality parameters creating a unique profile for each species. R. odorabile was the firmest (37. 8 ± 4. 3 kPa), strongest (157. 4 ± 17. 3 kPa), and most rigid (838. 7 ± 53. 5 kPa) species tested, while Coscinoderma n. sp. was one of the softest sponges (7. 3 ± 1. 1 kPa) with the highest elastic energy (30. 5 ± 3. 5 kJ/m 3) and water retention efficiency (40. 1 ± 1. 4 %) of all species tested. These quality tests enable comparisons of quality between and within species with scientific rigour.

Furthermore the relationship between <b>modulus</b> <b>of</b> convexity, <b>modulus</b> <b>of</b> smoothness, and Gao&# 39;s constant is considered, meanwhile the exact value <b>of</b> Milman <b>modulus</b> has been obtained for some Banach space...|$|R
30|$|Using {{the least}} squares method, the dynamic <b>modulus</b> <b>of</b> {{elasticity}} and the <b>modulus</b> <b>of</b> dynamic viscosity were determined for each loading time. The {{results showed that}} the loading time has no influence on the <b>modulus</b> <b>of</b> dynamic viscosity. On the other hand, the dynamic <b>modulus</b> <b>of</b> elasticity decreases and tends towards zero. Good agreement between creep test data and dynamic <b>modulus</b> <b>of</b> elasticity was found using mathematical function in power. Suitably, the “power” function established between the elastic dynamic modulus and the loading duration can be used to extrapolate deformations values.|$|R
