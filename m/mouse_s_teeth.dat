Earlier studies showed that 13 S 100 genes are located as a cluster on human chromosome 1 q 21. Since a number of <b>mouse</b> <b>S</b> 100 genes, such as S 100 A 4 and S 100 A 6, have been localized to a syntenic region on mouse chromosome 3, we investigated if the S 100 gene cluster exists in mouse and is structurally conserved during evolution. First we identified the cDNA sequences of <b>mouse</b> <b>S</b> 100 A 1, S 100 A 3 and S 100 A 5. Then we isolated a 490 kb mouse YAC clone which gives a specific signal by FISH most likely on chromosome 3. Hybridization studies with different <b>mouse</b> <b>S</b> 100 cDNAs revealed that eight <b>mouse</b> <b>S</b> 100 genes are arranged in a clustered organization {{similar to that in}} human. The linkage relationships between the genes S 100 A 8 –S 100 A 9 and S 100 A 3 –S 100 A 4 –S 100 A 5 –S 100 A 6 were conserved during divergence of human and mouse about 70 million years ago. However, the separation of the <b>mouse</b> <b>S</b> 100 genes S 100 A 1 and S 100 A 13 in comparison to the human linkage group suggests rearrangement processes between human and mouse.

40|$|Abstract Background The human psoriasin (S 100 A 7) gene {{has been}} implicated in {{inflammation}} and tumor progression. Implementation of a mouse model would facilitate further investigation of its function, however little is known of the murine psoriasin gene. In this study we have cloned the cDNA and characterized {{the expression of the}} potential murine ortholog of human S 100 A 7 /psoriasin in skin inflammation and mammary tumorigenesis. Methods On the basis of chromosomal location, phylogenetic analysis, amino acid sequence similarity, conservation of a putative Jab 1 -binding motif, and similarities of the patterns of <b>mouse</b> <b>S</b> 100 A 7 /psoriasin gene expression (measured by RT-PCR and in-situ hybridization) with those of human S 100 A 7 /psoriasin, we propose that <b>mouse</b> <b>S</b> 100 A 7 /psoriasin is the murine ortholog of human psoriasin/S 100 A 7. Results Although <b>mouse</b> <b>S</b> 100 A 7 /psoriasin is poorly conserved relative to other S 100 family members, its pattern of expression parallels that of the human psoriasin gene. In murine skin S 100 A 7 /psoriasin was significantly upregulated in relation to inflammation. In murine mammary gland expression is also upregulated in mammary tumors, where it is localized to areas of squamous differentiation. This mirrors the context of expression in human tumor types where both squamous and glandular differentiation occur, including cervical and lung carcinomas. Additionally, <b>mouse</b> <b>S</b> 100 A 7 /psoriasin possesses a putative Jab 1 binding motif that mediates many downstream functions of the human S 100 A 7 gene. Conclusion These observations and results support the hypothesis that the <b>mouse</b> <b>S</b> 100 A 7 gene is structurally and functionally similar to human S 100 A 7 and may offer a relevant model system for studying its normal biological function and putative role in tumor progression. </p...|$|R

40|$|AbstractS 100 A 1, {{a member}} of the large EF-hand family of Ca 2 +-binding proteins, is mainly {{expressed}} in the mammalian heart. To assess the underlying mechanisms for cell- and tissue-specific expression we isolated and characterized the <b>mouse</b> <b>S</b> 100 A 1 gene. The gene displays a high degree of homology to the human and rat genes, especially in the exonic sequences. In its promoter region and the first intron, we identified regulatory elements characteristic for cardiac and slow skeletal muscle restricted genes. Transfection assays with luciferase constructs containing different parts of the S 100 A 1 gene demonstrated the active expression in primary mouse cardiomyocytes and that its 5 ′-upstream region containing a putative cardiac enhancer showed a greatly increased activity. Furthermore, we investigated the expression of the S 100 A 1 mRNA during embryonic mouse development, using in situ hybridization. S 100 A 1 transcripts were first detected in the primitive heart at embryonic day (E) 8, with equal levels in the atrium and ventricle.

The <b>mouse</b> <b>S</b> 100 A 3 gene was clustered with other S 100 family members on chromosome 3, and specifically expressed in dorsal skin containing hair follicles. The level of S 100 A 3 mRNA was elevated during the anagen phase of the hair growth cycle, and sharply declined from the regression phase on. In situ hybridization revealed that the S 100 A 3 gene was prominently expressed in cuticular cells of the hair follicle, and mRNA levels were highest in the keratogenous zone over the entire cuticular layer. Expression was also observed {{to a lesser extent}} in differentiated cortical cells; however, expression was not observed in any other component of the hair follicle or dorsal tissues. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that the S 100 A 3 protein accumulated in cuticular and cortical cells undergoing terminal differentiation. These results indicate that the S 100 A 3 gene is exclusively expressed, and the translation product retained, in follicular cells differentiating into major components of the hair shaft.

40|$|Background: Nearly 1 % of {{children}} in the United States exhibit autism spectrum disorders, but causes and treatments remain to be identified. Mice with deletion of the fragile X mental retardation 1 (Fmr 1) gene are used to model autism because loss of Fmr 1 gene function causes Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) and many people with FXS exhibit autistic-like behaviors. Glycogen synthase kinase- 3 (GSK 3) is hyperactive in brains of Fmr 1 knockout mice, and inhibition of GSK 3 by lithium administration ameliorates some behavioral impairment in these mice. We extended our studies of this association by testing whether GSK 3 contributes to socialization behaviors. This used two mouse models with disrupted regulation of GSK 3, Fmr 1 knockout mice and GSK 3 knockin mice, in which inhibitory serines of the two isoforms of GSK 3, GSK 3 a and GSK 3 b, are mutated to alanines, leaving GSK 3 fully active.

Basolateral exposure of <b>mouse</b> <b>S</b> 2 segments to 10 (- 11), 10 (- 10), and 10 (- 9) M angiotensin II stimulated tNH 3 production rates by 23, 52, and 49 %, respectively. Addition of 10 (- 6) M angiotensin II inhibited the tNH 3 production rate by 34 %. 10 (- 10) M angiotensin II inhibited net luminal secretion of tNH 3 {{in the presence}} of enhanced luminal acidification {{and in the absence of}} altered luminal tNH 3 efflux rates. Measurements of intracellular pH (pHi) and intracellular calcium concentration [(Ca 2 +]i) suggested that the effects of angiotensin II on tNH 3 production were not mediated by changes in pHi but by the stimulatory effect of angiotensin II correlated with increased [Ca 2 +]i. Inhibition of the calcium-calmodulin-dependent pathway with W- 7 blocked the stimulatory effect of 10 (- 10) M angiotensin II on tNH 3 production and luminal acidification. These results indicate that angiotensin II has concentration-dependent effects on tNH 3 production; that its action to stimulate tNH 3 production may be mediated by rises in [Ca 2 +]i and the calcium-calmodulin pathway; and that angiotensin II, at concentrations that stimulate tNH 3 production, inhibits net luminal ammonia secretion by a mechanism that is not mediated by diminished luminal acidification or by changes in luminal ammonia efflux rates...|$|R

Unlike previously isolated nucleoside transport-deficient cell lines (A. Cohen, B. Ullman, and D. W. Martin, Jr., J. Biol. Chem. 254 : 112 - 116, 1979), 80 - 5 D 2 cells were only slightly less sensitive to growth inhibition by a variety of cytotoxic nucleosides and were capable of proliferating in hypoxanthine-amethopterin-thymidine-containing medium. The molecular basis for the phenotype of 80 - 5 D 2 cells was incomplete deficiency in the ability of the mutant cells to translocate nucleosides across the plasma membrane. Interestingly, mutant cells were more capable than wild-type cells of transporting the nucleobase hypoxanthine. Residual transport of adenosine into 80 - 5 D 2 cells was just as sensitive to inhibition by nucleosides and more sensitive to inhibition by hypoxanthine than that in wild-type cells, indicating that the phenomena of ligand binding and translocation can be uncoupled genetically. The 80 - 5 D 2 cells lacked cell surface binding sites for the potent inhibitor of nucleoside transport p-nitrobenzylthioinosine (NBMPR) and, consequently, were largely resistant to the physiological effects of NBMPR. However, the altered transporter retained its sensitivity to dipyridamole, another inhibitor of nucleoside transport. The biochemical phenotype of the 80 - 5 D 2 cell line supports the hypothesis that the determinants that comprise the nucleoside carrier site, the hypoxanthine carrier site, the NBMPR binding site, and the dipyridamole binding site of the nucleoside transport function of <b>mouse</b> <b>S</b> 49 cells are genetically distinguishable...|$|R

This mouse model provides a new avenue for research into acute intestinal inflammation because it enables the manipulation and dissection of both the bacterial and host contributions to the disease in unsurpassed detail...|$|R

40|$|Previous work {{identified}} {{an important}} role for hyperglycemia in diabetic nephropathy (The Diabetes Control and Complications Trial Research Group. N Engl J Med 329 : 977 – 986, 1993; UK Prospective Diabetes Study Group. Lancet 352 : 837 – 853, 1998), and increased glomerular GLUT 1 has been implicated. However, the roles of GLUT 1 and intracellular glucose have not been determined. Here, we developed transgenic GLUT 1 -overexpressing <b>mice</b> (GT 1 <b>S)</b> to characterize the roles of GLUT 1 and intracellular glucose {{in the development of}} glomerular disease without diabetes. GLUT 1 was overexpressed in glomerular mesangial cells (MC) of C 57 BL 6 mice, a line relatively resistant to diabetic nephropathy. Blood pressure, blood glucose, glomerular morphometry, matrix proteins, cell signaling, transcription factors, and selected growth factors were examined. Kidneys of GT 1 <b>S</b> <b>mice</b> overexpressed GLUT 1 in glomerular MCs and small vessels, rather than renal tubules. GT 1 <b>S</b> <b>mice</b> were neither diabetic nor hypertensive. Glomerular GLUT 1, glucose uptake, mean capillary diameter, and mean glomerular volume were all increased in the GT 1 <b>S</b> <b>mice.</b> Moderately severe glomerulosclerosis (GS) was established by 26 wk of age in GT 1 <b>S</b> <b>mice,</b> with increased glomerular type IV collagen and fibronectin. Modest increases in glomerular basement membrane thickness and albuminuria were detected with podocyte foot processes largely preserved, in the absence of podocyte GLUT 1 overexpression. Activation of glomerular PKC, along with increased transforming growth factor-β 1, VEGFR 1, VEGFR 2, and VEGF were all detected in glomeruli of GT 1 <b>S</b> <b>mice,</b> likely contributing to GS. The transcription factor NF-κB was also activated. Overexpression of glomerular GLUT 1, mimicking the diabetic GLUT 1 response, produced numerous features typical of diabetic glomerular disease, without diabetes or hypertension. This suggested GLUT 1 may play {{an important role}} in the development of diabetic GS...|$|R
50|$|A spike strip (also {{known as}} traffic spikes, tire shredders, one-way traffic treadles, stingers, stop sticks, a stinger in police slang, and {{formally}} {{known as a}} tire deflation device) is a device used to impede or stop the movement of wheeled vehicles by puncturing their tires. Generally, the strip is composed {{of a collection of}} 35 to 75 mm (1.5 to 3 inches) long metal <b>s,</b> <b>teeth</b> or spikes pointing upward. The barbs are designed to puncture and flatten tires when a vehicle is driven over them. The barbs may be hollow or solid. Hollow barbs are designed to become embedded in the tires and allow air to escape at a steady pace in an attempt {{to reduce the risk of}} the driver crashing into oncoming traffic or the surroundings. One type was co-invented by Donald Kilgrow, a retired Utah Highway Patrol trooper, along with a design engineer. They are historically a development of the caltrop, anti-cavalry and anti-personnel versions being used as early as 331 BC by Darius III against Alexander the Great at the Battle of Gaugamela in Persia.|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this study is to assess the impact of {{preventive}} dental services (screening, oral health education, and fluoride varnish) given by pediatric medical providers with an assessment of caregivers interviewed at baseline and at 6 -months follow-up. Methods: Using a prospective cohort study design, an oral health knowledge and socio-demographic questionnaire was delivered to a cross-section of caregivers of preschool-aged children seen at VCU Children 2 ̆ 7 s Pavilion. Baseline data was used to conduct a cross-sectional analysis of caregivers prior to their children receiving preventive dental services (screening, oral health education, and fluoride varnish). Subsequently, six months into the program, caregivers of children receiving preventive dental services were retested on their oral health knowledge. The 23 -item questionnaire included knowledge, behavior and opinion items on risk factors for dental diseases, care of child 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>teeth,</b> and socio-demographic characteristics of the family. Data collection occurred in the clinic waiting rooms and the examination rooms. Results: A sample of 120 caregivers completed the baseline questionnaire. Caregivers at baseline reported 89...|$|R
