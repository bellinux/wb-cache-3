The mean radial growth, the pattern of seasonal growth, and the degree of variation in growth between lobes of the reconstructed thalli, were similar to those of control thalli. When lobes were removed from thalli and glued apart from one another, the pattern of seasonal growth and the degree of variation in lobe growth were unaffected, but annual growth rates were reduced compared with lobes reconstructed into a thallus. Glueing the lobes together in a different configuration and constructing thalli in which each lobe came from a different ‘donor’ thallus did not influence the mean radial growth of the lobes or the degree of variation in lobe growth.

High-resolution digital elevation models reveal a continuous 75 km-long field of streamlined landforms that indicate the ice flow direction of a major northeast-flowing lobe of the Cordilleran Ice Sheet (CIS) or a montane glacier (> 200 km wide) was deflected to a north-northwest trajectory as it coalesced with the retreating LIS. The streamlined landforms are composed of till containing clasts of eastern provenance that imply that the LIS reached its maximum extent before the western-sourced ice flow crossed the area. Since the LIS only reached this region in the late Wisconsinan, the CIS/montane ice responsible for the streamlined landforms must have occupied the area after the LIS withdrew.

For the overwhelming majority of cases, the Delta-phi distribution is symmetric and has a single <b>major</b> <b>lobe</b> centered at the mean value of the distribution Delta-phi. Whereas the mean Delta-phi was found to be close to zero degrees for bare soil, cut vegetation, alfalfa, soybeans, and clover, a different pattern was observed for the corn fields; the mean Delta-phi increased with increasing incidence angle Theta = 35 deg. The explanation proposed for this variation is that the corn canopy, most of whose mass is contained in its vertical stalks, acts like a uniaxial crystal characterized by different velocities of propagation for waves with horizontal and vertical polarization. Thus, it is hypothesized that the observed backscatter is contributed by a combination of propagation delay, forward scatter by the soil surface, and specular bistatic reflection by the stalks.

40|$|The {{peculiar}} bi-lobed {{shape of}} comet 67 P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko {{has raised the}} core {{question as to whether}} this is either the expression of two once-distinct objects or the result of a localized excavation on the outgassing region at the interface between the two lobes. The widespread layering involving most of the comet’s surface gives an unambiguous answer to this conundrum. Here we show that the <b>major</b> <b>lobe</b> (the main body) of the comet is enveloped by a nearly continuous set of layers, up to 650 m thick, which is independent from an analogous layered envelope on the minor lobe (the head). Gravity vectors computed for the two lobes separately are nearly perpendicular to the layers while gravity vectors of the entire nucleus diverge from perpendicular toward the neck, separating the two lobes. Therefore 67 P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko is an accreted body of two distinct objects with “onion-like” layered envelopes, formed before they merged. Our analysis provides compelling evidence that gentle low-velocity collisions occurred between fully formed km-sized cometessimals {{in the early stages of}} the Solar System. In addition, the striking structural similarities between the two lobes, together with the established compositional homogeneity of the surface, indicate that early forming cometessimals experienced a similar primordial layering accretion, having formed completely independently...|$|E

Both studies suggested there was a phase of increasing RGR in small thalli followed by a more constant phase, the latter beginning at approximately a thallus radius of 6 - 8 mm. However, in Study B significantly increased RGR was observed during the second 6 -month growth period. This phase of growth {{was more likely to}} be due to an increase in lobe width than to an effect of climate. In addition, a lobe in a large thallus with both adjacent lobes removed significantly increased in width over 1 year compared with control lobes.

The Calabrian arc can be divided into 4 domains (from SE to NW) : 1) the undeformed Ionian abyssal plain, 2) the external evaporitic wedge, 3) the internal clastic wedge, 4) the Calabrian backstop (Variscan crystalline basement). The Calabrian accretionary wedge can also be divided laterally into two <b>major</b> <b>lobes,</b> the NE- and the SW lobes, and two minor lobes.
