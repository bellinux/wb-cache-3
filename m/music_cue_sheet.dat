5000|$|... "Vertigogo" [...] is {{the title}} theme for the Four Rooms film soundtrack by Combustible Edison. It was {{submitted}} for consideration for an Academy Award but was ultimately disqualified from consideration because of its incomprehensible lyrical content. The reply by Music Branch Executive Committee chairman stipulated that [...] "A special meeting was held recently {{for members of the}} Music Branch Executive Committee to view the video clip of your song and the <b>music</b> <b>cue</b> <b>sheet</b> and vocal lead sheet were carefully followed. The following decision was reached: The song [...] "Vertigogo" [...] was declared ineligible in the Original Song category because the lyric was not intelligible". The rejection stood {{despite the fact that the}} band submitted a lyric sheet with their best written approximation of the lyrics.|$|E

5000|$|In {{trying to}} {{establish}} who was the composer of any given film, Clifford McCarty consulted a variety of sources. The two primary sources were the music scores themselves and the <b>music</b> <b>cue</b> <b>sheets.</b> <b>Cue</b> <b>sheets</b> were the legal documents reporting the musical contents of a sound film. They tend to vary on level of detail, but most include the title of cue or name of a musical composition, its composer, and its publisher. They also include information on instrumental and vocal music, background and visual, and their duration measured in minutes and seconds. Their limitations are that they tend not to distinguish between original and preexisting music, and that they credit the original composer and not the one responsible for the adaptation. [...] McCarty also used secondary sources, particularly when the primary sources were long lost or unavailable to him.|$|R
5000|$|One of {{the most}} sought-after {{unreleased}} <b>music</b> <b>cues</b> from the film is the one where Williams provides low-key lounge music during a party prior to the announcement of a fire. O’Halloran orders Duncan to evacuate the party; the music becomes louder as Lisolette and Harlee are seen dancing and Duncan lectures son-in-law Roger. Titled [...] "The Promenade Room" [...] on the conductor's <b>cue</b> <b>sheet,</b> the track features a ragged ending as Duncan asks the house band to stop playing. Because of this, Film Score Monthly could not add this cue to the expanded soundtrack album.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Cue</b> <b>sheets</b> can {{describe}} {{many types of}} audio and data CDs. The main data (including audio) for a CD described by a <b>cue</b> <b>sheet</b> is stored {{in one or more}} files referenced by the <b>cue</b> <b>sheet.</b> <b>Cue</b> <b>sheets</b> also specify track lengths, and CD-Text including track and disc titles and performers. They are especially useful when dividing audio stored in a single file into multiple songs or tracks. The data files referred to by the <b>cue</b> <b>sheet</b> may be audio files (commonly in MP3 or WAV format), or plain disc images, usually with a [...]bin extension.|$|R
50|$|A <b>cue</b> <b>sheet</b> {{can also}} be a list of songs {{appearing}} in a film or TV show. The <b>cue</b> <b>sheet</b> shows all the music titles with metadata like composers, publishers, length of use, and shares of ownership. The <b>cue</b> <b>sheet</b> helps determine who should be paid when the film or TV show airs.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>cue</b> <b>sheet,</b> or <b>cue</b> file, is a {{metadata}} file {{which describes}} how the tracks of a CD or DVD are laid out. <b>Cue</b> <b>sheets</b> are stored as plain text files and commonly have a [...] ".cue" [...] filename extension. CDRWIN first introduced <b>cue</b> <b>sheets,</b> which are now supported by many optical disc authoring applications and media players.|$|R
50|$|In {{order to}} allow <b>cue</b> <b>sheets</b> {{to be used to}} burn a CD from {{ordinary}} file sets which have the gap portion {{at the end of each}} file, the CD ripping & burning program Exact Audio Copy (EAC) allows the creation of <b>cue</b> <b>sheets</b> that relax the CDRWIN Users Manual's restriction on where FILE commands can be used. This non-conforming <b>cue</b> <b>sheet</b> format, intended only for burning CDs with EAC, isn't supported by some other pieces of software, such as the media player foobar2000, which allows the use of <b>cue</b> <b>sheets</b> as playlists.|$|R
50|$|In 1923, the Cameo Thematic Music Co. was {{established}} by M.J. Mintz, {{and by the end}} of the decade, was responsible for about 90% of <b>cue</b> <b>sheets.</b> Ernst Luz and James C. Bradford were the most prolific compilers for Cameo. Other music companies, such as Belwin Inc., also printed <b>cue</b> <b>sheets.</b> Belwin's <b>cue</b> <b>sheets</b> were generally compiled by Max Winkler.|$|R
50|$|Another {{approach}} {{is for the}} audio player to support the <b>cue</b> <b>sheet</b> directly. This may involve providing a new playlist (for example, an extra window) for {{the contents of the}} <b>cue</b> <b>sheet,</b> or adding an entry for each track directly into the main playlist.|$|R
5000|$|The soundtrack {{was limited}} to a 3,000 copies release. Horner’s main title <b>music</b> {{incorporates}} <b>cues</b> from the score by Nino Rota from Federico Fellini's film Amarcord (1973) and Raymond Scott’s piece [...] "Powerhouse B" [...] (1937), the latter often referenced in Carl Stalling’s Warner Bros. cartoon scores. Scott's piece was used without payment or credit, leading his estate to threaten legal action against Disney. Disney paid an undisclosed sum in an out-of-court settlement and changed the film's <b>cue</b> <b>sheets</b> to credit Scott. Horner’s main title music underscores all the major moments involving Szalinski’s technology.|$|R

50|$|<b>Cue</b> <b>sheets</b> {{communicate}} {{the placement of}} cues that the LD has created for the show, using artistic terminology rather than technical language, and information on exactly when each cue is called, so that the stage manager and the assistants know when and where to call the <b>cue.</b> <b>Cue</b> <b>sheets</b> are of the most value to stage management.|$|R
50|$|Some {{conductors}} compiled {{their own}} scores rather than use cue sheets; some followed the <b>cue</b> <b>sheet,</b> but used their own choices of music; many followed the <b>cue</b> <b>sheet</b> with what little {{time they had}} to produce an opera's worth of music. Much of the time, musicians came in and sight-read their parts, with little to no time to rehearse.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{argues that}} how-to manuals and <b>cue</b> <b>sheets</b> are {{indicative}} of ideal performance practice amongst musicians from the silent film era. Pre-scored music was widely practiced amongst musicians. How-to manuals and <b>cue</b> <b>sheets</b> helped the musician accurately and consistently accompany a film. Authors of period manuals include W. Tyacke George, Edith Lang and George West, Ernst Luz and George Tootell. Compilers of <b>cue</b> <b>sheet</b> include James C. Bradford, Ernst Luz, Edward Kilenyi and Michael P. Krueger. Cue by cue analyses of The Cat and the Canary and The Gaucho show a high repetition of music, establishing continuity between the music played and {{the image on the}} screen. This shows how compilers associated music and film. These manuals and <b>cue</b> <b>sheets</b> prove that the musician community strove for a close connection between the image on screen and accompaniment. By 1920, arbitrary improvisation was unacceptable...|$|R

50|$|A common {{workaround}} is {{to encode}} consecutive tracks as one single file, relying on <b>cue</b> <b>sheets</b> (or something similar) for navigation. While this method results in gapless playback within consecutive tracks, {{it can be}} unwieldy because of the possibly large size of the resulting compressed file. Furthermore, unless the playback software or hardware can recognize the <b>cue</b> <b>sheets,</b> navigating between tracks may be difficult.|$|R
50|$|A <b>cue</b> <b>sheet</b> is a {{plain text}} file {{containing}} commands {{with one or more}} parameters. The commands usually apply either to the whole disc or to an individual track, depending on the particular command and the context. They may describe the layout of data to be written, or CD-Text (metadata). The original specification of the <b>cue</b> <b>sheet</b> syntax and semantics appears in the CDRWIN User Guide.|$|R

50|$|Generally, {{at least}} with a preset board, the {{operator}} has a <b>cue</b> <b>sheet</b> for each scene, which is a diagram of the board with the faders in their positions {{as determined by the}} lighting designer. The operator sets the faders into their positions based on the <b>cue</b> <b>sheets.</b> Typically during a cue, the operator sets the next scene. Then, the operator makes the transition between the scenes using the cross-fader.|$|R
50|$|The <b>cue</b> <b>sheet</b> format, as {{specified}} in the CDRWIN Users Manual, doesn't support file sets of this type; rather, it's designed {{with the expectation that}} all of the audio data exists in a single file (CDRWIN only creates <b>cue</b> <b>sheets</b> for that kind of rip) or in separate files, but only with the gap portions of the audio either removed or placed {{at the beginning of the}} files.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} our {{implementation of}} a personal real-time live broadcast system. This system is comprised of three main components: the caster program, data manipulation program, and management program. The caster program is a client program running on the end user's personal computer equipped with a webcam. This program provides a convenient environment (<b>cue</b> <b>sheet,</b> prompts, reference image, buttons to control broadcasting) in which the user can create his video contents easily. The data manipulation program receives user's webcam video stream, combines the stream with the reference image and texts, then outputs HDMI, SID or RTSP as the manager directs. The management program manages broadcasting schedules, <b>cue</b> <b>sheets,</b> and users. User registration, user information modification, and deletion of a user are handled by the management program. A producer creates a broadcasting schedule (<b>cue</b> <b>sheets)</b> with the management program. One of the distinguished features of our personal real-time live broadcast system is its less than 1 second delay time...|$|R
