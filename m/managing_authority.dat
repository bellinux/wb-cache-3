Such a management action can make a significant contribution toward the protection of biodiversity, as Phytophthora cinnamomi poses a serious threat to native vegetation in the Conservation Area, particularly the biodiversity of buttongrass and orchid communities. Fire management practices are also employed as a means of protecting the Conservation Area's orchid community. The Fire Management Plan for the Peter Murrell Reserves (2006), was developed for a variety of reasons, some of which were to provide ecological and fuel reduction outcomes, and facilitate maintenance of ideal conditions for orchid regeneration.|$|E

40|$|Assessing the ‘new’ CAP after 2013 reveals some {{positive}} developments encouraging MAs (<b>Managing</b> <b>Authorities)</b> to recognise the particular characteristics {{of small and}} SSFs, in designing and implementing appropriate policy options. Because Pillar I aid is unavoidably linked to scale and many small farms cannot or do not claim it, the financial impact of Pillar I on small and SSFs will remain modest. Nevertheless, more options exist for increasing this impact through explicit or implicit tailoring, where Member States so choose. The Small Farmers Scheme, in particular, offers benefits by reducing transaction costs. For Pillar II, the new framework offers more scope for funding tailored to {{the specific needs of}} small and SSF farms, but {{there is no guarantee that}} this will translate into more cost-effective Rural Development Programmes, and there is concern that such developments may be disincentivised by other aspects of the approach. Stronger guidance from the European Commission, as well as support from the European Network for Rural Development, could help <b>Managing</b> <b>Authorities</b> to consider the needs of these farms more fully in Rural Development Programme design. In sum, the ‘new’ CAP offers greater potential to support and enhance the value of Europe's small and SSFs than its predecessor. Ultimately, much depends upon choices made at national or regional levels, given the considerable range of options now available...|$|R
