5|$|Other {{than the}} Octopus card itself, {{operator}} Octopus Cards Limited also sells watches and <b>mobile</b> <b>phone</b> covers that function as anonymous Octopus cards. The types of watches available include wrist watches, pocket watches, and watch key chains. The <b>mobile</b> <b>phone</b> covers were {{specifically designed for}} Nokia models 3310 and 3330, and iPhone 4 and 4S. As with the card itself, these products are used by waving them over a card reader. They may be reloaded with money value {{the same way as}} the card itself, including automatic reloading via the Automatic Add Value Service, with the exception that they cannot be reloaded at Add Value Machines due to their shapes. An Octopus watch or <b>mobile</b> <b>phone</b> cover may be stored with a maximum of HK$1,000, but do not have any initial stored value at the time of its purchase. It may have a maximum negative value of HK$35 as with an Octopus card. These products are not refundable for their costs, but the remaining value stored on them may be refunded if they are damaged, with the damaged product itself also returned to the customer.|$|E

Microorganisms from HCWs' hands could be transferred to the surfaces of the <b>mobile</b> <b>phones</b> during their use. Methods 200 HCWs were screened; samples from the hands of 200 participants and 200 <b>mobile</b> <b>phones</b> were cultured. Results In total, 94. 5 % of phones demonstrated evidence of bacterial contamination with different types of bacteria. The gram negative strains were isolated from <b>mobile</b> <b>phones</b> of 31. 3 % and the ceftazidime resistant strains from the hands were 39. 5 %. S. aureus strains isolated from <b>mobile</b> <b>phones</b> of 52 % and those strains isolated from hands of 37. 7 % were methicillin resistant.

The {{aim of this study}} is to evaluate the microbial contamination of <b>mobile</b> <b>phones</b> and stethoscopes, used by medical and paramedical staff. The study was conducted in neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) of Mohamed VI University Hospital, Marrakech (Morocco) in April 2016. The bacteriological study was made on 17 <b>mobile</b> <b>phones</b> and 13 stethoscopes. Samples were taken from all surfaces of <b>mobile</b> <b>phones</b> and stethoscopes, with a sterile swab. Bacterial contamination rate of all <b>mobile</b> <b>phones</b> and stethoscopes was 100 %. The cultures of bacteria isolated were polymorphic. Among the bacteria isolated, six multi-resistant bacterial strains were isolated at the <b>mobile</b> <b>phones</b> (35 %), corresponding to 4 Klebsiella pneumoniae and 2 strains of E. coli. A strain of Klebsiella pneumoniae multidrug-resistant (7. 7 %) was found on a stethoscope. This study shows that <b>mobile</b> <b>phones</b> and stethoscopes could be involoved in the transmission of severe nosocomial infections, with multidrug-resistance.

40|$|Due to {{the rapid}} {{development}} of economy and technology, China has the biggest production and possession of <b>mobile</b> <b>phones</b> around the world. In general, <b>mobile</b> <b>phones</b> have relatively short life time {{because the majority of}} users replace their <b>mobile</b> <b>phones</b> frequently. Retired <b>mobile</b> <b>phones</b> represent the most valuable electrical and electronic equipment (EEE) in the main waste stream because of such characteristics as large quantity, high reuse/recovery value and fast replacement frequency. Consequently, the huge amount of retired <b>mobile</b> <b>phones</b> in China calls for a sustainable management system. The generation estimation can provide fundamental information to construct the sustainable management system of retired <b>mobile</b> <b>phones</b> and other waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE). However, the reliable estimation result is difficult to get and verify. The priority aim {{of this paper is to}} provide proper estimation approach for the generation of retired <b>mobile</b> <b>phones</b> in China, by comparing some relevant methods. The results show that the sales&new method is in the highest priority in estimation of the retired <b>mobile</b> <b>phones.</b> The result of sales&new method shows that there are 47. 92 million <b>mobile</b> <b>phones</b> retired in 2002, and it reached to 739. 98 million in China in 2012. It presents an increasing tendency with some fluctuations clearly. Furthermore, some discussions on methodology, such as the selection of improper approach and error in the input data, are also conducted in order to improve generation estimation of retired <b>mobile</b> <b>phones</b> and other WEEE.
