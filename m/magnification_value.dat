After 6 applications of mirex bait at 1.4 kg/ha, high mirex levels were found in some species; turtle fat contained 24.8 mg mirex/kg, kingfishers, 1.9 mg/kg, coyote fat, 6 mg/kg, opossum fat, 9.5 mg/kg, and racoon fat, 73.9 mg/kg. In a model ecosystem with a terrestrial-aquatic interface, sorgum seedlings were treated with mirex at 1.1 kg/ha. Caterpillars fed on these seedlings and their faeces contaminated the water which contained algae, snails, Daphnia, mosquito larvae, and fish. After 33 days, the ecological <b>magnification</b> <b>value</b> was 219 for fish and 1165 for snails.|$|E
40|$|Slab sliding system (SSS) with Coulomb {{friction}} {{interface between}} slab and supporting frame is a passive structural vibration control technology. The system can {{significantly reduce the}} slab acceleration and accompanied lateral force of the frame. At {{the same time it}} is expected to cause the slab displacement magnification by sliding movement. To obtain the general comprehensive seismic response of a single story structure, inelastic response spectra were computed for a large ensemble of ground motions and a practical range of structural periods and friction coefficient values. It was shown that long period structures have no trade-off relation between force reduction and displacement magnification with respect to elastic response, unlike short period structures. For structures with the majority of mass in the slab, the displacement <b>magnification</b> <b>value</b> can be predicted according to simple inelastic displacement relation for inelastically responding SDOF structures because the system behaves elastically to a SDOF structure...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: The aim of {{this study}} is to present the damped dynamic {{response}} of a symmetric laminated composite beam with different boundary conditions. A three-dimensional finite element model based on the classical laminated plate theory is used together with the Newmark integration method in order to obtain the dynamic response of the beam. A computer code written in MATLAB was developed in order to perform the dynamic analyses. The proportional damping which is referred to as Rayleigh damping is employed in the dynamic analyses. The impulse, step and moving load responses of the composite beam are presented for different damping ratios. The effect of the damping ratio on the dynamic <b>magnification</b> <b>value,</b> which is defined as the ratio between the dynamic and static displacements calculated for the mid point of the beam, is investigated. The normalized time values at which the maximum mid-point displacements occur are presented. The results reported in this article show that the largest dynamic magnification values are recorded for a pinned–pinned beam and the dynamic magnification values decrease as the damping ratio increases.

40|$|Two-element {{cylindrical}} {{electrostatic lens}} systems allowed to control low energy electron or charged particle beam have great importance. In this context, dynamic {{artificial neural network}} using nonlinear autoregressive exogenous model has been utilized to predict optimum linear magnification and overall voltage values for these lens designs. The focusing characteristics of electron beam in two-element cylindrical lens systems are investigated with two different nonlinear autoregressive exogenous based artificial neural network models. First artificial neural network model is employed for predicting of voltage ratios of lenses and <b>magnification</b> <b>values.</b> This model inter-polates among the object (P) and image positions (Q) and finally finds optimum voltage ratios and <b>magnification</b> <b>values</b> through training dataset. Due to the deviations of electron trajectories in a real lens system, the spherical aberration effects are also taken into account to determine the optimal lens parameters. Therefore, the second artificial neural network model is constructed for predicting spherical aberration coefficients in image point. For each of artificial neural network models, training, test and validation data set are obtained from SIMION 8. 1 ion and electron optics software. Artificial neural network model outputs are compared with the SIMION data and very good agreements are found. While artificial neural network is frequently applied in different fields, {{this is the first}} study that uses dynamic artificial neural network to predict the parameters of electrostatic lens. It is believed that this pioneering work will be a guide for the future investigations in lens design systems...|$|R

30|$|Ideally, the {{calculations}} mentioned above {{can only be}} applied if the light leaves a schematic eye at parallel beams, that is, if the patient is emmetropic. Quantitative relations, however, between lenses to compare are not affected if standard <b>magnification</b> <b>values</b> are applied to the same single eye, which we did for the dimensions given in Figure  2. To achieve exact retinal dimensions, however, the axial length of a given eye and its refractive status are required. If the patient is hyperopic the fundus appears at a little higher magnification (and less magnification in myopia) (Kaschke et al. 2014). This effect, however, is smaller the higher {{the power of the}} fundoscopic lens and the smaller the patient’s refractional error is. Furthermore, if in a hyperopic eye the distance between the corneal apex and the hand held lens is enlarged the fundus appears at a little lower magnification (higher magnification in myopic eye) (Rotter 1955).|$|R
40|$|We {{present the}} results of weak {{gravitational}} lensing statistics in four different cosmological N-body simulations. The data has been generated using an algorithm for the three-dimensional shear, which makes use of a variable softening facility for the N-body particle masses, and enables a physical interpretation for the large-scale structure to be made. Working in three-dimensions also allows the correct use of the appropriate angular diameter distances. Our results are presented {{on the basis of}} the filled beam approximation in view of the variable particle softening scheme in our algorithm. The importance of the smoothness of matter in the universe for the weak lensing results is discussed in some detail. The low density cosmology with a cosmological constant appears to give the broadest distributions for all the statistics computed for sources at high redshifts. In particular, the range in <b>magnification</b> <b>values</b> for this cosmology has implications for the determination of the cosmological parameters from high-redshift Type Ia Supernovæ.

40|$|High-resolution, 1. 10, 2. 05, 2. 12, and 2. 15 μm imaging of the gravitationally lensed system FSC 10214 + 4724 are presented. These data extend Hubble Space Telescope (HST) {{observations}} of the lens system to redder wavelengths, thus providing the highest resolution images to date of the rest-frame optical and narrow-line (i. e., Hɑ+[N II]) regions of the background quasar. The length of the arc in the wide-band continuum images increases with increasing wavelength, and the Hɑ+[N II] emission has a length in between that of the 1. 10 and 2. 05 μm. The structure of the arc changes from having an eastern and western peak at 1. 10 μm to a single peak in the center at 2. 05 μm. The changing structure and length of the arc can {{be understood in terms}} of a model where the background quasar consists of a region of scattered AGN light that dominates at 1. 10 μm (rest-frame 3300 °A), surrounded by a more extended narrow-line region. An even more extended red stellar population would thus contribute light at 2. 05 μm (rest-frame 6200 °A). In addition, the Hɑ+[N II] emission has structural features similar to the 1. 10 μm emission normalized by the (predominantly stellar) 2. 05 μm emission, possibly confirming that the 1. 10 μm emission is a superposition of the sources associated with the line emission (AGN/massive stars) and the red stellar component that dominates the 2. 05 μm emission. The counterimage of the lensed quasar is detected in the 1. 10 and 2. 05 μm images, and the rest-frame 3300 and 6200 °A magnifications of the lensed quasar are calculated to be 50 ± 11 and 25 ± 6, respectively, which translates into rest-frame optical luminosity for the quasar of 6 × 10 ^ 9 L_⊙. These <b>magnification</b> <b>values</b> are lower than the previously measured magnification of � 100 at rest-frame 2400 °A. If the dust in the primary lensing galaxy is not affecting the measurement of the counterimage flux at 2400 and 3300 °A, the magnification of the quasar appears to decrease with increasing wavelength. Flux measurements of the primary lensing galaxy fit the spectral energy distribution of an unevolving elliptical galaxy at a redshift of 0. 9, consistent with previous determinations of the redshift...|$|R

However, few studies, regardless of level of success, have used an analytic procedure {{to identify those}} components of the evaluation system that, if refined further, could improve reliability. The {{purpose of this study}} was to compare intra- and inter-examiner variability in two evaluation methods: glance and grade (global), and checklist and criteria (analytical). Three faculty staff members with more than ten years of clinical and teaching experience evaluated operative procedures performed on plastic teeth representing the primary teeth by thirty dental students in pediatric dentistry preclinical laboratory sessions. The preparations were graded blindly by each of the three evaluators (A, B, and C) three times without <b>magnification.</b> The <b>values</b> were statistically analyzed using Wilcoxon signed rank test and Friedman test setting value of significance at 5 percent. The study revealed that, among the three examiners, the intra-examiner variability was nonsignificant in most situations.

Neither cutting off the scores nor using either evaluation method (glance and grade or criteria and checklist) caused an improvement in variability. The problem of inter-examiner reliabil...|$|R

The magnifications have been calculated for the case of myopic eyes corrected with OLs, which shows the validity of this method since its results are similar to the ones obtained using other methods.

40|$|AbstractWe present direct {{comparisons}} of resolution thresholds and quantitative estimates of retinal ganglion cell separation in humans with reported functional {{magnetic resonance imaging}} estimates of the human linear cortical magnification factor. Measurements of resolution thresholds (MAR), retinal ganglion cell (GC) densities, and linear cortical <b>magnification</b> factor (M) <b>values</b> were taken from the literature. Our objective was to analyse the apparent overrepresentation of human central vision in the visual cortex and to determine whether the cause of this is an effect of the uneven distribution of GC in the retina and/or that central GC have more devoted cortical area per cell. The reserved amount of cortical distance per retinal unit, i. e. the product of M {{on the one hand and}} effective GC separation, MAR, and GC receptive field separation on the other, indicates an overrepresentation of the fovea and immediately surrounding retina in the human striate cortex due to an increase in devoted cortical distance per central GC or resolution unit. This cannot be explained by lateral displacement of foveal ganglion cells nor by peripheral scaling, but rather by an additional magnification in the retino-cortical pathway...|$|R

40|$|A {{strongly}} {{naked singularity}} (SNS) was modelled {{at the center}} of the Galaxy. This specific type of naked singularity was characterized in 2008 by Virbhadra and Keeton. The lens is described using the Janis-Newman-Winicour metric, which has an ordinary mass and massless scalar charge parameters. Gravitational lensing by the SNS gives rise to 4 images: 2 images on the same side as the source and 2 images on the opposite side of the source from the optic axis. We compute magnification centroid, magnification centroid shift, and total absolute <b>magnification</b> for many <b>values</b> of the angular source position. The nature of the curve for all three results are qualitatively similar to Schwarzschild black hole lenses, but quantitatively different. Magnification centroid increases as angular source position increases. As angular source position increases, magnification centroid shift increases to a maximum value, and then begins to decrease. As angular source position becomes large, magnification centroid shift will approach zero. Total magnification is large for small values of angular source position, and decreases to a limiting value of one. The results expand upon previous work on an SNS of ν= 0. 01. If such observations were viewed experimentally, they would show support for an SNS at the galactic center. Interpretation of an SNS would disprove the cosmic censorship hypothesis by Penrose, as well as the weaker cosmic censorship hypothesis by Virbhadra, which allows the existence of weakly naked singularities.

40|$|This thesis investigates {{various aspects}} of {{peripheral}} vision, which is known not to be as acute as vision {{at the point of}} fixation. Differences between foveal and peripheral vision are generally thought to be of a quantitative rather than a qualitative nature. However, the rate of decline in sensitivity between foveal and peripheral vision is known to be task dependent and the mechanisms underlying the differences are not yet well understood. Several experiments described here have employed a psychophysical technique referred to as 'spatial scaling'. Thresholds are determined at several eccentricities for ranges of stimuli which are magnified versions of one another. Using this methodology a parameter called the E 2 value is determined, which defines the eccentricity at which stimulus size must double in order to maintain performance equivalent to that at the fovea. Experiments of this type have evaluated the eccentricity dependencies of detection tasks (kinetic and static presentation of a differential light stimulus), resolution tasks (bar orientation discrimination in the presence of flanking stimuli, word recognition and reading performance), and relative localisation tasks (curvature detection and discrimination). Most tasks could be made equal across the visual field by appropriate <b>magnification.</b> E 2 <b>values</b> are found to vary widely dependent on the task, and possible reasons for such variations are discussed. The dependence of positional acuity thresholds on stimulus eccentricity, separation and spatial scale parameters is also examined.

40|$|AIM: To {{evaluate}} {{the feasibility of}} a new computed virtual chromoendoscopy (CVC) device (M i-scan) in the diagnosis of gastric neoplasia. METHODS: Patients with superficial lesions no larger than 1. 0 cm found during high definition endoscopy were included. Those with advanced or obviously protruded or depressed lesions, lesions larger than 1. 0 cm and/or lesions which were not amenable to observation by zoom function were excluded. The endoscopist was required to give the real-time descriptions of surface pit patterns of the lesions, based on surface pattern classification of enhanced magnification endoscopy. According to previous reports, types&#x 2005;I-III represent non-neoplastic lesions, and types IV-V represent neoplastic lesions. Diagnosis with M i-scan and biopsy was performed before histopathological diagnosis. Magnified images of gastric lesions with and without enhancement were collected for further analysis. The diagnostic yield of real-time M i-scan and effects on magnification image quality by tone enhancement (TE), surface enhancement (SE) and color enhancement (CE) were calculated. The selected images were sent to another endoscopist. The endoscopist rated the image quality of each lesion at 3 levels. Ratings of image quality were based on visualization of pit pattern, vessel and demarcation line. RESULTS: One hundred and eighty-three patients were recruited. Five patients were excluded for advanced gastric lesions, 1 patient was excluded for poor preparation and 2 patients were excluded for superficial lesions larger than 1. 0 cm; 132 patients were excluded for no lesions found by high definition endoscopy. In the end, 43 patients with 43 lesions were included. Histopathology revealed 10 inflammation, 14 atrophy, 10 metaplasia, 1 low grade dysplasia (LGD), 5 high grade dysplasia (HGD) and 3 cancers. For 7 lesions classified into type&#x 2005;I, histopathology revealed 6 atrophy and 1 metaplasia; for 10 lesions classified into type II, histopathology revealed 2 inflammation, 7 atrophy and 1 metaplasia; for 10 lesions classified into type III, histopathology revealed 1 inflammation, 8 metaplasia and 1 LGD; for 9 lesions classified into type IV, histopathology revealed 4 inflammation, 1 atrophy and 4 HGD; for 7 lesions classified into type V, histopathology revealed 3 inflammation, 1 HGD and 3 cancers. A total of 172 still images, including 43 images by white light (MWL) and 129 images by M i-scan (43 with TE, 43 with SE and 43 with CE), were selected {{and sent to the}} endoscopist who did the analysis.
