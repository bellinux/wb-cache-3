40|$|We prove various {{results on}} the {{complexity}} of MCSP (Minimum Circuit Size Problem) and the related MKTP (Minimum Kolmogorov Time-Bounded Complexity Problem) : * We observe that under standard cryptographic assumptions, MCSP has a pseudorandom self-reduction. This is a new notion we define by relaxing {{the notion of a}} random self-reduction to allow queries to be pseudorandom rather than uniformly random. As a consequence we derive a weak form of a worst-case to average-case reduction for (a promise version of) MCSP. Our result also distinguishes MCSP from natural NP-complete problems, which are not known to have worst-case to average-case reductions. Indeed, it is known that strong forms of worst-case to average-case reductions for NP-complete problems collapse the Polynomial Hierarchy. * We prove the first non-trivial formula size lower bounds for MCSP by showing that MCSP requires nearly quadratic-size De Morgan formulas. * We show average-case superpolynomial size lower bounds for MKTP against AC 0 [p] for any prime p. * We show the hardness of MKTP on average under assumptions that have been used in much recent work, such as Feige 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>assumptions,</b> Alekhnovich 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>assumption</b> and the Planted Clique conjecture. In addition, MCSP is hard under Alekhnovich 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>assumption.</b> Using a version of Feige 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>assumption</b> against co-nondeterministic algorithms that has been conjectured recently, we provide evidence {{for the first time that}} MKTP is not in coNP. Our results suggest that it might worthwhile to focus on the average-case hardness of MKTP and MCSP when approaching the question of whether these problems are NP-hard...|$|R

40|$|In this dissertation, I {{focus on}} the soteriological {{understanding}} of the fourth-century theologian Hilary of Poitiers as manifested in his underappreciated Tractatus super Psalmos. Hilary offers an understanding of salvation in which Christ saves humanity by assuming every single person into his body in the incarnation. My dissertation contributes to scholarship on Hilary in two ways. First, I demonstrate that Hilary 2 ̆ 7 s teaching concerning Christ 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>assumption</b> of all humanity is a unique development of Latin sources. Because of his understanding of Christ 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>assumption</b> of all humanity, Hilary, along with several Greek fathers, {{has been accused of}} heterodoxy resulting from Greek Platonic influence. I demonstrate that Hilary is not influenced by Platonism; rather, though his redemption model is unique among the early Latin fathers, he derives his theology from a combination of Latin-influenced biblical exegesis and classical Roman themes. Second, this teaching of Christ 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>assumption</b> of all humanity is a prominent part of Hilary 2 ̆ 7 s entire theological system and so illustrates the unified nature of his theology. The implications of this aspect of Hilary 2 ̆ 7 s thought expand into nearly every realm of his theology: {{in the course of this}} dissertation, I address the areas of soteriology, Christology, eschatology, ecclesiology and Trinitarian theology. Modern Hilary scholarship is defined by a method that approaches Hilary 2 ̆ 7 s theology according to narrow and anachronistic categories of study and results in a negative appraisal of Hilary 2 ̆ 7 s theological contribution. This dissertation, in working with a unified method, serves as a corrective to the standard scholarly approach to Hilary and offers a more positive evaluation of his theology...|$|R

(2) Effect of the ground water level on the seepage rate from paddy field. In the first topic, ground water level was obtained by the solution of Boussinesq 2 ̆ 7 s equation based on the Dupuit 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>assumption.</b> This solution was compared with experiments and {{it was found that}} there are the cases in which the Dupuit 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>assumption</b> is not valid. In these cases, problems may be analyzed by numerical method. In the second topic, experiments were carried out relating to the change of the seepage rate with the change of the ground water level. As a result, it was sought that the change of the ground water level does not effect the seepage rate in low ground water levels and the seepage rate decreases as the ground water level rises.

An equivalent circuit is derived for an antenna coupled to a shielding cavity via field analysis. A proof is provided for the validity of Wheeler 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>assumption</b> that the loss resistance of the antenna placed in the Wheeler 2 ̆ 7 s cap is not changed {{by the presence of}} the cap if the dimension of the cap is appropriately large. This proof extends the validation of Wheeler 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>assumption</b> to a hollow cavity of arbitrary shape. ^ It is observed in experiments that at the resonant frequencies of the cavity, the input resistance of the antenna attains values two or three orders of magnitude higher than that at frequencies away from resonance. It is shown via theoretical analysis that the input resistance of the antenna measured at resonant frequencies of the cavity is not merely the loss resistance desired in computing the antenna efficiency, but is actually the sum of the loss resistance of the antenna and the coupling resistance between the antenna and cavity. This coupling effect is demonstrated quantitatively by numerical computations for dipole and monopole antennas. The computational results for the input resistance are in agreement with the measured data. A method is proposed to avoid the cavity-antenna antiresonance in the measurement. ...|$|R
