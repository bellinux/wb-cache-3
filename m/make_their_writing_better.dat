40|$|Many {{students}} within my school struggle with writing in English, especially dealing with content {{and organization of}} texts. The present study sought to resolve these issues by explaining how well the use of cooperative learning activit ies in teaching writing gives contribution {{to the development of}} students‘ writing. Two cycles of an action research had been implemented to 26 students of eleventh graders. The primary data were the teacher‘s daily journal, the students‘ interview results, the students‘ pre-cycle test results, and the students‘ post -test results. The secondary data were the students‘ artifacts and the interpretation of the video recorder. This study explained the pattern of change related to the students‘ writing. At {{the end of the second}} cycle my students gained improvement. In the area of content, my students were able to move from scratch writing to writing with clear ideas and full of knowledgeable information. It was assumed that spoken drill on think-pair-shared activities helped my students to state ideas clearly. In the area of text organization, my students were able to write in sequence order. It was assumed that the drill on peer review has trained them to <b>make</b> <b>their</b> <b>writing</b> <b>better</b> organized following the organization of the genre. The improvement was significant. It was indicated by the post -test‘s score that was better than the pre-cycle‘s test score. The mean score f the pre-test was 65. 77 and 81. 5 in the second post test. The results suggest that structuring discussion and conversation during the ooperative learning activities help the students perform better in writing...|$|E

This research uses classroom action research. The subject ofthe research is the students of class X at SMAN 1 Gadingrejo in the academic year 2011 / 2012. The result of this research is that, there was 25. 92 % of improvement from the firstcycle until second cycle in learning process. It happened since the teacher asked thestudents to change the position {{in order to make the}} teaching-learning process runningwell. The passive students in the left row sat next to the active students in the rightrow. It was done in order to make the passive students become more active. Bychanging the studentsâ€™ position, it encouraged the passive students being more activesince they sat next to the active students. Meanwhile, there are 23 students (85. 18 %) whose scores had achieved the target of the indicator in learning product. It was foundthat the studentsâ€™ writing scores improved when the teacher focused on the specificerrors based on the correction checklist that was given. Correction checklist providedspecific errors to enable and help the students in correcting their peerâ€™s work. Byusing it, the students felt easier when they should focus on some errors.

40|$|People want to {{know how}} Labor will <b>make</b> <b>their</b> lives <b>better,</b> <b>writes</b> David Burchell JUST about {{everyone}} who heard the PM’s election announcement on Sunday must have wondered about the opening sentences, in which he baldly stated that ‘this election will be about trust’, and went on to detail the spheres in which the Coalition were better guardians of the public trust than their opponents. After weeks of unwelcome controversy about the PM’s role in the ‘children overboard’ affair, and the bad smell which lingers from that affair in terms of the PM’s personal credibility, it seemed {{on the face of it}} an odd and audacious gambit. Indeed, if you listen to sections of the media, this election will be decided by questions of honesty and credibility. How could a PM who dissembled on ‘children overboard’ be entrusted by the electorate with the highest office in the land? Surely trust has to be a winner for Labor? Yet, not for the first time (remember 1975 ?), the press gallery may be a little behind the game. As this week’s Newspoll suggested vividly, the electorate is less interested in the government’s dissembling in 2001 than in the parties’ policies for 2005 - 07, less preoccupied by the length of the PM’s nose than the size of the health budget. In pushing Labor further down the path of a negative campaign based on repetitious claims of lies and deceit, the press gallery (for all its mistrust of him) may actually be the PM’s best friend. The gallery’s confusion isn’t hard to understand. In the good old days politics was a kind of war. There were attacks, counter-attacks and holding operations. You defended ‘your’ people and attacked the other side’s. All that’s changed. Political campaigning now looks less like hand to hand combat, and more like political jujitsu, where the prime aim is to turn your opponent’s strength against them, the better to bring them tumbling to the electoral mat. From late 2001 till late 2003 the judo match was going more or less entirely the government’s way. It had manoeuvred Labor into a morass of high-principle, first over refugees and then over the war in Iraq. All the while Labor’s policy messages on health and education were being lost. The PM could just sit there, an enigmatic smile playing around his lips, looking like a venerable black-belter. With the ascent of Mark Latham to Labor’s leadership, the rules of the game suddenly altered. For a good nine months, government attacks on Mr Latham resembled nothing so much as a first world war artillery barrage. They launched every missile they could find at him, including the kitchen sink, and the marital bed besides. Mostly it was sound and fury, signifying electoral nothing. Meanwhile Mr Latham, that supposed wild bull, sat serenely on the Opposition benches, with an aura of inscrutable peace and tranquility that would put the Dalai Lama to shame. Paradoxically, it’s the ‘children overboard’ embarrassment that seems to have caused the government to dump the khaki, and don the judo-pants once more. Now the PM presents himself as a veritable St Sebastian, suffering silently while the opposition launches wave after wave of arrows in dastardly personal attacks. Meanwhile, Mr Howard has been striving to turn the debate around, the better to gain judo-leverage against Mr Latham’s ample frame. Trust me about some leaky old boat from three years ago - his election statement implicitly asks - or trust Labor on managing the national economy? Which matters more? Twelve months ago it was almost unthinkable that the government could lose this election, or Labor win it. The economy was buoyant, the electorate mostly complacent, the auguries all favourable. Mr Latham has done an extraordinary job in turning Labor’s fortunes around. Now Labor almost deserves to be called the front-runner for 9 October. And yet, as any judo-teacher knows, this is potentially the most dangerous moment of all. Should Labor, its heart high and the wind in its nostrils, really choose to fight this election campaign on truth and honesty in public life, it could find itself smelling the sweaty vinyl of the mat. All Labor’s electoral advantages for twelve months now have come from its positive campaigning - on the problems of suburbia, or families, and of young people. On these issues it’s looked dynamic, and the government has appeared tired and defensive. Truth, honesty and trust all have a noble ring. But in the end they’re a matter of negative campaigning and sniping, artillery-barrages and trench-politics. Perhaps Mr Latham needs to turn a little Buddhist once again. You know the drill. Relax, clear your mind of anything superfluous, and focus only on the higher truths. What people {{want to know}} about in election campaigns is what you can do to better their lives.

40|$|Joan Turner (1996) and Theresa Lillis (2001) {{suggest that}} for ‘non-traditional’ {{students}} language only becomes ‘visible’ as a ‘problem’. With {{the expansion of}} higher education in the UK, however, many more traditional students will be discriminated against as <b>their</b> <b>written</b> language is made ‘visible’ through the reader’s perception of ‘error’. Recent scholarship in student writing has recognised the different ‘academic literacies’ (Lea and Street, 2001) that students bring with them to higher education and has advocated a move away from a skills approach which focuses on ‘surface features’ and towards an approach which centres on how students make meaning through writing.

40|$|Law schools face {{increasing}} pressure to improve instruction in practice-oriented skills. One {{of the most}} important of these skills is legal writing. The existing literature on legal writing contains various rules and suggestions as to how legal writers can improve <b>their</b> <b>writing</b> skills. Yet it lacks an adequate theoretical account of the fundamental nature of good legal writing. As a result, legal writers are left without a solid conceptual framework to ground the individual rules and suggestions. This Article attempts to fill the theoretical void in the literature by offering a systematic analysis of what it is for a legal document to be well written. It starts by examining a foundational conceptual issue, which is what legal writers mean when they say that a legal document is well written. It argues that legal readers judge a document to be well written if the writing helps them make the decisions they need to make in the course of their professional duties. The Article then provides an analysis of the fundamental qualities that enable legal writing to do this, concluding that there are three such qualities: clarity, conciseness, and the ability to appropriately engage the reader. The Article explains why each of these qualities is essential to good legal writing, and it examines the tools good writers use to <b>make</b> <b>their</b> <b>writing</b> clear, concise, and engaging. Lastly, the Article examines what it is that distinguishes the very best writing in the field, arguing that great legal writing is not just writing that is especially clear, concise, and engaging, but is instead writing characterized by a separate quality, elegance, that is aesthetic in nature. The Article then goes on to explore what it is that makes such writing elegant, and whether it is desirable for legal writers to strive for elegance in <b>their</b> own <b>writing.</b> The Article concludes by briefly considering the pedagogical implications of the analysis discussed in the previous sections...|$|R

One kind of text {{that has to}} have cohesiveness is novel. This present study aims to know the types of lexical cohesion used in the Indonesian and English versions of Laskar Pelangi and also {{the similarities and differences}} in the use of lexical cohesion in both novels. This study uses mixed approach. Qualitative approach is used to describe the analysis of the lexical cohesion found in the novels. Quantitative approach is used to count the total number and the percentage of the lexical cohesion used in the novels. Document analysis is also used in this study since the data was taken from novel in which it employs text or document. This study reveals that both Indonesian and English versions of Laskar Pelangi novel used all types of lexical cohesion. There are 3 similarities found in the analysis. First, the most frequent types used in both data are repetition and antonymy. Second, the use of synonymy is the same 8 %. Third, there is no tautotes found in both data. Moreover, there are 2 differences found in the analysis. First, the frequently used lexical cohesion types in Indonesian are repetition, antonymy, synonymy, collocation, hyponymy, and equivalency, while the English are repetition, antonymy, equivalency, collocation, synonymy, meronymy, and hyponymy.

This study is classified into action research which was done from January to March 2015. The subjects of the research were 35 students of class VIII A of SMP Pembangunan Piyungan. The researcher collaborated with the English teacher in conducting the research. There were two cycles in this research. In each cycle picture series was applied as the media and combined with grammar exercise, vocabulary exercise, and games. Some supporting actions, such as, giving prizes and feedback to students’ writing were also provided by the researcher in {{the teaching and learning}} process. The data were obtained and used in qualitative and quantitative forms. The qualitative data were obtained through the classroom observations in the form of observation checklist and field notes and the result of teacher’s and students’ interview in the form of interview transcripts. The qualitative data were obtained through the students’ writing performance in pre-test, post-test 1 and post-test 2 which was transformed into writing score based on the scoring rubric of writing proposed by Jacob et al. ’s in Weigle (2002 : 116). From the implementation of the actions in both cycles, it was proven that picture series was able to improve students’ writing ability. Based on the qualitative data, the use of picture series as the media in the teaching and learning process helped the students in generating and developing the ideas.

40|$|Grammar {{plays an}} {{important}} role in language skills, such as speaking, reading, listening and also writing. In speaking, grammar can help students to produce grammatical utterances. A second language speaker will not have a good performance in speech and will not be able to deliver his/her idea because of the lack of grammar knowledge especially in rules and tenses. The lack of grammar knowledge makes it difficult for students to express <b>their</b> ideas in <b>writing</b> appropriately. Thus, learning grammar is necessary for students to <b>make</b> <b>their</b> <b>writing</b> well understood. By learning grammar, students will be able to make a grammatically correct sentence in writing. However, in a real situation, the first-year students of senior high school who have learned the simple past tense still have difficulties in applying the tense to <b>their</b> <b>writing</b> composition that is recount text. It happens because they still do not understand and master the use of the verb form of simple past tense yet. As a result, they do not know how to change the infinitive form into the regular and irregular verb in positive, negative, and interrogative form. On the other hand, since the simple past tense is related with recount text, the students have to master the simple past tense itself; not only the rules but also the use of the simple past tense in writing context. If they make a mistake in using the simple past tense, it means that they are not capable in <b>writing</b> <b>their</b> recount composition. As a result, the readers may get confused while they read the composition and also they may have difficulties in understanding the content of the composition. Therefore, in order to master grammar which is the simple past tense and writing which is a recount text, the students need a lot of practice in their learning. In this study, the writer intended to see the correlation between one of writing components and the writing ability that is the students’ simple past tense achievement and <b>their</b> recount text <b>writing</b> achievement. This study is classified as correlation study since it describes the relationship between the grammar and writing scores. The subject of this study is the first-year students of YPPI I Senior High School Surabaya.

The result of grammar and writing scores were computed using Pearson Product Moment Correlation formula. The statistical data analysis showed that there was a positive correlation between the simple past tense achievement and writing achievement in recount text.

40|$|This {{aim of this}} {{research}} project was to design and implement a formative assessment system, to support and track the progress Year 1 pupils at The Boys' School <b>make</b> in <b>their</b> <b>writing.</b> This study began with {{an examination of the}} existing literature, exploring the impact formative assessment has on pupil progress, as well as existing initiatives for formative assessment. Two research questions were established and investigated, with close analysis of primary and secondary datasets. Primary data gathered included observations, pupil writing samples and data collected from the formative assessment system itself. Secondary data was gathered from pupil PIE (Progress In English), NGRT (New Group Reading Test) and spelling summative assessments. Data collection occurred in the case study class, where the system was implemented and the control group class, where the system had not been used. Overall, {{it was found that the}} formative assessment system was effective in supporting and tracking pupil progress, by creating an intrinsically motivating learning environment and enabling learning to be carefully monitored and navigated. The success of this investigation has resulted in the formative assessment system being implemented into the English curriculum across Key Stages 1 and 2 at The Boys' School. </p...|$|R
40|$|Writing {{essay is}} still {{considered}} difficult for English students to master. The {{students are expected to}} be able to express their ideas correctly without making any chance of messages to be misinterpreted by the readers; therefore, they have to know and use the best or the most appropriate ways to write. The purpose of writing this article is to introduce learning strategies and the possibility of training of learning strategies in writing essay to English students. The first strategy is integration of strategy with the process of writing essay: pre-writing, writing draft, and post-writing activities. The second is training learning strategies, such as memory, cognitive, compensation, metacognitive, affective, and social strategies to students to make writing essay easier, faster, more enjoyable, more effective, and more self-directed to achieve the desired result in <b>their</b> <b>writing.</b> To get <b>better</b> result of improvement, the model of training of learning strategies in writing essay should be applied and developed based on the appropriateness of teachers, learners, subjects, and situations. ...|$|R

40|$|To gain {{a deeper}} {{understanding}} of young adolescent motivation and developmental needs as the nation plunges ahead with the national Common Core Standards and <b>their</b> implications for <b>writing</b> instruction, the authors of this article pondered five questions as they studied their own middle school writing team: (1) What intrinsic motivators drive these young students to write? (2) What components create a nurturing writing environment? (3) How can we understand student motivation so that we can nurture student interest in writing within the constraints of large classes and mandates to address Common Core Standards? (4) For students who are already intrinsically motivated to write, how can teachers nurture and even deepen [...] not lose [...] this student interest in written performance? and (5) In what ways can a before-school writing team nurture young adolescents 2 ̆ 7 natural craving to write? The {{participants in this study were}} students at River Middle School [pseudonym], a high-poverty school. All students in grade level literacy classes were invited to apply to join a special school writing team. Of the 200 students who received the announcement, 26 students submitted short essay applications in December 2011. All applications were accepted with the anticipation that once students realized they were going to have to arrive an hour early to school once a week, without the school providing transportation, attrition would go down. On the first day, 22 students arrived; they were evenly divided between sixth, seventh, and eighth graders. The final distributions of students consisted of seven sixth graders, three seventh graders, and six eight graders. The participants 2 ̆ 7 writings reflected a strong sense of self-efficacy. All 22 students were strong readers, comfortable with rich language, confident in <b>their</b> <b>writing</b> ability, willing to take risks in writing, and willing to take feedback to <b>make</b> <b>their</b> <b>writing</b> strong. Four of them mentioned their intention to work as professional writers when they grow up. They were writing by choice, on topics of their choosing. Students felt a sense of autonomy and control, which is consistent with research on motivation (Anderman 2 ̆ 6 Maeher, 1994; Bruning 2 ̆ 6 Horn, 2000; Daniels, 2010 and 2011). They asked for time, guidance, and the tools necessary to be successful writers. Based on their findings, the authors conclude that schools must find the time to continue to nurture young people 2 ̆ 7 s search for meaning through storytelling. If there is not time during the regular language arts class periods, then time needs to be provided through an elective, before school, after school, or even during lunch, for students who want a quiet, safe venue to write about topics of their own choosing with support...|$|R
40|$|Many {{students}} {{are unaware of}} the value of learners' dictionaries and prefer to use bilingual dictionaries, which offer a quick and easy translation of unknown vocabulary. Nevertheless, they frequently find that bilingual dictionaries do not provide enough information to allow them to use new words productively By undertaking a vocabulary exercise using either bilingual dictionaries or monolingual English learners' dictionaries, ESL students at an Australian university were exposed to a new resource and evaluated the contribution it made to their use of unfamiliar English vocabulary The potential contribution that learners' dictionaries could <b>make</b> to <b>their</b> use of academic English was also assessed by the students. It was found that, though most students had little prior knowledge of learners' dictionaries, {{at the end of the}} session they rated the learners' dictionaries more highly than bilingual dictionaries in terms of the contnbution which each dictionary could <b>make</b> to <b>their</b> English <b>writing</b> skills.

40|$|This {{case study}} aimed to {{determine}} the impact of using an online collaborative writing program (called Makebook) on teachers' attitudes towards and abilities in developing high school students' sustained writing capabilities. By offering a structured online framework for collaborative writing the system supported a range of pedagogies to develop students extended writing capabilities, including the provision of situated scaffolding, integration of models into the instructional sequence, {{and the use of}} multimedia to enhance concept formation and motivation. The technology enabled teachers to construct collaborative learning designs where students were required to not only co-author their compositions but also reflect upon one another's work. Teachers generally found the Makebook program made it easier to provide students with examples and feedback, and simpler for students to make several revisions and provide one another with suggestions. Teachers also indicated {{that as a result of}} the program they had significantly increased their confidence in using technology, would be significantly more likely to provide their students with opportunities to <b>make</b> revisions to <b>their</b> <b>writing,</b> and would attempt to provide students with more feedback about <b>their</b> <b>writing</b> in future. 11 page(s...|$|R
