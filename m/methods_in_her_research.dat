5000|$|In {{addition}} to Press' theoretical interests, {{questions about the}} epistemological potential of qualitative and ethnographic methodology in communication studies have long been of concern in her writing and research. They have become increasingly important as she has developed and employed several different types of qualitative <b>methods</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>research.</b> Press has written {{about the use of}} ethnographic methodology in the field of communication in the article [...] "Toward a Qualitative Methodology of Audience Study: Using Ethnography to Study the Popular Culture Audience." [...] A piece in the journal Feminist Media Studies and one in the journal Communication and Culture lay out theoretical concerns of interest currently to the community of feminist media studies researchers. She has also published in Contexts and in the Yale Journal of Sociology on issues of gender in high education administration. In {{addition to}} editing several special journal issues (with Mary Beth Haralovich on The New Feminist Television Studies, with Melissa Click on [...] "Feminist Media Studies Today," [...] and, forthcoming in Feminist Media Studies,with Katherine Sender and Andre Cavalcante on [...] "Feminist Media Audiences"), Press is co-editor (with Tasha Oren) of the forthcoming Handbook of Contemporary Feminism (Routledge) and, with Alison Pugh, Alison Alexy, and Susan McKinnon, is working on an edited collection tentatively entitled [...] "New Intimacies." ...|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} study {{discussed in this}} paper is centrally concerned with perception and understanding of innovation and association with the concept in {{small and medium-sized enterprises}} (SMEs). lt is with particular reference to jazz, as a metaphor for innovation, that the concept is examined and an exploration of the effectiveness of the jazz metaphor therefore represents a core focus for this study. lt is within the overarching 'Year of Innovation' programme delivered by the University of Gloucestershire during 2004 - 5, that this study is located. The 'Innovation through Jazz' component of this programme involved the use of live jazz within interactive workshops delivered with Gloucestershire SMEs. The author was involved in the design and delivery of these workshops and these engagements provided a useful forum for exploration of innovation and the jazz metaphor. The author approached this study from an interpretivist worldview, adopting a primarily qualitative methodological approach for this essentially exploratory study. The author used mixed <b>methods</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>research,</b> making particular use of semi-structured interviews, observation and questionnaires. The resultant data set incorporated data of both a qualitative and quantitative nature, triangulated to provide rich insight into perceptions and understanding of innovation and the effectiveness of the jazz metaphor as well as into a number of issues around employment relations in small firms. Given the diversity of small firms {{as well as of the}} individuals within them, the author does not attempt to make generalisations from her findings. This exploratory study does however provide new insight into the effectiveness of the jazz metaphor, applied in the specific context of small firm innovation...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to find out how a course in School Financial Management should be designed and presented in order to bring about an improvement in the practice of school financial management in disadvantaged schools in the Eastern Cape Province of South Africa. The study was conducted in the interpretive and critical theory paradigms, and employed a qualitative empirical approach. The focus of the research was two cohorts of school leaders taking part in the Advanced Certificate in Education: School Management and Leadership programme at the Nelson Mandela Metropolitan University in Port Elizabeth. The researcher presented a course in Financial Management to both of these cohorts, and employed an action <b>research</b> <b>method</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>research,</b> introducing the insights and lessons learned from teaching the first cohort in the design and teaching of the second cohort. Data were collected in various ways, including written assignments of students, class discussions, personal interviews and document analyses. More data were collected during school visits at which the researcher observed the level of financial practice at schools, and could also, from the one-to-one interactions with the students, identify the issues that were still problematic to them. Another aspect of the data gathering process was the detailed analysis of the section on Financial Management in the ACE study material provided by the Department of Education. This enabled the researcher to compare her study material and teaching approach to that of the Department’s study material, so as to ascertain which content and methods of teaching were best suited to bringing about an improvement in practice. The study’s main findings were that designers of such programmes in Financial Management should focus on basic Accounting principles and avoid an overload of content of issues which are “good to know”, but do not contribute to the understanding of Accounting principles necessary for the drawing up of financial statements. The method of teaching should predominantly be an interactive approach based on adult learning principles, with enough time for students to complete certain assignments and activities with feedback by the lecturer. The role v of mentors and of the lecturer visiting schools was emphasised as one of the key ways to assist participants in implementing what they had learned. The most important recommendations emanating from the study were the suggestion that the Department of Education should play a bigger formational role in providing feedback to schools on the financial statements submitted to the Department by these schools, the rethinking of the Department of Education’s module on Financial Management in the ACE for School Principals, and the development of a follow-up course in which all the additional aspects of School Financial Management could be include...|$|R
