5|$|He {{spend much}} of his fortune on {{political}} activism, and was nearly bankrupt {{by the time of}} his death. In February 1790, despite his objections, he was pressured, through general public demand, into reelection for a second (yearly) term of office as the mayor of Warsaw. It is likely that <b>major</b> <b>reasons</b> he preferred not to have been elected were his ailing business operations and his worsening health. He led his last public debate on 31 April 1790, and withdrew from politics afterward. He died on 4 October 1790 in Warsaw. He was buried in St. John's Archcathedral, and his large funeral was paid for by the City of Warsaw.|$|E
5|$|The American {{black duck}} is {{considered}} to be aspecies of least concernby theInternational Union for Conservation of Nature(IUCN). It has long been valued as a game bird. Habitat loss due to drainage, global warming, filling of wetlands due to urbanization and rising sea levels are <b>major</b> <b>reasons</b> for the declining population of the American black duck. The United States Fish and Wildlife Service has been purchasing and managing the habitat of this species in many areas to support the migratory stopover, wintering and breeding populations. The Atlantic Coast Joint Venture also protects habitat through restoration and land acquisition projects, mostly within their wintering and breeding areas.|$|E

5|$|The nilgai is {{categorised}} as of Least Concern by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural resources (IUCN). While it {{is common}} in India, the nilgai occurs sparsely in Nepal and Pakistan. The <b>major</b> <b>reasons</b> behind its decimation in these two countries and extinction in Bangladesh are rampant hunting, deforestation and habitat degradation in the 20th century. As of 2008, the feral population in Texas was nearly 37,000. Wild populations also exist in the US states of Alabama, Florida and Mississippi and the Mexican state of Tamaulipas, where they have escaped from private exotic ranches. The population around the Texas-Mexico border {{is estimated to be}} around 30,000 (as of 2011).|$|E
5|$|The <b>major</b> <b>reasons</b> for rising {{political}} tensions {{among the}} Finns were the autocratic {{rule of the}} Russian Czar and the undemocratic class system of the estates of the realm. The system originated in the Swedish Empire regime, preceding the Russian power, and divided the Finnish people into two groups, separated economically, socially and politically. Finland's population grew rapidly in the 19th century (from 860,000 in 1810 to 3,130,000 in 1917), and a class of industrial and agrarian workers and property-less peasants emerged. The Industrial Revolution was rapid in Finland, though it started later than {{in the rest of}} Western Europe. Industrialization was financed by the state, and some of the social problems associated with the industrial process were diminished via control of the administration. Among urban workers, socioeconomic problems steepened during periods of industrial depression. The position of rural workers had worsened {{since the end of the}} 19th century, as farming became more efficient and market-oriented and the gradually developing industry did not fully utilize the rapid population growth of the countryside.|$|E
5|$|Plans for a parkway linking Baltimore and Washington {{date back}} to Pierre Charles L'Enfant's {{original}} layout for Washington D.C. in the 18th century but did not fully develop until the 1920s. <b>Major</b> <b>reasons</b> surrounding {{the need for a}} parkway included high accident rates on adjacent US1 and defense purposes before World War II. In the mid-1940s, plans for the design of the parkway were finalized and construction began in 1947 for the state-maintained portion and in 1950 for the NPS-maintained segment. The entire parkway opened to traffic in stages between 1950 and 1954. Following the completion of the B–W Parkway, suburban growth took place in both Washington and Baltimore. In the 1960s and the 1970s, there were plans to give the segment of the parkway owned by the NPS to the state and make it a part of I-295 and possibly I-95; however, they never came through and the entire road is today designated as MD295, despite only being signed on the state portion. Between the 1980s and the 2000s, the NPS portion of the road was modernized. MD295 {{is in the process of}} being widened from four to six lanes, with more widening and a new interchange along this segment planned for the future.|$|E

5|$|Since 1988, the American {{black duck}} has been rated as least concern on the IUCN Red List of Endangered Species. This {{is because the}} range of this species is {{extremely}} large, which is not near the threshold of vulnerable species. In addition, the total population is large, and, although it is declining, it is not declining fast {{enough to make the}} species vulnerable. It has long been valued as a game bird, being extremely wary and fast flying. Habitat loss due to drainage, filling of wetlands due to urbanization, global warming and rising sea levels are <b>major</b> <b>reasons</b> for the declining population. Some conservationists consider hybridization and competition with the mallard as an additional source of concern should this decline continue. Hybridization itself is not a major problem; natural selection makes sure that the best-adapted individuals have the most offspring. However, the reduced viability of female hybrids causes some broods to fail in the long run due to the death of the offspring before reproducing themselves. While this is not a problem in the plentiful mallard, it might place an additional strain on the American black duck's population. Recent research conducted for the Delta Waterfowl Foundation suggests that hybrids are a result of forced copulations and not a normal pairing choice by black hens.|$|E
5|$|Tigers once ranged widely across eastern Eurasia, {{from the}} Black Sea in the west, to the Indian Ocean in the south, and from Kolyma to Sumatra in the east. Over the past 100 years, {{they have lost}} 93% of their {{historic}} range, and have been extirpated from Western and Central Asia, from the islands of Java and Bali, and from large areas of Southeast, Southern, and Eastern Asia. Today, they range from the Siberian taiga to open grasslands and tropical mangrove swamps. The remaining six tiger subspecies have been classified as endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). The global population in the wild is estimated to number between 3,062 and 3,948 individuals, down from around 100,000 {{at the start of}} the 20th century, with most remaining populations occurring in small pockets isolated from each other, in which about 2,000 tigers live on the Indian subcontinent. A 2016 global census estimated the population of wild tigers at approximately 3,890 individuals. <b>Major</b> <b>reasons</b> for population decline include habitat destruction, habitat fragmentation and poaching. The extent of area occupied by tigers is estimated at less than , a 41% decline from the area estimated in the mid-1990s. In 2016, the WWF declared that the world's count of wild tigers has risen for the first time in a century.|$|E
