25|$|The Aviation Systems Division conducts {{research}} and development in two primary areas: air traffic management, and high-fidelity flight simulation. For air traffic management, researchers are creating and testing concepts to allow {{for up to three}} times today's level of aircraft in the national airspace. Automation and its attendant safety consequences are key foundations of the concept development. Historically, the division has developed products that have been implemented for the flying public, such as the Traffic Management Advisor, which is being deployed nationwide. For high-fidelity flight simulation, the division operates the world's largest flight simulator (the Vertical <b>Motion</b> <b>Simulator),</b> a Level-D 747-400 simulator, and a panoramic air traffic control tower simulator. These simulators have been used for a variety of purposes including continued training for space shuttle pilots, development of future spacecraft handling qualities, helicopter control system testing, Joint Strike Fighter evaluations, and accident investigations. Personnel in the division have a variety of technical backgrounds, including guidance and control, flight mechanics, flight simulation, and computer science. Customers outside NASA have included the FAA, DOD, DHS, DOT, NTSB, Lockheed Martin, and Boeing.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{response}} to the impossibility of directly using data of the actual road show experiment to the <b>motion</b> simulation of <b>simulators,</b> due to the limited work space of simulators, this paper begins with an attempt to extract the main frequency components of original signals by spectrum analysis and allow the input signal to meet performance requirements by adjusting the phase offset corresponding to the various frequency components. The paper proceeds with the regeneration of the signals capable of reflecting the motion characteristics of the original data and meeting the performance requirements of <b>motion</b> <b>simulators</b> by selecting these phase offsets as the design variables, selecting simulator’s displacement, velocity, and acceleration as the optimization objectives and applying Genetic Algorithm toolbox of Matlab to develop the optimization model. The paper ends with the efforts to check mechanism singularity by calculating the Jacobian matrix condition number of the regenerating signals and thus obtain the regenerating signals compatible with the work space, capable of fulfilling the performance requirements of <b>motion</b> <b>simulators</b> and free of continuous region singularity...|$|R
