In addition to these bonus tracks, is a bonus DVD with footage of A Day to Remember's performance in Ocala, two music videos, as well as behind the scenes footage of recording and commentary on the re-release. The re-release came about after Victory asked the band whether or not {{if they were going}} to do a new album. Commenting about Victory's inquiry about a new album, Woodard [...] "We weren't ready to do it , so they asked if, you know, we were interested in doing a re-release with new artwork and adding some new songs." ...|$|E

Shot in late November 2008 in a SoHo townhouse owned by Beyoncé, the video {{was directed by}} Philip Andelman and features actor Michael Ealy as Beyoncé's love interest. Ealy was happy to work with Beyoncé, as he had loved the song immediately after hearing it. This {{was the second time}} he was asked to star in a video for a song by Beyoncé; the first was [...] "Irreplaceable", which he had refused because he did not appreciate its theme and concept. He had advised Beyoncé: [...] "Call <b>me</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> have a hero role." ...|$|E

500|$|A {{memorial}} service is held on Earth for the fallen {{heroes of the}} Human-Covenant war, during which the Arbiter and Lord Hood briefly exchange words regarding the fallen Master Chief. After the {{memorial service}}, the Arbiter and his Elite brethren depart for their home planet, Sanghelios. Meanwhile, the rear half of the Forward Unto Dawn drifts in unknown space. Cortana drops a distress beacon, but acknowledges it may be many years before they are rescued. The Chief enters cryonic sleep, telling Cortana to [...] "wake <b>me,</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> need me."

500|$|Before {{reaching}} Cyrus, {{the song}} had {{been rejected by}} several country artists. It was eventually picked up by Peter Chelsom, director of Hannah Montana: The Movie, who gave it to Cyrus to record for the film. Chelsom found what would become [...] "The Climb" [...] while visiting Nashville, Tennessee, during a quest to find eleven new songs for Hannah Montana: The Movie. After hearing Alexander's music, Chelsom asked her to submit songs for consideration. Alexander recorded [...] "It's the Climb" [...] on a CD {{and gave it to}} him. Several weeks later, Chelsom called to say that [...] "the song was gonna {{be an integral part of}} the movie". However, he wanted Mabe and Alexander to rework some of the song's content and to change the song from third person to first person. Alexander felt the changes amounted to a [...] "substantial amount of the song" [...] and commented, [...] "For <b>me,</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> change something from third person to first person, it can change the whole meaning of a line." [...] She and Mabe [...] "wrestl over taking words out" [...] and how much they could change while maintaining the song's integrity. After a number of drafts, Mabe and Alexander finally created a version they felt was [...] "perfect for the movie".|$|E
500|$|Lansky was {{disappointed}} with the track, and wrote in his Idolator article that [...] "Aura" [...] consisted of all [...] "the best and worst things about Lady Gaga amplified"; it was [...] "weird and frustrating and great and terrible and brilliant and a failure all at once". Umema Aimem of The Washington Post criticized the song's lyrics: [...] "The song actually started out well ... but then you lost <b>me</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> proceeded to turn such a sacred symbol of [...] into an exotic costume". Mark Hogan of Spin called it [...] "a grasping EDM mess" [...] and [...] "all over the place"; he disliked the burqa lyrics, [...] "along with plenty of moments that bring to mind all the 'blog house' producers following {{in the path of}} Crystal Castles or Simian Mobile Disco circa 2007". Max Kessler of Paper gave [...] "Aura" [...] a lukewarm review; the song had [...] "all the classic Gaga attributes", including [...] "controversial and mildly clever lyrics set to a throbbing, almost-grating dance beat that's at times great and at times horrible". Its lyrics were controversial, with some Muslims accusing Gaga of degrading the burqa by sexualizing it. According to Aimem, [...] "Auras lyrics imply that women want to flirt with men; this contradicts Gaga's previous song, [...] "Monster", in which she condemns date rape.|$|E

500|$|In January 2012, Preston North End {{asked for}} {{permission}} to speak to Westley with the view to employing him as their new manager. Though the Hertfordshire club described the approach as [...] "unwelcome", permission was granted. After personal terms and a compensation package were agreed, Westley was announced as Preston's new manager on 13 January. His first game {{in charge of the}} club was a 2–0 home defeat against Leyton Orient on 21 January. After the game, it was revealed that Westley had told players the starting line-up for the game courtesy of a 2am text message {{on the day of the}} match. He picked up his first win as Preston manager in his fourth game in charge, securing a 1–0 home victory over Hartlepool United on 14 February 2012. Following Preston's 2–0 televised defeat to Sheffield Wednesday in March 2012, Westley stated that a Sheffield Wednesday player had informed him that four Preston players had leaked the Preston team and tactics to opposition players ahead of the match. Westley stated [...] "It doesn't surprise <b>me.</b> <b>When</b> <b>you</b> have got people in your own camp working against you it is tough". Preston won just two games out of the next 17 during the remainder of the campaign, and finished the season in 15th place. At the end of the season, Westley criticised the club's [...] "mediocre" [...] mentality, stating the squad have [...] "not got a clue what it takes to get success".|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, {{the song}} is about a brokenhearted man who moves on from his past. A Rolling Stone {{reviewer}} called the song a [...] "breakup aria". According to Caroline Sullivan of The Guardian, [...] "Cry Me a River" [...] stands out for its [...] "slow-building sense of drama", which highlights Timberlake at his [...] "husky best". The song begins with the phrase [...] "You were my sun, you were my earth", which according to Timbaland was Timberlake's inspiration to write the song. Tanya L. Edwards of MTV News observed that Timberlake was wronged and said this is demonstrated by the lyrics: [...] "You don't have to say whatcha did / I already know, I found out from him / Now there's just no chance." [...] The chorus contains the lines: [...] "Told me you loved me, {{why did you leave}} me all alone / Now you tell me you need <b>me</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> call me on the phone." [...] Slant Magazines Sal Cinquemani called Timberlake's 2007 single [...] "What Goes Around... Comes Around" [...] an ostensible sequel to [...] "Cry Me a River" [...] both lyrically and musically. Jason Lipshutz of Billboard stated that aside from the presence of Timbaland's [...] "fantastically cluttered production", the difference between [...] "Cry Me a River" [...] and Timberlake's 2013 single [...] "Mirrors" [...] is clear: [...] "10 years ago, Timberlake was broken, and now he is whole".|$|E
500|$|Back on Earth, the Master Chief {{helps to}} repel hostile Covenant forces from Mombasa, Kenya and Voi. With the Arbiter (a Covenant Elite who has sided with humanity) and fellow allies, the Chief leads {{the assault on}} a Forerunner {{artifact}} that the Covenant Prophet of Truth is attempting to activate. Soon after Truth escapes Earth through the slipspace portal opened by the artifact, the Flood lands on Earth. After helping to control the infestation, the Master Chief follows Truth to the Ark, an immense constructed world more than 262,144light-years {{from the center of}} the Milky Way galaxy and well beyond the range of any Halo. There, all the Halos can be remotely activated, thus killing all sentient life that could be infested by the Flood. It is discovered that a new Halo is being constructed to replace the one that the Master Chief destroyed in Halo: Combat Evolved. The Flood follow the Chief to the Ark, bringing High Charity through the slipspace portal to escape the range of the six original Halos. The allied Elites and humans decide to activate the new Halo in order to kill the Flood outside the galaxy, and thus preserve life there. 343 Guilty Spark opposes the premature activation of the incomplete installation and attempts to stop it. Master Chief destroys him, activates the ring, and escapes with Cortana and the Arbiter on the UNSC frigate Forward Unto Dawn. During the escape, the collapsing slipspace portal severs the Dawn in two, stranding Cortana and the Master Chief deep in space. While the Arbiter returns to Earth, Cortana activates a distress beacon, knowing that rescue could take years; the Master Chief enters cryonic sleep, telling Cortana, [...] "Wake <b>me,</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> need me." [...] If the player finishes the last level on Legendary difficulty, a cutscene shows the severed half of the ship floating near an unknown planet.|$|E

An engraving complete with his portrait states that one can see the departed Christ by looking at Christel's forehead, meaning his eyes. A portrait of him now in the Moravian Archives in Herrnhut, Germany, includes the words Gebrochne Augen(broken eyes), again referring to seeing Christ at the moment of death in Christian's eyes, or at the moment of his completed sacrifice.|$|E
