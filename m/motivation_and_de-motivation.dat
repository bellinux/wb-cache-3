40|$|The study {{attempted}} to identify factors affecting {{and assess the}} level of motivation of employees working at KFC UK ltd. The study was carried out based on both primary and secondary data.   With a view to collect primary data, a structured questionnaire, mostly closed styled, was provided to 70 employees of three KFC’s food shop located at London.  The study identified six broad categories of motivation factors such as (1) work itself and environment, (2) supervisor relations, (3) company itself and matters, (4) recognition, (5) development and growth and finally (6) pay and benefits.  The study finds that non-financial factors have a significantly higher impact on the employee’s motivation than the financial factors. Moreover, there are identical sources of <b>motivation</b> <b>and</b> <b>de-motivation,</b> however, the extent of motivation provided by a factor {{is not the same}} extent of de-motivation for that factor i. e. the same factors have an effect on <b>motivation</b> <b>and</b> <b>de-motivation</b> of employees in different extent and manner.  Finally, the study concluded that the employees working at KFC UK ltd are adequately motivated, though a significant difference of level of motivation was noticed among gender, different age groups, working status, working position and length of employment comparison.   </p...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This {{exploratory}} study of IT project teams in Sweden and Ireland investigates how three agile practices, namely daily stand-ups, iteration planning and iteration retrospectives, contribute to motivation or de-motivation in an agile team. Several studies recognise that motivating staff {{is critically important}} for a project manager and have identified factors that motivate IT project staff in particular. Yet relatively {{little is known about}} motivation in an agile context and in particular how an IT project manager may use agile practices to improve team motivation. Seventeen individuals across two teams were interviewed, including both project managers and their staff. The results from both cases indicate that agile practices can contribute to team <b>motivation</b> <b>and</b> <b>de-motivation.</b> This study makes an important contribution in the area of motivation and agile project management by identifying factors that contribute to and inhibit motivation in agile IT project teams. It also makes a contribution to the existing literature by identifying additional factors that motivate and de-motivate IT developers, namely increased visibility and transparency on the progression of tasks, {{an increase in the number}} of meetings, lengthy meetings, use of agile practices on long-term projects and use of agile practices for complex or fragmented tasks...|$|E
40|$|The view of {{software}} testing has, over the years, {{evolved into a}} constructive one. However, while testing has received an increased focus in the software engineering field, the literature has predominantly focused on new technologies and new methods for testing and little on how testing is conducted in real-world projects. Many of the problems encountered in testing are related to both work and organisation, and improving software testing {{should be seen as}} a sociotechnical challenge. This thesis aims to shed light on how software testers are organized within the companies and how they can be motivated in their work. We explored the policies and rules conceptualized and implemented in software development projects and searched for the most desirable set of traits and skills. We wanted to see when the perceptions {{of software}} testing are formed and how they evolve during the educational and professional years. We hope that the results of this thesis will contribute to the body of knowledge regarding testing research in an industrial setting. This overall purpose will more specifically be pursued through the following three research questions: - RQ 1 : Which contextual factors are salient in situations that can generate strong motivation for software testers? - RQ 2 : How is the motivation of software testers encouraged in practice? - RQ 3 : How does working experience in industry contribute to the perception of testing activities' importance? In this research we have used a mix of quantitative and qualitative data analysis. The quantitative data were used to construct an overview of the internal organization of testing activities and for analysing the results from alumni survey data sets. Qualitative data have been used to understand and explore the many factors we observed during the stages with focus on motivation and characteristics of testing professionals. The main contributions are: C 1. Identification of challenges encountered by testers, managers and developers during software testing activities. C 2. A classification framework for organizing and managing testing personnel. C 3. A description of factors that motivate software testing personnel as well as strategies deployed by the companies for stimulating their testers. New motivational and de-motivational factors were identified within testing context. C 4. A set of skills and characteristics considered suitable or desirable when hiring software testers. C 5. A multi-faceted perspective of the perception of a testing career among students and graduates as well as factors influencing the students in pursuing a software testing career. This thesis offers insight into how organizations decided and adopted a guideline for testing activities. Furthermore, the research provides a comprehensive description of factors that influence the software testing personnel and a new set of <b>motivation</b> <b>and</b> <b>de-motivation</b> factors were introduced. In addition, a multi-faceted perspective of perception of the testing career among students and graduates emerged. Lastly, the results improve our understanding of the mechanisms influencing the students for pursuing a testing career...|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{submitted}} in partial {{fulfillment of the}} requirements for the degree of Masters of Arts in Governance and Development, 2013. Cataloged from PDF version of thesis. Includes bibliographical references (page 65 - 67). In the context of strikingly limited research on the causes of inefficiency of civil servants and the motivational status of public officials in Bangladesh, the main objectives {{of this study are}} to identify and trace the factors (as well as their manifestations) which influence the motivational level of the district level civil servants. The relevant literature was reviewed to develop an analytical framework and selected theories of motivation and job dissatisfaction, job satisfaction (especially content and process theories) were applied to analyses the collected data for this study. In this research de-motivating factors and motivational status of the civil service were measured by twelve independent variables i. e. (1) Inadequate salary, (2) Lack of standardization in promotion system, (3) Lack of standardization in posting, (4) Lack of effective career planning, (5) Inadequate emphasis on innovation, (6) Lack of political commitment and long term vision regarding civil service, (7) Unsupportive working environment, (8) Negative political pressure, (9) Lack of subject specific training, (10) Nepotism, (11) Partisan influence and (12) Lack of integrity. Primary and secondary data were used for the study. Primary data were collected through a survey with formal questionnaire. The secondary data were gathered from journals, books, reports, etc. The level of <b>motivation</b> <b>and</b> <b>de-motivation</b> was measured by a structured questionnaire. The Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) tools was used for data analysis. The results of the study indicate that the civil servants, who are now working at the District level, are moderately de-motivated. The most important factors responsible for de-motivating district level civil servants are inadequate salary, lack of standardization in promotion system, lack of standardization in posting system, lack of effective career planning, inadequate emphasis on innovation and lack of political commitment and long term vision regarding civil service. This study also showed that the factors negative political pressure and nepotism have a strong significant relationship with the overall de-motivation of district level civil servants in Bangladesh. One interesting and encouraging findings is that all respondents noted that they were motivated by such factors to join the civil service as desire to serve the people, prestigious job, job security, social status of the job rather than to earn money. Moreover, most of the respondents opined that nepotism and negative political pressure were xvi significantly responsible for inefficiency of civil service and because of these factors the civil servants often could not take any free and faire decision. The results of this study provide an insight into the broader picture of the motivational status of civil servants working at the district level in Bangladesh and may assist the relevant policy formulation process towards enhancing staff motivation which in turn may improve civil officials’ efficiency as well as service delivery. Further research is needed especially to investigate into the potential relationships and effects of the variables studied in this research and other extraneous variables. Roksana RahmanM.

In order to address this issue, it is necessary to determine the instructional methods that promote <b>motivation</b> <b>and</b> identity development in reading. This study examines the <b>motivation</b> <b>and</b> the identity development of four fourth grade students as they experienced the reading workshop over the course of one year. Ford’s Motivational Systems Theory and Wenger’s Theory of Learning frame the study of student <b>motivation</b> <b>and</b> identity development within the reading workshop. Data related to <b>motivation</b> <b>and</b> identity development was collected weekly through student interviews, surveys, and conferences. A description of the context was gained through researcher observations and a teacher interview. Analysis of this data revealed that (1) Increased time spent reading self- selected books correlates positively to student <b>motivation</b> <b>and</b> identity development. (2) Increased responsive feedback from teachers and peers is correlated with increased <b>motivation</b> <b>and</b> reading identity development. (3) These elements form the crux of the reading workshop, which supports the notion that this model of instruction encourages <b>motivation</b> <b>and</b> identity development. (4) The correlation between <b>motivation,</b> identity development, <b>and</b> achievement is not evident {{in the context of this}} study. However, this correlation often emerges over time.

Recent {{research has shown that}} self-regulation <b>and</b> <b>motivation</b> overlap <b>and</b> both predict academic achievement (Berhenke, Lan, & Morrison, 2009). The present studies focus on how <b>motivation</b> <b>and</b> self-regulation are related, how they predict learning in preschool, and teachers’ attributions about students’ behavior when children are struggling academically. When children fail to complete learning activities {{it can be hard to}} determine the relative influence of <b>motivation</b> <b>and</b> self-regulation, because children can be uninterested, frustrated, distracted, or have simply forgotten or lack the necessary skills. Helping teachers understand the dynamic interplay between <b>motivation</b> <b>and</b> self-regulatory skills would be especially important for teachers’ ability to aid struggling preschool students. Accordingly, the present study addressed the following questions: •	What is the relation between self-regulation <b>and</b> <b>motivation</b> in preschool children? •	When children fail to persist at challenging tasks, can we tell whether they lack motivation or self-regulation? •	Which components of self-regulation <b>and</b> <b>motivation</b> best predict student learning in preschool? •	How do teachers identify student struggles with self-regulation <b>and</b> <b>motivation?</b> •	How do they differentiate between these concepts? •	How do teachers choose courses of intervention for issues identified as motivational problems versus self-regulatory problems? One hundred forty children ages 3 - 5 were assessed using teacher reports, group tasks, and individual assessments of <b>motivation,</b> self-regulation, <b>and</b> achievement. Results revealed that <b>motivation</b> <b>and</b> self-regulation are distinct, related constructs. Persistence is likely the product of motivational beliefs <b>and</b> self-regulatory skills. <b>Motivation</b> predicted growth in children’s reading skills during preschool, whereas both <b>motivation</b> <b>and</b> self-regulation predicted growth in math skills. Teacher reports of children’s <b>motivation</b> <b>and</b> self-regulation did not predict academic growth. Finally, teachers reported using atheoretical, largely intrinsic conceptions of children’s <b>motivation</b> <b>and</b> ideas about self-regulation that included both cognitive skills and emotion regulation.

This was a correlational research and conducted upon {{high school student}} at SMA Negeri 1 Cawas in academic year in 2011 / 2012. The sample was taken among 100 samples of student using stratified random sampling technique. Documentation technique was used to uncover student’s cognitive learning achievement, while internal <b>motivation</b> <b>and</b> learning readiness was measured by using queationnaire. The obtained data was analysed using path analysis in SPSS 16. The result showed that (1) there is causal corellation between internal <b>motivation</b> <b>and</b> cognitive learning achievement in learning Biology, 2) there is causal corellation between internal <b>motivation</b> <b>and</b> learning readiness in learning Biology, 3) there is causal corellation between learning readiness and cognitive learning achievement in learning Biology, 4) there is causal corellation between internal <b>motivation</b> <b>and</b> cognitive learning achievement through learning readiness in learning Biology. The aforementioned corellation are considured as significant and positive valuable. This research showed that learning readiness can be a intervening variable for the corellation between of internal <b>motivation</b> <b>and</b> cognitive learning achievement. Key Words: internal motivation, learning readiness, cognitive learning achievement of biology, path analysi...|$|R

The present study argues that {{a high level of}} organizational commitment in prosocial employees is predicted by bipartite synergy between employees&# 039; prosocial <b>motivations</b> <b>and</b> their supervisors&# 039; prosocial motivations, between employees&# 039; prosocial <b>motivations</b> <b>and</b> their organizations&# 039; prosocial orientations, and tripartite synergy among all three. Polynomial regressions and hierarchical regression analyses are undertaken on data collected from a sample of 216 full-time employees in China. The results show that perceived fit between employees and supervisors&# 039; prosocial motivations (i. e., person-supervisor [PS] fit) is positively related to employees&# 039; organizational commitment (i. e., there is bipartite synergy between employees and supervisors&# 039; prosocial motivations). Perceived corporate social responsibility (CSR) moderates the relationship between employees&# 039; prosocial <b>motivations</b> <b>and</b> their organizational commitment such that when employees&# 039; prosocial <b>motivations</b> <b>and</b> perceived CSR are both high (as opposed to when either or both are low), their organizational commitment is stronger (i. e., there is bipartite synergy between employees&# 039; prosocial <b>motivations</b> <b>and</b> CSR). Furthermore, perceived CSR moderates the relationship between PS fit in relation to prosocial <b>motivations</b> <b>and</b> organizational commitment. Notably, organizational commitment is strongest when there is a strong alignment among employees&# 039; prosocial motivations, supervisors&# 039; prosocial <b>motivations,</b> <b>and</b> CSR (i. e., there is tripartite synergy among employees&# 039; prosocial motivations, supervisors&# 039; prosocial <b>motivations,</b> <b>and</b> CSR). The theoretical contributions and practical implications of this study are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Two studies {{investigated}} {{the importance of}} initial topic interest (i. e., expectation of interest) and tutors’ autonomy-supportive or controlling instructional styles for students’ <b>motivation</b> <b>and</b> performance in problem-based learning (PBL). In Study 1 (N = 93, a lab experiment), each student participated in a simulated group discussion in which tutor instructions were manipulated to be autonomy supportive, internally controlling, or externally controlling. Controlling tutor instructions led to higher controlled motivation, but autonomy-supportive instructions did not relate to students’ autonomous <b>motivation</b> <b>and</b> performance measures. Higher topic interest resulted in higher autonomous <b>motivation</b> <b>and</b> contributed indirectly to more self-study time and persistence. Self-study time was in turn associated with better test performance. A field study (N = 287, Study 2) supported the findings of Study 1. Tutor-provided autonomy support was unrelated to autonomous motivation, while a controlling instructional style led to higher controlled <b>motivation</b> <b>and</b> negatively affected performance. Again, topic interest positively influenced autonomous <b>motivation</b> <b>and</b> subsequent performance. Both studies demonstrate the importance of students’ initial topic interest for subsequent performance in PBL. Results also indicate that in PBL, tutor-provided autonomy support does not improve autonomous <b>motivation</b> <b>and</b> performance, whereas controlling tutoring can promote controlled <b>motivation</b> <b>and</b> hamper performance. Implications and further research opportunities are discussed...|$|R
