5|$|Glover {{believes}} Martha influenced Lionel {{to start}} believing that sacrifice {{is necessary to}} <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>a</b> better place. When she leaves {{at the end of}} season six, Lionel no longer has that influence. He is constantly battling the dark and light sides of his personality. According to series writer Caroline Dries, the audience never really know his motivations because of this balancing act. Dries said this is embodied when he threatens Lana into marrying Lex, later revealing it was to protect Clark. Glover describes his off-screen relationship with Annette O'Toole the reason Martha and Lionel have such good chemistry. Glover said that when Martha and Lionel are talking to each other it feels as though he and O'Toole are sharing a conversation, and that trust is visualized on the camera.|$|E

[...] "Dirty Diana" [...] was viewed by AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine as [...] "misogynistic" [...] and its lyrics, describing a sexual predator, do not aim for the [...] "darkness" [...] of [...] "Billie Jean", instead sounding equally intrigued by and apprehensive of a sexual challenge, while having the opportunity to accept or resist it. [...] "Leave Me Alone" [...] was described as being a [...] "paranoid anthem".

After Michael Jackson's death, it was modified to include a medley of three Michael Jackson songs, as an homage to the recently deceased singer. The performance featured Madonna's dancer Kento, who danced in similar clothing and dancing style as Jackson. Madonna's 1985 single [...] "Dress You Up" [...] replaced the rock version of [...] "Borderline". It featured elements of rock songs like [...] "My Sharona" [...] by The Knack and [...] "God Save The Queen" [...] by Sex Pistols. [...] "Hung Up" [...] was removed and replaced by an up-beat version of [...] "Frozen" [...] with interpolations from [...] "Open Your Heart", which was set between [...] "Like a Prayer" [...] and [...] "Ray of Light". The video backdrop for [...] "Frozen" [...] used video outtakes from the song's music video, directed by Chris Cunningham.

Even during Japan’s draconian Edo period (1600 – 1867) when the state’s temple registration system effectively shackled communities to their local temples, a priest’s role expanded to include the resolution of disputes, the distribution of shared resources, compliance with governmental edicts, shelter to victims of domestic violence, permission to travel, and so on (see Covell 2005 : 95 – 108). Later, after the Meiji revolution (1866 – 68) ended feudalism and embarked on rapid modernization from 1870 onward, temples representing several denominations reorganized along state mandates and provided schools, day-care facilities, orphanages, clinics, and so on for people of all social classes.|$|R
