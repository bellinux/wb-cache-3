Why can't people like me for me?" ...|$|E
2500|$|You gotta realize that, out of {{the whole}} cast, nobody was over thirty. Diane Lane was, I think, eighteen. It was an {{enormous}} Hollywood production. My manager had me hire a limousine to pick <b>me</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> home and take me to work. I was like, [...] "Jesus, this is incredible. This is... Hollywood. The real Hollywood. The Hollywood they make movies about."... It was scary. And Walter isn't {{the kind of guy}} who works well with kids. He's a cowboy. He's like John Ford. [...] "Don't ask me how to act!

2500|$|Throughout the song, Beyoncé sings with [...] "a sassy attitude", {{setting a}} [...] "futuristic tone", {{as stated by}} Jocelyn Vena. According to Dombal, [...] "Countdown" [...] finds Knowles as the female protagonist {{delivering}} her [...] "message of ten years of loyalty" [...] to her love interest. Jody Rosen of Rolling Stone, who described [...] "Countdown" [...] as a [...] "monogamous romance", added {{that it is a}} love song that is [...] "no less sexy for being unblinkingly true to life", and Jocelyn Vena of MTV News wrote that the song is [...] "all about the rapture of true love". Kicking off with a reggae-ish beat, horns and drums, Knowles starts to chant the introductory lines, which also serves as the pre-chorus lines, [...] "Oh, killing me softly and I'm still falling / Still the one I need, I will always be with you / Oh, you got me all gone, don't ever let me go / Say it real loud if you fly / If you leave me you're out of your mind", followed by the chorus lines, which is a literal count backwards where Knowles counts down the ways in which she loves her man, [...] "My baby is a ten / We dressing to the nine / He pick <b>me</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> eight / Make me feel so lucky seven / He kiss me in his six / We be making love in five / Still the one I do this four / I’m trying to make a three / From that two / He still the one." ...|$|E

60|$|I was not expected, for {{she left}} me locked in the yard, while she went to ask if I were to be admitted. After a very short delay, she {{returned}} and took <b>me</b> <b>up,</b> staring <b>at</b> <b>me</b> all the way.|$|R
60|$|I {{never found}} out what was the dodge that Tom, in his wisdom, was to have put <b>me</b> <b>up</b> to, for <b>at</b> that moment the captain came on deck, and gave orders to furl the top-gallant sails.|$|R

6000|$|... "It's a sure thing," [...] {{the young}} man declared. [...] "I've been to the {{landlord}} of the flat, and he gave <b>me</b> <b>up</b> the keys <b>at</b> once. There's only one quarter's rent owing. Pretty stiff though--isn't it? Fifty pounds!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Did {{you call}} <b>me</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> one {{o'clock in the}} morning to ask silly questions?" [...] the man replied insolently. [...] "Every one's in bed here and I was just going." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Thank you {{for your}} hail as you passed us, Miss Greendale. It sounded hearty, and really cheered <b>me</b> <b>up,</b> for just <b>at</b> the moment I was in an {{exceedingly}} bad temper, I can assure you. You see, my forebodings came true, and luck was against me." ...|$|R
