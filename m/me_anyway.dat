25|$|I {{always had}} the feeling that no one {{understood}} <b>me</b> <b>anyway,</b> that no one knew who I was and what made me do this or that. And you know, when no one understands you, no one can call you to account. Not even the court could call me to account. But the dead can. They understand. They don't even have to have been there, but if they do, they understand even better. Here in prison they were with me a lot. They came every night, whether I wanted them to or not. Before the trial I could still chase them away when they wanted to come.|$|E
25|$|Jim Wyatt, of the Tennesseean, {{reports that}} Ringer is the {{favorite}} for the 3rd string job, and almost a lock to make the roster. Fullback Ahmard Hall said “He’s a character guy, and you could tell that from the start, He’s the total package. You rarely get that combination of humility and natural athletic ability and I think he has that great combination. You combine those two and you get someone who could be unstoppable.’’ Of all the praise, Ringer responded, “I have to give credit to how I was brought up. I {{grew up in a}} religious family and I know without God none of this would be possible for <b>me</b> <b>anyway,</b> so that definitely keeps me humble. My personality is not to boast and brag about the accomplishments and things I am trying to do. Actions speak louder than words and that is what I try and strive for.’’ In a 17-23 loss to the Cleveland Browns, Ringer only had one run for two yards. Ringer finished off the pre-season with a 7 carry 18 yard performance, in a 27-13 win over the Green Bay Packers.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Spin, Williams stated [...] "'Still Into You' is definitely a love song. It's definitely happy. But to <b>me</b> <b>anyway</b> — and obviously I wrote it so maybe I'm biased, but — it's not a sappy love song. ... We've never done that before, and honestly I don't {{have a whole lot}} of experience writing love songs, or anyways lyrics that are like this." ...|$|E

2500|$|One {{reviewer}} {{observed that}} Amos's unfettered creativity due to serving {{as her own}} producer cost the album its accessibility. Amos has stated that her goal was not to make radio-friendly music with universal lyrics, {{and went on to}} say that [...] "a song is only part lyrics and, for <b>me</b> <b>anyway,</b> more than 50% music, easy. There's so much subtext in the music that's part of the story." ...|$|E
2500|$|Tolkien {{wrote in}} one of his letters: [...] "what I think is a primary ‘fact’ about my work, that it is all of a piece, and {{fundamentally}} linguistic in inspiration. [...] It is not a ‘hobby’, in the sense of something quite different from one’s work, taken up as a relief-outlet. The invention of languages is the foundation. The ‘stories’ were made rather to provide a world for the languages than the reverse. To me a name comes ﬁrst and the story follows. I should have preferred to write in ‘Elvish’. But, of course, such a work as The Lord of the Rings has been edited and only as much ‘language’ has been left in as I thought would be stomached by readers. (I now ﬁnd that many would have liked more.) [...] It is to <b>me,</b> <b>anyway,</b> largely an essay in ‘linguistic aesthetic’, as I sometimes say to people who ask me ‘what is it all about’." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Duane, a {{word with}} you," [...] he said. [...] "I believe you're not so black as you've been painted. I wish there was time to say more. Tell <b>me</b> this, <b>anyway.</b> Do you know the Ranger Captain MacNelly?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm darned if I {{know what}} to do with you. Well, you'd better come home with <b>me</b> now, <b>anyway,</b> and meet your aunt, and then we can talk things over. After all, the main thing is to keep you out of mischief." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's about it!" [...] {{the guide}} broke in. [...] "This lady {{has made a}} journey that would have killed some men--it has pretty well used <b>me</b> up, <b>anyway.</b> I'll {{sit down in the}} corner if you don't mind. Can't keep myself right end up much longer." ...|$|R
2500|$|Byrne joined Claremont {{beginning}} with The X-Men #108 (Dec. 1977). Their work together, along with inker Terry Austin, on such classic story arcs as [...] "Proteus", [...] "Dark Phoenix Saga", and [...] "Days of Future Past" [...] {{would make them}} both fan favorites. Byrne insisted that the title keep its Canadian character, Wolverine, and contributed a series of story elements to justify Wolverine's presence which eventually made the character {{among the most popular}} in Marvel's publishing history. With issue #114, Byrne began co-plotting the series as well as penciling. Claremont recounted that [...] "at that point in time John and I were, in a very real sense, true collaborators on the book. It was with very few exceptions, difficult, for <b>me,</b> <b>anyway,</b> to tell in the actual gestation of the book where one of us left off and the other began - because it involved one of us coming up with an idea and bouncing it off the other ..." [...] The [...] "Dark Phoenix Saga" [...] in 1980 {{is one of the most}} notable stories in the title's history. Comics writers and historians Roy Thomas and Peter Sanderson observed that [...] "'The Dark Phoenix Saga' is to Claremont and Byrne what the 'Galactus Trilogy' is to Stan Lee and Jack Kirby. It is a landmark in Marvel history, showcasing its creators' work at the height of their abilities." [...] Byrne has repeatedly compared his working relationship with Claremont to Gilbert and Sullivan, and has said that they were [...] "almost constantly at war over who the characters were." [...] Byrne created the characters Alpha Flight, Proteus, and Kitty Pryde/Shadowcat during his run on The X-Men. A new Brotherhood of Evil Mutants, led by Mystique, was introduced in the [...] "Days of Future Past" [...] storyline (#141-142, Jan.-Feb. 1981) in which a time-travelling Kitty Pryde tried to avert a dystopian future caused by the Brotherhood assassinating Presidential candidate Senator Robert Kelly. Byrne plotted the story wanting to depict the Sentinels as a genuine threat to the existence of the mutant race. Byrne left The X-Men with #143 (March 1981). During his tenure on the series, The X-Men was promoted from a bimonthly to a monthly publication schedule, with a steady sales incline that continued long after Byrne left.|$|E

5000|$|The single [...] "No Mule's Fool", Family's {{first single}} with Weider as a band member, took the band {{in a country}} rock direction.

5000|$|The album has {{influenced}} {{a wide variety}} of musicians, among them Regina Spektor, Bombay Bicycle Club, Gabby Young, Casiokids, The Very Best, Givers, and Vampire Weekend. The latter faced particular criticism that their 2008 debut album was too similar to Graceland, due to its origins in African music. Simon later defended the band, remarking, [...] "In a way, we were on the same pursuit, but I don't think you're lifting from <b>me,</b> and <b>anyway,</b> you're welcome to it, because everybody's lifting all the time. That's the way music grows and is shaped." ...|$|R

5000|$|On April 7, 2016, Dunkleman {{appeared}} on the American Idol fifteenth season and series finale. In an interview following the show, Dunkleman said [...] "I think I beat them to the punch and I didn't know. I left the show but from what I gather, they weren't going to have <b>me</b> back <b>anyway.</b> So it's kind of a big load off my shoulders. I guess I didn't make a mistake.

5000|$|Pryor {{later said}} he [...] "got {{personally}} and professionally f__cked on that film. They fired {{the director and}} hired another ego.

5000|$|On terrorism, Martin Amis {{wrote that}} he {{suspected}} [...] "there exists on our planet a kind of human being who will become a Muslim in order to pursue suicide-mass murder", and added: [...] "I {{will never forget the}} look on the gatekeeper's face, at the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem, when I suggested, perhaps rather airily, that he skip some calendric prohibition and let <b>me</b> in <b>anyway.</b> His expression, previously cordial and cold, became a mask; and the mask was saying that killing me, my wife, and my children was something for which he now had warrant." ...|$|R

2500|$|In 1959, Paige's {{mother told}} a {{reporter}} that he was 55 rather than 53, saying she knew this because she wrote it down in her Bible.
