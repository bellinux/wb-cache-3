5000|$|In California the Z-Spar {{line was}} coming to life. Andrew Brown had been {{involved}} in a joint venture with his brother, specializing in automotive and home paint. With operations out of both California and Argentina, the pair discovered that working as a joint union was too difficult. After breaking away from the business with his brother, Brown was ready to tackle a new market on his own. In 1948, Brown introduced a line of <b>marine</b> <b>paint</b> known as Z-Spar. After a successful run with the product, Z-Spar was sold to a company called Koppers. Shortly after Z-Spar joined Koppers, they would purchase the Woolsey line, merging the two companies under one name. Pettit <b>Marine</b> <b>Paint</b> was established in 1972, after the unification of three lines of <b>marine</b> <b>paint</b> manufactures - Pettit, Woolsey, and Z-Spar.|$|E

50|$|Medetomidine {{can be used}} as an {{antifouling}} {{substance in}} <b>marine</b> <b>paint.</b> It is mainly effective against barnacles, but has also shown effect on other hard fouling like tube worms. When the barnacle cyprid larva encounters a surface containing medetomidine the molecule interacts with the octopamine receptor in the larva. This makes the larva legs start kicking and it cannot settle to the painted surface. When the larva swims away from the surface, the effect disappears (reversible effect). The larva regain its function and can settle somewhere else.|$|E

A complex using copper has been prepared and its desorption characteristics have been studied. The slow release of copper is of potential use in anti-fouling paints and therefore the desorption of copper has been studied under various environmental conditions. Desorption rates were high in distilled water but low in sea water, and after further comparative tests with commercial marine paints, it was concluded that copper-chitosan complexes are not as effective as the cuprous oxide anti-fouling agent currently used in <b>marine</b> <b>paint</b> formulations...|$|E
40|$|Tributyltin {{chloride}} and its {{degradation products}} monobutyltin and dibutyltin act as water pollutants, {{owing to the}} use of tributyltin chloride as a biocide in <b>marine</b> <b>paint</b> formulations. These compounds are lipid-soluble and undergo bioaccumulation and bioconcentration. Salmo irideus trout erythrocytes were studied to evaluate the possible effects of these compounds on freshwater fish, which could be exposed to long-term effects due to bioaccumulation or organotins. Data showed that tributyltin increases the haemolysis rate, starting at 10 mu M, while dibutyltin has a scant protective effect at each concentration tested. Similar studies were performed in the presence of carbon monoxide (CO), which is protecting against membrane oxidation. In these conditions all the organotins tested induced an increase in the haemolysis rate. These results suggest that the consequence of auto-oxidation of Hb could condition the effects of some organotin compounds. Steady-state fluorescence of probes embedded in the lipidic part of the membrane was used to evaluate the modifications induced by organotins to the physico-chemical state of phospholipids...|$|E
40|$|After the ban of TBT-based products, <b>marine</b> <b>paint</b> {{companies}} {{are urged to}} find an appropriate substitute to prevent biofouling on ship hulls. Biocides commonly used in antifouling paints to replace TBT have caused many doubts about their environmental effects. An alternative is offered {{by the development of}} antifouling coatings in which the active ingredients are compounds naturally occurring in marine organisms. Many recent studies confirm a potential for novel active ingredients in antifouling preparations from crude extracts of marine algae. We have shown in our studies that the extracts from Ceramium botryocarpum have an interesting antimicrofouling activity, in comparison with commonly used biocides. In situ tests have been conducted during July and August 2004 in the harbour of Lorient, and the first results of crude extracts incorporated in coatings are promising. The chemical characterization of the extracts is in progress. Further work is now needed to examine the precise role of such antifouling activity in nature, and to determine the specific antimicrobial activity against marine bacteria implicated in biofilms...|$|E

40|$|EnThe {{antifouling}} {{activity of}} crude extracts of 5 common Red Sea soft corals was examined. The extracts were {{mixed with a}} <b>marine</b> <b>paint,</b> applied to PVC panels immersed in the seawater of Suez Bay (Red Sea). The barnacle Balanus amphitrite (Crustacea) and tube worms Hydroides elegans (Polychaeta) are the dominant fouling organisms in this area. The results demonstrated that all the tested soft coral extracts exhibited significant antifouling activities with varying degrees. Extracts of Sinularia heterospiculata and Sinularia variabilis showed the highest and potent wide spectrum antifouling activity, particularly in the first 17 days of fouling formation. Extracts of Sinularia polydactyla exhibited significant selective inhibition against settlement of barnacle, while the extracts of Lithophyton arboreum showed significant antifouling activity against the latter successional stages of tube worms. The {{results of the current}} study propose that these soft corals may contain bioactive compounds with antifouling activity.

40|$|The paper {{analyzes}} {{the performance of}} solventborne paint systems applied on carbon steel and hot-dip galvanized steel {{in a wide range}} of atmospheric exposures. The study has involved paint systems exposure for 3. 5 years in eight natural atmospheres. The atmospheric conditions cover from temperate rural climates to tropical severe marine and Antarctic coastal regions. The paint systems included several alkyds formulated with a variety of pigments (anticorrosive and barrier), epoxies, chlorinated rubber, and zinc-rich (ethyl silicate and epoxy). It has been concluded that in rural and urban atmospheres alkyd systems afford equivalent anticorrosive protection of steel to the epoxy/polyurethane system. The toxic red lead pigment may be replaced in long linseed-oil alkyd primer paints by non-toxic pigments, such as a mixture of micaceous iron oxides (MIO) and black iron oxides or zinc phosphate, without affecting the anticorrosive properties of the paint system. In aggressive atmospheres (industrial, <b>marine),</b> <b>paint</b> systems including zinc-rich primers or applied on galvanized steel must be used, especially in surface regions with coating faults (scribes).

This study aimed at determining {{the potential of}} marine biofilm bacteria to produce novel biomolecules with potential application as natural antifoulants. Nine representative strains were isolated {{from a range of}} surfaces and were grown in YEB medium and harvested during the late exponential growth phase. Bacterial biomass and spent culture medium were extracted with ethanol and ethyl acetate, respectively. Extracts were assayed for their antifouling activity using two tests: (1) antimicrobial well diffusion test against a common fouling bacterium, Halomonas marina, and (2) anti-crustacean activity test using Artemia salina. Our results showed that none of the ethanolic extracts (bacterial biomass) were active in either test. In contrast, most of the organic extracts had antimicrobial activity (88 %) and were toxic towards A. salina (67 %). Sequencing of full 16 S ribosomal DNA analysis showed that the isolates were related to Bacillus mojavensis and Bacillus firmus. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) profiling of ethyl acetate extracts of culture supernatants showed that these species produce the bioactive lipopeptides surfactin A, mycosubtilin and bacillomycin D...|$|E
