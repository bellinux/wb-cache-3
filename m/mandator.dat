50|$|In Roman law, the {{mandatary}} {{was not the}} mandator’s representative. Where the <b>mandator</b> concluded {{contracts with}} third parties in executing the mandate, the mandatary did so in his own name {{and not on the}} mandator’s behalf. The rights and duties under such contract were the mandatary’s alone. While the <b>mandator</b> could indirectly acquire rights against the third party by means of cession, he she could not do so directly. The position in modern law is different. The mandate may well include a power to represent the <b>mandator,</b> but it need not do so.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to study the rules {{governing}} the phenomenon of mandatories abusing their powers, under Quebec Civil Code. It also reviews the rules proposed by the Civil Code Revision Office in its 1971 and 1976 Reports on the contract of Mandate and in its 1976 Report on administration of property of others. It shows that on many issues the Office has chosen a rather conservative approach and decided to stick to time-proven rules. It also flags the areas where the Office advocates new rules, with appropriate comments. The article is divided in two parts, the first one dealing with the scope of abuse of powers, the second with its effects. Part one asks « When does a mandatory abuse his powers ? » and answers by distinguishing between the wrongful exercise of mandatory's actual powers and the exercise, right or wrong, of non-existant powers. Part two then asks « What are the effects of abuses of powers ? » and deals on one hand with the liability towards third parties of both <b>mandators</b> and mandatories, and on the other hand with the liability of mandatories towards their <b>mandators.</b> The interest of part one lies mainly with the distinction it makes between two types of abuses of powers and with the analysis of the remarkable contribution of the Report on administration of the property of others into the field of Mandate. Part two derives its interest from the study of rules aimed at protecting third parties against abuses of powers of mandatories, and from testing the relevance of distinguishing between two types of abuses of powers. One conclusion, among others, emerges from this article. <b>Mandators</b> are fully liable towards third parties when mandatories abuse their powers by using them wrongfully. Conversely <b>mandators</b> are not liable when mandatories abuse their powers by using non-existant powers, although this principle suffers exceptions numerous enough to constitute a genuine regime of protections for third parties against self-empowered mandatories. The article suggests however that Quebec Law could go one step further by improving protection of third parties under the existing notion of apparent mandate, especially for those dealing with companies...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{focuses on}} the post mortem mandate, an {{agreement}} used to protect some interests arising after the <b>mandator’s</b> death, both in Italian legal system and in Roman Law. Given that the latest doctrine has considered invalid a post mortem mandate where {{the nature of the}} mandatory’s tasks is economic, as it does not comply with art. 458 Cod. Civ., this article explores the issues suggesting that the recent introduction of the ‘reverse mortgage’ within the Italian legal system could be considered as a new step towards overcoming the prohibition of agreements as to succession. After analysing the current legislation, also within the framework of European private law, the research dwells on post mortem mandatum in Roman law, trying to show that such consensual contract could be considered as a succession agreement. After having demonstrated the difference between the mandatum post mortem (understood as a contract) and other testamentary dispositions defined as mandatum post mortem as well, a source showing the possible economic nature of the Roman mandatum post mortem is considered, to conclude that there were Roman law cases, like that of Gaio in D. 17. 1. 13, proving the existence of bilateral agreements intended to fulfil an economic function casually related to the <b>mandator’s</b> death...|$|R

50|$|Mandate (mandatum or lastgeving) is a {{contract}} {{in which one}} person, the mandatary, undertakes to perform some lawful task for another, the <b>mandator.</b> In Roman-Dutch law, the contract {{was said to be}} essentially gratuitous. If the parties agreed on a payment for the services rendered, the contract was one of letting and hiring of work or services: locatio conductio operis or operarum respectively. It was accepted in practice, however, that the <b>mandator</b> might offer a reward or honorarium, not in payment but in gratitude, for the mandatary's services. There is no objection in modern law to the remuneration of the mandatary, with the result {{that it is difficult to}} distinguish the contract of mandate from that of letting and hiring of work or services.|$|E

5000|$|A major {{scholarly}} {{attack on}} the basis of democracy was made by German-Italian political scientist Robert Michels who developed the mainstream political science theory of the iron law of oligarchy in 1911. Michels argued that oligarchy is inevitable as an [...] "iron law" [...] within any organization as part of the [...] "tactical and technical necessities" [...] of organization and on the topic of democracy, Michels stated: [...] "It is organization which gives birth to the dominion of the elected over the electors, of the mandataries over the <b>mandators,</b> of the delegates over the delegators. Who says organization, says oligarchy" [...] and went on to state [...] "Historical evolution mocks all the prophylactic measures that have been adopted for the prevention of oligarchy." [...] Michels stated that the official goal of democracy of eliminating elite rule was impossible, that democracy is a façade legitimizing the rule of a particular elite, and that elite rule, that he refers to as oligarchy, is inevitable. Michels had formerly been a Marxist but became drawn to the syndicalism of Sorel, Eduoard Berth, Arturo Labriola, and Enrico Leone and had become strongly opposed parliamentarian, legalistic, and bureaucratic socialism of social democracy and in contrast supported an activist, voluntarist, anti-parliamentarian socialism. Michels would later become a supporter of fascism upon Mussolini's rise to power in 1922, viewing fascism's goal to destroy liberal democracy in a sympathetic manner.|$|R
40|$|Our {{paper is}} divided into three sections. First, it was {{necessary}} to contextualize further our study in the various scholarly fields that have touched on issues of leadership and local politics. A second part is a presentation of, and elaboration upon, the concepts within Bourdieu’s work that we found useful to our theorization of community leadership. A third section is illustrating the relevance of this theoretical framework to unpack a complex South African story of local politics. The conclusion debates the relevance of this framework beyond the South African case. In our attempt to unravel the structures, constraints and opportunities under which community leaders operate, we have been inspired, as many before us in different ways, by Bourdieu’s work on political capital, political representation and his analyses of the specificities of the ‘political field’ (Bourdieu, 1991). However, we also feel that his theoretical frames are built on reflections developed at a supra-local scale, in contexts of highly institutionalized or institutionalizing politics (national party apparatuses), and where the politics of informality are not at the center of his observations. We believe our perspectives on the micro-politics of the local in urban societies dominated by informality, and in globalizing and neoliberalizing governance contexts which see the proliferation of governance institutions (private and public, formal and informal, local, national and international) might bring new insights into the understanding of the complex construction of political legitimacies. In particular, we argue that community leaders – being both grounded locally, in close proximity to their constituencies; and in search of institutional recognition (by a party, or a fraction of the state) that might give them less uncertain legitimacy as well as possible access to material resources, need to build their political legitimacies not either from the bottom or from the top, but from both simultaneously. Following Bourdieu’s notion of double dealings (the need for what he calls ’professional politicians’ to fight in the political field {{as well as in the}} social field; for their own political positions and as representatives of their <b>mandators),</b> we then elaborate on instances where the relationships between the two legitimation processes (what we call here legitimation from the ‘bottom’ and from the ‘top’) reinforce one another or contradict one anothe...|$|R

5000|$|Related to Mosca's {{theory of}} {{domination}} of society by an organized minority over a disorganized majority, was Robert Michels' {{theory of the}} iron law of oligarchy {{that has become a}} mainstream political theory.

Nonetheless, both Michels and Olivetti [...] "conceived Italy's [...] proletarian nationalism to be revolutionary, indeed, Marxist in essence." [...] The early revolutionary syndicalists, including Michels, realized that proletarian internationalism did not suggest an [...] "abandonment on part of the workers class of its national sentiment nor a neglect of national interest." [...] Under this interpretation, to be in compliance with Marx's theories for economic development, viewed as [...] "the prerequisite of socialist revolution," [...] the proletarian class required not only [...] "national independence", but some sort of commitment [...] "to a program of nationalism," [...] a movement which Mussolini later referred to as proletarian nationalism Michels would later become a supporter of fascism upon Mussolini's rise to power in 1922, viewing fascism's goal to destroy liberal democracy in a sympathetic manner.

At other times, it is used to refer to the contractual relationship between the principal and agent: the so-called [...] "contract of agency" [...] that in reality is a species of mandate. Very often, the term is used in a broad sense to embrace both the contract between the principal and agent, and the concept of representation. This usage, while criticised, is almost inescapable because both mandate and representation are obviously fundamental elements of the field of law generally referred to as the law of agency.|$|E
