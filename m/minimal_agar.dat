The other reliable identification test at genus level is chromosomal DNA transformation assay. In this assay, a naturally competent tryptophan auxotrophic mutant of Acinetobacter baylyi (BD4 trpE27) is transformed with the total DNA of a putative Acinetobacter isolate and the transformation mixture is plated on a brain heart infusion agar. The growth is then harvested after incubation for 24 h at 30 °C, plating on an Acinetobacter <b>minimal</b> <b>agar</b> (AMA), and incubating at 30 °C for 108 h. Growth on the AMA indicates a positive transformation assay and confirms the isolate {{as a member of}} the genus Acinetobacter. E. coli HB101 and A. calcoaceticus MTCC1921T can be used as the negative and positive controls, respectively.|$|E

These mutants, designated RuvA− and RuvB−, were {{controlled by a}} gene located close to the his gene on the chromosome map. They were sensitive to UV (10 - to 20 -fold increase) and slightly sensitive to gamma rays (3 -fold increase). Host cell reactivation, UV reactivation and genetic recombination were normal in these mutants. Irradiation of the mutants with UV resulted {{in the production of}} single-strand breaks in deoxyribonucleic acid, which was repaired upon incubation in a growth medium. After UV irradiation, these mutants resumed deoxyribonucleic acid synthesis at a normal rate, as did the parent wild-type bacteria, and formed nonseptate, multinucleate filaments. From these results we concluded that the mutants have some defect in cell division after low doses of UV irradiation, similar to the lon− or fil+ mutant of E. coli. The ruv locus was divided further into ruvA and ruvB with respect to nalidixic acid sensitivity and the effect of <b>minimal</b> <b>agar</b> or pantoyl lactone on survival of the UV-irradiated cell. The ruvB−mutant was more sensitive to nalidixic acid than were ruvA− and the parent strain.

40|$|The {{replica plating}} method as {{developed}} by Lederberg {{has been used}} to differentiate between "true" and "false" histidine-requiring revertant bacterial colonies which develop on <b>minimal</b> <b>agar</b> plates in the Ames test. Strains of S. typhimurium LT 2, TA 100, when exposed to either sodium dichromate or the fumes from the welding of stainless steel, develop colonies whose apparent numbers are directly in proportion to the Cr(VI) content per plate in both cases, over a wide dose range. Replica impressions of the resulting colonies were transferred to Vogel Bonner <b>minimal</b> <b>agar</b> plates and incubated for 48 hr at 37 degrees C. It was then observed that considerable numbers of "false" revertant colonies were obtained at those Cr(VI) doses which resulted in a pronounced toxic effect, albeit with an acceptable level of the bacterial background lawn. No morphological distinction between "true" and "false" revertant colonies could be made. Although it would appear that at low doses (i. e., low toxicity) the true mutagenicity of stainless steel welding fumes can be completely accounted for by the presence of Cr(VI), the dose range over which the mutagenicity assay is reliable cannot be estimated from examination of the background lawn or from an estimate of the degree of survival of the treated cultures. Thus there is raised a serious question concerning the reliability of quantitative data published in bacterial mutagenicity testing where replica testing of the histidine requirement of the resulting "revertant" colonies is not routinely made. It is suggested that the replica technique can easily be developed as a simple and useful tool for the control of histidine requirement and ampicillin resistance in routine mutagenicity testing.

Using these new synthetic media for microbiological assays assessing certain antimicrobials, the diameter of the inhibition zones were 1. 4 – 4 times wider than on the Mueller-Hinton agar. The advantages of the BS agars are their standard compositions, the absence of inhibitors, the reproducible quality and the low costs...|$|R
30|$|This {{experiment}} aims {{to explain}} whether {{changes in a}} set of EM variables can be indicators of the effect of HOM resulting from the addition of LRC inoculated with a consortium of CSB. The fact that bacterial colonies growing on <b>minimal</b> salt <b>agar</b> with LRC as the sole carbon source, with the typical morphological characteristics of the strains used in the CSB consortium may indicate that the EM inoculum survived {{until the end of the}} experiment should be taken into account; however, it was not possible to quantify the magnitude of the microbial population of each CSB at each sampling; therefore, there was evidence that the inoculum persisted, but it is uncertain whether the population increased or decreased. Therefore, considering the fact that the treatments with applications of the CSB consortium did not generate significant differences in the evaluated parameters for the treatments with the addition of uninoculated LRC, it was not possible to confirm that the observed changes in the EM properties were completely influenced by the CSB activity on the LRC. This results in the need for additional studies to better monitor the consortium and its activity in order to clarify these issues. However, it was found that the addition of LRC to the EM resulted in positive changes for the variables that commonly respond to treatments with humic amendments.|$|R
