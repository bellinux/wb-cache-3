40|$|On 10 November 2001, China finally acceded to the World Trade Organization (WTO) after a <b>marathon</b> <b>negotiation</b> {{spanning}} 15 years. China 2 ̆ 7 s {{membership in}} the WTO raises interesting questions for both the WTO and China. For the WTO, {{the question is how}} to deal with China?a huge country of growing importance as a major global exporter and importer but is still in economic transition. For China, the question is how to implement the numerous obligations in the WTO accession package. This paper sets out by reviewing China 2 ̆ 7 s experience in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and the WTO. It then discusses the benefits and challenges arising from China 2 ̆ 7 s WTO accession, in particular the challenges arising from market access commitments and rules obligations. The author is of the view that whilst the market access commitments are relatively easy to deal with, the rules obligations may have much broader implications on both China and the multilateral trading system. This is especially true for the WTO-minus rights provisions which are embodied in the Accession Protocol and Working Party Report of China. Finally, the author analyses the actions taken by the Chinese government since its WTO accession to implement the commitments and to deal with the challenges, and suggests some trade policy reforms...|$|R
40|$|In November 2001, China finally acceded to the World Trade Organization after a <b>marathon</b> {{accession}} <b>negotiation</b> {{that lasted}} 15 years. As China 2 ̆ 7 s accession {{coincided with the}} launch of the Doha Round, many commentators predicted that China 2 ̆ 7 s participation in the trade negotiations would have significant impacts on the Round. However, this has not proven to be the case. What have been the approaches taken by China in global trade negotiations? Why did China adopt these approaches? How did China 2 ̆ 7 s different negotiating approaches affect the dynamics of trade negotiations? These are the questions addressed in this article. The paper argues that China started as a reluctant player in the negotiations, and only gradually made its way into the core decision-making group of the WTO rather late during the round. Even though China has now been accepted {{as a member of the}} G- 7, the most powerful group in the WTO, it has been playing only supportive rather than leading roles. The article explains the reasons for such low profile approaches, and also examines the value of Chinese proposals from both quantitative and qualitative perspectives. The article concludes with some thoughts on the broader implications of China 2 ̆ 7 s growing power in the WTO as a whole...|$|R

40|$|The WTO’s nine day sprint in July 2008 was {{an attempt}} to break the logjam on “modalities” for {{agriculture}} and NAMA in the <b>marathon</b> Doha Round <b>negotiations.</b> All that observers can know for certain is that the parties did not agree, but understanding the failure is an essential prelude to any attempt to relaunch the Round. This paper is a counterfactual analysis of the various explanations that have been offered for the failure. I consider factors exogenous to the negotiation process, such as the macroeconomic context; and factors endogenous to the process such as the timing and level of participation in the meeting, {{and the nature of the}} issues under discussion. I conclude that sprinting during a marathon is unwise. The London G- 20 Summit commitment to a balanced outcome is achievable, but assembling a package with so many issues involving 153 Members takes time and patience.

Trade, Bridges, and the Financial Times, among many other media sources; all the reports are on file with the author, but are not cited for reasons of space. The analysis also rests on confidential interviews with senior members of a wide range of delegations and officials in the WTO secretariat, as well as on secretariat press briefings.

40|$|Deja vu {{all over}} again. Yogi Berra 2 ̆ 7 s classic remark seems {{particularly}} apt when discussing {{the status of}} intellectual property rights (2 ̆ 2 IPR 2 ̆ 7) protection in China. It has been twenty years since, as newly appointed Assistant US Trade Representative (2 ̆ 2 USTR 2 ̆ 7) for Japan and China, I set out with colleagues from USTR and other US government agencies on a six-year <b>marathon</b> series of <b>negotiations</b> with China on IPR and market access. Yet in the surveys conducted {{over the past several}} years by the American Chambers of Commerce in Beijing and Shanghai and by the US-China Business Council, US firms say that the biggest problems they face in China today are much the same as the complaints they raised in 1986, namely inadequate protection or enforcement of IPR- copyrights, patents, trademarks and trade secrets. There is, however, an important difference between the situation in 1986 and that of today, which is neatly captured in a classic Chinese phrase, 2 ̆ 2 The mountains are high and the emperor is far away. 2 ̆ 2 In 1986, China 2 ̆ 7 s problems in IPR stemmed directly from the policies, laws, and conduct of the national government in Beijing. There was little legal protection for intellectual property. The existing trademark law was weak and routinely flouted. The patent law, enacted only the year before our talks began in 1985, provided no product patent protection for chemicals and pharmaceuticals. Most importantly, there was no copyright law at all, and the central government itself was the major pirate of US software. Government ministries, particularly the Ministry of Chemical Industries and the Ministry of Electronics and Machine Building, routinely-and legally, since there was no law to bar it-copied vast amounts of foreign software without compensation and distributed the copies widely to their client state-owned enterprises.

40|$|If the EU were {{to apply}} for {{membership}} in the EU, it would not qualify because of the inadequate democratic content of its constitution. Nevertheless, a good 50 percent of the acts passed in France today are in fact merely the implementation of measures decided upon in the opaque labyrinth of institutions in far-away Brussels, so, is France still democratically governed? The picture is similar with respect to other international institutions in the OECD world. The WTO system of agreements, for instance, comprises almost 10 000 pages and is the result of <b>marathon</b> <b>negotiations</b> lasting over a decade and in which over 150 states and thousands of experts participated. Although these agreements contain far-reaching implications for employees in crisis-prone industrial sectors and in agriculture, the German government is generally almost overzealous in implementing the demands stipulated in the agreements. Did German citizens really have a recognizable influence on these decisions? The problem is clear. Although security and social welfare, two important aims of governance, can be better achieved with international institutions than without them, the mere existence of international institutions is no guarantee of good governance. Apart from producing effective solutions to problems within the fields of security and welfare, governance must also fulfil certain procedural requirements in order to be rated as good. From {{the point of view of}} democratic theory, however, international institutions have very shaky foundations. Against this background, Robert Dahl (1994) pointed almost paradigmatically to a fundamental dilemma of politics in the age of globalization: the contradiction between "system effectiveness and citizen participation. " This paper aims at questioning the notion of a contradiction between – to use the terms of Fritz Scharpf (1997 b) – output legitimacy (acceptance created by system effectiveness) and input legitimacy (acceptance created by democratic procedures). I shall first argue that viewing the problem as a choice between "effective problem-solving through international institutions" and "democractic political processes" is already in normative terms a false approach (Section 1). International institutions not only increase system effectiveness or output-legitimacy, but are also a normatively sensible response to the problems for democracy that are caused by globalization. At the same time, it is indisputable that the actual functioning of these international institutions does not meet democratic standards. In Section 2 I present the skeptical argument that most deficits in the working of international institutions cannot easily be remedied, since democratic majority decisions depend – in descriptive terms – on a political community that is based on trust and solidarity. Although other forms of transnational interest aggregation, such as intergovernmental bargaining and arguing among transnational epistemic communities may exist, the lack of a transnational demos combined with the existence of transnational social spaces poses a problem that cannot easily be overcome. Skeptics therefore see a structural dilemma that cannot be reconciled by democratizing international institutions; to a certain extent they are necessary for effective policies, but they are structurally undemocratic. The skeptical argument is founded on two more or less explicit background hypotheses that can be empirically challenged. The first background hypothesis states that a demos cannot exist at the transnational level. In Section 3, I will modify this statement in theoretical terms and offer some conceptual distinctions that may prepare the ground for further empirical investigation. The second background hypothesis of the skeptics postulates a zero-sum relationship between national sovereignty and supranationality. Thus, any institutional solution between the poles of nation-state sovereignty and supranational statehood, be it the EU or a world state, will necessarily encroach on both system effectiveness and democratic legitimation. Against this background I shall in Section 4 make some concrete institutional proposals that undermine the zero-sum logic of the skeptics, concluding that in a denationalized society, democratic legitimation can only be achieved by a mixed constitution comprising majority procedures and negotiation mechanisms. The problems and issues discussed in this paper have emerged in different contexts, most prominently in the debate on the democratic deficit of the EU. The EU is a special case since it represents a new type of political system, made up of national and European institutions which are constituted in relation to each other. West European national institutions and the EU institutions are so closely interwoven that they can no longer be conceived as separate political systems (see Jachtenfuchs/Kohler-Koch 1996; Marks et al. 1996). This multi-level system of the EU has two distinct features that seperate it from other international institutions. First, the regulations issued in the different European sectors (European regimes, if you wish) are so closely related to each other that as a network they affect a number of political issue areas at once within a more or less clearly defined territory. This justifies the use of the terms European Community and multi-level system. In contrast, issue-specific international institutions such as international regimes are more functional, and the sum of any number of international regimes does not cover a recognizable territorial space. Here, the term multi-level politics (for each specific institution) is more appropriate. The second distinctive feature of the EU multi-level system is that in contrast to international regimes, which are by and large passive, some European institutions, such as the European Court of Justice and the European Commission, are indeed supranational in that they have authoritative powers which directly affect national administrations and societies. In spite of these far-reaching differences, the thrust of this paper applies to both international institutions in general and the European Union in particular. Where specific steps in the argumentation refer to one or the other type of institution I shall qualify my statements accordingly...|$|E
