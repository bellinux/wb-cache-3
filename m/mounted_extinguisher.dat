50|$|Originally the Daleks were to {{be armed}} with flamethrowers, but these were vetoed on health and safety grounds and because they were {{considered}} too frightening for a young audience. Instead, the guns produced jets of CO2 gas from internally <b>mounted</b> fire <b>extinguishers.</b> Some of the Daleks used in the background for crowd scenes were constructed from moulded fibreglass, and can be distinguished by the slightly different shape of the collars around their midsections.|$|R
50|$|Porsche {{offered a}} no-cost {{option for the}} GT3 called the 'Clubsport' package. This option {{replaced}} the standard electrically adjustable leather front seats with manually adjustable racing buckets finished in fire-retardant fabric, single mass flywheel, bolt-in half-roll cage, 6-point drivers racing harness (also replacing the standard side airbags), fire <b>extinguisher</b> (<b>mounted</b> in the front passenger footwell) and preparation for a battery master switch. The Clubsport option was never offered to US customers, ostensibly due to the additional DOT crash testing {{that would have been}} required to allow US sales.|$|R
5|$|The fire, {{caused by}} the {{malfunction}} of a backup solid-fuel oxygen generator (SFOG), burned for, according to various sources, between 90 seconds and 14 minutes, and produced large amounts of toxic smoke that filled the station for around 45 minutes. This forced the crew to don respirators, {{but some of the}} respirator masks initially worn were broken. Fire <b>extinguishers</b> <b>mounted</b> {{on the walls of the}} modules were immovable. The fire occurred during a crew rotation, and as such there were six men aboard the station rather than the usual three. Access to one of the docked Soyuz lifeboats was blocked, which would have prevented escape by half of the crew. A similar incident had occurred on an earlier Mir expedition, although in that case the SFOG burned for only a few seconds.|$|R
50|$|Fort Lauderdale's fire {{department}} {{was created in}} 1912 as a volunteer department after a large conflagration destroyed {{a large portion of}} what is now the downtown core of Fort Lauderdale. The fire, which destroyed all but three buildings in the previously bustling downtown business district, prompted the city to purchase its first fire equipment consisting of a chemical <b>extinguisher</b> <b>mounted</b> on carriage wheels, and a hand operated pump. Unique to Fort Lauderdale was that the {{fire department}} never had horse-drawn apparatus. The chemical extinguisher was pulled to fires by an International Harvester truck, and the pump was pulled to the fire scene by the firefighters themselves. The pump also carried 500 feet of fire hose, which at times was not sufficient to reach fires in the city, due to inadequate roads.|$|R

5|$|Several {{accidents}} occurred which {{threatened the}} station's safety, {{such as the}} glancing collision between Kristall and Soyuz TM-17 during proximity operations in January 1994. The three most alarming incidents occurred during EO-23. The first was on 23 February 1997 during the handover period from EO-22 to EO-23, when a malfunction occurred in the backup Vika system, a chemical oxygen generator later known as solid-fuel oxygen generator (SFOG). The Vika malfunction led to a fire which burned for around 90 seconds (according to official sources at the TsUP; astronaut Jerry Linenger insists the fire burned for around 14 minutes), and produced large amounts of toxic smoke that filled the station for around 45 minutes. This forced the crew to don respirators, {{but some of the}} respirator masks initially worn were broken. Some of the fire <b>extinguishers</b> <b>mounted</b> {{on the walls of the}} newer modules were immovable.|$|R
2500|$|Fire {{extinguishers}} {{are typically}} fitted in buildings at an easily accessible location, such as {{against a wall}} in a high-traffic area. They are also often fitted to motor vehicles, watercraft, and aircraft - this is required by law in many jurisdictions, for identified classes of vehicles. Under NFPA 10 all commercial vehicles must carry at least one fire extinguisher, with size/UL rating depending on type of vehicle and cargo (i.e., fuel tankers typically must have a , while most others can carry a [...] ). The revised NFPA 10 created criteria on the placement of [...] "fast flow extinguishers" [...] in locations such as those storing and transporting pressurized flammable liquids and pressurized flammable gas or areas with possibility of three dimensional class B hazards are required to have [...] "fast flow extinguishers" [...] as required by NFPA 5.5.1.1. Varying classes of competition vehicles require fire extinguishing systems, the simplest requirements being a 1A:10BC hand-held portable <b>extinguisher</b> <b>mounted</b> to {{the interior of the}} vehicle.|$|R
2500|$|Tiran-4Sh - {{upgraded}} Tiran-4, {{fitted with}} Sharir 105 mm gun. It also was {{fitted with a}} newer type of antenna mount in, new infrared spotlight for the commander, an aiming system from the Sherman medium tank, fire <b>extinguisher</b> <b>mounted</b> {{in front of the}} searchlight, new headlights, centrally mounted [...]30 cal M1919A4 Browning medium machine gun, signal flag holders and an oil can mounted on the rear of the left fender. It also has ammunition racks modified to suit the 105mm ammunition, new communications equipment, modified commander's seat, new gunner's seat, azimuth indicator installed, driver's hatch modified so that it can opened from the outside, coaxial machine gun replaced by a 7.62mm Browning machine gun and the cupola mounted DShK 1938/46 antiaircraft heavy machine gun replaced by a 12.7mm Browning heavy machine gun, new fire control, night vision equipment, electrical system, air-conditioning system, antennae mounts on the rear of the turret, infantry tank-telephone on the rear of the hull, exhaust outlet angled upwards, additional track stowage and fire-extinguishing system installed.|$|R

The tests were to gauge the performance of long-distance docking and the feasibility of removal of the expensive Kurs automatic docking system from Progress spacecraft. Due to malfunctioning equipment, both tests failed, with Progress M-33 narrowly missing the station and Progress M-34 striking Spektr and puncturing the module, causing the station to depressurise and leading to Spektr being permanently sealed off. This in turn led to a power crisis aboard Mir as the module's solar arrays produced a large proportion of the station's electrical supply, causing the station to power down and begin to drift, requiring weeks of work to rectify before work could continue as normal.|$|R
