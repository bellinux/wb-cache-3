5|$|The Wensleydale Railway {{is reached}} by a bus service, {{operated}} by Dales & District, which runs from Northallerton {{to the current}} terminus of the railway at Leeming Bar, from where trains run to Redmire. It is hoped that eventually passenger trains will connect with the Settle-Carlisle Railway at Garsdale, and that the section of line near Northallerton known as the South Curve can be upgraded to allow trains from Wensleydale to run into Northallerton railway station without reversing onto the main line. At the <b>moment</b> <b>there</b> are some limited goods, engineering and excursion trains using the North Curve.|$|E
5|$|Dragon Quest VII is {{best known}} for its huge size. Without {{completing}} the game's side quests, a single game of Dragon Quest VII can take a hundred hours or more. In terms of gameplay, not much has changed from previous installments; battles are still fought in a turn-based mode from a first person perspective. Although non-battle sequences are rendered in 3D, battles themselves are still portrayed two dimensionally. The ability to talk with the party characters in and outside of battles was added to this game. They offer advice about battle strategies and plot points, or simply comment on how they feel at a given <b>moment.</b> <b>There</b> are four ways and means of locomotion: feet, boat, magic carpet, and skystone. Each of these can move across different terrain.|$|E

25|$|A recent {{updated version}} of the {{evanescent}} field optical tweezers makes use of extended optical landscape patterns to simultaneously guide {{a large number of}} particles into a preferred direction without using a waveguide. It is termed as Lensless Optical Trapping (“LOT”). The orderly movement of the particles is aided by the introduction of Ronchi Ruling that creates well-defined optical potential wells (replacing the waveguide). This means that particles are propelled by the evanescent field while being trapped by the linear bright fringes. At the <b>moment,</b> <b>there</b> are scientists working on focused evanescent fields as well.|$|E

At 18 pages of stage directions, the script contained every joke in the episode, an exercise in planning atypical for Shearsmith and Pemberton. The story contains multiple [...] "reveals"; Pemberton explained that he and Shearsmith [...] "hope there's an 'oh my God' <b>moment.</b> <b>There</b> is always a desire to wrong-foot the viewer. That's what you strive to do". Pemberton said that writing for a silent episode [...] "makes you inventive in a completely different way".|$|E

In a preview written on the ITU website, Merryn Sherwood {{identified}} Jenkins, Moffatt, Densham, Spirig and Andrea Hewitt (New Zealand) as favourites. She wrote that she expected Lucy Hall (Great Britain), Hewitt and Densham to be strong on the swim leg {{along with a few}} other athletes. Sherwood thought that if that there was a large group of athletes together on the run then many of the competitors would fancy their chances at winning. Sherwood wrote, [...] "Most importantly every athlete will be going into the race knowing they have a chance."

She believed that Jo resists her urge to [...] "go crazy [...] " [...] due to the dire circumstances, which [...] "gave it a little more meaning".
