Moreover, we propose universal measures of wood-decay fungi, i.e., penetration velocity, penetration work and penetration capacity, which may figure as measures for the efficiency of wood colonization. For example, our simulation shows that an increase of the hyphal growth rate (i.e. changing the incubation conditions) from 1 to 2  μm·d- 1 results in an increase of the <b>mycelium’s</b> <b>growth</b> velocity from 0.8 to 1.75  μm·d- 1 and an increase of the penetration capacity from 0.5 to 0.6 10 - 3 ·mm 2 ·d- 1 using a pit degradation rate of 2  μm·d- 1.|$|R
40|$|Helvella lacunosa, besides its {{mycorrhizal}} {{importance for}} plant forest species, {{has a high}} commercial value. The commercial production of H. lacunosa represents two main advantages: Economical benefits for the communities able to produce it; and conservation of biodiversity in the forests by preventing the species overexploitation and maintaining the mushroom-plants micorrhizal relationship. Carrying out this perspective requires, in principle, to isolate the species mycelium, and then to develop the mycorrhizing technique that allows {{the production of the}} mushroom. Isolating the mycelium by the first time, however, involves testing several culture media in order to identify the potential requirements for inducing the <b>myceliums</b> <b>growth.</b> In the present work we tested, in laboratory, five different agar-based culture media to isolate H. lacunosas mycelium, and to evaluate its growing rate, analysis of covariance showed that there is a simple linear relationship between incubation time and the diameter.

50|$|Like many fungal species, C. globosum obtains {{their energy}} from carbon {{sources such as}} glucose, {{mannitol}} and fructose.

50|$|There {{are several}} ways to prevent and control manifestation of A. penicillioides and its {{biological}} contaminants. Fungal detector can be used to determine in advance whether a place is damp and supports fungal growth, which allow actions to be taken before contamination occurs. The fungal detector encapsulating fungal spores is exposed to test site, and fungal response is measured. Greatest response indicates the type of fungi that would contaminate the site. At 71% relative humidity, such as dry areas in homes, A. penicillioides showed greatest response and form many spores. The formation of new spores indicate that life cycle of A. penicillioides is progressed to completion, and propagation of these new spores can lead to contamination. A biosensor has also been used to detect volatile organic compounds, such as formaldehyde. Formaldehyde is detected in air based on fungal growth inhibition, reflected by suppressed <b>mycelium</b> <b>growth</b> and absorbance. This biosensor is advantageous in that it allows measuring of toxicity at lower cost than HPLC and GC/MS. However, it is difficult to identify the toxic substance and concentration of toxicity in a sample by this biosensor. Some other prevention strategies are controlling liquid water, managing indoor condensation and selecting materials that minimize mould growth.|$|E

50|$|Under optimal conditions, this {{polycyclic}} {{disease can}} potentially grow 20 generations {{in a growing}} season. Favorable environmental conditions for Podosphaera macularis fecundity include low sun exposure, soil moisture, and excessive fertilization. The optimal temperature range for spore and <b>mycelium</b> <b>growth</b> is 18 to 25 °C. In addition, periods with small temperature differences between night and day, {{with a minimum of}} 10 °C at night and a daily high of 20 °C increase the risk of infection. High humidity and optimal temperature conditions are necessary for primary infection between the middle and end of May. The cleistothecia swell up and burst due to increased turgor pressure leading to the release of ascospores. During the secondary infection period from mid-July to August, conidia infectivity and germination is highest around 18 °C. However, leaf wetness is not essential for the formation and germination of conidia, but rather slight rain has an indirect effect related to high humidity and low sun light. Since the life cycle mainly exists externally, with only haustoria inside the host, supra-optimal temperatures and low relative humidity are unfavorable parameters for germination, infection or sporulation of powdery mildew. Temperatures exceeding 30 °C for more than three hours reduce the chance of infection by up to 50%. Intense rain and wind periods that cause spores blown throughout the hop yard also prevent powdery mildew fecundity. In addition, solar irradiation can kill released spores, but as hops grow, the sun can’t penetrate the dense canopy.|$|E

50|$|Ascospores {{germinate}} {{by releasing}} globose vesicles from their apical germ pores which later develop into germ tubes. The germ tubes then grow into hyaline septate hyphae.

The germination of ascospores can be inhibited by tannin and species of Streptomyces. On the other hand, germination is stimulated by glucose.
