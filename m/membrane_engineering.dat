The selectivity of membrane is derived mathematically and compared to experimental results reported here.

40|$|Background Construction of {{microbial}} biocatalysts for {{the production}} of biorenewables at economically viable yields and titers is frequently hampered by product toxicity. Membrane damage is often deemed as the principal mechanism of this toxicity, particularly in regards to decreased membrane integrity. Previous studies have attempted to engineer the membrane with the goal of increasing membrane integrity. However, most of these works focused on engineering of phospholipids and efforts to identify membrane proteins that can be targeted to improve fatty acid production have been unsuccessful. Results Here we show that deletion of outer membrane protein ompF significantly increased membrane integrity, fatty acid tolerance and fatty acid production, possibly due to prevention of re-entry of short chain fatty acids. In contrast, deletion of fadL resulted in significantly decreased membrane integrity and fatty acid production. Consistently, increased expression of fadL remarkably increased membrane integrity and fatty acid tolerance while also increasing the final fatty acid titer. This 34 % increase in the final fatty acid titer was possibly due to increased membrane lipid biosynthesis. Tuning of fadL expression showed that there is a positive relationship between fadL abundance and fatty acid production. Combinatorial deletion of ompFand increased expression of fadL were found to have an additive role in increasing membrane integrity, and was associated with a 53 % increase the fatty acid titer, to 2. 3 g/L. Conclusions These results emphasize the importance of membrane proteins for maintaining membrane integrity and production of biorenewables, such as fatty acids, which expands the targets for <b>membrane</b> <b>engineering...</b>|$|E

Lucia Foundation, Rome, 3 Faculty of Medicine, Biochemistry and Clinical Biochemistry Institute, Catholic University of the “Sacred Heart”, Rome, Italy Abstract: The {{success and}} the quality of {{hemodialysis}} therapy are mainly related to both clearance and biocompatibility properties of the artificial membrane packed in the hemodialyzer. Performance of a membrane is strongly influenced by its interaction with the plasma protein repertoire during the extracorporeal procedure. Recognition that a number of medium–high molecular weight solutes, including proteins and protein-bound molecules, are potentially toxic has prompted the development of more permeable membranes. Such <b>membrane</b> <b>engineering,</b> however, may cause loss of vital proteins, with membrane removal being nonspecific. In addition, plasma proteins can be adsorbed onto the membrane surface upon blood contact during dialysis. Adsorption can contribute to the removal of toxic compounds and governs the biocompatibility of a membrane, since surface-adsorbed proteins may trigger a variety of biologic blood pathways with pathophysiologic consequences. Over the last years, use of proteomic approaches has allowed polypeptide spectrum involved in the process of hemodialysis, a key issue previously hampered by lack of suitable technology, to be assessed in an unbiased manner and in its full complexity. Proteomics has been successfully applied to identify and quantify proteins in complex mixtures such as dialysis outflow fluid and fluid desorbed from dialysis membrane containing adsorbed proteins. The identified proteins can also be characterized by their involvement in metabolic and signaling pathways, molecular networks, and biologic processes through application of bioinformatics tools. Proteomics may thus provide an actual functional definition as to the effect of a membrane material on plasma proteins during hemodialysis. Here, we review the results of proteomic studies on the performance of hemodialysis membranes, as evaluated in terms of solute removal efficiency and blood–membrane interactions. The evidence collected indicates that the information provided by proteomic investigations yields improved molecular and functional knowledge and may lead to the development of more efficient membranes for the potential benefit of the patient.

40|$|Whole-cell {{biocatalysts}} are preferred in many biocatalysis applications. However, cell envelope often {{represents a}} formidable permeability barrier. As a result, reactions catalyzed by whole-cells are reportedly {{orders of magnitude}} slower than those of by their free enzyme counterparts. The present research addresses this critical issue by using <b>membrane</b> <b>engineering</b> approaches. Two E. coli strains with genetically altered outer membrane structures {{were used in the}} study, a lipopolysaccarides (LPS) mutant SM 101 and a Braun 2 ̆ 7 s lipoprotein mutant E 609 L. The effects of outer membrane mutation on the permeability of substrates differing substantially in size and hydrophobicity were investigated by combining the mutant cells with model enzymes. The reduction of the outer membrane permeability barrier by these mutations led to significant accelerations (2 to 14 fold) in reaction rates of all whole-cell catalyzed reactions investigated. In the case of tetrapeptide, LPS mutation of the outer membrane can render the outer membrane completely permeable to substrate, a barrier-less condition that maximizes the reaction rate. For reaction rates of toluene dioxygenase (TDO) -catalyzed reactions, a dramatic increase of up to six fold was observed with the lipoprotein mutant {{for each of the three}} small, hydrophobic substrates tested. Mutations in either the LPS or in the Braun 2 ̆ 7 s lipoprotein are effective for accelerating reactions with UDP-glucose, resulting in a striking acceleration (up to 14 fold) of reaction rate. The magnitude of reaction rate acceleration was found to be dependent upon the substrate concentrations, the enzyme expression level, and on the nature of the mutations and substrates. In addition, the mutations have been demonstrated to be far more superior to common permeabilization procedures like freeze-thaw (FT) or treatment with the chelating agent EDTA (ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid). Importantly, lipoprotein mutant E 609 L exhibited a normal growth rate and expressed the recombinant multi-component enzyme as well as the isogenic parent. The exact nature of lpp lipoprotein mutation in E 609 L was further studied and deletion of lpp was successfully introduced into E. coli strain with different genetic background for whole-cell biocatalysis applications. An example was provided by introducing an lpp deletion into an E. coli O 44 K 74 strain to achieve a higher yield for L-carnitine production.

40|$|Sustainable {{development}} and Process intensification strategy are guidelines for industrial processes in perspective. It {{is becoming more}} and more common that industry wants to fully exploit their resources due to environmental regulations, economic gain, sustainable standpoint, etc. In this perspective, waste streams have to be turned into resources in the most environmental friendly, economic and sustainable way. <b>Membrane</b> <b>Engineering</b> is already a key-figure to realize this objective. Novel membrane technologies such as membrane distillation (MD), membrane crystallization (MCr), pressure retarded osmosis (PRO), reverse electrodialysis (RED) and forward osmosis (FO), are evolving and are being suggested for a better exploitation of waste streams. This Ph. D. study focusses, particular, on Membrane crystallization (MCr), which is a novel technology for simultaneously production of water and minerals. It has several advantages with respect to conventional crystallizers in terms of purity, controlled kinetics and crystal morphology. Moreover, MCr is able to treat high concentration solutions, which are challenging for other traditional membrane operations. The current Ph. D. work emphasizes on various aspects of membrane crystallization for approaching zero-liquid discharge in industrial processes. Improved membranes, specifically developed for MCr applications, have to be manufactured. In this study, preliminary suggestions on membrane features are given for the requirements in MCr. Lab-made PVDF membranes with different characteristics have been tested and evaluated for their performance in MCr. This study, suggests that membranes with symmetric sponge layer structure and low thickness are favorable. Membrane of asymmetric structure with many macrovoids seems more pronounced to suffer from wetting. Moreover, it has been shown that, membrane crystallization is able to treat several kinds of feed solutions including RO brine, produced water and wastewater containing high amounts of sodium sulfate. The recovered crystals exhibit high purity, good size distribution and controlled growth. Na 2 SO 4 can be recovered as different polymorphs and in this study it has been crystallized in the anhydrous form (Thenardite). Moreover, the process has shown excellent stability in terms of transmembrane flux and maintenance of hydrophobicity of the membrane. In some cases the treatment has been continued for more than 90 hours by only slight cleaning with distillate water. Membrane crystallization, in the direct-contact membrane distillation configuration, can normally treat solutions with very high concentrations. However, its limitations in the recovery of lithium from single salt solutions have been highlighted in this study. Vapor pressure, due to increase in concentration, is reduced significant, that it is not possible to reach LiCl saturation by this configuration. Likewise, combined direct-contact and osmotic distillation configuration have not been able to increase the driving force enough in order to exceed saturation. Instead vacuum membrane distillation has been introduced to eliminate the osmotic phenomena. This configuration has been able to recover LiCl in two different polymorph structures depending on the utilized operative conditions. Furthermore, integrated membrane system, including membrane crystallization, has shown excellent capability to treat orange juice. The quality of the juice has been maintained through ultrafiltration, membrane distillation and membrane crystallization treatment. In this study, the MD/MCr feed temperature is kept below 30 °C causing a relatively low flux. However, it has still been possible to reach from a concentration of 9 °brix to 65 °brix using MD/MCr. The advantages of MD/MCr with respect to isothermal osmotic membrane distillation configuration, is the elimination of the reconcentration stages of the draw solution. All the carried out case studies show that MD/MCr is able to reduce the volume of the waste stream significantly. The obtained results might be used as guidelines for practical application. Moreover, the low temperatures and atmospheric pressures utilized, makes it possible in real industrial processes to use waste or low-grade heat. Unlike other processes, MCr is able to produce two high quality products (i. e. water and salts) and will therefore not produce any additional waste. Hereby, the extended treatment by means of MCr will only positively influence the overall “sustainability” of the entire industrial process.

This prodrug is a substrate for the tumour located enzyme which results in the generation of a highly toxic molecule able to penetrate the tumour mass and cross cell <b>membranes.</b> Genetic <b>engineering</b> methods now offer the prospect of human immunoglobulins with tumour binding and catalytic sites having the potential to minimise host response. Whether this can be achieved depends on having antibodies with adequate specificity and our ability to develop enzyme-prodrug systems with the required characteristics. Early results encourage us to think progress can be made in this direction...|$|R
40|$|Carbon nanofibers (CNFs) {{have several}} {{properties}} {{that make them}} attractive for electronic devices, filtration <b>membranes,</b> tissue <b>engineering</b> scaffolds, composites (reinforcement agents), or catalyst carriers. Exploitation of renewable resources such as cellulosic materials can help to supply all these expanding demands. Synthesis of carbon nanofibrous materials with controlled properties by carbonization of electrospun cellulose was performed in the present work. At the first step fine fibers were fabricated by electrospinning of cellulose acetate solution, they were subsequently regenerated to cellulose in various conditions and, finally, carbonized. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and x-ray diffraction (XRD) showed that carbonization of electrospun cellulose (EC) at 800 - 1000 °C {{led to the formation}} of amorphous granular carbon nanofibers with diameters of 20 - 150 nm, controlled electrical conductivity (3. 8 – 17. 0 S/cm) and wettability (water contact angle is 55 – 120 °). Our analysis shows that the structure and properties of the resulting CNFs are influenced by deacetylation conditions and temperature of carbonization. XRD patterns illustrate different crystallinity indexes (CI) in different cases of deacetylation. Cellulose samples with sufficiently high CI are appropriate precursors for CNF synthesis...|$|R
40|$|Summary Several {{years of}} {{experience}} have now accumulated in the targeting of anti-cancer agents {{so that we can}} take stock, identify problems and look for ways round them. Three major obstacles seem to limit present approaches. These are heterogeneity in the distribution of target molecules within the cancer cell population, the pharmacokinetic characteristics of macromolecules and host antibody response to foreign protein. An approach which we have been investigating uses antibodies or other vectors to carry enzymes which have no close human homologue to tumour sites. After clearing residual enzyme activity from the blood by one of several possible techniques, a relatively non-toxic prodrug is given. This prodrug is a substrate for the tumour located enzyme which results in the generation of a highly toxic molecule able to penetrate the tumour mass and cross cell <b>membranes.</b> Genetic <b>engineering</b> methods now offer the prospect of human immunoglobulins with tumour binding and catalytic sites having the potential to minimise host response. Whether this can be achieved depends on having antibodies with adequate specificity and our ability to develop enzyme-prodrug systems with the required characteristics. Early results encourage us to think progress can be made in this direction. First, I want to thank the Association of Cancer Physicians for the great honour of calling this 'The Bagshawe Lecture'...|$|R
