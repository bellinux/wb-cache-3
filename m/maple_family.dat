50|$|Acer laurinum is an {{evergreen}} Asian {{tree in the}} <b>maple</b> <b>family.</b> It is {{the only}} member of its family native to the Southern Hemisphere, with a distribution encompassing Burma (Myanmar), Cambodia, India, Indonesia, Laos (Khammouan), Malaysia, Nepal, Philippines, Thailand, and southwestern China (Guangxi, Hainan, Tibet, Yunnan).|$|E
50|$|Aceraceae were {{recognized}} as a family of flowering plants also called the <b>maple</b> <b>family.</b> They contain two to four genera, depending upon the circumscription, of some 120 species of trees and shrubs. A common characteristic is that the leaves are opposite, and the fruit a schizocarp.|$|E

50|$|After {{receiving}} his Bachelor of Landscape Architecture {{degree from}} the University of Georgia, Richard {{went to work for}} golf course architect Dan Maples in Pinehurst, North Carolina in 1990. The <b>Maples</b> <b>family</b> was well rooted in the world of golf course architecture. Frank Maples (Dan’s grandfather) was the construction superintendent for Donald Ross on the first four courses at the famed Pinehurst Country Club and Dan’s father was a golf architect in his own right, apprenticing under Mr. Ross himself. After completing his time with Dan Maples, Richard moved on to work with Denis Griffiths, another well known architect based in Braselton, Georgia. Working under two of the industry’s most respected architects, both of whom were past Presidents of the American Society of Golf Course Architects, provided Richard with the technical skills required to start his own legacy.|$|R
50|$|Pometia pinnata {{is a large}} {{tropical}} hardwood {{and fruit}} tree species, with common names including matoa, taun tree, island lychee, tava, of the plant <b>family</b> Sapindaceae (<b>maple</b> and lychee <b>family).</b>|$|R

50|$|The {{season after}} his {{retirement}} as a player, Clancy briefly coached the Montreal Maroons before beginning an 11-year stint as an NHL referee. In 1949, the Montreal Canadiens hired Clancy to coach their American Hockey League farm team, the Cincinnati Mohawks. He was released after two losing seasons, and rejoined the <b>Maple</b> Leaf <b>family</b> as {{coach of the}} Leafs' AHL affiliate, the Pittsburgh Hornets. The Hornets had two outstanding seasons under Clancy, winning the Calder Cup as league champions in 1951-52, and nearly repeating the following year, before losing the cup final in seven games.|$|R
5000|$|Guarana ( [...] {{from the}} Portuguese guaraná [...] ), Paullinia cupana, syn. P. crysan, P. sorbilis) is a {{climbing}} {{plant in the}} <b>maple</b> <b>family,</b> Sapindaceae, native to the Amazon basin and especially common in Brazil. Guarana features large leaves and clusters of flowers, and {{is best known for}} the seeds from its fruit, which are {{about the size of a}} coffee bean. As a dietary supplement, guarana is an effective stimulant: its seeds contain about twice the concentration of caffeine found in coffee seeds (about 2-4.5% caffeine in guarana seeds compared to 1-2% for coffee seeds).|$|E
50|$|In trees, {{the roots}} {{normally}} grow outward to {{about three times}} the branch spread. Only half of a trees root system occurs between the trunk and the circumference of its canopy. Roots {{on one side of}} a tree normally supply the foliage on that same side of the tree. Thus when roots on one side of a tree are injured, the branches and leaves on that same side of the tree may die or wilt. For some trees however, such as the <b>maple</b> <b>family,</b> the effect of a root injury may show itself anywhere in the tree canopy.|$|E
50|$|Established in 1989, the Stonerose Interpretive Center and Fossil Site is an Eocene Epoch fossil {{site and}} {{accompanying}} interpretive center, located in Republic, Washington, {{part of the}} Okanagan Highland. The fossils are from organisms that lived in the area nearly 50 million {{years ago when the}} area that is now the city of Republic was part of an ancient lake. The old lake's bottom layers are now volcanic ash hardened into sedimentary rock, becoming fine-grained tuffaceous shale. The fossils include various, and some extinct, insects, fish, leaves and twigs, as well as bird feathers. The Republic upland lacustrine fossil beds are significant as they represent the earliest known records of the Rosaceae (rose family) and Aceraceae (<b>maple</b> <b>family).</b>|$|E
50|$|Rainville {{continued}} making product as {{he worked}} his way through Clarkson University, frequently returning to Lincoln on weekends. After graduating in 1984, he set about constructing a new woodshop of sufficient size for his now-full-time business. The name “Maple Landmark Woodcraft” was also adopted. This name was an extension of Maple Landmark Homestead, the <b>family</b> <b>maple</b> sugaring business and dairy farm.|$|R
50|$|Maple Ridge was {{incorporated}} as a district municipality on September 12, 1874. It covered {{an area of}} 33,000 acres (130 km2) yet was home to only approximately 50 <b>families.</b> <b>Maple</b> Ridge is British Columbia's fifth-oldest municipality (after New Westminster, Victoria, Langley, and Chilliwack). Until the expansion of Metro Vancouver (the GVRD) {{it was part of}} the now-defunct Dewdney-Alouette Regional District with the City of Pitt Meadows and District of Mission and other north-side communities east to Chehalis.|$|R
5000|$|Sirup {{production}} was temporarily halted in 1942 because of World War II—heavy taxes on sugar made the maple sugaring business unprofitable—but production resumed the following year. [...] In 1947, Lawrence's son Stephen Funk, a veteran airman of the war, and Stephen's wife, Glaida, {{took over the}} sirup operation. When during the early 1970s it looked like construction of Interstate 55 through McLean County would cut through the Funks Grove's virgin prairie forest and the <b>family's</b> prized sugar <b>maples,</b> the <b>family</b> successfully petitioned to get the superhighway rerouted around the historic grove. A billboard erected alongside the new interstate ensured that the maple business lost no customers due to the new highway. During the late 1970s, Stephen and his son Mike formed a partnership to run the sirup operation. In 1988, Stephen retired, and Mike and his wife, Debby, took over the business; later that year, Stephen and his sons Mike, Larry and Adam built the current sugarhouse, {{the first one to}} include a salesroom. Mike's nephew Sean Funk became a partner in the business in 2001. Today, Funks Grove Maple Sirup has both a mail-order business and an online ordering system, {{thanks in part to the}} increased popularity that came with resurging interest in Historic Route 66.|$|R
5000|$|The {{founding}} of Seattle is usually dated from {{the arrival of}} the Denny Party scouts in September 25, 1851. However, Luther Collins, Henry Van Asselt, and the <b>Maple</b> <b>family</b> founded a farming settlement on what is currently the Seattle neighborhood of Georgetown in September 27, 1851. The Denny party's original site was an unfinished cabin, without roof, and a camp site, located at Alki Point, in West Seattle. The Collins party settlement was improved with permanent structures, and was soon producing produce and meat for sale and barter. In April, 1852, Arthur A. Denny abandoned the original site at Alki in favor of a better protected site on Elliott Bay that is now part of downtown Seattle. Arthur A. Denny and Luther Collins were the first commissioners of King County after its creation in 1852. Around the same time, David Swinson [...] "Doc" [...] Maynard began settling the land immediately south of Denny's.|$|E
50|$|Georgetown {{is arguably}} the oldest {{neighborhood}} of Seattle. Georgetown's first settlement was founded on September 27, 1851, when Luther Collins, Henry Van Asselt, and the <b>Maple</b> <b>family</b> arrived with their household goods {{with the intention of}} farming the rich alluvial lands of the Duwamish delta. Although the Denny Party arrived at Alki Point two days prior to the Collins Party arrival, the Collins Party was able to complete permanent structures and build a successful farming community within a year. The Denny Party suffered in relative squalor in an unfinished cabin and encampment until their move in 1852 to the future downtown Seattle area. The Collins farm was located {{in the vicinity of the}} present-day First Avenue Bridge, running north to the vicinity of South Idaho Street, on the east bank of the Duwamish River. Georgetown was named by Julius Horton after his son in 1890. Rainier Brewing Company's original Rainier Brewery, once reportedly the sixth-largest brewery in the world, began operations in 1882. Now called the Georgetown Brewhouse, the red brick brewery, home to artists and small businesses, dominates the commercial district along Airport Way S.|$|E

5000|$|Isaac II had a brother, Absalom Funk, {{named after}} their uncle Absalom, their father's brother. The younger Absalom's daughter, Hazel Funk Holmes, who was cousin to Arthur and Lawrence, {{took over the}} family sirup {{business}} during the early 1920s; she owned the property on which the sirup operation (Funks Grove Pure Maple Sirup) is now located and was the owner when U.S. Route 66 came through the area in November 1926. Hazel {{was the one who}} modernized the operation and ensured that the family business continued well into the future. Because Hazel's primary residence was still out East, however, she rented out her land to tenants who tapped the sugar maples every spring, made the sirup, and farmed the rest of the land, and she built a new sugarhouse to house a flue-pan evaporator. [...] The little peaked cabin that Arthur and Lawrence had used as a cooking house was moved to its present location on the farm, where Hazel used it as a guesthouse and as her summer home. Hazel also protected her land for the future: in her will, she placed her timber and farmland in a trust, for use by the <b>family</b> <b>maple</b> sugaring business. In that same trust, she insisted that their product be forever called maple sirup, spelled with an 'i' -- as was the preferred spelling in Webster's at the time to indicate a pure maple product made only from boiled maple sap and untainted by other sweeeteners or additional ingredients.|$|R
40|$|The United States is the world’s largest {{producer}} of blueberries and the world’s second largest {{producer of}} maple syrup. Maine is the nation’s leading producer of wild blueberries, harvesting 82. 6 {{million pounds of}} wild blueberries. Similarly, the New England region represents roughly 75 % of the total U. S. production of maple syrup. These plants {{play a vital role}} in New England’s economy and are commonly consumed; however, these plants benefit more than the economy. The secondary metabolites of these plants are both antioxidants, and also anti-inflammatory, antibacterial and anti-viral agents. Blueberries are commonly consumed and have been investigated exhaustively. On the other hand, the roots and stems of the blueberry bush have not been investigated for their phytochemicals. Similarly, our laboratory has investigated two of the most common species tapped for their sap of the maple (Acer) genus. Another species of the <b>maple</b> <b>family</b> that produces sap is the Norway maple tree (Acer platanoides). Investigating the phytochemicals from these plants can revolutionize many industries...|$|E
40|$|International {{concerns}} about the proliferation of nuclear materials have generated interest {{in the development of}} LEU (low enriched uranium, < 20 % 235 U) fuel to facilitate the conversion of research reactors operating on HEU (high enriched uranium, ≥ 20 % 235 U, typically 93 % 235 U) fuel. AECL has considerable experience in the development and testing of fuels for both research and power reactors. This paper reviews AECL’s development of LEU fuel for the NRU, MAPLE and SLOWPOKE research reactors, and summarizes the status of the current program to develop higher density LEU-Mo fuel. In the 1980 ’s AECL began to develop LEU fuel for the NRU reactor as part of an international effort to reduce the commercial use of HEU, and thereby increase the proliferation resistance of research reactors. The replacement LEU fuel elements contain a high-density uranium compound, U 3 Si, dispersed in an aluminium matrix. The metal-matrix composite fuel cores are fabricated using powder metallurgy techniques, then extruded with finned aluminium cladding, which is welded to aluminium end plugs. When AECL began the design of the <b>MAPLE</b> <b>family</b> of research reactors (10 - 30 MWth) ...|$|E
