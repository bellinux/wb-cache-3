500|$|Castle Rock {{offered to}} finance any other film Darabont wanted to develop. Darabont seriously {{considered}} the offer, citing growing up poor in Los Angeles, believing it would elevate his {{standing in the}} industry, and that Castle Rock could have contractually fired him and given the film to Reiner anyway. But, he chose to remain the director, saying in a 2014 Variety interview, [...] "you can continue to defer your dreams in exchange for <b>money</b> <b>and,</b> <b>you</b> know, die without ever having done the thing you set out to do". Reiner served as Darabont's mentor on the project instead. Within two weeks of showing the script to Castle Rock, Darabont had a $25 million budget to make his film (taking a $750,000 screenwriting and directing salary plus {{a percentage of the}} net profits), and pre-production began in January 1993.|$|E
500|$|The {{new republican}} {{government}} was headed by Qadi Abdul Rahman Iryani, Ahmed Noman and Mohamed Ali Uthman. The Prime Minister was Mohsin al-Aini. Noman, however, remained in Beirut. He was doubtful {{of his colleagues}} reluctance {{to negotiate with the}} Hamidaddin family, preferring to expel it instead. On November 23, he resigned, and his place was taken by Hassan Amri. Prince Mohamed bin Hussein told the country's chiefs [...] "We have <b>money,</b> <b>and</b> <b>you</b> will have your share if you join us. If not, we will go on without you". The chiefs agreed to mobilize their tribes. 6,000 royalist regulars and 50,000 armed tribesmen known as [...] "the Fighting Rifles" [...] surrounded San'a, captured its main airport and severed the highway to the port of Hodeida, a main route for Russian supplies. In a battle twelve miles east of the capital, 3,200 soldiers of both sides were killed, and an entire republican regiment reportedly deserted to the royalists. Bin Hussein gave them an ultimatum: [...] "Surrender the city or be annihilated". Iryani went to Cairo for what the Egyptian official press agency called [...] "a medical checkup". Foreign Minister Hassan Makki also left Yemen, leaving the government in charge of Amri. Amri declared a 6 p.m. curfew and ordered civilians to form militia units [...] "to defend the republic". In Liberation Square, six suspected royalist infiltrators were publicly executed by a firing squad, and their bodies were later strung up on poles.|$|E
