In the case of the first two, the pistol could come with a hollow wooden stock that doubled as a holster.|$|R
50|$|It was {{excavated}} in 1924 by the University of Michigan team. The gate had inscriptions on both sides. These were {{mounted on}} architraves and were formed from individually cast bronze letters which had <b>mounting</b> <b>lugs</b> on their reverses.

5000|$|During the Mexican-American War the U.S. {{found itself}} lacking in light guns {{that could be}} fired from ships’ boats and landed {{to be used as}} light {{artillery}} in support of landing parties [...] Light artillery borrowed from the army proved unsatisfactory. In 1849, then lieutenant, Dahlgren began to design a family of smoothbore muzzle-loading boat howitzers that could be mounted in ships’ launches and cutters as well as being mounted onto field carriages. The first boat howitzers to be designed were a light 12-pounder, a heavy 12-pounder (originally designated a medium), and a 24-pounder. Later a lighter 12-pounder (the small) and a rifled 12-pounder heavy howitzer were introduced. All of the boat howitzers were very similar in design, cast in bronze, with a <b>mounting</b> <b>lug</b> or loop {{on the bottom of the}} barrel instead of trunnions, and an elevating screw running through the cascabel. Having the single <b>mounting</b> <b>lug</b> expedited moving the howitzer from the launch to field carriage and back. In naval service the boat howitzers had gun crews of 10 in the boat and 11 ashore.|$|E
50|$|Mounting the {{indicator}} may be done several ways. Many indicators have a <b>mounting</b> <b>lug</b> {{with a hole}} for a bolt {{as part of the}} back plate. Alternately, the device can be held by the cylindrical stem that guides the plunger using a collet or special clamp, which is the method generally used by tools designed to integrate an indicator as a primary component, such as thickness gauges and comparators. Common outside diameters for the stem are 3/8 inch and 8 mm, though there are other diameters made. Another option that a few manufacturers include is dovetail mounts compatible with those on dial test indicators.|$|E

50|$|The 'old' version {{consists}} of a cylindrical main body with six large fragmentation grooves running around the circumference and two <b>mounting</b> <b>lugs</b> on one side for mounting the mine to a provided metal stake. The 'new' version of the mine is similar, but with a smaller fuze and no fragmentation grooves.|$|R
40|$|A failed Tail Gear Box (TGB) housing of a {{helicopter}} was analyzed. Analysis showed that the gearbox failed by fatigue. Fatigue cracks initiated at the <b>mounting</b> <b>lugs</b> and propagated by low cycle fatigue. There were no metallurgical and/or mechanical abnormalities associated with fatigue crack initiation. Fatigue appears to be stress related. The possibility of excessive load/vibration on the TGB housings in question may be examined...|$|R
40|$|An {{investigation}} {{has been made}} in the Langley 8 -foot transonic tunnels on the aerodynamic characteristics of a 0. 15 -scale model of the North American Aviation 255 -inch fin-stabilized external store over a maximum Mach number range of 0. 60 to 1. 2 and on the effects of <b>mounting</b> <b>lugs,</b> of fin orientation, of fin aspect ratio, and of fixed-transition. The Reynolds number (based on a body length of 37. 50 inches) varied from 9. 8 x 10 (exp 6) to 13. 1 x 10 (exp 6). The results indicate that the static margin of the finned store at low lift coefficients was only 9 percent of body length at subsonic Mach numbers and was reduced to zero at a Mach number of 1. 0, Increasing the fin aspect ratio from 1. 82 to 2. 41 increased the subsonic static margin to 18 percent and provided a minimum margin of 9 percent near a Mach number of l. O. Store <b>mounting</b> <b>lugs</b> or fin orientation had only small effects on the aerodynamic characteristics of the basic store...|$|R
40|$|The <b>mounting</b> <b>lug</b> of the MGB housing of a {{helicopter}} has failed by fatigue. With the available evidences, {{it was not possible}} to establish the exact cause of the failure. Analysis shows that the fatigue crack initiation was due to one or more of the following reasons: (a) ovality in the lug bore and/or bush, (b) excessive rotational torque on the MGB housing, and (c) improper fitment. No metallurgical abnormalities were responsible for the failure. The microstructure and chemical composition of the housing material were found to conform to RZ- 5 specification...|$|E
40|$|A sample {{pertaining}} to the <b>mounting</b> <b>lug</b> of ‘A’ frame at cluster 8 D of body structure of accident helicopter {{was sent to the}} laboratory for fractographic analysis. It was requested not to carry out any destructive tests on the sample. Fractographic analysis suggests that the lug in question has failed by sudden overload. There were no evidences of delayed failure like stress corrosion cracking or fatigue. The weld quality at the failed lug was found to be poor. Insufficient fusion and lack of weld penetration were observed. However, these imperfections do not appear to have any role to play in the present failure...|$|E
40|$|There was an {{incidence}} to {{an aircraft}} wherein the pilot {{heard a loud}} bang on accelerating throttle to max dry rpm at line up. After preliminary examination, a few suspected components of the damaged engine were forwarded to the laboratory for identification of mode and cause of failure. Examination revealed that failure {{of one of the}} first stage low-pressure compressor blades was the first in the chain of events that led to the engine failure. Fractographic examination showed that the compressor blade had failed by fatigue. The fatigue crack had initiated at the fillet of the blade <b>mounting</b> <b>lug.</b> Fatigue cracks were found present at the fillet of all four mounting lugs of this blade. Similar cracks were also noticed in two more blades adjacent to the fractured blade. It was established that the stress raisers arising due to absence of fillet radius was the primary reason for the fatigue crack initiation. The blade material and the microstructure were found to conform to specification. A detailed analysis of the failure is presented in this report...|$|E
50|$|The MBV-78-A2 {{is a small}} {{cylindrical}} Vietnamese anti-personnel fragmentation stake mine. It is {{unrelated to}} the MBV-78-A1. The mine has a large plastic head which contains the main charge wrapped around the detonator. A fragmentation layer of steel pieces set into wax surrounds the main charge. The plastic head has two <b>mounting</b> <b>lugs</b> for stake <b>mounting</b> the mine. A Vietnamese copy of the Russian MUV fuze is typically used with the mine, although other fuzes could be used.|$|R
50|$|The Model 605A CAR-15 Carbine was a {{shortened}} {{version for}} situations where longer weapons could be unwieldy, such as aboard vehicles or helicopters. The only significant {{change from the}} M16 rifle was that the barrel was shortened to 15 in in length, so that it ended just forward of the front sight base. Because of the shorter barrel, no bayonet <b>mounting</b> <b>lugs</b> were provided. One prototype used a shorter handguard and a 16 in long barrel.|$|R
50|$|Another {{variant of}} the SPW {{requested}} by the US Special Operations Forces is the Mk 46 Mod 0 that incorporates a lightweight fluted barrel but lacks the magazine feed system, vehicle <b>mounting</b> <b>lugs</b> and carry handle. A railed forearm ensures modularity and mission-adaptability permitting the use of flashlights, vertical grips, and infrared laser designators. An improved variant known as the Mk 46 Mod 1 with an improved forward rail and lightweight titanium bipod has been adopted by the United States Navy.|$|R
40|$|A {{fractured}} MGB {{housing and}} a cracked TGB housing {{belonging to a}} helicopter were forwarded to the laboratory for analyzing the causes of failures. The components were made of Mg-alloy of RZ- 5 specification. Investigation revealed that both the components have failed by fatigue. The fatigue crack initiation in the mounting lugs of the MGB housing was stress related. It is believed that the component has experienced unexpected high loads at these mounting locations, probably due to some abnormalities in the gearbox. However, {{this needs to be}} ascertained by detailed examination of the gearbox components. The fatigue crack initiation in the TGB housing was due to high stress concentration arising from a thin edge at the fillet region. The fatigue crack initiation was also facilitated because of wide difference in the length of the webs of the <b>mounting</b> <b>lug,</b> which was caused due to incorporation of a temperature sensor-locating boss at this location. It is recommended that the design aspects of the lug be reviewed for a possible relocation of the temperature sensor-locating boss to a non-critical region or isolation of the boss from the attachment lug. ...|$|E

5|$|This is {{a variant}} of the special purpose weapon adopted by USSOCOM. The program, which led to both the Mk 46 and Mk 48, was headed by the US Naval Special Warfare Command (NAVSPECWAR). Like the SPW, the barrel {{changing}} handle, magazine insertion well, and vehicle <b>mounting</b> <b>lugs</b> have been removed to save weight. However, the Mk 46 retains the standard M249 plastic buttstock instead of the collapsible buttstock used on the SPW. The Picatinny rail forearm differs slightly from the SPW. The Mk 46 has the option of using the lighter SPW barrel or a thicker, fluted barrel of the same length.|$|R
50|$|Electric motors {{became so}} common that Singer made {{provision}} for them: the model 127/128 'modernized' versions included <b>mounting</b> <b>lugs</b> for a motor, whereas earlier models {{had to be}} drilled and tapped. Some 127/128 machines were even given motors right at the factory, and of those, a few models used a smaller lighter solid handwheel instead of the larger heavier spoked handwheel used on machines sold as treadles. The spoked handwheel is better for treadles because its larger inertia keeps it spinning longer, whereas the lighter solid handwheel is better for motors because its smaller inertia causes it to start and stop more quickly.|$|R

40|$|The TGB housing had a 14 mm long {{fatigue crack}} at the fillet of the lug fusing area {{of one of}} the <b>mounting</b> <b>lugs.</b> Examination {{revealed}} that the fatigue crack initiation was due to presence of a mechanical stress raiser at the fillet.

50|$|Mid-'77 {{the front}} forks {{had a major}} redesign, fork tube {{diameter}} increased from 34 to 35 mm and internals were changed (although this also holds true for various years of the same tube size). The entire fork assembly (with triple tree) will swap either way but fork parts are not equivalent. Also the brake caliper changed from a 48 mm dual piston cast iron design for the 34 mm fork to a 40 mm aluminum single piston floating caliper for the 35 mm forks. The brake caliper <b>mounting</b> <b>lugs</b> on the fork sliders are of different spacing for the 34 mm and 35 mm forks so the calipers can't be swapped.|$|R

5000|$|The 539 {{engine was}} {{developed}} {{in response to the}} perceived drawback that Alco's line of diesel switchers had a restricted field of vision because of the high hood. Both Baldwin and EMC were offering diesel switchers with a lower engine hood that the trainmen could see over. The 539 engine was developed from the 538 engine, both had the same cylinder dimensions. The engine base of the 538 was flat and rode on a flat underframe. The change that the 539 offered was to lower the base of the engine into the frame. This was done with revised <b>mounting</b> <b>lugs</b> and a modified oil pan. The modified 538 became known as the 539 and the change allowed the engine hood to be lowered two feet three inches.|$|R
40|$|A tunable {{metallic}} {{photonic crystal}} filter has been fabricated by deep {{reactive ion etching}} of a silicon substrate followed by metallization. The filter plate’s two-layer orthogonal grid structure and integrated <b>mounting</b> <b>lugs</b> were fabricated from a single silicon wafer in two etching steps. A three-step metallization process (evaporation, sputtering, and electroplating) ensured all surfaces were coated with gold to greater than 4. 6 times the skin depth at the frequencies of interest. The filter employs a mechanical tuning mechanism, the performance of which was predicted with rigorous full-vector electromagnetic simulations (finite-difference time domain). The prototype has been characterized at frequencies of 70 – 150 GHz using free-space measurement techniques.
