Effective from 2014 to 2020, the National <b>Indicative</b> <b>Programme</b> defines measurable objectives and target groups, initiatives for meeting those benchmarks, the nature and scope of supporting mechanisms, donor contribution(s), expected outcomes, and an implementation timetable. In the context of Somalia, the NIP is officially aligned with the priorities and objectives outlined in the New Deal Compact of 2013. According to Ahmed, Commissioner Piebalgs agreed to empower and directly support the Somali federal government's main public functions through multi-partner funds. He also suggested that this could encourage EU member states to fulfill the commitments that they had made to Somalia. Additionally, the EU Special Envoy Michele Cervone d'Urso indicated that the European Union has pledged 286 million EUR (400 million USD) toward the ongoing reconstruction process in Somalia, and that the National <b>Indicative</b> <b>Programme</b> serves as a realization of the country's recent accession to the Cotonou Agreement. In 2014, 100 million EUR from the 11th European Development Fund (EDF) and the Stability Instrument are to be set aside for institutionalization, peace building, and humanitarian and educational support. The mechanisms within the Somali Development and Reconstruction Facility (SDRF) are also slated to be used to carry out programs wherever necessary.|$|R

Between 2003 and 2007, the EU committed round €33 million to the Water Supply Programme to Regional Centres, jointly financed by German financial cooperation. The main objective of the programme was to improve the access to sustainable quality water supply and wastewater management services in the three regional centres of Mwanza, Iringa and Mbeya. Further funds of about €6.6 million were provided for the Mwanza Sewerage Rehabilitation Project between 2000 and 2004, whose aim was to prevent the overflow of raw sewage from Mwanza to Lake Victoria. Rural water and sanitation is supported through the EU general budget line for co-financing NGOs in developing countries.|$|R
30|$|To {{enhance their}} {{attractiveness}} as investment recipients, the EU seeks to advance Central Asian states’ financial stability and economic reforms {{as well as}} their further integration in the world economic and financial systems (Kuzmina, 2014 : p. 7). Accordingly, in its policies toward Central Asia, the bloc, as the <b>indicative</b> <b>programmes</b> of its Development Cooperation Instrument suggest (European Commission, 2007, 2011, 2014), primarily concentrates on the furtherance of regional collaboration and good neighbourly relations, improvement of living standards and lessening of poverty as well as energy, environmental and water projects. Incidentally, the 2007 Strategy also mentions human rights and democratisation as dimensions of the EU’s activities, but they are coupled with good governance (Council of the EU, 2007 : pp. 7 – 9), to which the EU, as some researchers argue, tends to give priority. Meden (2012 : p. 59), for instance, points out that Brussels is shifting its focus from democracy promotion to fight against corruption, on paper, however, continuing to demand democratisation. Likewise, (Bossuyt and Kubicek, 2015 : p. 178) note that the budget of the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights for Central Asia is relatively scarce and {{within the framework of the}} Development Cooperation Instrument, 60 – 90 % of aid is devoted to poverty reduction, economic reforms and good governance.|$|R

On 19 th November it signed a regional strategy document for a € 223 million programme for 2002 - 2007 with the Eastern, Southern African and Indian Ocean region. Under the focal area of 'economic integration and trade' {{emphasis is placed}} on the 'fostering of the free-trade area and the future creation of a customs union'. This is seen as important for enhancing the region's competitiveness and attracting investment. It also signed a similar regional co-operation strategy with the Southern African Development Community worth € 101 million, again focussing on economic integration and trade. On the same day a regional co-operation strategy worth € 55 million was also signed with Central Africa. Comment: The new regional <b>indicative</b> <b>programme</b> for Southern Africa signed with SADC shows a decline in the aid allocation to the region and an increased emphasis on economic integration and trade, with around 40 % of the total allocation being earmarked for this sector. This reflects the shift in the EU's emphasis from support for functional programmes of regional co-operation towards integration in preparation for the introduction of EPAS.

40|$|The European Union' TACIS {{programme}} {{was established}} to support the New Independent States since 1991. One priority for TACIS funding is nuclear safety. For TACIS, the European Commission (EC) Directorate General External Relations {{is responsible for the}} <b>Indicative</b> <b>Programmes</b> whilst the EC-EuropeAid Co-operation Office is in charge of identifying and implementing all the assistance projects through the Annual Programmes. In these programmes, EC-Joint Research Center (JRC) is the Technical & Scientific adviser of above mentioned EC Directorates. During the years of Tacis assistance activities in nuclear safety quite a few programs were dedicated to the Reactor Pressure Vessel (RPV) embrittlement issue. The ageing of the RPV was of special concern due to the faster than expected neutron irradiation embrittlement of the core region weld of the VVER 440 NPPs and some shortcomings of the RPV surveillance program in VVER 1000 NPPs. Most of the Tacis ageing projects were so far dedicated to studying the RPV embrittelement and integrity issue. In this paper highlights from some completed Tacis projects on the RPV embrittelment and integrity issue have been selected and briefly described. The situation regarding the ongoing Tareg 2. 01 / 00 project “Validation of neutron embrittlement for VVER 1000 & VVER 440 RPVs, with emphasis on integrity assessment” and the its twin project Tareg 2. 01 / 03 “Neutron irradiation embrittlement assessment and validation of embrittlement models for VVER Reactor pressure vessels” are also presented.

40|$|Approval of a € 50 million trade-related {{assistance}} programme for ACP countries was {{announced by the}} European Commission on July 25 th 2003. The aim of the programme, {{which is to be}} implemented over a six-year period, is to create the necessary capacities in ACP countries so that they can benefit from increased trading opportunities. Commenting on the programme, the EU Trade Commissioner Pascal Lamy said 'we need to ensure that the benefits from better trading opportunities translate into growth and development'. He spoke explicitly about sending the right signals to developing countries ahead of the Cancun WTO Ministerial. Commissioner Lamy emphasised that trade assistance is a key element of the EU-ACP EPA currently being negotiated. The trade-{{assistance programme}} is identified as important in enhancing ACP participation in trade negotiations, integrating trade into development strategies, ensuring that goods are produced to the requisite international standards and promoting ACP capacity to export. There are three main components to this trade. com programme: strengthening local capacities to formulate trade policies, while encouraging the participation of all stakeholders in the process; assistance for ongoing trade negotiations by establishing a unique network of ACP trade experts (this component is known as a 'hub and spoke' programme with the secondment of senior advisors - the hub - to regional organisations, and experts in national ministries -the spokes); funding of pilot projects to address institutional and supply-side constraints with a special emphasis on enabling ACP countries to meet technical standards and sanitary and phyto-sanitary requirements, which the Commission acknowledged 'represent a major obstacle to improving their export performance'. Comment: The funds committed represent an average of less than € 660, 000 per ACP country for trade related technical assistance With an implementation period of six years this represents only € 110, 000 per annum per ACP country. This project gives concrete expression to the commitment made in Doha to provide ACP countries with trade-related technical assistance. While the EU highlights the importance of trade assistance to ACP countries {{in the context of the}} EPA negotiations, it should be noted that only 0. 1 % of allocations made to NIPs (National <b>Indicative</b> <b>Programmes)</b> in ACP countries totalling € 6, 242. 6 million, is deployed in support of trade-development programmes (a total of just over € 6 million).

30|$|The {{third factor}} {{relates to the}} EU’s {{perception}} of and interest in Kazakhstan. One significant aspect of this factor is the relative unimportance of Kazakhstan for the bloc, which is {{a manifestation of the}} EU’s general treatment of Central Asia, 14 the region that Kavalski and Cho describe as “[a] ghost[] in the vacuum of the EU’s external affairs” (2017 : p. 3) and “merely a bridge (if not—quite literally—a mere refueling station) between the EU’s other and strategically more important commitments” (ibid: p. 4). On the one hand, such may appear puzzling, given that the EU—unlike the US, Russia and China—possesses a well-defined long-term formal strategy which delineates its priorities in Central Asia. Yet, because of the region’s distance from the EU, both in geographical and political terms—in the 1990 s, Brussels remarkably perceived it as a Russian sphere of influence—as well as integration-related problems inside the bloc and problematic interstate relations in Central Asia, the bloc’s policies in that region tend to be, as Kavalski and Cho put it, “lack[ing] focus” and “largely reactive” (ibid: p. 4; see also Kuzmina, 2014 : p. 4). A good manifestation of this point is that fact that the EU elaborated a common strategy toward the region only in 2007, sixteen years after the Soviet Union’s break-up. 15 The Strategy’s adoption itself was, as phrased by Voloshin (2014 : pp. 43 – 44), “a concerted attempt to recalibrate the EU’s ties on a modified basis where realism and idealism no longer contradict each other”. Such reflects the bloc’s failure to view democracy promotion in Central Asia as its moral duty (Kavalski and Cho, 2017 : p. 4)—all the more so because its current priority in this respect is the Western Balkans (ibid: p. 10) 16 and because EU members generally feel Central Asia lacks breading ground for democratisation (Bossuyt, 2016). In this light, {{it comes as no surprise}} that the EU allocates relatively scarce resources on the region’s democratisation (Voloshin, 2014 : p. 45), the mission of the EU’s Special Representative for Central Asia is, as Kavalski and Cho (2017 : p. 10) put it, “understaffed and underfunded” and in general, the bloc mostly opts to deal with the region “together [through] coordination among international structures” (quoted in ibid). 17 Also, with respect to various EU documents on Central Asia, such as the 2007 Strategy and <b>Indicative</b> <b>Programme,</b> the 1999 PCA, the new EPCA etc., researchers widely point out that they mostly contain general phrases, being vague on specific actions concerning democracy and human rights and failing to clarify conditions linking EU assistance to compliance with democratic norms (Hug and Zhang, 2010 : p. 4; Tsertsvadze and Axyonova, 2013 : p. 2; Voloshin, 2014 : p. 46; Bossuyt and Kubicek, 2015 : p. 178). Interestingly, that the EU treats Central Asia as a region of secondary significance seems to epitomise a larger trend, beneficial for the Nazarbayev regime. Indeed, while China and Russia are mainly involved in a rivalry with the West in East/Southeast Asia and Eastern Europe correspondingly, Kazakhstan finds itself in an opportune position of a country with which major powers want to collaborate, simultaneously paying relatively little attention to it.|$|R
40|$|Within the {{international}} security context, the Prevention and mitigation of Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) hazards {{has become an}} important area of activities. EU is contributing to {{the international}} community effort to mitigate the threat and risks associated with these materials. The EU CBRN Action Plan (AP) was adopted in December 2009. The AP aims to strengthen CBRN security throughout the EU. Based on an all-hazard approach, the AP's overall goal is to reduce the threat of, and damage from CBRN incidents of accidental, natural and intentional origin, including terrorist acts. The AP contributes to the implementation of the EU Counter Terrorism Strategy and provides for three main areas of CBRN security work: Prevention, Detection, Preparedness and response. A total of 124 actions are to be implemented by the EU Member States and the EU Institutions. In addition to 25 actions relating to radiological and nuclear security, there are 32 actions covering biological or chemical security. A further 67 actions are horizontal actions {{in the sense that they}} apply to more than one area. The implementation of the Action Plan is guided by consultation with national authorities and other relevant stakeholders. The IAEA, Interpol, and Europol are closely associated to the implementation of the Action Plan. Outside EU border, the Instrument for Stability in its <b>Indicative</b> <b>Programme</b> 2009 - 2011 identifies “capacity building against CBRN threats” as a necessary condition for risk mitigation and preparedness. Effective response to CBRN risk depends on cooperation and co-ordination between all levels of government, response organizations and international partners. An effective strategy to deal with the CBRN threat requires a very high level of co-operation and co-ordination among many different authorities within and among countries. Therefore, the EU launched in 2010 the 'EU CBRN risk mitigation – Centres of Excellence initiative'. The overall scope of the initiative is hence to strengthen the long-term national and regional capabilities of responsible authorities and administrative infrastructures, and develop a durable cooperation legacy in the fight against the CBRN threat. JRC is supporting the EC DG DEVCO in the technical implementation of the CBRN CoE initiative through activities such as the analysis of CBRN needs and project proposals of partner country/region, Preparation of terms of references for selected projects, follow-up and quality control of projects, management of the IT tools (website, databases); as well as communication and coordination between all stakeholders. The JRC has long-standing experience and expertise in the field of nuclear security and safeguards in support to EURATOM, the IAEA and to implementation of EU projects under TACIS (Technical Assistance to Commonwealth of Independent States), Instrument for Nuclear Safety Cooperation and Instrument for Stability. It was logical that JRC have been attributed several RN actions of the EU CBRN AP and also the technical implementation of the CBRN CoE Initiative. In this paper, we will highlight some of the activities of JRC in support to the implementation of the EU CBRN AP as well as the role and activities of JRC under the CBRN CoE initiative. JRC.

40|$|Robust {{forecasts}} {{are vital}} {{in providing a}} comprehensive Flood Warning Service to people and businesses at risk from flooding. For fluvial flood forecasting, rainfall-runoff, flow routing and hydraulic models are often combined into model cascades and are run automatically in the Environment Agency’s National Flood Forecasting System (NFFS). However, it is widely known that the accuracy of flood forecasts can be influenced {{by a number of}} factors, such as the accuracy of input data, and the model structure, parameters and state (initial conditions). Having a sound understanding of these modelling uncertainties is vital to assess and improve the flood forecasting service that the Environment Agency provides. This report presents the implementation plan developed during Phase 3 of the project SC 080030 “Risk-based Probabilistic Fluvial Flood Forecasting for Integrated Catchment Models”. The main aim of the project is to develop and test practical probabilistic methods to quantify and, where possible, reduce uncertainties around fluvial flood forecasts from sources other than predicted rainfall. The project started in November 2008 and will complete in 2010. The Plan provides suggestions on the steps required to incorporate the probabilistic fluvial flood forecasting techniques developed during the project into existing forecasting systems (NFFS), and makes recommendations on which other improvements may be necessary to achieve this. Some factors which were considered in developing this Plan included: • The Environment Agency’s Implementing Probabilistic Forecasting Programme (IPFF) • Priorities of regional teams involved in parallel running/pilot tests • Current/planned NFFS developments • NFFS development/update cycle • Cost of implementation • Staff resources for implementation • Current/planned R&D projects • Current/planned computer hardware/software upgrades • Third-party dependencies/involvement (e. g. for hydrodynamic models) The Plan also includes an <b>indicative</b> prioritised <b>programme</b> of necessary works and staff resources to introduce probabilistic fluvial flood forecasting into NFFS on a risk basis. Suggestions are also made for how the most benefit from the project outputs and from the proposed techniques can be derived. The suggestions made could then inform the national approach to implementing probabilistic forecasting within the Environment Agency more generally. ...|$|R

Country Projects between National Dental Associations (NDAs), the member associations of FDI, and Unilever Oral Care local companies have been established as a key strand of the partnership. Aim: This paper reports on the evaluation of an in-depth sample of Country Projects (n = 5) to determine their potential to impact on oral health. Method: Five country sites were selected as being <b>indicative</b> of different <b>programme</b> delivery types. Each site received a two-day visit during Spring-Summer 2009, which enabled the evaluators to audit what was delivered in practice compared with the original written project briefs and to undertake interviews of study site staff. Results: 39 projects in 36 countries have been initiated. In those examined by site visits, clear evidence was found of capacity building to deliver oral health. In some countries, widespread population reach had been prioritised. Effectiveness of partnership working varied depending on the strength {{of the relationship between the}} NDA and local Unilever Oral Care representatives and alignment with national marketing strategy. The quality of internal evaluation varied considerably. Conclusions: Over a million people had been reached directly by Country Projects and this public private partnership has made a successful start.

Covering the period of 2006 to 2010, the second <b>Indicative</b> Cooperation <b>Programme</b> (ICP) aligned Luxembourg’s {{interventions}} with Vietnam’s five-year Socio-Economic Development Plan and supported, with a budget of 50 million EUR, development policies and strategies to achieve the MDGs of the Vietnamese government. Under the overall objective of poverty reduction, the second ICP paid special attention to assisting the poorest provinces and most remote districts.With a budget of 42 million EUR, the third ICP (2011-2015) has a twofold approach. Poverty reduction remains the main objective, support through programmes in social sectors, namely health and local development. In addition the needs and new challenges faced by a middle income country are addressed through an increased focus on capacity building and human resource development in the banking and finance sector {{as well as in}} the vocational training sector including tourism and hospitality. With health, local development and vocational training as priority sectors and with a concentration of activities in the four provinces of Thua Thien Hue, Cao Bang, Bac Kan and Nghe An, the third ICP identifies the same priorities as the previous programme.If the current ICP is a continuity of previous interventions, it constitutes also a consolidation of Luxembourg’s support and aims at diversifying relations between the two countries. With the achievement of the status of a middle income country, enhanced international and regional integration and with continued industrialisation, the needs of Vietnam in terms of international assistance have been changing. Luxembourg adapts its development cooperation accordingly and proposes further support in the field of green growth, capacity building in the finance and banking sector {{as well as in the}} sector of medical research. As the implementation of these activities can rely on specific expertise based in Luxembourg, they constitute adequate means to a transition to stronger and diversified relations beyond development cooperation between the two countries.The third ICP also takes into consideration recent developments in the field of aid effectiveness.A stronger emphasis on cooperation with the private sector is carried out through interventions in the banking and finance sector whereas local development projects aim at close cooperation with civil society and community based organisations. The ICP also includes a variety of aid modalities such as more programme oriented approaches in the health sector, a delegated cooperation to the health sector support programme implemented by the European Commission and collaboration with UN agencies. 20% of the financial envelope of ICP III is dedicated to multilateral projects targeting the same sectors as the bilateral projects, in order to strengthen synergies and to increase their impact. The Luxembourg development cooperation contributes to the One UN Fund (2012-2016) which directly supports the implementation of the One UN Plan in Vietnam. It also works directly with five UN agencies in Vietnam: UNCTAD, UN Women, UNICEF, ILO and UNESCO.A mid-term evaluation of the current ICP, conducted in June 2014, underlined the important and visible results and impacts reached by Luxembourg’s development cooperation and its Vietnamese partners on provincial level, be it in strengthening health care in Cao Bang and Bac Kan provinces, in improving income of vulnerable groups in remote areas of Nghe An province, in providing high standard vocational training for tourism and hospitality students in Hue Tourism College and associated schools and in supporting the Vietnam States Securities Commission in creating a better environment for foreign investors. The evaluation also drew conclusions on the need to further diversify relations between the two countries.|$|R
