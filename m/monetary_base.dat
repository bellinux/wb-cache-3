25|$|Monetarists {{follow the}} {{explanation}} given by Milton Friedman and Anna J. Schwartz. They {{argue that the}} Great Depression {{was caused by the}} banking crisis that caused one-third of all banks to vanish, a reduction of bank shareholder wealth and more importantly monetary contraction by 35%. This caused a price drop by 33% (deflation). By not lowering interest rates, by not increasing the <b>monetary</b> <b>base</b> and by not injecting liquidity into the banking system to prevent it from crumbling the Federal Reserve passively watched the transforming of a normal recession into the Great Depression. Friedman argued that the downward turn in the economy, starting with the stock market crash, would merely have been an ordinary recession if the Federal Reserve had taken aggressive action.|$|E
25|$|The Swedish Riksbank was the world's first central bank, {{created in}} 1668. Many nations {{followed}} suit {{in the late}} 1600s to establish central banks which were given the legal power to set the reserve requirement, and to specify the form in which such assets (called the <b>monetary</b> <b>base)</b> are required to be held. In order to mitigate the impact of bank failures and financial crises, central banks were also granted the authority to centralize banks' storage of precious metal reserves, thereby facilitating transfer of gold {{in the event of}} bank runs, to regulate commercial banks, impose reserve requirements, and to act as lender-of-last-resort if any bank faced a bank run. The emergence of central banks reduced the risk of bank runs which is inherent in fractional-reserve banking, and it allowed the practice to continue as it does today.|$|E
500|$|In 1898, Knut Wicksell {{proposed}} a monetary theory centered on interest rates. His analysis used two rates: the market interest rate, {{determined by the}} banking system, and the real or [...] "natural" [...] interest rate, determined by the {{rate of return on}} capital. In Wicksell's theory, cumulative inflation will occur when technical innovation causes the natural rate to rise or when the banking system allows the market rate to fall. Cumulative deflation occurs under the opposite conditions causing the market rate to rise above the natural. Wicksell's theory did not produce a direct relationship between the quantity of money and price level. According to Wicksell, money would be created endogenously, without an increase in quantity of hard currency, as long as the natural exceeded the market interest rate [...] In these conditions, borrowers turn a profit and deposit cash into bank reserves, which expands money supply. This can lead to a cumulative process where inflation increases continuously without an expansion in the <b>monetary</b> <b>base.</b> Wicksell's work influenced Keynes and the Swedish economists of the Stockholm School.|$|E

40|$|World {{reserves}} {{have almost}} tripled since 1968, with world monetary growth accelerating since 1971 and world inflation jumping to double digits in 1974. In {{light of these}} developments, the article looks at whether the stock of world reserves has grown so rapidly that it may generate further world inflation, {{or whether it is}} deficient and potentially deflationary. The author first reviews the expansion of global reserves in the 1968 - 73 period of fixed exchange rates and the recent acceleration of inflation. A comparison of the transitional and permanent effects of floating rates on the demand for international reserves, excess reserves, monetary growth and world inflation is then presented and the impact of gold prices on the <b>monetary</b> <b>bases,</b> growth and inflation is taken up. Finally, OPEC’s accumulation of foreign assets {{and its impact on the}} <b>monetary</b> <b>bases</b> of individual countries is considered, as well as other influences on world liquidity.

2500|$|The <b>monetary</b> <b>base</b> {{consists}} of coins and Federal Reserve Notes in circulation outside the Federal Reserve Banks and the U.S. Treasury, plus deposits held by depository institutions at Federal Reserve Banks.

Eight times a year, the 12-person Federal Open Market Committee meets to determine U.S. monetary policy. [...] Every business day, the Federal Reserve System engages in Open market operations to carry out that monetary policy.

2500|$|He {{was also}} {{known to have}} been the {{decision}} maker in who was the head boss of the Mexican cartels. He justified these actions by saying in private meetings that [...] "he felt they could do their best in picking the better of the bad apples". These events, along {{with the fact that he}} was linked to personally overseeing who ran the heads of each Mexican cartel, together with the increasing current account deficit fostered by government spending, caused alarm among Mexican and foreign T-bill (tesobono) investors, who sold them rapidly, thereby depleting the already-low central bank reserves (which eventually hit a record low of $9billion). The economically orthodox thing to do, in order to maintain the fixed exchange rate (at 3.3 pesos per dollar, within a variation band), would have been to sharply increase interest rates by allowing the <b>monetary</b> <b>base</b> to shrink, as dollars were being withdrawn from the reserves. Given the fact that it was an election year, whose outcome might have changed as a result of a pre-election-day economic downturn, the Bank of Mexico decided to buy Mexican Treasury Securities in order to maintain the <b>monetary</b> <b>base,</b> and thus prevent the interest rates from rising. This, in turn, caused an even more dramatic decline in the dollar reserves. These decisions aggravated the already delicate situation, to a point at which a crisis became inevitable and devaluation was only one of many necessary adjustments.

2500|$|In late 1818, $4 {{million of}} {{interest}} payments on the bonds previously sold in 1803 {{to pay for}} the [...] "Louisiana Purchase" [...] was due, in either gold or silver, to European investors. The U.S. Government had to get its hands on additional amounts of specie, i.e., silver or gold. As the Government's fiscal agent, the Bank was required to make this payment on behalf of the Government. The Bank was forced to demand that the private commercial banks that had been lent money in the form of [...] "fiat" [...] paper must now repay in specie, which was then sent to Europe to pay the government's creditors.

2500|$|Federal Reserve Notes {{are legal}} tender, {{with the words}} [...] "this note is legal tender for all debts, public and private" [...] printed on each note. They have {{replaced}} United States Notes, which were once issued by the Treasury Department. Federal Reserve Notes are backed by {{the assets of the}} Federal Reserve Banks, which serve as collateral under Section 16. These assets are generally Treasury securities which have been purchased by the Federal Reserve through its Federal Open Market Committee in a process called debt monetizing. This monetized debt can increase the money supply, either with the issuance of new Federal Reserve Notes or with the creation of debt money (deposits). This increase in the <b>monetary</b> <b>base</b> leads to a larger increase in the money supply through fractional-reserve banking as deposits are lent and re-deposited where they form the basis of further loans.|$|E

2500|$|At the {{beginning}} of 1933, {{the last few weeks}} of Hoover's term, the American financial system was paralyzed. The Great Depression was extended by the interventionist policy for four years. Bank crisis caused the serious deflationary pressures. For this phenomenon, Hoover still wanted to stop it. In fact, the worst period of 1932 – the Great Depression had passed, but the recovery was slow and weak. During the financial crisis of 1933 that culminated in the banking holiday in March 1933, a lot of gold flowed out from the Fed, some of them flow out to individuals and companies in the United States. This domestic loss occurred because individuals and businesses like to deposit metal gold into bank deposits or banknotes, some gold flows to foreign countries, and this external loss occurred because foreign investors were worried about the depreciation of the dollar.Roosevelt understands that the traditional political and financial policy cannot save the United States from the [...] "disaster years", he pursued the [...] "New Deal" [...] to attempt {{to make up for the}} United States by administrative means. In the spring and summer of 1933, the Roosevelt government suspended the gold standard. The Emergency Banking Act gave the President the power to control international and domestic gold sports. It also gave the treasury secretary the power to surrender of gold coins and certificates. On April 20, President Roosevelt issued a formal announcement of the moratorium on the gold standard. The announcement prohibited gold exports, and prohibited financial institutions from converting money and deposits into gold coins and ingots. The action prevented the gold outflow. Soon, the Roosevelt government weakened the connection with gold once again. Thomas amendment to the Agricultural Relief Act to the gave to the President power to reduce the dollar's gold content by as much as 50%. The President Roosevelt also used the silver standard instead of gold to exchange dollars, it determined by the price of the bank. In April 1933, Roosevelt decided to abolish the gold standard through the New Deal. He abandoned this traditional monetary policy is mainly due to the big crisis to the original monetary policy failure. And the purpose of his action is to prohibit all exports of gold except for foreign countries, so that the United States can maintain an equal <b>monetary</b> <b>base</b> with the vast majority of countries. The Hoover government stubbornly insisted on using the [...] "sound money" [...] policy who against deficit spending and state relief that only make the economic crisis worsen. Because of this situation Roosevelt forced the implementation of inflation, and used the federal deficit spending to promote employment to enforce relief. The abandon of the gold standard made the Wall Street stock prices quickly increased, Wall Street's stock trading was exceptionally active, with a total of 5 million shares delivered on a day, which is the most active day in the past six months.|$|E
50|$|The Working <b>Monetary</b> <b>Base</b> {{is defined}} as the <b>Monetary</b> <b>Base</b> minus the excess {{reserves}} and should be conceptually understood as the fact that (at least as this instant in time) the excess reserves are not doing anything sort of like deep frozen money and that the working <b>monetary</b> <b>base</b> is only in use. Before the 2008 financial crisis, since excess reserves were small or unimportant; the working <b>monetary</b> <b>base</b> was essentially equivalent to the <b>monetary</b> <b>base.</b> Much recent economic work seems to indicate that the inflationary impact of the working <b>monetary</b> <b>base</b> is normal while the excess reserves have little current inflationary impact as general fears of hyper inflation have plagued economic columns since the balance sheet explosion.
