5|$|By {{the early}} 1990s, compact discs were making {{significant}} headway as a storage medium {{for music and}} video games. NEC {{had been the first}} to use compact disc technology in a video game console with their PC Engine CD-ROM² System add-on in October 1988 in Japan (launched in North America as the TurboGrafx-CD the following year), which sold 80,000 units in six months. That same year, Nintendo announced a partnership with Sony to develop its own CD-ROM peripheral for the Super NES. Commodore International released their CD-based CDTV <b>multimedia</b> <b>system</b> centered in early 1991, while long-in-waiting CD-i from Philips finally arrived towards the end of that year.|$|E
25|$|Katz Media {{originally}} intended to produce two configurations of the Pippin: one as a basic <b>multimedia</b> <b>system</b> for running CD-ROM titles, and a higher-end system supporting Internet access. The goal was to start shipping Pippin units in November 1996, but Katz Media didn't actually start shipping product until March 1997; it ended up producing only one model of the Pippin – the Pippin KMP 2000. The KMP 2000 was available in two configurations: with or without an external 50-pin SCSI interface {{on the back of}} the unit.|$|E

40|$|The {{real-time}} community {{tends to}} contend that <b>multimedia</b> <b>systems</b> are indeed real-time <b>systems,</b> while the <b>multimedia</b> community points to {{problems such as}} video databases on disks and dynamic environments as issues unique to <b>multimedia</b> <b>systems.</b> Also, historically, real-time and <b>multimedia</b> <b>systems</b> have had different roots, and therefore embody different schools of thought. In this paper, we consider {{the similarities and differences}} between hard real-time <b>systems</b> and <b>multimedia</b> <b>systems.</b> We argue that <b>multimedia</b> <b>systems</b> do exhibit new requirements but that many of the insights and techniques developed for real-time systems can be fruitfully applied to the design and implementation of <b>multimedia</b> <b>systems.</b> We then propose augmenting the hard real-time system framework with mechanisms to support the dynamic nature of <b>multimedia</b> <b>systems.</b> As a matter of fact, {{one of the goals of}} the Real-Time Mach operating system being developed at Carnegie Mellon University is to be able to support both hard re [...] ...|$|R

2500|$|At a {{media event}} on February 28, 2011, Holden {{unveiled}} the Australian assembled Cruze sedan in facelifted [...] "Series II" [...] guise, {{otherwise known as}} the JH series. Prime Minister Julia Gillard attended the February launch to drive the first example off Holden's production line before full-scale production commenced in March. Holden has confirmed an initial local content level of between 40 and 50percent if assessed by retail value, with an aim of increasing Cruze localization over time. Series II styling revisions to the grille, lower air intake, and bumper have softened the front-end to bear a closer resemblance to Holden's larger VE II Commodore. Further differentiation from the original has been achieved via the fitment of amber front indicator lights, jewelled bezel headlamps, remodelled wheel trims, and through adjustments to the lower portion of the rear bumper. Carrying over largely unchanged is the 1.8-liter petrol inline-four, tweaked to yield slight enhancements in drivability. When automatic transmission is specified, the 1.8-liter is now teamed with GM's six-speed 6T30 unit, lighter and more compact than the previous 6T40. Diesel remains optional for [...] "CD" [...] and [...] "CDX" [...] specifications over the standard 1.8-liter petrol. Alterations to the 2.0-liter turbodiesel have resulted in an additional [...] and [...] and a slight reduction in fuel consumption for the manual variant, now a six-speed unit. However, the headline change is {{the release of the}} turbocharged 1.4-liter engine, dubbed iTi by Holden for intelligent turbo induction. The inclusion of the 1.4 also brings an upgrade to electric (as opposed to hydraulic) power steering and affixes a Watt's linkage to the torsion beam rear suspension. Linked with six-speed manual or automatic transmissions, the 1.4 is fitted as standard to the new [...] "SRi" [...] and [...] "SRi-V" [...] sports-oriented trims, but is available at extra cost on the base [...] "CD". The new [...] "SRi" [...] and [...] "SRi-V" [...] models have their respective badges embossed onto the grille insert, are fitted with their own front bumper design, and feature side skirts, chrome exterior door handles, a rear lip spoiler, and five-spoke 17-inch alloy wheels. Over the [...] "CD", [...] "SRi" [...] gains a leather-covered steering wheel rim and shift lever, with the [...] "SRi-V" [...] extending this upholstering to the seating. A heat function for the front seats, keyless entry with push-button engine start, reversing sensors, and seven-inch LCD multimedia unit are also part of the [...] "SRi-V" [...] equipment list. This <b>multimedia</b> <b>system</b> integrates satellite navigation, the CD and DVD players, and a 10GB internal hard disk drive. In mid-November 2011, Holden released the MY12 update to the Series II Cruze. This update coincided with the release of the hatchback body variant and saw Bluetooth telephone connectivity standard across the range.|$|E
