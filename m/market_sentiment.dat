5000|$|The Acertus <b>Market</b> <b>Sentiment</b> Indicator (AMSI) is a stock <b>market</b> <b>sentiment</b> {{indicator}} that generates monthly sentiment indications ranging from 0 (extreme fear) to 100 (extreme greed). [...] The indicator views sentiment as a continuum with anxiety and complacency representing less extreme and nuanced forms {{of fear and}} greed, respectively. Generally, a lower reading (< 20) reflects a <b>market</b> <b>sentiment</b> of fear, while readings of 20-40 represent anxiety. Conversely, a higher reading (>80) suggests significant greed, while readings of 60-80 represent complacency.|$|E
50|$|If investors expect upward price {{movement}} in the stock market, the sentiment {{is said to be}} bullish. On the contrary, if the <b>market</b> <b>sentiment</b> is bearish, most investors expect downward {{price movement}}. <b>Market</b> <b>sentiment</b> is usually considered as a contrarian indicator: what most people expect is a good thing to bet against. <b>Market</b> <b>sentiment</b> is used because it is believed to be a good predictor of market moves, especially when it is more extreme. Very bearish sentiment is usually followed by the market going up more than normal, and vice versa.|$|E

30|$|Based on Shen et al. (2013), Nan (2015) {{calculated}} the squared {{difference between the}} indexes for opposition and support. This led {{to the construction of}} a variable for the degree of divergence in opinions. Similarly, Ackert et al. (2016) manually set up keywords reflecting bullish or bearish <b>market</b> <b>sentiments</b> and then used a program to identify the <b>market</b> <b>sentiments</b> reflected in the posts, thereby building an indicator for trends in <b>market</b> <b>sentiments.</b>|$|R
30|$|With the {{exception}} of Mao et al. (2012), who examined {{the correlation between the}} number of posts and stock market from the levels of individual stocks, industries, and indexes, most other scholars who have used Twitter’s big data for research have focused only on indicators of <b>market</b> <b>sentiments.</b> Sprenger et al. (2014 b) collected Twitter data related to listed companies, used the Naive Bayes algorithm for text classification of <b>market</b> <b>sentiments,</b> and constructed a daily overall indicator to reflect those sentiments. Sul et al. (2016) collated information in tweets related to listed companies, examined the text contents, and determined <b>market</b> <b>sentiments</b> by analyzing the lexical categories (parts of speech) using the Harvard-IV dictionary. The authors similarly established a daily overall indicator of <b>market</b> <b>sentiments.</b>|$|R
30|$|Besides the Naive Bayes method, some {{scholars}} have used the maximum entropy method for text classification. Zhang and Swanson (2010) collected data from posts on message boards in Yahoo! Finance that corresponded to 30 U.S. listed companies. The maximum entropy model was used for text classification, leading {{to the construction of}} an indicator for <b>market</b> <b>sentiments.</b> In addition, {{some scholars}} have realized that the reliability ranking of the person who made the post affects the level of trust of other investors regarding its contents. This causes posts to have different weightings within the overall indicator for <b>market</b> <b>sentiments.</b> Hence, it might be more appropriate to use the reliability-weighted average method instead of a simple weighted average method to build the indicator for overall trends in <b>market</b> <b>sentiments.</b>|$|R

30|$|For {{analytical}} purposes, Bartov et al. (2015) constructed four tendency {{indicators of}} <b>market</b> <b>sentiments</b> using the enhanced Naive Bayes classifier, Harvard-IV dictionary, and inventory of lexical categories by Loughran and McDonald (2011). After gathering information from Twitter {{on the numbers}} of posts, fans, and shares, Zhang et al. (2011 a) extracted vocabulary related to the words “hope” and “fear.” He then used the daily frequency of occurrence of such vocabulary as the indicator of <b>market</b> <b>sentiments.</b>|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} novel channel through which the {{volatility}} of the monetary/financial sector affects the instability of the real macroeconomic variables originated by self-fulfilling <b>market</b> <b>sentiments.</b> To this aim, we insert some elements of Prospect Theory in the preferences of agents living in an overlapping generations economy where consumers’ heterogeneity and firms’ imperfect information {{on the level of}} aggregate demand allow <b>market</b> <b>sentiments</b> to affect the equilibrium path of the economy. In this environment, greater heterogeneity in the household’s narrow framing parameter favour the emergence of self-fulfilling equilibria by exacerbating the coordination problem generated by a pair-wise matching process in the labor market. Furthermore, higher volatility of the money market, by increasing the effect of Prospect Theory on households’ choices, makes the signal upon which firms form their demand schedules noisier; this, in its turn, generates greater variability in <b>market</b> <b>sentiments</b> and hence in real economic activity...|$|R
40|$|It {{is often}} said that stock prices are {{determined}} by <b>market</b> <b>sentiments.</b> Also, these stock prices are an instant reflection of the current <b>market</b> <b>sentiments.</b> Despite this, investors often use current news to inform their next investment decision. The problem is then that {{it is almost impossible}} to read through all the news available online. Even with a wealth of readings, <b>market</b> <b>sentiments</b> are difficult to be quantified and understood. This project looks at news from Reuters Technology to be used as sources of data to generate a model to capture <b>market</b> <b>sentiments.</b> This model will be used to try to predict the movements of the NASDAQ Composite in the immediate future. Dataset We scrapped data Reuters to create a model for <b>market</b> <b>sentiments.</b> We will be using yahoo share prices to construct our classifiers, which will be the NASDAQ Composite, which is highly followed in the US as an indicator of the performance of stocks of technology companies and growth companies. (see appendix for screenshot of Reuters Technology) We created 2 separate datasets, one with 1 year of data (260 days of trading) and the second one with 3 years of data (690 days of trading). Note that there are less days of trading than there are in a year due to market closing during weekends as well as during public holidays. Problem Formulation We split the news data from Reuters Technology into headline and body feature sets. We aim to predict, given today’s set of headline and body features, if the closing price of tomorrow’s stock will be higher or lower than today’s, using data from yahoo finance...|$|R
50|$|AMSI is {{constructed}} using five variables. In descending order of weight they are: Price/Earnings Ratio, {{a measure of}} stock market valuations; Price Momentum, a measure of market psychology; Realized Volatility, a measure of recent historical risk; High Yield Bond Returns, a measure of credit risk; and the TED spread, a measure of systemic financial risk. Each of these factors provides a measure of <b>market</b> <b>sentiment</b> through a unique lens, and weighted together they may offer a more robust indicator of <b>market</b> <b>sentiment.</b>|$|E

(2006) calculated the reliability scores for forum users based on the forecast accuracy of their previous posts, creating a reliability-weighted overall indicator for <b>market</b> <b>sentiments.</b> After 2004, some of the data sources (e.g., Yahoo!

The findings were then synthesized to become an indicator for investors’ daily <b>market</b> <b>sentiments.</b> In addition, other scholars have used the event studies method to analyze changes in the stock market performance of listed companies prior and subsequent to the launch of their official Sina microblogs (Jin et al. 2016).|$|R

In addition, the greater the divergence in <b>market</b> <b>sentiments,</b> the larger the stock trading volume. Sprenger et al. (2014 b) demonstrated that sentiments contained in tweets are significantly correlated with stock returns. The greater the number of daily microblogs, the larger the stock trading volume.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to examine the effect of prevailing <b>market</b> <b>sentiments</b> in real estate markets on the stock market response to the outcomes of real estate auctions in Hong Kong. The reactions of stock market to the winners of the auctions have at least two interesting implications. On one hand, the success in acquiring a real estate implies that the developer has acquired a project with potentially positive net present value and the stock price of the developers should rise. Bids on real estate development projects are often based on the developer’s estimate of potential costs and profits. These estimates, when conditioned on the current market information, may be highly influenced by the prevailing <b>market</b> <b>sentiments.</b> The complexity of estimating the development costs may cause the developers to arrive at different estimates and thereby different bids. The prevailing <b>market</b> <b>sentiments</b> in the real estate markets may also affect the bidding behavior of the bidders. During periods when the real estate prices are soaring, the bidders may bid more aggressively against each other. As a result, the successful bidder may be the victim of the “winner’s curse”. If this is the case, investors in the stock market should view this as a factor that negatively affects the stock price of the developer, thus discounting the stock price of the winning firm. The availability of the auction records and the stock prices in Hong Kong provides us an excellent opportunity to test the auction theory and allows us to examine how the stock market evaluates these two counteracting effects. Moreover, we can investigate how <b>market</b> <b>sentiments</b> in the real estate markets may affect the stock market response to the auction winners...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} link between {{investor}} sentiment and stock returns in emerging Asian markets. Two dimensions of sentiment are examined: stock specific <b>sentiment</b> and <b>market</b> wide <b>sentiment.</b> Using panel regression with firm fixed effects, we show that stock specific sentiment strongly and positively affects stock returns after controlling for firm characteristics. Overall, {{there is a positive}} relationship between <b>market</b> wide <b>sentiment</b> and returns but the relationship does not hold at the country level. For individual countries, we detect substantial country-to-country variations in the influence of <b>market</b> wide <b>sentiment</b> on returns. The evidence also suggests that stock specific sentiment may have a greater influence on returns than <b>market</b> specific <b>sentiment.</b> Furthermore, the effect of investor sentiment on stock returns in emerging Asian markets generally persists after accounting for macroeconomic factors...|$|R

40|$|This study {{explores the}} herding {{behavior}} of security analysts, the firm characteristics in attracting herding, {{and the consequences}} of the herding recommendations on returns in China’s stock market. By applying the LSV method, the stock recommendations of analysts are partitioned into buy- and sell-recommendations. The results show that the herding level of sell-recommendation is greater than that of buy-recommendation, which is particularly evident in the bear market. Moreover, investors selling the holdings that analysts herd to recommend “sell” might help avoid losses in the bear market. Notably, when in the bull market, if analysts herd to make sell-recommendations, investors might gain more by acting conversely. These performance variations according to <b>market</b> <b>sentiments</b> appear to be partially explained by a firm’s characteristics based on additional regression analyses and are partially attributed to analysts’ individual attitudes toward <b>market</b> <b>sentiments.</b> </p...|$|R

40|$|We {{construct}} {{a model of}} asset market exuberance, collapse and recovery using subjective investor-based rational expectations {{about the impact of}} fundamentals on the market price.
