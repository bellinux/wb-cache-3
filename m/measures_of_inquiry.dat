40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the effects of a field-based, inquiry-focused geoscience course designed to provide preservice teachers with opportunities for active, hands-on scientific investigation and for gaining skills in inquiry pedagogy. Impact on student learning and attitudes was measured through (a) dependent t-tests comparing pre-and post-measures for students enrolled in the new field course (n = 12) and (b) analysis of covariance comparisons between field course students and education students in the traditional, classroom-based course (n = 12). Results showed that students in the field course scored significantly higher than students in the traditional course on <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> <b>inquiry,</b> confidence for teaching science courses, knowledge building, and cooperative learning. There was no significant difference between the two instructional groups on geoscience content knowledge, indicating that students in the two courses gained an equivalent amount of knowledge. Additionally, although there was no difference in students ’ use of low-level questions, the field class scored significantly higher in high-level questioning. Results provide evidence of the promise of this approach in helping preservice teachers develop the needed skills and content knowledge to create effective and engaging science courses for their students.

40|$|Abstract: Text Concept Mapping (TCM) {{is based}} on {{graphical}} differentiations representing the text's content and structure components, on explicit semantic relations between components, and on an hierarchical organization of the components representing levels of generality and importance. TCM combines graphical organizer ontology with the Language of Thinking (LOT) ontology, proposed by Tishman and Perkins (1997), providing a database of epistemic stance, intellectual processes and products concepts. Effects of using TCM were tested during one school year study (4 classes, 112 eighth graders) : In the first semester, language arts teachers practiced materials, according to an assigned study condition: two classes were taught using concept mapping, one with practicing LOT (TCM class); two classes were taught through regular learning skills program, one also practiced LOT. In the second semester, subject-matter teachers directed a collaborative <b>inquiry</b> process <b>of</b> preparing <b>inquiry</b> projects. The classes were tested on language, mapping, comprehension, and writing skills, {{before and after the}} intervention, and at the end <b>of</b> the year. <b>Inquiry</b> projects were evaluated also at this time. Results indicate an advantage for some <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> LOT, mapping, comprehension, and writing in the TCM class, and also in some <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> the <b>inquiry</b> projects. We propose that TCM is a potent mediator for learning with texts and for conducting complex learning tasks, compared with concept mapping only. ...|$|R

These two contributions led Atkinson and several other authors to argue in favour of the income inequality measures that are derived from social welfare considerations. Departing from this unilateral position, this study introduces a fundamental equation of income, and derives from it a dual relationship between: (I) utility and disutility functions; (II) social welfare and diswelfare functions; and (III) social welfare functions and income inequality measures. The utility, disutility and loss functions corresponding to Gini, Theil, generalized entropy, Atkinson, Zenga and Pareto income inequality measures are also deduced. Thus the fundamental equation of income provides the rationale to {{the determination of the}} social welfare bases of an income inequality measure and conversely, the income inequality bases of a social welfare function. &# 13; &# 13; The probabilistic interpretation of the set of economic units as a sample space and the introduction of the following three principles: (I) the social and individual aversion to poverty; (II) the social aversion to inequality; and (III) the interpersonal comparisons of utility and disutility provide the basic conceptual and methodological structures to the determination and analysis of the utility, disutility and loss functions properties corresponding to the income inequality <b>measures</b> object <b>of</b> <b>inquiry,</b> including their relative sensitivities to income transfers...|$|R
