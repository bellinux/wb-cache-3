The {{purpose of this study is}} to make the overall system for prevention and control of air pollution in China understood by a broader audience by providing an overview of the pertinent legislation, plans, and policies, since such a review has not been presented so far. At the beginning of this article, we clarify the key definitions of legislation, plan, and policy and establish a preliminary analytical framework for evaluating the integration of legislation, plans, and policies. Then we present a variety of pieces of legislation at national, local, and international levels, including the Constitution, national laws, national administrative regulations and departmental rules, and local regulations and rules that were selected because of their direct and close relation to the prevention and control of air pollution, especially particulate matter. We divide the history of legislation since 1956 into four phases: preceding (1956 - 1978), beginning (1979 - 1999), development (2000 - 2013), and improvement (since 2014), putting emphases on changes in legislation in each phase.

We investigated heart rate (HR) and HR variability (HRV) data collected during a 5 -month study involving 6 hr/day, 5 day/week exposures of normal (C 57) mice and a murine model for atherosclerotic disease (ApoE –/ –) in Sterling Forest (Tuxedo, New York, USA). The mice were exposed to concentrated ambient particles (PM 2. 5 concentrated 10 -fold, producing an average of 113 µg/m 3). Daily 6 -hr PM 2. 5 air samples were analyzed by X-ray fluorescence, permitting attribution to major PM source categories [secondary sulfate (SS), resuspended soil (RS), residual oil (RO) combustion, and other, largely due to motor vehicle traffic]. We examined associations between these PM 2. 5 components and both HR and HRV for three different daily time periods: during exposure, the afternoon after exposure, and late at night. For HR there were significant transient associations for RS during exposure, and for SS in the afternoon after exposure. For HRV, there were comparable associations with RO in the afternoon after exposure and for both SS and RS late at night. The biologic bases for these associations and their temporal lags are not known but may be related to the differential solubility of the biologically active PM components at the respiratory epithelia and their access to cells that release mediators that reach the cardiovascular system.

Most attention has focused on electric-drive technologies for light-duty vehicles (LDVs), but some electric-drive technologies are also suitable for heavy-duty vehicle (HDV) applications. HDVs are in fact particularly attractive targets for zero-emission technology because they produce a disproportionate share of <b>motor</b> <b>vehicle</b> <b>pollution</b> in California and the U. S. HDVs are largely based on diesel engine technology, and these diesel engines produce high emission levels of oxides of nitrogen (NOx) and fine particulates (PM 10). PM 10 emissions in particular are increasingly seen as having the most serious health effects of all vehicle pollutants. Furthermore, the vast majority of HDV travel is by heavy-duty trucks (HDTs), but these vehicles are at present less-stringently regulated than urban transit buses (particularly given the recent CARB regulation to reduce urban transit bus emissions beginning in 2002). In order to investigate the potential of stimulating the development of zero-emission HDTs, and their introduction into California-based HDT fleets, this report anlayzes the potential for broadening the ZEV mandate to allow manufacturers of zero-emission HDTs to be awarded ZEV credits. The report analyzes the average relative emission levels of carbon monoxide (CO), hydrocarbons (HCs), NOx, and PM 10 from LDVs and HDTs in California, as estimated in the latest version of the CARB mobile source emission inventory model, EMFAC 2000. Using these estimates of the relative emission reduction potential of zero-emission LDVs and medium and heavy HDTs, along with estimates of the average annual mileage for these vehicle classes, potential ZEV credit award levels for zero-emission HDTs are estimated. The findings are that from 42 to 226 ZEV credits could in principle be justified to be awarded to manufacturers of zero-emission HDTs, depending on the model year of their introduction (from 2001 to 2010) and the HDT weight class, if the four pollutants are weighted according to their approximate relative damage values. These damage values reflect the impact on each pollutant to human health in major California urban areas. Using a simpler scheme that does not consider the relative damages from the pollutants, and that weights each pollutant equally, potential ZEV credit award levels range from 24 to 100 credits for zero-emission HDTs. zero-emission vehicles, trucks, electric drive...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: There {{has been}} {{widespread}} {{concern that the}} increasing incidence of asthma observed during the late 1980 s might have arisen because of environmental pollution, and in particular vehicle pollution. The General Practice Morbidity Survey in 1991 / 92 (MSGP 4) collected data on occupation, employment status, and smoking habit linked individually to each patient record. OBJECTIVES: To examine whether people with occupations that have high exposure to vehicle exhaust fumes have an increased prevalence of asthma, acute respiratory infections, and ischaemic heart disease (IHD). METHOD: Men aged 16 to 64 years were grouped by Standard Occupational Classification codes; 93, 692 employed and 20, 858 not-employed men were studied separately. Those with likely high occupational exposure were grouped together ('all-exposed') [...] the remainder occupations in corresponding chapters of the code were used as controls. We compared 12 -month age and smoking standardised disease prevalence ratios for asthma, {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD), acute respiratory infections (IHD), and all circulatory disorders in the all exposed and individual exposed occupations with their matching controls. Also the mean frequency of consultations per person consulting was calculated for each occupational group and disease. RESULTS: For employed persons, the prevalence ratio (PR) for asthma in the all-exposed, (116, 95 % confidence interval [95 % CI] = 101 - 130) exceeded that for all employed persons (100); however, the difference compared with chapter-matched controls (PR = 97, 95 % CI = 92 - 103), was not statistically significant. Results for COPD were similar. Prevalence ratios in motor mechanics, a high-exposure group, were 98 (95 % CI = 70 - 127) 96 (95 % CI = 70 - 123) for asthma and COPD respectively. Among the employed, prevalence ratios for IHD in {{all but one of the}} individual occupation groups examined did not differ from the average, however among those not employed the ratio in the all-exposed (PR = 152, 95 % CI = 128 - 174) exceeded that in the controls (PR = 112, 95 % CI = 104 - 120). CONCLUSION: Occupational groups exposed to <b>motor</b> <b>vehicle</b> <b>pollution</b> have a marginally increased prevalence of asthma compared with working males generally, though not compared with occupation matched controls.

40|$|It is {{estimated}} that transport sources in developing countries contribute about 4 % of the global fossil carbon dioxide versus 18 % by industrialized countries. The cost of urban air pollution {{is estimated}} to be 2 % of GDP in developed countries and more than 5 % in developing countries. With an annual vehicle registration growth of over 30 % in 2008 and a population growth rate of 6 %, the number of automobiles in Kampala city of Uganda is expected to continue growing exponentially. Most of the vehicles used are imported into the country when quite old with worn out engines and low energy efficiencies. As a result, such vehicles profusely emit exhaust gases which may be harmful to both human health and the environment. Controlling pollution from the transport sector is vital to improving the quality of air and protecting public health. The objective of this dissertation was to determine the level of pollution from automobile exhaust gases in Kampala City and its impacts on human health and the environment. The study involved the analysis of tail pipe emissions using a gas analyser. It covered mini buses, motorcycles and personal vehicles which constitute 92 % of the Kampala vehicle parc. It was established that the main types of exhaust gases from the automobiles were CO 2,  NOx, CO, NO and HC. The findings estimated the highest level of NOx tail pipe emissions at 0. 15 mg/m 3, HC emissions at 2. 59 mg/m 3, CO at 110 mg/m 3 and 286. 6 mg/m 3 for CO 2. The reported ambient air emissions were estimated at 0. 18 ppm, 14000 ppm and 1. 3 ppm corresponding to NO 2, CO 2 and CO, respectively. The study further investigated the impact of four mitigation methods on emission levels using the LEAP model. The impact of increasing penetration of city buses, introduction of tail pipe emission standards and hybrid cars and improvement of vehicle fuel economy were investigated. It was found that if left unabated, the emissions will continue to grow with the increasing number of motor vehicles. Implementation of the proposed mitigation methods resulted in a reduction in the GWP reduced by 52 %, 51 %, 17 % and 8. 5 %, respectively. It is recommended that a comprehensive <b>motor</b> <b>vehicle</b> <b>pollution</b> control program be designed to implement the proposed NEMA vehicle emission standards.

40|$|Graduation date: 1966 The {{importance}} of automobile exhaust {{as a source}} of atmospheric pollutants has been recognized for several years. With the control of stationary sources in geographic areas such as Los Angeles County, the automobile has become the major uncontrolled source of air pollution. The three major pollutants emitted by automobiles are unburned hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, and oxides of nitrogen. Seventy percent of the emissions are from the exhaust. Maximum emission standards of 275 ppm hydrocarbons as n-hexane and 1. 5 mole percent carbon monoxide in automotive exhaust have been enacted in California. Control measures for the oxides of nitrogen may possibly be effective for 1970 model vehicles. Exhaust control devices for hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide emissions submitted to the California <b>Motor</b> <b>Vehicle</b> <b>Pollution</b> Control Board for approval have included catalytic converters, direct-flame afterburners, engine modification systems, and secondary air injection at the exhaust port systems. Three of the automobile manufactures may use the fourth system which involves introduction of secondary air into the engine exhaust ports to promote flameless oxidation of hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide to carbon dioxide and water. Since this control system introduces air to the high temperature exhaust gases at the exhaust port, the question arises whether oxides of nitrogen might be formed. This would be detrimental from the outlook that oxides of nitrogen must be controlled. The purpose of this work was to determine the effects on the emissions of oxides of nitrogen from a gasoline engine by the installation and operation of an exhaust port secondary air injection system. The engine under test, given to Oregon State University by the Ford Motor Company, was installed in a vehicle and operated on a chassis dynamometer. Measurements of oxides of nitrogen emissions with and without the air injection system in operation were made both during steady state and transient conditions. For transient measurements, the vehicle was operated on the California seven-mode test cycle. Oxides of nitrogen samples were taken by a progressive grab sampling technique and analyzed with an absorption spectrophotom eter built at Oregon State University. Further measurements included unburned hydrocarbon, carbon monoxide, and carbon dioxide analyses with commercial non-dispersive infrared analyzers and total carbon measurement with a commercial hydrogen flame ionization analyzer. These analyses were made for the purpose of determining air dilution factors and correlating data with other work being done in the field. The results of the investigation are summarized as follows: 1) The addition of secondary air at the exhaust ports in creased the oxides of nitrogen emissions during acceleration for both rich and lean mixture operation. As high as 40 percent in crease occurred during operation with the rich carburetor. Appreciable increase also occurred during high speed steady state cruise conditions with the rich carburetor. Weighted average concentrations of NO[subscript x] for operation on the California cycle were not determined. 2) The grab sampling and spectrophotometric analysis methods for the oxides of nitrogen worked well during the testing. However, the time required to take a grab sample, three seconds, was too long to obtain instantaneous analysis. Sampling probes should be located closer to the engine to avoid mixing of exhaust from separate modes in the exhaust pipe prior to analysis. 3) Temperatures in the exhaust manifold were not markedly changed by the injection of secondary air into the exhaust ports. However, temperatures were 50 to 100 ° F higher {{at the end of the}} tailpipe due to increased exhaust mass flow rate. 4) The vehicle with the air system installed met California standards for operation with the rich carburetor, but emitted a higher concentration of unburned hydrocarbons than the standard during operation with the lean carburetor...|$|E

Gasoline powered vehicles plus diesel exhausts contribute 47. 5 %, 88. 3 % and 15. 4 % of measured inhalable particulate OC, EC and mass, respectively. Though the contribution is not quantitatively calculated in this study, dust was estimated as another important source of PM 10, which is a significant contributor to coarse phase pollutions. Even compared to other mega-cities like Beijing, Mexico City, and Los Angeles, the <b>motor</b> <b>vehicle</b> associated <b>pollution</b> in Lahore was found to be very large. Other sources of carbonaceous aerosols were quantified including wood smoke, vegetative detritus, natural gas combustions and have relative small contributions compared with the traffic pollutions...|$|R
40|$|Faced {{with the}} worst air quality in the United States, California began in the 1960 s to pursue a “technology-forcing ” {{approach}} in establishing <b>motor</b> <b>vehicle</b> tailpipe emission standards. This approach sought to advance <b>vehicle</b> <b>pollution</b> control technology by establishing future tailpipe emission limits even if no technologies existed to meet {{them at the time}} regulators set the standards. The U. S. government later incorporated technology-forcing into the 1970 U. S. Clean Air Act (CAA), and it has remained the main regulatory focus for bringing cleaner cars to market in the United States for almost 40 years...|$|R
40|$|The author studies Pakistan's major {{environmental}} problems, both green and brown, and assesses {{the extent to}} which economic policies affect incentives to protect the environment. Experience in other countries shows that nondistortionary economic policies that promote economic growth by improving the allocation of resources also create appropriate incentives for protecting the environment. Sound economic policies alone are not enough, of course. Environmental policies designed to correct market failures are also necessary. Pakistan, like many countries, has relied mostly on command-and-control environmental policies, which have often failed because its regulatory institutions lack the resources to monitor compliance. Pakistan would be better off using incentive- or market-based policies, which use prices to encourage pollution abatement and the appropriate use of resources. Failures in economic policy contribute significantly to Pakistan's"brown"environmental problems, which include industrial and domestic wastewater pollution, as well as air <b>pollution</b> (especially from <b>motor</b> <b>vehicle</b> emissions). <b>Pollution</b> problems exist both in urban and industrial areas, as well as in marine and coastal zone waters. Failures in economic policy also contribute to"green"environmental problems, affecting behavior in forests, rangelands, and both rainfed and irrigated agriculture. Subsidies for irrigation water, for example, encourage farmers to overuse water, exacerbating the problems of waterlogging and salinity that plague irrigated agriculture. Lack of property rights in communal forests and the failure to give local communities incentives to participate in forest-management decisions have contributed to the problems of deforestation and the degradation of Pakistan's rangeland.
