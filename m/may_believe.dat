5|$|Most {{moments in}} which there is a fantastic {{occurrence}} constitute a change in point of view, from the omniscient narrator to a specific character with particular beliefs. The introduction of magical events from the perspective of the slaves highlights their otherness, because while they <b>may</b> <b>believe,</b> for instance, that Macandal survived his execution, the whites, and especially the readers, know that he did not. The marvellous, emphasized in the Prologue, is a product of the characters' beliefs, which is why there is the shift in perspectives when presenting it.|$|E
5|$|In Malagasy culture lemurs, {{and animals}} in general, have souls (ambiroa) which can get revenge if mocked while alive or if {{killed in a}} cruel fashion. Because of this, lemurs, like many other {{elements}} of daily life, have {{been a source of}} taboos, known locally as fady, which can be based around stories with four basic principles. A village or region <b>may</b> <b>believe</b> that a certain type of lemur may be the ancestor of the clan. They may also believe that a lemur's spirit may get revenge. Alternatively, the animal may appear as a benefactor. Lemurs are also thought to impart their qualities, good or bad, onto human babies. In general, fady extend beyond a sense of the forbidden, but can include events that bring bad luck.|$|E
5|$|This {{concept of}} the double burden with married couples is a {{worldwide}} phenomenon. Throughout different cultures of the world, women spend more total hours in work than men do. In Japan, once married, they are still expected to be devoted wives and mothers who give all off their effort to the home, even after {{a full day of}} work. Latin American women, now entering the work force in large numbers, still face what they call doble jornada, or double day's journey. Although in the Latin American culture, men are starting to interact more with the children and helping around the house more, the main domestic responsibilities still fall upon the women of the house. Sometimes women who are primary wage earners are still relegated to most of the domestic work. European men are more likely to play and interact with their children but not likely to participate fully in their daily care. They are more likely to help their wives at home, yet rarely do they tackle all domestic task equally. Men commonly fail to live up to their belief of equal sharing of domestic labor: they <b>may</b> <b>believe</b> in an equal workload in the house, but the inconvenience of taking on work done by their wives stops many from following through.|$|E

25|$|Eustathius {{said that}} Poseidon first saw her dancing at Naxos {{among the other}} Nereids, and carried her off.

25|$|According to {{the fourth}} edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, {{published}} in 1994 (DSM-IV), dysthymia is a serious state of chronic depression, which persists {{for at least two}} years (one year for children and adolescents). Dysthymia is less acute and severe than major depressive disorder. As dysthymia is a chronic disorder, sufferers may experience symptoms for many years before it is diagnosed, if diagnosis occurs at all. As a result, they <b>may</b> <b>believe</b> that depression is a part of their character, so they may not even discuss their symptoms with doctors, family members or friends.|$|E
25|$|Naturalism of {{this sort}} says nothing about the {{existence}} or nonexistence of the supernatural, which by this definition is beyond natural testing. As a practical consideration, the rejection of supernatural explanations would merely be pragmatic, thus it would nonetheless be possible, for an ontological supernaturalist to espouse and practice methodological naturalism. For example, scientists <b>may</b> <b>believe</b> in God while practicing methodological naturalism in their scientific work. This position does not preclude knowledge that is somehow connected to the supernatural. Generally however, {{anything that can be}} scientifically examined and explained would not be supernatural, simply by definition.|$|E

25|$|There is {{significant}} debate among sociologists about {{the interpretation of}} this trend in census data. The increase in those indicating 'no religion' is often cited {{in support of the}} secularisation thesis, although more detailed research of this group has thrown this assumption into question. An alternative theory is that the data indicates a decline in institutional religious affiliation rather than simply a decrease in spiritual belief. A 1985 survey showed that around one-quarter of those answering 'no religion' <b>may</b> <b>believe</b> in a god and that, conversely, between 7 percent and 36 percent of Christians (depending on their denomination) did not believe in the existence of deities.|$|E
25|$|Researchers {{found that}} having an older sibling, {{especially}} an older brother, affected how girls viewed sex and sexuality. Girls with older brothers held more traditional views about sexuality {{and said they}} were less interested in seeking sex, as well as less interested responding to the sexual advances of boys compared with girls with no older siblings. Researchers believe this is because older siblings model gender roles, so girls with older siblings (especially brothers) may have more traditional views of what society says girls and boys should be like; girls with older brothers <b>may</b> <b>believe</b> that sexual intercourse is mostly for having children, rather than for gaining sexual pleasure. This traditional view can inhibit them from focusing on their own sexualities and desires, and may keep them constrained to society’s prescribed gender roles.|$|E
25|$|Current {{models of}} ADHD {{suggest that it}} is {{associated}} with functional impairments in some of the brain's neurotransmitter systems, particularly those involving dopamine and norepinephrine. Psychostimulants like methylphenidate and amphetamine may be effective in treating ADHD because they increase neurotransmitter activity in these systems. Approximately70% of those who use these stimulants see improvements in ADHD symptoms. Children with ADHD who use stimulant medications generally have better relationships with peers and family members, generally perform better in school, are less distractible and impulsive, and have longer attention spans. People with ADHD have an increased risk of substance use disorders, and stimulant medications reduce this risk. Some studies suggest that since ADHD diagnosis is increasing significantly around the world, using the drug may cause more harm than good in some populations with ADHD. This applies to people who potentially may be experiencing a different issue and are misdiagnosed with ADHD. The drug is used to treat symptoms that could be better treated through a different, such as behavioural, intervention. People in this category can then experience negative side-effects of the drug which worsen their condition, and make it harder for them to receive adequate care as providers around them <b>may</b> <b>believe</b> the drugs are sufficient and the problem lies with the user.|$|E
50|$|<b>May</b> <b>believed</b> that psychotherapists {{towards the}} end of the 20th century had {{fractured}} away from the Jungian, Freudian and other influencing psychoanalytic thought and started creating their own 'gimmicks' causing a crisis within the world of psychotherapy. These gimmicks were said to put too much stock into the self where the real focus needed to be looking at 'man in the world'. To accomplish this, May pushed for the use of existential therapy over individually created techniques for psychotherapy.|$|R
