40|$|Abstract Background Molecular {{alterations}} {{critical to}} development of cancer include mutations, copy number alterations (amplifications and deletions) {{as well as}} genomic rearrangements resulting in gene fusions. Massively parallel next generation sequencing, which enables the discovery of such changes, uses considerable quantities of genomic DNA (> 5 ug), a serious limitation in ever smaller clinical samples. However, a commonly available microarray platforms such as array comparative genomic hybridization (array CGH) allows the characterization of gene copy number at a single gene resolution using much smaller amounts of genomic DNA. In this study we evaluate the sensitivity of ultra-dense array CGH platforms developed by Agilent, especially that of the 1 million probe array (1 M array), and their application when whole genome amplification is required because of limited sample quantities. Methods We performed array CGH on whole genome amplified and not amplified genomic DNA from MCF- 7 breast cancer cells, using 244 K and 1 M Agilent arrays. The ADM- 2 algorithm was used to identify <b>micro-copy</b> number alterations that measured less than 1 Mb in genomic length. Results DNA from MCF- 7 breast cancer cells was analyzed for <b>micro-copy</b> number alterations, defined as measuring less than 1 Mb in genomic length. The 4 -fold extra resolution of the 1 M array platform relative to the less dense 244 K array platform, led to the improved detection of copy number variations (CNVs) and micro-CNAs. The identification of intra-genic breakpoints in areas of DNA copy number gain signaled the possible presence of gene fusion events. However, the ultra-dense platforms, especially the densest 1 M array, detect artifacts inherent to whole genome amplification and should be used only with non-amplified DNA samples. Conclusions This is a first report using 1 M array CGH for the discovery of cancer genes and biomarkers. We show the remarkable capacity of this technology to discover CNVs, <b>micro-copy</b> number alterations and even gene fusions. However, these platforms require excellent genomic DNA quality and do not tolerate relatively small imperfections related to the whole genome amplification. </p...|$|E
