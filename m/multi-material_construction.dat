40|$|AbstractSteel {{as well as}} {{aluminum}} play {{an essential}} role for <b>multi-material</b> <b>construction</b> {{in the field of}} lightweight design. However, the thermal metallurgical joining of these materials is difficult due to their different physical properties and the formation of intermetallic phases. This paper describes investigations on laser joining of aluminum plated steel with aluminum. Furthermore examinations with additives acting as diffusion barriers were carried out. The results indicate that the aluminum coating is advantageous for the joint. The growth of intermetallic phases can be reduced by application of carbon and tungsten to the steel sheet tip...|$|E
40|$|The {{fracture}} behavior due to dynamic {{response in}} a composite gun tube {{subjected to a}} moving pressure has been investigated. The resonance of stress waves result in very high amplitude and frequency strains in the tube at the instant and location of pressure front passage as the velocity of the projectile approaches a critical value. The cyclic stresses can accelerate crack propagation in the gun tube with an existing imperfection and significantly shorten the fatigue life of gun tubes. The fracture mechanism induced by dynamic amplification effects is particularly critical for composite overwrap barrels because of a <b>multi-material</b> <b>construction,</b> anisotropic material properties, and the potential of thermal degradation...|$|E
40|$|Ultra-high-performance {{concrete}} (UHPC) {{sandwich structures}} with composite coating serve as multipurpose load-bearing elements. The UHPC’s extraordinary compressive strength {{is used in}} a <b>multi-material</b> <b>construction</b> element, while issues regarding the concrete’s brittle failure behaviour are properly addressed. A hollow section concrete core is covered by two steel tubes. The outer steel tube is wrapped in a composite material. By this design, UHPC is used in a material- and shape-optimised way with a low dead weight ratio[1] concerning the load-bearing capacity and stability[2]. The cross-section’s hollow shape optimises the construction’s buckling stability while saving self-weight. The composite coating on the column’s outside functions both as a layer increasing the construction’s durability and as a structural component increasing the the maximum and the residual load capacity. Investigations on the construction’s structural behaviour were performed...|$|E
30|$|Magnesium alloys {{are very}} {{versatile}} materials. Their high specific strength, combined with easy machining, suggest their application {{in any kind}} of lightweight structure [1]. For the use of magnesium in <b>multi-material</b> <b>constructions,</b> i.e. in combination with other materials, efficient joining technologies need to be developed.|$|R
30|$|Concept {{development}} was supported and supplemented by the “Materials & Manufacturing Technologies” and “Simulation & Testing” subprojects, {{in which the}} required technologies for economic <b>multi-material</b> lightweight <b>construction</b> were developed. In addition, the costs and LCA (Life Cycle Assessment) were taken into account during concept development. The SLC body concept will finally be presented as a prototype for physical testing and subsequently validated in the fourth subproject {{at the beginning of}} 2009.|$|R
40|$|Traditional {{solid-state}} welding methods mainly {{focuses on}} joining of similar materials. But {{with the increased}} interest in <b>multi-material</b> <b>constructions</b> more research is neededon joining of dissimilar materials. In the present thesis dedicated cold pressure welding experiments with dissimilar aluminum alloys have been performed. The alloy combinations investigated were cold-deformed AA 5183 and soft-annealed AA 5183 (Series II) and cold-deformed AA 5183 and commercial purity AA 1050 (Series III). In both series metallic bonding is initiated when a critical value of the compressive plastic strain is reached. A small increase in the strain beyond this threshold leads to full metallic bonding. In Series II the soft-annealed AA 5183 material rapidly work-hardens during upsetting until the pressure at the contact section becomes {{equal to that of}} the cold-deformed AA 5183 material. At this point the two interfaces start to mate before the bonding process eventually commences. In Series III the soft commercial purity AA 1050 material is unable to work-harden to any great extent. Instead, the cold-deformed AA 5183 material starts to penetrate the soft AA 1050 wire. This leads to build-up of an internal extrusion pressure approaching that of the cold-deformed AA 5183 material. The local material flow pattern occurring at the interface will then determine the actual surface exposure at which full metallic bonding is achieved. </p...|$|R
40|$|Three {{new vehicle}} {{concepts}} {{in the field}} of transport are being developed at the German Aerospace Center (DLR) as part of the Next Generation Car META-project: Urban Modular Vehicle, Safe Light Regional Vehicle and Interurban Vehicle. In the submitted contribution, the focus lies on the development and application of a method for determining the vehicle concept and body in white construction for the Urban Modular Vehicle. With the electrification of cars, there is an opportunity to redesign the vehicle concepts and architectures of future vehicles. In the development of electric vehicles, the integration of new components (e. g. the volume and mass-intensive batteries), provide increasing demands on the overall vehicle design and vehicle packaging. By matching the arrangement and the integration of components for the Urban Modular Vehicle, a functionally integrated and modular body structure design is being developed. In the structural development phase, the methodological approach, which describes the complete development, employs various optimisations for the load path aligned design and modular structure design. The body structure concept from the Institute of Vehicle Concepts in Stuttgart is based on the purposeful use of different materials for the purposes of <b>multi-material</b> <b>construction</b> and can show advantages over conversion designs...|$|E
40|$|In {{fields of}} {{mechanical}} engineering, automotive and aircraft industry the increasing demands for efficient energy processes induce {{the development of}} load adjusted <b>multi-material</b> <b>constructions.</b> In particular - due to their higher stiffness, good impact behavior and high load capacity - hybrid structures made of fiber reinforced thermoplastics (FRP) and metals can provide a significant contribution for weight reduction and thus for saving natural resources. Compared to established thermosetting systems like GLARE, ARALL and CARALL in aircraft the new hybrid material is predestined for automotive mass production because of the short cycle times by using thermoplastic polymers. For this matter the FRP plies are combined with metal foils – coil to coil – to hybrid laminates, although the mechanical properties of the hybrid layup are essentially influenced by {{the design of the}} interface between metal and polymer component. Automotive manufacturing processes, such as cathodic dip-paint (CDP) coat or deep-drawing processes induce substantial residual stresses. These temperature and forming stresses must be considered especially when dimensioning hybrid structures for structural applications. The current article focuses on the development of innovative hybrid laminates with steel sheets/foils and glass as well a carbon fiber reinforced prepregs. To optimize the specific interfaces the influence of several pre operations like sanding, cleaning with organic solvents, applying primer systems and activation by flaming was investigated to increase the interlaminar shear stress (ILS). Based on the findings the optimized compound was tested under realistic CDP conditions and the influence on the ILS determined...|$|R

In order to realize modern hybrid construction, suitable joining techniques are therefore required. Clinching represents a cost-effective {{and easy to}} implement joining method. In this paper the material modelling of the short fibre reinforced thermoplastic sheets considering the fibre orientation tensor for the FEA of the clinching process is presented...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{the use of}} building information modelling (BIM) for multi-material modelling and automatic generation of computational model for structural analysis. On {{the basis of a}} project documentation of an existing building, I first described the typical process in the Tekla Structures {{for the development of a}} <b>multi-material</b> 3 D <b>construction</b> model. In the second part of the thesis, the model was then converted into several computational models and analysed in programmes for static analysis. I showed the process of data exchange between software developed by different vendors via plug-ins. Finally, the solutions were evaluated to identify their capabilities and shortcomings. In the third part of the thesis, I described parametric design, e. g., reinforcement and steel element connections, and created plans and construction drawings in the software Tekla Structures...|$|R

A definitive version was subsequently published at: [URL] sports impact reconstructions have highlighted the inadequacies in current measures {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} personal protective equipment (PPE) and emphasised the need for improved impact surrogates that provide a more biofidelic representation of human impact response. The skin, muscle and subcutaneous adipose tissues were considered to constitute the structures primarily governing the mechanical behaviour of the human body segment. A preceding study by Payne et al. (in press) investigated the formulation and characterisation of muscle tissue simulants. The present study investigates the development of bespoke blends of additive cure polydimethysiloxane (PDMS) silicones to represent both skin and adipose tissues using the same processes previously reported. These simulants were characterised mechanically through a range of strain rates and a range of hyperelastic and viscoelastic constitutive models were evaluated to describe their behaviour. To explore the worth of the silicone simulants, finite element (FE) models were developed using anthropometric parameters representative of the human thigh segment, derived from the Visible Human Project. The <b>multi-material</b> silicone <b>construction</b> was validated experimentally and compared with both organic tissue data from literature and commonly used single material simulants: Dow Corning Silastic 3480 series silicones and ballistics gelatin when subject to a representative sports specific knee impact. Superior biofidelic performance is reported for the PDMS silicone formulations and surrogate predictions...|$|R
