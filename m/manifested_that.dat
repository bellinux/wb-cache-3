500|$|Questions {{raised by}} critics mainly {{concerned}} the irony and hypocrisy {{of the lyrics}} of the song and its video. Philip Cosores of Paste felt that with the music video, Beyoncé disrespected the message she sent through the song and {{felt that it was}} notable enough to stand on its own. Similarly, Shannon Kelley for TakePart said that the song [...] "offers an honest commentary on an important reality", but highlighted the irony of its music video and felt that it <b>manifested</b> <b>that</b> [...] " [...] not immune to the disease". Randal Roberts of the Los Angeles Times quipped, [...] "She makes a convincing case, {{were it not for the}} string of nearly soft-core fashion shoots that follow ... As a first song on an album, 'Pretty Hurts' works. But as thematic opener to such a relentless visual seduction, the hypocrisy is hard to ignore." [...] Although Daisy Buchanan of The Daily Telegraph praised the message of the song and its video, she wrote in her review that the clip was [...] "pure hypocrisy" [...] because she opined that Beyoncé had promoted [...] "heavily sexualised and unattainable standards" [...] with her body throughout her career.|$|E

60|$|The {{addresses}} were, many of them, very beautiful; {{the more}} so for the earnest and religious feeling which they <b>manifested.</b> <b>That</b> of Dr. Wardlaw, in particular, was full of comfort and encouragement, and breathed a most candid and catholic spirit.

As Christians, all have a common interest in what honors or dishonors Christianity, and an ocean between us does not make us less one church.|$|E

Nothing daunted by such palpable evidences {{of the danger of}} his situation, our adventurer answered to their taunts with the most scornful smiles, challenging a single individual of them all to dare to step forth, and maintain his words by suitable actions.|$|E
6000|$|These apprehensions were greatly {{increased}} {{by the desire}} which King Mehevi {{and several of the}} inferior chiefs now <b>manifested</b> <b>that</b> I should be tattooed. The pleasure of the king was first signified to me some three days after my casual encounter with Karky the artist. Heavens! what imprecations I showered upon that Karky. Doubtless he had plotted a conspiracy against me and my countenance, and would never rest until his diabolical purpose was accomplished. Several times I met him {{in various parts of the}} valley, and, invariably, whenever he descried me, he came running after me with his mallet and chisel, flourishing them about my face as if he longed to begin. What an object he would have made of me! ...|$|E

In short, the opinion of the company was so clearly <b>manifested,</b> <b>that</b> Mr Kenwigs was on the point of repairing to Mr Noggs's room, to demand an explanation, and had indeed swallowed a preparatory glass of punch, with great inflexibility and steadiness of purpose, when the attention of all present was diverted by a new and terrible surprise.|$|E

6000|$|Fifth Privilege. Thine {{advocate}} has {{pity for}} thee, and great indignation against thine accuser: {{and these are}} two excellent things. When a lawyer hath pity for a man whose cause he pleadeth, it will engage him much; but when he has indignation also against the man's accuser, this will yet engage him more. Now, Christ has both these, and that not of humour, but by grace and justice; grace to us, and justice to our accuser. He came down from heaven {{that he might be}} a Priest, and returned thither again to be Priest and Advocate for his; and in both these offices he levelleth his whole force and power against thine accuser: [...] "For this purpose the Son of God was <b>manifested,</b> <b>that</b> he might destroy the works of the devil" [...] (I John 3:8).|$|E

The Displeasure in his Countenance (for he took more Notice of the Rudeness than the good Lady her self) soon convinc'd me of my Error; However, as a greater Token of his Civility, having admitted no Spaniards along with my Companions and me, is pass'd off the better; and his after Civilities <b>manifested,</b> <b>that</b> {{he was willing to}} reform my Ignorance by his Complaisance.|$|E
60|$|Ruth used gentle {{force to}} draw her {{daughter}} nearer while speaking, {{and the latter}} sunk into that posture from which she had just arisen, kneeling, as she had often done in infancy, at her mother's side. The attitude was too full of tender recollections not to be grateful, and the half-alarmed being of the forest was suffered to retain it {{during most of the}} dialogue that followed. But while she was thus obedient in person, by the vacancy or rather wonder of an eye that was so eloquent to express all the emotions and knowledge of which she was the mistress, Narra-mattah plainly <b>manifested</b> <b>that</b> little more than the endearment of her mother's words and manner was intelligible. Ruth saw the meaning of her hesitation; and, smothering the pang it caused, she endeavored to adapt her language to the habits of one so artless.|$|E

We count it convenient that men, when their crimes and transgressions are to be <b>manifested,</b> <b>that</b> they be set in some open place with a piece paper, wherein their transgressions are inserted, {{that they may not}} only confess, but bear their own shame.

60|$|Leaving this gifted {{favourite}} {{of fortune}} and nature, we shall pass to {{an entirely different}} individual, and to another quarter of the place. The spot, to which we wish now to transport the reader, was neither more nor less than the shop of a tailor, who did not disdain to perform the most minute offices of his vocation in his own heedful person. The humble edifice stood at no great distance from the water, in the skirts of the town, and {{in such a situation}} as to enable its occupant to look out upon the loveliness of the inner basin, and, through a vista cut by the element between islands, even upon the lake-like scenery of the outer harbour.

(Eze 16:52,63) We count it convenient that men, when their crimes and transgressions are to be <b>manifested,</b> <b>that</b> they be set in some open place, with a paper, wherein their transgressions are inserted, pinned upon their back or their forehead, {{that they may not}} only confess, but bear their own shame.34 And at the penitential confession of sinners, God has something of this kind to do; if not before men, yet before angels, that they may behold, and be affected, and rejoice when they shall see, after the revelation of sin, the sinner taken into the favour and abundant mercy of God.
