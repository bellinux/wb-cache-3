The 128mm anti-tank gun's precise location on the Ratte is a point of contention among historians, most believing {{that it would have been}} mounted within the primary turret, with some others thinking a smaller secondary turret at the rear of the Ratte more logical. Some concept drawings exist to suggest a flexible mount on the glacis plate. The tank was to be provided with a vehicle bay that could hold two BMW R12 motorcycles for scouting, and several smaller storage rooms, a compact infirmary area, and a self-contained lavatory system.|$|E

50|$|In Kenya, {{because of}} the seeming ongoing failure of the Kenyan African Union to obtain {{political}} reforms from the British through peaceful means, radical activists within the KAU set up a splinter group and organised a more militant kind of nationalism.

The <b>Mau</b> <b>Mau</b> carried out attacks on political opponents, loyalist villages, raiding white settler farms and destroying livestock.

40|$|This essay {{examines}} {{contemporary political}} discourses about the <b>Mau</b> <b>Mau</b> insurgence, {{which took place}} in Kenya in 1952 - 1960. During the <b>Mau</b> <b>Mau,</b> the people living in the Central Highlands region, mainly of the Kikuyu ethnic group rebelled against colonial rule. The British came down hard on the <b>Mau</b> <b>Mau,</b> detaining, killing and torturing large portions of the Kikuyu population. There was a divide within the Kikuyu between those loyal to colonial administration and those who fought for independence, which is to some extent still present today. In Kenya ethnicity is important; I argue that there is no nation state; that Kenya is a state consisting of several nations. If and how political discourses about the <b>Mau</b> <b>Mau</b> are connected to the nation building process is a central theme. Kenya is going though a democratic transition and the silence, which has surrounded the <b>Mau</b> <b>Mau</b> is being broken. Who speaks about the <b>Mau</b> <b>Mau,</b> what their political goals are and how it is discussed are elements of this study. In order to investigate this I have conducted qualitative interviews with politicians, human rights advocates and <b>Mau</b> <b>Mau</b> war veterans.

40|$|This paper {{argues that}} {{contemporary}} {{relationship between the}} former <b>Mau</b> <b>Mau</b> and loyalists is much informed by the variegated nature of the struggle. The <b>Mau</b> <b>Mau</b> was itself a divided machine. A poorly developed aspect of the <b>Mau</b> <b>Mau</b> was the difference between high or deep forest <b>Mau</b> <b>Mau</b> and low or village <b>Mau</b> <b>Mau.</b> The latter were called Komerera. These operated in the villages, living furtively among the people at night and in aardvark holes by day. They crawled out {{under cover of darkness}} to demand food from the villagers, in negotiations that were often life or death issues. They were young men, ruthlessly committed to war. Their claim among the villagers was that of front soldiers representing the deep forest <b>Mau</b> <b>Mau.</b> The current land conflicts between former fighters and former loyalists is linked to traditional Kikuyu land issues. 1. A divided war machine To understand the contemporary social relationships between the former <b>Mau</b> <b>Mau</b> and loyalists, it is necessary to first reconstruct the strata that formed this social uprising in the 1950 s. It is often overlooked that the struggle for independence in Kenya was not a monolithic campaign by one regiment. Although the entity called <b>Mau</b> <b>Mau</b> was by far the most ideologically, numerically and purposefully solid, there were many transient groups before, during and immediately after independence. An example is the party of Wanjohi Mun’gau, kiama kiama kia Wanjohi wa Mung’au. We need not belabour the fact that the <b>Mau</b> <b>Mau</b> was a product of a varied past representing common aspirations, which were undeniably Kikuyu in origin (Furedi, 1989).

40|$|Abstract: Facing {{the end of}} {{the colonial}} state during the <b>Mau</b> <b>Mau</b> crisis in 1950 s, Britain sought to reshape native Kenyans. This process was {{dependent}} on the construction of various imaginations of the <b>Mau</b> <b>Mau.</b> The British sought to eliminate the <b>Mau</b> <b>Mau</b> “sickness” by responding in a comprehensive manner to what they saw as the issues which precipitated its development. Politically, religiously, economically, and intellectually, the British tried to control this conclusion to the colonial period and shape the future of Kenya by “rehabilitating” those “infected” by anti-British <b>Mau</b> <b>Mau</b> sentiments and create new citizens in the British image. Missionaries, teachers, economists, agrarians, doctors, anthropologists, and government officials in Kenya would contribute various constructions of the <b>Mau</b> <b>Mau</b> upon which rehabilitation efforts were based. Whitehall tried to reform or rehabilitate <b>Mau</b> <b>Mau</b> in prison work camps and in communities, freeing them from the political and psychological constraints of <b>Mau</b> <b>Mau</b> in a variety of while also creating a new economic and political structure in the colony which would allow those who had been successfully been rehabilitated to stay loyal to the British and maintain a privileged place in this nascent state. This essay will explore the efforts of the British to create new citizens and their efforts to define the <b>Mau</b> <b>Mau</b> upon which these responses to the conflict were based. The British government recognized the threat of <b>Mau</b> <b>Mau</b> and the implication its demands for “land and freedom” could have on their control of the State, thus they placed great emphasis on trying to understand, explain, define, and then reform <b>Mau</b> <b>Mau</b> adherents. For the British, this process was contingent upon the development of a construction of <b>Mau</b> <b>Mau</b> identity, an effort manifest in the research of colonial representatives and in their plans for “rehabilitation”. While <b>Mau</b> <b>Mau</b> was, indeed, a movement amongst ethnic Kenyans, it was also the subject of various colonial constructions. The various manifestations of this ‘movement of the mind’ which <b>Mau</b> <b>Mau</b> represented was as much a product of the minds of colonial officials, subjects, and representatives as it was a construction {{in the minds of the}} Kikuyu. These conceptions developed in tandem, informing each other, and shaping the development of the state. ‘Rehabilitation’ was at once, a response to the rebellion and a construction in the minds of colonial officials and one imposed upon the Kikuyu, one which was as much a representation of the colonials’ understanding of the conflict as it was an attempt to construct in Kikuyu minds a vision of the future that was already manifest in the minds of those colonial officials trying to shape it. These different perspectives would exist in the minds of colonials who would attempt to actualize their conception of the phenomenon in their plans for reconstruction. As the conflict progressed and conceptions of the phenomenon of <b>Mau</b> <b>Mau</b> and plans to counter the rebellion developed, the various colonial and Kikuyu constructions of <b>Mau</b> <b>Mau</b> would shape each other...|$|R
