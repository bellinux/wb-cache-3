40|$|<b>Mitoxantrone</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> (Novantrone®) is an anthracenedione {{that has}} been used as one of {{the latest in a long}} line of general immunosuppresive agents studied in {{multiple}} sclerosis (MS). We reviewed the clinical, laboratory, neuroimaging and echocardiography data of 18 patients from February 2001 to March 2004 out of a total number of 100 patients with definite MS. Fourteen patients were women (77. 7 %) and four were men. The mean age of the patients was 41. 6 ± 10 years old (confidence intervals 95 %: 36. 4 - 46. 7 years old). The mean duration of disease was 10. 5 ± 6. 3 years. Fourteen patients had the secondarily progressive form of MS, and four had the relapsing-remitting form. Mitoxantrone is an useful and clinically effective drug in MS and its major limitation is the potencial cardiotoxicity due to cumulative dose (140 mg) ...|$|E
40|$|D ISEASE-MODIFYINGagents {{approved}} fortreatment of pa-tients with mul-tiple sclerosis (MS) are glatiramer acetate, interferon beta- 1 b and- 1 a, and <b>mitoxantrone</b> <b>hydrochloride.</b> Natalizumab was Food and Drug Administration ap-proved in November 2004, but {{the manufacturers}} suspended market-ing and clinical trials in 2005 be-cause of safety concerns. Inter-feron beta- 1 a is approved {{for individuals with}} clinically isolated syndromes (CISs) who are at rela-tively high risk to “convert toMS. ” 1 - 5 Opinions vary about whom and when to treat. On one hand, the Medical Advisory Board of the Na-tionalMultiple Sclerosis Society con-sensus statement (updated in Feb-ruary 2005) recommends initiation of a disease-modifying agent “as soon as possible following definite diag-nosis of MSwith a relapsing course, and in selected patients with first at-tack who {{are at high risk}} for MS (CIS). ” 6 Alternatively, the Thera...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Mitoxantrone is {{the first}} drug {{approved}} {{for the treatment of}} secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS) in the United States. This assessment considers use of mitoxantrone in the treatment of MS. Mitoxantrone probably reduces the clinical attack rate and reduces attack-related MRI outcomes in patients with relapsing MS (Type B recommendation). Also, mitoxantrone may have a beneficial effect on disease progression in patients with MS whose clinical condition is worsening (Type B recommendation). The potential for serious toxicity of mitoxantrone, however, {{must be taken into account}} when considering this therapy in individual patients. Moreover, because the potential clinical benefits on disease progression appear to be only modest, the results of the single phase III trial should be replicated in another (and hopefully much larger) clinical study before this agent is widely recommended for the treatment of patients with MS.

40|$|The {{majority}} {{of prostate cancer}} (PCa) deaths occur due to the metastatic spread of tumor cells to distant organs. Currently, {{there is a lack}} of effective therapies once tumor cells have spread outside the prostate. It is therefore imperative to rapidly develop therapeutics to inhibit the metastatic spread of tumor cells. Gain of cell motility and invasive properties is the first step of metastasis and by inhibiting motility one can potentially inhibit metastasis. Using the drug repositioning strategy, we developed a cell-based multi-parameter primary screening assay to identify drugs that inhibit the migratory and invasive properties of metastatic PC- 3 PCa cells. Following the completion of the primary screening assay, 33 drugs were identified from an FDA approved drug library that either inhibited migration or were cytotoxic to the PC- 3 cells. Based on the data obtained from the subsequent validation studies, <b>mitoxantrone</b> <b>hydrochloride,</b> simvastatin, fluvastatin and vandetanib were identified as strong candidates that can inhibit both the migration and invasion of PC- 3 cells without significantly affecting cell viability. By employing the drug repositioning strategy instead of a de novo drug discovery and development strategy, the identified drug candidates have the potential to be rapidly translated into the clinic for the management of men with aggressive forms of PCa...|$|E
40|$|Background Damage of the {{blood-brain barrier}} and {{invasion}} of immunocompetent cells {{into the central}} nervous system represent key events in the immunopathogenesis of multiple sclerosis. <b>Mitoxantrone</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> reduces progression of disability and clinical exacerbations in patients with multiple sclerosis. Its precise mode of action is unclear. Objective To investigate the effects of mitoxantrone on the migratory capacity of immunocompetent cells ex vivo and in vitro. Design Case-control study. Setting Department of Neurology, Heinrich Heine University, D, Germany. Participants Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were obtained from 11 patients with multiple sclerosis before and after intravenous mitoxantrone treatment; PBMCs from 5 healthy control donors were treated with mitoxantrone in vitro. Main Outcome Measures The migratory capacity was studied in an in vitro Boyden chamber assay; cells and their rates of migration were analyzed by light microscopy and flow cytometry. To determine the specificity of our findings, PBMCs were treated with perfosfamide in vitro. Results Mitoxantrone decreased the migratory capacity of CD 14 + monocytes and (to a lesser degree) of CD 4 + and CD 8 + T lymphocytes. These observations were confirmed when control PBMCs were treated with an equivalent dose of mitoxantrone in vitro. Similar effects were seen when PBMCs were preincubated with perfosfamide. The inhibitory effects of mitoxantrone on the migratory capacity of PBMCs were mediated by reduced matrix metalloproteinase 9 activity, as demonstrated by zymography, polymerase chain reaction, and inhibitory studies. Conclusion Mitoxantrone may inhibit the migration of inflammatory cells into and within {{the central nervous system}}...|$|E
