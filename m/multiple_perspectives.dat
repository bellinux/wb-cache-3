5|$|Deckard's unicorn-dream sequence, {{inserted}} into the Director's Cut and concomitant with Gaff's parting gift of an origami unicorn, is {{seen by many as}} showing that Deckard is a replicant—because Gaff could have accessed Deckard's implanted memories. The interpretation that Deckard is a replicant is challenged by others who believe the unicorn imagery shows that the characters, whether human or replicant, share the same dreams and recognize their affinity, or that the absence of a decisive answer is crucial to the film's main theme. The film's inherent ambiguity and uncertainty, as well as its textual richness, have permitted viewers to see it from <b>multiple</b> <b>perspectives.</b>|$|E

5|$|Family {{relationships}} {{are a common}} type of connection between gods. Deities often form male and female pairs, reflecting the importance of procreation in Egyptian religious thought. Families of three deities, with a father, mother, and child, represent {{the creation of new}} life and the succession of the father by the child, a pattern that connects divine families with royal succession. Osiris, Isis, and Horus formed the quintessential family of this type. The pattern they set grew more widespread over time, so that many deities in local cult centers, like Ptah, Sekhmet, and their child Nefertum at Memphis and Amun, Mut, and Khonsu at Thebes, were assembled into family triads. Genealogical connections like these are changeable, in keeping with the <b>multiple</b> <b>perspectives</b> in Egyptian belief. Hathor, as a fertility goddess, could act as mother to any child god, including the child form of the sun god, although in other circumstances she was the sun god's daughter.|$|E
40|$|The <b>multiple</b> <b>perspective</b> stereo videos {{generation}} {{technique is}} proposed in this paper. Firstly, two perspective views are captured simultaneously {{by using a}} stereo video camera. The system estimates the corresponding points for each pixel based-on epipolar constraint. A smoothing algorithm is used to smooth the estimation result, and then generate the disparity maps for each picture pair. Finally, the proposed system generates <b>multiple</b> <b>perspective</b> stereo videos by interpolating or extrapolating the original views based on the generated disparity maps. By comparing with the traditional method, to capture the <b>multiple</b> <b>perspective</b> videos directly, both the difficulty of capturing procedure {{and the amount of}} video data can be reduced significantly. 1 Introduction For many immersive entertainment[3] and virtual reality systems[2], providing stereo views is an important feature to let users feel as if they are participating, especially if the systems can provide <b>multiple</b> <b>perspective</b> stereo [...] ...|$|R

For this purpose, he studied the human skeleton and sometimes used dummies made of wire to test the appropriate posture of the figure {{he was about to}} sculpt. In a second step, he photographed his models, using a mirror system that provided <b>multiple</b> <b>perspectives.</b> He then made plaster casts of the figures, both of people and animals (on one occasion he made a donkey stand up so it would not move). He modified the proportions of these casts to obtain the figure's desired appearance, depending on its place in the church (the higher up, the bigger it would be). Eventually, he sculpted the figures in stone.|$|E
5|$|Treatments are varied {{because there}} are <b>multiple</b> <b>perspectives</b> of alcoholism. Those who {{approach}} alcoholism as a medical condition or disease recommend differing treatments from, for instance, those who approach the condition as one of social choice. Most treatments focus on helping people discontinue their alcohol intake, followed up with life training and/or social support to help them resist a return to alcohol use. Since alcoholism involves multiple factors which encourage a person to continue drinking, they must all be addressed to successfully prevent a relapse. An example {{of this kind of}} treatment is detoxification followed by a combination of supportive therapy, attendance at self-help groups, and ongoing development of coping mechanisms. The treatment community for alcoholism typically supports an abstinence-based zero tolerance approach; however, some prefer a harm-reduction approach.|$|E

25|$|As {{one would}} expect, Metzinger’s concept of {{painting}} was both {{more sophisticated and}} perceptive than Cézanne, but fundamentally {{the shape of the}} misunderstandings that were to follow Cubism were the same as Cézanne's, and so too were the implications. Metzinger had seen painting as rooted in the experience of nature: four-dimensional and geometric. He stressed this heavily, {{and at the same time}} brought out the flatness and dislocations of Cézanne’s transformations of nature—with the conceptual aspect of <b>multiple</b> <b>perspectives</b> and non-Euclidean spacetime. The importance of Cubism, he accepted, was to emphasize the idea that everything visible (objects) and invisible (consciousness) has an n-dimensional geometric basis (an idea he associated with ‘construct an infinite number of different spaces for the use of painters’).|$|E

25|$|The {{reflexive}} {{function of}} complex geometry, juxtaposed <b>multiple</b> <b>perspectives,</b> planar fragmentation suggesting motion and rhythmic play with various symmetry types. Though very subtle, there does manifest itself in Femme à l'Éventail a spatial depth or perspective {{reminiscent of the}} optical illusion of space of the Renaissance; in the way, for example, windows appear of varying dimension depending on distance from the observer. This shows that non-Euclidean geometry does not imply the destruction of classical perspective, or that the breakdown of classical perspective need not be complete. Unlike the flattening of space associated with the Cubist paintings of Picasso and Braque of the same period, Metzinger {{had no intention of}} abolishing depth of field. Of course here perspectival space is only alluded to by changes of scale, not by co-ordinated linear convergence, resulting in a complex space perfectly adapted to a stage-set. This feature is observed not only in Metzinger's Cubist paintings, but also in his Divisionist and proto-Cubist works between 1905 and 1909, as well as in his more figurative works of the 1920s (during the Return to order phase).|$|E
40|$|Decision {{making is}} often {{complicated}} by the dynamic and uncertain information involved. This work unifies and generalizes the major approaches to modeling and solving a subclass of such decision problems. The relevant problem characteristics include discrete problem parameters, separable optimality functions, and sequential decisions made in stages. The relevant approaches include semi-Markov decision processes, dynamic decision modeling, and decision-theoretic planning. An analysis of current decision frameworks establishes a unifying task definition and a common vocabulary; the exercise also identifies the trade-off between model transparency and solution efficiency as their most significant limitation. Insights gained from the analysis lead to a new methodology for dynamic decision making under uncertainty.

Kohnlein argues, {{with a focus on}} Fachdidaktik, that "multiple perspective" should be a fundamental principle of instruction in basic education. When <b>multiple</b> <b>perspective</b> as an instructional principle is studied, he stresses the need to differentiate the various proposals about today's schooling in four categories.

25|$|In {{terms of}} photography, Brodovitch had a {{distinct}} {{feel for what}} the magazine needed. He favored on-location fashion photography {{as opposed to the}} studio shots normally used in other fashion publications. He urged his photographers to look for jarring juxtapositions in their images. One such spread features a woman in a full-length Dior gown posed between two circus elephants. The cinematic effect, a trademark characteristic of his layouts, involved using photographs as if they were stills from a film. He would repeat a pose or a dress several times across a spread to give a narrative, temporal feeling. At times, Brodovitch would arbitrarily take a series of photographs and adopt a story line to go with them, as though recapping a movie. He was known to push this idea even further by adding film sprocket borders to photographs at times. Brodovitch also often emphasized spatial illusions, using type and photographs to create <b>multiple</b> <b>perspectives</b> within a space. The notion of mirroring and doubling also interested him, {{as can be seen in}} how he paired similar pictures on a spread or dividing halves of one image across the gutter of the page.|$|E
25|$|Interestingly, despite Metzinger's conceptualism of Cubist painting—the {{reflexive}} {{function of}} complex geometry, juxtaposed <b>multiple</b> <b>perspectives,</b> planar fragmentation suggesting motion and rhythmic play with various symmetry types—there does manifest itself in Danseuse a certain spatial depth or perspective {{reminiscent of the}} optical illusion of space of the Renaissance; in the way, for example, the wall-mounted lighting fixtures become smaller with distance, and so too {{the man at the}} upper left appearing smaller in the background than his counterparts in the foreground.

2500|$|Just as in {{the works}} of Metzinger, and unlike those of Pablo Picasso or Georges Braque of the same period, Gleizes had no {{interest}} in the flattening of the entire surface, of fusing background and foreground to the point where all spatial depth of field was abandoned. Yet Gleizes made use of fragmentation of form, <b>multiple</b> <b>perspective</b> views (i.e., mobile and dynamic, rather than static and from one point-of-view) along with linear and planar structural qualities. Gleizes' Les Baigneuses (The Bathers) of the following year employs the same concept of <b>multiple</b> <b>perspective,</b> but not at the expense of vacating spatial depth.
