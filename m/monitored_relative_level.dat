Whilst rapid treat-ment of malaria cases with effective anti-malarials, the use of insecticide-treated nets and new combined ther-apies have recently helped to significantly reduce the mortality associated with malaria, {{there is still a}} risk that emergence of resistance to these approaches will occur. The ability to <b>monitor</b> <b>relative</b> <b>levels</b> of parasitaemia is, therefore, of paramount importance to reduce malaria morbidity and mortality and to control and eradicate malaria, as well as to evaluate clinical trials [2].

50|$|Maximum Humidity Indicator Cards are {{specially}} designed cards that <b>monitor</b> <b>relative</b> humidity <b>levels</b> in cargo applications.

40|$|Abstract—Approximately {{one-third of}} people who recover from a stroke require some form of {{assistance}} to walk. Repetitive taskoriented rehabilitation interventions {{have been shown to}} improve motor control and function in people with stroke. Our long-term goal is to design and test an intensive task-oriented intervention that will utilize the two primary components of constrainedinduced movement therapy: massed, task-oriented training and behavioral methods to increase use of the affected limb in the real world. The technological component of the intervention is based on a wearable footwear-based sensor system that <b>monitors</b> <b>relative</b> activity <b>levels,</b> functional utilization, and gait parameters of affected and unaffected lower extremities. The {{purpose of this study is}} to describe a methodology to automatically identify temporal gait parameters of poststroke individuals to be used in assessment of functional utilization of the affected lower extremity as a part of behavior enhancing feedback. An algorithm accounting for intersubject variability is capable of achieving estimation error in the range of 2. 6 – 18. 6 % producing comparable results for healthy and poststroke subjects. The proposed methodology is based on inexpensive and user-friendly technology that will enable research and clinical applications for rehabilitation {{of people who}} have experienced a stroke.

40|$|Abstract—Doppler radar {{has been}} used for {{small-scale}} dis-placement detection, e. g. respiration and heartbeat. The motion amplitude is less than half a carrier wavelength. In this letter, a novel Doppler radar technique is presented for accurate tracking of large-scale displacement of several carrier wavelengths, e. g., the water level variation. The DC-coupled architecture is used to ensure precise measurement of slow motions even with stationary moment. A novel signal processing approach is proposed to in-crease the demodulation linearity to deal with inconstant signal amplitude, dynamic dc offset and phase ambiguity in large-scale displacement tracking. Experiments have been carried out in the outdoor environment to <b>monitor</b> the <b>relative</b> water <b>level</b> position in a rain barrel when the water was pumped in or drained out. It is shown that the proposed technique can accurately gauge the <b>relative</b> water <b>level</b> variation of 3. 5 wavelengths with mm accuracy.

40|$|Plasma membrane-localized receptors are {{essential}} for cellular communication and signal transduction. In Arabidopsis thaliana, BRASSINOSTEROID INSENSITIVE 1 (BRI 1) {{is one of the}} receptors that is activated by binding to its ligand, the brassinosteroid (BR) hormone, at the cell surface to regulate diverse plant developmental processes. The availability of BRI 1 in the plasma membrane is related to its signaling output and is known to be controlled by the dynamic endomembrane trafficking. Advances in fluorescence labeling and confocal microscopy techniques enabled us {{to gain a better understanding}} of plasma membrane receptor dynamics in living cells. Here we describe different quantitative microscopy methods to <b>monitor</b> the <b>relative</b> steady-state <b>levels</b> of the BRI 1 protein in the plasma membrane of root epidermal cells and its relative exocytosis and recycling rates.

40|$|In higher eukaryotes, {{alternative}} splicing {{is a common}} mechanism for increasing transcriptome diversity. Affymetrix exon arrays were designed {{as a tool for}} <b>monitoring</b> the <b>relative</b> expression <b>levels</b> {{of hundreds of thousands of}} known and predicted exons with a view to detecting {{alternative splicing}} events. In this article, we have analyzed exon array data from many different human and mouse tissues and have uncovered a systematic relationship between transcript-fold change and alternative splicing as reported by the splicing index. Evidence from dilution experiments and deep sequencing suggest that this effect is of technical rather than biological origin and that it is driven by sequence features of the probes. This effect is substantial and results in a 12 -fold overestimation of alternative splicing events in genes that are differentially expressed. By cross-species exon array comparison, we could further show that the systematic bias persists even across species boundaries. Failure to consider this effect in data analysis would result in the reproducible false detection of apparently conserved alternative splicing events. Finally, we have developed a software in R called COSIE (Corrected Splicing Indices for Exon arrays) that for any given set of new exon array experiments corrects for the observed bias and improves the detection of alternative splicing (available at www. fmi. ch/groups/gbioinfo) ...|$|R

40|$|Impact {{sounds were}} {{synthesized}} according to standard textbook equations {{given for the}} motion of simply supported, metal plates. In a two-interval, forced-choice procedure, highly practiced listeners identified from these sounds a predefined class of target plates based on their particular material and geometric properties. The effects of two factors on identification were examined: the <b>relative</b> <b>level</b> of partials comprising the sounds and the relative amount of information (given as the difference in d′) each partial provided for identification. In different conditions one factor was fixed while the other either increased or decreased with frequency. The effect on listener identification in each case was determined from a logistic discriminant analysis of trial-by-trial responses, yielding a vector of listener decision weights on the frequency and decay of individual partials. The weights increased proportionally with <b>relative</b> <b>level,</b> but were largely uninfluenced by relative information content—a result exactly opposite to that expected from a maximum-likelihood observer. The dominant effect of <b>relative</b> <b>level</b> was replicated for other sound sources (clamped bars and stretched membranes) and was not diminished by randomizing the <b>relative</b> <b>level</b> of partials across trials.
