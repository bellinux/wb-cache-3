40|$|With {{the rapid}} {{development}} and wide spread of digital cameras, sizable personal digital image libraries would become mainstay of our digital assets for recording pictorial memories in our lives. As {{a matter of}} fact, most consumers cannot afford the time to annotate and organize their personal digital photos, they would face genuine problem of accessing them effectively and efficiently. More often than not, consumers wish to share a selective summary of their images with their relatives and friends, increasingly using remote repository <b>services</b> and <b>messaging</b> <b>services</b> (emails, <b>multimedia</b> <b>message</b> <b>service).</b> In this paper, we address this issue with automatic organization based on analysis of time stamps and image content to facilitate browsing and summarization of personal digital photos. In particular, both photo creation time and image content are exploited to efficiently partition related images in two stages. From the partitions, key photos are selected to represent the partition based on content analysis and then collated to generate a summary which can be enjoyed as a slide show for visual communication. We demonstrate our approach on genuine heterogeneous personal digital photos with encouraging results. We also develop a photo summarization application with <b>multimedia</b> <b>message</b> <b>service</b> o...|$|R

Along the cross-device dimension, we consider the multitude of user interface devices by which mobile users can further improve overall energy efficiency in consuming <b>multimedia</b> <b>messages.</b> In this writing, we discuss our method as a position paper.
