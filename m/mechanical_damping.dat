40|$|Milling {{is widely}} used in the {{manufacturing}} industry. Numerous efforts {{have been made to}} improve the efficiency of milling. For the efficiency of the milling process, high demands on the material removal rate and the surface generation rate. The process parameters determining the two rates are restricted by the occurrence of regenerative chatter. This project deals with reduction of chatter vibration in end milling tool by introducing the dampers. The main objective of the present work is to design a damped milling tool. A <b>mechanical</b> <b>damper</b> has been introduced to reduce tool vibration in milling tool. The <b>mechanical</b> <b>damper</b> is composed of multi-fingered cylindrical inserts placed in a matching cylindrical hole in center of standard end mill cutter. Centrifugal forces during high speed rotation press the flexible fingers against the inner surface of the tool. Bending of the tool and damper assembly due to cutting forces causes relative axial sliding between the tool inner surface and damper fingers dissipates in the form of friction work simple numerical analysis using ANSYS is performed to estimate the amount of friction work during bending. The numerical results are compared with analytical results. It is ascertained that there is a possibility of more damping the vibrations using multi-fingered <b>mechanical</b> <b>damper.</b> Keywords—Milling machine, Chatter, <b>Mechanical</b> <b>damper,</b> Vibration, Tools.

5000|$|The latter {{equation}} shows optical damping, i.e. {{the intrinsic}} <b>mechanical</b> <b>damping</b> [...] becomes stronger (or weaker) {{due to the}} optomechanical interaction. From the formula one can see that for negative detuning and large coupling, the <b>mechanical</b> <b>damping</b> can be greatly increased, which corresponds to cooling of the mechanical oscillator. In the case of positive detuning the optomechanical interaction leads to a negative contribution to the effective damping. This can lead to instability, when the effective damping drops below zero, , which means that it turns into an overall amplification rather than a damping of the mechanical oscillator.|$|E

Coulomb damping is a common damping mechanism that occurs in machinery.|$|E
5000|$|A similar {{technique}} {{has been used}} in aftermarket car audio; it is called [...] "aperiodic membrane" [...] (AP). A resistive mat is placed in front of or directly behind the loudspeaker driver (usually mounted on the rear deck of the car in order to use the trunk as an enclosure). The loudspeaker driver is sealed to the mat so that all acoustic output in one direction must pass through the mat. This increases <b>mechanical</b> <b>damping,</b> and the resulting decrease in the impedance magnitude at resonance is generally the desired effect, though there is no perceived or objective benefit to this. Again, this technique reduces efficiency and the same result can be achieved through selection of a driver with a lower Q factor, or even via electronic equalization. This is reinforced by the purveyors of AP membranes; they are often sold with an electronic processor which, via equalization, restores the bass output lost through the <b>mechanical</b> <b>damping.</b> The effect of the equalization is opposite to that of the AP membrane, resulting in a loss of damping and an effective response {{similar to that of the}} loudspeaker without the aperiodic membrane and electronic processor.|$|E

The DRXed grain size of the as-extruded Mg–Zr alloys decreased as the extrusion temperature T decreased and the strain rate ε˙ increased. As the DRXed grain size decreased, the strength and elongation of the as-extruded alloys exhibited improved performance through the grain refinement mechanism, while the damping properties deteriorated. The extrusion temperature of the Mg–Zr alloy had relatively greater effects on the <b>mechanical</b> and <b>damping</b> properties than the strain rate.

5000|$|A unitless measurement, {{characterizing the}} <b>mechanical</b> <b>damping</b> of the driver, that is, the {{losses in the}} {{suspension}} (surround and spider.) It varies roughly between 0.5 and 10, with a typical value around 3. High Qms indicates lower mechanical losses, and low Qms indicates higher losses. The main effect of Qms is on the impedance of the driver, with high Qms drivers displaying a higher impedance peak. One predictor for low Qms is a metallic voice coil former. These act as eddy-current brakes and increase damping, reducing Qms. They must be designed with an electrical break in the cylinder (so no conducting loop). Some speaker manufacturers have placed shorted turns {{at the top and}} bottom of the voice coil to prevent it leaving the gap, but the sharp noise created by this device when the driver is overdriven is alarming and was perceived as a problem by owners. High Qms drivers are often built with nonconductive formers made from paper or various plastics.|$|E

Nakamichi did this with its RX series. The RX-505 is not a compromise as many assumed but the very best method of maintaining azimuth without using the costly, complex and 'somewhat' fragile NAAC system even though the Akai GXC-65D was the first cassette deck to [...] "actually" [...] use this method where the cassette would flip over instead of the head being rotated but was done in a top-loading fashion as this were cassette decks from the early-mid 1970s.|$|E
