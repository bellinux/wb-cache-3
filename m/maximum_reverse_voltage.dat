50|$|The above {{descriptions}} assumed {{an ideal}} diode with zero {{resistance in the}} forward direction and infinite resistance in the reverse direction. The circuit designer must concern himself with real diodes. The articles p-n diode and a less detailed article p-n junction describe the physics of the PN diode. After all the discussion of electrons, holes, majority and minority carriers etc. each come down to an equation that most directly relates to the circuit designer. The real PN diode actually has a voltage current characteristic similar to the curve on the right. A more specific definition {{can be found in}} the Shockley diode equation. The designer of a reliable diode logic circuit is usually limited to what the diode specification provides which is often less than the equation suggests. Typically the specification will primarily provide a maximum forward voltage drop at one or more forward currents and a reverse leakage current. It will also provide a <b>maximum</b> <b>reverse</b> <b>voltage</b> limited by zener or avalanche breakdown. Typical worst case specifications are shown below for both germanium and silicon PN diodes.|$|E

50|$|For {{rectifier}} applications, peak {{inverse voltage}} (PIV) or peak <b>reverse</b> <b>voltage</b> (PRV) is the <b>maximum</b> value of <b>reverse</b> <b>voltage</b> which occurs {{at the peak of}} the input cycle when the diode is reverse-biased. The portion of the sinusoidal waveform which repeats or duplicates itself is known as the cycle. The part of the cycle above the horizontal axis is called the positive half-cycle, or alternation; the part of the cycle below the horizontal axis is called the negative alternation. With reference to the amplitude of the cycle, the {{peak inverse voltage}} is specified as the maximum negative value of the sine-wave within a cycle's negative alternation.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The reverse {{recovery}} {{characteristics of a}} 4 H-SiC PiN diode under higher voltage and faster switching are investigated. In a high-voltage 4 H-SiC PiN diode, owing to an increased thickness, the drift region does not become fully depleted at a relatively low voltage. Furthermore, an electron–hole recombination {{must be taken into}} account when the carrier lifetime is equal to or shorter than the {{reverse recovery}} time. High voltage and fast switching are therefore needed for accurate analysis of the reverse recovery characteristics. The current reduction rate increases up to 2 kA/µs because of low stray inductance. The <b>maximum</b> <b>reverse</b> <b>voltage</b> during the reverse recovery time reaches 8 kV, at which point the drift layer is fully depleted. The carrier lifetime at the high level injection is 0. 086 µs at room temperature and reaches 0. 53 µs at 250 °C...|$|E
40|$|Despite the {{excellent}} electrical and thermal properties of 4 H-silicon carbide (SiC), the fabrication of high-voltage SiC power devices is still proving problematic, being hindered by material defects {{resulting in low}} carrier lifetimes and forward voltage drift, and suboptimum ohmic contacts to p-type material. The PiN diode is one such device that suffers from the aforementioned problems, though {{at the same time}} is sought after for high voltage power electronics applications due to the prospect of greatly reduced power losses and increased power handling capability than the Si devices currently in use. As such, this thesis is focussed on the development of these devices, investigating various device structures to achieve high reverse blocking voltages as well as developing novel fabrication processes to improve the electrical performance of the devices. Electrical characterisation of ohmic contacts to p-type 4 H-SiC showed that Ti/Al-based metal schemes offered the lowest specific contact resistivity of approximately 2. 2 x 10 - 6 Ω-cm 2, which was achieved after annealing at 1000 °C for 2 minutes. Physical analysis showed that these annealing conditions were optimum for formation of the Ti 3 SiC 2 alloy at the metal-semiconductor interface, the presence of which was found to correlate with lower specific contact resistivity values. Electrical characterisation of first generation PiN diodes designed for blocking 3. 3 kV showed that the fabricated devices had a differential on-resistance (Ron,dif f) of 17 Ωm -cm 2 at 100 A/cm 2 and 25 °C, and near-ideal (η = 1. 3) characteristics in the diffusion current regime. Based on the measured reverse saturation currents, the carrier lifetime of the fabricated devices was estimated to be 480 ns. Reverse leakage currents were found to vary significantly across the devices, from 5 nA/cm 2 up to 200 μA/cm 2 at 100 V reverse bias and 25 °C. Second generation 3. 3 kV PiN diodes, which featured a B-implanted JTE structure, were found to block a <b>maximum</b> <b>reverse</b> <b>voltage</b> of 2. 8 kV, which was around 85...|$|E

The initial stage of carbonization and the surface morphology of carbonization layers of Si(100) are studied using reflection {{high energy electron diffraction}} (RHEED) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). It is shown that the optimized carbonization temperature for the growth of voids-free 3 S-SiC on Si (100) substrates is 1100 ℃. The electrical properties of SiC layers are characterized using Van der Pauw method. The I-V, C-V, and the temperature dependence of I-V characteristics in n- 3 C-SiC-p-Si heterojunctions with AuGeNi and Al electrical pads are investigated.

50|$|The {{most evident}} {{limitations}} of Schottky diodes are their relatively low <b>reverse</b> <b>voltage</b> ratings, and their relatively high reverse leakage current. For silicon-metal Schottky diodes, the <b>reverse</b> <b>voltage</b> is typically 50 V or less.

This topology requires fewer components compared to existing inverter topologies (particularly in higher levels) and requires fewer carrier signals and gate drives. Therefore the overall cost and complexity are greatly reduced particularly for higher output voltage levels. This paper describes the general multilevel inverter schematic and modified circuit having only seven switches for seven- level multilevel inverter using <b>reverse</b> <b>voltage</b> topology. A general method of multilevel modulation phase disposition (PD) SPWM is utilized to drive the inverter and can be extended to any number of voltage levels.
