40|$|The Monte Carlo {{simulation}} code CEARPPU {{has been}} improved to obtain better accuracy for predicting pulse-height spectra measured at high counting rates. Experimental verification {{was carried out}} by measuring an Fe- 55 spectrum with a Si(Li) X-ray spectrometer. Based on the spectrum measured at low counting rate, which is considered to be the “true ” spectrum with no pulse pile-up distortion, the predicted high counting-rate spectrum by CEARPPU is in excellent agreement with the measured one for all of the folded regions due to pulse pile-up. This code is available for public dissemination at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) through RSICC.

40|$|The {{causes of}} {{hypoxaemia}} in children include the commonest causes of childhood illness: pneumonia and other acute respiratory infections, and neonatal illness, particularly sepsis, low birthweight, birth asphyxia and aspiration syndromes.

Oximetry also has a well established role in surgery and anaesthesia, but in many countries children undergo surgery without the safety of oximetry monitoring.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the use of}} counterpropagating pulse trains to quasi-phase-match high-harmonic generation (HHG). Two novel techniques for generating trains of ultrafast pulses are described and demonstrated. The first method makes use of a birefringent crystal array to split a single pulse into a sequence of pulses. The second method makes use of the time-varying polarisation of a chirped pulse passed through a multiple-order wave plate to generate a train of pulses {{by the addition of}} a polariser. It is demonstrated that this second technique can be used to <b>make</b> <b>pulse</b> trains with non-uniform pulse separation by using an acousto-optic programmable dispersive filter to manipulate the higher-order dispersion encountered by the chirped pulse. The crystal array method is used to demonstrate quasi-phase-matching of HHG in a gas-filled capillary, using one and two counterpropagating pulses. Enhancements of up to 60 % of the intensity of the 27 th harmonic of the 800,nm driving laser light are observed. Information on the spatial and dynamic properties of the HHG process is obtained from measurements of the coherence length in the capillary. Simulations of HHG in a capillary waveguide have been performed. These agree well with the results of the quasi-phase-matching experiments. The effect of mode-beating on the generation process in a capillary and its use as a quasi-phase-matching mechanism are investigated. This thesis is not currently available in OR...|$|E
40|$|Efficient {{methods for}} {{quantifying}} dissociation constants {{have become increasingly}} important for high-throughput mutagenesis studies in the postgenomic era. However, experimentally determining binding affinity is often laborious, requires large amounts of purified protein, and utilizes specialized equipment. Recently, pulse proteolysis {{has been shown to}} be a robust and simple method to determine the dissociation constants for a protein–ligand pair based on the increase in thermodynamic stability upon ligand binding. Here, we extend this technique to determine binding affinities for a protein–protein complex involving the β-lactamase TEM- 1 and various β-lactamase inhibitor protein (BLIP) mutants. Interaction with BLIP results in an increase in the denaturation curve midpoint, Cm, of TEM- 1, which correlates with the rank order of binding affinities for several BLIP mutants. Hence, pulse proteolysis is a simple, effective method to assay for mutations that modulate binding affinity in protein–protein complexes. From a small set (n = 4) of TEM- 1 /BLIP mutant complexes, a linear relationship between energy of stabilization (dissociation constant) and ΔCm was observed. From this “calibration curve,” accurate dissociation constants for two additional BLIP mutants were calculated directly from proteolysis-derived ΔCm values. Therefore, in addition to qualitative information, armed with knowledge of the dissociation constants from the WT protein and a limited number of mutants, accurate quantitation of binding affinities can be determined for additional mutants from pulse proteolysis. Minimal sample requirements and the suitability of impure protein preparations are important advantages that <b>make</b> <b>pulse</b> proteolysis a powerful tool for high-throughput mutagenesis binding studies...|$|E

40|$|Pulse Detonation Engine Technology is {{currently}} being investigated at Glenn for both airbreathing and rocket propulsion applications. The potential for both mechanical simplicity and high efficiency due to the inherent near-constant-volume combustion process, may <b>make</b> <b>Pulse</b> Detonation Engines (PDE's) well suited {{for a number of}} mission profiles. Assessment of PDE cycles requires a simulation capability that is both fast and accurate. It should capture the essential physics of the system, yet run at speeds that allow parametric analysis. A quasi-one-dimensional, computational-fluid-dynamics-based simulation has been developed that may meet these requirements. The Euler equations of mass, momentum, and energy have been used along with a single reactive species transport equation, and submodels to account for dominant loss mechanisms (e. g., viscous losses, heat transfer, and valving) to successfully simulate PDE cycles. A high-resolution numerical integration scheme was chosen to capture the discontinuities associated with detonation, and robust boundary condition procedures were incorporated to accommodate flow reversals that may arise during a given cycle. The accompanying graphs compare experimentally measured and computed performance over a range of operating conditions for a particular PDE. Experimental data were supplied by Fred Schauer and Jeff Stutrud from the Air Force Research Laboratory at Wright-Patterson AFB and by Royce Bradley from Innovative Scientific Solutions, Inc. The left graph shows thrust and specific impulse, Isp, as functions of equivalence ratio for a PDE cycle in which the tube is completely filled with a detonable hydrogen/air mixture. The right graph shows thrust and specific impulse as functions of the fraction of the tube that is filled with a stoichiometric mixture of hydrogen and air. For both figures, the operating frequency was 16 Hz. The agreement between measured and computed values is quite good, both in terms of trend and magnitude. The error is under 10 percent everywhere except for the thrust value at an equivalence ratio of 0. 8 in the left figure, where it is 14 percent. The simulation results shown were made using 200 numerical cells. Each cycle of the engine, approximately 0. 06 sec, required 2. 0 min of CPU time on a Sun Ultra 2. The simulation {{is currently}} being used to analyze existing experiments, design new experiments, and predict performance in propulsion concepts where the PDE is a component (e. g., hybrid engines and combined cycles) ...|$|E

40|$|Tuning spectra by pulse shaping is {{feasible}} in both impulse radio (IR) and continuous radio transmissions, since, as well known, the impulse {{response of the}} pulse shaper affects the spectral properties of radiated signals. What is peculiar to IR-UWB, and <b>makes</b> <b>pulse</b> shaping particularly appealing, is the impulsive nature of the carrier. Given their very short duration, transmitted pulses in different intervals overlap neither on clock beats nor in between two clock beats. Spectrum matching in IR can thus be restricted with reasonable approximation to a single inter-pulse interval, and as such be redirected in a rather straightforward way into a waveform representation problem. This paper analyzes the above problem of tuning radiated IR-UWB signals to reference spectral patterns by pulse shaping, and shows the correspondence between spectrum and waveform matching problems. Examples of application include three case studies: matching the FCC emission masks, mitigating interference in the ISM bands, and reducing intersystem interference for two coexisting UWB networks. The proposed approach goes beyond the signal processing analysis to tentatively propose a procedure and related protocol for integrating spectral adaptation mechanisms into network operating principles.

Chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) and pigeonpea (Cajanus cajan [L.] Millsp.) are the two most important pulse crops grown under semi-arid tropical conditions and their production is hindered by biotic and abiotic constraints, including insect and disease incidence, infertile soils and climate variability.

With the ever increasing cost of pesticides and fertilizers and concern over environmental degradation, there has been a resurgence of interest to develop environment-friendly methods of crop production and protection (Jannouraa et al. 2013).
