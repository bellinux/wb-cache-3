Changes in musical texture were even smaller, <b>mellowing</b> the harmony {{near the end of}} the Omnes generationes movement being the most noticeable.|$|E

5|$|Much of the Leslie's unique tone {{is due to}} {{the fact}} that the system is at least {{partially}} enclosed, whereby linear louvres along the sides and front of the unit can vent the sound from within the box after the sound has bounced around inside, <b>mellowing</b> it. The crossover is deliberately set to 800Hz to give the optimum balance between the horn and the drum, and is considered an integral part of the speaker. The tone is also affected by the wood used. Tone differences, due to cost cutting using particle board for speaker and rotor shelves instead of the previous plywood, are evident in the Leslie's sound. The thinner ply of the top of the cabinet adds a certain resonance as well. Like an acoustic instrument, a Leslie's tone is uniquely defined by its cabinet design and construction, the amplifier, crossover and speakers used, and the motors — not merely by the spinning of rotors.|$|E

25|$|Much of the {{characteristic}} flavour of Madeira {{is due to}} this practice, which hastens the <b>mellowing</b> of the wine and also tends to check secondary fermentation {{in as much as}} it is, in effect, a mild kind of pasteurization. Furthermore, the wine is deliberately exposed to air, causing it to oxidize. The resulting wine has a colour similar to a tawny port wine.

25|$|By 1900, Dunedin was {{no longer}} the country's biggest city. Influence and {{activity}} moved north to the other centres ("the drift north"), a trend which continued for much of the following century. Despite this, the university continued to expand, and a student quarter became established. At the same time people started to notice Dunedin's <b>mellowing,</b> the ageing of its grand old buildings, with writers like E.H. McCormick pointing out its atmospheric charm. In the 1930s and early 1940s a new generation of artists such as M.T. (Toss) Woollaston, Doris Lusk, Anne Hamblett, Colin McCahon and Patrick Hayman once again represented the best of the country's talent. The Second World War saw the dispersal of these painters, but not before McCahon had met a very youthful poet, James K. Baxter, in a central city studio.|$|E

[...] Adams, on the other hand, was critical of the return of Hardin, noting that [...] "there's little reason to justify Melora Hardin's presence in 'The Whale other than [...] "an obligation [...] The Offices final-season victory lap." [...] White noted that it [...] "was nice to see Melora Hardin in the role one last time", but wrote that [...] "it's a shame that the show is sticking with the crazy version of the character rather than <b>mellowing</b> her out a bit". Melora Hardin's performance was later submitted by the producers of The Office for an [...] "Outstanding Guest Actor in Comedy Series" [...] Emmy consideration.|$|E

500|$|Francis Iles, {{writing in}} The Guardian, noting the short-story format, [...] "thought {{it better than}} the novels" [...] and wrote that [...] "the first story is full of the old wild improbabilities, {{but one of the}} others has a {{positively}} Maughamish flavour." [...] Iles also thought that [...] "it seems that one must either enjoy the novels of Mr. Ian Fleming beyond reason or be unable to read them at all." [...] Writing in The Guardians sister paper, The Observer, Maurice Richardson thought that [...] "our Casanovaesque cad-clubman secret agent is <b>mellowing</b> a bit now"; Richardson liked the format, saying that [...] "the short form suits him quite well" [...] although the downside is that [...] "if it checks the wilder fantasies it cuts short the love-affairs". Writing in The Spectator, Cyril Ray (under the pseudonym Christopher Pym) wrote that [...] "each episode of the Bond novels meant the adventure was less probable and more preposterous than the last, and now our hero seems to have lost, as well as any claims to plausibility, the know-how, the know-who, know-what and sheer zing that used to carry the unlikely plots along. Perhaps all that mattress pounding is taking it out of poor Bond".|$|E
