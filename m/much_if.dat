5|$|Like all Hawaiian volcanoes, Kīlauea {{was created}} as the Pacific tectonic plate moved over the Hawaiian hotspot in the Earth's {{underlying}} mantle. The Hawaii island volcanoes {{are the most}} recent evidence of this process that, over 70 million years, has created the -long Hawaiian–Emperor seamount chain. The prevailing, though not completely settled, {{view is that the}} hotspot has been largely stationary within the planet's mantle for <b>much,</b> <b>if</b> not all of the Cenozoic Era.

However, while Hawaiian volcanism is well understood and extensively studied, there remains no definite explanation of the mechanism that causes the hotspot effect.|$|E
5|$|The new {{ideals of}} humanism, {{although}} more secular in some aspects, developed against a Christian backdrop, {{especially in the}} Northern Renaissance. <b>Much,</b> <b>if</b> not most, of the new art was commissioned by or in dedication to the Church. However, the Renaissance {{had a profound effect}} on contemporary theology, particularly in the way people perceived the relationship between man and God. Many of the period's foremost theologians were followers of the humanist method, including Erasmus, Zwingli, Thomas More, Martin Luther, and John Calvin.|$|E

5|$|The manor was {{inherited}} in 1514 by Henry Daubeney, created Earl of Bridgewater for {{his services}} to Henry VIII. He {{spent much of his}} time in France and little time in Somerset. He may have begun the new house, but he went bankrupt and was involved in the disgrace of Catherine Howard, Henry VIII's fifth wife. It is unlikely that <b>much,</b> <b>if</b> any, of the current building was his work. The house was forfeit to the crown and then had various owners including Henry Grey, 1st Duke of Suffolk, who in 1552 sold it to William Clifton, a London merchant who had been assembling a Somerset estate. Clifton or his son John Clifton are thought to be responsible for most of the building at Barrington, possibly modeled on earlier work at Kirby Hall or East Anglian manors close to their roots at Kentwell Hall, Hengrave Hall or Channons Hall at Tibenham.|$|E
5|$|The time-line for Salamis is {{difficult}} to establish with any certainty. Herodotus presents the battle as though it occurred directly after the capture of Athens, but nowhere explicitly states as <b>much.</b> <b>If</b> Thermopylae/Artemisium occurred in September, then {{this may be the}} case, but it is probably more likely that the Persians spent two or three weeks capturing Athens, refitting the fleet, and resupplying. Clearly though, at some point after capturing Athens, Xerxes held a council of war with the Persian fleet; Herodotus says this occurred at Phalerum. Artemisia, queen of Halicarnassus and commander of its naval squadron in Xerxes's fleet, tried to convince him to wait for the Allies to surrender believing that battle in the straits of Salamis was an unnecessary risk. Nevertheless, Xerxes and his chief advisor Mardonius pressed for an attack.|$|E

The {{reserves}} were tired after night marches, to reach the front in secrecy and were not available until 2pm, but were thrown into battle without success on the second day, {{although it is not}} clear that they would have accomplished <b>much</b> <b>if</b> available on the first day, as Haig had wanted.|$|E

25|$|Craig Miller has {{investigated}} {{the possibility that}} Swedenborg influenced Joseph Smith, as there are similarities between some of their teachings. He concludes that Smith may have learned something about Swedenborg through third parties, but was unlikely to have read <b>much</b> <b>if</b> any of Swedenborg's works for himself. Among Smith's connections was Sarah Cleveland, who {{was married to a}} Swedenborgian {{at the time of her}} plural marriage to Smith in 1842. It was shortly afterwards, in July 1843, that Smith recorded receiving a revelation regarding eternal marriage in Doctrine and Covenants 132.|$|E
25|$|The 1970s {{was when}} Hong Kong gained daily news broadcasts. News {{programmes}} {{ranked in the}} top 10 continuously for a decade. Other segments of the ratings included TV dramas, which averaged 80 to 120 episodes, usually broadcasting at 7:00pm. 66% of the population tuned in regularly covering 2 to 3million viewers nightly. Popular series finales would empty streets and restaurants. Most series did not contain <b>much</b> <b>if</b> any Chinese traditionalism. The theme songs of these dramas also helped revive Cantonese music - indeed the term Cantopop was coined during this period.|$|E

He also points to the failure to disclose when 'the primary commercial intent' is to make money for retailers and distributors in rich countries.|$|E
25|$|The Csa zone is {{associated}} to areas with hot summers. It is predominant in the Mediterranean and Southern Atlantic coast and inland throughout Andalusia, Extremadura and <b>much,</b> <b>if</b> not most, of {{the centre of}} the country. The Csa zone covers climatic zones with both relatively warm and cold winters which are considered extremely different to each other at a local level, reason for which Köppen classification is often eschewed within Spain. Local climatic maps generally divide the Mediterranean zone (which covers most of the country) between warm-winter and cold-winter zones, rather than according to summer temperatures.|$|E
25|$|The {{third most}} {{important}} source for {{this period of}} Munster history are the Annals of the Four Masters, but they were compiled much later and are occasionally of doubtful reliability, suffering in some cases from interpolations, misplaced entries, and so on. They also cover little of Ivar himself and serve mostly for the major sources above to be checked against in places. A few other sources briefly mentioning Ivar survive but altogether these do not contribute <b>much</b> <b>if</b> anything to our knowledge of him. The Annals of Tigernach might have been of assistance but they no longer survive for over two centuries between 766 and 974.|$|E

25|$|Although {{conscientiousness}} {{is generally}} {{seen as a}} positive trait to possess, recent {{research has suggested that}} in some situations it may be harmful for well-being. In a prospective study of 9570 individuals over four years, highly conscientious people suffered more than twice as <b>much</b> <b>if</b> they became unemployed. The authors suggested {{this may be due to}} conscientious people making different attributions about why they became unemployed, or through experiencing stronger reactions following failure. This finding is consistent with perspectives which see no trait as inherently positive or negative, but rather the consequences of the trait being dependent on the situation and concomitant goals and motivations.|$|E
25|$|Although its {{strongly}} conservative {{views on}} theology and ethics {{might seem to}} make the LCMS politically compatible with Protestant evangelicals and fundamentalists in the U.S., the LCMS largely eschews political activity, partly out of concerns to keep the denomination untainted with potential heresies and also because of its strict understanding of the Lutheran distinction between the Two Kingdoms (see above), which repudiates the primarily Calvinist presuppositions about the totalizing rule of God that informs <b>much,</b> <b>if</b> not most, of U.S. evangelical understanding of politics and Christianity. However, both LCMS and Evangelicals share the common belief that life begins and should be protected by law since conception.|$|E
25|$|Some memoirs have {{revived the}} {{simmering}} controversy over who or what, exactly, {{was to blame}} for the overshoot, suggesting, for example, that Carpenter was distracted by the science and engineering experiments dictated by the flight plan and by the well-reported fireflies phenomenon. Yet fuel consumption and other aspects of the vehicle operation were, during Project Mercury, as <b>much,</b> <b>if</b> not more, the responsibility of the ground controllers. Moreover, hardware malfunctions went unidentified, while organizational tensions between the astronaut office and the flight controller office—tensions that NASA did not resolve until the later Gemini and Apollo programs—may account for much of the latter-day criticism of Carpenter's performance during his flight.|$|E
