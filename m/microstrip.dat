5|$|The {{introduction}} of printed planar technologies greatly simplified {{the manufacture of}} many microwave components including filters, and microwave integrated circuits then became possible. It is not known when planar transmission lines originated, but experiments using them were recorded as early as 1936. The inventor of printed stripline, however, is known; this was Robert M. Barrett who published the idea in 1951.Barrett, 1952,Niehenke et al., p.846. This caught on rapidly, and Barrett's stripline soon had fierce commercial competition from rival planar formats, especially triplate and <b>microstrip.</b> The generic term stripline in modern usage usually refers to the form then known as triplate.|$|E
5|$|For {{clarity of}} presentation, the {{diagrams}} {{in this article}} are drawn with the components implemented in stripline format. This does not imply an industry preference, although planar transmission line formats (that is, formats where conductors consist of flat strips) are popular because they can be implemented using established printed circuit board manufacturing techniques. The structures shown can also be implemented using <b>microstrip</b> or buried stripline techniques (with suitable adjustments to dimensions) and can be adapted to coaxial cables, twin leads and waveguides, although some structures are more suitable for some implementations than others. The open wire implementations, for instance, of a number of structures are shown in the second column of figure 3 and open wire equivalents can be found for most other stripline structures. Planar transmission lines are also used in integrated circuit designs.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we {{consider}} the finite element modeling of multilayer transmission lines for high-speed digital interconnects. We mainly focused on the modeling of the transmission structures with both cases of symmetric and asymmetric geometries. We specifically designed asymmetric coupled <b>microstrips</b> and four-line symmetric coupled <b>microstrips</b> with a two-layer substrate. We computed the capacitance matrix for asymmetric coupled <b>microstrips</b> and the capacitance, and inductance matrices for four-line symmetric coupled <b>microstrips</b> on a twolayer substrate.

25|$|A {{dielectric}} waveguide employs a solid dielectric rod {{rather than a}} hollow pipe. An optical fibre is a dielectric guide designed to work at optical frequencies.

25|$|The CMS tracker is made {{entirely of}} silicon: the pixels, {{at the very}} core of the {{detector}} and dealing with the highest intensity of particles, and the silicon <b>microstrip</b> detectors that surround it. As particles travel through the tracker the pixels and microstrips produce tiny electric signals that are amplified and detected. The tracker employs sensors covering {{an area the size of}} a tennis court, with 75 million separate electronic read-out channels: in the pixel detector there are some 6000 connections per square centimetre.|$|E
25|$|Each trace {{consists}} of a flat, narrow part of the copper foil that remains after etching. Its resistance, determined by its width, thickness, and length, must be sufficiently low for the current the conductor will carry. Power and ground traces {{may need to be}} wider than signal traces. In a multi-layer board one entire layer may be mostly solid copper to act as a ground plane for shielding and power return. For microwave circuits, transmission lines can be laid out in a planar form such as stripline or <b>microstrip</b> with carefully controlled dimensions to assure a consistent impedance. In radio-frequency and fast switching circuits the inductance and capacitance of the printed circuit board conductors become significant circuit elements, usually undesired; but they {{can be used as a}} deliberate part of the circuit design, obviating the need for additional discrete components.|$|E

500|$|Waveguides {{have good}} power {{handling}} capability, {{which leads to}} filter applications in radar.

500|$|The λ/4 coupled line {{design is}} good for coaxial and {{stripline}} implementations but does not work so well in the now popular <b>microstrip</b> format, although designs do exist. [...] The {{reason for this is}} that <b>microstrip</b> is not a homogeneous medium – there are two different mediums above and below the transmission strip. [...] This leads to transmission modes other than the usual TEM mode found in conductive circuits. [...] The propagation velocities of even and odd modes are different leading to signal dispersion. [...] A better solution for <b>microstrip</b> is a coupled line much shorter than λ/4, shown in figure 5, but this has the disadvantage of a coupling factor which rises noticeably with frequency. [...] A variation of this design sometimes encountered has the coupled line a higher impedance than the main line such as shown in figure 6. [...] This design is advantageous where the coupler is being fed to a detector for power monitoring. [...] The higher impedance line results in a higher RF voltage for a given main line power making the work of the detector diode easier.Vizmuller, pp.102–103 ...|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} the dc electric response induced by ferromagnetic resonance in ferromagnetic Permalloy (Ni 80 Fe 20) <b>microstrips.</b> The resulting magnetization precession alters {{the angle of}} the magnetization with respect to both dc and rf current. Consequently the time averaged anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR) changes (photoresistance). At the same time the time-dependent AMR oscillation rectifies a part of the rf current and induces a dc voltage (photovoltage). A phenomenological approach to magnetoresistance is used to describe the distinct characteristics of the photoresistance and photovoltage with a consistent formalism, which is found in excellent agreement with experiments performed on in-plane magnetized ferromagnetic <b>microstrips.</b> Application of the microwave photovoltage effect for rf magnetic field sensing is discussed.

500|$|A {{particular}} {{feature of}} waveguide filter design concerns {{the mode of}} transmission.
