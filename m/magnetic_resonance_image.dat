40|$|Abstract. The aim of {{the paper}} is to compare {{classification}} error of the classifiers applied to <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> <b>images</b> for each descriptor used for feature extraction. We compared several Support Vector Machine (SVM) techniques, neural networks and k nearest neighbor classifier for classification of <b>Magnetic</b> <b>Resonance</b> <b>Images</b> (MRIs). Different descriptors are applied to provide feature extraction from the images. The dataset used for classification contains <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> <b>images</b> classified in 9 classes...|$|R
40|$|A novel neural network-based {{technique}} for segmentation of single-channel <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> <b>images</b> is presented. The segmentation of single-channel <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> <b>images</b> is {{a daunting task}} due to the relatively little information available at each pixel site. The proposed algorithm is based on unsupervised clustering {{by means of a}} Kohonen Self-Organizing Map: unsupervised segmentation algorithms are highly desirable in order to eliminate intra- and interobserver variability. Particular attention has been devoted to the choice of suitable features, in order to ensure an accurate and reliable segmentation: in particular, a feature set extracted from the neighborhood of each pixel has been evaluated. The proposed technique has been tested on simulated <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> <b>images</b> to assess its stability against the presence of noise and intensity inhomogeneities. Moreover, it has been tested on real <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> <b>images</b> of both volunteers and brain tumor patients. The preliminary results presented make the proposed technique a promising alternative for the segmentation of single-channel <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> <b>images</b> and encourage further investigation...|$|R

25|$|The {{successful}} {{outcome of}} fat-graft breast augmentation {{is enhanced by}} achieving a pre-expanded recipient site to create the breast-tissue matrix that will receive grafts of autologous adipocyte fat. The recipient site is expanded with an external vacuum tissue-expander applied upon each breast. The biological effect of negative pressure (vacuum) expansion upon soft tissues derives from the ability of soft tissues to grow when subjected to controlled, distractive, mechanical forces. (see distraction osteogenesis) The study Non-surgical Breast Enlargement using an External Soft Tissue Expansion System (2000) reported the technical effectiveness of recipient-site pre-expansion. In a single-group study, 17 healthy women (aged 18–40 years) wore a brassiere-like vacuum system that applied a 20-mmHg vacuum (controlled, mechanical, distraction force) to each breast for 10–12 hours daily for 10-weeks. Pre- and post-procedure, the breast volume (size) was periodically measured; likewise, a <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> <b>image</b> (MRI) of the breast-tissue architecture and water density was taken during the same phase of the patient's menstrual cycle; of the 17-woman study group, 12 completed the study, and 5 withdrew, because of non-compliance with the clinical trial protocol.|$|E
500|$|Through July 15, Molina led the NL with a [...]341 (110 hits in 323 at-bats) batting average.

[...] The Cardinals placed Molina on the 15-day disabled list on July 31 due to a right knee sprain. At the time he went on the DL, Molina was batting [...]330 with eight homers, thirty doubles, and 54 RBI. A <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> <b>image</b> (MRI) indicated inflammation but no structural damage, so the knee was drained of excess fluid buildup and Molina was given a cortisone injection.|$|E

40|$|Aim: To {{develop and}} {{validate}} a new instrument measuring patient anxiety during <b>Magnetic</b> <b>Resonance</b> <b>Imaging</b> examinations, <b>Magnetic</b> <b>Resonance</b> Imaging-Anxiety Questionnaire. Background: Questionnaires measuring patients’ anxiety during <b>Magnetic</b> <b>Resonance</b> <b>Imaging</b> examinations {{have been the}} same as used {{in a wide range of}} conditions. To learn about patients’ experience during examination and to evaluate interventions, a specific questionnaire measuring patient anxiety during <b>Magnetic</b> <b>Resonance</b> <b>Imaging</b> is needed. Design: Psychometric cross-sectional study with test-retest design. Methods: A new questionnaire, <b>Magnetic</b> <b>Resonance</b> Imaging-Anxiety Questionnaire, was designed from patient expressions of anxiety in <b>Magnetic</b> <b>Resonance</b> Imagingscanners. The sample was recruited between October 2012 –October 2014. Factor structure was evaluated with exploratory factor analysis and internal consistency with Cronbach’s alpha. Criterion-related validity, known-group validity and test-retest was calculated. Results: Patients referred for <b>Magnetic</b> <b>Resonance</b> <b>Imaging</b> of either the spine or the heart, were invited to participate. The development and validation of <b>Magnetic</b> <b>Resonance</b> Imaging-Anxiety Questionnaire resulted in 15 items consisting of two factors. Cronbach’s alpha was found to be high. <b>Magnetic</b> <b>Resonance</b> Imaging-Anxiety Questionnaire correlated higher with instruments measuring anxiety than with depression scales. Known-group validity demonstrated a higher level of anxiety for patients undergoing <b>Magnetic</b> <b>Resonance</b> <b>Imaging</b> scan of the heart than for those examining the spine. Test-retest reliability demonstrated acceptable level for the scale. Conclusion: <b>Magnetic</b> <b>Resonance</b> Imaging-Anxiety Questionnaire bridges a gap among existing questionnaires, making it a simple and useful tool for measuring patient anxiety during <b>Magnetic</b> <b>Resonance</b> <b>Imaging</b> examinations...|$|R

40|$|Multiparametric <b>Magnetic</b> <b>Resonance</b> <b>Imaging</b> {{has been}} {{increasingly}} used for detection, localization and staging {{of prostate cancer}} over the last years. It combines high-resolution T 2 Weighted-Imaging {{and at least two}} functional techniques, which include Dynamic Contrast–Enhanced <b>Magnetic</b> <b>Resonance</b> <b>Imaging,</b> Diffusion-Weighted <b>Imaging,</b> and <b>Magnetic</b> <b>Resonance</b> <b>Imaging</b> Spectroscopy. Although the combined use of a pelvic phased-array and an Endorectal Coil is considered the state-of-the-art for <b>Magnetic</b> <b>Resonance</b> <b>Imaging</b> evaluation of prostate cancer, Endorectal Coil is only absolute mandatory for <b>Magnetic</b> <b>Resonance</b> <b>Imaging</b> Spectroscopy at 1. 5 T. Sensitivity and specificity levels in cancer detection and localization have been improving with functional technique implementation, compared to T 2 Weighted-Imaging alone. It has been particularly useful to evaluate patients with abnormal PSA and negative biopsy. Moreover, the information added by the functional techniques may correlate to cancer aggressiveness and therefore be useful to select patients for focal radiotherapy, prostate sparing surgery, focal ablative therapy and active surveillance.
