We observed a peculiar type of this process when light-exposed particles of titanium dioxide or some other minerals initiated an electron transfer from organic electron donors to Clostridium butyricum bacterial cells, with hydrogen being evolved {{as a result of}} intra- and extracellular activity of hydrogenase. The coupling of mineral photocatalysts to bacterial cells may be regarded as a way to create a new type of photobiocatalytic system...|$|E

To provide cell functions, the enzymes of <b>metabolic</b> <b>chains,</b> molecules of signaling pathways, and macroergs (as units of molecular interactions, accompanied by energy consumption) should find their partners and get their precise spatial relationship. The current views are based on ideas of compartmentalization of all processes as local sites of cellular matrix membrane, where specific stages of different metabolic cycles take place. The assembly of complexes of macromolecules in the number and combinations, required for their adequate functioning {{in the space of}} a cell, is generally described as intracellular transport of vesicles, implemented by mobile elements of cytoskeleton. Inside the vesicle there is «effective load» – macromolecules. The membranes of these vesicles fuse with specific sites of the matrix membranes and therefore relocate macromolecules. Neither calculations nor assumptions allow explaining precise formation of enzymatic chains, their interaction, signaling, etc. on this basis. Such transport of macromolecules (inside vesicles) enables solving other tasks. The concept of search-and-address systems in the form of space-scanning micro vesicles is proposed and well-grounded for purposes of searching for partners, forming chains and complexes, and building compartments. The micro vesicles collect corresponding chains of enzymes, signaling, and ensure the interactions on their surface. These micro vesicles are exactly those compartments, which provide for both precision of processes and their relationship...|$|E

40|$|Summary. Adaptive changes {{driven by}} {{ecological}} stresses can be investigated at various hierarchical levels – from molecular up to coenotic. Of particular interest is adaptation directed at altering key plant physiological processes {{in response to}} negative and unusual ecological factors. Patterns of physiological adaptation can be classified {{within the framework of}} ecological strategy. One of the most widely used classifications has been proposed by Ramensky and Grime (1971, 1988). Adaptation to stress in plants is regulated by a complex of molecular and genetic mechanisms that activate stress responses to prevent protein degradation and cellular component destruction and restore homeostasis. Since protein biosynthesis is a key link in the <b>metabolic</b> <b>chain</b> and because phytohormones regulate and coordinate such fundamental processes as growth, development, photo- and biosynthesis and respiration, their expression profiles are likely to vary between plants that adopt different stress response strategies. In this study, we investigated the utility of proteins, especially members of stress protein families, and of phytohormones as biomarkers for different ecological adaptation strategies.

This same bacterium {{is able to}} oxidize D-malate slowly when it is used as the sole carbon source, but is unable to grow on it. Possible pathways and explanations of this phenomena are postulated. In recent years the metabolism of malate enantiomers in various species of Pseudomonas {{has been the subject}} of considerable investigation. This results from the fact that the microbial metabolism of the dihydroxphenol, gentisic acid, has been shown to include D-malate in the <b>metabolic</b> <b>chain</b> (Hopper, Chapman, and Dagley, 1968, p. 65). This compound is not the naturally occurring form of malate found in the tricarboxylic acid cycle, but its enantiomer.

Plant growth and development, GSH level and GSH 2 expression at seedling, branching, and flowering stages were studied. Cu at lower concentrations had a stimulating effect on seedling height and root length. A significant positive correlation was observed between heavy metal concentrations and inhibition of plant growth. Plant height, root length and lateral root numbers decreased progressively with increasing concentrations of Cu and Pb. Except at the seedling stage, the metal mixture elicited a synergistic effect on safflower growth and development. The GSH content was significantly reduced in both safflower roots and leaves at increased concentrations of heavy metals, {{with the exception of}} the treatment with a low concentration of Cu that resulted in a slightl increase in GSH content at the seedling and branching stages. RT-PCR analysis revealed a negative correlation between GSH 2 expression levels and metal concentration. Short exposure to low concentrations of Cu induce an increase in GSH synthesis to preserve normal plant growth, whereas prolonged exposure and large Cu and Pb concentrations affect the GSH <b>metabolic</b> <b>chain,</b> and are severely toxicity.

40|$|Currently risk {{assessment}} tackles chemicals as single substances affecting individual health endpoints while, in reality, man {{is exposed to}} mixtures of chemicals present in the environment and consumer products. This may result in lower or greater toxicity of mixtures than what would be expected by summing the toxicity of individual chemicals. The extent {{of the change in}} tissue dose depends on the concentrations of all components and the mechanism(s) of biochemical interaction among them. Physiologically based pharmacokinetic models (PBPK) are mathematical descriptions of absorption, distribution, metabolism and elimination of chemicals in the body, which can be particularly useful in addressing environmental mixture toxicity. In this work we present a pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PBPK/PD) model for benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and all xylenes that accounts for the interactions among these chemicals at the sites of metabolism. The PBPK/PD model was coupled to a model of the <b>metabolic</b> <b>chain</b> of benzene to estimate the biologically effective dose of benzene metabolites, the main culprits for benzene toxicity.

40|$|The {{dynamics}} of many microbial ecosystems {{are driven by}} cross-feeding interactions, in which metabolites excreted by some species are metabolised further by others. The population {{dynamics of}} such ecosystems are governed by frequency-dependent selection, which allows for stable coexistence {{of two or more}} species. We have analysed a model of cross-feeding based on the replicator equation, with the aim of establishing criteria for coexistence in ecosystems containing three species, given the information of the three species' ability to coexist in their three separate pairs, i. e. the long term dynamics in the three two-species component systems. The triple-system is studied statistically and the probability of coexistence in the species triplet is computed for two models of species interactions. The interaction parameters are modelled either as stochastically independent or organised in a hierarchy where any derived metabolite carries less energy than previous nutrients in the <b>metabolic</b> <b>chain.</b> We differentiate between different modes of coexistence with respect to the pair-wise dynamics of the species, and find that the probability of coexistence is close to $\frac 12 $ for triplet systems with three pair-wise coexistent pairs and for so-called intransitive systems. Systems with two and one pair-wise coexistent pairs are more likely to exist for random interaction parameters, but are on the other hand much less likely to exhibit triplet coexistence. Hence we conclude that certain species triplets are, from a statistical point of view, rare, but if allowed to interact are likely to coexist.

40|$|Discussions {{of active}} {{transport}} usually assume stoichiometry between {{the rate of}} transport J+ and the metabolic rate Jr. However, the observation of a linear relationship between J+ and Jr does not imply a stoichiometric relationship, i. e., complete coupling. Since coupling may possibly be incomplete, we examine systems of an arbitrary degree of coupling q, regarding stoichiometry as a limiting case. We consider a sodium pump, with J+ and Jr linear functions of the electrochemical potential difference, -X+, and the chemical affinity of the metabolic driving reaction, A. The affinity is well defined even for various complex reaction pathways. Incorporation of a series barrier and a parallel leak {{does not affect the}} linearity of the composite observable system. The affinity of some region of the <b>metabolic</b> <b>chain</b> may be maintained constant, either by large pools of reactants or by regulation. If so, this affinity can be evaluated by two independent methods. Sodium transport is conveniently characterized by the open-circuit potential (Δψ) I= 0 and the natural limits, level flow (J+) X+= 0, and static head X 0 + = (X+) J+= 0. With high degrees of coupling -X 0 +/F approaches the electromotive force ENa (Ussing); -X 0 +/F cannot be identified with ((RT/F) ln f) X+= 0, where f is the flux ratio. The efficiency η = -J+X+/JrA is of significance only when appreciable energy is being converted from one form to another. When either J+ or -X+ is small η is low; the significant parameters are then the efficacies εJ+ = J+/JrA and εX+ = -X+/JrA, respectively maximal at level flow and static head. Leak increases both J+ and εJ+ for isotonic saline reabsorption, but diminishes -X 0 + and εX♀. Electrical resistance reflects both passive parameters and metabolism.

Modeling of biological networks is done by differential equations; the systemsare typically nonlinear, of large dimensions, with different time scales, and complex toanalyze. First, using techniques of monotone and compartmental systems, we study theglobal stability of the equilibrium of Michaelis-Menten enzymatic model without anyapproximation, when the system is closed or opened; we also study the general case of achain of enzymatic reactions. Biological networks are generally composed of two partsin interaction (genetic and metabolic), we therefore investigate different types of modelscoupling <b>metabolic</b> reactions <b>chains</b> with a genetic system; we reduce the full systembased on the difference in time scales (Tikhonov theorem). In the second part, we applythe same techniques of monotone systems to study a general model of gene expression. Then we consider {{a model of a}} loop where the polymerase allows the transcription ofthe gene of polymerase. This model is not monotone, but based on the parameter valuesprovided by biologists, we have reduced it to a simple and monotone model. The studyof the reduced system shows that the full system can have either a single equilibriumpoint at the origin which is globally stable or there is another one stable strictly positiveequilibrium and the origin is locally unstable. The alternative between these two casesdepends on the total amount of the concentration of ribosomes. We then study a generalmodel of the genetic machinery, taking the model studied previously for the polymeraseand coupling it with a model for the synthesis of ribosomes.

Why this mechanism fails when lactate levels rapidly rise, and why some hindgut communities can recover is unknown.

As my younger brother got this disease early in his childhood I have got a special interest in this disease. The term mitochondrial myopathy refers to a group of neuromuscular disorders that all result in decrease of energy production in the body s tissues. Mitochondria, which are found in all cells in the body, are responsible for the generation of energy in the cells. When the mitochondria are not working properly, there is an energy shortage within the body and those organs that consume large amounts of energy such as muscle cells and neurons are often affected. The result is often muscle weakness, fatigue, and problems with the heart, eyes, and various other systems. Mitochondrial myopathies are typically caused by defects in a part of the mitochondria called the respiratory chain. The respiratory chain consists of four protein complexes known as type I, II, III and IV. If there is a deficiency in any of these complexes, the affected individual will have mitochondrial myopathy. Mitochondrial disorders are typically inherited disease. That is, they are passed from parent to child.

Thus the enzyme is synthesized with a short cleavable sequence and bears at least one high-mannose oligosaccharide <b>chain.</b> <b>Metabolic</b> labelling in hepatocytes cultured with [35 S]methionine also generated a single immunoreactive polypeptide of 62 kDa, which was decreased to 60 kDa in size by treatment with endo-H or addition of tunicamycin to the culture medium. This confirms the molecular homogeneity and the glycosylation of the enzyme in the intact cell. Culture media contained no pI- 6. 4 -esterase-related protein, whether tunicamycin was present or not. The processing steps in the synthesis of pI- 6. 4 esterase are thus, as for other esterases of the endoplasmic reticulum [Robbi & Beaufay (1986) Eur. J. Biochem. 158, 187 - 194; (1987) Biochem. J. 248, 545 - 550] indistinguishable from those occurring early in the synthesis of secretory proteins. Glycosylation is apparently not the sorting signal responsible for their retention in the endoplasmic reticulum...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Five {{diseases}} are currently screened on dried blood spots in France {{through the national}} newborn screening programme. Tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) is a technology that is increasingly used to screen newborns for {{an increasing number of}} hereditary <b>metabolic</b> diseases. Medium <b>chain</b> acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (MCADD) is among these diseases. We sought to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of introducing MCADD screening in France. Methods We developed a decision model to evaluate, from a societal perspective and a lifetime horizon, the cost-effectiveness of expanding the French newborn screening programme to include MCADD. Published and, where available, routine data sources were used. Both costs and health consequences were discounted {{at an annual rate of}} 4 %. The model was applied to a French birth cohort. One-way sensitivity analyses and worst-case scenario simulation were performed. Results We estimate that MCADD newborn screening in France would prevent each year five deaths and the occurrence of neurological sequelae in two children under 5 [*]years, resulting in a gain of 128 life years or 138 quality-adjusted life years (QALY). The incremental cost per year is estimated at € 2. 5 million, down to € 1 million if this expansion is combined with a replacement of the technology currently used for phenylketonuria screening by MS/MS. The resulting incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) is estimated at € 7 580 /QALY. Sensitivity analyses indicate that while the results are robust to variations in the parameters, the model is most sensitive to the cost of neurological sequelae, MCADD prevalence, screening effectiveness and screening test cost. The worst-case scenario suggests an ICER of € 72 000 /QALY gained. Conclusions Although France has not defined any threshold for judging whether the implementation of a health intervention is an efficient allocation of public resources, we conclude that the expansion of the French newborn screening programme to MCADD would appear to be cost-effective. The results of this analysis have been used to produce recommendations for the introduction of universal newborn screening for MCADD in France. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{synthesis}} of the extensively O-glycosylated attachment protein, G, of human respiratory syncytial virus and its expression on the cell surface were examined in a mutant Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line, ldlD, which has a defect in protein O glycosylation. These cells, {{used in conjunction with}} an inhibitor of N-linked oligosaccharide synthesis, can be used to establish conditions in which no carbohydrate addition occurs or in which either N-linked or O-linked carbohydrate addition occurs exclusively. A recombinant vaccinia virus expression vector for the G protein was constructed which, as well as containing the human respiratory syncytial virus G gene, contained a portion of the cowpox virus genome that circumvents the normal host range restriction of vaccinia virus in CHO cells. The recombinant vector expressed high levels of G protein in both mutant ldlD and wild-type CHO cells. Several immature forms of the G protein were identified that contained exclusively N-linked or O-linked oligosaccharide side <b>chains.</b> <b>Metabolic</b> pulse-chase studies indicated that the pathway of maturation for the G protein proceeds from {{synthesis of}} the 32 -kilodalton (kDa) polypeptide accompanied by cotranslational attachment of high-mannose N-linked sugars to form an intermediate with an apparent mass of 45 kDa. This step is followed by the Golgi-associated conversion of the N-linked sugars to the complex type and the completion of the O-linked oligosaccharides to achieve the mature 90 -kDa form of G. Maturation from the 45 -kDa N-linked form to the mature 90 -kDa form occurred only in the presence of O-linked sugar addition, confirming that O-linked oligosaccharides constitute a significant proportion of the mass of the mature G protein. In the absence of O glycosylation, forms of G bearing galactose-deficient truncated N-linked and fully mature N-linked oligosaccharides were observed. The effects of N- and O-linked sugar addition on the transport of G to the cell surface were measured. Indirect immunofluorescence and flow cytometry showed that G protein could be expressed on the cell surface in the absence of either O glycosylation or N glycosylation. However, cell surface expression of G lacking both N- and O-linked oligosaccharides was severely depressed...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION: This {{capstone}} {{project is}} modeled after a National Institutes of Health R 21 grant application {{to evaluate the}} relationship between tuberculosis (TB) antibiotic treatment and 1) gut microbiota and 2) long-term metabolic functions among pediatric patients {{less than five years}} old or greater than five years old, residing in Dekalb county. AIM: The proposed study specific aims are to 1) determine the relationship between standard drug-sensitive antibiotic TB regimens on the gut microbiota (total density and taxa) at the time of TB treatment completion and one-year after treatment completion; 2) determine the relationship between standard drug-sensitive antibiotic TB regimens and <b>metabolic</b> biomarkers (Short <b>Chain</b> Fatty Acids (SCFAs), amino acids (Branched Chain and Aromatic), cholesterol, and glucose) at the time of treatment and one-year follow-up. SIGNIFICANCE: In the last ten years, antibiotic use has increased substantially, correlating with the increase incidence of childhood obesity and diabetes. This trend may partially be explained by an association between broad-spectrum antibiotic usage during childhood and the dysbiosis of the gut microbiome. The disruption of the gut microbiota induces the dysregulation of metabolic pathways, which may lead to the increased risk of developing obesity and diabetes. In 2015, TB accounted for 1 million incident cases in children. Given antibiotic treatment for TB requires exposure to multiple antibiotics for more than six consecutive months, this proposal intends to understand the extent to which exposure to TB treatment may impact the gut microbiome and whether antibiotic induced dysbiosis in the gut microbiome has long-term impact on pediatric metabolic function. APPROACH: Eligibility criteria includes all TB pediatric patients (3 ̆c 15 years of age) residing in DeKalb county, receiving care for drug-susceptible pulmonary TB by the DeKalb Refugee Clinic within the Dekalb County Board of Health. Patients with previous history of diabetes, obesity, or HIV will be excluded. STUDY DESIGN: We will perform a prospective cohort study of N= 50 pulmonary drug-susceptible pediatric TB patients from 2018 - 2020. At the time of baseline, TB treatment completion, and one-year follow-up the primary measures collected will be total density and taxa distribution of the gut microbiome. We will also collect SCFA, branched chain and aromatic amino acids, fasting glucose, A 1 c, and fasting cholesterol. Baseline measures will act as an internal comparison group for each patient...|$|R
40|$|Introduction In general breast-fed infants suffer {{less from}} infection, {{which could be}} partly {{explained}} by the specific compostion and metabolic activity of their intestinal microflora. During the last two decades, many {{attempts have been made}} to mimic the intestinal flora of breast fed infants in formula fed infants. Both prebiotics and probiotics based concepts have been developed to beneficially change the intestinal microflora and thus induce positive health effects. We conducted two infant nutrition studies with the objective to compare the effects of infant formulas containing either prebiotics or probiotics in infants on the composition (% bifidobacteria and lactobacilli) and <b>metabolic</b> activity (short <b>chain</b> fatty acid profile, lactate concentration and pH) of the intestinal microflora and on Indicators of development of the secretory immune response (faecal SlgA concentration). Study design In both studies, infants were enrolled within 3 days after delivery and followed during the first 32 weeks of life. Except for the intervention, the design of both studies was identical. Infants of whom the mothers decided not to breast-feed, were at random and double blindly allocated to one of the formula groups. A group of breast-fed infants was included as a reference. The first study, included 63 infants that were breast fed, 19 fed aregular, non-supplemented infant formula, 19 received infant formula containing a mixture of 0. 6 g/ 100 ml GOS (90 %) and FOS (10 %), 19 received standard formula containing 6. 0 x 109 / 100 ml viable Bifidobacterium animalis strain Bb- 12. The second study included 38 infants on breast milk, 17 on standard, unsupplemented formula and 17 on formula containing 0. 6 g/ 100 ml GOS. During intervention, parents were asked to take faeces samples from the diaper of their infants on postnatal day 5, 10, 28 and once every 4 weeks thereafter. Results The GOS/FOS-, GOS-, Bb- 12 formula aU induced an intestinal microflora dominated by bifidobacteria (59. 2 % 7. 7 %, 76. 5 : 1 : 2. 6 % and 69. 7 : 1 : 2. 7 % mean :l:SEM resp. at 16 w) and no significant differences were found compared to the standard formula group (56 : 1 : 6. 4 %). In contrast, we did show a significant effect of GOS/FOS on the percentage of lactobacilli (6 : 1 : 2. 6 % at 12 w, p= 0. OO 7) compared to the standard formula group (1 : 1 : 0. 4 %), whereas no significant effect was found for the GOS- and Bb- 12 formula (1 : 1 : 0. 4 % and 2. 4 : 1 : 1. 7 % resp. at 12 w). Infants fed on GOS/FOS formula showed a metabolic activity of the flora comparable to that of breast fed infants. GOS/FOS formula induced a faecal SCFA profile (acetate/propionate/ butyrate/others) comparable to that found in breast fed infants (82 / 14 / 2 / 2 % vs. 90 / 6 / 2 / 2 % at 16 w), while th at of GOS- and Bb- 12 fed infants is more like that in standard formula fed infants (78 / 16 / 3 / 2 and 70 / 22 / 6 / 3 vs. 73 / 20 / 5 / 3 at age 16 w). We also demonstrated that the faecal lactate concentration of the GOS/FOS group was comparable to breast fed infants (40. 9 : 1 : 10. 7 vs. 45. 2 % 9. 0 mmollactate /kg faeces), whereas that of GOS- and Bb- 12 fed infants was more like standard formula fed infants (12. 2 : 1 : 5. 1 and 6. 1 : 1 : 4. 2 vs. 0. 8 : 1 : 0. 7). Also the faecal pH of the GOS/FOS group was highly comparable to that in breast-fed infants (5. 6 : 1 : 0. 2 vs. 5. 7 : 1 : 0. 3), whereas that of GOS- and Bb- 12 fed infants was more comparable to that of standard formula fed infants (pH 6. 5 : 1 : 0. 3 and 6. 6 : 1 : 0. 2 vs. 7. 1 : 1 : 0. 2). Finally we showed that the GOS/FOS formula group showed a marked trend towards higher faecal SigA levels compared to the standard formula group (0. 84 (0. 6 - 1. 8) vs. 0. 39 (0. 1 - 0. 9), median (P 25 -P 75), p= 0. 015 at age 16 w), which could not be demonstrated in the GOS and Bb- 12 infant formula groups. Condusion Although, more research is needed to elucidate the effects of GOS/FOS formula on hard clinical endpoints, based on our findings it can be reasonably assumed that infants fed on GOS/FOS will have a health benefit compared to infants fed on standard infan...|$|R
