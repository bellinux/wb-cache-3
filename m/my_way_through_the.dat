500|$|The {{lyrics of}} [...] "Big Hoops (Bigger the Better)" [...] also concern Furtado's teenage period, with the singer {{describing}} the song's lyrical content as [...] "my swagger-in-spades, rhyme-writing 14-year-old self find liberation through hip hop and R attending 'music jams' in suburban Victoria". There are references to Furtado's favourite {{groups at the}} period [...] such as Salt-n-Pepa, A Tribe Called Quest and Blackstreet, {{many of whom were}} produced by Jerkins himself [...] and her teenage wardrobe. The song's title references the hoop earrings she liked to wear. Furtado said that the song describes [...] "a certain unique swagger you have at that young age and that the music gives you," [...] and that she was [...] "the kid who used to pick up the mic at parties and just rock the crowd, sing <b>my</b> <b>way</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> storm and know my voice could penetrate." [...] The singer stated that as [...] "hip-hop was super-exotic to us in Canada", she felt that [...] "it was very liberating, finding that confidence through the music".|$|E
60|$|Walking {{slowly and}} on tiptoe, I picked <b>my</b> <b>way</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> {{weed-grown}} garden, and {{peered through the}} open doorway.|$|E
60|$|With {{no great}} {{difficulty}} I made <b>my</b> <b>way</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> scrub {{and climbed the}} eminence of tumbled rocks that shut in the view.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{shall see}} Holroyd himself on <b>my</b> <b>way</b> back <b>through</b> <b>the</b> States," [...] said Sir John. [...] "I've ascertained that he, too, wants the railway." ...|$|R
60|$|After I {{had washed}} {{the dishes and}} staked the horses on new grass, I crossed the shallow river and made <b>my</b> <b>way</b> slowly <b>through</b> <b>the</b> cedar-brakes {{up to the top}} of the hill shaped like a pack-saddle.|$|R
60|$|And then I {{awoke to}} reality, and found I {{had been sitting}} in my chair longer than I had intended. The band-stand was empty, the sun had set; I rose and made <b>my</b> <b>way</b> home <b>through</b> <b>the</b> {{scattered}} crowd.|$|R
60|$|When I {{had succeeded}} in making <b>my</b> <b>way</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> tunnel an odd picture {{presented}} itself, and one which will ever remain vivid in my memory.|$|E
6000|$|... "I arrived but an hour ago," [...] Oswald replied, [...] "having made <b>my</b> <b>way</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> Welsh, on foot, {{with that}} tall fellow you saw without." ...|$|E
60|$|As I made <b>my</b> <b>way</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> grounds I saw Audrey in the distance, {{walking with}} the Nugget. I avoided them {{and went on}} into the house.|$|E
60|$|My dear Sir,--Apologies for {{not writing}} are {{frequently}} like apologies for not singing--the apology {{better than the}} song. I have fought <b>my</b> <b>way</b> severely <b>through</b> <b>the</b> savage hospitality of this country, the object of all hosts being to send every guest drunk to bed if they can.|$|R
6000|$|... "He is my comrade and friend, father. He {{escaped from}} prison with me, and {{is devoted to}} me; but for him I should have had no chance {{whatever}} of making <b>my</b> <b>way</b> <b>through</b> all <b>the</b> difficulties of the journey." [...] And he then gave his father an outline of their adventures {{from the time of}} their leaving Kara.|$|R
60|$|Most {{people will}} be easily able to imagine the state of nervous impatience and vague {{expectation}} in which I passed the allotted period of delay, after hearing such words as those Monkton had spoken to me. Before the half hour had quite expired I began to make <b>my</b> <b>way</b> out <b>through</b> <b>the</b> ballroom.|$|R
60|$|Then I {{turned and}} went <b>my</b> <b>way</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> crowded streets, where the people made place for me, the {{astronomer}} of Cleopatra, for my fame had spread abroad.|$|E
6000|$|Reeling, I made <b>my</b> <b>way</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> {{smoke that}} now seemed to fill my lungs, to where I knew {{the door to}} be. Oh, horror! it was closed and secured! ...|$|E
60|$|I {{locked the}} door to guard against all intrusion, and then {{returned}} to my task--returned to my momentous search--slowly tracing <b>my</b> <b>way</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> paper, paragraph by paragraph, column by column.|$|E
60|$|It was a merciful {{relief to}} me when, in groping <b>my</b> <b>way</b> {{forwards}} <b>through</b> <b>the</b> darkness, I struck against {{some portion of}} the furnishing of the church. Fortunately I was all strung up to tension, else I {{should never have been}} able to control instinctively, as I did, the shriek which was rising to my lips.|$|R
6000|$|... "You meant kindly, Hester," [...] he said, [...] "but {{it was a}} mistake. The {{time when}} {{that might have been}} {{possible}} has gone by. Neither she nor I can call back the hand of time. The last two years have made an old man of me. I have no longer my enthusiasm. I am in the whirlpool, and I must fight <b>my</b> <b>way</b> <b>through</b> to <b>the</b> end." ...|$|R
6000|$|... [33] A {{great deal}} of the {{presumption}} and narrowness caused by my having been bred in the Evangelical schools, and which now fill me with shame and distress in re-reading 'Modern Painters,' is, to my present mind, atoned for by the accurate thinking by which I broke <b>my</b> <b>way</b> <b>through</b> to <b>the</b> great truth expressed in this passage, which all my later writings, without exception, have been directed to maintain and illustrate.|$|R
60|$|Once more in Liverpool; and wending <b>my</b> <b>way</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> {{same old}} streets to {{the sign of}} the Golden Anchor; I could {{scarcely}} credit {{the events of the last}} thirty-six hours.|$|E
60|$|I {{left the}} dock and pushed <b>my</b> <b>way</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> crowd. Outside the court-house I {{came face to face}} with Sir Thomas Colford. A sudden impulse moved me to speak to him.|$|E
60|$|At last, at {{the level}} of York Place, we parted with mutual civilities, and I was free to pursue <b>my</b> <b>way,</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> mobs of people {{returning}} from church, to my lodgings in St. James' Square.|$|E
40|$|I owe a {{great deal}} of {{gratitude}} to the persons and institutions that have helped me complete this report, attain a masterâ€™s degree, and prepare me to enter the world as an urban planner. Thank you to: The U. S. Marine Corps for instilling the discipline and fortitude I needed to be successful in college. I must also thank the Department of Veterans Affairs for funding most of <b>my</b> <b>way</b> <b>through</b> with <b>the</b> Montgomery GI Bill...|$|R
60|$|On <b>my</b> <b>way</b> <b>through</b> town to <b>the</b> hotel, I saw {{the house}} which was my home when I was a boy. At present rates, {{the people who}} now occupy it are of no more value than I am; but in my time {{they would have been}} worth not less than five hundred dollars apiece. They are colored folk.|$|R
6000|$|... "Would it help me {{to shake}} off these impressions, I wonder, if I made the effort of writing them down? There would be no danger, in that case, of my forgetting {{anything}} important. And perhaps, after all, {{it may be the}} fear of forgetting something which I ought to remember that keeps this story of Midwinter's weighing as it does on my mind. At any rate, the experiment is worth trying. In my present situation I must be free to think of other things, or I shall never find <b>my</b> <b>way</b> <b>through</b> all <b>the</b> difficulties at Thorpe Ambrose that are still to come.|$|R
6000|$|... "There {{is nothing}} to cause alarm. The enemy have not {{discovered}} who I am; but yet would I hide myself here {{with the hope of}} being able to make <b>my</b> <b>way</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> lines this night." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I pushed <b>my</b> <b>way</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> {{recoiling}} circle, {{and heard}} once more that same oppressed voice saying earnestly: 'Forget that I am a living man, Jorge. Forget me altogether, {{and think of}} what you have to do.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Talking of girls," [...] said Marlowe with enthusiasm. [...] "I've {{just seen}} {{the only one}} in the world that really amounts to anything. It was like this. I was shoving <b>my</b> <b>way</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> mob on the dock, when suddenly...." ...|$|E
60|$|A certain Sunday morning, I remember, {{broke with}} a cloud-flecked sky, {{and as we}} were {{preparing}} to go afield with such ploughs as could be got together (we were to sow turnips) the loud sounds of a quarrel came from the elm at the spring. With one accord {{men and women and}} children flocked thither, and as we ran we heard McGary's voice above the rest. Worming <b>my</b> <b>way,</b> boylike, <b>through</b> <b>the</b> crowd, I came upon McGary and Harrod glaring at each other in the centre of it.|$|R
60|$|Yet I {{was greatly}} {{disturbed}} at the apparition. I {{walked to the}} left along the slope, turning my head about and peering {{this way and that}} among the straight stems of the trees. Why should a man go on all-fours and drink with his lips? Presently I heard an animal wailing again, and taking it to be the puma, I turned about and walked in a direction diametrically opposite to the sound. This led me down to the stream, across which I stepped and pushed <b>my</b> <b>way</b> up <b>through</b> <b>the</b> undergrowth beyond.|$|R
6000|$|... "You must {{excuse me}} if I see <b>my</b> <b>way</b> {{straight}} <b>through</b> to <b>the</b> end. I daresay you would rather realize it gradually, inevitable as it is," [...] added Conolly, looking down with some pity at his drooping figure. [...] "I cannot help my habit of mind. When {{are you going}} to be married?" [...] he continued, to Marmaduke.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ay, lad, you are right, {{and yet we}} must {{contrive}} to outwit them. Instead of openin' the door, I'll make <b>my</b> <b>way</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> {{small window}} at the rear, which can be the better guarded by you and your mother while the shutter is unfastened." ...|$|E
60|$|Happily no such dismal warning {{came to my}} ears, {{and believing}} I was safe from pursuit because of knowing <b>my</b> <b>way</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> gardens hereabout, and having close at hand many a safe hiding place, I asked myself {{for the first time}} what might have been Archie's fate.|$|E
60|$|After pacing {{backwards}} and forwards for some {{little time in}} the sitting-room, and trying vainly to see <b>my</b> <b>way</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> difficulties that now beset us, I {{made up my mind}} to wait no longer for the news that never came. The brothers were still at Browndown. To Browndown I determined to return.|$|E
60|$|Without {{thought of}} the {{possible}} consequence, I darted into {{the shadows of the}} tunnel, feeling <b>my</b> <b>way</b> along <b>through</b> <b>the</b> gloom for some distance. The noises of the amphitheater had grown fainter and fainter until now all was as silent as the tomb about me. Faint light filtered from above through occasional ventilating and lighting tubes, but it was scarce sufficient to enable my human eyes to cope with the darkness, and so I was forced to move with extreme care, feeling <b>my</b> <b>way</b> along step by step with a hand upon the wall beside me.|$|R
60|$|HAIL! Childish slaves {{of social}} rules You had yourselves {{a hand in}} making! How I could shake your faith, ye fools, If but I thought it worth the shaking. I see, and pity you; and then Go, casting off the idle pity, In search of better, braver men, <b>My</b> own <b>way</b> freely <b>through</b> <b>the</b> city.|$|R
60|$|That was a mistake. He {{felt the}} {{difference}} in the touch instantly. Also he smelled the salt in my hand, for a taste of which Unk Wunk will put aside all his laziness and walk a mile, if need be. He tried to grasp the hand, first with his paws, then with his mouth; but I had too much fear of his great cutting teeth to let him succeed. Instead I touched him behind the ears, feeling <b>my</b> <b>way</b> gingerly <b>through</b> <b>the</b> thick tangle of spines, testing them cautiously to see how easily they would pull out.|$|R
