5|$|In December 2016, {{after it}} was {{announced}} that Phase 2 might cost $6 billion, transit experts expressed concern that the Second Avenue Subway might be so excessively costly as to preclude construction of Phases 3 and 4, as well as future expansions. One expert stated that the Phase 1 project was the most expensive subway project in the world, and that compared to other subway systems around the world, the cost of building new subways in New York City was much higher. The Second Avenue Subway's per-mile construction cost is higher than that of other projects in similar cities like London's Crossrail and Paris's Grand Paris Express, which themselves are among the most expensive underground-railway projects in the world. MTA officials stated that the Second Avenue Subway cost as <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>did</b> only because of the complex underground infrastructure in Manhattan, as well as the fact that the New York City Subway runs all the time.|$|E

25|$|The Steuben House, {{presented}} to Steuben {{as a gift}} for his services in the Continental Army, is located at New Bridge Landing in River Edge, New Jersey. The house and surrounding farmland were seized in 1781 from a Loyalist family. The house looks <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>did</b> after Steuben renovated it. The State of New Jersey took possession of the historic mansion and one acre of ground for $9,000 on June 27, 1928. It was opened as a public museum in September 1939.

25|$|In 1983, at a {{time when}} Nong Samet was being terrorized nightly by violent acts of banditry, local {{policing}} was so ineffective that the bandits could brag about their exploits in the marketplace. Finally, after a particularly blatant act of violence, three bandits who had identified themselves in the market the day before were found with their throats cut {{at the edge of the}} camp. Banditry decreased significantly in camp after this. Thou Thon thus demonstrated his willingness to use summary execution as a means of maintaining order. This sent a message to the camp population as <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>did</b> to would-be bandits, that security was a priority and that it would be enforced.|$|E
25|$|When Glass was 19 years old, {{he moved}} with his father to Petersburg. However, when young Glass {{could not find a}} job as a {{newspaper}} reporter in Petersburg, he returned to Lynchburg, and went to work for former Confederate General (and future U.S. Senator) William Mahone's Atlantic, Mississippi and Ohio Railroad (AM), which was in receivership from 1877 to 1880. Glass was a clerk in the auditor's office at the railroad's headquarters. Several years later, under new owners and with headquarters relocated to Roanoke, the railroad became the Norfolk and Western (N). However, by then Glass had found the newspaper job he had initially wanted. His formative years as Virginia struggled to resolve a large pre-War debt (Mahone being a leading figure in the Readjuster Party) and dealing with boom-and-bust economic cycles (some linked with stock speculation), helped mold Glass' conservative fiscal thinking, <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>did</b> many other Virginia's political leaders of his era.|$|E
500|$|The {{results of}} the {{election}} surprised the civil service as <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>did</b> {{the rest of the}} public. Civil servant and future Liberal minister Mitchell Sharp asked C.D. Howe's replacement as Minister of Trade and Commerce, Gordon Churchill, not to come to the Ministry's offices for several days as they were redecorating. Churchill later learned that the staff were moving files out. When Churchill finally came to the Ministry's offices, he was met with what he termed [...] "the coldest reception that I have ever received in my life". The new Minister of Labour, Michael Starr, was ticketed three days in a row for parking in the minister's spot.|$|E

500|$|Further {{praise for}} Colfer's {{performance}} came from Canning and Entertainment Weekly Tim Stack, who {{approved of the}} episode for its depiction of there being no simple solution to the bullying. Amy Reiter of the Los Angeles Times commented that it was testament to the writers and cast that Karofsky's kiss startled the audience as <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>did</b> Kurt, and commended the transitioning of Karofsky from a faceless jock into [...] "a nuanced character with a back story and hidden motives of his own." [...] MTV's Aly Semigran wrote that, should the episode inspire a single teenager to have courage {{in the face of}} discrimination, or re-consider bullying, it would be an impressive accomplishment.|$|E
500|$|World War I did {{not affect}} tram service in Rouen as <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>did</b> elsewhere. After {{a short period of}} {{disruption}} during the great August 1914 mobilisation, the CTR maintained normal service during the four years of war. It overcame its reduced staffing levels with overtime, abolition of leave, and redeployment of depot personnel; nearly all conductors were promoted to motormen, to their great satisfaction. At the end of 1916, women (aged 24 or over in 1916, reduced to 23 or over in 1918) joined men on the trams, but, sexism at that time being the norm, the [...] "wattwomen" [...] (female motormen) were only allowed on the [...] "easy" [...] lines of Mont-Saint-Aignan, Bois-Guillaume and Monumental, and were not allowed on steep gradients.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from television critics. IGN writer Brian Zoromski called [...] "Women's Appreciation" [...] a [...] "fairly solid episode {{worthy of the}} super-sized treatment," [...] and rated it 7.9 out of 10. He highlighted Pam's prank as well as Michael's attempt to break up with Jan via voicemail, calling the latter [...] "easily the funniest moment in the episode, and perfectly played by both Steve Carell and Melora Hardin." [...] Zoromski did however criticize the series for abandoning plot points, such as the publicity fiasco from the previous episode. Give Me My Remote's Kath Skerry called it a [...] "hilarious episode," [...] and observed [...] "I don’t think The Office has ever pushed the envelope in terms of sexual discussion as <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>did</b> tonight." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{real-time}} land {{battles in}} Empire were considered well constructed. Expressing that The Creative Assembly had effectively implemented {{what it had}} learned since Shogun: Total War, GameSpy described the addition of personal firearms and friendly fire as something that [...] "changes the tactical nature of the game <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>did</b> in real life", and noting that the player controls and enemy AI were [...] "competent". IGN felt that the real-time aspects captured [...] "the cinematic brilliance of it all without ever falling back on obvious exaggerations or pretenses" [...] and that the controls, specifically in relation to unit formation, were much improved. GameSpot put the real-time land battles as [...] "enjoyable to command and enjoyable to watch", particularly commending the amount of detail in each model and animation for every soldier, points carried in several other reviews. However, GameSpot thought that the artificial intelligence could appear [...] "confused" [...] in some circumstances, and the Game Informer [...] "second opinion" [...] review said that [...] "the enemy AI falls apart from time to time". In addition, Eurogamer felt that units' pathfinding abilities in fort sieges were insufficient, and Game Informer also criticised pathfinding around obstacles.|$|E
500|$|The {{first time}} Karofsky {{received}} significant notice from critics {{was for the}} second season's sixth episode, [...] "Never Been Kissed". Amy Reiter of the Los Angeles Times commented that it was testament to the writers and cast that Karofsky's kiss startled the audience as <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>did</b> Kurt, and commended the transitioning of Karofsky from a faceless jock into [...] "a nuanced character with a back story and hidden motives of his own." [...] MTV's Aly Semigran wrote that, should the episode inspire a single teenager to have courage {{in the face of}} discrimination, or re-consider bullying, it would be an impressive accomplishment. Linda Holmes of National Public Radio dismissed [...] "Never Been Kissed" [...] as [...] "one of the most facile and emotionally inauthentic episodes the show has ever produced", and felt that Karofsky's swift transition from bullying to kissing Kurt was absurd and [...] "emotionally unsound". His appearances over the next few episodes drew only oblique commentary, such as The Atlantic Kevin Fallon's characterization in his review on [...] "Furt" [...] of the bullying storyline as a [...] "very important arc that's been well-acted by all parties involved". In [...] "The Sue Sylvester Shuffle", The A.V. Club Todd VanDerWerff wrote, [...] "I thought giving Kurt's bully, Karofsky (...), a miniature story arc that resolved itself only partially was a smart move. Up until now, he's been kind of a walking cliché, and now he gets to be someone who's not all repressed sexuality and monstrous tendencies." [...] Reiter commented, [...] "And best of all, we got to watch Karofsky's character develop a bit more. It was nice to see him let loose a little and dance, but all his back-and-forthing about glee was a little confusing." ...|$|E
