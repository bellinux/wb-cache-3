5|$|In {{the history}} of Europe, the <b>Middle</b> <b>Ages</b> or Medieval Period lasted from the 5th to the 15th century.

The <b>Middle</b> <b>Ages</b> is the middle period of the three {{traditional}} divisions of Western history: classical antiquity, the medieval period, and the modern period. The medieval period is itself subdivided into the Early, High, and Late <b>Middle</b> <b>Ages.</b>|$|E

40|$|Studies of age based female mate {{preference}} {{suggested that}} female preference for male age in different taxa {{was found to}} be mixed and various hypotheses have been proposed with conflicting prediction. The present study in D. malerkotliana noticed that females of all ages preferred to mate with a <b>middle</b> <b>aged</b> males more frequently than young or old males. Further <b>middle</b> <b>aged</b> males showed significantly greater courtship acts to courting females. The female showed least rejection behavior and copulated longer with <b>middle</b> <b>aged</b> male than young or old males. Female mated with <b>middle</b> <b>aged</b> male had produced a significantly greater number of progeny but insignificant variation was found in eggs laid by female mated with different male age classes. Female mated with <b>middle</b> <b>aged</b> male lived shorter. Thus our study in D. malerkotliana shows the occurrence of age based female mate preference and female preferred <b>middle</b> <b>aged</b> male to obtain direct fitness benefits...|$|R

40|$|It is {{proposed}} that personality (conceptualized {{in terms of}} motives and psychological resources) changes normatively not only from young adulthood to <b>middle</b> <b>age</b> but also within <b>middle</b> <b>age</b> and that these changes take place in relation to social and biosocial change over the same period. Data from 123 women studied at ages 27, 43, 52, and 61 largely supported hypotheses about change in social roles, status, health, motives, personality characteristics, emotion regulation, and relationships. Noteworthy aspects of the findings were substantial curvilinear change within <b>middle</b> <b>age</b> and associations of work involvement and physical health with personality change during late <b>middle</b> <b>age...</b>|$|R

40|$|This {{study was}} {{performed}} to determine factors that influence blood sugar control in diabetic patients in old and upper <b>middle</b> <b>age.</b> The HbA_ level, Breslow's health practice score and stress score were calculated in 58 old age patients and 55 upper <b>middle</b> <b>age</b> patients, and mean values of these parameters were compared {{in the two groups}} according to sex and lifestyle. The results are summarized as follows: 1. The HbA_ : Measurement of HbA_ revealed that the proportion of patients under well-controlled conditions was significantly larger among males than females, and in the old age group than in the upper <b>middle</b> <b>age</b> group. Upper <b>middle</b> <b>age</b> women had the poorest control. Control was better in patients living with their family than in those living alone in the old age group. In the upper <b>middle</b> <b>age</b> group, males living alone and females living with their family had a better control. 2. The health practice score was higher in females than in males in both groups. 3. The score for stress caused by the patient's family was higher in the upper <b>middle</b> <b>age</b> group than in the old age group. The score was higher in patients with a poorly controlled condition than in those with a well-controlled condition in terms of HbA_ level...|$|R

The churches were not, as in the countryside, only parish churches.
