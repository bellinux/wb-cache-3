They said, [...] "General, you possess godlike skill!" [...] The following day, they threw another party and then withdrew their forces.|$|E

[...] At the age of seven I began to learn, and when twelve began to fight enemies. That was the reason I always refused to wear any war-dress. [...] Only a bit of grass in the hair. [...] That was why I always was successful in battles. The first fight was with the Shoshones. The Shoshones were chasing the Sioux. [...] I, with <b>my</b> <b>younger</b> <b>brother</b> riding double. [...] Two of the Shoshones came for us. [...] We started to meet them. [...] I killed one of them and took his horse.
