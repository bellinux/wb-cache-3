The heir apparent is Charles' son Louis Frederick John Spencer (born 1994). Charles has expressed concerns {{about the future of}} the estate and whether Louis <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>forced</b> <b>to</b> sell it. In 2005 Charles endorsed a furniture collection of replicas from the house, known as the Althorp Living History Collection.|$|E

The reception to the program so exceeded the expectations that it was speculated that Dell <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>forced</b> <b>to</b> hire new staff {{to make up for}} the losses.|$|E
25|$|Some people {{worry that}} gay rights {{conflict}} with individuals' freedom of speech, religious freedoms in the workplace, {{and the ability}} to run churches, charitable organizations and other religious organizations that hold opposing social and cultural views to LGBT rights. There is also concern that religious organizations <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>forced</b> <b>to</b> accept and perform same-sex marriages or risk losing their tax-exempt status.|$|E

25|$|Thus, in an Australian suburb today, a self-taught {{handyman}} might devise and erect {{a backyard}} structure using purchased timber, and practising 'bush carpentry'—a gazebo, a fernery, a children's playhouse for example—while {{at the same}} time, a skilled tradesperson, in a distant run of an outback cattle station, <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>forced</b> <b>to</b> use heavy tree-trunks, saplings, undressed stone and rusty fencing-wire to construct a stock race.|$|E
25|$|Marius' biographer, Plutarch, portrays this {{voluntary}} exile {{as a great}} humiliation for the six-time consul: 'considered obnoxious to {{the nobles}} and to the people alike', he was even forced to abandon his candidature for the censorship of 97. Plutarch also reports that while in the East, Marius attempted to goad Mithridates VI of Pontus into declaring war on Rome, so that the Roman people <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>forced</b> <b>to</b> rely on Marius' military leadership once more.|$|E
25|$|In 1924, a {{financial}} crunch {{meant that the}} station <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>forced</b> <b>to</b> close down. The St. Olaf senior class and local newspaper, The Northfield News, campaigned for donations. Money came in from across Minnesota and several nearby states. This made WCAL the first listener-supported station in the United States. From 1928-circa 1954, WCAL was entirely listener-supported and received no direct financial support from St. Olaf College. In 1949, the station's card file held the names and addresses of over 60,000 donors. The station's AM signal was heard {{as far as the}} western United States, Mexico, Florida, Alaska and Canada.|$|E

25|$|Robert Peston {{reported}} in March 2014 that RBS and Lloyds Banking Group <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>forced</b> <b>to</b> relocate their head offices from Edinburgh to London {{in case of}} Scottish independence, due to a European law brought in after the 1991 collapse of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International.

25|$|Fearing Archbhishop Langton <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>forced</b> <b>to</b> {{surrender}} his castle of Rochester, Fitzwalter, {{with the}} assent of the warden of the castle, Reginald de Cornhill, secretly occupied {{it with a}} large force. John's troops soon approached, and strove, by burning Rochester bridge and occupying the left bank of the way, to cut off Fitzwalter from his London confederates. But Fitzwalter succeeded keeping his position, though before long he was forced on 11 October to retreat to London, allow the royalists to occupy the town besiege the castle. John now tried to deceive him by forged letters. Fitzwalter, conscious of the weakness of his position, sought to negotiate.|$|E
25|$|Esther Stutzman, {{who works}} as a {{receptionist}} in a doctor's office, also experiences a close call with Nazi policies when her friends Richard and Maria Klein, closeted Jews like herself, bring their ailing eight-month-old baby, Paul, in for a checkup. The diagnosis, Tay-Sachs disease, is a disease known to be prevalent among Jews. A subsequent investigation into his family background would spell doom for his parents and any names they <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>forced</b> <b>to</b> reveal under torture. Although Esther's husband, Walther, is able to hack into the Reich's computer network and change the Klein's family history, it is the revelation that Reichsführer-SS Lothar Prützmann has a nephew with Tay-Sachs that brings the investigation to a halt.|$|E

50|$|In exile, Ovid wrote two poetry collections, Tristia and Epistulae ex Ponto, that {{illustrated}} his {{sadness and}} desolation.

25|$|On 26 May, around lunchtime, Reynaud {{attended}} {{a meeting in}} London with Churchill. At 2 pm Churchill reported to the War Cabinet that Reynaud had stated that the French military situation was hopeless, {{that he had no}} intention of signing a separate peace with Germany, but that he <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>forced</b> <b>to</b> resign and that others in the French government might sign such a treaty. At this stage Churchill told Reynaud that he did not rule out talks with Mussolini altogether (Italy was still neutral). The Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax met Reynaud later in the afternoon, before the latter’s return to France. This was the beginning of the British May 1940 War Cabinet Crisis, in which Halifax favoured what was euphemistically described as “the Reynaud Option”: approaching the Italians to see if acceptable peace terms could be negotiated, perhaps by giving up some British territory in the Mediterranean. Halifax was eventually overruled by Churchill.|$|E
25|$|The Battle of Leipzig, {{the largest}} and bloodiest {{encounter}} of the Napoleonic Wars, began on 16 October 1813, raged {{for three days and}} ended with a decisive victory for the Sixth Coalition. Napoleon was forced to abandon central Germany to the coalition and hastily retreated westwards. His strategy was to regroup all his available forces on the shores of the Rhine, where his lines of communication would be shorter and his rear less likely to be threatened. The Emperor's concern was that his already battered army <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>forced</b> <b>to</b> fight against superior forces again, so he ordered that the retreat be carried out at great speed. Had the coalition managed to advance with more vigour in the days following the Battle of Leipzig, the already disorganised French army would probably have been destroyed, but the coalition armies themselves had suffered such high losses at Leipzig that they were in no position to launch an effective pursuit. With military action confined to secondary rearguard actions, Napoleon was able to install his headquarters at Erfurt on 23 October and began to reorganise his forces. On 26 October, he sent orders to the various corps, directing them to Frankfurt via Eisenach and Fulda. Their assigned destination was the city of Mainz, by the Rhine river.|$|E
25|$|On 17 October 1557, Wang Zhi {{arrived at}} Zhoushan Island {{with a large}} trading fleet. There he laid down his terms for surrender: he sought an {{imperial}} pardon, a naval commission, and that ports be open for trade; in return he offered to patrol the coast and persuade the raiders {{to return to the}} islands through force if necessary. Hu Zongxian now faced a dilemma: he could not let Wang Zhi go, but if he accepted Wang Zhi's surrender he <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>forced</b> <b>to</b> execute him, turning appeasement efforts to naught. In December, confident in his prospects and his invulnerability, Wang Zhi made landing at Hangzhou. There he was accorded respectable treatment by the authorities, who feared antagonizing his followers, while they {{figure out what to do}} with him. During this time Hu Zongxian asked Wang Zhi to help manufacture arquebuses for the Ming army, which led to the weapon being widely used in China. Finally in February next year, Wang Zhi was sent to prison, where he was given the luxuries of novelties, books, and healthy foods. Wang Zhi believed this was a temporary arrangement and remained hopeful for a pardon until 22 January 1560, when an imperial edict handed down the death sentence and he was summarily beheaded.|$|E
6000|$|Deronda thought, [...] "I {{shall never}} know {{anything}} decisive {{about these people}} until I ask Cohen pointblank whether he lost a sister named Mirah when she was six years old." [...] The decisive moment did not yet seem {{easy for him to}} face. Still his first sense of repulsion at the commonness of these people was beginning to be tempered with kindlier feeling. However unrefined their airs and speech <b>might</b> <b>be,</b> he <b>was</b> <b>forced</b> <b>to</b> admit some moral refinement in their treatment of the consumptive workman, whose mental distinction impressed them chiefly as a harmless, silent raving.|$|R
50|$|Immediately {{before his}} death Sultán Mahmúd was {{informed}} that Sháh Ismáil Safawi of Persia had sent him a friendly embassy headed by Yádgár Beg Kazil-básh. As the Kazil-báshes {{were known to be}} Shia, the Sultán, who was a staunch Sunni, prayed that he <b>might</b> not <b>be</b> <b>forced</b> <b>to</b> see a Shia’s face during his last days. His prayer was heard. He died before the Persian embassy entered the city.|$|R
50|$|In 1996 the EU {{adopted a}} target of a maximum 2°C rise in global mean temperature, {{compared}} to pre-industrial levels. Since then, European Leaders have reaffirmed this goal several times.

The EU <b>might</b> then <b>be</b> <b>forced</b> <b>to</b> accept a less ambitious target or to change its climate policy paradigm.|$|R
500|$|Baird was {{regarded}} as less combative as Energy Minister {{than he had been}} in Community and Social Services. The energy policies of the Eves government were controversial, but opposition criticism was often directed at the premier rather than at Baird. Eves took a prominent interest in the Energy portfolio, and sometimes relegated Baird to a secondary role in policy announcements. In November 2002, however, he was followed around the province by [...] "Hydrozilla", a man in a giant lizard suit sent by the Ontario New Democratic Party as a stunt to show that deregulating electricity rates would create an 'economic monster' for consumers. In early March 2003, Baird announced that the government <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>forced</b> <b>to</b> implement rolling blackouts as a response to energy shortages. He encouraged conservation in late summer 2003, following a province-wide blackout caused by a generator failure in the United States.|$|E
500|$|In 1227, a synod of Epirote {{bishops in}} Arta {{tried to find}} a compromise, {{acknowledging}} the overall authority of the Patriarch at Nicaea but requesting administrative autonomy, i.e. the right for Theodore to appoint bishops in his domains. [...] They gave the Patriarch three months to reply, and suggested that if he did not heed their proposals, they <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>forced</b> <b>to</b> recognize the supremacy of the Pope instead. Germanus replied by having the patriarchal synod condemn Theodore's assumption of the imperial title. The conflict escalated when Germanus appointed his own candidate to the vacant see of Dyrrhachium. Theodore expelled the bishop, and the Epirote synod instead elected a friend of Chomatianos, Constantine Kabasilas, as the bishop. Germanus now attacked Theodore directly. In response, George Bardanes composed a letter to Germanus, which insisted on Epirote ecclesiastical autonomy and challenged the very legality of Germanus' claims to the patriarchate. The result was a full schism between the Nicaean and Epirote churches that lasted until 1232/3.|$|E
500|$|A {{week after}} Wilson {{presented}} the treaty, Borah declined {{an invitation to}} the White House extended to him and other Senate and House members on the foreign relations committees, alleging there was no chance of common ground, though he wrote to Wilson's private secretary that no insult was intended. In the following months, Borah was a leader of the Irreconcilables. [...] An especial target was Article X of the charter, obligating all members to defend each other's independence. The Irreconcilables argued that this would commit the U.S. to war without its consent; Borah stated that the U.S. <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>forced</b> <b>to</b> send thousands of men if there was conflict in Armenia. Other provisions were examined; Borah proposed that the U.S. representatives in Paris be asked to press the issue of Irish independence, but the Senate took no action. Borah found the provisions of the treaty regarding Germany to be shocking in their vindictiveness, and feared they might snuff out the new Weimar Republic at birth.|$|E

500|$|The main {{theme of}} Minority Report {{is the classic}} {{philosophical}} debate of free will vs. determinism. One of the main questions the film raises is whether the future is set or whether free will can alter the future. As critic C.A. Wolski commented, [...] "At the outset, Minority Report... promises to mine some deep subject matter, to do with: do we possess free will or are we predestined to our fate?" [...] However, {{there is also the}} added question of whether the precogs' visions are correct. As reviewer James Berardinelli asked, [...] "is the Precogs' vision accurate, or has it in some way been tampered with? Perhaps Anderton isn't actually going to kill, but has been set up by a clever and knowledgeable criminal who wants him out of the way." [...] The precog Agatha also states that since Anderton knows his future, he can change it. However, the film also indicates that Anderton's knowledge of the future may actually be the factor that causes Leo Crow's death. Berardinelli describes this as the main paradox regarding free will vs. determinism in the film, [...] "ere's the biggest one of all: Is it possible that the act of accusing someone of a murder could begin a chain of events that leads to the slaying. In Anderton's situation, he runs because he is accused. The only reason he ends up in circumstances where he <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>forced</b> <b>to</b> kill is because he is a hunted man. Take away the accusation, {{and there would be no}} question of him committing a criminal act. The prediction drives the act [...] a self-fulfilling prophecy. You can see the vicious circle, and it's delicious (if a little maddening) to ponder." [...] Film scholar Dean A. Kowalski argues that in this scenario free will still exists, as the perpetrators control their actions, and the precogs' visions are but the facts that resulted from their choices.|$|E
2500|$|Finally, Blackmun {{expressed}} concern for [...] "the severe {{impact of a}} state's restrictions on the adherents of a minority religion." [...] Eating peyote is [...] "an act of worship and communion," [...] a [...] "means for communicating with the Great Spirit." [...] If Oregon is a hostile environment in which to practice the Native American religion, its adherents <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>forced</b> <b>to</b> [...] "migrate to some other and more tolerant region." [...] Blackmun found it inconsistent with First Amendment values to denigrate an [...] "unorthodox" [...] religious practice in this way.|$|E
2500|$|Stirling also explores humanity's {{dependence}} on modern technology {{and to what}} conditions we <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>forced</b> <b>to</b> regress if we were denied our advanced technology. Thomas Wagner, reviewing Dies the Fire, said the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina gave the novel [...] "a degree of gravitas stronger {{than it would have}} had otherwise." [...] Fredric Smoler, writing for American Heritage, notes that [...] "reason still allows men and women the (sadly reduced) power to manipulate their environment", but [...] "it is not obvious how a scientific (or feminist) worldview will survive in a newly feudalized, increasingly religious, and fundamentally agrarian world." ...|$|E
