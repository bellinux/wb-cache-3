40|$|To {{reduce the}} cycle {{time and to}} make account of the rising quality requirements, the laying of tiles in {{prefabrication}} was automated. In {{order to meet the}} existing quality requirements, a special positioning strategy and a <b>laying</b> <b>procedure</b> for tiles was developed at the Fraunhofer IPA and implemented in an automated pilot cell. The positioning strategy based on neural networks enables individual arrangement, taking account the deviation of the individual tiles, to fulfil the prefabrication optical quality criteria. The <b>laying</b> <b>procedure</b> enables the automatic laying of tiles using the optimum laying parameters for each case. Practical tests with the pilot cell demonstrated that the positioning strategy and <b>laying</b> <b>procedure</b> could be implemented...|$|R

Thus, the only terrain {{favourable}} for the Japanese armoured and <b>mechanized</b> units <b>lay</b> in the south, where hills ran westward along the Hunan-Guangxi Railway starting from the Jiangxi Hall(:zh:江西会馆), including Fengshushan(:zh:枫树山), Zhangjiashan(:zh:张家山), and Huxingchao(:zh:虎形巢). By advancing westwards and crossing the Xiang River, the Japanese could directly attack the city from the south.

40|$|In {{selective}} laser sintering (SLS) a laser beam is used to partially melt particles in a layer of powders [1]. With subsequent increments of powder layers {{it is possible to}} create three dimensional structures. This technique can be used in prototyping applications able to produce customized objects of predetermined shape. With SLS it is possible to process powders polymer, ceramics and metal, therefore it appears to be particularly suited to build three dimensional scaffolds made of biocompatible materials. In SLS techniques increasing the energy transferred by laser increases the strength of the structure obtained, but it also produces a volume contraction of the sintered material which reduces the precision of the final object [2]. Since the energy required for sintering depends on the particle size. The use of smaller particles allows the use of smaller sintering energies and therefore the production of complex and more precise structures due to reduced melting. In this paper powders with different particle size distributions of silicon were obtained by mixing a coarser grained powder, with particles in the range between 10 and 100 microns, and a finer grained powder, with particles in the submicron range. The powder composition and the powder <b>laying</b> <b>procedure</b> were studied and optimized in order to obtain specimens with of the desired mechanical properties. The equipment used is a three dimensional laser sintering equipment using a 40 W CO 2 laser beam purposely built. The density and the mechanical resistance of the specimens are studied {{as a function of the}} fines content and of the amount of energy released by the laser beam on the unit surface of the lighted area. A simple model approach is used to estimate the strength of the single sintered contact...|$|R
