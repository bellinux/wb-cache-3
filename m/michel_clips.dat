40|$|A {{randomised}} {{trial was}} conducted to compare the results of neck wound closure using metal (<b>Michel)</b> <b>clips</b> or subcuticular suture. All operations were performed using a standardised technique, which included wound infiltration with 10 ml bupivacaine and adrenaline solution, no strap muscle division {{and the use of}} suction drains. All the collar incisions and wound closures were performed by the same surgeon. At the end of each operation patients were randomised to wound closure by either metal clips (n = 38) or a continuous 3 / 0 prolene subcuticular suture (n = 42). Daily postoperative pain scores and the discomfort caused by clip/suture removal were recorded. The cosmetic appearance of each wound was scored by the patient, the surgeon, and an independent observer using verbal response and linear analogue scales. The two study groups were well matched for age, sex, indication for surgery and operation performed. There were no differences in postoperative pain scores between clips and sutures. Removal of subcuticular sutures was performed more quickly (P < 0. 0001) and caused less pain (P < 0. 0001, visual analogue scale; P = 0. 0042, verbal response scale) than the removal of clips. At the time of discharge, the cosmetic appearance scores generated by the surgeon, patient and independent observer were higher for suture closed wounds than clips. However, by 3 and 6 months follow-up there were no differences in cosmetic appearance between the two methods of closure. Only very short-term cosmetic results are influenced by the type of wound closure in thyroid and parathyroid surgery, but sutures are quicker and less painful to remove than <b>Michel</b> <b>clips...</b>|$|E
40|$|A {{prospective}} study comparing {{two types of}} surgical clip, the Proximate II (Ethicon) staple and the <b>Michel</b> <b>clip,</b> was performed on 30 thyroidectomy (horizontal) and 50 carotid endarterectomy (vertical) incisions with reference to their ease of handling, patient comfort, complication rate, cosmetic result and cost. In each patient half of the wound was approximated with one type of clip and half with the other. The Proximate II staple was more comfortable for the patient in the vertical wounds (P less than 0. 02), easier to remove as judged by the nurse in both horizontal (P less than 0. 001) and vertical (P less than 0. 02) wounds, and by the patient in the horizontal wounds (P less than 0. 02) only. The incidence of inflammation was significantly higher with the <b>Michel</b> <b>clip</b> (P less than 0. 001). In both the horizontal (P less than 0. 05) and the vertical (P less than 0. 001) wounds, when the scar was assessed {{at the time of}} discharge from hospital, the Proximate II staple achieved a significantly better result. However, assessment of the wounds by patient and researcher 6 weeks postoperatively, revealed {{no significant difference between the}} wounds with regard to cosmetic outcome. The Proximate II design, however, costs between seven and ten times more than the <b>Michel</b> <b>clip</b> depending on the size of the dispenser used, and since the late cosmetic result offers no advantage over the latter design, we feel these financial variables deserve consideration...|$|R
