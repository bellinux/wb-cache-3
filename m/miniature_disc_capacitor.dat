Along with {{the style of}} ceramic chip <b>capacitors,</b> ceramic <b>disc</b> <b>capacitors</b> are often used as safety capacitors in electromagnetic interference suppression applications. Besides these, large ceramic power capacitors for high voltage or high frequency transmitter applications are also to be found.|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} Y 2 O 3 {{concentration}} on the dielectric properties of ceramic <b>disc</b> <b>capacitors</b> and multilayer capacitors containing 50 dielectric layers with an approximate thickness of 3 µm were investigated. The relative permittivity and temperature coefficient of capacity of multilayer capacitors at {{low and high}} applied field suggest that two types of microstructures formed, depending on yttrium doping concentration. Yttrium concentrations of 1. 5 - 2. 0 mol% yielded identical relative permittivities over a wide temperature range. The permittivities at Y concentrations of 2. 6 - 3. 0 mol% were also identical, but somewhat higher. The relative permittivity of ceramic <b>disc</b> <b>capacitors</b> of similar composition, determined from hysteresis loop measurements as function of applied field, was compared with field-dependent permittivity measurements on multilayer capacitors. The results indicate that polarization measurements on CDCs are a good indicator for the relative permittivity values of MLCCs. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} the two <b>discs</b> <b>capacitor,</b> for equal and {{different}} radii. The new results obtained allow a complete characterization of capacity coefficients and forces at short distances. An extensive numerical calculation confirms the theoretical results. The study shows {{the existence of}} a hierarchy in the divergent behaviour of the capacitance coefficients and this implies some unusual behaviour of the forces, strictly related to the dimensionality of the nearcontact zone between electrodes...|$|R

2500|$|The early {{style of}} the ceramic <b>disc</b> <b>capacitor</b> could be more cheaply {{produced}} than the common ceramic tube capacitors in the 1950s and 1970s. An American company {{in the midst of}} the Apollo program, launched in 1961, pioneered the stacking of multiple discs to create a monolithic block. This [...] "multi-layer ceramic capacitor" [...] (MLCC) was compact and offered high-capacitance capacitors. The production of these capacitors using the tape casting and ceramic-electrode cofiring processes was a great manufacturing challenge. MLCCs expanded the range of applications to those requiring larger capacitance values in smaller cases. These ceramic chip capacitors were the driving force behind the conversion of electronic devices from through-hole mounting to surface-mount technology in the 1980s. Polarized electrolytic capacitors could be replaced by non-polarized ceramic capacitors, simplifying the mounting.|$|R
40|$|The {{metabolism}} of the {{imaginal discs}} of wild type, miniature, vestigial, and four-jointed varieties of Drosophila was investigated using the Cartesian diver ultramicrorespirometer. Wild type and vestigial wing disc respiration is inhibited by cyanide and azide {{and thus is}} mediated by an iron or copper porphyrin system, presumable cytochrome-cytochrome oxidase. Respiration is also inhibited by certain hydroxynaphthoquinones, believed to inactivate some enzyme between cytochromes b and c. The respiration of the vestigial and <b>miniature</b> wing <b>discs</b> is increased to normal {{by the addition of}} ascorbic acid {{and to a lesser extent}} by p-phenylenediamine and hydroquinone, hence the cytochrome oxidase and cytochrome c systems of vestigial and <b>miniature</b> wing <b>discs</b> are normal and the effects of these genes are on enzymes below cytochrome c in the respiratory chain. The respiratory enzymes of the developing imaginal discs of insects are similar to those of a wide variety of cells from bacteria to mammals. The correlation of these biochemical findings with embryological studies of the discs is discussed...|$|R
25|$|During World War II, the {{development}} of the anti-aircraft proximity fuse required an electronic circuit that could withstand being fired from a gun, and could be produced in quantity. The Centralab Division of Globe Union submitted a proposal which met the requirements: a ceramic plate would be screenprinted with metallic paint for conductors and carbon material for resistors, with ceramic <b>disc</b> <b>capacitors</b> and subminiature vacuum tubes soldered in place. The technique proved viable, and the resulting patent on the process, which was classified by the U.S. Army, was assigned to Globe Union. It was not until 1984 that the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) awarded Mr. Harry W. Rubinstein, the former head of Globe Union's Centralab Division, its coveted Cledo Brunetti Award for early key contributions to {{the development}} of printed components and conductors on a common insulating substrate. As well, Mr. Rubinstein was honored in 1984 by his alma mater, the University of Wisconsin-Madison, for his innovations in the technology of printed electronic circuits and the fabrication of capacitors.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Many {{aquatic organisms}} survive by filter feeding from the {{surrounding}} water and capturing food particles. We developed a laboratory exercise that allows students to measure the effects of filtering by fresh water mussels on water turbidity. Mussels were acquired from Wards Scientific and exposed to a solution of baker’s yeast. Over a period of one to two hours, students measured changes in water clarity using <b>miniature</b> Secchi <b>discs.</b> The exercise {{has been used in}} a freshwater biology class at a state university. This exercise allows students to make hypotheses, gather data, and explore interactions between living organisms and their environment. Many North American species of freshwater mussels are threatened or endangered because of habitat changes and the introduction of exotic mussels. Therefore, students are also able to examine the potential effects of biodiversity loss in aquatic environments. Key words: freshwater mussel, macroinvertebrate, filter feeding, ecolog...|$|R
50|$|To avoid {{stopping}} {{passenger trains}} in tunnel sections, a relaxation {{of the rules}} was in force permitting the clearance of the home signal (protecting entry to a station area) without bringing the train quite or nearly to a stand. The consequence of this was that drivers rarely encountered any home signal at danger, and some were accustomed to fail {{to look out for}} it. Many of the signals were of <b>miniature</b> arm or <b>disc</b> type, and the tunnel signals were oil lamps of inconsistent performance. Bunker-first or tender first running and the smoky tunnel conditions made signal spotting difficult. Out of sequence running and the heavy running of special goods and excursion trains added to the signalmen's load.|$|R
