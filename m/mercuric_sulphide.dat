40|$|Dimensional {{characterisation}} {{of potentially}} toxic elements present in soil is of crucial importance for determining their actual {{impact on the}} environment and understanding the role played by colloidal particles in mobilising pollutants. Recently, a number of measurement determinations have been available for this purpose; nevertheless a single technique is often not exhaustive enough to completely determine particle size distribution and element concentration. The present work concerns the investigation of mercury in soil samples collected from a polluted industrial site. The analytical approach here proposed makes use of sedimentation field flow fractionation (SdFFF) instrumentation coupled off-line to a cold vapour generation electrothermal atomic absorption spectroscopic (CV-ETAAS) technique to achieve the complete Hg characterisation in colloidal soil fractions. In the investigated samples the results demonstrated a predominant presence of Hg in the fraction between 400 and 700 nm. The apparent relation between concentration of Hg and organic matter (O. M.) content in the soil samples seems to be not related to Hg sorbtion to soil O. M. but rather to the presence of colloidal <b>mercuric</b> <b>sulphides</b> particles which size is likely to be controlled by the occurrence of dissolved O. M. This research pointed out how relatively high levels of mercury in the original soil samples can become even more alarming if concentrated in the submicronic fraction...|$|R

Rarely, when yellow cadmium sulfide {{is used to}} [...] "brighten" [...] the red or yellow portion of a tattoo, a photoallergic reaction may occur. The reaction is also common with red ink, which may contain cinnabar (<b>mercuric</b> <b>sulphide).</b> Erythema, pruritus, and even inflamed nodules, verrucose papules, or granulomas may present. The reaction will be confined {{to the site of}} the red/yellow ink. Treatment consists of strict sunlight avoidance, sunscreen, interlesional steroid injections, or in some cases, surgical removal. Unlike the destructive modalities described, Q-switched lasers mobilize the ink and may generate a systemic allergic response. Oral antihistamines and anti-inflammatory steroids have been used to treat allergic reactions to tattoo ink.|$|E

40|$|The {{formation}} of HgS (metacinnabar) from elemental mercury and pure sulphur, in non stoichiometric conditions, {{by means of}} the mechanical energy provided by a ball mill was studied. The effect of milling time in the completeness of the reaction was also studied. The {{formation of}} metacinnabar (HgS black) was observed even at short milling time (15 min), but several drops of un-reacted liquid mercury could be seen at that time. Liquid mercury was not detected for milling time of 90 min. The mechanism of the reaction was observed by SEM. This indicated that the reaction of formation of metacinnabar by mechanical dispersion starts with the diminishing {{of the size of the}} mercury drops; as reaction time increases the sulphur molecules form an interface with the microspheres of Hg and yield the formation of metacinnabar.

40|$|Numerous {{roasting}} vessels fragments can {{be found}} at ancient roasting site areas in the surroundings of Idrija town, which were used for ore roasting in the first 150 years of Hg production in Idrija. The earthen vessels fragments lay just below the surface humus layer and in some parts they stretch more than 1 meter deep; they arecovered with red (cinnabar) or black (metacinnabar) coatings. SEM/EDS analysis of roasting vessels fragments and soil samples from roasting site areas P{enk and Frbejžene trate was performed in order to characterize the solid forms of Hg in applied sampling material. <b>Mercuric</b> <b>sulphide</b> HgS was found to be the main mercury compound present in the samples. Analysis of earthen vessels fragmentsshowed abundant HgS coatings on the surface of ceramics, forming either crust-like aggregates on matrix or isolated grains. Some well-shaped grains with indicated structure and the size of up to 200 μm could also be observed. In soil HgS was present as powder-like concentrations scattered in soil samples, frequently coating silicate and quartz crystals and clay-minerals. Polycristalline, mercury- and sulphur- rich particles comprising silica, clay mineralsand Al-, Fe- and Mg-oxides that were also observed in the samples were interpreted as soil aggregates infiltrated by mercuric and sulphur vapours and by liquid mercury spilled during roasting. These particles suggest a possible presence of mercury-sulphur associations other than HgS...|$|E
40|$|The {{investigation}} has involved a geochemical, petrographic, and spectographic study of quicksilver mineralization. It {{has been found}} that cinnabar can be deposited only from alkaline sulphide ion concentration which is, in turn, partially dependent on the alkalinity of the solution. Such alkaline solutions are capable of dissolving silica, but carbonate and alkaline earth ions cannot exist together in such alkaline solutions. Any carbonatization of quicksilver deposits must thus represent a stage in the period of mineralization distinct from the period of cinnabar deposition. However, silica is often deposited syngenetically with cinnabar and the relationship of cinnabar and silica (unlike that of cinnabar and carbonate) is so intimate that the cinnabar occurs, in some places, as an extremely fine dispersion throughout associated silica. Associated with quicksilver mineralizing solutions are small amounts of a number of heavy metals as iron, chromium, manganese, arsenic, antimony, gold, silver, copper, zinc, nickel, germanium, lead, and cobalt. Of these elements, copper, silver, cobalt, lead, and germanium are always differentially concentrated in the cinnabar and such differential concentrations as have been observed are independent of the geographical and geological location of the deposit and are likewise independent of the type of wall rock in which the deposit occurs. The varying shades of cinnabar coloration cannot be attributed to any spectrographically determinable concentrations of any elements nor to the total amount of impurity which is differentially concentrated in the cinnabar. The cinnabar-bearing solutions gain access into the wall rocks through fractures and intergranular voids and the greater part of all cinnabar ores is the result of such open-space filling. When the openings become filled, however, the solutions are quite capable of replacing the adjacent wall rock. If the wall rock is out of equilibrium with the quicksilver mineralizing solutions, the adjustment of equilibrium and consequent precipitation of <b>mercuric</b> <b>sulphide</b> will be quite rapid. Precipitation of cinnabar is caused primarily by relief of pressure, evaporation of solvent, and wall rock reaction. Except in ammoniacal solutions, a decrease in temperature will not cause precipitation. Dilution of solutions causes the precipitation of metacinnabar and colloidal mercury. Such dilution is probably responsible for the native mercury which is a common, minor component of many quicksilver deposits. Acidification will likewise precipitate metacinnabar, but not cinnabar. The infrequent occurrences of metacinnabar can best be explained by near-surface dilution or acidification of hypogene solutions. Insofar as temperature and alkalinity are concerned, pyrite or both pyrite and marcasite could be formed simultaneously with cinnabar of metacinnabar or both. However, where marcasite occurs with cinnabar alone (as is quite commonly the case), the marcasite has probably been deposited separately form the cinnabar. Since cinnabar (rather than metacinnabar) is deposited only from hot alkaline solutions and since oxidized mercury minerals are very rare, supergene deposition of cinnabar must be a very local and a very uncommon occurrence. Some cinnabar darkens rapidly on exposure to sunlight and it is suggested that this darkening may involve the formation of a surficial layer of colloidal mercury in solid solution in the cinnabar. </p...|$|E
