The runs are split between four morning and four {{afternoon}} runs, with a single round-trip gameday service provided for weekend events at CenturyLink Field and Safeco Field. Train service on the corridor, which includes BNSF freight traffic and Amtrak passenger service, is frequently disrupted and canceled during the autumn and winter seasons because of landslides from unstable slopes above the tracks. During the 2012–2013 winter season, a record-high of 206 passenger trains between Everett and Seattle were canceled, prompting the Washington State Department of Transportation to begin a three-year landslide <b>mitigation</b> <b>project</b> in 2013 that will stabilize slopes above the railroad between Seattle and Everett.|$|E
5|$|Sibu town {{is located}} near the Rajang delta at the {{confluence}} of Rajang and Igan rivers. Peat swamp forests and alluvial plains are particularly prevalent in the Sibu Division. The Sibu town is located on a deep peat soil. This has caused problems in infrastructure development because buildings and roads will slowly sink into the ground after its construction completion. The location of Sibu in lowland peat swamps have subjected it to frequent floods which was about 1 to 3 times per year. Therefore, Sibu Flood <b>Mitigation</b> <b>project</b> was started to relieve the area from the floods. The highest elevation in Sibu is a peak at Bukit Aup Jubilee Park measuring 59 m above sea level.|$|E

40|$|Climate change <b>mitigation</b> <b>projects</b> in {{developing}} countries {{have the potential for}} significant negative impacts on land users. In particular, land users with socially legitimate but informal tenure that is not recorded using a statutory process are at risk of exploitation from the powerful elite. A detailed understanding of de facto property rights is important in protecting the rights of legitimate beneficiaries of climate change <b>mitigation</b> <b>projects,</b> and this is recognized in international declarations. Land administration systems have the potential to assist in formally recognizing and recording both de jure and de facto rights to land and resources. This paper analyses the requirements for land administration in the implementation of climate change mitigation policies through payments for environmental services (PES). The authors review existing approaches to administering land tenure on climate change <b>mitigation</b> <b>projects,</b> and consider how current and innovative approaches to land administration may be applied. This discussion draws on {{a review of the literature}} as well as a review of seven climate change <b>mitigation</b> <b>projects</b> in Africa, Asia and South America.

40|$|Climate <b>mitigation</b> <b>projects</b> {{that involve}} {{smallholder}} farmers may provide solutions for decreasing agriculture’s role in global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Farmer {{involvement in the}} development of agricultural climate change <b>mitigation</b> <b>projects</b> is essential if projects are to be sustainable and to ensure projects do not compromise farmer livelihoods and food security. This paper profiles four ongoing agricultural carbon projects in Ghana with in depth comparative analysis highlighting their differences and similarities. The purpose of this research was to provide a snapshot of the current state of climate <b>mitigation</b> <b>projects</b> in Ghana that are reducing agricultural GHG emissions while also helping smallholder farmers support their livelihoods and adapt to climate change. The projects use a variety of incentive mechanisms to promote on-farm conservation measures, including tree planting and conservation agriculture. The projects aim to provide both short-term and long- term benefits; however, participation requirements pose barriers for some farmers. Institutional arrangements (e. g. contracts, land tenure, farmer organizations) can affect the costs, risks, barriers, and incentives farmers encounter in participating and benefiting from climate <b>mitigation</b> <b>projects.</b> Future research and attention to project design has the potential to clarify the role of carbon markets and certification in agricultural <b>mitigation</b> <b>projects</b> and ensure that benefits are distributed fairly...|$|R

40|$|Sustainability {{assessment}} {{methods have}} been emerging around the world, mostly for national or regional level plans, but very few are related to flood <b>mitigation</b> <b>projects.</b> This article proposes a new innovative decision support framework for sustainability assessment (SA) of flood <b>mitigation</b> <b>projects</b> throughout the project life cycle, focusing on two main aspects: sustained flood <b>mitigation</b> by the <b>project,</b> and enabling of sustainable development of the floodplain. This study has employed {{a review of the}} life cycle of flood <b>mitigation</b> <b>projects,</b> a review of sustainability assessment methodologies, consultations with experts and case studies involving two flood <b>mitigation</b> <b>projects</b> in Australia. Conforming to the project life cycle, the decision support framework is developed incorporating five stages: 1) contextualizing the project with regard to floodplain sustainability, 2) SA during planning and implementation for integrating sustainability issues in the project, 3) SA during a flood event to assess the sustainability performance of the project 4) SA at periodic intervals, and 5) SA at the stage of modification or changing to a new project. The framework has adopted a multi-criteria analysis (MCA) approach using sustainability criteria and indicators to determine the sustainability index for the project. This paper describes the process of selecting indicators, defining the weightages and scores for indicators, and determines a sustainability index for various stages of the project. This framework will enhance decision making for sustainability of flood <b>mitigation</b> <b>projects.</b> Adapting this framework to projects in other development sectors is also envisaged.

The United States Army Corps of Engineers constructed a flood protection project on Aylesworth Creek in the 1970s. In 2000, a stream stabilization project {{was carried out in}} the creek's lower reaches to reduce bank erosion. An abandoned mine drainage <b>mitigation</b> <b>project</b> is located in the watershed of Aylesworth Creek. It consists of two limestone water wheels the revolve in two concrete basins and neutralize the flow of acid mine drainage into Aylesworth Creek Lake. The project became operational in March 1983 and its construction cost was $344,519.10. However, the system eventually entered a state of disrepair and in 2006 it was replaced by an anoxic limestone drain for $191,000.|$|E

40|$|Funding for {{greenhouse}} gas <b>mitigation</b> <b>projects</b> {{in developing countries}} is crucial for addressing the global climate change problem. By examining current climate change-related financial mechanisms and their limitations, this paper indicates that their roles are limited in affecting developing countries' future emissions, and argues for the necessity of stronger private sector engagement in financing <b>mitigation</b> <b>projects.</b> In this regard, the clean development mechanism (CDM), one of the flexibility mechanisms incorporated into the Kyoto Protocol, could offer great potential in helping mobilize foreign direct investment towards climate mitigation, by providing commercial incentives {{for the private sector}} to invest in <b>mitigation</b> <b>projects</b> and internalizing externalities associated with <b>mitigation</b> <b>projects.</b> However, due to additional risks and barriers involved in CDM projects, we believe that appropriate public-private linkage would be necessary in order to bring the CDM into full play. To this end, we suggest that public funds could be used to complement private investment via the CDM, thus enhancing market functions of such an investment. Moreover, in so doing, we {{think that it would be}} necessary to examine a host of factors, such as risk sharing, private sector investment behaviour, types of technologies to be transferred, and co-ordination with the commonly practiced trade and investment rules.

Various sustainability assessment (SA) methods to evaluate the influence of policies, plans or projects towards sustainable development have been emerging in recent years; however, most of them are national or regional policies and programs. Very few research studies have been carried out for sustainability assessment of flood <b>mitigation</b> <b>projects.</b> This paper presents the concept of a proposed sustainability assessment framework for flood <b>mitigation</b> <b>projects</b> and its application to a recently implemented flood levee project in Australia. This research has employed a review of the life cycle of flood <b>mitigation</b> <b>projects,</b> sustainability assessment (SA) methodologies, consultations with experts, and a case study of flood <b>mitigation</b> <b>projects.</b> In line with the project life cycle, the proposed sustainability assessment framework is developed incorporating five stages: a) contextualizing the project, b) SA during planning and implementation, c) SA during flood event, d) SA at periodic intervals, and e) SA at modification phase or changing to a new project. The application of the SA framework to the first two stages of a flood levee project demonstrates how the best suitable alternative levee option can be chosen in the planning stage by determining a sustainability index (SI) of the possible alternatives using a set of sustainability indicators. The study also shows achievement towards sustainability of the finally implemented project can be compared with the originally planned project using the SA framework.
