50|$|The names Treasury tag and India tag {{are first}} found on record in {{a list of}} {{stationery}} items published by Her Majesty's Stationery Office (HMSO) in 1912, and, both being capitalised, probably refer to HM Treasury and the India Office. While the terms are now equivalent, a Treasury tag was originally a lace with a sharp <b>metal</b> <b>tag</b> at one end, which could be threaded through the holes in a stack of documents or cards and inserted into a corresponding tag at the other end, thus forming a loop and binding the documents. The tags in that case were {{in line with the}} string, similar to aglets on a shoelace.|$|E
5000|$|During World War II, the Red Army did not issue <b>metal</b> dog <b>tags</b> to its troops. They {{were issued}} small ebony {{cylinders}} containing {{a slip of}} paper with a soldier's s particulars written on it.

50|$|In 1953, {{the first}} two-piece, {{self-piercing}} plastic ear tag {{was developed and}} patented. This tag, which combined the easy application of <b>metal</b> <b>tags</b> with the visibility and colour options of plastic tags, also limited the transfer of blood-borne diseases between animals during the application process.|$|R
50|$|<b>Metal</b> <b>tags</b> {{usually have}} their {{information}} embossed or engraved onto, or stamped into, their surface(s). The characters created by embossing or engraving {{are made by}} removing some of the tag's surface and are not typically as deep as stamped characters, which are made by stamping the <b>tag</b> with a <b>metal</b> die. Stamped <b>tags</b> are therefore often more durable than engraved tags, though some drag-engraving and laser engraving methods can be as deep, or deeper, than the stamped versions.|$|R
5000|$|Morteau sausage is {{produced}} using only pork from the Franche-Comté, {{because in this}} mountainous region the animals are fattened traditionally. In addition, to be permitted to use the label [...] "Saucisse de Morteau", the sausages must be smoked for at least 48 hours with sawdust from conifer and juniper within the tuyé. It is not cooked, however, as the combustion {{is accompanied by a}} strong current of air. These sausages are guaranteed by the IGP label, which denotes their quality, origin and method of preparation as a regional French specialty. Authentic Morteau has a <b>metal</b> <b>tag</b> as well as a small wooden stick wrapped around the end of the link.|$|E
50|$|Dennis {{comes across}} a wounded Marine, Gary. Giving Dennis a <b>metal</b> <b>tag</b> and later heading on to Building B, Dennis radios {{the number to}} Cindy, and he recollects the earlier battle with the {{humanoid}} mutant on the water tower and how the water had frozen as it reached out. Cindy foreshadows this as a clue. Dennis continues to the Level 1 detonator center and uncovers documents revealing that this plague is really caused by a bacterium dubbed HO213, and grows rapidly on contact with water. He reads on about how further testing revealed a pivotal weakness; all traces of the bacteria strain are wiped out when the master strain is destroyed. Once the detonator is activated, Dennis radios Cindy who immediately informs him of Sonja's recent disappearance, later found dead.|$|E
5000|$|On a {{vertical}} band knife machine usually a narrow width band knife blade is used, {{the most common}} width being 10mm. The length of the band knife blade depends on the supplier of the band knife machine. The dimensions are indicated on a small <b>metal</b> <b>tag</b> pasted or riveted on the machine. The vertical machine band knife blade is most commonly a [...] "double bevel, double edge DBDE" [...] execution to enable cutting while advancing the table and also while retracting the work table, while as the [...] "double bevel, single edge DBSE" [...] execution cuts only in one direction. Productivity is enhanced when the operator cuts both while advancing and also while retracting the work table after adjusting the foam block after each pass for cutting. The DBDE execution blade can have a parallel or twisted 180 degrees welding. The twisted welding execution saves a grinding unit, as both edges pass the same grinding unit after two turns. It has been observed that a narrow width on {{a vertical}} band knife machine gives better dimensional accuracies on the foam block. The wider the vertical machine band knife - more the deflection and size variation {{from one end to}} the other extreme end.|$|E

The importance of accurate impedance measurement in optimal design of tag antenna, especially for the <b>metal</b> <b>tags,</b> is first addressed. Afterwards, {{an overview of the}} existing methods based on the single-ended probe and the balun probe is presented. The proposed method using the differential probe is explained based the well-known two port network model. Experiments for both balanced and unbalanced tag antenna measurement demonstrate the differential probe can provided better agreement with simulated results. 1...|$|R
40|$|Two {{separate}} survival {{tests were}} run in an indoor basin. Herring was <b>tagged</b> applying internal <b>metal</b> <b>tags</b> {{as used in}} the annua 1 tagging experiments on the Norwegian spring-spawners. The mortality caused by tagging was severe {{in the first few}} weeks after release, declining to a normal leve 1 i n about 8 weeks. The survival of tagged herring in the two tests varied substantially, and the coefficient was calculated to be 0. 74 and 0. 91 respectively. The difference is explained by the difficulties in handling herring in captivity...|$|R
5000|$|This was an {{important}} duty and Owney was well-situated for it, as the Albany train station was a key division point on the New York Central railroad system, {{one of the two}} largest railroads in the U.S. at that time. Mail trains from Albany rolled eastward to Boston, south to New York City, and westward to Buffalo, Cleveland, Toledo, Chicago, and points further west. As a contemporary book recounted: [...] "The terrier 'Owney' travels {{from one end of the}} country to the other in the postal cars, tagged through, petted, talked to, looked out for, as a brother, almost. But sometimes, no matter what the attention, he suddenly departs for the south, the east, or the west, and is not seen again for months." [...] In 1893 he was feared dead after having disappeared, but it turned out he was involved in an accident in Canada.As Owney's trips grew longer, the postal clerks at Albany became concerned that the dog be identified, and, if necessary returned to them. They bought a dog collar with a <b>metal</b> <b>tag</b> that read: [...] "Owney, Post Office, Albany, New York". To this collar, the various railway post offices that saw Owney added individual dog tags. The collar and tags made the mixed-breed terrier the unofficial mascot of the U.S. Railway Mail Service, and as shown by the 2011 postage stamp issued in his honor, his identifications became an essential element of his identity.|$|E
40|$|For the {{ultrahigh}} frequency {{radio frequency identification}} (UHF RFID) <b>metal</b> <b>tag,</b> it always has the difficulties of compact designing, especially for the conjugate impedance matching, low antenna gain, and fabrication or environmental detuning. In this paper, a tunable compact UHF RFID <b>metal</b> <b>tag</b> is designed based on CPW open stub feed PIFA antenna. By changing {{the length of the}} open stub, the impedance of the PIFA antenna could be tuned in a large scale for conjugate impedance matching. The open stub makes it easy to tune the resonant frequency to alleviate the fabrication detuning or the environmental detuning, even after the manufacture. Moreover, the CPW structure of the open stub feed can resist the effects of the metallic surface and increase the antenna gain for the compact PIFA antenna. Modeling analysis and simulation are in good agreement with the measurement results. It showed that the UHF RFID <b>metal</b> <b>tag</b> could be designed compact with good performance based on the CPW open stub feed PIFA antenna...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Using {{magnetic}} {{composite material}} as the substrate for RFID <b>metal</b> <b>tag</b> has several advantages over conventional metal tags, such as flexibility and miniaturized size. In this paper, the radiation intensity contributed by a half-wave dipole is derived {{based on the}} result of an ideal Hertzian dipole, which leads to a simple relation for thin substrate. Later on, the material constants of two materials are measured and the one capable of generating greater radiation intensity is used in the course of antenna design. A primitive pattern design demonstrates the <b>metal</b> <b>tag</b> has a satisfactory 2. 7 m reading range, and a dimension of 80 × 22 × 2 mm 3. 1...|$|E

50|$|Ray Wilson and Sue Birnbaum, former Coachella Valley Hiking Club hike leaders {{conceived}} {{the idea for}} the Cactus to Clouds hike in 1991, after marking, with yellow <b>metal</b> <b>tags,</b> the final miles of the faint Skyline Trail as it terminated at Long Valley near the Palm Springs Aerial Tramway Mountain Station. The following year, starting on the North Lykken Trail, they hiked the Skyline Trail and the San Jacinto Peak Trail to the summit of San Jacinto Peak, a 10,300-foot gain. They decided to offer the hike through the Coachella Valley Hiking Club and subsequently led the first Cactus to Clouds Challenge in 1993, along with 4 other club members.|$|R
40|$|Methods for {{estimating}} tag {{loss and}} sightability of tags are presented. Rates of tag loss were estimated for metal and several varieties of plastic cattle ear tags {{in a long-term}} population study of Weddell seals. Tags were lost {{at a higher rate}} in the first year after application than in subsequent years, and pups lost tags at a higher rate than older seals given the same tag types. Medium-sized plastic tags (Dalton, Allflex and Fearing) were retained at higher rates and were overlooked less frequently than <b>metal</b> <b>tags</b> on adult seals. Dalton Jumbo Rototags showed the lowest loss rates on pups in comparison to larger, flexible plastic tags, but were harder to read in the field...|$|R
