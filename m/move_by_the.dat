5|$|On September 16, Montgomery {{organized}} another expedition {{against the}} British fort. In total, he had 1,400 men. He sent a naval component, with 1 schooner, 1 sloop, and 10 bateaux with 350 troops to counter any <b>move</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> British warship, Royal Savage. Montgomery took {{the rest of}} his force and sailed up the river, landing near St. Johns on September 17. The British garrison was 725 men commanded by Major Charles Preston, who just 3 years earlier had been Montgomery's superior officer in the British Army.|$|E

5|$|After taking {{only seven}} wickets at 61.00 {{in the first}} four Tests, Johnson was dropped for the Fifth Test at The Oval; Ring {{replaced}} him as the team's spinner. English skipper Norman Yardley won the toss and elected to bat on a rain-affected pitch, which was regarded as a surprising <b>move</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> majority of the press corps. Precipitation in the previous week caused an extremely wet outfield, which meant that the Test could not start until midday had passed. Former Australian Test batsman Jack Fingleton speculated that the Australians would have bowled if they had won the toss.|$|E

5|$|Depending on {{the success}} of VIII Corps attack, I Corps would then launch two {{supporting}} operations codenamed Aberlour and Ottawa. In the former the 3rd Infantry Division, supported by a Canadian infantry brigade, would attack north of Caen; the latter would be a <b>move</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> 3rd Canadian Infantry Division and the 2nd Canadian Armoured Brigade to take the village and airfield of Carpiquet. Originally planned for 22 June, Epsom was postponed until 26 June, to make up deficiencies in manpower and materiel. The initial opposition was expected to come from the depleted 12th SS Panzer Division Hitlerjugend ("Hitler Youth"), elements of the 21st Panzer Division, and the Panzer Lehr.|$|E
5|$|In Malaysia, {{a similar}} price war caused {{controversy}} regarding {{sales of the}} book. Four of the biggest bookstore chains in Malaysia, MPH Bookstores, Popular Bookstores, Times and Harris, decided to pull Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows off their shelves as a protest against Tesco and Carrefour hypermarkets. The retail price of the book in Malaysia is MYR 109.90, while the hypermarkets Tesco and Carrefour sold the book at MYR 69.90. The <b>move</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> bookstores {{was seen as an}} attempt to pressure the distributor Penguin Books to remove the books from the hypermarkets. However, as of 24 July 2007, the price war has ended, with the four bookstores involved resuming selling the books in their stores with discount. Penguin Books has also confirmed that Tesco and Carrefour are selling the book at a loss, urging them to practice good business sense and fair trade.|$|E
5|$|When Mardonius' raids {{disrupted}} the Allied supply chain, it forced the Allies {{to rethink their}} strategy. Rather than now moving to attack, however, they instead looked to retreat and secure their lines of communication. Despite this defensive <b>move</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Greeks, {{it was in fact}} the chaos resulting from this retreat that finally ended the stalemate. Mardonius perceived this as a full-on retreat, in effect thinking that the battle was already over, and sought to pursue the Greeks. Since he did not expect the Greeks to fight, the tactical problems were no longer an issue and he tried {{to take advantage of the}} altered strategic situation he thought he had produced. Conversely, the Greeks had, inadvertently, lured Mardonius into attacking them on the higher ground and, despite being outnumbered, were thus at a tactical advantage.|$|E

5|$|During the 1966/67 season John {{was again}} chosen to trial for Wales. One {{of the trials}} forced him to miss the second Swansea {{encounter}} of the season, played away on 12 November 1966; {{his place in the}} Llanelli team was given to a youth debutant from the Felinfoel club, Phil Bennett. Bennett became one of the greatest fly-halves produced by Wales, but he was kept from the Wales squad in his early career by the presence of John. In 1966, John was awarded his first international cap for Wales, taking David Watkins place at fly-half for the match against the touring Australia team. This was seen as a surprise <b>move</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Welsh Rugby Union selectors, as Watkins had recently returned from a British Lions tour where he was team captain. Wales lost to Australia 11–4, the first time the Welsh had been beaten by the 'Wallabies', due to poor form in the midfield, with the criticism aimed at John, Gerald Davies and John Dawes. Although experiencing defeat in his first international, John managed to gain revenge over Australia just over a month later when the same team faced Llanelli at Stradey Park. Llanelli beat the Wallabies 11–0 after a bruising forward contest. John himself scored a try, and then added to his tally with a dropped goal.|$|E
5|$|In 1920, Ruth hit 54 {{home runs}} {{for a new}} record; his total was {{higher than that of}} all other MLB teams but the Philadelphia Phillies. New York had 95 wins, the most in team history to that point, but fell three wins short of the AL {{championship}} and finished third. In an August 16 game against the Indians, a pitch from Mays hit Indians shortstop Ray Chapman in the head, leading to his death; the Yankees slumped after the incident as Cleveland captured the pennant. After the season, the Yankees hired general manager Ed Barrow from the Red Sox. Barrow made numerous trades with his former club, including one immediately after his departure that brought catcher Wally Schang and pitcher Waite Hoyt to New York. The Yankees also became involved in another dispute with Ban Johnson, this time over the replacement of baseball's existing governing body, the National Commission, after reports came out that the 1919 World Series had been fixed. The Yankees and 10 other franchises—including the entire NL—supported the idea of a three-man committee drawn from outside baseball running MLB, and for a time a <b>move</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Yankees to the NL was rumored; ultimately, Judge Kenesaw Mountain Landis was named MLB's first commissioner.|$|E
5|$|The {{competition}} from the Terrapins caused Dunn to sustain large losses. Although by late June the Orioles were in first place, having won over two-thirds of their games, the paid attendance dropped as low as 150. Dunn explored a possible <b>move</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Orioles to Richmond, Virginia, {{as well as the}} sale of a minority interest in the club. These possibilities fell through, leaving Dunn with little choice other than to sell his best players to major league teams to raise money. He offered Ruth to the reigning World Series champions, Connie Mack's Philadelphia Athletics, but Mack had his own financial problems. The Cincinnati Reds and New York Giants expressed interest in Ruth, but Dunn sold his contract, along with those of pitchers Ernie Shore and Ben Egan, to the Boston Red Sox of the American League (AL) on July 4. The sale price was announced as $25,000 but other reports lower the amount to half that, or possibly $8,500 plus the cancellation of a $3,000 loan. Ruth remained with the Orioles for several days while the Red Sox completed a road trip, and reported to the team in Boston on July 11.|$|E
