25|$|The {{recently}} discovered inscription for Nefertiti as queen in Regnal Year 16, if verified, {{seems to make}} clear {{she was still alive}} and still queen. What Egyptologists will make of it remains to be seen, but with proof of her alive in Year 16, it could be seen as supporting her candidacy as Neferneferuaten. On the other hand, advocates for Smenkhkare may <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>that</b> since she attested as queen just before the start of Akhenaten's final regnal year, then Smenkhkare {{is more likely to be}} Akhenaten's successor.|$|E

25|$|However, some gay {{men such as}} Andrea Dworkin's husband John Stoltenberg {{are also}} {{critical}} of sadomasochism and pornography and agree with the radical feminist and lesbian feminist criticisms of these practices. Stoltenberg wrote that sadomasochism eroticizes both violence and powerlessness. The gay pro-feminist author Christopher N. Kendall wrote the book Gay Male Pornography: An Issue Of Sex Discrimination, advancing the idea that gay male pornography involved sex discrimination and should be banned under Canada's equality laws. He uses radical feminist theory to <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>that</b> gay male pornography reinforces misogyny and homophobia.|$|E
25|$|On {{the other}} hand, Edward Burns, in his 2000 Arden Shakespeare 3rd series edition of 1 Henry VI, and Ronald Knowles, in his 1999 Arden Shakespeare 3rd series edition of 2 Henry VI, <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>that</b> 2 Henry VI {{probably}} preceded 1 Henry VI. Similarly, Randall Martin, in his 2001 Oxford Shakespeare edition of 3 Henry VI, argues that 1 Henry VI {{was almost certainly}} written last. In his 2003 Oxford edition of 1 Henry VI, Michael Taylor agrees with Martin. Additionally, {{it is worth noting}} that in the Oxford Shakespeare: Complete Works of 1986 and the 2nd edition of 2005, and in the Norton Shakespeare of 1997 and again in 2008, both 2 Henry VI and 3 Henry VI precede 1 Henry VI.|$|E
25|$|John Hales wrote {{a speech}} to give in the House of Commons in 1563; he was a {{partisan}} of the Earl of Hertford, in right of his wife, the former Lady Catherine Grey. It {{was related to the}} efforts of Lord John Grey, Lady Catherine Grey's uncle and guardian, who tried to <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>that</b> she was the royal heir at an early point in Elizabeth's reign, incurring the Queen's wrath. This manuscript brought to bear on the question the old statute De natis ultra mare. It was influential in the following debate, but the interpretation of the statute became important. It also caused a furore, and allegations of a plot. Hales could only be brought to say that he had shown a draft to John Grey, William Fleetwood, the other member of parliament for the same borough, and John Foster, who {{had been one of the}} members for Hindon. Walter Haddon called Hales's arrest and the subsequent row the Tempestas Halesiana. What Hales was doing was quite complex, using legal arguments to rule out Scottish claimants, and also relying on research abroad by Robert Beale to reopen the matter of the Hertford marriage. Francis Newdigate, who had married Anne Seymour, Duchess of Somerset, was involved in the investigation, but was not imprisoned; Hales was. He spent a year in the Fleet Prison and the Tower of London, and for the rest of his life was under house arrest.|$|E

25|$|Workplace {{bullying}} {{is reported}} to be far more prevalent than perhaps commonly thought. For some reason, workplace bullying seems to be particularly widespread in healthcare organizations; 80% of nurses report experiencing workplace bullying. Similar to the school environment for children, the work environment typically places groups of adult peers together in a shared space on a regular basis. In such a situation, social interactions and relationships are of great importance to the function of the organizational structure and in pursuing goals. The emotional consequences of bullying put an organization at risk of losing victimized employees. Bullying also contributes to a negative work environment, is not conducive to necessary cooperation and can lessen productivity at various levels. Bullying in the workplace is associated with negative responses to stress. The ability to manage emotions, especially emotional stress, seems to be a consistently important factor in different types of bullying. The workplace in general can be a stressful environment, so a negative way of coping with stress or an inability to do so can be particularly damning. Workplace bullies may have high social intelligence and low emotional intelligence (EI). In this context, bullies tend to rank high on the social ladder and are adept at influencing others. The combination of high social intelligence and low empathy is conducive to manipulative behaviour, such that Hutchinson (2013) describes workplace bullying to be. In working groups where employees have low EI, workers can be persuaded to engage in unethical behaviour. With the bullies' persuasion, the work group is socialized in a way that rationalizes the behaviour, and makes the group tolerant or supportive of the bullying. Hutchinson & Hurley (2013) <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>that</b> EI and leadership skills are both necessary to bullying intervention in the workplace, and illustrates the relationship between EI, leadership and reductions in bullying. EI and ethical behaviour among other members of the work team have been shown to {{have a significant impact on}} ethical behaviour of nursing teams. Higher EI is linked to improvements in the work environment and is an important moderator between conflict and reactions to conflict in the workplace. The self-awareness and self-management dimensions of EI have both been illustrated to have strong positive correlations with effective leadership and the specific leadership ability to build healthy work environments and work culture.|$|E
500|$|There are {{difficulties}} in {{deciding how to}} allocate the revenues raised. This is a controversial issue among scholars. The revenues {{can be used to}} improve public transport (as is the case in London), or to invest in new road infrastructure (as in Oslo). [...] Some academics <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>that</b> revenues should be disposed as a direct transfer payments to former road users. Congestion pricing is not intended to increase public revenues or to become just another tax, however this is precisely one of the main concerns of road users and taxpayers.|$|E
500|$|Some Constitutional originalists, notably Raoul Berger in his {{influential}} 1977 book [...] "Government by Judiciary," [...] <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>that</b> Brown {{cannot be}} defended {{by reference to}} the original understanding of the 14th Amendment. They support this reading of the 14th amendment by noting that the Civil Rights Act of 1875 did not ban segregated schools and that the same Congress that passed the 14th Amendment also voted to segregate schools in the District of Columbia. Other originalists, including Michael W. McConnell, a federal judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit, in his article [...] "Originalism and the Desegregation Decisions," [...] argue that the Radical Reconstructionists who spearheaded the 14th Amendment {{were in favor of}} desegregated southern schools. Evidence supporting this interpretation of the 14th amendment has come from archived Congressional records showing that proposals for federal legislation which would enforce school integration were debated in Congress a few years following the amendment's ratification.|$|E
40|$|Geological and {{biological}} evolution and epic myth are punctuated by such catastrophic events as massive volcanic eruptions that shake Earth, change the climate, cover a continent with ash, and reset evolution. The term super volcano, popularized by the Discovery Channel, {{does not begin}} to describe the phenomenon, which leaves some evidence in geological, archaeological, and DNA records, but blows most of it away. Civilization, certainly, and humankind, probably, will not survive the next one. Clive Oppenheimer’s Eruptions That Shook <b>the</b> World <b>makes</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>that</b> we should understand these events. It also inadvertently <b>makes</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>that</b> contemporary theories about the ultimate causes of world-class eruptions are as myth-driven as those involving Hades and Poseidon...|$|R

Like Steven Pinker's The Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence Has Declined (2012), which <b>makes</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>that</b> violence has been decreasing in human society over time, Demonic Males <b>makes</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>that</b> human males are genetically predisposed to violence, but that our species also has the intellectual capacity to override this flaw if we recognize {{that it is in}} our survival interest to do so.|$|R
50|$|In the film, Andersen {{argues that}} the {{influence}} of Hollywood overshadows Los Angeles {{and one of the}} reasons the city is frequently abbreviated.

Or one could suppose that after some evil thoughts by Diego Velázquez, promptly rebuked and found blameworthy by the other Spaniards, who furthermore {{were willing to continue}} without Indians in Cuba, the voyage was planned exclusively as one of discovery and conquest, and for that purpose they brought the Veedor, and such a good pilot. One could also believe, with Las Casas, that the project proceeded with both objectives in mind.|$|E

2500|$|Over {{the course}} of the 20th century, the world's per-capita gross {{domestic}} product grew by a factor of five, much more than all earlier centuries combined (including the 19th with its Industrial Revolution).
