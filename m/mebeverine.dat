40|$|BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel {{syndrome}} (IBS) is {{a functional}} disorder affecting {{the quality of}} life of patients. In the Netherlands, <b>mebeverine</b> is currently the only medical treatment registered for IBS, although its efficacy is considered disputable. OBJECTIVE: To assess treatment patterns and associated health care cost in <b>mebeverine</b> users relative to matched controls. METHODS: A matched case-control study was performed using pharmacy data. Cases were <b>mebeverine</b> users as proxy for IBS patients. Controls were non-mebeverine users and matched to cases by age, gender and pharmacy. Prevalence and incidence of <b>mebeverine</b> use, concomitant drug use and hospitalizations were assessed in 3431 cases and 3431 controls. Concomitant drug use and hospitalizations was also assessed in a subgroup of 1222 users of <b>mebeverine</b> and laxatives (proxy for constipation-IBS) and their controls. RESULTS: Twelve per 1000 residents were ever-dispensed <b>mebeverine</b> in 1998. One-third of these <b>mebeverine</b> users used laxatives concomitantly. Concomitant drug use and hospitalizations were increased in <b>mebeverine</b> users. The odds ratio for hospitalizations for gastrointestinal reasons was increased predominantly in <b>mebeverine</b> users with concomitant laxative use (OR: 8. 7; 95 %CI [4. 3 - 17. 3]). Excess yearly costs for all concomitant medications were 94 Euros [95 %CI 79 Euros- 109 Euros] and for hospital admissions 120 Euros [74 Euros- 166 Euros] per <b>mebeverine</b> user. In <b>mebeverine</b> users with concomitant laxative use these costs were 136 Euros and 251 Euros respectively. CONCLUSIONS: In treated IBS patients, concomitant drug use and hospitalizations are increased relative to matched controls. Medical resource use and associated health care costs are particularly increased in <b>mebeverine</b> users using laxatives. The total mean excess cost per patient per year is 482 Euro...|$|E
40|$|We {{evaluated}} the efficacy and tolerability of <b>mebeverine,</b> a musculotropic antispasmodic agent, in {{irritable bowel syndrome}} (IBS) and compared its usual dosages by meta-analysis. Medical databases and all relevant literature were searched from 1965 to June 2009 for any placebo-controlled clinical trials of <b>mebeverine,</b> using search terms such as <b>mebeverine,</b> clinical trials, and IBS. Eight randomized trials met our criteria, including six trials that compared <b>mebeverine</b> with placebo and two that compared <b>mebeverine</b> tablets with capsules. These eight trials included 555 patients randomized to receive either <b>mebeverine</b> or placebo with 352 (63 %) women and 203 (37 %) men in all subtypes of IBS. The pooled relative risk (RR) for clinical improvement of <b>mebeverine</b> was 1. 13 (95 % CI: 0. 59 - 2. 16, P = 0. 7056) and 1. 33 (95 % CI: 0. 92 - 1. 93, P = 0. 129) for relief of abdominal pain. The efficacy of <b>mebeverine</b> 200 mg compared to <b>mebeverine</b> 135 mg indicated RRs of 1. 12 (95 % CI: 0. 96 - 1. 3, P = 0. 168) for clinical or global improvement and 1. 08 (95 % CI: 0. 87 - 1. 34, P = 0. 463) for relief of abdominal pain.

40|$|Objectives: Irritable bowel {{syndrome}} is often treated in primary-care settings, {{and it has}} a relatively large economic impact. Cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) in addition to <b>mebeverine</b> {{has been shown to be}} effective in the short term, compared with treatment with <b>mebeverine</b> alone. This study assesses the impact that CBT in addition to <b>mebeverine</b> has on resource use, and its cost-effectiveness. Methods: Participants were recruited from general practices: those with ongoing symptoms were randomly allocated either to remain just on <b>mebeverine</b> or to receive CBT in addition to <b>mebeverine.</b> Service use and lost employment were measured at baseline and at the 3 -month, 6 -month and 12 -month follow-ups. The net-benefit approach was used for combining the data on therapy costs and symptoms. Results: The mean additional cost of CBT was £ 308. No significant impact of CBT on the use of other services or on lost employment was noted. The cost per clinically important reduction in symptoms was £ 220 by the end of treatment, £ 171 at the 3 -month follow-up, £ 1027 at the 6 -month follow-up and £ 3080 at the 12 -month follow-up, for CBT in addition to <b>mebeverine</b> compared with <b>mebeverine</b> alone.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel {{syndrome}} (IBS) is a prevalent functional gastrointestinal dysmotility disorder. This study {{aimed to}} estimate the burden of illness of a Dutch population of community dwelling patients suffering from IBS. METHODS: Patients identified at community pharmacies, using <b>mebeverine</b> {{as a proxy for}} IBS, were administered a questionnaire regarding (1) the Rome II criteria for IBS, (2) predominant type of stool during complaints, (3) severity of symptoms (abdominal pain and discomfort), (4) generic and disease-specific quality of life, (5) current health status (utilities), and (6) loss of productivity. RESULTS: Three hundred and seventy-five users of <b>mebeverine</b> were identified of which 169 patients met the Rome II criteria for IBS, and were included in the study. More than half (58 %) of the IBS patients reported severe abdominal pain and complaints. Generic and disease-specific quality of life outcomes showed impairment on all dimensions. Current health status in IBS patients, calculated {{on the basis of the}} EQ- 5 D VAS, was perceived on 62 % of full health (95 % CI, 60 - 66 %).

40|$|Abstract Background IBS affects 10 - 22 % of the UK population. Abdominal pain, {{bloating}} {{and altered}} bowel habit affect quality of life, social functioning and time off work. Current GP treatment {{relies on a}} positive diagnosis, reassurance, lifestyle advice and drug therapies, but many suffer ongoing symptoms. A recent Cochrane review highlighted the lack of research evidence for IBS drugs. Neither GPs, nor patients have good evidence to inform prescribing decisions. However, IBS drugs are widely used: In 2005 the NHS costs were nearly £ 10 million for <b>mebeverine</b> and over £ 8 million for fibre-based bulking agents. CBT and self-management can be helpful, but poor availability in the NHS restricts their use. We have developed a web-based CBT self-management programme, Regul 8, based on an existing evidence based self-management manual and in partnership with patients. This could increase access with minimal increased costs. Methods/Design The aim is to undertake a feasibility factorial RCT to assess {{the effectiveness of the}} commonly prescribed medications in UK general practice for IBS: <b>mebeverine</b> (anti-spasmodic) and methylcellulose (bulking-agent) and Regul 8, the CBT based self-management website. 135 patients aged 16 to 60 years with IBS symptoms fulfilling Rome III criteria, recruited via GP practices, will be randomised to 1 of 3 levels of the drug condition: <b>mebeverine,</b> methylcellulose or placebo for 6 weeks and to 1 of 3 levels of the website condition, Regul 8 with a nurse telephone session and email support, Regul 8 with minimal email support, or no website, thus creating 9 groups. Outcomes: Irritable bowel symptom severity scale and IBS-QOL will be measured at baseline, 6 and 12 weeks as the primary outcomes. An intention to treat analysis will be undertaken by ANCOVA for a factorial trial. Discussion This pilot will provide valuable information for a larger trial. Determining the effectiveness of commonly used drug treatments will help patients and doctors make informed treatment decisions regarding drug management of IBS symptoms, enabling better targeting of treatment. A web-based self-management CBT programme for IBS developed in partnership with patients has the potential to benefit large numbers of patients with low cost to the NHS. Assessment of the amount of email or therapist support required for the website will enable economic analysis to be undertaken.

Compatibility was tested by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and FTIR. The interaction between lactose and Mg silicate proved to be of a physical nature. Formulation with this processed excipient on <b>Mebeverine</b> HCl and Losartan Potassium as model drugs indicated its suitability {{to be used as a}} single multifunctional excipient. As a result coprocessed lactose with Mg silicate can be used as a single direct compressible excipient for tablet manufacturing...|$|E
40|$|This study investigates co-processing lactose with {{synthetic}} amorphous {{magnesium silicate}} {{with the aim}} of expanding the use of directly compressible excipients based on native lactose. The co-processing was performed using roller compaction. The co-processed excipient was characterized using particle size analysis and compression properties (Kawakita equation). The co-processed excipient demonstrated plastic behavior upon compression, good flowability and crushing strength and a shorter disintegration time. Compatibility between the different ingredients of the co-processed excipient, as well as, between the co-processed excipient and model drugs was tested using Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) and Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The interaction between lactose and magnesium silicate proved to be of a physical nature. Formulating this co-processed excipient with <b>Mebeverine</b> HCl and Losartan Potassium as model drugs, indicated its suitability as a single multi-functional excipient. Co-processed lactose with magnesium silicate {{could be used as a}} single direct compression excipient for tablet manufacturing.

40|$|The {{method of}} the {{peripheral}} electrogastroenteromyography {{has been used}} for appraisal of the motor function among 85 children (44 girls, 41 boys) aged between 6 and 15 years old with chronic gastroduodenitis at the stage of recrudescence (I group — 45 children), chronic gastroduodenitis without recrudescence (II group — 20 children), peptic ulcer disease at the stage of recrudescence (III group — 10 children) and chronic duodenal obstruction related in most cases to arteriomesen teric compression (iv group — 10 children). Palpable changes in electrogastroentrerography indices were noted only among children with chronic duodenal obstruction and manifested as the increase of electrobiological activity after taking the medication along with the reduction of the indices, which showed the contractive activity itself. Taking of the medications differentially affects the electrogastroentrerography indices: domperidone increases both electro biological activity itself and myo electrical activity, whereas <b>mebeverine</b> decreases them, acting as not only a spasmolysant but also a motility modulator. Key words: electrobiological activity, chronic gastroduo denitis, peptic ulcer disease, children. </strong...|$|E
40|$|Spectroscopic and conductometric {{determination}} of <b>Mebeverine</b> hydrochloride (MVH) with two ion-pairing reagents; Ammonium Reineckate (Amm. Rt) and Chromotrope 2 R (C 2 R) has been described. The molar combining ratio reveals that (1 : 1) (drug: reagent) ion associates are formed by both reagents with MVH. The proposed conductometric procedure has been utilized for the {{determination of}} equilibrium constant of the reaction {{as well as other}} functions such as solubility product of the formed MVH ion associates. In addition, working upon the formerly obtained data operating differential conductivity methods (numerical first and second derivative) and Boltzmann nonlinear fitting was more adequate and systematic for data analysis compared to the conventional method. The described procedures allowed {{the determination of}} MVH within the range of 3 - 15 mg using both reagents. Moreover, the obtained precipitate has been spectroscopically characterized using IR and 1 H-NMR. The proposed conductometric method was applied successively to pharmaceutical formulations containing MVH and the results obtained were favorably compared with those obtained using the official method...|$|E
40|$|Atmospheric {{pressure}} photoionization (APPI) {{is presented}} as a novel means for the combination of micellar electrokinetic chromatography (MEKC) and mass spectrometry (MS). The on-line coupling is achieved using an adapted sheath flow interface installed on an orthogonal APPI source. Acetone or toluene is added as dopant to the sheath liquid to enhance analyte photoionization. It is demonstrated that with APPI signal suppression and interferences by the surfactant sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and nonvolatile buffers can be circumvented. This implies that MEKC conditions can be selected independently from MS detection. Moreover, it is shown that both polar and apolar compounds can be photoionized, thereby also facilitating the analysis of compounds that are not amenable to electrospray ionization. Consequently, the MEKC-APPI-MS system can provide effective separation and detection of compounds of diverse character in one run using background electrolytes containing up to 50 mM SDS. Concentration limits of detection derived from extracted-ion traces (full scan mode) of test compounds were ∼ 1 μg/mL, and the detection sensitivity remained unaffected during 1 day of continuous use. Overall, the system features are very favorable for applications such as drug impurity profiling as is illustrated by the analysis of <b>mebeverine</b> and related compounds (both charged and neutral) at the 0. 25 % (w/w) level...|$|E
40|$|Both fast {{dissolving}} {{and sustained}} release drug delivery systems (DDSs) comprising <b>mebeverine</b> hydrochloride (MB-HCl) embedded in either povidone (PVP) K 60 or Eudragit ® L 100 - 55 nanofibers {{have been prepared}} by electrospinning. The fibers are found to have cylindrical morphologies with smooth surfaces, except at high drug loadings that appear to induce surface roughness (PVP) or fragmentation (Eudragit). There is a general increase in fiber diameter with drug loading. Differential scanning calorimetry and X-ray diffraction demonstrate that the drug exists in an amorphous state in the fibers. Infrared spectroscopy data indicate that the drug has good compatibility with the polymer, whereas nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and high-performance liquid chromatography analyses confirmed that the MB-HCl was not degraded during the spinning process. In vitro dissolution tests of the PVP fiber mats show them to dissolve within 10 s, an improved dissolution profile over the pure drug. The Eudragit fibers show pH-dependent drug release profiles, with only very limited release at pH 2. 0 but sustained release over approximately 8 h at pH 6. 8. The Eudragit nanofibers {{have the potential to}} be developed as oral DDSs for localized drug release in the intestinal tract, whereas the PVP materials may find the application as buccal delivery systems or suppositories...|$|E
40|$|Gel {{formulations}} of <b>mebeverine</b> hydrochloride (MbHCl) containing hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (HPMC), metolose (MTL), and poloxamer 407 (PLX) {{were prepared to}} be used in the treatment of different oral painful conditions. HPMC was used as a mucoadhesive gel base while MTL and PLX were used to prepare sol–gel thermosensitive gels. MTL and PLX formulations showed proper sol–gel transition temperature for intraoral application. Formulations were evaluated in terms of their viscosity, mechanical properties, mucoadhesivity, stability, and in vitro drug release. The formulation prepared with 2 % of HPMC K 100 M provided the highest viscosity at room temperature. However, the viscosity of HPMC–PLX mixture showed a significant increase at body temperature. The greatest mucoadhesion was also noted in HPMC–PLX combinations. Texture profile analysis exhibited the differences of the adhesion, hardness, elasticity, cohesiveness, and compressibility of the formulations. The release profiles of MbHCl were obtained, and non-Fickian release was observed from all the formulations. The formulations were stored at different temperature and relative humidity. No significant changes were observed at the end of the 3  months. HPMC–PLX formulation of MbHCl was chosen for in vivo studies, and it remained longer than dye solution on the rabbit’s intraoral mucosal tissue. It was found worthy of further clinical evaluation...|$|E
