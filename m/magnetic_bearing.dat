25|$|A {{magnetic}} compass points to magnetic north pole, which is approximately 1,000 {{miles from the}} true geographic North Pole. A {{magnetic compass}}'s user can determine true North by finding the magnetic north and then correcting for variation and deviation. Variation {{is defined as the}} angle between the direction of true (geographic) north and the direction of the meridian between the magnetic poles. Variation values for most of the oceans had been calculated and published by 1914. Deviation refers to the response of the compass to local magnetic fields caused by the presence of iron and electric currents; one can partly compensate for these by careful location of the compass and the placement of compensating magnets under the compass itself. Mariners have long known that these measures do not completely cancel deviation; hence, they performed an additional step by measuring the compass bearing of a landmark with a known <b>magnetic</b> <b>bearing.</b> They then pointed their ship to the next compass point and measured again, graphing their results. In this way, correction tables could be created, which would be consulted when compasses were used when traveling in those locations.|$|E
2500|$|The modern {{hand-held}} protractor compass {{always has}} an additional direction-of-travel (DOT) arrow or indicator {{inscribed on the}} baseplate. To check one's progress along a course or azimuth, or {{to ensure that the}} object in view is indeed the destination, a new compass reading may be taken to the target if visible (here, the large mountain). After pointing the DOT arrow on the baseplate at the target, the compass is oriented so that the needle is superimposed over the orienting arrow in the capsule. The resulting bearing indicated is the <b>magnetic</b> <b>bearing</b> to the target. Again, if one is using [...] "true" [...] or map bearings, and the compass does not have preset, pre-adjusted declination, one must additionally add or subtract magnetic declination to convert the <b>magnetic</b> <b>bearing</b> into a true bearing. The exact value of the magnetic declination is place-dependent and varies over time, though declination is frequently given on the map itself or obtainable on-line from various sites. If the hiker has been following the correct path, the compass' corrected (true) indicated bearing should closely correspond to the true bearing previously obtained from the map.|$|E
2500|$|Compass {{navigation}} {{in conjunction}} with a map (terrain association) requires a different method. To take a map bearing or true bearing (a bearing taken in reference to true, not magnetic north) to a destination with a protractor compass, the edge of the compass is placed on the map so that it connects the current location with the desired destination (some sources recommend physically drawing a line). The orienting lines in the base of the compass dial are then rotated to align with actual or true north by aligning them with a marked line of longitude (or the vertical margin of the map), ignoring the compass needle entirely. [...] The resulting true bearing or map bearing may then be read at the degree indicator or direction-of-travel (DOT) line, which may be followed as an azimuth (course) to the destination. If a magnetic north bearing or compass bearing is desired, the compass must be adjusted by the amount of magnetic declination before using the bearing so that both map and compass are in agreement. [...] In the given example, the large mountain in the second photo was selected as the target destination on the map. Some compasses allow the scale to be adjusted to compensate for the local magnetic declination; if adjusted correctly, the compass will give the true bearing instead of the <b>magnetic</b> <b>bearing.</b>|$|E

50|$|Kasarda {{reviews the}} history of active {{magnetic}} bearings in depth. She notes that the first commercial application of active magnetic bearings was in turbomachinery. The active <b>magnetic</b> <b>bearing</b> allowed the elimination of oil reservoirs on compressors for the NOVA Gas Transmission Ltd. (NGTL) gas pipelines in Alberta, Canada. This reduced the fire hazard allowing a substantial reduction in insurance costs. The success of these <b>magnetic</b> <b>bearing</b> installations led NGTL to pioneer {{the research and development}} of a digital <b>magnetic</b> <b>bearing</b> control system as a replacement for the analog control systems supplied by the American company Magnetic Bearings Inc. In 1992, NGTL's <b>magnetic</b> <b>bearing</b> research group formed the company Revolve Technologies Inc. http://www.skfmagneticbearings.com for commercializing the digital <b>magnetic</b> <b>bearing</b> technology. The company was later purchased by SKF of Sweden. The French company S2M, founded in 1976, was the first to commercially market active magnetic bearings.

40|$|Application of <b>magnetic</b> <b>bearings</b> to {{boiler feed}} pumps {{presents}} various attractive features, such as longer bearing life, lower maintenance costs, and improved operability through {{control of the}} rotordynamics. <b>Magnetic</b> <b>bearings</b> were fitted to an eight-stage, 600 hp boiler feed pump, which generates 2600 ft of heat at 680 gpm and 3560 rpm. In addition to the varied and severe operating environment in steady state operation of this pump in a power plant, it is also subjected to transient loads during frequent starts and stops. These loads can now be measured by the in-built instrumentation of the <b>magnetic</b> <b>bearings.</b> Following site installation, a follow-up bearing tune-up was performed, and pump transient response testing was conducted.

40|$|An {{optical disk}} buffer concept can provide gigabit-per-second data rates and terabit {{capacity}} {{through the use}} of arrays of solid state lasers applied to a stack of erasable/reusable optical disks. The RCA optical disk buffer has evoked interest by NASA for space applications. The porous graphite air bearings in the rotary spindle as well as those used in the linear translation of the read/write head would be replaced by <b>magnetic</b> <b>bearings</b> or mechanical (ball or roller) bearings. Based upon past experience, roller or ball bearings for the translation stages are not feasible. Unsatisfactory, although limited experience exists with ball <b>bearing</b> spindles also. <b>Magnetic</b> <b>bearings,</b> however, appear ideally suited for both applications. The use of <b>magnetic</b> <b>bearings</b> is advantageous in the optical disk buffer because of the absence of physical contact between the rotating and stationary members. This frictionless operation leads to extended life and reduced drag. The manufacturing tolerances that are required to fabricate <b>magnetic</b> <b>bearings</b> would also be relaxed from those required for precision ball and gas <b>bearings.</b> Since <b>magnetic</b> <b>bearings</b> require no lubricant, they are inherently compatible with a space (vacuum) environment. <b>Magnetic</b> <b>bearings</b> also allow the dynamics of the rotor/bearing system to be altered {{through the use of}} active control.
