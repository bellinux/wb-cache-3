2500|$|Sea sponge {{aquaculture}} is {{the process}} of farming sea sponges under controlled conditions. It has been conducted in the world's oceans for centuries using a number of aquaculture techniques. There are many factors such as light, salinity, pH, dissolved oxygen and the accumulation of waste products that influence the growth rate of sponges. The benefits of sea sponge aquaculture are realised {{as a result of its}} ease of establishment, minimum infrastructure requirements and the potential to be used as a source of income for populations living in developing countries. [...] Sea sponges are produced on a commercial scale to be used as bath sponges or to extract biologically active compounds which are found in certain sponge species. Techniques such as the rope and <b>mesh</b> <b>bag</b> method are used to culture sponges independently or within an integrated multi-trophic aquaculture system setting. One of the only true sustainable sea sponges cultivated in the world occur in the region of Micronesia, with a number of growing and production methods used to ensure and maintain the continued sustainability of these farmed species.|$|E

In order to restore nutrient content wood ash has been suggested as a fertiliser. Ectomycorrhizal (EM) fungi arc involved in the nutrient uptake of forest trees and this study investigates the influence of intensive harvesting and wood ash fertilisation on the external EM mycelium in forest soil. Nylon <b>mesh</b> <b>bags</b> filled with sand were buried in September 1997 in field plots which had or had not been intensively harvested. The effect of wood ash on the production of external EM mycelium was studied in <b>mesh</b> <b>bags</b> amended with wood ash. <b>Mesh</b> <b>bags</b> were retrieved in May and October 1998. The relative amount of fungal mycelia in the <b>mesh</b> <b>bags</b> was estimated with phospholipid fatty acid analysis. The fungi colonising the <b>mesh</b> <b>bags</b> were mainly (> 90 %) ectomycorrhizal. Fungal biomass in the <b>mesh</b> <b>bags</b> was low in the spring but high in the autumn. No significant effect on EM fungal biomass was observed in the <b>mesh</b> <b>bags</b> collected from intensively harvested plots compared with those from control plots, but wood ash amendment resulted in 2. 4 times more EM fungal biomass (P < 0. 05). The effect of external EM mycelium on the dissolution of wood ash was studied in <b>mesh</b> <b>bags</b> filled with wood ash, using <b>mesh</b> <b>bags</b> buried in soil isolated from roots as EM-free controls. The external EM mycelium had no effect on the dissolution rate of the wood ash. 80 % of the potassium was lost from the wood ash within a month, whereas no phosphorus was lost during the experimental period (up to 13 months).

We measured leaf litter breakdown rate and associated biological parameters in <b>mesh</b> <b>bags</b> in eight headwater streams bordered either with mixed deciduous forest or with beech forest. The variety of leaf litter types in mixed forest results in higher food quality for large-particle invertebrate detritivores ('shredders') than in beech forest, which is dominated by a single leaf species of low quality. Breakdown rate of low quality (oak) leaf litter in coarse <b>mesh</b> <b>bags</b> was lower in beech forest streams than in mixed forest streams, a consequence of lower shredder biomass. In contrast, high quality (alder) leaf litter broke down at similar rates in both stream categories {{as a result of}} similar shredder biomass in coarse <b>mesh</b> <b>bags.</b> Microbial breakdown rate of oak and alder leaves, determined in fine <b>mesh</b> <b>bags,</b> did not differ between the stream categories. We found however aquatic hyphomycete species richness on leaf litter to positively co-vary with riparian plant species richness.

A feeding experiment established a positive relationship between fungal species richness per se and leaf litter consumption rate by an amphipod shredder (Gammarus fossarum).

40|$|A method {{based on}} {{ingrowth}} <b>mesh</b> <b>bags</b> {{was developed to}} study the production of EMM. These bags were made of nylon mesh with a mesh size of 50 mu-m, which allows colonisation by fungal mycelia but excludes the tree roots. Using this method, the production of EMM was estimated in forest stands subjected to whole-tree harvesting (WTH) and in forest stands with different nutrient status regarding potassium and phosphorus. It was concluded that WTH {{does not affect the}} production of EMM. Neither does the forest nutrient status affect the EMM production down to the low nutrient levels studied in this work (3. 55 mg/g K and 1. 16 mg/g P, needle content in spruce stands). The ability of EMM to utilize local mineral sources was also investigated. The EMM colonisation of <b>mesh</b> <b>bags</b> containing apatite-amended sand, creating a local phosphorus source, increased in forest stands with a poor phosphorus status. On the other hand, the EMM colonisation did not increase in biotite amended <b>mesh</b> <b>bags</b> (a potassium source) in forest stands with poor potassium status. This shows that EM fungi {{may play a role in}} ameliorating phosphorus limitation, but will probably not ameliorate potassium limitation. Fertilization with hardened wood ash has been suggested as a means of ameliorating nutrient depletion caused by WTH. The elemental content in EMM growing close to apatite and wood ash was investigated by studying the particle-induced X-ray emission from mycelial samples. The content of calcium increased in the EMM, indicating that the EMM had interacted with the apatite and wood ash. Some elements are taken up by EM fungi and transported to the host roots, but will not be taken up by the host tree and will instead accumulate in the EM roots. Rare-earth elements (REE) are examples of such elements and apatite also contains relatively high amounts of REE. The contents of light REE (La to Gd) were increased by 10 to 100 times in EM roots growing close to apatite-amended <b>mesh</b> <b>bags</b> compared with sand-filled <b>mesh</b> <b>bags.</b> In forest stands with a poor P status 6. 2 mu-g light REE accumulated in EM roots outside apatite-amended <b>mesh</b> <b>bags,</b> while the corresponding figure in forest stands with an adequate P status was 4. 2 mu-g. Apatite is the main source of phosphorus by weathering, and such an increase in the weathering rate could cover a quarter of the calculated P depletion induced by WTH in forests in southern Sweden, given that the amount of EM roots and EMM increase in the mineral soil in the forest...|$|R
40|$|A {{substantial}} portion of the carbon (C) fixed by the trees is allocated belowground to ectomycorrhizal (EM) symbionts, but this fraction usually declines after fertilization. The aim {{of the present study was}} to estimate the effect of optimal fertilization (including all the necessary nutrients) on the growth of EM fungi in young Norway spruce forests over a three year period. In addition, the amount of carbon sequestered by EM mycelia was estimated using a method based on the difference in delta C- 13 between C- 3 and C- 4 plants. Sand-filled ingrowth <b>mesh</b> <b>bags</b> were used to estimate EM growth, and similar bags amended with compost made from maize leaves (a C- 4 plant) were used to estimate C sequestration. Fertilizers had been applied either every year or every second year since 2002 and the estimates of EM growth started in 2007. The application of fertilizer reduced EM growth to between 0 % and 40 % of the growth in the control plots at one site (Ebbegarde), while no significant effect was found at the other three sites studied. The effect of the fertilizer was similar in sand-filled and maize-compost-amended <b>mesh</b> <b>bags,</b> but the total production of EM fungi was 3 - 4 times higher in maize-compost-amended <b>mesh</b> <b>bags.</b> The fertilizer tended to reduce EM growth more when applied every year than when applied every second year. The amount of C sequestered in maize-compost-amended <b>mesh</b> <b>bags</b> collected from unfertilized treatments was estimated to be between 0. 2 and 0. 7 mg C g sand(- 1) at Ebbegarde and between 0. 2 and 0. 5 mg C g sand(- 1) at Grangshammar. This corresponds to between 300 and 1100 kg C per ha, assuming a similar production in the soil as in the <b>mesh</b> <b>bags.</b> Fertilization at the Ebbegarde site reduced carbon sequestration, which confirmed the results based on estimates of fungal growth (ergosterol levels). A correlation was found between fungal biomass and delta C- 13 in <b>mesh</b> <b>bags</b> amended with maize compost. Based on this, it was estimated that a fungal production of 1 mu g ergosterol corresponded to 0. 33 mg of sequestered carbon. In conclusion, the effect of the fertilizer on EM growth seemed to be dependent on the effect of the fertilizer on tree growth. Thus, at Ebbegarde, were tree growth was less stimulated by the fertilizer, EM growth was reduced upon fertilization. At other sites, where tree growth was more stimulated, the fertilizer did not influence EM growth. The large amounts of carbon sequestered during the experiment may be a result of fungal residues remaining in the soil after the death of the hyphae. (C) 2011 Elsevier B. V.
