Harry later wrote an article in The Sunday Times about his experiences in Afghanistan: how they had inspired him to help injured personnel and how, after the trip to the Warrior Games, he had vowed to create the Invictus Games.

40|$|When US President Barack Obama {{publicly}} {{addressed the}} data mining and analysis {{activities of the}} National Security Agency (NSA), he appealed to a familiar sense of the weighing of the countervailing forces of security and privacy. “The people at the NSA don't {{have an interest in}} doing anything other than <b>making</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> where <b>we</b> can prevent a terrorist attack, where we can get information ahead of time, we can carry out that critical task,” he stated. “Others may have different ideas,” he suggested, about the balance between “the information we can get” and the “encroachments on privacy” that might be incurred (Obama 2013). In many ways, conventional calculations of security weigh the probability and likelihood of a future threat on the basis of information gathered on a distribution of events in the past. Obama's sense of a trading-off of security and privacy shares this sense of a calculation of the tolerance for the gathering of data on past events in order to prevent threats in the future. In fact, though, the very NSA programs he is addressing precisely confound the weighing of probable threat, and the conventions of security and privacy that adhere to strict probabilistic reasoning. The contemporary mining and analysis of data for security purposes invites novel forms of inferential reasoning such that even the least probable elements can be incorporated and acted upon. I have elsewhere described these elements of possible associations, links, and threats as “data derivatives” (Amoore 2011) that are decoupled from underlying values and do not meaningfully belong to an identifiable subject. The analysis of data derivatives for security poses significant difficulties for the idea of a data subject with a recognizable body of rights to privacy, to liberty, and to justice...|$|R

5000|$|August {{was by far}} {{the busiest}} month for the Dodd campaign. It started off with the {{candidate}} criticizing the merger of Murdoch-WSJ starting a debate over Media ethics.

[...] On August 7 during a debate before the AFL-CIO in Chicago Dodd touted his experience in fighting for the rights of Labor Unions by stating, [...] "I’m proud to say for 26 years on every major issue that labor’s been involved in I’ve stood with you. I’ve stood with labor in banning outsourcing of jobs, of offset contracts, of situs picketing, on plant closing legislation." [...] He also got into an argument with fellow Senator Barack Obama (D-IL) on Obama's recent comments about escalating the Afghanistan Conflict into Pakistan:DODD:I think it’s highly responsible -- or irresponsible for people who are running for the presidency and seek that office to suggest we may be willing unilaterally to invade a nation here who we’re trying to get to be more cooperative with us in Afghanistan and elsewhere.OBAMA: Well, look, I find it amusing that those who helped to authorize and engineer the biggest foreign policy disaster in our generation are now criticizing me for <b>making</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> are on the right battlefield and not the wrong battlefield in the war against terrorism.

Political commentator Bill O'Reilly slammed Dodd after he appeared on The O'Reilly Factor in August, characterizing him as a kool-aid drinker and blind follower of the far left. O'Reilly chastised Dodd and branded him a traitor for his perceived betrayal of fellow Connecticut Senator Joe Lieberman during the 2006 Senatorial election.On August 20 he attended a debate that aired on ABC and was moderated by George Stephanopoulos. He commented on the need for a president that can bring people from both parties together, [...] "...it's about getting this job done. We don't elect a king or a queen or a dictator in November, we elect a president. The margins are thin. No one political party is going to write all of this.

[...] As the month wound down for the campaign and as Dodd continued on the trail, the month of September loomed in the horizon as did an upcoming debate in Washington on the primary focus of the campaign, the Iraq War. Accompanying Dodd on the trail was the International Association of Fire Fighters, which handed him their endorsement on August 29.|$|E
