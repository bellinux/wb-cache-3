5|$|The {{symbolism}} of the garden, particularly of the carvings, {{as well as the}} repetition of sevens and threes, has inspired many interpretations. The engravings upon which the carvings are based were commonplace in Scotland at the time, and were frequently used in the art of memory, a <b>mnemonic</b> memory technique associated with Freemasonry. The art of memory had become a feature throughout Scottish culture, from the court of Queen Anne, Danish consort of James VI, to the lodges of operative stonemasons. The potential influence of Danish astronomer Tycho Brahe's symbolic garden at Uraniborg, which was visited by James IV of Scotland in 1590, has also been noted.|$|E

5|$|British {{archaeologist}} and anthropologist Katherine Routledge {{undertook a}} 1914–1915 scientific expedition to Rapa Nui {{with her husband}} to catalog the art, customs, and writing of the island. She was able to interview two elderly informants, Kapiera and a leper named Tomenika, who allegedly had some knowledge of rongorongo. The sessions were not very fruitful, as the two often contradicted each other. From them Routledge concluded that rongorongo was an idiosyncratic <b>mnemonic</b> device that did not directly represent language, in other words, proto-writing, and that the meanings of the glyphs were reformulated by each scribe, so that the kohau rongorongo could not be read by someone not trained in that specific text. The texts themselves she believed to be litanies for priest-scribes, kept apart in special houses and strictly tapu, that recorded the island's history and mythology. By the time of later ethnographic accounts, such as Métraux (1940), much of what Routledge recorded in her notes had been forgotten, and the oral history showed a strong external influence from popular published accounts.|$|E
5|$|In the 1950s, Butinov and Knorozov had {{performed}} a {{statistical analysis of}} several rongorongo texts and had concluded that either {{the language of the}} texts was not Polynesian, or that it was written in a condensed telegraphic style, because it contained no glyphs comparable in frequency to Polynesian grammatical particles such as the Rapanui articles te and he or the preposition ki. These findings have since been used to argue that rongorongo is not a writing system at all, but <b>mnemonic</b> proto-writing. However, Butinov and Knorozov had used Barthel's preliminary encoding, which Konstantin Pozdniakov, senior researcher at the Museum of Anthropology and Ethnography of the Russian Academy of Sciences in Saint Petersburg (until 1996), noted was inappropriate for statistical analysis. The problem, as Butinov and Knorozov, and Barthel himself, had admitted, was that in many cases distinct numerical codes had been assigned to ligatures and allographs, as if these were independent glyphs. The result was that while Barthel's numerical transcription of a text enabled a basic discussion of its contents for the first time, it failed to capture its linguistic structure and actually interfered with inter-text comparison.|$|E

5|$|Since a {{proposal}} by Butinov and Knorozov in the 1950s, {{the majority of}} philologists, linguists and cultural historians have taken the line that rongorongo was not true writing but proto-writing, that is, an ideographic- and rebus-based <b>mnemonic</b> device, such as the Dongba script of the Nakhi people, which would in all likelihood {{make it impossible to}} decipher. This skepticism is justified not only by the failure of the numerous attempts at decipherment, but by the extreme rarity of independent writing systems around the world. Of those who have attempted to decipher rongorongo as a true writing system, the vast majority have assumed it was logographic, a few that it was syllabic or mixed. Statistically it appears to have been compatible with neither a pure logography nor a pure syllabary. The topic of the texts is unknown; various investigators have speculated they cover genealogy, navigation, astronomy, or agriculture. Oral history suggests that only a small elite were ever literate, and that the tablets were considered sacred.|$|E

The former {{was the first time}} in history that a book was launched simultaneously as a film and a CD-ROM interactive video game. , Vincenzo Natali still hoped to bring Neuromancer to the screen, after some years in development hell. Count Zero was at one point being developed as The Zen Differential with director Michael Mann attached, and the third novel in the Sprawl trilogy, Mona Lisa Overdrive, has also been optioned and bought. An anime adaptation of Idoru was announced as in development in 2006, and Pattern Recognition was in the process of development by director Peter Weir, although according to Gibson the latter is no longer attached to the project. Announced at International Film Festival Rotterdam in 2015 is an adaptation of Gibson's short story Dogfight by BAFTA award-winning writer and director Simon Pummell. Written by Gibson and Michael Swanwick and first published in Omni in July 1985, the film is being developed by British producer Janine Marmot at Hot Property Films.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to explore the reach of <b>mnemonics</b> {{practices}} and the idea of mental images in illuminated manuscripts, specifically in five illuminated manuscripts of the Psychomachia that are dated between the 9 th and 10 th century.

Many Literature scholars have studied the relationship between <b>mnemonics</b> and virtues and vices, and how mental images of these allegories aided the memory.

It suggests that the illuminations in these five manuscripts were meant as <b>mnemonics</b> devices for the monks, especially those that could not read at all...|$|R

In two experiments groups of trained and non-trained students were asked to memorize two different passages, either using loci <b>mnemonics</b> or not.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this diploma thesis is to examine and present the {{usefulness}} of <b>mnemonics</b> in working with pupils with specific learning difficulties.

The diploma thesis also presents <b>mnemonics</b> {{that can be used}} as one of the approaches in dealing and working with pupils with specific learning difficulties. For this group of pupils, difficulties in the area of memorizing and executive functions are characteristic, which can be compensated with the involvement of <b>mnemonics</b> in learning and teaching. For a better insight into the topic the introductory part presents difficulties of pupils with specific learning difficulties related to specific deficits at the level of auditory-visual and visual-motor processes, as well as their cognitive characteristics with strong areas. Non-verbal specific learning difficulties are mentioned as well. Furthermore, the thesis presents an overview of treatment and support for pupils with specific learning difficulties with an emphasis on considering their learning style. The main part of the thesis highlights areas of learning by using <b>mnemonics.</b> Firstly, processes, which affect improved learning and memorization of information using <b>mnemonics,</b> are presented. Their knowledge and understanding is important for pupils when creating their own methods and techniques for memorizing, which will be faster and better by taking these processes into account. Special attention is given to memory, which is of crucial significance for a successful use of <b>mnemonics.</b> The thesis, therefore, presents <b>mnemonics</b> as methods and techniques of memorizing according to the type of memory, and in terms of adequacy of use in certain groups of pupils with specific learning difficulties.

Bucks County Community College (1999) offers the following examples of <b>mnemonics</b> for students to use to improve their memories. Acronym – a combination of letters used as a hint in remembering with each letter standing for a word. Acrostic – a sentence used as a hint in remembering with the first letter of each word used as a clue to what needs to be remembered. Rhyme-Keys – a list of “peg words ” where each word represents a number and images are developed to link what needs to be remembered to the “peg word. ” Loci Method – a series of locations in a room or locations passed {{on the way to work}} used to remember items in a list. Keyword Method – using an English word to remember a foreign word by seeing the image and linking the foreign word to the English word.
