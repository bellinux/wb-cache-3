5|$|As he {{had when}} he {{directed}} The Wrath of Khan, Meyer attempted to modify the look of Star Trek to fit his vision. Cinematographer Hiro Narita's previous work had been on effects films such as The Rocketeer, where he had time and <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a lavish period fantasy; with The Undiscovered Country, he was constantly under time and budgetary pressures. Though Narita confessed that {{he knew nothing about}} Star Trek, Meyer replied {{that he did not want}} him to have any preconceived notions about the look of the series.|$|E

5|$|The German economy {{suffered}} severe setbacks {{after the}} end of World War I, partly because of reparations payments required under the 1919 Treaty of Versailles. The government printed <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the payments and to repay the country's war debt, but the resulting hyperinflation led to inflated prices for consumer goods, economic chaos and food riots. When the government failed to make the reparations payments in January 1923, French troops occupied German industrial areas along the Ruhr and widespread civil unrest followed.|$|E

In her attempts to understand it, she had her suspicions confirmed by a psychiatrist who offered to cure her. Not having enough <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> regular visits, {{she was unable to}} get the money from her father, who reasoned there were no problems a psychiatrist could solve that a priest could not. A close friend suggested they see less of each other so as not to further encourage the rumors about them.|$|E
5|$|Born in Toronto {{with the}} surname Nudelman, Newman {{was the son}} of a Russian-Jewish {{immigrant}} father who ran a shoe shop. After studying at Ogden Public School, which he left at the age of thirteen, he later enrolled in the Central Technical School, studying art and design subjects. He initially attempted to follow a career as a stills photographer and an artist, specialising in drawing film posters. However, he found it so difficult to earn enough <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a living from this profession that instead, he switched to working in the film industry itself. In 1938, he travelled to Hollywood, where he was offered a role with the Walt Disney Company on the strength of his graphic design work. However, he was unable to take the job due to a failure to secure a work permit. Returning to his native country, in 1941, he gained a job as a film editor at the National Film Board of Canada. He was eventually to work on over 350 films while an editor for the NFB.|$|E

25|$|Foxe had {{dedicated}} Acts and Monuments to the queen, and on 22 May 1563, he {{was appointed}} prebend of Shipton in Salisbury Cathedral, in recognition of his championship of the English church. Foxe never visited the cathedral or performed any duties associated with the position except to appoint a vicar, William Masters, a highly educated fellow Protestant and former Marian exile. Foxe's inaction as a canon of the cathedral led him to him being declared contumacious, and {{he was charged with}} failing to give a tithe for repairs to the cathedral. Perhaps his poverty made him unwilling to spare the time or <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> visits or contributions. In any case, he retained the position until his death.|$|E
25|$|At {{the start}} of the Civil War in 1861, Hooker {{requested}} a commission, but his first application was rejected, possibly because of the lingering resentment harbored by Winfield Scott, general-in-chief of the Army.

After he witnessed the Union Army defeat at the First Battle of Bull Run, he wrote a letter to President Abraham Lincoln that complained of military mismanagement, promoted his own qualifications, and again requested a commission. He was appointed, in August 1861, as brigadier general of volunteers to rank from May 17.

25|$|By {{the early}} 20th century the Du Pont Company {{had become one}} of world’s major corporations, {{bringing}} enormous wealth to its owners and providing employment and other opportunities to their native state. One of the three key owners of the company was T. Coleman du Pont, a capable, energetic and ambitious man, who was also Buck’s father-in-law. Du Pont had a vision of a super highway running the length of Delaware, and the ambition, talent, and <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> it a reality. Construction began in 1917 and in that same year a new State Highway Department was established to oversee the work. Nevertheless, du Pont continued to pay the bills, amounting to $4 million by 1924. With his engineering education and family connections, Buck was assigned to work on the project, becoming Chief Engineer in 1921 and remaining in the role until 1929.|$|E
25|$|Critics {{claim that}} the new 421-a program will cost city taxpayers {{even more than the}} old plan. The IBO found that the new 421-a plan would cost add $120 million per year, or $1.2 billion over ten years, to the overall cost of the program. This is {{compared}} to the old program that would have cost $7.2 billion over ten years. The Association for Neighborhood Housing and Development, an interest group that advocated for non-profits and affordable housing groups, claimed that the city needed that extra <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> up for expected cuts in federal funding to the city over the next year, and that luxury development companies should have to pay full taxes on the property, not get a deduction. Meanwhile, Democratic State Senator Gustavo Rivera claimed that the rents would not be low enough for residents in his Bronx state senate district {{to take advantage of the}} program. Senator Brad Hoylman stated that the dollars devoted to the 421-a program should instead go directly to creating affordable housing.|$|E
25|$|Romney {{generally}} opposes federal {{financial aid}} {{for college and}} other post-secondary education. While campaigning for the presidency in 2012, he argued that students should not expect government handouts to fund their education. In response to {{a high school senior}} who had asked what kind of college tuition assistance Romney would seek to provide as president, Romney replied, “I know that it would be popular for me {{to stand up and say}} I’m going to give you government <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> sure you pay for your college. But I’m not going to promise that. What I’m going to tell you is shop around, get a good price.... Don’t take on too much debt, and don’t expect the government to forgive the debt that you take on. Recognize that you’re going to have to pay it back.” He similarly told a law student who had asked what kind of federal assistance might be available in a Romney presidency for graduate students struggling to repay education loans: “I wish I could tell you that there’s a place to find really cheap money or free money and we could pay for everyone’s education. That’s just not going to happen.” He encouraged young people to be entrepreneurially-minded and to take risks, even to consider borrowing money from their parents if necessary to further their careers.|$|E

25|$|In 1818, {{fed up with}} {{sporadic}} and unreliable deliveries by the Lehigh Coal Mining Company, several Philadelphia foundry owners (led by two {{known for}} high tech thinking) combined and leased the mining rights and took over management of LCMC. Within months they'd also formed the Lehigh Navigation Company' (LCN) to build Navigations up the Lehigh {{to a place where}} barges, not just cargo boats could be loaded with greater coal productionand more importantly, the several rapids which swallowed many a coal boat in the prior decade could be tamed. This early 1818 plan would put coal within 12 miles of a reliable water transport route to Philadelphia, and the Lehigh Navigation Company (LCN)'s had no trouble recruiting workers nor raising <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the lower Lehigh Canalup to the southern mouth of the Lehigh Gorge. The project would also inspire other canal works such as the Erie and Morris, Pennsylvania, and Delaware & Hudson canals. By 1820 the dams and locks of all the downstream navigations were in place up to the confluence of the river and Nesquehoning Creek near the mouth of the Gorge at the flats below Mount Pisgah between Mauch Chunk and Nesquehoninga great bending flat bottomed former lake bed between steep sided valley walls. Hence LC had tamed the lower river and a mule road was operating reliably enough to deliver coal in a timely manner from Summit Hill and new mines being dug at what are now Lansford and Coaldale.|$|E
25|$|Beginning in 1949, the District of Columbia {{began making}} housing {{inspections}} in Marshall Heights, looking for code violations. Inspectors found that 9 out of 10 homes failed {{at least one}} health, housing, or building safety regulation, and they concluded that 8 out of every 10 homes in the neighborhood should be razed or renovated down to the framing studs. In May 1950, city inspectors estimated that 150 of the neighborhood's 500 homes were so unsafe {{that they should be}} razed. Yet, by the end of 1952, the city had condemned just 65 homes. A second inspection wave began in 1957. But by year's end, only 39 homes had been condemned and razed. A total of 348 homes had been cited for housing and building violations by the end of 1958, but city inspectors revealed that just 78 had been repaired and brought up to code. When questioned by the media as to why more homes had not been condemned, the city said condemnations would simply make extremely poor residents homeless, driving them into other slums and worsening the overcrowding there. The inspection program was to have ended in 1959, but the city kept it going because so few Marshall Heights residents had the <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> repairs or improvements to their homes. (Of the 348 homes found to be in violation, 81 homes had seen no repair.) With condemnation not an option, the city decided to keep inspecting homes and putting pressure on residents. By 1960, this third wave of inspections found that 302 of 347 inspected homes were in violation of either housing or building codes. Another six homes were condemned after 1957, bringing the total to just 45, so in 1961 city officials sought to condemn another 25 homes. By now, inspections had cited a total of 661 housing units (apartments and homes), even though the housing stock was relatively new (the average age of a home in Marshall Heights that year was 17 years). Inspections were so frequent, and residents so fearful of them, that some homeowners were refusing to admit city inspectors.|$|E
