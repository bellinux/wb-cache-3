40|$|<b>Mixed</b> <b>flows</b> {{characterized}} by a simultaneous occurrence of free surface and pressurized flows are often encountered in hydraulic engineering. Numerous researches have been dedicated to unify the mathematical description of both flows. Herein, shock-capturing models succeed in giving {{a unique set of}} equations. However, no method accounts for both air-entrapment and air-entrainment. This study proposes an original model to simulate air–water interactions in <b>mixed</b> <b>flows.</b> The new approach relies on the area-integration of a three-phase model over two layers. The applicability of this free surface model is extended to pressurized flows by a modified pressure term accounting for the dispersed air. The derived modelling system WOLF IMPack is then validated.

40|$|Convective mixing in {{the fluid}} outer core can induce rapid {{transient}} decrease of the geomagnetic dipole. Here we determine rates of dipole moment decrease {{as a function}} of magnetic Reynolds number following convective instability in a numerical dynamo and in axisymmetric kinematic flows. Our calculations show that <b>mixing</b> <b>flows</b> induce reversed magnetic flux on the core-mantle boundary through expulsion of mostly poloidal magnetic field by convective upwellings. The dipole field collapse is accelerated by enhanced radial diffusion and meridional advection of magnetic flux below the core-mantle boundary. Magnetic energy cascades from the dipole to smaller scales during mixing, producing a filamentary magnetic field structure on the core-mantle boundary. We find that the maximum rate of dipole moment decrease on century time scales is weakly sensitive to the <b>mixing</b> <b>flow</b> pattern but varies with the velocity of the flow approximately as cRm^β, with Rm the magnetic Reynolds number and (c, β) ≈ (0. 2 ± 0. 07, 0. 78 ± 0. 05). According to our calculations, a <b>mixing</b> <b>flow</b> in the outer core with Rm in the range of 200 – 300 can account for the historically-measured rate of decrease of the geomagnetic dipole moment, although it is unlikely that a single <b>mixing</b> <b>flow</b> event with this intensity would cause a full dipole collapse or polarity reversal. ...|$|R
