I wrote some words and music in my bedroom {{as a way of}} staying sane, about a bleak and desperate place I was in, totally isolated and alone.

Martin told Rolling Stone magazine that lyrics from the song about [...] "a carnival of idiots on show" [...] and how a [...] "fox became God" [...] were a commentary on Fox News. [...] "One day I was watching Bill O'Reilly, and I was like, 'I know how to finish that song. My best friend, Tim... was having trouble with his boss, and it <b>made</b> <b>me</b> <b>think</b> {{that so many people}} spend their lives being told what to do by people that they just don't like.

500|$|The Kurt–Blaine storyline was {{met with}} general acclaim from critics. In her review for the episode, Katie Morgan of Billboard reacted {{positively}} to the interaction between Kurt and Blaine. She wrote, [...] "It sure took them long enough, but we're so glad to finally see Kurt happy." [...] In his review, Mark Perigard opined, [...] "It was utterly, sweetly romantic, and Criss sold {{the hell out of}} the moment. It’s long overdue and it will silence the growing legion of critics out there who were unhappy with the pace of this story and why Kurt always seemed to be stuck in pure misery." [...] Robert Canning was more critical on the storyline. He highly criticized Darren Criss' performance as Blaine. In a detailed review regarding the storyline, Canning wrote, [...] "Kurt finally got the first kiss he deserved. Too bad it came from the wooden, glass-eyed Blaine. Chris Colfer has been in the running for performance awards for good reason. Darren Criss will not be. Colfer and his character deserve better than the cardboard, unemotional declaration of love that Criss delivered. Yay for Kurt and his first boyfriend, but that was a bland work up to their kiss." [...] Sandra Gonzalez called the whole development [...] "simply perfect". Kevin Fallon of The Atlantic thought the kiss was [...] "sweet", and stated that he was pleased that it attracted no controversy whatsoever. James Poniewozik reacted positively to the storyline. In his review, Poniewozik wrote, [...] "As for the at-long-last kiss, it's to Glees credit that it <b>made</b> <b>me</b> <b>think,</b> ‘Finally, Blaine and Kurt are locking lips already!’ before it <b>made</b> <b>me</b> <b>think,</b> ‘Look, an honest-to-God gay kiss, between two men, on my primetime TV show!’" [...] Aly Semigran of MTV praised the interaction between Kurt and Blaine, saying that the kiss scene was a [...] "sweet, real and, shockingly, un-hyped moment". Semigran went on to praise the acting in the scene, saying that both actors [...] "handled it with dignity and honesty". Brett Berk deemed the interaction to be [...] "appropriately fervid".|$|E

Later it was revealed that the song had made Rowland’s vocals swell. During {{an interview}} for The Belfast Telegraph, Rowland spoke of the songs she had recorded for her third studio album. When speaking of [...] "Rose Colored Glasses", she said that it had taken its toll on her, “It brought back a few memories, and when I recorded it I cried so much my vocal chords got swollen."

Their anatomy was half-human, half-animal, and they were confined in a low-ceilinged, windowless and oddly proportioned space. They could bite, probe, and suck, and they had very long eel-like necks, but their functioning in other respects was mysterious. Ears and mouths they had, but two at least of them were sightless." [...] Writing for Apollo magazine, Herbert Furst recalled, [...] "I, I must confess, was so shocked and disturbed by the Surrealism of Francis Bacon that I was glad to escape from this exhibition.

500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Ain't No Other Man" [...] {{was directed by}} Bryan Barber and choreographed by Jeri Slaugher. After seeing a trailer of Barber's film project, Idlewild, Aguilera {{wanted to make a}} video directed by him, explained: [...] "It intrigued me that this man, Bryan Barber, had been very locked into and had surrounded himself with this whole world of the '20s and '30s era, and it <b>made</b> <b>me</b> <b>think</b> that he could understand what I'm trying to do conceptually. I needed to get the right director who shared my vision". At first Aguilera planned to make a black-and-white video and shot it in her living room for Barber and Slaugher. [...] "I had acted out the entire video in my living room. I used my fireplace as a makeshift stage and the staircase as the pool table where I would stand", said Aguilera. According to Barber, Aguilera was very involved in the making of the videot. The whole team seemed like they were doing a movie more than a music video. On June 21, 2006, the music video for [...] "Ain't No Other Man" [...] was premiered on MTV's Total Request Live.|$|E

[...] Eric Goldman of IGN gave this episode a score of 8.5 out of 10, calling it [...] "a nice break from the Volkoff drama". Melody Simpson of Buzz Focus wrote, [...] "This story line has the potential to bring lots of drama but the way that it has been building up to this moment." [...] Stephen Lackey of Mania called the episode [...] "fun stuff just lacking in drama where drama was required." [...] Brittany Frederick of Starpulse wrote that the episode reminded her [...] "of all the reasons I fell in love with this show a year ago. It's fun, and funny without being campy, but more importantly, it's got heart. It's an episode that <b>made</b> <b>me</b> <b>think,</b> 'This is why people fight for this show season after season.' If it helps turn out more episodes like these, Gary Cole can drop by anytime he likes. I, for one, will be glad to see him." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{band has}} stated that the album's tenth track, [...] "Wretches and Kings", pays homage to the hip-hop group Public Enemy.

It's probably the most hip-hop song on the record {{and one of the}} most aggressive...Public Enemy were very three-dimensional with their records because although they seemed political, there was a whole lot of other stuff going on in there too. It <b>made</b> <b>me</b> <b>think</b> how three-dimensional I wanted our record to be without imitating them of course, and show where we were at creatively." [...] Ian Winwood of Kerrang! noted that [...] "Wretches and Kings" [...] references the Public Enemy song [...] "Fight the Power" [...] and compared the album's content to Public Enemy's third studio album, Fear of a Black Planet. Chuck D later provided vocals on a remix by HavocNdeeD. The fifth track [...] "When They Come for Me" [...] references , the seventh studio album by hip hop artist Jay-Z, with whom the band collaborated on the 2004 EP Collision Course. The album includes samples of notable speeches by American political figures, including Martin Luther King, Jr., J. Robert Oppenheimer, and Mario Savio.|$|E
