5|$|With {{the villages}} co-ordinates at N 50.60223 W 1.29967, its climate is warm, with a sea breeze {{coming in from}} the coast. It {{benefits}} from Ventnor's <b>micro-climate</b> as a result of being in a sheltered location on the cliff of the island's south coast. This offers the village more sunny days than much of the British Isles, and fewer frosts.|$|E
5|$|The three coves to {{the east}} of Helvellyn are all {{important}} sites for remnant populations of arctic-alpine plants. Species such as downy willow (Salix lapponum), mountain avens (Dryas octopetala), alpine mouse-ear (Cerastium alpinum), alpine meadowgrass (Poa alpina) and others have been able to survive in these coves since the last glaciation through a combination of rocks rich in basic minerals, a harsh <b>micro-climate,</b> and inaccessibility to grazing sheep on cliff ledges. However, these populations are small and are not reproducing well. Natural England has introduced a recovery plan for them.|$|E
25|$|The {{biodiversity}} {{is caused}} by Grande Terre's central mountain range, which has created a variety of niches, landforms and <b>micro-climates</b> where endemic species thrive.|$|R
50|$|The climate around Bakio is cool, rainy and {{completely}} Atlantic, while inland around Balsameda, it is warmer, drier and more continental with <b>micro-climates</b> in each valley.|$|R
50|$|The {{elevation}} at the town's {{center is}} 2,200 meters (7,200 ft) {{and the town}} {{is characterized by a}} variety of <b>micro-climates</b> ranging from semi-tropical to very cold.|$|R
25|$|Castelo Branco; {{location}} of the international airport, its 1115 inhabitants {{are involved in a}} mix of agricultural and enterprises associated with primary and secondary industries along the southern coast that includes the <b>micro-climate</b> of Varadouro.|$|E
25|$|The Mediterranean climate, {{influenced}} by the Atlantic and characterized by moderate temperatures and wet winters, is typical of continental Portugal. Although the climate {{in the area of}} Cabo da Roca is semi-arid, the Sintra Mountains are considered moderately humid: precipitation in the mountains is higher than in the surrounding areas. The position of the town in the natural landscape of the Sintra Mountains (consisting of an exuberant natural patrimony), is {{influenced by}} the existence of a <b>micro-climate.</b> For different reasons (the climate here has been moderated by the Sintra Mountains; the fertility of the soils; and its relative proximity to the Tagus estuary) the region attracted considerable early settlement. Due to its <b>micro-climate,</b> a huge park has developed full of dense foliage with a rich botanical diversity.|$|E
25|$|The Rocky Hollow Falls Canyon Nature Preserve is {{a series}} of canyons cut into the sandstone. Rocky Hollow is the longest and Falls Canyon has the only {{existing}} waterfall (seasonal) in the park. There are six designated trails through the preserve, each with its own unique <b>micro-climate.</b> Depending on the season, these trails may be impassable or muddy, or refreshing on a hot afternoon.|$|E
50|$|The {{interaction}} {{of these elements}} with the state's topography create <b>micro-climates</b> in the Shenandoah Valley, the mountainous southwest, and the coastal plains that are slightly but noticeably distinct from each other.|$|R
50|$|A varied {{range of}} <b>micro-climates,</b> {{dominated}} by a mild Mediterranean climate, and health-conscious diets and lifestyles in California, promote the production, use and consumption of fresh fruits, vegetables and meats, many of them organic.|$|R
50|$|The {{site was}} {{probably}} {{used as a}} laboratory of agricultural products because of the various <b>micro-climates</b> found within the complex. Tipon {{is considered one of}} the 16 most important archaeological tours for tourists who visit the area.|$|R
25|$|An {{emerging}} sparkling wine-focused {{region in}} Ontario is Prince Edward County, Ontario. The County is {{noted for its}} Prince Edward County Wine and is the fourth and newest Designated Viticultural Area (DVA) in the Province. Like the Niagara Peninsula, Prince Edward County's terroir and <b>micro-climate</b> are well suited for cool climate grapes where wineries, such as The Hinterland Wine Company, specialize {{in the production of}} sparkling wines.|$|E
25|$|Central Maui {{consists}} {{primarily of}} Kahului and Wailuku. Kahului is literally {{the center of}} the island, and tends to keep steady, high temperatures throughout the year. The <b>micro-climate</b> in Kahului can be at times muggy, but it usually feels relatively dry and is often very breezy. The Wailuku area is set closer to the West Maui Mountain range. Here, more rainfall will be found throughout the year, and higher humidity levels.|$|E
25|$|Also, {{due to a}} <b>micro-climate</b> in {{the area}} of Alagoa, the parish enjoyed a period of fruit {{cultivation}} (something rare {{to the rest of the}} island), where oblong apples (similar to pears in shape) were grown. The small port of Alagoa, for many decades, was the point of embarkation for orange exports from the valley; an example of a successes in a peripheral economy, orange exports were sent directly to England, by English and Portuguese ships.|$|E
25|$|Consequently, {{the area}} is prone to various <b>micro-climates,</b> {{affected}} by variations in altitude, topographic characteristics, human occupation, different exposures and thermal variation. Similarly, the variation {{has resulted in a}} variation in vegetation characteristic of Mediterranean, Euro-Siberian and Alpine environments.|$|R
50|$|<b>Micro-climates</b> {{exist in}} these coastal regions, and {{there can be}} great {{differences}} in the weather between various locations. Strong winds such as the Mistral, a cold dry wind from the northwest or from the east, are another characteristic, particularly in the winter.|$|R
50|$|Le Clos, Au Château, les Peiguins, Au Bourg, A la Croix, Aux Bulands and Vers le Mont are the climats/lieux-dits (specific named vineyards) {{with the}} most {{desirable}} <b>micro-climates,</b> and which sometimes be found indicated on the labels together with the name Saint-Véran.|$|R
25|$|Walker Arboretum: Located {{along the}} {{hillside}} of Rodman Hall and the Twelve Mile Creek below, the original owner of this estate was Thomas Rodman Merritt, son of William Hamilton Merritt. In the late 19th century, an English landscape designer named Samuel Richardson {{was hired by}} Merritt to tend the grounds. As a result, the arboretum is an extensive, rambling garden with rare conifers which benefit from an exceptional <b>micro-climate.</b> It boasts {{one of the largest}} Chinese Empress trees in Canada.|$|E
25|$|Ontario, and in {{particular}} the Niagara Peninsula, is the largest wine growing region in Canada. Approximately 26 of the Niagara Peninsula wineries produce some sparkling wine, where annual production averages about 55,000 cases (500,000 litres). Sparkling wine is largely produced in the Traditional Method (65%), and a smaller proportion is produced in the Charmat method (35%). The Niagara Peninsula region's <b>micro-climate</b> is well suited for the growth of Chardonnay, Riesling, Vidal Blanc, Pinot Noir and Gamay grapes, which are the prominent varietals for Ontario sparkling wine. Ontario sparkling wines are often noted for having a character and aroma comparable to that of traditional Champagne, including biscuit, subtle yeast and palate cleansing bubbles.|$|E
25|$|During snowfalls when {{temperatures}} hover {{close to}} freezing, northern {{parts of the}} city, such as around Derry Road away from warmer Lake Ontario usually get more snow that sticks to the ground because of the lower temperatures. The reverse occurs when a strong storm approaches from the south kicking up lake effect snow, bringing higher snowfall totals to south Mississauga. The city usually experiences 6 months of snow free weather however there is the odd occurrence where snow does fall either in October or May. The Port Credit and Lakeview areas have a <b>micro-climate</b> more affected by {{the proximity of the}} open lake, warming winter temperatures as a result but it can be sharply cooler on spring and summer afternoons, this can also be the case in Clarkson, but with much less consistency.|$|E
50|$|The field also {{includes}} the topics of air quality, Radiation Fluxes, <b>Micro-Climates</b> and even issues traditionally associated with architectural design and engineering, such as Wind Engineering. Causes and effects of pollution as understood through Urban Climatology are becoming more important for Urban Planning.|$|R
50|$|Because local <b>micro-climates</b> {{can vary}} significantly, such data {{needs to come}} from within the crop. Monitoring {{stations}} usually transmit data back by terrestrial radio, although occasionally satellite systems are used. Solar power is often employed to make the station independent of the power grid.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Further {{investigations}} verified earlier {{observations that}} even springs with almost identical catchment-areas might differ remarkably in their water supplies, water temperatures, and hydrochemical properties. In the present case, {{four years of}} investigation showed, that two springs hydrogeologically belonging together had distinct, individual physical and chemical <b>micro-climates...</b>|$|R
2500|$|The park being {{completely}} enclosed within {{a ring of}} hills, has its own <b>micro-climate</b> and probably receives some convectional rainfall, in addition to rain from the two monsoons. [...] In the remaining months, condensation on vegetation of mist shrouding the valley is estimated to yield 15 per cent of the total water generated in the rainforest.|$|E
2500|$|It {{is often}} anecdotally said by locals that Waiheke has a <b>micro-climate</b> which differs {{to that of}} other parts of the Auckland isthmus. Though little factual data appears to exist to support this, the below-listed climatic data taken from a recent NIWA report [...] does suggest Waiheke {{receives}} over 100 hours more per year of sunshine than other parts of Auckland. Detailed monthly climate data, such as air temperature, sea temperature and wind speeds is needed but {{does not appear to be}} readily available.|$|E
2500|$|Beverly Hills has a hot {{and warm}} Mediterranean <b>micro-climate,</b> {{with an average}} high of 85 degrees Fahrenheit (29.4 degrees Celsius) in August, and an average high of 67 degrees Fahrenheit (19.5 degrees Celsius) in January (source Weather.com). Beverly Hills also {{receives}} an average [...] of rain per year. Summers are marked by warm to hot temperatures with very little wind, while winters are warm to moderate, to cool with occasional rain alternating with periods of Santa Ana winds. Measurable snowfall has been recorded only in 1882, 1922, 1932, [...] 1949 and 1958.|$|E
5000|$|Given the {{diversity}} of plants, specialist habitats and <b>micro-climates</b> in the park, a diversity of fungi, including lichens, {{is also expected to}} occur. Several hundred species have already been recorded by field naturalists and interested individuals and {{can be found in the}} Atlas of Living Australia.|$|R
50|$|Social {{psychology}} field {{researchers are}} alerted {{to the fact}} that different field settings - such as hospitals, airport or cafeterias - may have their own particular <b>micro-climates,</b> influencing people's actions and motivation in micro-specific ways, so that findings from any given setting should not be generalised without external checking.|$|R
50|$|The Alps are {{a habitat}} for 30,000 species of wildlife, {{ranging from the}} tiniest snow fleas to brown bears, {{many of which have}} made adaptations to the harsh cold {{conditions}} and high altitudes to the point that some only survive in specific <b>micro-climates</b> either directly above or below the snow line.|$|R
2500|$|Passive cooling is {{achieved}} through multiple design strategies; {{the most significant}} being operable windows. [...] The windows are enhanced by automated louvers, high ceilings, a shallow floor plate, and a central court {{that acts as a}} chimney, drawing the warmer air out the windows and up through the courtyard. [...] Exterior shading devices protect occupants from significant solar heat gains and a white roof keeps the upper floors cool while reducing the urban heat island effect. Every exterior façade is treated differently, according to its <b>micro-climate</b> and sun exposure.|$|E
2500|$|Faial is a tourist's {{island with}} a rich {{collection}} of historical, natural and modern attractions that annually attract yachts, cruise ships, tourist groups and the naturalists to the hills and streets of the island. Apart from several hotels and bed & breakfasts scattered throughout the parishes, the visitor seeking sun will likely travel to the black sand beaches of Praia de Almoxarife, Conceição and Porto Pim, {{as well as the}} rock pools scattered along the coast. [...] Varadouro is one such place, known for its warmer waters, <b>micro-climate,</b> summer cottages and complicated salt-water pools open to the ocean.|$|E
2500|$|St. Catharines' {{climate is}} humid {{continental}} (Köppen borderline Dfa/Dfb). It {{has a unique}} <b>micro-climate</b> because of the moderating influence of Lake Ontario/Lake Erie and the sheltering effect of the Niagara Escarpment to the south; these allow wineries to flourish. As a result, the city records numerous frost-free days and frequent thaws in the winter, although it sometimes receives heavy lake-effect snow during certain wind conditions, and micro-cooling lakeside on some spring afternoons. The summer season is predominantly warm, sometimes hot, with an average high temperature of [...] in July, and humidity is often high. Summer thunderstorms are commonplace but generally less prevalent and less severe than further west in southern Ontario due to the diminishing effect of the surrounding lakes.|$|E
40|$|Native {{ranges of}} Utah are {{extremely}} heterogeneous. Pronounced variations exist in soil, seasonal rainfall, temperatures, and altitude on most grazing areas. Rough topography and <b>micro-climates</b> on even individual grazing allotments present variable vegetation types and site conditions. Such variations {{account for the}} comparatively large number of species and variable nutritive content found in range forage...|$|R
50|$|In recent years, the Persian lime {{industry}} {{has taken off}} in Veracruz, dominated by large-scale producers, with over 25% of limes being produced using micro-jet irrigation or other irrigation systems, year-round in <b>micro-climates.</b> Transportation costs from Veracruz to the US border are reported to be approximately 11,500 pesos (US$912.69) per trailer, depending on fuel prices.|$|R
25|$|In Corton-Charlemagne, Chardonnay {{is valued}} {{for its ability}} to adapt to a variety of soils and <b>micro-climates</b> while {{reliably}} ripening to adequate sugar levels that don't necessitate much chaptalization. There is a risk, particularly with late-harvesting, that the acidity levels of the grape drop too much which can made a wine that is excessively flabby on the palate.|$|R
