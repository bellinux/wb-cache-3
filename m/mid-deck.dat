40|$|The {{briefing}} {{started with}} opening remarks from George Diller (NASA Public Affairs). Jeff Spaulding (NASA Test Director) discussed the Shuttle launch {{status and the}} return to the International Space Station 12 day mission. Debbie Hahn (STS- 121 Payload Manager) discussed the installation of <b>mid-decks</b> on ISS and the 2 tons of cargo (mainly crew supplies and food) and the oxygen regeneration system. Kathy Winters (Shuttle Weather Officer) discussed the weather forecast for the launch. The team also answered questions from the press...|$|R
5000|$|In the 1970s, {{the city}} of Long Beach began {{redevelopment}} of the area, expanding into the Pacific Ocean, eliminating the recreational bathing beach by pouring landfill over it. The city had purchased the RMS Queen Mary in 1967 and permanently docked the ship in Long Beach across {{the mouth of the}} Los Angeles River from the shoreline area of the Nu-Pike where a new road circled the parking lot and Londontowne shopping-dining complex serviced by a London Double Deck omnibus to Downtown Long Beach. The Nu-Pike was renamed [...] "Queens Park" [...] when the Queen Mary opened to the public in 1971 as a self-guided maritime museum tour on the upper decks and former engine room, hotel utilizing the former luxury staterooms of the <b>mid-decks</b> and Jacques Cousteau's The Living Sea. Focus and attention was further diverted from Queens Park with Shoreline Village and Rainbow Harbor marina, serviced by Shoreline Drive, built to connect to the Long Beach Freeway on even more ocean landfill south of the Pike, as locals continued to call it. Planning for Shoreline Drive and a cloverleaf connection to the new Magnolia Bridge was the excuse to demolish the Cyclone Racer in 1968. Since 1975, the area has been a major portion of the Grand Prix of Long Beach route.|$|R
25|$|Discovery {{carried with}} it {{replacement}} parts in a <b>mid-deck</b> locker for a malfunctioning toilet on the International Space Station. The crew {{had been using}} other facilities for waste until the new replacement parts were installed on the Zvezda module of the ISS.|$|E
25|$|Working {{from the}} <b>mid-deck</b> of Endeavour, Andrew Feustel, {{who participated in}} the first three spacewalks of the mission, was the EVA 4 choreographer. Astronaut Steven Swanson was the spacewalk CAPCOM from the station flight control room in Houston. During Flight Day 12, Mike Fincke {{achieved}} a milestone, becoming the U.S. astronaut with the most time in space, more than 377 days. He surpassed the time in space of astronaut Peggy Whitson.|$|E
25|$|Early on the day, Commander Ferguson and Pilot Hurley {{also spent}} some time working to {{successfully}} repair the door that gives the crew access to the LiOH canisters. Mission Specialist Magnus spent {{about an hour and}} a half in the morning taking microbial air samples on various locations in the space station. The collected samples will be returned for study and further analysis. Magnus also worked the Japanese Experiment Module Remote Manipulator System (JEMRMS). Mission Specialist Walheim along with station crew member Mike Fossum continued work with spacewalking equipment in the Quest airlock. Some of them will be left on the station, and will be utilized during an upcoming Russian spacewalks on 3 August 2011. Hurley working with station crew member Ron Garan stored some of the cargo in Atlantis's middeck to be returned. Since no astronaut was riding in the <b>mid-deck,</b> on the way back, it was expected to be fully packed with 1564 pounds of cargo. Among cargo brought to the space station, 2281 pounds were also in the <b>mid-deck.</b>|$|E
25|$|During flight day 9 Danny Olivas and Christer Fuglesang {{performed}} EVA 3. The pair completed all {{tasks that}} were to be done, including installing two GPS antennas and deploying the Starboard 3 (S3) Payload Attach System (PAS), a new Rate Gyro Assembly (RGA) 2 and routing of Node 3 Avionics cables. The joint crew also completed more transfer, mostly transfer for return to earth in the MPLM and space shuttle <b>mid-deck.</b> The ISS crew also replaced a bolt on the Common Berthing Mechanism (CBM) so that the MPLM won't get stuck, and also to ensure correct capture of the HTV.|$|E
25|$|Discovery docked {{with the}} Pressurized Mating Adapter (PMA) 2 {{on the front}} of the Harmony {{connecting}} module. Before the shuttle docked, Commander Rick Sturckow performed what is known as the Rendezvous Pitch Maneuver while Expedition 20 Commander Gennady Padalka and Flight Engineer Michael Barret took photos of the shuttle's belly. The photos were down-linked to mission control for review. After docking, Nicole Stott and Tim Kopra switched Soyuz seat liners, making Stott an Expedition 20 Flight Engineer and Tim Kopra an STS-128 Mission Specialist. The joint crews also performed some transfers from the shuttle <b>mid-deck</b> and checked on the pressure in the MPLM Leonardo.|$|E
25|$|During flight day 4, the MPLM Leonardo was berthed to the Nadir (the Earth-facing port on Harmony) {{using the}} Space Station Remote Manipulator System (SSRMS). Once it was berthed, the crews {{activated}} it {{and opened the}} hatch for ingress. Some more items were transferred from the shuttle <b>mid-deck</b> including the MDS experiment and the space suits Danny Olivas and Nicole Stott would use during EVA 1. The pair also prepared all the tools {{that would be used}} during the EVA with some help from Tim Kopra. Later during the night when the crews were asleep, the team of ground controllers vented the Port 1 (P1) Ammonia Tank Assembly (ATA) Nitrogen Vent lines in preparation for the ATA to be removed during EVA 1.|$|E
25|$|The crew of STS-131 {{continued}} with transfer {{activities on the}} morning of flight day 10. The morning was devoted largely to transferring items to the MPLM Leonardo. There are only a few items awaiting transfer to space shuttle Discoverys <b>mid-deck</b> left. The crew enjoyed an hour long mid-day meal with the Expedition 23 crew. The entire joint crew took part in a crew photo, which was followed by a joint crew news conference with U.S., Russian and Japanese media. Later in the day commander Alan Poindexter, mission specialists Dorothy Metcalf-Lindenburger, Stephanie Wilson and Clayton Anderson took time out to talk with students from Eastern Guilford High School in Gibsonville, North Carolina and with third and fourth graders from that school district. The majority of the crews afternoon was spent off duty.|$|E
25|$|After {{working through}} the checklists to safely power down the shuttle, the crew egressed Atlantis into the Crew Transport Vehicle (CTV). Shortly after, the Houston Mission Control Center handed over Atlantis to the landing convoy at the KSC. The crew {{performed}} the traditional walk-around of the shuttle after walking down the stairs from the CTV. On the runway, they also met NASA Administrator Charles Bolden, NASA Deputy Administrator Lori Garver, KSC Center Director Robert Cabana, shuttle program manager John Shannon, launch director Mike Leinbach, Atlantis flow manager Angie Brewer, and other NASA officials. Charles Bolden and Commander Ferguson spoke briefly on the tarmac. Feguson did note that {{the door to the}} Waste Collection System in shuttle's <b>mid-deck</b> flew open during entry. After the speech, the crew got into the AstroVan for the ride to the crew quarters building where they spend the night before returning to Houston the next day.|$|E
25|$|On flight day 7 astronauts Clay Anderson and Rick Mastracchio {{performed}} {{their second}} spacewalk of the STS-131 mission. Mastracchio and Anderson exited the airlock at 05:30 UTC, a full 45 minutes {{ahead of the}} planned time, and spent 7 hours and 26 minutes outside the ISS. The pair removed the old Ammonia Tank Assembly (ATA) from the S1 truss and installed the new ATA. Anderson and Mastracchio ran into a small problem {{when one of the}} four bolts that holds the tank in place wouldn't turn. They loosened the other three and tried them all again and the fourth bolt was successfully tightened. The two spacewalkers helped guide the SSRMS to temporarily stow the old ATA on the truss structure. The new ATA had its electrical connections made, but the fluid connections were deferred until the third spacewalk since the EVA was behind the time-line. Mastracchio and Anderson also installed two radiator grapple fixture stowage beams on the P1 truss. While Anderson and Mastracchio were outside, members of the STS-131 crew continued transferring items from space shuttle Discoverys <b>mid-deck</b> and the MPLM Leonardo. Overall, the crew had completed about half of the transfer work.|$|E
25|$|The seven person crew of STS-131 {{was awakened}} {{to begin their}} first full day in space on Flight Day 2. Due {{to the lack of}} Ku-band communication, changes to the crews daily plan were read up for them to write out. After their post sleep activities, {{commander}} Alan Poindexter and pilot Jim Dutton fired Discoverys Orbital Maneuvering System (OMS) engines to correct and further refine the shuttle's path to the ISS. Astronauts Naoko Yamazaki and Dorothy Metcalf-Lindenburger began activating and checking out the Shuttle Remote Manipulator System (SRMS) also known as the Canadarm. While Metcalf-Lindenburger and Yamazaki were working with Canadarm, Stephanie Wilson was getting equipment together and set up to record the inspections of the shuttle's heat shield. The inspections were recorded so they could be downlinked to the ground once docked to the ISS. Once all that work was done, commander Poindexter and pilot Dutton joined Metcalf-Lindenburger, Yamazaki, and Wilson to conduct the inspection of the shuttle's heat shield. While the inspection was going on, Rick Mastracchio and Clayton Anderson were on the <b>mid-deck</b> of Discovery checking out the Extravehicular Mobility Units (EMU) and getting them ready for their three spacewalks. The last portion of the crew day was spent preparing and checking out all of the tools used during rendezvous.|$|E
25|$|On flight day 16, {{the members}} of space shuttle Endeavours STS-134 crew {{continued}} preparations for the shuttle's landing on flight day 17. Commander Mark Kelly, pilot Greg Johnson and mission specialist and flight engineer Roberto Vittori performed a checkout of Endeavours Flight Control Systems (FCS). They began by starting Auxiliary Power Unit 1 (APU 1), so they could test the flight systems such as the ailerons and rudder. The APU was used to provide hydraulic pressure to power the flight control systems. The astronauts next moved on to {{a test of the}} Reaction Control System (RCS) jets. This test saw Kelly, Johnson and Vittori fire each jet once. Meanwhile, Drew Feustel, Mike Fincke and Greg Chamitoff stowed items on the <b>mid-deck</b> for their return to Earth. Later in the crew day, they stowed the Ku band antenna for re-entry. The crew also performed several experiments, including an eye exam and the Ram Burn Observation (RAMBO2) experiments, and conducted a deorbit briefing to go over the procedures for the landing. The entire crew furthermore participated in in-flight interviews with ABC News, CBS News, CNN, NBC News and Fox News Radio, and sent a crew tribute to Endeavour down to the ground.|$|E
25|$|Flight day 6 was {{dedicated}} to transferring supplies from the MPLM Leonardo and the space shuttle <b>mid-deck.</b> The crews transferred the Windows Observational Research Facility (WORF) to the Destiny lab. Mission specialist Naoko Yamazaki, along with flight engineer Soichi Noguchi also transferred the Express Rack 7 (ER7) to its final location. During the crews morning, a smoke alarm sounded in the Russian segment of the station, which prompted the joint crew to move into emergency procedures. However the alarm was false and was cleared {{within a couple of}} minutes and all normal work resumed. Mission specialists Clay Anderson, Rick Mastracchio and Stephanie Wilson conducted in-flight interviews with Nebraska Public Radio, CBS Newspath and Radio Network and KETV-TV in Omaha, Nebraska. Later in the day commander Alan Poindexter, pilot Jim Dutton and mission specialist Dorothy Metcalf-Lindenburger talked with students at the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, California. At the end of the crews work day, the joint crew got together and reviewed the procedures for the second spacewalk. After the procedures review spacewalkers Clay Anderson and Rick Mastracchio entered the Quest airlock, closed the hatch and lowered the inside pressure to 10.2 psi. The pair also breathed pure oxygen for an hour while the pressure was being lowered.|$|E
2500|$|On flight day 7, Danny Olivas and Christer Fuglesang {{performed}} the second spacewalk of the STS-128 mission. Olivas and Fuglesang installed and connected the new Ammonia Tank Assembly (ATA), and also performed two get aheads. The get ahead tasks included installing protective lens covers on the Space Station Remote Manipulator System (SSRMS) End B cameras [...] Once the ATA was installed, the tank was {{integrated into the}} cooling loop. While Olivas and Fuglesang were outside, {{the rest of the}} crew continued on transferring items to and from both the shuttle <b>mid-deck</b> and MPLM.|$|E
2500|$|On flight day 11 the MPLM Leonardos hatches {{were closed}} at 07:38 UTC (03:38 EDT) and the MPLM was unberthed from the nadir or earth facing port of the Harmony node at 20:24 UTC (16:24 EDT). It {{was placed in}} a low hover, about [...] above shuttle Discoverys payload bay. This was done because the MPLM was unberthed from Harmony later than planned. The delay in {{unberthing}} was caused by a set of bolts on the Common Berthing Mechanism (CBM) getting stuck due to a broken pin. The crew will finish putting Leonardo in the payload bay on flight day 12, prior to the docked late inspection. The crews conducted some transfer operations between the ISS and shuttle <b>mid-deck,</b> which brings the overall transfer operations to ninety-four percent complete for the mission.|$|E

There almost at once they start making a tent: drawing a huge tarpaulin over a cross rope in the <b>mid-deck</b> below us, {{between the first and}} second class regions. The great tarpaulin is pulled down well on either side and fastened down, and it makes a big dark tent. The soldiers creep in and place their bundles.|$|E
50|$|While most STS-50 {{experiments}} {{were conducted in}} the U.S. Microgravity Laboratory, others were operating in Columbia’s <b>mid-deck.</b> Included in the <b>mid-deck</b> {{experiments were}} studies of Protein Crystal Growth, Astroculture, and Zeolite Crystal Growth.|$|E
