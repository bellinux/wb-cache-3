40|$|Modern {{parallel}} and cluster file systems provide {{highly scalable}} I/O bandwidth by enabling highly parallel {{access to file}} data. Unfortunately metadata access does not benefit from parallel data transfer, so metadata performance scaling is less common. To support metadata-intensive workloads, we offer a middleware design that layers on top of existing cluster file systems, adds support for load balanced and high-performance metadata operations without sacrificing data bandwidth. The core idea is to integrate a distributed indexing mechanism with a metadata optimized on-disk Log-Structured Merge tree layout. The integration requires several optimizations including cross-server split operations with minimum data <b>migration,</b> <b>and</b> <b>decoupling</b> of data and metadata paths. To demonstrate the feasibility of our approach, we implemented a prototype middleware layer GIGA+TableFS and evaluated it with a Panasas parallel file system. GIGA+TableFS improves metadata performance of PanFS by as much an order of magnitude, while still performing comparably on data-intensive workloads...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — The {{effective}} design of power distribution networks has become highly challenging with each technology generation. The power delivery network is becoming large, making the system analysis process computationally complex. The large number of on-chip power supplies <b>and</b> intentional <b>decoupling</b> capacitors inserted throughout an integrated circuit further complicates {{the analysis of the}} power distribution network. To fully exploit the on-chip power supplies <b>and</b> <b>decoupling</b> capacitors, a new design methodology is required to simultaneously design the power distribution network that considers all of the power supplies <b>and</b> <b>decoupling</b> capacitors. Interactions among the power supplies, <b>decoupling</b> capacitors, <b>and</b> active circuitry are investigated in this paper utilizing a computationally efficient methodology. The effect of physical distance on the power supply noise is investigated. A design methodology for simultaneous placement of the on-chip voltage regulators <b>and</b> <b>decoupling</b> capacitors is also described in this paper. This methodology changes conventional practices where the power distribution network is designed first, followed by the placement of the decoupling capacitors. I...|$|R

40|$|AIM: To {{study the}} effect of {{nicotine}} on the <b>migration</b> <b>and</b> invasion of human esophageal squamous carcinoma cells and to investigate whether nimesulide can inhibit {{the effect of}} nicotine. METHODS: The esophageal squamous carcinoma cell line (TE- 13) was treated with different concentrations of nicotine (100 μg/mL and 200 μg/mL) or 200 μg/mL nicotine plus 100 μmol/L nimesulide. Cell <b>migration</b> <b>and</b> invasion were measured using <b>migration</b> <b>and</b> invasion chamber systems. COX- 2 expression was determined by Western blotting. Matrix metalloproteinase- 2 (MMP- 2) was analyzed by zymography and ELISA. RESULTS: Nicotine (100 μg/mL, 200 μg/mL) enhanced TE- 13 cells <b>migration</b> <b>and</b> invasion, and increased the protein expression of COX- 2 and the activity of MMP- 2. Nicotine (200 μg/mL) stimulated TE- 13 cells <b>migration</b> <b>and</b> invasion which were partly blocked by nimesulide. This was associated with decreased protein expression of COX- 2 and decreased activity and protein expression of MMP- 2. CONCLUSION: Nicotine enhances the <b>migration</b> <b>and</b> invasion of the esophageal squamous carcinoma cell line, and nimesulide partly blocks the effect of nicotine-enhanced esophageal squamous carcinoma cell <b>migration</b> <b>and</b> invasion...|$|R
40|$|The {{coordination}} of {{the motions of}} the robots {{is one of the}} fundamental problems for multi-robot systems. A popular approach to avoid planning in the high-dimensional composite configuration space are prioritized <b>and</b> <b>decoupled</b> techniques. While these methods are very efficient, they have two major drawbacks. First, they are incomplete, i. e. they sometimes fail to find a solution even if one exists, and second, the resulting solutions are often not optimal. They furthermore leave open how to assign the priorities to the individual robots. In this paper we present a method for optimizing priority schemes for such prioritized <b>and</b> <b>decoupled</b> planning techniques. Our approach performs a randomized search with hill-climbing to find solutions and to minimize the overall path lengths. The technique has been implemented and tested on real robots and in extensive simulation runs. The experimental results demonstrate that our method is able to seriously reduce the number of failures and to significantly reduce the overall path length for different prioritized <b>and</b> <b>decoupled</b> path planning techniques and even for large teams of robots. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{potential}} {{link between}} climate change, <b>migration,</b> <b>and</b> conflict {{has been widely}} discussed and is increasingly viewed by policy makers as a security issue.
