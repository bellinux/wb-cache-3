25|$|The Mishnah {{taught that}} they handed the {{scapegoat}} {{over to him}} who was to lead it away. All were permitted to lead it away, but the Priests made it a rule not to permit an ordinary Israelite to lead it away. Rabbi Jose said that Arsela of Sepphoris once led it away, although {{he was not a}} priest. The people went with him from booth to booth, except the last one. The escorts would not go with him up to the precipice, but watched from a distance. The one leading the scapegoat divided the thread of crimson wool, and tied one half to the rock, the other half between the scapegoat horns, and pushed the scapegoat from behind. And it went rolling down and before it had reached half its way down the hill, it was dashed to pieces. He came back and sat down under the last booth until it grew dark. His garments unclean become unclean from the <b>moment</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> has gone outside the wall of Jerusalem, although Rabbi Simeon taught that they became unclean from the <b>moment</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> pushed it over the precipice.|$|E

25|$|The four {{survivors}} were bitterly grieved by the loss, {{for they}} had grown into a band of brothers, and they swore to keep a sharp eye out for the Albatroses of Richthofen's squadron which had brought down Nash. At {{the same time they}} thought that Nash was dead. On the morning of June 27th they met the Richthofen Staffel near Courtrai, and this time Collishaw found himself engaged with the bright-green Albatros of Allmenröder – though he was not aware at the <b>moment</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was fighting the conqueror of Nash. It was one of the classic dogfights of the war, like Barker against Linke, like Hawker against Richthofen – two skilled and experienced fighters, who knew every trick, had met.|$|E
25|$|The remake {{version of}} the video is about a person who loses touch with himself. Originally full of life, the protagonist becomes a robot working a {{monotonous}} office job. One morning, he wakes up from a dream of a beautiful girl dressed in white on the beach. He leaves for work, and his buried alter egos, dressed in white shirts, black slacks, assorted ties and each holding either red or white roses, emerge mysteriously. At work, his boss gives him a stack of paperwork, which he does mechanically. Meanwhile, at home, the alter egos are {{in a circle around}} his coffee table, throw the roses in the center, and leave. Back at work, he prepares to go home, but is then given another stack of documents. His frustrations boil over, and he throws his tie at his boss. He runs home not knowing what he is running for, and at the <b>moment</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> walks in the door, the last of the alter egos exits. He finds a white box that replaced his coffee table and is intrigued. He unwraps the red and white ribbons and opens the box to find himself on the beach with the same girl in his dream and the roses on the water.|$|E

The second of nine children, he was immediately nicknamed [...] "Walt" [...] to distinguish him from his father. Walter Whitman, Sr. named three of his seven sons after American leaders: Andrew Jackson, George Washington, and Thomas Jefferson. The oldest was named Jesse and another boy died unnamed {{at the age of}} six months. The couple's sixth son, the youngest, was named Edward. At age four, Whitman moved with his family from West Hills to Brooklyn, living in a series of homes, in part due to bad investments. Whitman looked back on his childhood as generally restless and unhappy, given his family's difficult economic status. One happy <b>moment</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> later recalled was when he was lifted in the air and kissed on the cheek by the Marquis de Lafayette during a celebration in Brooklyn on July 4, 1825.|$|E
500|$|... "For Your Eyes Only" [...] {{begins with}} the murder of the Havelocks, a British couple in Jamaica who have refused to sell their estate to Herr von Hammerstein, a former Gestapo officer who is the chief of counterintelligence for the Cuban secret service. They are killed by two Cuban hitmen at the {{direction}} of their leader, Major Gonzales; all three work for von Hammerstein. The Havelocks turn out to be close friends of M, who served as the groom's best man during their wedding in 1925. M subsequently gives Bond a voluntary assignment, unconnected to sanctioned Secret Service duties, to travel to Vermont via Canada, find von Hammerstein at his rented estate at Echo Lake and assassinate him as a warning to future criminals who might think to target British citizens. When Bond arrives on the scene, he finds the Havelocks' daughter, Judy, who intends to carry out her own mission of revenge with a bow and arrow. Judy kills von Hammerstein by shooting him in the back with an arrow from [...] away at the exact <b>moment</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> dives into a lake. A shoot-out then occurs between Bond and Gonzales and the two Cuban gunmen. Bond kills all of them and returns to Canada with Judy, who has been wounded during the gunfight.|$|E

Note that this change implies that Santa Claus made his exclamation during the <b>moment</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> disappeared from view, while the exclamation came before his disappearance in the original.

2500|$|The Hall of African Mammals {{was first}} {{proposed}} {{to the museum}} by Carl Akeley around 1909. His original concept contained forty dioramas which would present the rapidly vanishing landscapes and animals of Africa. The intent was that a visitor of the hall, “may have the illusion, at worst, of passing a series of pictures of primeval Africa, and at best, may think for a <b>moment</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> has stepped [...] across the sea into Africa itself.” Akeley’s proposal was a hit with both {{the board of trustees}} and then museum president, Henry Fairfield Osborne. To fund its creation, Daniel Pomeroy, a trustee of the museum and partner at J.P. Morgan, offered interested investors the opportunity to accompany the museum’s expeditions in Africa in exchange for funding.|$|E

2500|$|The {{creator and}} {{caretaker}} of the engine. Dustin Hoffman was {{considered for the}} role. About the character, Harris said, [...] "He's so built up, who this guy is, and then there's this big thing open, and he's just this old guy making dinner with his robe on, but director Bong really {{wanted him to be}} matter-of-fact and very mundane, and simple, and kind of freaky that way." [...] also added that the character is [...] "probably a coagulation of various folks". The role of Wilford was the last to be cast, and it was friend and fellow filmmaker Park Chan-Wook who suggested Harris for the role. Bong stated that Wilford needed to be played by someone with [...] "tremendous presence and performance from the first <b>moment</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> appeared in order to convince the audience", adding that [...] " [...] turned Wilford into a lively and ironic character with added appeal." [...] On taking the role of Wilford, Harris mentioned, [...] "When I was sent this script, I was told director Bong is a Korean director, and that he'd made some other films, but I had never seen any of them [...] I thought they were wonderfully accomplished films, which really made me want to work with the guy. I'm a big fan of his." [...] Harris was very praiseworthy of Bong, especially his tendency of editing the piece whilst shooting. Since the film's release, Bong has revealed background information about the character, such as Wilford being bisexual, [...] "He slept with Claude, the Egg-Head, Mason, and the pregnant teacher. Yet, his the One is the Engine." [...] Tyler John Williams portrays a young Wilford.|$|E
