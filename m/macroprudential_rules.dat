Macroprudential regulators can achieve efficiency with simple linear constraints, which require less information than Pigouvian taxes.

Then, we propose a <b>macroprudential</b> <b>rule</b> for the counter- cyclical capital buffer of Basel III in which capital requirements respond to credit growth, output and housing prices. We find that the optimal implementation of Basel III is countercyclical for borrowers and banks, the agents directly affected by capital requirements, while procyclical for savers. From a normative perspective, we see that this <b>macroprudential</b> <b>rule</b> for Basel III delivers higher welfare for the society than a situation with no regulation...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{interaction}} between macroprudential and monetary policies, using a DSGE model with a housing market and collateral constraints.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to study the {{interaction}} between Basel I, II and III regulations with monetary policy. In order to do that, we use a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model with a housing market, banks, borrowers, and savers. Results show that monetary policy needs to be more aggressive when the capital requirement ratio (CRR) increases because the money multiplier decreases. However, this policy combination brings a more stable economic and financial system. We also analyze the optimal way to implement the countercyclical capital buffer stated by Basel III. We propose that the CRR follows a rule that responds to deviations of credit from its steady state.

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{interaction}} of monetary policy and banking regulation and supervision and what it may imply {{for the design of}} their institutional setup. Reforms implemented all over the world {{in the aftermath of the}} financial crisis aimed not only at revising the institutional arrangements of banking supervision that were in place, but also at introducing a macroprudential oversight of the financial system, as a complement to the microprudential approach, mainly empowering central banks with new financial stability objectives and instruments. Despite the research effort undertaken, it is still unclear whether central banks, which main role is to ensure the price stability, should engage in banking supervisory responsibilities and extend their mandates to embrace financial stability goals. This thesis contributes to this literature by: • Surveying the empirical and theoretical literature concerning the implications of the interactions between these policies for the design of their institutional framework. • Assessing the conflicting goals of price and banking stability. Acknowledging that central banks in charge of banking regulation may be less aggressive in their inflation mandate, in cases in which tight monetary policy conditions could have a negative effect on the stability of the banking system, it has been argued that banking supervisory powers should be assigned to an independent authority to avoid inflation bias. • Revisiting the role of monetary policy in 'leaning against the financial imbalances' and its interaction with macroprudential regulation. • Investigating the transmission mechanisms of different macroprudential policy instruments and their interactions with monetary policy-controlled interest rates, under a New Keynesian (NK) model with two types of financial frictions. For this topic, preliminary findings are shown. We start by showing the lack of both analytical and empirical studies focused on the trade-offs between expected benefits (‘sharing of information’ and ‘expertise’) and expected costs (‘conflict of interests’, ‘reputation risks’, ‘organizational costs’ and ‘balance of powers’) of central bank involvement in banking supervision. The main conclusions from the remaining research work conducted in this thesis are: • Empirically, there is no evidence of an inflationary bias arising from institutional frameworks in which central banks have banking supervisory mandates. • Theoretically, based on a NK framework with a banking system and financial frictions, we find that 'leaning against the financial imbalances' monetary policy rules maximise welfare compared to a standard, conventional Taylor rule. Moreover, the deployment of macroprudential regulation together with standard monetary policy also improves welfare, regardless of the financial target used and the type of policy mandate under assessment (separate or unified). The welfare maximization is achieved under a partially unified mandate featuring a <b>macroprudential</b> <b>rule</b> reacting simultaneously to credit and credit spreads. Inflation stabilization is better accomplished in a separate mandate, with a standard Taylor <b>rule</b> and a <b>macroprudential</b> <b>rule</b> responding to credit and spreads. • When considering loan-to-value (LTV) ratios as a macroprudential tool, preliminary results show that less stricter regulatory requirements for the LTV ratio amplify the propagation mechanism of monetary policy shocks...|$|R
40|$|An {{operational}} macroprudential {{approach to}} financial stability requires tools that attribute system-wide risk to individual institutions. Making use of constructs from game theory, we propose an attribution methodology {{that has a}} number of appealing features: it can be used in conjunction with popular risk measures, it provides measures of institutions’ systemic importance that add up exactly to the measure of system-wide risk and it easily accommodates uncertainty about the validity of the risk model. We apply this methodology to a number of constructed examples and illustrate the interactions between drivers of systemic importance: size, the institution’s risk profile and strength of exposures to common risk factors. We also demonstrate how the methodology can be used for the calibration of <b>macroprudential</b> capital <b>rules.</b> Systemic importance, <b>macroprudential</b> approach, Shapley value...|$|R

40|$|Household debt in South Korea is {{high and}} still rising. Household debt to GDP ratio had risen at the similar pace with that in the US until 2007 but it has still been rising whereas it has been falling since 2017 in the US. As a result, it is now higher in South Korea than in the US. There was a {{dramatic}} growth in household debt in the US preceding the recent Great Recession and high level of household debt was viewed to amplify the severity of economic recession in the US constraining consumer spending. In this context, high and continuously rising household debt could be a potential risk factor for the South Korean economy. Macroprudential policy, which indicates policy aims to reduce financial systemic risk pre-emptively, is a crucial measure {{to slow down the}} pace of household debt growth in South Korea. However, there is no established tool to analyse or evaluate its effects and relationship to monetary policy. The second chapter presents the trend and distribution of household debt in South Korea, and brief history of policy responses to continuously increasing household debt. The third chapter shows how macroprudential policy works by using a simple heterogeneous DSGE model with collateral constraint. The model is based on so-called borrower-saver model. Despite of its simplicity, the model can clearly explain how macroprudential policy affects household debt and related variables in South Korea. In addition, dynamics of this model imply increasing amortisation rate is superior measure to decreasing LTV ratio because it induces less volatility in economy. The collateral constraint in this thesis is designed to distinguish household debt (stock) and borrowing (flow). As a result, it is more realistic than the one mostly used in literature. This collateral constraint setting contributes to the better results especially when we analyse the phase of tightening household credit conditions. Furthermore, it enables us to see how amortization rate affects the South Korean economy. The fourth chapter extends the model mainly to see how credit tightening and monetary policy work differently and how they interact. Habit formation in non-durable good consumption, price rigidity in non-durable good producers, fixed cost in intermediate good production and monetary policy are added in the model. Not only the newly added elements themselves but also inflation make model's responses different from those in the previous chapter. Nominal and real rigidities make dynamics last longer and more realistic. Due to the structure of collateral constraint, a rise in inflation can reduce the level of real household debt whereas there is no inflation effect on real household debt with the common type of collateral constraint. This also influences responses to monetary policy shock. The results demonstrate credit tightening is better than monetary policy in slowing down the growth rate of household debt. Among all policy measures considered, decreasing amortization rate is the most effective and increasing LTV ratio is the second. These implies that ongoing policy efforts to slow down the growth rate of household debt in South Korea is on the right track. The fifth chapter shows welfare effects of macroprudential policy. The results illustrate it is impossible to get social welfare gains in a situation given in South Korea when discretionary macroprudential policy comes into effect. If government adopts countercyclical <b>macroprudential</b> <b>rule,</b> it is possible to improve social welfare but it requires welfare loss either of borrower or saver...|$|R
40|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the global financial crisis, there is consensus on the need for macroprudential policies to promote financial stability. However, the optimal way to implement such policies in the Euro area is a question open to debate, given that countries have to coordinate. In this paper, we propose a two-country, two-sector monetary union dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model (DSGE) with housing to analyze the optimal implementation of macroprudential policies in the Euro area. Currently, Spain is the only country within the EU that has not established a macroprudential regulator. We use Spain as a natural experiment to study the effects of a lack of coordination in the use of macroprudential policies in the European Monetary Union (EMU). We focus on a particular <b>macroprudential</b> policy, a <b>rule</b> regarding the loan-to-value ratio, which responds countercyclically to credit booms. We find that such a policy is welfare enhancing for the Euro area. Nevertheless, if one country does not implement the policy, {{but the rest of the}} EMU does, as in the current situation with Spain, this country still yields some benefits as a result of its partners' implementation of the policy because it gains from a more stable financial system without incurring any output costs. However, if all Euro countries actively implement the policy, the welfare gains for all of them are larger...|$|R
