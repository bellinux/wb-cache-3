50|$|Coco peat {{is used as}} a soil conditioner. Due to {{low levels}} of {{nutrients}} in its composition, coco peat is usually not the sole component in the medium used to grow plants. When plants are grown exclusively in coco peat, it is important to add nutrients according to the specific plants' needs. Coco peat from Philippines, Sri Lanka and India contains several macro- and <b>micro-plant</b> nutrients, including substantial quantities of potassium. This extra potassium can interfere with magnesium availability. Adding extra magnesium through the addition of magnesium sulphates can correct this issue.|$|E

40|$|Many of {{hydroelectric}} <b>micro-plants,</b> {{useful for}} the electricity production at intricate regions, operate in autonomous regimen. Therefore, {{it is necessary to}} accomplish the control of frequency. One way to control the frequency is varying the power dissipated in ballast loads employing AC-AC converters. These converters consume reactive power, contributing to aggravate the power factor at the generator output. An alternative {{in order to avoid the}} deterioration of the power factor is the use of a bridge three-phase rectifier using diodes with a serial switch with the load that is switched with symmetric angle.

40|$|The <b>micro-plant</b> and {{reactive}} distillation concepts {{have been}} researched in this thesis. The {{aim of the}} project is to invent a technique {{for the production of}} pure 2 -methoxy- 2, 4, 4 -trimethylpentane (TOME). After the production, physical property of interest of the chemical compound would be determined. The first phase of this project relates to the production of TOME with the <b>micro-plant</b> constructed by Aalto University chemical engineering research group. In the second section, TOME was manufactured with reactive distillation principle. These two mechanisms were later compared, specifically for TOME production. Special interest has been focused towards 2 -methoxy- 2, 4, 4 -trimethylpentane for over a decade. 2 -methoxy- 2, 4, 4 -trimethylpentane has been recognised {{as one of the few}} chemical compounds that could be utilised as fuel additive (fuel oxygenate) in gasoline pool. However, production of the pure chemical is very demanding. In this thesis, all the obstacles encountered during production of this fuel oxygenate would be revealed. A range of separation principles have been implemented for the realisation of pure TOME. The time available for this project is very limited, notwithstanding density measurement of 2 -methoxy- 2, 4, 4 -trimethylpentane and 2, 4, 4 -trimethyl- 1 -pentene were conducted.

40|$|AbstractThe city {{is where}} {{important}} exchanges of resources occur, but where what is {{received from the}} environment differs greatly from what is returned to it. Energy, water, materials and food are received, yet other waste energy, wastewater, waste materials and organic waste are returned.

40|$|A recent {{switch in}} the study of the {{beginning}} of agriculture is to demonstrate the increasingly closer interaction between people and the landscape and how this would have played a crucial role in the transition to agriculture. Understanding the palaeo-ecology of the local environments at key sites and its relationship with subsistence strategies is critical to an improved appreciation of such interactions. This article examines macro- and <b>micro-plant</b> remains discovered at two important sites in North China, both dated to around 10, 000 cal. yr BP. These two sites, Zhuannian and Nanzhuangtou, are located on the terrace of the Bai River in the Yan Mountains and next to Baiyangdian Lake on the piedmont of the Taihang Mountains, respectively. The floral remains at these two sites provide a great opportunity to examine (1) post-Pleistocene subsistence strategies, (2) the increasing consumption of millets and grassy plants and its significance and (3) the intra-regional diversity in food exploitation and its relationships with local environments. While the macro-plant remains at Nanzhuangtou indicate the importance of aquatic plants in the palaeo-diet, those at Zhuannian suggest a tendency of exploiting tree plants. This significance of these diversified plant food exploitation strategies by the last hunter-gatherers should be paid more attention in future research. Our data also once again confirm the importance of millet consumption to these hunter-gatherers on the eve of millet domestication...|$|E

40|$|The {{substitution}} {{of fossil fuels}} by biofuels is being stimulated by governments because of the perspective of exhaustion of world oil reserves, in consequence of constant price rising and also because of environmental impacts. It is based on this perspective that this research work was realized, aiming to develop a search of information related to it, mainly exposing environmental, economical and social impacts of fossil fuels and biofuels that naturally are the substitutes of these. Through the research developed, it was noticed {{that there are many}} convergent information related to the positive side of substituting oil by biofuels, as also was detected a set of researches that show adverse information. These researches alert to a set of problems that must be solved before a total substitution aiming sustainability, such as: familiar agriculture incentive; delimitation of properties’ size; formation of cooperatives; creation of a national network of thousands of <b>micro-plants</b> integrated by cooperatives of small and medium rural producers; and so on...|$|R
40|$|By {{means of}} Swedish {{longitudinal}} micro-data, {{the aim of}} this paper is to analyse how regional economies respond to crises. This is made possible by linking gross employment flows to the notion of regional resilience. Our findings indicate that despite a steady national employment growth, only the three metropolitan regions have fully recovered from the recession of 1990. Further, we can show evidence of high levels of job creation and destruction in both declining and expanding regions and sectors, and that the creation of jobs is mainly attributable to employment growth in incumbent firms, while job destruction is primarily due to exits and <b>micro-plants.</b> Although the geography of resistance to crises and the ability of adaptability in the aftermath vary, our findings suggest that cohesive (i. e., with many skill-related industries) and diverse (i. e., with a high degree of unrelated variety) regions are more resilient over time. We also find that resistance to future shocks (e. g., the 2008 recession) is highly dependent on the resistance to previous crises. In all, this suggests that the long-term evolution of regional economies also influences their future resilience...|$|R
30|$|Sugarcane {{is one of}} the world’s largest crops (Tiwari and Nema 1999; Dotaniya and Datta 2014; Choudhary et al. 2016). It is {{cultivated}} {{on about}} 26.9 million hectares (M ha), in more than 109 countries, with a worldwide harvest of 1.91 billion tonnes (bt) (Factfish 2015). Sugarcane is a long-duration cash crop categorized under exhaustive crop (Paul et al. 2005). It requires larger amounts of macro- as well as <b>micro-plant</b> nutrients. It has been measured that sugarcane of 100  t that produced from 1  ha land removes 140, 34 and 332  kg NPK ha− 1, respectively, from soil (Bokhtiar et al. 2001). High requirement of plant nutrient limits the crop yield due to scarcity of fertilizers (Gholve et al. 2001). Similarly, spiralling prices coupled with a short availability of fertilizers in peak season (Khandagave 2003) cause depletion of plant nutrients from the soil (Kumar and Verma 2002; Ibrahim et al. 2008; Sarwar et al. 2008). Brazil is a large producer of sugarcane in the world. The next five major producers, in decreasing amounts of production, are India, China, Thailand, Pakistan, and Mexico (Sarwar et al. 2010). In 2013, about 1.91 billion tonnes of sugarcane was produced worldwide; its 50  % was produced by Brazil and India (Factfish 2015). More than 45  million sugarcane growers in India, and about 65  % of the rural population depend on this agro-based industry. These industries are struggling for energy with high cost of production. It needs lower cost input and use of by-products as a fertilizer (Dotaniya et al. 2015). The sugar industry is the second largest agricultural industry in the country after the textile industry. Its importance in day-to-day life adds its value. In this respect, it has the lot of importance in Indian agriculture. Maharashtra sugar industry {{is one of the}} most notable and large-scale sugar manufacturing sectors in the country. In India, between the sixth and fourth centuries BC, the Persians, followed by the Greeks, discovered the famous “reeds that produce honey without bees”. They adopted and then spread sugar and sugarcane agriculture (Mintz 1986). This crop grown like cotton and other crops at vast levels, during 19 th and 20 th century revolution, it had stands in front row of agricultural cash crops. The world demand for sugar is the primary driver of sugarcane agriculture. Sugarcane accounts for 80  % of sugar produced; the rest is made from sugar beets. New innovations and accelerated mechanization enhanced the sugarcane productivity in a quantum jump.|$|E
40|$|Naked, or hull-less, barley {{is gaining}} {{increased}} interest {{for human consumption}} because of its free-threshing habit (lowering processing costs and avoiding loss of bran during pearling) and higher f 3 -glucan (soluble fibre) content, implicated in lowering glycaemic index. The naked seed trait is coded by a single recessive gene, nud, where the palea and lemma do not adhere to the caryopsis. However, a persistent problem with naked barley is poor establishment in typical British cool, damp late winter sowing conditions. It was hypothesized that {{this was due to}} short coleoptile length in the few European varieties that possess the naked seed trait (most European barleys being hulled). However, the naked trait is widespread in those nations where barley forms a significant component of human diet such as Ethiopia and Central Asia, but where growing conditions are often harsh. Germination and establishment characteristics of several lines from these areas were tested in the field, cold room and glasshouse. Coleoptile length was found to vary significantly between genotypes and was correlated with successful establishment. However, many exotic genotypes have agronomic traits which are poorly adapted to British growing conditions, such as low disease resistance, unduly short or long duration, lax leaf habit and weak straw. The genotype with the longest coleoptile length, Tibet- 37, was crossed with Taiga, a cultivar from Germany which has a short coleoptile and poor field establishment. From this cross a mapping population was produced using the single seed descent method by uni-culm micro plant. 145 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) were produced from which 68 were black, 47 grey and 30 were white seeded. Among these black colour and grey colour lines were true hybrids. However, white testa lines were doubtful; their performance was similar to the Taiga parent. Coleoptile length was fOUnd to be heritable in the progeny. Using the rapid <b>micro-plant</b> technique, it was POssible to advance to the F 6 generation within two years. F 7 RILs were phenotyped in the glasshouse as a first stage in genetic mapping, and the F 8 RILs were field tested for coleoptile length and seedling emergence characteristics. Results show that coleoptile length is a continuously variable trait with Tibet- 37 and Taiga at the upper and lower ends of the range, respectively. CL showed significant correlation between field and cold room experiment. Seed colour was significantly associated with CL, EP and SE. The black testa colour RILs showed highest CL length hence, it is concluded that black seed colour might be linked with long coleoptile traits and a good morphological marker for coleoptile length and establishment in this population.

Furthermore, mineral nutrition {{plays an important role in}} the induction of organogenic responses. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of boron and calcium in the organogenesis of nodal segments from seedlings of Eucalyptus grandis growing under in vitro conditions. The concentration of boron and calcium in MS medium was modified to induce organogenic responses in 45 -day-old nodal segments used as explants. After 60 days, the fresh weight, dry weight, ratio of fresh and dry weight, relative water content and relative matter content accumulated by the explants were evaluated. The concentrations of boron and calcium in the culture medium influenced the in vitro organogenic control of Eucalyptus grandis. Reduced combinations of boron and calcium induced callus formation and dry matter accumulation in the explants.

Engineering technologies have helped biologists to explore the living organisms at cellular and molecular levels, and have created new opportunities to tackle the unsolved biological problems. There is now a growing demand to further expand the role of engineering in cellular biology research. For an engineer to play an effective role in cellular biology, the first essential step is to understand the cells and their components. However, the stumbling block of this step is to comprehend the information given in the cellular biology literature because it best suits the readers with a biological background. This paper aims to overcome this bottleneck by describing the human cell components as <b>micro-plants</b> that form cells as micro-bio-factories. This concept can accelerate the engineers&# 039; comprehension of the subject. In this paper, first the structure and function of different cell components are described.

These complex interactions are translated into simple flow diagrams, generally used by engineers to represent multi-component processe...|$|R
40|$|Open Access JournalTaro leaf blight {{disease has}} {{recently}} been reported in Cameroon to cause between 50 and 100 % yields loss of taro {{in most of the}} agro-ecological crop growing regions. This has led to a significant reduction in disease-free planting materials, edible crop and increased. The Meristem culture technique has been used to produce crop plants free of viruses and fungi especially in vegetative propagated colocassia plants. This aimed at applying in-vitro micro-propagation technique for sustainable production of four local taro cultivars in Cameroon. This study was conducted at the Root and Tuber Tissue Culture Laboratory, of the Institute of Agricultural Research for Development (IRAD), Bambui from April 2015 to November 2016. <b>Micro-plants</b> from four local taro cultivars were produced in vitro from apical meristem tips. The tip meristems were excised from corms of the four local taro cultivars. The excised explants were surface sterilized with alcohol and sodium hypochlorite in sequence steps at different concentrations. Meristems were cultured at establishment stage on Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium with 30 g of sugar, 1. 1 ml of 6 -benzylaminopurine and 7 g of agar. Shoots proliferation was induced in MS with 2. 2 ml of 6 -benzylaminopurine (BAP). Result shows a significant difference at p≤ 0. 5 in number of shoots, petiole length, open leaf and corm diameter among the cultivars and no significant variation in mean number of senescence leaf with respect to all the cultivars, at 60 days of shoot tip culture.

In a seedling bioassay, however, B. subtilis CL 27 had activity {{similar to a}} commercial fungicide while B. pumilus CL 45 failed completely to prevent seedling damping-off caused by Bot. cinerea. Antibiotic production by the two Bacillus strains was found {{to depend on the}} growth substrate and highest antibiotic production was found on media based on homogenized cabbage tissue. Antibiotic activity was found to depend on the pH and nutrient concentration in the assay medium. Antifungal antibiotics produced by B. subtilis CL 27 and B. pumilus CL 45 in different fermentation media were separated by thin layer chromatography. As suspected from the activity spectrum, three antibiotics (one with activity against Alternaria brassicicola, one with activity against Botrytis cinerea and one with activity against both fungi) could be detected in the fermentation broth of CL 27, but only one in the fermentation broth of CL 45. The two antibiotics produced by strain CL 27 with activity against A. brassicicola were identified as peptides since their bands on the TLC plates developed a green to blue/green colour after treatment with 4, 4 '-tetramethyldiamino-diphenylmethane (TDM) reagent. The third antibiotics produced by strain CL 27 and antibiotic produced by CL 45 had a similar Rf-value and appeared not to be peptides based on the reaction with TDM. However, they showed a slightly different activity spectrum when tested against a range of different fungi.

40|$|Population {{explosion}} {{is one of}} {{the primary}} causes for concern in the power sector nowadays because residential buildings consume a high percentage of available electricity in the market. Also, the majority of current power plants use fossil fuel to generate electricity which makes the situation even worse due to the high price of fossil fuel. Consequently, electricity bills have soared dramatically in the last decade. If that was not enough, many countries have a shortage of electricity because they cannot increase their generation capacity to cover electricity demand. Many solutions have been introduced to improve the efficiency of the power grid and reduce electricity price for the users. For instance, Demand Side Management and Demand Response, domestic top-roof renewable <b>micro-plants,</b> and distributed renewable plants are introduced {{as a part of the}} solution to improve the situation. However, users are still paying a high percentage of their monthly income to electricity companies, that is because the surplus renewable power is not well utilized. The primary problem here is to find an efficient way to minimize the electricity cost and maximize the utilization of renewable power without using storage systems (batteries). Another issue is to solve the massive power allocation optimization problem in polynomial time. In this thesis, heuristic optimization algorithms are proposed to cope with the complexity of the problem as these kinds of problems are NP-hard. Furthermore, a set of different power allocation problems has been addressed in this thesis. The first one uses an online algorithm to solve power allocation problem that is modeled as a Knapsack problem. Additionally, the thesis has coped with the computational issue of a massive LP-based optimization problem of large buildings. Finally, an MILP-based heuristic algorithm has been used to solve power allocation problem in micro-grids (a set of houses shares renewable power for particulate rate). The empirical experiments and evaluations, in general, show promising results. The findings depict how an appropriate knapsack formulation can be used to address a significant dynamic energy allocation problem in a straightforward and flexible way and how good our heuristic algorithms can solve enormous power optimization problem in polynomial time. Finally, the results prove that our micro-grid model can reduce power bills by using the principle of renewable power sharing for a fair price...|$|R
