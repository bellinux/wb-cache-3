25|$|Since I am anxious {{that you}} should all know {{something}} about <b>my</b> <b>trip</b> and {{the condition of the}} country as we find it in British East Africa, I am sending this general letter. I have had my first visit to a native village where goats, sheep and human beings occupy the same hut. The houses are built of bamboo and thatched with grass; the center or highest point is about ten feet, sloping to the outer edge until the door or hole to crawl through is about three feet high.... The chief occupation for the men is herding goats; the women do the gardening, wood chopping, carrying of heavy loads, etc. The women carried all our trunks and baggage from the depot up to the mission station, a distance of about three miles. It is considered a disgrace for a man to carry a load of wood, pail of water, etc.|$|E
2500|$|In {{spring of}} 1954, in New York City, {{just before his}} passing, Pascal had planned a trip to India to see Meher Baba one last time. He {{was having an affair}} and divorcing his wife at the time. One day he impulsively wrote on a piece of hotel {{stationery}} to his mistress, [...] "If I die on <b>my</b> <b>trip</b> to India I leave my entire estate to you." [...] He signed and dated it before two witnesses, a cook and a maid in the hotel who did not speak English but only Chinese. This was an absurd gesture since Pascal was totally in debt. Pascal had told his wife Valerie (Hídvéghy Valéria) that he would leave her millions.|$|E
2500|$|Visits {{from his}} mother to Likani were greatly enjoyable. In 1895, George and his mother visited Denmark. They had not seen their Danish {{relatives}} for four years. It was sad {{as it was the}} first time for both of them without the late Tsar. Then suddenly, his health deteriorated, [...] "Yesterday, in the garden, he expectorated some blood...that frightened me more than I can tell - the surprise of it was shocking, because he had been so well of late...I am quite desperate that this should have happened here" [...] As a result, George was forbidden to smoke and confined to bed until he was fit enough to return to Likani. Writing to Nicholas back home once again, George said about his trip to Denmark, [...] "Of course it was good to see the family after 4 years, but it did not really do me any good, as I lost more than 5 pounds which I had put on with such difficulty in May and June. I also get out of breath more easily. So these are the results of <b>my</b> <b>trip.</b> Very annoying." ...|$|E

30|$|This {{study is}} the result of a {{personal}} project conducted over six trips to southeast Anatolia between 2005 and 2011, each of which lasted for about 15 days. I changed the dates and periods of <b>my</b> <b>trips</b> to diversify the examples and places visited and to provide a resulting overview since an extensive single period of ethnographic research was not possible. Periods of Kurdish transhumance were given priority in planning the timing of <b>my</b> <b>trips.</b> This corresponds to the months of April and May. Then, I made a trip during a summer in July. The winter period still remains to be studied. Whenever possible, I devoted 24 h to each family of sheep herders that I met and kept in touch with them with the aim of meeting them again in the event of another trip, intending also to give them the photos that I had taken of them.|$|R
