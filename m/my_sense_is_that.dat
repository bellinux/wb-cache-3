40|$|On its face, the {{connection}} between insider trading regulation {{and the state of}} mind of the trader or tipper seems intuitive. Insider trading is a form of market abuse: taking advantage of a secret to which one is not entitled, generally in breach of some kind of fiduciary-like duty. This chapter examines both the legal doctrine and the psychology associated with this pursuit. There is much conceptual confusion in how we define unlawful insider trading—the quixotic effort to build a coherent theory of insider trading by reference to the law of fraud, rather than a more expansive market abuse standard—which leads to interesting psychological questions as to the required state of mind. Is it always simple greed? What if {{there is an element of}} unconscious misperception—or rationalization—at work? <b>My</b> <b>sense</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the causal explanations for what is charged as insider trading are sometimes quite murky and not easily explained as pure greed. The chapter thus tries to connect the law of insider trading to a more sophisticated approach to state of mind, motivation and causation...|$|E
40|$|The recent excellentessayby Robic (2010) awakened an old {{concern of}} mine {{regarding}} whether “sequences, ” be they protein or nucleic acid, have escaped {{the limits of}} their useful abstraction and acquired the status of a nonexistent physical reality. The original observation that formed the basis for this notion lies with the widespread belief that protein folding involves a change of dimensionality. <b>My</b> <b>sense</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the way that the central dogma is taught and the use of schematic diagrams to teach protein folding (e. g., Branden and Tooze, 1999, p. 3) combine to reinforce students ’ beliefs that protein folding involves a transforma-tion from the one-dimensional sequence space to the three-dimensional structure space. This erroneous belief is accen-tuated by classroom discussions about the folding problem, which are often initiated with a question about how amino acid sequence determines protein structure. I believe that students then come to visualize and conceptualize protein folding as the process through which a one-dimensional pro-tein sequence is transformed to a three-dimensional protein structure. When my students display this conception, I respond by asking questions such as “What is the dimensionality of what comes out of the ribosome? Does the dimensionality of an unfolded polypeptide chain differ from a folded protein? In terms of electrostatics, molecular dynamics, bond forma-tion, and solvent interactions, which is more complex—an unfolded or a folded protein? Is protein folding a chang...|$|E

The aim of this project is to study a robot that is able to navigate rough terrains. What is the best design for a moving robot? This problem is not easy; William Whittaker, a Dante II principal investigator, suggests: “One of the reasons we haven’t solved the best means of mobility is that there may be not one. Look at the diversity of the nature, from snake locomotion and insects to the bi-pedal type of motion humans use to get around. Those are not minor variations.

This work provides no easy answers for the uses of picture books but instead is a comprehensive examination of how picture books contribute to our understanding of pedagogy and philosophy.

While the authors advocate for the teaching methodology that is grounded in the work of Matthew Lipman and others involved in Philosophy for Children (P 4 C), the authors do not wish to only address this narrower audience. They are educators and philosophers who use P 4 C as a part of their teaching approaches. “Picturebooks and philosophy for children (P 4 C) provide a framework to support adults’ exploration with courage and confidence” (Haynes & Murris, 2012, p. 1).

My opening remarks for this panel are intended to be broad-based, covering a wide range of issues. Still, I {{will not be able to}} cover all topics and so I hope that we can have a vigorous question and answer session later, in which I will have a chance to address additional concerns about the status of the global economic recovery generally and U.

My remarks are divided into three parts. First I will comment on the strength of the global economy. Asia has been a leader in the worldwide recovery following the very large global shock of late 2008, and I expect that leadership to continue during the remainder of 2010 and into 2011 and beyond. Next, I will turn to the U. S. economy, which is also growing, although not as strongly as some parts of Asia. My expectation is that growth in the U. S. is likely to continue at the current pace, or perhaps slightly faster, during the remainder of 2010 and into 2011. Finally, I will turn to the ongoing sovereign debt turmoil in Europe and try to assess a few of the implications for the global economy. <b>My</b> <b>sense</b> <b>is</b> <b>that,</b> while the sovereign debt crisis in Europe is indeed a serious matter, the global recovery at this point looks very strong and seems unlikely to be derailed.

The second part deals with my sense that technological and scientific advances may make have a dramatic impact in altering the way cases, particularly criminal cases, are proved and evaluated in the future. For example, the development and proliferation of a new type of 2 ̆ 2 trace evidence 2 ̆ 2 - electronic 2 ̆ 2 trace evidence 2 ̆ 2 - is providing dispositive proof of a larger and larger group of cases. As jurors come to understand such dispositive proof exists in many cases, they are suggestions they may come to expect it in all, potentially changing how proof in criminal cases is evaluated.

I believe that we may be in a new constitutional order, different from the New Deal-Great Society constitutional order that existed from 1937 to sometime in the 1980 s. If so, {{those of us who have}} been teaching constitutional law for a long time may find ourselves in the position of law professors in 1938 and 1939, whose way of thinking about the Constitution was developed in the 1920 s: we are intimately familiar with a whole raft of cases that simply do not have much to do with the Constitution in this new constitutional order. A law professor who said in 1940 that the farm program at issue in Wickard v.

I sometimes have the same feeling about critical comments about the Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s recent work: the criticisms are that the Court 2 ̆ 7 s current actions are not what the Court would have done ten years ago, and that the Court 2 ̆ 7 s actions are inconsistent with the way most law professors have come to understand the Constitution.

In many ways this will positively influence my work at AU, resulting in shifts: •	From more talking to more listening •	From fear and judgment of others to acceptance of others •	From self-doubt to self-acceptance and increased clarity of action •	To an enhanced sense of personal accountability and responsibility at all levels Time will tell whether these shifts will make more more effective. <b>My</b> <b>sense</b> <b>is</b> already <b>that</b> they will, and, that I will experience less stress and be more present in general.

Along with theorists Griselda Pollock and Hillary Robinson, these philosophers might be seen, in this paper, as my cognitive ‘woman-to-woman genealogy’, intersecting with that of the artists and enabling the particular and motivated shape I give to the historical and current, ‘political’, significance of work. The artists might be seen as ‘making’ history in a quite literal sense: in the physical facture of a contemporary practice that looks back, beyond second wave feminism, to speak to a current audience. Encountering a generation prior to, and one younger than, my own and writing about their work I am ‘making’ history in the more conventional <b>sense.</b> <b>My</b> hope <b>is</b> <b>that</b> this cross generational segue between theory and practice will have resonance for the artists and for a wider audience and thus contribute to the unrolling debate <b>that</b> <b>is</b> ‘making’ history in a third sense - the next installment of the feminist project...|$|R
40|$|The role of {{standards}} as I {{see it is}} to promote decision making <b>that</b> <b>is</b> {{in the interest of}} the public. For instance, air pollution standards might limit the sulfur content of fuels burned within a city or country. Without these standards, some individuals may burn cheaper higher sulfur fuels using the reasoning that "the little bit of sulfur dioxide contributed by me can't hurt that much". However, if everyone uses the high sulfur fuels, the general health of the public may deteriorate. Hence, standards are enacted to prohibit this situation from occurring. Usually standards specify maximum or minimum limits in terms of either absolute amounts or flowrates. Examples of the former are limitations on heights of buildings and ability to withstand an earthquake of specified magnitude. Under the latter are the air pollution standards of "parts per million" and radiation dosages due to nuclear facilities. This short note attempts to support the contention <b>that</b> standards should <b>be</b> specified in light of (1) the public preferences and, (2) the alternatives available. The implications of any alternative must always have some degree of uncertainty, so in this <b>sense,</b> <b>my</b> contention <b>is</b> <b>that</b> standards should depend on preferences for and probabilities of the consequences of the available alternatives. This particular viewpoint will be explained in terms of a simple abstract example. The thoughts contained here are meant to illustrate some of the considerations and relationships <b>that</b> I feel <b>are</b> important in establishing standards. They are not meant as complete procedures for the process of setting standards...|$|R
