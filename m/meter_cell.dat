2500|$|In an El Nacional article sharing {{interviews}} with protesters who were arrested, individuals explained {{their experiences in}} jail. One protester explained how he was placed into a 3 by 2 <b>meter</b> <b>cell</b> with 30 other prisoners where the inmates had to defecate in a bag behind a single curtain. The protester continued explaining how prisoners dealt punishments toward one another and the punishment for [...] "guarimberos" [...] was to be tied and gagged, which would allegedly occur without intervention from the authorities. Other arrested protesters interviewed also explained their fears of being imprisoned with violent criminals.|$|E
50|$|Although {{promoted}} as a feature, center-weighted metering was originally {{a consequence of}} the <b>meter</b> <b>cell</b> reading from the focusing screen of SLR cameras. Light scatter from the focusing screen and proximity of the <b>meter</b> <b>cell</b> caused fall off at the edges.|$|E
5000|$|The Canon 7 was a {{rangefinder}} system camera {{produced by}} Canon Inc., the last {{compatible with the}} Leica M39 lens mount. It was introduced in September 1961, with an integrated Selenium <b>meter</b> <b>cell.</b> Further versions, branded Canon 7s and Canon 7s Type II (or Canon 7sZ), modified the design slightly by introducing a cadmium sulfide cell.|$|E
5000|$|Konica EE-Matic (1963) AE only, {{selenium}} <b>metering</b> <b>cell</b> (no battery). Also sold as Wards xp500/500a.|$|R
50|$|There {{were a few}} {{particularly}} sophisticated film SLRs {{including the}} Olympus OM-2, the Pentax LX, the Nikon F3, and the Minolta 9000, where <b>metering</b> <b>cells</b> located {{at the bottom of}} the mirror box were used for ambient light metering, depending on model either instead or in addition to <b>metering</b> <b>cells</b> in the roof of the camera. Depending on model, the light was reflected down there either by a secondary mirror behind the half-transparent main mirror, a special reflective coating of the first shutter curtain, the surface of the film itself, or combinations thereof. One of the advantages of this approach is that the measuring result requires no adjustments when changing focusing screens or viewfinders. Also, some of the cameras using this configuration (f.e. the Minolta 9000) are virtually immune against measurement errors caused by light reaching the <b>metering</b> <b>cells</b> at larger angles, for example with shift/tilt lenses.|$|R
50|$|The Canon Pellix is {{a manual}} focus camera {{released}} in 1965 {{that uses a}} semitransparent stationary reflex mirror behind which a <b>metering</b> <b>cell</b> is raised during the reading.|$|R
50|$|However, {{what makes}} the Pellix special, is that the TTL {{metering}} is accomplished using a stationary semitransparent pellicle reflex mirror instead of the traditional moving SLR mirror and placing a CdS <b>meter</b> <b>cell</b> behind it for the TTL exposure measurement. The cell, attached to an arm is swung {{up in front of}} the film gate using the stop down lever on the right-hand camera front, reading the light projected from the camera lens after passing through the semitransparent mirror. Very few alternative locations inside the camera were available for picking up light rays from the camera lens. The Topcon RE Super has its <b>meter</b> <b>cell</b> placed directly behind the reflex mirror into which a pattern of slits are cut to let the light though, while the Asahi Pentax Spotmatic has a pair of cells located either side of the finder window reading light off the focusing screen.|$|E
50|$|The first {{camera to}} employ the {{pellicle}} mirror as a beam splitter was the Canon Pellix, launched by Canon Camera Company Inc. Japan in 1965. The object was to accomplish exposure measurement through the lens (TTL), which was pioneered by Tokyo Kogaku KK, Japan in the 1963 Topcon RE Super. That employed a CdS <b>meter</b> <b>cell</b> placed behind the reflex mirror that had narrow slits cut into the surface to let the light reach the cell. Canon improved on the idea by making the mirror semi-translucent and fixed. The <b>meter</b> <b>cell</b> was swung into the light-path behind the mirror by operating a lever on the right-hand camera front for stopped down exposure reading, momentarily dimming the viewfinder. Two thirds of {{the light from the}} camera lens was let through the mirror, while the rest was reflected up to the viewfinder screen. The Pellix pellicle mirror was an ultra-thin (0.02 mm) Mylar film with a vapour deposited semi reflecting layer. Since there was no mirror blackout, the user could see the image at the moment of exposure.|$|E
50|$|A thumb-wheel on {{the camera}} {{controls}} the lens aperture, and the value is shown in a window {{on top of the}} centrally located <b>meter</b> <b>cell</b> (the Cyclops window). The aperture in the interchangeable automatic lens closes when the shutter release is depressed and reopens when the camera is wound on for the next exposure. Due to the limited meter range, not every camera setting combination is possible to accommodate on the Contarex I exposure meter.|$|E
50|$|<b>Metering</b> <b>cells</b> {{located at}} the bottom of the mirror box using light {{reflected}} off the film are also used in all film SLRs supporting the classical form of real-time TTL flash metering.|$|R
5000|$|Metering: TTL through {{combined}} ambient {{and flash}} <b>metering</b> <b>cells</b> {{located at the}} bottom of the mirror box (therefore, not influenced by the focusing screens used), center-weighted or spot-metering metering characteristics for ambient light, center-weighted for flash light ...|$|R
5000|$|The OM2S {{used the}} same <b>metering</b> <b>cell</b> for all {{operations}} and light for the preview reading {{was sent to the}} cell via a secondary mirror mounted behind the semi-opaque main mirror as in the OM3 and OM4 models.|$|R
50|$|The Contarex was {{the first}} 35mm SLR focal plane shutter camera {{providing}} direct meter coupling to the shutter-, aperture-, and film speed-settings; they are interconnected by cords. An aperture simulator for the exposure meter in the Cyclops window uses an iris {{in front of the}} selenium <b>meter</b> <b>cell.</b> The meter needle, to be aligned with an index triangle, is visible both in a top plate window and to the right in the viewfinder.|$|E
50|$|Konica's {{single lens reflex}} cameras pioneered auto-exposure in cameras with focal-plane {{shutters}} {{and fully}} interchangeable lenses. The Konica Autoreflex of 1965 used an external light <b>meter</b> <b>cell</b> to set the lens diaphragm automatically after the user selected a shutter speed. With the Autoreflex T of 1968, Konica improved this design into a through-the-lens meter, using the same automation system. (The user could also set the exposure manually on these cameras). Other camera makers eventually adopted auto-exposure as well, but Konica was the first.|$|E
50|$|A rotary dial {{selected}} the mode, changing between integrated & selective metering was effected {{by a small}} lens moving {{in front of the}} <b>meter</b> <b>cell</b> which was mounted in the camera base like previous models, but moved forward and angled towards the film plane. This was to allow the same cell to measure both selective and full field for which the secondary mirror was larger than earlier cameras. Selective metering measured from the central focussing area only, a circle about 7mm of the viewfinder image.|$|E
50|$|There is {{an ongoing}} {{question}} concerning which camera company was first with such innovations as the quick-return mirror, through-the-lens <b>metering,</b> <b>cells</b> in prism housings and the bayonet lens mount. Alpa was a contender for being first with each of these innovations and several others.|$|R
50|$|Japanese company Pentax was {{the first}} {{manufacturer}} to show an early prototype 35 mm behind-the-lens metering SLR camera, which was named the Pentax Spotmatic. The camera was shown at the 1960 photokina show. The first TTL light metering SLR was the 1963 Topcon RE Super, which had the CdS <b>metering</b> <b>cell</b> placed behind the reflex mirror.|$|R
50|$|The OM2S {{still made}} use of the direct off the film {{metering}} although the OM2S used a single <b>metering</b> <b>cell</b> {{in the base of}} the mirror box for all metering. On the earlier OM2n MD model series the dynamic metering was accomplished via two silicon blue cells mounted just behind the lens mount which were aimed at the first curtain/film surface. The meter needle for the viewfinder was driven by a cds cell mounted in the prism.|$|R

50|$|On December 17, 2014 Khaled was {{transferred}} to a maximum security prison (Scorpion Wing in Torah Prison) and held in solitary confinement for over nine months. Reports later revealed that Al-Qazzaz was held in solitary confinement in a two by two <b>meter</b> <b>cell</b> in one of Egypt’s most notorious prisons. Reports in international newspapers have shown the conditions of Al-Qazzaz’s confinement. The cell was reportedly overrun with insects, while Al-Qazzaz had no access to clean clothes, pen or paper, a way to tell time, or windows. As {{a result of the}} harsh conditions of his detainment, Al-Qazzaz’s health has greatly deteriorated, leaving him with spinal complications and at risk for paralysis.|$|E
50|$|As he grew older, Félix Gallardo {{complained that}} he lived in poor {{conditions}} while in jail. He says that he suffers from vertigo, deafness, loss of an eye, and blood circulation problems. He lives in a 2.40 x 4.40 <b>meter</b> <b>cell,</b> which he {{is not allowed to}} leave, even to the recreational area. In March 2013 Félix Gallardo started a legal process to continue his prison sentence at home when he reaches his 70th birthday on 8 January 2016. On 29 April 2014 a Mexican federal court denied Félix Gallardo's petition to be transferred from the maximum-security prison to a medium-security one. On 18 December 2014, federal authorities approved his request to transfer him to a medium-security prison in Guadalajara (State of Jalisco) due to his declining health conditions.|$|E
5000|$|Through-the-lens light {{metering}} is {{also known}} as [...] "behind-the-lens metering". In the SLR design scheme, there were various placements made for the <b>metering</b> <b>cells,</b> all of which used CdS (Cadmium sulfide) photocells. The cells were either located in the pentaprism housing, where they metered light transmitted through the focusing screen; underneath the reflex mirror glass itself, which was Topcon's design; or in front of the shutter mechanism, which was the design used by Canon with their Canon Pellix.|$|R
50|$|The study {{started the}} {{simulation}} run {{with an initial}} population of 10,000 alate aphids distributed across a grid of 25 <b>meter</b> <b>cells.</b> The simulation results showed {{that there were two}} major population peaks, the first in early autumn due to an influx of alate immigrants and the second due to lower temperatures later in the year and a lack of immigrants. Ultimately, it is the goal of the researchers to adapt this model to simulate broader ecosystems and animal types.|$|R
50|$|The Zorki 10 is a fixed-lens Zorki coupled {{rangefinder}} camera with an integrated light <b>meter.</b> Selenium <b>meter</b> <b>cells</b> surround the lens. This {{was the first}} fully automatic camera produced in the former Soviet Union, {{as well as the}} first to use ASA/DIN markings rather than the Soviet GOST numbers, however these ASA numbers were still mostly useless as they didn't match any known film speeds (some Zorki 10 cameras apparently had GOST numbers instead of ASA though, as it's shown in a Polish camera manual).|$|R
50|$|He {{served the}} first three weeks of his {{sentence}} in the Block H luxury wing of Cipinang jail, Jatinegara, East Jakarta, before being transferred to Nusa Kambangan Island prison off the southern coast of Central Java. His luxury 8 x 3 <b>meter</b> <b>cell</b> was carpeted and contained a sofa, a sideboard, a television, a refrigerator, cooking utensils, an air-conditioner, a water purifier, a laptop computer, and two mobile phones. He was often allowed to travel to Jakarta on the grounds of medical parole and was seen at an exclusive golf course. In April 2006 he was transferred back to Cipinang. His sentence was reduced to 10 years on appeal, and he was given conditional release on 30 October 2006. He spent a total of four years in detainment. Critics said Tommy was released solely because of his wealth and his family's enduring power.|$|E
50|$|Some common {{features}} of 35mm SLR photography were first {{seen on the}} Topcon RE Super. Among these is the through-the-lens exposure metering. This enabled improved exposure accuracy, especially in close-up macro photography using bellows or extension rings, and in telephotography with long lenses. In addition to this feature, the metering is at full aperture. For this purpose the RE-lensese have an aperture simulator that relays the preset aperture to the exposure meter at full aperture, retaining a bright viewfinder image while determining the correct exposure, avoiding the stop-down method. The meter also works independently of the pentaprism finder, which allows for different viewfinder configurations. The <b>meter</b> <b>cell</b> is actually incorporated in the camera's reflex finder mirror. This was accomplished by milling narrow slits in the mirror surface letting {{a fraction of the}} light through to the CdS cell placed just behind it.|$|E
50|$|Pentax was {{the first}} {{manufacturer}} to show an early prototype 35 mm behind-the-lens metering SLR camera, which was named the Pentax Spotmatic. The camera was shown at the 1960 photokina show. However, the first Through-the-lens (TTL) light metering SLR on the market was the 1963 Topcon RE Super, which had the CdS metering cell placed behind the reflex mirror. The mirror had narrow slits cut into the surface to let the light reach the cell providing average metering. Late in the following year, a production model of the Pentax Spotmatic was shown whose CdS light meter cells were on the pentaprism, reading the light off the focusing screen providing average reading, yet keeping the Spotmatic name, but now written in one word. Another clever design appeared in 1965, the Canon Pellix employing a pellicle mirror that is semi-transparent, placing the <b>meter</b> <b>cell</b> on an arm swinging into the lightpass behind the mirror for meter reading.|$|E
5000|$|The {{schematic}} {{shows the}} most common type of water brake, known as the [...] "variable level" [...] type. Water is added until the engine is held at a steady RPM against the load, with the water then kept at that level and replaced by constant draining and refilling (which is needed to carry away the heat created by absorbing the horsepower). The housing attempts to rotate in response to the torque produced, but is restrained by the scale or torque <b>metering</b> <b>cell</b> that measures the torque.|$|R
5000|$|Two {{built-in}} sensors {{are used}} to implement all these metering options. Center-weighted and partial area metering are performed by a double-area silicon photocell (SPC) in Canon's standard location above the eyepiece, while spot metering is performed by another SPC located {{at the bottom of}} the mirror box. Light reaches that sensor via a half-silvered area of the main mirror and a secondary mirror located beneath it. The spot <b>metering</b> <b>cell</b> also allows for automatic TTL [...] "off-the-film" [...] flash metering, again borrowed from Olympus.|$|R

They do not go out when during or after rainfall, or when rainfall is expected. They are to perform some physical exercise when outside.|$|E
40|$|In {{this work}} we {{describe}} how GRASS GIS resources {{have been developed}} and integrated for centralized data archiving and predictive modeling in several wildlife management tasks in Trentino, Italian Alps. In particular, we will present {{the development of a}} multiscale site characterization based on the integrated use of orthophoto landuse classification, morphometrical analysis of DEM (altitude, slope, aspect and curvatures) and the quantitative analysis of landscape structure at different scales. The methodology has been applied at a mesoscale (6200 Kmq, 30 Gb ortophoto at 1 <b>meter</b> <b>cell</b> resolution) for the predictive modelling of deer-vehicle collisions and for developing guidelines for the improvement of black grouse habitat improvement, two projects for the Wildlife Management Service of Trentino. We devised an environment of GRASS and R tools (modules and interface scripts) to automate the database preparation, including variables as distance from urban areas and from waters, wildlife population density map, vector line analysis (road curvatures). The data are managed by database tools (PostgreSQL), allowing the development of computationally intensive predictive models. We present variable importance analysis and classification with bagging of tree-based classification models...|$|E
30|$|The Mn/CS was {{prepared}} by impregnation method; this method {{has been used}} in fluidized, suspended and magnetic ion exchange forms [14, 15]. On this basis, the copper slags were placed in aqueous solution including Mn (NO 3) 2 (50 %W/V) for 24  h at 60  °C and stirring mixture. After separating the copper slag from this solution, samples were dried at 100  °C for 5  h [16]. Active copper slag and Mn/CS were analyzed by XRD, FTIR, FESEM, TG/DTA, XRF and EDX. In the oxidation process, a gas flow (contains 3000  ppm of SO 2 and 5 % of O 2 in N 2) was blown into 250  ml of deionized water in the semi-batch reactor (SBR) until getting a constant conductivity value of 570 µS/cm (corresponds to a HSO 3 − concentration of 1.65 [*]×[*] 10 − 3 M) [5]. The changes in the electrical conductivity of the solution were measured by the conductivity <b>meter</b> <b>cell</b> in the reactor.
