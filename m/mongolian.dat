5|$|In Inner Mongolia, {{official}} language policy divides the <b>Mongolian</b> language into three dialects: Southern <b>Mongolian,</b> Oirat, and Barghu-Buryat. Southern <b>Mongolian</b> {{is said to}} consist of Chakhar, Ordos, Baarin, Khorchin, Kharchin, and Alasha. The authorities have synthesized a literary standard for <b>Mongolian</b> in whose grammar {{is said to be}} based on Southern <b>Mongolian</b> and whose pronunciation is based on the Chakhar dialect as spoken in the Plain Blue Banner. Dialectologically, however, western Southern <b>Mongolian</b> dialects are closer to Khalkha than they are to eastern Southern <b>Mongolian</b> dialects: for example, Chakhar is closer to Khalkha than to Khorchin.|$|E
5|$|The next {{distinct}} {{period is}} Classical <b>Mongolian,</b> which is dated from the 17th to the 19th century. This is a written language {{with a high}} degree of standardization in orthography and syntax that sets it quite apart from the subsequent Modern <b>Mongolian.</b> The most notable documents in this language are the <b>Mongolian</b> Kangyur and Tengyur as well as several chronicles. In 1686, the Soyombo alphabet (Buddhist texts) was created, giving distinctive evidence on early classical <b>Mongolian</b> phonological peculiarities.|$|E

5|$|In Mongolia, the Khalkha dialect, {{written in}} Cyrillic (and {{at times in}} Latin for social networking), is predominant, while in Inner Mongolia, the {{language}} is dialectally more diverse and is written in the traditional <b>Mongolian</b> script. In the discussion of grammar to follow, the variety of <b>Mongolian</b> treated is Standard Khalkha <b>Mongolian</b> (i.e., the standard written language as formalized in the writing conventions and in the school grammar), but {{much of what is}} to be said is also valid for vernacular (spoken) Khalkha and for other <b>Mongolian</b> dialects, especially Chakhar.|$|E
5|$|In the People's Republic of China, <b>Mongolian</b> is a co-official {{language}} with Mandarin Chinese in some regions, notably the entire Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. The traditional alphabet {{has always been}} used there, although Cyrillic was considered briefly before the Sino-Soviet split. There {{are two types of}} written <b>Mongolian</b> used in China: the traditional <b>Mongolian</b> script, which is official among Mongols nationwide, and the Clear script, used predominantly among Oirats in Xinjiang.|$|E
5|$|<b>Mongolian</b> first adopted loanwords from Old Turkic, Sanskrit (these often through Uighur), Persian, Arabic, Tibetan, Tungusic, and Chinese. However, {{more recent}} loanwords come from Russian, English, and Mandarin Chinese (mainly in Inner Mongolia). Language {{commissions}} of the <b>Mongolian</b> state continuously translate new terminology into <b>Mongolian,</b> {{so as the}} <b>Mongolian</b> vocabulary now has jerönhijlögč 'president' ("generalizer") and šar ajrag 'beer' ("yellow kumys"). There are several loan translations, e.g., galt tereg 'train' ('fire-having cart') from Chinese huǒchē (火车, fire cart) 'train'. Other loan translations include mön chanar (essence) from Chinese shízhì (实质, true quality), khün am (population) from Chinese rénkǒu (人口, person mouth), erdene shish (corn, maize) from Chinese yùmǐ (玉米, jade rice) and bügd nairamdakh uls (republic) from Chinese gónghéguò (共和国, public collaboration nation).|$|E

30|$|Buriats {{differ from}} the Inner and Outer <b>Mongolians</b> not only linguistically, but also culturally, as their homelands are more forested and full of lakes, {{including}} Lake Baikal, the deepest freshwater lake in the world. Geography has made Buriat food and dress distinct from steppe and grassland Mongols. Russian influences have also impacted their language, diet, and livelihood (Humphrey 1996). Other Mongols may consider Buriats as “Russians;” while Buriats consider Outer <b>Mongolians</b> as the ‘pure, poor, wilder brothers’ (Graber 2012); likewise, many Outer Mongols and Buriats perceive Inner <b>Mongolians</b> as having assimilated and become “Chinese” (personal communication, November 2012).|$|R

5|$|Immediately {{after his}} {{retirement}} from sumo there was speculation that Asashōryū would switch to mixed martial arts, {{and he was}} reported to be forming an MMA camp for <b>Mongolian</b> athletes. However, instead he became a businessman. Asashōryū had held business interests in Mongolia whilst still active in sumo, launching the family holding company as early as 2003. Based in Ulanbaatar and investing exclusively inside Mongolia, the company has assets in banking, real estate and mining. In 2012, his wealth was estimated to be between US$50 and 75 million.

In more recent times, due to socio-political changes, <b>Mongolian</b> has loaned various words from English; some which have gradually evolved as official terms: menejment, computer, fail (file), marketing, kredit, onlain (online), mesej (message).

5|$|<b>Mongolian</b> {{belongs to}} the Mongolic languages. The {{delimitation}} of the <b>Mongolian</b> language within Mongolic is a much disputed theoretical problem, one whose resolution is impeded {{by the fact that}} existing data for the major varieties is not easily arrangeable according to a common set of linguistic criteria. Such data might account for the historical development of the <b>Mongolian</b> dialect continuum, as well as for its sociolinguistic qualities. Though phonological and lexical studies are comparatively well developed, the basis has yet to be laid for a comparative morphosyntactic study, for example between such highly diverse varieties as Khalkha and Khorchin.|$|E
