5|$|Wolves carry ectoparasites and endoparasites, with {{wolves in}} the former Soviet Union having been {{recorded}} to carry at least 50 species. Most of these parasites infect wolves without adverse effects, though the effects <b>may</b> <b>become</b> <b>more</b> serious in sick or malnourished specimens. Parasitic infection in wolves is of particular concern to people, as wolves can spread them to dogs, which in turn can carry the parasites to humans. In areas where wolves inhabit pastoral areas, the parasites can be spread to livestock.|$|E
5|$|Natural {{selection}} acts on the phenotype, or {{the observable}} characteristics of an organism, but the genetic (heritable) basis of any phenotype {{that gives a}} reproductive advantage <b>may</b> <b>become</b> <b>more</b> common in a population. Over time, this process can result in populations that specialise for particular ecological niches (microevolution) and may eventually result in speciation (the emergence of new species, macroevolution). In other words, natural selection is a key process {{in the evolution of}} a population. Natural selection can be contrasted with artificial selection, in which humans intentionally choose specific traits, whereas in natural selection there is no intentional choice.|$|E

5|$|The {{ranges of}} the American and Chinese {{alligator}} extend into regions that sometimes experience periods of frost in winter. Being ectothermic, the internal body temperature of crocodilians falls {{as the temperature}} drops, and they become sluggish. They <b>may</b> <b>become</b> <b>more</b> active on warm days, but do not usually feed at all during the winter. In cold weather, they remain submerged with their tails in deeper, less cold water and their nostrils just projecting through the surface. If ice forms on the water, they maintain ice-free breathing holes, {{and there have been}} occasions when their snouts have become frozen into the ice. Temperature sensing probes implanted in wild American alligators have found that their core body temperatures can descend to around , but as long as they remain able to breathe they show no ill effects when the weather warms up.|$|E

25|$|A study {{conducted}} on the Jaluit Atoll, Marshall Islands demonstrated that significant geomorphologic events such as storms (i.e. Typhoon Ophelia in 1958) tend to have larger impacts on reef islands than the smaller-scale effects of sea level rise. These effects include the immediate erosion and subsequent regrowth process that may vary in length from decades to centuries, even resulting in land areas larger than pre-storm values. With an expected rise in the frequency and intensity of storms, they <b>may</b> <b>become</b> <b>more</b> significant in determining island shape and size than sea level rise.|$|E
25|$|As ethanol yields improve or {{different}} feedstocks are introduced, ethanol production <b>may</b> <b>become</b> <b>more</b> economically feasible in the US. Currently, research on improving ethanol yields from each unit of corn is underway using biotechnology. Also, {{as long as}} oil prices remain high, the economical use of other feedstocks, such as cellulose, become viable. By-products such as straw or wood chips {{can be converted to}} ethanol. Fast growing species like switchgrass can be grown on land not suitable for other cash crops and yield high levels of ethanol per unit area.|$|E
25|$|Patients with {{pre-existing}} psychiatric disorders, {{will experience}} a worsening of their usual symptoms, as observed by several studies.

25|$|In {{diarrhea}} dominant IB is {{a common}} symptom of GSE, increased celiac disease-associated serum IgG was found in treated and untreated CD patients. The IgG was most common in untreated patients with more active DQ2 expression that dropped on GF diet. Some irritable bowel can {{be the result of}} other food intolerances, such as casein intolerance, lactose intolerance, or intolerances to non-dextrose sugars in other foods. It can also be result of overgrowth of yeast or bacteria as a result of excesses of unabsorbed nutrients. IB may not resolve on GF diet and <b>may</b> <b>become</b> <b>more</b> severe in rare cases because it may not have initially been directly linked to gluten consumption.|$|E
25|$|Biodiesel {{can be used}} in any {{diesel engine}} when mixed with mineral diesel. In some countries, {{manufacturers}} cover their diesel engines under warranty for B100 use, although Volkswagen of Germany, for example, asks drivers to check by telephone with the VW environmental services department before switching to B100. B100 <b>may</b> <b>become</b> <b>more</b> viscous at lower temperatures, depending on the feedstock used. In most cases, biodiesel is compatible with diesel engines from 1994 onwards, which use 'Viton' (by DuPont) synthetic rubber in their mechanical fuel injection systems. Note however, that no vehicles are certified for using pure biodiesel before 2014, as there was no emission control protocol available for biodiesel before this date.|$|E
25|$|Epithelial {{surfaces}} may sustain {{damage from}} radiation therapy. Depending {{on the area}} being treated, this may include the skin, oral mucosa, pharyngeal, bowel mucosa and ureter. The rates of onset of damage and recovery from it depend upon the turnover rate of epithelial cells. Typically the skin starts to become pink and sore several weeks into treatment. The reaction <b>may</b> <b>become</b> <b>more</b> severe during the treatment and {{for up to about}} one week following the end of radiation therapy, and the skin may break down. Although this moist desquamation is uncomfortable, recovery is usually quick. Skin reactions tend to be worse in areas where there are natural folds in the skin, such as underneath the female breast, behind the ear, and in the groin.|$|E

50|$|Yet, it <b>may</b> <b>become</b> even <b>more</b> terminologically complex; for, as Hahn and Kleinman indicate, {{there can}} also be cases where there are {{paradoxical}} nocebo outcomes from placebo rituals (e.g. the TGN1412 drug trial), as well as paradoxical placebo outcomes from nocebo rituals (see also unintended consequences).|$|R
25|$|Undernourishment is {{most often}} due to not enough {{high-quality}} food being available to eat. This is often related to high food prices and poverty. A lack of breastfeeding may contribute, as may a number of infectious diseases such as: gastroenteritis, pneumonia, malaria, and measles, which increase nutrient requirements. There are two main types of undernutrition: protein-energy malnutrition and dietary deficiencies. Protein-energy malnutrition has two severe forms: marasmus (a lack of protein and calories) and kwashiorkor (a lack of just protein). Common micronutrient deficiencies include: a lack of iron, iodine, and vitamin A. During pregnancy, due to the body's increased need, deficiencies <b>may</b> <b>become</b> <b>more</b> common. In some developing countries, overnutrition {{in the form of}} obesity is beginning to present within the same communities as undernutrition. Other causes of malnutrition include anorexia nervosa and bariatric surgery.|$|E
25|$|The {{emerging}} shoots may be erect or nodding, with erect or pendulous flowers, which <b>may</b> <b>become</b> <b>more</b> erect as {{the plant}} matures. The flowers themselves, {{in common with}} other members of the Ericaceae, have corollas that are generally bell- or cup-shaped, though the petals themselves may or may not be fused. However, the Monotropoideae lack the poricidal anthers that are characteristic of the majority of the Ericaceae. (The Pyroleae do have poricidal anthers, however.) Pollen grains are released as a monad, in contrast to the majority of the Ericaceae, which release pollen grains in tetrad groups. (The Pyroleae variously release pollen as monads, tetrads, or polyads.) Fruits are dry loculicidal dehiscent (or sometimes indehiscent) capsule or a berry. Seeds are highly reduced dust seeds. The shoot may or may not be persistent after seed dispersal.|$|E
25|$|Climate {{change could}} have {{significant}} impacts on water resources {{around the world}} because of the close connections between the climate and hydrological cycle. Rising temperatures will increase evaporation and lead to increases in precipitation, though there will be regional variations in rainfall. Both droughts and floods <b>may</b> <b>become</b> <b>more</b> frequent in different regions at different times, and dramatic changes in snowfall and snow melt are expected in mountainous areas. Higher temperatures will also affect water quality {{in ways that are}} not well understood. Possible impacts include increased eutrophication. Climate change could also mean an increase in demand for farm irrigation, garden sprinklers, and perhaps even swimming pools. There is now ample evidence that increased hydrologic variability and change in climate has and will continue have a profound impact on the water sector through the hydrologic cycle, water availability, water demand, and water allocation at the global, regional, basin, and local levels.|$|E
5|$|The oceans <b>may</b> have <b>become</b> <b>more</b> {{hospitable to}} life {{over the last}} 500million years and less {{vulnerable}} to mass extinctions: dissolved oxygen <b>became</b> <b>more</b> widespread and penetrated to greater depths; the development of life on land reduced the run-off of nutrients and hence the risk of eutrophication and anoxic events; marine ecosystems <b>became</b> <b>more</b> diversified so that food chains {{were less likely to}} be disrupted.|$|R
