50|$|There {{are four}} {{distinct}} surf breaks at Ho'okipa. Pavilions is the break furthest east, off the lookout parking. West from it, facing the main parking, is <b>Middles</b> <b>break.</b> Usually these are both left to surfers. The {{area between the}} two, which catches fewer breaking sets, is {{sometimes referred to as}} Girlie Bowl or Green Trees. Next further west, facing the lifeguard tower and the narrow sand beach launch, is H‘Poko or Point. It is the most popular break for windsurfing, and generally breaks as a right. With the prevailing trade wind direction being east to east-north-east, this is most frequently down-the-line sailing on starboard tack (wind from right when standing on the beach). Yet further west, past the rocky point, is Lanes, which generally breaks as a left. Under relatively rare conditions, known as Kona, the prevailing winds become southwest, and Lanes is ridden down-the-line on port tack(wind from left when standing on the beach). This only occurs a few days out of every year.|$|R

5000|$|Walker was {{profiled}} quite flatteringly in Jim Bouton's {{memoir of}} the 1969 season, Ball Four. In the book, Walker {{is seen as}} a knowledgeable manager who has good advice for his charges. Although many of the players complain that Walker talks too much, Bouton is careful to point out that Walker always makes a good point and has good advice. This is notable because Bouton was unafraid to show his earlier manager, Joe Schultz, in a much less flattering light. Bouton even tells a humorous story of how Walker himself would follow the advice he always gave when he played in an old timer's game. The players jokingly would yell tips that Walker always said, such as [...] "hit the ball up the middle." [...] Walker would then proceed to single up the <b>middle,</b> then <b>break</b> up the double play, prompting Astro third baseman Doug Rader to remark, [...] "Son of a bitch.
