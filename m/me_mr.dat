500|$|Wilson {{stated the}} name [...] "Mr. Lady" [...] {{came from a}} trip to Italy while on tour with Team Dresch: [...] "I saw a store called Mr. Baby, and it freaked me out. Then {{everyone}} started calling <b>me</b> <b>Mr.</b> Baby. Then I became Mr. Baby onstage. I had my own theme song and everything. I wore a little eyeliner mustache. From there it changed into Mr. Lady, which just seemed like a good name for a queer label." [...] It also related to Ladyman, Wilson's first solo LP, produced with the aid of Melissa York after they both left lesbian [...] "supergroup" [...] Team Dresch.|$|E
500|$|Como's [...] "Dream Along With Me" [...] {{became the}} show's opening theme song, [...] "Mr. C." [...] {{received}} {{the first of}} many [...] "stacks and stacks of letters" [...] requesting him to sing a specific song. It was also here where he began wearing his trademark cardigan sweaters. The [...] "Sing to <b>me,</b> <b>Mr.</b> C." [...] segment of the Como shows with Perry seated on a stool singing viewer requested songs had its roots in the first television broadcasts of Chesterfield Supper Club. When cameras entered the [...] "Supper Club" [...] radio studio, they found Como and his guests sitting on stools behind music stands. The show's closing theme was, [...] "You Are Never Far Away From Me".|$|E
500|$|A melancholy love song, its lyrics {{depict a}} woman torn between love and ambition. [...] "West Coast" [...] {{also serves as}} a {{dedication}} to Del Rey's California hometown, and elicits imagery from its titular location. In the song, she sings about leaving a lover for the Californian promise of fame, and emphasizes on a gulf between a sweetly uncomplicated romance and a boozily dysfunctional relationship. Similarly to her previous works, the lyrics are both specific and vague, and complement the track's [...] "dreamlike" [...] sonics. [...] "West Coast" [...] sets up a disunity between form and content, and though a love song, its sound is more reminiscent to that of a breakup song. It was also noted that the lyrics depict a vivid picture of teenage summer memories and forgotten romance. Comparing the track's lyrical content to that of Sonic Youth's [...] "Superstar" [...] (1994), Grantland's Molly Lambert analyzed: [...] "While Born to Die–era Lana often displayed a preening 'please notice <b>me,</b> <b>Mr.</b> Producer!' energy, the Lana of 'West Coast' sounds like a starlet struggling not to become disaffected with show business after feeling her way through a few too many casting-couch sessions, still hoping that big break might be on the horizon." ...|$|E

500|$|Between {{the first}} and second season of {{promenade}} concerts, Wood did his last work in the opera house, conducting Stanford's new opera Shamus O'Brien at the Opera Comique. It ran from March until July 1896, leaving Wood enough time to prepare the second Queen's Hall season, which began at the end of August. The season was so successful that Newman followed it with a winter season of Saturday night promenade concerts, but despite being popular they were not a financial success, and were not repeated in later years. [...] In January 1897 Wood took on the direction of the Queen's Hall's prestigious Saturday afternoon symphony concerts. He continually presented new works by composers of many nationalities, and was particularly known for his skill in Russian music. Sullivan wrote to him in 1898, [...] "I have never heard a finer performance in England than that of the Tchaikovsky symphony under your direction last Wednesday". Seventy-five years later, Sir Adrian Boult ranked Wood as one of the two greatest Tchaikovsky conductors in his long experience. Wood also successfully challenged the widespread belief that Englishmen were not capable of conducting Wagner. When Wood and the Queen's Hall Orchestra performed at Windsor Castle in November 1898, Queen Victoria chose Tchaikovsky and Wagner for the programme. Wood, who modelled his appearance on Nikisch, took it as a compliment that the queen said to him, [...] "Tell <b>me,</b> <b>Mr</b> Wood, are you quite English?" ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1977, Năstase {{finished}} no. 9 in the ATP rankings. He was a quarterfinalist at the French Open and at Wimbledon (losing to Borg), {{and participated}} in the WCT Finals. It was during his quarterfinal match at Wimbledon that Năstase had a memorable row with umpire Jeremy Shales. Shales called him [...] "Năstase" [...] when asking him {{to move to the}} advantage court, [...] "like a master speaks to a naughty schoolboy." [...] (Năstase has also said Shales asked him to pick up a piece of paper that had blown onto the court, saying, [...] "Năstase, pick up that paper.") Năstase angrily replied, [...] "You call <b>me</b> <b>Mr.</b> Năstase!". Since this incident umpires have always used a courtesy title when addressing the players directly. Mr. Nastase later became the title of his autobiography.|$|E

2500|$|On July 2, 1921, Masterson {{attended}} {{his last}} heavyweight championship fight, the so-called [...] "Million Dollar Gate", promoted by Tex Rickard, in which Jack Dempsey defended (and retained) his title of heavyweight {{champion of the}} World. Three months later on October 7, silent-screen cowboy star William S. Hart (1864-1946) visited Masterson. They were photographed standing together {{on the roof of the}} New York Morning Telegraph building and went back to Masterson's office where he asked Hart to sit in his chair and pose for a second photo with him. According to Hart: [...] "I did so, and he stood beside <b>me.</b> <b>Mr.</b> Masterson was sitting in that same chair eighteen days later when he heard the last call." [...] Hart subsequently cast a Masterson lookalike as Masterson in his biographical film Wild Bill Hickok, which was released in 1923.|$|E
2500|$|Above all else, Asquith {{thrived on}} company and conversation. A clubbable man, he enjoyed [...] "the {{companionship}} of clever and attractive women" [...] even more. Throughout his life, Asquith had {{a circle of}} close female friends, which Margot termed his [...] "harem". In 1912, one of these, Venetia Stanley became much closer. Meeting first in 1909–1910, by 1912 she was Asquith's constant correspondent and companion. Between that point and 1915, he wrote her some 560 letters, {{at a rate of}} up to four a day. Although it remains uncertain {{whether or not they were}} lovers, she became of central importance to him. Asquith's thorough enjoyment of [...] "comfort and luxury" [...] during peacetime, and his unwillingness to adjust his behaviour during conflict, ultimately contributed to the impression of a man out of touch. Lady Tree's teasing question, asked at the height of the conflict; [...] "Tell <b>me,</b> <b>Mr</b> Asquith, do you take an interest in the war;" [...] conveyed a commonly held view.|$|E
2500|$|The One People's Project {{claims that}} MacDonald has {{promoted}} anti-Semitic propaganda {{under the guise}} of what he says is a legitimate and academic search for truth. He has been accused of misrepresenting the sources he uses in that regard. For example, Barry Mehler, an educator at Ferris State University, noted that MacDonald had claimed that [...] "Jewish opposition to the 1921 and 1924 legislation (to limit immigration) was motivated less by a desire for higher levels of Jewish immigration than by opposition to the implicit theory that America should be dominated by individuals with northern and western European ancestry." [...] MacDonald based this on a dissertation entitled “American Jewry and United States immigration policy, 1881–1953” by Sheldon Morris Neuringer. Nueringer’s thesis posited that Jewish opposition in 1921 and 1924 to the anti-immigration legislation at the time was due more to it having the [...] "taint of discrimination and anti-Semitism" [...] as opposed to how it would limit Jewish immigration. Mehler stated [...] "It seems to <b>me</b> <b>Mr.</b> MacDonald is misrepresenting Mr. Neuringer in this case and I posted my query hoping that a historian familiar with the literature might have a judgment on MacDonald's use of the historical data."' ...|$|E

2500|$|On 26 May 1971 Qantas {{received}} a call from a [...] "Mr.Brown" [...] claiming that there was a bomb planted on a Hong Kong-bound jet and demanding $500,000 in unmarked $20notes. He was treated seriously when he directed police to an airport locker where a functional bomb was found. Arrangements were made to pick up the money in front of the head office of the airline {{in the heart of the}} Sydney business district. Qantas paid the money and it was collected, after which Mr.Brown called again, advising the [...] "bomb on the plane" [...] story was a hoax. The initial pursuit of the perpetrator was bungled by the New South Wales Police Force who, despite having been advised of the matter from the time of the first call, failed to establish adequate surveillance of the pick-up of the money. Directed not to use their radios (for fear of being [...] "overheard"), the police were unable to communicate adequately. Tipped off by a still-unidentified informer, the police arrested an Englishman, Peter Macari, finding more than $138,000 hidden in an Annandale property. Convicted and sentenced to 15years in prison, Macari served nine years before being deported to Britain. Over $224,000 has still not been found. The 1990 telemovie Call <b>Me</b> <b>Mr.</b> Brown, directed by Scott Hicks and produced by Terry Jennings, relates to this incident. On 4 July 1997 a copycat extortion attempt was thwarted by police and Qantas security staff.|$|E
