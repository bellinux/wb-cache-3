5|$|Areas annexed by France {{during the}} Napoleonic era {{were the first}} to inherit the metric system. In 1812, Napoleon {{introduced}} a system known as <b>mesures</b> usuelles, which used the names of pre-metric units of measure, but defined them in terms of metric units – for example, the livre metrique (metric pound) was 500g and the toise metrique (metric fathom) was 2metres. After the Congress of Vienna in 1815, France lost the territories that she had annexed; some, such as the Papal States reverted to their pre-revolutionary units of measure, others such as Baden adopted {{a modified version of the}} <b>mesures</b> usuelles, but France kept her system of measurement intact.|$|E
5|$|Bureau {{international}} des poids et <b>mesures</b> (BIPM or International Bureau of Weights and Measures), {{a permanent}} laboratory and world centre of scientific metrology, {{the activities of}} which include {{the establishment of the}} basic standards and scales of the principal physical quantities, maintenance of the international prototype standards and oversight of regular comparisons between the international prototype and the various national standards.|$|E
5|$|International Bureau of Weights and Measures (Bureau {{international}} des poids et <b>mesures</b> or BIPM) – {{an international}} metrology centre at Sèvres in France that has {{custody of the}} International prototype kilogram, provides metrology services for the CGPM and CIPM, houses the secretariat for these organisations and hosts their formal meetings. Initially its prime metrological purpose was a periodic recalibration of national prototype metres and kilograms against the international prototype.|$|E

5|$|Louis Philippe I {{by means}} of the La loi du 4 juillet 1837 (the law of 4 July 1837) {{effectively}} revoked the use of <b>mesures</b> uselles by reaffirming the laws of measurement of 1795 and 1799 to be used from 1 May 1840. However, many units of measure, such as the livre (for half a kilogram), remained in colloquial use for many years, and to a residual extent up to this day.|$|E
5|$|Until 1875, the French {{government}} {{owned the}} prototype metre and kilogram, {{but in that}} year the Convention of the metre was signed, {{and control of the}} standards relating to mass and length passed to a trio of inter-governmental organisations, the senior of which was the General Conference on Weights and Measures (in French the Conférence générale des poids et <b>mesures</b> or CGPM). During {{the first half of the}} 20th century, the CGPM cooperated with a number of other organisations, and by 1960 it had responsibility for defining temporal, electrical, thermal, molecular and luminar measurements, while other international organisations continued their roles in how these units of measurement were used.|$|E
5|$|The {{official}} {{introduction of}} the metric system in September 1799 was unpopular in large sections of French society. Napoleon's rule greatly aided adoption of the new standard not only across France but also across the French sphere of influence. Napoleon took a retrograde step in 1812 when he passed legislation to introduce the <b>mesures</b> usuelles (traditional units of measurement) for retail trade—a system of measure that resembled the pre-revolutionary units but {{were based on the}} kilogram and the metre; for example the livre metrique (metric pound) was 500g instead of 489.5 g—the value of the livre du roi (the king's pound). Other units of measure were rounded in a similar manner prior to the definitive {{introduction of the}} metric system across parts of Europe {{in the middle of the}} 19th century.|$|E

The resignation also came at a difficult time for Berlusconi, as he was involved in numerous trials for corruption, fraud and sex offences. He was often found guilty in lower courts but used loopholes in Italy's legal system to evade incarceration.|$|E
25|$|Lagrange was {{considerably}} {{involved in the}} process of making new standard units of measurement in the 1790s. He was offered the presidency of the Commission for the reform of weights and measures (la Commission des Poids et <b>Mesures)</b> when he was preparing to escape. And after Lavoisier's death in 1794, it was largely owing to Lagrange's influence that the final choice of the unit system of metre and kilogram was settled and the decimal subdivision was finally accepted by the commission of 1799. Lagrange {{was also one of the}} founding members of the Bureau des Longitudes in 1795.|$|E

Under the Royal decree of 27 March 1817 (Koningklijk besluit van den 27 Maart 1817), the newly formed Kingdom of the Netherlands {{abandoned}} the <b>mesures</b> usuelles in favour of the [...] "Dutch" [...] metric system (Nederlands metrisch stelsel) in which metric units were given the names of units of measure that were then in use. Examples include the ons (ounce) which was defined as being 100g.|$|E

500|$|Napoleon himself {{ridiculed}} {{the metric}} system, {{but as an}} able administrator, recognised {{the value of a}} sound basis for a system of measurement and under the décret impérial du 12 février 1812 (imperial decree of 12 February 1812), a new system of measure – the <b>mesures</b> usuelles or [...] "customary measures" [...] was introduced for use in small retail businesses – all government, legal and similar works still had to use the metric system and the metric system continued to be taught at all levels of education. The names of many units used during the ancient regime were reintroduced, but were redefined in terms of metric units. Thus the toise was defined as being two metres with six pied making up one toise, twelve pouce making up one pied and twelve lignes making up one pouce. Likewise the livre was defined as being 500g, each livre comprising sixteen once and each once eight gros and the aune as 120 centimetres.|$|E
