40|$|Summary. We {{propose a}} new design of PDMS fluidic <b>microvalves</b> based on {{bistable}} configurations of the intra-channel thin membranes. 1 PDMS MICROVALVES Soft Lithography is a microfabrication technique based on replication molding, i. e. an elastomer (PDMS) is patterned by curing in a micromachined mold. In particular, Mul-tilayer Soft Lithography (MSL) consists in bonding multiple patterned elastomer layers together 1. The resulting monolithic microstructure precludes interlayer adhesion and ther-mal stress problems. The softness of the material, which requires small actuation forces, makes MSL devices suitable for passive-sensing and active micromechanical systems in general. A two-layer crossed-channel architecture {{is used to}} fabricate on-off <b>microvalves</b> and peristaltic micropumps, where the fluidic pressure {{plays the role of}} activation agent. The performance of such <b>microvalves</b> is strongly related to the two-channel geometry (width, height, and sectional shape) and to the interlayer membrane thickness. In order to define new geometries and new activation procedures, we make recourse to numerical simulations. We built a finite element model which allows to obtain a complet...|$|R

40|$|Microvalves play an {{important}} role in fluid control in micro total analysis systems (µTAS). Previous studies have reported complex fabrication processes for making <b>microvalve</b> elements in a channel. Hence, there is a need for a simpler <b>microvalve</b> fabrication method for achieving throughput improvement and cost reduction in µTAS. In this study, we propose a simple fabrication method for a magnetically driven <b>microvalve</b> array using a photosensitive composite. The composite was prepared by mixing a photoresist and magnetic particles of pure iron. The simple fabrication process was performed by using a laminating layer composed of a sacrificial part and the composite in a channel. The <b>microvalve</b> elements were fabricated by one-step photolithography using the processability of the sacrificial layer and composite. Further, we demonstrated the magnetic driving property of the fabricated <b>microvalve</b> array device. Compared to devices containing non-driving microvalves, the flow rate was decreased by 50 %, and the pressure difference between the inlet and outlet increased by up to 4 kPa with increase in driving <b>microvalve</b> elements.

40|$|Microvalves are {{commonly}} used in microfluidic systems to control precisely the liquid flow. In this paper, the design and fabrication of a normally-closed (NC) all-polymer membrane-type <b>microvalve</b> is described. The <b>microvalve</b> with a diameter and thickness of 5 mm and 3 mm, respectively, is fabricated completely in biocompatible polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). The opening pressure, which depends on the adhesion between the membrane and the slab, is reduced to the noticeably low value of 3. 4 kPa by the surface oxidation of the PDMS layers. This technique in combination with a selective bonding by Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) shadow masking allows for the fabrication of a high reverse pressure <b>microvalve</b> (no flow up to 0. 6 MPa reverse pressure).

The Pt electrode is covered with a hydrophobic self-assembled monolayer (SAM) that stops solution flow in the solution microchannel, hence is normally-closed. The <b>microvalve</b> is opened by introducing an electrolyte into the control microchannel, which oxidizes the Zn layer of the Zn/Pt electrode and forces a negative mixed potential of the entire electrode.
