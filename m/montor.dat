The depth of the earthquake was between 4 and 4. 6 km. The resulting signal at the distance considered was almost entirely body-wave components and had little or no contribution from the surface wave. The motion from the relatively shallower weapons tests had a signal with a pronounced surface-wave component. Comparison of the Pseudo Relative Response Velocity (PSRV) plots shows the earthquake signal richer in high frequencies and the weapons-test signals richer in low frequencies. If relationship between ground motion from the two sources can be confirmed for other earthquakes, weapons test ground motion could be used to estimate earthquake ground motion for magnitudes for which probability of occurrence in a given <b>montoring</b> period would be very small...|$|R

40|$|The {{development}} of molecular techniques for genome studies {{has led to}} qualitative progress {{in the selection of}} domestic animals by enabling the use of genetic markers, in addition to phenotypic selection parameters in choosing an animal. Genetic <b>montoring</b> has a wide application in contemporary swine production. Namely, genetic control is in the basis of all procedures pertaining to the selection of parent couples. Genetic monitoring is thus used in the genetic characterization of breeds, lines (evaluation of genetic drift and calculation of genetic distance), identification of transgenic animals (gene introduction), identification and control of origin of an animal. An especially important quality of genetic monitoring is the possibility to use genetic markers in the prenatal test of an animal. The project to map swine genomes has already resulted in the identification of several genes which are significant for resistance to causes of certain diseases (F 18 + E. coli resistent), stress, as well as genes significant for economically important characteristics (RN), which are used as commercial tests in genetic monitoring of swine...|$|R
40|$|Reproductive {{performances}} of 541 hares {{in the first}} year of production and intensively bred in four different farms were <b>montored</b> for three years. Results showed that the {{performances of}} the young reproducers were not influenced by the day of the birth till July. On the contrary, the hares born in August were less fertile than the earlier born (14 fertile hares on 28 hares born in August vs 345 on 513 hares, born in the earlier months). The number of weaned hares produced per fertile doe was also reduced (4. 43 young hares per doe born in August vs 7 young hares per doe born in the earlier months). Authors conclude that no reductionof performance is linked to the selection of the doe born in the middle of the reproductive cycle. The reduction of fertility observed in the last born doe is probably more linked tothe hot temperature of this period than the earlier age of the doe at the first delivery while the reduction of the number of weaned hares per doe per year is mainly related to the younger age...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT] Since 1978, China {{land use}} mapping has been started, {{the scale of}} the map is 1 : 1000000. The work lasted more than 10 years. From 1980, a {{national}} project of land use survey in China has been implemented by using aerial photography at large scale in the county and province level. So far this project has not been completedyet. In order to study the land use change in period of 2 - 3 years, a project concerning the land use study has been conducted since 1992 by using Landsat TM acquired around 1990 and the mapping scale in east China and in west China are 1 : 250, 000 and 1 : 500, 000 separatly. After digitizing the land use maps, a land use data base for the whole territory will be established in 1995.

40|$|Abstract – Determination of {{the spatial}} extent of {{peatland}} {{is important for}} the evaluation of soil carbon stocks. At European Level {{there is a need to}} provide accurate and updated estimate of the distribution of peatland. Comparison of national data with EU wide land cover mapping shows that there is limited compatibility between the different data sets. The aim of the present study is to test a methodology of standardized mapping and monitoring of peatlands at regional level (national to supra-national bio-climatic regions) based on the enhanced integration of existing thematic maps through GIS analysis in combination with remote sensing, using Estonia as study case. Existing national maps and field inventory of Estonian peatlands have been used for a GIS based evaluation of peatland relevant information contained in Corine Land Cover. Remote sensing has been employed in 2 ways: a multispectral approach using Landsat TM and a phenology oriented time series analysis of SPOT VEGETATION NDVI both implemented for the entire territory of Estonia. The remote sensing results are evaluated against the existing high resolution Estonian map of peatlands. In the case study it could be shown that peatlands are both spectrally and phenologically clearly distinct from other land cover types and therefore have a good potential to allow semiautomated mapping over large areas with relatively high accuracy, which lays the basis for efficient <b>montoring</b> and mapping of peatland change...|$|R
40|$|This {{software}} tool locates and computes {{the intensity of}} radiation skin dose resulting from fluoroscopically guided interventional procedures. It is comprised of multiple modules. Using standardized body specific geometric values, a software module defines a set {{of male and female}} patients arbitarily positioned on a fluoroscopy table. Simulated X-ray angiographic (XA) equipment includes XRII and digital detectors with or without bi-plane configurations and left and right facing tables. Skin dose estimates are localized by computing the exposure to each 0. 01 × 0. 01 m 2 on the surface of a patient irradiated by the X-ray beam. Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) Structured Report Dose data sent to a modular dosimetry database automatically extracts the 11 XA tags necessary for peak skin dose computation. Skin dose calculation software uses these tags (gantry angles, air kerma at the patient entrance reference point, etc.) and applies appropriate corrections of exposure and beam location based on each irradiation event (fluoroscopy and acquis-tions). A physicist screen records the initial validation of the accuracy, patient and equipment geometry, DICOM compliance, exposure output calibration, backscatter factor, and table and pad attenuation once per system. A technologist screen specifies patient positioning, patient height and weight, and physician user. Peak skin dose is computed and localized; additionally, fluoro-scopy duration and kerma area product values are electronically recorded and sent to the XA database. This approach fully addresses current limitations in meeting accreditation criteria, eliminates the need for paper logs at a XA console, and provides a method where automated ALARA <b>montoring</b> is possible includ-ing email and pager alerts.

40|$|Regulatory T-cells play {{a pivotal}} role in {{autoimmune}} diseases, cancer, viral infections and within transplant rejections. So far, these cells have been characterized by CD 25 (the alpha-chain of the interleukin 2 receptor) and the transcription factor Foxp 3. In human cells, however, FOXP 3 {{does not seem to be}} a specific marker as results of transient FOXP 3 epression and the existence of FOXP 3 + T cells without suppressive capacity have shown. But as results in murine cells have proven, FOXP 3 does seem to play an important role within the homeostasis of regulatory T-cells and therefore the search for regulating mechanisms of this factors has been intensified. Here, I compared the DNA methylation status of the Treg-specific-demethylation-region (TSDR) within the foxp 3 gene with the FOXP 3 expression of stimulated naive T-cells. The goal was to see, in how far changes within the FOXP 3 expression on the protein level correlate with changes on the epigenetic level as the results of the DNA methylation status might show. Furthermore I wanted to see whether FOXP 3 -expressing T-cells could be distinguished by the DNA methylation status. The results show that, although a high FOXP 3 expression was seen in anti-CD 3 /anti-CD 28 beads stimulated T cells (and additionally with or without TGF-beta), there were no changes of the DNA methylation status within the foxp 3 gene measured. Only the regulatory T cells did show a distinct DNA methylation pattern (demethylation) within the foxp 3 gene. Therefore, this method could be used to distinguish FOXP 3 expressing human T cells and and shows more specificity for regulatory T cells than the single use of transcription factor FOXP 3. Concluding, this method of analysing the DNA methylation status of FOXP 3 expressing T cells shows great potential in diagnotics and <b>montoring</b> of autoimmune diseases as well as therapeutic possibilities in fighting cancer, viral infections, transplant rejections and autoimmune diseases...|$|R
