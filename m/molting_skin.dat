50|$|Brown anoles molt {{in small}} pieces, unlike some other reptiles, which molt in one large piece. Anoles may consume the <b>molted</b> <b>skin</b> to {{replenish}} supplies of calcium. In captivity, the <b>molted</b> <b>skin</b> may {{stick to the}} anole if humidity is too low. The unshed layer of skin can build up around the eyes, preventing the lizard from feeding and may lead to starvation. This can be prevented by maintaining high humidity.|$|R
50|$|Brown anoles feed {{on small}} {{arthropods}} such as crickets, moths, ants, grasshoppers, cockroaches, mealworms, spiders, and waxworms.They may also eat other lizards, {{such as the}} green anole, lizard eggs, and their own <b>molted</b> <b>skin</b> and detached tails. If near water, they eat aquatic arthropods or small fish - nearly anything that will fit in their mouths.|$|R
50|$|Atlantic blue tangs act as {{cleaners}} by grazing algae {{as well as}} eating <b>molted</b> <b>skin</b> and parasites off of the client's flesh {{once the}} client comes to the cleaning station. The most common client in these interactions is the green turtle, in which the blue tang inspects the green turtle by nipping its head, limbs, tail, and carapace.|$|R
25|$|At {{the start}} of the film, the Predalien is shown <b>molting</b> its <b>skin,</b> as normal Xenomorphs do when they grow to full size {{elsewhere}} in the Alien franchise.|$|R
2500|$|When a chestburster erupts {{from the}} body of its host, it is less than [...] tall. However, it soon {{undergoes}} a dramatic growth spurt, reaching adult size in a matter of hours; in Alien, the chestburster had grown to [...] in height by the time the Nostromo crew located it again. The chestburster is shown to have molted before reaching maturity. In Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem, Alien warriors are shown who are still growing, showing shedding skin. In the unrated cut, the Predalien is shown wiping off its final <b>molted</b> <b>skin</b> at the film's start.|$|R
40|$|In the 06. April- 21. May {{period of}} the year 2006, we had {{analyzed}} the trophic spectrum of a total number of 98 common from a pools, near the locality of Cermei, Teuz Valley, Arad county, Romania. We extracted a total number of 615 prey items. The prey items were determined as belonging to 18 categories. Beside invertebrate preys, remaining of <b>molted</b> <b>skin</b> and plant material were identified in the stomach contents. Regarding the feeding intensity, we found only in in the last study period 3. 22 % empty stomachs. The most important prey taxa are: Isopoda, Cladocera, Nematocera larvae, Gastropoda, Gamarida, Ostracoda. The recorded food diversity was high on the entire {{period of the}} stud...|$|R
50|$|They hatch in spring, and {{the young}} crickets (called nymphs) eat and grow rapidly. They shed their <b>skin</b> (<b>molt)</b> eight or more times before they become adults.|$|R
25|$|Larvae develop {{through four}} stages, or instars, {{after which they}} {{metamorphose}} into pupae. At {{the end of each}} instar, the larvae <b>molt,</b> shedding their <b>skins</b> to allow for further growth.|$|R
50|$|After {{about three}} days, a Shrieker will {{metamorphose}} into an Ass-blaster. This {{is not as}} drastic a process as when Shriekers hatch out of Graboids, instead involving a Shrieker <b>molting</b> its outer <b>skin</b> layers.|$|R
50|$|Symbion pandora can {{reproduce}} both asexually by budding and sexually. In {{sexual reproduction}} the male attaches to a feeding stage and impregnates a budding female. The female then separates from the feeding stage and attaches herself to another host, where the larva in her develops. The female dies, and the larva escapes. The sexual reproductive cycle is triggered when the host crustacean <b>molts</b> its <b>skin</b> {{in order to}} grow.|$|R

5000|$|The German {{cockroach}} reproduces {{faster than}} any other residential cockroach, growing from egg to reproductive adult in approximately 50 - 60 days. [...] Once fertilized, a female German cockroach develops an ootheca in her abdomen. The abdomen swells as her eggs develop, until the translucent tip of the ootheca begins to protrude {{from the end of}} her abdomen, and by that time the eggs inside are fully sized. The ootheca, at first translucent, soon turns white and then within a few hours it turns pink, progressively darkening until, some 48 hours later, it attains the dark red-brown of the shell of a chestnut. The ootheca has a keel-like ridge along the line where the young emerge, and curls slightly towards that edge as it completes its maturation. A small percentage of the nymphs may hatch while the ootheca is still attached to the female, but the majority emerge some 24 hours after it has detached from the female's body. The newly hatched 3mm-long black nymphs then progress through six or seven instars before becoming sexually mature, but ecdysis is such a hazardous process that nearly half the nymphs die of natural causes before reaching adulthood. <b>Molted</b> <b>skins</b> and dead nymphs are soon eaten by living nymphs present at the time of molting.|$|R
5000|$|The word [...] "biofact" [...] is {{now widely}} used in the zoo/aquarium world, but was first used in 1993 in the Education Department at the New England Aquarium, Boston, to refer to {{preserved}} items such as animal bones, <b>skins,</b> <b>molts</b> and eggs. The Accreditation Standards and Related Policies of the Association of Zoos and Aquariums states that biofacts can be useful education tools, and are preferable to live animals because of potential ethical considerations.|$|R
50|$|As {{mentioned}} above, {{the outer}} {{layer of the}} shell {{is part of the}} skin; each scute (or plate) on the shell corresponds to a single modified scale. The remainder of the skin has much smaller scales, similar to the skin of other reptiles. Turtles do not <b>molt</b> their <b>skins</b> all at once as snakes do, but continuously in small pieces. When turtles are kept in aquaria, small sheets of dead skin {{can be seen in the}} water (often appearing to be a thin piece of plastic) having been sloughed off when the animals deliberately rub themselves against a piece of wood or stone. Tortoises also shed skin, but dead skin is allowed to accumulate into thick knobs and plates that provide protection to parts of the body outside the shell.|$|R
5000|$|In [...] "The Other", Spider-Man {{seemingly}} {{dies and}} <b>molts</b> his damaged <b>skin.</b> He creates a cocoon, and emerges {{with all his}} bodily damage healed: lost teeth, broken bones, his lost eye (which Morlun had torn out and eaten), scars, and even lost tonsils. In the words of Tony Stark, Peter's [...] "odometer's been reset". Since it was claimed in related issues that some species of spiders shed their skin once in a lifetime, {{this may be a}} one-time occurrence.|$|R
5000|$|Burt, Jack, Jodi, and Miguel later {{find the}} badly wounded Merliss; he {{explains}} {{that he and the}} government agents were ambushed by Shriekers from the Graboid they were chasing, before dying. While tracking the Shriekers, an albino Graboid—later named El Blanco, meaning [...] "The White One" [...] in Spanish—traps them on rocks for the night. After drawing El Blanco away, they find that the Shriekers have <b>molted</b> their <b>skin,</b> becoming winged creatures capable of jet-propelled flight. Miguel is killed by the creature, which then crashes on a metal fence, killing itself. Burt realizes that chemicals in their stomachs react explosively, enabling their flight. Finding them able to carry Graboid eggs, they surmise that they evolved to spread them through flight. Jodi dubs the new species Ass-Blasters. Meanwhile, Nancy and Mindy are attacked by an Ass-Blaster in town and hide in a freezer.|$|R
5000|$|Elephant seals are {{shielded}} from extreme cold by their blubber, {{more so than}} by fur. Their hair and outer layers of <b>skin</b> <b>molt</b> in large patches. The skin has to be regrown by blood vessels reaching through the blubber. When molting occurs, the seal is susceptible to the cold, and must rest on land, {{in a safe place}} called a [...] "haul out". Northern males and young adults haul out during June to July to molt; northern females and immature seals during April to May.|$|R
40|$|Lizards of {{the genus}} Anolis are {{commonly}} used as models for several ecological studies. Nevertheless, some aspects of their ecology have not been studied and information reported previously for several species must be reanalyzed. The {{aim of this study}} is to examine the structural habitat use in a population of the Many-scaled Anole, Anolis polylepis, with the purpose of comparing our results with the information reported previously for this species. Most of the captured individuals were on stems and we did not find any differences in the structural habitat use among sex/age classes. We found differences for perch height among individuals shedding their skin regarding those that are not. We also detected differences among our results and the information reported previously for this species. Such differences could be due to intrinsic factors of each population, such as the proportion of individuals that were <b>molting</b> their <b>skin</b> in a specific time. More studies with greater sample sizes and to a longer term are required to clearly understand the influence of these factors in the habitat use of A. polylepis and other anoline lizards...|$|R
5000|$|Once {{the larvae}} have {{undergone}} their last instar, the caterpillars pupate in a chrysalis. Unlike many moths, which build cocoons to pupate in, {{the majority of}} butterfly pupae are [...] "naked", meaning without {{the protection of the}} earth or a cocoon to protect them. After it has reached the end of its last instar, it sheds its <b>skin</b> (<b>molting</b> or apolysis), becoming a soft fleshy pupae, wherein upon close observation many parts of the future butterfly can be seen prior to the new skin hardening. As it hardens, the pupa takes on colors of its surroundings, providing it with excellent camouflage. After many days to a couple of weeks the butterfly emerges, usually in the morning or afternoon hours.|$|R

50|$|The <b>molting</b> of the <b>skin</b> occurs {{regularly}} in snakes. This is when old skin is outgrown. In {{the case of}} snakes, it is called shedding or ecdysis. Snakes will rub against rough surfaces to shed their skin. A shed skin is much longer than the snake that shed it, as the skin covers {{the top and bottom}} of each scale. If the skin is shed intact, each scale is unwrapped on the top and bottom side of the scale which almost doubles the length of the shed skin. While a snake is in the process of shedding the skin over its eye, the eye may become milky. This impairs the vision of the snake and may result in aggressive behavior.|$|R
50|$|Like all tarantulas, the Mexican redknee is an arthropod, {{and must}} go through a molting process to grow. Molting serves several purposes, such as {{renewing}} the tarantula's outer cover (shell) and replacing missing appendages. As tarantulas grow, they regularly <b>molt</b> (shed their <b>skin),</b> on multiple occasions during the year, depending on the tarantula's age. Since the exoskeleton cannot stretch, it must {{be replaced by a}} new one from beneath. A tarantula may also regenerate lost appendages gradually, with each succeeding molt. Prior to molting, the spider becomes sluggish and stops eating to conserve as much energy as possible. Their abdomens darken; this is the new exoskeleton beneath. Normally, the spider turns on its back to molt and lies still in that position for several hours. Once this has been accomplished, the tarantula does not eat for several days to weeks, and not uncommonly for up to a month or more after a molt, as its fangs are still soft; the fangs are also part of the exoskeleton and are shed {{with the rest of the}} skin. The whole process can take several hours and sheaths the tarantula with a moist new skin in place of an old, faded one.|$|R
