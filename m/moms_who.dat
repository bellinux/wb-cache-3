500|$|While Bill Clinton's job-approval {{ratings were}} around 60%, an April 1999 {{study by the}} Pew Research Center for the People found that {{respondents}} suffered from [...] "Clinton fatigue" [...] where they were [...] "tired of all {{the problems associated with}} the Clinton administration" [...] including the Lewinsky scandal and impeachment. Texas Governor and likely Republican presidential nominee George W. Bush was leading Gore 54% to 41% in polls during that time. Gore's advisers believed that the [...] "Lewinsky scandal and Bill's past womanizing...alienated independent voters—especially the soccer <b>moms,</b> <b>who</b> stood for traditional values". Consequently, Gore's presidential campaign [...] "veered too far in differentiating himself from Bill and his record and had difficulty taking advantage of the Clinton administration's legitimate successes". In addition, Hillary's candidacy for the open Senate seat in New York exacerbated the [...] "three-way tensions evident in the White House since 1993", as [...] "not only was Hillary unavailable as a campaigner, she was poaching top Democratic fund-raisers and donors who would normally concentrate on the vice president". In one instance [...] "Hillary insisted on being invited —over the objections of the event's organizers", where the First Lady [...] "shocked the vice president's supporters by soliciting donations for herself in front of Tipper".|$|E

50|$|Matthew Dickman’s melancholic {{portraits of}} impoverished white {{teenagers}} dazzle {{me into the}} always painful, yet easily forgettable, awareness that many people suffer psychically under the knife of American prosperity.

50|$|There {{are several}} {{different}} genres or formats of daytime programming that are produced.

Commercials aired during daytime programming mostly advertise household goods and feminine products geared toward housewives and stay-at-home <b>moms,</b> <b>who</b> of course make up the largest portion of the daytime viewing audience.|$|E
50|$|Hodges {{started the}} {{campaign}} {{with a low}} name recognition across the state and early on it was decided by his camp to make education as their chief issue for the election.

Beasley was cited for his opposition to all-day kindergarten and Hodges proposed a state lottery {{to pay for the}} funding of pre-school and to also grant college scholarships. The lottery proved to be enormously popular with blacks because many could not afford {{to send their children to}} pre-school and with soccer <b>moms</b> <b>who</b> were worried by the rapidly increasing cost of higher education.|$|E
