5|$|Fellini secured {{financing}} {{through the}} producers Dino De Laurentiis and Carlo Ponti, {{who wanted to}} cast Silvana <b>Mangano</b> (De Laurentiis' wife) as Gelsomina and Burt Lancaster as Zampanò, but Fellini refused these choices. Giulietta Masina had been {{the inspiration for the}} entire project, so Fellini was determined never to accept an alternative to her. For Zampanò, Fellini had hoped to cast a nonprofessional and, to that end, he tested a number of circus strongmen, to no avail. He also had trouble finding the right person for the role of Il Matto. His first choice was the actor Moraldo Rossi, {{who was a member of}} Fellini's social circle and had the right type of personality and athletic physique, but Rossi wanted to be the assistant director, not a performer. Alberto Sordi, the star of Fellini's earlier films The White Sheik and I Vitelloni, was eager to take the role, and was bitterly disappointed when Fellini rejected him after a tryout in costume.|$|E
5|$|Lawrence's fame {{continued}} to grow with her starring role as Katniss Everdeen in the Hunger Games film series (2012–2015), which established her as the highest-grossing action heroine of all time. She went on to earn various accolades for her collaborations with director David O. Russell. Her performance as a depressed and bipolar widow in the romance film Silver Linings Playbook (2012) earned her an Academy Award for Best Actress, making her the second-youngest winner of the award. Lawrence subsequently won a BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role for playing a troubled wife in the black comedy American Hustle (2013).

25|$|Anastasia and the <b>Mangano</b> {{brothers}} were usually in conflict, {{even though they}} worked together for 20 years. On numerous occasions, Anastasia and Vincent <b>Mangano</b> came close to physical conflict. Vincent <b>Mangano</b> felt uncomfortable with Anastasia's close ties to Lucky Luciano, Frank Costello, Joseph Bonanno and other top mobsters outside his family. <b>Mangano</b> was also jealous of Anastasia's strong power base in Murder Inc. and the waterfront unions. In April 1951, Vincent <b>Mangano</b> disappeared without a trace, while his brother Philip was found dead. No one was ever charged in the <b>Mangano</b> brothers' deaths, and Vincent's body was never found. However, it is generally believed that Anastasia murdered both of them.|$|E

25|$|Berlusconi {{has never}} been tried on charges {{relating}} to the Cosa Nostra, although several Mafia turncoats have stated that Berlusconi had connections with the Sicilian criminal association. The claims arise mostly from the hiring of Vittorio <b>Mangano,</b> {{who was accused of}} being a mafioso, as a gardener and stable-man at Berlusconi's Villa San Martino in Arcore, a small town near Milan. It was Berlusconi's friend Marcello Dell'Utri who introduced <b>Mangano</b> to Berlusconi in 1973. Berlusconi denied any ties to the Mafia. Marcello Dell'Utri even stated that the Mafia did not exist at all.|$|E
25|$|After the hearing, Michael {{decides he}} wants all Corleone enemies dead; Mitchell, Roth, the Almeidas and the <b>Manganos.</b> After {{eliminating}} {{the two remaining}} families and killing Mitchell in Cuba, Dominic turns his attention to Roth, who Geary has had extradited from Cuba on corruption charges. Dominic heads to the airport, and after a shootout with Roth's guards, airport security and police, Dominic kills Roth and escapes. Michael and Tom congratulate him, telling him the war is over, and he will now be known as Dominic Corleone. The game ends with Dominic shooting Fredo {{in the back of}} the head on a fishing boat.|$|R

Dominic manages to escape Cuba, but as his plane leaves, Roth arrives and ensures Almeida the assassination attempt will not interrupt their plans. Back in New York, Michael demands to know why Dominic and Fredo didn't turn to him after the <b>Manganos</b> tried to have them killed. Fredo reveals Roth was behind everything; it was all planned to get Dominic to Cuba to kill Castro so Roth and Almeida could align with Batista. Sick of being passed over and ignored, Fredo agreed to help Roth, who had promised him his own family. Disgusted, Michael disowns Fredo. Meanwhile, Michael is worried about Pentangeli's testimony, and has his brother, Vincenzo (Ralph Peduto) brought over from Sicily, hoping to shame Frank into not testifying. Dominic learns Roth has had Vincenzo kidnapped, but is able to rescue him in time for Pentangeli's testimony. Frank doesn't testify against Michael, and Geary dismisses the hearing.|$|R

25|$|Michael warns Dominic {{not to make}} {{an enemy}} of Don Samuele <b>Mangano</b> (Ralph Peduto), so Dominic offers him a partnership, which he accepts. Meanwhile, Dominic bombs the Granados {{compound}} and kills Rico. Subsequently, Fredo and Dominic are almost killed in a drive-by shooting. Fredo blames Samuele for the hit, urging Dominic to strike back. He does so, taking over Mangano's warehouse in Florida. A furious Samuele denies he ordered the hit, and declares war against Dominic's family. Dominic asks Roth for advice, who tells him he can reason with <b>Mangano,</b> if Dominic is willing to help him out. Roth still believes the Cuban deal is possible, and his associate, CIA agent Henry Mitchell (Peter Hulne), tells Dominic the CIA want Fidel Castro dead so they can bring back Batista. Mitchell proposes that Dominic travel to Cuba and kill Castro. Dominic is worried that Michael is unaware of any of this, but Roth assures him that Michael has enough to worry about with the senate hearings.|$|E

25|$|The {{family was}} one of the five {{families}} that were founded in New York after the Castellammarese War of 1931. For most of the next quarter-century, it was a minor player in organized crime. Its most prominent member during this time was its underboss Albert Anastasia, who rose to infamy as the operating head of the underworld's enforcement arm, Murder, Inc. He remained a power even after Murder, Inc. was smashed in the late 1940s, and took over his family in 1951—by all accounts, after murdering the family's founder Vincent <b>Mangano.</b>|$|E
25|$|According to the FBI, the Genovese {{family has}} not had an {{official}} boss since Gigante's death. Law enforcement considers Leo to be the acting boss, <b>Mangano</b> the underboss, and Cirillo the consigliere. The Genovese family is known for placing top caporegimes in leadership positions to help the administration run the day-to-day activities of the crime family. At present, capos Bellomo, Ernest Muscarella, Cirillo, and Dentico hold the greatest influence within the family and play major roles in its administration. The Manhattan and Bronx factions, the traditional powers in the family, still exercise that control today.|$|E
25|$|The crew {{controlled}} much {{of organized}} crime throughout downtown Manhattan, and Gigante {{went on to become}} one of the most powerful caporegimes (captains) in the New York Mafia from the early 1970s until his promotion to boss in 1981. Some of the rackets included labor union control, gambling, loan sharking, hijackings, and extortion of businesses. Through his brother Mario, who later became a capo of his own crew, the Gigantes maintained influence in the Bronx, Yonkers and upper Westchester. Gigante's closest associates included his brother Mario Gigante, sons Andrew Gigante and Vincent Esposito, Dominick Alongi, Venero <b>Mangano,</b> Frank Condo, Dominick DiQuarto, Thomas D'Antonio, Frank Caggiano, Louis Manna, Giuseppe Dellacroe, Dominick Canterino, Dominick Cirillo, Joseph Denti, and Joseph Sarcinella.|$|E
25|$|In 1996, the Mafia pentito (justice collaborator) Salvatore Cancemi {{declared}} that Berlusconi and Dell'Utri were in {{direct contact with}} Mafia boss Totò Riina. The alleged contacts, according to Cancemi, were to lead to legislation favourable to Cosa Nostra, in particular the harsh 41-bis prison regime. The underlying premise was that Cosa Nostra would support Berlusconi's Forza Italia party in return for political favours. After a two-year investigation, magistrates closed the inquiry without charges. They did not find evidence to corroborate Cancemi's allegations. Similarly, a two-year investigation, also launched on evidence from Cancemi, into Berlusconi's alleged association with the Mafia was closed in 1996.

This new $4.6 million contribution was hailed as a victory for Nassau County bus riders, although it will still leave NICE bus with a $6 million operating deficit. However, on December 11, 2014, Nassau County executive Ed <b>Mangano</b> proposed cutting $4 million from Nassau County's NICE bus contribution (in addition to cuts to numerous other Nassau County services) to replace the $30 million that will be lost after the shutdown of Nassau County's controversial school speed zone cameras.|$|E

The alleged contacts, according to Cancemi, were to lead to legislation favourable to Cosa Nostra, in particular reforming the harsh 41-bis prison regime.

Hagen tells Dominic {{they need to get}} a senator on their side; Pat Geary (Chris Edgerly), who has a weakness for prostitutes, and frequents a local brothel. They set Geary up so he awakens with a dead prostitute, and Tom and Dominic promise him the girl will disappear, as long as he offers his friendship to the Corleones. Geary agrees, advising Dominic the <b>Mangano</b> family are planning to start operating in Miami.|$|E
25|$|In March 2009, EA {{launched}} a Facebook app, called The Godfather II: Crime Rings to help promote the game. Based {{on the crime}} ring mechanic from the game, the app allowed players to create a mobster and take over rackets, building crime rings and eventually becoming Don. Players were randomly placed {{into one of the}} five families from the game (Corleone, Rosato, Granados, <b>Mangano</b> and Almeida) upon joining the app. In early April, EA sent out brass knuckles to game journalists to promote the game. However, brass knuckles are illegal to own in several states. Realizing their mistake, EA requested everyone who received the knuckles return them.

When Luciano was {{sent to prison for}} pandering in 1936, a rival alliance took control of the Commission. The alliance of <b>Mangano,</b> Bonanno, Buffalo crime family boss Stefano Magaddino, and Profaci used their power to control organized crime in America. Understanding his vulnerability, Gagliano was careful to avoid opposing this new alliance. Gagliano was a quiet man who avoided the media and stayed off the streets. He preferred to pass his orders to the family though Lucchese and a few other close allies. In contrast, Lucchese was the public face of the family who carried out Gagliano's orders. In 1946, Lucchese attended the Cosa Nostra Havana Conference in Cuba on behalf of Gagliano. Gagliano kept such a low profile that virtually nothing is known about his activities from 1932 until he retired or died between 1951 and 1953.|$|E
