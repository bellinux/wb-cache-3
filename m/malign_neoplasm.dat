40|$|Although {{testicular}} cancer (TCa) is rare neoplasm {{that occurs in}} young men aged between 18 and 35 years. The risk factors are cryptorchidism, family history, and infertility. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the diagnostic efficacy of neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio for the diagnosis of TCa. The patients who underwent orchiectomy in our unit reviewed retrospectively. Age of the patients, the laboratory results and pathological reports were recorded. The neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) was calculated as the neutrophil counts divided to the lymphocyte counts. The patients were divided into two groups according to the pathology record. The testicular <b>malign</b> <b>neoplasms</b> are included in group 1 and group 2 includes the patients who had cryptorchidism and atrophic testes without any malignancy and inflammation. For statistical analysis, student t test was used for comparing the data between groups and the area under curves were used for NLR, neutrophil and lymphocyte counts in the diagnosis of testicular <b>malign</b> <b>neoplasms.</b> There were 285 patients in the present study. The patients' age was between 10 and 90 with a mean age of 36. 87  ±  11. 83 and 37. 24  ±  20. 31 years in groups respectively. The neutrophil, white blood cell counts and NLR were significantly higher in group 1 and lymphocye count was lower in patients with {{testicular cancer}} with statistical significance. The area under curve was 0. 645, 0. 626, 0. 578 for NLR, neutrophil and lymphocyte counts for the diagnosis of TCa. Mixed germ cell tumor was the most common histologic subtype with an incidence of 51. 58 %(n: 65 patients) and seminomas were reported 37. 30 % (n: 47 patients) of the patients. Testicular cancer has low incidence when compared the other urologic malignancies.

30|$|High-attenuation {{pulmonary}} abnormalities {{can result}} {{from a variety of}} different conditions, including from the deposition of calcium. Amiodarone pulmonary toxicity may cause high-attenuation pulmonary parenchymal opacities. Multiple dense nodular opacities are rarely seen in siderosis, stannosis, talcosis and baritosis, in which iron, tin, talc and barium sulfate respectively are deposited in the lungs. Computed tomography (CT) is highly sensitive in the detection of areas of abnormally high attenuation in the lung parenchyma, airways, mediastinum and pleura. Calcifications in the thorax are frequently manifestations of previous infectious processes. However, they may be due to benign or <b>malign</b> <b>neoplasms,</b> metabolic disorders, or occupational exposure. The cause of the calcifications and other high-attenuation conditions may be determined by means of the location and pattern of the abnormalities within the lung parenchyma and knowledge of the associated clinical features. High-attenuation pulmonary abnormalities can be divided into five main patterns on CT: small hyperdense nodules, large nodules or masses, high-attenuation linear or reticular pattern, high-attenuation consolidation, and high-attenuation extraparenchymal lesions.|$|R

40|$|Prostate {{carcinoma}} (PC) is {{the most}} common <b>malign</b> <b>neoplasm</b> found in men over 65 years of age. In Italy, the incidence of this cancer is around 60 / 100, 000 /year, corresponding to about 11, 000 new cases each year. Patients with PC consume health resources for a cost that is 10 - 24 % higher than that of similar populations without PC. It is estimated that in Italy, each year, there are 19, 000 hospitalizations for prostate cancer in patients over 65, a figure that represents 4 % of the total hospitalizations for oncological diseases. We conducted a marginal cost/effectiveness analysis of bicalutamide vs. flutamide, both administered in combination with LHRH, in patients with advanced (metastatic) PC, {{on the basis of a}} randomized trial comparing 4 strategies of total androgenic blockade (TAB). The analysis was conducted in the perspective of the SSN (National health system). The comparison revealed that drug acquisition costs are not the only determinants of the economical differences between the two therapeutical strategies. Furthermore, we demonstrated that prolonged survival of the patients does not increase the consumption of health resources, since the chronological shift of the terminal phase reduces the value of the resources dedicated to it. When conducing the cost/effectiveness analysis, the survival advantage associated to bicalutamide has been adjusted to balance the low quality of life of PC patients. The pharmacoeconomical benefit of bicalutamide resulted of 12, 150 Euro/QALY, while the cost per year of life saved resulted inferior, ranging from 8. 327 to 11. 440 Euro. This cost/QALY value is nevertheless lower than that associated to several therapeutical strategies that are commonly accepted in developed countries (domiciliar hemodialysis, heart transplantation, breast cancer screening, etc.). Considering that 12. 150 Euro/QALY is the highest estimate of the relative cost/effectiveness of bicalutamide, it appears that the combination bicalutamide + LHRH represents an economically acceptable alternative to flutamide + LHRH in advanced PC patients...|$|E
40|$|Neoplasm of {{adrenal glands}} are frequent. In a normal {{population}} benign neoplasm dominates. For these {{the value of}} CT and MRI in diagnostics is well examined. Both are suited to predict benignancy. However, for patient with a high risk for adrenal metastases only few data is available. This study examined whether CT and MRI are sufficiently accurate to predict benignancy in a high-risk group. A diagnostic algorithm for patients with a lung carcinoma (LuCa) and an adrenal neoplasm (AN) is derived from our data. This retrospectives study included patients with LuCa {{and at least one}} AN, if at least one MRI with chemical shift imaging (CS-MRI) and optionally an unenhanced CT (nCT) existed and if the nature of the AN was known either by histologic proof or follow-up. 51 patients with 65 AN were enrolled. In all cases a CS-MRI and in 41 a nCT was available. The signal loss in CS-MRI and the density in nCT were measured. Threshold values for assuming benignancy were fixed: in nCT a density of ≤ 10 HU, in CS-MRI a signal loss of > 50 %. For CS-MRI a sensitivity of 88. 9 % and a specificity of 93. 6 % were found (negative prediction value (NPV) 95. 7 %, positive prediction value (PPV) 84. 2 %, accuracy 92. 3 %. A ROC analysis confirmed that the threshold value of 50 % signal loss offers a good differentiation between benign and <b>malign</b> <b>neoplasm</b> in a high-risk group. In nCT a sensitivity of 92. 3 % and a specificity of 78. 6 % were found (NPV 95. 6 %, PPV 66. 6 %, exactness 82. 9 %). From this data an algorithm was derived for patients with LuCa and AN. As nCT and CS-MRI are equivalent concerning the NPV, it is possible to perform nCT first. If benignancy of AN cannot be proven, a CS-MRI can provided further specificity. With this algorithm staging of LuCa patients can be non-invasively preformed with clinically sufficient accuracy. If the dignity of AN remains unclear a PET-CT and possibly histologic proof may be necessary in potentially operable patients. Our data on the performance of CS-MRI and nCT in a high-risk group is comparable with published data found in a normal population. In conclusion, the proposed diagnostic algorithm using nCT and CS-MRI for patients with a high risk for adrenal metastases can, with sufficient accuracy, predict the benignity of an adrenal neoplasm...|$|E

The majority of the persons affected are female (n= 142, 61 %) with an average age of 56 years. Benign neoplasms represent the majority of the cases (n= 177, 75 %). The myxoma is the most frequent benign neoplasm (n= 103, 58 %) among adults (n= 228), while rhabdomyomas (n= 3, 38 %) and teratomas (n= 3, 38 %) are the most common ones among children and adolescents (n= 8). Myxomas are the most frequent cardio-surgical relevant neoplasms, which have accounted for 44 % (103 patients) in this study. They are mainly located in the left atrium (n= 93, 90 %). In approximately 6 % of the cases the myxomas {{are to be found in}} the right atrium; other locations are the left ventricle and the mitral valve. In two cases the location (of the myxomas) remains unknown despite intensive file search (digital and/or written from). Women (n= 74, 72 %) are more frequently affected than men (n= 29, 28 %).

40|$|BACKGROUND: Human {{papillomavirus}} (HPV) {{plays a role}} in {{the development}} of benign and <b>malign</b> <b>neoplasms</b> in both sexes. The Italian recommendations for HPV vaccines consider only females. The BEST II study (Bayesian modelling to assess the Effectiveness of a vaccination Strategy to prevent HPV-related diseases) evaluates 1) the cost-effectiveness of immunization strategies targeting universal vaccination compared with cervical cancer screening and female-only vaccination and 2) the economic impact of immunization on various HPV-induced diseases. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate whether female-only vaccination or universal vaccination is the most cost-effective intervention against HPV. METHODS: We present a dynamic Bayesian Markov model to investigate transmission dynamics in cohorts of females and males in a follow-up period of 55 years. We assumed that quadrivalent vaccination (against HPV 16, 18, 6, and 11) is available for 12 -year-old individuals. The model accounts for the progression of subjects across HPV-induced health states (cervical, vaginal, vulvar, anal, penile, and head/neck cancer as well as anogenital warts). The sexual mixing is modeled on the basis of age-, sex-, and sexual behavioral-specific matrices to obtain the dynamic force of infection. RESULTS: In comparison to cervical cancer screening, universal vaccination results in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of € 1, 500. When universal immunization is compared with female-only vaccination, it is cost-effective with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of € 11, 600. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis shows a relatively large amount of parameter uncertainty, which interestingly has, however, no substantial impact on the decision-making process. The intervention being assessed seems to be associated with an attractive cost-effectiveness profile. CONCLUSIONS: Universal HPV vaccination is found to be a cost-effective choice when compared with either cervical cancer screening or female-only vaccination within the Italian context...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBackgroundHuman {{papillomavirus}} (HPV) {{plays a role}} in {{the development}} of benign and <b>malign</b> <b>neoplasms</b> in both sexes. The Italian recommendations for HPV vaccines consider only females. The BEST II study (Bayesian modelling to assess the Effectiveness of a vaccination Strategy to prevent HPV-related diseases) evaluates 1) the cost-effectiveness of immunization strategies targeting universal vaccination compared with cervical cancer screening and female-only vaccination and 2) the economic impact of immunization on various HPV-induced diseases. ObjectiveThe objective of this study was to evaluate whether female-only vaccination or universal vaccination is the most cost-effective intervention against HPV. MethodsWe present a dynamic Bayesian Markov model to investigate transmission dynamics in cohorts of females and males in a follow-up period of 55 years. We assumed that quadrivalent vaccination (against HPV 16, 18, 6, and 11) is available for 12 -year-old individuals. The model accounts for the progression of subjects across HPV-induced health states (cervical, vaginal, vulvar, anal, penile, and head/neck cancer as well as anogenital warts). The sexual mixing is modeled on the basis of age-, sex-, and sexual behavioral-specific matrices to obtain the dynamic force of infection.

40|$|The submandibular glands {{are subject}} to several pathologies that require excision. The most common problem that affects these salivary glands is sialadenitis {{combined}} with sialolithiasis. This problem occurs in the submandibular gland 10 times more frequently than {{it does in the}} parotid gland. Other illnesses frequently involving the submandibular glands are represented by sialadenosis and benign, <b>malign,</b> and intermediate <b>neoplasms.</b> Diagnosis of any disturbance in the submandibular gland involves both a clinical and instrumental (echography, traditional radiography [ortopantomography] and eventually computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging) assessment. Surgery is the usual method of treatment of both chronic sialadenitis and neoplasms in the submandibular gland. A submandibular gland surgical approach can be cervical, intraoral, or endoscopic. The authors present their clinical experience with a total of 40 patients with illnesses involving the submandibular gland treated with submandibular gland excision by a transcervical approach. Their experience suggests that this approach entails a relatively simple procedure, involves low risks for the nerve structure around the gland, permits wide resection margins for neoplasms, and incurs little aesthetic damage. © 2007 Muntaz B.

40|$|This work {{is aimed}} at {{identifying}} factors associated with primary jejunum-ileal tumors malignancy, defining a prediction model with sensitivity, specificity and accuracy to distinguish <b>malign</b> from benign <b>neoplasms.</b> These tumors are rare, have highly unspecific presentation and, frequently, are diagnosed late. We reviewed the charts of 42 patients with primary jejunum-ileal tumors treated in the Department of General Surgery of Rio de Janeiro State University Hospital, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil, from 1969 to 1998. We performed bivariate analyses, based on chi² test, searching associations between tumors malignancy and demographic and clinical variables. Then logistic regression was employed to consider the independent effect of variables previously identified on malignancy risk. The malign tumors included 11 adenocarcinomas, 7 leiomyosarcomas, 5 carcinoids and 4 lymphomas; the benign tumors included 10 leiomyomas, 2 hamartomas, and single cases of adenoma, multiple neurilemoma and choristoma. The bivariate analyses indicated the association between malignancy and palpable abdominal mass (P = 0. 003), period from signs and symptoms onset to diagnosis (P = 0. 016), anemia (P = 0. 020), anorexia (P = 0. 003), abdominal pain (P = 0. 031), weight loss (P = 0. 001), nausea and vomit (P = 0. 094), and intestinal obstruction (P = 0. 066); no association with patients demographic characteristics were found. In the final logistic regression model, weight loss, anemia and intestinal obstruction were statistically associated with the dependent variable of interest. Based only on three variables [...] weight loss, anemia and intestinal obstruction [...] the model defined was able to predict primary jejunum-ileal tumors malignancy with sensitivity of 85. 2 %, specificity of 80. 0 %, and accuracy of 83. 3 %...|$|R
