5|$|The engines power an 18.59metre {{diameter}} five-bladed <b>main</b> <b>rotor.</b> The {{rotor blades}} are constructed from carbon/glass with nomex honeycomb and rohacell foam, edged with titanium alloy in a sandwich construction. The shaping of the <b>main</b> <b>rotor</b> blades {{is derived from}} the BERP rotor blades first used on the Westland Lynx. This blade design improves aerodynamic efficiency at the blade tip and reduces the acoustic signature. Improved BERP IV rotors have since been developed; when installed, this increases the AW101's maximum takeoff weight.|$|E
5|$|On 15 May 2003, AgustaWestland {{signed an}} {{agreement}} with Bell Helicopter to undertake final assembly of the US101 in the U.S. Under the pact, AgustaWestland would produce the <b>main</b> <b>rotor</b> blades and main fuselage sections at its Yeovil, UK, facility. The company would also manufacture other components, including the gearbox, at its Cascina Costa, Italy facility; this represents a work share of 36 per cent. The remaining 64 per cent work share was split between Lockheed Martin (31 per cent) and Bell Helicopter (27 per cent) and other firms (6 per cent).|$|E
5|$|As intended, {{it would}} have functioned as a stealth helicopter, {{incorporating}} {{a number of different}} techniques and technologies in order to reduce its radar cross-section (RCS) along with other areas of visibility and detectability. The exterior surfaces of the RAH-66 were faceted and covered with both radar-absorbent material (RAM) coatings and infrared-suppressant paint; {{as a result of these}} combined measures, the Comanche's RCS was claimed to have been 360 times smaller than that of the AH-64 Apache attack helicopter. The acoustic signature of the rotorcraft was also reported to be noticeably lower than comparative helicopters; this reduction had been partially achieved through the adoption of an all-composite five-blade <b>main</b> <b>rotor</b> and pioneering canted tail rotor assembly.|$|E
50|$|The rotor system, or {{more simply}} rotor, is the {{rotating}} {{part of a}} helicopter that generates lift. A rotor system may be mounted horizontally, as <b>main</b> <b>rotors</b> are, providing lift vertically, {{or it may be}} mounted vertically, such as a tail rotor, to provide horizontal thrust to counteract torque from the <b>main</b> <b>rotors.</b> The rotor consists of a mast, hub and rotor blades.|$|R
50|$|Improved MB with an {{increased}} payload, folding <b>main</b> <b>rotors</b> and tailfin, Arriel 2N engines and new avionics. Initially for the Mexican Navy.|$|R
50|$|The {{aircraft}} fuselage is {{a simple}} open frame with a seat mounted on it. Its two coaxial, contra-rotating two-bladed rotors have diameters of 4 m. The <b>main</b> <b>rotors</b> are both of fixed pitch design, with no articulation in any axis. Steering is accomplished by pivoting the rotor head on a gimbal using a control handle, {{in a similar manner}} to a weight shift hang glider. Climb and descent is controlled by increasing and decreasing the throttle. The aircraft lacks a tail rotor as the coaxial, contra-rotating <b>main</b> <b>rotors</b> produce zero net torque. Yawing motion is produced and controlled by electronic gyroscopically-controlled differential electric braking of the <b>main</b> <b>rotors.</b> With its empty weight of 70 kg and a gross weight of 220 kg the H-4 has a useful load of 150 kg. With full fuel of 19 L the payload is 136 kg.|$|R
5|$|In 2014, Boeing {{conceptualized}} an Apache upgrade {{prior to}} the introduction of the U.S. Army's anticipated attack version of the Future Vertical Lift aircraft, forecast to replace the Apache by 2040. The conceptual AH-64F would have greater speed via a new 3,000 shp turboshaft engine from the improved turbine engine program, retractable landing gear, stub wings to offload lift from the <b>main</b> <b>rotor</b> during cruise, and a tail rotor that can articulate 90 degrees to provide forward thrust. In October 2016, the Army revealed they would not pursue another Apache upgrade to focus on funding the FVL; the Army will continue buying the Apache through the 2020s until Boeing's production line ends in 2026, then FVL is slated to come online in 2030.|$|E
5|$|Jolly Green 67 flew east at first, {{further into}} {{territory}} {{held by the}} North Vietnamese, before it turned southeast for a few kilometers, when a fire {{broke out in the}} left engine. Pieces of the tail rotor struck the <b>main</b> <b>rotor,</b> and the aircraft rolled and crashed on its left side, burning ferociously. No rescue beepers were heard. The entire crew was listed as MIA and presumed killed: Capt. Peter Hayden Chapman II (pilot), Capt. John Henry Call III (co-pilot), TSgt. William Roy Pearson, TSgt. Allen J. Avery (para-rescuemen), TSgt. Roy D. Prater (Crew Chief), and Sgt. James Harold Alley (combat photographer). The fire consuming the helicopter was so hot it melted parts of the aircraft and continued to burn for three more days.|$|E
5|$|Lockheed {{designed}} the Cheyenne as a compound helicopter, which combines a helicopter with fixed-wing features for increased performance, usually speed. The design included {{features such as}} a rigid <b>main</b> <b>rotor,</b> low-mounted wings, and a pusher propeller. The Cheyenne was powered by a General Electric T64 turboshaft engine. Thrust was provided by a pusher propeller {{at the rear of}} the aircraft. At high speeds, the amount of lift provided by the wings, along with thrust from the pusher prop, reduced the aerodynamic loading of the rotor. At such speeds, the rotor produced 20% of the lift and could be adjusted by collective pitch control changes. Rotor tilt was controlled through gyroscopic precession. The Cheyenne achieved speeds over 200knots (230mph, 370km/h), but as a compound helicopter was unable to qualify for speed records in helicopter categories.|$|E
40|$|Boundary layer {{transition}} detection by {{high speed}} infrared thermography was successfully demonstrated on a Mach scaled helicopter model rotor blade and on full scale helicopter <b>main</b> <b>rotors.</b> Transition detection {{was applied to}} the rotor blade upper surface. A detection technique is presented using single instantaneous infrared images, allowing the measurement of {{the beginning and the end}} of the transitional flow region. Transition results are discussed for both the model scale helicopter blade and for the <b>main</b> <b>rotors</b> of the DLR research helicopters BO 105 and EC 135 -FHS in ground runs and in hover conditions...|$|R
50|$|There {{have been}} two main types of systems to control the <b>main</b> <b>rotors,</b> {{mechanical}} mixing and cyclic/collective pitch mixing (CCPM). Most earlier helicopters used mechanical mixing. Today, nearly all R/C helicopter use CCPM.|$|R
25|$|Lynx HMA.8:Upgraded {{maritime}} attack version {{based on}} Super Lynx 100. Gem 42-200 engines, BERP type <b>main</b> <b>rotors</b> and larger tail rotor of AH.7. Fitted with FLIR in turret above nose, with radar moved to radome below nose.|$|R
5|$|Proposals were {{submitted}} by Bell, Boeing Vertol/Grumman team, Hughes, Lockheed, and Sikorsky. In July 1973, the U.S. Department of Defense selected finalists Bell and Hughes Aircraft's Toolco Aircraft Division (later Hughes Helicopters). This began the phase 1 of the competition. Each company built prototype helicopters {{and went through}} a flight test program. Hughes' Model 77/YAH-64A prototype first flew on 30 September 1975, while Bell's Model 409/YAH-63A prototype first flew on 1 October 1975. After evaluating the test results, the Army selected Hughes' YAH-64A over Bell's YAH-63A in 1976. Reasons for selecting the YAH-64A included its more damage tolerant four-blade <b>main</b> <b>rotor</b> and the instability of the YAH-63's tricycle landing gear arrangement.|$|E
5|$|The AH-64D Apache Longbow is {{equipped}} with a glass cockpit and advanced sensors, the most noticeable of which being the AN/APG-78 Longbow millimeter-wave fire-control radar (FCR) target acquisition system and the Radar Frequency Interferometer (RFI), housed in a dome located above the <b>main</b> <b>rotor.</b> The radome's raised position enables target detection while the helicopter is behind obstacles (e.g. terrain, trees or buildings). The AN/APG-78 is capable of simultaneously tracking up to 128 targets and engaging up to 16 at once, an attack can be initiated within 30 seconds. A radio modem integrated with the sensor suite allows data to be shared with ground units and other Apaches; allowing them to fire on targets detected by a single helicopter.|$|E
5|$|The project {{suffered}} a setback on 12 March 1969, when the rotor on prototype #3 (s/n 66-8828) struck the fuselage and caused the aircraft to crash, killing the pilot, David A. Beil. The accident occurred {{on a test}} flight where the pilot was to manipulate the controls to excite 0.5P oscillations (or half-P hop) in the rotor; 0.5P is a vibration that happens once per two <b>main</b> <b>rotor</b> revolutions, where P is the rotor's rotational speed. The accident investigation noted that safety mechanisms on the controls had apparently been disabled for the flight. The investigation concluded that the pilot-induced oscillations {{had set up a}} resonant vibration that exceeded the rotor system's ability to compensate. After the investigation, the rotor and control systems were modified to prevent the same problem from occurring again.|$|E
50|$|The {{company makes}} a single seat autogyro, the Gyro-Kopp-Ters Midnight Hawk, and a two-seats in tandem model, the Gyro-Kopp-Ters Twin Eagle, {{both of which}} use Subaru {{automotive}} conversion engines and Dragon Wings <b>main</b> <b>rotors</b> made by Rotor Flight Dynamics.|$|R
50|$|The Sokół is of {{conventional}} design and construction, with two PZL-10W turboshaft engines, {{which are based}} on the PZL-10S - licensed Russian designed TVD-10B turboprops that power the Polish-built An-28. Composites are used in the three-bladed tail and four-bladed <b>main</b> <b>rotors.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The S-97 design {{includes}} {{variable speed}} rigid coaxial <b>main</b> <b>rotors</b> and a variable-pitch pusher propeller, making the S-97 a compound helicopter. Like the X2, it has fly-by-wire control and dynamic anti-vibration actuators {{to cancel out}} shaking. The <b>main</b> <b>rotors</b> have hingeless hubs and stiff blades, to improve low-speed handling and efficiency of hover. At high speeds, the close spacing of the hubs reduces drag. The stiff blades allow each rotor to have low lift on the retreating side of its rotor disk (reducing drag), whereas each rotor on a conventional coaxial rotor with [...] "floppy" [...] blades needs nearly equal lift distribution. The propeller relieves the rotor of propulsion, further reducing drag.|$|R
5|$|There {{have also}} been {{accidents}} involving the Apache helicopter in Israeli service. During the Lebanon War in 2006, two IAF AH-64A helicopters collided, killing one pilot and critically wounding three. In another incident in the conflict an IAF AH-64D crashed due to a malfunction in the <b>main</b> <b>rotor,</b> killing the two crew. In late 2007, the Israeli Air Force put further purchases and deliveries of AH-64Ds on hold during an investigation upon the aircraft's performance envelope. However, Israeli officials have since praised the Apache for its role in Operation Cast Lead in 2008, against Hamas in Gaza. In recent years, Israeli Apaches {{have been used to}} patrol the skies over Gaza; strike operations against insurgents using these helicopters has become a frequent occurrence.|$|E
5|$|The five UH-1 gunships {{immediately}} strafed Viet Cong {{positions with}} 2.75-inch rockets, {{but failed to}} suppress the enemy fire. After South Vietnamese soldiers had disembarked from the helicopters, one CH-21 was too severely damaged {{to get off the}} ground. A second CH-21 was sent to rescue the crew, but it too was immobilized as soon as it touched the ground. One of the Hueys returned to pick up the crews of the two downed CH-21s. As it prepared to land, the <b>main</b> <b>rotor</b> was struck by enemy gunfire. The aircraft flipped over to the right and crashed. Almost simultaneously, a third CH-21 sustained heavy damage and was forced to land on the rice fields a short distance from the first two helicopters. By 10:30, all the South Vietnamese soldiers who had landed on the field were under heavy fire from inside Ap Bac and refused to move. Sergeant Arnold Bowers, who had ridden in the first crashed helicopter, raced back and forth to rescue injured American airmen.|$|E
25|$|The yellow <b>main</b> <b>rotor</b> blade {{separated}} in flight rendering the aircraft uncontrollable.|$|E
50|$|First, {{there is}} no tail <b>rotor,</b> and the <b>main</b> <b>rotors</b> are contra-rotating. Yaw is {{controlled}} by fine adjustment of a differential gear in the rotor drive transmission. When one rotor is adjusted to spin slightly faster than the other, it induces yaw (turning motion).|$|R
50|$|A {{helicopter}} is a rotorcraft whose rotors {{are driven}} by the engine(s) throughout the flight to allow the helicopter to take off vertically, hover, fly forwards, backwards and laterally, {{as well as to}} land vertically. Helicopters have several different configurations of one or more <b>main</b> <b>rotors.</b>|$|R
5000|$|QF26-1 is a {{development}} of earlier QF-260 series and has identical layout {{with that of}} QF-260 series. One of the improvement is that the FCS is modified to allow different sizes of <b>main</b> <b>rotors</b> to be used based on customer requirement, and the incorporation of GPS. Specification: ...|$|R
25|$|Improved {{version with}} four bladed <b>main</b> <b>rotor.</b> Designation reused for a planned Mi-2 derivative.|$|E
25|$|The {{convertiplane}} {{featured a}} single Continental-built R-975 radial piston engine that powered twin air compressors. The compressors pumped air via ducts to the <b>main</b> <b>rotor</b> for vertical flight, while the engine drove the two-bladed pusher propeller for horizontal flight. During forward flight the wing provided 80% of the lift {{with the remainder}} generated by the <b>main</b> <b>rotor</b> autorotating at about 50% of normal rpm. When in hover mode, the rotor turned at 410 RPM but slowed to 180 RPM for high-speed flight above 125 knots.|$|E
25|$|The UH-1H's dynamic {{components}} include the engine, transmission, rotor mast, <b>main</b> <b>rotor</b> blades, tail rotor driveshaft, and the 42-degree and 90-degree gearboxes. The transmission is of a planetary type {{and reduces the}} engine's output to 324 rpm at the <b>main</b> <b>rotor.</b> The two-bladed, semi-rigid rotor design, with pre-coned and underslung blades, is a development of early Bell model designs, such as the Bell 47 with which it shares common design features, including a dampened stabilizer bar. The two-bladed system reduces storage space required for the aircraft, but {{at a cost of}} higher vibration levels. The two-bladed design is also responsible for the characteristic 'Huey thump' when the aircraft is in flight, which is particularly evident during descent and in turning flight. The tail rotor is driven from the main transmission, via the two directional gearboxes which provide a tail rotor speed approximately six times that of the <b>main</b> <b>rotor</b> to increase tail rotor effectiveness.|$|E
5000|$|Wind {{moving in}} the same {{direction}} as the tail rotor moves air. With pusher tail-rotors, that is wind from the opposite side of the tail-rotor. With puller tail-rotors, that is wind from the same side as the tail <b>rotor.</b> For <b>main</b> <b>rotors</b> with clockwise rotation (European), that is wind from 3 o'clock. For <b>main</b> <b>rotors</b> with counter-clockwise rotation, that is wind from 9 o'clock. The wind going through the tail rotor causes an actual stall condition as it decreases the effective airspeed of the air through the tail rotor. This condition will cause an unintended yaw that may develop into a spin. Recovery from this condition may be difficult if no airspeed is available, and will require entry into an autorotation (thus removing the torque of the engine and transmission).|$|R

The aircraft had a standard empty weight of [...] It featured two coaxial <b>main</b> <b>rotors,</b> a single-seat open cockpit without a windshield, skid-type landing gear and two twin-cylinder, air-cooled, two-stroke, dual-ignition [...] Hirth 2706 engines.|$|R
50|$|The Kamov Ka-50, which entered {{limited service}} with Russian forces in 1995, {{was the first}} {{production}} helicopter with an ejection seat. The system {{is similar to that}} of a conventional fixed-wing aircraft however the <b>main</b> <b>rotors</b> are equipped with explosive bolts to jettison the blades moments before the seat is fired.|$|R
25|$|The Matra-Cantinieau MC-101 was {{an early}} 1950s French {{experimental}} two seat helicopter of conventional tail rotor configuration but with its engine mounted close to the <b>main</b> <b>rotor,</b> above the seating.|$|E
25|$|The SH09 is a light-medium helicopter, {{powered by}} a single Honeywell HTS900 {{turboshaft}} engine. It uses a shrouded fenestron tail rotor and the <b>main</b> <b>rotor</b> features a five-bladed bearingless hub; the shrouded tail rotor has a wider diameter and a thinner chord {{in order to increase}} airflow, while design aspects such as a narrow tail boom, swept-back tips on the <b>main</b> <b>rotor</b> blades, and the shrouded tail rotor purposefully reduce the SH09's noise signature. The HTS900 is capable of providing 1,020-shaft-horsepower, which is reportedly enough to produce high performance levels for the SH09 under hot and high conditions.|$|E
25|$|Upgraded French Army {{and export}} version with Turbomeca Turmo IVC engines and {{composite}} <b>main</b> <b>rotor</b> blades. Designated SA 330Ba by the French Air Force. All surviving French Army SA 330Bs converted to this standard.|$|E
5000|$|The Eagle's Perch was {{designed}} {{to comply with the}} US Experimental - Amateur-built aircraft rules. The aircraft had a standard empty weight of 240 lb. It featured two coaxial <b>main</b> <b>rotors,</b> a single-seat open cockpit without a windshield, skid-type landing gear and two twin-cylinder, air-cooled, two-stroke, dual-ignition [...] Hirth 2706 engines.|$|R
2500|$|... "The Quiet One" [...] {{was quietly}} removed from its spy mission. Upon its {{return to the}} U.S., it was {{stripped}} of most of its special features before disposition. However, its legacy lives on in such features as its modified <b>main</b> <b>rotors</b> and scissor-type rear rotors on later helicopters, both found on the AH-64 Apache.|$|R
5000|$|Tandem / Transverse rotors: to use two {{non-overlapping}} <b>main</b> <b>rotors</b> which turn {{in opposite}} directions, {{so that the}} torque created by one rotor cancels out the torque created by the other. Such a design is commonly seen on heavy lift helicopters like the tandem rotored CH-47 Chinook and effectively with the tiltrotor configuration V-22 Osprey.|$|R
