25|$|An {{investigation}} into the crash found the cause to be pilot error by the captain. Failure to receive the outer <b>marker</b> <b>beacon</b> signal (probably due to a fault that had developed in the receiver) was a contributory factor.|$|E
25|$|The {{radio range}} system had {{recently}} been calibrated twice and the commission found {{nothing wrong with the}} navigational aids. On the other hand, the aircraft's equipment had been turned to compass instead of antenna. This would have made the beam north of the cone of silence twenty degrees wide instead of four. Although not decisive, it was cited as giving the pilot a disadvantage in navigation. The aircraft's radio range equipment also lacked a <b>marker</b> <b>beacon</b> receiver, due to lack of sufficient parts. This forced the pilots to manually calculate the distance to the beacon. The crew carried out the procedural turn in the right area, but should, according to their route instruction book, have been at no lower an altitude than , thus the aircraft was too low, caused by the let-down being started too early.|$|E
500|$|The {{aircraft}} was using instrument flight rules (IFR) and Torghatten {{was covered in}} fog. The visibility was within the permitted range of IFR. The commission found five errors on Widerøe's maps which could have influenced the accident. This included a formulation which gave the impression that DMR was not in use; a closed [...] "Torget" [...] <b>marker</b> <b>beacon</b> {{was still on the}} maps; a vertical flight plan from Lekan was not included; the height limitations in the accident area were noted through comments rather than through a graphical presentation; and confusion as to when the timing of final approach should start. The commission also criticized the airline for its checklists instructing the pilots to one of VHF channels to the company frequency during descent, at a time when non-safety-related communication is unwanted.|$|E

5000|$|FuBL 1 Used the Lorenz {{landing beam}} system. Consisted of the EBL 1 and EBL 2 {{receivers}} with display device ANF 2. The EBL 1 operated between 30 and 33 MHz {{and received the}} azimuth signals from a transmitter {{at the far end}} of the runway, The EBL 2 operated at 38 MHz and received the two <b>marker</b> <b>beacons</b> as the aircraft approached the threshold to land. The AFN 2 provided the pilot with a left/right display and a signal strength. The pilot could also hear the azimuth signal and the <b>marker</b> <b>beacons</b> in his headset. When the aircraft passed over the beacons a light was also illuminated in the cockpit.` ...|$|R
500|$|On {{the night}} of the 3 March 1943 the Luftwaffe was active again. Cunningham {{scrambled}} too late to get contact with the GCI's contact. He climbed toward a searchlight box. The searchlights operated in a box-shape, separated by evenly spaced markers. Each fighter was given a box and flew to its allotted <b>marker</b> <b>beacon.</b> There he orbited until the lights illuminated a target, or formed a cone where he could pick up an AI contact. Soon he had a contact—a Dornier Do 217. He closed in but his cannons jammed. After sitting behind the Dornier for some time and trying in vain to encourage the guns to fire, the German crew suddenly woke up and dived away. Cunningham was furious. Three-quarters of the squadron got airborne but only he had seen an enemy. Unsatisfied with ground and aircrews, he used his influence in the small night-fighter community to bring in personnel from his old unit, 604, currently languishing in Cornwall. With the new VIII radar a uniform facility, Cunningham took command of a Mosquito NF.XII—the first Mosquito to have a smooth [...] "bluff" [...] nose dome over the dish antenna.|$|E
2500|$|The {{doors closed}} at 15:58 and at 16:00 Key {{requested}} pushback. At 16:03 BE 548 was cleared to taxi to the holding point {{adjacent to the}} start of Runway 27 Right. During taxi, at 16:06 the flight received its departure route clearance: a routing known as the [...] "Dover One Standard Instrument Departure". This Standard Instrument Departure involved taking-off to the west over the Instrument Landing System localiser and middle <b>marker</b> <b>beacon</b> of the reciprocal Runway 09 Left, turning left to intercept the 145° bearing to the Epsom Non-Directional Beacon (NDB) (to be passed at [...] or more), and then proceeding to Dover. Key advised the tower that he was ready for take-off and was cleared to do so. He subsequently reported an unspecified technical problem and remained at the holding point for two minutes to resolve it.|$|E
2500|$|After the {{cancellation}} of its airmail contracts, the airline industry underwent a drastic shake-up and emerged in late 1934 and throughout 1935 with new leadership but countless pressing problems, the most serious of which was its poor economic condition. Fourteen scheduled air carriers {{decided to leave the}} manufacturer-dominated Aeronautical Chamber of Commerce and form the Air Transport Association of America with its headquarters in Chicago, Illinois. Gorrell was invited to be its first president. He dropped his California housing venture and assumed his new role on January 14, 1936. In introducing himself to the press, Gorrell predicted four improvements in the industry by 1938: standardization of aircraft, the introduction of four-engined transports capable of speeds of 250mph, new safety equipment, and trans-Atlantic passenger service. Although the last did not begin until June 1939 and four-engined transports were not put into general service until 1940, Gorrell's vision immediately put the ATA on a [...] "paying basis" [...] with the industry. Gorrell appeared before hearings of the Copeland Committee on airline safety in February 1936 and his pledge of immediate improvement in safety began to be fulfilled when on December 31, 1936, he announced that the Bureau of Air Commerce had allocated ten million dollars of its appropriations to finance a system of radio <b>marker</b> <b>beacon</b> stations along scheduled airline routes.|$|E
50|$|The DME/N or DME/P is an {{integral}} part of the MLS and is installed at all MLS facilities unless a waiver is obtained. This occurs infrequently and only at outlying, low density airports where <b>marker</b> <b>beacons</b> or compass locators are already in place.|$|R
5000|$|The LOM is {{becoming}} less important now that GPS navigation {{is well established}} in the aviation community. [...] Some countries, such as Canada, have abandoned <b>marker</b> <b>beacons</b> completely, replacing the outer marker with a non-directional beacon (NDB); and, more recently, with GPS fixes.|$|R
50|$|The term {{fan marker}} {{refers to the}} older type of beacons used mostly for {{en-route}} navigation. Fan-type <b>marker</b> <b>beacons</b> were sometimes part of a non-precision approach and are identified by a flashing white light and a repeating dot-dash-dot signal. Recent editions of the FAA's AIM publication no longer mention fan markers.|$|R

50|$|Flight 128 {{departed}} Los Angeles at 17:37 Eastern Standard Time {{and operated}} to Cincinnati without incident. The flight was initially scheduled {{to make an}} Instrument Landing System approach to Greater Cincinnati Airport's runway 18. The outer <b>marker</b> <b>beacon</b> for runway 18 was operational, but the middle <b>marker</b> <b>beacon,</b> glide slope, and runway approach lights were inoperative. Under these conditions, proper procedure would be to maintain the minimum approach altitude of 1,290 feet {{above mean sea level}} until the pilots made visual contact with the runway.|$|E
50|$|The AN/MRN-3 was a <b>marker</b> <b>beacon</b> set {{used by the}} Army Air Force {{during and}} after World War II, it was {{standardized}} 23 October 1943, and replaced SCR-241.|$|E
25|$|Radio {{aeronautical}} navigation aids (Navaids) {{use other}} frequencies. Non-directional beacons (NDB)s operate on low frequency and medium frequency bands between 190–415kHz and 510–535kHz. The Instrument landing system (ILS) glide path operates in the UHF frequency range of 329.3–335.0MHz with <b>marker</b> <b>beacons</b> at 75 MHZ. Distance Measuring Equipment (DME) also uses UHF from 962–1150MHz.|$|R
50|$|Aircraft use DME to {{determine}} their distance from a land-based transponder by sending and receiving pulse pairs - two pulses of fixed duration and separation. The ground stations are typically collocated with VORs or ILS systems. A low-power DME can be collocated with an ILS glide slope antenna installation where it provides an accurate distance to touchdown function, similar to that otherwise provided by ILS <b>marker</b> <b>beacons.</b>|$|R
50|$|From the 1930s {{until the}} 1950s, markers were used {{extensively}} along airways {{to provide an}} indication of an aircraft's specific position along the route, but from the 1960s they have become increasingly limited to ILS approach installations. They are now very gradually being phased out of service, especially in more developed parts of the world, as GPS and other technologies have made <b>marker</b> <b>beacons</b> increasingly obsolete.|$|R

50|$|According to Article 1.107 of the International Telecommunication Union´s (ITU) ITU Radio Regulations (RR) a <b>marker</b> <b>beacon</b> {{is defined}} as A {{transmitter}} in the aeronautical radionavigation service which radiates vertically a distinctive pattern for providing position information to aircraft.|$|E
5000|$|During this time, ARC's [...] "Cessna" [...] {{avionics}} line {{expanded and}} diversified radically to include most types of avionics for light planes, including NAV , COM, ADF , DME and <b>Marker</b> <b>beacon</b> radios and autopilots—all most {{the low end}} of the quality spectrum.|$|E
50|$|The VAR bridged the {{technological}} {{gap between the}} Low-Frequency Radio Range (LFR) radio navigation system and the VHF omnidirectional range (VOR) navigation system. VAR provided four courses for navigation, two using visual instrument signals functionally and technically similar to the modern localizer and backbeam components used in the ILS system and two using audio signals similar to the LFR system. VAR also used <b>marker</b> <b>beacons</b> similar to the ILS.|$|R
50|$|Using VNsight imagery {{blended with}} the {{standard}} M-PNVS forward looking infrared (FLIR) imagery, pilots can see lighting that was previously unviewable in low-light conditions. This includes lasers, <b>markers,</b> <b>beacons,</b> and tracer rounds, which were not accurately registered with the thermal image over the full sensor field of view. The VNsight upgrade ensures safer flying conditions and enhanced mission capability (especially in urban environments) by improving situation awareness in low-light-level conditions and situations where existing light sources cannot be imaged by the FLIR. It also allows the aircrew to see their own laser spot while designating targets for laser guided munition engagements, providing an extra level of certainty that the correct target and aim-point are designated. Enhanced air-to-ground communication reduces the potential for blue on blue incidents.|$|R
50|$|Two small <b>marker</b> <b>beacons</b> {{were also}} used: one 300 m {{off the end}} of runway, the HEZ (Haupteinflugzeichen), and another 3 km away, the VEZ (Voreinflugzeichen), both were {{broadcast}} on 38 MHz and modulated at 1700 and 700 Hz, respectively. These signals were broadcast directly upward, and would be heard briefly as the aircraft flew over them. To approach the runway, the pilot would fly to a published altitude and then use the main directional signals to line up with the runway and started flying toward it. When he flew over the VEZ he would start descending on a standard glide slope, continuing to land or abort at the HEZ depending on whether or not he could see the runway.|$|R
50|$|A <b>marker</b> <b>beacon</b> is a {{particular}} type of VHF radio beacon used in aviation, usually in conjunction with an instrument landing system (ILS), to give pilots a means to determine position along an established route to a destination such as a runway.|$|E
50|$|Each system {{requires}} three <b>marker</b> <b>beacon</b> sets, one to {{be located}} in the airport runway boundary, one at approximately one mile from the approach end of the runway, and one 4.5 miles from the approach end of the runway, all on the center line of the runway to be used. The equipment transmits a vertical pattern to be received by the RC-43, RC-193, or AN/ARN-8, AN/ARN-12. A signal, amplitude modulated at 1,300 cycles per second, may be keyed at two dashes per second, six dots per second, or may be unkeyed. The <b>marker</b> <b>beacon</b> transmitter projects a vertical fan-shaped pattern to a height of approximately 3,000 feet. The transmitter is placed so that the longer horizontal axis is perpendicular to the line of approach.|$|E
50|$|A <b>marker</b> <b>beacon</b> is a {{specialized}} beacon used in aviation {{in conjunction with}} an instrument landing system (ILS), to give pilots a means to determine distance to the runway. Marker beacons transmit on the dedicated frequency of 75 MHz. This type of beacon is slowly being phased-out and most new ILS installations have no marker beacons.|$|E

50|$|Lorenz {{could fly}} a plane down a {{straight}} line with relatively high accuracy, enough so that the aircraft could then find the runway visually {{in all but the}} worst conditions. However it required a fairly constant monitoring of the radio by the pilot, who would often also be tasked with talking to the local control tower. In order to ease the workload, Lorenz later introduced a cockpit indicator that could listen to the signals and display the direction to the runway centerline as an arrow telling the pilot which direction to turn. The indicator also included two neon lamps to indicate when the aircraft crossed over each of the <b>marker</b> <b>beacons.</b> Later derivatives of the system had signals of equal length in the pattern left-right-silence, to operate a visual indicator in the cabin.|$|R
50|$|Distance {{measuring}} equipment (DME) provides pilots with a slant range measurement of {{distance to the}} runway in nautical miles. DMEs are augmenting or replacing markers in many installations. The DME provides more accurate and continuous monitoring of correct progress on the ILS glide slope to the pilot, and does not require an installation outside the airport boundary. When {{used in conjunction with}} an ILS, the DME is often sited midway between the reciprocal runway thresholds with the internal delay modified so that one unit can provide distance information to either runway threshold. For approaches where a DME is specified in lieu of <b>marker</b> <b>beacons,</b> DME Required is noted on the Instrument Approach Procedure and the aircraft must have at least one operating DME unit, or an IFR approved GPS system (an RNAV system meeting TSO-C129/ -C145/-C146), to begin the approach.|$|R
5000|$|A {{back course}} marker (BC) {{normally}} indicates the ILS back course {{final approach fix}} where approach descent is commenced. Its is identified by pairs of morse-code [...] "dots" [...] at 3000 Hz (95 pairs per minute), which will trigger the white light on a <b>marker</b> <b>beacon</b> indicator, but with a different audio rhythm from an inner marker or en route marker.|$|E
50|$|The RC-43-A (BC-357) is a UHF {{receiver}} {{which provides}} a visual indication when flying over a 75-MHz <b>marker</b> <b>beacon.</b> it operates {{in the frequency of}} 67 to 80 MHz. The receiver box is located with other radio equipment and lights a lamp on the pilot's instrument panel when over the beacon. the RC-43 is 24 volts, the RC-39 is 12 volts. the unit uses a fixed wire antenna.|$|E
50|$|Similar to {{the outer}} and middle markers; located at the {{beginning}} (threshold) of the runway on some ILS approach systems (usually Category II and III) having decision heights of less than 200 ft AGL. Triggers a flashing white light on the same <b>marker</b> <b>beacon</b> receiver used for the outer and middle markers; also a series of audio tone 'dots' at a frequency of 3,000 Hz in the headset.|$|E
50|$|The {{purpose of}} the letter beacons is not yet known with certainty. Many {{theories}} have appeared in specialized publications, but none is based on documentary evidence. They have been postulated to be radio propagation <b>beacons,</b> channel <b>markers,</b> or <b>beacons</b> used in tracking satellites or for civil defense purposes. Some stations of this family, in particular the “U” beacon, have been implicated in deliberate jamming.|$|R
25|$|Two fully {{automated}} lighthouses {{operate on the}} island to aid passing maritime traffic: Bathurst Lighthouse and Wadjemup Lighthouse. An extensive network of flashing <b>markers</b> and transit <b>beacons</b> indicate safe passages through the rocky entrances to bays.|$|R
50|$|In 2004 the NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service {{restored}} the lighthouse beacon, {{which is still}} in use and supports operation of a Harbour Navigational Facility, with tide gauge, navigation channel <b>markers,</b> foghorn and <b>beacon,</b> established in the mid-19th century. The Bureau of Meteorology operates a weather facility from the island and publishes observations at half-hourly intervals on its website.|$|R
