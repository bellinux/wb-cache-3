40|$|This {{paper is}} an {{assessment}} of three tilts in U. S. trade policy during the 1980 s: <b>minilateralism,</b> managed trade, and Congressional activism. It describes their economic and political causes, {{and whether or not}} alternative policy directions might have been possible. Taking as given the unfavorable macroeconomic environment for trade policy, a few alternatives do seem possible, but only a few. Sectoral <b>minilateralism</b> might have been a feasible replacement for the more aggressive managed trade experiments, e. g., in semiconductors, and earlier Executive Branch initiative in drafting trade legislation of the late 1980 s might have blunted some of the sharper edges of the Congressional arsenal in the 1988 act. <b>Minilateralism</b> is forecast to have mildly liberalizing effects in the near term. The prognosis for the effects of managed trade and Congressional activism is decidedly more mixed. ...|$|E
40|$|In Minilateralism: How Trade Alliances, Soft Law, and Financial Engineering Are Redefining Economic Statecraft, Professor Chris Brummer {{embraces the}} {{complexity}} of the global economic system and its regulation by exploring the emerging role and dominance of varying strands of economic collaboration and regulation that he collectively refers to as “minilateralism. ” In describing the turn toward <b>minilateralism,</b> Brummer notes a number of key features of this new minilateral system, including a shift away from global cooperation to strategic alliances composed of the smallest group necessary to achieve a particular goal, a turn from formal treaties to informal non-binding accords and other soft law, and the willingness of governments to resort to financial engineering to achieve their goals. While doing so, Brummer’s book explores how and why this shift from multilateralism to <b>minilateralism</b> has occurred, and he discusses the issues associated with managing and shaping the healthy growth and development of this system. He advocates that policymakers and regulators use what he terms “smart minilateralism” to define policy objectives, choose the proper minilateral tools, and legitimize their actions by seeking the support of relevant stakeholders. This Review engages Brummer’s theories, complicates them, and in a variety of instances challenges them. It explores whether the world is merely experiencing the fine tuning of multilateralism, rather than a shift to minilateralism; whether <b>minilateralism</b> is simply better documented today {{than it has been in}} the past, rather than the emerging norm; and whether <b>minilateralism</b> is really a new phenomenon. It also challenges Brummer to offer his readers more on how multilateral and minilateral systems interact, how minilateral legitimacy might be achieved, and what role non-governmental entities do and should play in international economic regulation. In addition, this Review suggests that in various contexts <b>minilateralism</b> is doomed to fail and explores the implications of that failure. Thus, in a style of academic criticism, this Review criticizes the excellent and demands an unattainable level of perfection, especially because it would require Brummer to turn his readable and fully formed text into a multi-volume treatise...|$|E
40|$|In recent years, the {{multilateral}} practice of peacekeeping and peace support operations {{has been growing}} as legitimate instrument to interrupt violence, strengthen security, and protect against gross human rights violations. Invented by the United Nations, peace operations have passed {{through a process of}} change that has given new features to multilateral security. Since the late 1980 s, the number of UN-authorized peace operations has been growing. Also regional organisations have engaged themselves in an unprecedented number of peace support operations. Recently, the European Union has entered into the practice of peacekeeping, and put multilateralism at the centre of its presence in the world political system. This paper reviews political science knowledge on peace operations (especially, the legitimacy and efficacy issues), and examines the hypothesis of the appearance of <b>minilateralism</b> as the consequence of the engagement of regional organisations and actors, like the EU, in peace operations. The hypothesis is tested by comparing the data of the peace missions of three European organisations (EU, OSCE, and NATO) with those of the United Nations. The paper conclusion is that the European states are developing a preference for selective engagement (i. e. <b>minilateralism)</b> in peace operations, and the EU is capable of playing both as multilateral and minilateral security provider...|$|E
40|$|The G 20 forum {{has acted}} to {{crystallise}} important {{changes in the}} architecture of global governance emerging since the 1970 s. This has seen the locus of power shift away from the United Nations (UN) System as smaller and poorer states become increasingly adept at exercising their power within UN structures. Yet it is too simple to set the G 20 against the UN, for example as <b>minilateralism</b> versus multilateralism. While the UN seems increasingly constrained and less relevant, {{it is not about}} to disappear. Moreover, we argue there are two significant obstacles to the G 20 claiming the mantle of dominant global governance institution. First, that <b>minilateralism</b> is still a form of multilateralism, and ultimately subject to the same problems with the generation of consensus if extended, as in the G 20, to include sufficiently diverse state members for a claim of legitimacy. Second, its emergence from the Global Financial Crisis and historical focus on financial governance means its agenda is excessively narrow at a time when food and environmental crises command similar global political significance. We conclude by considering some of the different elements of the emerging G 20 /UN dynamic, and whether this emerging dialectic can enhance prospects for wide ranging reforms to global trade, finance and economic structures that are currently incapable of functioning sustainably or preventing wide scale famine. <br /...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the past}} five years there have been a series of {{significant}} international climate change agreements involving only elite state actors. The Asia-Pacific Partnership on Clean Development and Climate, APEC Sydney Leaders Declaration and US Major Economies Process all displayed a shift towards a model of international climate change governance involving a small group of economically powerful states, to the exclusion of less powerful states and environmental NGOs. The modest result from the UNFCCC COP 15 meeting in Copenhagen in December 2009 and subsequent UNFCCC meetings has strengthened calls for international climate governance to be pared down to smaller decision making forums of key states only. This article argues that these developments evidence an emerging discourse of ‘exclusive minilateralism’ in international climate policy that is challenging the inclusive multilateral discourse that has formed the bedrock of international climate change governance since the inception of UN climate regime in the early 1990 s. The exclusive <b>minilateralism</b> discourse offers a significant challenge to both the cosmopolitan and discursive democratic aspirations of international climate change governance. One response to the exclusive minilateral discourse is to reform the UNFCCC consensus-based decision making rule to provide the COP with greater ease of decision making on key issues relating to mitigation and adaptation. Another response is to more formally include the exclusive <b>minilateralism</b> discourse within the UNFCCC COP process. This could be achieved by forming a small peak body of states and key NGO groups to act as an influential advisor to the COP process on key issues requiring expedition and resolution...|$|E
40|$|Although {{there is}} {{increasing}} divergence among the trade policies of various Latin American nations, overall {{the last twenty years}} have seen a dramatic shift away from protectionism towards liberalization. Focusing on case studies of four Latin American nations — Brazil, Mexico, Chile and Argentina — the authors use an analytical framework to explain the rationales behind divergent policies. The analytical approach used considers the combination of economic, political and strategic objectives of policymakers in each country. Four governance modes of trade are used to categorize and describe the trade policies of each country: unilateralism, bilateralism, <b>minilateralism</b> (limited multilateralism, as in regional trade accords like Mercosur), and broader multilateralism (virtually unlimited membership arrangements like WTO). While the four countries share similar levels of economic and social development and have all moved towards trade liberalization, their trade preferences vary substantially and reflect not only economic orientations but also the political and security aims of each. The article ends by posing several questions for further exploration...|$|E
40|$|Sweden- {{in peace}} {{operations}} {{organized by the}} United Nations, the European Union, and two additional European organisations, NATO and OSCE. The objective of the paper is testing the attachment of Europe and EU member states to multilateralism {{in the area of}} international security. In the first section, the propensity of states to participating in peace operations is discussed. In the second section, the four European countries ’ attributes relevant to this propensity (i. e. politics, economy, population, and international position) are briefly presented. Third and fourth sections analyze the participation of the four countries in the peace operations of, respectively, the United Nations, and the three European organisations. The overall conclusion of the paper is that the population size, economic status, and international position/foreign policy culture affect participation in peacekeeping in different manner. The paper also forwards the thesis of the European responsibility in raising <b>minilateralism</b> in security cooperation and peace operations...|$|E
40|$|The {{global warming}} is a {{transnational}} issue by definition that no single country cannot effectively solve by itself. However, it has been ironically proved {{that it has been}} facing enormous difficulty to architect the global cooperative system meeting the challenge because it is transnational issue. This paper employs the concept of multilateralism crafted by John Gerald Ruggie to illustrate the current status of the global warming politics because {{global warming is}} too obviously collective good and cannot be a zero-sum issue. This paper assumes that complete cooperation is ultimately inevitable, but also purports to analyze current international cooperation by using Ruggies concept of multilateralism that has shed lights on nature of cooperation rather than liberal institutionalism emphasizing organizational or norm structures. However, this paper then argues that his argument is still ineffective, and, therefore, this paper also utilizes the concept of <b>minilateralism</b> of Miles Kahler as auxiliary. In so doing, this paper can explain the status of divided multilateralism of global warming from the 1990 s onwards...|$|E
40|$|Gridlock in the {{multilateral}} climate negotiations has created growing scholarly and practical {{interest in the}} use of minilateral forums. A large variety of climate club proposals have been developed in recent years, which promise more effective bargaining among the main climate powers, better incentives to encourage mitigation efforts and discourage free-riding, and new ways to align international power asymmetries with the interests of the global climate regime. I investigate the three dominant rationales that underpin minilateralist proposals. I offer a critical review of their potential as well as their limitations in promoting global climate action. I argue that <b>minilateralism</b> is unlikely to overcome the structural barriers to a comprehensive and ambitious international climate agreement. However, climate clubs can enhance political dialogue in the context of multilateral negotiations and can provide a more conducive environment for great power bargaining. They can create club benefits that strengthen mitigation strategies and help reduce the dangers of free-riding for so-called coalitions of the willing. And they can help re-legitimate the global climate regime against the background of profound power shifts that have slowed down progress in {{the multilateral}} negotiations...|$|E
40|$|One issue {{dominating}} recent {{discussions on}} free trade areas and other minilateral associations (preferential trade arrangements) is whether such arrangements will detract from further multilateral trade liberalization on a most-favored-nation basis. But {{for much of}} this debate empirical information has been lacking on: the global importance of minilateral arrangements that have been, or are being, concluded; the relative size of other major bilateral trade flows not affected by minilateral arrangements, and their suitability for such arrangements; the global importance of Europe in this process; the possibility that other sorts of arrangements - such as managed trade initiatives (arrangements specifying quantitative trade targets) - are a more likely threat as far as trade flows not presently covered by free trade area arrangements are concerned. The authors argue that this lack of relevant data has led to several misconceptions about the movement toward <b>minilateralism.</b> In particular, their statistics suggest that fears about how the further spread of free trade areas will affect world trade volumes may be exaggerated - while the dangers of these blocks becoming hostile to each other may have been underestimated. Using data recently compiled by the United Nations, the authors show that the global importance of minilateral arrangements is now far greater than is often recognized. Almost half of world trade is affected by these arrangements. But major trade flows not covered by minilateral arrangements are dominated by important country-specific problems. In particular, problems relating to high-technology trade between Asian newly industrialized countries (NICs), Japan, and the United States, as well as between Asian NICs, Japan, and Western Europe, are sufficiently important to hinder the formation of additional free trade areas. This suggests that fears about the spread of such arrangements may have been exaggerated. The authors'tabulations and analysis of the discriminatory trade barriers applied to these flows indicate that managed trade is a far more likely outcome.
