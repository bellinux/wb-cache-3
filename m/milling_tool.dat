The {{chemical}} vapor deposition (CVD) {{diamond and}} diamond-like carbon (DLC) films are deposited on the cobalt cemented tungsten carbide (WC-Co) cutting tools respectively using the hot filament {{chemical vapor deposition}} (HFCVD) technique and the vacuum arc discharge with a graphite cathode. The scanning electron microscope (SEM), optical interferometer profiler and Raman spectroscopy were adopted to characterize the as-deposited diamond and DLC films. The cutting performance of as-fabricated CVD diamond and DLC coated milling tools is evaluated in dry milling SiC particulate reinforced Al-metal matrix composite material (Al/SiC-MMCs), comparing with the uncoated WC-Co <b>milling</b> <b>tool.</b> The milling results demonstrate that the uncoated WC-Co <b>milling</b> <b>tool</b> suffers severest wear in its circumferential cutting edge, while the wear of DLC coated <b>milling</b> <b>tool</b> is slightly lower.
