5|$|Several hormone {{deficiencies}} {{associated with}} hypopituitarism <b>may</b> <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> secondary diseases. For instance, growth hormone deficiency {{is associated with}} obesity, raised cholesterol and the metabolic syndrome, and estradiol deficiency <b>may</b> <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> osteoporosis. While effective treatment of the underlying hormone deficiencies may improve these risks, it is often necessary to treat them directly.|$|E

5|$|The {{most common}} {{conditions}} associated with thrombophilia are {{deep vein thrombosis}} (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), which are referred to collectively as venous thromboembolism (VTE). DVT usually occurs in the legs, and is characterized by pain, swelling and redness of the limb. It <b>may</b> <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> long-term swelling and heaviness due to damage to valves in the veins. The clot may also break off and migrate (embolize) to arteries in the lungs. Depending on the size {{and the location of}} the clot, this <b>may</b> <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> sudden-onset shortness of breath, chest pain, palpitations and may be complicated by collapse, shock and cardiac arrest.|$|E
5|$|Accelerated {{deposition}} of cholesterol {{in the walls}} of arteries leads to atherosclerosis, the underlying cause of cardiovascular disease. The most common problem in FH {{is the development of}} coronary artery disease (atherosclerosis of the coronary arteries that supply the heart) at a much younger age than would be expected in the general population. This <b>may</b> <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> angina pectoris (chest pain or tightness on exertion) or heart attacks. Less commonly, arteries of the brain are affected; this <b>may</b> <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> transient ischemic attacks (brief episodes of weakness {{on one side of the}} body or inability to talk) or occasionally stroke. Peripheral artery occlusive disease (obstruction of the arteries of the legs) occurs mainly in people with FH who smoke; this can cause pain in the calf muscles during walking that resolves with rest (intermittent claudication) and problems due to a decreased blood supply to the feet (such as gangrene).|$|E
5|$|Although the convulsions {{caused by}} {{central nervous system}} oxygen {{toxicity}} <b>may</b> <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> incidental injury to the victim, it remained uncertain for many years whether damage to the nervous system following the seizure could occur and several studies searched for evidence of such damage. An overview of these studies by Bitterman in 2004 concluded that following removal of breathing gas containing high fractions of oxygen, no long-term neurological damage from the seizure remains.|$|E

5|$|An acute nosebleed may {{be managed}} {{with a variety}} of measures, such as packing of the nasal cavity with {{absorbent}} swabs or gels. Removal of the packs after the bleeding <b>may</b> <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> reopening of the fragile vessels, and therefore lubricated or atraumatic packing is recommended. Some patients may wish to learn packing themselves to deal with nosebleeds without having to resort to medical help.|$|E
5|$|If genetic {{differentiation}} between populations develops, gene flow between populations can introduce traits or alleles which are disadvantageous {{in the local}} population and this <b>may</b> <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> organisms within these populations evolving mechanisms that prevent mating with genetically distant populations, eventually resulting in the appearance of new species. Thus, exchange of genetic information between individuals is fundamentally important {{for the development of}} the biological species concept.|$|E

5|$|It <b>may</b> <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> nosebleeds, {{acute and}} chronic {{digestive}} tract bleeding, and various problems {{due to the}} involvement of other organs. Treatment focuses on reducing bleeding from blood vessel lesions, and sometimes surgery or other targeted interventions to remove arteriovenous malformations in organs. Chronic bleeding often requires iron supplements and sometimes blood transfusions. HHT is transmitted in an autosomal dominant fashion, and occurs in one in 5,000 people.|$|E
5|$|Long-standing {{elevated}} {{uric acid}} levels (hyperuricemia) {{may result in}} other symptoms, including hard, painless deposits of uric acid crystals known as tophi. Extensive tophi <b>may</b> <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> chronic arthritis due to bone erosion. Elevated levels of uric acid may also lead to crystals precipitating in the kidneys, resulting in stone formation and subsequent urate nephropathy.|$|E

5|$|Private {{entrepreneurs}} sometimes {{resort to}} heavy advertising {{as a means}} of attracting buyers for their products.

The demand merely shifts from one provider to another. Clearly, this is not a long-term solution.|$|E
5|$|Renal disease <b>may</b> <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> hyperparathyroidism. When {{too much}} calcium is lost, {{there is a}} {{compensation}} by the parathyroid, and parathyroid hormone is released. The glands hypertrophy to synthesise more parathyroid hormone. This is known as secondary hyperparathyroidism. If this situation exists for a prolonged period of time, the parathyroid tissue may become unresponsive to the blood calcium levels, and begin to autonomously release parathyroid hormone. This is known as tertiary hyperparathyroidism.|$|E
