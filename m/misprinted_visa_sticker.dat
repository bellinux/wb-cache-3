50|$|As {{the status}} of Kosovo was and remains controversial, the {{document}} was not widely accepted. For those countries that did accept it, its non-passport status sometimes restricted its applications.

50|$|People who {{are granted}} {{permanent}} residency {{in a country}} are usually issued some sort of documentary evidence as legal proof of this status. In the past, many countries merely stamped the person's passport indicating that the holder was admitted as a permanent resident or that he/she was exempt from immigration control and permitted to work without restriction. Other countries would issue a photo ID card, place a <b>visa</b> <b>sticker</b> or certificate of residence in the person's passport, or issue a letter to confirm their permanent resident status.|$|R

2500|$|In {{response}} to persistent demands for dual citizenship, {{particularly from the}} diaspora in North America and other developed countries, the Overseas Citizenship of India (OCI) scheme was introduced by amending The Citizenship Act, 1955 in August 2005. The scheme was launched during the Pravasi Bharatiya Divas convention at Hyderabad in 2006. Indian authorities have interpreted the law to mean a person cannot have a second country's passport simultaneously with an Indian one — even {{in the case of}} a child who is claimed by another country as a citizen of that country, and who may be required by the laws of the other country to use one of its passports for foreign travel (such as a child born in the United States or in Australia to Indian parents), and the Indian courts have given the executive branch wide discretion over this matter. Therefore, Overseas Citizenship of India is not an actual citizenship of India and thus, does not amount to dual citizenship or dual nationality or anyone no longer to use Indian IDs after OCI. Moreover, the OCI card is not a substitute for an Indian visa and therefore, the passport which displays the lifetime visa must be carried by OCI holders while travelling to India.OCI Cards are now being printed without the lifelong “U” <b>Visa</b> <b>Sticker</b> (which is normally pasted on the applicant's passport). [...] The proof of lifelong visa will be just the OCI Card which will have “Life Time Visa” printed on it. [...] The OCI Card will be valid with any Valid Passport."However, countries may consider the OCI as dual citizenship: for example, the UK government considers that, for purposes of the British Nationality Act 1981, [...] "OCI is considered to be citizenship of another State".|$|R
