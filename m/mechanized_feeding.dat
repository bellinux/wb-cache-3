50|$|In 1987 China had {{the largest}} {{inventory}} of hogs in the world. The number increased from about 88 million in 1955 to an estimated 331 million in 1985. Hogs are raised in large numbers {{in every part of}} China except in Muslim areas in the northwest. Most hogs are raised in pens by individual farm households, but in the mid-1980s the Chinese were constructing large <b>mechanized</b> <b>feeding</b> operations on the outskirts of major cities. Before the 1980s the state's major goal was to increase output with little regard to the ratio of meat to fat. In the 1980s consumers became more conscious of fat content, and breeders and raisers were shifting to the production of leaner hogs.|$|E
5000|$|Paint-filled pellets {{are also}} available, called [...] "paintballs", {{which are very}} similar to those used in paintball. Airsoft models {{equipped}} with the hop-up projectile stabilizing system are not able to use these, as the thin shells are liable to break in the barrel, soiling it with paint. These special pellets are also incompatible with airsoft models using <b>mechanized</b> <b>feeding</b> systems, such as high capacity magazines, for the same reason. With some companies, the use of paintballs voids the airsoft gun's warranty; paint may get into the mechanical workings of the airsoft gun and damage parts beyond simple maintenance. These issues may be fixed by removing the hop-up unit, which can void the warranty, and also switching to a low or mid-capacity magazine with no mechanized feed.|$|E
40|$|To improve {{animal health}} and welfare of veal calves, since 1997, the European Union made {{mandatory}} the provision of a minimum daily amount (50 to 250 g) of fibrous feed in addition to the milk replacer diet. However more recently, the high costs of milk replacer ingredients have become an economic incentive {{to increase the amount of}} fibrous feed provided to the calves as partial substitute of the milk replacer. Solid feed provision has been shown to decrease abnormal behaviours such as oral stereotypes and improving calves rumination and rumen development. Moreover, increasing labour cost and herd sizes of the Italian veal sector have supported a growing interest by the calf producers towards the mechanization of the solid feed delivery. The main purpose of this paper is to show how the implementation of <b>mechanized</b> <b>feeding</b> systems can improve feed intake control, feeding rate and delivery efficiency if compared to the manual delivery of the solid portion of calves diet. Indeed, manual feeding is the most diffused system in veal calves dairy farm but exhibits many disadvantages in terms of distribution homogeneity and labour costs for the livestock farm. The study focuses on the results of an electric self-propelled prototype tested in a veal calves farm, allowing mixing of all solid feed ingredients and control of the weight of the feed delivered to each manger. It is shown how nutritional homogeneity can be improved, reducing deviations by a factor of 4 with respect to manual delivery in the case of crude protein and neutral detergent fiber. Additionally it is shown how single ration quantity variability can be reduced from over 30 % in the case of manual delivery to less than 10 % in the case of mechanized delivery...|$|E
40|$|Abstract [...] - Modern {{production}} techniques demand {{high degree of}} automation in feeding and handling of individual components. Where the amount of production equipment has allowed machining times to be reduced in many processes, at the same time, feeding operations are still manually carried out {{which means that the}} handling of components accounts for a greater proportion of overall working cycle time. <b>Mechanized</b> part <b>feeding</b> has thus become an indispensable part of today’s automated assembly lines where feeding of small parts in a preferred orientation is of paramount importance. The conventional vibratory bowl feeder used in the industry is capable of feeding a variety of parts but is usually used for feeding one particular type of component to a particular assembly line. Situations occur where there are multiple assembly lines running in parallel carrying different components. Each line has a dedicated feeding system supplying components to the same. In case the variety of parts to be fed is large then this system of having different feeders for different parts is not feasible. The aim of our work is to design, fabricate and analyze the performance of an agile feeding system, which eliminates the need for multiple feeding systems and replaces it by a single unit. Our system consists of a vibratory bowl part feeder and a pneumatic programmable system integrated with it for identifying the different parts, sorting them and feeding them to their desired locations. The Agile feeding system being developed will be able to successfully sort parts based on their shapes using the Area Detection algorithm...|$|R
40|$|The laying-hen {{industry}} in the United States has been under pressure to change or modify the conventional housing systems. Traditionally, hens have been kept in conventional cages inside environmentally-controlled buildings. These cages are stacked wire mesh enclosures with <b>mechanized</b> egg collection, <b>feed</b> and water delivery systems. Over the past decade {{there has been much}} pressure to improve the welfare of the hens by replacing conventional cages with alternative housing systems. There are a number of alternative housing options under consideration or being used. In the cage free system the birds have access to the floor, but are limited to the inside of a barn. The aviary system monitored in this study is a subset of this cage-free system where a tiered structure is used to increase space allocation to the hen while accommodating more hens (than a single level barn). The aviary system also use <b>mechanized</b> egg collection, <b>feed</b> and water delivery systems similar to traditional barns. When the studies described in this dissertation were started, information on the aviary system seemed quite valuable, but the timeliness of the data has become even more apparent over the last few years. Where some states had previously been dealing with transitions to lower stocking densities (fewer hens per unit of area) or alternative systems, there is now an agreement on the table that may bring this transition to a national level. Because the aviary system is so different from conventional housing, there are questions about the impact and performance of such a system. The most obvious difference in all alternative housing, including aviaries, is the lower stocking density. With the lower stocking density, there are many questions about the correct management of houses, especially in winter. The potential issue with ventilation for indoor air quality at the lower stocking density is the possible need for supplemental heat and its proper distribution in the house. This dissertation looks at this issue from many different angles including ventilation rate, indoor air quality, heat and moisture production of the birds, fuel usage, and the birds 2 ̆ 7 preference for winter temperature-ammonia combinations. With the lower stocking density there is also a concern that the labor and utilities provided on a per bird basis will be higher. Another concern with the systems is that a portion of manure from the birds is held in the house on the floor as litter. The litter on the floor impacts indoor air quality. The ammonia and dust concentrations and emissions were two of the major concerns with regard to the litter. With the aviary system, the birds have the ability to be more active. There are questions about how this activity level impacts the heat and moisture production rates of these birds. Overall, there is very little information on the aviary system in the United States. This dissertation aims to address these questions and concerns...|$|R
40|$|Mechanization of Swedish {{agriculture}} {{started in}} the beginning of the twentieth century, to be able to have more animals without raising the number of employers. The horse business has not by far kept up with these cost savings solutions. Cleaning out stables and feeding horses are the most time-consuming tasks in horse stables today. The most common way to clean out the stable is still by shovel and wheelbarrow. The clean out process can easily be mechanized through semi- permanently beds with movable walls between the boxes so that the litter can be removed by a tractor or a loader. Other ways to simplify manure handling is to mechanize the transport of manure to the storage slab by installing rail-mounted carts or to have scrapers in culverts under the stable floor. A new system on the market for horse stables is Moving Floor™. The floor in the box is moved by compressed air whilst the horse is outdoors during the day, and both the moving of the floor and the filling of litter are controlled by a processor. The feeding process can be mechanized by automatic concentrate feeders or automatic rail-mounted carts, even though the latter still is unusual in horse stables. Loose housing is a way of keeping horses that meets their natural behaviour, and it becomes more common in Sweden. One type of combination of loose housing and <b>mechanized</b> cleaning and <b>feeding</b> is activating stable. The investment costs of these systems are paying off in 0, 4 - 5, 1 years in a stable with 30 horses. Common costs like processors, culverts and rails make it economically possible for large stables to have a higher level of mechanization...|$|R
