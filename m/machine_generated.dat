2500|$|Even {{in early}} {{experimental}} runs, the team started introducing deuterium gas {{to the mix}} and began increasing the current to 200,000amps. On the evening of 30 August the <b>machine</b> <b>generated</b> huge numbers of neutrons, {{on the order of}} one million per [...] "shot". An effort to duplicate the results and eliminate possible measurement failure followed. Much of this depended on the temperature of the plasma; if the temperature was low the neutrons would not be fusion related. Spectrographic measurements suggested plasma temperatures between 1 and 5 million K, much lower than the 100 million K needed for high rates of fusion, but within a factor of two of theoretical predictions of the fusion rate at that temperature. It appeared that ZETA had reached the long-sought goal of producing small numbers of fusion reactions, as it was designed to do.|$|E
2500|$|Many NFL players {{commented on}} the ending, {{including}} several Packers players. Green Bay offensive lineman T. J. Lang tweeted after the game, [...] "Got fucked by the refs.. Embarrassing. Thanks nfl." [...] He later added, [...] "Fuck it NFL.. Fine me and {{use the money to}} pay the regular refs," [...] a message that was re-tweeted 92,314 times on September 26, breaking a Twitter record. Lang openly admitted that his team was considering going on strike if the lockout was not resolved. Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers responded by saying, [...] "First of all, I've got to do something that the NFL is not going to do: I have to apologize to the fans. Our sport is a multi-billion dollar <b>machine,</b> <b>generated</b> by people who pay good money to come watch us play. The product on the field is not being complemented by an appropriate set of officials. The games are getting out of control."
