25|$|In 1977, a {{graduate}} student in the computer science department named Bill Joy (MS 1982) assembled the original Berkeley Software Distribution, commonly known as BSD Unix. Joy, who went on to co-found Sun Microsystems, also developed the original version of the terminal console editor vi, while Ken Arnold (BA 1985) created Curses, a terminal control library for Unix-like systems that enables the construction of text user interface (TUI) applications. Working alongside Joy at Berkeley were undergraduates William Jolitz (BS 1997) and his future wife Lynne Jolitz (BA 1989), who together created 386BSD, a version of BSD Unix that runs on Intel CPUs and evolved into the BSD family of free operating systems and the Darwin operating system underlying Apple Mac OS X. Eric Allman (BS 1977, MS 1980) created SendMail, a Unix <b>mail</b> <b>transfer</b> agent that delivers about 12% of the email in the world.|$|E

At that time there was a north to west curve linking the, by then, Midland with the LNWR line. Since it was the crossing of two major lines - one Bristol to Newcastle, the other Euston to Aberdeen - it was important for the Royal <b>Mail</b> <b>transferring</b> upwards of 2000 bags every night.|$|R
2500|$|Many mailbox {{providers}} are also access providers, {{while others are}} not (e.g., Yahoo! Mail, Outlook.com, Gmail, AOL Mail, Po box). [...] The definition given in RFC 6650 covers email hosting services, {{as well as the}} relevant department of companies, universities, organizations, groups, and individuals that manage their mail servers themselves. [...] The task is typically accomplished by implementing Simple <b>Mail</b> <b>Transfer</b> Protocol (SMTP) and possibly providing access to messages through Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP), the Post Office Protocol, Webmail, or a proprietary protocol.|$|E
2500|$|The {{application}} layer includes the protocols used by most applications for providing user services or exchanging application data over the network connections {{established by the}} lower level protocols.

Examples of {{application layer}} protocols include the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), the File Transfer Protocol (FTP), the Simple <b>Mail</b> <b>Transfer</b> Protocol (SMTP), and the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP). Data coded according to application layer protocols are [...] encapsulated into transport layer protocol units (such as TCP or UDP messages), which in turn use lower layer protocols to effect actual data transfer.|$|E
