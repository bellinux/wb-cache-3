5|$|Thus, Bhimsen {{was able}} to {{continue}} making all the administrative decisions of the country, while the Regent Queen Tripurasundari would unquestioningly approve these decisions by stamping the royal seal issued {{in the name of}} King Rajendra on these government orders. The Regent never dared to express any doubts regarding Bhimsen's decisions. Nevertheless, {{to make sure that the}} King, his wives – Samrajya Laxmi Devi (senior) and Rajya Lakshmi Devi (junior) – and the Regent were insulated from influences of people other than Bhimsen and his closest relatives, Bhimsen had instated his youngest brother, General Ranbir Singh Thapa, in the royal palace to keep a watch on the royal family and to keep guard against any outside person. Any priest or courtier who wished to be granted an interview with the King, the Queens, or the Regent, had to get an approval from Ranbir Singh and the interview had to be conducted under his watchful presence. Similarly, the royal family were not allowed to leave the palace without Bhimsen's permission either. Bhimsen had also neglected the formal education of Rajendra, due to which he had grown to be uncritical and weak minded to the extent that he was even unaware that he was virtually a prisoner. However, his wives were <b>more</b> <b>alert</b> and wary of Bhimsen since, according to Baburam Acharya, they received unfiltered news of the world outside the royal palace from their handmaidens, who would leave the palace compounds and go to their homes during their menstruation and gather news and rumors of the day, which they would then relate to the Queens.|$|E
25|$|The Foundation update {{also adds}} in two new play modes, with the {{original}} gameplay considered as the third, default mode. Survival mode is similar to standard gameplay but the difficulty is much higher—atmospheric effects have larger impact on the exosuit's armour, alien creatures are more hostile, Sentinels are <b>more</b> <b>alert</b> and deadly, and resources tend to be sparse. If a player should die in Survival mode, they must restart {{without being able to}} recover their lost progress, though they still possess their credits, alien language progress, and known blueprints. Creative mode removes much of the mechanics that can kill the player's character, and gives them unlimited resources for constructing bases.|$|E
25|$|Research on high-risk {{settings}} {{such as oil}} platforms, investment banking, medical surgery, aircraft piloting {{and nuclear}} power plants has related distrust to failure avoidance. When non-routine strategies are needed, distrusting persons perform better, while when routine strategies are needed trusting persons perform better. This research was extended to entrepreneurial firms by Gudmundsson and Lechner. They argued that in entrepreneurial firms the threat of failure is ever present resembling non-routine situations in high-risk settings. They found that the firms of distrusting entrepreneurs {{were more likely to}} survive than the firms of optimistic or overconfident entrepreneurs. The reasons were that distrusting entrepreneurs would emphasize failure avoidance through sensible task selection, and more analysis. Kets de Vries has pointed out that distrusting entrepreneurs are <b>more</b> <b>alert</b> about their external environment. He concluded that distrusting entrepreneurs are less likely to discount negative events, {{and are more likely to}} engage control mechanisms. Similarly, Gudmundsson and Lechner found that distrust leads to higher precaution and therefore increases chances of entrepreneurial firm survival.|$|E

40|$|Altered {{anticipation}} {{processes are}} implicated across various clinical samples, but few studies {{focused on the}} posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). We measured contingent negative variation (CNV) in a choice reaction paradigm among 58 survivors of the Wenchuan earthquake, including 28 individuals who were diagnosed with PTSD and 30 without PTSD. Compared to the non-PTSD group, the PTSD group had significantly larger CNV amplitude. On the behavioral level, although the reaction times were comparable between groups, the PTSD group committed more errors than the non-PTSD group. Furthermore, the total PTSD symptom severity score {{as well as the}} re-experiencing symptom score were positively related to CNV amplitude. These results suggested that individuals with PTSD might be <b>more</b> <b>alerted</b> to and anticipate more to upcoming events in their environment, yet still have degraded performance in response to the stimulus.

One hundred Kaiser Permanente primary care clinicians were sent a four-page questionnaire. It contained questions related to the usability and usefulness of different approaches to presenting reminder and alert information. The survey also contained questions about the desirability of six categories of alerts. Forty-three of 100 questionnaires were returned. Users generally preferred an active, more intrusive interaction model for "alerts" and a passive, less intrusive model for order messages and other types of reminders and notifications. Drug related <b>alerts</b> were <b>more</b> highly rated than health maintenance or disease state reminders. Users indicated that <b>more</b> <b>alerts</b> would make the system "more useful" but "less easy to use"...|$|R

2500|$|Robert Sapolsky has {{extensively}} studied baboons {{in their}} natural environment in the Serengeti in Africa. He noticed that baboons have very similar hierarchies in their society as do humans. They spend very few hours searching for food and fulfilling their primary needs leaving them with time to develop their social network. In primates mental stresses {{show up in the}} body. Primates experience psychological stresses that can elicit physiological responses that overtime can make them sick. Sapolsky observed the baboon's ranks, personalities and social affiliations then collected blood samples of the baboons to control the cortisol (stress hormone) levels of the baboons then matched social position to cortisol levels. Most of the data have been collected from male baboons because at any given time 80 percent of the females were pregnant. [...] Three factors influenced a baboon's cortisol levels; friendships, perspective and rank. [...] Baboons that played with infants and cultivated friendships, could tell if a situation was a real threat and could tell {{if they were going to}} win or lose, and were top ranking had lower levels of cortisol. Cortisol levels rise with age and hippocampal cells express fewer hormone receptors on their surface to protect themselves from excess, making it harder to control stress levels. [...] Cortisol levels are elevated in half of people suffering from major depression, it is the hippocampal region that is affected by both. Stress can have negative effects on gastrointestinal function causing ulcers, and it can also decrease sex drive, effect sleeping patterns and elevate blood pressure but it can also stimulate and motivate. When animals experience stress they are generally <b>more</b> <b>alert</b> than when they are not stressed. It may help them be better aware of unfamiliar environments and possible threats to their life in these environments. [...] Yerkes and Dodson developed a law that explains the empirical relationship between arousal and performance illustrated by and inverted U-shape graph. [...] According to the Yerkes-Dodson Law performance increases as does cognitive arousal but only to a certain point. The downward part of the U-shape is caused by stress and as stress increases so does efficiency and performance but to a certain point. [...] When stress becomes too great performance and efficiency decline. Sapolsky has also studied stress in rats and his results indicate that early experiences in young rats have strong, lasting effects. Rats that were exposed to human handling (stressful situation) had finely tuned stress responses that may have lowered their lifetime exposure to stress hormones compared to those that were not handled. In short stress can be adaptive. The more exposure to stressful situations the better the rat can handle that situation.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} is to measure utility of real-time commercial decision making. It is important due to a higher possibility of mistakes in real-time decisions, problems with recording actual occurrences, and significant costs associated with predictions produced by algorithms. The first contribution is to use overall utility and represent individual utility with a monetary value instead of a prediction. The second is to calculate the benefit from predictions using the utility-based decision threshold. The third is to incorporate cost of predictions. For experiments, overall utility is used to evaluate communal and spike detection, and their adaptive versions. The overall utility results show that with fewer alerts, communal detection is better than spike detection. With <b>more</b> <b>alerts,</b> adaptive communal and spike detection are better than their static versions. To maximise overall utility with all algorithms, only 1 % to 4 % in the highest predictions should be alerts. <br /...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} an experimental alerting system under development by the Australian Bureau of Me-teorology, initially targetted at (but not restricted to) the aviation sector. The system provides alert rout-ing and ltering: for example pressure readings from automated weather stations may con ict {{with a local}} terminal aerodrome forecast, resulting in an alert be-ing displayed to forecasters and other interested par-ties (such as airlines or individual aircraft). The multi-agent based design is inherently dis-tributed and readily facilitates scalability and system evolution by simplifying integration of new services and components: for example, adding new types of data sources and/or alerts spanning multiple organ-isations and system platforms. Another key issue is robustness: the system {{must be able to}} adapt to fail-ure of individual components. Further issues that arise concern <b>more</b> user-focussed <b>alert</b> provision: an aircraft may wish to be noti ed about alerts (or new alert types) that concern it, i. e. that take place in certain regions. In this paper we present the design of the system, discuss how the design addresses some of the issues, and outline our plans for supporting <b>more</b> exible <b>alert</b> notication.

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{complexity of}} modern aircraft creates {{a need for}} a larger number of caution and warning devices. But <b>more</b> <b>alerts</b> require <b>more</b> memorization and higher work loads for the pilot and tend to induce a higher probability of errors. Therefore, an architecture for a flight expert system (FLES) to assist pilots in monitoring, diagnosing and recovering from in-flight faults has been developed. A prototype of FLES has been implemented. A sensor simulation model was developed and employed to provide FLES with the airplane status information during the diagnostic process. The simulator is based partly on the Lockheed Advanced Concept System (ACS), a future generation airplane, and partly on the Boeing 737, an existing airplane. A distinction between two types of faults, maladjustments and malfunctions, has led us to take two approaches to fault diagnosis. These approaches are evident in two FLES subsystems: the flight phase monitor and the sensor interrupt handler. The specific problem addressed in these subsystems has been that of integrating information received from multiple sensors with domain knowledge in order to assess abnormal situations during airplane flight. This paper describes the reasons for handling malfunctions and maladjustments separately and the use of domain knowledge in the diagnosis of each...|$|R
