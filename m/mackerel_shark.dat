5|$|Inhabiting {{continental}} {{margins and}} oceanic waters at depths of , the {{bigeye sand tiger}} may make vertical and horizontal migratory movements. It feeds on bony fishes and squid, and its sizable eyes and dark coloration suggest that it may spend most of its time in the mesopelagic zone. Reproduction is probably viviparous with oophagous embryos like in other <b>mackerel</b> <b>shark</b> species. This shark is caught incidentally by commercial fisheries, though so infrequently that the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) cannot yet determine its conservation status.|$|E
5|$|The Whitetip reef shark is {{distributed}} widely {{across the entire}} Indo-Pacific region. It was once thought to have formerly existed in the Atlantic Ocean, based on fossil teeth found in North Carolina dating to the Miocene epoch. However, more recent research indicates that the teeth belonged to a <b>mackerel</b> <b>shark,</b> and that this species has never colonized the Atlantic. In the Indian Ocean, it occurs from northern KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa to the Red Sea and the Indian subcontinent, including Madagascar, Mauritius, the Comoros, the Aldabra Group, the Seychelles, Sri Lanka, and the Chagos Archipelago. In the western and central Pacific, it occurs from off southern China, Taiwan, and the Ryukyu Islands, to the Philippines, Southeast Asia, and Indonesia, to northern Australia, and is also found around numerous islands in Melanesia, Micronesia, and Polynesia, as far as Hawaii {{to the north and}} the Pitcairn Islands to the southeast. In the eastern Pacific, it occurs from Costa Rica to Panama, and off the Gal√°pagos Islands.|$|E

500|$|The {{bigeye sand tiger}} (Odontaspis noronhai) is an {{extremely}} rare species of <b>mackerel</b> <b>shark</b> in the family Odontaspididae, with a possible worldwide distribution. A large, bulky species reaching at least [...] in length, the bigeye sand tiger has a long bulbous snout, large orange eyes without nictitating membranes, and a capacious mouth with the narrow teeth prominently exposed. It can be distinguished from the similar smalltooth sand tiger (O. ferox) by its teeth, which have only one lateral cusplet on each side, and by its uniformly dark brown color.|$|E
500|$|The {{longfin mako}} shark (Isurus paucus) is {{a species of}} <b>mackerel</b> <b>shark</b> in the family Lamnidae, with a {{probable}} worldwide distribution in temperate and tropical waters. An uncommon species, it is typically lumped together under the name [...] "mako" [...] with its better-known relative, the shortfin mako shark (I. oxyrinchus). The longfin mako is a pelagic species found in moderately deep water, having been reported {{to a depth of}} [...] Growing to a maximum length of , the slimmer build and long, broad pectoral fins of this shark suggest that it is a slower and less active swimmer than the shortfin mako.|$|E
500|$|The {{etymology}} of {{the word}} [...] "porbeagle" [...] is obscure. A common suggestion is that it combines [...] "porpoise" [...] and [...] "beagle", referencing this shark's shape and tenacious hunting habits. Another {{is that it is}} derived from the Cornish porth, meaning [...] "harbor", and bugel, meaning [...] "shepherd". The Oxford English Dictionary states that the word was either borrowed from Cornish or formed from a Cornish first element with the English [...] "beagle"; however, none of the proposed Cornish root words is fully satisfactory. The Dictionary also notes that there is no evidence for a connection to the French porc, meaning [...] "swine", or to porpoise, as has been proposed. Other common names for the porbeagle include Atlantic <b>mackerel</b> <b>shark,</b> Beaumaris shark, bottle-nosed shark, and blue dog.|$|E
50|$|<b>Mackerel</b> <b>sharks</b> are {{an order}} which {{includes}} {{some of the}} most familiar species of sharks, such as the great white shark, as well as more unusual representatives, such as the goblin shark and the megamouth shark. Members of the order are distinguished by possessing two dorsal fins, an anal fin, five gill slits, eyes without nictitating membranes, and a mouth extending behind the eyes. <b>Mackerel</b> <b>sharks</b> may also refer specifically to the family Lamnidae.|$|R

50|$|The <b>mackerel</b> <b>sharks</b> {{present the}} most extreme example of {{proximity}} between reproductive eggs and trophic eggs; their viable offspring feed on trophic eggs in utero.|$|R
500|$|The dorsal {{coloration}} is {{a medium}} to dark gray or slate, extending to {{the bases of}} the pectoral fins. The underside is white; adults in the Southern Hemisphere often have dark coloring under the head and dusky blotches scattered over the belly. The free rear tip of the first dorsal fin is abruptly light gray or white, a feature unique to this species. The porbeagle may attain a length of , though this is uncertain and may have resulted from confusion with other <b>mackerel</b> <b>shark</b> species. A more typical length is [...] Female sharks grow larger than males in the North Atlantic, with maximum confirmed fork lengths (snout tip to caudal fin fork) of [...] for males and [...] for females. Southern Hemisphere sharks are smaller and the two sexes are similar in size, with males and females attaining fork lengths of [...] and [...] respectively. Most porbeagles weigh no more than , with the record being a [...] individual caught off Caithness, Scotland in 1993.|$|E
500|$|The {{great white}} shark (Carcharodon carcharias), {{also known as the}} great white, white pointer, white shark, or white death, is a species of large <b>mackerel</b> <b>shark</b> which {{can be found in the}} coastal surface waters of all the major oceans. The {{great white shark}} is notable for its size, with larger female {{individuals}} growing to [...] in length and [...] in weight at maturity.

500|$|The {{porbeagle}} (Lamna nasus) is {{a species}} of <b>mackerel</b> <b>shark</b> in the family Lamnidae, distributed widely {{in the cold and}} temperate marine waters of the North Atlantic and Southern Hemisphere. In the North Pacific, its ecological equivalent is the closely related salmon shark (L.ditropis). The porbeagle typically reaches [...] in length and a weight of North Atlantic sharks grow larger than Southern Hemisphere sharks and differ in coloration and aspects of life history. Gray above and white below, the porbeagle has a very stout midsection that tapers towards the long, pointed snout and the narrow base of the tail. It has large pectoral and first dorsal fins, tiny pelvic, second dorsal, and anal fins, and a crescent-shaped caudal fin. The most distinctive features of this species are its three-cusped teeth, the white blotch at the aft base of its first dorsal fin, and the two pairs of lateral keels on its tail.|$|E
50|$|Lamna is a genus of <b>mackerel</b> <b>sharks</b> in {{the family}} Lamnidae, {{containing}} two extant species: the porbeagle (L. nasus) of the North Atlantic and Southern Hemisphere, and the salmon shark (L. ditropis) of the North Pacific.|$|R
50|$|Examples of {{ovoviviparous}} {{fish are}} many of the squaliform sharks, which include sand <b>sharks,</b> <b>mackerel</b> <b>sharks,</b> nurse sharks, requiem sharks, dog sharks and hammerheads, among others, and the lobe finned coelacanth. Some species of rockfish (Sebastes) and sculpins (Comephoridae) produce rather weak larvae with no egg membrane and are also, by definition, ovoviviparous. Ovoviviparity occurs in most live-bearing bony fishes (Poeciliidae).|$|R
50|$|Sand sharks, {{also known}} as sand tiger sharks, grey nurse sharks or ragged tooth <b>sharks,</b> are <b>mackerel</b> <b>sharks</b> of the family Odontaspididae. They are found {{worldwide}} in temperate and tropical waters. The three species are in two genera.|$|R
500|$|Modern sharks {{began to}} appear about 100 million years ago. Fossil <b>mackerel</b> <b>shark</b> teeth date to the Early Cretaceous. One of the most {{recently}} evolved families is the hammerhead shark (family Sphyrnidae), which emerged in the Eocene. The oldest white shark teeth date from 60 to 66 million years ago, {{around the time of}} the extinction of the dinosaurs. In early white shark evolution there are at least two lineages: one lineage is of white sharks with coarsely serrated teeth and it probably gave rise to the modern great white shark, and another lineage is of white sharks with finely serrated teeth. These sharks attained gigantic proportions and include the extinct megatoothed shark, C. megalodon. Like most extinct sharks, C. megalodon is also primarily known from its fossil teeth and vertebrae. This giant shark reached a total length (TL) of more than [...] C. megalodon may have approached a maxima of [...] in total length and [...] in mass. Paleontological evidence suggests that this shark was an active predator of large cetaceans.|$|E
2500|$|The {{basking shark}} {{is the only}} member of the family Cetorhinidae, part of the <b>mackerel</b> <b>shark</b> order Lamniformes. Gunnerus was the first to {{describe}} and name the species Cetorhinus maximus from a specimen found in Norway. The genus name Cetorhinus comes from the Greek ketos which means marine monster or whale and rhinos meaning nose; the species name maximus is from Latin and means [...] "greatest". In the following centuries there were more attempts at naming: Squalus isodus, in 1819 by Italian Zoologist Saverio Macri (17541848); [...] Squalus elephas, by Lesueur in 1822; Squalus rashleighanus, by Couch in 1838; Squalus cetaceus, by Gronow in 1854; Cetorhinus blainvillei by the Portuguese Biologist Felix Antonio De Brio Capello (18281879) in 1869; Selachus pennantii, by Cornish in 1885; Cetorhinus maximus infanuncula, by the Dutch Zoologists Antonius Boudewijn Deinse (18851965) and Marcus Jan Adriani (19291995) in 1953; and finally Cetorhinus maximus normani, by Siccardi in 1961. Other names include bone shark, elephant shark, hoe-mother (sometimes contracted to homer), sail-fish, and sun-fish.|$|E

5|$|Lamniformes: They are {{commonly}} known as the <b>mackerel</b> <b>sharks.</b> They include the goblin shark, basking shark, megamouth shark, the thresher sharks, shortfin and longfin mako sharks, and great white shark. They are distinguished by their large jaws and ovoviviparous reproduction. The Lamniformes also include the extinct megalodon, Carcharodon megalodon.|$|R
50|$|After being shuffled {{between the}} genera Carcharias and Odontaspis {{in the family}} Odontaspididae by various authors, in 1973 Leonard Compagno resurrected Jean Cadenat's 1963 {{subgenus}} Pseudocarcharias from synonymy for this species and placed it within its own family. The morphology of the crocodile shark suggests affinity with the megamouth shark (Megachasmidae), basking shark (Cetorhinidae), thresher <b>sharks</b> (Alopiidae), and <b>mackerel</b> <b>sharks</b> (Lamnidae). More recent phylogenetic analyses, based on mitochondrial DNA, {{have suggested that the}} crocodile shark is closely related to either the megamouth shark or the sand sharks (Odontaspididae). Alternately, analysis based on dentition suggests that the closest relatives of the crocodile shark are the thresher sharks, followed by the <b>mackerel</b> <b>sharks.</b> Fossil Pseudocarcharias teeth dating to the Serravallian age (13.6 - 11.6 Ma) of the Miocene epoch have been found in Italy, and are identical to those of the modern-day crocodile shark.|$|R
50|$|A {{spiracle}} is a {{small hole}} found behind each eye.

50|$|The {{crocodile}} shark (Pseudocarcharias kamoharai) is {{a species of}} <b>mackerel</b> <b>shark</b> and the only extant {{member of the family}} Pseudocarchariidae. A specialized inhabitant of the mesopelagic zone, the {{crocodile shark}} can be found worldwide in tropical waters from the surface to a depth of 590 m. It performs a diel vertical migration, staying below a depth of 200 m during the day and ascending into shallower water at night to feed. Typically measuring only 1 m in length, the crocodile shark is the smallest living <b>mackerel</b> <b>shark.</b> It can be distinguished by its elongated cigar-shaped body, extremely large eyes, and relatively small fins.|$|E

5000|$|Fast-swimming sharks of open waters, {{such as the}} <b>mackerel</b> <b>sharks,</b> have {{crescent-shaped}} tails with {{upper and}} lower lobes of almost equal size. The high aspect ratio of the tail serves to enhance swimming power and efficiency. In these species, there are usually also lateral keels on the caudal peduncle. The whale shark and basking shark also have this type of tail, although they are generally more sedate animals than the other examples.|$|R

50|$|Based on {{cytochrome}} b genes, Martin and Naylor (1997) {{concluded the}} thresher sharks form a monophyletic sister {{group to the}} clade containing the families Cetorhinidae (basking <b>shark)</b> and Lamnidae (<b>mackerel</b> <b>sharks).</b> The megamouth shark (Megachasma pelagios) was placed as the next-closest relative to these taxa, though the phylogenetic position of that species {{has yet to be}} resolved with confidence. Cladistic analyses by Compagno (1991) based on morphological characters, and Shimada (2005) based on dentition, have both corroborated this interpretation.|$|R
500|$|Little {{is known}} about goblin shark {{reproduction}} because a pregnant female {{has yet to be}} found and studied. It likely shares the reproductive characteristics of other <b>mackerel</b> <b>sharks,</b> which are viviparous with small litter sizes and embryos that grow during gestation by eating undeveloped eggs (oophagy). The birth size is probably close to , the length of the smallest known specimen. Males mature sexually at about [...] long, while female maturation size is unknown. No data is available on growth and aging.|$|R
50|$|Two {{species of}} the {{thresher}} {{have been identified as}} having a modified circulatory system that acts as a counter-current heat exchanger, which allows them to retain metabolic heat. <b>Mackerel</b> <b>sharks</b> (Lamnidae family) have a similar homologous structure to this which is more extensively developed. This structure is a strip of red muscle along each of its flanks, which has a tight network of blood vessels that transfer metabolic heat inward towards the core of the shark, allowing it to maintain and regulate its body heat.|$|R
