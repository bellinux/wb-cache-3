In this paper, the concepts of potential <b>machining</b> <b>capacity</b> (MCp), real <b>machining</b> <b>capacity</b> (MCr), and total <b>machining</b> <b>capacity</b> (MCt) are presented. As for a con-figured TP-iPSS whose lathe is given and determined, MCp is majorly influenced by the lathe’s attachments, especially the cutting tool,MCr ismajorly correlativewith cuttingparameters (cut-ting depth, cutting velocity and feed) and workpiece properties besides parameters of cutting tool. Combining different cutting tool with the TP-iPSS, differentMCp and potential machining area (Ap) canbeobtained, then themeasurementmodels ofMCpandAp are established through using multivariate regression analysis, and MCr is calculated with the product of MCp and the ratio of Ap to Ar (real machining area). In addition, MCt in a time interval can be calculated with the sumofMCr in the time interval. Finally, a case is studied to demonstrate theMCp,MCr, and MCt models and their basic applications to TP-iPSS evaluation, accounting, and optimization...|$|R

50|$|Bonas Machine Company Ltd. {{launched}} {{the first successful}} electronic Jacquard at ITMA, Milan in 1983. Although the machines were initially small, modern technology has allowed Jacquard <b>machine</b> <b>capacity</b> to increase significantly, and single end warp control can extend to more than 10,000 warp ends. This avoids the need for repeats and symmetrical designs and allows almost infinite versatility. The computer-controlled machines significantly reduce the down time associated with changing punched paper designs, thus allowing smaller batch sizes. However, electronic Jacquards are costly {{and may not be}} required in a factory weaving large batch sizes, and smaller designs. The larger machines allowing single end warp control are very expensive, and can only be justified where great versatility is required, or very specialized design requirements need to be met. For example, they are an ideal tool to increase the ability and stretch the versatility of the niche linen Jacquard weavers who remain active in Europe and the West, while most of the large batch commodity weaving has moved to low cost areas.|$|E

The objective is to choose the rate of production so as to minimize the total discounted cost of inventory and production. Finding an optimal control policy for this problem is difficult. Instead, we derive an asymptotic approximation by letting the rates of change of the machine states approach infinity. The asymptotic analysis leads to a limiting problem in which the stochastic <b>machine</b> <b>capacities</b> are replaced by their equilibrium mean capacities. The value function for the original problem is shown to converge to the value function of the limiting problem.

30|$|To {{analyze the}} capacitated, multi-item {{production}} planning problem and to decompose it into sub-problems, we {{make use of}} the supply chain planning matrix presented in Stadtler and Fleischmann (2012). The matrix classifies and decomposes supply chain planning tasks subject to their business functions (e.g., procurement, production, distribution or sales) and according to their planning horizons (e.g., long-, medium- or short-term). Production planning and scheduling tasks are classified in the production section with a medium- and a short-term planning horizon. The aim of these tasks is to find lot sizes and production sequences for machines at the lowest level of data aggregation, so they can be used for shop floor control. Thus, the lot-sizing and machine scheduling problem defines the sub-problem of the base level in our HPPS. However, lot-sizing and machine scheduling decisions depend on available <b>machine</b> <b>capacities,</b> which are defined at the master planning level. Additionally, seasonal demands usually cannot be foreseen at the base level due to the short-term planning horizon. At the top level, decisions regarding available <b>machine</b> <b>capacities</b> and seasonal inventories are made with a medium-term planning horizon. These decisions are provided to the base level.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT. Lagrangian {{relaxation}} (LR) {{has recently}} {{emerged as a}} practical approach for complex scheduling problems. The efficiency of the approach, however, depends on how fast the relaxed subproblems and the dual problem are solved. Previously, <b>machine</b> <b>capacity</b> constraints were relaxed and the subproblems were solved by using dynamic programming (DP). The number of multipliers and the computation complexity of the DP algorithm, however, are proportional to the time horizon. This becomes a barrier for the approach to solve problems with long time horizons, This paper presents an alternative framework to overcome the barrier. By using much less multipliers to relax operation precedence constraints rather than <b>machine</b> <b>capacity</b> constraints and by approximately solving subproblems, a new LR approach is developed. The approach can find good schedules for problems with thousands of parts and tens of machines {{within a short time}} on a personal computer, making it possible for practical use...|$|E
