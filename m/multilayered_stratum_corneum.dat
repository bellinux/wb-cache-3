40|$|The epidemal {{permeability}} barrier forms late in gestation, coincident with decreased lipid synthesis, increased lipid processing, {{and development}} of a mature, <b>multilayered</b> <b>stratum</b> <b>corneum.</b> Prior {{studies have shown that}} changes in the epidermal Ca++ gradient in vivo regulate lamellar body secretion and lipid synthesis, and modulations in extracellular Ca++in vitro also regulate keratinocyte differentiation. We asked here whether a Ca++ gradient forms in fetal epidermis in utero, and whether its emergence correlates with key developmental milestones of barrier formation and stratum corneum development. Using either ion precipitation or proton induced X-ray emission analysis of fetal mouse and rat skin, we showed that a Ca++ gradient is not present at gestational days 16 – 18, prior to barrier formation, and that a gradient forms coincident with the emergence of barrier competence (day 19, mouse; day 20, rat) prior to birth. These results are consistent with a role for Ca++in the regulation of key metabolic events leading to barrier formation. Whether the calcium gradient is formed actively or passively remains to be determined...|$|E
40|$|<b>Stratum</b> <b>corneum</b> chymotryptic enzyme may be {{important}} in desquamation. It has also been suggested that other proteases, especially <b>stratum</b> <b>corneum</b> tryptic enzyme, may be involved. <b>Stratum</b> <b>corneum</b> tryptic enzyme has been purified and its cDNA has been cloned. Results from expression analyses indicate that <b>stratum</b> <b>corneum</b> tryptic enzyme is as skin specific as <b>stratum</b> <b>corneum</b> chymotryptic enzyme. In this work we have produced and characterized antibodies specific for <b>stratum</b> <b>corneum</b> tryptic enzyme. We have also by means of biochemical, immunochemical, and immunohistochemical methods performed studies on <b>stratum</b> <b>corneum</b> tryptic enzyme in normal human epidermis. Antibodies against bacterial recombinant <b>stratum</b> <b>corneum</b> tryptic enzyme were produced and purified by affinity chromatography. Two types of antibodies were obtained: one reacting only with pro-stratum corneum tryptic enzyme and one specific for the catalytically active part of <b>stratum</b> <b>corneum</b> tryptic enzyme. Immunohistochemistry with the antibodies reacting with pro-stratum corneum tryptic enzyme showed a staining pattern similar to <b>stratum</b> <b>corneum</b> chymotryptic enzyme-specific antibodies, i. e., the expression was confined to cornifying epithelia with a need of desquamation-like processes. Extracts of tape strips with superficial human <b>stratum</b> <b>corneum</b> were found to contain precursors as well as active forms of <b>stratum</b> <b>corneum</b> tryptic enzyme and <b>stratum</b> <b>corneum</b> chymotryptic enzyme. The enzymes had maximal activity at pH 8, but both had considerable activity also at pH 5. 5. The results were compatible for a role of <b>stratum</b> <b>corneum</b> tryptic enzyme in desquamation. <b>Stratum</b> <b>corneum</b> tryptic enzyme may act in concert with <b>stratum</b> <b>corneum</b> chymotryptic enzyme and/or function as a <b>stratum</b> <b>corneum</b> chymotryptic enzyme-activating enzyme. The presence in normal superficial <b>stratum</b> <b>corneum</b> of precursors {{as well as of}} active forms of <b>stratum</b> <b>corneum</b> chymotryptic enzyme and <b>stratum</b> <b>corneum</b> tryptic enzyme, and the activity of both enzymes over a broad range of pH-values, suggest some possible ways by which the desquamation may be regulated...|$|R

40|$|<b>Stratum</b> <b>corneum</b> from Negroes and Caucasians {{has been}} {{compared}} with respect to facility of tape stripping, numbers of cell layers, and density.

The buoyant density of abdominal <b>stratum</b> <b>corneum,</b> as determined in organic solvent systems, is less in Negroes than in Caucasians. The reverse is true when density in air is determined and when isopyknic sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation is employed. We believe the latter values portray the true relationship of Negro and Caucasian <b>stratum</b> <b>corneum,</b> since detipidization does not occur, and since a greater density of Negro <b>stratum</b> <b>corneum</b> is consonant with its greater microscopic compactness...|$|R
40|$|Desquamation is {{described}} as a protease-dependent phenomenon where serine proteases with a basic pH optimum play a key role. Recently proteases with an acidic pH optimum were identified in the stratumcorneum and associated with desquamation, e. g., cathepsin D and the <b>stratum</b> <b>corneum</b> thiol protease. The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate if human <b>stratum</b> <b>corneum</b> contains proteases different from the above, exhibiting similar properties. After gel filtration, we identified four distinct proteolytic activities in a human <b>stratum</b> <b>corneum</b> extract, a cathepsin-E-like activity (80 kDa), a cathepsin-D activity (40 kDa), a yet unknown cathepsin-L-like form (28 kDa) exhibiting the highest caseinolytic activity, and a chymotrypsin-like protein (24 kDa) containing the acidic activity of the well described <b>stratum</b> <b>corneum</b> chymotryptic enzyme. We named the new 28 kDa protease <b>stratum</b> <b>corneum</b> cathepsin-L-like enzyme. Characterization of <b>stratum</b> <b>corneum</b> cathepsin-L-like enzyme provided clear evidence that this new protease, despite its membership to the cathepsin-L-like family, is distinct from cathepsin L and from the recently described <b>stratum</b> <b>corneum</b> thiol protease. Its ability to hydrolyze corneodesmosin, a marker of corneocyte cohesion, was in favor of a role of <b>stratum</b> <b>corneum</b> cathepsin-L-like enzyme in the desquamation process. A more detailed analysis did not allow us to identify <b>stratum</b> <b>corneum</b> cathepsin-L-like enzyme at the molecular level but revealed that <b>stratum</b> <b>corneum</b> thiol protease is identical with the recently described cathepsin L 2 protease. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction studies and the use of a specific antibody revealed that, in contrast to earlier reports, expression of <b>stratum</b> <b>corneum</b> thiol protease in human epidermis is not related to keratinocyte differentiation. Our results indicate that the <b>stratum</b> <b>corneum</b> thiol protease is probably expressed as a pro-enzyme in the lower layers of the epidermis and in part activated by a yet unidentified mechanism in the upper layers during keratinocyte differentiation...|$|R
40|$|There is {{evidence}} that the “acid mantle” of the <b>stratum</b> <b>corneum</b> is important for both permeability barrier formation and cutaneous antimicrobial defense. The origin of the acidic pH of the <b>stratum</b> <b>corneum</b> remains conjectural, however. Both passive (e. g., eccrine/sebaceous secretions, proteolytic) and active (e. g., proton pumps) mechanisms have been proposed. We assessed here whether the free fatty acid pool, which is derived from phospholipase-mediated hydrolysis of phospholipids during cornification, contributes to <b>stratum</b> <b>corneum</b> acidification and function. Topical applications of two chemically unrelated secretory phospholipase sPLA 2 inhibitors, bromphenacylbromide and 1 -hexadecyl- 3 -trifluoroethylglycero-sn- 2 -phosphomethanol, for 3 d produced an increase in the pH of murine skin surface that was paralleled not only by a permeability barrier abnormality but also altered <b>stratum</b> <b>corneum</b> integrity (number of strippings required to break the barrier) and decreased <b>stratum</b> <b>corneum</b> cohesion (protein weight removed per stripping). Not only <b>stratum</b> <b>corneum</b> pH but also all of the functional abnormalities normalized when either palmitic, stearic, or linoleic acids were coapplied with the inhibitors. Moreover, exposure of intact murine <b>stratum</b> <b>corneum</b> to a neutral pH for as little as 3 h produced comparable abnormalities in <b>stratum</b> <b>corneum</b> integrity and cohesion, and further amplified the inhibitor-induced functional alterations. Furthermore, short-term applications of an acidic pH buffer to inhibitor-treated skin also reversed the abnormalities in <b>stratum</b> <b>corneum</b> integrity and cohesion, despite the ongoing decrease in free fatty acid levels. Finally, the secretory-phospholipase-inhibitor-induced alterations in integrity/cohesion were in accordance with premature dissolution of desmosomes, demonstrated both by electron microscopy and by reduced desmoglein 1 levels in the <b>stratum</b> <b>corneum</b> (shown by immunofluorescence staining and vizualized by confocal microscopy). Together, these results demonstrate: (i) the importance of phospholipid-to-free-fatty-acid processing for normal <b>stratum</b> <b>corneum</b> acidification; and (ii) the potentially important role of this pathway not only for barrier homeostasis but also for the dual functions of <b>stratum</b> <b>corneum</b> integrity and cohesion...|$|R
40|$|Hyaluronan is {{well known}} to exist as a water-sorbed {{macromolecule}} in the extracellular matrix. We here examined whether hyaluronan exists in the normal <b>stratum</b> <b>corneum.</b> High performance liquid chromatography was used to quantify hyaluronan content in the <b>stratum</b> <b>corneum,</b> epidermis (including <b>stratum</b> <b>corneum),</b> and dermis of mice, with the resulting dry weights being 22. 3 [*]±[*] 2. 9, 15. 1 [*]±[*] 1. 5, and 738. 6 [*]±[*] 31. 6 [*]μg per g, respectively. Normal mouse skin was then labeled with [3 H]-glucosamine in an organ culture, and accumulation of [3 H]-labeled hyaluronan and its molecular mass were determined separately for the <b>stratum</b> <b>corneum,</b> epidermis, and dermis. In the <b>stratum</b> <b>corneum,</b> [3 H]-labeled hyaluronan was accumulated linearly over the 3 -d culture period. After the 3 -d culture period, the epidermis synthesized twice the amount (expressed as dpm per mg dry weight) of [3 H]-labeled hyaluronan as the dermis, whereas the <b>stratum</b> <b>corneum</b> and dermis showed nearly the same content of [3 H]-labeled hyaluronan. The molecular mass of [3 H]-labeled hyaluronan was highest (> 1. 0 [*]×[*] 106) in the dermis and clearly lower (< 6. 0 [*]×[*] 104) in the <b>stratum</b> <b>corneum.</b> Based on these results, we here confirm that hyaluronan is supplied from keratinocytes beneath the <b>stratum</b> <b>corneum</b> layer, and {{is present in the}} normal <b>stratum</b> <b>corneum.</b> We speculate that hyaluronan {{may play a role in}} moisturizing the <b>stratum</b> <b>corneum</b> and/or regulating its mechanical properties...|$|R

Method: Trichophyton rubrum isolates derived from patients with tinea cruris infections {{were obtained from the}} Department of Medical Microbiology, University Hospital of Wales, U. K. Human <b>stratum</b> <b>corneum</b> sterilized with ethylene oxide was used as a nitrogen source in agar culture medium plates.

40|$|Transdermal drug {{delivery}} system is in the centre of attention in recent years. For efficient dermal {{drug delivery}} the drug has to overcome the barrier of the outermost layer of the skin, the <b>stratum</b> <b>corneum.</b> For facilitating dermal drug transport, the barrier properties of the <b>stratum</b> <b>corneum</b> can be varied by applying chemical penetration enhancers. The aim of this work was to characterize various penetration enhancers and investigate their mechanism of action.

40|$|<b>Stratum</b> <b>corneum</b> lipids are an {{important}} determinant for both water-retention function and permeability-barrier function in the <b>stratum</b> <b>corneum.</b> However, their major constituent, ceramides, have not been analyzed in detail in skin diseases such as atopic dermatitis that show defective water-retention and permeability-barrier function. In an attempt to assess the quantity of ceramides per unit mass of the <b>stratum</b> <b>corneum</b> in atopic dermatitis, <b>stratum</b> <b>corneum</b> sheet {{was removed from the}} forearm skin by stripping with cyanoacrylate resin and placed in hexane/ethanol extraction to yield <b>stratum</b> <b>corneum</b> lipids. The <b>stratum</b> <b>corneum</b> was dispersed by solubilization of cyanoacrylate resin with dimethylformamide, and after membrane filtration, the weight of the <b>stratum</b> <b>corneum</b> mass was measured.

In atopic dermatitis (n = 32 – 35), there was a marked reduction in the amount of ceramides in the lesional forearm skin compared with those of healthy individuals of the same age. Interestingly, the non-lesional skin also exhibited a similar and significant decrease of ceramides. Among six ceramide fractions, ceramide 1 was most significantly reduced in both lesional and non-lesional skin.

We assessed here whether sebum influences <b>stratum</b> <b>corneum</b> hydration or permeability barrier function in asebia J 1 and 2 J mice, with profound sebaceous gland hypoplasia. Asebia J 1 mice showed normal permeability barrier homeostasis and extracellular lamellar membrane structures, but they displayed epidermal hyperplasia, inflammation, and decreased (> 50 %) <b>stratum</b> <b>corneum</b> hydration, {{associated with a}} reduction in sebaceous gland lipids (wax diesters/monoesters, sterol esters). The triglyceride content of both asebia and control <b>stratum</b> <b>corneum</b> was low, consistent with high rates of triglyceride hydrolysis within the normal pilosebaceous apparatus, despite high rates of triglyceride synthesis. Although a mixture of synthetic, sebum-like lipids (sterol/wax esters, triglycerides) did not restore normal <b>stratum</b> <b>corneum</b> hydration to asebia skin, topical glycerol, the putative product of triglyceride hydrolysis in sebaceous glands, normalized <b>stratum</b> <b>corneum</b> hydration, and the glycerol content of asebia <b>stratum</b> <b>corneum</b> was 85 % lower than in normal <b>stratum</b> <b>corneum.</b> In contrast, another potent endogenous humectant (urea) did not correct the abnormality. The importance of glycerol generation from triglyceride in sebaceous glands for <b>stratum</b> <b>corneum</b> hydration was demonstrated further by (i) the absence of sebaceous-gland-associated lipase activity in asebia mice, whereas abundant enzyme activity was present in the glands of control mice; and (ii) the inability of high concentrations of topical triglyceride to correct the hydration abnormality, {{despite the presence of}} abundant lipase activity in asebia <b>stratum</b> <b>corneum.</b> These results show that sebaceous-gland-derived glycerol is a major contributor to <b>stratum</b> <b>corneum</b> hydration...|$|R

The lipid-rich extracellular matrix surrounding the corneocytes in the <b>stratum</b> <b>corneum</b> is mainly responsible for this barrier function. In this study (cryo-) electron diffraction was applied to obtain information about the local lateral lipid organization in the extracellular matrix in relation to depth in human <b>stratum</b> <b>corneum.</b> For this purpose, <b>stratum</b> <b>corneum</b> grid-strips were prepared from native skin in vivo and ex vivo.

At 90 °C all lipids were present in a fluid phase. These results are in good agreement with previously reported wide angle X-ray diffraction and Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy studies.

Both 1, 1, 3, 3 -tetramethylguanidine and 1, 8 -diazabicyclo [5, 4, 0] undec- 7 -ene applications increased skin surface pH in parallel with abnormalities in both barrier homeostasis and <b>stratum</b> <b>corneum</b> integrity/cohesion. The latter was attributable to rapid activation (< 20 min) of serine proteases, assessed by in situ zymography, followed by serine-protease-mediated degradation of corneodesmosomes. Western blotting revealed degradation of desmoglein 1, a key corneodesmosome structural protein, in parallel with loss of corneodesmosomes. Coapplication of serine protease inhibitors with the superbase normalized <b>stratum</b> <b>corneum</b> integrity/cohesion.

The paucity of K and P within the inner <b>stratum</b> <b>corneum</b> suggests these important intracellular solutes (and perhaps others, including water) are recycled within the viable tissue, thus providing a virtual nutrient supply immediately underneath the <b>stratum</b> <b>corneum.</b> Alterations in this recirculation could have a regulatory function in the physiology of this tissue...|$|R

The plasma glucose concentrations of the mice at 3 wk after their i. v. injection were significantly higher than those of control mice (streptozotocin, 3. 2 -fold; alloxan, 3. 7 -fold). The <b>stratum</b> <b>corneum</b> water content was significantly reduced in both types of diabetic mice, whereas the transepidermal water loss remained unchanged. The amino acid content with normal epidermal profilaggrin processing was either normal or elevated in the <b>stratum</b> <b>corneum</b> of the streptozotocin-treated mice. In contrast, the <b>stratum</b> <b>corneum</b> triglyceride content in the streptozotocin-treated mice was significantly lower than the control level, even though the levels of ceramides, cholesterols, and fatty acids in the <b>stratum</b> <b>corneum</b> were all higher than the control levels. The streptozotocin-treated group also exhibited decreases in basal cell proliferation and epidermal DNA content linked with {{an increase in the number}} of corneocyte layers in the <b>stratum</b> <b>corneum,</b> suggesting that the rates of epidermal and <b>stratum</b> <b>corneum</b> turnover were slower in the streptozotocin-treated animals than in the normal controls. In contrast, there were no remarkable changes in any of the epidermal differentiation marker proteins examined. This finding in diabetic mice, namely, reduction in both the epidermal proliferation and <b>stratum</b> <b>corneum</b> water content without any accompanying impairment in the <b>stratum</b> <b>corneum</b> barrier function, is similar to that found in aged human skin. Our new animal model of diabetes will be useful for the study of diabetic dermopathy as well as the mechanisms of <b>stratum</b> <b>corneum</b> moisturization...|$|R
40|$|Dietarily {{administered}} {{butylated hydroxytoluene}} (BHT) {{has previously been}} shown to inhibit UV radiation induction of carcinogenesis, erythema, and ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) activity. Butylated hydroxytoluene feeding also resulted in significant increases in epidermal absorption and {{it was suggested that}} BHT's photoprotective properties might be attributable to a diminution of UV radiation dose reaching respective target sites. To explore this possibility, the contribution of <b>stratum</b> <b>corneum</b> to BHT's photoprotective action was examined. SKH-Hr- 1 hairless mice were fed diets containing 0. 5 % (w/w) BHT for 2 weeks prior to experimentation. Control animals received the unsupplemented ration. <b>Stratum</b> <b>corneum</b> from both groups was isolated and spectral transmission recorded. Transmission, between 280 - 320 nm, was approximately 65 % greater through <b>stratum</b> <b>corneum</b> obtained from control animals compared with that of BHT-treated animals. Further evidence of the biologic significance of this BHT effect upon <b>stratum</b> <b>corneum</b> absorption was obtained when <b>stratum</b> <b>corneum</b> was first removed by tape-stripping, the animals irradiated with 0. 45 J/cm 2 of UVB, and epidermal ODC activity determined. BHT provided the usual inhibition of ODC activity induction in nonstripped animals, but ODC activity induction in BHT -treated, tape-stripped animals was restored to levels that did not significantly differ from controls. The protective effect exhibited by the <b>stratum</b> <b>corneum</b> could not be attributed to BHT-induced alteration of physical dimension, as neither the thickness of <b>stratum</b> <b>corneum</b> nor the number of <b>stratum</b> <b>corneum</b> layers, as determined from measurement of NaOH-distended frozen sections, differed from controls. Although the mechanism remains obscure, these data support in diminished levels of UV radiation reaching potential epidermal target sites and delimits a large component of the photoprotective effect to the <b>stratum</b> <b>corneum...</b>|$|R
40|$|There {{are several}} skin {{diseases}} {{in which the}} lipid composition in the intercellular matrix of the <b>stratum</b> <b>corneum</b> {{is different from that}} of healthy human skin. It has been shown that patients suffering from atopic dermatitis have a reduced ceramide content in the <b>stratum</b> <b>corneum,</b> whereas in the <b>stratum</b> <b>corneum</b> of lamellar ichthyosis patients, the amount of free fatty acids is decreased and the ceramide profile is altered. Both patient groups also show elevated levels of transepidermal water loss indicative of an impaired barrier function. As ceramides and free fatty acids are essential for a proper barrier function, we hypothesized that changes in the composition of these lipids would be reflected in the lipid organization in <b>stratum</b> <b>corneum</b> of atopic dermatitis and lamellar ichthyosis patients. We investigated the lateral lipid packing using electron diffraction and the lamellar organization using freeze fracture electron microscopy. In atopic dermatitis <b>stratum</b> <b>corneum,</b> we found that, in comparison with healthy <b>stratum</b> <b>corneum,</b> the presence of the hexagonal lattice (gel phase) is increased with respect to the orthorhombic packing (crystalline phase). In lamellar ichthyosis <b>stratum</b> <b>corneum,</b> the hexagonal packing was predominantly present, whereas the orthorhombic packing was observed only occasionally. This is in good agreement with studies on <b>stratum</b> <b>corneum</b> lipid models that show that the presence of long-chain free fatty acids is involved {{in the formation of the}} orthorhombic packing. The results of this study also suggest that the ceramide composition is important for the lateral lipid packing. Finally, using freeze fracture electron microscopy, changes in the lamellar organization in <b>stratum</b> <b>corneum</b> of both patient groups could be observed...|$|R
40|$|In principle, {{the maximum}} skin flux of solutes should be {{unaffected}} by the vehicle, unless that vehicle affects the skin. We recently showed that the maximum epidermal flux for 10 similarly sized phenolic compounds, with differing lipophilicities was defined by their solubility in the skin. Here, we extend these studies to examine how maximum fluxes are affected by cosolvents reported to enhance skin penetration. We compared in vitro human epidermal permeation and <b>stratum</b> <b>corneum</b> solubility for 10 phenols with similar molecular weights and hydrogen bonding but varying lipophilicity from 60 % propylene glycol (PG) /water, 40 % PG/water and water vehicles. We also measured solvent uptake into <b>stratum</b> <b>corneum,</b> investigated {{the changes in the}} attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy of <b>stratum</b> <b>corneum</b> and the multiphoton microscopy (MPM) images of β-naphthol for the various vehicles. We found that phenolic compounds maximum flux and <b>stratum</b> <b>corneum</b> solubilities generally increased with the percentage of PG in the binary solvent system but that the estimated diffusivities appeared to be vehicle independent. Maximum fluxes were related to vehicle-dependent <b>stratum</b> <b>corneum</b> solubilities. Theses solubilities, in turn, depended on the amount of vehicle absorbed into the <b>stratum</b> <b>corneum</b> and the amount of phenolic compounds dissolved in that absorbed vehicle. ATR-FTIR and MPM studies suggest that the vehicle-induced increased uptake of solutes into the <b>stratum</b> <b>corneum</b> occurred by an increased solubility in intercellular lipids of <b>stratum</b> <b>corneum...</b>|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Two-photon {{fluorescence}} lifetime imaging {{is used to}} identify microdomains (1 – 25 m) of two distinct pH values within the uppermost layer of the epidermis (<b>stratum</b> <b>corneum).</b> The fluorophore used is 2, 7 -bis-(2 -carboxyethyl) - 5 -(and- 6) -carboxyfluorescein (BCECF), whose lifetime (pH 4. 5, 2. 75 ns; pH 8. 5, 3. 90 ns) is pH dependent over the pH range of the <b>stratum</b> <b>corneum</b> (pH 4. 5 to pH 7. 2). Hairless mice (SKH 1 -hrBR) are used {{as a model for}} human skin. Images (50 m 50 m) are acquired every 1. 7 m from the <b>stratum</b> <b>corneum</b> surface to the first viable layer (stratum granulosum). Acidic microdomains (average pH 6. 0) of variable size (1 m in diameter with variable length) are detected within the extracellular matrix of the <b>stratum</b> <b>corneum,</b> whereas the intracellular space of the corneocytes in mid-stratum corneum (25 m diameter) approaches neutrality (average pH 7. 0). The surface is acidic. The average pH of the <b>stratum</b> <b>corneum</b> increases with depth because of a decrease in the ratio of acidic to neutral regions within the <b>stratum</b> <b>corneum.</b> The data definitively show that the <b>stratum</b> <b>corneum</b> acid mantle results from the presence of aqueous acidic pockets within the lipid-rich extracellular matrix...|$|R
40|$|The {{interstices}} of the mammalian <b>stratum</b> <b>corneum</b> contain lipids in {{a system}} of continuous membrane bilayers critical for the epidermal permeability barrier. During the transition from inner to outer <b>stratum</b> <b>corneum,</b> the content of polar lipids including glucosylceramides, decreases while ceramide content increases. We investigated whether inhibition of glucosylceramide hydrolysis would alter epidermal permeability barrier function. Daily topical applications of bromoconduritol B epoxide (BrCBE) to intact murine skin selectively inhibited beta-glucocerebrosidase, increased glucosylceramide content of <b>stratum</b> <b>corneum</b> with ceramide content remaining largely unchanged, and caused a progressive, reversible decrease in barrier function. Histochemistry of inhibitor-treated epidermis revealed persistence of periodic acid-Schiff-positive staining in <b>stratum</b> <b>corneum</b> cell membranes, consistent with retention of hexose moieties. Electron microscopy of inhibitor-treated samples revealed no evidence of toxicity or changes in the epidermal lipid delivery system. However, immature membrane structures persisted in the intercellular spaces throughout the <b>stratum</b> <b>corneum,</b> with reappearance of mature membrane structures progressing outward from the lower <b>stratum</b> <b>corneum</b> upon termination of BrCBE. Finally, the induced barrier abnormality was not reversed by coapplications of ceramide. These data demonstrate that glucosylceramide hydrolysis is important {{in the formation of the}} epidermal permeability barrier, and suggest that accumulation of glucosylceramides in <b>stratum</b> <b>corneum</b> intercellular membrane domains leads to abnormal barrier function...|$|R
40|$|<b>Stratum</b> <b>corneum</b> {{has been}} {{isolated}} by tryptic digestion of porcine epidermis and palatal epithelium, and the lipid concentration and composition have been compared by thinlayer chromatography {{in conjunction with}} photodensitometry. Palatal <b>stratum</b> <b>corneum</b> contained 47 ± 6 μg lipid/mg tissue or 115 ± 16 μg lipid per cm 2 of <b>stratum</b> <b>corneum</b> surface, whereas epidermal <b>stratum</b> <b>corneum</b> contained 105 ± 17 μg lipid/mg tissue or 135 ± 16 μg/cm 2. The difference in total lipid content {{does not account for}} the tenfold higher permeability constant for the permeation of water through the former tissue compared to the latter, there fore, the difference in permeability must be based on difference in lipid composition. In this regard, palatal <b>stratum</b> <b>corneum</b> includes 12. 1 % phospholipids, although phospholipids were undetected in epidermal <b>stratum</b> <b>corneum.</b> Differences in the content and location of non polar liquidphase lipids may also be of significance for permeability. Other factors that may contribute to the greater permeability of the palatal horny layer relative to epidermal <b>stratum</b> <b>corneum</b> include generally lower proportion of cholesterol, fatty acids, and ceramides, a dramatically lower proportion of the linoleate containing acylceramide and a tenfold lower content of covalently bound lipids associated with the corneocyte envelope...|$|R
