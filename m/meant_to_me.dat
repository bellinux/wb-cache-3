He dedicated The Early Asimov (1972) to him, and concluded it {{by stating that}} [...] "There is no way at all to express how much he <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> {{and how much he}} did for me except, perhaps, to write this book evoking, once more, those days of a quarter century ago".|$|E
500|$|Edward's {{youngest}} brother, Prince John, {{died at the}} age of 13 on 18 January 1919 after {{a severe}} seizure. John suffered from epilepsy, and Edward, who was 11 years older than his brother and had hardly known him, saw his death as [...] "little more than a regrettable nuisance". He wrote to his mistress of the time that [...] " [...] told [...] all about that little brother, and how he was an epileptic. 's been practically shut up for the last two years anyhow, so no one has ever seen him except the family, and then only once or twice a year. This poor boy had become more of an animal than anything else." [...] He also wrote an insensitive letter to Queen Mary, which has since been lost. She did not reply, but he felt compelled to write her an apology, in which he stated: [...] "I feel such a cold hearted and unsympathetic swine for writing all that I did... No one can realize more than you how little poor Johnnie <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> who hardly knew him... I feel so much for you, darling Mama, who was his mother." ...|$|E

2500|$|Gertrude's Matisse and Picasso {{descriptive}} essays {{appeared in}} Alfred Stieglitz's August, 1912 edition of Camera Work, {{a special edition}} devoted to Picasso and Matisse, and represented her very first publication. Of this publication, Gertrude said, [...] "e {{was the first one}} that ever printed anything that I had done. And you can imagine what that <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> or to any one." ...|$|E
2500|$|Campese further {{records in}} his {{autobiography}} that following the Test not one Australian player spoke to him or offered him any consolatory remarks. Only Australian coach Bob Dwyer approached Campese following the Test and said, 'Mate, forget it. It's one of those things.' Campese writes that, [...] "No one will ever know how much that <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> then." [...] In Blindsided Michael Lynagh recalls that during the after-match reception the Lions began to buy Campese champagne. Campese left the after-match reception after [...] "20 minutes or so" [...] and drove home. While {{on his way home}} a police officer booked him for speeding at 104 kmh in a 60 kmh zone.|$|E
2500|$|..... {{everybody}} {{hated him}} because he was very dry, and I thought he was wonderful because he was very dry. And Barrow made me realize that all my romantic views of art were nonsense. I had always thought an angel came down and sat on your shoulder and whispered in your ear 'dah-dah-dah-DUM.' Never occurred to me that art was something worked out. And suddenly it was skies opening up. As soon as you find out what a leading tone is, you think, Oh my God. What a diatonic scale is â€“ Oh my God! The logic of it. And, of course, what that <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> was: Well, I can do that. Because you just don't know. You think it's a talent, you think you're born with this thing. What I've found out and what I believed is that everybody is talented. It's just that some people get it developed and some don't.|$|E
6000|$|My heart beat. Did Betty suspect? Was {{that last}} {{sentence}} <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> inform <b>me</b> {{that she was}} aware of my secret folly, and laughed at it? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Never. But he <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> frighten <b>me.</b> And when {{he brought}} out his knife in the bedroom at Leavenworth he did. My pistol was not loaded." ...|$|R
60|$|He {{threw his}} leg across it, and, sitting astride, he leaned his elbows {{over the back}} and glowered {{at me as if}} he <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> frighten <b>me.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Rather. We {{discussed}} it for hours. You don't {{know what it}} <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> A wonderful man. Imam Din, was not our Hajji marvellous?" ...|$|E
6000|$|I, too, was afraid, {{and what}} of my {{discovery}} of how much she <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> my mind was in a turmoil; but, I succeeded in answering quite calmly: ...|$|E
60|$|You {{knew how}} much I loved my brother. You {{knew how much}} it <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that he should live to wipe out my father's dishonour. All the future was centred on him, and you sacrificed him.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, if you <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> marry <b>me</b> you wouldn't ask <b>me</b> <b>to</b> do this!" [...] she cried. [...] "I {{want to go}} back to Hampton. If you won't take me, I'll walk." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Assuredly not," [...] she replied, [...] "since to do {{so would}} be to insult you. But neither do I suppose that you really <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> offer <b>me</b> that place." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{went home}} pleasantly excited by this encounter. After months of {{unbroken}} solitude {{in the midst}} of throngs of strangers, this man's cordial invitation <b>meant</b> much <b>to</b> <b>me.</b>|$|R
6000|$|BLOOM: When {{you made}} your present choice {{they said it was}} beauty and the beast. I can never forgive you for that. (His clenched fist at his brow) Think what it means. All you <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> then. (Hoarsely) Woman, it's {{breaking}} me! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I have a friend, Frans Hals--the {{painter of}} pictures--tell him when next {{you see him}} that I am glad his {{portrait}} of me is finished, and that I asked God to bless him for all his goodness has <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> in the past." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You don't {{know what}} it <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> to fall in love. I felt that I had lived all my life in a prison, and at last Lucy came and took me by the hand, and led me out. And {{for the first time}} I breathed the free air of heaven.' ...|$|E
60|$|Hollingsworth {{looked at}} me fiercely, and with glowing eyes. He could not have shown {{any other kind of}} {{expression}} than that, had he <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> strike <b>me</b> with a sword.|$|R
6000|$|... "Although you {{expressed}} strong disapproval {{not long}} ago, {{one could have}} fancied you were not speaking from a wholly impersonal standpoint and <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> give <b>me</b> good advice," [...] I said.|$|R
5000|$|Two-time US Poet Laureate Stanley Kunitz said of Roethke, [...] "The poet of my {{generation}} who <b>meant</b> most <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> in his person and in his art, was Theodore Roethke." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Anyhow, I have YOU," [...] she said. [...] "Life can't be {{altogether}} empty {{with such}} a friend. Anne, pat my head--just as if I were a little girl--MOTHER me a bit--and {{let me tell you}} while my stubborn tongue is loosed a little just what you and your comradeship have <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> since that night I met you on the rock shore." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not {{women like}} Kilmeny," [...] said Eric miserably. [...] "I tell you she has all her mother's {{unfaltering}} will and tenacity of purpose, {{although she is}} free from any taint of pride or selfishness. I {{thank you for your}} sympathy and interest, David. You have done all you could--but, heavens, what it would have <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> if you could have helped her!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh, it's awful. I can't realise it.' She {{turned to}} him with a desperate appeal. 'Haven't you {{anything}} to say at all? You know how much I loved my brother. You know how much it <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that he should live to wipe out all memory of my father's crime. All the future was centred upon him. You can't have sacrificed him callously.' ...|$|E
6000|$|The girl rose, with {{a little}} laugh. [...] "That," [...] she said, [...] "was evidently <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> afford <b>me</b> an opportunity. I think I should like {{to go down to}} the Inlet." ...|$|R
60|$|I do {{not know}} that she <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> hurt <b>me,</b> though she was never very {{backward}} at that; but whatever her intention, her words seemed to strike straight upon a naked nerve.|$|R
60|$|After this I said no more, for I {{knew that}} she <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> warn <b>me.</b> We had entered on this {{business}} and must see it through to its end, sweet or bitter.|$|R
6000|$|I {{was not in}} {{the least}} scared; on the contrary, I was filled with a kind of fatalistic rage. In {{imagination}} I saw the old house, with all that it <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> in ruins. I saw the great elms and maples scorched, dead, the tall black locust burned to a ship's mast. As I peered from the window, a neighbor called earnestly, [...] "You'd better get off there; the whole house is going." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Very little. Just told me your name, {{and that}} you had arrived here. Why should I have asked for more? What could he {{have told me that}} I did not know already from my brother's letter? Three lines! And how much they <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> <b>me!</b> I will show them to you one day, Kirylo Sidorovitch. But now I must go. The first talk between us cannot be a matter of five minutes, so we had better not begin...." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{have been}} wanton to-night. I confess it. I {{am proud of}} it. But it was not--professional. It {{was the first time}} in my life. Almost do I regret--almost do I regret that I did not do it sooner--it has been crowned with such success. You have held me in your arms--your arms. Oh, you will never know what that first embrace <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> I am not a clod. I am not iron nor stone. I am a woman--a warm, {{breathing}} woman--.|$|E
6000|$|... "There's the old buck!" [...] cried {{one of the}} men (I {{understand}} what he said now, though at the time it <b>meant</b> nothing <b>to</b> <b>me).</b> [...] "Knock him on the head!" ...|$|R
60|$|But the {{photographer}} {{had ceased to}} listen. He came over and took my {{head in his hands}} and twisted it sideways. I thought he <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> kiss <b>me,</b> and I closed my eyes.|$|R
6000|$|... "A better way," [...] Mannering repeated, puzzled. [...] "I {{am afraid}} I don't quite {{understand}} you. I presume that you <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> rob <b>me.</b> You {{would not have}} found it worth while, by the bye." ...|$|R
