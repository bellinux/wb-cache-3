25|$|Reflecting on {{her work}} in musical films, Powell said: People are always fascinated by the {{so-called}} golden age of musicals, but it wasn’t all that great. Everything was glazed. Those movies didn’t reflect reality. I was at MGM for 11 years and nobody ever let <b>me</b> <b>play</b> anything but teenagers. I was 25 years old with kids of my own and it was getting ridiculous. Publicity was froth. Everything you said was monitored. With me, they didn’t have to worry. I never had anything to say, anyway. It was hard work, I had no friends, no social interaction with people my age and the isolation was tough. But I had to support my family, so I did what I was told and had no other choice.|$|E
25|$|I {{composed}} the fugue first and {{wrote it down}} while I was thinking out the prelude. I only {{hope that you will}} be able to read it, for it is written so very small; and I hope further that you will like it. Another time I shall send you something better for the clavier. My dear Constanze is really the cause of this fugue's coming into the world. Baron van Swieten, to whom I go every Sunday, gave me all the works of Händel and Sebastian Bach to take home with me (after I had played them to him). When Constanze heard the fugues, she absolutely fell in love with them. Now she will listen to nothing but fugues, and particularly (in this kind of composition) the works of Händel and Bach. Well, as she has often heard <b>me</b> <b>play</b> fugues out of my head, she asked me if I had ever written any down, and when I said I had not, she scolded me roundly for not recording some of my compositions in this most artistically beautiful of all musical forms and never ceased to entreat me until I wrote down a fugue for her.|$|E
500|$|Smith {{commented on}} the surrealism of the Oscars experience: [...] "That's exactly what it was, surreal... I enjoy {{performing}} {{almost as much as}} I enjoy making up songs in the first place. But the Oscars was a very strange show, where the set was only one song cut down to less than two minutes, and the audience was {{a lot of people who}} didn't come to hear <b>me</b> <b>play.</b> I wouldn't want to live in that world, but it was fun to walk around on the moon for a day." ...|$|E

500|$|Steven Lee Lukather {{was born}} on October 21, 1957, in San Fernando Valley, California. In an {{interview}} with online publication [...] "Guitarhoo!" [...] he said: [...] "I had a music teacher in grammar school that made <b>me</b> <b>play</b> the violin. It was 1965. I had been playing guitar for a year (after the Beatles changed our lives), and they had NO use for a guitar player." [...] He then played keyboards and drums, and then taught himself {{how to play the}} guitar starting at age seven, when his father bought him a Kay acoustic guitar and a copy of the Beatles album Meet the Beatles. Lukather has said that the album [...] "changed his life" [...] and that he was greatly influenced by the guitar playing of George Harrison in particular.|$|E
500|$|English {{rock group}} the Yardbirds {{recorded}} [...] "The Train Kept A-Rollin'" [...] {{during their first}} American tour in 1965. [...] It is based on Johnny Burnette's adaptation, but Beck biographer Annette Carson comments their [...] "propulsive, power-driven version, however, deviated radically from the original... recording plucked the old Rock & Roll Trio number from obscurity {{and turned it into}} a classic among classics". [...] The Yardbirds' lead guitarist Jeff Beck, who is a fan of early rockabilly, said that he introduced the song to the group: [...] "They just heard <b>me</b> <b>play</b> the riff, and they loved it and made up their version of it". [...] Giorgio Gomelsky, the group' first producer, states that Sonny Boy Williamson II's use of blues harp to imitate train sounds during his 1963 UK tour with the Yardbirds also inspired the band's adaptation of the song.|$|E
500|$|According to Wong, she {{was instead}} offered {{the part of}} Lotus, a {{deceitful}} song girl who helps to destroy the family and seduces the family's oldest son. Wong refused the role, telling MGM head of production Irving Thalberg, [...] "If you let <b>me</b> <b>play</b> O-lan, I will be very glad. But you're asking me– with Chinese blood– to do the only unsympathetic role in the picture featuring an all-American cast portraying Chinese characters." [...] The role Wong hoped for went to Luise Rainer, who won the Best Actress Oscar for her performance. Wong's sister, Mary Liu Heung Wong, appeared in the film {{in the role of}} the Little Bride. MGM's refusal to consider Wong for this most high-profile of Chinese characters in U.S. film is remembered today as [...] "one of the most notorious cases of casting discrimination in the 1930s".|$|E

500|$|Interviewed by Oriana Fallaci in 1965, Connery {{identified}} {{where he}} had altered the character for the films, saying [...] "I said to the producers that the character had one defect, there was no humor about him; to get him accepted, they'd have to let <b>me</b> <b>play</b> him tongue-in-cheek, so people could laugh. They agreed, and there you are: today Bond is accepted {{to such an extent}} that even philosophers take the trouble to analyze him, even intellectuals enjoy defending him or attacking him. And even while they're laughing at him, people take him terribly seriously". Connery went on to add that [...] "Bond is important: this invincible superman that every man would like to copy, that every woman would like to conquer, this dream we all have of survival. And then one can't help liking him". After the pressures of five films in six years, Connery left the role after the 1967 film You Only Live Twice saying, [...] "It became a terrible pressure, like living in a goldfish bowl... that was part of the reason I wanted to be finished with Bond. Also I had become completely identified with it, and it became very wearing and very boring".|$|E
500|$|The young Stanford {{was given}} a {{conventional}} education at a private day school in Dublin run by Henry Tilney Bassett, who concentrated on the classics {{to the exclusion of}} other subjects. Stanford's parents encouraged the boy's precocious musical talent, employing a succession of teachers in violin, piano, organ and composition. Three of his teachers were former pupils of Ignaz Moscheles, including his godmother Elizabeth Meeke, of whom Stanford recalled, [...] "She taught me, before I was twelve years old, to read at sight. ... She made <b>me</b> <b>play</b> every day {{at the end of my}} lesson a Mazurka of Chopin: never letting me stop for a mistake. ... By the time I had played through the whole fifty-two Mazurkas, I could read most music of the calibre my fingers could tackle with comparative ease." [...] One of the young Stanford's earliest compositions, a march in D major, written when he was eight years old, was performed in the pantomime at the Theatre Royal, Dublin three years later. At the age of seven, Stanford gave a piano recital for an invited audience, playing works by Beethoven, Handel, Mendelssohn, Moscheles, Mozart and Bach. One of his songs was taken up by the University of Dublin Choral Society and was well received.|$|E
500|$|... "It Girl" [...] is a mid-tempo pop and R love song, {{built on}} a finger-clicking beat. The song is set in common time with a {{moderate}} tempo of 95 beats per minute. It is composed in the key of E major with Derulo's vocal range spanning from the note of E4 to the note of B5. According to Rap-Up, the song's lyrics find Derulo as the male protagonist singing praises of [...] "a lovely lady", comparing her to his [...] "greatest hit". [...] "It Girl" [...] opens with a whistling intro and an acoustic guitar melody. In the first verse, he chants about how he searched all over and finally found the girl of his dreams. He also affirms that the girl means {{much more than a}} Grammy Award to him. Its hook, which forms part of the chorus, contains the lyrics: [...] "You could be my it girl / Baby, you're the shit girl / Lovin; you could be a crime / Crazy how we fit, girl / This is it, girl / Gimme 25 to life / I just wanna rock all night long and put you {{in the middle of my}} spotlight / You could be my it girl / You're my biggest hit, girl / Let <b>me</b> <b>play</b> it loud." [...] Scott Shelter from Pop Crush noted that the song uses the [...] "oh-oh-oh-oh" [...] vocal chants after the chorus.|$|E

2500|$|Though Hopper gave {{critically}} acclaimed performances in Coppola's Rumble Fish (1983) and Sam Peckinpah's The Osterman Weekend (1983), {{it was not}} until he portrayed the gas-huffing, obscenity-screaming iconic villain Frank Booth in David Lynch's Blue Velvet (1986) that his career truly revived. On reading the script Hopper said to Lynch: [...] "You have to let <b>me</b> <b>play</b> Frank Booth. Because I am Frank Booth!" [...] He won critical acclaim and several awards for this role, and in the same year received an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor for his role as an alcoholic assistant basketball coach in Hoosiers.|$|E
2500|$|Atzmon's {{works have}} also {{explored}} {{the music of}} the Middle East, North Africa, and Eastern Europe. Atzmon told The Guardian that he draws on Arabic music which he says cannot be notated like western music but must be internalised, which he calls [...] "reverting to the primacy of the ear". Atzmon's musical method has been to play with notions of cultural identity, flirting with genres such as tango and klezmer as well as various Arabic, Balkan, Gypsy and Ladino folk forms. Atzmon's recordings deliberately differ from his live shows. [...] "I don't think that anyone can sit in a house, at home, and listen to <b>me</b> <b>play</b> a full-on bebop solo. It's too intense. My albums need to be less manic." ...|$|E

2500|$|On August 8, 1905, Cobb's mother {{fatally shot}} his father {{with a pistol}} {{that his father had}} {{purchased}} for her. Court records indicate that Mr. Cobb had suspected his wife of infidelity and was sneaking past his own bedroom window to catch her in the act. She saw the silhouette of what she presumed to be an intruder and, acting in self-defense, shot and killed her husband. Mrs. Cobb was charged with murder and then released on a $7,000 recognizance bond. She was acquitted on March 31, 1906. Cobb later attributed his ferocious play to his late father, saying, [...] "I did it for my father. He never got to see <b>me</b> <b>play...</b> but I knew he was watching me, and I never let him down." ...|$|E

But, however, in the last 10 or so years, I have had quite a few young Jewish boys who will tell me that I am their favorite player or they love watching <b>me</b> <b>play</b> or they feel like baseball is a good fit for them because it worked for me or it worked for Shawn Green or other Jewish players at the major league level.

2500|$|To be honest, I wasn't {{very smart}} about things. At that stage I was still {{averaging}} 40 after nine Tests {{or so and}} with the Packer players away, {{most of the other}} guys in the Aussie Test team were very new to the team. I thought {{it was up to me}} to compete with the Packer boys. When the Packer catchcry was [...] "Lillee getting wickets and Hookesy clearing pickets" [...] I felt that anyone who was coming to watch <b>me</b> <b>play</b> needed to be entertained. I probably played more aggressively than I should have. My feeling was I wanted to give the crowd something to look at when they came in the gates. I should have been more circumspect. In a lot of cases I was happy to get out for 30 or 40. But I felt we needed to compete with WSC boys.|$|E

2500|$|Ludologists break {{sharply and}} radically from this idea. They {{argue that a}} video game is first and {{foremost}} a game, which must be understood in terms of its rules, interface, and the concept of play that it deploys. Espen J. Aarseth argues that, although games certainly have plots, characters, and aspects of traditional narratives, these aspects are incidental to gameplay. For example, Aarseth is critical of the widespread attention that narrativists have given to the heroine of the game Tomb Raider, saying that [...] "the dimensions of Lara Croft's body, already analyzed to death by film theorists, are irrelevant to me as a player, because a different-looking body would not make <b>me</b> <b>play</b> differently... When I play, I don't even see her body, but see through it and past it." [...] Simply put, ludologists reject traditional theories of art because they claim that the artistic and socially relevant qualities of a video game are primarily determined by the underlying set of rules, demands, and expectations imposed on the player.|$|E
2500|$|At a February 2014 {{listening}} {{session for}} the album, Schoolboy Q {{spoke on the}} album's opening track: [...] "When I first made [...] all I wanted to say was that my grandma showed me my first strap.

I was an only child so I probably got on her nerves that much that she finally gave me her burner, like, 'Here, get the fuck out my face.' [...] I {{just wanted to say that}} so bad." [...] He also added on how he incorporated one of his neighborhood friends on to the record: [...] " [...] speak on my homeboy Rat Tone. He's one of my big homies from my hood. He showed me my first [...] when I was like 11-years-old. I was amazed by it. I thought that shit was tight. They used to have all the shiny shit. That's how we talked. We would call a gun 'fly.'
