40|$|The {{emerging}} {{fields of}} <b>microbial</b> population <b>genetics</b> and genomics provide an avenue {{to study the}} ecological rules that govern how communities form, function, and evolve. Our struggle to understand the causes and consequences of microbial diversity stems from our inability to define ecologically and evolutionarily meaningful units of diversity. The 16 S rRNA-based tools that have been so useful in charting microbial diversity may lack sufficient sensitivity to answer many questions about the ecology and evolution of microbes. Examining genetic diversity with increased resolution is vital to understanding the forces shaping community structure. Population genetic analyses enabled by whole genome sequencing, multilocus sequence analyses, or single nucleotide polymorphism analyses permit the testing of hypotheses pertaining to the geographic distribution, migration, and habitat preference of specific microbial lineages. Furthermore, these approaches can reveal patterns of gene exchange within and between populations and communities. Tools from <b>microbial</b> population <b>genetics</b> and population genomics {{can be used to}} increase the resolution with which we measure microbial diversity, enabling a focus on the scale of genetic diversity at whic...|$|R

40|$|The {{reduced cost}} of high {{throughput}} sequencing, increasing automation, and the amenability of sequence data for evolutionary analysis are making DNA data (or the corresponding amino acid sequences) the molecular marker {{of choice for}} studying <b>microbial</b> population <b>genetics</b> and phylogenetics.

Because of the extensive literature published on these topics this review cannot be comprehensive in its scope.

40|$|Summary. The discoveries {{over the}} last decade have {{demonstrated}} that micro-biology is a central scientific discipline with practical applications in agriculture, medicine, bioremediation, biotechnology, engineering, and other fields. It is clear that the roles of microbes in nature are so diverse that the process of mining this genetic variation for new applications will continue long into the future. Moreover, the rapid rate of microbial evolution ensures {{that there will be no}} permanent solu-tion to agricultural, medical, or environmental problems caused by microbes. These problems will demand a continual stream of creative new approaches that evolve along with the microbes. Thus, the excitement of this field will continue long into the future. However, these opportunities and imperatives demand a deep understanding of basic <b>microbial</b> physiology, <b>genetics,</b> and ecology. Major chal-lenges that lay ahead are to impart the broad training needed to entice and enable the next generation of microbiologists, and to educate the public and government representatives about the continued and critical importance of this field for health and the economy.
