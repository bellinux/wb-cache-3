The banks are aware these new changes are fundamental for their performance improvement. The banks of Romania have rapidly growing and developing e-banking services, especially the Internet information and home and mobile banking. The sites of banks provide specific information, particularly on credit. Moreover, these are some other sites, which are dedicated to credit information. The future of e-banking, services in the Romanian practice depends on how much the banks understand the part these services play in attracting and keeping customers and the easiness of Internet, home, office and <b>mobile</b> <b>access.</b> <b>Key</b> words: e/banking; Internet banking; home/office banking; mobile banking; Romanian banking system...|$|E
40|$|AbstraCI-Heterogeneous network (HetNet) {{deployment}} strategies {{have the potential}} to improve the energy efficiency of <b>mobile</b> <b>access</b> networks. One <b>key</b> aspect to consider in HetNets is the impact of the power consumption of the backhaul, i. e., the overall energy efficiency of a HetNet deployment is affected by the backhaul technology and architecture. This paper presents a preliminary assessment of the design challenges of a future green backhaul segment for a HetNet deployment. The study is based on the analysis of the medium term future outlook (i. e., between now and tile year 2025) of the main technologies used in todays' backhaul networks (i. e., fibe r, microwave and copper). It can be concluded that, even if there are no doubts that both microwave and fiber will be predominately used in the future, the possible migration paths leading to such fiber- and microwave-dominated scenarios might be different, depending on factors such as spectrum and license costs, time to deployment, availability of equipment, and required Quality of Service (QoS) levels...|$|R

Using throughput and energy efficiency as performance measures, we address the optimal coverage areas of and the cooperation among the <b>mobile</b> <b>access</b> points. We show {{that when the}} <b>mobile</b> <b>access</b> points do not cooperate in demodulation, disjoint coverage areas are optimal for throughput while completely overlapped coverage areas are optimal for energy efficiency. When the <b>mobile</b> <b>access</b> points decode their received packets jointly, the optimal configuration {{appears to have a}} phase transition. Specifically, in order to maximize throughput, the coverage areas of the <b>mobile</b> <b>access</b> points should be completely overlapped when SNR is smaller than a threshold and disjoint otherwise...|$|R

40|$|One of the {{advantages}} of <b>mobile</b> <b>access</b> to the Internet can be found in that it allows one to conduct information search in a ubiquitous manner. Accordingly, the time for net surfing required to gain necessary information through the Internet is reduced when <b>mobile</b> <b>access</b> is combined with ordi-nary PC <b>access.</b> As <b>mobile</b> devices continue to advance rapidly, it becomes quite important {{to find a way to}} assess the impact of <b>mobile</b> <b>access</b> to the Internet on the performance of e-commerce. Among such performance indi-cators, of particular interest is the conversion rate, where a customer takes some desirable action at the website, for example, by becoming a member, placing an order and so on. The purpose of this paper is to develop and analyze a mathematical model for describing the information search pro-cess through the Internet with or without the <b>mobile</b> <b>access.</b> The analytical framework that we propose in this article enables one to assess the impact of <b>mobile</b> <b>access</b> on information search completion time and the conversion rate. We provide numerical examples to demonstrate the effectiveness of the computational procedures that we developed in this research. Key words: conversion rate, information search completion time, <b>mobile</b> <b>access,</b> PC access 1...|$|R
40|$|Until now, it has {{not been}} clear how <b>mobile</b> <b>access</b> interacts with {{traditional}} wireline online behavior. Does availability of <b>mobile</b> <b>access</b> crowd out desktop access? Does it draw some users further into digital lifestyles?Cast a glance at any coffee shop, train station or airport boarding gate, and {{it is easy to see}} that <b>mobile</b> <b>access</b> to the internet is taking root in our society. Open laptops or furrowed brows staring at palm-sized screens are evidence of how routinely information is exchanged on wireless networks. But the incidence of such activity is only one dimension of this phenomenon. Not everyone has the wherewithal to engage with "always present" connectivity and, while some may love it, others may only dip their toes in the wireless water and not go deeper.

40|$|The {{introduction}} of mobile devices with smaller screens motivates {{the need for}} web pages that work correctly across many different devices—referred to as responsive web design. <b>Mobile</b> <b>access</b> is a <b>key</b> feature for companies: both to reach new customers, and also to provide an enhanced service to existing customers. Testing the correct appearance of a responsive web page on different devices is not a trivial task {{because there are no}} standard rules for responsiveness, and the layout may need to be significantly rearranged in order to fit on smaller screens. This dissertation describes an investigation into the automated test case generation for responsive web pages. The aim of the project is to develop a novel approach to test responsive web pages for the consistency of their appearance. This thesis develops the idea of consistent web pages which are not identical but provide essentially the same interface to the user. The goal of this project is to develop approach on how to do automated test case generation of the appearance of responsive web page and to evaluate this approach by building a test tool that automate the testing of consistency of responsive web pages against the master copy of the page. Several rules were implemented for comparing web pages displayed on different screens. The results show that the approach taken is an effective way of automating testing for consistency.

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a novel <b>mobile</b> <b>access</b> coordinated {{wireless}} sensor network (MC-WSN) architecture for reliable and efficient information exchange. In conventional sensor networks with <b>mobile</b> <b>access</b> points (SENMA), the <b>mobile</b> <b>access</b> points (MAs) traverse the network to collect information directly from individual sensors. While simplifying the routing process, a major limitation with SENMA is that a transmission is made only if an MA visits the corresponding source node; thus, data transmission {{is limited by the}} physical speed of the MAs and the length of their trajectory, resulting in low throughput and huge delay. The proposed MC-WSN architecture resolves this problem and provides an efficient solution for time-sensitive information exchange. In MC-WSN, the delay is effectively managed through hop number control. We analyze the throughput of the network, and show that the throughput of the MC-WSN is independent of the physical speed or the trajectory length of the <b>mobile</b> <b>access</b> point. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated through simulations...|$|R

30|$|Based on this result, one can {{establish}} a baseline {{to assess the}} energy efficiency of future practical implementations. We will demonstrate that for these high bit rate <b>mobile</b> <b>access</b> network, a disruptive approach with large idle base station fractions is possible and necessary. Moreover, we offer a heuristic {{on the basis of}} which algorithms and protocols for this future <b>mobile</b> <b>access</b> network can be designed.|$|R
30|$|On {{the other}} hand, the {{heuristic}} does provide a near-optimal solution for putting deployed base stations in a sleep mode. Hence, {{it provides a}} baseline for practical implementations of sleep mode algorithms in <b>mobile</b> <b>access</b> networks to be evaluated against. Also, during {{the design of a}} <b>mobile</b> <b>access</b> network, it can provide useful information on the suitability of a topology for the introduction of sleep modes.|$|R
30|$|In {{light of}} the {{requirement}} for both increasing bit rates and reduced energy consumption in <b>mobile</b> <b>access</b> networks, the introduction of sleep modes is a key element. As {{it is difficult to}} analytically predict the energy saving potential that can be achieved by using sleep modes in <b>mobile</b> <b>access</b> network deployments, we have derived a heuristic that can serve as a design tool for establishing a baseline.|$|R

50|$|One of {{the main}} {{differences}} with the MMTel standard is that, in contrast of legacy circuit switched telephony services, IP transport is used over the <b>mobile</b> <b>access.</b> This means that the <b>mobile</b> <b>access</b> technologies that are in main focus for MMTel are access types such as high-speed packet access (HSPA), 3GPP long-term evolution (LTE) and EDGE Evolution that all are developed with efficient IP transport in mind.|$|R
30|$|In mobile {{technologies}} two {{trends are}} competing. On the one hand, the <b>mobile</b> <b>access</b> network requires optimisation in energy consumption. On the other hand, data volumes and required bit rates are rapidly increasing. The latter trend requires {{the deployment of}} more dense <b>mobile</b> <b>access</b> networks as the higher bit rates are available at shorter distance from the base station. In order to improve the energy efficiency, the introduction of sleep modes is required. We derive a heuristic which allows establishing a baseline of active base station fractions {{in order to be}} able to evaluate <b>mobile</b> <b>access</b> network designs. We demonstrate that sleep modes can lead to significant improvements in energy efficiency and act as an enabler for femtocell deployments.|$|R
40|$|<b>Mobile</b> network <b>access</b> has {{seemingly}} become {{ubiquitous in}} industrialized countries. With data services becoming sufficiently fast, usable, and affordable, demand is growing rapidly, {{both in the}} number of users and in capacity – since most Internet/web resources continue being tailored for fast fixed line access. A lot of engineering has gone into making mobile devices appealing and sufficiently power-conserving to last for at least a day in spite of the many emerging network-driven applications. However, this device-centric view fails to recognize the “other side”: the <b>mobile</b> <b>access</b> infrastructure. There, too, power consumption raises technical issues (not just) when moving towards faster <b>mobile</b> <b>access</b> and is de-facto an inhibiting factor for cellular expansion: for practical and for cost reasons. In this paper, we seek to raise awareness of the power consumption issues of mobile networks. We argue that <b>mobile</b> <b>access</b> will become, in addition to data centers and PCs, another contributing factor from the ICT sector to greenhouse gas emissions and that current <b>mobile</b> <b>access</b> technologies limit further network expansion in rural areas. Thus, we need to start working on making mobile networks much more energy-efficient than they are today, maybe even fully selfsustainable using renewable energy sources...|$|R
