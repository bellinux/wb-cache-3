40|$|<b>Meta-analytic</b> <b>techniques</b> <b>for</b> {{summarizing}} {{information about}} the relationship between school resources and student performance are capable only of addressing the narrow and uninteresting hypothesis that resources are never used effectively by schools. The data show clearly that resources are some-times used effectively, although this happens infrequently and there is no description of the circumstances under which resources are used effectively. This article relates the basic evidence on school effectiveness to the specific application of meta-analytic methods employed by Greenwald, Hedges, and Laine (1996). Their analysis, suffering from the narrowness of the inquiry inherent in their statistical methods, is also based on a very highly selected sample of results that biases their analysis precisely toward their conclusions. As a result, their summary of existing work provides a distorted and mislead-ing view of the potential implications of school resource policies.

40|$|In {{the context}} of {{sustainable}} city planning, we observe in recent years an increasing policy interest in urban environmental quality management in relation to land use. The potential for sustainable land use solutions in urban areas is often severely hampered by the existence of unacceptably high levels of soil pollution. The present paper aims to identify the critical success factors for an effective clean-up policy for these areas. After a review of issues, backgrounds and prospects, the paper attempts to offer a qualitative impact assessment model which encapsulates an expert system for brownfield development in relation to clean-up targets for polluted sites. Next, a case study approach to various soil pollution cases in The Netherlands is carried out to test the feasibility of the above-mentioned analytical framework.

40|$|Objective: To {{review the}} {{evidence}} for efficacy of three contem-porary treatments for intermittent claudication: pentoxifylline, exercise programs, and smoking cessation. Data Identification: English-language literature search using MEDLINE, Index Medicus, and bibliographic reviews of major texts and all pertinent articles. Study Selection: For pentoxifylline, randomized, double-blind controlled trials were selected. For exercise, all controlled trials were selected, because few randomized trials have been done. For smoking cessation, 26 pertinent studies were selected after an exhaustive search. Data Extraction: Study quality was evaluated; therapeutic ef-ficacy was estimated for pentoxifylline and exercise using <b>meta-analytic</b> <b>techniques.</b> <b>For</b> smoking cessation, all outcomes were determined and described. Results: For pentoxifylline, insufficiently reported data led to marked disparity in effect sizes, preventing a meaningful pooled estimate of effectiveness. The results for exercise therapy suggested that dynamic exercise is beneficial (pooled effect size for pain-free walking distance = 1. 03; 95 % CI, 0. 6 to 1. 5; P < 0. 0001). Finally, smoking cessation {{was associated with a}} reduced frequency of complications due to progressive disease and improved postopera-tive graft patency rates. Conclusions: The limited amount and quality of reported data precluded an overall, reliable estimate of pentoxifylline's efficacy. Structured exercise programs increased pain-free walking distance, and smoking cessation improved postoperative graft patency rates and reduced the complications of peripheral arterial disease...|$|R

40|$|Deep {{learning}} is a recently emerged field within machine learning which is gaining more and more attention as it significantly outperforms other approaches in an increas-ing number of applications – from speech detection to recognizing objects in images. 1 The term “deep learning ” originally referred to artificial neural networks (ANNs) {{with more than one}} hidden layer but can be generalized to architectures composed of mul-tiple non-linear transformations. One major advantage of deep learning compared to traditional approaches is that they can work directly on raw data and do not require any tuning or hand-crafting of features. Instead, they are able to learn their own feature representations (see, e. g., [1]). Up to now, applications of deep learning techniques within neuroscience have been very limited. They have been successfully applied to detect anomalies related to epilepsy in electroencephalography (EEG) recordings [6] and to classify sleep stages from EEG as well as recordings of eye movements and skeletal muscle activity [3]. Very recently, the potential of deep learning <b>techniques</b> <b>for</b> <b>neuroimaging</b> has also been demonstrate...|$|R

It measures the changes in the blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal which is related to the neuronal activity. Complexity of the data, presence of diﬀerent types of noises and the massive amount of data makes the fMRI data analysis a challenging one. It demands eﬃcient signal processing and statistical analysis methods.   The inference of the analysis is used by the physicians, neurologists and researchers for better understanding of the brain functions.      The purpose of this study is to design a toolbox for fMRI data analysis. It includes methods to detect the brain activity maps, estimation of the hemodynamic response (HDR) and the connectivity of the brain structures. This toolbox provides methods for detection of activated brain regions measured with Bayesian estimator. Results are compared with the conventional methods such as t-test, ordinary least squares (OLS) and weighted least squares (WLS). Brain activation and HDR are estimated with linear adaptive model and nonlinear method based on radial basis function (RBF) neural network.

40|$|Multivariate {{analysis}} <b>techniques</b> <b>for</b> <b>neuroimaging</b> {{data have}} recently received increasing attention {{as they have}} many attractive features that cannot be easily realized by the more commonly used univariate, voxel-wise, techniques 1, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. Multivariate approaches evaluate correlation/ covariance of activation across brain regions, rather than proceeding on a voxel-by-voxel basis. Thus, their results can be more easily interpreted as a signature of neural networks. Univariate approaches, on the other hand, cannot directly address interregional correlation in the brain. Multivariate approaches can also result in greater statistical power when compared with univariate techniques, which are forced to employ very stringent corrections for voxel-wise multiple comparisons. Further, multivariate techniques also lend themselves much better to prospective application of results from the analysis of one dataset to entirely new datasets. Multivariate techniques are thus well placed {{to provide information about}} mean differences and correlations with behavior, similarly to univariate approaches, with potentially greater statistical power and better reproducibility checks. In contrast to these advantages is the high barrier of entry to the use of multivariate approaches, preventing more widespread application in the community. To the neuroscientist becoming familiar with multivariate analysis techniques, an initial survey of the field might present a bewildering variety of approaches that, although algorithmically similar, are presented with different emphases, typically by people with mathematics backgrounds.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Several neuroimaging {{studies have}} {{reported}} structural brain differences in bipolar disorder using automated methods. While these studies have several advantages over those using region of interest techniques, no study has yet estimated a summary effect size or tested for between-study heterogeneity. We sought {{to address this issue}} using <b>meta-analytic</b> <b>techniques</b> applied <b>for</b> the first time in bipolar disorder {{at the level of the}} individual voxel. METHODS: A systematic review identified 16 voxel-based morphometry (VBM) studies comparing individuals with bipolar disorder with unaffected controls, of which eight were included in the meta-analysis. In order to take account of heterogeneity, summary effect sizes were computed using a random-effects model with appropriate correction for multiple testing. RESULTS: Compared with controls, subjects with bipolar disorder had reduced grey matter in a single cluster encompassing the right ventral prefrontal cortex, insula, temporal cortex, and claustrum. Study heterogeneity was widespread throughout the brain; though the significant cluster of grey matter reduction remained once these extraneous voxels had been removed. We found no evidence of publication bias (Eggers p = 0. 63). CONCLUSIONS: Bipolar disorder is consistently associated with reductions in right prefrontal and temporal lobe grey matter. Reductions elsewhere may be obscured by clinical and methodological heterogeneity...|$|R

Materials and Methods: A literature search was performed using Medline, PubMed, Embase and Cochrane databases for studies reported between 1998 and 2009 comparing laparoscopic and open surgery for the treatment of ventral (incisional) hernia. This meta-analysis of all the observational studies compared the post-operative complications recurrence rate and length of stay. The random effects model was used. Sensitivity and heterogeneity were analysed. Results: Analysis of 15 observational studies comprising 2452 patients qualified for meta-analysis according to the study′s inclusion criteria. Laparoscopic surgery was attempted in 1067 out of 2452. The results showed that the length of stay (odds ratio [OR], − 1. 00; 95 % confidence interval [CI], − 1. 09 to − 0. 91; P < 0. 00001) and operative time (OR, 59. 33; 95 % CI, 58. 55 to 60. 11; P < 0. 00001) was significantly lower in the laparoscopic group. The results also showed that there was a significant reduction in the formation of abscesses (OR, 0. 38; 95 % CI, 0. 16 to 0. 92; P = 0. 03) and wound infections (OR, 0. 49; 95 % CI, 0. 29 to 0. 82; P = 0. 007) post-operatively. There is a trend which indicates that the recurrence of the hernia using laparoscopic repair versus open repair was overall lower with the laparoscopic repair (OR, 0. 48; 95 % CI, 0. 22 to 1. 04; P = 0. 06), however, this was not significant. Conclusion: Laparoscopic incisional hernia repair was associated with a reduced length of stay, operative time and lower incidence of abscess and wound infection post-operatively. This study also highlights the benefit of using observational studies as a form of research and its value as a tool in answering questions where large sample sizes of patient groups would be impossible to accumulate in a reasonable length of time...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} applies two {{statistical analysis}} <b>techniques</b> <b>for</b> <b>neuroimaging</b> data. The first {{aim of this}} dissertation is to apply randomized singular value decomposition for the approximation of the top singular vectors of the singular value decomposition of a large matrix. Randomized singular value decomposition is an algorithm that approximates the top singular vectors of a matrix given a subset of its rows or columns. Several statistical applications, such as partial least squares, require the computation of the singular value decomposition of a matrix. Statistical packages have built in functions that can compute the singular value decomposition of a matrix. In many applications, however, computing the SVD of a matrix is not possible because computer memory requirements associated with matrix allocation is high, limiting its use in high-dimensional settings. Neuroimaging studies can generate measurements {{for hundreds of thousands}} of voxels from an image. Therefore, performing partial least squares analysis on these datasets is not possible using statistical packages. Simulation studies showed that the randomized singular value decomposition method provides a good approximation of the top singular vectors and therefore a good approximation of the partial least squares summary scores. This method is significant for public health since it allows researchers to perform statistical analysis at a voxel level with only a sample of a large dataset. The second aim is to apply a thin plate spline method for spatial normalization of structural magnetic resonance images. Spatial normalization is the process of standardizing images of different subjects into the same anatomical space. The idea behind this procedure is to match each data volume from a subject to a template, so that specific anatomic structures will occupy the same voxels. Spatial normalization is a critical step in the analysis of brain imaging data since it produces the "raw" data for subsequent statistical analyses...|$|R

This study {{took the form}} of the latter, using the systematic approach proposed by Glass (1976), called meta-analysis, which can further be described as an analysis of the analyses. A statistical meta-analysis integrates empirical studies, investigating the same outcome described as a mean effect size statistic. <b>Meta-analytic</b> <b>techniques</b> were selected <b>for</b> this study because they provide tools to assess effect size considering a pool of studies as a set of outputs collected within prescribed criteria. There are two main advantages of such investigations: (a) a large number of studies that vary substantially can be integrated, and (b) the integration is not influenced by the interpretation or use of the findings by the reviewers (Gijbels et al. 2005). Meta-analysis allows also for conducting a subgroup moderator analysis that provides tools of identifying factors that affect the magnitude of mean effect. A subsequent moderator analysis is anticipated to be employed in this study to answer additional research questions.|$|R

40|$|Alterations to fronto-striatal neural {{circuitry}} are {{the hallmark}} of many neurodegenerative conditions, giving rise to significant cognitive and behavioural symptoms. This thesis explores fronto-striatal atrophic change in two such conditions, Parkinson’s disease (PD) and behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD). This is a critical area of interest in PD where the role of atrophy in non-motor symptoms, as opposed to dopamine-mediated functional changes, is only beginning to be uncovered. In contrast, cognitive and behavioural decline in bvFTD has long been associated with cortical atrophy, but the contribution of striatal atrophic change is less established. Fronto-striatal atrophy in the conditions is investigated for its role {{in an array of}} cognitive and behavioural symptoms. In each study reported, patients have undergone either caregiver questionnaires, neuropsychological testing or novel experimental tasks, to assess 1) neuropsychiatric symptoms (Chapter 2, Publications I and II); 2) learning deficits (Chapter 3, Publication III); and 3) social decision-making (Chapter 4, Publication IV). Behavioural measures are related to fronto-striatal atrophy via voxel-based morphometry, a <b>technique</b> <b>for</b> <b>neuroimaging</b> analysis that enables quantification of local grey matter volume. This analysis was approached firstly at the group level {{to determine the extent of}} fronto-striatal grey matter loss in patients with respect to age-matched controls, before being correlated with specific cognitive/behavioural scores. Broadly, the results show that either distinct, or combined, regional fronto-striatal atrophy was related to cognition and behaviour in PD and bvFTD. More specially, these findings highlight a role for fronto-striatal atrophy in both the cognitive and everyday manifestations of neuropsychiatric dysfunction in PD, and in specific learning deficits. These findings have important implications for understanding the pathophysiology of those symptoms in PD, and represent a critical consideration in the future development of therapeutic interventions. In bvFTD these novel findings reveal a role for the striatum in complex cognition and behaviour, emphasising this as an important region for characterising symptoms in the disease, which may assist in diagnosis. Together, the findings provide important insights into the cognitive and behavioural symptoms in neurodegenerative disease, which at present remain incompletely understood and difficult to treat...|$|R

Advances in developmental neurobiology have important implications for speech-language pathologists and audiologists working with neonates who, by virtue of their prematurity, are at risk for developmental disabilities. The extra-uterine environment during this critical period (24 – 40 weeks gestation) in brain development has a profound and long lasting impact on the premature infant. Prior barriers to research on very young children and infants have recently been overcome with the development of non-invasive <b>techniques</b> <b>for</b> <b>neuroimaging</b> and recording biological events.

These contradictory statistical results demonstrate that <b>meta-analytic</b> <b>techniques</b> alone may not be sufficiently robust to firmly establish {{the presence or absence of}} an effect. We argue that a conclusive resolution of the debate about the effect of religious priming on prosocial behavior – and about theoretically disputed effects more generally – requires a large-scale, preregistered replication project, which we consider to be the sole remedy for the adverse effects of experimenter bias and publication bias...|$|R
40|$|This chapter {{discusses}} {{the kinds of}} analytic techniques {{that have led to}} conclusions concerning differences in the cognitive performance of men and women. It begins with a description of the derivation of different measures of effect size and the potential hazards in using <b>meta-analytic</b> <b>techniques.</b> In turn the likelihood of biases occurring in the publication of research, in the sampling of participants, and in the sampling of test items, and the issue of the possible heterogeneity of research studies, especially with regard to their methodological quality are assessed. The chapter examines the arguments that the use of meta-analysis tends to constrain researchers in their choice of research questions, and that <b>meta-analytic</b> <b>techniques</b> constitute a “package” or technology that encourages a positivist, realist interpretation of gender differences in cognition. Nevertheless, the conclusion that the ideas, arguments, and evidence lead to a rather different, constructionist interpretation, and that as a consequence future research into gender differences in human cognition will need to address a wider range of research questions using a wider range of research methodologies is presented...|$|R
