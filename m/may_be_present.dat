5|$|A URI {{reference}} {{may take}} the form of a full URI, the scheme-specific portion of a full URI, a trailing component of a full URI, or the empty string. An optional fragment identifier, preceded by #, <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>present</b> at the end of a URI reference.

5|$|High {{potassium}} levels {{tend to be}} {{a feature}} of severe rhabdomyolysis. Electrocardiography (ECG) may show whether the elevated potassium levels are affecting the conduction system of the heart, as suggested by the presence of T wave changes or broadening of the QRS complex. Low calcium levels <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>present</b> in the initial stage due to binding of free calcium to damaged muscle cells.|$|E
5|$|On {{geophysical}} evidence, {{most of the}} nickel on Earth {{is believed}} to be in the Earth's outer and inner cores. Kamacite and taenite are naturally occurring alloys of iron and nickel. For kamacite, the alloy is usually in the proportion of 90:10 to 95:5, although impurities (such as cobalt or carbon) <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>present,</b> while for taenite the nickel content is between 20% and 65%. Kamacite and taenite are also found in nickel iron meteorites.|$|E

5|$|The most {{recognizable}} symptoms in Parkinson's disease are movement ("motor") related. Non-motor symptoms, which include autonomic dysfunction, neuropsychiatric problems (mood, cognition, behavior or thought alterations), and sensory (especially altered sense of smell) and sleep difficulties, are also common. Some of these non-motor symptoms <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>present</b> {{at the time}} of diagnosis.|$|E
5|$|Clinical or {{biochemical}} {{evidence of}} liver toxicity may develop in {{one to four}} days, although, in severe cases, it may be evident in 12hours. Right-upper-quadrant tenderness <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>present</b> and can aid in diagnosis. Laboratory studies may show evidence of liver necrosis with elevated AST, ALT, bilirubin, and prolonged coagulation times, particularly an elevated prothrombin time. After paracetamol overdose, when AST and ALT exceed 1000IU/L, paracetamol-induced hepatotoxicity can be diagnosed. In some cases, the AST and ALT levels can exceed 10,000IU/L.|$|E
5|$|Female {{homosexual}} behavior <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>present</b> {{in every}} culture, although {{the concept of}} a lesbian as a woman who pairs exclusively with other women is not. Attitudes about female homosexual behavior are dependent upon women's roles in each society, and each culture's definition of sex. Women in the Middle East have been historically segregated from men. In the 7th and 8th centuries, some extraordinary women dressed in male attire when gender roles were less strict, but the sexual roles that accompanied European women were not associated with Islamic women. The Caliphal court in Baghdad featured women who dressed as men, including false facial hair, but they competed with other women for the attentions of men.|$|E

5|$|Given an {{adequate}} supply of food, larvae pupate and weave silken cocoons after three larval stages. Within the cocoon, the larva moults {{for a final}} time and undergoes metamorphosis into the adult form. This can take just four days, but may take much longer under adverse conditions, and there follows a variable-length stage during which the pre-emergent adult awaits a suitable opportunity to emerge. Trigger factors for emergence include vibrations (including sound), heat (in warm-blooded hosts), and increased levels of carbon dioxide, all of which stimuli may indicate {{the presence of a}} suitable host. Large numbers of pre-emergent fleas <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>present</b> in otherwise flea-free environments, and the introduction of a suitable host may trigger a mass emergence.|$|E
5|$|In older {{children}} and adolescents, {{the symptoms of}} hypothyroidism may include fatigue, cold intolerance, sleepiness, muscle weakness, constipation, a delay in growth, overweight for height, pallor, coarse and thick skin, increased body hair, irregular menstrual cycles in girls, and delayed puberty. Signs may include delayed relaxation of the ankle reflex and a slow heart beat. A goiter <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>present</b> with a completely enlarged thyroid gland; sometimes {{only part of the}} thyroid is enlarged and it can be knobby in character.|$|E
5|$|Ingestion of {{metallic}} lead, such {{as small}} lead fishing lures, increases blood lead levels {{and can be}} fatal. Ingestion of lead-contaminated food is also a threat. Ceramic glaze often contains lead, and dishes that have been improperly fired can leach the metal into food, potentially causing severe poisoning. In some places, the solder in cans used for food contains lead. When manufacturing medical instruments and hardware, solder containing lead <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>present.</b> People who eat animals hunted with lead bullets {{may be at risk}} for lead exposure. Bullets lodged in the body rarely cause significant levels of lead, but bullets lodged in the joints are the exception, as they deteriorate and release lead into the body over time.|$|E

5|$|It {{is likely}} that Oberon formed from the {{accretion}} disk that surrounded Uranus just after the planet's formation. The moon consists of approximately equal amounts of ice and rock, and is probably differentiated into a rocky core and an icy mantle. A layer of liquid water <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>present</b> at {{the boundary between the}} mantle and the core. The surface of Oberon, which is dark and slightly red in color, appears to have been primarily shaped by asteroid and comet impacts. It is covered by numerous impact craters reaching 210km in diameter. Oberon possesses a system of chasmata (graben or scarps) formed during crustal extension {{as a result of the}} expansion of its interior during its early evolution.|$|E
5|$|Myrmecologist William Brown, Jr., {{was perhaps}} {{the first person to}} {{question}} the monophyly of the genus, mentioning that the Argentine ant, a former member of Iridomyrmex, differed {{from the rest of the}} genus. The first proper revisions of the genus began in the 1990s, and 91 species were transferred to six genera; only 62 species remained after these revisions. These species were placed into the genera Anonychomyrma, Doleromyrma, Linepithema, Ochetellus, Papyrius and Philidris. In 2011, the genus was revised again, and 79 species and five extinct species were now present, 31 of which were newly described. Four species were placed in different genera while 25 species and subspecies were classified as synonyms. According to one source, 350 Australian Iridomyrmex species <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>present.</b>|$|E
5|$|Psychotic {{symptoms}} <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>present</b> {{in several}} other mental disorders, including bipolar disorder, borderline personality disorder, drug intoxication, and drug-induced psychosis. Delusions ("non-bizarre") are also present in delusional disorder, and social withdrawal in social anxiety disorder, avoidant personality disorder and schizotypal personality disorder. Schizotypal personality disorder has symptoms that are similar but less severe than those of schizophrenia. Schizophrenia occurs along with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) considerably more often than {{could be explained by}} chance, although {{it can be difficult to}} distinguish obsessions that occur in OCD from the delusions of schizophrenia. A few people withdrawing from benzodiazepines experience a severe withdrawal syndrome which may last a long time. It can resemble schizophrenia and be misdiagnosed as such.|$|E
