40|$|Laminar forced {{convection}} of nanofluids in a vertical channel with symmetrically <b>mounted</b> <b>rib</b> heaters on surfaces of opposite walls is numerically studied. The fluid flow and heat transfer characteristics are examined for various Reynolds numbers and nanoparticles volume fractions of water-Al 2 O 3 nanofluid. The flow exhibits various structures with varying Reynolds number. Even though the geometry and heating is symmetric {{with respect to}} a channel vertical mid-plane, asymmetric flow and heat transfer are found for Reynolds number greater than a critical value. Introduction of nanofluids in the base fluid delays the flow solution bifurcation point, and the critical Reynolds number increases with increasing nanoparticle volume fraction. A skin friction coefficient along the solid-fluid interfaces increases and decreases sharply along the bottom and top faces of the heaters, respectively, due to sudden acceleration and deceleration of the fluid at the respective faces. The skin friction coefficient, as well as Nusselt numbers in the channel, increase with increasing volume fraction of nanoparticles...|$|R

The flow past different surface <b>mounted</b> permeable <b>rib</b> geometries i. e. solid, slit, split-slit and inclined split-slit ribs have been investigated in this study. Both two-component and stereo Particle image velocimetry (PIV) {{have been used in}} streamwise and cross stream planes to study the underlying flow structures. The detailed turbulent statistics i. e. mean and rms velocity, higher order moments, quadrant decomposition of turbulent shear stress producing motions, skewness and components of the turbulent kinetic energy budgets have been compared for different rib geometries. The reattachment length of the inclined split-slit rib is lowest among all rib geometries. The average Reynolds stresses and the production of turbulent kinetic energy are highest for the inclined split-slit rib. The pressure transport calculated as residual of the turbulent kinetic energy budget equation is highest for the inclined split-slit rib. This is attributed to the smaller reattachment length leading to greater adverse pressure gradient for the inclined split-slit rib. The quadrant motions, turbulent fluxes, skewness and kinetic energy budgets at post reattachment region compares well with that of flat plate turbulent boundary layer from hot wire measurements in literature. Overall, this study demonstrates the effectiveness of PIV technique for the detailed turbulent structures characterization of complex flows...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the effectiveness of}} the flexible wheels for lunar exploration rovers. The flexible wheels give high performance while traversing loose soil. The flexible wheel is an effective scheme to traverse loose soil without poor performance. The flexible wheel has a surface which can be changed flexibly for rough terrain. When the surface of wheel performs matching the shape of ground it is crossing, the normal stress between the wheel and loose soil becomes small. It is prevented from sinking because this normal stress is small. However, the flexible wheel doesn’t have high performance without grousers. The grouser is very important to get thrust for rovers. From running experiments using a single wheel tester, we found that the flexible wheel with grousers gave a high performance. The mounted positions of grousers {{on the surface of the}} wheel are defined by the same angle (ex) 36 deg). This means that there are two patterns to mount grousers. One is under the rib while the other is between the ribs. The spring force under the rib is different from between the ribs, it is greater. Moreover, each distortion is different. From these considerations, we need to find the optimal position for grousers. We carried out running experiments using wheels with both patterns. From our experiments, we understood the wheel with the position <b>mounted</b> between <b>ribs</b> gave a better performance than when it was set under the rib. When the area giving normal stress is wide, soil under the wheel becomes hard. Therefore, the wheel with grousers <b>mounted</b> be-tween <b>ribs</b> gives a higher performance compared with the one <b>mounted</b> under the <b>ribs...</b>|$|R

The heat transfer results revealed significant differences among these three cases, showing that the existence of gaps increases the heat transfer. Particularly, the local heat transfer on the wall between the consecutive ribs is higher in the near-side wall region than in the central region.

Additional secondary vortical structures are present behind the permeable ribs due to the flow through the perforations. The use of particle image velocimetry (PIV) for these flows is expected to improve the understanding of underlying flow structures. However, the use of PIV for these flows in literature has been limited to mean velocities and their second moment statistics i. e. rms quantities. The present study presents the detailed turbulent statistics i. e. mean and rms velocity, higher order moments, the quadrant decomposition of turbulent shear stress producing motions, large and small scale contributions from wavelet analysis and components of the turbulent kinetic energy budgets i. e. convection, diffusion, dissipation and production etc. from two-component and stereo PIV measurements.

The Volume of Fluid (VOF) method is employed {{as well as}} a phase change model. Appropriate models are incorporated into the Ansys Fluent by the user-defined functions to carry out the computations. The ribbed surface is modeled as a finned surface and a conjugate transient heat transfer problem is formulated for predicting fluid flow currents and heat transfer. The effect of rib material and shapes is also studied. Numerical results indicate that the pressure rise can be reduced by <b>ribs</b> <b>mounted</b> on the tank wall. This phenomenon is more pronounced as the rib spacing-to-height ratio is reduced. A vortex is observed in the downstream region of each rib when the spacing-to-height has a relatively high value. Evaporation occurs as time elapses due to heat accumulation at the rib surfaces. Pressure starts to rise later with high thermal conductivity ribs and becomes higher with low thermal conductivity ribs when the ribs are of identical configuration in geometry. The final pressure rise seems to be monotonically versus increasing time. The semicircular ribs perform better than rectangular ones in control of the pressure rise and thermal stratification for identical cross sectional area and if the locations are kept the same.

40|$|Experiments were {{performed}} to determine secondary flow development and Nusselt number distributions for laminar mixed convection in the thermal entry region of a parallel plate channel heated uniformly from below. Flow visualization showed the onset of secondary flow on the heater surface and revealed the developing longitudinal plumes and vortices. Longitudinal distributions of the local Nusselt number initially followed forced convection. Subsequent mixing associated {{with the development of}} secondary flow caused Nusselt numbers to rise to an initial maximum before decreasing slightly and assuming a fully developed value. Simultaneous flow visualization and heat transfer measurements showed that noticeable secondary flow development preceeded any appreciable increase in heat transfer. Data were scaled with z and Ra to delineate locations for the onset of secondary flow, onset of enhancement, and the maximum Nusselt number, and a correlation was developed to predict fully developed conditions. In addition, numerical analysis was used to predict flow acceleration and heat transfer enhancement in a stable, two-dimensional boundary layer and computations were verified by comparison to experimental data for similar conditions. ^ Additional computations {{were performed}} to investigate fully developed laminar mixed convection in a channel with longitudinal fins. In general, the effect of the additional surface area was largely offset by a reduction in the strength of the buoyancy-driven secondary flow, resulting in only a modest increase in performance. Experiments for fully developed flow between a heated isothermal bottom plate and a cooled upper plate were also performed. Fins mounted on the bottom surface greatly increased heat transfer for forced convection, but had a much smaller effect on fully developed mixed convection. In some instances, the fins reduced heat transfer. ^ Further experiments concentrated on measuring and enhancing heat transfer from a heated upper surface, which is largely unaffected by mixed convection. Perforated <b>ribs</b> <b>mounted</b> on the top surface effectively enhanced heat transfer, while vortex generators had only a slight effect beyond that of mixed convection alone. This smaller effect was attributed to the correspondence between the flow driven by the vortex generators and the buoyancy driven vortices. ...|$|R
