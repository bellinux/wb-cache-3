25|$|François Coignet was a French {{industrialist}} of {{the nineteenth}} century, {{a pioneer in the}} development of structural, prefabricated and reinforced concrete. Coignet was the first to use iron-reinforced concrete as a technique for constructing building structures. In 1853 Coignet built the first iron reinforced concrete structure, a four story house at 72 rue Charles Michels in the suburbs of Paris. Coignet's descriptions of reinforcing concrete suggests that he did not do it for means of adding strength to the concrete but for keeping walls in <b>monolithic</b> <b>construction</b> from overturning. In 1854, English builder William B. Wilkinson reinforced the concrete roof and floors in the two-storey house he was constructing. His positioning of the reinforcement demonstrated that, unlike his predecessors, he had knowledge of tensile stresses.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to durability and expense, Wright incorporated {{such factors as}} thermal comfort into the design. First, he indicated that concrete construction would keep the house cooler {{in the summer and}} warmer in the winter. Concrete walls have greater thermal mass than walls of wood, and thereby lessen temperature fluctuations during the day and throughout the year. Furthermore, the roof overhang would have reduced overheating by shading part of the walls in summer. A third feature was perhaps the most innovative: Wright specified that the ceilings for the second floor rooms be installed eight inches below the roof slab. The resulting air space was to be fed by vents beneath the eaves and exhausted through the chimney to create a constant stream of moving air. Modern homes often use a similar soffit and ridge vent combination to keep the attic and the floor below cooler. Yet, at the time of publication, most wood houses lacked attic ventilation because buildings were not constructed as tightly as those built in recent years. The <b>monolithic</b> <b>construction</b> of the Fireproof House would have prevented most natural air infiltration, making the ventilated air space a necessity.|$|E
5000|$|It is {{generally}} agreed that St Mary Bishophill Junior is the oldest surviving church within the city walls. The church is situated within what was the colonia or civil quarter of the Roman garrison of Eboracum and pieces of Roman tilework can be observed found in the Tower. The tower itself is of the late Anglo-Saxon period with masonry of very mixed materials, including blocks of brown sandstone and limestone blocks, some laid in herringbone fashion; the quoins are mainly of brown sandstone laid in a [...] "side-alternate" [...] fashion and with no buttresses, factors which often mark Anglo-Saxon architecture. Another typical feature {{is found in the}} double-arched belfry windows with a single round column dividing them, in this case outlined in strip-work, with the imposts on the columns projecting out from the wall. The rather plain lower section tapers slightly from base to top, with the decoration of the belfry section on each of the four sides. Inside the church is reported [...] "the finest pre-Conquest tower arch". There are also fragments of pre-Conquest stonework inside this church. Adjacent to this site there was formerly St Mary Bishophill Senior, with early Anglo-Saxon features such as <b>monolithic</b> <b>construction,</b> on the base of a Romano-British wall which could possibly also have been a church. There is now no trace of this, although it was reported to stand as a ruin in 1961.|$|E

50|$|Jonathan Sergison and Stephen Bates met in London in {{the early}} 1990s and {{were part of a}} group of architects, theorists and artists who met {{regularly}} between 1994 and 1995. The group (informally called Papers on architecture) had a common interest in the urban character of London and the work of Alison and Peter Smithson. Among the earliest realised projects by Sergison Bates architects are the public house (pub) in Walsall and the semi-detached house in Stevenage, both of which use motifs of informal architecture. A number of other small scale projects, primarily in London, followed, which also displayed an interest in creating a robust architectural expression through the use of lightweight low-tech construction methods (i.e. thin brick-slip façade panels on the Studio house in Bethnal Green and cement boards as cladding for a timber panel structure in the self-build housing project in Tilbury). This preoccupation with breathing layered wall constructions culminated in the exhibition project and book “Brick-work: thinking and making”. The unrealised competition design for a museum on the Danish island Bornholm (included in “Brick-work”) indicated a shift towards a more heavy and <b>monolithic</b> <b>construction</b> form and spatial expression. Two examples of this change in direction are the Urban housing project in Finsbury Park built with a loadbearing wall of brickwork and precast concrete, and the Centre for the applied arts in Ruthin that adopted structure and pigmented façade elements made of concrete cast in situ. From 2010 Sergison Bates architects were awarded commissions through design competitions for projects in Flanders (Belgium), Switzerland and Austria. In 2016 the firm completed their most prestigious building to date, the Welcome centre and offices for the Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research in Shanghai (China).|$|E

40|$|Nowadays in Russian Federation {{there is}} a growing demand for <b>monolithic</b> <b>construction.</b> <b>Monolithic</b> <b>construction</b> {{technology}} is developing to meet the requirements, such as reduction of construction time and improvement {{of the quality of the}} structures. Analysis of different situations that arise on construction sites shows a number of usual problems: increased construction period, increased cost, etc. Possible reason of this problem can be in using outdated approaches to the control of <b>monolithic</b> <b>construction</b> processes. Such approaches do not take into account deviations due to the abrupt changes caused by external influence of the environment. And it can lead to increase in technological expectations or increase in labor costs for eliminating these deviations. This article presents an approach, which helps to increase the efficiency of process organization in <b>monolithic</b> <b>construction</b> by means of adaptive control and operative control in real time. This approach is based on the methods of operative monitoring and processing of information about the state of the production system at any given time. In this paper organizational scheme for combining different production and control processes was developed, which is based on the following principles: Choice of criteria for comprehensive assessment of a production system, that reflect both internal state and external disturbances; Development of the methods and means of operational monitoring of the structures(includes previously selected criteria); Development of the methods of constructing situation models of the production system functioning (including modeling the hydration process of concrete and the influence of external factors on this process). Development of the methods of research and information decision support based on automated processing of information, obtained in the course of monitoring, and on the analysis of available options of controlling actions.
