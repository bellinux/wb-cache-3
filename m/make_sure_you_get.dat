2500|$|Zissu was interrogated {{for some}} three years, and {{tortured}} {{at the hands}} of Securitate Lieutenant-Major Teodor Micle. He refused to sign any preordained confession, and made sure to write down and sign all his statements.

During the proceedings, Zissu lashed out at his co-defendant Benvenisti, who had caved in during the interrogation.

25|$|Adding to {{the growing}} {{tensions}} between the Congressional Union and NAWSA, Burns made a radical proposal once again at the 1913 NAWSA convention in Washington, D.C. Because Democrats controlled the White House and both houses of Congress at the time, Burns wanted {{to give them an}} ultimatum—support our bill for suffrage or we will <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> don’t <b>get</b> reelected. Burns stated “Inaction establishes just as clear a record as does a policy of open hostility.” She was no longer going to stand for the apathy from the Democratic Party. Burns was particularly infuriated with President Wilson because he had told them he would support the Committee on Suffrage, but then never mentioned his promise in his address to Congress. When a delegation of women from NAWSA tried to meet with him to address this incident and register their protest, Wilson claimed to be ill. A few days later, Wilson reneged his vow to support suffrage and said he would not impose his private views on Congress.|$|R

50|$|For Clive Lloyd {{this was}} the final humiliation he was {{prepared}} to let his team suffer. He told his spinners after the match, 'Gentlemen, I gave you 400 runs to bowl at and you failed to bowl out the opposition. How many runs must I give you in the future to <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> that <b>you</b> <b>get</b> the wickets?' In fact Lloyd decided to dispense with the use of slow bowlers. He argued that the spinners at his disposal were not of the required quality and he was forced to play them through tradition and the convention that cricket teams always included at least one slow bowler. He felt that West-Indian strength lay in their crop of young fast bowlers, and the experiences of his team in Australia had demonstrated how the high-quality, hostile pace attack of Dennis Lillee and Jeff Thomson could intimidate the opposition batting.|$|R

60|$|Write down then, frankly, {{what you}} are, or, at least, {{what you think}} yourself, not {{dwelling}} upon those inevitable faults which I have just told you are of little consequence, and which the action of a right life will shake or smooth away; but that you may determine {{to the best of}} your intelligence what you are good for and can be made into. You will find that the mere resolve not to be useless, and the honest desire to help other people, will, in the quickest and delicatest ways, improve yourself. Thus, from the beginning, consider all your accomplishments as means of assistance to others; read attentively, in this volume, paragraphs 74, 75, 19, and 79, {3} and you will understand what I mean, with respect to languages and music. In music especially you will soon find what personal benefit there is in being serviceable: it is probable that, however limited your powers, you have voice and ear enough to sustain a note of moderate compass in a concerted piece;--that, then, is the first thing to <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> can do. <b>Get</b> your voice disciplined and clear, and think only of accuracy; never of effect or expression: if you have any soul worth expressing, it will show itself in your singing; but most likely there are very few feelings in you, at present, needing any particular expression; and the one thing you have to do is to make a clear-voiced little instrument of yourself, which other people can entirely depend upon for the note wanted. So, in drawing, as soon as you can set down the right shape of anything, and thereby explain its character to another person, or make the look of it clear and interesting to a child, you will begin to enjoy the art vividly for its own sake, and all your habits of mind and powers of memory will gain precision: but if you only try to make showy drawings for praise, or pretty ones for amusement, your drawing will have little of real interest for you, and no educational power whatever.|$|R

60|$|Washington, Monday forenoon, Dec. 29, 1862. DEAR, DEAR MOTHER--Friday the 19th inst. I {{succeeded in}} {{reaching}} the camp of the 51st New York, and found George[1] alive and well. In order to <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> that <b>you</b> would <b>get</b> the good news, I sent back by messenger to Washington a telegraphic dispatch (I dare say <b>you</b> did not <b>get</b> {{it for some}} time) {{as well as a}} letter--and the same to Hannah[2] at Burlington. I have staid in camp with George ever since, till yesterday, when I came back to Washington, about the 24th. George got Jeff's[3] letter of the 20th. Mother, how much you must have suffered, all that week, till George's letter came--and all the rest must too. As to me, I know I put in about three days of the greatest suffering I ever experienced in my life. I wrote to Jeff how I had my pocket picked in a jam and hurry, changing cars, at Philadelphia--so that I landed here without a dime. The next two days I spent hunting through the hospitals, walking day and night, unable to ride, trying to get information--trying to get access to big people, etc.--I could not get the least clue to anything. Odell would not see me at all. But Thursday afternoon, I lit on a way to get down on the Government boat that runs to Aquia creek, and so by railroad to the neighborhood of Falmouth, opposite Fredericksburg--so by degrees I worked my way to Ferrero's[4] brigade, which I found Friday afternoon without much trouble after I got in camp. When I found dear brother George, and found that he was alive and well, O you may imagine how trifling all my little cares and difficulties seemed--they vanished into nothing. And now that I have lived for eight or nine days amid such scenes as the camps furnish, and had a practical part in it all, and realize the way that hundreds of thousands of good men are now living, and have had to live for a year or more, not only without any of the comforts, but with death and sickness and hard marching and hard fighting (and no success at that) for their continual experience--really nothing we call trouble seems worth talking about. One of the first things that met my eyes in camp was a heap of feet, arms, legs, etc., under a tree in front of a hospital, the Lacy house.|$|R
