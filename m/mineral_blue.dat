50|$|One of {{the most}} famous of the older-known localities of {{fluorite}} is Castleton in Derbyshire, England, where, under the name of Derbyshire Blue John, purple-blue fluorite was extracted from several mines or caves. During the 19th century, this attractive fluorite was mined for its ornamental value. The <b>mineral</b> <b>Blue</b> John is now scarce, and only a few hundred kilograms are mined each year for ornamental and lapidary use. Mining still takes place in Blue John Cavern and Treak Cliff Cavern.|$|E
50|$|Treak Cliff Cavern {{is a show}} cave near Castleton in Derbyshire, England. It {{is part of the}} Castleton Site of Special Scientific Interest and one of {{only two}} sites where the {{ornamental}} <b>mineral</b> <b>Blue</b> John is still excavated (the other is the nearby Blue John Cavern). As part of an agreement with English Nature, the Blue John that {{can be seen in the}} show cave is not mined but it is extracted in small quantities from other areas of the cave and made into saleable items like bowls, jewellery and ornaments.|$|E
50|$|Because of the {{attractive}} banding, and the rarity of the <b>mineral,</b> <b>Blue</b> John has commercial value and ornaments made from it are much sought after by collectors. Historically, {{as well as}} from Treak Cliff and Blue John Cavern, veins of the mineral were also worked from Old Tor Mine and another mine in Winnats Pass, and also from mines near Windy Knoll and Odin Mine, towards Mam Tor. Limited opencast extraction of Blue John took place on the top of Treak Cliff during World War II, and an incident of unofficial and illegal extraction from Old Tor Mine in the 1970s led to that mine being closed by order of H.M. Inspector of Mines, leaving Treak Cliff and Blue John Cavern as the two remaining sources of new stocks of the mineral. Both caves have a policy of supplying raw Blue John only to shops within Castleton, so the few outlets selling it elsewhere rely on old stocks.|$|E

40|$|HyperSpectral Imaging (HSI) can be {{considered}} as the evolution of classical spectroscopy, where “only” punctual analyses are carried out. The obtained 2 D information (i. e. one spectrum for each pixel of the target image) can be thus used to characterize, map and monitor the materials constituting cultural heritage. Such non-invasive diagnostic technique can be applied by mobile devices directly in situ. The adoption of HSI techniques allows the acquisition of the spectra without a direct physical contact and/or sampling of material objects under investigations. This research aims at the development of a methodology to classify different pigments through HSI. Reference samples were prepared using six pigments (i. e. red ocher, yellow ocher, chrome yellow, <b>mineral</b> <b>blue,</b> cobalt green, and malachite) mixed with egg tempera. The obtained products were then applied on two different supports (i. e. canvas and wood) in order to obtain different combinations among pigment/support. The spectral changes of each pigment with different supports were evaluated with reference to the spectrum of the original pigment in powder. The samples were acquired in the SWIR (1000 - 2500 nm) range by HSI.

After receipt hearts were kept in water for 6 hours, then they were perfused with polyester resin semi-synthetic and <b>mineral</b> <b>blue</b> color, moreover the left coronary artery was perfused with red mineral color. Subsequently, the hearts were subjected to a process of partial corrosion with potassium hydroxide (15 %), then the coronary sinus and its tributary branches were dissected from its origin to its distal segments, path, shapes, sizes, anastomosis and presence of registered anatomical variations. Photographic record of the samples was performed. Results. The distal caliber of Great cardiac vein (5. 36 +/- 1, 04 mm), its origin was determined from the apex at 70 % of anatomical pieces it studied was determined and the ventricular groove paraconal 30 % of the pieces analyzed. The arteriovenous trigone was found in 58 of cardiac structures studied (96. 66 %). Conclusion. The description of the anatomic variations present in the pig heart structure will contribute to the possibility of xenotransplantation and also provides data for the development of studies on cardiovascular surgery and certain diseases of clinical and epidemiological importance.

40|$|The {{possibility}} {{to perform a}} full characterization and identification of pigments in pictorial layers {{represents one of the}} most challenging targets in the field of cultural heritage, especially if their fulfillment is achieved setting up not invasive and not destructive analytical procedures. In this perspective, HyperSpectral Imaging (HSI) based sensing architectures, acting in the VIS-NIR and SWIR wavelength ranges, can represent an important diagnostic tool to realize the monitoring of paintings, as well as to evaluate their preservation status [1]. The goal {{of this study is to}} evaluate the alteration of different pictorial layers, as resulting from the combination of different supports, pigments and binders, according to different irradiation times. Starting from the result of recent studies [2], 6 pigments were thus mixed (i. e. red ocher, yellow ocher, chrome yellow, <b>mineral</b> <b>blue,</b> cobalt green and malachite) with four different binders (i. e. Arabic gum, gouache, egg tempera, and linseed oil), applying them on two different media (i. e. wood and canvas). The resulting samples have been aged in solar box and acquired at different aging times. Surface spectra of each sample were then acquired in VIS-NIR and SWIR ranges. Starting from the collected information (i. e. hypercube) chemometric techniques have been utilized to extract and handle pictorial layers information. The sequential application of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Partial Least Square-Discriminant Analysis (PLSDA) was then applied in order to study the pictorial layers spectra variations linked to the effects of the applied aging cycles. The sensing architectures have been designed and implemented, both at hardware and software level, in order to perform both in-situ (i. e. directly where the painting is) and ex-situ (i. e. at laboratory scale) analyses. The results showed as the developed modelling procedure allows to correctly predict sample characteristics and composition. Furthermore, it is objective, rapid and non-destructive. The implementation of such approach could allow to perform a full monitoring of the state of conservation and/or the characterization of materials and/or supports not easy to assess with conventional techniques...|$|E

40|$|NIR {{spectroscopy}} of two turquoise minerals {{of different}} origins with formula Cu(Al 6 -x,Fex) (PO 4) 4 (OH) 8. 4 H 2 O {{have been studied}} and a comparison of their NIR, UV-Visible and mid-IR spectra made. UV-Vis and NIR reflectance spectroscopy {{is the most effective}} approach for detection and determination of transition metal ions that cause colour to minerals and semi-precious gems such as turquoise. The UV-Vis spectra of two turquoise <b>minerals</b> (<b>blue</b> and green) reported in this research are distinctly different. The spectra confirm the difference in the origin of the colours of the minerals. The paramagnetism of the <b>blue</b> <b>mineral</b> arises mainly from divalent copper. Turquoise from Senegal has a replacement of some Al(III) by Fe(III) in the structure. NIR spectroscopy identifies the bands attributed to the hydroxyl units. The NIR spectroscopic technique is most sensitive in detecting Fe 2 + even though it is present in very low concentrations in turquoise from Senegal. IR spectra of the two mineral samples are very similar in the 1200 to 900 cm- 1 region but strong differences are observed in the 900 to 100 cm- 1 region. The effect of substitution of Fe for Al in turquoise from Senegal shifts the bands to lower wavenumbers. Factor group analysis (FGA) implies four OH stretching vibrations for both the water and hydroxyl units. Two bands ascribed to water are observed in theses samples at ~ 3280 and 3070 cm- 1 and three hydroxyl stretching vibrations are observed. The combination of these bands and their fundamental overtones give rise to many of the features of the NIR spectra...|$|R
