40|$|Method {{layout of}} a casting is an {{important}} aspect of tooling development. It involves decisions regarding part orientation in <b>mould,</b> <b>parting</b> <b>line,</b> cores, cavity layout, feeders, neck and gating system. An improper method layout leads either poor quality or low yield, which affects the productivity. Method design is mostly carried out manually, using 2 D drawing of the cast part. Then tooling is fabricated the sample castings are produced to 3 - 4 trials which involves lot of production cost in the from of wastage of manpower, time and hamper the day to day schedule of the particular production. Computer simulation provides a clear insight regarding the location and extent of internal defects, ensuring casting are right as first time and every time. In the present study plate castings were considered to study the solidification behavior of Aluminium Alloy (LM 6) at different sizes of riser and riser neck. The VEM based casting simulation software is used to study the solidification behavior of above castings. The simulated results were compared with the experimental results. It is expected that this work will be of immense importance equally to the academicians {{as well as to the}} industrial methoding engineers...|$|E

Note to Practitioners — Molding {{is the process of}} manufacturing a part by shaping a pliable raw material, such as molten plastic or metal, using a rigid mold. The material hardens and sets inside the mold, adopting its shape. To remove the part from the mold without destroying the mold, the mold must be made of multiple pieces. In the simplest case, a two-part mold is used, and these parts are separated in opposite directions. The curves {{on the surface of the}} part where the pieces of the mold meet are called ‘parting lines’. For a manufacturing perspective, a smooth <b>parting</b> <b>line</b> is more applicable than a theoretically correct <b>parting</b> <b>line.</b> We give a novel method to compute such a <b>parting</b> <b>line</b> in this paper.

Parting <b>lines</b> corresponding to the three possible parting directions are estimated using a slice method. Finally, criteria such as undercut, draw, projected area and flatness in all parting directions are quantified using the dexel model of the part.

40|$|Casting and molding {{are popular}} {{manufacturing}} processes that transform molten materials into designed solid shapes. A gate and a mold cavity (impression) {{are the two}} necessary components of a molding process. Proper selection of a location for the gate is a challenging issue, which is commonly conducted by complex thermal and fluid simulations. In addition, mold pieces (cavities) generation from a given molded part usually consumes much time and labor as CAD software provides very limited functions for mold design. A simple and effective automation system of mold design is needed to dramatically reduce the cycle time of developing new products. The objective of this thesis is to propose a design framework for automated gate location selection and mold shape (cavity) generation. Reaction injection molding (RIM) is a molding process becoming more popular as it has wide applications and superior processing conditions. The critical requirement in RIM is that the filling time is short enough to allow the curable resins to fill up the mold before polymerization. Besides increasing injection pressure, proper selection of a gate location is an important element to achieve this requirement. From a geometric point of view, the geodesic center of a molded part is {{a good candidate for}} a gate location as it gives the shortest flow length. However, the geodesic center of a 3 -D object is difficult to obtain. The Surface Contraction Method (SCM) proposed in this thesis is to approximate the geodesic center. This method, which is implemented on a voxel-based model representing a 3 -D object, suffers easily from artificial breakages. To prevent artificial breakages, three breakpoint-checking rules were developed to guarantee the connectivity of the surface contracted object. This enables the object to contract smoothly into the approximate geodesic center without artificial breakages. The SCM was applied to several illustrative cases and the resultant gate locations are in line with physical expectations. Experiments were also conducted to verify the effectiveness of the SCM. Many researchers considered mold shape (cavity) generation as simply looking for <b>parting</b> <b>lines.</b> However, <b>parting</b> <b>lines</b> alone cannot fully define the mold cavity in cases with inner <b>parting</b> <b>lines.</b> In the thesis, the concept of a contact line is introduced to fully define the mold cavity with inner <b>parting</b> <b>lines.</b> A draft angle can also be added to the mold halves to reduce the difficulty of assembly. In order to automate the process of mold shape generation, new algorithms implemented on the voxel model are proposed. The algorithms determine not only the <b>parting</b> <b>lines,</b> but also the surface points of the cavities of mold halves...|$|R
