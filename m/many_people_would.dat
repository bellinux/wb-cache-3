5|$|Singing was {{sporadic}} and in {{a cappella}} or occasionally there would be singing in tongues. There were periods of extended silence. Attenders were occasionally slain in the Spirit. Visitors gave their testimony, and members read aloud testimonies that {{were sent to the}} mission by mail. There was prayer for the gift of tongues. There was prayer in tongues for the sick, for missionaries, and whatever requests were given by attenders or mailed in. There was spontaneous preaching and altar calls for salvation, sanctification and baptism of the Holy Spirit. Lawrence Catley, whose family attended the revival, said that in most services preaching consisted of Seymour opening a Bible and worshippers coming forward to preach or testify as they were led by the Holy Spirit. <b>Many</b> <b>people</b> <b>would</b> continually shout throughout the meetings. The members of the mission never took an offering, but there was a receptacle near the door for anyone that wanted to support the revival. The core membership of the Azusa Street Mission was never much more than 50–60 individuals with hundreds and thousands of people visiting or staying temporarily over the years.|$|E
5|$|The coyote {{plays a role}} {{in various}} mythologies and {{creation}} myths of Native American folklore. It is variously credited for having brought fire to humanity, releasing the bison into the world, and of having slain monsters by petrifying them. The Maidu creation myth has the coyote introducing work, suffering, and death to the world. Zuni folklore has the coyote bringing winter into the world by stealing light from the kachinas. Some tribes, such as the Chinook, Maidu, Paiute, Pawnee, Tohono O'odham, and Ute portray the coyote as the companion of the creator. In the Paiute creation myth, the coyote was created by the wolf as a companion, and the two created land by piling soil on the water-covered world. A Tohono O'odham flood myth has the coyote helping Montezuma survive a global deluge that destroys humanity. After the Great Mystery creates humanity, the coyote and Montezuma teach people how to live. The Crow creation myth portrays Old Man Coyote as the creator. In Navajo mythology, the coyote was present in the First World with First Man and First Woman, though a different version has it being created in the Fourth World. The Navajo coyote brings death into the world, explaining that without death, too <b>many</b> <b>people</b> <b>would</b> exist, thus no room to plant corn.|$|E

25|$|Flair won {{his last}} world titles {{in his career}} by winning the WCW World Heavyweight Championship twice during 2000, the company's last full year of operation. When WCW was {{purchased}} by the WWF in March 2001, Flair {{was the leader of}} the villainous group called the Magnificent Seven. Flair lost the final match of Nitro to Sting, recreating the second match of Nitro in 1995. Nevertheless, Flair has repeatedly stated in various interviews how happy he was when WCW finally closed down, although {{at the same time the}} fact that <b>many</b> <b>people</b> <b>would</b> lose their jobs saddened him.|$|E
25|$|North Korea {{possesses}} {{a vast array}} of long range artillery in shelters just north of the Korean Demilitarized Zone. It has been a long standing cause for concern that a preemptive strike or retaliatory strike on Seoul using this arsenal of artillery north of the Demilitarized Zone would lead to a massive loss of life in Seoul. Estimates on how <b>many</b> <b>people</b> <b>would</b> die in an attack on Seoul vary. When the Clinton administration mobilized forces over the reactor at Yongbyon in 1994, planners concluded that retaliation by North Korea against Seoul could kill 40,000 people. Other estimates projects hundreds of thousands or possibly millions of fatalities if North Korea uses chemical munitions.|$|E
25|$|The Supreme Electoral Council of Turkey (YSK) {{repeated}} {{its highly}} controversial decision which it initially {{took in the}} local elections to print {{a substantial amount of}} ballot papers more than necessary, totalling 75,708,180. It was reported that the YSK had printed 18 million more ballot papers more than the total number of registered voters. The YSK responded to questions regarding its decision by stating that it was required by law to print extra ballot papers. The YSK president Sadi Güven also stated that the uncertainty of how <b>many</b> <b>people</b> <b>would</b> vote at customs gates was also a factor behind the decision to send a disproportionately large number of ballot papers to national borders. However, the OSCE stated that there was no legal basis for printing such a large amount of ballot papers.|$|E

25|$|He {{reached the}} port of Chittagong in modern-day Bangladesh {{intending}} to travel to Sylhet to meet Shah Jalal, who became so renowned that Ibn Battuta, then in Chittagong, made a one-month journey through the mountains of Kamaru near Sylhet to meet him. On his way to Sylhet, Ibn Battuta was greeted by several of Shah Jalal's disciples {{who had come to}} assist him on his journey many days before he had arrived. At the meeting in 1345 CE, Ibn Battuta noted that Shah Jalal was tall and lean, fair in complexion and lived by the mosque in a cave, where his only item of value was a goat he kept for milk, butter, and yogurt. He observed that the companions of the Shah Jalal were foreign and known for their strength and bravery. He also mentions that <b>many</b> <b>people</b> <b>would</b> visit the Shah to seek guidance. Ibn Battuta went further north into Assam, then turned around and continued with his original plan.|$|E
25|$|The police {{plan was}} to move in at midnight on September 14 and evict the house while the squatters were still in their beds. In past evictions, the police did not assault a house until long after {{the moment of the}} deadline, and the hope was to take the squatters by {{surprise}} and minimize the time available for them to prepare their defense. A couple of days before the eviction was to take place, posters were hung up all over the city. The posters invited people to come to a demonstration in support of the house. The poster showed a large image of a burning car and the text said {{that it was a good}} idea to show up with your face masked. This did raise some eyebrows at police headquarters, but in the end the police estimated that it was just a coincidence and that nothing big was underway. The police also thought that since the demonstration was held at 10:00 pm on a Sunday, not <b>many</b> <b>people</b> <b>would</b> attend.|$|E
500|$|Due to its popularity, The Walking Dead has {{inspired}} dozens of parodies and spoofs featured on YouTube channels like Bad Lip Reading and TV {{shows such as}} Saturday Night Live and Mad TV. Bad Lip Reading made a widely viewed parody involving Rick and the Governor, entitled [...] "La-Bibbida-Bibba-Dum". The series' cast was shown the parody at the San Diego Comic-Con in 2013, and David Morrisseywho portrays the Governor reacted by saying he now understood why so <b>many</b> <b>people</b> <b>would</b> walk up {{to him on the}} street and blurt, [...] "Hey, La-Bibbida-Bibba-Dum!". Until seeing the video, he had wondered, [...] "what's wrong with these people?" [...] The Walking Dead has also been represented as a live comedy performance by English comedian Dan Willis at the Edinburgh Festival.|$|E

500|$|During the Alive or Just Breathing {{recording}} sessions, Killswitch Engage recorded 15 songs. Three of {{the songs}} were re-recordings of songs from the band's debut album. Stroetzel stated that the band decided to re-record [...] "Temple From the Within", [...] "Vide Infra", and [...] "In the Unblind" [...] because at the time, Killswitch Engage was unsure of how <b>many</b> <b>people</b> <b>would</b> ever hear Killswitch Engage because it was released through a small label. [...] "Temple From the Within" [...] and [...] "Vide Infra" [...] made it onto Alive or Just Breathing. [...] "In the Unblind" [...] and two newly written songs titled [...] "When the Balance is Broken" [...] and [...] "Untitled and Unloved" [...] respectively, {{did not make it}} on to the album, but would eventually be heard on the 2005 reissue of Alive or Just Breathing.|$|E
500|$|Pausch {{was then}} {{introduced}} by Steve Sea-bolt, {{who was the}} Vice President of Worldwide Publishing and Marketing at Electronic Arts, {{in addition to being}} Pausch's close friend and former co-worker. Sea-bolt began with a joke referring to Electronic Arts, and another joke about a bet he and Pausch had made about how <b>many</b> <b>people</b> <b>would</b> attend the lecture, saying that [...] "...depending upon whose version of the story you hear, he either owes me 20 dollars or his new Volkswagen." [...] Seabolt began the next part of the introduction by talking about Pausch's academic achievements and previous career with the University of Virginia and Electronic Arts. Seabolt concluded his introduction by describing the qualities of Pausch, saying that [...] "Randy's dedication to making {{the world a better place}} is self evident to anyone who has crossed paths with him." [...] He described how his accomplishments had affected others, as well as his wife and three children. Seabolt then turned the speech over to Pausch, who was greeted with a standing ovation.|$|E
500|$|In {{reply to}} a {{question}} in 1996 about his religious beliefs, Carl Sagan answered, [...] "I'm agnostic." [...] Sagan maintained {{that the idea of}} a creator God of the Universe was difficult to prove or disprove and that the only conceivable scientific discovery that could challenge it would be an infinitely old universe. Sagan's views on religion have been interpreted as a form of pantheism comparable to Einstein's belief in Spinoza's God. His son, Dorion Sagan said, [...] "My father believed in the God of Spinoza and Einstein, God not behind nature but as nature, equivalent to it." [...] His last wife, Ann Druyan, stated: When my husband died, because he was so famous and known for not being a believer, <b>many</b> <b>people</b> <b>would</b> come up to me—it still sometimes happens—and ask me if Carl changed at the end and converted to a belief in an afterlife. They also frequently ask me if I think I will see him again. Carl faced his death with unflagging courage and never sought refuge in illusions. The tragedy was that we knew we would never see each other again. I don't ever expect to be reunited with Carl.|$|E

500|$|Swift {{was very}} fond of Caillat's 2007 debut album, Coco. Swift explained, [...] "When it came out, I {{fell in love with}} the way that she makes music." [...] Swift later {{contacted}} her management and asked if she could write a song with Caillat. They confirmed Caillat would be available due to a then upcoming concert in Nashville, Tennessee and, coincidentally, on the same day, Swift had a vacation day. According to Swift, [...] "Breathe" [...] is about having to depart from a someone, however, not blaming anyone. Swift believed the scenario was one of the most difficult goodbyes, [...] "when it's nobody's fault. It just has to end." [...] Swift explained, [...] "It was total therapy because I came in and I was like look, 'One of my best friends, I'm gonna have to not see anymore and it's not gonna be part of what I do. It's the hardest thing to go through. It's crazy listening to the song because you would think it's about a relationship and it's really about losing a friend and having a fallout." [...] Caillat and Swift said one of the beauties of the song was that <b>many</b> <b>people</b> <b>would</b> be able to relate to it because it is never specific as why the departure is occurring or whose fault it was.|$|E

The advertising was clearly targeted at middle and lower-middle-class people seeking to improve themselves. The advertising campaign was remarkably successful; over 70,000 sets were sold, bringing in over £600,000pounds profit.

50|$|In {{presenting}} {{these arguments}} Orwell {{takes on the}} role of devil's advocate.

2500|$|However, {{the program}} {{is far from being}} universally {{accepted}} by Brazilian society.

The Catholic Church, through its powerful National Conference of Bishops of Brazil (CNBB), maintains that [...] "{{the program is}} addictive" [...] and leads its beneficiaries to an [...] "accommodation".|$|E

2500|$|According to {{a recent}} bio on MySpace, Atkins claims to have [...] "coined the term techno to {{describe}} their music, taking as one inspiration the works of Futurist and author Alvin Toffler, from whom he borrowed the terms 'cybotron' and 'metroplex.' Atkins has used the term to describe earlier bands that made heavy use of synthesizers, such as Kraftwerk, although <b>many</b> <b>people</b> <b>would</b> consider Kraftwerk's music and Juan's early music in Cybotron as electro." [...] Atkins viewed Cybotron's [...] "Cosmic Cars" [...] (1982) as unique, Germanic, synthesized funk, but he later heard Afrika Bambaataa's [...] "Planet Rock" [...] (1982) and considered {{it to be a}} superior example of the music he envisioned. Inspired, he resolved to continue experimenting, and he encouraged Saunderson and May to do likewise.|$|E
