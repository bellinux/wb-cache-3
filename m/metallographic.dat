500|$|The blade is [...] long, up to [...] wide (about 5cm {{from the}} crossguard) and [...] thick. The fuller is about [...] long and, on average, [...] wide. <b>Metallographic</b> {{analysis}} {{has shown that}} the blade was forged from unevenly carburized semi-hard bloomery steel. Apart from iron, the material contains, by weight, 0.6 percent of carbon, 0.153 percent of silicon, 0.092 percent of phosphorus, and other elements. Numerous slag inclusions found in the steel are typical for medieval iron smelting technology. Part of the blade was hardened by quenching. Unlike the hilt, the blade would have been fully functional as a weapon of war. The surface of the blade is covered with deep scratches along its length, a result of intensive cleaning from rust before every coronation, probably with sand or brick powder. Inactive spots of corrosion may be also found on the entire surface.|$|E
50|$|The {{surface of}} a <b>metallographic</b> {{specimen}} is prepared by various methods of grinding, polishing, and etching. After preparation, it is often analyzed using optical or electron microscopy. Using only <b>metallographic</b> techniques, a skilled technician can identify alloys and predict material properties.|$|E

5000|$|Holger F. Struer saw {{the need}} for a {{laboratory}} making chemical analysis in the strongly developing [...] "modern society", and in 1895 Struer began importing chemicals and instruments for the Danish market. In 1919 Struer obtained the Danish representation of the Austrian company, Reichert, a specialist in <b>metallographic</b> microscopes. The combination of chemical knowledge and the sale of <b>metallographic</b> microscopes changed the focus of Struer's company to metallography and <b>metallographic</b> analysis. In 1943 H. Struers Chemiske Laboratorium launched Micropol, and a new principle for electrolytic polishing was established.|$|E

50|$|<b>Metallographic</b> and X-ray {{diffraction}} {{can be used}} on kamacite {{to determine}} the shock history of a meteorite. Using hardness to determine shock histories has been experimented with but was found to be too unreliable. Vickers hardness test was applied to a number of kamacite samples and shocked meteorites were found to have values of 160-170 kg/mm and non-shocked meteorites can have values as high as 244 kg/mm. Shock causes a unique iron transformation structure that is able to be measured using <b>metallographic</b> and X-ray diffraction techniques. After using <b>metallographic</b> and X-ray diffraction techniques to determine shock history it was found that 49% of meteorites found on Earth contain evidence of shock.|$|E

5000|$|Beryllium is {{regarded}} extraordinarily hazardous to health upon enough amounts of dust, mists, or fumes consisting fragments little enough to inhale (typically 10µm or less). <b>Metallographic</b> preparation equipment and laboratory work surfaces must be damp wiped occasionally to inhibit buildup of particles. Cutting, grinding, and polishing procedures which manufacture dusts or fumes must be handled within sufficiently vented coverings supplied with particular filters.|$|E
50|$|Cellulose {{acetate film}} {{is also used}} to make {{replicates}} of materials and biological samples for microscopy. The techniques were developed for <b>metallographic</b> needs to examine the grain structure of polished metals. Replication can be used to understand the distribution, for example, of different types of iron in carbon steel samples, or the fine distribution of damage to a sample subject to mechanical wear.|$|E
5000|$|In 1966, Duncumb won the Charles Vernon Boys Prize (now {{known as}} the Moseley Medal) of the Institute of Physics for [...] "the design and {{construction}} of the scanning electron probe system for localized elemental analysis".

5000|$|Prepared {{specimens}} {{should be}} examined {{with the unaided eye}} after etching to detect any visible areas that have responded to the etchant differently from the norm as a guide to where microscopical examination should be employed. Light optical microscopy (LOM) examination should always be performed prior to any electron <b>metallographic</b> (EM) technique, as these are more time-consuming to perform and the instruments are much more expensive.|$|E
5000|$|The Prefil {{method is}} similar to PoDFA but, in {{addition}} to the <b>metallographic</b> analysis, Prefil provides also an immediate feedback on metal cleanliness from the metal flowrate through the filter. Because everything about the filtration is well controlled (pressure, metal temperature, ...), the only parameter affecting the filtration speed is the inclusion content. One can determine the cleanliness level from the filtration curve (weight of metal filtered as a function of time).|$|E
