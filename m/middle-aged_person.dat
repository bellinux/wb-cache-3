40|$|Objectives: This study {{investigated}} whether age affects Flemish Digit Triplet Test (DTT) scores, {{as well as}} sensitivity and specificity of the test to detect high-frequency hearing impairment in middle age. Design: DTT performance in broadband and low-pass filtered noise was assessed for 21 young and 61 <b>middle-aged</b> <b>persons</b> with normal-hear- ing sensitivity. Cutoff values based on their performance were used to evaluate sensitivity and specificity of the DTT as a screening tool in 145 <b>middle-aged</b> <b>persons,</b> with varying audiometric profiles. Results: DTT performance for normal-hearing persons depended on age in both noise conditions. For low-pass filtered noise, the trade-off between sensitivity and specificity also increased when age-adjusted cutoff values were applied for screening in middle age.

40|$|The strongest known {{risk factors}} for late-onset Alzheimer disease (LOAD) remain a {{positive}} family history and the APOE ε 4 allele. van Exel and colleagues used these known risk factors to identify high- and low-risk samples of <b>middle-aged</b> <b>persons</b> in whom they compared levels of inflammatory and vascular risk factors. They observed that, compared with controls, middle-aged offspring of families with a parental history of LOAD had higher blood pressures, lower ankle-brachial indices (measure of peripheral atherosclerosis), and increased production of proinflammatory cytokines in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated whole blood samples, associations that were independent of APOE genotype. This study adds to the {{growing body of evidence}} linking inflammatory mechanisms to Alzheimer disease risk and, especially when considered in light of the recently described association of genetic variation in the complement receptor 1 (CR 1) gene with LOAD, suggests that inflammatory biomarkers (whether causal or incidental) could be measured and perhaps used to risk-stratify <b>middle-aged</b> <b>persons</b> for early preventive and therapeutic interventions...|$|R
40|$|Background: Previous {{studies of}} the {{relation}} between age and body fat reached differing conclusions concerning the question of whether body fat is lower in the elderly than in <b>middle-aged</b> <b>persons.</b> Objective: The objectives of this study were to characterize the relation between age and body fat in 4 ethnic groups and test the hypothesis that body fat is lower in the elderly than in <b>middle-aged</b> <b>persons.</b> Design: Body fat was measured in a sample of 1324 volunteers aged 20 – 94 y by using a 4 -component model of body composi-tion. Four ethnic groups were studied: Asians, blacks, Puerto Ricans, and whites. Regression models were developed for fat mass and fat percentage as functions of age. Results: In {{all but one of the}} groups, a highly significant curvi-linear relation between age and body fat was found, indicating a peak amount of body fat in late middle age and lower amounts of body fat at younger and older ages (P < 0. 001). The age at which maximum body fat was predicted in the various groups ranged from 53 to 61 y for fat mass and from 55 to 71 y for fat percentage. In Puerto Rican men there was no significant rela-tion between age and fat mass, and the relation between age and fat percentage was linear and positively correlated. Conclusions: This study provided data on the relation between age and body fat in 4 ethnic groups and supported the hypoth-esis that body fat is lower in the elderly than in <b>middle-aged</b> <b>persons.</b> Am J Clin Nutr 1999; 69 : 1007 – 13...|$|R

If an accident happened in the great roystering family of eight or ten children (and when was not something happening to some of us?), and we were shut up in a sick-room, then duly as daylight came the quick step and cheerful face of Aunt Esther,--not solemn and lugubrious like so many sick-room nurses, but with a never failing flow of wit and story that could beguile even the most doleful into laughing at their own afflictions. I remember how a fit of the quinsy--most tedious of all sicknesses to an active child--was gilded and glorified into quite a fête by my having Aunt Esther all to myself for two whole days, {{with nothing to do}} but amuse me. She charmed me into smiling at the very pangs which had made me weep before, and of which she described her own experiences in a manner to make me think that, after all, the quinsy was something with an amusing side to it. Her knowledge of all sorts of medicines, gargles, and alleviatives, her perfect familiarity with every canon and law of good nursing and tending, was something that could only have come from long experience in those good old New England days when there were no nurses recognized as a class in the land, but when watching and the care of the sick were among those offices of Christian life which the families of a neighborhood reciprocally rendered each other. Even from early youth she had obeyed a special vocation as sister of charity in many a sick-room, and, with the usual keen intelligence of New England, had widened her powers of doing good by the reading of medical and physiological works. Her legends of nursing in those days of long typhus fever and other formidable and protracted forms of disease were to our ears quite wonderful, and we regarded her as a sort of patron saint of the sick-room. She seemed always so cheerful, so bright, and so devoted, that it never occurred to us youngsters to doubt that she enjoyed, above all things, being with us, waiting on us all day, watching over us by night, telling us stories, and answering, in her lively and always amusing and instructive way, that incessant fire of questions with which a child persecutes a grown person.|$|E

40|$|An independent, inverse {{association}} between cognitive function and all-cause mortality {{has been reported}} in elderly cohorts.

Cox proportional hazards modeling was used to determine whether all-cause mortality ascertained through 1997 was associated with each measure after adjustment for sociodemographic, biologic, psychologic, and behavioral risk factors. Without adjustment, there was a significantly lower mortality hazard associated with higher scores on all three measures. After covariate adjustment, the hazard ratios for the DWRT and the DSST remained significant (hazard ratio 1 -point DWRT score increment = 0. 90, 95 % confidence interval: 0. 84, 0. 97; hazard ratio 7 -point DSST score increment = 0. 86, 95 % confidence interval: 0. 80, 0. 93).

"A three days' visit at most, over there, is all I {{should have}} found possible," [...] Madame Munster remarked to her brother, {{after they had}} taken {{possession}} of the little white house. [...] "It {{would have been too}} intime--decidedly too intime. Breakfast, dinner, and tea en famille--it would {{have been the end of}} the world if I could have reached the third day." [...] And she made the same observation to her maid Augustine, an intelligent person, who enjoyed a liberal share of her confidence. Felix declared that he would willingly spend his life in the bosom of the Wentworth family; that they were the kindest, simplest, most amiable people in the world, and that he had taken a prodigious fancy to them all. The Baroness quite agreed with him that they were simple and kind; they were thoroughly nice people, and she liked them extremely. The girls were perfect ladies; it was impossible to be more of a lady than Charlotte Wentworth, in spite of her little village air. [...] "But as for thinking them the best company in the world," [...] said the Baroness, [...] "that is another thing; and as for wishing to live porte-a-porte with them, I should as soon think of wishing myself back in the convent again, to wear a bombazine apron and sleep in a dormitory." [...] And yet the Baroness was in high good humor; she had been very much pleased. With her lively perception and her refined imagination, she was capable of enjoying anything that was characteristic, anything that was good of its kind. The Wentworth household seemed to her very perfect in its kind--wonderfully peaceful and unspotted; pervaded by a sort of dove-colored freshness that had all the quietude and benevolence of what she deemed to be Quakerism, and yet seemed to be founded upon a degree of material abundance for which, in certain matters of detail, one might have looked in vain at the frugal little court of Silberstadt-Schreckenstein. She perceived immediately that her American relatives thought and talked very little about money; and this of itself made an impression upon Eugenia's imagination. She perceived at the same time that if Charlotte or Gertrude should ask their father for a very considerable sum he would at once place it in their hands; and this made a still greater impression. The greatest impression of all, perhaps, was made by another rapid induction. The Baroness had an immediate conviction that Robert Acton would put his hand into his pocket every day in the week if that rattle-pated little sister of his should bid him. The men in this country, said the Baroness, are evidently very obliging. Her declaration that she was looking for rest and retirement had been by no means wholly untrue; nothing that the Baroness said was wholly untrue. It is but fair to add, perhaps, that nothing that she said was wholly true. She wrote to a friend in Germany that it was a return to nature; it was like drinking new milk, and she was very fond of new milk. She said to herself, of course, that it would be a little dull; but there can be no better proof of her good spirits than the fact that she thought she should not mind its being a little dull. It seemed to her, when from the piazza of her eleemosynary cottage she looked out over the soundless fields, the stony pastures, the clear-faced ponds, the rugged little orchards, that she had never been in the midst of so peculiarly intense a stillness; it was almost a delicate sensual pleasure. It was all very good, very innocent and safe, and out of it something good must come. Augustine, indeed, who had an unbounded faith in her mistress's wisdom and far-sightedness, was a great deal perplexed and depressed. She was always ready to take her cue when she understood it; but she liked to understand it, and on this occasion comprehension failed. What, indeed, was the Baroness doing dans cette galere? what fish did she expect to land out of these very stagnant waters? The game was evidently a deep one. Augustine could trust her; but the sense of walking in the dark betrayed itself in the physiognomy of this spare, sober, sallow, <b>middle-aged</b> <b>person,</b> who had nothing in common with Gertrude Wentworth's conception of a soubrette, by the most ironical scowl that had ever rested upon the unpretending tokens of the peace and plenty of the Wentworths. Fortunately, Augustine could quench skepticism in action. She quite agreed with her mistress--or rather she quite out-stripped her mistress--in thinking that the little white house was pitifully bare. [...] "Il faudra," [...] said Augustine, [...] "lui faire un peu de toilette." [...] And she began to hang up portieres in the doorways; to place wax candles, procured after some research, in unexpected situations; to dispose anomalous draperies over the arms of sofas and the backs of chairs. The Baroness had brought with her to the New World a copious provision of the element of costume; and the two Miss Wentworths, when they came over to see her, were somewhat bewildered by the obtrusive distribution of her wardrobe. There were India shawls suspended, curtain-wise, in the parlor door, and curious fabrics, corresponding to Gertrude's metaphysical vision of an opera-cloak, tumbled about in the sitting-places. There were pink silk blinds in the windows, by which the room was strangely bedimmed; and along the chimney-piece was disposed a remarkable band of velvet, covered with coarse, dirty-looking lace. [...] "I have been making myself a little comfortable," [...] said the Baroness, much to the confusion of Charlotte, who had been on the point of proposing to come and help her put her superfluous draperies away. But what Charlotte mistook for an almost culpably delayed subsidence Gertrude very presently perceived to be the most ingenious, the most interesting, the most romantic intention. [...] "What is life, indeed, without curtains?" [...] she secretly asked herself; and she appeared to herself to have been leading hitherto an existence singularly garish and totally devoid of festoons.|$|E

Results. Twenty-one percent of the participants developed walking limitation. After adjustment for multiple potential confounders, high BMI, low handgrip strength, impaired squatting, and running difficulties were significant predictors of incident walking limitation. The odds ratio (OR) of walking limitation was 4. 55 (95 % confidence interval [CI], 1. 32 – 15. 74) for squatting difficulties and 2. 39 (95 % CI, 1. 26 – 4. 55) for major running difficulties as compared to participants with no difficulties.
