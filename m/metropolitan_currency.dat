While in both countries Chinese banks filled an important gap in financial intermediation, the currency board system - an especially strict version of the classical gold standard - virtually ensured that these institutions remained small.

Furthermore, we find that perceived unfavorable checking account characteristics and distaste for a checking account are important influences on the probability that an unbanked Black household obtains financial services from a currency exchange. Unbanked Hispanic households also are influenced b...|$|R
