5|$|Ramona, {{published}} in 1884, {{was based in}} part on experiences that Helen Hunt Jackson had had during her visit to Rancho Camulos in 1882. Jackson spent only two hours on the ranch and did not meet Ysabel del Valle, but she had a keen eye for details and used many of her observations in the novel. For example, the altar cloth in the rancho's chapel had a small tear in it which had been <b>mended.</b> In the novel, the character Margarita accidentally tears the altar cloth, and Ramona sews it back together. The book became extremely popular and inspired a great deal of tourism, which was stimulated by the improved access possible due to the opening of Southern Pacific railroad lines in Southern California.|$|E

40|$|We {{describe}} rapid massive endocytosis (<b>MEND)</b> of > 50 % of the plasmalemma in baby hamster kidney (BHK) and HEK 293 {{cells in}} response to large Ca transients. Constitutively expressed Na/Ca exchangers (NCX 1) are used to generate Ca transients, whereas capacitance recording and a membrane tracer dye, FM 4 – 64, are used to monitor endocytosis. With high cytoplasmic adenosine triphosphate (ATP; > 5 mM), Ca influx causes exocytosis followed by <b>MEND.</b> Without ATP, Ca transients cause only exocytosis. <b>MEND</b> can then be initiated by pipette perfusion of ATP, and multiple results indicate that ATP acts via phosphatidylinositol-bis 4, 5 -phosphate (PIP 2) synthesis: PIP 2 substitutes for ATP to induce <b>MEND.</b> ATP-activated <b>MEND</b> is blocked by an inositol 5 -phosphatase and by guanosine 5 ′-[γ-thio]triphosphate (GTPγS). Block by GTPγS is overcome by the phospholipase C inhibitor, U 73122, and PIP 2 induces <b>MEND</b> {{in the presence of}} GTPγS. <b>MEND</b> can occur in the absence of ATP and PIP 2 when cytoplasmic free Ca is clamped to 10 µM or more by Ca-buffered solutions. ATP-independent <b>MEND</b> occurs within seconds during Ca transients when cytoplasmic solutions contain polyamines (e. g., spermidine) or the membrane is enriched in cholesterol. Although PIP 2 and cholesterol can induce <b>MEND</b> minutes after Ca transients have subsided, polyamines must be present during Ca transients. <b>MEND</b> can reverse over minutes in an ATP-dependent fashion. It is blocked by brief β-methylcyclodextrin treatments, and tests for involvement of clathrin, dynamins, calcineurin, and actin cytoskeleton were negative. Therefore, we turned to the roles of lipids. Bacterial sphingomyelinases (SMases) cause similar <b>MEND</b> responses within seconds, suggesting that ceramide may be important. However, Ca-activated <b>MEND</b> is not blocked by reagents that inhibit SMases. <b>MEND</b> is abolished by the alkylating phospholipase A 2 inhibitor, bromoenol lactone, whereas exocytosis remains robust, and Ca influx causes <b>MEND</b> in cardiac myocytes without preceding exocytosis. Thus, exocytosis is not prerequisite for <b>MEND.</b> From these results and two companion studies, we suggest that Ca promotes the formation of membrane domains that spontaneously vesiculate to the cytoplasmic side...|$|R

5|$|In 1530 Vermigli was {{appointed}} vicar {{of the monastery}} at San Giovanni in Monte, Bologna. There he learned Hebrew from a local Jewish doctor so he could read the Old Testament scriptures in their original language. Even among those who sought deeper biblical study, it was uncommon for clergy to learn Hebrew, though not unheard of. In 1533 the chapter-general elected Vermigli abbot of the two Lateran monasteries in Spoleto. At this post he was also responsible for two convents. The discipline in the monastic houses in Vermigli's care had been lax before his arrival, and they had {{become a source of}} scandal in Spoleto. There was also a history of power struggle between the Bishop of Spoleto, Francesco Eroli, and the Spoletan abbacy, {{to the point that the}} bishop had excommunicated Vermigli's predecessor, only to be overturned by Rome. Vermigli brought order to his houses and <b>mended</b> the relationship with the bishop.|$|E
5|$|After {{breaking}} from Gardner's Bricket Wood coven, Valiente formed her own coven with Grove as High Priest, {{still following}} {{the tradition of}} Gardnerian Wicca, albeit without the Wiccan laws, which she believed to be entirely an invention of Gardner's. This coven however failed to last, breaking up amid arguments between its founders. In 1956, Valiente, {{along with her husband}} and her mother, moved into a basement flat in Lewes Crescent, Kemptown, in the southern coastal town of Brighton, although in 1968 they moved into a flat nearer to the town centre. She befriended another Kemptown resident, the journalist Leslie Roberts, who shared her interest in the supernatural. He attracted much attention to himself in the local press through his claims that practitioners of black magic were also operating in the area. Valiente remained a good friend to Roberts until his death from heart disease in 1966. She also got back in touch with Gardner, and <b>mended</b> their friendship, remaining on good terms until his death in 1964, when he left her £200 in his will. During the early 1960s she also developed a correspondence with two Gardnerian initiates in Sheffield, Patricia Crowther and her husband Arnold Crowther, finally meeting them when the latter couple visited Brighton in 1965.|$|E
5|$|The {{construction}} of Kronan began in October 1665, and the hull was launched on 31 July 1668. The English shipwright Francis Sheldon frequently came {{in conflict with}} the admiralty over the project. The navy administrators complained that he was unduly delaying the project and was spending too much time on his own private business ventures. The most aggravating contention was Sheldon's extensive and lucrative export of mast timber to England. Sheldon in turn complained about constant delays on the navy's part and lack of funds. When the ship was launched, the slipway turned out to be too small and the rear section of the keel broke off during the launching. The admiralty demanded an explanation, but Sheldon's reply was that the damage was easily <b>mended</b> and that the problem was that the timber had been left to dry too long. The conflict between the Admiralty and Sheldon dragged on for several years and caused constant delays. The sculptures were finished in 1669, but the rigging, tackling, and arming was drawn out a further three years, to 1672. The first occasion that the ship sailed was during the celebrations of Charles XI's accession as monarch in December 1672.|$|E

The match was {{at the request of}} Hall and Nash, with the stipulation that {{they would be able to}} choose a mystery partner.

The buildup to this encounter began on the November 8 episode of Impact!, when Nash questioned if Hall was Sting's mystery partner in a tag team match against Nash and Angle at TNA's Genesis PPV event on November 11. Hall denied he was Sting's partner and at the sametime <b>mended</b> an alliance with Nash. At Genesis, then-champion Angle and Nash faced Sting and the debuting Booker T in a tag team match for the TNA World Heavyweight Championship. Nash almost won the encounter before being attacked by Angle, thus costing him the pinfall and the championship, and creating a rivalry between the two.|$|E
