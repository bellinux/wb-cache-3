To achieve an exhaustive picture of the labour market we propose investigation in two directions: we provide both a descriptive analysis and an econometric investigation by estimating probit models. We find that, {{at least as far as}} our analyses go, the labour market in Italy is quite active, and we confirm flaws in the conventional wisdom that the Italian economy is characterised by an inflexible and tight labour market.

40|$|The R package multgee {{implements}} {{the local}} odds ratios generalized estimating equations (GEE) approach proposed by Touloumis et al. (2013), a GEE approach for correlated multinomial responses that circumvents {{theoretical and practical}} limitations of the GEE method. A main strength of multgee is that it provides GEE routines for both ordinal (ordLORgee) and nominal (nomLORgee) responses, while relevant softwares in R and SAS are restricted to ordinal responses under a marginal cumulative link model specification. In addition, multgee offers a <b>marginal</b> adjacent <b>categories</b> logit model for ordinal responses and a <b>marginal</b> baseline <b>category</b> logit model for nominal. Further, utility functions are available to ease the local odds ratios structure selection (intrinsic. pars) and to perform a Wald type goodness-of-fit test between two nested GEE models (waldts). We demonstrate the application of multgee through a clinical trial with clustered ordinal multinomial responses. Comment: To appear in Journal of Statistical Softwar...|$|R

40|$|Similarly {{to other}} western countries, {{such as the}} US, the UK and France, but with a delay of about ten years, in Italy the fear of crime and the {{perception}} of insecurity have become important arguments in the political arena, at both national and local level. The discourse on security is, as in other national contexts, influenced by politics and ideology. In the country, political parties such as the Lega Nord had a crucial role in shaping the discourse on zero tolerance. The aim of the paper is to analyse the last 20 years of rhetoric and practices on the security issue in Italy, with specific regard to the zero tolerance. The analysis will consider national and local policies, crime figures, political discourses and statistics on fear of crime and feelings of insecurity. The argument is that the pressing social and political issue of fear of crime brings with it the risks related to the criminalization of specific groups of the population and the rise of a punitive approach targeting those <b>marginal</b> <b>categories</b> that were traditionally considered as social policy and welfare beneficiaries...|$|R

The gross returns from grape orchards during various stages of production are noticed to be twice the cost of production for various categories of orchardists. The results of financial analysis also show a B-C ratio in grape cultivation in the range of 1. 86 and 2. 15 for various categories of orchardists with an average of 2. 07. Among various categories, the medium and large categories of orchardists not only show quicker payback period but they also show higher NPV and B-C ratio as compared to <b>marginal</b> and small <b>categories</b> of orchardists. The large and medium categories of orchardists are, therefore, noticed to manage their grape gardens more efficiently as compared to small and <b>marginal</b> <b>categories</b> of orchardists. However, in general, the cultivation of grapes is noticed to be a lucrative proposition for all the categories of orchardists because of substantially high element of profit involved in the cultivation of this high value crop. Due to high element of profit, the onus of technological efforts have been more favourably inclined and concentrated behind the cultivation of grapes in the state of Maharashtra. Another important aspect of this high value crop is its international competitiveness. Among various fruits and vegetables, Indian grapes are highly competitive in the world market. Efforts should, therefore, be made to boost the export trade of this valued crop by enhancing its production volume. ...|$|R

40|$|Direct {{election}} of the mayor, introduced in Italy in 1993 {{as a result of}} anti-party attitudes and 'modernization', is one aspect of the broad redefinition of local authorities which recently culminated in an ambiguous revision of the constitutional text aimed to promote vertical subsidiarity.

Beyond the radical changes in party labels and systems, a stronger territorial differentiation in the pattern of recruitment, a slight positive discrimination in favour of <b>marginal</b> <b>categories</b> in re-election - possible forerunners of a deeper transformation - and the dominant social profile of current mayors (gender, age, education, work experiences, party training), it is not very different from that of their colleagues of 30 years ago. Their new role marks, nevertheless, significant progress towards greater accountability, activism and ambition among mayors, which is related to their increasing detachment from party politics and to an increased weakness of the other participants in local democracy.

40|$|Food {{insecure}} {{individuals do}} not always have access to adequate food for a healthy lifestyle and {{are at high risk}} of detrimental health outcomes. Researchers hypothesize that food insecurity leads to changes in dietary practices, including greater overall food purchase in times of adequate resources and purchase of low-cost, unhealthful foods when resources are constrained. Most measures of food insecurity do not measure changes in dietary practices and dietary quality. Research findings suggest education that provides alternative strategies to manage resources and improve dietary practices can improve food insecurity. We assessed the relationship between 1) food security and ability to afford foods and 2) the impact of Expanded Food and Nutrition Education Program (EFNEP) in a low-income, multi-cultural population in Massachusetts. We used a pre/post-education survey design, including the USDA six-item Food Security Module (FSM), food-affordability questions and EFNEP behavior checklist. EFNEP participants experienced high rates of food insecurity with over 40 % of participants classified as food insecure (N= 80). Pre-EFNEP, individuals in households with low food security were less likely to report being able to afford healthy foods (51. 5 %) and fruits and vegetables (57. 6 %) throughout the month compared to those in households with high (80. 9 %) and marginal (78. 7 %) food security (P= 0. 007, P= 0. 051). Individuals in households with marginal, low and very low food security were less likely to report being able to afford the same kinds of food throughout the month compared to individuals in high food secure households (56. 4 % vs. 84 %) (P= 0. 022). Individuals in food insecure households reported running out of food {{before the end of the}} month more often than their food secure peers (P= 0. 013). Post-EFNEP, a greater proportion of participants fell into the high and <b>marginal</b> <b>categories</b> of food security (60. 0 % to 71. 7 %, P= 0. 065). Our results indicate that food insecure households have a harder time affording healthy foods throughout the month, leading to poor diet quality that possibly contributes to poor health outcomes. The food affordability questions may capture changes in dietary practices in food insecure populations throughout the month. EFNEP can provide skills and knowledge to at risk populations to improve abilities and combat food insecurity...|$|R

40|$|This article {{examines}} the emergence since 2011 of the ‘Diaosi’ (loser) identity among second-generation migrant workers in China. This subjective identification of a new social category with little hope can be contrasted with the hopeful policy constructions of a strong China eager to promote the civilizing ‘suzhi’ (population quality) of its population nationally and internationally. Yet, as this article shows, in four steps, these phenomena are intertwined. First, it locates the emergence of this ‘Diaosi’ subject in the global and national dialectics of hope in China since the global financial crisis. Second, drawing on neo-Foucauldian and neo-Gramscian scholarship, Diaosi marginality {{is related to the}} interactions among global capitalist production, the socialist market economy, continuous state domination via a household registration system (hukou), and the civilising discourse of ‘suzhi’. Third, it shows how the Diaosi embody their multiplex loser identity and marginality affectively and expressively in their everyday demeanour. Fourth, it examines recent efforts by state/corporate capital and the party-state to re-make and re-hegemonize Diaosi life in the name of consumption, civility, and social stability. The article ends with some neo-Gramscian remarks on the complexities and contradictory consciousness of <b>marginal</b> social <b>categories,</b> such as the Diaosi, and their openness to passive revolution and (re-) hegemonization...|$|R

Convenient features of this class relative to the class of ordered probit models (the discretized version of the multivariate normal) are highlighted. Relevant properties of this distribution like quadratic log-linear expansion, invariance to collapsing of adjacent categories, properties related to positive dependence, marginalization and conditioning are discussed briefly. When continuous explanatory variables are available, regression models may be fitted to relate the univariate logits (as in a proportional odds model) and the log-odds ratios to covariates...|$|R
40|$|The Freebsd, gnu/Linux, Solaris, and Windows {{operating}} systems have kernels that provide comparable facilities. Interestingly, their code bases share almost no common parts, while their development processes vary dramatically. We analyze the source {{code of the}} four systems by collecting metrics {{in the areas of}} file organization, code structure, code style, the use of the C preprocessor, and data organization. The aggregate results indicate that across various areas and many different metrics, four systems developed using wildly different processes score comparably. This allows us to posit that the structure and internal quality attributes of a working, non-trivial software artifact will represent first and foremost the engineering requirements of its construction, with the influence of process being <b>marginal,</b> if any. <b>Categories</b> and Subject Descriptors D. 2. 9 [Software Engineering]: Management—Software process models; D. 2. 8 [Software Engineering]: Metrics—Produc...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to analyse the economic profitability of producing energy-grass fuels on marginal agricultural land in Sweden. Small and irregular-shaped fields, fields with less fertile soils, headlands and border strips were included, all located in four different regions representing different cultivation conditions. The grasses studied were reed canary grass (RCG) and ley, which were to be used as a solid fuel and biogas substrate, respectively. The economic profitability of these grasses was compared with the profitability of fallow land and the cultivation of winter wheat and spring barley. The results showed that all the alternatives studied, except winter wheat in southern Sweden, had a negative economic net gain (no subsidies included). Generally, the economic losses were greatest for small and irregular-shaped fields. Fallow had a higher economic competitiveness than RCG and ley for all <b>marginal</b> field <b>categories</b> and locations. RCG used as a solid fuel in boilers generally had a higher competitiveness than ley for biogas. However, when ley was used fresh without storage, its competitiveness improved considerably. Taking the direct payment subsidies and the economic value of reduced nutrient leakage into account, the economic net gain improved considerably. Nevertheless, fallow land still had a somewhat higher net gain than RCG for all field categories. Further cost reductions and higher revenues, including possible agro-environmental economic compensation, are required if RCG and ley are to be able to compete with fallow land...|$|R
