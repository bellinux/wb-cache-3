50|$|Some cargo {{barriers}} {{are designed to}} be able to be relocated or removed by the user, after the <b>mounting</b> <b>equipment</b> is fitted to a vehicle. They may be fitted with a quick release mechanism enabling this to be done in a few minutes.|$|R
5000|$|Rack slides are {{specifically}} intended for mounting equipment into 19-inch racks or 23-inch racks. These can be friction bearing, ball bearing, or roller bearing. They are sized {{to fit into}} racks with mounting flanges on the ends to mate to the mounting holes in racks. In some cases, one mounting flange is formed into the rack slide with an adapter bracket attached {{to the other end}} to accommodate different depths of the rack. The outer fixed member is attached to the rack and the inner moving member is generally screwed {{to the side of the}} <b>mounted</b> <b>equipment.</b> Rack slides are typically compound or 3-part slides allowing full extension of the <b>mounted</b> <b>equipment</b> and generally include provision for sliding the inner member completely free to allow removal of the equipment from the rack. They can also include stops to prevent accidentally pulling the equipment out of the rack without releasing the stop mechanism.|$|E
5000|$|Horizontal pitch (HP) is a unit {{of length}} defined by the Eurocard printed circuit board {{standard}} {{used to measure the}} horizontal width of rack mounted electronic equipment, similar to the rack unit (U) used to measure vertical heights of rack <b>mounted</b> <b>equipment.</b> One HP is 0.2 inch mm wide. [...] A standard 19-inch rack is 95 HP wide. A standard 23-inch rack is 115 HP wide.|$|E
5000|$|The Voyetra-8 is a 19" [...] {{rack-mountable}} device, 3 rack units high at the face.

50|$|The bus is made {{of carbon}} fibre with a {{composite}} honeycomb structure. It contains fuel tanks, equipment needed to interface with a carrier rocket, and other critical systems. Panels {{are attached to the}} outside of the structure with externally <b>mounted</b> <b>equipment,</b> including the solar panels, payload, and engine. The payload, which is developed separately from the bus, takes up three panels. Once it has been outfitted with transponders or other equipment, it is transported to Cannes-Mandelieu, where it is integrated onto the bus.|$|E
50|$|As a {{component}} of a building wiring system, the installation of light switches will be regulated by some authority concerned with safety and standards. In different countries the standard dimensions of the wall mounting hardware (boxes, plates etc.) may differ. Since the face-plates used must cover this hardware, these standards determine the minimum sizes of all wall <b>mounted</b> <b>equipment.</b> Hence, the shape {{and size of the}} boxes and face-plates, as well as what is integrated, varies from country to country.|$|E
5000|$|Heavy {{equipment}} or equipment which is commonly accessed for servicing, for which attaching or detaching at all four corners simultaneously would pose a problem, {{is often not}} mounted directly onto the rack but instead is mounted via rails (or slides). A pair of rails is mounted directly onto the rack, and the equipment then slides into the rack along the rails, which support it. When in place, the equipment may also then be bolted to the rack. The rails may {{also be able to}} fully support the equipment in a position where it has been slid clear of the rack; this is useful for inspection or maintenance of equipment which will then be slid back into the rack. [...] Some rack slides even include a tilt mechanism allowing easy access to the top or bottom of rack <b>mounted</b> <b>equipment</b> when it is fully extended from the rack.|$|E
5000|$|Rack Rail {{comes in}} two {{different}} commonly used forms. Tapped/threaded rack rail has round holes tapped for 10/32 UNF screws. The other common form of rack rail is square hole rack strip which has square holes for M6 captive nuts that are clipped into the holes as needed to <b>mount</b> <b>equipment.</b>|$|R
50|$|Scientifica is a {{constituent}} company of Judges Scientific Plc and {{was founded in}} 1997.

5000|$|In both cases, rack {{screws and}} washers are {{required}} to <b>mount</b> rack <b>mount</b> <b>equipment</b> to the rack rail. The size and strength of rack rail is determined by its application. Increased thickness of steel results in stronger rack rail and varieties of rack rail can be found such as double angle and single angle rack rail.|$|R
50|$|In certain {{instrumentation}} categories, Fluke was {{a strong}} competitor to U.S instrumentation leader Hewlett-Packard, and {{in the category of}} calibration equipment, Fluke was the industry leader. By the end of the decade, the total market for test and measurement equipment had grown to $6 billion, and Fluke's share was a $150 million annually {{by the end of the}} 1970s. Industry sales continued to increase in the 1980s. Between 1975 and 1985, Fluke's sales rose at an annual average of nearly 20 percent, but with the late 1980s contraction in U.S. defense spending due to a reduction in United States-Russia tension, Fluke's sales to the government and to aerospace companies declined. The sale of Fluke's line of large bench and rack <b>mounted</b> <b>equipment</b> such as digital voltmeters and signal scanners weakened due to the increased use of PC controlled measurement and sensing modules embedded with the computer. However, in the arena of very portable hand held instruments for signal analysis and voltage measurement, Fluke was a leader. Sales in this category remained strong.|$|E
50|$|Hot water {{extraction}} equipment {{may be a}} portable unit that plugs into an electrical outlet, or a truck mount carpet cleaner requiring long hoses from the truck or trailer. Truck <b>mounted</b> <b>equipment</b> may be used where electricity is unavailable (e.g. if electrical service was terminated). Truck mount carpet cleaning may be unsuited to premises distant from a driveway or road, and hoses may need to pass through windows to reach upper floors of a building. Hoses needed for truck mount and professional portable carpet cleaning may present an inconvenience or tripping hazard to users of hallways, and pets or children can escape through doors that must be left ajar for hoses. Heated or air conditioned air will also escape from buildings when doors are left open for hoses, potentially creating a significant waste of energy. Truck mounted carpet cleaning equipment minimizes noise in the room being cleaned, but may cause noise and air pollution offensive to neighbors, and may violate anti-idling bylaws in some jurisdictions. However, truck-mounted cleaning is much faster than portable equipment, and the extra heat will dissolve more spots and stains, and more vacuum suction power will reduce drying times.|$|E

50|$|A {{common use}} for cage nuts is to <b>mount</b> <b>equipment</b> in square-holed 19-inch racks (the most common type), with 0.375 in square-hole size. There are four common sizes: UNF 10-32 and, {{to a lesser}} extent, UNC 12-24 are {{generally}} used in the United States; elsewhere, M5 (5 mm outside diameter and 0.8 mm pitch) for light and medium equipment and M6 for heavier equipment, such as servers.|$|R
50|$|When the Orange County-based {{producer}} Jon St. James {{purchased the}} {{studio in the}} late 1970s, it boasted only a TEAC 8-track tape machine, a mixing console and a few effects. St. James purchased additional electronic devices and rack <b>mount</b> <b>equipment</b> using money he earned doing sound-alike recordings of popular songs for television and radio. St. James' business partner was Chaz Ramirez, also a talented musician and engineer.|$|R
40|$|The {{immunity}} {{of electrical}} and electronic equipment to repetitive electric fast transients/bursts (EFT) is {{regulated by the}} IEC 61000 - 4 - 4 standard, 2 nd edition. The test procedure recommended for rack <b>mounted</b> <b>equipment</b> is actually not very comfortable to implement. To improve this aspect of the standard, the working group charged to developing the new edition has addressed some attention to defining an improved test configuration. In this paper some configurations of rack <b>mounted</b> <b>equipment</b> subjected to EFT test are investigated by numerical simulations based on the use of a full-wave electromagnetic software tool, and of SPICE circuit simulator. The results of this activity have helped to define a new test setup that will appear in the 3 rd edition of the standard that is currently being voted...|$|E
