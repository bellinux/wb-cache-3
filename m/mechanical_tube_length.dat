40|$|Three-dimensional {{information}} {{is important for}} studying cellular organization and function, and many approaches have been used {{over the years to}} reconstruct the three-dimensional structure of microscopic objects (Gaunt and Gaunt, 1978; Inoue 1986). However, most of them are limited to the analysis of static objects. We have developed a simple and inexpensive method of obtaining three-dimensional information on dynamic processes in living cells. This method, which we have named 'double-focal videomicroscopy', yields images at two different focal planes simultaneously, making it possible to obtain information along the axis of observation. This method is especially useful for studying rapid cell movement, such as sperm motility. Although the focus control is usually used when looking at different focal planes, such images may also be brought into focus by changing the <b>mechanical</b> <b>tube</b> <b>length</b> of the microscope. This principle is applied in the case of double-focal microscopy. By using the microscope with two viewing tubes and by slightly changing their relative mechanical tube lengths, images at two different foca...|$|E
40|$|This chapter {{provides}} information on how microscopes work and discusses some of the microscope issues {{to be considered in}} using a video camera on the microscope. There are two types of microscopes in use today for research in cell biology-the older finite tube-length (typically 160 mm <b>mechanical</b> <b>tube</b> <b>length)</b> microscopes and the infinity optics microscopes that are now produced. The objective lens forms a magnified, real image of the specimen at a specific distance from the objective known as the intermediate image plane. All objectives are designed to be used with the specimen at a defined distance from the front lens element of the objective (the working distance) so that the image formed is located at a specific location in the microscope. Infinity optics microscopes differ from the finite tube-length microscopes in that the objectives are designed to project the image of the specimen to infinity and do not, on their own, form a real image of the specimen. Three types of objectives are in common use today-plan achromats, plan apochromats, and plan fluorite lenses. The concept of mounting video cameras on the microscope is also presented in the chapter...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn {{this study}} the {{indirect}} extrusion of seamless aluminum tubes with variable wall thickness was investigated. Therefore, an axially moveable stepped mandrel was applied. Investigations revealed that wall thickness transitions {{can either be}} graded over the <b>tube</b> <b>length</b> or very sharp. The microstructures in thin-walled and thick-walled tube sections were investigated. The local variation of the extrusion ratio and with that the tube wall thickness, product velocity and product temperature during the process lead to significantly different local microstructures at TB= 400 °C. At TB= 500 °C the microstructure was homogeneously recrystallized with similar grain size in all different tube sections.

Narrow leaved ash (F. angustifolia VAHL) pollen served as a control in 2002. The year, time and temperature, and the interaction between time and temperature were significant for both germination percentage and pollen <b>tube</b> <b>length.</b> Interactions year × temperature and year × time were significant for pollen <b>tube</b> <b>length</b> only. The highest germination percentage (17. 86 % in 2001 and 19. 40 % in 2002) of green ash pollen was at 15 ◦C after 6 hours. The pollen <b>tube</b> <b>length</b> was greatest at 20 ◦C (393. 46 µm) in 2001 and 25 ◦C (899. 50 µm) in 2002 after 6 hours.

40|$|A large {{diversity}} of floral morphological types exists within the bird pollination syndrome in the Cape Floral Region of South Africa. Here {{we focus on}} species with tubular flowers and ask: "Do differences in <b>tube</b> <b>length</b> among plant species correspond to differences in bill length among the birds that serve as pollinators?" To answer this question, we observed 1669 bird-plant interactions at thirteen bird-pollinated plant species across a spectrum of <b>tube</b> <b>lengths.</b> Only three nectar feeding bird species pollinated the focal plant species. The relatively short-billed species were the Southern Double-collared Sunbird (Cinnyris chalybea) and Orange-breasted Sunbird (Anthobaphes violacea); the only long-billed species was the Malachite Sunbird (Nectarinia famosa). We found that the groups of plant species pollinated by the long- and short-billed birds differed significantly in floral <b>tube</b> <b>length.</b> Short-billed sunbirds nevertheless often robbed long-tubed flowers by piercing the corolla, {{and there was a}} significant difference in floral <b>tube</b> <b>length</b> among those species that were robbed, and those that were pollinated by short-billed sunbirds. The presence of territorial Malachite Sunbirds depressed robbing rates by short-billed sunbirds at long-tubed flowers. In turn, the absence of Malachite Sunbirds from short-tubed plant species might be explained by the observed positive correlation between <b>tube</b> <b>length</b> and nectar volume. Together, these data suggest that there is a subset of the bird-pollinated plants at the Cape that are pollinated solely by the long-billed Malachite Sunbird, a pollination service irreplaceable by the more abundant, short-billed sunbird species. To extrapolate this finding to a greater subset of species in the Cape Floral Region, we measured flowers on herbarium specimens of all tubular putatively bird-pollinated plants. We find that floral <b>tube</b> <b>length</b> has a bimodal distribution with 37 Cape species potentially dependent on pollination by Malachite Sunbirds. © 2009 SAAB. Articl...|$|R

Therefore, identification of cotton with high-temperature tolerance {{would be beneficial}} in both current and future climates. Response to temperature (10 - 45 °C at 5 °C intervals) of pollen germination and tube growth was quantified. And their relationship to cell membrane thermostability was studied in 12 cultivars. A principal component analysis was carried out to classify genotypes for temperature tolerance. What was learned? Pollen germination and pollen <b>tube</b> <b>length</b> of the cultivars ranged from 20 to 60 % and 411 to 903 µm, respectively. A modified bilinear model best described the response to temperature of pollen germination and pollen <b>tube</b> <b>length.</b> Cultivar variation existed for cardinal temperatures (Tmin, Topt and Tmax) of pollen germination percentage and pollen <b>tube</b> <b>length.</b> Mean cardinal temperature calculated from the bilinear model for the 12 cultivars were 15. 0, 31. 8 and 43. 3 °C for pollen germination and 11. 9, 28. 6 and 42. 9 °C for pollen <b>tube</b> <b>lengths.</b> No significant correlations were found between pollen parameters and cell membrane thermostability.

We found a narrow transition zone between plants differing by three-fold in perianth <b>tube</b> <b>length.</b> We determined whether strong gene-flow barriers result from assortative mating arising from different pollinators, a high prevalence of selfing, or post-pollination incompatibilities between plants with different <b>tube</b> <b>lengths.</b> We found that there was little evidence to support assortative mating through different pollinators. Both short- and long-tubed plants were mainly visited by bees with short proboscides.

We conclude that the contact zone is unstable because these ecotypes have not accrued enough allopatric differences to translate into strong gene-flow barriers, or, alternatively, bimodality is not a consequence of secondary contact but the result of a novel mutation for short tubes spreading through a long-tubed population. © 2011 The Linnean Society of London...|$|R

The nonlinear magnetic-spring configuration is employed for gen-erating sufficient power from hand shaking of irregular and low-frequency vibrations. Based on the modeling and simulation, longer <b>tube</b> <b>length</b> of the EMEH device results in lower resonant frequency and stronger nonlinearity {{of the system}} and thus is more efficient for low-frequency harvesting. From the hand shaking test, it is found that a longer <b>tube</b> <b>length</b> and a shorter winding coil width could induce a higher power generation. The optimized device of <b>tube</b> <b>length</b> of 66 mm and winding coil width of 10 mm has achieved maximum power outputs of 568. 66 µW at the hand shaking acceleration of 1 g and frequency of 6. 7 Hz, which corresponds to the power density of 90. 67 µW/cm 3.
