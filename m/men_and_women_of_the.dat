25|$|The high {{dropout rate}} {{is among the}} biggest {{obstacles}} to higher education for both Bedouin <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>women.</b> <b>Of</b> <b>the</b> students that do remain in school, only about 30% pass their matriculation exams. These exams are taken {{at the end of}} high school (typically around age 17) and are required for enrollment at Israeli universities. Moreover, Bedouin students studying at Israeli universities face a significant language barrier (instruction is generally in Hebrew or English, not Arabic). Finally, most Negev Bedouin men are employed as wage laborers, not as white-collar or blue-collar workers. In the face of this fact, it often does not seem a reasonable investment to attain higher education.|$|E

25|$|In 1915, Guitry {{made his}} first cinema film, Ceux de chez nous ("Those of our home"), a short {{patriotic}} piece that celebrated great French <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>women</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> day, including Sarah Bernhardt, Anatole France, Claude Monet, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Auguste Rodin, Edmond Rostand and Camille Saint-Saëns. He was not greatly attracted by the medium of silent film, regarding dialogue as the essence of drama; he {{did not make a}} full-length film until 1935. In 1915 he met the young singer Yvonne Printemps, with whom he began an affair that led Charlotte to leave him and obtain a divorce. Guitry started to write leading roles for Printemps some musical and others straight comedies.|$|E
25|$|In {{some parts}} of China, dances are held for {{young men and women}} to find partners. For example, young women are {{encouraged}} to throw their handkerchiefs to the crowd, and the young man who catches and returns the handkerchief has a chance at romance. In Daguang, in northeast Guizhou Province, young <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>women</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Dong people would make an appointment at a certain place. The young women would arrive early to overhear remarks made about them by the young men. The young men would praise their lovers in front of their fellows, in which finally the listening women would walk out of the thicket. Pairs of lovers would go off to a quiet place to open their hearts to each other.|$|E
25|$|While the {{etymology}} of {{the term}} opera glove is unknown, gloves of above-the-elbow length have been worn {{since at least the}} late 18th century, and gloves reaching to or just below the elbow have been worn by women in Western countries since the 17th century. In fact, there is an engraving of England's Queen Mary dating from the 1690s in which she is shown wearing elbow-length gloves. Over-the-elbow gloves were first widely popular during the Regency/Napoleonic period (circa 18001825), and waned in popularity during the early and mid-Victorian periods (circa 18301870), but enjoyed their greatest vogue {{in the last two decades}} of the 19th century and the years of the 20th century prior to the start of World War I. During that period, they were standard for both daytime and evening wear with most types of outfitseven some swimming outfits of the period were accessorized with opera gloves. Etiquette of that period considered gloves to be mandatory accessories for both <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>women</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> upper classes, so it was fairly uncommon during that era to see a well-dressed woman at a public occasion who was not wearing gloves of some sort. According to several fashion historians, over-the-elbow gloves were popularized, or more accurately re-popularized, during the late 19th century by the renowned actresses Sarah Bernhardt in France (who liked wearing long gloves to disguise what she considered her overly thin arms) and Lillian Russell in the United States.|$|E
