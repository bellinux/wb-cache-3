40|$|Aim: The {{anatomical}} {{study and}} clinical application for the vascularized corticoperiosteal flap from the <b>medial</b> femoral <b>condyle</b> {{have been performed}} and described previously. Although prior studies have described the composite osteomyocutaneous flap from the <b>medial</b> femoral <b>condyle,</b> {{a detailed analysis of}} the vascularity of this region has not yet been fully evaluated. Methods: This anatomical study described the variability of the arteries from the <b>medial</b> femoral <b>condyle</b> in 40 cadaveric specimens. Results: The descending genicular artery (DGA) was found in 33 of 40 cases (82. 5 %). The  superomedial genicular artery (SGA) was present in 10 cases (25 %). All 33 cases (100 %) of the DGA had articular branches to the periosteum of the <b>medial</b> femoral <b>condyle.</b> Muscular branches and saphenous branches of the DGA were present in 25 cases (62. 5 %) and 26 cases (70. 3 %), respectively. Conclusion: The current study demonstrates that the size and length of the vessels to the <b>medial</b> femoral <b>condyle</b> are sufficient for a vascularized bone flap. A careful preoperative vascular assessment is essential prior to use of the vascularized composite osteomyocutaneous flap from the <b>medial</b> femoral <b>condyle,</b> because of the considerable anatomical variations in different branches of the DGA...|$|R
40|$|Although the hominid knee {{has been}} heavily scrutinized, shape {{variation}} of the <b>medial</b> tibial <b>condyle</b> {{has yet to be}} described. Humans, chimpanzees, and gorillas differ {{in the shape of the}}ir <b>medial</b> femoral <b>condyles</b> and in their capacity for external and internal rotation of the tibia relative to the femur. I hypothesize that these differences should be reflected in the shape of the <b>medial</b> tibial <b>condyle</b> of these hominids. Here I use geometric morphometric techniques to uncover shape differences between the <b>medial</b> tibial <b>condyles</b> of humans, chimpanzees, and gorillas. Humans are distinguished from the other two species by having a much more oval-shaped <b>medial</b> tibial <b>condyle,</b> while those of chimpanzees and gorillas are more triangular in outline. Gorillas (especially males) are distinguished by having more concavely-curved condyles (mediolateral direction), which is interpreted as an effect of heavy loading through the medial compartment of the knee in conjunction with differences in the degree of arboreality...|$|R

40|$|We {{report the}} case of a patient exhibiting the {{snapping}} phenomenon during flexion/extension motion caused by the gracilis tendon flipping over the posteromedial corner of the <b>medial</b> femoral <b>condyle.</b> A 30 -year-old woman presented with a 2 -year history of pain accompanied by snapping over the medial aspect of the left knee. Snapping was observed at the posteromedial corner of the <b>medial</b> femoral <b>condyle</b> at around 30 ° of flexion during active and passive flexion/extension. Imaging examination, including radiography, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and computed tomography, revealed no abnormalities. Considering the persistent discomfort and disability associated with the snapping, surgery was indicated. During surgery, the gracilis tendon was observed to move over the posterior edge of the <b>medial</b> femoral <b>condyle</b> during flexion/extension of the knee. The gracilis tendon was transected and the proximal cut end was sutured to the neighboring semitendinosus tendon in a proximally retracted position. After the surgery, the snapping symptom was resolved. We hypothesized that the anteriorly deviated location of the gracilis tendon in relation to the <b>medial</b> femoral <b>condyle</b> was a causative factor for the snapping phenomenon in this patient. In order to investigate whether the gracilis tendon of this patient passes along the aberrant route, the location of the gracilis tendon in our patient population with knee injuries (26 patients) was examined on axial MRI. In this study population, the gracilis tendon was located posterior to the <b>medial</b> femoral <b>condyle</b> in 21 of the 26 knees (81 %), and at the posteromedial corner of the <b>medial</b> femoral <b>condyle</b> in 5 of the 26 knees (19 %). However, passage of the gracilis tendon anterior to the posterior edge of the <b>medial</b> femoral <b>condyle</b> was not observed in any of the cases in this population. Based on this investigation, the aberrant route of the gracilis tendon was thought to be a primary factor for snapping observed in this patient...|$|R

40|$|Background: Surgically, it is {{difficult}} to achieve union of a scaphoid nonunion that is associatedwith osteonecrosis of the proximal pole, and those with carpal collapse are especially difficult to treat. A variety of vascularized bone grafts can be used. The {{purpose of this study was}} to compare the effectiveness of two types of vascularized bone graft—a distal radial pedicle graft and a free vascularized <b>medial</b> femoral <b>condyle</b> graft—in the treatment of scaphoid waist nonunions associated with proximal pole osteonecrosis and carpal collapse. Methods: A retrospective reviewwas conducted at two institutions to identify all patients with a scaphoid waist nonunion associated with an avascular proximal pole and carpal collapse. Between January 1994 and June 2006, twenty-two such nonunionswere identified in twenty-twopatients. Tenwere treatedwith a distal radial pedicle vascularized graft and twelve, with a free vascularized <b>medial</b> femoral <b>condyle</b> graft. Patient demographics were similar between the groups, and the duration of follow-upaveraged twelvemonths. Unionwasdeterminedwithuseof plain radiographsand computed tomography or trispiral tomograms. In addition, carpal angles, time to union, union rates, and complications were recorded. Results: Four of the ten nonunions treated with the distal radial pedicle graft healed, at a median of nineteen weeks, and all twelve nonunions treated with the free <b>medial</b> femoral <b>condyle</b> graft healed, at a median of thirteen weeks. The rate of union was significantly higher (p = 0. 005) and the median time to healing was significantly shorter (p < 0. 001) for the nonunions treated with the <b>medial</b> femoral <b>condyle</b> graft...|$|R

50|$|The {{bones of}} the knee are the femur, patella, tibia, and fibula. The fibula is on the lateral side of the knee and the patella has {{little effect on the}} medial side of the knee.

On the <b>medial</b> femoral <b>condyle</b> there are three bony landmarks that are important: the medial epicondyle, adductor tubercle, and gastrocnemius tubercle.

40|$|The {{shape of}} joint {{articular}} surfaces can provide important {{information about the}} locomotor habits of animals. Understanding sources of shape variation in these surfaces is critical to correctly inferring the link between form and function. This study tests the hypothesis that increases in body size within a species result in flatter joint contours of the joint articular surface. Joint flattening is expected to regulate the magnitude and direction of transarticular stresses passing through the joint. Three-dimensional laser scans of polyvinylsiloxane molds of the <b>medial</b> tibial <b>condyle</b> of gorillas (n = 40), common chimpanzees (n = 40), and modern humans (n = 40) were evaluated for differences in articular surface topography, with all measures of joint curvature examined in relation to femoral head superoinferior diameter (as a surrogate for body size). Analyses did not detect an allometric shape change in the curvature of the <b>medial</b> tibial <b>condyle</b> with increasing body size within {{any of the three}} taxa examined here. <b>Medial</b> tibial <b>condyle</b> curvature appears to be largely independent of body size as estimated by femoral head diameter.

Needle insertion points 1. 5 centimeters and 0. 5 centimeters proximal {{to the level of}} <b>medial</b> femoral <b>condyle</b> yielded the best chance(66. 25 %- 76. 19 %) of finding motor branches to medial gastrocnemius muscles and lateral gastrocnemius respectively.

However,even if these points are used as guidelline when performing motor branch block prodedure, the risk of sensory nerve fiber injury are still as high as 20. 98 % upto 50. 0 %. To avoid such complication,the authors have proposed a set of landmarks that would make it possible to access all of the motor branches of any single calf muscle with only three or less needle insertions, and still maintaining about 1 % risk of sensory fiber injury...|$|R
