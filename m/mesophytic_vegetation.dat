40|$|Background: The Rhynie chert, Aberdeenshire, encapsulates the ecophysiological and {{anatomical}} {{information on}} all components, including plants, animals and micro-organisms, {{of an early}} terrestrial ecosystem as it existed some 400 million years ago (Early Devonian), as preserved by siliceous waters emanating from a hot spring system. Aims: This paper concentrates on the higher plants (tracheophytes) and brings together information on the habitats of the plants and the environmental pressures that they endured to answer issues relating to their endemism and their ecophysiology. Methods & Results: The synthesis includes detailed information on the palaeo-environments recorded in the chert, plus anatomical and autecological data from the plants themselves, and makes comparisons with the abiotic and biotic data obtained from an extant analogue, the alkali–chloride geothermal systems at Yellowstone National Park. Particular {{attention is paid to}} the physiological basis and evolution of osmotic and chemical tolerance of halophytes, the dominant colonisers of Yellowstone's wetlands and, to a lesser extent, metallophytes. Conclusions: The Rhynie plants colonised wetlands at the low temperature fringes of a hot spring system and were versatile, but physiologically highly specialised, capable of withstanding osmotic and chemical stresses in a dynamic environment, but were probably out-competed by <b>mesophytic</b> <b>vegetation</b> elsewhere...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the shift in}} vegetation of broadleaf forests in {{eastern part of the}} Elbe River Basin between 1958 - 1968 and 2011 - 2013. It emphasizes the understorey vegetation. From lowland woodlands in other temperate regions in Europe and North America changes towards eutrophic and <b>mesophytic</b> <b>vegetation</b> are documented, specifically driven by changes in forest management and by atmospheric depositions; in some localities the game impact can be also important. The data were obtained by sampling 190 typological semi-permanent plots, which were precisely located - in 43 % the original soil pit was found. The vegetation on study sites shifted towards nutrient-demanding, shade- adapted species, it was partly ruderalized. These changes can be seen on the level of species and communities as well as on phytosociological level. Increase of soil pH and moisture was discovered using Ellenberg indicator values. The number of seedlings and cover of shrubs also increased significantly. Homogenization of sites was significant as well although total number of species and alpha- diversity remained unchanged. These changes are probably caused by changes in forest management and by atmospheric depositions of nitrogen. On subset of plots in game-preserves the vegetation also demonstrated eutrophication but no increase in [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Several {{reports of}} {{widespread}} establishment of <b>mesophytic</b> <b>vegetation</b> within oak-hickory upland forests {{have been documented}} throughout the Central Hardwoods Region. Previous studies suggest deviations from historic disturbance regimes may be a primary driver of vegetation change, necessitating the use of Fire Regime Condition Class (FRCC) guidelines to measure changes in forest structure. Current parameters of forest structure and fuel loading were assessed within mature oak-hickory uplands throughout the ecological subsections of the Shawnee National Forest, including the Greater Shawnee Hills, Lesser Shawnee Hills, Cretaceous Hills, and the Illinois Ozarks. Present species importance values and forest structure were compared with reference conditions developed from General Land Office records(Fralish et al. 2002). Current uplands contained an average 214. 72 ± 16. 52 SE trees/ac and 103. 37 ± 2. 16 SE ft 2 BA/ac, while reference stands harbored less than 90 trees/ac {{with a range of}} 16 and 120 ft 2 BA/ac. Due to the high levels of fragmentation and a lack of large contiguous upland stands within the Shawnee National Forest, stand level criteria for FRCC values were developed as opposed to landscape level FRCC values which are commonly used. FRCC values determined during initial surveys were compared with plot level ratios of forest structure parameters regarding oaks:mesophytes and xerophytes:mesophytes, yielding clear relationships between species composition and FRCC values. Fuel loading (tons/ac) was assessed as a determinant of FRCC values, however a significant relationship between FRCC values and fuel loading was not discovered. Since widespread deviations from the historic fire regime have taken place since the early 20 th century, Fire Regime Condition Class values were found to fall into the FRCC 2 and 3 categories without any stands representing FRCC 1. This determination requires future management practices to follow Fire Regime Condition Class guidelines. The study proved that mesophytic species have become established within all canopy strata, with a strong probability of gaining future dominance without active forest management. Although it is clear that forest structure has deviated from reference conditions, a strong oak-hickory overstory component found throughout the study area provides a potential resource to sustain future oak-hickory upland ecosystems...|$|E
40|$|Both paleomagnetism and {{palynology}} may furnish useful diagnostic facts {{for recognizing}} long-distance {{movements of the}} earth’s crust. With respect to the relative positions of North America and Eurasia, paleomagnetic and palynological data contribute {{evidence in support of}} the theory of continental drift. However, the conclusions based on paleomagnetic measurements sometimes disagree with palynological observations. Paleomagnetic data obtained in northeastern Italy, southern France and northern Spain differ considerably from those from Mesc-Europe. In recent geotectonical considerations this has been attributed to the so-called Tethys twist having effected a post-Carboniferous westward displacement of the structural units of Italy, southern France and Spain. Palynology, however, reveals a highly uniform geological history of both Meso-Europe and a part of Alpine Europe during Permian and Triassic times. Biostratigraphical correlations between the two realms are possible by studying the palynological assemblages obtained from Permian and Triassic evaporites or associated sediments. Contemporaneous, short periods of evaporite deposition in both Meso-Europe and the Mediterranean region are suggested by the striking uniformities in Lower <b>Mesophytic</b> <b>vegetations</b> as reflected by sporae dispersae. There is every indication that there was a comparable evolution in the physiographical and climatological conditions which opposes the hypothesis of a mobile Tethys belt during Permian and Triassic times...|$|R
25|$|The state's {{ecosystems}} {{influenced the}} movement of the semi-nomadic Archaic Indian. The land gradually changed from a tundra to an evergreen forest, and eventually to forests of oak, hemlock, rhododendron, nut, berries, and Appalachian mixed <b>mesophytic</b> forests. The <b>vegetation</b> attracted modern game animals by 7800 BCE. Modern decididuous forests grew south and east of the Allegheny River. Carbonized nut hulls from the St. Albans Site in Kanawha County date to 7000 BCE.|$|R
40|$|Cerrado biome is {{the second}} largest Brazilian biome, where {{different}} phyto-physiognomical features are observed, which {{may be influenced by}} soil factors. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate soil physical and fertility properties (particle size analysis, bulk density - BD and total pore volume - TPV), carbon and nitrogen stocks and chemical fractions of soil organic matter (SOM) in areas of mesophytic forest, Cerrado and Cerrado sensu stricto in the ecological station of Pirapitinga, Minas Gerais state. The soil was classified as Oxisol and soil samples were collected from the layers 0 - 0. 05, 0. 05 - 0. 1, 0. 1 - 0. 2, and 0. 2 - 0. 4 m. The experimental design was completely randomized. Areas of mesophytic forest and cerrado grow in soil with higher clay compared to the Cerrado sensu stricto, indicating that possibly more clayey soils have higher water holding capacity and nutrient supply to attend the demand more appropriately with larger <b>vegetations.</b> The <b>mesophytic</b> forest area by presenting high waste disposal of plant and be in the clayey soil is in some layers providing higher levels of soil organic C and humic substances, triggering lower values of bulk density, greater total porosity and availability of P in relation to other vegetation types studied. However, the closed areas and Cerrado sensu stricto have higher amounts of Mg, K, and lower pH, H + Al and Al compared to mesophitic forest area, which may suggest that these phytophysiognomies settle preferentially in the most fertile soils of Cerrado biome. The relationship between the humic acid and fulvic acid fraction indicates that the forest <b>vegetation</b> <b>Mesophytic</b> presents for <b>vegetation</b> of Cerrado and Cerrado sensu stricto soil organic matter of great quality, which allows the establishment of physical and chemical attributes favorable {{to the development of the}} plant. The largest stocks of carbon are verified in larger <b>vegetation,</b> cerrado and <b>mesophytic</b> forest. However, the higher grade and stock soil nitrogen occur in Cerrado sensu stricto...|$|R
40|$|A new {{interpretation}} of the Late Eocene landscape in northern Bohemia is offered. Late Eocene age has been proven by palaeontological records and radiometric dating of volcanogenic strata representing the earliest surface products of volcanic activity in the České středohoří Mountains (the lowermost part of the Středohoří Complex, Ústí Formation p. p.). Most of them, the sites of Kučlín, Kostomlaty - Mrtvý vrch and Roudný, and the lower parts of the sections at Lbín (core Lb 1), Hlinná (core Úc 9), and Kundratice (core KU 1) line the southern periphery from Bílina to Litoměřice. These deposits, which comprise diatomites, marlstones to limestones, tuffitic claystones or coarser volcaniclastics, represent a volcanic facies coeval with the Staré Sedlo Formation, which is composed of quartzites, sandstones and sands of fluvial settings. Although the floras of either lithostratigraphic unit differ in some respect, {{this is due to}} the synecology of vegetation and environmental differences (aquatic to upland communities on fertile volcanogenic soils versus riparian forests along rivers on oligotrophic sandy soils). A volcanogenic lake system apparently existed in the southern part of the České středohoří Mountains at that time, which was drained across northern Bohemia and Saxony towards the North Sea, as corroborated by fish fauna (Morone). The Kučlín diatomite and the other mentioned sites at the base of the Ústí Fm. reveal mainly a <b>mesophytic</b> forest <b>vegetation</b> suggesting a warm, (paratropical) subtropical seasonal climate without frosts and with slightly deficient (? summer) precipitation. Plant assemblages of the Staré Sedlo Fm. reflect azonal, predominantly woody vegetation along riverbanks (riverine gallery forests). This type of vegetation, supplied by groundwater, was also (paratropical) subtropical and seasonal but perhumid in aspect. Such differences between plant assemblages connected with the basinal/fluvial versus volcanogenic environment can be found elsewhere during the Paleogene (the Middle Eocene sites of Messel, Eckfeld and Geiseltal or the Early Oligocene sites of the České středohoří Mountains and the Haselbach Floral Assemblage in Saxony). At Kučlín and the other listed localities of the earliest effusive activity, no distinct hiatus (sedimentation gap) towards the Staré Sedlo Formation existed. The Late Eocene landscape of northern Bohemia, in contrast to the hitherto accepted interpretation, was a peneplain with lowland rivers, lakes, maars and moderate volcanic uplands...|$|R
