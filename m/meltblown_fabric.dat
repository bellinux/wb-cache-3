40|$|Ion {{exchange}} (IEX) chromatography {{is commonly}} used in separation and purification systems. However, micropore blockage within its resin structure can easily lead {{to a reduction in}} the effectiveness of purification. To tackle this problem, we adopted the concept of membrane separation by combining electrospinning techniques with rapid alkaline hydrolysis to prepare a weak acid IEX nanofibrous membrane (AEA-COOH), consisting of polyethyleneterephthalate (PET) <b>meltblown</b> <b>fabric</b> as a supporting layer, with upper and lower IEX layers consisting of polyacrylonitrile (PAN) nanofibrous membranes. To determine the characteristics of the AEA-COOH membrane, we used the commercial product Sartobind&# 169; C IEX membrane as the standard of comparison. Results showed that the base weight and thickness of AEACOOH were 33 and 64 %, relative to Sartobind&# 169; C membrane. The thermo-degradable temperature of AEA-COOH membrane (320 °C) was far higher than that of Sartobind&# 169; C (115 °C), indicating high thermal stability. Finally, comparisons between the lysozyme adsorption rates and capacity of various IEX membranes confirmed that AEA-COOH was lighter, thinner, faster, possessing higher protein adsorption efficiency than Sartobind&# 169; C membrane...|$|E
40|$|Fuel-water {{filters are}} a {{promising}} {{solution for the}} removal of water from diesel fuel and frequently rely on a depth coalescing nonwoven medium and a barrier mesh. Water is a fuel contaminant that can cause severe damage to engine injectors by promoting corrosion and microbial growth. Coalescing water out of diesel fuel has become challenging because of the increasing amount of bio-diesel and performance enhancing additives that are present to meet emission control regulations. High water content and the reduction in interfacial tension (IFT) between the water and diesel are associated with formation of more stable emulsions and the generation of smaller water droplets that are harder to remove. This research systematically investigates the characteristics of bio-diesel and surfactant (monoolein) blends with standard diesel fuel, and explores the factors affecting the efficient removal of water from fuel by means of depth coalescing media composed of poly(butylene terephthalate) (PBT) <b>meltblown</b> <b>fabrics.</b> It was established that bio-diesel and monoolein do not influence the IFT of water in fuel in a comparable manner and the resulting water droplet size distributions (DSD) are substantially different, which has implications in terms of the interpretation of results from commonly used ISO and SAE standard test methods. Fuels blended with bio-diesel exhibited higher viscosity and water content than fuel freshly blended with monoolein. Online measurement of water droplet sizes revealed substantially smaller water droplets in bio-diesel blends compared to monoolien blends at the same IFT measured using offline tensiometry. The surface wetting characteristics of PBT meltblown media were modified by alkaline hydrolysis independently of fabric geometric configuration and treated fabrics exhibited greater coalescence efficiencies (up to a 150...|$|R
