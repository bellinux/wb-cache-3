5|$|After {{more than}} 60 years of {{continuous}} operation, the Cacchio family {{decided to sell}} the Theatre. Rather than sell to real estate developers, the Cacchios preferred to transfer the property to the Rosendale Theatre Collective, a nonprofit formed in late 2009 {{for the sole purpose}} of buying and preserving the Theatre. The group spent months raising funds for a down payment on the building, with the bulk of its <b>money</b> <b>coming</b> from small individual donations. About 60 fundraisers were held, and a large grant was provided by PepsiCo after the Theatre Collective ran a successful social networking campaign for the April 2010 Pepsi Refresh Project. The Cacchios transferred ownership of the property to the Theatre Collective on August19, 2010. Since its purchase, the Theatre has had several equipment upgrades, including a move to digital cinema.|$|E
5|$|The {{importance}} of collegiate life {{is such that}} for many students their college JCR (Junior Common Room, for undergraduates) or MCR (Middle Common Room, for graduates) is seen as more important than OUSU. JCRs and MCRs each have a committee, with a president and other elected students representing their peers to college authorities. Additionally, they organise events and often have significant budgets to spend as they wish (<b>money</b> <b>coming</b> from their colleges and sometimes other sources such as student-run bars). (It {{is worth noting that}} JCR and MCR are terms that are used to refer to rooms for use by members, as well as the student bodies.) Not all colleges use this JCR/MCR structure, for example Wadham College's entire student population is represented by a combined Students' Union and purely graduate colleges have different arrangements.|$|E
5|$|The justices were {{assisted}} by {{a staff of}} over 50 officials, most of whom sat in Westminster Hall but also kept offices at the various Inns of Court. The Chief Clerk was the Custos Brevium, appointed by the crown, but in practice clerking matters were handled by his deputy, as the office was a royal favour rather than a serious judicial appointment. The crown also appointed the court chirographer, the officer responsible for noting final concords and filing records of fines. Another high-ranking clerk was the Clerk of the Outlawries, an under-clerk of the Attorney General for England and Wales, who was tasked with recording recognizances to protect {{the interests of the}} King in common law matters. In 1541 his position was replaced with the office of Clerk of the King's Process. Other offices created during the reign of Henry VIII include the Clerk of the Recognizances in 1432, who recorded debts secured by recognizances and the office of Receiver of Debts, who was tasked with receiving and recording <b>money</b> <b>coming</b> into the court via debts and fines, and was first appointed in 1536.|$|E

25|$|By October 2007 the Hsu matter had quieted down. Clinton's {{third quarter}} {{campaign}} expenditures report showed the $800,000 in contributions, mostly Hsu-related, being returned {{to more than}} 200 donors, {{some of whom were}} surprised to see the <b>money</b> <b>coming</b> back and who said they knew not of Hsu.|$|E
25|$|In 2006 an {{agreement}} {{was made with}} the embassy of Slovenia {{as one of the}} successor states. It was expected that repairs would cost 12.5 million Czech crowns, with the <b>money</b> <b>coming</b> from the city of Olomouc, European Structural Funds and the Czech Ministry of Culture. However, the project was suspended {{by the end of the}} year because the problems with property rights made the request for the European funding impossible.|$|E

It's rubbish and George should stick to playing cricket and leave (television) rights to the people who know what they're talking about. I reckon he's got his hands full as it is. He needs to {{concentrate}} on staying in the side. And he needs to understand where his <b>money's</b> <b>coming</b> from. Without the TV rights deal, George is probably working in a coalmine or flipping burgers at McDonald's.|$|R
25|$|Alston & Bird's {{healthcare}} {{clients include}} CVS Caremark, the National Association for Home Care and Hospice, Abbott Laboratories, and HealthSouth. The firm was paid $5.8 million between January and September 2008 to represent companies and associations before Congress {{and the executive}} branch, with 60% of that <b>money</b> <b>coming</b> from the healthcare industry. Daschle was recruited by the former Republican Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole. Daschle's salary from Alston & Bird for the year 2008 was reportedly $2 million.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the general}} public were unaware, {{chairman}} Peter Ridsdale had taken out large loans against the prospect of gate receipts from Champions League games. As Leeds had failed {{to qualify for the}} competition, there was simply not enough <b>money</b> <b>coming</b> in to repay the debt. The first indication that the club was in financial trouble was the sale of Rio Ferdinand to Manchester United for £30million, a world record for a defender. O'Leary and Ridsdale publicly fell out over the sale.|$|E
25|$|The high {{salaries}} and, especially, {{the potential}} wealth through stock options, {{has supported the}} term corporate elite or corporate class. Top executives, including Chief Executive Officers, are among the financially best compensated occupations in the United States. The median annual earnings for a CEO in the United States were $140,350 (exceeding the income of more than 90% of United States households). The Wall Street Journal reports the median compensation for CEOs of 350 major corporations was $6,000,000 in 2005 {{with most of the}} <b>money</b> <b>coming</b> from stock options.|$|E

25|$|This {{expansion}} {{helped the}} economy of the countries owning them. Trade flourished, because of the minor stability of the empires. By the late 16th century, American silver accounted for one-fifth of Spain's total budget. The European countries fought wars that were largely paid for by the <b>money</b> <b>coming</b> in from the colonies. Nevertheless, the profits of the slave trade and of plantations of the West Indies, then the most profitable of all the British colonies, amounted to less than 5% of the British Empire's economy (but was generally more profitable) {{at the time of the}} Industrial Revolution in the late 18th century.|$|E
25|$|Jiji {{divided the}} vast {{property}} she had and Wadkar's father {{was given the}} house in Sawantwadi. The mother, father, brother and young Wadkar shifted there and she joined a Marathi medium school where she studied till class IV. She also studied vocal music under Bhagwatbuwa but {{was not interested in}} singing. The family returned to Bombay and Hansa attended an English medium school for two years at Aryan Education Society School. However, she had to leave school when the family faced financial problems. The father had turned into an alcoholic and there was no <b>money</b> <b>coming</b> in the house. The mother insisted that Mohan being a boy should continue his studies, hence it was left on Wadkar to find work.|$|E
25|$|Inevitable {{tensions}} arose, however, as {{the players}} were receiving only a 30 shillings ($3) per week, yet were training to a professional standard. Adding to the players' dissatisfaction was the increased <b>money</b> <b>coming</b> into the game – Carlton's revenue had doubled {{since the time of}} Worrall's appointment. Worrall's sometimes brusque approach to dealing with individuals and his puritanical attitude to alcohol and other distractions didn't help the situation. Early in 1909, Carlton's players revolted over money and Worrall's disciplinary demands, and some refused to take the field in the opening round. The matter rumbled on for a number of weeks, {{with a small group of}} players insisting on Worrall's resignation, which was duly given mid-season. He continued on as secretary, but resigned that position at the end of the season when the disharmony was still not repaired. A number of players who supported the ex-coach left Princes Park in sympathy.|$|E

25|$|The {{issue of}} {{national}} security {{is tied to the}} narcotics trade in Afghanistan; another report written by the Caucus in 2010 lists some recommendations on how to decrease the flow of opium from Afghanistan, and the <b>money</b> <b>coming</b> into the Taliban. With similar prescriptions as the Mérida Initiative, the United States is using DEA officers in conjunction with military personnel in Afghanistan to root out Taliban drug lords. The practice of eradication of the poppy crop only managed to drive farmers to side with the Taliban, as their livelihood was destroyed. The US is funding legitimate projects in Afghanistan in an attempt to get the work force out of the drug trade. The major issue in Afghanistan is corruption, the report estimates around $2.5 billion is doled out in bribes per year. How the US will continue to combat drug production, as they scale back their military presence in the coming years, remains to be seen.|$|E
25|$|Malakar {{was born}} in Capitol Hill, in {{downtown}} Seattle, the son of Jillian (Recchi) Blyth and Vasudeva Malakar. He later lived in the nearby suburb of Federal Way. His father, a musician, is a Bengali Indian immigrant born in Vrindavan, India. His mother is American-born, of Italian descent {{on one side and}} Dutch, English, and Irish ancestry on the other. His parents filed for divorce when he was three years old and had been separated for a year prior to doing so. When the divorce was filed, the family had almost no <b>money</b> <b>coming</b> in. His mother and the children were living in a Seattle apartment, and her only income was from welfare. His mother remarried, but his stepfather died soon afterwards. Although Malakar spent the majority of his formative years in the Seattle area, he has also lived in both California and Kauai, Hawaii, where he performed with the Hawaii Children's Theater group. While in Seattle, he spent three years with the Total Experience Gospel Choir.|$|E
25|$|The band {{opened the}} 1983 Monsters of Rock festival at Donington, and {{supported}} Black Sabbath on their 'Born Again' European tour. After getting dropped by MCA in January 1984 Diamond Head started {{work on their}} fourth studio album, entitled Flight East. Although never released, five tracks (Be Good, A New Messiah, Someone Waiting, Today and Back In The Powerage) emerged on bootleg and shows the band totally changing direction with the dropping of all the characteristic signature guitar solos and heavy dynamic riffs. The change in the band's musical direction was with the duo becoming bored of just playing Heavy Metal and {{felt that it was}} time to change. Another change the band made at the time was Brian switching from his Flying V to a Gibson Les Paul. Harris' lyrics had also taken a religious route, as with one of the new songs A New Messiah. After little interest from any record label to pick up the project (and with no <b>money</b> <b>coming</b> in) the band fell apart and in 1985 Tatler and Harris decided to take a break from one another.|$|E

25|$|The most {{dramatic}} and successful policy event was the currency reform of 1948. Since the 1930s, prices and wages had been controlled, but money had been plentiful. That meant {{that people had}} accumulated large paper assets, and that official prices and wages did not reflect reality, as the black market dominated the economy {{and more than half}} of all transactions were taking place unofficially. On 21 June 1948, the Western Allies withdrew the old currency and replaced it with the new Deutsche Mark at the rate of 1 new per 10 old. This wiped out 90% of government and private debt, as well as private savings. Prices were decontrolled, and labor unions agreed to accept a 15% wage increase, despite the 25% rise in prices. The result was that prices of German export products held steady, while profits and earnings from exports soared and were poured back into the economy. The currency reforms were simultaneous with the $1.4 billion in Marshall Plan <b>money</b> <b>coming</b> in from the United States, which was used primarily for investment.|$|E
25|$|Allegations of {{corruption}} {{were made on}} the basis of the price paid by Iberia and the Spanish firm's ulterior conduct (including some convoluted lease-back operations), with the airline paying the price for its own purchase with its assets. Subsequent management by American Airlines and SEPI drove Aerolíneas Argentinas into an almost terminal crisis in 2001. In , the aftermath began after the airline filed for bankruptcy protection from creditors, and went into administration; the salaries were paid by the Argentine Government, instead of using <b>money</b> <b>coming</b> from the SEPI. The payment of salaries for the upcoming months was suspended, as the mechanics union refused to accept the reorganisation plan raised by the SEPI to keep the company afloat. On 6 June, flights to Auckland, Los Angeles, Miami, New York, São Paulo, Sydney and Rio de Janeiro were halted. Owing to a million debt with the fuel supplier, the suspension of the daily flight to Madrid, which also served Rome and was the last connection with Europe, followed a week later. After this, most of the fleet was grounded, and only 30% and 10% of domestic and international flights, respectively, were operating.|$|E
25|$|Over 100 {{pieces of}} {{statuary}} {{had been sold}} from the gardens in 1848, 1921 and 1922, so {{it was decided to}} replace them gradually with replicas as and when funds could be raised. In 1989-90 Peter Inskip assessed the condition of the buildings. Work on the restoration of the buildings, based on this survey, was then prioritised. The major restorations have been the Grenville Column (1991), the Temple of Ancient Virtue (1992), the Oxford Gates and Lodges (1994), the Temple of Venus (1995) and the Temple of Concord & Victory (1996). This last had been severely compromised when 16 columns had been removed to build the new school chapel in 1926. Replacement columns were carved and the building re-roofed at the cost of £1,300,000. The cost of this first stage was £10,000,000, the <b>money</b> <b>coming</b> from several sources: a public appeal, the Heritage Lottery Fund and grants from English Heritage as well as private donors and other grant-giving bodies. The restoration process adopted an approach where each building, or element of the gardens was informed by archaeology. In order to make informed decisions about what to restore and why, archaeological techniques such as geophysics, excavation, building recording and monitoring {{in the form of an}} archaeological watching brief were all utilised.|$|E
