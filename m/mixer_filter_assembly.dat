40|$|A report {{describes}} {{an adaptation of}} a <b>filter</b> <b>assembly</b> to enable it {{to be used to}} filter out microorganisms from a propulsion system. The <b>filter</b> <b>assembly</b> has previously been used for particulates greater than 2 micrometers. Projects that utilize large volumes of nonmetallic materials of planetary protection concern pose a challenge to their bioburden budget, as a conservative specification value of 30 spores per cubic centimeter is typically used. Helium was collected utilizing an adapted filtration approach employing an existing Millipore <b>filter</b> <b>assembly</b> apparatus used by the propulsion team for particulate analysis. The filter holder on the assembly has a 47 -mm diameter, and typically a 1. 2 - 5 micrometer pore-size filter is used for particulate analysis making it compatible with commercially available sterilization filters (0. 22 micrometers) that are necessary for biological sampling. This adaptation to an existing technology provides a proof-of-concept and a demonstration of successful use in a ground equipment system.

40|$|Multi-spectral {{optical filters}} are an {{essential}} component for spaceborne optical imaging. The performance of a multi-spectral camera mainly depends {{on the performance of}} its optical system.

40|$|On March 18, 2009 a Defense Waste Processing Facility (DWPF) GC Line <b>Filter</b> <b>Assembly</b> was {{received}} at the Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL). This <b>filter</b> <b>assembly</b> {{was removed from}} operation following the completion of Sludge Batch 4 processing in the DWPF. Work on this sample was requested in a Technical Assistance Request. This document reports the pictures, observations, samples collected, and analytical results for the assembly. The assembly arrived at SRNL separated into its three component filters: high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) - 1, HEPA- 2, and a high efficiency mist evaporator (HEME). Each stage of the assembly's media was sampled and examined visually and by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Solids built up in the filter housing following the first stage HEME, were dissolved in dilute nitric acid and analyzed by ICP-AES and the undissolved white solids were analyzed by x-ray diffraction (XRD). The {{vast majority of the}} material {{in each of the three}} stages of the DWPF GC Line <b>Filter</b> <b>Assembly</b> appears to be contaminated with a Hg compound that is {approx} 59 wt% Hg on a total solids basis. The Hg species was identified by XRD analysis to contain a mixture of Hg{sub 4 }(OH) (NO{sub 3 }) {sub 3 } and Hg{sub 10 }(OH) {sub 4 }(NO{sub 3 }) {sub 6 }. Only in the core sample of the second stage HEPA, did this material appear to be completely covering portions of the filter media, possibly explaining the pressure drops observed by DWPF. The fact that the material migrates through the HEME filter and both HEPA filters, and that it was seen collecting on the outlet side of the HEME filter, would seem to indicate that these filters are not efficient at removing this material. Further SRAT off-gas system modeling should help determine the extent of Hg breakthrough past the Mercury Water Wash Tank (MWWT). The SRAT off-gas system has not been modeled since startup of the facility. Improvements to the efficiency of Hg stripping prior to the ammonia scrubber would seem to be the only way to prevent/mitigate the formation of the compounds found in the GC Line <b>Filter</b> <b>Assembly</b> <b>filters</b> and therefore prevent pluggage of this <b>filter</b> <b>assembly...</b>|$|R

On the 15 -layer <b>filter</b> paper <b>assembly,</b> 51 brands of the cigarettes sold in Canada produced 90 to 100 % full-length burning.
