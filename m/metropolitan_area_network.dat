50|$|The Internet {{consists}} {{of different types}} of communication networks. Common types include local <b>area</b> <b>networks</b> (LAN), <b>metropolitan</b> <b>area</b> <b>networks</b> (MAN), and wide <b>area</b> <b>networks</b> (WAN). Local <b>area</b> <b>networks</b> have the coverage of a small geographic area, such as a school, residence, building, or company. <b>Metropolitan</b> <b>area</b> <b>networks</b> cover a larger area, such as a city or state. Wide <b>area</b> <b>networks</b> provide communication in a broad geographic area covering national and international locations. Personal <b>area</b> <b>networks</b> (PANs) are wireless LANs with a very short range (up to a few meters), enabling computer devices (such as PDAs and printers) to communicate with other nearby devices and computers.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Wireless Local <b>area</b> <b>networks</b> (wLANs), {{particularly}} from standards 802. 1 b/g, have become extremely widespread {{in a very}} short time, in society in general as well as at an industrial level. One of the limitations of this technology is its coverage. The family of new standards, such as 802. 16, allows us to overcome these limitations, enabling then their use as <b>Metropolitan</b> <b>Area</b> <b>Networks</b> (MAN), as required by some application domains of industrial networks. In the present work we present an application of this technology in telemonitoring systems on <b>metropolitan</b> <b>areas</b> which shows their potential, but also the complexity of predicting their behaviour in a dynamic scenario such as a large city.

40|$|Wireless {{technology}} has shown tremendous growth and acceptance {{as a solution}} for both wireless local <b>area</b> <b>networks</b> and wireless <b>metropolitan</b> <b>area</b> <b>networks.</b> Ā e use of multimedia applications over IP with quality-of-service (QoS) support is now a reality in corporate networks and is rapidly expanding to the wireless networks. In this chapter, the state-of-the-art in supporting the QoS concepts in the IEEE 802. 11 -based wireless local <b>area</b> <b>networks</b> and the IEEE 802. 16 -based wireless <b>metropolitan</b> <b>area</b> <b>networks</b> is presented. Āe chapter {{is divided into two}} parts. Ā e first part starts by describing the IEEE 802. 11 standard that supports only best effort (BE) services before examining the new IEEE 802. 11 e that is introduced to support sophisticated services that guarantee QoS attributes such as bandwidth, delay, and jitter. Āe second part explores the QoS in the wireless <b>metropolitan</b> <b>area</b> <b>networks</b> as introduced in IEEE 802. 16 standard and its IEEE 802. 16 e amendment. Open research issues pertaining to realizing QoS in these networks are identified and some of the solutions that are proposed to address these challenges are also presented...|$|R
