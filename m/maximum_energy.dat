5|$|Although {{a primary}} {{concern of the}} Sprint missile was high speed, the design was not {{optimized}} for <b>maximum</b> <b>energy,</b> but instead relied on the first stage (booster) to provide as much thrust as possible. This left the second stage (sustainer) lighter than optimal, to improve its maneuverability. Staging was under ground control, with the booster cut away from the missile body by explosives. The sustainer was not necessarily ignited immediately, depending on the flight profile. For control, the first stage used a system that injected Freon into the exhaust to cause thrust vectoring to control the flight. The second stage used small air vanes for control.|$|E

25|$|One {{model that}} {{estimates}} {{the properties of}} an electron gas at absolute zero in metals is the Fermi gas. The electrons, being Fermions, must be in different quantum states, which leads the electrons to get very high typical velocities, even at absolute zero. The <b>maximum</b> <b>energy</b> that electrons can have at absolute zero is called the Fermi energy. The Fermi temperature is defined as this <b>maximum</b> <b>energy</b> divided by Boltzmann's constant, and is {{of the order of}} 80,000 K for typical electron densities found in metals. For temperatures significantly below the Fermi temperature, the electrons behave in almost the same way as at absolute zero.

25|$|Electron {{degeneracy}} {{pressure is}} a quantum-mechanical effect {{arising from the}} Pauli exclusion principle. Since electrons are fermions, no two electrons {{can be in the}} same state, so not all electrons can be in the minimum-energy level. Rather, electrons must occupy a band of energy levels. Compression of the electron gas increases the number of electrons in a given volume and raises the <b>maximum</b> <b>energy</b> level in the occupied band. Therefore, the energy of the electrons increases on compression, so pressure must be exerted on the electron gas to compress it, producing electron degeneracy pressure. With sufficient compression, electrons are forced into nuclei in the process of electron capture, relieving the pressure.|$|E
25|$|The energy {{released}} in a static electricity discharge may vary {{over a wide}} range. The energy in joules can be calculated from the capacitance (C) of the object and the static potential V in volts (V) by the formula E= ½CV2. One experimenter estimates the capacitance {{of the human body}} as high as 400 picofarads, and a charge of 50,000 volts, discharged e.g. during touching a charged car, creating a spark with energy of 500 millijoules. Another estimate is 100–300 pF and 20,000 volts, producing a <b>maximum</b> <b>energy</b> of 60 mJ. IEC 479-2:1987 states that a discharge with energy greater than 5000 mJ is a direct serious risk to human health. IEC 60065 states that consumer products cannot discharge more than 350 mJ into a person.|$|E
25|$|The <b>maximum</b> <b>energy</b> is a {{function}} of dielectric volume, permittivity, and dielectric strength. Changing the plate area and the separation between the plates while maintaining the same volume causes no change of the maximum amount of energy that the capacitor can store, so long as the distance between plates remains much smaller than both the length and width of the plates. In addition, these equations assume that the electric field is entirely concentrated in the dielectric between the plates. In reality there are fringing fields outside the dielectric, for example between the sides of the capacitor plates, which increase the effective capacitance of the capacitor. This is sometimes called parasitic capacitance. For some simple capacitor geometries this additional capacitance term can be calculated analytically. It becomes negligibly small when the ratios of plate width to separation and length to separation are large.|$|E
40|$|We study {{a generic}} class of models for ultra-high energy cosmic ray (UHECR) phenomenology, {{in which the}} sources {{accelerate}} protons and nuclei with a power-law spectrum having the same index, but with different values for the <b>maximum</b> proton <b>energies,</b> distributed according to a power-law. We show that, for energies sufficiently lower than the <b>maximum</b> proton <b>energy,</b> such models are equivalent to single-type source models, with a larger effective power law index and a heavier composition at the source. We calculate the resulting enhancement of the abundance of nuclei, and find typical values of a factor 2 - 10 for Fe nuclei. At the highest energies, the heavy nuclei enhancement ratios become larger, and the granularity of the sources {{must also be taken}} into account. We conclude that the effect of a distribution of <b>maximum</b> <b>energies</b> among sources must be considered in order to understand both the energy spectrum and the composition of UHECRs, as measured on Earth.

25|$|Most {{familiar}} systems cannot achieve negative temperatures because adding energy always {{increases their}} entropy. However, some systems have a {{maximum amount of}} energy that they can hold, and as they approach that <b>maximum</b> <b>energy</b> their entropy actually begins to decrease. Because temperature {{is defined by the}} relationship between energy and entropy, such a system's temperature becomes negative, even though energy is being added. As a result, the Boltzmann factor for states of systems at negative temperature increases rather than decreases with increasing state energy. Therefore, no complete system, i.e. including the electromagnetic modes, can have negative temperatures, since there is no highest energy state , so that the sum of the probabilities of the states would diverge for negative temperatures. However, for quasi-equilibrium systems (e.g. spins out of equilibrium with the electromagnetic field) this argument does not apply, and negative effective temperatures are attainable.|$|E

500|$|The most {{important}} isotope is astatine-211, {{the only one}} in commercial use.

In a particle accelerator, such as a cyclotron, alpha particles are collided with the bismuth. Even though only one bismuth isotope is used (bismuth-209), the reaction may occur in three possible ways, producing astatine-209, astatine-210, or astatine-211.
