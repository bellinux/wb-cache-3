50|$|An inaugural {{train was}} run on 10 August 1888 hauled by an 0-6-0 tank engine {{that had been}} used by the {{contractor}} constructing the line, and named Freshwater for the occasion. For this demonstration run the locomotive pulled a single <b>mineral</b> <b>wagon</b> fitted with seats. A revenue earning goods train ran from Newport to Freshwater with two wagons of coal on 1 September 1888.|$|E
50|$|An {{accident}} {{occurred at}} {{the northern end of}} the cutting, at the junction, on 31 December 1969 when a northbound goods train on the slow lines derailed. A southbound passenger train from Northampton was passing at the time at about 75 mph and collided with the derailed wagons and was partly de-railed itself. The driver of the passenger train was killed. The cause of the derailment was the failure of a main bearing spring on an empty 16-ton <b>mineral</b> <b>wagon</b> and very similar to a previous incident on the Northampton loop in 1967.|$|E
50|$|Skellingthorpe {{railway station}} closed to {{passengers}} in 1955, although the line continued to carry freight until 1979. A 1975 report on railway accidents by the Department of Transport observed {{that there had}} recently been a serious derailment 'at Skellingthorpe'. A loaded <b>mineral</b> <b>wagon</b> in a fully fitted freight train derailed at 40 mph, dragging nineteen other wagons into derailment and causing extensive damage to the single track. A 35 mph speed limit existed on the branch, but the driver was adamant {{he had not been}} speeding; on examination a fault was found in the speedometer, caused by water in the cable, which led to its reading 10 mph slow at 40 mph. The signal box used to stand beside Lincoln Road (near the Heritage Room). A report by North Kesteven District Council in 1979 argued that 'the signal box is a prominent unspoilt reminder of the early days of railway construction, and should be preserved if at all possible... British Rail will be urged to repaint the woodwork of the unspoilt signal box in an authentic Victorian colour scheme.' The signal box became obsolete shortly afterwards, along with the cessation of freight transport, and it was subsequently pulled down.|$|E
50|$|Thursday 25 February, 1858 {{was fixed}} for the opening: 24 wagons loaded with 150 tons of Rhymney iron formed the first train, {{followed}} by a second of 40 <b>mineral</b> <b>wagons</b> containing 240 tons. The line was single-track throughout.|$|R

50|$|The museum aims {{to collect}} and operate {{industrial}} locomotives and <b>mineral</b> <b>wagons</b> from iron ore quarries. They also have a face shovel, a drag line excavator and dumpers as used in quarry systems. The cab of the massive dragline excavator Sundew is on display here.|$|R
40|$|The {{combination}} of defects and external forces influencing and {{acting on a}} running wagon raises a significant issue regarding the safety of operation. The studies performed {{in this area are}} commonly limited to one or two factors, and often present results taking these factors into account separately. This does not provide a comprehensive understanding of the response of the dynamic systems and it may be nonconservative to describe wagon dynamics by analysing results without the consideration of combined effects of wind, lateral coupler force, curving and track irregularities. The wagon dynamics behaviour assessment is generally relied on for the estimation of the fundamental parameters required for making a conclusion onsafety acceptance. Due to the presence of a great number of input parameters, a special methodology has been developed for the study of wagon behaviour using appropriate multibody simulation packages. This paper proposes a methodology generally based on the existing Australian Standard (AS 7509) safety limits to find the acceptable operational range of rail vehicle reaction. A worked example of the application of the developed methodology has been presented to analyse <b>mineral</b> <b>wagon</b> behaviour during heavy haul train operations...|$|E
40|$|Purpose. Study the {{possibility}} of using geometrically-force method to determine sections of high risk of derailment in railway stations at empty wagons movement. In the test program track diagnosing subject to longitudinal forces in the freight train effecting empty wagons is provided. Methodology. To this effect empty <b>mineral</b> <b>wagon</b> and thermal cistern were equipped with strain-gauge wheel sets, strain-gauge automatic coupler and other instruments, set in the freight train weighing 4500 t. Findings. In the course of this work it was ascertained that the geometric-force ethod gives possibility to receive additional information about the track condition from the position of empty cars stability against derailment. It is shown that some sections of high risk of derailment pieces of line does not discarded by traditional ways, based on an assessment of the geometric parameters of the way. Those track sections are identified by this method, which can not be evaluated by technical means, used currently on track measurement cars. Pieces of line with low parameters on empty cars stability against derailment are individual and they are determined not only by the sizes of deviations, but their form, a combination of different types of roughness, profile and defective elements of the permanent way. Originality. Geometric-force method should be considered as complementary to the existing technology assessment of the way on the geometrical parameters; its implementation will allow revealing the track section, dangerous for the motion of empty wagons. Practical value. For the geometrically-force method realization of assessment of the way in the railway network of JSC «Russian Railways» it is proposed {{on the basis of the}} accumulated statistics and experimental data in accordance with wagons tests with a high center of gravity to develop specialized software for wagons through gauges to assess ways bygeometrically-force method that excludes the use in technology assessment of the additional freight wagon way with a strain-gauge wheel sets. ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Mineral</b> <b>wagons</b> were {{phased out}} by BR in the 1970s, {{following}} reduction {{in demand for}} household coal {{and the development of}} merry-go-round trains, which used much larger (and braked) hopper wagons. Two batches of 16T wagons were bought by CC Crump in 1971, hired to ICI in Runcorn for the transport of soda ash, and subsequently scrapped in 1979.|$|R
50|$|Positioning and {{marshalling}} {{of a large}} flow of <b>mineral</b> <b>wagons</b> {{was achieved}} by horse power at first, but in 1927 a Manning Wardle 0-4-0ST locomotive was provided. It had been built for the South Eastern Railway in 1881 and had worked at Folkestone Harbour. It was numbered 313 but became service locomotive 225S at Medlon. It was working there until 1938.|$|R
50|$|With wooden bodied wagons proving uneconomic {{to replace}} for their owners, and post the 1930s {{recession}} the wagon makers {{looking for more}} economic longer-life products, both Charles Roberts and Company and the Butterley Company started developing standard all-steel construction <b>mineral</b> <b>wagons,</b> with capacities of 14 LT and 15 LT. those from Roberts had sloping sides, and both companies a combination of riveted or welded construction.|$|R
50|$|On 23 December 1903, a {{passenger}} train collided with wagons {{on the line}} at Springhead Junction, Hull. Locomotive No.34 with a train of 5 four wheel carriages and a fish van ran {{into the back of}} a formation of a brake van and 11 loaded <b>mineral</b> <b>wagons</b> which had detached unnoticed from an earlier train due to a broken coupling. The driver was seriously injured, passengers reported only minor injuries.|$|R
50|$|The works also {{maintained}} {{a variety of}} wagons and passenger vehicles, building new <b>mineral</b> <b>wagons</b> and a few carriages, with a new workshop in 1901. However a new wagon works was built at Cardiff and, with work finishing its main work of converting Westinghouse air brakes to GWR vacuum brakes, the {{carriage and wagon works}} was phased out. However, in 1939 new workshops were built for carriage repairs only.|$|R
50|$|With the Company absolved {{from the}} supply of <b>mineral</b> <b>wagons,</b> it now {{published}} a specification for the carriers' wagons {{so that they could}} operate together in trains, as few of the existing wagons were compatible with each other. The carriers had 4,000 wagons between them and there was a protest at the cost of converting them. Captain Simmons of the Board of Trade was called in to adjudicate.|$|R
50|$|The centre {{is home to}} a vide {{variety of}} goods wagons {{including}} British Railways 16 ton <b>mineral</b> <b>wagons</b> and pallet vans, the latter having been formerly owned and operated by Scotch Whisky manufacturer Johnnie Walker. The centre has recently purchased a London, Midland and Scottish Railway Inspection Saloon which is currently being repaired and it is hoped that {{it will be able to}} provide rides for the public in the near future.|$|R
50|$|In 1955 {{production}} {{of a wide range}} of rail vehicles including trams, diesel locomotives, underground and rack locomotives, and <b>mineral</b> <b>wagons</b> was underway, with 60% of the production for export. In 1960 the factory began to undertake the {{production of}} ultra-pure metals by electron beam furnace. In the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s the factory produced new classes of electric locomotive for the Deutsche Reichsbahn including the DR Class 250 (1974), the DR Class 243 (1982).|$|R

50|$|A {{passenger}} train from Glasgow to Greenock {{was leaving the}} station {{on the morning of}} 16 January 1855. A mineral train travelling on the other line in the opposite direction approached and as the trains passed each other, trucks {{at the rear of the}} mineral train left the rails. They fell on the up line as the {{passenger train}} was coming. This resulted in the passenger train stopping quickly. Nobody was killed, however twelve <b>mineral</b> <b>wagons</b> were damaged.|$|R
50|$|The GWR {{used the}} {{arrangement}} {{to improve the}} facilities at Barry Dock. It was encouraging the adoption of 20-ton <b>mineral</b> <b>wagons</b> {{at the time and}} the opportunity was taken to adapt the equipment at Barry accordingly. Sixteen new coaling hoists were constructed at Barry. These were massive structures: about 850 tons of concrete were employed at each hoist foundation. Track and structure improvements were necessary and wagon turntables had to be enlarged for the new wagons.|$|R
50|$|A {{wide variety}} of {{specialised}} wagons were reserved {{for the use of}} various railway departments. The Locomotive Department had a large fleet of coal wagons and many were constructed from iron. They were allocated diagrams in the N series alongside ordinary <b>mineral</b> <b>wagons</b> for revenue earning traffic but were identified by a large 'LOCO' painted on the sides. The more common designs carried either 10 tons (diagrams N6 and N7) or 20 tons (N2, N4 and N5) but there were some exceptionally large bogie wagons such as diagram N11 that carried 40 tons.|$|R
5000|$|The line's primary {{objective}} was transporting minerals and the products and biproducts of coking plants. Photographs of trains {{in later years}} typically consist of a mix of <b>mineral</b> <b>wagons</b> and tar tanker wagons. The prime purpose of the passenger service was to enable workers to get from Workington to Lowca Colliery (also known as Harrington No. 10 Pit) which was situated on a remote cliff top overlooking the Irish Sea. Workers from Whitehaven {{were able to use}} workmen's trains which shuttled between [...] and [...] at the western end of the Gilgarran Branch near [...]|$|R
50|$|PKP Cargo owns {{more than}} 62,500 wagons, of {{which more than}} 44,000 are {{currently}} in use. <b>Mineral</b> <b>wagons</b> (approx. 28,000), carrying bulk materials (coal, ores, crushed stone), farm produce (beetroot, potatoes), {{as well as other}} goods, such as timber, machinery and equipment, account for {{a major part of the}} rolling stock. The second most numerous group at PKP Cargo are flat wagons. PKP Cargo uses them to carry containers, metal products, vehicles, machinery, timber etc. In addition, the company has ordinary and special covered vans, wagons with opening roofs and special wagons which can carry, for instance, heavy industrial goods exceeding loading gauge limits, as well as heavy electrical equipment.|$|R
50|$|At {{the time}} of {{authorisation}} of the Pontypool line in 1845, the Company was heavily committed in upgrading its existing lines. A financial depression set in at this time, and money became impossible to obtain for railway schemes. As a result the Company was unable to complete the Newport and Pontypool Railway within the time limit set by Parliament. The Newport and Pontypool Amendment Act was passed in 1848, allowing an extension of time for construction, authority to carry passengers, and a change of name to the Monmouthshire Railway and Canal Company. They were freed from the obligation to provide <b>mineral</b> <b>wagons,</b> but locomotives remained their responsibility, and horse traction was to be prohibited when passenger operation started.|$|R
25|$|On Tuesday, 18 April 1967 {{at about}} 2.31pm, a wagon on a goods train of 69 empty <b>mineral</b> <b>wagons,</b> {{travelling}} on the down line to Northampton, derailed {{just south of}} the village. The train travelled a further 1½ miles before more wagons derailed, a little distance north of the village playing field. Some of the wagons went towards the up line from Northampton to London and were hit by a four-coach passenger train at about 70mph. Although the brakes of the passenger train had been fully applied, two coaches were derailed with one falling onto its side. All 45 passengers and train crew were evacuated fairly promptly. Of these, 21 were injured but only two were detained at Northampton General Hospital. The driver of the passenger train was seriously injured but both he and the passenger detained overnight made a good recovery.|$|R
50|$|For centuries {{there have}} been a number of places where ferries took {{passengers}} and goods across the Forth, and one of these was at the narrow part of the Firth of Forth at Queensferry. When the Scottish railway network began to take shape from 1845, the two main northward routes authorised were to cross the Forth in Stirling, or to cross it directly opposite Edinburgh. The former course was taken by the Scottish Central Railway, which connected Castlecary on the Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway with Perth via Stirling. The latter course was adopted by the Edinburgh and Northern Railway, which built its line from Burntisland to Perth and Tayport, opposite Broughty, east of Dundee. The SCR route was considered a large detour by way of Falkirk and Larbert, but the E&NR route involved a significant ferry crossing, and a second one to cross the Tay to reach Dundee. The E&NR later introduced roll-on roll-off train ferries for goods and <b>mineral</b> <b>wagons,</b> avoiding transshipment.|$|R
50|$|Down trains {{continued}} to run entirely by gravity but faster up journeys and longer trains increased line capacity. A new timetable dated October 1863 shows six departures daily from each terminus at two-hour intervals, starting at 7:00 am and taking 1 hour 50 minutes including stops (totalling 20 minutes) at Tanygrisiau, Hafod-y-Llyn and Penrhyn. Trains passed only at Hafod-y-Llyn (from 1872 Tan-y-Bwlch). When passenger services started, the usual practice was for locomotive-hauled up trains {{to consist of}} loaded general goods and <b>mineral</b> <b>wagons,</b> followed by passenger carriages, followed by empty slate wagons with brakesmen. Down trains were run in up to four separate (uncoupled) portions: loaded slate wagons, goods wagons, passenger carriages and the locomotive running light. This unusual and labour-intensive method of operation was highly dangerous, {{at least as far}} as passengers were concerned; consequently, the down passenger and goods portions were combined into a single train headed by the locomotive.|$|R
5000|$|The {{passenger}} {{rolling stock}} used in steam days bore {{little resemblance to}} conventional railway carriages, employing open-top, [...] "toast-rack" [...] and [...] "knifeboard" [...] seating, and being built by companies associated {{with the construction of}} urban tramcars (Milnes, Starbuck & Falcon, etc.). After electrification the resemblance to an urban tramway became more marked with the introduction of the huge Brush-built electric cars and because of the operation style (the signalling was used only to regulate entry to the passing loops and not to control the actual running of cars). The track was always laid with conventional railway-type rail and not grooved tram-rail and the railway also handled conventional goods wagons (exchanged with the London Midland & Scottish Railway at Mumbles Road station and with the Great Western Railway at the Swansea terminus). In the early nineteenth century a tramway was a line for <b>mineral</b> <b>wagons</b> (trams), the term railway being used when edge rails replaced plates. After the passing of the Tramways Act of 1870 the term tramway became almost exclusively associated with urban transport systems.|$|R
50|$|The {{successor}} railway to the E&NR, the Edinburgh, Perth and Dundee Railway, installed train ferries {{for goods}} and <b>mineral</b> traffic: the <b>wagons</b> were transferred on to rails on the ferryboats, avoiding the transshipping, {{but this was}} still an imperfect arrangement.|$|R
5000|$|There were {{a number}} of {{ironstone}} quarries around Hook Norton. In the 1890s the Hook Norton Ironstone Partnership were dispatching ore by rail, with sidings {{on the south side of}} the down platform. From the sidings a steep standard gauge line ran in a curve, passing under the viaduct to a tipping dock where ore was tipped from a 1'8" [...] gauge tramway line. This line was operated by an 0-6-0 Manning Wardle locomotive named Hook Norton The sidings were subsequently turned into loops with the addition of a connection at the west end. The partnership was wound up in 1903 and the sidings became the property of the GWR. In 1907 they were extended towards Banbury, forming a loop which could hold sixty <b>mineral</b> <b>wagons.</b> A new signal box was opened on the up platform at this time. The GWR also acquired the locomotive Hook Norton which was subsequently used on the Weymouth Harbour Tramway for many years. In 1899 the Brymbo Ironworks of Wrexham established a new quarry at Hook Norton, which it connected to the railway at Council Hill Sidings, [...] mile east of the station, with a narrow gauge railway. The Brymbo Ironworks closed in 1946 and was dismantled in 1948. In 1929 the GWR began operating a bus service between Chipping Norton and Banbury via Hook Norton. In the early 1930s this service was transferred to Midland Red and became a serious competitor to the railway's passenger service, having the advantage of a direct journey to Banbury compared to the circuitous route taken by the railway. In the period 1935-9 only 40-64 rail tickets per week were sold. In 1930 the station had a staff of four: a stationmaster, two porters and two signalmen.|$|R
50|$|In the 1870s and 1880s, assays of {{precious}} metals in White Chief Canyon and on Empire Mountain {{led to the}} boomtown of Beulah. The first discovery of silver in the Mineral King Valley occurred in 1872, below Mineral Peak and Empire Mountain.Following the discovery, the <b>Mineral</b> King <b>Wagon</b> and Toll Road Company was established in December 1873 to build a wagon road. The first routing of Mineral King Road followed the East Fork Canyon's south side. Until then, access to Mineral King was by rough tracks. A second discovery of silver in 1878 drew more prospectors to the Mineral King area and a second Mineral King Road, following a different route up {{the north side of}} the canyon, was constructed in 1879. This created the route for much of the present-day Mineral King Road.|$|R
