40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{investigates the}} level of satisfaction among expectant mothers with the care services provided during childbirth. Satisfaction reflects a subjective perception of an expectant mother in meeting her needs during childbirth. The feeling of satisfaction is very personal, however, evaluation of the care provided needs to be determined and not ignored. It is important for expectant mothers that the health care professionals present as empathic, friendly, co-operative, and tactful. Theoretical part was developed from evidence-based literature and available findings related to this problematic. There is {{a description of a}} childbirth process including a midwife's role during the individual stages of childbirth and options for pain management. Other chapters focus on midwife's approach toward an expectant mother and factors which influence {{the level of}} satisfaction during childbirth. Dissertation's aim was to determine whether the expectant mothers were more satisfied in smaller <b>maternity</b> <b>departments,</b> and to evaluate the way a midwife may influence the mother's satisfaction. There were two hypotheses stated and verified by a statistical testing. Hypothesis No. 1 : Expectant mothers are more satisfied in smaller <b>maternity</b> <b>departments</b> than larger ones. Hypothesis No. 2 : The level of satisfaction is influenced by midwife's empathic approach. Practical part focused mainly on a midwife's approach toward expectant mother. A quantitative research was implemented in form of questionnaires. The research sample constituted of expectant mothers from four postpartum departments in the Czech Republic. In total the sample included 215 expectant mothers, 109 from smaller facilities and 106 from larger <b>maternity</b> <b>departments.</b> In terms of the overall level of satisfaction with their midwife during the childbirth process, 89 % of expectant mothers from smaller <b>maternity</b> <b>departments</b> and 83 % of expectant mothers from larger departments stated they were satisfied. Conversely, 11 % of respondents from smaller facilities and 17 % of respondents from larger facilities were dissatisfied. Based on research analysis comparing the level of satisfaction of expectant mothers from smaller and larger <b>maternity</b> <b>departments</b> the hypothesis no. 1 "Expectant mothers are more satisfied in smaller <b>maternity</b> <b>departments</b> than the larger ones" did not show as statistically significant and was rejected. Nonetheless, the questionnaire responses clearly showed that empathic approach of a midwife influenced expectant mother's satisfaction. Statistical testing demonstrated a significant correlation between an expectant mother's satisfaction and empathic approach of a midwife. The second hypothesis "The level of satisfaction is influenced by midwife's empathic approach" was accepted. The research findings may serve as a guiding material for the midwives in order to provide a high quality care to expectant mothers during the childbirth process. They may also be utilised by future midwives who are in undergraduate preparation for the profession, or those professionals who contribute in any way during the childbirth process. Additionally, the research findings may be presented at conferences designated for midwives...|$|R

40|$|This study arose out of {{interested}} and concerned observations {{of social work}} and crisis pregnancy counselling and support staff attached to the antenatal and <b>maternity</b> <b>departments</b> of an Irish rural-based general hospital. Staff noted a recurring incidence in social work caseloads of women attending for antenatal care later than recommended guidelines, often having made no or limited disclosure of the pregnancy to significant others. These cases were considered to come within the staff’s understanding of ‘concealed pregnancies’. Discussions with colleagues {{in other areas of}} the antenatal and maternity services indicated particular issues, concerns and challenges arising in meeting the needs of women in such circumstances. This led to a research initiative, in partnership with the Crisis Pregnancy Agency, to gain a deeper understanding of concealed pregnancy. A primary objective of the research would be to generate recommendations to guide and inform the planning and development of a national policy and framework of services responding to concealed pregnancy in medical, social, counselling and support services settings throughout Ireland...|$|R

The purpose of this prospective register-based cohort-study was to characterize the clinical virulence of the pdm (H 1 N 1 / 09) v during pregnancy in La Réunion. Methods/Principal Findings: Over a twelve-week pdm wave (13 July to 3 October 2009), 294 pregnant women presented with an influenza-like illness (ILI) to one of the three <b>maternity</b> <b>departments</b> of the South Reunion area, Indian Ocean.

The median body temperature was higher in women experiencing pdm flu than in those with non pdm ILI (38. 9 uC versus 38. 3 uC, P, 0. 0001), without evidence linked to circulating viremia.

40|$|Objective {{to explore}} midwives’ {{accounts}} {{of the characteristics of}} ‘good’ leadership and ‘good’ midwifery. Design and methods a phenomenological interview survey. Participants were asked about what made both good and poor midwives and leaders. Setting two <b>maternity</b> <b>departments</b> within National Health Service trusts in the North West of England. Participants qualified midwives, selected by random sampling stratified to encompass senior and junior grades. Analysis thematic analysis, carried out manually. Findings ten midwives were interviewed. Sixteen codes and six sub-themes were generated. Across the responses, two clear dimensions (themes) were identified, relating on the one hand to aspects of knowledge, skill and competence (termed ‘skilled competence’), {{and on the other hand}} to specific personality characteristics (termed ‘emotional intelligence’). This study suggests that the ability to act knowledgeably, safely and competently was seen as a basic requirement for both clinical midwives and midwife leaders. The added element which made both the midwife and the leader ‘good’ was the extent of their emotional capability. Conclusions and implications for practice this small-scale in-depth study could form the basis for hypothesis generation for larger scale work in this area in future. The findings offer some reinforcement for the potential applicability of theories of transformational leadership to midwifery management and practice...|$|R
