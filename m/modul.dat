The school and hotel are also in Vienna’s 19th district, and were designed and built from 1973-1975. The university was conceptualized by the leaders of the Tourism College <b>MODUL,</b> and was named <b>MODUL</b> University.

In the work are at first explained terms of light technology. Then are concisely described actual light sources, that can be replaced by LED. That concern: classic bulbs, halogen bulbs, linear fluorescents and compact bulbs. After that is described principle of LED light fittings and advantages, disadvantages nowadays to use LED light fittings. The main emphasis is placed on chapter 5. The compensations of linear fluorescents by LED <b>moduls.</b> The following chapters are dedicated to comparison of fluorescent lamps and LED <b>moduls.</b> Involving-photometrics parameters, luminous intensity, lumniance analysis and also economics comparison of lighting systems with fluorescent lamps versus the LED <b>moduls...</b>|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose an {{architecture}} of an image understanding system for a situated artificial communicator realizing human-machine interaction. Starting with sensor input the processing is initially carried out in separate pathways using different schemes of image segmentation. Subsequently, a hybrid technique for 2 D-object recognition is employed. The final model based 3 D-reconstruction yields a 3 D-scene representation. Intermediate results are linked over time in memory <b>moduls</b> to enhance efficiency of processing on image sequences.

40|$|Goal of the {{integrated}} project which included eight {{small and medium-sized}} haulage companies was to analyse qualification demands and work loads of transportation managers, to develop a modular system to qualify transportation managers and to test some <b>moduls</b> serving as examples, to optimize their work system and to enquire criteria for job adequate technical environment. The following advances for an integrative and participative proceeding were used: -questionnaires with transportation managers, - continuous work with transportation managers of the included haulage companies in a task force, -work with transportation managers within the operational context. The result is a concept to qualify transportation managers in small and medium-sized haulage companies and to design their occupational functions based on <b>moduls</b> which {{are close to the}} practical work and were developed in form of a modular system. These <b>moduls</b> can be used as standard packages or be tailored to each company's specific needs. (orig.)

The user formulates requirements on the processing of its application by properties of the coarse-grained software <b>moduls</b> and relations between them in a special language, independingly on special knowledge about the system. Concerns of the requirements on the processing are load balancing, a minimization of the communications overhead between the <b>moduls</b> and the installation of redundant processes in order to guarantee fault tolerance.

The results have a conceptual character for application in the design and the implementation of real tools. Besides there are hints for further research in this direction. (orig.)
