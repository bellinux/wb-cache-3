40|$|Dynamic {{calibration}} {{of pressure}} sensors is challenging. Often, steady-state calibration is applied on pressure sensors {{used to measure}} dynamical measurements. Steady-state calibration does not represent the dynamic behavior of a sensor. With dynamical calibration {{the quality of a}} dynamical measurement increases. This is the motivation for my <b>master</b> <b>s</b> <b>thesis,</b> written at the Waterpower Laboratory at NTNU in spring 2017. The <b>master</b> <b>s</b> <b>thesis</b> investigates methods for performing dynamic calibration. The best method {{is believed to be the}} use of an aperiodic pressure generator, because of its large range of frequencies and pressures, and in addition, the low cost and simple construction. The dynamic calibration method developed in this <b>master</b> <b>s</b> <b>thesis</b> is based on a step-response method with use of ultra-fast diaphragm valves with response time less than 5 ms. The target was to build a functional dynamic calibration system, and by use of the system, find the natural frequency of the calibrated sensor. By finding the natural frequency of the calibrated sensor, it is possible to find the uncertainty in dynamic measurements, and therefore increase the quality of the measurements. To generate a perfect working dynamic calibration system was proven to be difficult. The first problem arose when it was realized that the machining of the calibration system was not done according to the drawings. These inaccuracies resulted in air pockets in the system that was impossible to deflate, and as a consequence, signal noise was observed in the pressure step. The second problem was the behavior of the diaphragm valves. When the valve opened, the open-valve position was not fixed, and the diaphragm piston started to oscillate. This led to slow fluctuations prior to the final state after the step. The slow fluctuations worked as a low pass filter and delayed the entire system. This caused a slow rise time of the step generated. The closing position of the valves was fixed, and here the slow fluctuations did not occur, and the rise time improved. The calibration system does still not work in a perfect manner, but has a range of application. An almost suitable step was generated, and with use of Fast Fourier Transform it could be indicated that the highest natural frequency achieved by the system was 2246 Hz. By knowing this frequency and with use of a reference sensor it can be determined if a calibrated sensor does not need an extra uncertainty term. The dynamic calibration system developed could also be used to verify if a dynamic pressure sensor and amplifier behave in a correct manner. However, these methods need further investigation by experiments. Further work has also been an important part of this <b>master</b> <b>s</b> <b>thesis...</b>|$|E

Technological development and innovations supported by the government triggered an unexpected and in its way unique boom, which significantly strengthened the U. <b>S.</b> economy. The <b>thesis</b> examines impact of oil crises on the U. S. energy policy, history of unconventional gas and oil extraction, and the federal involvement in energy R&D programs. Energy independence is analyzed in terms of three fundamental pillars (reducing the amount of imported oil, reducing the energy intensity of economy and increasing energy self-sufficiency). All of the models, schemes and calculations cover a period of 1973 - 2013. Two indicators [...] improving self-sufficiency and decreasing energy intensity of the economy [...] speak in favor of achievable energy independence. However, deficient energy balance suggests otherwise. In case the need to fill the gap between energy production and consumption by foreign oil imports (which have been at their historically highest values since the 1990 s) remains, then a complete energy independence as well as security is just an illusion...|$|R

The concept of the bridge is inspired by Egg-Graben-Brücke in Austria, which was designed and built without steel reinforcement in the bridge deck. The total length of the bridge is 73 meters and it is divided into 3 spans. The cross-section of the bridge is assumed as a massive T-beam/slab with flanges. The width of the cross-section with edge beams is 9, 5 meters and the height is 1, 3 meters. The bridge is planned to be built in 4 stages and a proposed building process is presented. The bridge is post-tensioned in longitudinal and transverse direction. Due to the high maintenance costs of bridges, the bridge is designed to use as little steel reinforcement as possible to enhance the durability. The number of prestressing tendons have been determined. The design is according to established standards such as Eurocodes, and Handbook N 400 by Statens vegvesen. Analytical models have been created in the program NovaFrame for longitudinal direction and some parts in the program Scia Engineer for transverse direction.
