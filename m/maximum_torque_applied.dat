40|$|This paper aims at {{planning}} an optimal {{point to point}} path for a flexible manipulator under large deformation. For this purpose, the researchers use a direct method and meta-heuristic optimization process. In this paper, the maximum load carried by the manipulator and the minimum transmission time are taken as objective functions of the optimization process to get optimal path profiles. Kinematic constraints, the maximum velocity and acceleration, the dynamic constraint of the <b>maximum</b> <b>torque</b> <b>applied</b> to the arms and also the constraint of final point accuracy are discussed. For the optimization process, the Harmony Search (HS) method is used. To {{evaluate the effectiveness of}} the approach proposed, simulation studies are reviewed by considering a two-link flexible manipulator with the fixed base. The findings indicate that the proposed method is in power of dealing with nonlinear dynamics of the system. Furthermore, the results obtained by rigid, small and large deformation models are compared with each other...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: A {{method was}} {{developed}} for measuring the rotatory laxity of fresh knee-joint specimens by automatic cyclic rotation. Twenty-seven cadaver specimens were studied at an angle of 25 degrees of fiexion. Primary laxity {{was defined as the}} rotation for a low torque of ± S kilograms force-centimeter Secondary laxity was the additional rotation at the extremes of motion at the <b>maximum</b> <b>torque</b> <b>applied.</b> There was a wide variation in laxity among different knees, with no discernible correlation with age, sex, race, or body build The menisci played a part in controlling laxity, particularly in the primary laxity phase at high torque. The collateral liga-ments were twice as effective as the cruciate ligaments in controlling rotatory laxity. Axial load on the knee greatly reduced rotatory laxity. A 100 -kilogram load reduced rotation to 20 per cent of that at zero axial load. Rotatory stability of the knee joint is provided primarily by the ligamentous and capsular structures and by the geometry of the condyles, with muscle activity also playing some part. Passive rotatory laxity in different individuals can show wide variation, and {{it is not possible to}} define a normal pattern in terms of race, sex, age, or body build ‘. In...|$|E
40|$|The 6 -Pack Container Pallet is a space-frame structure, {{designed}} by Mason & Hanger Corp. to hold six AL-R 8 containers {{together in a}} convenient bundle. The AL-R 8 containers hold nuclear weapon components that require special care and consideration. The {{primary purpose of the}} 6 -pack assembly is storage, but there is some manipulation as the 6 -pack is loaded, moved and stacked. Recently, there has been an upgrade to a new AL-R 8 -SI container that is heavier than its predecessor was. The analysis discussed herein was conducted to ensure that the increased stresses due to the heavier containers are within design safety limits. At this time, however, there is disagreement as to what the strength requirements for the 6 -pack pallet are. Depending on which classification applies to the structure, a factor of safety (yield stress over design stress) of 3. 0 or more may need to be satisfied. This report documents strength analyses of loaded 6 -packs performed at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL). The entire 6 -pack assembly was discretized into a mesh with a total of 38682 first-order finite elements. The stresses were found for four characteristic load cases using the implicit code NIKE 3 D. This was a static strength analysis only. Dynamic loading was not considered. Stability, also, was not addressed. There are two 6 -pack pallet designs under consideration: one that uses 1 / 2 inch diameter bolts and one with 3 / 8 inch bolts. In both cases, the <b>maximum</b> <b>torque</b> <b>applied</b> to the bolts is 55 in-lbf. This analysis finds the minimum factor of safety based on yield to be less than 3. 0 in the main load path of both the 1 / 2 inch and 3 / 8 inch diameter bolt designs. In general, the peak stresses found in the 1 / 2 inch bolt design are less than those of the 3 / 8 inch bolt design. At the welded ends of the main tube section that spans the length of the pallet, the minimum safety factor is 2. 14 when 1 / 2 inch bolts are used and 1. 77 when 3 / 8 inch bolts are used. Minimum safety factors of 1. 91 and 1. 78 were found around the bolt holes in the lateral supports in the 1 / 2 inch bolt and 3 / 8 inch bolt designs, respectively...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: To {{determine}} 1) {{the differences}} in <b>maximum</b> <b>torque</b> between 7 biodegradable and 2 titanium screw systems, and 2) the differences of <b>maximum</b> <b>torque</b> between "hand tight" and break of the biodegradable and the titanium osteofixation screw systems. Materials and Methods: Four oral and maxillofacial surgeons inserted 8 specimens of all 9 screw systems in polvmethylmethacrylate plates. The surgeons were instructed to insert the screws as they would do in the clinic (hand tight). The data were recorded by a torque measurement meter. A PhD resident inserted 8 specimens of {{the same set of}} 9 screw systems until fracture occurred. Likewise, the <b>maximum</b> <b>applied</b> <b>torque</b> was recorded. Results: 1) The mean <b>maximum</b> <b>torque</b> of the 2 titanium screw systems was significantly higher than that of the 7 biodegradable screw systems, and 2) the mean <b>maximum</b> <b>torque</b> for hand tight was significantly lower than for break in 2 biodegradable, and both titanium screw systems. Conclusions: Based on the results, we conclude that the 1. 5 nim and 2. 0 mm titanium screw systems still present the highest torqne strength compared with the biodegradable screw systems. When there is an intention to use biodegradable screws, we recommend the use of 2. 0 mm BioSorb FX (Linvatec Biomaterials Ltd, Tampere, Finland), 2. 0 mm LactoSorb (Walter Lorenz Surgical Inc, Jacksonville, FL), or the larger 2. 5 mm Inion (Inion Ltd, Tampere, Finland) screws.

40|$|The spin-down {{mechanism}} of accreting neutron stars is discussed with an application {{to one of}} the best studied X-ray pulsars GX 301 - 2. We show that the <b>maximum</b> possible spin-down <b>torque</b> <b>applied</b> to a neutron star from the accretion flow can be evaluated as K_ sd^ (t) = μ^ 2 /(r_ m r_ cor) ^ 3 / 2. The spin-down rate of the neutron star in GX 301 - 2 can be explained provided the magnetospheric radius of the neutron star is smaller than its canonical value. We calculate the magnetospheric radius considering the mass-transfer in the binary system in the frame of the magnetic accretion scenario suggested by V. F. Shvartsman. The spin-down rate of the neutron star expected within this approach is in a good agreement with that derived from observations of GX 301 - 2.

Fuzzy logic control (FLC) is design for in {{field oriented control}} (FOC) based structure associated with an induction motor (IM). FLC has ability to confront the uncertainties existing in the IFOC determined through model of IM. The type of FLC that using is Segeno fuzzy logic. The inputs of FLC are the error (e) and derivative error (de) between actual speed and reference speed. The output of FLC is the daxesstator current (ids). Membership functions are chosen based to parameter of the motor model. The speed control of IM is importance to achieve <b>maximum</b> <b>torque</b> efficiency.

40|$|The present {{invention}} {{is directed}} to a mechanical clutch which limits transmission of torque to a desired, predetermined <b>maximum</b> <b>torque</b> from a first clutch plate to a second clutch plate.

For Column 5, the torsional strength reduced rapidly after the <b>maximum</b> <b>torque</b> was achieved because the core concrete crushed and thus could not provide further torsional resistance.

40|$|In this paper, a new {{nonlinear}} {{control strategy}} is proposed for a permanent-magnet salient-pole synchronous motor, This control strategy simultaneously achieves accurate torque control and copper losses minimization without recurring {{to an internal}} current loop nor to any feedforward compensation. It {{takes advantage of the}} rotor saliency by allowing the current (i(d)) to have nonzero values. This, in turn, allows us to increase the power factor of the machine and to raise the <b>maximum</b> admissible <b>torque.</b> We <b>apply</b> input-output linearization techniques where the inputs are the stator voltages and the outputs are the torque and a judiciously chosen new output. This new output insures a well-defined relative degree and is linked to the copper losses in such a way that, when forced to zero, it leads to maximum machine efficiency. The performance of our nonlinear controller is demonstrated by a real-time implementation using a digital signal processor (DSP) chip on a permanent-magnet salient-pole synchronous motor with sinusoidal flux distribution. The results are compared to the ones obtained with a scheme which forces the i(d) current to zero...|$|R
50|$|The basic {{fundamental}} of induction generators is {{the conversion}} between mechanical energy to electrical energy. This requires an external <b>torque</b> <b>applied</b> to the rotor {{to turn it}} faster than the synchronous speed. However, indefinitely increasing torque doesn't lead to an indefinite increase in power generation. The rotating magnetic field torque excited from the armature works to counter {{the motion of the}} rotor and prevent over speed because of induced motion in the opposite direction. As the speed of the motor increases the counter torque reaches a max value of torque (breakdown torque) that it can operate until before the operating conditions become unstable. Ideally, induction generators work best in the stable region between the no-load condition and <b>maximum</b> <b>torque</b> region.|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} {{the resistance to}} fracture of rotary Ni-Ti files of various diameters and tapers after torsional stress simulation. Methods: Profile (Dentsply Maillerfer, Ballaigues, Suíça) instruments sizes 15 to 40, taper 0. 04 and 0. 06 were used. Ten instruments of each size and taper were tested, totaling 120 files. The <b>maximum</b> <b>torque</b> (Tmax) until fracture was determined {{in accordance with the}} ANSI / ADA Protocol Nº 28.

40|$|Background: Joint {{trauma and}} injury {{are the most}} common causes of dynamic {{instability}}. Dynamic instability has a great effect on the lumbar spine, due to its three-dimensional motions. The greatest amounts of compression and shearing force are imposed at the points of <b>maximum</b> <b>torque</b> and velocity. The changes in these phase angles upon bearing various loads can cause some pathologic conditions. In this study, we examined the phase angle at <b>maximum</b> <b>torque</b> and velocity in the three planes of movement and then estimated their displacement upon external loads. Methods: Using the B 200 isoinertial dynamometer, 13 subjects were tested in three stages as follows: 1) Familiarization with tests and apparatus. 2) Warm-up and three maximum isometric tests, with a rest interval between each test, in the three axes of lumbar motion including: flexion/extension, rotation to right/left, lateral flexion to the right/left. 3) Five dynamic tests in these three axes of motion without load, with 25 % <b>maximum</b> voluntary <b>torque,</b> and with 50 % <b>maximum</b> voluntary <b>torque.</b> Special software was used to analyze the raw data and detect the occurrence of <b>maximum</b> <b>torque</b> and velocity in the dynamic range of motion at each of the three axes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Results: When the load was increased, the <b>maximum</b> dynamic <b>torque</b> {{in each of the three}} axes increased (P&lt; 0. 05).
