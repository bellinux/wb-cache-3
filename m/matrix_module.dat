40|$|Industrial ecology (IE) is a {{maturing}} scientific discipline. The {{field is}} becoming more data and computation intensive, which requires IE researchers to develop scientific software to tackle novel research questions. We review {{the current state of}} software programming and use in our field and find challenges regarding transparency, reproducibility, reusability, and ease of collaboration. Our response to that problem is fourfold: First, we propose how existing general principles for the development of good scientific software could be implemented in IE and related fields. Second, we argue that collaborating on open source software could make IE research more productive and increase its quality, and we present guidelines for the development and distribution of such software. Third, we call for stricter requirements regarding general access to the source code used to produce research results and scientific claims published in the IE literature. Fourth, we describe a set of open source modules for standard IE modeling tasks that represent our first attempt at turning our recommendations into practice. We introduce a Python toolbox for IE that includes the life cycle assessment (LCA) framework Brightway 2, the ecospold 2 <b>matrix</b> <b>module</b> that parses unallocated data in ecospold format, the pySUT and pymrio modules for building and analyzing multiregion input-output models and supply and use tables, and the dynamic_stock_model class for dynamic stock modeling.

40|$|The {{swelling}} {{behavior of}} novel Dome Matrix drug delivery modules was investigated using high-resolution X-ray computed tomography studies. The technique was exploited {{to investigate the}} swelling front position and {{the conditions of the}} interacting surfaces in situ without removing the sample from the medium during swelling. Surface and volume evolution of the glassy core under the gel layer were precisely described. Within the gel formed on the glassy core there were several particles not completely dissolved or swollen, transported from the core by the stresses due to the polymer swelling. The gel portion defined as partially swollen gel was evidenced on the convex and flat surfaces of tablets, where a line of fracture in the gel could be observed near the glassy core. In addition, the presence of solid particles in the gel layer confirmed that the translocation of particles in the swellable system affected the drug and polymer gradient within the system. Key words: Drug delivery systems – Dome <b>Matrix</b> <b>module</b> – X-ray computed tomography – Controlled release – Swelling – Polymer – HPMC. In the last fifteen years there has been a significant acceleration in drug delivery research.

40|$|Hybrid {{electric}} vehicles (HEVs) and plug-in hybrid {{electric vehicles}} (PHEVs) are promising technologies {{to help reduce}} the amount of petroleum consumed for transportation. In both HEVs and PHEVs, the battery pack is a key component to enabling their fuel savings potential. The battery {{is also one of the}} most expensive components in the vehicle. One of the most significant factors impacting both the performance and life of a battery is temperature. In particular, operating a battery at elevated temperatures reduces its life. It is therefore important to design and implement effective battery thermal management systems. This paper analyzes the suitability of phase-change material (PCM) for battery thermal management in HEV and PHEV systems. A prototype PCM/ graphite <b>matrix</b> <b>module</b> (that was not fully optimized for HEV applications) was evaluated experimentally under geometric and vehicle-simulation-based drive cycles. The results were used to validate a thermal model. The model was then used to explore the benefits and limitations of PCM thermal management. This study suggests that PCM can provide a peak-temperature-limiting benefit in vehicle applications, but the overall battery thermal management solution must rely on active cooling or on limiting the battery’s power output (or both) to avoid high temperatures during continuous cycling. Ultimately, vehicle designers will need to weigh the potential increase in mass and cost associated with adding PCM to the thermal management system against the anticipated benefits: a smaller active cooling system, less need to limit battery power output in high-temperature conditions, and/or potentially reduced exposure to momentary or localized high cell temperatures...|$|E
40|$|The {{overwhelming}} {{popularity of}} PHP as a hosting platform {{has made it}} the language of choice for developers of Remote Access Trojans (RATs or web shells) and other malicious software. These shells are typically used to compromise and monetise web platforms by providing the attacker with basic remote access to the system, including _le transfer, command execution, network reconnaissance, and database connectivity. Once infected, compromised systems {{can be used to}} defraud users by hosting phishing sites, performing Distributed Denial of Service attacks, or serving as anonymous platforms for sending spam or other malfeasance. The vast majority of these threats are largely derivative, incorporating core capabilities found in more established RATs such as c 99 and r 57. Authors of malicious software routinely produce new shell variants by modifying the behaviours of these ubiquitous RATs, either to add desired functionality or to avoid detection by signature-based detection systems. Once these modified shells are eventually identified (or additional functionality is required), the process of shell adaptation begins again. The end result of this iterative process is a web of separate but related shell variants, many of which are at least partially derived from one of the more popular and influential RATs. In response to the problem outlined above, the author set out to design and implement a system capable of circumventing common obfuscation techniques and identifying derivative malware samples in a given collection. To begin with, a decoder component was developed to syntactically deobfuscate and normalise PHP code by detecting and reversing idiomatic obfuscation constructs, and to apply uniform formatting conventions to all system inputs. A unified malware analysis framework, called Viper, was then extended to create a modular similarity analysis system comprised of individual feature extraction modules, modules responsible for batch processing, a <b>matrix</b> <b>module</b> for comparing sample features, and two visualisation modules capable of generating visual representations of shell similarity. The principal conclusion of the research was that the deobfuscation performed by the decoder component prior to analysis dramatically improved the observed levels of similarity between test samples. This in turn allowed the modular similarity analysis system to identify derivative clusters (or families) within a large collection of shells more accurately. Techniques for isolating and re-rendering these clusters were also developed and demonstrated to be effective at increasing the amount of detail available for evaluating the relative magnitudes of the relationships within each cluster...|$|E

40|$|An {{offshore}} wind turbine usually has the grid step-up transformer integrated in the nacelle. This increases mechanical loading of the tower. In that context, a transformer-less, high voltage, highly-reliable and compact converter system for nacelle installation would be an attractive solution for large {{offshore wind}} turbines. This paper, therefore, presents a transformer-less grid integration topology for PMSG based large wind turbine generator systems using modular matrix converters. Each <b>matrix</b> converter <b>module</b> is fed from three generator coils of the PMSG which are phase shifted by 120 °. Outputs of <b>matrix</b> converter <b>modules</b> are connected in series to increase the output voltage and thus eliminate the need of a coupling step-up transformer. Moreover, dc-link capacitors found in conventional back-to-back converter topologies are eliminated in the proposed system. Proper multilevel output voltage generation and power sharing between converter modules are achieved through an advanced switching strategy. Simulation results are presented to validate the proposed modular matrix converter system, modulation method and control techniques. ...|$|R

R {{is said to}} be idempotence-diagonalizable if every idempotent matrix over R is similar to a diagonal matrix. For two arbitrary positive integers n and m, we characterize (a) linear maps from Mn(R) to Mm(R) preserving tripotence when R is any idempotence-diagonalizable ring with the units 2 and 3, and (b) linear maps from Mn(R) to Mm(R) preserving inverses (respectively, Drazin inverses, group inverses, { 1 }-inverses, { 2 }-inverses and { 1, 2 }-inverses) when R is either any idempotence-diagonalizable ring with the units 2 and 3, or any commutative principal ideal domain with at least one unit except for 1 and 2. These characterizations are completed by using an idempotence-preserving result obtained by Cao [Linear maps preserving idempotence on <b>matrix</b> <b>modules</b> over some rings, J. Natur. Sci.

For examining {{the extent of the}} universality, we focus on the case in which D is provided by concatenating =N/M matrices O_ 1, O_ 2, [...] ., O_ drawn uniformly according to the Haar measure on the M × M orthogonal matrices.
