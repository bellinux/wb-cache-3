5|$|The {{first time}} he cheated on me, I thought there was {{something}} wrong with <b>me</b> <b>or</b> <b>the</b> relationship, but when someone makes a habit of it, you know the problem lies with him. Yet I was foolish enough to give him a second chance because he begged and pleaded, despite the fact that everyone around me said he was still straying. I guess I really wanted to believe in him. Then I actually caught him red-handed. It took me a while to get out. But having done that, nothing can make me go back.|$|E
500|$|By late June, senior {{counter-terrorism}} official Richard Clarke and CIA director George Tenet were [...] "convinced {{that a major}} {{series of}} attacks was about to come", although the CIA believed that the attacks would likely occur in Saudi Arabia or Israel. In early July, Clarke put domestic agencies on [...] "full alert", telling them that [...] "Something really spectacular {{is going to happen}} here... soon." [...] He asked the FBI and the State Department to alert the embassies and police departments, and the Defense Department to go to [...] "Threat Condition Delta." [...] Clarke would later write that [...] "Somewhere in CIA there was information that two known al Qaeda terrorists had come into the United States... in [...] FBI there was information that strange things had been going on at flight schools in the United States... They had specific information about individual terrorists... None of that information got to <b>me</b> <b>or</b> <b>the</b> White House." ...|$|E
500|$|Attention also {{focused on}} Jaguar's {{improved}} pace during the event. Prior to the race, {{the team had}} been criticised by the media {{for their ability to}} perform well in the series with some publications criticising their move of signing Evans and Carroll to drive their cars. Evans said his improved performance encouraged everyone working for the team and it gave Jaguar more confidence: [...] "If you look at the bigger picture, I’ve got to be satisfied with today. Qualifying was great, to be honest, I topped the group. If you ask <b>me</b> <b>or</b> <b>the</b> whole team if this would have happened after Marrakesh, we would have taken it with both hands." [...] Carroll hoped he would have a strong performance in the event and be faster than he could be but it was an issue that could be improved on. Jaguar team principal James Barclay stated the improvement was [...] "a little bit of a positive surprise" [...] but was unsure if Carroll's problem {{at the start of the}} race was caused by driver error or an electrical issue but admitted his team had to improve their understanding of full course yellow in future races.|$|E

In [...] "Supermarket Secrets", Journalist Jane Moore looked at the cost consumers and animals are paying for cheap, homogenised, convenient supermarket food. Undercover video footage taken inside a chicken broiler house and an examination of the miserable lives of dairy cows reinforced how bad the conditions are for animals used for meat and milk. [...] In 2011, a Sky News report about duck farming featured undercover Hillside footage.|$|E

2500|$|Wallace {{commented on}} the storyline, [...] "Before my break I had the baby-swap storyline, and {{towards the end of}} last year , Kat was {{becoming}} very downtrodden. Now she's back on the scene fighting fit—it's almost like when Kat first showed up in 2000. She's come back with those feisty, tarty, funny and slightly cold sides she had. It's actually a new Kat!" [...] She later told Inside Soap that the storyline was [...] "really exciting", calling it [...] "cleverly written so no one knows who Kat's secret lover is—not even <b>me</b> <b>or</b> <b>the</b> mystery man himself. I love coming into work every day and discovering even more brilliant twists to the plot!" [...] She added, [...] "Everyone is going to love the excitement of the storyline. The scriptwriters have been brilliant at putting everyone in the frame. I can't wait to find out who it is!", and said that Kat loves being the centre of attention when she charms each of the suspects to join the football team, especially as her marriage to Alfie has lost its spark. She said that [...] "Alfie has always loved Kat's sexy side, so he doesn't see any harm in [...] It's just that Kat doesn't think he has the same interest in her that he used to. Alfie just seems content with domestic life, and the passion has gone." [...] Speaking of Kat's motivation for the affair, Wallace told Inside Soap that [...] "Kat feels deflated, as [...] haven't had much alone time lately, but her mood is soon lifted when she hears the football lads chanting her name and goes back down to the bar. Later, she's cleaning in the kitchen when someone walks in. At first she thinks it's Alfie, but she's surprised to see it's one of the other team members. She invites him in—and one thing leads to another..." ...|$|E
