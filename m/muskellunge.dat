5|$|While loss {{of habitat}} has {{affected}} native {{animals such as}} the pine marten, elk, woodland caribou, and bison, others like whitetail deer and bobcat thrive. The state has the nation's largest population of timber wolves outside Alaska, and supports healthy populations of black bears, moose, and gophers. Located on the Mississippi Flyway, Minnesota hosts migratory waterfowl such as geese and ducks, and game birds such as grouse, pheasants, and turkeys. It is home to birds of prey, including {{the largest number of}} breeding pairs of bald eagles in the lower 48 states as of 2007, red-tailed hawks, and snowy owls. The lakes teem with sport fish such as walleye, bass, <b>muskellunge,</b> and northern pike, and streams in the southeast and northeast are populated by brook, brown, and rainbow trout.|$|E
25|$|A hybrid between {{northern}} pike and <b>muskellunge</b> {{is known as}} a tiger <b>muskellunge</b> (Esox masquinongy × lucius or Esox lucius × masquinongy, depending on the sex of each of the contributing species). In the hybrids, the males are invariably sterile, while females are often fertile, and may back-cross with the parent species. Another form of {{northern pike}}, the silver pike, is not a subspecies but rather a mutation that occurs in scattered populations. Silver pike, sometimes called silver <b>muskellunge,</b> lack the rows of spots and appear silver, white, or silvery-blue in color. When ill, silver pike have been known to display a somewhat purplish hue; long illness is also {{the most common cause of}} male sterility.|$|E

25|$|Both {{species of}} crappie as adults feed {{predominantly}} on smaller fish species, including the young {{of their own}} predators (which include the northern pike, <b>muskellunge,</b> and walleye). They have diverse diets, however, including zooplankton, insects, and crustaceans.

500|$|Although {{there are}} no {{pollution}} point sources in the drainage basin, acid rain is a major concern.

Fish which are acid tolerant are predominant, including fathead minnow, <b>muskellunge,</b> pumpkinseed, walleye, and yellow perch. There are relatively few predators like chain pickerel and largemouth bass, and adult fish [...] "appear to have good growth rates but poor reproductive success".|$|E
500|$|Lake Jean {{is home to}} brook trout, brown trout, brown bullhead, {{and yellow}} bullhead. Acid rain with a pH near 3.0 has altered {{the ecology of the}} lakes and region; in Lake Jean low pH has {{decreased}} the number and quality of insects and plankton {{at the base of the}} food chain. Fish which are acid tolerant are predominant, including fathead minnows, <b>muskellunge,</b> pumpkinseed, walleye, and yellow perch. Predators like chain pickerel and largemouth bass are relatively few in number, and adult fish appear to grow rapidly but breed comparatively poorly.
