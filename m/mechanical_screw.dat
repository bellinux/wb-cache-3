50|$|There {{had been}} upright grand pianos {{as well as}} upright harpsichords, the {{horizontal}} instrument being turned up on its wider end and a keyboard and action adapted to it. William Southwell, an Irish piano-maker, had in 1798 tried a similar experiment with a square piano, to be repeated in later years by William Frederick Collard of London; but Hawkins {{was the first to}} make a piano, or pianino, with the strings descending to the floor, the keyboard being raised. His instrument was in a complete iron frame, independent of the case; and in this frame, strengthened by a system of iron resistance rods combined with an iron upper bridge, his sound-board was entirely suspended. An apparatus for tuning by <b>mechanical</b> <b>screws</b> regulated the tension of the strings, which were of equal length throughout. The action, in metal supports, anticipated Robert Wornum's in the checking, and later ideas in a contrivance for repetition. This bundle of inventions was brought to London and exhibited by Hawkins himself; but the instrument was poor in tone.|$|R

The objectives of the structural static test were to assess the strength and stiffness parameters of the blade for the critical wind load case, to experimentally determine the deflections and strains at critical locations and finally to validate the design. Though the blade was designed for class III, as defined by Germanischer Lloyd (GL), the blade was tested for a load case corresponding to a wind velocity of 25 m/s; since this is the maximum wind velocity measured in the installation site over last 25 years. A rig was designed using tubular truss members to withstand the moments produced by the thrust load and the gravity load. The blade was mounted on the test rig using T-bolt {{in the same way}} it is attached the hub. The gust load on the entire blade was applied as four discrete concentrated loads.

A maximum deflection of 685 mm was measured at the blade tip and a maximum compressive strain of - 787 µs was measured on the suction surface of the blade at a distance of 12500 mm from blade root.

50|$|The {{advent of}} the CNC lathe (or more properly, CNC turning center) has blurred these {{distinct}} levels of production to some extent. The CNC turning center most appropriately fits in the mid-range of production, replacing the turret lathe. However, it is often possible to produce a single component with a CNC turning center more quickly than {{can be done with}} an engine lathe. To some extent too, the CNC turning center has stepped into the region traditionally occupied by the (<b>mechanical)</b> <b>screw</b> machine. CNC screw machines do this to an even greater degree, but they are expensive. In some cases they are vital, yet in others a mechanical machine can match or beat overall performance and profitability. It is not unusual for cam-op automatic lathes to beat CNCs on cycle time. CNC offers many benefits, not least CAD/CAM integration, but the CNC itself usually does not give any inherent speed advantage within the context of an automatic lathe cycle in terms of speeds and feeds or tool-changing speed. There are many variables involved in answering the question of which is best for a particular part at a particular company. (Overhead is part of the calculation—not least because most cam-op machines are long since paid for, whereas a late-model CNC machine has hefty monthly payments). Businesses relying on cam-op machines are still competing even in today's CNC-filled environment; they just need to be vigilant and smart about keeping it that way.|$|E

For the evaluation of <b>mechanical</b> properties, the <b>screws</b> for RME were adjusted using the same maxillary dental model. An Instron 3365 testing machine with a load cell of 5 kN recorded the forces released by the screws at different amounts of activation (1, 5, 10, 15 and 20 quarters of a turn). Each type of screw was tested 10 times. Comparisons between the forces released by the different types of screws at different amounts of activation were carried out by means of analysis of Kruskal-Wallis test with post-hoc test di Tukey (P < 0. 05). Results: The results of this study showed that all 3 expansion devices were able to develop forces that could produce a separation of the palatine processes. The Hyrax and A 2620 expanders developed force values over 20 kg and the Palatal Split screws about 16 kg.

This new method performed on one insulator model is based on the electro-geometrical characteristics (AC flashover voltage versus leakage distance). The tested materials cover thermoplastics, (namely polyamide 6 (PA 6 / 50), fireproofed polyamide 66 (PA 66 / 50), polycarbonate (PC/ 40) and polyarylamide (PARA/ 50)) thermosetting (namely two cycloaliphatic epoxy resins (EP 1 and EP 2)) and elastomers (namely two EPDM materials noted EPDM and EPDM V 0 (fireproofed)). Polluted environments such as clean (light) and salt (heavy) fogs have been created to assess the resistance of polymers to partial discharges (erosion and tracking). Results regarding the flashover voltage (FOV) show a significant reduction in the presence of clean fog equal to 50 % of the value measured in dry conditions for all polymers. This decrease is more pronounced in salt fog (- 80 % reduction of FOV). Surface degradations suggest that epoxy resins and EPDM elastomers are subjected to fewer damages in salt fog when being compared to thermoplastics. It is established that epoxy resins behave better than EPDM elastomers against discharges.
