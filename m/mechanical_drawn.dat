This classroom action research was conducted in SMK St. Mikael Surakarta. Grade XI was assigned to be subject of this research. Two collaborators were assigned to  back  up and  assist  the researchers  to  monitor  the  effects  of  action  on student competency  in mechanical  drawing.  The changes due  to  the  action  are  monitored through  observation  by  involving  the  two  collaborators.  The  collected  data  was analyzed  descriptively. The  data  analysis  resulted  in  the following   findings:    (a) production  based learning  improves students achievement  in reaching  the minimum mastery  criteria  on  Mechanical  Drawing  and  more  specifically  improves  student competency  in producing  machining industries standardized  of <b>Mechanical</b>  Working <b>Drawing,</b> (b) a process of expertise acquition in <b>mechanical</b> working <b>drawing</b> through combination of constructivism learning principles, behaviorism, situated learning and cognitive apprenticeship [...] (c) the production-based  learning increases students' ability behave discipline and attitude toward <b>mechanical</b> <b>drawing,</b> and  (d) production based learning   was implemented through classroom discussion on the <b>mechanical</b> <b>drawing</b> principles, its implementation on working drawings, integrating knowledge on components stradard as well as production process into working drawing.

30|$|In this study, highly {{oriented}} all-cellulose composite {{films were}} successfully prepared by <b>mechanical</b> <b>drawing</b> of water-swollen cellulose nanofibril/regenerated cellulose composite film, and their mechanical properties were investigated by tensile tests. Cellulose nanofibrils with a uniform width of ~ 3  nm {{and length of}} the order of a few micrometers were prepared via 2, 2, 6, 6 -tetramethylpiperidine- 1 -oxyl-mediated oxidation of wood pulp and successive mechanical treatment. The nanofibrils were then dispersed in a cotton/lithium chloride/N, N-dimethylacetamide solution, and all-cellulose composite films were prepared by regenerating the cotton cellulose. The cellulose nanofibrils were individually dispersed and successfully oriented in the film by <b>mechanical</b> <b>drawing,</b> and the orientation parameter of the nanofibrils was as high as 0.80 for a draw ratio of 2.0. Although the Young’s modulus and tensile strength of the films were significantly improved by the <b>mechanical</b> <b>drawing,</b> the reinforcing effect by the oriented cellulose nanofibrils in the present all-cellulose composite were not clear, presumably because the cellulose nanofibrils are less compatible with the cellulose matrix in this study.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: "No paper-drawing " is the {{important}} process of informatization of manufacturing industry, which has greatly impacted the teaching of traditional <b>mechanical</b> <b>drawing.</b> In order {{to adapt to the}} demand of development of current manufacturing industry for drawing recognition ability of the talents, the structure of <b>mechanical</b> <b>drawing</b> course must correspond to this demand and perform fundamental reform; through long-term teaching practice, put drafting teaching into the whole production chain of product design and manufacturing so as to form the course form mainly based on three-dimensional expression and supported with two-dimensional expression, thus enabling the structure of <b>mechanical</b> <b>drawing</b> course to fit the development of modern manufacturing industry. The students cultivated under this mode can meet the requirements of manufacturing industry for drawing recognition ability. 0.
