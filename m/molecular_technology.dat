50|$|English {{molecular}} biologist {{who was a}} founder of applying <b>molecular</b> <b>technology</b> to farm animals. His PhD was on Satellite DNA at the Medical Research Council Unit, in Edinburgh. From there he joined John Bishop’s team at the Institute of Genetics, at Edinburgh University, where he carried out research into the genes in the liver of mice. In 1985 he {{was appointed to the}} Animal Breeding Research Organisation (subsequently the Roslin Institute) where he began work in genetic modification to produce a sheep giving milk with human proteins. He was successful within five years. Tracy, born in 1990, was the first sheep to produce large quantities of human protein, making 35g of the alpha-1-antitrypsin (used in treatment of cystic fibrosis) in each litre of her milk. During the 1990s, Clark continued to develop transgenic techniques on large animals. With his colleagues, he produced a sheep from which a prion protein gene had been removed, the first time this had been achieved in a large animal. Clark's work set the stage for Ian Wilmut's team at Roslin to clone a sheep, Dolly (1996), the result of transplanted DNA of an adult sheep to an unfertilized egg cell. He was appointed an OBE in 1997 for his contribution to Science.|$|E

At Carus Chemicals, he was responsible for generating catalyst formulation process, and developed patents for ozone decomposition catalyst and powder coating techniques. Rajadurai directed <b>Molecular</b> <b>Technology</b> Corporation(MOTEC) catalyst development, reactor designs, and analytical procedures - resulting in solutions for nitrogen oxide(NOx) reduction systems applied in diesel and natural gas operated engines. As a Research Leader of Cummins from 1990 to 1995, Rajadurai developed catalytic aftertreatment systems for diesel engines and was responsible for management of industrial-university catalytic research programs around the United States to investigate quantum chemical modeling for catalyst prediction and microwave-generated free radical injections for nitrogen oxide reduction. While at Tenneco, he established computational simulation for exhaust after treatment system development for the commercial, heavy duty specialty and global emerging markets. His responsibility included North American manufacturing of the ultra thinwall substrate catalytic converter working with Corning Inc. and NGK. While an executive at ArvinMeritor, Rajadurai directed the technology road map, annual operating plan and business strategy. Rajadurai was Vice President of ACS Industries from 2004 to 2009, in-charge of the strategic planning for product and technology development of wire mesh catalyst infrastructure.
