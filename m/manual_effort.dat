They did not have the vibration, smell, and noise associated with gasoline cars. They also did not require gear changes. (While steam-powered cars also had no gear shifting, they suffered from long start-up times of up to 45 minutes on cold mornings.) The cars were also preferred because they did not require a <b>manual</b> <b>effort</b> to start, as did gasoline cars which featured a hand crank to start the engine.|$|E

After his discharge, he married [...] Martha Cook on January 13, 1950. Stephen Ray Vaughan was born on October 3, 1954, in Dallas, Texas; he was three-and-a-half years younger than his brother Jimmie (born 1951). Big Jim secured a job as an {{asbestos}} worker, an occupation that involved rigorous <b>manual</b> <b>effort.</b> The family moved frequently, living in other states such as Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Oklahoma before ultimately moving to the Oak Cliff section of Dallas. A shy and insecure boy, Vaughan was deeply affected by his childhood experiences. His father struggled with alcohol abuse, and often terrorised his family and friends with his bad temper. In later years, Vaughan recalled that he had been a victim of his father's violence. His father died on August 27, 1986, exactly four years before Vaughan's own death ...|$|E

40|$|A {{large amount}} of {{real-world}} data is required to train and benchmark any character recognition algo-rithm. Developing a page-level ground-truth database for this purpose is overwhelmingly laborious, as it in-volves a lot of <b>manual</b> <b>efforts</b> to produce a reason-able database that covers all possible words of a lan-guage. Moreover, generating such a database for his-torical (degraded) documents or for a cursive script like Urdu 1 is even more complex and grueling. The pre-sented work attempts {{to solve this problem}} by propos-ing a semi-automated technique for generating ground-truth database. It is believed that the proposed automa-tion will greatly reduce the <b>manual</b> <b>efforts</b> for devel-oping any OCR database. The basic idea is to apply ligature-clustering prior to manual labeling.

30|$|However, the {{sensitivity}} of data is often subjective. Deciding whether a piece of data is sensitive subjects to users’ preference and the application context. User’s privacy preference may also change overtime.

Since the resulting fault tolerance semantics often crosscut the middleware architecture, GRAFT uses aspect-oriented programming to weave them into the original fabric of the general-purpose middleware. We evaluate the capabilities of GRAFT using a representative case study...|$|R
