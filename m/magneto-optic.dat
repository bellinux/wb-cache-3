2500|$|The {{motion of}} a charged {{body in a}} {{magnetic}} field, B involves the velocity through the Lorentz force term v'B, and might seem at first to be asymmetric under T. A closer look assures us that B also changes sign under time reversal. This happens because a magnetic field is produced by an electric current, J, which reverses sign under T. Thus, the motion of classical charged particles in electromagnetic fields is also time reversal invariant. [...] (Despite this, it is still useful to consider the time-reversal non-invariance in a local sense when the external field is held fixed, as when the <b>magneto-optic</b> effect is analyzed. [...] This allows one to analyze {{the conditions under which}} optical phenomena that locally break time-reversal, such as Faraday isolators and , can occur.) [...] The laws of gravity also seem to be time reversal invariant in classical mechanics.|$|E
2500|$|Tyndall's early {{original}} work in physics was his experiments on magnetism and diamagnetic polarity, {{on which he}} worked from 1850 to 1856. His two most influential reports were the first two, co-authored with Knoblauch. One of them was entitled [...] "The <b>magneto-optic</b> properties of crystals, and the relation of magnetism and diamagnetism to molecular arrangement", dated May 1850. The two described an inspired experiment, with an inspired interpretation. These and other magnetic investigations very soon made Tyndall known among the leading scientists of the day. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1852. In his search for a suitable research appointment, {{he was able to}} ask the longtime editor of the leading German physics journal (Poggendorff) and other prominent men to write testimonials on his behalf. In 1853, he attained the prestigious appointment of Professor of Natural Philosophy (Physics) at the Royal Institution in London, due in no small part to the esteem his work had garnered from Michael Faraday, the leader of magnetic investigations at the Royal Institution. About a decade later Tyndall was appointed the successor to the positions held by Michael Faraday at the Royal Institution on Faraday's retirement.|$|E

[...] Some hardware compatible with Red Book CDs may have difficulty reading CD-Rs and, because of their lower reflectivity, especially CD-RWs. [...] To the extent that CD hardware can read extended-length discs or CD-RW discs, it is because that hardware has capability beyond the minimum required by the Red Book and Yellow Book standards (the hardware is more capable than it needs to be to bear the Compact Disc logo).|$|E

40|$|When {{reducing}} {{the size and}} separation of magnetic array elements to the nanoscale, long range magnetostatic interactions might become decisive in the magnetic performance. At element separation distances below a critical threshold both the element and the array shape {{must be taken into}} account. Previous works 1, 2, 3 have shown experimentally that the magnetic response (measured by <b>Magneto-Optics)</b> of small magnetic elements stacked into arrays depends on array parameters and that below a interaction threshold even the individual element magnetization reversal mechanism might change. Furthermore, by changing suitably the array shape within the interaction range magnetic anisotropies can be induced. This can be termed lattice shape anisotropies, to be considered in addition to conventional element shape anisotropies. Figure 1 shows how an array of Co elements (40 nm thickness) recovers, as seen in the remanence vs angle dependence, the intrinsic material uniaxial anisotropy for interelement separation distances of 200 nm.

Exciton-polaritons are hybrid light-matter quasiparticles formed by strongly interacting photons and excitons (electron-hole pairs) in semiconductor microcavities. They have emerged as a robust solid-state platform for next-generation optoelectronic applications as well as for fundamental studies of quantum many-body physics. Importantly, exciton-polaritons are a profoundly open (that is, non-Hermitian) quantum system, which requires constant pumping of energy and continuously decays, releasing coherent radiation. Thus, the exciton-polaritons always exist in a balanced potential landscape of gain and loss. However, the inherent non-Hermitian nature of this potential has so far been largely ignored in exciton-polariton physics. Here we demonstrate that non-Hermiticity dramatically modifies the structure of modes and spectral degeneracies in exciton-polariton systems, and, therefore, will affect their quantum transport, localization and dynamical properties. Using a spatially structured optical pump, we create a chaotic exciton-polariton billiard-a two-dimensional area enclosed by a curved potential barrier. Eigenmodes of this billiard exhibit multiple non-Hermitian spectral degeneracies, known as exceptional points. Such points can cause remarkable wave phenomena, such as unidirectional transport, anomalous lasing/absorption and chiral modes. By varying parameters of the billiard, we observe crossing and anti-crossing of energy levels and reveal the non-trivial topological modal structure exclusive to non-Hermitian systems. We also observe mode switching and a topological Berry phase for a parameter loop encircling the exceptional point. Our findings pave the way to studies of non-Hermitian quantum dynamics of exciton-polaritons, which may uncover novel operating principles for polariton-based devices. PostprintPeer reviewe...|$|R
