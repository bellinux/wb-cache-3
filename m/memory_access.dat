5|$|Computer {{architectures}} {{in which}} each element of main memory can be accessed with equal latency and bandwidth are known as uniform <b>memory</b> <b>access</b> (UMA) systems. Typically, {{that can be achieved}} only by a shared memory system, in which the memory is not physically distributed. A system that does not have this property is known as a non-uniform <b>memory</b> <b>access</b> (NUMA) architecture. Distributed memory systems have non-uniform <b>memory</b> <b>access.</b>|$|E

Compared with standard SNES games, the additional microprocessor allows higher clock speeds; faster access to the random-access memory (RAM); greater memory mapping capabilities, data storage, and compression; new direct <b>memory</b> <b>access</b> (DMA) modes, such as bitmap to bit plane transfer; and built-in CIC lockout for piracy protection and regional marketing control.|$|E
5|$|These {{and other}} {{differences}} reflect the differing design {{goals of the}} two buses: USB was designed for simplicity and low cost, while FireWire was designed for high performance, particularly in time-sensitive applications such as audio and video. Although similar in theoretical maximum transfer rate, FireWire400 is faster than USB2.0 high-bandwidth in real-use, especially in high-bandwidth use such as external hard drives. The newer FireWire800 standard is {{twice as fast as}} FireWire400 and faster than USB2.0 high-bandwidth both theoretically and practically. However, FireWire's speed advantages rely on low-level techniques such as direct <b>memory</b> <b>access</b> (DMA), which in turn have created opportunities for security exploits such as the DMA attack.|$|E
50|$|Most modern CPUs reorder <b>memory</b> <b>accesses</b> {{to improve}} {{execution}} efficiency (see memory ordering for types of reordering allowed). Such processors invariably give {{some way to}} force ordering in a stream of <b>memory</b> <b>accesses,</b> typically through a memory barrier instruction. Implementation of Peterson's and related algorithms on processors which reorder <b>memory</b> <b>accesses</b> generally requires use of such operations to work correctly to keep sequential operations from happening in an incorrect order. Note that reordering of <b>memory</b> <b>accesses</b> can happen even on processors that don't reorder instructions (such as the PowerPC processor in the Xbox 360).|$|R

25|$|Although {{this meant}} fewer clock cycles per instruction, {{compared}} to the Z80 for instance, the latter's higher resolution state machine allowed clock frequencies 3-5 times as high without demanding faster memory chips, which was often the limiting factor. This is because the Z80 combines two full (but short) clock cycles into a relatively long <b>memory</b> <b>access</b> period {{compared to the}} clock, while the more asynchronous 6809 instead has relatively short <b>memory</b> <b>access</b> times: depending on version and speed grade, approximately 60% of a single clock cycle was typically available for <b>memory</b> <b>access</b> in a 6809 (see data sheets).|$|E

Wilson and Furber led the design. They implemented it with a similar efficiency ethos as the 6502. A key design goal was achieving low-latency input/output (interrupt) handling like the 6502. The 6502's <b>memory</b> <b>access</b> architecture had let developers produce fast machines without costly direct <b>memory</b> <b>access</b> (DMA) hardware.|$|E

40|$|A major {{challenge}} of Transactional memory implementations {{is dealing with}} <b>memory</b> <b>accesses</b> that occur outside of transactions. In previous work we showed how to specify transactional memory in terms of admissible interchanges of transaction operations, and gave proof rules for showing that an implementation satisfies its specification. However, we did not capture non-transactional <b>memory</b> <b>accesses.</b> In this work we show how to extend our previous model to handle non-transactional accesses.

25|$|The {{relatively}} small number of processors in early systems, allowed them to easily use a shared memory architecture, which allows processors to access a common pool of memory. In the early days a common approach was the use of uniform <b>memory</b> <b>access</b> (UMA), in which access time to a memory location was similar between processors. The use of non-uniform <b>memory</b> <b>access</b> (NUMA) allowed a processor to access its own local memory faster than other memory locations, while cache-only memory architectures (COMA) allowed for the local memory of each processor to be used as cache, thus requiring coordination as memory values changed.|$|E
25|$|An {{efficient}} and {{simple way to}} provide hardware support of capabilities is to delegate the MMU the responsibility of checking access-rights for every <b>memory</b> <b>access,</b> a mechanism called capability-based addressing.

40|$|The growing processor/memory {{performance}} gap causes {{the performance of}} many codes to be limited by <b>memory</b> <b>accesses.</b> If known to exist in an application, strided <b>memory</b> <b>accesses</b> forming streams can be targeted by optimizations such as prefetching, relocation, remapping, and vector loads. Undetected, {{they can be a}} significant source of memory stalls in loops. Existing stream-detection mechanisms either require special hardware, which may not gather statistics for subsequent analysis, or are limited to compile-time detection of array accesses in loops. Formally, little treatment has been accorded to the subject; the concept of locality fails to capture the existence of streams in a program's <b>memory</b> <b>accesses...</b>|$|R

40|$|Wire-exposed, {{programmable}} microarchitectures including Trips [11], Smart Memories [8], and Raw [13] {{offer an}} opportunity to schedule instruction execution and data movement explicitly. This paper proposes stream algorithms, which, along with a decoupled systolic architecture, provide an excellent match for the physical and technological constraints of single-chip tiled architectures. Stream algorithms enable programmed systolic computations for different problem sizes, without incurring the cost of <b>memory</b> <b>accesses.</b> To that end, we decouple <b>memory</b> <b>accesses</b> from computation and move the <b>memory</b> <b>accesses</b> off the critical path. By structuring computations in systolic phases, and deferring <b>memory</b> <b>accesses</b> to dedicated <b>memory</b> processors, stream algorithms can solve many regular problems with varying sizes on a constant-sized tiled array. Contrary to common sense, the compute efficiency of stream algorithms increases as we {{increase the number of}} processing elements. In particular, we show that the compute efficiency of stream algorithms can approach 100 % asymptotically, that is for large numbers of processors and appropriate problem size. ...|$|R
25|$|Though the {{predicate}} {{takes up}} {{four of the}} 32bits in an instruction code, and thus cuts down significantly on the encoding bits available for displacements in <b>memory</b> <b>access</b> instructions, it avoids branch instructions when generating code for small if statements.

25|$|When I/O {{transfer}} is complete or an error is detected, the controller communicates with the CPU through the channel using an interrupt. Since the channel has {{direct access to}} the main memory, it is also often referred to as DMA controller (where DMA stands for direct <b>memory</b> <b>access),</b> although that term is looser in definition and is often applied to non-programmable devices as well.|$|E
25|$|The <b>memory</b> <b>access</b> {{pattern of}} AI {{calculations}} differs from graphics: a more predictable but deeper dataflow, benefiting {{more from the}} ability to keep more temporary variables on-chip (e.g. in scratchpad memory rather than caches); GPUs by contrast devote silicon to efficiently dealing with highly non-linear gather-scatter addressing between texture maps and frame-buffers, and texture filtering, as is needed for their primary role in 3D rendering.|$|E
40|$|Many {{parallel}} architectures {{support a}} memory model where some <b>memory</b> <b>accesses</b> are local, and thus inexpensive, while other <b>memory</b> <b>accesses</b> are remote, and potentially quite expensive. In {{order to achieve}} good parallel performance, it is often necessary {{to reduce the number}} of remote <b>memory</b> <b>accesses.</b> This can be done by the programmer, the compiler, or a combination of both. The overall goal is to minimize the work required by the programmer, and have the compiler automate the process as much as possible. This paper reports on compiler techniques for decreasing the number of remote <b>memory</b> <b>accesses</b> using locality analysis for a parallel dialect of C called EARTHC. The locality analysis uses an algorithm inspired by type inference algorithms for fast points-to analysis.

For any k> 1, we give a simple randomized algorithm solving the approximate nearest neighbor search using k rounds of parallel <b>memory</b> <b>accesses,</b> with O(k(d) ^ 1 /k) accesses in total. We also give a more sophisticated randomized algorithm using O(k+(1 /k d) ^O(1 /k)) <b>memory</b> <b>accesses</b> in k rounds for large enough k. Both algorithms use data structures of size polynomial in n, the number of points in the database. For the lower bound, we prove an Ω(1 /k(d) ^ 1 /k) lower bound for the total number of <b>memory</b> <b>accesses</b> required by any randomized algorithm solving the approximate nearest neighbor search within k< d/ 2 d rounds of parallel <b>memory</b> <b>accesses</b> on any data structures of polynomial size. This lower bound shows that our first algorithm is asymptotically optimal for any constant round k. And our second algorithm approaches the asymptotically optimal tradeoff between rounds and <b>memory</b> <b>accesses,</b> in a sense that the lower bound of <b>memory</b> <b>accesses</b> for any k_ 1 rounds can be matched by the algorithm within k_ 2 =O(k_ 1) rounds.
