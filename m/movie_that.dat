5|$|Campy performances, cheesy special effects, and downright awful {{dialogue}} all {{contribute to}} making Jaws 3 a truly dismal experience for just about everyone.

30|$|For example, in {{the reviews}} about the <b>movies</b> <b>that</b> a user u rated {{positively}} {{it was reported}} that they have strong science fiction elements (positive sentiment), but have weak or absent (negative or neutral/absent sentiment) romance. Another user v has evaluated positively <b>movies</b> <b>that</b> have direction and photography praised in their reviews and evaluated negatively <b>movies</b> <b>that</b> contain positive critics about their suspense. Thus, the system will most likely suggest <b>movies</b> <b>that</b> relates to the preferences of those users: for user u, it will suggest science fiction movies with no aspects of romance, while for user v the suggestions will have positive direction and photography, and negative or absent suspense.|$|R

5|$|In his memoirs, Władysław Szpilman also {{compared}} {{himself to}} Crusoe and, like Fogelman, emphasized the isolation and hopelessness which characterized the Warsaw Crusoes. Szpilman's memoir {{served as a}} basis for a screenplay, written as early as 1945 by the Polish writers Jerzy Andrzejewski and Czesław Miłosz, entitled Robinson of Warsaw. The <b>movie</b> <b>that</b> was eventually filmed, Miasto Nieujarzmione ("Unyoked city"), was heavily censored by the communist authorities, and its original theme changed {{to such an extent that}} Miłosz requested his name be removed from the film's credits. The experience with the film contributed to Miłosz's disillusionment with cinema as an artistic medium.|$|E
5|$|That {{shot was}} totally and {{completely}} inspired by 'Something's Got to Give,' Marilyn Monroe's last <b>movie</b> <b>that</b> never got finished. It's {{an homage to}} her, because I've never seen anyone re-create it. So many people have emulated so many of Marilyn's classic moments, but it's just that I'm {{a big fan of}} hers, and I thought it was really pretty at night with the pool. No one could ever be as fabulous as Marilyn was, but it's in honor and homage to her.|$|E

It began serialisation in France in Cœurs Vaillants from 29 December 1935, {{and later in}} the Swiss magazine L'Écho Illustré. Alongside protagonists Tintin and Snowy, Hergé also included the detectives Thomson and Thompson in the story, who had been introduced in the previous story.

5|$|Bowerman and his athletes' {{philosophy}} and stories were documented by Kenny Moore. Moore {{wrote the book}} Bowerman and the Men of Oregon and practiced journalism, most notably for Sports Illustrated. He also was the screenwriter with Robert Towne for Without Limits, a <b>movie</b> <b>that</b> {{told the story of}} Prefontaine and Bowerman. In addition, he was also an actor in Personal Best, a movie with track and field as one of the central themes. Bowerman himself wrote several books on the sport of running including High Performance Training for Track and Field which details coaching instruction for high level competition. He also wrote a book with a cardiologist called Jogging, which detailed the medical benefits of jogging, to which many credited its exploding popularity. Bowerman's successor, Bill Dellinger, also authored a number of books regarding running, including Competitive Runner's Training Book, The Running Experience and Winning Running.|$|E
5|$|Earp's {{good friend}} William Hart {{produced}} {{and wrote the}} seven-reel epic Wild Bill Hickok released by Paramount in 1923. It was the first movie to depict Wyatt Earp and the only <b>movie</b> <b>that</b> included his character before he died in 1929. Hart played Wild Bill Hickok and Bert Lindley played Earp. The role of Earp's character in the movie was very small. He appears {{at the back of}} a crowd scene when Hickok meets some gentlemen on the city street. Bert Lindley is not listed on some descriptions of the movie and this portrayal of Earp is often overlooked. Alan Barra, author of Inventing Wyatt Earp: His Life and Many Legends, overlooked this movie in his biography. Earp served as a technical adviser on the film.|$|E

5|$|In 1989, RKO Pictures, {{which had}} {{produced}} no films while under Wesray control, was spun off yet again. Actress and Post Cereals heiress Dina Merrill and her husband, producer Ted Hartley, acquired a majority interest and merged {{the company with}} their Pavilion Communications. After a brief period as RKO/Pavilion, the business was reorganized as RKO Pictures LLC. With the inaugural RKO production under Hartley and Merrill's ownership, False Identity (1990), the company also stepped into the distribution business. In 1992, it handled the well-regarded independent production Laws of Gravity, directed by Nick Gomez. RKO's next significant release came in 1998 with Mighty Joe Young, a remake of a 1949 RKO <b>movie</b> <b>that</b> was itself something of a King Kong redux. In the early 2000s, the company was involved as a coproducer on TV movies and modestly budgeted features {{at the rate of}} about one annually. In 2003, RKO coproduced a Broadway stage version of the 1936 Astaire–Rogers vehicle Swing Time, under the title Never Gonna Dance.|$|E
5|$|Mulans {{opening weekend}} box office gross {{revenues}} were $22.8 million, {{making it the}} second-highest grossing <b>movie</b> <b>that</b> week, behind only The X-Files. It went on to gross $120 million in the U.S. and Canada combined, and $304 million worldwide, making it the second-highest grossing family film of the year, behind A Bug's Life, and the seventh-highest grossing film of the year overall. While Mulan domestically outgrossed the two Disney films which had preceded it, The Hunchback of Notre Dame and Hercules, its box office returns failed to match those of the Disney films of the early 1990s such as Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, and The Lion King. Internationally, its highest grossing releases included those in the United Kingdom ($14.6 million) and France ($10.2 million).|$|E
5|$|Spotnitz {{found that}} the main problem with {{developing}} the episode was segueing from a <b>movie</b> <b>that</b> some—but not necessarily all—viewers had seen. The writers sought to bring back characters like Gibson Praise, Diana Fowley and Jeffrey Spender who {{were not in the}} movie. In addition, the writers also wanted to bring back elements that were also seen in the movie, like the alien. Carter claims to have been thinking about what the episode would entail almost two years prior, when he was working on developing The X-Files movie. The character Sandy, who is killed in the teaser sequence, was played by the show's casting director Rick Millikan on the request of Carter. Millikan later joked that he spent most of the shoot on his cell phone casting other individuals for other X-Files episodes. One of the nuclear power plant workers is named Homer, a reference to Homer Simpson, one of the main characters from the animated Fox television series The Simpsons.|$|E
