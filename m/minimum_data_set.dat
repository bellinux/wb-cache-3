40|$|Introduction: Medical {{records are}} {{considered}} {{as an essential}} element of patient’s health care provision. Due to a rising service provision by healthcare centers, there is an increase in the medical record loads as well. It has led to a series of problems‌, such as limited physical space, records wearing and an increased need for resources. Moreover, the most important efficiency of records, which is their application in clinical research, is questioned. In the present study, researchers have presented a model of <b>minimum</b> <b>data</b> <b>sets</b> which helps to index and electronically archive hard-copy records according to the selected data and metadata. Method: This study was an applied research type, conducted in three stages in 2013 via modified Delphi technique. Target population consisted of specialists working in hospitals. As the sample, 8 physicians who were specialists or subspecialists participated in interviews and filled out checklist surveys. The collected data were later analyzed using Excel 2013. Results: The results show that data elements such as “final diagnosis” and “operations and others” were the most common items considered by the physicians in clinical follow up, and most common medical records was “operation’s repots”. Finding significant correlation among physician’s research questions was not possible due to large variety of subjects. Conclusion: The researchers presented a framework of <b>minimum</b> <b>data</b> <b>sets</b> for a purposive archiving of records for clinical and research-based applications. This framework can act as the applied goal setting of the retrieval model based on physicians’ clinical requirements in their medical follow-ups.

Additionally, if data is to be interoperable between CC databases, and beyond, common formats for data processing operations and network-access tools suitable for most of the CCs, are essential to facilitate knowledge generation. Similarly, shared data standards should be used for all the common types of data in CC databases. This should be accompanied by uniform principles of operation and informative SOPs.|$|R

50|$|The National <b>Minimum</b> <b>Data</b> <b>Set</b> for Social Care (NMDS-SC) gathers {{information}} about the social care workforce to help employers with workforce planning in England. It also provides sector wide workforce intelligence to support strategic planning in the wider social care sector.

The aim of the NMDS-SC is to provide workforce intelligence relied upon by government, strategic bodies, employers and individuals to make decisions that will improve outcomes for people who use services. The NMDS-SC was developed from 2003 to 2005 by Dr Francis Ward (Kings College London) who conceived the idea and managed it to fruition as Head of Skills Research & Intelligence at Skills for Care working {{in partnership with the}} Department of Health, the Department for Education & Skills (now the Department for Children, Schools and Families), the General Social Care Council (GSCC), the Commission for Social Care Inspection (CSCI), the Social Care Institute for Excellence (SCIE), National Health Service (NHS) National Workforce Projects, the Local Government Association (LGA), the Learning & Skills Council (LSC) and other key stakeholders.|$|E

The Society’s audit group established a <b>minimum</b> <b>data</b> <b>set</b> for cleft audit and has funded audit and research workshops. In 1989, the Craniofacial Society Anomalies Register (CARE) was developed to record the births of children with craniofacial anomalies. The Society funded a multi disciplinary committee to oversee CARE, which became the Craniofacial Anomalies Network (CRANE) and {{is located in the}} Clinical Effectiveness Unit at the Royal College of Surgeons of England. The Society has provided research grants and provided funding to assist members in attending its conferences and international meetings. The CFSGBI has also funded training initiatives for speech and language therapists and cleft nurse specialists. In 1996 the Society was asked to provide written evidence to the Clinical Standards Advisory Group (CSAG). The submission highlighted the interdisciplinary nature of the Society and its role in acting as the forum for the presentation and evaluation of research and audit in the field. The Society is now represented in various National Health Service bodies and is consulted for advice by the government and the media. In 1999, the society became a founder member of the Healing Foundation with representation on its board of trustees and research council. This has ultimately led to the Cleft Collective, the world’s largest cleft lip and palate research programme as well as other initiatives.|$|E

40|$|Despite {{its great}} {{relevance}} {{as an indicator}} of change in soil quality conditions, 137 Cs redistribution has not been widely suggested for inclusion in <b>minimum</b> <b>data</b> <b>sets</b> for soil quality evaluations. In part, this is due to a perception that its high variability precludes its use. 137 Cs typically has a coefficient of variation of about 20 % in the reference sites used to estimate redistribution in disturbed landscapes. Recent studies on changes in soil quality indicators (including 137 Cs) in Saskatchewan, Canada and northeastern Ghana indicate that the variability associated with 137 Cs in both reference and cultivated sites is very comparable to that for other, commonly measured indicators of soil quality such as organic carbon and soil nitrogen. The sampling requirements for 137 Cs are very similar to these other properties (i. e., 15 - 30 samples per sites are required for accurate estimates of central tendency) and hence its variability should not preclude its adoption as a soil quality indicator...|$|R
