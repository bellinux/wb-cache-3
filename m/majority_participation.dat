By assessing {{the extent to which}} employees participate in ESOs and the quality of their decision-making, the authors provide a clearer and more nuanced picture of this relationship with productivity. On the one hand, results show that stock plans seem to need other forms of employee involvement and “voice” in the firm to be effective, especially when there is minority participation in the ESO plan. On the other hand, results indicate that a <b>majority</b> <b>participation</b> in the plan has an independent effect on productivity.

40|$|Resumen El artículo celebra los 50 años del Vaticano II a partir de sus luces y desafíos. Entre los innumerables motivos para celebrar se destaca el cambio de la perspectiva eclesial, de una Iglesia centrada en sí misma a una Iglesia capaz de observar y nombrar las realidades del mundo, abierta a la comprensión de la historia como el lugar de la revelación divina. También hace memoria de otras “luces” conciliares, relativas a la opción por los pobres, al laicado, a la vida religiosa, a la liturgia. Frente a los vientos de la involución que azotan {{actualmente}} a la Iglesia, la reflexión indica desafíos que sigan plasmando el espíritu del Vaticano II: la exigencia de la conversión constante, la solidaridad para con los pueblos excluidos, la participación igualitaria de la mujer en la comunidad eclesial, la mayoridad del laicado, el diálogo ecuménico e inter-religioso, el diálogo con la “pos-modernidad”, la abertura al desarrollo científico, a la interdisciplinaridad, a la colaboración entre los diferentes estratos sociales y al mundo plural. Palabras-clave :  Iglesia. Vaticano II. Memoria. Desafíos.   Abstract The article {{celebrates the}} 50 th anniversary of Vatican II: its achievements and challenges. Among the reasons to celebrate, the article highlights the changes verified within the ecclesial perspective: the turning from a self-centered church {{to a church}} able to see and name {{the realities of the}} world and open to understand history as the place of divine revelation. The article also presents other contributions of the Council regarding the option for the poor people and other issue such as the laity, the religious life and the liturgy. Facing the winds of involution currently present in the Church, this article shows some challenges actually faced by Vatican II: the requirement of constant conversion, solidarity with the excluded peoples, equal participation of women in the church community, the <b>majority</b> <b>participation</b> of the laity, the ecumenical and interreligious dialogue  with the "post-modernity". Finally, the text shows other challenges: the opening to the scientific development, the interdisciplinary vision {{of the world and the}} collaboration between different social classes in a pluralistic world.

40|$|A {{significant}} number of businesses operating in South Africa can be categorised as familyowned businesses and contribute substantially to employment creation, poverty eradication and wealth creation. Nonetheless, their longevity through generations remains a major cause for concern for all stakeholders. South African economy is characterised by a history of apartheid, where prior to 1994, the black majority only owned less than 5 percent of the businesses active in the economy. Since then, black <b>majority</b> <b>participation</b> in the economy has increased driven by the Black Economic Empowerment (BEE) legislation. Therefore, {{the aim of this}} study is to understand the influence of the incumbent, the successor, the family and the business, on management succession within black family-owned businesses in South Africa. The study followed an exploratory qualitative approach, using semi-structured interviews. Thirteen black family-owned business incumbents were interviewed with a view to answer the research questions. From the literature, 17 of the most widespread factors that influence management succession in family businesses were derived and formed the basis of the constructs or themes adopted during data analysis. All the interviews were recorded and then transcribed into text. A directed content analysis using ATLAS-ti was used to analyse the data, while constant comparative analysis using a meta-matrix was used to establish common themes to specific groups of respondents. The key findings showed that incumbent of black family-owned business regard the successor and incumbent-related factors as the predominant drivers of management succession. Commitment and interest of the successor towards the business and the quality of the relationship between the incumbent and the successor have a strong influence on decisions and criteria design across all the stages of the management succession process. From the family perspective, natural succession based on birth order and gender was considered to be the key determinant of the succession pool composition. Support of the successor by the family members through acceptance of the choice and not passing judgement when mistakes are made emerged as the critical family dimension that will influence the overall management succession process. In terms of the business itself, the size and nature of the business and change in market conditions were established to have a major influence on the succession process.

40|$|Executive Summary]. Policy {{development}} in the EU is often impeded by member states being either {{unwilling or unable to}} participate. One way to overcome that problem is to resort to flexible approaches accommodating diversity. Convinced that an enlarged Union would require more flexibility, the current member states agreed in 1997 to introduce a new safety valve in the treaties, named ‘enhanced cooperation’. Thanks to that mechanism, a group of member states may be authorised to use the EU framework to further their cooperation or integration in policy areas under EU competence whenever it appears impossible to do so with all of the member states. There are a number of reasons why the Constitutional Treaty under negotiation should not only uphold such a mechanism, but should improve it in various respects. The future treaty should start by suppressing redundant preconditions for authorisation, introducing the possibility for a group of willing and able to gear up (i. e. adopt more efficient decision-making procedures and embrace higher ambitions), as well as extending the scope of enhanced cooperation to foreign and defence matters. It should also suppress the minimum participation threshold and clarify the last resort stipulation. As to authorisation, the future treaty should simplify the proposal procedure, specify what may be included in the proposal, streamline the consultation and deliberation procedures, and provide that, for CFSP too, the authorisation is given by the Council acting by qualified majority or superqualified <b>majority.</b> <b>Participation</b> in enhanced cooperation should be open to all, provided that objective criteria are met. The same conditions should apply for initial and subsequent participation. Admission to enhanced cooperation should be managed by the Commission under a single procedure. Regarding enhanced cooperation’s operating mode, the future treaty should stick to the current system of ‘institutional isomorphism’ (no variable geometry in the European Parliament or the Commission). Nevertheless, participating member states should be allowed to decide, acting unanimously, that enhanced cooperation shall be governed by qualified majority instead of unanimity and/or by codecision procedure. They should also be authorised to hold restricted meetings at an informal level. The future treaty should further introduce the possibility to differentiate between the ‘pre-in’ (member states willing to participate but unable to do so from the start) and the ‘out’ (member states unwilling to participate). Finally, the status of the acts and decisions resulting from enhanced cooperation could be revisited. In any case, the future treaty should authorise the Council to decide by a qualified majority that the Union’s budget will support enhanced cooperation’s operational costs...|$|E

40|$|It is {{well known}} that ex post {{efficient}} mechanisms for the provision of indivisible public goods are not interim individually rational. However, the corresponding literature assumes that agents who veto a mechanism can enforce {{a situation in which the}} public good is never provided. This paper instead considers majority voting with uniform cost sharing as the relevant status quo. Efficient mechanisms may then exist, which also satisfy all agents' interim participation constraints. In this case, ex post inefficient voting mechanisms can be replaced by efficient ones without reducing any individual's expected utility. Intuitively, agents with a low willingness to pay have to contribute more under majority rule than under an efficient mechanism with a balanced budget.

5000|$|Instead of {{challenging}} their non-appointment before the Council of State, the three mayors chose {{to bring it}} before the Congress of Local and Regional Authorities of the Council of Europe. On 13 and 14 May 2008, the Congress sent a fact-finding mission to Belgium {{to look into the}} situation. The delegation was led by a Frenchman and consisted further of a Serbian representative, a German expert, and two other French members of the Congress. The Council of Europe can make recommendations to its 47 member states, but it cannot impose sanctions on them for non-compliance and its conclusions are not legally binding. The mayors allowed that French was spoken during council meetings and refused to apply the recommendations of the Flemish directives. This went against the stipulations of language laws and lead to their non-appointment. Michel Guégan, president of the delegation, found that the sanction of non-appointment was disproportionate to the infractions. According to him, it hindered the normal functioning of the municipality. He also questioned why the regional authority had to appoint [...] "democratically elected mayors". He also said that in towns with French-speaking <b>majorities,</b> <b>participation</b> of the inhabitants in local politics is complicated when the official language of administration is Dutch. The decisions of the delegation were considered ridiculous in Flanders. The Flemish Interior Minister, Marino Keulen, said they were [...] "absurd" [...] because they did {{not take into account the}} language legislation, the grounds on which their nomination was refused. In the European Parliament, Frieda Brepoels (N-VA) decounced [...] "the arrogance and thoughtlessness" [...] of the delegation. The Flemish government ignored the resolutions of the fact-finding mission, Keulen saying the acting mayors should take their case to the Council of State rather than to the Council of Europe. On 2 December 2008, the Congress voting a resolution on the issue. Of all 46 members entitled to vote, 16 were present: 14 voted in favour, the only Flemish representative voted against, and the only Dutch member abstained from voting. In the adopted resolution, the Congress urged the Belgian state to appoint the mayors and to review the language legislation in the concerned municipalities.|$|R

According to the literature, these students often report feelings {{of isolation and}} alienation, and have comparatively high attrition rates, even when compared with members of other minority groups. Researchers have found that for African-American students, the experience of affiliation counters feelings of isolation. Participation in athletics is one way for students {{to feel that they}} are important members of the university community. ^ This study was a qualitative investigation of small samples of African-American and Caucasian athletes and nonathletes at a large, public, predominantly Caucasian university. Particular attention was paid to African-American students and the relationship between athletic participation and feelings of affiliation within the university community. Students participated in a semi-structured interview, completed The Participation Motivation Questionnaire, The Collective Self-Esteem Survey, and the Revised UCLA Loneliness Scale, and responded to selected stimuli from the T. A. T and R. A. T. C. ^ For all of the athletically involved individuals in this study, regardless of race, athletic participation has been important throughout life. These students view their childhood athletic involvement as having provided a valuable and enjoyable learning experience in which they increased their self-awareness and self-confidence, and in which they developed and used skills in cooperation and competition. At the university, students of both races acquired valuable skills and insight that they believed would be useful in their lives after college. For African-American students who experienced feelings of alienation at the university, athletics gave them a peer group in which they could feel safe and accepted. Several of the African-American students spoke about negative experiences before college associated with their being visibly distinct from the <b>majority.</b> Athletic <b>participation</b> gave these students a way to be visible in a positive way, and to feel like important members of the larger university community. ...|$|R

40|$|Gambling is a {{recreational}} activity that, when restricted to affordable limits, is experienced as an enjoyable socially acceptable leisure activity. For the <b>majority</b> of individuals, <b>participation</b> in gambling {{is comparable to}} purchasing and participating {{in a range of}} other recreational activities, such as a night out at the cinema or theatre, skiing, shopping, or eating out at restaurants. However, for a minority of community members, gambling behaviour can become episodically or chronically excessive resulting in significant negative consequences with associated gambling-related harms affecting personal, familial, marital, social, employment and legal functioning.
