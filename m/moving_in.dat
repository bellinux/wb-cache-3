40|$|The recent {{discovery}} of light <b>moving</b> backwards <b>in</b> time, when it propagates in a suitable dispersive medium, obliges us to reexamine the Kramers-Kronig relations.

5|$|Crocodilians were {{traditionally}} {{thought to}} breathe like mammals, with airflow <b>moving</b> <b>in</b> and out tidally, but studies published in 2010 and 2013 conclude that crocodilians breathe more like birds, with airflow <b>moving</b> <b>in</b> a unidirectional loop within the lungs. When a crocodilian inhales, air {{flows through the}} trachea and into two primary bronchi, or airways, which branch off into narrower secondary passageways. The air continues to move through these, then into even narrower tertiary airways, and then into other secondary airways which were bypassed the first time. The air then flows back into the primary airways and is exhaled back out. These aerodynamic valves within the bronchial tree have been hypothesised to explain how crocodilians can have unidirectional airflow {{without the aid of}} avian-like air sacs.|$|E

50|$|Einstein {{rejected}} the Newtonian concept and identified t as the fourth coordinate of a space-time four-vector. Einstein's view of time requires a physical equivalence between coordinate time and coordinate space. In this view, {{time should be}} a reversible coordinate {{in the same manner}} as space. Particles <b>moving</b> backward <b>in</b> time are often used to display antiparticles in Feynman-diagrams, but they are not thought of as really <b>moving</b> backward <b>in</b> time usually it is done to simplify notation.

Another tropical depression formed on September4 {{to the west of}} the Marianas Islands, which moved to the south and later northeast, dissipating on September6.

5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{emerged into}} the Atlantic Ocean {{from the west}} coast of Africa near Dakar, Senegal on September22. The wave traveled westward with minimal tropical cyclogenesis and reached the Lesser Antilles about a week later. While passing through the islands, heavy rainfall and strong winds were reported. Eventually, the system developed into a broad area of low pressure and acquired a low-level circulation. However, upper-level wind shear resulted in no immediate further organization. After crossing Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, wind shear decreased, since the low was <b>moving</b> <b>in</b> the same direction as the upper-level winds.|$|E
5|$|After 1492, {{a global}} {{exchange}} of previously local {{crops and livestock}} breeds occurred. Maize, potatoes, sweet potatoes and manioc were the key crops that spread from the New World to the Old, while varieties of wheat, barley, rice and turnips traveled from the Old World to the New. There had been few livestock species in the New World, with horses, cattle, sheep and goats being completely unknown before their arrival with Old World settlers. Crops <b>moving</b> <b>in</b> both directions across the Atlantic Ocean caused population growth {{around the world and}} a lasting effect on many cultures. Maize and cassava were introduced from Brazil into Africa by Portuguese traders in the 16th century, becoming staple foods, replacing native African crops.|$|E
