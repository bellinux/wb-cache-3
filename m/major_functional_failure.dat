5000|$|Also in {{the early}} 2000s <b>functional</b> <b>failure</b> mode {{analysis}} {{was added to the}} FMEDA process by John C. Grebe. In early FMEDA work, component failure modes were mapped directly to [...] "safe" [...] or [...] "dangerous" [...] categories per IEC 61508. This was relatively easy since everything that was not [...] "dangerous" [...] was [...] "safe." [...] With multiple failure mode categories now existing, direct assignment became more difficult. In addition, {{it became clear that the}} category assignment might change if a product were used in different applications. With direct failure mode category assignment during the FMEDA, a new FMEDA was required for each new application or each variation in usage. Under the <b>functional</b> <b>failure</b> mode approach, the actual <b>functional</b> <b>failure</b> modes of the product are identified during an FMEA. During the detailed FMEDA, each component failure mode is mapped to a <b>functional</b> <b>failure</b> mode. The <b>functional</b> <b>failure</b> modes are then categorized according to product failure mode in a particular application. This eliminates the need for more detailed work when a new application is considered.|$|R

The immunological reaction of rejection is a <b>major</b> cause of <b>functional</b> <b>failure</b> in transplant patients. The current 2 ̆ 2 gold standard 2 ̆ 2 for detecting or confirming graft rejection following solid organ transplantation requires biopsy samples in order to detect immune cell (e. g., T-cells, macrophages, etc.) infiltration into the graft and other pathological changes. This procedure is not only invasive, having associated risks, but is also prone to sampling errors that can yield false negative results. To circumvent the need for biopsies, we are developing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques to monitor the accumulation of immune cells at the transplanted organ {{as a means to}} detect graft rejection. By labeling immune cells with an MRI contrast agent, dextran-coated ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron oxide (USPIO) particles, we can monitor the accumulation of these labeled immune cells at the rejecting graft as a non-invasive method to detect graft rejection. Cells can be labeled ex vivo and then infused into the animal, or MRI contrast agents can be introduced directly into the animal in vivo. Our results show excellent correlation among the MRI signal intensity due to the USPIO-labeled macrophages at the rejecting graft, immuno-staining for macrophages, histo-pathology for graft rejection, and the iron staining of tissue samples. In this article, we shall give a summary of our progress from detecting single immune cells in vitro to monitoring the accumulation of immune cells in vivo at the transplanted kidneys, hearts, and lungs in our rat models for organ transplantation by MRI...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—In {{this paper}} we propose a dynamic noise model to verify <b>functional</b> <b>failures</b> due to {{crosstalk}} in high-speed circuits. Conventional DC noise analysis produces pessimistic results because it ignores the fact that a gate acts as a low-pass filter. In contrast, the dynamic noise model considers the temporal property of a noise waveform and analyzes its effect on functionality. In this model, both capacitive and inductive coupling are considered as the dominant source of noise in high-speed deep-submicron circuits. It is observed {{that in the case of}} the local interconnects (where wire lengths are short), the effect of inductive coupling is small; however, for long interconnects this effect may be considerable. Based on this noise model, we have developed an algorithm to verify high-speed circuits for <b>functional</b> <b>failures</b> due to crosstalk. Design of a 4 -bit precharge-evaluate full adder circuit is verified, and many nodes which are susceptible to crosstalk noise are identified. It is observed and further verified by SPICE simulation that dynamic noise analysis is more realistic for verifying <b>functional</b> <b>failures</b> due to crosstalk than DC noise analysis. I...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Diagnosis of <b>functional</b> <b>failures</b> is {{critical}} for locating manufacturing defects, increasing yield, and reducing field returns. It is important to narrow down the defective module in a failed component during board-level diagnosis. In this paper, a generic fault-diagnosis method based on an error-flow dictionary is presented to identify {{the root cause of}} <b>functional</b> <b>failures</b> on a chip or board. Error propagation mimics actual dataflow in a circuit, thus it reflects the native (functional) mode of circuit operation. In contrast to conventional fault syndromes, error flow includes the failure information in terms of circuit functionality, which significantly facilitates the diagnosis of <b>functional</b> <b>failures.</b> In the proposed diagnosis procedure, error flow is first learned from a good circuit by intentionally inserting faults, and then the root cause of a failing circuit is determined by comparing the similarity between the pre-learned error flow and the error flow observed from the failing circuit. The similarity of two error flows is evaluated based on the length of the longest common subsequence in string matching. Results for an open-source RISC SoC and an industrial communication circuit highlight the effectiveness of the proposed method. I...|$|R

40|$|Ensuring the {{reliability}} of complex software intensive systems is becoming a critical requirement for all military and commercial aerospace applications, and becomes especially more challenging when implemented for autonomous and evolving deployments required of such applications. To ensure reliability, this research asserts that knowledge, data, and models of such complex systems must be integrated with their intended systems starting from the early design stages, hence enabling designers and engineers to plan for contingencies, redundancies, and potential changes early, before costly design decisions have been made. In this paper, a general system-level design methodology is introduced to perform simulation-based failure identification and propagation analysis of softwarehardware systems. In particular, the <b>Functional</b> <b>Failure</b> Identification and Propagation (FFIP) analysis framework is introduced as a novel approach for designing reliable software-intensive systems.

40|$|In this study, {{a formula}} is {{described}} for calculating {{the relationship between}} preventive maintenance inspections and train delays for rail infrastructure. The reduction in train delays due to preventive maintenance has been calculated as follows: When an inspection is performed, the probability to find a potential failure is between 0 and 100 %. The potential failure is registered as an inspection remark. The risk that the potential failure will degrade to a <b>functional</b> <b>failure</b> within a certain time is also between 0 and 100 %. Strictly speaking, this time {{is equal to the}} specified maximum time to restoration in the inspection remark registration, e. g. within one week, but in practice longer. As an example, one can assume 100 inspections, with 10 % probability to find a potential failure, 75 % risk for <b>functional</b> <b>failure</b> if an action is not taken within a near future and 25 % risk for train delays. This gives 100 · 0. 1 · 0. 75 · 0. 25 = 1. 875 prevented train-delaying <b>functional</b> <b>failures,</b> and therefore 1. 875 times the average number of train delay minutes in reduced minutes of train delays.   A case study was carried out to verify the proposed method. The prevented train-delay minutes per maintenance inspection for various rail infrastructure systems were found to be between 0 - 40 minutes per inspection. However, the result depends to a large extent on the definition of inspection within the maintenance database. The result also depends on the type of inspection, e. g. safety or maintenance inspections. Moreover, the result depends greatly on the criteria that are being used for specifying the risk that a potential failure will degrade to a <b>functional</b> <b>failure</b> within a certain time period. These factors need to be clear before actions are taken upon the results...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{estimation}} of the <b>functional</b> <b>failure</b> probability of a thermal-hydraulic (T-H) passive system {{can be done by}} Monte Carlo (MC) sampling of the epistemic uncertainties affecting the system model and the numerical values of its parameters, followed by the computation of the system response by a mechanistic T-H code, for each sample. The computational effort associated to this approach can be prohibitive because a large number of lengthy T-H code simulations must be performed (one for each sample) for accurate quantification of the <b>functional</b> <b>failure</b> probability and the related statistics. In this paper, the computational burden is reduced by replacing the long-running, original T-H code by a fast-running, empirical regression model: in particular, an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model is considered. It is constructed {{on the basis of a}} limited-size set of data representing examples of the input/output nonlinear relationships underlying the original T-H code; once the model is built, it is used for performing, in an acceptable computational time, the numerous system response calculations needed for an accurate failure probability estimation, uncertainty propagation and sensitivity analysis. The empirical approximation of the system response provided by the ANN model introduces an additional source of (model) uncertainty, which needs to be evaluated and accounted for. A bootstrapped ensemble of ANN regression models is here built for quantifying, in terms of confidence intervals, the (model) uncertainties associated with the estimates provided by the ANNs. For demonstration purposes, an application to the <b>functional</b> <b>failure</b> analysis of an emergency passive decay heat removal system in a simple steady-state model of a Gas-cooled Fast Reactor (GFR) is presented.
