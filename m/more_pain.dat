5|$|The marshall's moans of pain get worse, {{disturbing}} the other survivors. Eventually he asks to see Kate alone, {{and when she}} enters the tent, the marshal asks what Kate {{wanted to ask him}} before he was knocked unconscious during the crash. Kate tells him she wants to make sure Ray gets his reward. The marshal laughs, telling Kate that she is one of a kind, and then asks if he is going to die. Kate nods, and he asks if she is going to do it. As Kate leaves, Sawyer enters with the gun, and a gunshot is heard. Jack becomes angry but Sawyer claims that the marshal asked to be killed. Muffled coughs are then heard, and it is revealed that Sawyer's shot missed the marshal's heart and pierced his lung, causing him <b>more</b> <b>pain.</b> Jack then euthanizes the marshal, presumably by suffocating him.|$|E
5|$|Finding her mother's body, Buffy {{at first}} denies what she sees, {{to the point}} of imagining {{alternate}} realities. Whedon stated that these mini dream sequences were like documentaries; people who find their loved ones dead are desperate to imagine a different, better outcome, and they create fantasies that cause much <b>more</b> <b>pain</b> when they are forced to return to the harshness of reality. Later in the hospital, Buffy imagines what she {{might have been able to}} do to save Joyce, although the doctor tells her there was nothing to be done. Willow and Xander express anger and helplessness. Anya, new to mortality and human connections, is childlike in her innocence and questions. Xander's anger and Anya's confusion allow them to be mothered somewhat by Willow, who needs to take care of someone. Dawn is deeply in denial, unable to understand that the woman she thought she had known all her life was gone. Tara, who has gone through the ordeal before, represents the acceptance phase, soothing and helping the others to work through what they are experiencing. Buffy toward the end also begins to see acceptance when she tells Dawn that the body in the morgue is not their mother; Joyce is gone.|$|E
25|$|The {{neatness}} of his attire {{was almost}} incredible; I believe {{a speck of}} dust would have caused him <b>more</b> <b>pain</b> than a bullet wound. Yet this quaint dandified little man who, I was sorry to see, now limped badly, {{had been in his}} time one of the most celebrated members of the Belgian police.|$|E
5000|$|In {{addition}} to defined diseases and syndromes, many common [...] "everyday" [...] pains appear to overburden women rather than men. Therefore, studies consistently find that women report <b>more</b> severe <b>pain,</b> <b>more</b> frequent <b>pain,</b> longer-lasting pain, and wider-ranging pain than men. For example, common painful {{conditions such as}} dysmenorrhea may predispose females to <b>more</b> widespread musculoskeletal <b>pains.</b>|$|R

25|$|For {{overweight}} people, {{weight loss}} {{may be an}} important factor. Patient education {{has been shown to be}} helpful in the self-management of arthritis. It decreases pain, improves function, reduces stiffness and fatigue, and reduces medical usage. Patient education can provide on average 20% <b>more</b> <b>pain</b> relief when compared to NSAIDs alone in patients with hip osteoarthritis.|$|E
25|$|Dulles {{contracted}} colon cancer, {{for which}} he was first operated on in November 1956 when it had caused a bowel perforation. He experienced abdominal pain at the end of 1958 and was hospitalized with a diagnosis of diverticulitis. In January 1959, Dulles returned to work, but with <b>more</b> <b>pain</b> and declining health underwent abdominal surgery in February at Walter Reed Hospital when the cancer's recurrence became evident. After recuperating in Florida, Dulles returned to Washington for work and radiation therapy. With further declining health and evidence of bone metastasis, he resigned from office on April 15, 1959.|$|E
25|$|The {{surgical}} {{scars of}} a breast augmentation mammoplasty heal at 6-weeks post-operative, and fade within several months, {{according to the}} skin type of the woman. Depending upon the daily physical activity the woman might require, the augmentation mammoplasty patient usually resumes her normal life activities at about 1-week post-operative. The woman who underwent submuscular implantation (beneath the pectoralis major muscles) usually has a longer post–operative convalescence, and experiences <b>more</b> <b>pain,</b> because of the healing of the deep-tissue cuts into the chest muscles for the breast augmenation. The patient usually does not exercise or engage in strenuous physical activities for about 6 weeks. Moreover, during the initial convalescence, the patient is encouraged to regularly exercise (flex and move) her arms to alleviate pain and discomfort; and, as required, analgesic medication catheters for alleviating pain.|$|E

25|$|The {{most common}} {{mechanism}} of stimulation of acupuncture points employs {{penetration of the}} skin by thin metal needles, which are manipulated manually or the needle may be further stimulated by electrical stimulation (electroacupuncture). Acupuncture needles are typically made of stainless steel, making them flexible and preventing them from rusting or breaking. Needles are usually disposed of after each use to prevent contamination. Reusable needles when used should be sterilized between applications. Needles vary in length between , with shorter needles used near the face and eyes, and longer needles in areas with thicker tissues; needle diameters vary from 0 to 0, with thicker needles used on more robust patients. Thinner needles may be flexible and require tubes for insertion. The tip of the needle should not be made too sharp to prevent breakage, although blunt needles cause <b>more</b> <b>pain.</b>|$|E
25|$|When {{the breast}} overfills with milk it becomes painful. Engorgement comes from {{not getting enough}} milk from the breast. It happens about 3 to 7 days after {{delivery}} and occurs more often in first time mothers. The increased blood supply, the accumulated milk and the swelling all contribute to the painful engorgement. Engorgement may affect the areola, {{the periphery of the}} breast or the entire breast, and may interfere with breastfeeding both from the pain and also from the distortion of the normal shape of the areola/nipple. This makes it harder for the baby to latch on properly for feeding. Latching may occur over only part of the areola. This can irritate the nipple more, and may lead to ineffective drainage of breast milk and <b>more</b> <b>pain.</b> Engorgement may begin as a result of several factors such as nipple pain, improper feeding technique, infrequent feeding or infant-mother separation.|$|E
25|$|In a {{turbulent}} 2002–03 Tikvesh saw four different managers {{through the course}} of the season in the Macedonian First League. Despite promising performances {{during the first half of}} the season Perica Gruevski surprisingly resigned as manager on 8 November 2002, citing the bad financial situation at the club as the main reason for his departure. His assistant Lazar Iliev was appointed as a caretaker manager, and took the helm until the winter break. On 16 January 2003 Tikvesh announced that they had appointed Blagoja Kitanovski as new head coach, who only held the position for three months and resigned in April 2003. On 28 April 2003 Nikola Gligorov was appointed as the new manager of Tikvesh. After a very good start of the 2002–03 season Tikvesh comfortably avoided relegation in the end, however <b>more</b> <b>pain</b> was yet to be inflicted in 2003–04 season when they were relegated from the Macedonian First League for a second time in four years. Following this relegation from the Macedonian First League Tikvesh fell into serious financial difficulties and a downward spiral set in.|$|E

On October 23, {{less than a week}} before the start of what would have been the 40-year-old Nash's 19th year in the NBA, he was ruled out for the season due to a recurring back injury. Nash only played in three preseason games before he started to feel <b>more</b> <b>pain</b> in his back. Nash on injuring his back: [...] "Being on the court this season has been my top priority, and it is disappointing to {{not be able to do}} that right now. I work very hard to stay healthy, and unfortunately my recent setback makes performing at full capacity difficult. I will continue to support my team during this period of rest and will focus on my long-term health." ...|$|E

500|$|Pembleton and Lange grow closer; Lange {{experiences}} <b>more</b> <b>pain</b> as time passes, {{and switches}} among remorse, anger, and casual small talk during their conversations. Later, Pembleton holds Lange's hand {{to comfort him}} and confides about his recent stroke. Bayliss grows suspicious when Biedron says that he cannot recall his last place of work or {{when he moved to}} Baltimore. Biedron eventually admits that he had been criminally charged and placed into a psychiatric ward for pushing a man in front of a Chicago subway train for no reason. Biedron is arrested, and Bayliss confirms to Pembleton that Lange was pushed; Pembleton decides not to tell Lange because he does not think that it will comfort him, but Lange figures it out for himself by observing their conversation. Lange experiences greater pain and starts to lose consciousness. After saying [...] "I'm OK" [...] to Pembleton, Lange falls unconscious and the EMTs push the train with the airbags. Lange dies immediately after he is removed. A shocked and disoriented Pembleton leaves the subway and, after staring at Biedron {{in the back of a}} police squad car, walks to his vehicle while recalling a line about how sugar maple leaves behave when it rains (a line that Lange said as he was dying). He then drives away with Bayliss. The episode ends with Flannigan jogging past the subway station.|$|E

She added, [...] "It meant she was a [...] because she had nobody to care about her. She was quite a selfish woman [...]" [...] Dot has been described by author Hilary Kingsley as a [...] "born victim." [...] She adds that [...] "with each blow that life delivers [...] bobs back up again, almost asking for more trouble, <b>more</b> <b>pain,</b> more suffering." [...] Dot is renowned for being a hypochondriac, her Christian faith and quoting from the Bible. She has been described by Rupert Smith, author of 20 Years in Albert Square, as [...] "God-bothering" [...] and self-righteous. According to Kingsley, [...] "nothing shakes Dot's view that the world is good because the creator made it so. Her faith sustains her through the most appalling ordeals." [...] The character once expressed {{part of the reason for}} her faith on-screen in 2000, commenting to a vicar, [...] "I couldn't manage without my faith, not with the life I've had"; former executive producer of EastEnders, John Yorke, has stated that this is his favourite line of EastEnders' entire existence. Author Antony Slide has noted that Dot's religious beliefs have given her solace, but has given her an excuse to be prejudiced against her neighbours, and to deal with the criminal antics of her wayward son. He described her as a [...] "simpleminded woman whom one loved to hate".|$|E
500|$|In 2000, the Unified Rules of Mixed Martial Arts {{were written}} with the {{intention}} of making the sport of MMA appear more acceptable in a wider society. Under those rules, soccer kicks were explicitly banned and classed as a foul defined as [...] "kicking the head of a grounded opponent". It is noted that while soccer kicks to grounded opponents are fouls, axe kicks, downward strikes with the back of the heel, are not considered fouls if done to any part of a grounded opponent. In the years after the banning of soccer kicks under the Unified Rules, a number of fans and MMA fighters have argued for them to be permitted under the Unified Rules along with face and foot stomps. Their justification is that soccer kicks and foot stomps being disallowed hindered fighters who were used to using them under other MMA rule sets. Mauricio Rua, who mostly used soccer kicks to earn victories in Pride, argued that elbows caused <b>more</b> <b>pain</b> than soccer kicks and claimed that soccer kicks were safer than elbows. Rua also argued that elbows were more dangerous than soccer kicks and yet were allowed under the unified rules. Opponents of soccer kicks argued that they needed to be banned in order for the sport of MMA to move forward. They also argued that in the face of opposition to the sport from politicians such as John McCain, soccer kicks had to be banned {{in order to ensure that}} the sport was not viewed as illegal [...] "human cockfighting" [...] and could be sanctioned as legal in the United States by Athletic Commissions.|$|E

500|$|The episode {{received}} largely positive {{reviews from}} television critics. Jessica Morgan from Television Without Pity gave the episode an A– rating. Juliette Harrisson of Den of Geek named [...] "John Doe" [...] the best stand-alone episode of season nine {{and called it}} [...] "a refreshing change of pace". Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, gave the episode a glowing review and rated it five stars out of five. The two praised Gilligan's script and Patrick's performance, noting that the former [...] "writes the script with a dirtiness that gives it real power" [...] and the latter's acting was [...] "extraordinary". Furthermore, Shearman and Pearson wrote that [...] "'John Doe' shows that there's still a fresh take to be had on The X-Files after all". Meghan Deans of Tor.com applauded the episode and called it [...] "a clear bright spot in a dark and dismal season, both in its script and in its shooting." [...] She felt that the focus on Doggett was effectively done, and the script focused on [...] "strong character arcs", which worked towards its advantage. In the end, she concluded that the episode was [...] "part of the X-Files, more so than would an alien or a mutant" [...] because it focused {{on the idea that}} [...] "pain makes you, <b>more</b> <b>pain</b> makes you better, and living within that pain keeps you alive." [...] M.A. Crang, in his book Denying the Truth: Revisiting The X-Files after 9/11, praised the central premise, the cinematography and Patrick's performance, calling [...] "John Doe" [...] a [...] "stylishly produced entry".|$|E
