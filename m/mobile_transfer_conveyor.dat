This kind of chassis is {{commonly}} used in open cast mines for <b>mobile</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>conveyor</b> or for bucket wheel excavators. In each machine the chassis consist of 6 to 12 caterpillar tracks, which some are steered. Existing models used for analytical calculations are based on simplified relations taken from quasistatic equations of stability and geometrical connections. The complex research was conducted on <b>mobile</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>conveyor,</b> which is used in open cast mine. The aim of measurements was to identify the value of force that acts on elements of chassis during the steering and driving the machine. The measurements were taken during the drive in different directions, with different positions of center of gravity. The strain gauges were used to measure the deformation on each caterpillar track, trusses and drawbar...|$|E

40|$|As {{discrete}} element modelling (DEM) {{becomes more}} widely {{used as a}} design tool, its suitability to modelling belt conveyor applications including <b>conveyor</b> <b>transfers</b> and <b>conveyor</b> trajectories is becoming more recognised. The accuracy of the data inputted for both the system geometry and particle perspective are vital if the outputs obtained from DEM simulations are to be considered valid.

This paper focuses on two such parameters; coefficient of rolling friction and shear modulus. A series of sensitivity analyses have been undertaken to determine the impact of varying the values for these parameters on the final outcomes of DEM simulations. These simulation outcomes will be compared to experimentally measured data from conveying iron ore through a <b>conveyor</b> <b>transfer</b> research facility which has been commissioned at the University of Wollongong...|$|R

40|$|A {{critical}} factor {{in the design of}} <b>conveyor</b> <b>transfers</b> is the ability for material to flow at a velocity as close to that of the conveyor belt as possible. If particle velocity increases too much issues such as particle attrition, dust generation, chute wear and excessive noise can arise, whereas if particle velocity were to decrease, stagnation zones could develop, resulting in issues such as spillage or chute blockage. There are numerous methods available in which to analyse particle flow through a <b>conveyor</b> <b>transfer,</b> including; continuum based analytical methods, the discrete element method (DEM) and experimental analysis. This paper will detail the validation process for these three methods. The experimental investigations were performed on the <b>conveyor</b> <b>transfer</b> research facility located at the University of Wollongong, using high-speed video to capture the flow and analysis via Image Pro Plus.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to determine if either analytical methods or numerical discrete element modelling could be used with accuracy to design <b>conveyor</b> <b>transfers.</b> This goal was achieved using two test materials, polyethylene pellets and corn, which were selected for their different particle and bulk properties and also for a third product, iron ore, but to a lesser extent due to test rig limitations. The design of <b>conveyor</b> <b>transfers</b> has traditionally been based on either trial and error or previous experience and seen as a “black art” rather than a science, as such very few design guides are available. The design of <b>conveyor</b> <b>transfers</b> can be based on experimental investigations, although this method can be costly to companies, taking vital resources away from the key goal of continuous production. The analytical models have existed for some time and have become widely accepted design tools; however, there is limited validation of these to determine their overall performance (both advantages and disadvantages). The analytical models are two dimensional in application and their accuracy with respect to the three dimensional nature of transfer chutes is not clear. This is an area which needs further investigation. The design of transfer chutes has undergone an evolution since the advent of discrete element modelling (DEM) as well as increases in computer processing power. The potential to simulate and predict the behaviour of a transfer chute design before it is constructed can be highly desirable with the prospect of saving substantial time and money. This being said, there has been little validation published on the application of DEM in industrial applications, although in recent years this has started to increase with the realisation that companies need to be convinced this is a legitimate design tool. Additional DEM validation is warranted with respect to <b>conveyor</b> <b>transfers.</b> An experimental test program was undertaken following the design and commissioning of a novel <b>conveyor</b> <b>transfer</b> research facility. This experimental work focussed on two main areas; investigation of particle flow of material through a <b>conveyor</b> <b>transfer</b> hood and spoon and the generation of conveyor trajectories. From these areas, ‘real’ data was obtained for a range of granular free-flowing products, using a combination of high-speed video capture and still photography, for the purposes of validation. The effect of belt speed, material feed rate and the positioning of the transfer hood and spoon were considered in these investigations. Additional to this experimental work was the testing and collection {{of a wide range of}} particle and system characteristics for use in the analytical modelling and discrete element modelling components of this research. Two analytical models were then used to predict the particle flow of the test materials through the <b>conveyor</b> <b>transfer</b> hood and spoon. Belt speed, material feed rate and positioning of the transfer hood and spoon were all considered as part of this analysis to provide direct comparisons with the data obtained from the experimental testing. Prediction of the conveyor trajectories was performed using seven trajectory models available in the literature. These comparisons investigated the effect of belt speed and mass flow rate on the trajectory profiles, again providing a direct link with the experimental data. The discrete element method was used to generate three dimensional simulations of the material flow through the <b>conveyor</b> <b>transfer</b> hood and spoon and also conveyor trajectories, based on 3 D CAD models of the <b>conveyor</b> <b>transfer</b> research facility. These simulation outputs were then compared to both the experimental data and data obtained from the analytical models. Two software packages were used, Chute MavenTM and EDEM. Chute MavenTM was used to produce the initial transfer chute and trajectory simulations using spherical particles. High material feed rates corresponding to those tested experimentally could not be simulated and so EDEM was employed to develop further simulations. The fact that EDEM has the ability to model both spherical and shaped (clustered) particles was utilised to investigate the effect of shape on simulation output. A critical aspect of any discrete element modelling is whether the outputs are realistic. To minimise any potential issues, a wide range of bench-scale calibration experiments and simulations were also completed to validate both DEM packages used. It can be concluded that the analytical models for <b>conveyor</b> <b>transfers</b> provided close approximations from a two dimensional perspective, however, there were some slight over-predictions evident in some situations. For conveyor trajectories, the models presented a substantial variation in prediction, however, one method stood out as being accurate under all conditions for the materials tested experimentally. Findings from the discrete element modelling showed the dynamic behaviour mimics that of the experimental testing and there was a general agreement with both the experimental investigations and analytical models for the <b>conveyor</b> <b>transfer</b> comparisons. With respect to conveyor trajectories, the DEM results agreed with the results seen experimentally and also predicted the same trajectory path as the one “stand out” analytical trajectory method mentioned above. The importance of DEM calibration and validation has also been documented and shown to be an absolute necessity in the successful simulation of industrial applications...|$|R

For this particular study, the researcher adopted both exploratory and descriptive research design, using non-probability and probability sampling techniques. Questionnaires were used to collect data from the employees and one-on-one interviews were conducted in order to gather data from management personnel. The total population used for this study was 40, comprising of BancABC management and employees only. The sample size was 36. Pilot testing was done, data was gathered through the use of interviews that were conducted with management and questionnaires were distributed by the researcher to the employees. The researcher encountered some challenges in obtaining information from management and employees due to their busy and tight schedules. The researcher booked appointments to interview the managers in due time though this proved difficult they eventually squeezed in time to offer the researcher valuable information pertaining the area under study.
