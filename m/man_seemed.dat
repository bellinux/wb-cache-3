500|$|Flight 367 {{departed}} from Stockholm Arlanda Airport at 1:30p.m. on 26 January. The aircraft, a McDonnell Douglas DC-9, landed at Copenhagen Airport at 2:30p.m., {{where it was}} taken over by Vulović and her colleagues. [...] "As it was late, we were in the terminal and saw it park," [...] Vulović said. [...] "I saw all the passengers and crew deplane. One <b>man</b> <b>seemed</b> terribly annoyed. It was not only me that noticed him either. Other crew members saw him, as did the station manager in Copenhagen. I think it was the man who put the bomb in the baggage. I think he had checked in a bag in Stockholm, got off in Copenhagen and never re-boarded the flight." [...] Flight 367 {{departed from}} Copenhagen Airport at 3:15p.m. At 4:01p.m., an explosion tore through the DC-9's baggage compartment. The explosion caused the aircraft to break apart mid-air over the Czechoslovak village of Srbská Kamenice. Vulović {{was the only one of}} the 28 passengers and crew to survive the crash. She was discovered by a villager named Bruno Honke, who heard her screaming amid the wreckage. Her turquoise uniform was covered in blood and her [...] stiletto heels had been torn off by the force of the impact. Honke had been a medic during World War II and was able to keep her alive until rescuers arrived at the scene.|$|E
2500|$|On Saturday, April 27, a man {{was arrested}} in Corpus Christi, Texas for trying to sell a {{saxophone}} to a music store. On Thursday, April 25, the thirty-year-old man walked into a music store without an instrument and asked the sales person {{if they wanted to}} buy an alto Bundy saxophone. The girl told him that she would need to speak to her manager. The man replied, [...] "What do you have {{to talk to him about}} it for? You work here, don't you?" [...] The girl claimed that the <b>man</b> <b>seemed</b> nervous. Once the manager was summoned, the man fled. The store contacted the police. The man was arrested two days later at a waterfront hotel after purchasing a [...]45 revolver from a pawn shop. On Tuesday, April 30, the sales girl identified him as the same man who tried selling the saxophone. Although no saxophone was found in his possession, the police found a bag of bloody clothing in his hotel room. The man claimed that the blood was from a cut he had received on his forehead in a bar fight.|$|E
60|$|The <b>man</b> <b>seemed</b> {{a little}} dazed, but turned {{automatically}} towards the wardrobe.|$|E
60|$|The <b>men</b> <b>seemed</b> glad and relieved. Joel Creech {{heard and}} he came near to Bostil.|$|R
60|$|Harry (From railings). The old <b>man</b> <b>seems</b> to {{have gone}} to sleep waiting for that to-morrow of his.|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{newspaper}} <b>man</b> <b>seems</b> {{remarkably well}} informed," [...] Wyndham observed. [...] "I expect {{he has a}} correspondent in the neighborhood." ...|$|R
60|$|What agony was this! And the <b>man</b> <b>seemed</b> {{resolved}} to protract it.|$|E
60|$|The <b>man</b> <b>seemed</b> lost in thought, but {{he looked}} up when she spoke.|$|E
60|$|The {{other young}} <b>man</b> <b>seemed</b> {{to welcome the}} {{advances}} of the airy ex-coachman.|$|E
60|$|The <b>men</b> <b>seemed</b> {{satisfied}} with the plan and broke up into parties of two. Eddie Shorter paired off with Billy Byrne.|$|R
60|$|All {{eyes were}} turned, {{as if by}} instinct, to Mr Stevenson. The <b>men</b> <b>seemed</b> {{to feel that the}} issue lay with him.|$|R
6000|$|... "And yet, {{apart from}} his folly in 'sailing under false colours,' as our worthy captain would call it, the <b>man</b> <b>seems</b> well enough." ...|$|R
60|$|Presently the white-haired <b>man</b> <b>seemed</b> to {{recollect}} my presence, {{and came}} up to me.|$|E
60|$|The old <b>man</b> <b>seemed</b> fussy {{and nervous}} and patronizing and disparaging all at once.|$|E
60|$|The red-haired young <b>man</b> <b>seemed</b> but faintly {{interested}} in the vicissitudes of Scrymgeour's interior.|$|E
60|$|On {{the road}} thither {{he came to}} a Kafir kraal, where the <b>men</b> <b>seemed</b> to be engaged in the {{performance}} of a war-dance.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am not {{surprised}} that the captain does not want idlers here, for, except ourselves, every <b>man</b> <b>seems</b> to have his appointed work." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The two <b>men</b> <b>seemed</b> much pleased. It {{was evident}} to them that, {{if they could}} do these things, it would widely add to their reputation.|$|R
60|$|They stared; nobody replied; the {{presence}} of the great <b>man</b> <b>seemed</b> to embarrass and alarm.|$|E
60|$|The <b>man</b> <b>seemed</b> for {{a moment}} to swell,--his eyes to flash fire. Wingate shrugged his shoulders.|$|E
60|$|As the old <b>man</b> <b>seemed</b> indisposed {{to leave}} the churchyard just yet they sat down again.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, the <b>men</b> <b>seem</b> to do that, dear. But cheer up. We've {{only seen}} {{the romance of}} Taormina yet; doubtless it will be commonplace enough to-morrow." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Your <b>man</b> <b>seems</b> to have {{a pretty}} taste in literature," [...] said Sir Thomas to Jimmy. [...] "Well, my dear, {{finished}} your chat with the porter?" ...|$|R
60|$|The muffled thunder {{resembled the}} echo of a distant cannonade below the horizon, and the two <b>men</b> <b>seemed</b> to be {{listening}} to it in sullen silence.|$|R
60|$|The little <b>man</b> <b>seemed</b> {{already to}} have {{considered}} {{that point of}} view in his dispassionate self-confident manner.|$|E
60|$|The <b>man</b> <b>seemed</b> {{as though}} he were about to slam the door, but thought better of it.|$|E
60|$|Meyer took {{no notice}} of his threats; indeed the <b>man</b> <b>seemed</b> so {{exhausted}} {{that he could}} scarcely stand.|$|E
6000|$|... "This {{has gone}} far enough," [...] he whispered. [...] "Those <b>men</b> <b>seem</b> all right and I'm sure will prove our friends. I'm {{going to show}} myself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, {{of course}} not," [...] assented Mrs. Dennant absently--she had found another green-fly [...] "I always think it's painful {{when a young}} <b>man</b> <b>seems</b> so friendless." ...|$|R
2500|$|Perman and Taylor (2010) {{say that}} historians are of two minds on why {{millions}} of <b>men</b> <b>seemed</b> {{so eager to}} fight, suffer and die over four years: ...|$|R
60|$|The <b>man</b> <b>seemed</b> to say this, {{with such}} dreadful hatred, that Oliver awoke with the fear, and started up.|$|E
60|$|Alec fixed {{upon him}} his dark, firm eyes. The <b>man</b> <b>seemed</b> an average sort of person, not without intelligence.|$|E
60|$|The very {{weakening}} of the other <b>man</b> <b>seemed</b> for the moment to give Cecil added courage. He laughed hoarsely.|$|E
6000|$|At {{the mention}} of the word blood, the little <b>men</b> <b>seemed</b> to curl up like cut grass before fire; then Eddo smiled, a sickly smile, and answered: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Anyhow," [...] said Betsy, [...] "the bad <b>man</b> <b>seems</b> truly sorry, {{and if he}} has {{now become}} a good and honest man, we ought to forgive him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, unless Grace Conroy should {{lay claim}} to that title and privilege. The old <b>man</b> <b>seems</b> to have been pretty much divided in his {{property}} and affections." ...|$|R
