Validation of a generated sit-to-stand case study movement showed the lumbar, hip, knee, and ankle joints to be accurate to within 4. 2 degrees across changes in the pace of movement and the designed environment. It is proposed that predictive models can now be generated for other chosen movements by employing the new methodology.

We previously described a Ca[superscript 2 +]-dependent retrograde signaling pathway mediated by postsynaptic Synaptotagmin 4 (Syt 4). To identify proteins involved in postsynaptic exocytosis, we conducted a screen for candidates that disrupted trafficking of a pHluorin-tagged Syt 4 at Drosophila neuromuscular junctions (NMJs). Here we characterize one candidate, the postsynaptic t-SNARE Syntaxin 4 (Syx 4). Analysis of Syx 4 mutants reveals that Syx 4 mediates retrograde signaling, modulating the membrane levels of Syt 4 and the transsynaptic adhesion protein Neuroligin 1 (Nlg 1). Syx 4 -dependent trafficking regulates synaptic development, including controlling synaptic bouton number {{and the ability to}} bud new varicosities in response to acute neuronal stimulation.

40|$|It was {{recently}} {{reported that the}} circadian clock <b>machinery</b> <b>controls</b> plasma levels of factor (F) VII, the serine protease triggering blood coagulation. Here, by exploiting the mouse model, {{this study showed that}} variations of photoperiod (i. e., winter or summer conditions or simulated chronic jetlag conditions) have a strong impact on plasma FVII activity levels. Under conditions mimicking summer or winter photoperiods, FVII activity showed a clear 24 h rhythmicity. Interestingly, mean daily FVII activity levels were significantly reduced in mice exposed to summer photoperiods. Behavioral activity rhythms under both photoperiods were synchronized to LD cycles, and the amount of activity per 24 h was comparable. The authors also investigated the influence of chronic jetlag (CJL) on the FVII activity rhythms, which can be easily mimicked in mice through continuous abrupt shifts in the lighting schedule. The exposure of mice to simulated CJL of either consecutive westward or consecutive westward and eastward flights for 15 days did not abolish the behavioral activity rhythms but was associated with a period significantly different from 24 h. Intriguingly, both types of CJL exerted a strong influence on FVII activity rhythms, which were virtually suppressed. Moreover, the mean daily FVII activity was significantly lower in the CJL than in the winter photoperiod condition. Taken together, these findings in mice provide novel insights into the modulation of FVII activity levels, which might have implications for human pathophysiology...|$|E
40|$|The endosomal sorting complex {{required}} for transport (ESCRT) <b>machinery</b> <b>controls</b> {{the incorporation of}} cargo into intraluminal vesicles of multivesicular bodies. This machinery is used during envelopment of many RNA viruses and some DNA viruses, including herpes simplex virus type 1. Other viruses mature independent of ESCRT components, instead relying on the intrinsic behavior of viral matrix and envelope proteins to drive envelopment. Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) maturation {{has been reported to}} proceed independent of ESCRT components (A. Fraile-Ramos et al. Cell. Microbiol. 9 : 2955 – 2967, 2007). A virus complementation assay was used to evaluate the role of dominant-negative (DN) form of a key ESCRT ATPase, vacuolar protein sorting- 4 (Vps 4 DN) in HCMV replication. Vps 4 DN specifically inhibited viral replication, whereas wild-type– Vps 4 had no effect. In addition, a DN form of charged multivesicular body protein 1 (CHMP 1 DN) was found to inhibit HCMV. In contrast, DN tumor susceptibility gene- 101 (Tsg 101 DN) did not impact viral replication despite the presence of a PTAP motif within pp 150 /ppUL 32, an essential tegument protein involved in the last steps of viral maturation and release. Either Vps 4 DN or CHMP 1 DN blocked viral replication at a step after the accumulation of late viral proteins, suggesting that both are involved in maturation. Both Vps 4 A and CHMP 1 A localized in the vicinity of viral cytoplasmic assembly compartments, sites of viral maturation that develop in CMV-infected cells. Thus, ESCRT machinery is involved in the final steps of HCMV replication...|$|E
40|$|In {{neuronal}} cells the intracellular trafficking <b>machinery</b> <b>controls</b> {{the availability}} of neurotransmitter receptors at the plasma membrane, which is a critical determinant of synaptic strength. Metabotropic c amino-butyric acid (GABA) type B receptors (GABABRs) are neurotransmitter receptors that modulate synaptic transmission by mediating the slow and prolonged responses to GABA. GABABRs are obligatory heteromers constituted by two subunits, GABABR 1 and GABABR 2. GABABR 1 a and GABABR 1 b are the most abundant subunit variants. GABABR 1 b {{is located in the}} somatodendritic domain whereas GABABR 1 a is additionally targeted to the axon. Sushi domains located at the N-terminus of GABABR 1 a constitute the only difference between both variants and are necessary and sufficient for axonal targeting. The precise targeting machinery and the organelles involved in sorting and transport have not been described. Here we demonstrate that GABABRs require the Golgi apparatus for plasma membrane delivery but that axonal sorting and targeting of GABABR 1 a operate in a pre-Golgi compartment. In the axon GABABR 1 a subunits are enriched in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and their dynamic behavior and colocalization with other secretory organelles like the ER-to-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) suggest that they employ a local secretory route. The transport of axonal GABABR 1 a is microtubule-dependent and kinesin- 1, a molecular motor of the kinesin family, determines axonal localization. Considering that progression of GABABRs through the secretory pathway is regulated by an ER retention motif our data contribute to understand the role of the axonal ER in non-canonica...|$|E

In meiosis I, homologous chromosomes segregate and in meiosis 11, sister chromatids split. Much of the same cell cycle <b>machinery</b> <b>controls</b> mitosis and meiosis. However, segregation of homologous chromosomes in meiosis I and progression into meiosis 11 directly after meiosis I necessitate several modifications to the basic cell cycle machinery. In this thesis, I have investigated how cell cycle regulators function during gametogenesis. First, I show that the mitotic exit network, which is a signaling pathway essential for mitotic exit, is dispensable for the meiotic divisions, and in fact signals via a mechanism distinct from mitosis. Second, I present data that the Polo kinase Cdc 5, which activates mitotic exit in budding yeast, has gained additional roles during meiosis 1. I show that CDC 5 {{is required for the}} removal of cohesin from chromosome arms in meiosis I, which is a prerequisite for meiosis I segregation. Despite the central role of CDC 5 in regulating meiosis I, CDC 5 is dispensable during meiosis 11.

The prolyl hy-droxylase domain proteins (PHDs) are oxygen-sensing en-zymes that belong to the evolutionarily conserved superfamily of iron-containing 2 -oxoglutarate–dependent di-oxygenases. This family consists of 3 PHDs (PHD 1 – 3) and the factor inhibiting hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) (FIH). 1 Under well-oxygenated conditions, PHDs hydroxylate con-served prolyl residues of the HIF- subunits, thereby gener-ating a binding site for the von Hippel–Lindau tumor sup-pressor protein, which targets HIF- for proteosomal degradation. When oxygen levels decrease, the hydroxylation activity of the PHDs is reduced, leading to HIF- accumula-tion. On binding to HIF-, the HIF-/ complex translocates and activates transcription of numerous genes, including those regulating survival, metabolism, and angiogenesis. 2 In normoxia, the transcriptional activity of HIF is reduced by hydroxylation of a conserved asparagine residue by FIH. ...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Recent {{advances}} in computer networking and control system technologies present {{an opportunity to}} improve the capability of naval shipboard control systems. Most existing digital machinery contrd systems merely replace one-for-one their analog predecessors. These recent advances motivate rethink-ing the basic role and architecture of shipboard controls. Traditional machinery system control has remained largely sepa-rate from combat systems and other ship information systems. Existing machinery control systems have concentrated on four functions: machinery status, contrd, system stability, and fault response. To implement these functions, custom systems have been designed, built and debugged for each class of ship. This lack of commonality has been expensive in terms of development costs, maintenance costs over the &time of the ship, and also the unrealized benefits stemming from prohibitive costs of adapting machinery contrds {{to take advantage of}} emerging technologies. This paper proposes a new paradigm for developing a shipboard contrd system based upon a functional decomposition of ships ’ missions that leads to de- tech-nology independent interface standards. Multiple vendors may be able to indepen-dently develop control system hardware and software elements adhering to such interface standards without a pnon knowl-edge of a particular ship application, hdmg to the ability to develop a total ship control system with low risk by integrating proven hardware and software elements to meet specific ship design requirements. With this new concept, other functions not llormauy associated with <b>machinery</b> <b>controls</b> are feasible: spontaneous reconfi-guration after a damage event, integrated training, condition based maintenance plan-ning, data archiving, operator assistance, and configuration management. This new ap-proach may also allow for the integration of machinery contrds into a total ship contrd system with seamless support for combat systems. This new shipboard contrd para-digm promises to speed control system development, improve performance, facili-tate maintenance and modernization, and lead to lower life cycle costs...|$|E
