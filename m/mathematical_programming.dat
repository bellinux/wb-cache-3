In particular, {{with the help of}} a penalty technique, we propose a combined smoothing implicit programming and penalty method for the here-and-now decision problem and a comprehensive convergence theory is also included. Furthermore, we remark that similar discussion applies to the lower-level wait-and-see model as well.

40|$|International audienceThe Simple Assembly Line Balancing Problem (SALBP) {{has been}} {{extensively}} examined in the literature. Various <b>mathematical</b> <b>programs</b> {{have been developed to}} solve SALBP type- 1 (minimizing the number of workstations, m, for a given cycle time, ct) and SALBP type- 2 (minimizing ct given m). Usually, an initial pre-process is carried out to calculate the range of workstations to which a task i may be assigned, {{in order to reduce the}} number of variables of task-workstation assignment. This paper presents a more effective <b>mathematical</b> <b>program</b> than those released to date to solve SALBP- 1 and SALBP- 2. The key idea is to introduce additional constraints in the <b>mathematical</b> <b>program,</b> based on the fact that the range of workstations to which a task i may be assigned depends either on the upper bound on the number of workstations or on the upper bound on the cycle time (for SALBP- 1 and SALBP- 2, respectively).
