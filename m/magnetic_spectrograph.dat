40|$|A {{collaboration}} experiment between i'ata Institute, Bombay, Osaka City University and Durham University {{has been}} performed underground {{at a depth}} of 7500 m. w. e. in Kolar Gold Fields, South India, primarily to study muons produced by the interactions of cosmic ray neutrinos. The results obtained are described and analysed. The rate of neutrino-induced muons {{has been found to be}} less than predicted for several widely different assumptions made about the inelastic interaction cross section above 10 G-eV (the limit of the machine data). However the results clearly show the importance of the inelastic interaction and suggest that the cross section continues to rise to ɝ 30 G-eV/c whilst the fraction of energy taken by the muon falls. The energies of two neutrino-induced muons have been measured with <b>magnetic</b> <b>spectrographs</b> and neutrino interactions inside the detectors have been recorded along with unambiguous examples of upv/ard moving muons. Muons of atmospheric origin have also been detected and both their intensity and angular distribution have been established and described by appropriate expressions. Their energy spectra and meajn energies have been predicted and compared with those derived from observations made of their electromagnetic accompaniment. The celestial co-ordinates of the arrival directions of neutrino- induced muons may be suggestive of a possible point source of extra-terrestrial neutrinos and these of the atmospheric muons have shown a possible large scale anisotropy in the southern celestial hemisphere, the implications of which are discussed.

40|$|Details of two solid iron <b>magnetic</b> <b>spectrographs,</b> {{incorporating}} neon flash tubes, with m. d. m. 's. of 300 GeV/o and 1950 GeV/c are presented, as are {{the results}} on the µ(^+) /µ(^-) ratio in the zenith angular ranges 77. º 5 - 90 º, and 82. 5 º - 90 º based on samples of 10832 particles and 2167 particles respectively, obtained with these instruments. In the energy region where comparison {{with the work of}} other authors can be made agreement obtains. The overall results confirm, in general, previous values below 200 GeV but do not show any great evidence for a sharp minimum in the ratio in the region of 50 - 100 G-eV as reported by some authors. At higher energies the present results do not show a rapidly increasing ratio, as was expected from an extrapolation of earlier measurements. A review of all published measurements on the µ(^+) /µ(^-) ratio is presented, which suggests an approximately constant ratio from E- 3 - 10 (^ 3) GeV, of 1, 20 - 1. 25. In an effort to give a theoretical interpretation of the results it is shown that pion production within the framework of a statistical model based on our knowledge of nucleon interactions at high energies will not account for the experimental data. The effect of, and evidence for, the production of kaons, subject to certain assumptions, is investigated and it is concluded that, under the assumptions considered, the adopted value of the K/π ratio is not sufficient to account for the data in the region Eµ= 10 - 50 G-eV. The effect of other dynamical models such as the isobar model and the O. P, 3. model are considered. It is argued that the production of T = 1 / 2 isobars with a slowly decreasing cross-section, combined with the other features of nucleon interactions as observed at accelerator energies, is sufficient to account for the present experimental position when the errors in the experimental data are taken into account, but none of several proposed models for particle production in high energy interactions can be uniquely {{selected on the basis of}} the results...|$|R
40|$|AgCl {{crystals}} were irradiated with monochromatic β-rays in a <b>magnetic</b> β-ray <b>spectrograph.</b> The {{results show}} that under suitable experimental conditions in the crystal all β-rays of a certain energy cause ionisation pulses of the same value within the errors of measurement. The magnitude of an ionisation pulse {{is proportional to the}} energy of the β-particle. This means that the amount of energy necessary for the formation of one conduction electron is independent of the energy of the β-rays. This amount was found to be 7, 6 eV. The measurements of the ionization pulses caused in AgCl by α-rays showed that many of the α-particles caused an ionization pulse smaller than normal. We ascribed this effect to a thin irregular surface layer which is less effective than the crystal's interior. Many of the crystals we investigated showed a thicker surface layer. This layer also influenced the ionization by β-particles, which then showed the same effect as the α-rays. The nature and the circumstances under which this hypothetical surface layer appears or can be removed are not yet clear and still form a point of investigation...|$|R

40|$|Part I: A {{study has}} been made of the unusual {{behavior}} that solid hexamminecobalt(III) chloride exhibits when examined by the technique of nuclear magnetic resonance absorption. From the examples of substances exhibiting similar behavior to this one, the conclusion is reached that some sort of internal motion is taking place within the solid. On the basis {{of the structure of the}} hexamminecobalt(III) ion, and from information gathered on related ions, it is postulated that the motion involved is the rotation of the whole complex ion in the crystal lattice. From a study of the nuclear magnetic resonance absorption line width for the protons in the complex ion as a function of temperature, the motion is described in terms of a rate process. The general theory of nuclear magnetic resonance is discussed, and in particular the application of this technique to the study of rate processes. The design and construction of a nuclear <b>magnetic</b> resonance <b>spectrograph</b> are described. Part II: An instrument has been developed for automatic control of coulometric titrations employing the dual indicator electrode amperometric end point. The instrument is capable of detecting the end of the titration and stopping the generation, freeing the analyst of this task. The titration is stopped at a pre-set indicator current, either as a "dead stop" end point or as a preliminary operation to determining the exact end point by extrapolation of the post end point current to zero. The operation of the instrument on three different types of coulometric titrations is described. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We {{study the}} {{influence}} of the regular component of the Galactic magnetic field (GMF) on the arrival directions of ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECRs). We find that deflections in the GMF cannot be neglected even for E = 10 20 eV protons, especially for trajectories along the Galactic plane or crossing the Galactic center region. Thus the GMF {{could be used as a}} spectrograph to discriminate among different source models and/or primaries of UHECRs, if its structure would be known with sufficient precision. We compare several GMF models introduced in the literature and discuss for the example of the AGASA data set how the significance of small-scale clustering or correlations with given astrophysical sources are affected by the GMF. We point out that the non-uniform exposure to the extragalactic sky induced by the GMF should be taken into account estimating the significance of potential (auto-) correlation signals. Simple cuts are presented that allow to minimize the effects of GMF uncertainties in the analysis of UHECR arrival directions. PACS numbers: 98. 35. Eg, 98. 70.

40|$|The {{importance}} of studying the radiations emitted by nuclei {{can be understood}} by considering {{the kind of information}} that can be obtained from such a study. Much information can be obtained with a pair spectrograph. The pair process is particularly suited for studying high energy (> 3 Mev) transitions since pair production is increasingly probable at higher energies, and since this method makes possible the resolution of complicated spectra. The magnetic lens spectrometer is suited for pair measurements because of its large efficiency for transmitting pairs relative to most other types of spectrometers. Previous measurements have been made with magnetic lens pair spectrometers by Bame and Baggett (Ba 51 a) and by D. E. Alburger (Al 52). The purpose of this work was to use a <b>magnetic</b> lens pair <b>spectrograph</b> of improved design to study the pair spectra from some light nuclear reactions. This paper describes a number of experiments which were performed to investigate the pair spectra resulting from the deuteron bombardment of B 10, C 12, and F 19, and the proton bombardment of B 11 and F 19.

This array {{is used to}} study extensive air showers of sizes ranging from 10 (^ 4) to 10 (^ 6) and also to supply information required for the hadron studies carried out using a flash-tube chamber placed in the Cosmic Ray laboratory of the University of Durham. The array was also used to trigger the <b>Magnetic</b> Automated Research <b>Spectrograph</b> which had its location in that laboratory. Eight liquid scintillation counters {{have been added to}} the initial fourteen plastic detectors. The array detecting elements are located in a triangular geometry around the Physics Department.

The array could be triggered in different ways depending upon the mode chosen and upon other experiments present. Results arc presented showing the effect of the inclusion of the liquid counters on the accuracy with which the analysis programme determines the location of the shower core and on the shower size value resulting from the data analysis. The depth of the liquid in the liquid counters was 20 cm which means that these liquid detectors responded to the photons and nuclear active particles of the extensive air showers. The lateral distributions of the electron-photon component of EAS as measured by one of the liquid counters and one of the plastic detectors (5 cm thick) are deduced and compared with the results of other experiments. The present results show good agreement with those of other workers when the effect of the thickness of the used detectors is taken into account, except for the results of Hasagawa (1962).
