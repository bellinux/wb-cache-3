500|$|By {{the middle}} of November the British Royal Family were so {{interested}} in the story that they sent St.André and Samuel Molyneux, secretary to the Prince of Wales, to investigate. [...] Apparently, they were not disappointed; arriving on 15November they were taken by Howard to see Toft, who within hours delivered a rabbit's torso.

[...] St.André then performed a <b>medical</b> <b>examination</b> <b>on</b> Toft, and concluded that the rabbits were bred in her Fallopian tubes. [...] In the doctors' absence, Toft later that day reportedly delivered the torso of another rabbit, which the two also examined. [...] They again returned that evening to find Toft again displaying violent contractions. [...] A further <b>medical</b> <b>examination</b> followed, and St.André delivered some rabbit skin, followed a few minutes later by a rabbit's head. [...] Both men inspected the egested pieces of flesh, noting that some resembled the body parts of a cat.|$|R
50|$|Eventually, the {{two sides}} settled on payment of $5,000 hotel costs {{for the period of}} Hunziker's incarceration, which Hunziker's family, rather than the government, paid. Richardson stated that the money was not the major trigger for Hunziker's release; rather, he speculated that the North Korean side {{realized}} they had made a major mistake during the incident where a submarine full of their commandos landed on South Korean soil, which occurred only weeks after Hunziker's arrest, and hoped to reduce tensions and regain aid. He also stated that the North Korean military had been opposed to Hunziker's release. Hunziker was first flown to Yokota Air Base in Japan for a <b>medical</b> <b>examination</b> <b>on</b> November 27, where he was found to have two red marks on his neck, possibly rope burns; North Korea claimed he attempted to hang himself while in custody.

In the UK, the issue of resits has become of particular interest since the General Medical Council issued a consultation and is considering limiting the number of attempts candidates may make at examinations.
