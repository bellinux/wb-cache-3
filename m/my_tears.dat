25|$|In {{an essay}} written {{two years before}} his death, Dick {{described}} how he learned from his Episcopalian priest that an important scene in Flow <b>My</b> <b>Tears,</b> the Policeman Said – involving its other main character, the eponymous Police General Felix Buckman, was very similar to a scene in Acts of the Apostles, a book of the New Testament. Film director Richard Linklater discusses this novel in his film Waking Life, which begins with a scene reminiscent of another Dick novel, Time Out of Joint.|$|E
25|$|Born in Illinois {{before moving}} to California, Dick began {{publishing}} science fiction stories in the 1950s, initially finding little commercial success. His 1962 alternative history novel The Man in the High Castle earned Dick early acclaim, including a Hugo Award for Best Novel. He followed with science fiction novels such as Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? (1968) and Ubik (1969). His 1974 novel Flow <b>My</b> <b>Tears,</b> the Policeman Said won the John W. Campbell Memorial Award for best novel. Following a series of religious experiences in February–March 1974, Dick's work engaged more explicitly with issues of theology, philosophy, {{and the nature of}} reality, as in such novels as A Scanner Darkly (1977) and VALIS (1981). A collection of his non-fiction writing on these themes was published posthumously as The Exegesis of Philip K. Dick (2011). He died in 1982 of a stroke, aged 53.|$|E

500|$|Stockhausen's fame is also {{reflected}} in works of literature. For example, he is mentioned in Philip K. Dick's 1974 novel Flow <b>My</b> <b>Tears,</b> the Policeman Said [...] and in Thomas Pynchon's 1966 novel The Crying of Lot 49. The Pynchon novel features [...] "The Scope", a bar with [...] "a strict electronic music policy". Protagonist Oedipa Maas asks [...] "a hip graybeard" [...] about a [...] "sudden chorus of whoops and yibbles" [...] coming out of [...] "a kind of jukebox." [...] He replies, [...] "That's by Stockhausen... the early crowd tends to dig your Radio Cologne sound. Later on we really swing" [...]|$|E
500|$|The lyrical {{content of}} [...] "Shame" [...] {{revolves}} around [...] "the {{breakdown in the}} relationship" [...] that Williams and Barlow experienced after the former left Take That. Williams starts the song with the line, [...] "Well there's three versions of this story / Mine and yours and then the truth", whilst Barlow responds channeling his original attempt for reconciliation, [...] "I read your mind and tried to call / <b>My</b> <b>tears</b> could fill the Albert Hall." [...] Stuff.co.nz described the lyrics as [...] "happy ending" [...] and [...] "patch things up", when specifically singing the lines, [...] "I don't recall the reasons why, I must have meant them at the time, is this the sound of sweet surrender?" ...|$|E
500|$|... "Government Hooker" [...] {{begins as}} Gaga sings in an operatic fashion—backed by {{industrial}} synthesizers—and transcends into an electro-pop Gregorian chant. The song then progresses into the chorus: [...] "I {{can be good}} / I can be sex / I can be anything / I can be everything / I can be mom." [...] A male vocalist accompanies the singer's lyrics, [...] "Unless {{you want to be}} man / Unless you want to hold hands / Unless you want to be dad". After Gaga sings [...] "I'm gonna drink <b>my</b> <b>tears</b> and cry / 'cos I know you love me baby" [...] during the techno-inspired bridge, she alludes to the alleged affair between Marilyn Monroe and John F. Kennedy with the lyrics [...] "Put your hands on me / John F. Kennedy / I'll make you squeal baby", singing in an impassive and monotonous manner.|$|E

500|$|Austen {{wrote in}} her first {{surviving}} letter to her sister Cassandra that Lefroy was [...] "very gentlemanlike, good-looking, pleasant young man". She called him her [...] "friend" [...] and explained that on this account Cassandra must be anxious {{to know more about}} her new [...] "friend". Five days later in another letter, Austen wrote she expected an [...] "offer" [...] from her [...] "friend" [...] and that [...] "I shall refuse him, however, unless he promises to give away his white coat", going on to write [...] "I will confide myself in the future to Mr Tom Lefroy, for whom I don't give a sixpence" [...] and refuse all others. The next day, Austen wrote: [...] "The day will come on which I flirt my last with Tom Lefroy and when you receive this it will be all over. <b>My</b> <b>tears</b> flow as I write at this melancholy idea".|$|E
500|$|King Henry {{took part}} in the jousting, {{sporting}} Diane's black-and-white colours. He defeated the dukes of Guise and Nemours, but the young Gabriel, comte de Montgomery, knocked him half out of the saddle. Henry insisted on riding against Montgomery again, and this time, Montgomery's lance shattered in the king's face. Henry reeled out of the clash, his face pouring blood, with splinters [...] "of a good bigness" [...] sticking out of his eye and head. Catherine, Diane, and Prince Francis all fainted. Henry was carried to the Château de Tournelles, where five splinters of wood were extracted from his head, one of which had pierced his eye and brain. Catherine stayed by his bedside, but Diane kept away, [...] "for fear", {{in the words of a}} chronicler, [...] "of being expelled by the Queen". For the next ten days, Henry's state fluctuated. At times he even felt well enough to dictate letters and listen to music. Slowly, however, he lost his sight, speech, and reason, and on 10 July 1559 he died, aged 40. From that day, Catherine took a broken lance as her emblem, inscribed with the words [...] "lacrymae hinc, hinc dolor" [...] ("from this come <b>my</b> <b>tears</b> and my pain"), and wore black mourning in memory of Henry.|$|E
500|$|The ninth track [...] "The Hook Up" [...] has a reggae {{feel and}} {{features}} Spears {{singing in a}} Jamaican Patois accent. The ballad [...] "Shadow" [...] talks about how reminders of a lover can still linger after he’s gone. [...] "Brave New Girl" [...] lyrics talk about a young woman finding her passion and losing inhibitions. Backed by choppy, electro-funk beats, she sings in a bouncy near-rap, [...] "She's gonna pack her bags, she's going to find her way, she's going to get right out of this/ She don't want New York, she don't want L.A., she's {{going to find that}} special kiss." [...] The song incorporates elements of the music of No Doubt, Blondie and Madonna. [...] "Everytime" [...] begins with a piano introduction accompanying Spears's breathy vocals, which build from soft to strong throughout the song. [...] "Everytime" [...] lyrics are a plea for forgiveness for inadvertently hurting a former lover. In the song, the singer explains she feels unable to continue in lines such as [...] "Everytime I try to fly I fall / Without my wings I feel so small". During an interview with MTV, Spears said about the song, [...] "It's about heartbreak, it's about your first love, your first true love. That's something all people can relate to, because you all have that first love that you think you're going to be with the rest of your life." [...] When asked if [...] "Everytime" [...] was about Timberlake, she responded [...] "I'll let the song speak for itself." [...] The Rishi Rich's Desi Kulcha Remix of [...] "Me Against the Music" [...] removes the original melody of the song and adds a clattering backbeat and Punjabi shouts. In [...] "The Answer", Spears sings that her lover is the answer to all her needs: [...] "Who can hold me tight, keep me warm through the night? / Who can wipe <b>my</b> <b>tears</b> when it's wrong, make it right? / Who can give me love till I'm satisfied? / Who's the one I need in my life?". In [...] "Don't Hang Up", she pleads on the phone for her lover to keep her satisfied long-distance.|$|E
