25|$|The <b>Marsh</b> <b>Arabs</b> or Ma'dãn are a {{group of}} Arabs who number 125,000 to 150,000 {{who live in the}} Mesopotamian Marshes in {{southern}} Iraq.|$|E
25|$|The {{majority}} of the Maʻdān were displaced either to areas adjacent to the drained marshes, abandoning their traditional lifestyle in favour of conventional agriculture, or to towns and camps {{in other areas of}} Iraq. An estimated 80,000 to 120,000 fled to refugee camps in Iran. The <b>Marsh</b> <b>Arabs,</b> who numbered about half a million in the 1950s, have dwindled to as few as 20,000 in Iraq. Only 1,600 of them were estimated to still be living on traditional dibins by 2003.|$|E
25|$|The most {{impressive}} and famous of Sumerian buildings are the ziggurats, large layered platforms that supported temples. Sumerian cylinder seals also depict houses built from reeds not unlike those {{built by the}} <b>Marsh</b> <b>Arabs</b> of Southern Iraq until as recently as 400 CE. The Sumerians also developed the arch, which enabled them to develop a strong type of dome. They built this by constructing and linking several arches. Sumerian temples and palaces made use of more advanced materials and techniques, such as buttresses, recesses, half columns, and clay nails.|$|E

5000|$|By 1928 the Levies {{had become}} entirely Assyrian. The <b>Marsh</b> <b>Arab</b> {{battalion}} became the 7th Battalion of the Iraqi Army. The force then expanded rapidly and {{became known as}} [...] "Shabanas", a Turkish word meaning a semi-military gendarmerie. Its primary duty was now to protect Royal Air Force bases in Iraq.|$|R
25|$|Qusay Hussein (17 May 1966 – 22 July 2003), was Saddam's second– and, {{after the}} mid-1990s, his favorite– son. Qusay was {{believed}} to have been Saddam's later intended successor, as he was less erratic than his older brother and kept a low profile. He was second in command of the military (behind his father) and ran the elite Iraqi Republican Guard and the SSO. He {{was believed to}} have ordered the army to kill thousands of rebelling <b>Marsh</b> <b>Arabs</b> and was instrumental in suppressing Shi'ite rebellions in the mid-1990s. He was married once and had three children.|$|E
2500|$|As vice {{chairman}} of the Revolutionary Command Council, al-Douri was involved in the wars against Iran and Kuwait. During the 1988–1989 Al-Anfal Campaign, al-Douri was said to have ordered Ali Hassan al-Majid (aka 'Chemical Ali') to use Mustard and Sarin nerve gas on Kurdish fighters in Halabja. He was complicit in the invasion of Saudi Arabia and the attack on the town of Khafji in January 1991. During the 1991 uprisings in Iraq, he was involved in the suppression of the revolt led by the Iraqi <b>marsh</b> <b>Arabs.</b> When the Kurds rebelled again in 1991, al-Douri warned them [...] "If you have forgotten Halabja, I would like to remind you that we are ready to repeat the operation." ...|$|E
2500|$|In Islam he {{is known}} as Uzair (...) [...] He was {{mentioned}} in the Qur'an. Although he was not mentioned {{as one of the}} Prophets of Islam, he is considered as one of them by some Muslim scholars, based on Islamic traditions. His tomb at Al-ʻUzair {{on the banks of the}} Tigris near Basra, Iraq, is a pilgrimage site for the local <b>Marsh</b> <b>Arabs.</b> Many Islamic scholars and modern Western academics do not view Uzair as [...] "Ezra"; for example Professor Gordon Darnell Newby associates Uzair with Enoch and Metatron. On this Timothy Winter (Abdal Hakim Murad) and Gordon Darnell Newby [...] associate Uzair again with Enoch (ancestor of Noah) and by extension Metatron the creator-angel or [...] "lesser Yahweh".|$|E
50|$|In {{the later}} twentieth century a third main {{occupation}} entered <b>Marsh</b> <b>Arab</b> life; the weaving of reed mats {{on a commercial}} scale. Though they often earned far more than workers in agriculture, weavers were looked down upon by both Maʻdān and farmers alike: however, financial concerns meant that it gradually gained acceptance as a respectable profession.|$|R

50|$|The Iraq Levies traced {{their history}} to the Arab Scouts {{organized}} in 1915 by Major J. I. Eadie, of the British Indian Army {{who served as a}} Special Service Officer in the Muntafiq Division in Mesopotamia. He recruited forty mounted Arabs from the tribes round Nasiriyeh, for duty under the Intelligence Department as bodyguard for political officers in southern and central Iraq. By 1918 the Arab Scouts increased to 5,467 <b>Arabs,</b> Kurds, Turkoman, <b>Marsh</b> <b>Arab</b> and Assyrian militia.|$|R
2500|$|Up to 1921 the Levies had {{consisted}} of Arabs, Kurds, Turkomans. Now that Iraq Army {{was to be}} formed, the Arabs {{would be required to}} join it rather than to go to Levies. It was decided to enlist Assyrians in the Levies. In July 1922 Orders were issued in which no more Arabs were to be enlisted as they were required to join the new Iraqi Army, those serving could not re-engage, A 1922 Treaty between Great Britain and Iraq allowed for the continued existence of the Levies as [...] "local forces of the Imperial garrison" [...] and that its members were [...] "members of the British Forces who are inhabitants of Iraq". [...] By 1923 the ethnic composition of the Iraq Levies was half Assyrian and half Kurd, plus an attached battalion of <b>Marsh</b> <b>Arabs</b> and a few Turkomans. [...] The original Levies were not Assyrians until 1928 when the levies became entirely Assyrian.|$|E

5000|$|As {{with most}} tribes of {{southern}} Iraq, the main authority was the tribal shaikh. To this day, the shaikh of a <b>Marsh</b> <b>Arab</b> group will collect a tribute from his tribe {{in order to}} maintain the mudhif, the tribal guesthouse, which acts as the political, social, judicial and religious centre of Marsh Arabic life. The mudhif is used as a place to settle disputes, to carry out diplomacy with other tribes and as a gathering point for religious and other celebrations. It is also the place where visitors are offered hospitality. Although the tribal shaykh was the principal figure, each Maʻdān village (which may have contained members of several different tribes) would also follow the authority of the hereditary qalit [...] "headman" [...] of a tribe's particular section.|$|R
500|$|The {{scene in}} which Daenerys has to eat a horse's heart was filmed in The Paint Hall studio in Belfast. There, the {{production}} built the Dothraki temple in which the scene is set – a large semicircular structure of wood and woven reeds, inspired by <b>Marsh</b> <b>Arab</b> constructions. [...] The heart actress Emilia Clarke ate was, according to Weiss, [...] "basically a giant, three-pound gummi bear covered in fake sugar blood – which has the added attraction of drawing real flies." [...] Through repeated takes, Clarke did have to eat much of the sugary heart. She said that it tasted of bleach and was made tough and gristly {{by the addition of}} valves made from [...] "something like dried pasta." [...] Clarke did not have to act in the shots {{at the end of the}} {{scene in which}} Daenerys almost throws up the last bit of heart, as she was indeed close to vomiting at that point.|$|R

50|$|The {{way of life}} of the <b>Marsh</b> <b>Arabs</b> {{was later}} {{described}} by the explorer Wilfred Thesiger in his classic The <b>Marsh</b> <b>Arabs</b> (1964). Thesiger lived with the <b>Marsh</b> <b>Arabs</b> {{for months at a}} time over a seven-year period (1951-1958), building excellent relationships with virtually all he met, and recording the details of day-to-day life in various regions of the marshes. Many of the areas that he visited have since been drained. Gavin Maxwell, the Scottish naturalist, travelled with Thesiger through the marshes in 1956 and published an account of their travels in his 1957 book A Reed Shaken by the Wind (later republished under the title People of the Reeds). The journalist and travel writer Gavin Young followed in Thesiger's footsteps, writing Return to the Marshes: Life with the <b>Marsh</b> <b>Arabs</b> of Iraq (1977; reissued 2009).|$|E
40|$|In {{one of the}} {{greatest}} ecological disasters of our time, the ancient marshlands of Mesopotamia are systematically being converted to dry salt flats as a result of human mismanagement of the regions water resources. Landsat satellite imagery reveals that in the last 10 years, wetlands that once covered as much as 20, 000 square km in parts of Iraq and Iran have been reduced to a small fraction of their original size. The authors of a new report released by the United Nations Environment Programmes (UNEP) at the 11 th Stockholm Water Symposium on August 13, 2001, warn that the marshlands could completely disappear within the next 3 - 5 years unless dramatic steps are taken immediately to reverse the damage being done. The UNEP Executive Director described the wetlands condition as a major environmental catastrophe that will be remembered as one of humanitys worst engineered disasters. He noted that the tragic loss of this rare wetland has occurred in approximately the same period since world leaders pledged to safeguard the environment at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (the Earth Summit) held in Rio de Janeiro in 1992. Regarded by historians as one of the cradles of civilization, the Mesopotamian Fertile Crescent has supported <b>Marsh</b> <b>Arab</b> society for millennia. But through the damming and siphoning off of waters from the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers, the countries of Iran, Iraq, Turkey, and Syria have decimated the ecosystem and, with it, a culture rooted in the dawn of human history (dating back to ancient Sumeria about 5, 000 years ago).

50|$|The <b>Marsh</b> <b>Arabs</b> are {{the primary}} {{inhabitants}} of the Mesopotamian Marshes and are the descendants of ancient Sumerians, as their civilization dates back 5000 years. They live in secluded villages of elaborate reed houses throughout the marshes, often only reached by boat. Fish, rice cultivation, water buffalo and other resources are also used in their daily lives. In the 1950s, there were an estimated 500,000 <b>Marsh</b> <b>Arabs.</b> This population shrank to about 20,000 following the draining and Saddam's violent reprisals, and between 80,000 and 120,000 fled to neighboring Iran.
