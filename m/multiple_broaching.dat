500|$|Pot broaches are cut {{the inverse}} of an {{internal}} broach; they cut the outside diameter of a cylindrical workpiece. They are named after the pot looking fixture in which the broaches are mounted; the fixture {{is often referred to}} as a [...] "pot". The pot is designed to hold <b>multiple</b> <b>broaching</b> tools concentrically over its entire length. The broach is held stationary while the workpiece is pushed or pulled through it. This has replaced hobbing for some involute gears and cutting external splines and slots.|$|E
5|$|Slot broaches (G & H) are {{for cutting}} slots of various {{dimensions}} at high production rates. Slot broaching is much quicker than milling {{when more than}} one slot needs to be machined, because <b>multiple</b> <b>broaches</b> can be run through the part {{at the same time}} on the same broaching machine.|$|R
30|$|The {{final stage}} of this {{procedure}} identifies and maps the antecedent and subsequent connections between criticisms and demonstrates that many criticisms of Alexanderâ€™s theory have roots in his idiosyncratic ontological and epistemological positions. The phenomenon wherein several broad criticisms <b>broach</b> <b>multiple</b> hierarchical levels, offers a useful starting point for this mapping. In other cases, the literature discusses similar criticisms {{in the context of}} different hierarchical levels which provides a basis for mapping, while in a small number of cases a direct logical connection means that if the higher criticism occurs then the lower criticism also occurs. Regardless of which approach informs the identification of antecedent and subsequent criticisms, the decision regarding whether a connections exists is based on an interpretative analysis rather than a quantifiable metric. In some cases one criticism is the antecedent of a single criticism within a thematic group and in other cases one criticism is the antecedent of the entire group. These differences are represented in the diagrams by the connecting arrow either pointing to the circle containing a criticism number or the arrow pointing to the dotted outline of a thematic group.|$|R
