40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the results of}} high resolution study of the Late Badenian calcareous nannofossils from the Studienka Formation of the Vienna Basin, locality Devínska Nová Ves – clay pit (section DNV 1). Results are based on quantitative data of nannofossil assemblages from the sixty nine samples of the studied profile. The age of sediments was determined as Late Badenian and correlated with NN 6 – Discoaster exilis Zone. Abundance of the species Holodiscolithus <b>macroporus</b> was noticed, quantified and interpreted for the first time. Abundance patterns indicate: (1) nearshore environment with nutrient supply (prevailing of small Reticulofenestra over Coccolithus pelagicus); (2) cooling trend (by abundance of Holodiscolithus <b>macroporus,</b> Coccolithus pelagicus; low abundance of sphenoliths and rare discoasterids); (3) eutrophy (local enrichment of species Helicosphaera and Syracosphaera pulchra); (4) salinity decrease (higher number of Braarudosphaera bigelowii bigelowii, B. bigelowii parvula, Micrantholithus flos and M. vesper); (5) higher turbulence of palaeoenvironment (locally higher abundance of helicospherids); (6) signal of higher erosion rate (local increase of reworked nannofossils). Cluster analysis according to ecological demands {{was performed on the}} assemblage data. Four groups related to different temperature and trophic conditions have been distinguished...|$|E
40|$|New {{records of}} water mites {{of the genus}} Monatractides K. Viets (Acari: Hydrachnidia, Torrenticolidae) from streams in Thailand are presented. One species, Monatractides gledhilli, new to science is described; a first {{description}} of the male is given for M. circuloides (Halík); first records from Thailand are given for Monatractides neoapratima (Wiles), M. circuloides (Halík), M. kyphophorus (K.

30|$|Three subfacies are {{recognized}} within the inner ramp facies association at the uppermost {{parts of the}} study sequence, which includes bioclastic miliolids green algae packstone, miliolid-intraclast bioclasts and carbonate mudstones (laminated mudstone, fossiliferous mudstone and algal mudstones, with rudist, Orbitoides media, Orbitoides apiculata, Omphalocyclus <b>macroporus,</b> Dasycladaceae and echinoderms). Ross (1992) interpreted these sediments as “back-reef gravel”, which formed small island similar to the reef flats of Holocene pacific reefs or shingle reef islands of the Great Barrier Reef. The upper most part of this facie shows, occasionally, reworked rudist fragment within clastic-rich bed that is intercalated with red clastic, possibly point to the last appearance of rudist and other Maastrichtian fauna and flora, and termination of the Maastrichtian green house, just close to Cretaceous/Tertiary boundary.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe limnic ostracode Frambocythere tumiensis zagrosensis subsp. nov. (Limnocytheridae, Timiriaseviinae), {{has been}} found {{for the first time}} in Iran. The strata {{containing}} this species are in the lower part of the Tarbur Formation in the interior Fars of the Zagros Mountains. The Late Maastrichtian age is indicated by rudists, larger foraminifers (Omphalocyclus <b>macroporus,</b> Loftusia spp.) and planktonic foraminifers (Contusotruncana contusa-Racemiguembelina fructicosa Zone) present in the upper part of the Tarbur Formation. The Maastrichtian age is confirmed by the occurrence in the same strata of the charophytes Platychara shanii, Peckichara cristellata and Stephanochara cf. producta. The genus Frambocythere Colin, 1980, was until now known mostly from the Upper Maastrichtian to Middle Eocene of southern Europe, India and China, as well as the Albian of the Democratic Republic of Congo. The presence of Frambocythere gr. tumiensis in Iran is therefore a newly recognized link between southern Europe and the Far East (China) ...|$|E
40|$|The stratigraphic {{positions}} of the Wadi Dukhan and Al Uwayliah formations are reviewed. Diagnostic Maastrichtian larger foraminiferal species from the Wadi Dukhan Formation in well B 7 – 41 (Cyrenaica) and in well U 2 – 6 (northeastern Sirt Basin) are illustrated for the fi rst time. These species are Omphalo-cyclus <b>macroporus</b> (Lamarck), Siderolites cf. calcitrapoides Lamarck and Orbitoides cf. media (d’Archiac). Following the rules of nomenclature, the type section of the Al Uwayliah Formation should be con-sidered a composite stratotype. The section east of al Uwayliah village is the holostratotype (upper part of the formation) and the Jardas al Jarrari section is the parastratotype (lower part of the forma-tion). The combined thickness of the two component stratotypes seems to be too thin to represent the whole Paleocene Series. Palaeontologic evidence also suggests that parts of the Paleocene standard foraminiferal zones are not represented in {{either of the two}} component stratotypes. Most probably, a middle part of the Al Uwayliah Formation, below the holostratotype and above the parastratotyp...|$|E
40|$|The {{uppermost}} Cretaceous (upper CampanianeMaastrichtian) marine {{deposits of}} the central south Pyrenees host a rich larger benthic foraminiferal fauna and several rudist-rich levels. These marine deposits are directly overlain by the continental facies of the Aren and Tremp Formations, which are famous for their fossil dinosaur remains. Larger benthic foraminiferal distribution documents an important faunal turnover in all the carbonate platform environments within the photic zone, from open marine to littoral areas. Biostratigraphy indicates that this turnover occurred close to the Campanian- Maastrichtian boundary. This is also confirmed by strontium isotope stratigraphy which indicates an earliest Maastrichtian age for {{the appearance of the}} larger benthic foraminiferal assemblage constituted by Lepidorbitoides socialis, Clypeorbis mammillata, Wannierina cataluniensis, Orbitoides gruenbachensis, Siderolites aff. calcitrapoides, Fascispira colomi, Omphalocyclus <b>macroporus</b> and Laffiteina mengaudi. In particular, a numerical age of 71 Ma is obtained for the Hippurites radiosus level, just a few meters below the first continental deposits of the Aren sensu stricto Formation. The youngest marine sediments {{of the central}} south Pyrenees are early Maastrichtian in age. This is also an important constraint for the age of the end-Cretaceous dinosaur fossil localities of the Tremp basin...|$|E
30|$|The middle {{parts of}} the Aqra {{formation}} were deposited in lower energy settings with more frequent evidence of reefal conditions, reflecting the ramp settings of shallow marine, warm and relatively stable conditions. The common patchy reef builders are the giant Hippurites (rudists), giant gastropods such as Acteonella and Turritileds, and giant echinodermata. The giant Gryphaea, within massive limestone, is about 3 – 10  m thick (Fig.  6, 4 – 8). They are also combined with large foraminiferal assemblages of Loftusia, Omphalocyclus and Orbitoides. Rudist bafflestone ramp facies reaches its maximum thickness in the imbricated zone, as in the Kona massi and Bazageer sections, it is about 100  m thick, which shows a reduction to 50 m at Miran well and recorded from the Khalakan sections. Microfossils are large benthic foraminifera: Loftusia elongata, Loftusia persica, Loftusia morgani, Pseudorbitoides, Orbitoides media, Orbitoides tissotti, Omphalocyclus <b>macroporus</b> and Lepidorbitoides minor. The rudist boundstone facies almost consist of rudist solitary, and/or patchy reef (Prearadiolites, Daurina), gastropods (Acteonella Turbo, Turritella), with green calcareous careous algae (Dasycladaceae) are common too. Other large pelecypods (Gryphaea, Glycemeris), echinoderms, {{in addition to the}} large foraminifera, are also common and point to bioherm rudist body of patchy nature within massive limestone intervals.|$|E
40|$|Nanomaterials have {{structured}} components with {{at least}} one dimension of less than 100 nm. Their novel properties stem from their nanoscale dimensions and increased relative surface area, and they have a wide range of applications in several key fields, including medicine. In this thesis we focus on meso- and meso/macroporous silica materials and nanoparticle. We examine how the properties of nanomaterials are influenced by the experimental conditions used in their synthesis. We then explore the possibility of tailoring such properties by varying the parameters in the process of manufacture. To this end we prepared a range of materials, including mesoporous silica, meso/macroporous silica, silica porous spheres and silica nanoparticles and studied their properties. We also examined the micellar solutions and emulsions that are used in the synthesis of these materials, their micellar and droplet size, the phase behavior of the surfactant systems involved in the synthesis, the stability and rheological behavior of the emulsions and the scale up parameters for their preparation at different scales. The synthesis and characterization techniques include rheology, optical microscopy, nitrogen adsorption-desorption, X-ray scattering (SAXS and XRD), transmission and scattering electron microscopy (TEM and SEM), dynamic light scattering (DLS), zeta potential and thromboelastography, among others. In the first study we examined water-in-oil emulsions with a liquid crystal phase as continuous phase. These systems are stable and highly elastic. Their microstructure is discussed by fitting the data with several rheological models. These systems are also compared with water-in-oil emulsions with a micellar phase in the continuous phase, and as a function of surfactant concentration and volume fraction of dispersed phase. In the second study, the process variables that {{have a significant effect on}} the properties of the emulsions are identified, including stirring rate, dispersed phase addition flow rate, surfactant concentration and scale up. Droplet size and rheological properties are considered as response variables. Stirring rate is the parameter that most influences the emulsion properties, followed by surfactant concentration. Vessel size is also important. To study the scale up, emulsions were prepared at three scales with geometric similarity and we identified the parameters that must be kept constant to obtain the same emulsion in the three scales, i. e. emulsions with the same droplet size, viscosity, yield stress, viscoelastic parameters and stability. The scale invariants take into account the stirring rate (N) and the scale (D, impeller diameter). The third study focuses on the preparation of meso and meso/macroporous materials. Bimodal mesoporous materials with an ordered hexagonal structure and two interconnected networks are prepared from a mixture of two surfactants, one hydrogenated and the other fluorinated, through the cooperative templating mechanism, using tetramethyl orthosilicate as silica source. The synthesis of ordered mesoporous materials from a novel surfactant consisting of a modified block copolymer with amino-groups on the ends (Jeffamine) is also studied. In this case, the best ordering of the mesopores is obtained at low temperature. In both studies, the surfactant phase behavior, and the structural properties of both surfactants and materials are determined, and the experimental conditions (pH, temperature, agitation) are optimized. Macroporous materials are then prepared from the oil-in-water emulsions stabilized with modified Jeffamine and using decane as organic phase, through the emulsion templating mechanism. Finally, mesoporous silica spheres are prepared from highly concentrated water-in-oil emulsions. The last study focuses on the synthesis and applications of silica nanoparticles. The process variables that have a direct effect on the size are identified, like the silica source concentration and the pH. The growth mechanism of these particles is studied through turbidimetry and explained in terms of nuclei formation and aggregation of the hydrolyzed species. The clotting properties of the particles are analyzed, in order to use these particles as a scaffold for further functionalization and application in the control of internal hemorrhages. First, the particles are functionalized to reduce the clotting activity, in order to avoid the formation of unwanted clots. Amino-functionalization and PEGylation are analyzed in this case. Second, functionalization with polyphosphate chains is studied in order to enhance the clotting activity, not only in normal conditions, but also under coagulopathy and hypothermia. Els nanomaterials són materials amb propietats morfològiques entre 1 i 100 nm en almenys una direcció. En aquesta tesi s'estudien els materials meso- i meso/macroporosos de sílice, que tenen porus en aquestes dimensions, i nanopartícules, la grandària de les quals es troba també en aquest rang. En una primera fase s'estudien els sistemes tensioactius, com les solucions micel·lars i les emulsions, que s'usen per a la síntesi d’aquests materials. El primer estudi consta de l’anàlisi de les emulsions formades amb cristall líquid a la fase contínua. La microestructura d'aquests sistemes s'estudia amb diversos models reològics. També es comparen amb sistemes amb fase micel·lar en la fase contínua i a diferents concentracions de tensioactiu i fase dispersa. En un segon estudi es determinen les variables de procés que tenen un efecte significatiu sobre les propietats de les emulsions. Com a variables de resposta s'usen la mida de gota i les propietats reològiques. També s'estudia l'escalat en la preparació de les emulsions altament concentrades i es determinen els invariants d’escala. El tercer estudi se centra en la preparació de materials meso i meso/macroporosos. Es sintetitza un material amb mesoporus bimodals i estructura hexagonal ordenada a partir d'una barreja de dos tensioactius, i la síntesi de materials mesoporosos ordenats a partir d'uns tensioactius amb grups amino. També es preparen materials amb <b>macroporus</b> a partir d'emulsions formades amb aquest tensioactiu i, en última instància, es preparen esferes mesoporoses de sílice a partir d'emulsions aigua-en-oli altament concentrades. L'últim estudi se centra en la síntesi de nanopartícules de sílice, en les variables de procés que tenen un efecte directe sobre la mida obtinguda, i en l'aplicació d'aquestes nanopartícules en la coagulació de la sang per controlar hemorràgies internes. S'estudien les propietats de coagulació i es funcionalitzen amb agents que acceleren o disminueixen aquesta activitat. Les tècniques de síntesi i caracterització inclouen reologia, microscòpia òptica, adsorció-desorció de nitrogen, dispersió de raigs X, microscòpia electrònica de transmissió i de rastreig (TEM i SEM) i potencial zeta, entre altres...|$|E
