5|$|Apart {{from its}} use in {{fertilisers}} and energy-stores, nitrogen is a constituent of organic compounds as diverse as Kevlar used in high-strength fabric and cyanoacrylate used in superglue. Nitrogen is a constituent of every major pharmacological drug class, including antibiotics. Many drugs are mimics or prodrugs of natural nitrogen-containing signal molecules: for example, the organic nitrates nitroglycerin and nitroprusside control blood pressure by <b>metabolizing</b> into nitric oxide. Many notable nitrogen-containing drugs, such as the natural caffeine and morphine or the synthetic amphetamines, act on receptors of animal neurotransmitters.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} foods and {{substances}} {{have been found}} to disturb sleep, due to stimulant effects or disruptive digestive demands. Avoiding nicotine, caffeine (including coffee, energy drinks, soft drinks, tea, chocolate, and some pain relievers), and other stimulants in the hours before bedtime is recommended by most sleep hygiene specialists, as these substances activate neurobiological systems that maintain wakefulness. Alcohol near bedtime is frequently discouraged by clinicians, because, although alcohol can induce sleepiness initially, the arousal caused by <b>metabolizing</b> alcohol can disrupt and significantly fragment sleep. Smoking tobacco products before bed is also thought to reduce one's quality of resting by decreasing the time spent in deep sleep, leading to sleep fragmentation and nocturnal restlessness. Both consumption of a large meal just before bedtime, requiring effort to metabolize it all, and hunger have been associated with disrupted sleep; clinicians may recommend eating a light snack before bedtime. Lastly, limiting intake of liquids before bedtime can prevent interruptions due to urinations.|$|E
25|$|All of the ARBs, {{except for}} {{valsartan}} and olmesartan, are metabolized {{in some way}} by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme 2C9, that {{is found in the}} human liver. CYP2C9 is for example responsible for the <b>metabolizing</b> of losartan to EXP 3174 and the slow <b>metabolizing</b> of valsartan and candesartan to their inactive metabolites. Telmisartan is, on the other hand, in part metabolized by glucuronidation and olmesartan is excreted as the unchanged drug.|$|E
25|$|CYP4F8 and CYP4F12 <b>metabolize</b> PUFAs to {{signaling}} molecules: they <b>metabolizes</b> EPA to EEQs and DHA to EDPs. They also <b>metabolize</b> AA to 18-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (18-HETE) and 19-HETE.|$|R
5000|$|Arachidonate 15-lipoxygenase type II (ALOX15B), also termed 15-lipoxygenase-2, 15-LOX-2, and 15-LOX-2. It <b>metabolizes</b> {{arachidonic acid}} to 15-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic (15-HpETE) which is further <b>metabolized</b> to 15-Hydroxyicosatetraenoic acid. ALOX15B {{has little or}} no ability to <b>metabolize</b> arachidonic acid to 12-hydroperoxeiocosatetraenoic acid (12-(HpETE) and only minimal ability to <b>metabolize</b> {{linoleic}} acid to 13-hydroperoxyoctadecaenoic acid (13-HpODE).|$|R
5000|$|The enzymes 15-lipoxygenase-1 (ALOX15 and 15-lipoxygenase-2 (ALOX15B <b>metabolize</b> {{arachidonic acid}} to 15-hydroperoxyicosatetraemoic acid (15-HPETE) which may then be further <b>metabolized</b> to 15-hydroxyicosatetraenoic acid (15-HETE) and lipoxins; 15-Lipoxygenase-1 may also further <b>metabolize</b> 15-HPETE to eoxins in a pathway {{analogous}} to (and presumably {{using the same}} enzymes as used in) the pathway which <b>metabolizes</b> 5-HPETE to leukotrienes.|$|R
25|$|In {{patients}} with essential fructosuria, metabolism of fructose by hexokinase to fructose-6-phosphate {{is the primary}} method of <b>metabolizing</b> dietary fructose; this pathway is not significant in normal individuals.|$|E
25|$|Ofloxacin, {{like some}} other fluoroquinolones, may inhibit drug <b>metabolizing</b> enzymes and thereby {{increase}} {{blood levels of}} other drugs such as cyclosporine, theophyline, and warfarin, among others. These increased blood levels {{may result in a}} greater risk of side effects.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to bacteria, aquatic plants also eliminate nitrogen waste by <b>metabolizing</b> ammonia and nitrate. When plants metabolize nitrogen compounds, they remove nitrogen {{from the water}} by using it to build biomass that decays more slowly than ammonia-driven plankton already dissolved in the water.|$|E
50|$|CYP4F2, CYP4F3A, and CYP4F3B (see CYP4F3 for {{latter two}} CYPs) <b>metabolize</b> PUFAs to {{signaling}} molecules: they <b>metabolizes</b> AA to 20-HETE. They also <b>metabolize</b> EPA to 19-hydroxyeicosapentaenoic acid (19-HEPE) and 20-hydroxyeicosapentaenoic acid (20-HEPE) {{as well as}} <b>metabolize</b> DHA to 22-HDA. They also inactivate or reduce the activity of signaling molecules: they <b>metabolize</b> leukotriene B4 (LTB4) to 20-hydroxy-LTB4, 5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (5-HETE) to 5,20-diHETE, 5-oxo-eicosatetraenoic acid (5-oxo-ETE) to 5-oxo,20-hydroxy-ETE, 12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (12-HETE) to 12,20-diHETE, EETs to 20-hydroxy-EETs, and lipoxins to 20-hydroxy products.|$|R
40|$|A Pseudomonas sp. rapidly <b>metabolized</b> several nonchlorinated analogues of DDT, {{with the}} {{exception}} of 2, 2 -diphenylethanol, as the sole carbon source. Several of the mono-p-chloro-substituted diphenyl analogues were also <b>metabolized</b> as the sole carbon source by the bacterium. The resulting chlorinated aromatic acid metabolites were not further <b>metabolized.</b> The isolate was unable to <b>metabolize</b> p,p'-dichlorodiphenyl analogues as the sole carbon source...|$|R
25|$|CYP2S1 <b>metabolizes</b> PUFA to {{signaling}} molecules: it <b>metabolizes</b> AA to EETs ad EPA to EEQs.|$|R
25|$|By <b>metabolizing</b> the ω-3 {{polyunsaturated}} fatty acids, {{eicosapentaenoic acid}} and docosahexaenoic acid, into 17-HpDHA, 17-HDHA, and the resolvins and protectins, 15-LOX-1's metabolic action {{is thought to}} be one mechanism by which dietary ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, particularly fish oil, act to ameliorate inflammation, inflammation-related diseases, and certain cancers.|$|E
25|$|Unlike ciprofloxacin, {{levofloxacin}} {{does not}} appear to deactivate the drug <b>metabolizing</b> enzyme CYP1A2. Therefore, drugs that use that enzyme, like theophylline, do not interact with levofloxacin. It is a weak inhibitor of CYP2C9, suggesting potential to block the breakdown of warfarin and phenprocoumon. This can result in more action of drugs like warfarin, leading to more potential side effects, such as bleeding.|$|E
25|$|Age: {{some people}} {{experience}} hangovers as getting worse as one ages. This {{is thought to}} be caused by declining supplies of alcohol dehydrogenase, the enzyme involved in <b>metabolizing</b> alcohol. Although it is actually unknown whether hangover symptoms and severity change with age, research shows that drinking patterns change across ages, and heavy drinking episodes that may result in hangover are much less often experienced as age increases.|$|E
50|$|After {{application}} and systemic uptake, calcipotriol undergoes rapid hepatic metabolism. Calcipotriol is <b>metabolized</b> to MC1046 (the α,β−unsaturated ketone analog), which is subsequently <b>metabolized</b> to its primary metabolite, the saturated ketone analog MC1080. MC1080 is then slowly <b>metabolized</b> to calcitroic acid.|$|R
50|$|It is <b>metabolized</b> to lactic acid, {{which is}} in turn <b>metabolized</b> to n-butanol, n-butyraldehyde, and n-butyric acid.|$|R
2500|$|Compound [...] "A" [...] is <b>metabolized</b> to [...] "B" [...] by enzyme [...] "X", {{compound}} [...] "B" [...] is <b>metabolized</b> to [...] "C" [...] by enzyme [...] "Y", and compound [...] "C" [...] is <b>metabolized</b> to [...] "D" [...] by enzyme [...] "Z".|$|R
25|$|Wilson et al. (2001), an {{autosomal}} DNA study {{based on}} cluster analysis that {{looked at a}} combined sample of Amhara and Oromo examining a single enzyme variants: drug <b>metabolizing</b> enzyme (DME) loci, found that 62% of Ethiopeans fall into the same cluster of Ashkenazi Jews, Norwegians and Armenians based on that gene. Only 24% of Ethiopians cluster with Bantus and Afro-Caribbeans, 8% with Papua New Guineans, and 6% with Chinese.|$|E
25|$|Wilson's disease (WD) {{is a rare}} {{inherited}} {{disorder in}} which patients have a problem <b>metabolizing</b> copper. In patients with WD, copper accumulates in the liver {{and other parts of}} the body, particularly the brain, eyes and kidneys. Upon accumulation in the brain, patients may experience speech problems, incoordination, swallowing problems, and prominent hyperkinetic symptoms including tremor, dystonia, and gait difficulties. Psychiatric disturbances such as irritability, impulsiveness, aggressiveness, and mood disturbances are also common.|$|E
25|$|The body uses glucose for energy. Without insulin, glucose {{is unable}} to enter the cells {{where it will be}} used for this and other {{anabolic}} ("building up") purposes, such as the synthesis of glycogen, proteins, and fatty acids. Insulin is also an active preventor of the breakdown or catabolism of glycogen and fat. The absence of sufficient insulin causes this breaking-down process to be accelerated; it is the mechanism behind <b>metabolizing</b> fat instead of glucose and the appearance of ketones.|$|E
25|$|Methylphenidate is <b>metabolized</b> into ritalinic acid by CES1A1. Dextromethylphenidate is {{selectively}} <b>metabolized</b> at {{a slower}} rate than levomethylphenidate.|$|R
50|$|Diacetyldihydromorphine {{is quickly}} <b>metabolized</b> by plasma {{esterase}} enzymes into dihydromorphine, {{in the same}} way that diamorphine is <b>metabolized</b> into morphine.|$|R
50|$|Unlike most fatty acids, VLCFAs are {{too long}} to be <b>metabolized</b> in the mitochondria, and must be <b>metabolized</b> in peroxisomes.|$|R
25|$|A marine {{aquarium}} is an aquarium that keeps marine {{plants and animals}} in a contained environment. Marine aquaria are further subdivided by hobbyists into fish only (FO), fish only with live rock (FOWLR), and reef aquaria. Fish only tanks often showcase large or aggressive marine fish species and generally rely on mechanical and chemical filtration. FOWLR and reef tanks use live rock, a material composed of coral skeletons harboring beneficial nitrogen waste <b>metabolizing</b> bacteria, {{as a means of}} more natural biological filtration.|$|E
25|$|With {{the advent}} of {{molecular}} genetics, the three transport mechanisms have been traced to the proteins and their genes since 1990. They now comprise the plasma membrane noradrenaline transporter (NAT or NET), the classical uptake1, and the analogous dopamine transporter (DAT); the plasma membrane extraneuronal monoamine transporter or organic cation transporter 3 (EMT or SLC22A3), Iversen’s uptake2; and the vesicular monoamine transporter (VMAT) with two isoforms. Transporters and intracellular enzymes such as monoamine oxidase operating in series constitute what the pharmacologist Ullrich Trendelenburg at the University of Würzburg called <b>metabolizing</b> systems.|$|E
25|$|Glucose-6-phosphate {{dehydrogenase}} (G6PD) is {{an important}} enzyme in red cells, <b>metabolizing</b> glucose through the pentose phosphate pathway, an anabolic alternative to catabolic oxidation (glycolysis), while maintaining a reducing environment. G6PD is present in all human cells but is particularly important to red blood cells. Since mature red blood cells lack nuclei and cytoplasmic RNA, they cannot synthesize new enzyme molecules to replace genetically abnormal or ageing ones. All proteins, including enzymes, have to last for the entire lifetime of the red blood cell, which is normally 120 days.|$|E
25|$|CYP4A11 <b>metabolizes</b> {{endogenous}} PUFAs to signaling molecules: it <b>metabolizes</b> AA to 20-HETE and EETs; it also hydroxylates DHA to 22-hydroxy-DHA (i.e. 12-HDHA).|$|R
50|$|As with PEA, NMPEA is <b>metabolized</b> {{relatively}} rapidly by monoamine oxidases during {{first pass}} metabolism; both compounds are preferentially <b>metabolized</b> by MAO-B.|$|R
5000|$|Alox12b (e-LOX2, epidermis-type Lox-12) {{appears to}} act {{similarly}} to ALOX12B to <b>metabolize</b> the linoleic acid moiety of EOS to its 9R-hydroperoxy counterpart and thereby contribute to skin integrity and water impermeability; mice depleted to Alox12b develop a severe skin defect similar to Congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma. Unlike human ALOX12B which cam <b>metabolize</b> arachidonic acid to 12R-HETE {{at a low}} rate, Alox12b does not <b>metabolize</b> arachidonic acid as free acd but dose <b>metabolize</b> arachidonic acid methyl ester to its 12R-hydroperoxy counterpart.|$|R
25|$|Argentines {{have three}} Nobel Prizes laureates in the Sciences. Bernardo Houssay, the first Latin American among them, {{discovered}} {{the role of}} pituitary hormones in regulating glucose in animals. César Milstein did extensive research in antibodies. Luis Leloir discovered how organisms store energy converting glucose into glycogen and the compounds which are fundamental in <b>metabolizing</b> carbohydrates. Argentine research {{has led to the}} treatment of heart diseases and several forms of cancer. Domingo Liotta designed and developed the first artificial heart successfully implanted in a human being in 1969. René Favaloro developed the techniques and performed the world's first ever coronary bypass surgery.|$|E
25|$|The primary endosymbionts {{are thought}} to help the host either by {{providing}} nutrients that the host cannot obtain itself or by <b>metabolizing</b> insect waste products into safer forms. For example, the putative primary role of Buchnera is to synthesize essential amino acids that the aphid cannot acquire from its natural diet of plant sap. Likewise, the primary role of Wigglesworthia, it is presumed, is to synthesize vitamins that the tsetse fly does not get from the blood that it eats. In lower termites, the endosymbiotic protists {{play a major role}} in the digestion of lignocellulosic materials that constitute a bulk of the termites' diet.|$|E
25|$|Nongenotoxic, or {{epigenetic}} carcinogens {{are different}} and slightly more ambiguous than genotoxic carcinogens {{since they are}} not directly carcinogenic. Nongenotoxic carcinogens act by secondary mechanisms that do not directly damage genes. This type of carcinogenesis {{does not change the}} sequence of DNA; instead it alters the expression or repression of certain genes by a wide variety of cellular processes. Since these toxicants do not directly act on DNA, {{little is known about the}} mechanistic pathway. It has been proposed that modification of gene expression from nongenotoxic carcinogens can occur by oxidative stress, peroxisome proliferation, suppression of apoptosis, alteration of intercellular communication, and modulation of <b>metabolizing</b> enzymes.|$|E
5000|$|The enzyme 12-lipoxygenase (ALOX12) <b>metabolizes</b> {{arachidonic acid}} to 12-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid (12-HPETE0 which may then be <b>metabolized</b> to 12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (12-HETE) and to hepoxilins.|$|R
5|$|Bupropion is <b>metabolized</b> to hydroxybupropion by CYP2B6, an isozyme of the {{cytochrome}} P450 system. Alcohol causes {{an increase}} of CYP2B6 in the liver, and persons {{with a history of}} alcohol use <b>metabolize</b> bupropion faster. Bupropion is <b>metabolized</b> to threo-hydrobupropion via cortisone reductase. The metabolic pathway responsible for the creation of erythro-hydrobupropion remains elusive.|$|R
5000|$|The enzyme 5-lipoxygenase <b>metabolizes</b> {{arachidonic acid}} to 5-hydroperoxyicosatetraenoic acid (5-HPETE), {{which in turn}} is <b>metabolized</b> to various {{leukotriene}}s (i.e. leukotriene B4, leukotriene C4, leukotriene D4, and leukotriene E4 as well as to 5-hydroxyicosatetraenoic acid (5-HETE) which may then be further <b>metabolized</b> to 5-HETE's more potent 5-keto analog, 5-oxo-eicosatetraenoic acid (5-oxo-ETE) (also see 5-Hydroxyicosatetraenoic acid.|$|R
