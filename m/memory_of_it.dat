5|$|By {{the time}} the strip ended in March 1995 Melchester were in dire straits, {{on the verge of}} bankruptcy, and their {{long-term}} future far from certain. When the strip returned in Match of the Day magazine in May 1997, much of the monthly comic's new continuity was ignored, although the basic thread of the club having struggled against relegation and being severely in debt was continued. It was revealed in the first strip that in the intervening years, while Rovers had managed to survive the threat of bankruptcy, a bribery scandal had caused a mass exodus of players and eventual relegation to Division One. Rocky, meanwhile, was playing for fierce local rivals Melborough, after a bitter falling-out with his father over a car accident in Italy in which his mother, Penny, had been killed. Roy, who had quit football as a result, was blamed by some (including his son) for the accident, even though he had no <b>memory</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> and the precise circumstances surrounding the event were never resolved.|$|E
25|$|By {{taking part}} in the 1995 {{ceremony}} to commemorate the liberation of the Auschwitz concentration camp, the President of the ICRC, Cornelio Sommaruga, sought to show that the organization was fully aware of the gravity of The Holocaust and the need to keep the <b>memory</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> alive, so as to prevent any repetition of it. He paid tribute to all those who had suffered or lost their lives during the war and publicly regretted the past mistakes and shortcomings of the Red Cross with regard to the victims of the concentration camps.|$|E
25|$|Professor Trelawney first {{appears in}} the third book of the series, when Harry, Ron, and Hermione start divination lessons. The friends {{generally}} believe Professor Trelawney is a fraud. However, Gryffindor students Parvati Patil and Lavender Brown are very fond of and impressed by her. According to Professor McGonagall, her credibility as a Seer is undermined by her habit of erroneously predicting, each year, {{the death of one}} of her students. Her more profound predictions seem only to happen when she is in a trance and unaware of what she is saying, with no <b>memory</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> afterward. However, almost all her predictions were later to be shown true in the books even if she was not in a trance.|$|E

500|$|They {{set out on}} {{a journey}} to get away from Carmine, first going to a hotel near Niagara Falls. Hearing of this, Angelo assumed that Kevin wanted to win over Angelina, and sent over his friend Dino to [...] "break his legs". They fled to Angelo's fishing cabin on an island where a {{homeless}} man is living. It is later revealed to be Gloria's estranged husband Jeffrey who had been kidnapped and sent away by Angelo, but lost <b>memory</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> Jeffrey stole their motor boat, leaving them stranded there. Angelina then finally revealed to Kevin that she was never pregnant and faked the ordeal so that he would fall in love with her. Dino arrives at the Island and nearly killed Kevin, but Angelina tells him he can't because she will be married to Kevin. Because of this, Kevin reluctantly had to marry her at a ceremony in Glowarm because Angelo forced him. Kevin was extremely miserable and told Chloe that the marriage was a sham.|$|E
500|$|... 15 June 1389, {{the date}} by which Tvrtko had {{intended}} to complete his conquest of Dalmatia, was also {{the day when the}} Ottoman army met the forces of a coalition of Serbian states at the Battle of Kosovo. Tvrtko, feeling it his duty as King of Serbia, ordered his army to leave Dalmatia and assist the lords Lazar Hrebljanović and Vuk Branković. He resented the Milanese ruler, Gian Galeazzo Visconti, for selling weaponry to the Ottomans in wake of the battle. The highest ranking among the casualties, which also included Bosnian noblemen, were Lazar and the Ottoman ruler Murad I. The outcome of the battle was difficult to ascertain, but Vlatko's letters from the battlefield convinced Tvrtko that the Christian alliance came out victorious. Tvrtko in turn informed various Christian states of his great triumph; the authorities of the Republic of Florence responded praising both the Kingdom of Bosnia and its king for achieving a [...] "victory so glorious that the <b>memory</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> would never fade". The triumph, however, was hollow. Tvrtko's Serbian title lost what little actual significance it had when Lazar's successors accepted Ottoman suzerainty, while Vuk Branković turned to Tvrtko's enemy Sigismund. Since the Battle of Kosovo, the Bosnian claim to the Serbian throne was merely nominal.|$|E

She must have rejected the memory of this event later as she has no <b>memory</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> These tragic and violent experiences led to her attempted suicide at the age of 17, using sleeping pills.

2500|$|The Second World War (19391945) saw {{the horrors}} of the Nazi Holocaust. The USA creationist {{explanation}} for the Holocaust is that it had been driven in part by eugenics, or the principle that individuals with [...] "undesirable" [...] genetic characteristics should be removed from the gene pool. Eugenics was based in part on principles of cultural evolutionary theory, though many biologists had long opposed it. Although eugenics was rejected by other nations after the war, the <b>memory</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> did not quickly fade, and professional scientists sought to distance themselves from it and other racial ideologies associated with the Nazis.|$|E

Eventually, via an elaborate plan that sees Light relinquish ownership of his Death Note, thus temporarily losing all <b>memory</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> and the forced help of his second Death Note possessing fiancée Misa Amane's Shinigami Rem, L dies. Light then assumes the [...] "L" [...] persona and continues his charade of searching for Kira with the task force while carrying out the killings himself with help from Misa.|$|E

2500|$|Occurring during Ireland's Revolutionary period, the Irish Catholic {{experience}} {{of the war was}} complex and its <b>memory</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> divisive. At the outbreak of the war, most Irish people, regardless of political affiliation, supported the war {{in much the same way}} as their British counterparts, and both nationalist and unionist leaders initially backed the British war effort. Their followers, both Catholic and Protestant, served extensively in the British forces, many in three specially raised divisions. [...] Over 200,000 Irishmen fought in the war, in several theatres with 30,000 deaths. [...] In 1916, Catholic supporters of Irish independence from the United Kingdom took the opportunity of the ongoing war to proclaim an Irish Republic and to defend it in an armed rebellion against British rule in Dublin. The rebellion was poorly planned and quickly suppressed. The British executed most of the prisoners which caused Catholic opinion to surge in favour of independence. [...] Britain's intention to impose conscription in Ireland in 1918 provoked widespread resistance and as a result remained unimplemented.|$|E
