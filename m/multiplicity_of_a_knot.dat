50|$|Consecutive knots {{can have}} the same value. This then defines a knot span of zero length, which implies that two control points are {{activated}} {{at the same time}} (and of course two control points become deactivated). This has impact on continuity of the resulting curve or its higher derivatives; for instance, it allows the creation of corners in an otherwise smooth NURBS curve.A number of coinciding knots is sometimes referred to as a knot with a certain multiplicity. Knots with multiplicity two or three are known as double or triple knots. The <b>multiplicity</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>knot</b> is limited to the degree of the curve; since a higher multiplicity would split the curve into disjoint parts and it would leave control points unused. For first-degree NURBS, each knot is paired with a control point.|$|E

40|$|In {{an earlier}} paper {{the first author}} defined a non-commutative A-polynomial for knots in 3 -space, using the colored Jones {{function}}. The {{idea is that the}} colored Jones function <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>knot</b> satisfies <b>a</b> non-trivial linear q-difference equation. Said differently, the colored Jones function <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>knot</b> is annihilated by <b>a</b> non-zero ideal <b>of</b> the Weyl algebra. By localizing, the Weyl algebra becomes a principal ideal domain, so that there is a single polynomial generator, the non-commutative A-polynomial <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>knot.</b> In that paper, it was conjectured that this polynomial (which has to do with representations of the quantum group Uq(sl 2)) specializes at q = 1 to the better known A-polynomial <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>knot,</b> which has to do with genuine SL 2 ( ) representations of the knot complement. Computing the A-polynomial <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>knot</b> is <b>a</b> difficult task. Computing the non-commutative A-polynomial has so far been achieved for the two simplest knots, and for torus <b>knots.</b> In <b>an</b> earlier paper TTQ.

The search of efficient formulas for the colored Jones function, with geometric meaning, lead the authors to consider <b>a</b> repackaging <b>of</b> the colored Jones function due to Habiro.

40|$|Abstract. In {{an earlier}} paper, {{the first author}} {{introduced}} the noncommutative A-polynomial <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>knot.</b> By definition, it is the characteristic polynomial of the colored Jones function of the knot, and its specialization at q = 1 is conjectured {{to coincide with the}} better-known A-polynomial <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>knot.</b> The aim <b>of</b> the paper is to introduce the C-polynomial <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>knot</b> and its noncommutative cousin. By its definition, the noncommutative C-polynomial <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>knot</b> is the characteristic polynomial of the cyclotomic function of the knot (the latter, introduced by Habiro), and as a result, it is entirely determined by the colored Jones function <b>of</b> the <b>knot.</b> <b>A</b> goal <b>of</b> the paper is to give explicit formulas for the noncommutative C-polynomial of all twist knots. Since the cyclotomic and the colored Jones function <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>knot</b> are related by an explicit transformation, we conjecture that the C-polynomial and the A-polynomial <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>knot</b> are likewise related by an explicit rational map of degree 2. Using our explicit formulas, we verify this conjecture for all twist knots, and we observe that the genus of the C-polynomial of twist knots is zero. Our computation of the noncommutative C-polynomial of twist knots utilizes explicit single-sum formulas for the cyclotomic function, and Zeilberger’s theory of recursion relations for sums of q-hypergeometric terms.
