5|$|Among constant-width shapes with a given width, the Reuleaux {{triangle}} has the <b>minimum</b> <b>area</b> and {{the sharpest}} (smallest) possible angle (120°) at its corners. By several numerical measures {{it is the}} farthest from being centrally symmetric. It provides the largest constant-width shape avoiding the points of an integer lattice, and {{is closely related to}} the shape of the quadrilateral maximizing the ratio of perimeter to diameter. It can perform a complete rotation within a square while at all times touching all four sides of the square, and has the smallest possible area of shapes with this property. However, although it covers most of the square in this rotation process, it fails to cover {{a small fraction of the}} square's area, near its corners. Because of this property of rotating within a square, the Reuleaux triangle is also sometimes known as the Reuleaux rotor.|$|E

To warm up, {{they can move}} into the sun or onto a warm surface; if they overheat, they can move into the shade or adopt a stance that exposes the <b>minimum</b> <b>area</b> of skin to the air. This posture {{is also used to}} prevent water loss and involves the frog squatting close to the substrate with its hands and feet tucked under its chin and body. The colour of a frog's skin is used for thermoregulation. In cool damp conditions, the colour will be darker than on a hot dry day. The grey foam-nest tree frog (Chiromantis xerampelina) is even able to turn white to minimize the chance of overheating.|$|E

25|$|In many design methodologies, Area and Speed are the {{subjects}} of trade-offs. This is due to limited routing resources, as the more resources used, the slower the operation. Optimizing for <b>minimum</b> <b>area</b> allows the design both to use fewer resources, and for greater proximity of the sections of the design. This leads to shorter interconnect distances, fewer routing resources used, faster end-to-end signal paths, and even faster and more consistent place and route times. Done correctly, there are no negatives to floorplanning.|$|E

2500|$|Valve/port {{coefficient}} is non dimensional and {{is derived}} by multiplying a characteristic physical {{area of the}} port and by the bulk flow figures and comparing the result to an ideal orifice of the same area. It is here that air flow bench norms differ from fluid dynamics or aerodynamics at large. The coefficient may {{be based on the}} inner valve seat diameter, the outer valve head diameter, the port throat area or the valve open curtain area. Each of these methods are valid for some purpose but none of them represents the true <b>minimum</b> <b>area</b> for the valve/port in question and each results in a different flow coefficient. The great difficulty of measuring the actual <b>minimum</b> <b>area</b> at all the various valve lifts precludes using this as a characteristic measurement. This is due to the <b>minimum</b> <b>area</b> changing shape and location throughout the lift cycle. Because of this non standardization, port flow coefficients are not [...] "true" [...] flow coefficients, which would be based on the actual <b>minimum</b> <b>area</b> in the flow path. Which method to choose depends on what use is intended for the data. Engine simulation applications each require their own specification. If the result is to be compared to the work of others then the same method would have to be selected.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the relations between the degree of encroachment, measured as the cross-sectional area of the dural sac, and low back pain in a large population. In this cross-sectional study, data from 802 participants (247 men, 555 women; mean age, 63. 5 years) were analyzed. The measurement of the cross-sectional area of the dural sac from the level of L 1 / 2 to L 4 / 5 was taken using axial T 2 -weighted images. The <b>minimum</b> cross-sectional <b>area</b> was defined as the cross-sectional area of the dural sac at the most constricted level in the examined spine. Participants were divided into three groups according to <b>minimum</b> cross-sectional <b>area</b> measurement quartiles (less than the first quartile, between the first and third quartiles, and greater than the third quartile). A multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to estimate the association between the <b>minimum</b> cross-sectional <b>area</b> and the prevalence of low back pain. The mean <b>minimum</b> cross-sectional <b>area</b> was 117. 3 mm 2 (men: 114. 4 mm 2; women: 118. 6 mm 2). A logistic regression analysis adjusted for age, sex, body mass index, and other confounding factors, including disc degeneration, showed that a narrow <b>minimum</b> cross-sectional <b>area</b> (smaller than the first quartile) was significantly associated with low back pain (odds ratio, 1. 78; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 13 - 2. 80 compared to the wide <b>minimum</b> cross-sectional <b>area</b> group: <b>minimum</b> cross-sectional <b>area</b> greater than the third quartile measured).

2500|$|Lebesgue's first {{paper was}} {{published}} in 1898 and was titled [...] "Sur l'approximation des fonctions". It dealt with Weierstrass' theorem on approximation to continuous functions by polynomials. Between March 1899 and April 1901 Lebesgue published six notes in Comptes Rendus. The first of these, unrelated to his development of Lebesgue integration, dealt with the extension of Baire's theorem to functions of two variables. The next five dealt with surfaces applicable to a plane, the area of skew polygons, surface integrals of <b>minimum</b> <b>area</b> with a given bound, and the final note gave the definition of Lebesgue integration for some function f(x). Lebesgue's great thesis, Intégrale, longueur, aire, with the full account of this work, appeared in the Annali di Matematica in 1902. The first chapter develops the theory of measure (see Borel measure). In the second chapter he defines the integral both geometrically and analytically. The next chapters expand the Comptes Rendus notes dealing with length, area and applicable surfaces. The final chapter deals mainly with Plateau's problem.

2500|$|In early 1944, the Allied air {{war began}} to focus {{primarily}} upon {{the destruction of the}} Luftwaffe in preparation for the invasion of Normandy. Plans for the so-called [...] "Big Week", which was intended to permanently smash the German capacity to produce fighter aircraft through targeted airstrikes on final assembly factories, were already underway in 1943. Between February 20–25, 1944, approximately 10,000 American and British aircraft, including about 6,000 bombers, attacked strategic targets all over Germany. Following these attacks, which seriously damaged German aircraft production, the production quota fell drastically. In response the Jägerstab (Fighter Staff) was founded in March 1944 with the task of ensuring the preservation and growth of fighter aircraft production. It superseded the Ministry of Aviation in this jurisdiction. At the head of the Jägerstab was armaments minister Albert Speer, as Deputy the Secretary of State Erhard Milch, as Chief of Staff Karl Saur. Their plan to protect the aircraft industry, especially the manufacture of the jet-powered Messerschmitt Me 262, entailed the relocation of assembly plants into underground bunkers. This idea was not entirely new, as a similar (but never realized) proposal had already been considered in October 1943. The Jägerstab's plan included six locations in which partially underground bunkers were to be built, and at first called for the bunkers to be encompass a <b>minimum</b> <b>area</b> of 600,000 to 800,000 m2 apiece. However, {{by the time of the}} Jägerstab meeting of 17 March 1944, the projected size of the each building had sunk to 60,000 m2. By June 1944 the invasion of the allies had forced the Jägerstab to focus in the end on two locations in Upper Bavaria. Three bunkers were to be built at Kaufering in the Landsberg am Lech district under the codename [...] "Ringeltaube" [...] (common wood pigeon), while the codename [...] "Weingut I" [...] (Vineyard I) was chosen for the factory in the [...] According to the testimony of Franz Xaver Dorsch, who was responsible for the construction, the fighter factory would be completed in five to six months at best.

Observed spatial tree mark associations seem to be highly linked with seed dissemination processes, the relative shade tolerance of some tree species, and specific preferences for particular soil types. On the other hand, repulsive interactions could be an indication of competition processes that impose minimum distances between marks of trees. Selective tree removal is a major cause of spatial structuring (Longuetaud et al. 2008).
