40|$|Some {{have argued}} that NATO's air {{campaign}} against Serbia in 1999 was manifestly unlawful, others {{that it was an}} entirely legitimate humanitarian intervention. A third position suggests that the intervention while unlawful, in the strictest sense, was nonetheless legitimate. Here, a customary law right to intervene was seen as emerging, permitting action to prevent a <b>mass</b> <b>atrocity</b> <b>crime,</b> even when UN Security Council authorization was absent. Did Operation Allied Force, then, add to the case for the emergence of this new customary norm? While the 1990 s was a decade of humanitarian intervention, the decade since has been dominated by international action against terrorism and, of course, the effects of the highly controversial US and British led invasion of Iraq. In this context, there is scant evidence that a customary right or obligation to intervene for humanitarian reasons has crystallized since 1999. But if Kosovo achieved anything, it was to prompt greater attention to the merits of the argument in favour of a ‘responsibility to protect’. If NATO's 1999 action were repeated today in a similarly unauthorized manner it would still be unlawful, but it would perhaps be seen as a legitimate means to preventing a <b>mass</b> <b>atrocity</b> <b>crime...</b>|$|E
40|$|Forcible {{displacement}} can {{constitute a}} <b>mass</b> <b>atrocity</b> <b>crime.</b> This {{is something that}} is considered within the non-binding Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement. Efforts to implement the Guiding Principles at the regional level suggest one path to implement stronger legal protections for internally displaced persons (IDPs), in particular, against mass atrocity crimes. These regional processes, however, can vary in remarkable ways. In the African Union, the Kampala Convention has brought the Guiding Principles and protections against mass atrocity crimes directed at IDPs into regional hard law; it also includes robust implementation and enforcement mechanisms. At this stage, however, these mechanisms remain anticipatory rather than effective; consequently international assistance will be vital to entrench the rights anchored in the Convention. By contrast, ASEAN has introduced no overt protections for IDPs. However, its developing legal human rights framework through the ASEAN Declaration of Human Rights, coupled with the Association’s response to the Rohingya IDP crisis in Myanmar, suggests that a policy-focused change, while incremental, may be happening...|$|E

40|$|While the {{legality}} of intervention without Security Council authorisation is still debatablein international law, over-reliance on military intervention {{increases the risk of}} too much focus on reactive rather than proactive strategies. If the thresholds for Article 4 (h) intervention – like those of the responsibility to protect – are serious international crimes subject to universal jurisdiction, it follows that measures to ensure the observance of the law in prospect, rather than intervention and penalisation of violations in retrospect,are important in preventing violations. Therefore, in order to in a timely manner and effectively implement Article 4 (h) and R 2 P, the missing link is borderless ‘persuasive prevention’ which aims at enforcing fundamental human rights obligations to prevent <b>mass</b> <b>atrocity</b> <b>crimes</b> stipulated in Article 4 (h). To this end, as a minimum, the AU should discharge its responsibility to prevent human rights violations through the ‘force of law’. Where atrocities are likely to take place, the African Standby Force (ASF) should be deployedin a timely way, not to defeat a State, but to pursue perpetrators of <b>mass</b> <b>atrocity</b> <b>crimes.</b> To achieve this, the ASF should have the ‘capability to protect’ to ensure the ‘obligationto prosecute or extradite’. Although the AU has taken an interventionist stance, what is needed most is early action to prevent <b>mass</b> <b>atrocity</b> <b>crimes.</b> The AU may need to establish a body to monitor the implementation of obligations whose breach may lead to the heinous crimes in Article 4 (h). In addition, the AU needs a legally binding instrument to ensure accountability and end impunity for crimes in Article 4 (h).

40|$|The {{concept of}} the “responsibility to protect” (“R 2 P”) was {{endorsed}} by the world’s leaders sitting at the 2005 World Summit level in the UN General Assembly. The World Summit Outcome Document affirmed that every sovereign government {{has a responsibility to}} protect its citizens and those within its jurisdiction from genocide, war crimes, “ethnic cleansing” and crimes against humanity (UN 2005 paras. 138 – 139). The concept of R 2 P is cast in the three core pillars: first, an affirmation of the primary and continuing obligation of individual states to protect its population from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing, and crimes against humanity, as well as incitement thereof; second, a commitment by the international community to assist states in meeting these obligations; and third, acceptance by UN member states of their responsibility to respond in a timely and decisive manner through the UN Security Council, if national authorities are manifestly failing to protect their populations from these <b>mass</b> <b>atrocity</b> <b>crimes.</b> R 2 P is a restatement of positive binding obligations of states to protect their citizens from <b>mass</b> <b>atrocity</b> crimes; and the collective responsibility to the international community to prevent <b>mass</b> <b>atrocity</b> <b>crimes.</b> R 2 P is about taking effective action at the earliest possible stage (Evans 2008). These obligations are particularly relevant to Africa in the face of crises such as those in Sudan (Darfur), parts of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and Somalia. It is, however, rather early to pass definitive judgement on the relatively young notion of R 2 P without addressing some of the challenges confronting its implementation in Africa...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to provide a better {{understanding}} of why some countries experience <b>mass</b> <b>atrocities</b> dur- ing periods of democratic transition, while others do not. Scholars have long regarded democracy as an important source of stability and protection from <b>mass</b> <b>atrocities</b> such as genocide, crimes against humanity and ethnic cleansing. But democratic transition itself is fraught with the heightened risk of violent conflict and even <b>mass</b> <b>atrocities.</b> Indeed, a number of studies have identified regimes in transition as containing the highest risk of political instability and <b>mass</b> <b>atrocities.</b> What is overlooked is the question of how and why some regimes undergo such transitions without experi- encing <b>mass</b> <b>atrocities,</b> despite the presence of a number of salient risk factors, including state-based discrimination, in- ter-group tension and horizontal inequality.

How countries avoid such violence during transition has the potential to yield insights for the mitigation of risk associated with <b>mass</b> <b>atrocity</b> <b>crimes...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{historian}} Raul Hilberg once {{observed that}} {{we would all be}} happier if we believed the perpetrators of the Holocaust were crazy. But <b>mass</b> <b>atrocity</b> is never so simple. We may search in Germany, Bosnia, the Congo, or Rwanda for the madman or the deviant, but often we will find instead an ordinary person, one who commits a crime at the barrel of a gun or who succumbs to the awful indirect coercion that pervades entire communities in the throes of transformative violence. In the ashes of atrocity, criminal courts have been created, but many scholars have come to think that the basic structures of criminal law- built to address willful deviance from society 2 ̆ 7 s norms-are inappropriate for dealing with the complex context of <b>mass</b> <b>atrocity</b> <b>crimes.</b> This Article challenges this critique by making three contributions. First, it presents a novel descriptive account of how courts addressing <b>mass</b> <b>atrocity</b> <b>crimes</b> wrestle with the concept of deviance in criminal responsibility.

Finally, the Article builds on the theory of aspirational expressivism to make the normative claim that courts can be more than forums for condemning the world 2 ̆ 7 s horrors, as their role has been predominantly conceived. Instead, they can be- and should be- sites of storytelling, providing an opportunity for understanding how individuals choose to perpetrate unspeakable crimes, articulating how we hope people will behave in the most demanding of circumstances, and shaping our beliefs about the way we ought to behave under the unflattering light of the way we actually do...|$|R

Even though the topic has been thoroughly debated through the seventy years of the UN, the concept of state sovereignty has been the common norm. But in the scope of the humanitarian disasters of the 90 s such as the genocide in Rwanda (1994), a change in the norm of sovereignty began to emerge. This is elaborated in this project through an establishment of a general duty towards humanitarian intervention amongst agents in the international community, and how this duty is to be distributed amongst these agents according to the emerging norm of R 2 P. Furthermore it show to which extend the R 2 P-doctrin can be illuminated critically. The theoretical framework of this project is found in Just war theory, the moral philosophical theories of deontology and consequentialism, and the moderate instrumentalist approach which critically examine duty of the R 2 P-doctrin. This project state that the R 2 P-doctrin, to a certain extent, manages to establish this duty and critical illumination shows that trouble occurs when the doctrine attempts to distribute this duty.

50|$|To {{teach about}} the particularity of the Holocaust is an {{opportunity}} to teach about the nature and dynamics of <b>mass</b> <b>atrocity</b> <b>crimes,</b> i.e. genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. The United Nations Framework of Analysis of <b>Atrocity</b> <b>Crimes</b> states “atrocity crimes are considered to be the most serious crimes against humankind.

Prevention has, therefore, been identified by the international community as a necessity for international peace and stability. Prevention requires continuous efforts and awareness in both the short and long term at the local, national and global levels. Such measures may include institutional initiatives that strengthen the rule of law and protect human rights, ensure a better management of diverse societies and reinforce civil society and independent media.|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. M. (Security)) [...] University of the Witwatersrand, Faculty of Commerce, Law and Management, Graduate School of Public and Development Management, 2013. The African Union {{is legally}} {{mandated}} by its Constitutive Act {{to intervene in}} security situations like the Libyan crisis of 2011, namely, to protect populations from genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity, collectively known as <b>mass</b> <b>atrocity</b> <b>crimes.</b> In this respect, Article 4 (h) of the AU Constitutive Act accords the right of AU “to intervene in a member State pursuant to a decision of Assembly in respect of grave circumstances, namely; war crimes, genocide and crimes against humanity. ” When the Libyan crisis that had all the hallmarks of <b>mass</b> <b>atrocity</b> <b>crimes</b> broke out, African Union showed willingness to intervene and solve the crisis by passing resolutions, establishing fact finding missions, and, forming High Level Ad hoc committee comprising of 5 African Presidents and the AU Commission. However, when the time for reckoning came, AU was relegated to the periphery by NATO and other International actors in finding solutions to the Libyan crisis. This study therefore, examines and assesses the African Union’s response to the Libyan crisis of 2011 {{in light of the}} Article 4 (h) of the Constitutive Act (intervention). The method of data collection majorly relied on what AU did in form of resolutions, Letters and other publications, and what has been written about AU’s actions in reference to the Libyan crisis of 2011. The study examined the measures AU took to respond to the crisis, the AU organs that were greatly engaged in looking for the solution to the crisis, and whether the measures undertaken were sufficient in resolving the crisis, and, in the hind sight what AU ought to have done. The study looked at the weaknesses that beset African Union in trying to look for a solution to the Libyan crisis, and concludes by proving recommendations for strengthening African Union Peace and Security Architecture to be able to confront head on, future African security crises like the Libyan one of 2011...|$|R
