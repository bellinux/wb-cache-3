Exploiting the layer-by-layer resolution of the Mg KL 23 L 23 Auger spectra and using multiple scattering calcula-tions we first determine the inter-layer distances {{as well as the}} morphological parameters of the MgO/Ag(001) system with and without Mg atoms incorporated at the interface. We find that the <b>Mg</b> atom <b>incorporation</b> drives a strong distortion of the interface layers and that its impact on the metal/oxide electronic structure is an important reduction of the work function (0. 5 eV) related to band-offset variations at the interface. These experimental observations are in very good agreement with our DFT calculations which reproduce the induced lattice distortion and which reveal (through a Bader analysis) that the increase of the interface Mg concentration results in an electron transfer from Mg to Ag atoms of the metallic interface layer. Although the local lattice distortion appears {{as a consequence of the}} attractive (repulsive) Coulomb interaction between O 2 − ions of the MgO interface layer and the nearest positively (negatively) charged Mg (Ag) neighbors of the metallic interface layer, its effect on the work function reduction is only limited.

This work {{is the first step}} towards elaboration of the technology of the strained InAlGaAs/GaAs heterostructures for advanced optoelectronic devices working in the visible part of the spectrum.

Although CMg rapidly falls beneath the topmost surface (about 10  nm), CMg is still several orders higher than the theoretical prediction by Equation  1. This phenomenon can be understood in terms of the competition between the <b>Mg</b> <b>incorporation</b> enhancement on the growing surface due to the surface effect and the Mg segregation as the epitaxy continues. Simply, when the surface with the enhanced Mg solubility is covered by newly added layers during further growth, most of these Mg segregates to the new surface to regain equilibrium because the surface transforms into a bulk. Meanwhile, considerable part of these Mg is frozen in because of solidification. As a result, the CMg in the bulk is lower than that of in the final epilayer surface but is much higher than the equilibrium value of the ideal bulk.

This is crucial {{in the investigation of}} benthic foraminifers since the growth of new chambers under laboratory conditions do not face the difficulties associated with experiments involving reproduction. The addition of chambers can be recognized by the incorporation of the fluorescent dye calcein. When added to the culture medium, previously formed chambers are not affected and calcein is only incorporated in calcite that is formed in its presence.

The underlying mechanism responsible for <b>Mg</b> <b>incorporation</b> in foraminiferal calcite and its sensitivity to environmental conditions, however, is not fully identified. A recently published biomineralization model (Nehrke et al., 2013) proposes a combination of transmembrane transport and seawater leakage or vacuolization to link calcite Mg/Ca to seawater Mg/Ca and explains inter-species variability in Mg/Ca ratios. To test the assumptions of this model, we conducted a culture study in which seawater Mg/Ca was manipulated by varying [Ca 2 +] and keeping [Mg 2 +] constant. Foraminiferal growth rates, test thickness and calcite Mg/Ca of newly formed chambers were analyzed.

Calcite Mg/Ca is positively correlated to seawater Mg/Ca, indicating that not absolute seawater [Ca 2 +] and [Mg 2 +], but the telative ratio controls Mg/Ca in tests. These results demonstrate that the calcification process cannot be based only on seawater vacuolization, supporting the mixing model proposed by Nehrke et al. (2013).

DNA A-tracts, which exhibit sequence-induced curvature, adopt a B-DNA conformation as a function of increasing temperature. Fluorescence melting curves indicate that 6 MAP is a more sensitive reporter of the premelting transition than UV absorption spectroscopy. Further, residue specific fluorescence analyses of A-tract and control duplexes reveal that some of the conformational changes associated with the premelting transition occur within A-tract regions. Analyses of the energetics of the premelting transition indicate that ApA steps make a larger enthalpic contribution to the premelting transition than ApT steps.

A. stutchburyi is an intertidal, infaunal, bivalve, widespread in New Zealand coastal regions and throughout the Quaternary-Pliocene sedimentary rock record. Five individuals from Ligar Bay and Estuary (South Island, New Zealand) were analysed to evaluate the variability between individuals calcifying in similar environmental conditions. A further six individuals were sampled from a range of latitudes (38 ˚ to 40 ˚) in the North Island, New Zealand to evaluate variability between individuals from different environments. A strong positive correlation between growth rate and Mg, Al, Mn, Sr, Ba and U/Ca ratios was observed, and a marked negative correlation was found between the same trace element/Ca ratios and ontogenetic age as growth rates slow during the molluscs' life. Thus, biological effects are the primary influence on trace element incorporation in A. stutchburyi. No clear seasonal variations were observed in the Mg and Sr/Ca ratio profiles through A. stutchburyi shells representing time periods of several years. Furthermore, for two shells for which chronologies could be reliably constructed, there were no significant correlations between Mg and Sr/Ca ratios and sea surface temperature. When Mg/Ca ratios were normalised to Sr/Ca ratios in order to eliminate the growth rate effect on trace element incorporation into the mollusc shells, some of the remaining variations appeared to visually correlate positively with sea surface temperature in several sections of a shell. However, a quantitative correlation did not confirm this (r² = 0. 012). It is likely that neither <b>Mg</b> nor Sr <b>incorporation</b> into A. stutchburyi shell are primarily thermodynamically controlled. Several coincident Ba/Ca peaks in two of the Ligar Bay shells are most likely caused by environmental processes such as short periods of phytoplankton blooms or elevated seawater Ba/Ca from river flooding. Mn/Ca and U/Ca variations in A. stutchburyi from different coastal sites with different sediment characteristics appeared to be linked to the redox conditions prevailing at an open ocean sand-dominated environment (Ligar Bay) versus tidal mud flat environments (e. g.

The analysis of foraminifera preserved in ocean sediments {{has been instrumental in}} developing our understanding of global climate, but the mechanisms behind the proxy are largely unknown. Analogies have been drawn to the inorganic precipitation of calcite, where the endothermic substitution of Mg for Ca is favoured at higher temperatures. However, evidence suggests that foraminiferal <b>Mg</b> <b>incorporation</b> may be more complex: foraminiferal magnesium is highly heterogeneous at the sub-micron scale, and high Mg areas coincide with elevated concentrations of organic molecules, Na, S and other trace elements. Fundamentally, the incorporation mode of Mg in foraminifera is unknown. Here we show that Mg is uniformly substituted for Ca within the calcite mineral lattice. The consistency of Mg-specific X-ray spectra gathered from nano-scale regions across the shell (‘test’) reveals that the coordination of Mg is uniform. The similarity of these spectra to that produced by dolomite shows that Mg is present in an octahedral coordination, ideally substituted for Ca in a calcite crystal structure. This demonstrates that Mg is heterogeneous in concentration, but not in structure. The degree of this uniformity implies the action of a continuous <b>Mg</b> <b>incorporation</b> mechanism, and therefore calcification mechanism, across these compositional bands in foraminifera.

Skeletal solubility is partly controlled by the incorporation of "foreign" ions (e. g. magnesium) into the crystal lattice of these skeletal structures, {{a process that is}} sensitive to a variety of biological and environmental factors. Here we explore effects of life stage, oceanographic region of origin, and changes in the partial pressure of carbon dioxide in seawater (p CO 2) on trace elemental composition in the purple sea urchin (Strongylocentrotus purpuratus). We show that, similar to other urchin taxa, adult purple sea urchins have the ability to precipitate skeleton composed of a range of biominerals spanning low- to high-Mg calcites. Mg / Ca and Sr / Ca ratios were substantially lower in adult spines compared to adult tests. On the other hand, trace elemental composition was invariant among adults collected from four oceanographically distinct regions spanning a range of carbonate chemistry conditions (Oregon, Northern California, Central California, and Southern California). Skeletons of newly settled juvenile urchins that originated from adults from the four regions exhibited intermediate Mg / Ca and Sr / Ca between adult spine and test endmembers, indicating that skeleton precipitated during early life stages is more soluble than adult spines and less soluble than adult tests. Mean skeletal Mg / Ca or Sr / Ca of juvenile skeleton did not vary with source region when larvae were reared under present-day, global-average seawater carbonate conditions (400 μatm; pH T = 8. 02 ± 0. 03 1 SD; Ω calcite = 3. 3 ± 0. 2 1 SD). However, when reared under elevated p CO 2 (900 μatm; pH T = 7. 73 ± 0. 03; Ω calcite = 1. 8 ± 0. 1), skeletal Sr / Ca in juveniles exhibited increased variance across the four regions. Although larvae from the northern populations (Oregon, Northern California, Central California) did not exhibit differences in <b>Mg</b> or Sr <b>incorporation</b> under elevated p CO 2 (Sr / Ca = 2. 10 ± 0. 06 mmol mol − 1; Mg / Ca = 67. 4 ± 3. 9 mmol mol − 1), juveniles of Southern California origin partitioned ~ 8 % more Sr into their skeletons when exposed to higher p CO 2 (Sr / Ca = 2. 26 ± 0. 08 vs. 2. 09 ± 0. 005 mmol mol − 1 1 SD). Together these results suggest that the diversity of carbonate minerologies present across different skeletal structures and life stages in purple sea urchins does not translate into an equivalent geochemical plasticity of response associated with geographic variation or temporal shifts in seawater properties. Rather, composition of S. purpuratus skeleton precipitated during both early and adult life history stages appears relatively robust to spatial gradients and predicted future changes in carbonate chemistry. An exception to this trend may arise during early life stages, where certain populations of purple sea urchins may alter skeletal mineral precipitation rates and composition beyond a given p CO 2 threshold. This potential for geochemical plasticity during early development in contrast to adult stage geochemical resilience adds to the growing body of evidence that ocean acidification can have differing effects across organismal life stages...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Mg= Ca ratios in foraminiferal {{tests are}} {{routinely}} used as paleotemperature proxies, but on long timescales, they also hold {{the potential to}} reconstruct past seawater Mg= Ca. The impact of both temperature and seawater Mg= Ca on <b>Mg</b> <b>incorporation</b> in Foraminifera has been quantified {{by a number of}} studies. The underlying mechanism responsible for <b>Mg</b> <b>incorporation</b> in foraminiferal calcite and its sensitivity to environmental conditions, however, has not been fully identified. A recently published biomineralization model (Nehrke et al., 2013) proposes a combination of transmembrane transport and seawater leakage or vacuolization to link calcite Mg= Ca to seawater Mg= Ca and explains interspecies variability in Mg= Ca ratios. To test the assumptions of this model, we conducted a culture study in which seawater Mg= Ca was manipulated by varying [Ca 2 C] and keeping [Mg 2 C] constant. Foraminiferal growth rates, test thickness and calcite Mg= Ca of newly formed chambers were analyzed. Results showed optimum growth rates and test thickness at Mg= Ca closest to that of ambient seawater. Calcite Mg= Ca is positively correlated to seawater Mg= Ca, indicating that it is not absolute seawater [Ca 2 C] and [Mg 2 C] but their ratio that controls Mg= Ca in tests. These results demonstrate that the calcification process cannot be based only on seawater vacuolization, supporting the mixing model proposed by Nehrke et al. (2013). Here, however, we suggest transmembrane transport fractionation that is not as strong as suggested by Nehrke et al. (2013) ...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Calcite {{crystals}} were nucleated from MgCl 2 /CaCl 2 solutions onto functionalized self-assembled monolayers adsorbed onto E-beam evaporated Au films. Synchrotron X-ray scattering {{studies of}} the crystals reveal new information about preferred orientation and <b>Mg</b> <b>incorporation.</b> The Au [111] axis is distributed within 2. 6 ° of the film surface normal, but the oriented crystals may be tilted up to 6 ° away from this axis. For low Mg 2 + content, SO 3 [...] functionalized films nucleated primarily near the (106) calcite face, odd-chain-length carboxylic acid terminated alkanethiol films nucleated near the (012) face, and even-chain-length carboxylic acid terminated alkanethiol films nucleated near the (113) face. [Mg 2 +]/[Ca 2 +] concentration ratios (n) of 2 and greater defeated this preferred orientation and created a powder texture. Diffraction patterns within the layer plane from the coarse calcite powders indicated a shift to higher 2 ı accompanied by peak broadening with increasing n. For 0. 5 < n < 3. 5, a double set of calcite peaks is observed, showing that two distinct Mg calcite phases form: one of comparatively lower Mg content, derived from the templated crystals, and a Mg-rich phase derived from amorphous precursor particles. According to the refinement of lattice parameters, <b>Mg</b> <b>incorporation</b> of up to 18 mol % occurs for n) 4, independent of film functionality. We discuss {{the differences between the}} differently functionalized monolayers and also introduce the hypothesis that two separate routes to Mg calcite formation occur in this system...|$|E
