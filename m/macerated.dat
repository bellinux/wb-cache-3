5|$|There {{are several}} types of plant oils, {{distinguished}} by the method used to extract the oil from the plant. The relevant part of the plant may be placed under pressure to extract the oil, giving an expressed (or pressed) oil. The oils included in this list are of this type. Oils may also be extracted from plants by dissolving parts of plants in water or another solvent. The solution may {{be separated from the}} plant material and concentrated, giving an extracted or leached oil. The mixture may also be separated by distilling the oil away from the plant material. Oils extracted by this latter method are called essential oils. Essential oils often have different properties and uses than pressed or leached vegetable oils. Finally, <b>macerated</b> oils are made by infusing parts of plants in a base oil, a process called liquid-liquid extraction.|$|E

The plant was collected from Tindouf region (Far Southwest Algerian). In this study we performed a phytochemical screening and evaluation of antibacterial activity of three <b>macerates</b> of two vegetative parts (seeds and stems) by two methods (disk and wells diffusion method). Given the results, it appears that <b>macerates</b> obtained were rich in bioactive phyto-constituents particularly the seed of the plant. They showed the presence of ten large chemical groups. The yield of aqueous, methanolic and etheric <b>macerates</b> of the seeds and stems were (5, 1; 3, 8), (5; 1, 4) and (2; 0, 95) % respectively. The antibiotic resistance profile of the bacterial strains tested showed an increased resistance against several antibiotics families.

The long history of Italian rosés, particularly in the warm {{southern part of the}} country, stem from difficulties {{in the early days of}} winemaking to make dark, fully colored dry red wines without temperature controlled fermentation vessels. As the must <b>macerated</b> with the skins, the intense heat of the process would often kill the yeast resulting in a stuck fermentation and residual sugar in the remaining wine. Eventually Italian winemakers realized that if they pressed the wines early in the process, remaining the skins, they could complete the fermentation albeit with a lightly colored wine.|$|E
25|$|The {{first step}} in {{processing}} the grapes at the winery is to separate {{the components of the}} wort that are needed from the unwanted parts. The process followed at this stage will largely determine the future quality of the wine. For this, the clusters are generally shaken then trampled. The practice of moderate trampling allows the grains to burst, releasing the juice and pulp (it cannot be used for white wine from black grapes as the premature bursting of the berries would cause a coloured must). The practice of shaking or stalking has the advantage of separating the stems from the cluster of grapes and avoids giving the wine a herbaceous taste at pressing. The skin is not <b>macerated</b> and the transparent yellow colour is retained.|$|E

Wasps were reported to share this food with other adults and offer the protein in a <b>macerated</b> form to larvae. The water gathered by workers is placed directly onto {{the walls of the}} nest cells, usually without any contact with other wasps. Wood pulp and fibers are collected primarily for nest building. Wasps return to the nest with a solid mass taken in the mouthparts; they are usually smaller and darker than the prey crop. P. exigua has the habit of building white or light brown nests, so the item taken to the nest for colony growth was white and larger than the prey. This item is chewed, mixed with saliva and incorporated in the cell walls. Resin is gathered in order to build layers within the nest. Workers carrying resin to the nest travel to substrate sheets and proceed to lay their foraged material on top of the structure. This new layer remains there until the sheets stuck together and formed a stronger partition.|$|E

Initial, wines presented specific features of grapes variety from which they belong, being characterized by harmony and complex flavor. The hydroalcoholic <b>macerates</b> were obtained by preparing two recipes (labeled I and II) of different mixtures of plants. Recipes I A in 45 % alcohol and I B in 60 % alcohol, had characteristics of appearance, color, taste and smell, very intense, specific, prevailing the taste of anise, fennel and coriander. The <b>macerates</b> prepared with recipes II A in 45 % alcohol and II B in 60 % alcohol (mixture of a few herbs and peel of citrus fruits) showed peculiarities of taste, odor, flavor less intense, prevailing the smell of nutmeg and citrus flavor.

The aim {{of the current study}} was to evaluate the contribution of amino acids to the odour of a natural prey organism of the Senegalese sole (Solea senegalensis). Both whole-body <b>macerates</b> and substances released to the water by living ragworms (Hediste diversicolor) were fractionated by molecular weight filtration followed by solid-phase extraction (SPE), and the olfactory activity of the resultant fractions was assessed by the electro-olfactogram (EOG) in the sole. The amino acid concentrations of the <b>macerate</b> and water were determined by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry (GC–MS). In the <b>macerate,</b> the majority of odorants were small molecular weight compounds (b 500 Da) which were not retained by C- 18 SPE cartridges. An artificial mixture of amino acids at the same concentrations as found in the <b>macerate</b> had similar olfactory potency. The odorants released to the water by living ragworms were also small molecular weight compounds (b 500 Da) but the majority of olfactory activity could be extracted by C- 18 SPE cartridges. The concentrations of amino acids in these samples were too low to contribute greatly to its olfactory potency. These results suggest that, whilst olfactory sensitivity to amino acids may explain most of the potency of the <b>macerate,</b> living ragworms are releasing additional odorants other than amino acids which may be equally important in chemosensory food location in the sole...|$|R

40|$|Hypericum perforatum L. (Hypericaceae), or St. John's Wort, is a {{well-known}} medicinal herb often associated with the treatment of anxiety and depression. Additionally, an oil <b>macerate</b> (Oleum Hyperici) of its flowering aerial parts is widely used in traditional medicine across the Balkans as a topical wound and ulcer salve. Other {{studies have shown that}} Oleum Hyperici reduces both wound size and healing time. Of its active constituents, the naphthodianthrone hypericin and phloroglucinol hyperforin are effective antibacterial compounds against various Gram-positive bacteria. However, hyperforin is unstable with light and heat, and thus should not be present in the light-aged oil <b>macerate.</b> Additionally, hypericin can cause phototoxic skin reactions if ingested or absorbed into the skin. Therefore, the established chemistry presents a paradox for this H. perforatum oil macerate: the hyperforin responsible for the antibacterial bioactivity should degrade in the sunlight as the traditional oil is prepared; alternately, if hypericin is present in established bioactive levels, then the oil <b>macerate</b> should cause photosensitivity, yet none is reported. In this research, various extracts of H. perforatum were compared to traditional oil <b>macerates</b> with regards to chemical composition and antibacterial activity (inhibition of growth, biofilm formation, and quorum sensing) vs. several strains of Staphylococcus aureus in order to better understand this traditional medicine. It was found that four Kosovar-crafted oil <b>macerates</b> were effective at inhibiting biofilm formation (MBIC 50 active range of 0. 004 – 0. 016 % v/v), exhibited moderate inhibition of quorum sensing (QSIC 50 active range of 0. 064 – 0. 512 % v/v), and contained detectable amounts of hyperforin, but not hypericin. Overall, levels of hypericin were much higher in the organic extracts, and these also exhibited more potent growth inhibitory activity. In conclusion, these data confirm that oil <b>macerates</b> employed in traditional treatments of skin infection lack the compound credited with phototoxic reactions in H. perforatum use and exhibit anti-biofilm and modest quorum quenching effects, rather than growth inhibitory properties against S. aureus...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Ethnopharmacological {{relevance}} The oil <b>macerates</b> of Hypericum perforatum L. (St. John׳s Wort=SJW) have a {{long history}} of medicinal use and SJW has been used in traditional medicine both orally and topically for centuries worldwide mainly for wound healing, ulcer and inflammation. Materials and methods We analyzed the fatty acid composition of 10 traditionally (home-made) and 13 commercially (ready-made) prepared SJW oil <b>macerates</b> by GC–MS. The acid, peroxide, iodine, saponification values, and the unsaponifiable matters of the samples were determined according to the European Pharmacopoeia. We also explored potential mechanism of wound healing effect of the samples, i. e. TNFα-induced NF-κB activation. Results The most home-made oil samples contained oleic acid predominantly and complied with the requirements set for olive oil by European Pharmacopoeia. However, majority of the ready-made samples appeared to have adulteration with some other oils. Moderate NF-κB inhibitory effects have been observed with some of the oil samples. Conclusion This study sheds light on the fact that application of the proper traditional method to prepare olive oil <b>macerates</b> from Hypericum perforatum is able to get bioactive constituents in the oil. Besides, inhibition of TNFα-induced NF-κB activation appears to be a potential mechanism for topical wound healing activity of SJW oil <b>macerates...</b>|$|R
