5|$|Lack of {{differentiation}} between homosexual and heterosexual women in medical studies that concentrate on health issues for women skews results for lesbians and non-lesbian women. Reports are inconclusive about occurrence {{of breast cancer}} in lesbians. It has been determined, however, that the lower rate of lesbians tested by regular Pap smears <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> to detect cervical cancer at early stages in lesbians. The risk factors for developing ovarian cancer rates are higher in lesbians than heterosexual women, perhaps because many lesbians lack protective factors of pregnancy, abortion, contraceptives, breast feeding, and miscarriages.|$|E
5|$|The spiny scallop {{usually has}} a {{symbiotic}} relationship with an encrusting sponge which grows on its left valve. This is most often the orange Myxilla incrustans but is sometimes the purple or brown Mycale adherens. The sponge provides camouflage for the scallop and may deter predators from attacking it as sponges often produce a repulsive odour and tend to be distasteful. It also <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> for a starfish to get the strong grip with its tube feet {{that it needs to}} force the two valves of the scallop apart.|$|E
5|$|Predators {{of adult}} nuthatches include owls and diurnal {{birds of prey}} (such as sharp-shinned and Cooper's hawks), and nestlings and eggs are eaten by woodpeckers, small squirrels, and {{climbing}} snakes such as the western rat snake. The white-breasted nuthatch responds to predators near the nest by flicking its wings while making hn-hn calls. When a bird leaves the nest hole, it wipes around the entrance with a piece of fur or vegetation; this <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> for a predator to find the nest using its sense of smell. The nuthatch may also smear blister beetles around the entrance to its nest, and {{it has been suggested that}} the unpleasant smell from the crushed insects deters squirrels, its chief competitor for natural tree cavities. The estimated average lifespan of this nuthatch is two years, but the record is twelve years and nine months.|$|E

5|$|The strict {{definition}} of Heinrich events is the climatic event causing the IRD layer observed in marine sediment cores from the North Atlantic: a massive collapse of northern hemisphere ice shelves {{and the consequent}} release of a prodigious volume of icebergs. By extension, the name Heinrich events can also refer to the associated climatic anomalies registered at other places around the globe, at approximately the same time periods. The events are rapid: they last probably less than a millennium, a duration varying from one event to the next, and their abrupt onset may occur in mere years (Maslin et al. 2001). Heinrich events are clearly observed in many North Atlantic marine sediment cores covering the last glacial period; the lower resolution of the sedimentary record before this point <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> to deduce whether they occurred during other glacial periods in the Earth's history. Some (Broecker 1994, Bond & Lotti 1995) identify the Younger Dryas event as a Heinrich event, {{which would make it}} event H0 (table, right).|$|E

25|$|Following {{radiation}} therapy {{of any type}} for prostate cancer, some PSA levels might be detected, even when the treatment ultimately proves to be successful.

PSA levels may continue to decrease for several years after radiation therapy. The lowest level {{is referred to as}} the PSA nadir. A subsequent increase in PSA levels by 2.0nbsp&ng/dL above the nadir is the currently accepted definition of prostate cancer recurrence after radiation therapy.|$|E
25|$|There {{is strong}} {{evidence}} from genetics that all organisms {{have a common}} ancestor. For example, every living cell makes use of nucleic acids as its genetic material, and uses the same twenty amino acids as the building blocks for proteins. All organisms use the same genetic code (with some extremely rare and minor deviations) to translate nucleic acid sequences into proteins. The universality of these traits strongly suggests common ancestry, because the selection {{of many of these}} traits seems arbitrary. Horizontal gene transfer <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> to study the last universal ancestor. However, the universal use of the same genetic code, same nucleotides, and same amino acids makes the existence of such an ancestor overwhelmingly likely.|$|E
25|$|The {{center of}} mass is an {{important}} point on an aircraft, which significantly affects {{the stability of the}} aircraft. To ensure the aircraft is stable enough to be safe to fly, the {{center of mass}} must fall within specified limits. If the center of mass is ahead of the forward limit, the aircraft will be less maneuverable, possibly {{to the point of being}} unable to rotate for takeoff or flare for landing. If the center of mass is behind the aft limit, the aircraft will be more maneuverable, but also less stable, and possibly so unstable that it is impossible to fly. The moment arm of the elevator will also be reduced, which <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> to recover from a stalled condition.|$|E
