50|$|Melica nutans, {{known as}} <b>mountain</b> <b>melick,</b> is a grass {{species in the}} Poaceae family, native to European, Eurasian, and Asian forests.|$|E
50|$|Lower {{down the}} valley, species {{including}} alpine cinquefoil, lily-of-the-valley, <b>mountain</b> <b>melick</b> and herb paris, blue sesleria, common valerian and wild angelica. The limestone outcrops have uncommon species including rock whitebeam and Solomon's seal {{as well as}} bird's-eye primrose, butterwort, rockrose, dropwort and limestone bedstraw.|$|E
50|$|Ferns {{found here}} include wall rue, maidenhair spleenwort, brittle bladder-fern, Hart's-tongue and hard shield-fern. In Upper Wharfedale the scars and screes support {{a range of}} plants {{including}} the alpine cinquefoil and hoary whitlowgrass. Also to be found are lesser meadow-rue, goldenrod, scabious and bloody crane's-bill with, to a lesser extent, <b>mountain</b> <b>melick,</b> limestone fern, wood crane's-bill and melancholy thistle, green spleenwort, wall lettuce and hairy stonecrop.|$|E
5000|$|Lillering Forest and {{surroundings}} {{has been}} known as a botanically interesting locality for many years with the earliest description dating back to 1877 (Zahrtmann 1877). Some 400 vascular plants have been registered, {{about a third of}} Danish plants. A number of plants primarily exist in south-eastern Denmark, and further south, with the northern boundary being at or around Aarhus and some of these are well represented in Lillering Forest. The most important might be hornbeam which has a significant presence. Others are plants such as dead-nettles, white butterbur, bitter-cress, wall barley, yellow and blue anemone and the endangered multicolored viola. In addition a total of nine species of orchids have been registered although in later years only six has been noted - these are the broad-leaved helleborine, green-flowered helleborine, early-purple orchid, western marsh orchid, early marsh-orchid, eggleaf twayblade and the greater butterfly-orchid. The border zone between Tåstrup Bog and Lillering Forest contains woodland geranium and <b>mountain</b> <b>melick.</b> The area contains several rare species of geometer moths associated with buckthorns that grow at the woodland edge or in Tåstrup Bog. The nearby meadows is home to a rare, small owl that lives on species of mouse-ear chickweed. The meadows in the forest has a number of moths such as the six-spot burnet which are endangered in Denmark. Some 6 species are registered of which 3 in Jutland are found only here and 4 are associated with hackberry at the woodland edge. The stream Bøgebakke Bæk has a large population of the uncommon mayfly siphlonurus aestivalis. == Natura 2000 == The Natura 2000 protected area includes Tåstrup Lake and adjoining wetlands (c. 20 ha.), Tåstrup Bog (c. 25 ha.), Lillering Forest (ca. 50 ha.) and Stjær Forest consisting of the forests Søskov and Stjær Stenskov (c. 20 ha). The four areas are not connected since former agricultural land separates Lillering Forest and Tåstrup Bog to the north and Tåstrup Lake and Stjær Forest to the south.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis study tracks local {{vegetation}} {{change in}} West Cornwall (South West England) within regional context, using historic herbarium (pre- 1900) and recent vegetation records (post- 1900). The focus centres on species lost {{from the region}} over the past century. For this study we used a collection of herbarium records published in 1909 (Davey’s “Flora of Cornwall”) and contemporary records from the “New Atlas of British and Irish Flora” downloaded from the National Biodiversity Network (NBN), online database. Both data sets were spatially analysed using ArcGIS in order to detect local scale species loss. Our results showed that species loss was highest in the south (11 plant species), compared to the loss from middle areas (6 plant species) and in the northern area (8 plant species) of West Cornwall. Results on species change at the local scale were different to {{the changes that are}} happening at the national scale. Loss from West Cornwall was detected for two plant species, <b>Mountain</b> <b>Melick</b> (Melica nutans) and Field Eryngo (Eryngium campestare). These key results amplify the importance of local scale research and conservation in order to protect ecosystems functioning, genetic diversity, ecosystem services and regional identity...|$|E
