40|$|The {{investigation}} {{of the potential for}} a criticality incident involving plutonium components in the modified-Richmond and steel _rch construction (SAC) magazines was undertaken in two complementary, but separate, steps. The first approach, generally termed deterministic, was to model the pits and containers in their most reactive configuration and then to estimate the effective multiplication factor (k°,) of the array for a number of postulated scenarios. The second approach involved a structured examination of the potential for a criticality incident. This approach examines the conditions required for criticality and the likelihood that those conditions could be met. These two approaches are discussed below. A calculations were made by one analyst and verified by a second analyst as a quality assurance measure. E. 1 Deterministic Model In this approach, the initial step involved developing a conservative physical model of the packages and facility to be studied. This model was then converted to an analytical model and estimates of k., were generated for several scenarios. E. 1. 1 Physical Model The initial model selected represents the most reactive configuration of plutonium pits and containers that could be stored on a interim basis in the magazine. That is, each pit is assumed to have the largest mass and smallest volume that might be anticipated and to reside in the container of smallest volume. The maximum allowable number of containers is assumed to be in the magazine. I The pits are modeled as a spherical shell of plutonium with an assumed mass of 6. 5 kilograms (kg). The pit is assumed to be centered in the container. For modelling purposes, the Rocky Flats AL-R 8 package was selected. The smallest container of this series is the 2030, nominally a container with a 20 -inch diameter and a 30 -inch height. Actually, the 2030 is an 18 -gauge (0. 048 -inch thickness) steel can with a <b>minimum</b> <b>inside</b> <b>diameter</b> of 18. 12 inche...|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{suspension}} parameters and driving conditions on dynamic load-sharing of longitudinal-connected air suspensions of a tri-axle semi-trailer are investigated in this study. A novel nonlinear {{model of a}} multi-axle semi-trailer with longitudinal-connected air suspensions is formulated based on fluid mechanics and thermodynamics and validated through test results. The effects of road surface conditions, driving speeds, air line <b>inside</b> <b>diameter</b> and connector <b>inside</b> <b>diameter</b> on dynamic load-sharing capability of the semi-trailer were analyzed in terms of load-sharing criteria. Simulation results indicate that, when larger air lines and connectors are employed, the DLSC (Dynamic Load-Sharing Coefficient) optimization ratio reaches its peak value when the road roughness is medium. The optimization ratio fluctuates in a complex manner as driving speed increases. The results also indicate that if the air line <b>inside</b> <b>diameter</b> is always assumed to be larger than the connector <b>inside</b> <b>diameter,</b> the influence of air line <b>inside</b> <b>diameter</b> on load-sharing is more significant {{than that of the}} connector <b>inside</b> <b>diameter.</b> The proposed approach can be used for further study of the influence of additional factors (such as vehicle load, static absolute air pressure and static height of air spring) on load-sharing and the control methods for multi-axle air suspensions with longitudinal air line...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the mechanical factors involved in the genesis of lower esophageal sphincter pressure. We determined the relationship between intraluminal pressure and <b>inside</b> <b>diameter,</b> estimated the ratio between the wall thickness to inside radius, and calculated the tension in the wall of the lower esophageal sphincter as a function of the <b>inside</b> <b>diameter.</b> Various degrees of circumferential stretch were applied by introducing probes of different diameters in the rat lower esophageal sphincter in vivo. The intraluminal pressure produced by the lower esophageal sphincter around each probe was measured and pressure-diameter curves were constructed during (a) resting state, (b) contraction produced by electrical stimulation, and (c) relaxation produced by esophageal distension. The intraluminal pressure at an <b>inside</b> <b>diameter</b> of 0. 5 mm was similar to that at <b>inside</b> <b>diameter</b> of 3. 2 mm. This was true for the sphincter at rest as well as upon electrical stimulation. The pressure diameter curve, however, was sigmoid in shape; at first it showed a decline and then an increase followed by decline in pressure again with increasing diameters. The ratio of wall thickness to inside radius or the magnification factor varied with <b>inside</b> <b>diameters</b> as expected and this ratio increased steeply at small <b>inside</b> <b>diameters.</b> The tension diameter curves of the sphincter muscle showed that optimal tension development occurred not near sphincter closure but at a much wider diameter of 3. 2 mm and that this muscle developed tension even at small luminal diameters. This behavior of the sphincter muscle ensures effective intraluminal pressure over a wide range of luminal diameters...|$|R
