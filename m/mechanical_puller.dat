30|$|Nanomeniscus-induced {{delivery}} of liquid solutions for fabrication {{of the diverse}} NFs is realized by using a nanopipette combined with quartz tuning fork (QTF)-based AFM [20] which was previous nanofluidic and lithographical results. The pulled glass nanopipette, fabricated by a <b>mechanical</b> <b>puller</b> (P- 2000, Sutter Instrument Co.), with controlled aperture diameters of ~ 100 nm and ~ 500 nm, serves as a nano-nozzle for drawing of low-volume liquid solutions (Additional file 1 : Figure S 1). When the nanopipette tip, which is a reservoir filled with various liquids such as nanoparticle, CNT, polystyrene solutions, approaches the substrate within ~ 2 nm, the capillary-condensed water naturally forms in the nanopipette-substrate gap in ambient conditions [21]. This water nanobridge plays a mediating role of a nanoscale liquid channel through which the liquid solution is continuously delivered at any desired locations, {{even in the absence}} of applied electric fields once the nanobridge is connected. As the tip retracts at variable speeds, the nanomaterial solutions inside the pipette continue to be pulled out to produces the diverse NFs, consisting of aggregated nanomaterials with the solution itself evaporated in air. Note that the non-contact mode operation of AFM can be achieved due to the high stiffness of the QTF, which produces the well-defined and well-characterized NF preform, while protecting the tip damage and allowing its repetitive and reliable use.|$|E
40|$|Once {{a process}} cycle has been completed, glass condom molds {{are removed from}} {{spindles}} that connect them to the process equipment. Currently, glass molds are removed by destroying the glass around the spindle, resulting in safety hazards from glass shards, monetary loss due to replacement cost, and also loss of money due to the labor cost associated with time spent cleaning up the glass shards and breaking the molds. To solve the dilemma, the sponsor demanded a safe, cost efficient method or addition that would not harm the process during the cycle nor damage the spindle and glass molds at any moment. Two routes were concocted, chemical (lubricants, rubber grommet specifications) and mechanical (rotational torque puller). After experimentation with both chemical and mechanical options, a purely mechanical option was decided upon once the cost effectiveness and the simplicity of use for the proposed device were noticed. A working prototype was constructed and experimented with success trials in {{the removal of the}} glass condom molds from the spindles within given constraints. Currently, the only issues remaining with the project are making sure that the <b>mechanical</b> <b>puller</b> becomes automated, and making sure that it is completed by the Senior Design Expo. This project will impact Church 2 ̆ 6 Dwight Co., Inc. by saving them a minimum of 13, 000 per year in labor, and will enable them to increase the safety and efficiency of their manufacturing plant while eliminating most of the replacement cost of the glass molds. Society would greatly benefit from this project due to the increased production of various condoms causing further evolution of condoms and ultimately protected sex. [URL]...|$|E

40|$|Clp ATPases are {{powerful}} ring shaped nanomachines which {{participate in the}} degradation pathway of the protein quality control system, coupling the energy from ATP hydrolysis to threading substrate proteins (SP) through their narrow central pore. Repetitive cycles of sequential intra-ring ATP hydrolysis events induce axial excursions of diaphragm-forming central pore loops that effect the application of mechanical forces onto SPs to promote unfolding and translocation. We perform Langevin dynamics simulations of a coarse-grained model of the ClpY ATPase-SP system to elucidate the molecular details of unfolding and translocation of an α/β model protein. We contrast this mechanism with our previous studies which used an all-α SP. We find conserved aspects of unfolding and translocation mechanisms by allosteric ClpY, including unfolding initiated at the tagged C-terminus and translocation via a power stroke mechanism. Topology-specific aspects include the time scales, the rate limiting steps in the degradation pathway, the effect of force directionality, and the translocase efficacy. Mechanisms of ClpY-assisted unfolding and translocation are distinct from those resulting from non-allosteric <b>mechanical</b> <b>pulling.</b> Bulk unfolding simulations, which mimic Atomic Force Microscopy-type pulling, reveal multiple unfolding pathways initiated at the C-terminus, N-terminus, or simultaneously from both termini.

Notch and its ligands are integral membrane proteins that facilitate direct cell-cell interactions to activate Notch proteolysis and release the intracellular domain that directs Notch-specific cellular responses. Genetic studies suggest that Notch ligands require endocytosis, ubiquitylation, and epsin endocytic adaptors to activate signaling, but the exact role of ligand endocytosis remains unresolved. Here we characterize a molecularly distinct mode of clathrin-mediated endocytosis requiring ligand ubiquitylation, epsins, and actin for ligand cells to activate signaling in Notch cells. Using a cell-bead optical tweezers system, we obtained evidence for cell-mediated mechanical force dependent on this distinct mode of ligand endocytosis.

40|$|We solve a two {{dimensional}} model for polymer chain folding {{in the presence}} of <b>mechanical</b> <b>pulling</b> force ($f$) exactly using equilibrium statistical mechanics. Using analytically derived expression for the partition function we determine the phase diagram for the model in the $f$-temperature ($T$) plane. A square root singularity in the susceptibility indicates a second order phase transition from a folded to an unfolded state at a critical force ($f_c$) in the thermodynamic limit of infinitely long polymer chain. Surprisingly, the temperature dependence of $f_c$ shows a reentrant phase transition, which is reflected in an increase in $f_c$ as $T$ increases below a threshold value. For a range of $f$ values, the unfolded state is stable at both low and high temperatures. The high temperature unfolded state is stabilized by entropy whereas the low temperature unfolded state is dominated by favorable energy. The exact calculation could serve as a bench mark for testing approximate theories that are used in analyzing single molecule pulling experiments. Comment: 2 figure...|$|R

Here, we assessed {{the reason for the}} different effects of the Y 9 P mutation of I 27 on the overall molecular stability and N-terminal unraveling by NMR. We found that the Y 9 P mutation causes a conformational change that is transmitted through β-sheet structures to reach the central hydrophobic core in the interior and alters its accessibility to bulk solvent, which leads to destabilization of the hydrophobic core. On the other hand, the Y 9 P mutation causes a bend in the backbone structure, which leads to the formation of a more stable N-terminal structure probably through enhanced hydrophobic interactions...|$|R

We find that the magnitude of active contraction depends on the rate of <b>mechanical</b> <b>pulling,</b> but the cell tension can recover. The model also predicts that the cell exerts stronger contractile forces against a stiffer external environment, and therefore exhibits features of mechanosensation.

The driving forces are applied in pulses, which allows the system to relax between pulses, resulting in more accurate unfolding force estimations than in previous methods. In the cases of titin, ubiquitin and e 2 lip 3, the PUFF trajectories produce force fluctuations that agree quantitatively with AFM experiments.
