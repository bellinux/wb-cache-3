5|$|On an {{ordinary}} day at Springfield Elementary, Lisa attempts to <b>make</b> <b>friends</b> <b>with</b> a new girl, Francine (who {{is much larger}} and tougher than Lisa), but Francine beats up Lisa severely. Even attempting to share an interest in Malibu Stacy does not work since the doll that Francine has {{turns out to be}} Lisa's, which she then ruins. Lisa attempts to hire the school bullies (Nelson, Jimbo, Dolph, and Kearney) to protect her, but they decline since girls fight dirtier than boys (and boys tend to be more vulnerable to falling in love). It is up to Lisa to investigate by herself the reason why Francine is targeting her.|$|E

25|$|One {{important}} aspect of shyness is social skills development. Schools and parents may implicitly assume children are fully capable of effective social interaction.
