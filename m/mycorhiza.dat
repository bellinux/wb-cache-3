40|$|In {{order to}} {{study the effects of}} {{inoculation}} of rhizobium and <b>mycorhizae</b> on the response of alfafa cultivars to different salinity levels a pot experiment was conducted. The experiment was arranged as factorial in a randomized complete block design with three replications. The treatments included three alfafa cultivars (Rehnani, Hamadani and Bami), four levels of salinity (0, 60, 120 and 180 mmol (NaCl), and four inoculations (rhizobium, <b>mycorhizae,</b> rhizobium + <b>mycorhizae,</b> and control). There was a decrease in plant height, leaf area, shoot and root dry matter, percentage of <b>mycorhizae</b> infection, and root characteristics. The highest amounts of the above-mentioned growth characteristics were obtained in rhizobium + <b>mycorhizae,</b> <b>mycorhizae,</b> rhizobium, and control, respectively. The highest values of root mycorhizal infection and the number and weight of nodules were also achieved in dual inoculation treatment. Root was more affected than shoot by inoculation. The extent of positive effect of <b>mycorhizae</b> on alfalfa was greater than that of rhizobium. Rehnani was recognized to be more a salt tolerant cultivar as compared to Hamadani and Bami. The decrease in plant dry matter due to salinity was more in non-inoculated than in inoculated treatments. The results of our experiment showed that coinoculation of rhizobium and <b>mycorhizae</b> may cause synergistic effects on alfalfa dry matter accumulation. However, dual inoculation was not significantly superior to other inoculation treatments in terms of the alleviation of salinity effects...|$|R
50|$|Mycorrhizae {{include a}} broad variety of root-fungi {{interactions}} characterized by mode of colonization. Essentially all plants form mycorrhizal associations, {{and there is}} evidence that some mycorrhizae transport carbon and other nutrients not just from soil to plant, but also between different plants in a landscape. The main groups include ectomycorrhizae, arbuscular <b>mycorhizae,</b> ericoid mycorrhizae, orchid mycorrhizae, and monotropoid mycorrhizae. Monotropoid mycorrhizae are associated with plants in the monotropaceae, which lack chlorophyll. Many Orchids are also achlorophyllous for at least part of their life cycle. Thus these mycorrhizal-plant relationships are unique because the fungus provides the host with carbon as well as other nutrients, often by parasitizing other plants. Achlorophyllous plants forming these types of mycorrhizal associations are called mycoheterotrophs.|$|R
40|$|VAM is an obligate {{symbiont}} as {{it requires}} the existant of host plant to perform association in their roots. Consequently, its life cycle cannot be completed in absence of root tissues. This phenomenon make the natural production of <b>mycorhizae</b> impractical. Techniques enabling of mass production of VAM spores used as biofertizer in the field is, therefore, becoming important. Purpose {{of this study was}} to compare the effectiveness of spore production using petridisk and test tube and to characterize the morphological performance of three VAM, namely Glomus, Gigaspora, and Acaulospora. Results of the study indicated that 1) test tube culture produced more hyphae but took more time than petridisk culture; 2) hyphae life of Gi margarita was shorter than the other VAM and it was not determined by culture technique; 3) Gi. margarita showed a faster sporulation than the other VAM and it was consistent over the two culture techniques; and 4) The propagule mortality was lower in the test tube at similar rate over period of time, while in petridisk it tended to increased. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{subject of}} {{study was the}} {{population}} of critical endangered species with arcto-alpine distribution—Arctous alpina (L.) Nied. (Ericaceae). The aim of this work was the acquirement of the information about generative reproduction of the species. During the research we used regular non-destructive methods of population biology. Inquiries of terrain data were realized by random choice in the population in Belianske Tatry Mts (Northern Slovakia). We made out a variable number of flowers on the ramet. Generative reproduction potential of population was very low. Average width of fruits was 6. 98 mm and length 8. 8 mm. Average fruits' mass was 0. 268 g. Average mass of one fruit's seeds 0. 029 g represents 10. 82 % of average fruits' mass. In every fruit was found 5 seeds. The presence {{of at least one}} aborted seed was registered in 55. 2 % of the whole number of fruits. We observed no seedlings at the locality. The population survives through vegetative reproduction. The most important reasons of abortive generative reproduction are climatic conditions at the time of flowering, too low number of safe sites, necessary of <b>mycorhizas</b> and endozoochory type of spreading, plants' species competition and influence of chamois.

There is currently a lack {{of information about the}} application of  indigenous Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) to increase the Barangan banana resistance to BDB. A greenhouse experiment was conducted to evaluate the increase resistance Barangan banana to  3 (three) types of AMF (Glomus type- 1; Acaulospora type- 4 and Glomus fasciculatum) and control (without AMF) with 3 replicates. Barangan banana plantlet were inoculated with 50 g fresh AMF inoculants and at 14 days after acclimating have transplanted to soil contaminated BDB. Observation on the Barangan banana seedlings was done after 5 - 60 days after application  included percentage disease, severity disease, incubation periode, BDB population in rhizosfer and AMF percentage root colonization. The result indicated that AMF increased Barangan banana resistance to BDB. Glomus type- 1 and G. fasciculatum increased banana resistance by 100 % while Acaulospora type- 4 takes 66. 67 % and control none. The disease severity with Acaulospora tipe- 4 is 6 % lower than controls (32. 6 %). The highest suppression level was  found in 2 isolates of Glomus application was 100 % and was followed Acaulospora type- 4 is 81. 59 %. The low intensity of on FMA indigenous treatment applications related to the incubation period and BDB density in rhizosphere of plant roots.

40|$|Water {{deficiency}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} important factors for limiting crop yield in arid and semiarid regions. Symbiosis with a variety of microorganisms in these regions {{is one of the}} modern ecological approaches for sustainable agriculture to reduce damages caused by environmental stresses. Symbiotic of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AM) with the roots of crops has shown positive effects on agricultural systems. In order to study the effects of inoculation with two species of mycorrhizal fungi and irrigation levels on root growth criteria and water use efficiency of corn, an experiment was performed as split plots based on a complete randomized block design with three replications at the Agricultural Research Station, Ferdowsi University of Mashhad during growing season of 2008 - 2009. Treatments included two <b>mycorhizae</b> inoculation (Glomus mosseae and G. intraradices and control) and four irrigation levels (25, 50, 75 and 100 % of water requirement). Grain yield, root specific length, the percentage of root colonization and water use efficiency based on grain yield of corn were measured. The results showed that the effect of mycorrhizae inoculation was significant on (p≤ 0. 05) root specific length, grain yield and water use efficiency of corn. Mycorrhizae species had no significant effect on root colonization percentage of corn. Different irrigation levels had significant effect on grain yield, special length root, the percentage of root colonization, and water use efficiency of corn (p≤ 0. 05). Generally, the results showed that mycorrhizae inoculation in water deficiency conditions, can increase the uptake of water and nutrients by developing the root and increasing the absorbing surface. In this way, not only the plant tolerance against the water deficiency increases, but also more yield will be produced for a specific value of water, which means the water use efficiency increases. Furthermore, the use of water will be decreased...|$|R
40|$|Tailings are what’s {{left over}} from mining. The rock where copper, gold, silver and other {{minerals}} found is ground up into fine particles so that the valuable material can be taken out and refined. The solid waste would affect the environment physically and biologically. Characteristics of tailing are high porosity with low water holding capacity, poor organic matter, poor macro and micro nutrients and no microorganism activity. Therefore, it takes time and requires strategy to manage and change them to a more productive area. Many technologies have been applied to rehabilitate tailing for agriculture. The technologies {{including the use of}} manure, compost, mulch, biosolid, chemical fertilizer, microorganism (bacteria, <b>mycorhiza)</b> and phytoremediation. Phytoremediation is the use of plants to remediate selected contaminants in the contaminated soil, sludge, sediment, water (ground, surface, waste water). Phytoremediation encompasses a number of different methods that can lead to contaminant degradation, removal or immobilization. Those methods including phytodegradation/rhizodegradation, phytoextraction, phytovolatilization and phytostabilization. The phytoextraction is inexpensive compared with the conventional technology.

Plant height, canopy diameter, leaf to shoot ratio, shoot dry weight, essential oil content and essential oil yield of hyssop were measured and calculated accordingly. The {{results showed that the}} simple and interaction effects between organic manure and mycorrhiza were significant (p≤ 0. 01) on plant height, canopy diameter, leaf to stem ratio, shoot dry weight and essential oil content and yield of hyssop. By increasing organic manure level from zero to 30 t. ha- 1 enhanced shoot dry weight and essential oil yield of hyssop up to 127 and 43 %, respectively. Whereas by increasing organic manure level up to 40 t. ha- 1 improved these traits up to 12 and 24 %, respectively.

40|$|Introduction Moisture {{limitation}} is {{considered as one}} of the important limiting factors in soybean growth. Drought stress affects different aspects of soybean growth through making anatomical, physiological and biochemical changes (Tarumingkeng & Coto, 2003). Under dry tension condition, there will be a disturbance in transmitting nutrients, but some useful soil fungi such as mycorrhiza improve production of crops under stress through forming colonies in the root and boosting water and nutrient absorption (Al-Karaki et al., 2004). Using vermicompost in sustainable agriculture strengthens support and activities of beneficial soil microorganisms (such as mycorrhizal fungi and phosphate solubilizing microorganisms) in order to provide nutrients required by plants like nitrogen, phosphorus and soluble potassium as well as improving the growth and performance of the crops (Arancon et al., 2004). Materials and methods In order to investigate the effects of vermicompost and mycorrhiza fertilizers on grain yield and some physiological characteristics of soybean under water stress condition an experiment was conducted at Agricultural Research Center of Khorramabad during 2013. The field experiment was carried out based on a randomized complete blocks design arranged in split-plot with four replications. The experiment treatments including irrigation in three levels (after 60, 120 and 180 mm evaporation from pan class A pan), nutrient management in six levels (non-use of vermicompost and <b>mycorhiza</b> fertilizer, inoculated with mycorrhiza fertilizer, consumption of 5 and 10 t. ha- 1 vermicompost, consumption of 5 and 10 t. ha- 1 vermicompost with mycorrhiza) were respectively as the main plots and sub. In current study, RWC, LAI, SPAD were measured during 59 days after planting at the beginning of podding of the control treatment. The temperature of plant leaves were measured by the thermometer (model TM- 958 LUTRON infrared Thermometers). To analyze the growth of grains under different treatments totally 7 samples were performed from flowering to harvest through checking the process of grain weight changes and final grain weight were determined during physiological maturation (when dry grain weight is fixed or changes are not significant). Filling rate and the effective grain filling period were measured using relevant formula. The grain yield measured at the time of maturing after harvesting 3 m² per two middle lines in the plot and through eliminating the fringes of the midfield.

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to examine and describe the <b>mycorhizae</b> associated with Botrychium dissectum and Botrychium virginianum. The objectives also included trying to isolate the fungi associated with them and to analyze the association. Root sections were cleared and stained by placing them in a saturated solution of chloral hydrate and. 01 % acid funchsin. These sections were either boiled for fifteen minutes or allowed to stand in the solution for at least two days. Hand sections were mounted in glycerine. Examination of these sections showed fungi to be present in the younger roots of B. dissectum and in smaller amounts in all of the roots of B. virginianum. Infection occurred through the epidermis by aseptate, multinucleate hyphae which penetrated to the fourth cell layer of the cortex. Hyphenknauel (hyphal coils) were found in this area. Within the fifth and sixth cortical layers of both species were Pilzverdauungszellen (fungal digesting cells) and sporangioles. Vesicles were observed only in B. virginianum. Following the initial infecting, no hyphal connections to the epidermis were present. The infecting hyphae were irregular varying in diameter from 4 to 12 microns in B. dissectum and from 2. 5 microns in B. virginianum. Swellings often occurred in hyphae where they passed through cell walls of the roots. In B. virginianum these swellings were often dark colored. Septations were seen in hyphae {{on the outside of the}} roots of B. virginianum. None were observed in the hyphae within the roots. Because of the size differences and habit of growth of fungi within the two ferns, it is proposed that different fungi infect them. Thin sections of roots were surface sterilized and placed upon Czapek's and malt extract media. Fungal isolates from these were compared to fungi seen within the roots. Since no reproductive structures were observed in the hyphae within the roots and all comparisons had to be made with somatic hyphae, identification of the fungi was not possible. Several methods of spore germination were tried. Since these were not successful and since no gametophytes were found, no studies of the reported endophytic fungi could be made. Rebecca A.

40|$|Technosols (USS Working Group WRB 2006) are soils, whose {{properties}} and pedogenesis {{are dominated by}} artificial or transported materials. In the case of industrial brownfield management, constructed Technosols can be used intentionally to reclaim ecosystem. These Technosols are made of anthropogenic materials that are legally considered as wastes or by-products. Sponsored by the French National Soil Programme GESSOL, and within the GISFI (Groupement d’Intérêt Scientifique sur les Friches Industrielles, www. gisfi. fr), a consortium of soil biologists has been constituted to study a model constructed Technosol ecosystem at the field scale on a derelict brownfield in the Lorraine Region (France). The studied Technosol, implemented in 2007, is made of a layer of green-waste compost at the surface, a layer of a mixture of treated industrial soil and paper-mill sludge, and a bottom layer of pure paper-mill sludge. The pedogenesis of this Technosol has been studied for several years demonstrating its capacity to perform basic soil functions (Séré, Schwartz et al. 2008). The working group comprised soil ecologist specialists of various biota (bacteria and <b>mycorhiza,</b> nematodes, microarthropods, macroarthropods and earthworms), agronomists, and soil bio-physicians. Sampling has occurred each year at spring time since 2008. The main question of the project focuses on {{the capacity of the}} Technosols to fulfill essential functions of a natural soil, particularly vegetation development, which means restoration of physical and chemical fertility. Our hypothesis is that soil organisms, by their diversity and functional complementarities, are essential actors in the system for the main physical (aggregation, bioturbation) and chemical (carbon and nitrogen cycles) processes. In this context, our objective is to assess the colonisation dynamic of the Technosol by soil biota and their impact on several soil functions. The results obtained within the 4 first years (2008 to 2011) of the project indicate that the initial system is typical of pioneer ecosystems, with the presence of bacterivorous nematodes and the absence of macrofauna. Initial Collembola communities are mainly influenced by the initial materials (origins of the composts) and the borders of the field, showing a centripetal colonisation during the first 2 years. However, an increase of species richness, particularly concerning nematodes, is observed between 2008 and 2009. Furthermore, in 2011, an explosion of earthworm densities is observed, showing a fast colonisation of soil engineers. Finally this soil biota development can be strongly linked with the evolution of the soil structure and leads to a biomass production similar to a “natural” pasture, which conducts to the occurrence of a brumifer horizon...|$|E
