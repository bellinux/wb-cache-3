50|$|The new {{building}} was a masterpiece. Built out of red brick and sandstone in a castle-like structure, in typical 1890s architectural fashion, it featured multiple turrets, twelve-foot ceilings, stained-glass bay {{windows and a}} six-story bell tower. After {{the last part of}} the building, the bell tower, was erected, it was decided by the School Board not to purchase a bell for it. The reasons for this are unclear, but it is thought that the large bell used to mark the beginning and ending of classes was ditched in favor of an electric bell system run by a <b>motor.</b> The <b>bell</b> tower would remain until the rest of the building around it was destroyed.|$|R

Bristol Tramways produced the forward fuselage of the aircraft, the Standard Motor Company manufactured the central fuselage and inner wing sections, the Pressed Steel Company produced the rear fuselage, and Parnall Aircraft made the tail unit. Other main subcontractors included Boulton Paul Aircraft, Excelsior <b>Motor</b> Radiator Company, <b>Bell</b> Punch, Turner Manufacturing Company, and Charlesworth Bodies; {{as many of these}} firms had little or no experience producing aircraft, both quality and interchangeability of components were maintained by contractually enforced adherence to Gloster's original drawings.|$|R

40|$|Preparation for the Apollo Soyuz mission entailed {{large-scale}} informational {{exchange that}} {{was accomplished by}} a computerized translation system. Based on this technology of commercial machine translation, a system known as SYSTRAN II was developed by LATSEC, Inc. and the World Translation Company of Canada. This system increases the output of a human translator by five to eight times, affording cost savings by allowing a large increase in document production without hiring additional people. Extra savings accrue from automatic production of camera-ready copy. Applications include translation of service manuals, proposals and tenders, planning studies, catalogs, list of parts and prices, textbooks, technical reports and education/training materials. System is operational for six language pairs. Systran users include Xerox Corporation, General <b>Motors</b> of Canada, <b>Bell</b> Northern Research of Canada, the U. S.

To determine the functional recovery in patients with severe transient peripheral facial <b>motor</b> paralysis (<b>Bell</b> palsy). Study Design. Prospective controlled trial. Setting. Academic medical center. Subjects and Methods. Blink recovery was studied in 2 groups of severely affected Bell palsy patients during a follow-up period of 84 weeks. The patients in one group received pre-dnisolone within the first week after the onset of symptoms. No medication was given to the other group. A control group of healthy subjects was also included. Simultaneous orbicularis oculi muscle activity and eyelid kinematics were recorded by surface electromyographic (EMG) recording and eyelid search coils, respectively. Results. At the beginning of the paralysis, very little integrated orbicularis oculi muscle activity and eyelid movement was mea-sured at the palsied side of the face. Thirteen weeks later, the integrated orbicularis oculi EMG and functional blink recovery gradually improved until 39 weeks. Beyond, only the integrated orbicularis oculi EMG slightly increased. At 84 weeks, the inte-grated orbicularis oculi EMG was significantly larger in the pre-dnisolone group compared with the control group. The integrated EMG of the nonmedicated group recovered to normal values. Curiously enough, the functional blink recovery at the palsied side remained reduced to 64 % compared with the healthy controls in the prednisolone-treated group and to 36 % in the nonmedicated group. Conclusion. The authors demonstrate that prednisolone signifi-cantly increased the orbicularis oculi muscle activity and signifi-cantly improved functional blink recovery in severely affected Bell palsy patients. However, the increase of muscle activity was insufficient to restore functional blinking to normal values...|$|R
40|$|Between 1945 and 1961 Eero Saarinen molded {{the image}} of the modern American {{corporation}} in the postwar suburbs, in five office and research complexes built for General <b>Motors,</b> IBM, <b>Bell</b> Laboratories and Deere 2 ̆ 6 Company. These projects represent an architectural shift away from the hegemony of the International Style, in favor of client- and site-specific forms, designed and promoted as part of elaborate corporate image campaigns. Examined within the context of postwar decentralization, these projects reveal the role of large bureaucratic corporations in manipulating the form of the contemporary American landscape. Beginning in the late 1930 s and continuing through the 1950 s, American corporations, such as General Motors, promoted the suburbs to the consumer public as a landscape of progress—as the next frontier of American civilization. Through popular exhibitions, such as the Futurama pavilion at the 1939 World 2 ̆ 7 s Fair, GM created in the minds of Americans a technological image of the suburban landscape, built with the fruits of scientific research and wholly dependent on the automobile. Then, GM and other interested corporations promoted the construction of a national system of highways throughout the 1940 s, and began building in the suburbs as soon as World War II ended. In the projects examined here, Eero Saarinen translated the future-oriented pre-war rhetoric of the suburbs into architectural form through the use of new, mass-produced and flexible materials. From porcelain enameled curtain wall panels, neoprene window gaskets, reflective glazing and the first architectural use of Cor-Ten steel, the technological innovations of these projects contributed to an advanced building industry. Culturally, the innovative materials and forms served as progressive icons of the nascent American suburbs. By the 1960 s, however, corporate profiteers seized {{the image of}} the flexible office building and reduced the role of the creative architect. They developed a transitory commercial landscape and spurred a rising chorus of critics opposed to the tactics of big business and the effects of the suburbs. ...|$|R
