5000|$|As a result, Peekay takes a {{year off}} of boxing and {{academics}} and goes to work in Northern Rhodesia's copper mines to [...] "find himself" [...] and build up the muscle to become a welterweight. He takes on the dangerous work of a [...] "grizzly man" [...] as required by all new miners, but continues on to earn double wages, thereby saving enough to attend Oxford. At the mines, he meets a Georgian called Rasputin and they become close friends. When Peekay has an accident in his shaft, Rasputin saves Peekay, but gives his own life up instead. Rasputin names Peekay as his beneficiary; that and his own insurance payout gives him {{enough to be able}} to attend Oxford. One night before Peekay leaves the mining camp, Peekay meets his old nemesis, the Judge, in a bar at the mines. The Judge is in an insane rage due to handling <b>mine</b> <b>explosives</b> and tries to kill Peekay. A fight ensues and Peekay puts all he has learned in his life to destroy the Judge. After defeating the Judge, Peekay carves a Union Jack and the initials [...] "PK" [...] over the Swastika in the Judge's arm. He then walks into the night, ending the book without him realizing his dream of becoming welterweight champion of the world.|$|E

40|$|The {{increasing}} mining depth {{leads to}} higher stress magnitudes, resulting in increased seismic activity and more seismically-induced damage. The {{effectiveness of the}} ground support system under dynamic loading conditions has therefore become of prime interest to the mining companies {{in order to provide}} safe mining conditions with a minimum of production disturbances caused by unstable infrastructure. The problems of mining-induced seismicity have necessitated the use of ground support systems which are capable of withstanding strong dynamic loads. Although there are large amounts of measurement data from the site-installed seismic systems, they cannot be used directly to design and select the appropriate support systems due to lack of control over the location and nature of the seismic source and the effect of the rock mass on the seismic waves. Large-scale tests using explosives as the seismic source have therefore become a useful method to evaluate the performance of rock support systems for seismic conditions. A series of seven large scale dynamic tests of rock support was conducted in the Kiirunavaara <b>mine.</b> <b>Explosives</b> were detonated in boreholes in the pillar between two cross-cuts in order to generate a dynamic load on the rock support system installed on the cross-cut wall. This was done with the aim to develop a testing methodology for in-situ testing of ground support. Furthermore, the response of the installed support system to strong dynamic loading was also evaluated. The tests included ground motion measurements, fracture investigation, ground and support motion imaging, as well as the deformation measurements. The results of the measurements in Tests 1 to 7 are presented and the methodology used to design the tests is discussed. The results indicated that the relation between the burden distance and the used amount of explosive material and number of blastholes has a vital role in either reducing or involving the effect of detonation gases in test results. The large amount of data recorded during these tests will be useful for the calibration of more advanced numerical models. The energy absorption by the Swellex Mn 24, 100 mm fibre reinforced shotcrete (40 kg/m 3 steel fibre) and 75 mm x 75 mm weld mesh with 5. 5 mm diameter was estimated and compared to that obtained from the large scale in-situ tests and laboratory tests conducted in different countries. The comprehensive ground motion data provided for the whole test wall was used to estimate the kinetic energy transmitted to the fractured zone where the support system was installed.
