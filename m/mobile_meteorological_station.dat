5000|$|Beadell {{returned}} to Mount Davies on 23 July {{and led the}} GRCP with bulldozer and grader back towards Emu Field, to begin construction of the new road. [...] The supply truck and fitter's truck experienced mechanical problems early on, {{so they had to}} be towed by the grader until Beadell was able to drive to Giles to pick up vital spares, after they had been delivered by aircraft. In the vicinity of Mt. Lindsay, the bulldozer became bogged in soft ground, and almost simultaneously the grader was bogged some distance away. It took two days of hard work to extricate both machines. A site for a <b>mobile</b> <b>meteorological</b> <b>station</b> was surveyed at Mount Lindsay on 10 August, and another near Coffin Hill on 26 August. On 7 September, work was halted while British scientists visited Giles, and was not restarted until the following year on 27 June 1957. A point on a previously made road 48 kilometres west of Emu Field was reached on 29 July, with the corner subsequently named Anne's Corner, after Beadell's future wife. The following year, work continued on the Gunbarrel Highway.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} one of the {{earliest}} steps in System of Systems (SoS) design aiming to meaningfully determine stakeholders’ values or preferences. It recommends the plural problem definition and dynamic construction of stakeholder’s values in the front end of design process. It suggests a method based on the probability theory to embed flexibility and tolerance, and construct a basic framework for collecting, processing and combining uncertain information. This study uses a graphical tool to facilitate communication and probabilistically utilize the stakeholders’ values. It introduces the “degree of consensus” as a metric to rank the identified values. This metric represents the consent of stakeholders on SoS values used for example in its architecture, design decisions, or alternative evaluation. The paper explains the mathematical formulation and presents an application example for design of a <b>mobile</b> <b>meteorological</b> <b>station</b> {{as a part of a}} world program for dealing with the global warming...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the design and {{construction}} of the <b>meteorological</b> <b>station.</b> The <b>meteorological</b> <b>station</b> is designed and constructed {{to be able to}} measure the basic meteorological parameters (temperature, humidity, air pressure) and the other three variables (measuring rainfall, wind speed, wind direction). This thesis will introduce you to meteorology. Meteorology determines the daily weather forecast and the results are used for examples in aviation or maritime affairs. The method of atmospheric origin is given in the theoretical part. Meteorology must use measuring instruments to determine quantities. The dissertation also includes analysis of the measuring instruments. The <b>meteorological</b> <b>station</b> uses the Ethernet technology. In the chapter devoted to Ethernet are described its principles, types and method of power supply over Ethernet. The following section describes the design of the entire <b>meteorological</b> <b>station,</b> selection of all components and description of their connection. The chapter about implementation contains a description of the parts which forms program part of the <b>meteorological</b> <b>station.</b> The aim of the thesis is a summary of the achieved results including price comparison of the renovated <b>meteorological</b> <b>station</b> with other <b>meteorological</b> <b>stations,</b> which can be normally bought...|$|R

The urban heat island of the city has also been found to be partially responsible for alterations of the climatological temperature time-series of specific Athens <b>meteorological</b> <b>stations,</b> because of its impact on the temperatures and the temperature trends recorded by some <b>meteorological</b> <b>stations.</b> On the other hand, specific <b>meteorological</b> <b>stations,</b> such as the National Garden <b>station</b> and Thiseio <b>meteorological</b> <b>station,</b> are less affected or do not experience the urban heat island.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Automatic <b>meteorological</b> <b>station</b> is {{important}} for meteorological observation {{and the existence of}} outliers in the observational data is inevitable. The paper proposes outlier detection for observational data of automatic <b>meteorological</b> <b>station</b> based on least square support vector machine (LS-SVM). The method establishes the LS-SVM model for the meteorological factor and uses the model to evaluate the observational data. If the observational data deviate from the model, they would be seemed as outliers. The ground temperature data observed by two real automatic <b>meteorological</b> <b>stations</b> are used in experiments. Experiments results verify that the proposed method realize outlier detection for observational data of automatic <b>meteorological</b> <b>station</b> effectively and ensures subsequent process and analysis of the meteorological data...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, five {{national}} <b>meteorological</b> <b>stations</b> in Anhui province {{are taken}} as typical examples {{to explore the}} effects of local urbanization on their thermal environment by using Landsat data from 1990 to 2010. Satellite-based land use/land cover (LULC), land surface temperature (LST), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) are used to investigate the effects. The study shows that LULC around <b>meteorological</b> <b>stations</b> changed significantly due to urban expansion. Fast urbanization is the main factor that affects the spatial-temporal distribution of thermal environment around <b>meteorological</b> <b>stations.</b> Moreover, the normalized LST and NDVI exhibit strong inverse correlations around <b>meteorological</b> <b>stations,</b> so the variability of LST can be monitored through evaluating the variability of NDVI. In addition, station-relocation {{plays an important role}} in improving representativeness of thermal environment. Notably, the environment representativeness was improved, but when using the data from the station to study climate change, the relocation-induced inhomogeneous data should be considered and adjusted. Consequently, controlling the scale and layout of the urban buildings and constructions around <b>meteorological</b> <b>stations</b> is an effective method to ameliorate observational thermal environment and to improve regional representativeness of station observation. The present work provides observational evidences that high resolution Landsat images can be used to evaluate the thermal environment of <b>meteorological</b> <b>stations...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract - The {{meteorological}} network in Croatia {{has been operating}} continuously {{since the middle of}} the 19 century. Wars, as signicifant historical events have a tendency to interrupt such continuity. This paper presents a diagram of the <b>meteorological</b> <b>stations</b> network development, since 1850 showing the decrease in the total number of <b>meteorological</b> <b>stations</b> during and after World War I, World War II and in the period of aggression on Croatia from 1991 to 1993. The impact of war in the period from 1991 to 1993 is presented in greater detail by a second diagram, showing an evident correlation between actual war activities and the lack of meteorological observations, damage to meteorological equipment and buildings. The horizontal and vertical distribution of <b>meteorological</b> <b>stations</b> within the <b>meteorological</b> network is shown for the year when the distribution was in accordance with criteria recomended by The World Meteorological Organization. If we compare the total number of <b>meteorological</b> <b>stations</b> on 31 December 1993 with the recommended optimum number of <b>meteorological</b> <b>stations,</b> (in accordance with WMO regulations) we can see that only 54. 7 % stations were active. Compared to the total number of <b>meteorological</b> <b>stations</b> before the aggression (31 December l 99 O) 3 O. 4 % stations were destroyed or incapacitated from 1991 to the end of 1993 by war activities. The direct damage (destroyed buildings and instruments of the basic {{meteorological network}}) amounts to more than US$ two million. Evidence has been collected from the participants to these events and original reports supplied by the Heads of <b>meteorological</b> <b>stations</b> are quoted. Photographs, diagrams, tables and data from our station catalogues have been used to prepare this article. The period analysed ends on 31 December 1993...|$|R
