50|$|Juices (grape, cherry, raspberry, etc.), syrups, water, {{milk and}} fruit-drinks {{are often used}} as {{the base of the}} cocktail. Oily and {{sparkling}} liquids result in poor homogeneity of the foam. The base liquid might contain extracts of plants and herbs such as hawthorn, strawflower, <b>motherwort</b> and rose hip, which themselves are used in the clinical practices. An essential element of the oxygen cocktail is the foaming agent, such as gelatin egg white or liquorice. Initially, oxygen cocktails were made with egg white. However clinical trials proved that this ingredient resulted in allergenicity and unpleasant taste and could promote infectious diseases; thus it was replaced by liquorice, which is a foaming agent, tonic and sedative.|$|E

40|$|Objective　To {{evaluate}} the clinical efficacy {{and safety of}} <b>motherwort</b> injection and oxytocin in preventing postpartum hemorrhage after vaginal delivery. Methods　Data of randomly controlled trials (RCTs) of <b>motherwort</b> injection and oxytocin in preventing postpartum hemorrhage after vaginal delivery were collected by searching PubMed (1980 - 2013. 9), Wiley Online Library (1990 - 2013. 9), Embase (1990 - 2013. 9), CNKI (1990 - 2013. 9), VIP database (1990 - 2013. 9) and WanFang Data (1990 - 2013. 9). The amount and incidence of postpartum hemorrhage and quantity of blood loss, {{as well as the}} incidence of postpartum morbidity were then collected in those puerperal women treated with <b>motherwort</b> injection and oxytocin. The quality of included studies was assessed according to Cochrane Systematic Review, and Meta-analysis was conducted by RevMan 5. 1 software. Results　A total of 13 studies involving 2186 patients were included. Compared with oxytocin group, <b>motherwort</b> and oxytocin decreased the amount of vaginal bleeding within 2 hours after delivery and 24 hours after delivery. Furthermore, <b>motherwort</b> and oxytocin significantly decreased the incidence of postpartum hemorrhage (RR= 0. 30, 95 %CI 0. 19 - 0. 47, P< 0. 00001). No difference was found between the two groups in the postpartum adverse reaction rate (RR= 0. 63, 95 %CI 0. 37 - 1. 05, P= 0. 08). Conclusions　<b>Motherwort</b> injection and oxytocin are effective in preventing postpartum hemorrhage after vaginal delivery, and they can effectively reduce incidence of postpartum hemorrhage and the amount of blood loss without increasing the side effects in patients.

40|$|Carrot torradovirus 1 (CaTV 1) is a {{new member}} of the genus Torradovirus within the family Secoviridae. CaTV 1 genome {{sequences}} were obtained from a previous next-generation sequencing (NGS) study and were compared to other members and tentative new members of the genus. The virus has a bipartite genome, and RACE was used to amplify and sequence each end of RNA 1 and RNA 2. As a result, RNA 1 and RNA 2 are estimated to contain 6944 and 4995 nucleotides, respectively, with RNA 1 encoding the proteins involved in virus replication, and RNA 2 encoding the encapsidation and movement proteins. Sequence comparisons showed that CaTV 1 clustered within the non-tomato-infecting torradoviruses and is most similar to <b>motherwort</b> yellow mottle virus (MYMoV). The nucleotide sequence identities of the Pro-Pol and coat protein regions were below the criteria established by the ICTV for demarcating species, confirming that CaTV 1 should be classified {{as a member of}} a new species within the genus Torradovirus...|$|E
40|$|There {{is growing}} use of anticancer {{complementary}} and alternative medicines (CAMs) worldwide. The {{purpose of the}} current study is to assess a sizeable variety of natural and plant sources of diverse origin, to ascertain prospective research directives for cancer treatment and potential new chemotherapy drug sources. In this study, 374 natural extracts (10 μg/mL- 5 mg/mL) were evaluated for dose-dependent tumoricidal effects using immortal neuroblastoma of spontaneous malignant origin. The findings indicate no pattern of tumoricidal effects by diverse plants with similar families/ genus under the classes Pinopsida, Equisetopsida, Lycopodiosida, Filicosida, Liliopsida Monocotyledons or Magnoliopsida Dicotyledons. The results indicate that many of the most commonly used CAMs exhibited relatively weak tumoricidal effects including cats claw, astragalus, ginseng, echinacea, mistletoe, milk thistle, slippery elm, cayenne, chamomile, don quai, meadowsweet, <b>motherwort</b> and shepherd's purse. The data demonstrate that the most potent plant extracts were randomly dispersed within the plantae kingdom (LC 50 = 31 - 490 μg/mL) in order of the lowest LC 50 Dioscorea villosa (Dioscoreaceae) > Sanguinaria canadensis (Papaveraceae) > Dipsacus asper (Dipsacaceae) > Populus balsamifera (Salicaceae) > Boswellia carteri (Burseraceae...|$|E
40|$|A new Torradovirus {{tentatively}} named Carrot torrado virus (CaTV) was an incidental finding {{following a}} {{next generation sequencing}} study investigating internal vascular necrosis in carrot. The closest related viruses are Lettuce necrotic leaf curl virus (LNLCV) found in the Netherlands in 2011 and <b>Motherwort</b> yellow mottle virus (MYMoV) found in Korea in 2014. Primers for reverse transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR) and RT-qPCR were designed {{with the aim of}} testing for the presence of virus in plant samples collected from the field. Both methods successfully amplified the target from infected samples but not from healthy control samples. The specificity of the CaTV assay was also checked against other known carrot viruses and no cross-reaction was seen. A comparative study between methods showed RT-qPCR was the most reliable method, giving positive results in samples where RT-PCR fails. Evaluation of the Ct values following RT-qPCR and a direct comparison demonstrated this was due to improved sensitivity. The previous published Torradovirus genus specific RT-PCR primers were tested and shown to detect CaTV. Also, virus transmission experiments carried out suggest that unlike other species of the same genus, Carrot torrado virus could be aphid-transmitted...|$|E

40|$|Medicinal {{plants are}} {{valuable}} resources of natural antimicrobial materials. A novel small protein with antimicrobial activities, designated LJAMP 1, was purified from {{the seeds of}} a medicinal herb, <b>motherwort</b> (Leonurus japonicus Houtt). LJAMP 1 is a heat-stable protein with a molecular mass of 7. 8 kDa and a determined isoelectric point of 8. 2. In vitro assays showed that LJAMP 1 inhibits the growth of an array of fungi and bacteria. The hyphal growth inhibition by LJAMP 1 was more evident against hyphomycete fungi, such as Alternaria alternata, Cercospora personata, and Aspergillus niger. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of LJAMP 1 was determined, and its coding gene was consequently cloned by the rapid amplification of cDNA ends. The gene LJAMP 1 has no intron and encodes a polypeptide of 95 amino acids, in which the first 27 residues was deduced as a signal peptide. The mature LJAMP 1 shows relatively low identity to plant napin-like storage proteins. Northern blot assays revealed that LJAMP 1 is expressed preferentially in seeds. Bioassays in transgenic tobacco demonstrated that that overexpression of LJAMP 1 significantly enhanced the resistance of tobacco against not only the fungal pathogen A. alternata but also the bacterial pathogen Ralstonia solanacearum, while no visible alteration in plant growth and development was observed...|$|E
