5|$|Solar 2 {{is an open}} world sandbox {{video game}} played from a {{two-dimensional}} perspective. The player is given an asteroid, and their main mission is to accumulate enough <b>mass</b> <b>to</b> become several astronomical objects. The game ends when and if the player manages to accumulate enough <b>mass</b> <b>to</b> become a big crunch, which then produces a Big Bang. However, the player is free to not finish the game, {{and is able to}} stay at the form of the object of their preference. Six different object are available in the game: small planet, life planet, small star, medium star, large star and black hole.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of the letter, the {{estimated}} material necessary for a fission chain reaction was several tons.

5|$|Clusters {{of galaxies}} consist of {{hundreds}} {{to thousands of}} galaxies bound together by gravity.

5|$|However, one {{can combine}} the nominal solar mass {{parameter}} {{with the most}} recent (2014) CODATA estimate of the Newtonian gravitational constant G to derive the solar <b>mass</b> <b>to</b> be approximately 1.9885 × 1030 kg. Although the exact values for the luminosity, radius, mass parameter, and mass may vary slightly in the future due to observational uncertainties, the 2015 IAU nominal constants will remain the same SI values as they remain useful measures for quoting stellar parameters.|$|E
5|$|In close {{binary star}} systems {{one of the}} stars can lose <b>mass</b> <b>to</b> a heavier companion. Accretion-powered pulsars may drive mass loss. The {{shrinking}} star can then become a planetary-mass object. An example is a Jupiter-mass object orbiting the pulsar PSR J1719-1438. These shrunken white dwarfs may become a helium planet or carbon planet.|$|E
5|$|Lunar Orbit Rendezvous (LOR): A single Saturn V could {{launch a}} {{spacecraft}} that {{was composed of}} a mother ship which would remain in orbit around the Moon, while a smaller, two-stage lander would carry two astronauts to the surface, return to dock with the mother ship, and then be discarded. Landing {{only a small part}} of the spacecraft on the Moon and returning an even smaller part to lunar orbit minimized the total <b>mass</b> <b>to</b> be launched from the Earth.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the most}} basic {{requirements}} for the existence of life around a star is the ability of that star to produce a terrestrial planet of sufficient <b>mass</b> <b>to</b> sustain it. Various elements, such as iron, magnesium, titanium, carbon, oxygen, silicon, and others, are required to produce habitable planets, and the concentration and ratios of these vary throughout the galaxy.|$|E
5|$|The Sun {{does not}} have enough <b>mass</b> <b>to</b> explode as a supernova. Instead it will exit the main {{sequence}} in approximately 5 billion years and start to turn into a red giant. As a red giant, the Sun will grow so large that it will engulf Mercury, Venus, and probably Earth.|$|E

5|$|The first {{confirmed}} {{discovery of}} an extrasolar planet orbiting an ordinary main-sequence star occurred on 6 October 1995, when Michel Mayor and Didier Queloz of the University of Geneva announced {{the detection of}} an exoplanet around 51 Pegasi. From then until the Kepler mission most known extrasolar planets were gas giants comparable in <b>mass</b> <b>to</b> Jupiter or larger as they were more easily detected. The catalog of Kepler candidate planets consists mostly of planets the size of Neptune and smaller, down to smaller than Mercury.|$|E
5|$|The ratio between planet MOA-2009-BLG-387Lb's <b>mass</b> <b>to</b> that of {{its host}} star has been found with accuracy. However, because the host star's {{characteristics}} are not as well-constrained, the planet's characteristics are not well-constrained either. The inability to constrain many of MOA-2009-BLG-387L's characteristics {{is a consequence of}} the fact that the star acted as the lens in the microlensing event, which compromised the ability to collect most of the star's stellar parameters.|$|E
5|$|WASP-13 {{is a star}} in the Lynx constellation. The star is similar, {{in terms}} of {{metallicity}} and <b>mass,</b> <b>to</b> the Sun, although it is hotter and most likely older. The star was first observed in 1997, according to the SIMBAD database, and was targeted by SuperWASP after the star was observed by one of the SuperWASP telescopes beginning in 2006. Follow-up observations on the star led to the discovery of planet WASP-13b in 2008; the discovery paper was published in 2009.|$|E

5|$|A {{limitation}} of the radial velocity method used to detect Gliese 876 c is that only a lower limit on the planet's mass can be obtained. This is because the measured mass value depends on the inclination of the orbit, which is not determined by the radial velocity measurements. However, in a resonant system such as Gliese 876, gravitational interactions between the planets {{can be used to}} determine the true masses. Using this method, the inclination of the orbit can be determined, revealing the planet's true <b>mass</b> <b>to</b> be 0.72 times that of Jupiter.|$|E
5|$|All main-sequence {{stars have}} a core region where energy is {{generated}} by nuclear fusion. The temperature and density of this core are at the levels necessary to sustain the energy production that will support {{the remainder of the}} star. A reduction of energy production would cause the overlaying <b>mass</b> <b>to</b> compress the core, resulting in an increase in the fusion rate because of higher temperature and pressure. Likewise an increase in energy production would cause the star to expand, lowering the pressure at the core. Thus the star forms a self-regulating system in hydrostatic equilibrium that is stable over the course of its main sequence lifetime.|$|E

5|$|Consisting of two quasars with a {{separation}} of less than 5 arcseconds, the quasar pair 4C 11.50 {{is one of the}} visually closest pairs of quasars in the sky. The two have markedly different redshifts, however, and are thus unrelated. The foreground member of the pair (4C 11.50 A) does not have enough <b>mass</b> <b>to</b> refract light from the background component (4C 11.50 B) enough to produce a lensed image, although it does have a true companion of its own. An even stranger galaxy pair is 3C 321. Unlike the previous pair, the two galaxies making up 3C 321 are interacting with each other and {{are in the process of}} merging. Both members appear to be active galaxies; the primary radio galaxy may be responsible for the activity in the secondary by means of the former's jet driving material onto the latter's supermassive black hole.|$|E
5|$|During his spell in Sauber, in the 1991 Sportscar World Championship, Schumacher was {{involved}} in a serious incident with Derek Warwick in that year's 430 km of Nürburgring. While trying to set his flying lap in qualifying, Schumacher encountered Warwick's Jaguar on a slow lap resulting in lost time for Schumacher. As retaliation for being in his way, Schumacher swerved the Sauber into Warwick's car, hitting the Jaguar's nose and front wheel. Enraged by the German's attitude, Warwick drove to the pits and chased a fleeing Schumacher on foot through the Sauber pits. He eventually caught up with Schumacher, and it took intervention from Jochen <b>Mass</b> <b>to</b> prevent Warwick physically assaulting Schumacher.|$|E
5|$|Eighth United States Army {{commander}} Lieutenant General Walton Walker {{ordered the}} 1st Cavalry Division to attack north on September 1 {{in an effort}} to divert some of the North Korean strength from the US 2nd and 25th Infantry Divisions in the south. Gay's initial decision upon receipt of this order was to attack north up the Sangju road, but his staff and regimental commanders all joined in urging that the attack instead be against Hill 518 in the US 7th Cavalry zone. Only two days before, Hill 518 had been in the ROK 1st Division zone and had been considered a North Korean assembly point. The US 1st Cavalry Division, accordingly, prepared for an attack in the 7th Cavalry sector and for diversionary attacks by two companies of the 3rd Battalion, 8th Cavalry, on the 7th Cavalry's right flank. This left the 8th Cavalry only one infantry company in reserve. The regiment's 1st Battalion was on the hill <b>mass</b> <b>to</b> the west of the Bowling Alley and north of Tabu-dong; its 2nd Battalion was astride the road.|$|E
