In the next match against New South Wales, Harvey played with Neil {{for the first}} time at {{first-class}} level, and pair played together for their state’s two remaining matches of the season, although they never batted together as Merv was always out before Neil came in, usually at No. 6. Merv made 30 and 44, failing to capitalise on his starts to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> score with a Test vacancy beckoning; incumbent opener Sid Barnes was injured and unavailable for the Fourth Test.|$|E

He made just three as England lost the next match by five wickets. In the final match of the series he made 18 to help England win the match, although they lost the series 2–1.|$|E
25|$|Steyn went to England in 2005 to {{play for}} Essex, {{appearing}} in seven matches between May and June. He failed to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> impact in his initial outing in County Championship cricket, taking 14 wickets at 59.85. Following his work at Essex with world expert bowling coach Ian Pont Steyn returned to domestic cricket in South Africa, where he bowled excellently for the Titans through the 2005/2006 season which earned him a recall to the Test squad to face New Zealand.|$|E
25|$|Australia's first innings came at {{the very}} high rate {{for the period of}} 66 runs per hundred balls. No-one went on to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> score, however, and when they were 251-8 it seemed that they might be {{dismissed}} for a fairly modest total. However the number 10, Martin, helped Mackay to add 97 for the ninth wicket before both were dismissed in quick succession. Martin's 55, in his first Test, took only 67 balls. There was enough time before the close for Davidson to dismiss Solomon for a duck, West Indies closing on 1/1.|$|E

25|$|England {{came out}} to bat late on day 2, and lost the wicket of Andrew Strauss before the close. They {{continued}} to lose wickets regularly through day 3, with the shot selection {{of some of the}} middle order batsmen being called into question. Zaheer Khan, India’s bowler of the series picked up three wickets and Kumble also took three. For England, Alastair Cook, Ian Bell and Paul Collingwood all scored in the 60s, but no one went on to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> score – leaving England on 345 all out early on day 4 and facing the prospect of following on.|$|E
25|$|Both {{defenses}} {{controlled the}} game early on, and with just over four minutes {{left in the}} first quarter, the Steelers had to punt the ball from their own 13-yard line. Josh Miller appeared to bail his team out with a 64-yard punt, but Steelers receiver Troy Edwards was penalized for going out of bounds before tackling Troy Brown on the return. This turned out to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> difference, as the punt was redone and on the second attempt, Brown returned it 55 yards for a touchdown. Pittsburgh responded by driving 65 yards in 10 plays, one of them a 34-yard run by quarterback Kordell Stewart, and scoring with a 30-yard field goal from Kris Brown, cutting the score to 7–3.|$|E
25|$|Deol's {{next film}} titled, Help, {{was shot in}} Mauritius, in which he {{appeared}} opposite Mugdha Godse. The film was released on 13 August 2010.

His character is a businessman who is not sincere with his wife. In 2012, he appeared in heist film Players. The film {{proved to be a}} failure at the box office. He played the role of Ronnie, who has no experience in conning people, but is a master of illusions. He {{was one of the most}} popular illusionists who abandoned magic after a tragic incident. Deol's latest film is Yamla Pagla Deewana 2, the sequel to his 2011 hit. YPD 2 didn't <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> impression at the box office, and flopped.|$|E

25|$|In the {{dedication}} page for Uglies, Westerfeld says: “This novel {{was shaped by}} a series of e-mail exchanges between myself and Ted Chiang about his story “Liking What You See: A Documentary.” His input on the manuscript was also invaluable.” In another interview, Westerfeld says that this documentary is about a new technology that enables an individual to turn off their ability to see beauty so they can focus on the deeper and more important parts of another individual. In a 2012 interview on Bookyurt, Westerfeld explained that his point in writing the book was not to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> commentary on the issues with beauty, but to make people aware of the culture of retouching that is developing in the world and to be aware of our own ideas about beauty and our need to think for ourselves.|$|E
25|$|After {{the first}} game against India was rained off, Morgan made 28 in the second match as England lost to go 1–0 down in the series. He made 10 in the next match as India secured another win, this time by six wickets. He made 32 in the next match as England {{suffered}} a humiliating nine wicket defeat. The manner of the lead to questions over the personnel in the team, and the pressure increased on captain Alistair Cook. Despite this, England won the final match of the series, although Morgan again failed to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> score, being dismissed for 14. In the only T20 match between the two sides, Morgan hit 71 from just 31 balls in an innings that included seven sixes. England won the match by three runs and Morgan was named man of the match.|$|E
25|$|Fillings in {{pastries}} {{are sometimes}} made of finely ground poppy seeds mixed with butter or milk and sugar. The ground filling {{is used in}} poppy seed rolls and some croissants and may be flavored with lemon or orange zest, rum and vanilla with raisins, heavy cream, cinnamon, and chopped blanched almonds or walnuts added. For sweet baked goods, sometimes instead of sugar a tablespoon of jam, or other sweet binding agent, like syrup is substituted. The poppy seed for fillings are best when they are finely and freshly ground because this will <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> difference in the pastry filling's texture and taste. Some recipes for Mohnstriezel use poppy seed soaked in water for two hours or boiled in milk. A recipe for Ukrainian poppyseed cake recommends preparing the seeds by immersing in boiling water, straining and soaking in milk overnight.|$|E

The Head of Senior School learns that the reason for this fundraiser is actually to fund the expensive formal.
