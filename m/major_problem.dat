5|$|Like rhenium and palladium, {{technetium}} {{can serve}} as a catalyst. In processes such as the dehydrogenation of isopropyl alcohol, it is a far more effective catalyst than either rhenium or palladium. However, its radioactivity is a <b>major</b> <b>problem</b> in safe catalytic applications.|$|E
5|$|A <b>major</b> <b>problem</b> {{in sending}} space probes to Jupiter {{is that the}} planet has no solid surface on which to land, {{as there is a}} smooth {{transition}} between the planet's atmosphere and its fluid interior. Any probes descending into the atmosphere are eventually crushed by the immense pressures within Jupiter.|$|E
5|$|An {{important}} {{function of the}} dam is to control flooding, which is a <b>major</b> <b>problem</b> for the seasonal river of the Yangtze. Millions of people live downstream of the dam, with many large, important cities like Wuhan, Nanjing, and Shanghai situated adjacent to the river. Plenty of farm land and China's most important industrial area are built beside the river.|$|E

5|$|As {{with many}} urban rivers, the Frome has {{suffered}} from pollution, but several stretches run through parks and reserves that sustain a range of wildlife. The power of the water was harnessed in many watermills and {{the area around the}} river mouth was developed as shipyards by the eighteenth century. As the city of Bristol developed in the nineteenth and twentieth century, flooding became a <b>major</b> <b>problem,</b> remedied by the construction of storm drains and diversions.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} 2000s, {{orangutan}} habitat has decreased rapidly due to logging and forest fires, {{as well as}} fragmentation by roads. A major factor in {{that period of time}} has been the conversion of vast areas of tropical forest to palm oil plantations in response to international demand. Palm oil is used for cooking, cosmetics, mechanics, and biodiesel. Hunting is also a <b>major</b> <b>problem</b> as is the illegal pet trade.|$|E
5|$|Low-pressure {{deposition}} of thin films of cubic boron nitride is possible. As in diamond growth, the <b>major</b> <b>problem</b> is {{to suppress the}} growth of hexagonal phases (h-BN or graphite, respectively). Whereas in diamond growth this is achieved by adding hydrogen gas, boron trifluoride is used for c-BN. Ion beam deposition, plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition, pulsed laser deposition, reactive sputtering, and other physical vapor deposition methods are used as well.|$|E

5|$|Stein's {{formulation}} {{has been}} criticized by historian Sanjay Subrahmanyam, in part, {{on account of the}} lack of extensive historiography for the period. The 18th-century Wodeyar rulers of Mysore—in contrast to their contemporaries in Rajputana, Central India, Maratha Deccan, and Tanjavur—left little or no record of their administrations. Surveying the historiography, Subrahmanyam, says:A <b>major</b> <b>problem</b> attendant on such generalisations by modern historians concerning pre-1760 Mysore is, however, the paucity of documentation on this older 'Old Regime'.|$|E

5|$|The {{existing}} underwater protection {{was replaced}} by the Pugliese system that consisted of a large cylinder surrounded by fuel oil or water that was intended to absorb the blast of a torpedo warhead. It lacked enough depth to be fully effective against contemporary torpedoes. A <b>major</b> <b>problem</b> of the reconstruction was that the ships' increased draft meant that their waterline armor belt was almost completely submerged with any significant load.|$|E
5|$|The {{political}} corruption which had grown considerably during Brezhnev's tenure {{had become a}} <b>major</b> <b>problem</b> to the Soviet Union's economic development by the 1980s. In response, Andropov initiated a nationwide anti-corruption campaign. Andropov believed that the Soviet economy could possibly recover if the government were able to increase social discipline amongst workers. Brezhnev was seen as very vain and self-obsessed, but was praised for leading the Soviet Union into an unprecedented age of stability and domestic calm.|$|E
5|$|A <b>major</b> <b>problem</b> {{was that}} of loss of feed {{material}} and product. Only 1 part in 5,825 of the feed material became finished product. About 90 percent was splattered over the feed bottles or vacuum tanks. The problem was particularly acute with the enriched feed of the Beta calutrons. Extraordinary {{efforts were made to}} recover product, including burning the carbon receiver liners to recover the uranium in them. Despite everything, some 17.4 percent of Alpha product and 5.4 percent of Beta product was lost. Frank Spedding from the Manhattan Project's Ames Laboratory and Philip Baxter from the British Mission were sent to advise on improvements to recovery methods. The death of a worker from exposure to phosgene also prompted a search for a safer production process.|$|E

5|$|All trucks of the LRDG were {{equipped}} with the Bagnold sun compass and some trucks were also {{equipped with}} a P8 Tank Compass. Each patrol had a navigator who always rode in the second truck in the formation. He was equipped with a theodolite and astronomical position tables with which to plot star sightings, and maps. Watches were used and adjusted each evening using the GMT time check. One <b>major</b> <b>problem</b> faced early on by the LRDG {{was a lack of}} accurate maps for Libya in particular. Patrols had to do their own surveys and make their own maps of each route they took. In July 1941 the Survey Section was formed to carry out this task.|$|E
5|$|Ambrose Channel is {{the main}} {{shipping}} channel {{in and out of}} the Port of New York and New Jersey, making it the only means of accessing an important commercial port. Delays posed a <b>major</b> <b>problem</b> for shipping en route to New York City, and bad weather could close the Channel for days. Ships were forced to wait at the Harbor's entrance for conditions to clear. These delays cost shipping companies substantial amounts of money, with each ship costing between $500 and $4000 per hour it was stopped (roughly $5,700 to $46,000 in 2013 dollars).|$|E
5|$|As {{traffic levels}} increased, {{bottlenecks}} at the two-lane tunnels on the Pennsylvania Turnpike became a <b>major</b> <b>problem.</b> By the late 1950s, traffic jams formed at the tunnels, {{especially during the}} summer. In 1959, four Senators urged state officials {{to work with the}} turnpike commission to study ways to reduce the traffic jams. That year, the commission began studies aimed at resolving the traffic jams at the Laurel Hill and Allegheny Mountain tunnels; studies for the other tunnels followed. At the conclusion of the studies, the turnpike commission planned to make the entire turnpike four lanes by either adding a second tube at the tunnels or bypassing them. The new and upgraded tunnel tubes would feature white tiles, fluorescent lighting, and upgraded ventilation.|$|E

Photography {{then moved to}} the Sahara desert outside {{the small town of}} Erfoud, and then to the United Kingdom before {{completion}} of shooting on August 29, 1998. The crew could not shoot in Egypt because of the unstable political conditions. To avoid dehydration in the scorching heat of the Sahara, the production's medical team created a drink that the cast and crew had to consume every two hours. Sandstorms were daily inconveniences. Snakes, spiders and scorpions were a <b>major</b> <b>problem,</b> with many crew members having to be airlifted out after being bitten.|$|E
5|$|For {{his first}} foreign project, Kurosawa chose a story {{based on a}} Life {{magazine}} article. The Embassy Pictures action thriller, to be filmed in English and called simply Runaway Train, would have been his first in color. But the language barrier proved a <b>major</b> <b>problem,</b> and the English version of the screenplay was not even finished by the time filming was to begin in autumn 1966. The shoot, which required snow, was moved to autumn 1967, then canceled in 1968. Almost twenty years later, another foreigner working in Hollywood, Andrei Konchalovsky, would finally make Runaway Train, though from a script totally different from Kurosawa's.|$|E
5|$|Germany's {{refusal to}} give the Dutch access to plans {{detailing}} {{the design of the}} Scharnhorsts below the waterline was a <b>major</b> <b>problem.</b> Inexperienced in designing an underwater protection scheme for a ship of this size, the Dutch were forced to turn to Italy for assistance, which allowed a delegation of engineers and naval officers to enter the country in February 1940. Although the Dutch delegation was barred from viewing technical drawings or the battleship , then under construction, possibly to ensure that the details of their Pugliese system remained a secret, they were allowed to visit , toured several shipyards, interviewed the Chief Constructor of the Italian Navy, and received additional information on the Scharnhorsts, the ItaliansGermany's allyknowing some details of the ships.|$|E
