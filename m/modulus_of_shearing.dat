40|$|AbstractA {{measurement}} technique of viscoelastic properties of polymers is proposed to investigate complex Poisson’s ratio {{as a function}} of frequency. The forced vibration responses for the samples under normal and shear deformation are measured with varying load masses. To obtain <b>modulus</b> <b>of</b> elasticity and <b>shear</b> <b>modulus,</b> the present method requires only knowledge of the load mass, geometrical characteristics of a sample, as well as both the amplitude ratio and phase lag of the forcing and response oscillations. The measured data were used to obtain the viscoelastic properties of the material based on a 2 D numerical deformation model of the sample. The 2 D model enabled us to exclude data correction by the empirical form factor used in 1 D model. Standard composition (90 % PDMS polymer+ 10 % catalyst) of silicone RTV rubber (Silastic® S 2) were used for preparing three samples for axial stress deformation and three samples for shear deformation. Comprehensive measurements <b>of</b> <b>modulus</b> <b>of</b> elasticity, <b>shear</b> <b>modulus,</b> loss factor, and both real and imaginary parts of Poisson’s ratio were determined for frequencies from 50 to 320 Hz in the linear deformation regime (at relative deformations 10 − 6 to 10 − 4) at temperature 25 °C. In order to improve measurement accuracy, an extrapolation of the obtained results to zero load mass was suggested. For this purpose measurements with several masses need to be done. An empirical requirement for the sample height-to-radius ratio to be more than 4 was found for stress measurements. Different combinations of the samples with different sizes for the shear and stress measurements exhibited similar results. The proposed method allows one to measure imaginary part of the Poisson’s ratio, which appeared to be about 0. 04 – 0. 06 for the material of the present study...|$|R

However, seismic design coefficients have not been developed for the design <b>of</b> SCWF <b>shear</b> walls as a main lateral force resisting system for seismic forces. Research is needed to help designers of post-frame construction with accurately determining the behavior <b>of</b> SCWF <b>shear</b> walls subjected to lateral loads. To address these needs, finite element analysis (FEA) models <b>of</b> SCWF <b>shear</b> walls under monotonic and cyclic loading {{as well as the}} reversed cyclic SCWF shear wall tests were developed. With validated FEA predictions, and experimental data on behavior <b>of</b> SCWF <b>shear</b> walls, design information can be developed for post-frame buildings in seismic and high wind regions. FEA models were developed and validated to predict shear strength and effective <b>shear</b> <b>modulus</b> <b>of</b> SCWF <b>shear</b> walls under monotonic loading. Moreover, the hysteretic behavior <b>of</b> SCWF <b>shear</b> walls was predicted using hysteretic behavior of sheathing-to-framing connector elements. Analyses were performed to assess the shear strength, stiffness, ductility, equivalent energy elastic plastic (EEEP), and hysteretic parameters <b>of</b> tested SCWF <b>shear</b> wall specimens. Experimental tests also provided the seismic design coefficients <b>of</b> SCWF <b>shear</b> walls, which are currently lacking in the building codes. The dynamic implicit FEA models predicted well the shear strength and effective <b>shear</b> stiffness <b>of</b> SCWF <b>shear</b> walls under monotonic loading. The dynamic implicit FEA also overcame the deficiencies of the static implicit approach with regard to bucking, nonlinear geometry behavior of steel cladding. In addition, experimental test results showed that SCWF shear walls had high ductility, especially for unstitched shear wall configurations. Based on the research herein, shear walls with high ductility can be considered equivalent to light-framed wood shear walls with regard to behavior under seismic loading. Moreover, the hysteretic behavior <b>of</b> SCWF <b>shear</b> walls under cyclic loading was predicted well, especially for unstitched shear wall configurations. Good agreement was also obtained with regard to shear strength backbone curve, except for heavily stitched shear walls.
