Overmars relished the challenge of playing in England: [...] "I like English football because there is more pace. With my speed and quality I think it will be good for me here." [...] Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger believed Overmars had his [...] "best years ahead of him" [...] and met his criteria of a player [...] "used to the pressures of playing for a big club and everything that goes with it". He opined that Arsenal lost the Premier League at home the previous season – [...] "we were <b>maybe</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> away team," [...] and commented on their inability to play expansive football.

500|$|Upon {{his return}} to the United States, California Chrome was turned out for a month at Taylor Made Farm, then resumed {{training}} with Sherman. On July 23, the horse was entered in the San Diego Handicap where he faced Dortmund, who had finished third in the 2015 Kentucky Derby to American Pharoah. California Chrome tracked behind Dortmund until the far turn, then moved to the front. Dortmund fought back and the two dueled down the stretch, with California Chrome prevailing by half a length while carrying five pounds more than Dortmund. [...] A month later, California Chrome challenged an all-star field in the Pacific Classic, which included a rematch with Dortmund as well as long-time rival Hoppertunity. [...] Most notably, Chrome met the champion mare Beholder for the first time. Beholder, third favorite on the morning line, had won the previous year in her debut against male horses, the only female horse to have ever won that race. California Chrome got the number one post position in the nine-horse field, viewed as an unfavorable draw because, other than his prep race win at Meydan Racecourse, he previously did poorly on the rail. [...] The post position {{turned out not to be}} a problem, as the horse broke cleanly and quickly went to the lead, led throughout the entire race, and only Beholder kept close to him until the mile pole, at which point he pulled ahead of the field and won by five lengths. [...] Espinoza kept a relatively firm hold on the horse throughout the race, and Beholder's rider, Gary Stevens, commented, [...] "Victor was playing with us. I don't think he really let him run. That's scary to think about." [...] In similar form, he again was challenged by Dortmund in the Awesome Again Stakes on October 1. [...] The two horses at one point outdistanced the rest of the field by 12 lengths, but California Chrome led throughout and won by [...] lengths. [...] Art Sherman commented, [...] "You're looking at <b>maybe</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> horse in the world right now." ...|$|E

Although they appealed to gamers who, like Pro-G's Struan Robertson, wanted a [...] "bloody hard, but also bloody good" [...] challenge, it was feared that casual gamers would find the learning curve daunting. IGN warned that gamers with lesser skills might not [...] "get as much out of this game as others due to [...] incredible difficulty", and Edge commented that [...] "Tecmo’s refusal to extend any kind of handhold to less dedicated players is simply a failure of design, not a badge of hardcore honour" [...] and [...] "it’s impossible to believe they couldn’t {{have found a way}} to increase the accessibility of the game without undermining the gloriously intractable nature of the challenges it contains." [...] EGM found the challenge to be [...] "rewarding" [...] as it [...] "motivates you to actually get better at the game." [...] Clive Thompson focused on Ninja Gaiden in his Slate article examining the motivation for playing difficult games. He contends that extreme levels of challenge can be initially very frustrating and may cause a game to be abandoned in disgust. However, where a game also rewards a player's perseverance by teaching the skills required to overcome its challenges, that player will have the motivation to finish the game. Ninja Gaiden, in his opinion, strikes the correct balance between challenge and reward; completion brings [...] "a sort of exhausted exhilaration, like finally reaching the end of War and Peace." [...] In 2012, CraveOnline included it on their list of five [...] "badass ninja games", calling it [...] "the pinnacle of action gaming at the time, holding onto that crown for an entire year until God of War released in 2005" [...] and [...] "a true video game classic, and <b>maybe</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> ninja game of all time."

Among his outings in the United States that year was a runner-up finish at the Philadelphia Distance Run. He had the breakthrough of his career that November, winning the New York City Marathon race.

[...] Brian Truitt of USA Today gave the film three out of four stars, saying [...] "With films such as Funny People and This Is 40, Apatow has toyed with finding the right blend of the serious and the hilarious and finally hits it here." [...] Moira MacDonald of The Seattle Times gave the film three out of four stars, saying, [...] "There's nothing remotely fresh about this plotline (or the way Apatow, true to form, makes the movie 20 minutes longer than it should be), but Trainwreck works as comedy more often than it doesn't—and that's rare enough."
