25|$|Although his {{relationship}} with the pope was rocky, Guiscard preferred to be on good terms with the papacy, and he <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>gesture</b> of abandoning his first wife in response to church law. While the popes were often fearful of his growing power, they preferred the strong and independent hand of a Catholic Norman to the rule of a Byzantine Greek. Guiscard received his investment with Sicily at the hands of Pope Nicholas II, who feared the opposition of the Holy Roman Emperor to the Papal reforms more. Guiscard supported the reforms, coming to the rescue of a besieged Pope Gregory VII, who had once excommunicated him for encroaching on the territory of the Papal States. After the Great Schism of 1054, the polarized religious atmosphere served to strengthen Guiscard's alliance with papal forces, resulting in a formidable papal-Norman opposition to the Eastern Empire.|$|E
2500|$|... "Wittgenstein was {{insisting that}} a {{proposition}} {{and that which}} it describes must have the same 'logical form', the same 'logical multiplicity', Sraffa <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>gesture,</b> familiar to Neapolitans as meaning something like disgust or contempt, of brushing the underneath of his chin with an outward sweep of the finger-tips of one hand. And he asked: 'What is the logical form of that?'" ...|$|E

2500|$|During a 1995 Ryder Cup match, Tom Lehman was {{critical}} of Faldo for not clearly telling him to pick his ball up {{when it was a}} foot away from the hole. Lehman said: [...] "Faldo mumbled something, then <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>gesture</b> to me." [...] This angered the American who said: [...] "I told him to speak clearly. He stretched his arms out as if to say, 'Put the ball in your pocket, you idiot.' [...] " ...|$|E
2500|$|I {{shall never}} forget till my dying day that awful Chinese face which {{actually}} made me rein my horse {{at the door}} of the opium hong where it appeared, after a night’s debauch, at six o’clock one morning.... It spoke of such a nameless horror in its owner’s soul that I made the sign for a pipe and proposed, in “pigeon English,” to furnish the necessary coin. The Chinaman sank down on the steps of the hong, like a man hearing medicine proposed to him when he was gangrened from head to foot, and <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>gesture,</b> palms downward, toward the ground, as one who said, “It has done its last for me — I am paying the matured bills of penalty.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Misbehavior {{by parents}} of San Marin High School {{basketball}} players on February 2, 2008, {{in two games}} with Tam teams led to drafting of the first code-of-conduct contracts for parents of athletes at a Marin County school. Following a girls junior varsity game at Tam, {{the mother of a}} San Marin player followed two referees, shouting obscene insults; later, at San Marin, two parents of San Marin players confronted Tam's coach after he <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>gesture</b> indicating that the home team had [...] "choked." [...] Novato police were called and the parents were later asked not to attend the remaining games of the season. [...] Tam Principal Chris Holleran said that the coach's behavior was inappropriate, but declined to discuss possible disciplinary action.|$|E

2500|$|In 1966, Division 26, the Division for the History of Psychology, of the American Psychological Association was formed. During its formation, the Division 26 members <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>gesture</b> {{to honor}} Boring for his {{tremendous}} contribution {{as a historian}} of psychology. Boring declined {{to run for president}} and was made [...] "honorary president" [...] (p.308) of the Division as an acknowledgment of his work. He was then asked to introduce the first elected president, Robert I. Watson, at the first official meeting, but old age prevented Boring from making the trip. He introduced him by a written statement he mailed, read by John A. Popplestone. In this speech, Boring made jokes that he was the ghost of history's past, a comment that was echoed by his voice being present without his body.|$|E
2500|$|Sagan {{started the}} 2012 Tour de France by {{finishing}} in 53rd {{place on the}} Prologue after losing {{some time in the}} corners. He won the first stage in Seraing atop a small climb [...] after breaking away with {{a little more than a}} kilometre to go with Fabian Cancellara (...) and out sprinting him and Edvald Boasson Hagen (...) [...] According to Sagan's SRM file, in the final 1.5km when Cancellara initiated the move, Sagan ramped up his cadence to over 120rpm to stay with him and averaged 493 watts of power in the last 2 minutes 20 seconds of the race. His power output surged to 1,236 watts in the finale, averaging 970 watts in the last 200 metres. On Stage 3, he came atop the final Category 4 climb in Boulogne-sur-Mer sprinting away and leaving the field behind. As he crossed the finish line, which was situated at the end of the 700-metre slope, he <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>gesture</b> imitating the run of Forrest Gump. He won again on Stage 6, which had a course suited for a bunch sprint and finished in Metz. He beat pure sprinters André Greipel of [...] and Matthew Goss of the [...] squad by a little more than a bike length. He finished the Tour with 3 stage wins and the green jersey, also earning the [...] "most combative" [...] rider award on the mountainous Stage 14. He won a Porsche since he made a bet with the Liquigas management that he could win 2 stages and the points classification.|$|E
