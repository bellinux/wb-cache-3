5|$|Bupropion {{lowers the}} {{threshold}} for epileptic seizures, {{and therefore can}} potentially interact with other medications that also lower it, such as carbapenems, cholinergic agents, fluoroquinolones, interferons, chloroquine, mefloquine, lindane, theophylline, systemic corticosteroids (e.g., prednisone), and some tricyclic antidepressants (e.g., clomipramine). The prescribing information recommends <b>minimizing</b> <b>the</b> use of alcohol, since in rare cases bupropion reduces alcohol tolerance, and because the excessive use of alcohol may lower the seizure threshold. Also, bupropion {{should not be taken}} by individuals undergoing abrupt cessation of alcohol or benzodiazepine use.|$|E

To achieve the effect, the attacking dragonfly flies towards his rival, choosing his path to remain on a line between the rival {{and the start of}} his attack path. The attacker thus looms larger as he closes on the rival, but does not otherwise appear to move. Researchers found that six of 15 encounters involved motion camouflage.|$|E

50|$|The drift-plus-penalty {{algorithm}} (defined below) makes control actions every slot t that greedily <b>minimize</b> <b>the</b> right-hand-side of {{the above}} inequality. Intuitively, taking an action that <b>minimizes</b> <b>the</b> drift alone would be beneficial in terms of queue stability but would not minimize time average penalty. Taking an action that <b>minimizes</b> <b>the</b> penalty alone would not necessarily stabilize the queues. Thus, taking an action to <b>minimize</b> <b>the</b> weighted sum incorporates both objectives of queue stability and penalty minimization. The weight V can be tuned to place more or less emphasis on penalty minimization, which results in a performance tradeoff.|$|R

30|$|Another {{formulation}} for districting uses graph theory. In this formulation, {{the regions}} or geographic units as nodes and the adjacency between regions as edges connect the nodes. For each node, {{there is a}} weight representing attributes of the region, for example, population. The objective of districting is to maximize or <b>minimize</b> <b>the</b> function of the weights between different districts. For example, we could use the absolute difference as <b>the</b> function and <b>minimize</b> <b>the</b> difference in population between districts. For the police districts we want to <b>minimize</b> <b>the</b> difference in forecasted activity between districts since this will <b>minimize</b> <b>the</b> difference in travel or response time.
