Normally, a single SMB will separate only two fractions from each other, but a series or [...] "train" [...] of SMBs can perform multiple cuts and purify one or more products from a multi-component mixture.

Blanco (Ac) and Kandelia obovata (Ko) in <b>multicomponent</b> <b>mixtures</b> (mixture of the ANT and PYR). Experimental results indicated that photodegradation was the main transformation pathway for both ANT and PYR in <b>multicomponent</b> <b>mixtures.</b> The amount of the PAHs volatilizing from the leaf surfaces and entering the inner leaf tissues was negligible. Over {{a certain period of}} irradiation time, the photodegradation of both PYR and ANT adsorbed onto the leaves of Ac and Ko followed first-order kinetics, with faster rates being observed on Ac leaves. In addition, the photodegradation rate of PYR on the leaves of the mangrove species in <b>multicomponent</b> <b>mixtures</b> was much slower than that of adsorbed ANT. Compared with the PAHs adsorbed as single component, the photodegradation rate of ANT adsorbed in <b>multicomponent</b> <b>mixtures</b> was slower, while that of PYR was faster. Moreover, the photodegradation of PYR and ANT dissolved in water in <b>multicomponent</b> <b>mixtures</b> was investigated for comparison. The photodegradation rate on leaves was much slower than in water. Therefore, the physical-chemical properties of the substrate may strongly influence the photodegradation rate of adsorbed PAHs...|$|R

40|$|The {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the adaptive model size reduction for <b>multicomponent</b> <b>mixture</b> processes. Modelling the dynamics of such process using a continuous distribution function to represent the mixture's composition leads to distributed differential-algebraic systems. These systems have to be discretized in time and in the distributed variable. A fully adaptive discretization scheme is developed using a Runge-Kutta time discretization in combination with a Wavelet-Galerkin discretization. The time step adaptivity is controlled by an error estimator based on step doubling. The error estimator for the spatial discretization error is based on a linearized high resolution model. The proposed technique is an alternative to pseudocomponent lumping methods which are currently used to reduce the model complexity of <b>multicomponent</b> <b>mixture</b> processes. With this novel approach the lack of error control and adaptivity in pseudocomponent lumping can be resolved. (orig.)

40|$|Explicit {{expressions}} for {{the heat}} and momentum fluxes are given for a low-density <b>multicomponent</b> <b>mixture</b> in a steady state with temperature and velocity gradients. The results are obtained from a formally exact solution of the Gross-Krook model [Phys. Rev. 102, 593 (1956) ] of the Boltzmann equation for a <b>multicomponent</b> <b>mixture.</b> The transport coefficients (shear viscosity, viscometric functions, thermal conductivity and a cross coefficient measuring the heat flux orthogonal to the thermal gradient) are nonlinear functions of the velocity and temperature gradients and {{the parameters of the}} mixture (particle masses, concentrations, and force constants). The description applies for conditions arbitrarily far from equilibrium and is not restricted to any range of mass ratios, molar fractions and/or size ratios. The results show that, in general, the presence of the shear flow produces an inhibition in the transport of momentum and energy with respect to that of the Navier-Stokes regime.

It can model contaminant behavior under ''natural'' environmental conditions, as well as for engineered systems, such as soil vapor extraction, groundwater pumping, or steam-assisted source remediation.

Semi-theoretical {{relations for the}} excess functions (e. g. excess Gibbs energies GE, excess chemical potentials) developed previously for binary mixtures have been extended to <b>multicomponent</b> <b>mixtures.</b> We postulate that contributions from two-body and three-body interactions are significant, and we propose an expression relating unlike three-body interactions to binary interactions.

Predicting fluid phase equilibria of <b>multicomponent</b> <b>mixtures</b> using existing binary data is relatively simple and, for the systems tested, appears to be considerably better than the NRTL model for VLE systems having partially or wholly negative GE.

While the model is less satisfactory for liquid-liquid equilibria (LLE) than for VLE, it is significantly better than the NRTL or UNIQUAC model for the (randomly selected) system tested.
