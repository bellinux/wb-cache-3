30|$|The {{chloride}} ion {{is the most}} predominant natural form of the element chlorine and is extremely stable in water. The chloride in groundwater may be from diverse sources such as weathering, leaching of sedimentary rocks and soil, domestic and municipal effluents (Sarath Prasanth et al. 2012). The range of chloride is found to vary between 115.21 and 2, 011.8  mg/l for water samples. As per (World Health Organization 2011) and Indian standards (BIS, 1991) the desirable limit for chloride is 250  mg/l. For the study area {{it has been found}} that in certain locations the chloride concentration exceeds the maximum permissible limit. The {{chloride ion}} concentration in groundwater of the study area exceeds the maximum allowable limit of 600  mg/l in two samples (2 and 11).

40|$|AbstractRivers {{and streams}} are {{important}} reservoirs of freshwater for human consumption. These ecosystems {{are threatened by}} increasing urbanization, because raw sewage discharged into them alters their nutrient content and may affect the composition of their microbial community. In the present study, we investigate the taxonomic and functional profile of the microbial community in an urban lotic <b>environment.</b> Samples <b>of</b> running water were collected at two points in the São Pedro stream: an upstream preserved and non-urbanized area, and a polluted urbanized area with discharged sewage. The metagenomic DNA was sequenced by pyrosequencing. Differences were observed in the community composition at the two sites. The non-urbanized area was overrepresented by genera of ubiquitous microbes that act in the <b>maintenance</b> <b>of</b> <b>environments.</b> In contrast, the urbanized metagenome was rich in genera pathogenic to humans. The functional profile indicated that the microbes act on the metabolism of methane, nitrogen and sulfur, especially in the urbanized area. It was also found that virulence/defense (antibiotic resistance and metal resistance) and stress response-related genes were disseminated in the urbanized <b>environment.</b> The structure <b>of</b> the microbial community was altered by uncontrolled anthropic interference, highlighting the selective pressure imposed by high loads of urban sewage discharged into freshwater environments...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Thermal {{insulation}} materials and systems {{have an important}} role in the conservation of energy, in the economical <b>maintenance</b> <b>of</b> com-fortable <b>environments,</b> and in the profitable operation of industries. Proper use of thermal insulation should take into account fire safety aspects. In industry, one important fire safety aspect is prevention of self-heating and spontaneous combustion; ethylene oxide, heat transfer fluid, polyalkylene oxides, and polyether polyols are given as examples. Fire protection to maintain structural integrity and prevent decomposition of reactive chemi-cals is highly desirable. In any structures occupied by people, fire toxicity is an important factor in ability to escape from fires and in extent of fire injuries...|$|R
