5|$|In {{terms of}} medical issues, lesbians are {{referred}} to as women who have sex with women (WSW) because of the misconceptions and assumptions about women's sexuality and some women's hesitancy to disclose their accurate sexual histories even to a physician. Many self-identified lesbians neglect to see a physician because they do not participate in heterosexual activity and require no birth control, which is the initiating factor for most women to seek consultation with a gynecologist when they become sexually active. As a result, many lesbians are not screened regularly with Pap smears. The U.S. government reports that some lesbians neglect seeking medical screening in the U.S.; they lack health insurance because <b>many</b> <b>employers</b> do not offer health benefits to domestic partners.|$|E
5|$|Public {{condemnation}} {{of the use of}} breaker boys was so widespread that in 1885 Pennsylvania enacted a law forbidding the employment of anyone under the age of 12 from working in a coal breaker, but the law was poorly enforced; <b>many</b> <b>employers</b> forged proof-of-age documentation, and many families forged birth certificates or other documents so their children could support the family. Estimates of the number of breaker boys at work in the anthracite coal fields of Pennsylvania vary widely, and official statistics are generally considered by historians to undercount the numbers significantly. One estimate had 20,000 breaker boys working in the state in 1880, 18,000 working in 1900, 13,133 working in 1902, and 24,000 working in 1907. Technological innovations in the 1890s and 1900s (such as mechanical and water separators designed to remove impurities from coal) dramatically lowered the need for breaker boys, but adoption of the new technology was slow.|$|E

Although {{it is not}} required by federal law, employer policies may also protect employees from harassment or discrimination based on marital status or sexual orientation.|$|R

25|$|The Homestead strike {{broke the}} AA {{as a force}} in the American labor movement. <b>Many</b> <b>employers</b> refused to sign {{contracts}} with their AA unions while the strike lasted. A deepening in 1889 of the Long Depression led most steel companies to seek wage decreases similar to those imposed at Homestead.|$|E
25|$|The fiasco {{prompted}} <b>many</b> <b>employers</b> {{using the}} Bedaux System, and those derived from it, {{to change its}} terminology to more neutral and administrative language.

25|$|While the UTW {{called off}} its {{plans for a}} strike, local leaders thought differently. The UTW locals in the {{northern}} part of Alabama launched a strike that began on July 18 in Huntsville, then spread to Florence, Anniston, Gadsden, and Birmingham. While the strike was popular, it was also ineffective: <b>many</b> <b>employers</b> welcomed it as a means of cutting their expenses, since they had warehouses full of unsold goods.|$|E
25|$|During the 1990s and 2000s, <b>many</b> <b>employers</b> {{who promised}} {{lifetime}} health coverage to their retirees limited or eliminated those benefits. ERISA {{does not provide}} for vesting of health care benefits {{in the way that}} employees become vested in their accrued pension benefits. Employees and retirees who were promised lifetime health coverage may be able to enforce those promises by suing the employer for breach of contract, or by challenging the right of the health benefit plan to change its plan documents to eliminate promised benefits.|$|E
25|$|While many Americans {{suffered}} economically {{during the}} Great Depression, African Americans {{also had to}} deal with social ills, such as racism, discrimination, and segregation. Black workers were especially vulnerable to the economic downturn since most of them worked the most marginal jobs such as unskilled or service-oriented work. Therefore, they were the first to be discharged. Additionally <b>many</b> <b>employers</b> preferred white workers. When jobs were scarce some employers even dismissed blacks to create jobs for whites. In the end there were three times more African American workers on public assistance or relief than white workers.|$|E
50|$|Many {{of the new}} {{immigrants}} found that their former education was not recognized by <b>many</b> Israeli <b>employers,</b> though it was recognized by institutions of higher education.

25|$|Over recent years, <b>many</b> <b>employers</b> {{have closed}} their {{defined benefit schemes}} to new members, and {{established}} defined contribution or money purchase arrangements instead. In this arrangement, the employer (and sometimes also the employee) makes regular payments (typically a percentage of salary) into a pension fund, and the fund is used to buy a pension when the employee retires. So the amount of pension depends {{on a number of}} factors including the accumulated amount of the fund, interest rates and projected mortality rates at the time the individual retires.|$|E
25|$|Gold was {{business}} {{manager of the}} New York City Joint Council for two years. Since the IFWU had just held its biennial convention in May 1935, new elections for officers of the international union could not be held until 1937. So, despite overwhelming member support, Gold had to wait {{to run for president}} of the IFWU. He was not idle, however. Relations between various New York City locals were acrimonious after years of inter-union warfare, <b>many</b> <b>employers</b> were openly ignoring provisions of the contract because the union's attention was elsewhere, and organized crime had infiltrated many union shops.|$|E
500|$|Most {{employers}} {{required that}} job applicants {{who had served}} in the military present their discharge papers as part of the application process. Blue-discharge veterans experienced difficulty in securing employment because <b>many</b> <b>employers</b> were aware that the blue discharge meant that the holder was considered undesirable. Those employers who did not know had access to a list of the Separation Program Numbers or [...] "spin" [...] numbers that the military used to classify discharges. At least four such spin numbers indicated a gay-related discharge.|$|E

500|$|The 1896 presidential {{election}} was close by modern measurements, but less {{so by the}} standards of the day, which had seen close-run elections over the previous 20 years. [...] McKinley won with 7.1 million votes to Bryan's 6.5 million, 51% to 47%. [...] The electoral vote was not as close: 271 for McKinley to 176 for Bryan. [...] The nation was regionally split, with the industrial East and Midwest for McKinley, and with Bryan carrying the Solid South and the silver strongholds of the Rocky Mountain states. McKinley did well in the border states of Maryland, West Virginia, and Kentucky. [...] Although Bryan claimed that <b>many</b> <b>employers</b> had intimidated their workers into voting Republican, Williams points out that the Democrats benefited from the disenfranchisement of southern African Americans. [...] Palmer received less than 1% of the vote, but his vote total in Kentucky was greater than McKinley's margin of victory there. Confusion over ballots in Minnesota resulted in 15,000voided votes and may have thrown that state to the Republicans.|$|E
500|$|A {{few months}} after Edgardo's birth, the Mortara family engaged a new servant: Anna [...] "Nina" [...] Morisi, an 18-year-old Catholic from the nearby village of San Giovanni in Persiceto. Like all her family and friends, Morisi was illiterate. She {{had come to the}} city, {{following}} her three sisters, to work and save money towards a dowry so she could eventually marry. In early 1855, Morisi became pregnant, as was not uncommon for unmarried servants in Bologna at this time. <b>Many</b> <b>employers</b> would simply sack girls in such situations, but the Mortaras did not; they paid for Morisi to spend the last four months of her pregnancy at a midwife's home and deliver the child, then had her return to work with them. To protect Morisi and themselves from embarrassment, they told neighbours that their maid was sick and recuperating at home. Morisi gave her newborn baby to an orphanage, as the Papal States required unwed mothers to do, then returned to work with the Mortaras. She remained there until she was hired by another Bologna family in 1857; soon after that she married and moved back to San Giovanni in Persiceto.|$|E
