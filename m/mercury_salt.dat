In that period, the preparations for further development were started, aiming to broaden the range of products and implement modern and highly refined products. In 1952-1953 the installation for methanol synthesis was built and launched on the basis of experiences from the half-technological installation existing in the Research Laboratory since 1934. The produced methanol was the material for formalin and methenamine in the newly constructed and launched installations in that period. In 1953 the first organic product was started to produce on the technological scale - formalin, with capability of 4500 tons per year. Both ammonia intensification as well as the formalin installation were the investments designed and performed independently. The next milestone to change in the productive profile of the company was the start of the construction of the installation of the caprolactam, a half-product to polyamide fibre and plastic production. Year 1957, the anniversary and thirtieth year in the history of “Mościce” was called “the year of great launches”. In addition to the launch of the caprolactam plant, a new <b>mercury</b> <b>salt</b> electrolysis with capacity of 18000 tons per year was commissioned. The intensification of production and construction of new installations caused the increase in demand of the plants for steam and electric power, which could not be obtained by the intensification of the existing heat and power plant (EC I). The decision on construction of a new heat and power plant with capacity of 50 MW with possibility of further development was made. The new heat and power plan (so-called EC II) was built in years 1954-1958. The first stage of the EC II construction was the installation of three steam boilers and two bleeding-condensing turbines.|$|E

40|$|Oxy-fuel {{technology}} for CO₂ capture has largely focused on combustion characteristics {{as a driver}} towards demonstration. Impurity removal studies typically centre on the how current environmental control units (FGD, SCR, activated carbon beds) operate in oxy-fuel firing. However, {{it is expected that}} some removal of NOₓ and SOₓ may occur during compression of flue gas through the lead chamber process. Some commercial systems link the capture of mercury to the formation of acid condensates (as a soluble <b>mercury</b> <b>salt).</b> Mercury in compressed flue gas represents a potential corrosion risk in the processing of CO₂ from oxy-fuel combustion processes. Gas phase elemental mercury (Hg⁰) is difficult to remove from the flue gas and the level of cleaning required to prevent corrosion of cryogenic brazed aluminium heat exchangers is uncertain. This work has investigated the behaviour of gaseous Hg⁰ in pressurised oxy-fuel systems in terms of the potential capture in acidic condensates, interaction with NOₓ gases and liquid stability on de-pressurisation. The work was undertaken on an adapted laboratory scale three stage axial-piston compressor with gas and liquid sampling at pressures up to 30 bar. The main finding was that gaseous Hg⁰ reacts readily with NO₂ formed from NO oxidation at high pressure. This reaction occurred without the presence of water, either water vapour or liquid water, contrary to speculation in the literature. Without NO₂, no capture of Hg⁰ was observed in the compression system. Overall, the capture of mercury during compression occurred as a consequence of high pressure, longer residence time and concentration of NO₂. Capture rates of 100 % Hg and 75 – 83 % NOₓ were measured from the compressor exit at 30 bar g...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: A {{practical}} solid-phase {{synthesis of}} deoxynucleic guanidine (DNG), a positively charged DNA backbone analogue, is reported. The nucleoside coupling {{step in the}} solid-phase synthesis of DNG involves the attack of a terminal 3 '-amine upon an electronically activated 5 '-carbodiimide to create a protected guanidinium internucleoside linkage. The activated carbodiimide is synthesized in situ by the mercury(II) abstraction of sulfur from an unsymmetrically substituted thiourea in which one substituent is an electron-withdrawing protecting group {{and the other is}} the 5 '-nucleoside monomer. This produces, in addition to the carbodiimide, a mercury sulfide precipitate which accumulates in the pores of the solid support, restricting solvent and reagent access and reducing the coupling yields with each successive cycle. This obstacle is overcome by a simple washing step involving a thiophenol solution which readily removes the <b>mercury</b> <b>salt.</b> The addition of this step to the cycle enables DNG oligomers to be synthesized using standard macroporous SPS supports. Coupling yields of 98 % were estimated from the HPLC analysis of the product mixtures. An octameric thymidyl oligomer (II) was synthesized and the fidelity of binding to octameric adenyl DNA oligomers containing cytidyl mismatches was determined. Binding was studied by thermal denaturation (Tm), Job plots, and circular dichroism spectrophotometry. The DNG oligomer (II) formed a 2 : 1 complex with octameric adenyl DNA (III) with a melting temperature of 63 C. Each cytidyl mismatch induced a penalty of 4 to 5 C in the observed melting temperatures. DNA sequences with four or more mismatches showed no base pairing in the presence of II. No association was observed between II and octameric cytidyl DNA. These observations demonstrate that DNG oligomers of moderate length are able to discriminate between complementary and mismatched DNA oligomers. Source type: Electronic(1...|$|E

Methods for the determination {{of some of the most}} important properties of water like pH, metal ion content, and chemical oxygen demand are investigated in detail. The first of the five papers included in this dissertation describes the synthesis, acid-base reactivity and metal ion binding selectivity of two novel crown ether compounds, N,N 2 ̆ 7 -bis(2 -hydroxy- 5 -nitrobenzyl) - 4, 13 -diazadibenzo- 18 -crown- 6 (CCE) and N,N 2 ̆ 7 -bis(7 -hydroxy- 4 -methylcoumarin- 8 -methylene) - 4, 13 -diazadibenzo- 18 -crown- 6 (FCE). Extraction constants for Ba(II), Ca(II), Cd(II), Cu(II), Hg(II), Pb(II), and Sr(II) have been determined for both reagents.
