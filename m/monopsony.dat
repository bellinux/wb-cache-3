5|$|Liniers was {{succeeded by}} Baltasar Hidalgo de Cisneros {{a few months}} later, who pardoned the mutineers to reduce {{political}} conflicts. Cisneros allowed free trade as well, as instructed by the Junta of Seville, which benefited British merchants; Britain was allied with Spain in the Peninsular War. The agents of the Consulate of Cadiz asserted that this would hurt the local economy, moral values, social usages, religious practices, and the loyalty to Spain and its monarchy. As a result, Cisneros closed trade again, restoring the Spanish <b>monopsony.</b> A group of hacendados (owners of haciendas), who did not feel adequately represented at the Cabildo, asked Moreno to defend them. Moreno wrote The Representation of the Landowners, a report that represented the export interest of the landowners, encouraged free trade, and condemned the privileges of the merchants benefited from the <b>monopsony.</b> It is considered the most comprehensive economic report {{from the time of}} the viceroyalty. It represented the new European economic ideas, and noted that the legal <b>monopsony</b> with Spain did not prevent British goods from being smuggled. Several authors have questioned Moreno's authorship of the paper, considering it instead an update of another, previously drafted by Manuel Belgrano, Secretary of the Commerce Consulate of Buenos Aires, written to make a similar request to the former viceroy Liniers. This report, as well as Moreno's prestige in the colonial society, helped him gain the confidence of Cisneros. Yet secretly, Moreno supported the plan to dismiss the Viceroy.|$|E

5|$|Augustus Owsley Stanley I (May 21, 1867 – August 12, 1958) was an American {{politician}} {{from the}} US state of Kentucky. A Democrat, {{he served as}} the 38th Governor of Kentucky and also represented the state in both the U.S. House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate. From 1903 to 1915, Stanley represented Kentucky's 2nd congressional district in the House of Representatives, where he gained {{a reputation as a}} progressive reformer. Beginning in 1904, he called for an antitrust investigation of the American Tobacco Company, claiming they were a <b>monopsony</b> that drove down prices for the tobacco farmers of his district. As a result of his investigation, the Supreme Court of the United States broke up the American Tobacco Company in 1911. Stanley also chaired a committee that conducted an antitrust investigation of U.S. Steel, which brought him national acclaim. Many of his ideas were incorporated into the Clayton Antitrust Act.|$|E
5|$|Michael Ryan, {{director}} of The YoungCuts Film Festival, {{noted that there}} was a precedent for the film in the Air Pirates lawsuit, in which Disney spent eight years in court with some underground cartoonists who had published an underground comix parody in which Mickey Mouse and the other Disney characters engaged in explicit sex and used illegal drugs, among other behavior they avoided in Disney's own narratives. He suggested that Disney buy the rights and release the film itself, which it could easily do as its announced interest would guarantee it a <b>monopsony</b> on the film since no other distributor would want to match Disney's deep pockets or its feared legal response. As a Disney release, Escape from Tomorrow would have a large potential audience of both Disney enthusiasts and antagonists, Disney would be making money from property it already owns instead of someone else and the company's apparent willingness to go in the joke would take some of the satiric edge off.|$|E

40|$|In January 1998 a {{significant}} policy reform deregulated agriculture in Indonesia. It sought to eliminate distorting local monopolies, <b>monopsonies,</b> trade restrictions, interisland maximum shipment quotas and other barriers that effectively lowered farmgate prices. Many of these had been constructed {{to benefit the}} Soeharto family and their business cronies. The reform also sought to lower local taxes and levies targeted at agriculture. This paper demonstrates that deregulation eliminated many of the distorting taxes and levies, and dismantled many (but not all) local monopolies, <b>monopsonies</b> and quotas. Farmers typically now receive {{a higher percentage of}} the destination market price. Many also receive significantly higher real prices for their products, although this differs dramatically across commodities. Local governments complained about local revenues lost through the reforms. Detailed budget analyses reveal that deregulation did not substantially harm local government budgets; instead, other factors caused a decline in the local-source revenue contribution to local budgets. ...|$|R

50|$|Market {{failure is}} a term used by economists to {{describe}} the condition where the allocation {{of goods and services}} by a market is not efficient. Keynesian economist Paul Krugman views this scenario in which individuals' pursuit of self-interest leads to bad results for society as a whole. John Maynard Keynes preferred economic intervention by government to free markets. Some believe that the lack of perfect information and perfect competition in a free market is grounds for government intervention. Others perceive certain unique problems with a free market including: monopolies, <b>monopsonies,</b> insider trading, and price gouging.|$|R
25|$|Commentators {{also point}} out that, even if the ruling's Lochner era legal {{analysis}} is appropriate and correctly applied, Mackay Radio is flawed due to the economic assumptions the Court made. Justice Roberts' opinion assumed perfect competition in labor markets, a lack of <b>monopsony,</b> no statistical discrimination, no information asymmetry, market rationality, and a legal regime which provided {{a level playing field}} and equal protection under the law. Some—and possibly all—of these assumptions are incorrect. Worse, however, the Mackay Radio decision fashioned strong incentives which made it rational for one bargainer (management) to refuse to cooperate and opt out of bargaining.|$|E
25|$|The basic {{supply and}} demand theory predicts that raising the minimum wage helps workers whose wages are raised, and hurts {{people who are not}} hired (or lose their jobs) when {{companies}} cut back on employment. But proponents of the minimum wage hold that the situation is much more complicated than the basic theory can account for. One complicating factor is possible <b>monopsony</b> in the labor market, whereby the individual employer has some market power in determining wages paid. Thus it is at least theoretically possible that the minimum wage may boost employment when affected employees spend more in other sectors of the economy. Though single employer market power is unlikely to exist in most labor markets {{in the sense of the}} traditional 'company town,' asymmetric information, imperfect mobility, and the personal element of the labor transaction give some degree of wage-setting power to most firms.|$|E
25|$|An {{alternate}} view of {{the labor}} market has low-wage labor markets characterized as monopsonistic competition wherein buyers (employers) have significantly more market power than do sellers (workers). This <b>monopsony</b> could be a result of intentional collusion between employers, or naturalistic factors such as segmented markets, search costs, information costs, imperfect mobility and the personal element of labor markets. In such a case a simple supply and demand graph would not yield the quantity of labor clearing and the wage rate. This is because while the upward sloping aggregate labor supply would remain unchanged, instead of using the upward labor supply curve shown in a supply and demand diagram, monopsonistic employers would use a steeper upward sloping curve corresponding to marginal expenditures to yield the intersection with the supply curve resulting in a wage rate lower than would be the case under competition. Also, the amount of labor sold would also be lower than the competitive optimal allocation.|$|E

The lack of a formal regulatory structure with credible enforcement mechanisms, the presence of informal electoral practices conducive to vote-buying, and the legal support for local <b>monopsonies</b> that facilitates exploitive pricing all contribute to the dismal performance of Kenya’s coffee cooperatives. Using a data set of more than 200 coffee farmers representing nine cooperatives, we find a statistically significant relationship between cooperatives empirically determined to be corrupt {{and high levels of}} technical inefficiency in coffee production among their members...|$|R

30|$|In {{addition}} to having the opportunity to select “the best employees” that would not otherwise be available on the external labour market, firms may {{also be able to}} pay former apprentices a wage below the value of their marginal productivity, provided that labour markets are imperfect (Acemoglu and Pischke 1998, 1999 a,[b]; Stevens 1994 a). Thus, labour market frictions increase a firm’s willingness to make a net investment in apprenticeship training (while at the same time reducing an apprentice’s willingness to make such an investment), as the training firm will obtain part of the return from apprenticeship training. Labour market frictions potentially leading to imperfect labour markets include social partner agreements (collective bargaining), mobility costs of workers, moral hazard, <b>monopsonies</b> (see Muehlemann et al. 2013 b) or the interaction between firm-specific and general skills (see Lazear 2009).|$|R

50|$|Economists such as Edmund Phelps reject {{this theory}} because {{it implies that}} workers suffer from money illusion. According to them, {{rational}} workers would only react to real wages, that is, inflation adjusted wages. However, one {{of the characteristics of}} a modern industrial economy is that workers do not encounter their employers in an atomized and perfect market. They operate in a complex combination of imperfect markets, monopolies, <b>monopsonies,</b> labor unions, and other institutions. In many cases, they may lack the bargaining power to act on their expectations, no matter how rational they are, or their perceptions, no matter how free of money illusion they are. It is not that high inflation causes low unemployment (as in Milton Friedman's theory) as much as vice versa: Low unemployment raises worker bargaining power, allowing them to successfully push for higher nominal wages. To protect profits, employers raise prices.|$|R

Using data collected from 200 urban households this study examines the evolution of the dairy market in Ethiopia. In particular, this study suggests that although the Ethiopian dairy market remains extremely thin and volatile, the commercialization of processed dairy products through supermarkets is expanding and is expected to keep doing so in the foreseeable future. Increasing urbanization and corresponding changes in consumer preferences, behaviour and purchasing power are the identified causes for the rise of supermarket-processor dairy chains. This study shows also that emerging dairy chains provide new market opportunities to Ethiopian farmers, but the existence of retail-industrial monopolies and <b>monopsonies</b> jeopardize farmers' economic benefits to a great extent.

40|$|The rise {{of managed}} {{healthcare}} organizations (MCOs) {{and the associated}} increased integration among providers has transformed US healthcare {{and at the same}} time raised antitrust concern. This paper examines how competition among MCOs affects the efficiency gains of improved price coordination achieved through integration. MCOs offer differentiated services and contract with specialized and complementary upstream providers to supply these services. We identify strategic pricing equilibria under three different market structures: overlapping upstream physician-hospital alliances, upstream-downstream arrangements such as Preferred Provider Organizations, and vertically integrated Health Maintenance Organizations. The efficiency gains achieved depend not only on organizational form but also on the toughness of premium competition. We show that, contrary to popular thinking, providers and insurers do not earn maximum net revenue when they are monopolies or <b>monopsonies,</b> but rather at an intermediate level of market power. Furthermore, closer integration of upstream and downstream providers does not necessarily increase net revenues. ...|$|R

As an argument against such a logic {{there is a second}} view that suggests that the source of market failures is inside the market system itself, therefore the removal of other interfering systems would not result in markets with a structure of perfect competition. As an analogy, such an argument may suggest that capitalists don't want to enhance the structure of markets, just like a coach of a football team would influence the referees or would break the rules if he could while he is pursuing his target of winning the game. Thus according to this view, capitalists are not enhancing the balance of their team versus the team of consumer-workers, so the market system needs a [...] "referee" [...] from outside that balances the game.

First, I analyze how trade <b>monopsonies</b> and coercive labor institutions reduced African gains from trade during the colonial period. By using new data on prices to agricultural producers and labor institutions in French Africa, I show that (1) the monopsonistic character of colonial trade implied a reduction in prices to producers far below world market prices; (2) coercive labor institutions allowed the colonizers to reduce prices even further; (3) as a consequence, colonial extraction cut African gains from trade by over 60...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{empirical}} studies {{point to the}} need for a model of bilateral market power between health plans and provider organizations. We develop such a model and use it to analyze the impact on cost and access of alternative contractual relationships between plans and providers.

We analyze subgame perfect strategic pricing equilibria for a range of possible contractual relationships between the upstream providers and the downstream insurers, including different internal organizational structures of vertically integrated health plans, such as group- and staff-model HMOs and PPOs. A decentralized market structure produces inefficiencies from pricing coordination failures. Integration may be able to overcome pricing inefficiencies, with performance affected by the internal organization of vertically integrated health plans.

30|$|Historically, the {{foremost}} {{reason for the}} formation of farmer cooperatives is some type of failure in input supply or output demand markets, in particular local and regional monopolies and <b>monopsonies</b> (Sexton 1990). Indeed, imperfect competition is apparent in most agri-food sectors (McCorriston 2002), although increased market concentration and vertical coordination do not necessarily indicate a market is in failure (Sexton 2013). The spot market may still allow buyers and sellers to come together at relatively low cost, in particular as new technology facilitates an improvement in price discovery and transparency (Drnevich and Croson 2013). However, while the spot market is well-developed in commodity sectors (e.g., grain, sugar), the same is not true of the specialty crop sectors in which LCAs have been observed (e.g., Next Big Thing in the apple sector; Midwest Elderberry Cooperative in the elderberry sector; Mountain States Lamb and Wool Cooperative in the lamb sector). In such sectors, the LCA structure may reduce or even minimize the cost of transacting (e.g., finding information on buyers, prices, and contracts) as compared to the spot market or the traditional cooperative.|$|R
