5|$|The Lyceum {{production}} of Dr. Jekyll and <b>Mr.</b> <b>Hyde</b> {{was scheduled to}} close on September 29, after which Mansfield intended to stage other plays. Initially, he followed this plan, introducing productions of Lesbia and A Parisian Romance {{at the beginning of}} October. However, Mansfield soon reintroduced Dr. Jekyll and <b>Mr.</b> <b>Hyde</b> to his schedule and added performances between October 10 and October 20.|$|E
5|$|The {{play was}} closely {{associated}} with Mansfield's performance; a 1916 retrospective on adaptations of Stevenson's works indicated that Sullivan's Dr. Jekyll and <b>Mr.</b> <b>Hyde</b> was no longer performed after Mansfield's death. Although Irving obtained the UK performance rights, he never staged the play. His son, Harry Brodribb Irving, produced a new adaptation by J. Comyns Carr in 1910. By that time, {{more than a dozen}} other stage adaptations had appeared; the most significant was an 1897 adaptation by Luella Forepaugh and George F. Fish, made available in 1904 for stock theater performances as Dr. Jekyll and <b>Mr.</b> <b>Hyde,</b> Or a Mis-Spent Life.|$|E
5|$|The {{series is}} {{described}} by its creators as a sequel to the novella Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and <b>Mr</b> <b>Hyde,</b> rather than an adaptation of it, with the Robert Louis Stevenson tale serving as a backstory within the series. It stars James Nesbitt as Tom Jackman, a modern-day descendant of Dr. Jekyll, who has recently begun transforming into a version of <b>Mr.</b> <b>Hyde</b> (also played by Nesbitt). Jackman is aided by psychiatric nurse Katherine Reimer, played by Michelle Ryan. Gina Bellman also appears as Claire, Tom's wife.|$|E

5|$|Dr. Jekyll and <b>Mr.</b> <b>Hyde</b> is a four-act play {{written by}} Thomas Russell Sullivan in {{collaboration}} with the actor Richard Mansfield. It is an adaptation of Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and <b>Mr</b> <b>Hyde,</b> an 1886 novella by the Scottish author Robert Louis Stevenson. The story focuses on the respected London doctor Henry Jekyll and his involvement with Edward Hyde, a loathsome criminal. After Hyde murders the father of Jekyll's fiancée, Jekyll's friends discover that he and Jekyll are the same person; Jekyll has developed a potion that allows him to transform himself into Hyde and back again. When he runs out of the potion, he is trapped as Hyde and commits suicide before he can be arrested.|$|E
5|$|Mansfield {{attempted}} to defuse public concern by staging the London {{opening of the}} comedy Prince Karl as a charity performance, despite Stoker's warning that critics would view it {{as an attempt to}} obtain favorable publicity for the production. Although some press reports suggested that Mansfield stopped performing Dr. Jekyll and <b>Mr.</b> <b>Hyde</b> in London because of the murders, financial reasons are more likely. Despite widespread publicity due to the murders and Mansfield's disputes with Bandmann, attendance was mediocre, and the production was losing money. On December 1, Mansfield's tenancy at the Lyceum ended. He left London, taking his company on a tour of England. In December they performed Dr. Jekyll and <b>Mr.</b> <b>Hyde</b> and other plays in Liverpool and Derby, then continued to other cities and performed other plays.|$|E
5|$|When Mansfield {{left the}} UK in June 1889, {{he was deeply}} in debt because of {{production}} losses there. His debts included £2,675 owed to Irving, which Mansfield {{did not want to}} pay because he felt that Irving had not supported him adequately at the Lyceum. Irving sued, winning the UK performance rights to Dr. Jekyll and <b>Mr.</b> <b>Hyde,</b> and Mansfield never performed in England again.|$|E

5|$|As {{the most}} {{successful}} early adaptation of Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and <b>Mr</b> <b>Hyde,</b> Sullivan's play influenced subsequent versions. Later adaptations followed his simplification of the narrative, addition of women characters (especially a romance for Jekyll) and highlighting of the moral contrast between Jekyll and Hyde. Most versions retain the practice of having one actor play Jekyll and Hyde, with the transformation seen by the audience. Several early film versions relied more on Sullivan's play than Stevenson's novella.|$|E
5|$|After {{a success}} as Hamlet in London in 1925, Barrymore left {{the stage for}} 14 years and instead focused entirely on films. In the silent film era, he was well {{received}} in such pictures as Dr. Jekyll and <b>Mr.</b> <b>Hyde</b> (1920), Sherlock Holmes (1922) and The Sea Beast (1926). During this period, he gained his nickname, the Great Profile. His stage-trained voice proved an asset when sound films were introduced, and three of his works, Grand Hotel (1932), Twentieth Century (1934) and Midnight (1939) have been inducted into the National Film Registry.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} 1940s, Turner {{established}} {{herself as a}} leading actress in such films as Johnny Eager (1941), Honky Tonk (1941), Ziegfeld Girl (1941), and Somewhere I'll Find You (1942). She appeared in the 1941 horror film Dr. Jekyll and <b>Mr.</b> <b>Hyde,</b> and her reputation as a glamorous femme fatale was enhanced by her performance in the film noir The Postman Always Rings Twice (1946). Her popularity continued through the 1950s in such films as The Bad and the Beautiful (1952) and Peyton Place (1957), for which she was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actress.|$|E

5|$|Jeffrey Tayor of Stagescreen Productions had {{the idea}} of a modern version of Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and <b>Mr</b> <b>Hyde</b> in the mid-1990s. He {{attempted}} to get it produced in the United States three times, but all three attempts fell through for various reasons. He returned to England from the west coast of the United States and joined with Hartswood Films when Elaine Cameron was scouting for ideas for a supernatural thriller. Cameron then approached Steven Moffat for a script, and a six-part series was commissioned by the BBC's Jane Tranter and John Yorke in November 2005.|$|E
5|$|After {{just two}} weeks of rehearsals, the play opened at the Boston Museum on May 9, 1887, as the first American {{adaptation}} of Stevenson's novella. On May 14, it closed for rewrites. The updated version, produced by A. M. Palmer, opened at the Madison Square Theatre on Broadway on September 12 of that year. Sullivan invited Stevenson, who {{had moved to the}} U.S. that summer; Stevenson was ill, but his wife and mother attended and congratulated Sullivan on the play. The Madison Square production closed on October 1, when Mansfield took his company on a nationwide tour. The tour began at the Chestnut Street Theatre in Philadelphia and visited over a dozen cities, including several returns to Boston and New York. It ended at the Madison Square Theatre, where Dr. Jekyll and <b>Mr.</b> <b>Hyde</b> was performed for a final season matinee on June 29, 1888.|$|E
5|$|At this time, Disney also {{encouraged}} {{his staff to}} see a variety of films. These ranged from the mainstream, such as MGM's Romeo and Juliet (1936)— to which Disney made direct reference in a story meeting pertaining to the scene in which Snow White lies in her glass coffin— to the more obscure, including European silent cinema. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, {{as well as the}} two Disney films to follow it, were also influenced by such German expressionist films as Nosferatu (1922) and The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari (1919), both of which were recommended by Disney to his staff. This influence is particularly evident in the scenes of Snow White fleeing through the forest and the Queen's transformation into the Witch. The latter scene was also inspired by Dr. Jekyll and <b>Mr.</b> <b>Hyde</b> (1931), to which Disney made specific reference in story meetings.|$|E
5000|$|In 1998, the Internet {{magazine}} Salon.com published [...] "This Hypocrite Broke Up My Family" [...] which {{stated that}} from 1965 to 1969, Hyde conducted an extramarital sexual affair with Cherie Snodgrass. At the time, Snodgrass {{was married to}} another man {{with whom she had}} three children. The Snodgrasses divorced in 1967. Hyde said the affair ended when Snodgrass' husband confronted <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Hyde.</b> The Hydes reconciled and remained married until <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Hyde's</b> death in 1992. Hyde was married and 41 years old when the affair occurred. He admitted to the affair in 1998 and attributed the relationship to [...] "youthful indiscretions". The revelation of his affair was exposed while Hyde was spearheading the impeachment hearings of President Bill Clinton over charges of perjury in the Monica Lewinsky affair.|$|R

50|$|Baltimore {{architect}} Bryden Hyde designed these buildings, replicating features {{found in}} Annapolis’ Hammond-Harwood House and Chestertown’s Hynson-Ringgold House. He also painted the heraldic {{arms of the}} founding families above the Parish House fireplace. <b>Mr.</b> <b>Hyde’s</b> ancestor, the Revd.

5|$|Dr. Jekyll and <b>Mr.</b> <b>Hyde</b> was a {{milestone}} in the careers of Sullivan and Mansfield. Sullivan left his banking job to become a full-time writer. He wrote three more plays (none successful), several novels, and a two-volume collection of short stories, {{many of which have}} Gothic elements. Sullivan attempted one more stage collaboration with Mansfield, a drama about the Roman emperor Nero, but they became estranged after its failure. For the actor, playing Jekyll and Hyde helped establish his reputation for dramatic roles; he had been known primarily for comedies. Mansfield continued to struggle financially (in part because of his elaborate, expensive productions) before he achieved financial stability in the mid-1890s with a string of successful tours and new productions.|$|E
5|$|Filming {{began in}} Rome in 1956. The film {{was a low}} budget {{production}} as Lombardo did not care for horror films. Freda and his crew utilized mostly existing sets with only a single scene at the Aniene river filmed outside the studio. The film was shot {{in black and white}} by cinematographer Mario Bava, who felt that that style would better suit the special effects in the film and keep the budget down. Bava worked on the special effects on the film without credit. One of his effects involved Gianna Maria Canale aging make-up that would only be revealed when certain coloured lights were revealed on her. This effect had been done previously in older films such as Dr. Jekyll and <b>Mr.</b> <b>Hyde</b> (1931) and contemporary films including The Man Who Turned to Stone (1957).|$|E
5|$|Mansfield {{also worked}} with Irving and Stevenson's publisher, Longmans, to block Bandmann's {{production}} {{and those of other}} competitors. In the UK, unlike the U.S., the novella had copyright protection. Longmans brought legal actions against the unauthorized versions; its efforts blocked a William Howell Poole production from opening at the Theatre Royal in Croydon on July 26. That day, Fred Wright's Company B presented one performance of its adaptation at the Park Theatre in Merthyr Tydfil before it was also closed. Bandmann had the Opera Comique theater reserved from August 6, but hoped to open his production earlier. Irving blocked this by reserving the theater for Mansfield's rehearsals, and Mansfield's Dr. Jekyll and <b>Mr.</b> <b>Hyde</b> opened at the Lyceum on August 4. Bandmann went ahead with his August 6 opening, but after two performances the production was shut down because of legal action by Longmans.|$|E

5|$|Although a {{commercial}} and critical success, the play closed after 31 performances when Barrymore collapsed, suffering a nervous breakdown. Since appearing in Redemption {{he had worked}} ceaselessly, appearing on stage in the evenings, while planning or rehearsing the next production during the day, {{and by the time}} he appeared as Richard, he was spending his daytimes filming Dr. Jekyll and <b>Mr.</b> <b>Hyde.</b> He spent six weeks recuperating under the ministrations of his father's friend, wrestler William Muldoon, who ran a sanitarium. During the summer of 1920, Oelrichs became pregnant with Barrymore's child, and a quick divorce was arranged with her husband, which left her and Barrymore free to marry in August that year; a daughter, Diana Barrymore, followed in March 1921. Soon after the birth, he began rehearsals for Clair de Lune, which his wife had adapted from Victor Hugo's 1869 novel The Man Who Laughs. Barrymore persuaded Ethel to play the role of the Queen– it was the first time the two had appeared on stage together in over a decade. The play was a critical flop, although the presence of the siblings ensured that it ran for over 60 performances.|$|E
5|$|On August 7, 1888, {{three days}} after the Lyceum opening of Dr. Jekyll and <b>Mr.</b> <b>Hyde,</b> Martha Tabram was {{discovered}} stabbed to death in London's Whitechapel neighborhood. On August 31 Mary Ann Nichols was found, murdered and mutilated, in the same neighborhood. Press coverage linking these and other Whitechapel murders of women created a furor in London. The public and police suspected that {{some or all of the}} murders were committed by one person, who became known as Jack the Ripper. Some press reports compared the unidentified killer with the Jekyll and Hyde characters, suggesting that the Ripper led a respectable life during the day and became a murderer at night. On October 5, the City of London Police received a letter suggesting that Mansfield should be considered a suspect. The letter writer, who had seen him perform as Jekyll and Hyde, thought that Mansfield could easily disguise himself and commit the murders undetected.|$|E
5|$|The Scottish author Robert Louis Stevenson wrote Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and <b>Mr</b> <b>Hyde</b> in 1885 when he {{was living}} in Bournemouth, on England's south coast. In January 1886 the novella was {{published}} in the United Kingdom by Longmans, Green & Co. and by Charles Scribner's Sons in the United States, where it was frequently pirated {{because of the lack of}} copyright protection in the U.S. for works originally published in the UK. In early 1887, actor Richard Mansfield read Stevenson's novella and immediately got the idea to adapt it for the stage. Mansfield was looking for material that would help him achieve a reputation as a serious actor in the U.S., where he lived, and in England, where he had spent most of his childhood. He had played dual roles as a father and son in a New York production of the operetta Rip Van Winkle, and saw another acting opportunity in playing Jekyll and Hyde.|$|E
