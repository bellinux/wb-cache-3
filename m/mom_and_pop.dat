25|$|A {{coalition}} of corporations and individuals formerly {{in the coal}} industry and severely diminished by imposition of the so-called Reachback Tax resisted this illegal taking for over six years through a coalition. The Eastern Enterprises v. Apfel case brought some partial and desperately needed relief from the Reachback Tax to dozens of corporations, <b>mom</b> <b>and</b> <b>pop</b> companies and even individuals economically ravaged by the mandate to pay for healthcare benefits for individuals who had virtually no association with those being taxed or assessed the obligations of the Coal Industry Retiree Health Benefit Act of 1992. That act provided for arguably the most generous fully paid healthcare benefits in the nation, including pregnancy termination for family members of those designated as beneficiaries of the Reachback Tax. The anti-Reachback Tax Coalition toiled at local, state and national levels to effect relief. The efforts of the coalition included numerous Federal district court cases and appeals prior to the Supreme Court's landmark Eastern v. Apfel ruling. Those efforts included a series of paid media op-eds addressed to former U.S. Senator Jay Rockefeller (D-W.Va.), an original sponsor of the act and tax, which appeared on Page 3 of The Washington Post. Jones, Day, Reavis & Pogue's Washington office coordinated that coalition through its long-time Congressional consultant Sam Richardson.|$|E

[...] Lulu had Patty Cake in her arms and when Patty reached in between the narrow bars to touch her father, Lulu suddenly pulled her away. [...] But Patty's arm got caught in the narrow bars and broke. [...] It was a freak accident. [...] No one ever realized that those bars were narrow enough to catch that tiny arm.|$|E
500|$|Gulfton {{includes}} several scattered areas {{of commercial and}} light industrial properties. Gulfton gained {{a large number of}} immigrants in the mid-1980s and the regional economy could not support the increasing pressure of the new workers. This led to higher unemployment rates and families tended to [...] "double-up" [...] housing, where multiple families shared the same unit to reduce family expenditures. Scott Van Beck, head of the Houston Independent School District's West Region in the Gulfton area, stated in a 2006 keynote address to the Rotary Club of Bellaire, [...] "When I look out my window on Chimney Rock, I don't see big corporations; I see Gulfton; I see <b>mom</b> <b>and</b> <b>pop</b> businesses."

She is not seen wearing clothes made out of animals, nor smoked (although in the episodes [...] "Smoke Detectors" [...] and [...] "Hail to the Chief" [...] she did) and is totally sane. Her villainous plot in the show was to steal the Dearlys' farm from them, and using the puppies as a ransom, mainly because the old widow Smedly would not sell it to her and that her mother Malevola demands it. She is an archetypal corporate villain who will seize on any scheme to make money, including drilling oil from the swamp near Dearly farm (thereby polluting it), buying Kanine Krunchies and replacing the nutritious ingredients with sawdust and chalk or sending Jasper and Horace to drive out the owners of <b>Mom</b> <b>and</b> <b>Pop's</b> Grocery Store so she can buy it herself.|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} analyzes {{two factors}} which may lie behind the recent productivity {{surge in the}} US, the lack of productivity growth in Europe and, ultimately, the persistence of significative differences in the levels of productivity across the two macro areas. First, we analyse {{the role played by}} Information Technologies (IT). Second, we study the impact of specific regulatory policies, focusing on the consequences of regulations which constrain the entry of large and peripheral retail stores ("big-boxes"). These issues are explored {{in the context of the}} UK economy, whose recent economic performance is consistent with the overall European picture of sluggish productivity growth (Basu et al., 2003). Furthermore, the questions are approached from a micro data perspective, using a series of novel establishment and firm-level datasets drawn from Census data sources. In the first two essays I focus on the role played by Information Technologies (IT), which appear to have played a substantial role in driving the recent productivity surge of the US economy. Chapter I sets out a theoretical and empirical context in which to study the impact of IT on productivity. Chapter II discusses the effects of IT on a large panel of firms active in the UK economy, observed between 1995 and 2003. A key finding of the study is the apparent ability of US multinationals to obtain higher productivity than non-US multinationals (and domestic UK establishments) from their IT capital. Chapter III, IV and V are dedicated to the study of the retail industry, which accounts for a large part of the European productivity gap vis a vis the US over the past decade. In particular, we study the effect of entry regulations against large retail stores ("big-boxes"). In Chapter III, it is shown that the recent introduction of entry regulations against large stores in the UK has paradoxically increased the competition faced by <b>mom</b> <b>and</b> <b>pops</b> retailers. Chapter IV show evidence that entry regulations have also significantly lowered the productivity of UK retail chains, forcing them to operate at a lower scale of retail activity. This result is set in an international context in Chapter V, where the market structure and the productivity dynamics of the UK retail industry with that of the US and Japan are compared using novel Census data sources...|$|R

It’s a Eurodance-inspired club banger, with thumping backbeats and synths, but the heat generated by the new <b>mom</b> <b>and</b> the Latin <b>pop</b> star? That’s as authentic as it gets. If it was Dev’s and ‘Rique’s intention to get people hot and bothered by their song, starting things off {{on the dance floor}} and finishing them in the bedroom, then mission accomplished. It’s an upbeat, uptempo rump-shaker." [...] Meena Rupani from the Desihits quoted, [...] "Enrique's sultry vocals do well with Dev's ability to talk dirty and make it sound oh so good. The techno elements of the song is what Dev {{has come to be known}} for in her tracks so I'm not surprised she has incorporated that here also. Although, I prefer Dev's other tracks this collaboration was good in theory so I suppose a pat on the back can be given to both singers." ...|$|R
