Hildebrandt (3), on the contrary, believes that there is no resistance acquired by continued use. He believes the large dosages attained by some cocainists to be explicable on a basis of individual resistance to the drug inasmuch as there is an enor-mous variation in the quantity required to cause intoxication in different individuals of the same species. Similarly, Joel (4) points out that Even the large doses of cocaine addicts and their attainment by gradual increase are not alone sufficient to furnish proof of actual ac-quired tolerance to the poison. Clinical tolerance should not be spoken of except where the statement specifically accompanies it that the initial dose had become incapable, after a period, of producing the co-caine effect, that its effective period had perceptibly diminished. The very significant fact remains that the cocaine user, after a voluntary or compulsory interval of six or eight months without cocaine, can resume without harm the same dose at which he discontinued the drug. In <b>morphinists</b> who begin anew, so to speak, on every reversion, this is inconceivable. Although, therefore, in contrast to morphine, we con-sider a tolerance to cocaine in the pharmacological sense as unproved, we are compelled to recognize explicitly the fact of a passionate addic-tion. Other significant facts are that cocainists may reach, {{in the course of a}} few days, a maximum dose, 6 to 8 grams daily, whic...|$|E
