40|$|SYNOPSIS The {{prevalence}} of antibody to hepatitis B antigen, detectable by radioimmunoassay, {{was found to}} be no higher among 58 long-term household contacts of multiply transfused haemo-philiacs than among 100 randomly chosen blood donors. This suggested that such contacts do not have greater exposure to serum hepatitis virus than that occurring through natural means. Among those persons possessing antibody, the multiply transfused haemophiliacs showed a marked tendency for higher antibody titres than their contacts, implying differences in pathogenesis between infection acquired through <b>multiple</b> <b>transfusion</b> and infection acquired naturally. The presence of antibody to hepatitis B antigen (HB Ag) is considered on epidemiological grounds to be an indication of previous infection with serum hepatitis virus. Using the sensitive techniques of passive haemagglutination or radioimmunoassay for detection of antibody, recent serological surveys have suggested that subclinical infection may be a common event. It has been possible to relate this to known risk factors such as <b>multiple</b> <b>transfusion</b> with blood or blood products and contact with renal dialysis units or institutions for the mentally retarded (Lander, Alter, and Purcell, 1971; Szmu...|$|R

40|$|Background: <b>Multiple</b> blood <b>transfusions</b> are the {{mainstay}} of thalassemic patients in order to combat the severe anemia. These frequent blood transfusions result in the excessive iron deposition, leading to multiple injuries {{to a variety of}} organs in the body. In response to these injuries, the levels of various enzymes are disturbed. The whole phenomena usually involve the interrelation of one parameter with some other. The present study aimed to estimate the levels of serum ferritin and hepatic enzymes and to find out any possible correlation between them in thalassemic patients receiving <b>multiple</b> blood <b>transfusions.</b> Methods: A total number of 90 thalassemic patients of both sexes ranging from 10 - 15 years, receiving <b>multiple</b> blood <b>transfusions</b> were included in the present study. Blood samples from all the patients were withdrawn and analyzed for the values of serum ferritin, hemoglobin and hepatic enzymes (serum alanine transaminase, serum aspartate transaminase, serum alkaline phosphatase). Pearson correlation coefficient was applied to observe correlation between serum ferritin level and hepatic enzymes. A P value of and # 8804; 0. 05 was considered statistically significant. Results: The overall values of serum ferritin, and hepatic enzymes (serum Alanine Transaminase, serum Aspartate Transaminase, serum Alkaline Phosphatase) were remarkably increased than their normal values. However, hemoglobin level was considerably decreased in thalassemic patients. A weak positive insignificant correlation was observed between serum ferritin with hepatic enzymes and hemoglobin in thalassemic patients. Conclusion: <b>Multiple</b> blood <b>transfusions</b> cause iron overload in the body, which in turn, lead to increased serum ferritin levels in thalassemic patients. High levels of hepatic enzymes are somewhat correlated to serum ferritin concentration. However, the exact reason of elevated levels is still unclear. Further detailed studies should be conducted in order to identify the exact mechanism behind this and to search for the promising correlations of various parameters in thalassemic patients receiving <b>multiple</b> blood <b>transfusions.</b> [Int J Res Med Sci 2014; 2 (3. 000) : 988 - 994...|$|R

Will is assigned {{to write a story}} about Paul for Sonix, who he interviews in Paul's room at the Salem Inn. Due to confidentiality, Sonny doesn't know whom Will is interviewing, and because Sonny has never talked about his exes with Will, neither Will nor Paul knows about the other's relationship with Sonny. Will suspects Paul is gay, and realizes he could get a scoop with an article about the life of a professional gay athlete, as well as help another gay man come out. Attracted to each other, Will and Paul have a night of sex in the hotel. Whilst Will is immediately remorseful, and is determined it won't happen again, he is still very keen to get the scoop, and he convinces Paul to come out in the article (which initially was to be a feature about Paul and his career-ending injury). Paul tells Will about turning down a marriage proposal from {{the love of his life}} (this is Sonny, but Paul doesn't tell Will the name) because Paul felt he could not be an out gay athlete. Will's article on Paul is published, and Sonny learns from Derrick (a bellhop who has flirted with Paul, Will, and Sonny throughout Paul's hotel stay) that Will and Paul have slept together. Before he can confront Will, Sonny is stabbed as a result of Clyde Weston's vendetta against Sonny's Uncle Victor. Sonny's life is saved by <b>multiple</b> <b>transfusions</b> of blood donated by Paul, who has responded to an emergency appeal for blood, and who only later learns that the patient is Sonny.

50|$|On 23 March 1994, Discoverer {{was in the}} Pacific Ocean 300 nmi km east of Easter Island {{allowing}} {{several members}} of her crew to engage in recreational swimming when a shark attacked the swimmers. After biting Seaman Phil Buffington, inflicting wounds on his legs that would require over 50 stitches to close, the shark attacked Heather Boswell, a 19-year-old student aboard for a six-month stint working in Discoverers galley, pulling her under, shaking her viciously, and biting off her left leg at mid-thigh. Three members of Discoverers crew—Matthew N. Ofthus, Jon M. Knox, and Lisa K. Glover—came to her rescue in a boat, with two pulling her from the shark's jaws and into the boat while the third beat the shark with a stick. The shark then moved toward a third swimmer who was still partially in the water while climbing onto Discoverer via a rope ladder, but shots fired by crewmen aboard Discoverer apparently drove it away before it could attack. Boswell and Buffington were brought aboard Discoverer, where the ship's registered nurse, Lieutenant Commander Judeth L.

Simoneaux, NOAA Corps, Lieutenant Commander James Herkelrath, NOAA Corps, and Lieutenant Commander Steve C.

40|$|Introduction. The {{mechanism}} by which blood transfusion increases blood pressure in a substantial proportion of patients with congenital hemolytic anemia is unknown. Vascular endothelium dysfunction and increased endogenous vasoactive substances have been postulated in the pathogenesis of hypertension following <b>multiple</b> blood <b>transfusions.</b> The present study was undertaken {{to test the hypothesis}} whether increased circulating vasoconstrictors following blood transfusions, if documented, is a potent modulator of hypertension in patients with congenital anemia. Materials and Methods. Four children with congenital hemolytic anemia developed severe hypertension and convulsions 2 to 4 days after they received <b>multiple</b> blood <b>transfusions.</b> None had a history of prior hypertension, kidney disease or seizures before the blood transfusion. Baseline blood and urine samples were obtained for routine renal function studies. Blood samples were also drawn during and 2 weeks after the clinical events for determination of epinephrine, norepinephrine, dopamine, and plasma renin activity. Results. Kidney function was normal in all the 4 patients. All had elevated plasma renin activity and increased blood epinephrine, norepinephrine, and dopamine concentrations during hypertensive crises. Hypertension responded to antihypertensive drugs with the patients remaining normotensive 3 to 6 days after commencing therapy. All recovered without further seizures. The elevated plasma renin activity, epinephrine, norepinephrine, and dopamine levels returned to reference levels 2 weeks after completion of the last blood transfusion. Conclusions. These data suggest that increased activity of vasoconstrictors in the recipient plasma may be responsible for the development of hypertension after <b>multiple</b> blood <b>transfusions.</b> </p...|$|R
