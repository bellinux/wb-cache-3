40|$|Since the mid- 1990 s, the {{national}} income and product accounts personal saving {{rate for the}} United States has been trending down, dropping into negative territory for three months {{during the past two}} years. This paper examines measurement problems surrounding two of the standard definitions of the personal saving rate. The authors conclude that, despite these measurement problems, the recent decline of the U. <b>S.</b> <b>personal</b> saving rate to low levels seems to be a real economic phenomenon and may be a cause for concern for several reasons. After examining several possible explanations for the trend advanced in the recent literature, the authors conclude that none of them provides a compelling explanation for the steep decline and negative levels of the U. <b>S.</b> <b>personal</b> saving rate.

40|$|The steep {{drop in the}} U. <b>S.</b> <b>personal</b> saving rate {{over the}} last decade has fueled {{speculation}} that Americans are spending recklessly. But alternative measures of personal saving show that households are actually setting aside a larger share of their resources than the official figures suggest. In addition, government saving has risen markedly, leading to an increase in overall domestic saving that has helped finance a surge in U. S. investment. The U. <b>S.</b> <b>personal</b> saving rate has fallen dramatically since the early 1990 s. It surpassed earlier record lows in 1999 and, on occasion this year, even dipped below zero (Chart 1). The decline has prompted fears that households have become financially overextended—a condition that could slow or reverse the recent strong growth of consumer spending. Adding to the concern is the belief, voiced by many observers, that overall saving and capital formation in the United States are inadequate. In this edition of Current Issues, we argue that thes...|$|R
