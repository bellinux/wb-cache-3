Both the new and remodeled tunnels would have fluorescent lighting, white tile walls, and -wide lanes. The portals of the new tunnels were designed to resemble those of the original tunnels.

With the completion of these projects, the stretch of roadway passing through the Rays Hill and Sideling Hill tunnels became known as the Abandoned Pennsylvania Turnpike. The turnpike commission continued to maintain the tunnels for a few years, but eventually abandoned them. The abandoned stretch deteriorated; signs and guardrails were removed, pavement started crumbling, trees grew in the median, and vandals and nature began taking over the tunnels.

40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the influence of}} surface features, {{in the form of}} pits, on the wear resistance of grey cast iron (GCI), a finite element model of the pin-on-disc friction system, with pits distributed in a curved radial direction, was developed using APDL programming and the tribological behavior of textured surfaces was studied. The influence of relative rotation direction between the disc and the pin on the thermal behavior of the friction system under dry wear conditions was researched. GCI and C 30 E steel samples with pit textured surfaces were manufactured using laser <b>marking</b> <b>equipment</b> and tested using a tribology wear testing rig. The mass losses were measured and the worn surfaces were characterized. The influence of different rotation directions on the tribological behavior of the pit textured surfaces was also investigated. The simulation and test results revealed that rotation direction was a crucial parameter in determining the tribological behavior of surfaces with these features, regardless of the material. Under the conditions tested, when the pin rotated anticlockwise, the samples showed better friction and wear behavior than when the pin rotated clockwise. These results can provide important guidance for the optimization of the design of heavy-load brake systems and other similar applications...|$|E
40|$|Symposium {{organised}} by Kerry Walton and Janette Matthews {{in collaboration}} with the Textile Research Group and the Drawing Research Group the event explored themes in relation to the use of lasers in Art & Design and their contribution to making artefacts. Laser processing of metals, acrylics, wood, textiles and other materials is a well-known industrial process for cutting and <b>marking.</b> <b>Equipment</b> is becoming more accessible and even commonplace in academic institutions for use by Art & Design and Design Technology departments. As is often the case with emerging technologies, there is a requirement for the potential to be fully understood before the process can be exploited. A number of practitioners, designers and technologists are involved in exciting work that moves the laser process beyond just a cut or a mark in a material. This one-day symposium will explore the laser process in Art & Design and the relationship of practitioners to the technology. Through a series of illustrated presentations and panel discussions by leading artists, designers, researchers and technologists, it will show how the process is being exploited through innovative practice and demonstrate that laser processing is more than a means of cutting. The relationship between laser technology and its impact on underlying practice will be questioned. Advances and emerging trends in the development of laser technology and the consequent impact on practice will also be explored...|$|E

40|$|This report {{summarizes}} the efforts completed in identifying candidate fluorescence compounds and radioisotopes for a developing tagging system. The tagging system {{is being developed}} {{as a deterrent to}} nuclear smuggling, by providing a means of: (1) tracing materials and pilferers to the facility of origin for any recovered special nuclear materials, (2) inventory control of long-term stored items containing special nuclear materials, and (3) tracking materials transferred between facilities. The system uses three types of materials to cover a range of applications intended to prevent the pilfering of special nuclear materials. One material, fluorescent compounds which are invisible without ultraviolet or near-infrared detection systems, is marked on controlled items with a tracking pattern that corresponds to a specified item in a specified location in the data control system. The tagging system uses an invisible, fluorescent dusting powder to <b>mark</b> <b>equipment</b> and personnel who inappropriately handle the tagged material. The tagging system also uses unique combinations of radionuclides to identify the facility of origin for any special nuclear material. This report also {{summarizes the}} efforts completed in identifying hardware that will be used for the tagging system. This hardware includes the devices for applying the tagging materials, the commercially available fluorescence detection systems, and gamma ray detection systems assembled from existing, commercially available technologies...|$|R
