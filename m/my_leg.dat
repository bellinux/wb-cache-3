5|$|In February 1993, Sheindlin's outspoken {{reputation}} {{made her}} {{the subject of a}} Los Angeles Times article, profiling her as a woman determined to make the court system work for the common good. She subsequently was featured in a segment on CBS's 60 Minutes, bringing her national recognition. This led to her first book, Don't Pee on <b>My</b> <b>Leg</b> and Tell Me It's Raining, published in 1996. She retired as a family court judge that same year after hearing over 20,000 cases. After her retirement, Sheindlin continued to receive increasing amounts of public attention.|$|E
5|$|Sheindlin has {{authored}} seven books. In 1995, Judge Sheindlin published {{her first}} book, “Don’t Pee On <b>My</b> <b>Leg</b> and Tell Me It’s Raining,” {{in which she}} offers her insight into {{how and why the}} family court fails in its mission to impact shattered families. “Beauty Fades, Dumb Is Forever,” her second book, was published in January 1999. A New York Times best seller, the book challenges women to be the best they can be.|$|E
5|$|I {{remained}} on the wreck until she went down; the suction took me down some way, and a man got hold of <b>my</b> <b>leg,</b> but I managed to kick him off and came up and struck out for some pieces of wood {{that were on the}} water and started for land, about two miles off. I was in the water about five hours, as the shore was so rocky and the surf ran so high that a great many were lost trying to land. Nearly all those that took to the water without their clothes on were taken by sharks; hundreds of them were all round us, and I saw men taken by them close to me, but as I was dressed (having on a flannel shirt and trousers) they preferred the others. I was not in the least hurt, and am happy to say, kept my head clear; most of the officers lost their lives from losing their presence of mind and trying to take money with them, and from not throwing off their coats. - Letter from Lieutenant J.F. Girardot, 43rd Light Infantry, to his father, 1 March 1852.|$|E

25|$|I had to gain {{them some}} time, and I {{could think of}} nothing other than to attack. I had to stop them somehow. I distracted them, and I even managed to shoot one down, but then I myself was hit.

25|$|I'm {{just happy}} to be here. I think being a young artist, just {{starting}} out of high school, what kids listen to is club music. We don't necessarily get too deep or sing like Aretha Franklin. That's not even what music is truly about today. It's sad, but when I want to give a little bit of sex, being fabulous or sassy. I definitely {{want to be able to}} sing and back that up, and being a dancer first has sort of given me a complex that I have to be able to sing, period, with a band. If I break <b>my</b> <b>leg,</b> I'd like to give a show without pyrotechnics and choreography every five seconds.|$|E
500|$|What I went through, only I {{will ever}} know. My knee cap {{completely}} {{turned to the}} right, a ball of blood forming on <b>my</b> <b>leg</b> and the bone that broke, {{without being able to}} move my body. And the pain, a pain that I wouldn't wish on anyone. The surgeon placed a big support [...] in <b>my</b> <b>leg,</b> because the bone had moved so much. Breaking a femur is always serious in itself but an open break in an athlete of high level going flat out, that tears the muscles. At 180 beats , there was a colossal amount of blood being pumped, which meant <b>my</b> <b>leg</b> was full of blood. I'm just grateful that the artery was untouched.|$|E

500|$|One of Paul's main storylines {{culminated in}} him having his leg amputated after an accident. The storyline has {{received}} some criticism as Paul was shown on different occasions not limping with his false leg. Dennis explained {{during an interview}} how the production team helped ensure to make his limp appear more effectively, stating [...] "They made me a splint which actually makes me sort of limp, but keeps my foot rigid {{so it looks like}} I actually do have a non-moving piece. One time I did change <b>my</b> <b>leg,</b> as in I swapped it over and limped on the other one to see if anyone noticed."

500|$|Air safety {{investigators}} attributed Vulović's survival to {{her being}} trapped by a food cart in the DC-9's fuselage as it {{broke away from}} the rest of the aircraft and plummeted towards the ground. When the cabin depressurized, the passengers and other flight crew were sucked out of the aircraft and fell to their deaths. Investigators believed that the fuselage, with Vulović pinned inside, landed at an angle in a heavily wooded and snow-covered mountainside, which cushioned the impact. Vulović disputed the assertion that she was discovered in the aircraft's fuselage on the basis of her conversations with Honke. [...] "The man who found me... told me that I was in the middle part of the plane," [...] she said. [...] "I was found with my head down and my colleague on top of me. One part of my body with <b>my</b> <b>leg</b> was in the plane and my head was out of the plane. A catering trolley was pinned against my spine and kept me in the plane." [...] Vulović's physicians concluded that her history of low blood pressure caused her to pass out quickly after the cabin depressurized and kept her heart from bursting on impact. Vulović said that she was aware of her low blood pressure before applying to become a flight attendant and knew that it would result in her failing her medical examination, but she drank an exorbitant amount of coffee beforehand and was accepted.|$|E

2500|$|Despite his injury, Liu Zan {{remained}} headstrong and unyielding. He {{was particularly}} fond of reading military and history books. Whenever he read about how military commanders {{in ancient times}} deployed their troops in battle, he would sigh because he thought that he could never be like them. He once told his family and friends, [...] "The Empire {{is in a state}} of chaos, with so many people fighting for power. Throughout history, only extraordinary people will succeed in becoming rich and famous. Now that I can't do anything with this crippling injury, I am no different from being dead. I intend to cut <b>my</b> <b>leg.</b> If I am lucky enough to survive and be able to straighten <b>my</b> <b>leg,</b> then I'll be able to pursue my dreams. If I die, then so be it." [...] His family and friends tried to stop him but to no avail. He cut himself in the leg and let blood flow freely, but became unconscious because of the pain. After he recovered, he could straighten his leg and walk normally again.|$|E

2500|$|Landis {{rode the}} 2006 Tour with the {{constant}} pain from the injury, which he described: [...] "It's bad, it's grinding, it's bone rubbing on bone. Sometimes it's a sharp pain. When I pedal and walk, it comes and goes, but mostly it's an ache, like an arthritis pain. It aches down <b>my</b> <b>leg</b> into my knee. The morning {{is the best}} time, it doesn't hurt too much. But when I walk it hurts, when I ride it hurts. Most {{of the time it}} doesn't keep me awake, but there are nights that it does." [...] During the Tour, Landis was medically approved to take cortisone for this injury, a medication otherwise prohibited in professional cycling for its known potential for abuse. Landis himself called his win [...] "a triumph of persistence" [...] despite the pain.|$|E

Half of the ship's crew were lost, while the {{remainder}} who survived, including Ordinary seaman Toovey, were captured by the Japanese and spent {{the remainder of the}} war in Prisoner of War camps. While imprisoned, he reportedly resisted recommendations to have his leg amputated because of an ulcer, telling his captors [...] "You can't take <b>my</b> <b>leg</b> off because I've got to play cricket for Queensland."

Osbourne injects Copaxone medication daily, uses vitamin supplements and hormone replacement therapy, and has travelled to Europe for stem cell therapy.

No. But if I don't take care of myself, who knows."
