The alignment of its amino acid sequence with those of other members of this family (human somatotropin receptor/murine IL- 3 receptor β and human IL- 2 receptor β) has suggested that amino acids included in two SSFY repeats found in each of its hematopoietin receptor domains, contribute to the binding of the ligand. The involvement of these amino acids in IL- 6 binding and signal transduction was studied by site- directed mutagenesis and molecular modelling. We present a computer-derived three-dimensional model of the IL- 6 /IL- 6 receptor complex based on the structure of the human somatotropin/human somatotropin receptor complex. This model allowed the location of distinct regions important for IL- 6 and gp 130 binding.

40|$|Increasing engine {{performance}} requirements and demanding markets pose challenges for engine manufacturers, {{which has led}} to more complex control systems. Engine control software development is expensive and time consuming process especially in marine industry. Engine modeling and rapid prototyping are proposed to shorten control system development cycles. <b>Model</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>loop</b> simulation can be used to test control system functionality. For this purpose, a zero dimensional mean value engine model is parameterized for a Wärtsilä 6 cylinder medium speed four stroke dual fuel engine. Before parameterization, dual fuel engine operating cycle and combustion process are reviewed in order to model the processes based on physical phenomena. The Combustion Model is the most complex of all the modeled systems. Other systems of the mean value engine model are Engine Model that covers air flow through the engine, Gas System that models fuel gas admission, Fuel System that is in charge of diesel fuel injection, Lube Oil System that simulates heat transfer to lubricating oil and Cooling Water Circuit that handles engine and charge air cooling. These systems are modeled to a varying degree of accuracy. The equations used to model the components of each system are presented. Instrument and start air systems of the engine are not modeled. The engine model is made with Matlab/Simulink. In order to test the control system against the model and ensure their compatibility, control inputs used to influence the plant model and measurement outputs for control system feedback are processed. Test run on the actual engine is made to collect reference data of the engine’s performance. Measured data is used to parameterize the engine model via simulation on development computer. The model is then discretized for real time simulation. During real time simulation on target computer, engine controllers are parameterized to get realistic response. Engine model accuracy is validated by comparing steady-state performance and transient response of the model against measured engine data. Analysis of the results confirms that engine model accuracy is sufficient for control system functionality testing. However, the accuracy is not enough for control system calibration. Due to adequate accuracy, realistic cause and effect relationships between different engine systems and real time simulation capabilities, the engine model can be used for rapid prototyping based control system development...|$|E

In order to test the system in MIL (<b>Model</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Loop)</b> and DIL (Driver In the Loop) environments, an important task is the specification of a fuel consumption model. In {{the first part of the}} thesis an overview is presented about fuel consumption models and several eco-devices developed by different authors. In the second part of the thesis an experimental campaign (with a sample of 100 drivers) is carried out in order to specify and validate the model. The survey is supported by the DRIVEIN 2 (DRIVEr monitoring: technologies, methodologies, and IN-Vehicle Innovative systems) project. As the major data are collected using the OBD-II port of the vehicle, and in particular the data related the instantaneous fuel consumption, a validation of the former data is carried out in collaboration with the CNR (Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche – Istituto motori). To carry out a more realistic simulation a vehicle dynamics model was coupled with the ADAS model. The purpose of the implemented vehicle dynamics model is to simulate, in real time, the vehicle’s dynamic behaviour, thanks to continuous integration of the balance equations regulating the longitudinal and lateral vehicle motion. Furthermore, a model able to provide an estimation of real-time fuel consumption of the vehicle is developed: such a model is embedded in the vehicle model discussed in the following, in order to optimize consumption performance during driving task. The implemented system is a next-generation eco-drive system, in the sense that it is able to observe the driver's behaviour and the current fuel consumption, as well as to simulate the fuel consumption in the same traffic conditions and stimuli the driver is subject to, and finally to compare the actual fuel consumption with this of an eco driver.

In addition, an important aspect is verification of models using non-floating point arithmetic, as this method of calculation of often used in automotive embedded computers (e. g. FPGA). The formal verification of such models is discussed. With respect to the integration tests, the article concentrates on some issues of hardware-in-the-loop testing. The system tests are also discussed, especially the structure of system information in a model based approach and the preconditions determined by hardware in the loop tests. In the final acceptance tests, the main problems contain: formal link between the system requirements and the test methods and coordination and optimisation of the whole test process.

While geometric models, photographic images and laser-scanned point clouds are ideally co-registered to national coordinate grids {{at the time}} of acquisition, the quantity and diversity of data sources means that registration must often be performed post facto. Moreover, the sheer size of urban point clouds prevents automated conversion and registration of the entire data set at once. We describe an interactive tool that manages the workflow for converting urban-scale point clouds to grid-registered geometric <b>models.</b> Our “user <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>loop</b> ” approach lets us leverage natural human understanding of the data to bypass issues of scale...|$|R

The {{article is}} devoted to the {{adaptation}} of the controller parameters during its operation {{as a part of a}} control <b>loop.</b> <b>The</b> possibility to identify the parameters of <b>the</b> controlled plant <b>model</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> closed control <b>loop</b> has been proved by a computer simulation. The described active identification method is based on the response processing of <b>the</b> closed <b>loop</b> control system to standard actions. The developed algorithm has been applied to determine the model parameters of the flaming fluorination reactor used for the production of uranium hexafluoride. Designed identification method improves the quality of the product and the efficiency of the entire production...|$|R

On one side, work in autonomic computing focuses on systems that are able to maintain themselves, driven by high-level policies. Such a selfadministration relies on the concept of a control <b>loop.</b> On <b>the</b> other side, modeling is currently used to ease design of complex distributed systems. Nevertheless, at runtime, models remain useless, because they are decoupled from the running system which is subject to dynamic changes. representation of the system used to analyze the situation and to adapt the application properly. Our proposition, named Distributed Autonomous Component-based ARchitectures (Dacar), introduces <b>models</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> control <b>loop.</b> Using adequate models into <b>the</b> control <b>loop,</b> it is possible to design both the distributed systems and their evolution policies, and to execute them. <b>The</b> metamodel suggested <b>in</b> our work mixes both OMG Deployment and Configuration specification and the Event-Condition-Action (ECA) metamodels. This paper treats the different concerns that are present <b>in</b> <b>the</b> control <b>loop</b> and focuses on the concepts of the metamodel that are needed to express entities of <b>the</b> control <b>loop.</b> It also gives an overview of the current Dacar prototype and illustrated it on an ubiquitous application example...|$|R
40|$|The {{carbohydrate}} response element (ChoRE) is a {{cis-acting sequence}} found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> promoters of genes induced transcriptionally by glucose. The ChoRE {{is composed of}} two E box-like motifs that are separated by 5 bp and is recognized by two basic helix–loop–helix/leucine zipper (bHLH/LZ) proteins, ChREBP and Mlx, which heterodimerize to bind DNA. In this study, we demonstrate that two ChREBP/Mlx heterodimers interact to stabilize binding to the tandem E box-like motifs <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ChoRE. Based on a model structure that we generated of ChREBP/Mlx bound to the ChoRE, we hypothesized that intermolecular interactions between residues within <b>the</b> Mlx <b>loop</b> regions of adjacent heterodimers are responsible for stabilizing the complex. We tested this hypothesis by preparing Mlx variants <b>in</b> which <b>the</b> <b>loop</b> region was replaced with that of another family member or mutated at several key residues. These Mlx variants retained their ability to bind to a single perfect E-box motif as a heterodimer with ChREBP, but no longer bound to the ChoRE nor supported glucose responsive activity. In summary, our results support a <b>model</b> <b>in</b> which <b>the</b> <b>loop</b> regions of Mlx play an important functional role <b>in</b> mediating <b>the</b> coordinate binding of ChREBP/Mlx heterodimers to the ChoRE...|$|R
40|$|Considering disordered {{electron}} systems {{we suggest}} a scheme {{that allows us}} to include an electron-electron interaction into a supermatrix sigma-model. The method is based on replacing the initial model of interacting electons by a fully supersymmetric model. Although this replacement is not exact, it is a good approximation for a weak short range interaction and arbitrary disorder. The replacement makes the averaging over disorder and further manipulations straightforward and we come to a supermatrix sigma-model containing an interaction term. The structure of the model is rather similar to the replica one, although the interaction term has a different form. We study the model making perturbation theory and renormalization group calculations. We check the renormalizability of <b>the</b> <b>model</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first <b>loop</b> approximation and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first order <b>in</b> <b>the</b> interaction. <b>In</b> this limit we reproduce the renormalization group equations known from earlier works. We hope that the new supermatrix sigma-model may become a new tool for non-perturbative calculations for disordered systems with interaction.
