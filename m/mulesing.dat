25|$|In {{order to}} help comply with the 2010 {{deadline}} to phase out <b>mulesing,</b> Western Australia's governmental research stations ceased <b>mulesing</b> their sheep on 1 April 2008.|$|E
25|$|<b>Mulesing</b> is a {{procedure}} which, in Australia, {{is carried out}} by {{a person who has}} completed the mandatory accreditation and training programme, usually a professional <b>mulesing</b> contractor.|$|E
25|$|Some {{animal rights}} activists {{consider}} unanesthetised <b>mulesing</b> to be inhumane and unnecessary. They have also argued that <b>mulesing</b> may mask genetic susceptibility to flystrike allowing for genetic weaknesses to be continued.|$|E
25|$|<b>Mulesed</b> lambs {{should be}} {{released}} onto clean pasture. The ewes and suckling lambs should receive minimal disturbance until all wounds are completely healed (about four weeks). Observation should {{be carried out}} from a distance.|$|R
25|$|Merino sheep bred on {{selection}} principles may be {{more resistant}} to flystrike because they are plain bodied (lower skin wrinkling around the breech). Studies have shown that flystrike is lower in plain bodied sheep. However, <b>mulesed</b> animals had consistently lower flystrike than unmulesed regardless of body type.|$|R
25|$|When managed {{according}} to the standards, policies and procedures developed by the CSIRO, lambs are normally <b>mulesed</b> {{a few weeks after}} birth. The operation usually takes less than a minute. Standard practice is to do this operation simultaneously with other procedures such as ear marking, tail docking, and vaccination. Because the procedure removes skin, not any underlying flesh or structure, there is little blood loss from the cut other than a minor oozing on the edges of the cut skin.|$|R
25|$|At {{the time}} <b>mulesing</b> was invented, crutching {{was done with}} blade shears. In Australia, these have been almost universally {{replaced}} with machine shears. Hand shears were being used when Mules inadvertently carried out the procedure during crutching. <b>Mulesing</b> would not inadvertently occur using modern machine shears.|$|E
25|$|PETA {{has also}} {{objected to the}} {{practice}} of <b>mulesing</b> (removing strips of wool-bearing skin from around the buttocks of a sheep). In October 2004, PETA launched a boycott against the Australian wool industry, leading some clothing retailers to ban products using Australian wool from their stores. In response, the Australian wool industry sued PETA, arguing among other things that <b>mulesing</b> prevents flystrike, a very painful disease that can affect sheep. A settlement was reached, and PETA agreed to stop the boycott, while the wool industry agreed to seek alternatives to <b>mulesing.</b>|$|E
25|$|New {{strains of}} Merinos {{that do not}} require <b>mulesing</b> are being {{promoted}} in South Australia.|$|E
5000|$|Lamb marking is {{the term}} applied to the {{procedure}} of earmarking, castration and tail-docking of the lambs of domestic sheep. Vaccination is usually carried out then, too. Sheep are usually ear marked at approximately 3 months of age after lambing (birth). Lambs are castrated to prevent full development of reproductive organs and hormones. Ear marking is used to identify each lamb in the flock and tail-docking is usually carried out to prevent blowfly strike. At some stage, blow-flies lay their eggs within moist and warm areas (breech region) of the sheep. Then, the maggots grow and eat away the live flesh of the sheep. This causes great distress and pain for the lamb. Sometimes lambs are also <b>mulesed</b> (triangular cuts to the skin around the lamb's anus). This is also carried out for the same reason.|$|R
25|$|Proponents of <b>mulesing</b> {{are largely}} from Australia where severe and often fatal flystrike is common.|$|E
25|$|<b>Mulesing</b> is {{different}} from crutching. Crutching is the mechanical removal of wool around the tail, anus (and vulva in ewes) in breeds of sheep with woolly points where this is necessary. <b>Mulesing</b> is the removal of skin to provide permanent resistance to breech strike in Merino sheep. Other breeds tend to have less loose skin, and wool, {{so close to the}} tail and may have less dense wool.|$|E
25|$|<b>Mulesing</b> is {{the removal}} of strips of wool-bearing skin from around the breech (buttocks) of a sheep to prevent flystrike (myiasis).|$|E
25|$|<b>Mulesing</b> {{should be}} {{completed}} well before the flystrike season, or else chemical protection should be provided to reduce risk to the lambs and ewes.|$|E
25|$|Alternatives to <b>mulesing</b> {{must meet}} health {{standards}} {{for both the}} lamb and its handlers {{in addition to being}} safe for consumption as meat or textile.|$|E
25|$|Crutching {{has to be}} {{repeated}} at regular intervals as the wool grows continuously. Frequent crutching of Merinos reduces the incidence of flystrike, {{but not as much}} as <b>mulesing.</b>|$|E
25|$|Lambs {{that are}} {{slaughtered}} soon after weaning {{generally do not}} need <b>mulesing</b> {{because they can be}} protected by chemical treatment for the short time they are at risk.|$|E
25|$|Some European {{retailers}} {{have agreed to}} lift their ban on Australian merino wool if pain relief is used during <b>mulesing.</b> The {{retailers have}} not been named {{in an effort to}} avoid any backlash.|$|E
25|$|Australian {{interior}} furnishing wholesaler Instyle Contract Textiles endorses {{the cessation}} of <b>mulesing.</b> In early 2008, the company signed an exclusive worldwide agreement with The SRS Company to source wool from non-mulesed Merino sheep that have been bred specifically to be naturally resistant to flystrike.|$|E
25|$|Animal rights organisations {{including}} PETA {{are currently}} promoting {{a boycott of}} Australian, and all Merino wool, as a protest against the practice of <b>mulesing,</b> a procedure used to prevent the animals from becoming fly blown with maggots. In 2004, due to the worldwide attention, AWI proposed to phase out the practice {{by the end of}} year 2010; this promise was retracted in 2009.|$|E
25|$|While {{the lamb}} is under {{restraint}} (typically in a marking cradle), the wrinkled {{skin in the}} animal's breech (rump area) is cut away from the perianal region down {{to the top of}} the hindlimbs. Originally, the procedure was typically performed with modified wool-trimming metal shears, but now there are similar metal shears designed specifically for <b>mulesing.</b> In addition, the tail is docked and the remaining stump is sometimes skinned. The cuts are executed to avoid affecting underlying muscle tissue.|$|E
500|$|The Australian sheep {{industry}} {{is the only}} sector of the industry to receive international criticism for its practices. Sheep stations in Australia are cited in Animal Liberation, the seminal book of the animal rights movement, as the author's primary evidence in his argument against retaining sheep {{as a part of}} animal agriculture. The practice of <b>mulesing,</b> in which skin is cut away from an animal's perineal area to prevent cases of the fatal condition flystrike, has been condemned by animal rights groups such as PETA as being a [...] "painful and unnecessary" [...] process. [...] In response, a program of phasing out <b>mulesing</b> is currently being implemented, and some <b>mulesing</b> operations are being carried out with the use of anaesthetic. [...] The Animal Welfare Advisory Committee to the New Zealand Ministry of Agriculture Code of recommendations and minimum standards for the welfare of Sheep, considers <b>mulesing</b> a [...] "special technique" [...] which is performed on some Merino sheep at a small number of farms in New Zealand.|$|E
500|$|Common {{forms of}} {{preventive}} medication for sheep are vaccinations and treatments for parasites. Both {{external and internal}} parasites are the most prevalent malady in sheep, and are either fatal, or reduce the productivity of flocks. Worms {{are the most common}} internal parasites. They are ingested during grazing, incubate within the sheep, and are expelled through the digestive system (beginning the cycle again). Oral anti-parasitic medicines, known as drenches, are given to a flock to treat worms, sometimes after worm eggs in the feces has been counted to assess infestation levels. Afterwards, sheep may be moved to a new pasture to avoid ingesting the same parasites. [...] External sheep parasites include: lice (for different parts of the body), sheep keds, nose bots, sheep itch mites, and maggots. Keds are blood-sucking parasites that cause general malnutrition and decreased productivity, but are not fatal. Maggots are those of the bot fly and the blow-fly. Fly maggots cause the extremely destructive condition of flystrike. Flies lay their eggs in wounds or wet, manure-soiled wool; when the maggots hatch they burrow into a sheep's flesh, eventually causing death if untreated. In addition to other treatments, crutching (shearing wool from a sheep's rump) is a common preventive method. Some countries allow <b>mulesing,</b> a practice that involves stripping away the skin on the rump to prevent fly-strike, normally performed when the sheep is a lamb. [...] Nose bots are fly larvae that inhabit a sheep's sinuses, causing breathing difficulties and discomfort. Common signs are a discharge from the nasal passage, sneezing, and frantic movement such as head shaking. External parasites may be controlled through the use of backliners, sprays or immersive sheep dips.|$|E
2500|$|In 2008, <b>mulesing</b> {{once again}} became a topical issue in Sweden, with a {{documentary}} on <b>mulesing</b> shown on Swedish television. This was followed by allegations of bribery and intimidation by Australian government and wool industry officials; ...|$|E
2500|$|The Australian Wool Innovation (AWI) {{has pledged}} to phase out <b>mulesing</b> by 2010, but PETA has accused the Australian wool {{industry}} of trying to extend this deadline. On 27 July 2009, the Australian wool industry dumped its long-standing pledge to phase out <b>mulesing</b> {{by the end of}} 2010, a move that was harshly criticized by animal welfare groups and led to criticism by some farmers. The AWI maintains that pursuing a deadline approach to eliminating <b>mulesing</b> was not based on [...] "sound health and welfare science" [...] and risked a serious deterioration in the welfare of sheep. Alternative methods of <b>mulesing,</b> such as using clips and intradermals, were [...] "not sufficiently developed to support a wholesale cessation of the procedure in 2010", AWI said.|$|E
2500|$|In Australia, <b>mulesing</b> of Merino sheep is {{a common}} {{practice}} to {{reduce the incidence of}} flystrike. It has been attacked by animal rights and animal welfare activists, with PETA [...] running a campaign against the practice in 2004. The PETA campaign targeted U.S. consumers by using graphic billboards in New York City. PETA threatened U.S. manufacturers with television advertisements showing their companies' support of <b>mulesing.</b> Fashion retailers including Abercrombie & Fitch Co., Gap Inc and Nordstrom and George (UK) stopped stocking Australian Merino wool products.|$|E
2500|$|Originally, <b>mulesing</b> {{was carried}} out on sheep after they were weaned because it was {{considered}} [...] "too rough" [...] for lambs. However, lambs appear {{to cope with the}} procedure better than older sheep as the actual area of skin fold removed on young lambs is quite small, and they are protected for an extra year as well. For young lambs older than two months, the discomfort period seems to last for approximately two weeks by which time healing is almost, if not entirely, complete. Current codes of practice ban <b>mulesing</b> for sheep over 12 months of age.|$|E
2500|$|Surgical {{procedures}} are also {{performed in the}} sheep industry to help prevention, {{one of which is}} controversial due to the invasive nature. Tail docking to the correct length will reduce the amount of staining in the breech area due to urine and fecal matter. Pizzle dropping is a procedure that severs the connective tissue between the penis and the body. Not only does it reduce the incidence of relentless pizzle rot in sheep, but it decreases the amount of urine staining on the belly of the sheep. This procedure can greatly reduce the occurrence of flystrike on the belly area. <b>Mulesing</b> is an animal husbandry procedure that has currently faced much opposition throughout its practice. Large scissors are used to cut off the backs of the sheep's thigh region. This procedure is usually carried out by untrained farmers without the use of any analgesia. It flattens out the wrinkles around the breech of the sheep, reducing the places where moisture collects affecting the skin of the sheep resulting in liquid protein exudate which is attractive to Lucilia cuprina. <b>Mulesing</b> also increases the amount of bare skin around the vulva during the healing process, reducing urine staining and amount of flystrike. This procedure does cause pain, but since it is considered the most effective method to prevent breech strike, it is seemingly justifiable. <b>Mulesing</b> is as effective as breeding sheep for less wrinkle (score 2) which are resistant to flystrike. <b>Mulesing</b> is a good prevention until breeding can remove the need for the operation in flystrike prevention ...|$|E
2500|$|The Animal Welfare Advisory Committee to the New Zealand Ministry of Agriculture Code of {{recommendations}} and minimum {{standards for the}} welfare of Sheep, considers <b>mulesing</b> a [...] "special technique" [...] which is performed on some Merino sheep at a small number of farms in New Zealand.|$|E
2500|$|Present (2011) {{approach}} of AWI {{is that it}} [...] "supports all woolgrowers in their choice of best practice animal health and hygiene in flystrike control", including the practice of <b>mulesing</b> without pain relief, but aims to provide animal welfare improvements such as pain relief and antiseptics.|$|E
2500|$|In these Merino flocks, {{the sheep}} are plainer than the plain-bodied (A class) Merino ewes and {{therefore}} more resistant to flystrike. The rams and semen from these studs are used in over 3,000 of the 45,000 Merino farms in Australia. [...] Using breeding principles, wrinkle-skinned Merino flocks which require <b>mulesing</b> have been transformed into plain-bodied and mules-free flocks within five years.|$|E
2500|$|In October 2004, American fashion {{retailer}} Abercrombie & Fitch Co. {{responded to}} pressure from PETA to boycott Australian merino wool {{due in part to}} the use of <b>mulesing</b> in Australia. The National Farmers' Federation responded by stating [...] "Abercrombie and Fitch does not use Australian wool". Then, in December 2008, one of the world's largest retailers, Liz Claiborne, (in which PETA is a shareholder) banned the use of Australian Merino wool in its products in opposition to the <b>mulesing</b> practice, at the time an Australian Wool Innovations spokesman said [...] "the company did not purchase any Australian wool". In June 2009, British department store chain John Lewis joined the wool boycott. The international fashion retailer New Look also refuses to stock products made from Australian Merino wool. The campaign by PETA also seeks to draw attention to Australia's live sheep export trade. PETA's campaign has hurt the Australian wool industry with several American and European clothing retailers agreeing to the boycott.|$|E
2500|$|The New South Wales Department of Primary Industries {{states in}} the Standard Operating Procedures that, [...] "While the {{operation}} causes some pain, no pre or post operative pain relief measures are used". Antiseptics, anaesthesia and painkillers are not required by Australian law during or after the procedure but are often applied, as the procedure {{is known to be}} painful to the animal. Products have been approved for pain relief during the procedure, including Tri-Solfen. The minor use permit for Tri-Solfen makes the product available for use by both veterinarians and sheep industry employees, such as <b>mulesing</b> contractors and graziers.|$|E
2500|$|The {{controversy}} reignited after {{a television}} programme aired in Sweden. This programme alleged that a lobbying consultant, Kevin Craig, acting {{on behalf of}} the Australian Wool and Sheep Industry Taskforce offered a Swedish activist a free trip to Australia if the activist agreed not to go on camera nor do an interview. As a consequence, all clothing manufacturers and retailers in Sweden banned the purchase of wool from sheep that have been mulesed. [...] Since then, the Swedish Agriculture Minister, Eskil Erlandsson, has said that [...] "he was satisfied that Australia appeared to be responding to international concerns about <b>mulesing</b> and that bans or boycotts were not necessary". [...] "But in the long run we hope {{there is going to be}} a final end to all sorts of mulesing." ...|$|E
50|$|The company {{prohibits the}} {{practice}} of <b>mulesing,</b> which includes the traditional surgical method and the clips method. <b>Mulesing</b> removes strips of skin around the tail to prevent the fly-strike disease, Myiasis. In order to avoid <b>mulesing,</b> sheep that produce Icebreaker merino may be treated through medicines and chemicals for the disease.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Mulesing</b> is a {{controversial}} practice. The National Farmers Federation of Australia says that [...] "mulesing {{remains the most}} effective practical way to eliminate the risk of 'flystrike' in sheep" [...] and that [...] "without <b>mulesing</b> up to 3,000,000 sheep a year could die a slow and agonising death from flystrike". The Australian Veterinary Association (AVA) [...] "recognises the welfare implications of <b>mulesing</b> of sheep. However, {{in the absence of}} more humane alternatives for preventing breech strike, the AVA accepts that the practice of <b>mulesing</b> should continue as a sheep husbandry procedure". The AVA also supports the use of analgesics and the accreditation of <b>mulesing</b> practitioners. The Australian Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals accepts <b>mulesing</b> when the risk of flystrike is very high, when it is done properly, and even then only as a last resort. The animal rights organisation PETA strongly opposes <b>mulesing,</b> says the practice is cruel and painful, and that more humane alternatives exist, and claim that sheep can be spared maggot infestation through more humane methods, including special diets and spray washing.|$|E
