50|$|A <b>carpet</b> <b>sweeper</b> is a <b>mechanical</b> {{device for}} the {{cleaning}} of carpets. They were popular before {{the introduction of}} the vacuum cleaner and have been largely superseded by them. However, they continue to be used in many home and commercial applications because they are lightweight and quiet, enabling users to quickly clean small messes up from the floor without disturbing patrons, patients, babies and pets. (A very early appearance in film occurs in the 1914 Charlie Chaplin film Laughing Gas, where Chaplin uses it to clean the waiting-room floor of a dentist.) <b>Carpet</b> <b>sweepers</b> are still available {{in many parts of the}} world.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>carpet</b> <b>sweeper</b> {{typically}} {{consists of}} a small box. The base of the box has rollers and brushes, connected by a belt or gears. There is also a container for dirt. The arrangement is such that, when pushed along a floor, the rollers turn and force the brushes to rotate. The brushes sweep dirt and dust from the floor into the container. <b>Carpet</b> <b>sweepers</b> frequently have a height adjustment {{that enables them to}} work on different lengths of carpet, or bare floors. The sweeper usually has a long handle {{so that it can be}} pushed without bending over.|$|R
50|$|A similar {{model was}} {{constructed}} by Melville R. Bissell of Grand Rapids, Michigan in 1876, who also manufactured <b>carpet</b> <b>sweepers.</b> The company later added portable vacuum cleaners to its line of cleaning tools.|$|R
5000|$|Entwisle & Kenyon {{started making}} washing {{machines}} around 1875, and also manufactured mangles. While {{one of the}} company's representatives, Richard Walter Kenyon, was in the United States in 1882 to source wooden blocks for mangles, he visited a <b>carpet</b> <b>sweeper</b> factory in Chicago, and saw {{the potential for the}} product, which was already popular in the US, in the UK. Kenyon designed the first Ewbank branded <b>carpet</b> <b>sweeper,</b> which went on sale in 1889. It became the most popular product of its type in Britain, where carpet sweeping became known as [...] "ewbanking". The 'Ewbank' name came from the Ewbank area of Blackburn where the factory was located.|$|R

Years later at 19 she married Melville R. Bissell and became a joint partner in their crockery and china business. The Bissell Sweeper website recounts that Mrs. Bissell complained to her husband about sawdust that collected in their carpets and was difficult to remove, whereupon he made great improvements to a new invention called the <b>carpet</b> <b>sweeper.</b> When he invented the Bissell <b>carpet</b> <b>sweeper</b> in 1876, Anna Bissell became a salesperson traveling from town to town selling the sweeper for $1.50.|$|R

50|$|The first upright {{vacuum cleaner}} was invented in June 1908 by Canton, Ohio {{department}} store janitor and occasional inventor James Murray Spangler (1848-1915). Spangler was an asthmatic, and suspecting the <b>carpet</b> <b>sweeper</b> he was using at work {{was the cause of}} his ailment, he created a basic suction-sweeper by mounting an electric fan motor on a Bissell brand <b>carpet</b> <b>sweeper</b> then adding a soap box and a broom handle. After refining the design and obtaining a patent for the Electric Suction Sweeper he set about producing it himself, assisted by his son, who helped him assemble the machines, and his daughter, who assembled the dust bags. Production was slow, just two to three machines completed a week.|$|R
50|$|The {{vacuum cleaner}} {{evolved from the}} <b>carpet</b> <b>sweeper</b> via manual vacuum cleaners.

50|$|Following the Panic of 1873, Bissell {{began working}} on a <b>carpet</b> <b>sweeper.</b> In 1876 Bissell {{patented}} a sweeper with a central brush, rubber wheels, and other improvements on vacuum technology.

50|$|Melville Bissell {{developed}} an early carpet sweeping machine {{to aid in}} cleaning the crockery shop {{he and his wife}} Anna owned and operated. The device was patented as the Bissell <b>Carpet</b> <b>Sweeper</b> in 1876. In 1883 Bissell built the company's first manufacturing plant in Grand Rapids.

50|$|Although {{vacuum cleaner}} {{and the short}} form vacuum are neutral names, in some {{countries}} (UK, Ireland) hoover is used instead as a genericized trademark, and as a verb.

5000|$|In 1860 a <b>carpet</b> <b>sweeper</b> {{was invented}} by Daniel Hess of West Union, Iowa that {{gathered}} dust with a rotating brush and a bellows for generating suction.Another early model (1869) was the [...] "Whirlwind", invented in Chicago in 1868 by Ives W. McGaffey. The bulky device worked with a belt driven fan cranked by hand that made it awkward to operate, although it was commercially marketed with mixed success.|$|R
50|$|He {{learned from}} the {{hardware}} store owner of a contest offering $USD50 (or about $ in today's dollars) to the winner who designed the best ad for a Bissell <b>carpet</b> <b>sweeper</b> as a Christmas present. He submitted an ad, one of 1,433 entries, and won the contest. One of the three judges for the Bissell <b>carpet</b> <b>sweeper</b> advertising contest was Charles Austin Bates, an important early copywriter and New York ad agency founder and owner. Calkin's winning ad impressed Bates. In the fall of 1891, against his parents' wishes, Calkins set out for New York {{the first time at}} age 23. He found work writing copy for a small print shop for a while, but returned home after less than a year, unsuccessful. He moved back into his parents' home where he worked various jobs as a printer, reporter, columnist, advertising man, and publisher. Unable to make a living, he finally secured a job as an advertising manager in a department store in Peoria, Illinois for $USD19.50 (or about $ today), per week.|$|R
50|$|After her husband’s {{death in}} 1889, Bissell became chief {{executive}} officer of the company. She established new guidelines on trademarks and patents and moved Bissell <b>carpet</b> <b>sweepers</b> into the international market. By 1899 she had created the largest organization of its kind in the world. As president of the corporation and chairman of the board, Bissell introduced progressive labor policies including workman’s compensation and pension plans long before these practices were widespread in industry.|$|R
