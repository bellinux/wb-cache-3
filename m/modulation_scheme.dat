A general spectral formula for stationary randomized <b>modulation</b> <b>schemes</b> is presented, and specialized to several <b>modulation</b> <b>schemes</b> of practical interest for DC/DC converters.

In the process, we present results for several <b>modulation</b> <b>schemes</b> that {{have been reported in}} the literature without analytical explanations. Experimental verifications of some of our analytical results are presented. We formulate narrow-band and wide-band synthesis problems in randomized modulation, and solve them numerically.

2500|$|A simple example: A useful symbol {{duration}} TU = 1ms {{would require}} a sub-carrier spacing of [...] (or an integer multiple of that) for orthogonality. N = 1,000 sub-carriers {{would result in a}} total passband bandwidth of NΔf = 1MHz. For this symbol time, the required bandwidth in theory according to Nyquist is [...] (half of the achieved bandwidth required by our scheme), where R is the bit rate and where N = 1,000 samples per symbol by FFT. If a guard interval is applied (see below), Nyquist bandwidth requirement would be even lower. The FFT would result in N = 1,000 samples per symbol. If no guard interval was applied, this would result in a base band complex valued signal with a sample rate of 1MHz, which {{would require a}} baseband bandwidth of 0.5MHz according to Nyquist. However, the passband RF signal is produced by multiplying the baseband signal with a carrier waveform (i.e., double-sideband quadrature amplitude-modulation) resulting in a passband bandwidth of 1MHz. A single-side band (SSB) or vestigial sideband (VSB) <b>modulation</b> <b>scheme</b> would achieve almost half that bandwidth for the same symbol rate (i.e., twice as high spectral efficiency for the same symbol alphabet length). It is however more sensitive to multipath interference.|$|E
