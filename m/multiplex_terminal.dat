40|$|Savanna {{ecosystems}} {{are subject to}} desertification and bush encroachment, which reduce the carrying capacity for wildlife and livestock. Bush thinning is a management approach that can, at least temporarily, restore grasslands and raise the grazing value of the land. In this study we examined the soil microbial communities under bush and grass in Namibia. We analyzed the soil through a chronosequence where bush was thinned at 9, 5, or 3 years before sampling. Soil microbial biomass, the biomass of specific taxonomic groups, and overall microbial community structure was determined by phospholipid fatty acid analysis, while the community structure of Bacteria, Archaea, and fungi was determined by <b>multiplex</b> <b>terminal</b> {{restriction fragment length polymorphism}} analysis. Soil under bush had higher pH, C, N, and microbial biomass than under grass, and the microbial community structure was also altered under bush compared to grass. A major disturbance to the ecosystem, bush thinning, resulted in an altered microbial community structure compared to control plots, but the magnitude of this perturbation gradually declined with time. Community structure was primarily driven by pH, C, and N, while vegetation type, bush thinning, and time since bush thinning were of secondary importance...|$|E
40|$|A <b>multiplex</b> <b>terminal</b> {{restriction}} fragment length polymorphism (M-TRFLP) fingerprinting method {{was developed and}} validated for simultaneous analysis of the diversity and community structure of two or more microbial taxa (up to four taxa). The reproducibility and robustness of the method were examined using soil samples collected from different habitats. DNA was PCR amplified separately from soil samples using individual taxon-specific primers for bacteria, archaea, and fungi. The same samples were also subjected to a multiplex PCR with the primers for all three taxa. The terminal {{restriction fragment}} length polymorphism profiles generated for the two sets of PCR products were almost identical {{not only in terms of}} the presence of peaks but also in terms of the relative peak intensity. The M-TRFLP method was then used to investigate rhizosphere bacterial, fungal, and rhizobial/agrobacterial communities associated with the dwarf shrub Calluna vulgaris growing in either open moorland, a mature pine forest, or a transition zone between these two habitats containing naturally regenerating pine trees. Rhizosphere microbial communities associated with Vaccinium myrtillus collected from the native pine forest were also investigated. In this study, individual PCR products from the three taxa were also pooled before restriction digestion and fragment size analysis. The terminal {{restriction fragment length polymorphism}} profiles obtained with PCR products amplified individually and with multiplexed and pooled PCR products were found to be consistent with each other in terms of the number, position, and relative intensity of peaks. The results presented here confirm that M-TRFLP analysis is a highly reproducible and robust molecular tool for simultaneous investigation of multiple taxa, which allows more complete and higher resolution of microbial communities to be obtained more rapidly and economically...|$|E
40|$|Proteolysis is an {{irreversible}} {{post-translational modification}} that affects intra- and intercellular communication by modulating {{the activity of}} bioactive mediators. Key to understanding protease function is the system-wide identification of cleavage events and their dynamics in physiological contexts. Despite recent advances in mass spectrometry-based proteomics for high-throughput substrate screening, current approaches suffer from high false positive rates and only capture single states of protease activity. Here, we present a workflow based on <b>multiplexed</b> <b>Terminal</b> Amine Isotopic Labeling of Substrates (TAILS) for time-resolved substrate degradomics in complex proteomes. This approach significantly enhances confidence in substrate identification and categorizes cleavage events by specificity and structural accessibility of the cleavage site. We demonstrate concomitant quantification of cleavage site spanning peptides and neo-N and/or neo-C termini to estimate relative ratios of non-cleaved and cleaved forms of substrate proteins. By applying this strategy to dissect the matrix metalloproteinase 10 (MMP 10) substrate degradome in fibroblast secretomes, we identified the extracellular matrix protein ADAMTS-like protein 1 (ADAMTSL 1) as a direct MMP 10 substrate and revealed MMP 10 -dependent ectodomain shedding of platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRα) as well as sequential processing of type I collagen. The data have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium with identifier PXD 000503...|$|R

On each virtual terminal, a getty process is run, which in turn runs /bin/login to authenticate a user. After authentication, a command shell will be run.

50|$|The {{first public}} dial-in {{networks}} used asynchronous TTY terminal protocols {{to reach a}} concentrator operated in the public network. Some networks, such as CompuServe, used X.25 to <b>multiplex</b> the <b>terminal</b> sessions into their packet-switched backbones, while others, such as Tymnet, used proprietary protocols. In 1979, CompuServe became the first service to offer electronic mail capabilities and technical support to personal computer users. The company broke new ground again in 1980 as the first to offer real-time chat with its CB Simulator. Other major dial-in networks were America Online (AOL) and Prodigy that also provided communications, content, and entertainment features. Many bulletin board system (BBS) networks also provided on-line access, such as FidoNet which was popular amongst hobbyist computer users, many of them hackers and amateur radio operators.|$|R

A reconfigurable narrow-band architecture is introduced that can best cope with the main challenges of the UWB receivers: broadband impedance matching and high out-of-band linearity. Simulation results show that linearity requirements can be achieved with sizeable margin...|$|R

40|$|Abstracf-We {{consider}} {{a population of}} terminals communicating with a central station over a packet-switched multiple-access radio channel. The performance of {{carrier sense multiple access}} (CSMA) [l] used as a method for <b>multiplexing</b> these <b>terminals</b> is highly de-pendent on the ability of each terminal to sense the carrier of any other transmission on the channel. Many situations exist in which some terminals are “hidden ” from each other (either because they are out-of-sight or out-of-range). In this paper we show that the existence of hidden terminals significantly degrades the performance of CSMA. Furthermore, we introduce and analyze the busy-tone multiple-access (BTMA) mode as a natural extension of CSMA to eliminate the hidden-terminal problem. Numerical results giving the bandwidth utilization and packet delays are shown, illustrating that BTMA with hidden terminals performs almost as well as CSMA without hidden terminals. I...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a scheduling scheme for a FLO based advanced TDMA system to enable service <b>multiplexing</b> from user <b>terminals.</b> The FLO specifications allows different traffic types to use appropriate transport formats to meet QoS requirements of each class of traffic. Service multiplexing {{can be achieved}} by selecting appropriate transport formats for each traffic class and then combining them in a single packet and transmitting over a single slot of a TDMA air interface. The paper introduces a scheduling scheme known as LQP which can offer higher throughput for using a FLO based air interface. The paper presents some initial simulation results obtained from an OPNET based simulation model...|$|R
40|$|This thesis investigates multi-antenna {{techniques}} {{within the}} context of distributed antenna and fixed relay networks. Such antenna and network architectures result in significant performance enhancements even in networks where the wireless terminals have only a single antenna. Relaying, the use of intermediate nodes to help transmission from source to destination, has emerged as one paradigm shift in system deployment. Infrastructure-based relays are usually deployed by the service providers for coverage extension. The thesis investigates cooperative relaying to extend this paradigm even further. By exploiting the broadcast nature of wireless channels, fixed relay nodes are engaged in two-hop cooperative protocols as means for removing the burden of multiple antennas on wireless terminals, thus, providing end-toend (E 2 E) spatial diversity and network <b>multiplexing</b> benefits to <b>terminals</b> that are otherwise antenna-limited...|$|R
40|$|The {{concept of}} a fully meshed network of briefcase-sized {{terminals}} is presented for personal communications over Ka-band satellite transponders. In this concept, undesirable double-hop delays are avoided for voice communications. The bandwidth and power resources of the transponder are efficiently shared by users in a simple demand-assigned manner via code-division multiple access (CDMA). Voice, data, and facsimile are statistically <b>multiplexed</b> at each <b>terminal.</b> In order to minimize terminal costs, frequency-precorrected, and level-preadjusted continuous-wave tones are sent from the central network control station in each beam so that the terminals in each down-link beam can use these pilots as references for antenna acquisition and tracking, as reliable frequency sources, and as indicators of signal fade for up-link power control (ULPC). The potential CDMA 'near-far' problem due to up-link fades is mitigated by using ULPC. Quasi-burst mode transmission is employed to minimize the potential clock and pseudorandom number code synchronization...|$|R
40|$|The 3 G- 324 M is a {{derivative}} of the ITU-T H. 324 standard which is for {{low bit rate}} multimedia communication. H. 324 and several mobile specific annexes are usually referred to as H. 324 M (M stands for mobile). Then the 3 GPP adopted the H. 324 M with some modifications in codecs and error handling requirements to create the 3 G- 324 M standard. In order to support enhanced and delay sensitive video services, 3 G video phones as well as network equipments are required to support 3 G- 324 M. In 3 G- 324 M, ITU-T H. 223 defines the data transmission multiplexing protocol. We present an efficient approach for data transmission <b>multiplexing</b> of mobile <b>terminals</b> in this article. The original complicated nested structures of multiplex descriptor are serialized into simple linked list. As a result, we have achieved efficient implementations for both Intel Pentium Processor and ARM Processor, which proved the feasibility of our approach. The performance of our implementation is also satisfactory. 1...|$|R
