Results were as follows: 1) Serum total fat and total cholesterol concentration were lower in the late <b>maturing</b> group than in the early at 12 weeks of age, but there has not been seen any difference of their constituents between the late <b>maturing</b> group at 15 weeks of age and the early <b>maturing</b> at 12 weeks of age. 2) Serum lecithin concentration was markedly higher in the late <b>maturing</b> group than in the early <b>maturing</b> at 12 weeks of age and thereafter the late <b>maturing</b> group remained fairy constant level during growth. 3) Serum alkaline phosphatase concentration was markedly lower in the late <b>maturing</b> group than in the early <b>maturing</b> at 12 weeks of age and thereafter the late <b>maturing</b> group remained fairy constant level during growth. From these results, it seemed that there were highly significant differences between serum lecithin and alkaline phosphatase concentration of the early and the late <b>maturing</b> groups, and that their constituents might be used as an efficient index to predict gaining ability in immature animals...|$|R
40|$|Consumer {{trust in}} the food {{industry}} is heavily reliant upon accurate labelling of meat products. As such, methods which can verify whether meat is correctly labelled are of great value to producers, retailers, and consumers. This paper illustrates two approaches to classify between, fresh and frozen thawed, and in a novel manner <b>matured</b> and <b>matured</b> frozen-thawed, as well as fresh and <b>matured</b> beef using the 500 - 1010 nm waveband, captured using hyperspectral imaging, and CIELAB measurements. The results show successful classification based upon CIELAB between 1) fresh and frozen-thawed (CCR = 0. 93), and 2) fresh and <b>matured</b> (CCR = 0. 92). With successful classification between <b>matured</b> and <b>matured</b> frozen-thawed beef using the entire spectral range (CCR = 1. 00).

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} verify the effects of {{cryoprotectant}} and Open Pulled Straw (OPS) vitrification on ultrastructural changes in bovine oocytes. In experiment 1, the cryoprotectant exposure was analyzed by distributing immature and <b>matured</b> cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs) in groups: control immature, immature and exposed to one vitrification solution (IVS 1), immatured and exposed to two vitrification solutions (IVS 1 - 2), <b>matured</b> and exposed to one vitrification solution (MVS 1), <b>matured</b> and exposed to two vitrification solutions (MVS 1 - 2), control <b>matured,</b> IVS 1 post in vitro maturation (IVS 1 post IVM) and IVS 1 - 2 post in vitro maturation (IVS 1 - 2 post IVM). In experiment 2, immature and <b>matured</b> COCs were distributed in: control and vitrified by OPS using VS 1 - 2. Sample COCs from both experiments were evaluated for mitochondrial distribution, nuclear lamins (immature COCs) and meiotic spindle (<b>matured</b> COCs). In both experiments, COCs were in vitro <b>matured</b> and fertilized. In experiment I, nuclear lamins in immature COCs exhibited higher proportion of structures with irregular shape when treated with VS 1 and VS 1 - 2. Immature and <b>matured</b> COCs treated with VS 1 - 2, and <b>matured</b> COCs treated with VS 1 had lower (P 0. 05). The cleavage rate was higher (P < 0. 05) in <b>matured</b> vitrified than immature vitrified group (19 % vs. 8 %). In conclusion, immature COCs were more tolerant to cryoprotectant exposure. However, <b>matured</b> oocytes showed better embryo development (cleavage) after vitrification...|$|R

5|$|EFS {{has mostly}} a repressive role of EFS on {{processes}} {{associated with the}} activation of <b>mature</b> T-cells, including IL-2 pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion and IL-2-dependent clonal expansion of T cells. Upon T-cell receptor (TCR) stimulation, EFS dephosphorylation and release of the SRC family kinase FYN and phospholipase C-γ normally lead to self-limitation of the immune response. Consistent with this mechanism, EFS overexpression in T cell-derived cell lines decreased IL-2 concentration in supernatants in response to TCR stimulation, while T cells derived from mice lacking EFS gene showed increased IL-2 production. A dual role of EFS in <b>mature</b> T cells function has been proposed because both overexpression and siRNA knockdown of this protein in cell models resulted in decreased transcriptional activation of IL-2 dependent promoters following TCR stimulation.|$|E

The definitive publisher-authenticated version Oxford University Press, Human Reproduction, 17 (2), 2002, 420 - 425 is available online at: [URL] authorBACKGROUND: The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate the chromosomal complement and developmental potential of in-vitro <b>matured</b> murine oocytes following ICSI by human sperm. METHODS: Heterologous ICSI fertilization between mouse oocytes and human sperm was employed in order to overcome the reduced fertilization rates observed after conventional IVF due to zona hardening during in-vitro maturation, and to assess separately maternal and paternal chromosome complements. Cytogenetic analyses were performed in four types of oocytes: (I) in-vitro <b>matured</b> metaphase II (MII) oocytes; (ii) in-vivo <b>matured</b> MII oocytes; (iii) in-vitro <b>matured</b> oocytes after ICSI; (iv) in-vivo <b>matured</b> oocytes after ICSI. RESULTS: Activation rates after ICSI of in-vitro <b>matured</b> oocytes was lower than that of in-vivo <b>matured</b> oocytes (69. 9 versus 97. 2 %, P < 0. 01), and premature chromosomal condensation was only observed in in-vitro <b>matured</b> oocytes. However, there were no significant differences in developmental rates after successful activation between in-vivo and in-vitro <b>matured</b> ICSI oocytes (69. 7 versus 76. 6 %). The incidences of aneuploidy and structural aberrations were similar between the ICSI embryos and non-ICSI (MII) oocytes. Furthermore, the frequency of chromosomal aberrations was not associated with in-vitro or in-vivo maturation. Similar analyses of paternal chromosomes indicated that there were no significant differences in the incidence of chromosomal aberrations between the embryos derived from in-vitro and in-vivo <b>matured</b> oocytes. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that in-vitro <b>matured</b> oocytes following ICSI do not lead to an increase in the frequency of aneuploidy and structural aberrations when human sperm are injected into mouse oocytes...|$|R

The objective {{of this research was}} to develop early {{varieties of}} soybean with extended days to flowering while keeping the days from flowering to maturity intact.

Conventional and modified single seed descent methods were used to select for late flowering but early <b>maturing</b> relative to the early <b>maturing</b> parents. Eleven selected lines were tested for three seasons using two early <b>maturing</b> parents and SJ 5, a medium <b>maturing</b> variety, as the standard check and it was found that four lines, C- 3108, M- 3213, M- 3215, and M- 3217, outyielded both early parents and the standard check, SJ 5. These lines gave more days to flowering than the early <b>maturing</b> parental checks, but the days from flowering to maturity were similar to the early checks. The correlation between the yield with days to maturity was not important but with days to flowering it was significant.
