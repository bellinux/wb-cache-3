40|$|A {{method and}} {{apparatus}} for performing simultaneous multi-point measurements of multiple velocity components in a gas flow is described. Pulses of laser light are directed to a measurement region of unseeded gas to produce Rayleigh or <b>Mie</b> <b>scattered</b> {{light in a}} plurality of directions. The Rayleigh or <b>Mie</b> <b>scattered</b> light is collected from multiple directions and combined in a single collimated light beam. The Rayleigh or <b>Mie</b> <b>scattered</b> light is then mixed together with a reference laser light before it is passed through a single planar Fabry-Perot interferometer for spectral analysis. At {{the output of the}} interferometer, a high-sensitivity CCD camera images the interference fringe pattern. This pattern contains the spectral and spatial information from both the Rayleigh scattered light and the reference laser light. Interferogram processing software extracts and analyzes spectral profiles to determine the velocity components of the gas flow at multiple points in the measurement region. The Rayleigh light rejected by the interferometer is recirculated to increase the accuracy and the applicability of the method for measurements at high temperatures without requiring an increase in the laser energy...|$|R
50|$|The Rayleigh {{scattering}} model {{breaks down}} when the particle size becomes larger than around 10% of the wavelength of the incident radiation. In the case of particles with dimensions greater than this, <b>Mie's</b> <b>scattering</b> model {{can be used to}} find the intensity of the scattered radiation. The intensity of <b>Mie</b> <b>scattered</b> radiation is given by the summation of an infinite series of terms rather than by a simple mathematical expression. It can be shown, however, that scattering in this range of particle sizes differs from Rayleigh scattering in several respects: it is roughly independent of wavelength and it is larger in the forward direction than in the reverse direction. The greater the particle size, the more of the light is scattered in the forward direction.|$|R

25|$|A {{variety of}} issues degrade the quality of HPIV results. The first class of issues {{involves}} the reconstruction itself. In holography, the object wave of a particle is typically assumed to be spherical; however, due to <b>Mie</b> <b>scattering</b> theory, this wave is a complex shape which can distort the reconstructed particle. Another issue {{is the presence of}} substantial speckle noise which lowers the overall signal-to-noise ratio of particle images. This effect is of greater concern for in-line holographic systems because the reference beam is propagated through the volume along with the scattered object beam. Noise can also be introduced through impurities in the scattering medium, such as temperature variations and window blemishes. Because holography requires coherent imaging, these effects are much more severe than traditional imaging conditions. The combination of these factors increases the complexity of the correlation process. In particular, the speckle noise in an HPIV recording often prevents traditional image-based correlation methods from being used. Instead, single particle identification and correlation are implemented, which set limits on particle number density. A more comprehensive outline of these error sources is given in Meng et al.|$|E

25|$|Refractive {{processes}} {{take place}} in the physical optics limit, where the wavelength of light is similar to other distances, as a kind of scattering. The simplest type of scattering is Thomson scattering which occurs when electromagnetic waves are deflected by single particles. In the limit of Thomson scattering, in which the wavelike nature of light is evident, light is dispersed independent of the frequency, in contrast to Compton scattering which is frequency-dependent and strictly a quantum mechanical process, involving the nature of light as particles. In a statistical sense, elastic scattering of light by numerous particles much smaller than the wavelength of the light is a process known as Rayleigh scattering while the similar process for scattering by particles that are similar or larger in wavelength is known as <b>Mie</b> <b>scattering</b> with the Tyndall effect being a commonly observed result. A small proportion of light scattering from atoms or molecules may undergo Raman scattering, wherein the frequency changes due to excitation of the atoms and molecules. Brillouin scattering occurs when the frequency of light changes due to local changes with time and movements of a dense material.|$|E

[...] Another speculation (the Vester-Ulbricht hypothesis) suggests that fundamental chirality of physical processes such as that of the beta decay (see Parity violation) leads to slightly different half-lives of biologically relevant molecules.

40|$|The {{combination}} of planar Doppler velocimetry (PDV) and FRS offers a promising way to obtain simultaneously 3 component velocity {{in a plane}} and corresponding scalar temperature maps. Implementation wise the two techniques are closely related since they both make use of a molecular absorption filter. This {{makes it possible to}} combine the necessary equipment using a single laser to illuminate a plane of interest that is observed simultaneously by multiple viewing directions. While PDV determines the frequency shift utilizing an absorption measurement with the laser light stabilized on the slope of an iodine line FRS measures the residual light passing through the molecular filter with the laser frequency tuned to the absorption minimum. The main challenge arises from the fact that PDV relies on the scattered light by micron-sized particles added to the flow. The intensity of this <b>Mie</b> <b>scattered</b> light is orders of magnitude higher than the light scattered by molecules of the gas flow itself known as Rayleigh scattering. In {{order to be able to}} record both signals both simultaneously but separately two iodine cells with different operation conditions were used for each camera system. The necessary criteria for successful measurements is the sufficient suppression of the <b>Mie</b> <b>scattered</b> light by the FRS camera while maintaining a proper dynamic range for the Doppler shifted light recorded by the PDV camera system. The combined PDV – FRS system was optimized by arranging the observation directions for the velocity and temperature measurements separately. An evaluation of the combined system was performed with an analysis of measurements taken on a hot free jet. Although the PDV velocity data agree reasonably with the calculated value the performance of FRS system suffered from technical problems...|$|R

2500|$|The {{particles}} are typically of a diameter {{in the order}} of 10 to 100 micrometers. [...] As for sizing, the particles should be small enough so that response time of the particles to the motion of the fluid is reasonably short to accurately follow the flow, yet large enough to scatter a significant quantity of the incident laser light. [...] For some experiments involving combustion, seeding particle size may be smaller, {{in the order of}} 1 micrometer, to avoid the quenching effect that the inert particles may have on flames. [...] Due to the small size of the particles, the particles motion is dominated by stokes drag and settling or rising affects. [...] In a model where {{particles are}} modeled as spherical (microspheres) at a very low Reynolds number, the ability of the particles to follow the fluid's flow is inversely proportional to the difference in density between the particles and the fluid, and also inversely proportional to the square of their diameter. [...] The scattered light from the particles is dominated by <b>Mie</b> <b>scattering</b> and so is also proportional to the square of the particles' diameters.
