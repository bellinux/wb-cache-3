5|$|Each of {{the seven}} books is set {{over the course of}} one school year. Harry struggles with the {{problems}} he encounters, and dealing with them often involves the need to violate some school rules. If students are caught breaking rules, they are often disciplined by Hogwarts professors. The stories reach their climax in the summer term, near or just after final exams, when events escalate far beyond in-school squabbles and struggles, and Harry must confront either Voldemort or one of his followers, the Death Eaters, with the stakes a <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> and death – a point underlined, as the series progresses, by characters being killed in each of the final four books. In the aftermath, he learns important lessons through exposition and discussions with head teacher and mentor Albus Dumbledore. The only exception to this school-centred setting is the final novel, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, in which Harry and his friends {{spend most of their time}} away from Hogwarts, and only return there to face Voldemort at the dénouement.|$|E

He had one serious advantage – the Italian cardinals nominated by his uncle Paul remained loyal to him. He favoured Carpi and Gonzaga for pope. Although his uncle was an enemy of the Spanish, and encouraged France, Carlo decided to ally himself with the Spanish party.|$|E

After winning a number of battles in Peru, Santa Cruz reorganized that country into two autonomous states—the Republic of North Peru and the Republic of South Peru—and joined them with Bolivia in the Peru-Bolivia Confederation with himself as Supreme protector.|$|E
