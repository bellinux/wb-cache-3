25|$|With a {{subscriber}} base of {{more than}} 929 million, the Mobile telecommunications system in India is the second {{largest in the world}} and it was thrown open to private players in the 1990s. GSM was comfortably maintaining its position as the dominant mobile technology with 80% of the <b>mobile</b> <b>subscriber</b> market, but CDMA seemed to have stabilised its market share at 20% for the time being. By May 2012 the country had 929 million mobile subscribers, up from 350 million just 40 months earlier. The mobile market was continuing to expand at an annual rate in excess of 40% coming into 2010.|$|E
25|$|The {{country is}} divided into {{multiple}} zones, called circles (roughly along state boundaries). Government and several private players run local and long distance telephone services. Competition has caused prices to drop and calls across India {{are one of the}} cheapest in the world. The rates are supposed to go down further with new measures to be taken by the Information Ministry. Call drop fine: Telcos warn of raising tariff. In September 2004, the number of mobile phone connections crossed the number of fixed-line connections and presently dwarfs the wireline segment by a ratio of around 20:1. The <b>mobile</b> <b>subscriber</b> base has grown by a factor of over a hundred and thirty, from 5 million subscribers in 2001 to over 929 million subscribers as of May 2012. India primarily follows the GSM mobile system, in the 900MHz band. Recent operators also operate in the 1800MHz band. The dominant players are Airtel, Reliance Infocomm, Vodafone, Idea cellular and BSNL/MTNL. There are many smaller players, with operations in only a few states. International roaming agreements exist between most operators and many foreign carriers. The government allowed Mobile number portability (MNP) which enables mobile telephone users to retain their mobile telephone numbers when changing from one mobile network operator to another.|$|E
