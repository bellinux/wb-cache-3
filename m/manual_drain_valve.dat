40|$|The Spent Nuclear Fuel (SNF) Project will {{transfer}} metallic SNF {{from the}} Hanford 105 K-East and 105 K-West Basins to safe interim storage in the Canister Storage Building in the 200 Area. The initial basis for design, fabrication, installation, {{and operation of}} the fuel removal systems was that the basin leak rate which could result from a postulated accident condition would not be excessive relative to reasonable recovery operations. However, an additional potential K Basin water leak path is through the K Basin <b>drain</b> <b>valves.</b> Three twelve-inch <b>drain</b> <b>valves</b> {{are located in the}} main basin bays along the north wall. Five four-inch <b>drain</b> <b>valves</b> are located in the north and south loadout pits (NLOP and SLOP), the weasel pit, the technical viewing pit, and the discharge chute pit. The sumps containing the valves are filled with concrete which covers the <b>drain</b> <b>valve</b> body. Visual observations indicate that only the valve's bonnet and stem are exposed above the basin concrete floor for the twelve-inch <b>drain</b> <b>valve</b> and that much less of the valve's bonnet and stem are exposed above the basin concrete floor for the five four-inch <b>drain</b> <b>valves.</b> It was recognized, however, that damage of the <b>drain</b> <b>valve</b> bonnet or stem during a seismic initiating event could provide a potential K Basin water leak path. The objectives of this analysis are to: (1) evaluate the likelihood of damaging the three twelve-inch <b>drain</b> <b>valves</b> located along the north wall of the main basin and the five four-inch <b>drain</b> <b>valves</b> located in the pits from a seismic initiating event, and (2) determine the likelihood of exceeding a specific consequence (initial leak rate) from a damaged valve. The analysis process is a risk-based uncertainty analysis where each variable is modeled using available information and engineering judgement. The uncertainty associated with each variable is represented by a probability distribution (probability density function). Uncertainty exists because of the inherent randomness associated with the distribution of values that a variable may assume, and {{because of a lack of}} knowledge concerning a variable. Engineering judgement and technical information are used to develop the variable probability density functions, but the bounds of the probability density function are based on physical limitations. The uncertainty, described by probability distributions, is propagated through the analysis by Monte Carlo convolution techniques. The corresponding results are developed as a probability distribution and expressed in terms of the corresponding complementary cumulative distribution function (''risk curve'') ...|$|R

25|$|Tokoroa's {{man-made}} Lake Moana-Nui {{was created}} in the late 1970s for the community, involving excavation by large earthmoving equipment and a concrete dam wall with a <b>drain</b> <b>valve</b> control. A wooden bridge located on the south-west end of the dam wall that supported and controlled the <b>drain</b> <b>valve</b> was a favourite 'bomb' spot, and barefoot skiing down the spillway was early extreme sport unique to Tokoroa. During the 1970s, 'The Lake' was used extensively by youths and was referred to in local parlance as 'Tokoroa Beach'. On many summer afternoons, it was a common sight to see youth lying on the footpath across the road from the lake drying out after a swim.|$|R
40|$|The <b>drain</b> <b>valve</b> {{located in}} the bottom of the K-West Basin South Loadout Pit (SLOP) could provide an {{additional}} leak path from the K Basins if the <b>drain</b> <b>valve</b> were damaged during construction, installation, or operation of the cask loading system. For the K-West Basin SLOP the immersion pail support structure (IPSS) has already been installed, but the immersion pail has not been installed in the IPSS. The objective of this analysis is to evaluate the risk of damaging the <b>drain</b> <b>valve</b> during the remaining installation activities or operation of the cask loading system. Valve damage, as used in this analysis, does not necessarily imply large amounts of the water will be released quickly from the basin, rather valve damage implies that the valve's integrity has been compromised. The analysis process is a risk-based uncertainty analysis where best engineering judgement is used to represent each variable in the analysis. The uncertainty associated with each variable is represented by a probability distribution. The uncertainty is propagated through the analysis by Monte Carlo convolution techniques. The corresponding results are developed as a probability distribution and the risk is expressed in terms of the corresponding complementary cumulative distribution function (''risk curve''). The total risk is the area under the ''risk curve''. The risk of potentially dropping a cask into or on the IPSS and damaging the <b>drain</b> <b>valve</b> is approximately 1 x 10 {sup - 4 } to 2 x 10 {sup - 5 } per year. The risk of objects falling behind the IPSS and damaging the valve is 3 x 10 {sup - 2 } to 6 x 10 {sup - 3 } per year. Both risks are expressed as drain value failure frequencies. The risk of objects falling behind the IPSS and damaging the valve can be significantly reduced by an impact limiter and/or installing a gating or plate over the area bounded by the back of the IPSS and the wall of the SLOP. With either of these actions there is a 90 percent confidence that the frequency of <b>drain</b> <b>valve</b> failure would be less than 1 x 10 {sup - 6 } per year...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the methods}} used to support land {{restoration}} lakes is the method of pulverizing aeration. Use of aerators powered exclusively by wind improves the condition of reservoirs, while not compromising the environment. The pulverizing aeration process drive is windy on the water aeration zone near bottom, while removing harmful gases anaerobic metabolism. Aerators of this type due to the unique method of operation also enable dosing of inactivation coagulants with oxygenated water to {{the depths of the}} lake. Mileage coagulant dosing can be made dependent on the speed of the wind, which has an impact on the performance of his work, because with the increase of wind speed dispensing valve coagulants should be stronger open. One {{of the methods}} for assessing the state of lakes is to measure water transparency. The softer visibility, the most likely state of the water is better. Dosage of coagulant so you can make the transparency of the water. Similarly, with increasing transparency water dispensing valve should be more covered up.

50|$|The Atlas {{test program}} during 1962 mainly {{consisted}} of Atlas D and F flights, {{and only one}} other E-series flew during the year, when Missile 64E lifted from OSTF-1 on December 18 and self-destructed 40 seconds into launch when the B-2 engine shut down, resulting in a yaw maneuver that exceeded the missile's structural limits. The failure was traced to a pressure pulse at liftoff that caused the B-2 insulation boot to be jammed upward and snag on the <b>drain</b> <b>valve</b> for the turbopump lubricant oil tank. During ascent, the oil escaped until the pump ran out of lubricant and seized up, causing engine shutdown and loss of the missile.|$|R
50|$|The valve is {{hydraulically}} actuated, by {{the pressure}} of the flow that it is controlling. A servomechanism is used to generate the large forces needed for these huge valves, power being derived from {{the pressure of}} the water itself. Although the pressure within the pipe cannot be increased above that of the supply, it can be decreased. The pipe cross-section at the lower (downstream) part of the valve is reduced in section compared to that above the valve. By Bernoulli's principle, this increases the flow velocity of the water, thus reducing pressure. If water pressure is bled away through a <b>drain</b> <b>valve,</b> obviously that will reduce its pressure too.|$|R
50|$|There {{are several}} {{potential}} problems with these valves. One {{is that the}} chest tube can clog. When chest tube clogging occurs, the pneumothorax or subcutaneous emphysema can recur.

To address this, some have turned to small chest drainage alternatives, such as the Atrium Express Mini 500 or the Teleflex Mini Sahara. An alternative solution is to attach a sputum trap to the valve, thus providing a reservoir to capture the draining fluid. The Atrium Pneumostat chest <b>drain</b> <b>valve</b> combines a one way valve and a 30cc collection chamber to address this issue.|$|R
