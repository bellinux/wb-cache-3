However, forged 20,000 forint notes {{printed on}} the paper of 2000 forint notes after dissolving the original ink <b>might</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> and {{are not easy to}} recognize.

500|$|Scott {{noted that}} {{it was easier to}} reach correct puzzle solutions, with clues being given out [...] "at a very {{reasonable}} rate". He saw this as the game's largest improvement upon previous Ace Attorney titles, which he said relied on trial and error; he had considered this the weakest point in the series, and something that needed to be changed. On the other hand, Walker said that the player often can figure out what a contradiction is going to be before the game lets them prove it, and the player <b>might</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> with legitimate ideas that the game does not accept. He also wished that the life bar could be filled up in court. Cole criticized how relevant evidence sometimes is not accepted, and how testimony statements sometimes need to be pressed in a certain order, but appreciated the game's larger focus on courtroom sessions over investigations. Thomas and the reviewers at Famitsu criticized the lack of new gameplay features, although the former thought that fans of the series would be fine with it. Scott acknowledged that the gameplay only is what is expected from the series, but did not find a problem with it due to the focus on narrative over gameplay. Moriarty said that while Trials and Tribulations is a good game in its own right, he wished that Capcom would make some changes to the gameplay or presentation, to avoid the series becoming [...] "overdone, played-out, and tired".|$|E

6000|$|... [Picture: Achilles binding his armour on Patroclus] His mother Thetis {{came from}} the sea and wept with him, and thence she went to Vulcan, from whom she {{obtained}} another beautiful suit of armour, with a wondrous shield, representing Greek life in every phase of war or peace; and in this Achilles went forth again to the battle. He drove the Trojans before his irresistible <b>might,</b> <b>came</b> <b>up</b> with Hector, chased him round and round the walls of Troy, and at length <b>came</b> <b>up</b> with him and slew him. Then, when Patroclus had been laid on a costly funeral pile, Achilles dragged Hector’s body {{at the back of}} his chariot three times round it. Further, in honour of his friend, he had games of racing in chariots and on foot, wrestling, boxing, throwing heavy stones, and splendidly rewarded those who excelled with metal tripods, weapons, and robes.|$|R
60|$|We ordered {{something}} rather {{special for}} dinner, {{with a bottle}} of something similarly out of the common way, in order that our minds might be fortified for the occasion, and we <b>might</b> <b>come</b> well <b>up</b> to the mark. Dinner over, we produced a bundle of pens, a copious supply of ink, and a goodly show of writing and blotting paper. For there was something very comfortable in having plenty of stationery.|$|R

Ponce de León sailed from Sanlúcar de Barrameda on February 2, 1526. [...] Ponce de León was delayed in Hispaniola until May 31, 1526 for repairs to his ship.

2500|$|The Talmud {{states that}} Pharaoh's {{daughter}} {{played a role}} in why Jeroboam was found worthy of becoming ruler of the Northern Kingdom of Israel. At Sanhedrin 101b it says [...] "Why did Jeroboam merit sovereignty? Because he reproved Solomon. And why was he punished? Because he reproved him publicly. As it is written, And this was the cause that he lifted up his hand against the king: Solomon built Millo, and repaired the breaches of the city of David his father. He said thus to him: Thy father David made breaches in the wall, that Israel <b>might</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> [...] on the Festivals; whilst thou hast closed them, in order to exact toll for the benefit of Pharaoh's daughter. What is meant by And this was the cause that he lifted up his hand against the king? [...] — R. Nahman said: He took off his phylacteries in front of him." ...|$|E

40|$|This paper reexamines the {{function}} (s) of the sentence-final use of "keredomo. "Kinjo (2001) presented a hypothesis concerning this usage of "keredomo": when the speaker uses S-keredomo, s/he is afraid that s/he is not providing enough information which satisfies {{the motivation of}} the inquiry. Critically reconsidering this hypothesis and reviewing other usages, another hypothesis will be offered: "keredomo" functions to mark that what the speaker says <b>might</b> not <b>come</b> <b>up</b> to the hearer's expectation.

5000|$|Reception of {{the novel}} was {{generally}} positive. Washington Post reviewer Brigitte Weeks called the novel an [...] "original and brilliant first novel" [...] which has [...] "united her fascination with the language of flowers—a long-forgotten and mysterious way of communication—with her firsthand knowledge of the travails of the foster-care system." [...] For Weeks, the [...] "novel is both enchanting and cruel, full of beauty and anger." [...] The New York Times compared the novel to something [...] "Dickens <b>might</b> have <b>come</b> <b>up</b> with, had Dickens been deeply interested in flower arranging." ...|$|R
5000|$|Ed Hannigan, Mantlo's artist {{collaborator}} on Peter Parker, the Spectacular Spider-Man, {{recalled that}} he and Mantlo jointly <b>came</b> <b>up</b> with the characters' visual design: [...] "Bill had a short page or two synopsis {{of the story that}} he showed me, and we discussed what the characters would look like. He gave me a lot of leeway, but it was fairly obvious that Cloak would be black and have a big 'animated' black cloak and Dagger would be white with a skintight leotard-type thing. I am not sure, but I think I <b>might</b> have <b>come</b> <b>up</b> with her ballet angle.

30|$|While these {{discussion}} points cover {{a lot of}} ground, this is by {{no means}} an exhaustive list. If given another 5000 words to play with, then we <b>might</b> easily <b>come</b> <b>up</b> with seven different issues.

The key point here is that there are plenty of important conversations that need to take place about digital technology and higher education beyond the presumption that technology is an instrumental issue that is neutrally implemented. As each of the articles in this special issue illustrate, the need for critical questions to be asked of higher education and digital technology is more pressing than ever.|$|R
5000|$|A single, [...] "Adam & Steve" [...] was {{released}} on November 7, 2008, along with a music video.

5000|$|Why doesn't Gettier's {{principle}} (PDJ) {{hold in the}} evidential situation he has described? You multiply your {{risks of}} being wrong when you believe a conjunction. The most elementary theory of probability indicates that Smith's prospects of being right on both (1) and (2), namely, of being right on (3), {{are bound to be}} less favorable than his prospects of being right on either (1) or (2).

Sequels are part of the necessity of our staying afloat, but we don't want to have to go there for those reasons. We want to go there creatively, so we said Disney, 'Can you give us the timeline about when we release them?

60|$|This account pleased me very well, {{especially}} when I understood {{that she had}} been gone from Dover five days. The Quaker comforted me, and said it was lucky this busy creature had passed the road before us, otherwise she might easily have found means to have overtaken us, for, as she observed, the wench had such an artful way of telling her story, that she moved everybody to compassion; and she did not doubt but that if we had been before, as we were behind, she would have got those who would have assisted her with a coach, &c., to have pursued us, and they <b>might</b> have <b>come</b> <b>up</b> with us.|$|R

60|$|It must be {{confessed that}} Joe's heart sank within {{him as he}} {{reviewed}} the situation.

60|$|Some {{time after}} that again, they were still more agreeably {{surprised}} with seeing our lights, and hearing the guns, which, as I have said, I caused to be fired {{all the rest of}} the night: this set them to work with their oars to keep their boats ahead, at least that we <b>might</b> the sooner <b>come</b> <b>up</b> with them; and at last, to their inexpressible joy, they found we saw them.|$|R
