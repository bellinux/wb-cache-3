The total area under oil palm cultivation is over 2. 65 million hectares, producing over 8 million tons of oil annually. The oil palm trunk is converted to oil palm wood after the replantation take place. The machining of wood process by cutting is a demanding technological process because of its specific structure. In many industries, accuracy and precision are crucial parameters for their production to achieve the best quality of cut.

The purpose of the present study was to compare the energy efficiency of various commercial UV lamp systems designed for photooxidation. Two type of tests were conducted: (1) direct photolysis of a chlorinated compound and (2) photolysis of hydrogen peroxide, which is an additive often used to photooxidize compounds that are not amenable to direct photolysis.

40|$|International audienceGaseous {{nitriding}} is {{a well-established}} thermochemical treatment of carbon iron-based alloys that considerably enhances corrosion, wear and fatigue resistances of critical mechanical parts such as crank shafts and bearings. It {{is based on}} the diffusion of nitrogen atoms from the catalytic decomposition of ammonia at the outer surface. The process has generally been relying on the fast development of a compound layer that mainly serves as a nitrogen reserve during the treatment. The growth of the compound layer directly depends on the adsorption of nitrogen atoms at the surface of treated parts. Any barriers to the nitrogen adsorption may induce detrimental kinetics of nitriding, and so a lack of mechanical properties. So-called surface preparations prior to nitriding thus fundamentally assist with (i) nitriding of superior quality (i. e. with the required properties such as the effective depth and mechanical properties), (ii) uniform nitriding of the whole treated part (i. e. no mechanical heterogeneities induced by the process) and (iii) repeatable nitriding from batch to batch. The present work deals with three in-situ surface activation solutions prior to nitriding that are oxidation, urea and ammonium chloride. Pre-treatments are compared based on their efficiency on uncleaned samples, defined by different degrees of residues of water dissolved <b>machining</b> <b>oil,</b> to be nitrided.

Because the CFC solvents have been implicated in stratospheric ozone depletion, AT&T has developed a policy that calls for a 50 % reduction in emissions by 1991 with eventual discontinuation of emissions in manufacturing processes by 1994. To comply with the corporate goals, alternative methods of metal cleaning must be developed. These methods may involve cleaning techniques that do not depend upon CFCs or processes that do not result in contaminated parts.
