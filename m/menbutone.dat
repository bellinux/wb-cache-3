Haematological, biochemical and histopathological changes resulting from intramuscular injection of <b>menbutone</b> were also investigated at dose 400 mg/kg body weight. Acute toxicity of <b>menbutone</b> at dose of 400 mg/kg BW induced interstitial myocarditis and multifocal necrosis, whereas serum creatine phosphokinase, creatinine phosphokinase-MB isoenzyme and aspartate aminotransferase activities were significantly increased. Elevation of serum alanine aminotransferase and alkaline phosphatase activities and total bilirubin level associated with lowered albumin content was consistent with histopathological changes of hepatic tissues; hepatic necrosis and fatty infiltration were pronounced indicators of injuries. Renal tubular necrosis and interstitial nephritis were also observed in intoxicated rabbits.  Menbutone also induced variations in some haematological parameters. We concluded that acute toxicity of <b>menbutone</b> in rabbits occurred at accidental high doses, as the lethal dose was about 50 fold over the recommended therapeutic dose for other animals. Cardiac muscle, liver and kidneys are the main target organs for <b>menbutone</b> toxicity. <b>Menbutone</b> is not recommended for use in rabbits suffering from any cardiac and hepatic disorders, especially in overdosing situations. <!
