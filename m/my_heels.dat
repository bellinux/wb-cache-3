500|$|Armstrong {{was not a}} [...] "walker"; he {{believed}} in waiting for the umpire to make a decision, once telling the English cricketer Arthur Gilligan, [...] "The more you play this game, the more you will find out that will be given out many times when you are not out and vice versa". [...] English professional cricketers took {{a dim view of}} Armstrong's approach to the game. [...] Jack Hobbs, describing one instance said, The chief offender was Warwick Armstrong, who got very nasty and unsportsmanlike, refusing to accept the umpire's decision. That upset me. I did not know if was standing on my head or <b>my</b> <b>heels</b> with the consequence that two balls later I let one go, never even attempting to play it; and it bowled me. I still bear this incident in mind against Armstrong.|$|E
500|$|By this point, Sheppard was {{a working}} class hero, being a cockney, non-violent, {{handsome}} and seemingly {{able to escape}} punishment for his crimes at will. [...] He spent a few days out of London, visiting a friend's family in Chipping Warden in Northamptonshire, but was soon back in town. [...] He evaded capture by Wild and his men but was arrested again on 9 September by a posse from Newgate as he hid out on Finchley Common, {{and returned to the}} condemned cell at Newgate. [...] His fame had increased with each escape, and he was visited in prison by the great, the good and the curious. [...] His plans to escape in September were thwarted twice when the guards found files and other tools in his cell, and he was transferred to a strong-room in Newgate known as the [...] "Castle", clapped in leg irons, and chained to two metal staples in the floor to prevent further escape attempts. [...] After demonstrating to his gaolers that these measures were insufficient, by showing them how he could use a small nail to unlock the horse padlock at will, he was bound more tightly and handcuffed. In his History, Defoe reports that Sheppard made light of his predicament, joking that [...] "I am the Sheppard, and all the Gaolers in the Town are my Flock, and I cannot stir into the Country, but they are all at <b>my</b> <b>Heels</b> Baughing after me".|$|E

2500|$|Between flops, it is true, I {{have come}} up with an {{occasional}} hit, but compared to a good boxer's record, for instance, my percentage has been lamentable. I fought a draw in my first fight, stupified everyone by winning the championship in my second, got a couple of wins with picture rights, then was knocked out three times in a row. Dragging my weary carcass to Hollywood, I was immediately knocked out again, won a big fight some six months later, then marked time for six years as an ordinary ham-and-beaner, picking up what I could. Suddenly I saw a chance and offered to fight for the world championship for a dollar. To everyone's astonishment, I won that championship and defended it successfully for a number of years, winning nine times by knockout, fighting three draws, losing twice and getting one no-decision in Europe. I have just come over to America for a fight, but it was called off at the last moment, one of the promoters having gone nuts and having to have been locked up. Why I'm not walking on <b>my</b> <b>heels</b> after all this, I don't know. Maybe I am walking on <b>my</b> <b>heels.</b> [...] It would be surprising if I weren't.|$|E

In a taped interview, Charles Fiore quoted Malachi Martin as saying the following regarding {{the text of the}} Third Secret: [...] "I cooled <b>my</b> <b>heels</b> in the corridor outside the Holy Father's apartments, while my boss, Cardinal Bea, was inside debating with the Holy Father, and with a group of other bishops and priests, and two young Portuguese seminarians, who translated the letter, a single page, written in Portuguese, for all those in the room." ...|$|E

So what I do is say, [...] "yes it is rotten food, let us sing a song", making sure that that particular chanson has a few vowels in it that require her to open her mouth! During which I pop the spoon in and I have won the argument. However if it is an argument with a person that knows their subject what I do is nod sagely and smile superciliously, let them ramble on, and at the end I say [...] "well I'm sorry, I think you're completely wrong", turn on <b>my</b> <b>heels</b> and leave.

2500|$|... …I was {{standing}} upstairs when I heard {{some sort of}} growing noise, then I saw the corrugated turbine cover rise and stand on end. Then I saw the rotor rising from underneath it. It was spinning. I could not believe my eyes. It rose about three meters. Rocks and pieces of metal went flying, we started to dodge them… At that point the corrugated cover was nearly at roof level, and the roof itself had been destroyed… I made a mental calculation: the water is rising, 380 cubic meters per second, so I took to <b>my</b> <b>heels</b> {{and ran for the}} № 10 turbine. I thought that I wouldn't make it, I climbed higher, stopped, looked down, and saw everything getting destroyed, water coming in, people trying to swim… I thought: someone must urgently shut the gates to stop the water, manually… Manually, because there was no power, none of the protection systems had worked… ...|$|E
2500|$|Destructoid's Brett Makedonski {{welcomed the}} high difficulty, which he noted as [...] "tough but fair". Based on [...] "exhaustive" [...] pattern recognition, {{he said it}} {{ultimately}} relied on muscle memory, rather than reaction. He thought structuring the game around boss battles was well executed, and that each boss encounter held [...] "different and special and memorable" [...] traits. Praising the 1930s aesthetics as cohesive, Makedonski found the jazz-based soundtrack to be [...] "similarly fabulous". Despite dying 188 times in his playthrough, Ray Carsillo at Electronic Gaming Monthly felt no frustration from the difficulty, but rather motivation to [...] "dig <b>my</b> <b>heels</b> in deeper". Carsillo lauded the [...] "gorgeous" [...] hand-drawn visuals, asserting {{that the only thing}} surpassing the artwork was the gameplay, which he said went [...] "beyond pattern recognition". Peter Brown of GameSpot opined that combatting enemies provided a considerably rewarding experience. He described the cartoon aesthetic as charming, adding that it infused [...] "color and expression" [...] to the game. Further, he saw Cuphead as a [...] "true recreation" [...] of hand-drawn cel animation. Brown also relished how quick loading times proved beneficial to trial and error tactics.|$|E
