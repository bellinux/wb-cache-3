The airline took its first delivery of this new aircraft in September 2004, with the eighth and final aircraft delivered on 22 June 2006. The new freighters were powered by two General Electric (GE) CF6-80C2 engines and signed a 14-year <b>Maintenance</b> <b>Cost</b> Per Hour (MCPH) programme with GE on 25 January 2005.|$|E
5|$|In June 2016, the {{estimated}} cost of the one-stop SSE was revised from $2 billion to $2.9 billion because tunnels need to be deeper than expected in some places, with the new terminal station being 45 to 90 per cent deeper. An additional cost factor is that a high water table would require more concrete. There is also a $300 million <b>maintenance</b> <b>cost</b> to keep Line 3 Scarborough operating until the SSE's opening {{resulting in a total}} project cost of $3.2 billion.|$|E
5|$|Most Solar {{parks are}} ground mounted PV systems, {{also known as}} {{free-field}} solar power plants. They can either be fixed tilt or use a single axis or dual axis solar tracker. While tracking improves the overall performance, it also increases the system's installation and <b>maintenance</b> <b>cost.</b> A solar inverter converts the array's power output from DC to AC, and connection to the utility grid is made through a high voltage, three phase step up transformer of typically 10kV and above.|$|E

40|$|Farm {{machinery}} managers {{often need}} to make complex economic decisions on machinery replacement. Repair and <b>maintenance</b> <b>costs</b> can have significant impacts on this economic decision. The farm manager {{must be able to}} predict farm machinery repair and <b>maintenance</b> <b>costs.</b> This study aimed to identify a regression model that can adequately represent the repair and <b>maintenance</b> <b>costs</b> in terms of machine age in cumulative hours of use. The regression model has the ability to predict the repair and <b>maintenance</b> <b>costs</b> for longer time periods. Therefore, it can be used for the estimation of the economic life. The study was conducted using field data collected from 11 John-Deer 955 combine harvesters used in several western provinces of Iran. It was found that power model has a better performance for the prediction of combine repair and <b>maintenance</b> <b>costs.</b> The results showed that the optimum replacement age of John-Deer 955 combine was 54300 cumulative hours...|$|R
5|$|This {{would involve}} {{replacing}} the eight Pratt & Whitney TF33 engines (total thrust 8 × 17,000lb) with four RB211 engines (total thrust 4 × 37,400lb), which would increase range and reduce fuel consumption, {{at a cost}} of approximately US$2.56billion for the whole fleet (71 aircraft at $36 million each). However, an Air Force analysis in 1997 concluded that Boeing's estimated savings of US$4.7billion would not be realized and that re-engining would instead cost US$1.3billion over keeping the existing engines, citing significant up-front procurement and re-tooling expenditure, as well as the RB211's higher <b>maintenance</b> <b>cost.</b>|$|E
5|$|The GCV {{must have}} been {{transportable}} by cargo aircraft, rail, and ship. The Army required it to meet the availability rates of the current Stryker. The Army did not limit the vehicle by {{the dimensions of the}} C-130 Hercules, which, in the past, constrained many designs. Air mobility would be provided by the more spacious C-17 Globemaster III. The GCV was to have good cross-country mobility, with a baseline requirement of 30mph off-road speed. The GCV should have delivered higher sustainability levels and consume less fuel than the Bradley or other vehicles of similar weight and power. The military was accepting both tracked and wheeled designs. The operational <b>maintenance</b> <b>cost</b> requirement of the GCV was up to $200 per mile, compared to $168 per mile for the M2 Bradley.|$|E
5|$|The pier was {{constructed}} during {{a boom in}} pleasure pier building in the 1860s, and was designed to attract tourism in Brighton. It was the town's second pier, joining the Royal Suspension Chain Pier of 1823. It was extended in 1893, and a concert hall was added in 1916. The pier reached its peak attendance during this time, with 2 million visitors between 1918 and 1919. Its popularity began to decline after World War II, and concerts were replaced by a funfair and tearoom. A local company took ownership in 1965, but could not meet the increased <b>maintenance</b> <b>cost,</b> and ultimately filed for bankruptcy. They {{could not find a}} suitable buyer, so the pier closed in 1975 and subsequently fell into disrepair.|$|E
