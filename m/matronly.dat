5|$|Emma Thompson (born 15 April 1959) is a British {{actress and}} screenwriter. She {{is known for}} her portrayals of reticent women, often in period dramas and {{literary}} adaptations, and playing haughty or <b>matronly</b> characters {{with a sense of}} irony. She is considered one of Britain's most accomplished actresses.|$|E
25|$|The truth, she thinks, sits {{calmly and}} plumply, dressed in <b>matronly</b> gray, {{between these two}} men.|$|E
25|$|From 1961 to 1963, Byington {{was cast}} as the wise, <b>matronly</b> housekeeper, Daisy Cooper, in the NBC Western series Laramie, {{starring}} John Smith and Robert Fuller. On Laramie, Daisy serves as a surrogate grandmother to orphaned Mike Williams, played by the child actor Dennis Holmes.|$|E
25|$|Fiction about gynoids {{or female}} cyborgs {{reinforce}} essentialist ideas of femininity, according to Margret Grebowicz. Such essentialist ideas may present as sexual or gender stereotypes. Among the few non-eroticized fictional gynoids include Rosie the Robot Maid from The Jetsons. However, {{she still has}} some stereotypically feminine qualities, such as a <b>matronly</b> shape and a predisposition to cry.|$|E
25|$|June remains calm amid {{household}} tumult, providing crucial {{guidance to}} her sons while shielding them from nefarious outside influences with a <b>matronly</b> force of will. Her protection is frequently needed against the pernicious intrigues of Eddie Haskell, who engages in impulsive, selfish, disruptive, and malevolent schemes. For crafty Eddie, each day {{is one more}} step toward the twilight of the adults, which will herald his ascension to neighborhood ruler.|$|E
25|$|In {{classical}} art Gaia {{was represented}} {{in one of}} two ways. In Athenian vase painting she was shown as a <b>matronly</b> woman only half risen from the earth, often in the act of handing the baby Erichthonius (a future king of Athens) to Athena to foster (see example below). In mosaic representations, she appears as a woman reclining upon the earth surrounded by a host of Carpi, infant gods of the fruits of the earth (see example below).|$|E
25|$|Her {{greatest}} fame came in 1965 {{when she}} started her 21-year stint as the <b>matronly</b> Mrs. Olson, who had comforting words for young married couples while pouring Folgers Coffee in the television commercials. The commercials became a popular staple on television and Christine's character, Mrs. Olsen, was often parodied by comedians and entertainers including Carol Burnett, Johnny Carson, Bob Hope, Ann-Margret, and Jackie Gleason. She {{would go on to}} appear in over 100 commercials for Folgers. In 1971, Christine's hometown of Stanton, Iowa, honored her by transforming the city water tower to resemble a giant coffeepot.|$|E
25|$|Female {{characters}} {{ranged from}} the sexually provocative to the laughable. These roles were almost always played by men in drag (most famously George Christy, Francis Leon and Barney Williams), even though American theater outside minstrelsy was filled with actresses at this time. Mammy or the old auntie was the old darky's counterpart. She often went {{by the name of}} Aunt Dinah Roh after the song of that title. Mammy was lovable to both blacks and whites, <b>matronly,</b> but hearkening to European peasant woman sensibilities. Her main role was to be the devoted mother figure in scenarios about the perfect plantation family.|$|E
25|$|Ever since, the {{definition}} of the canon has been a collective endeavor that involved several generations of European architects, from Renaissance and Baroque periods, basing their theories both on the study of Vitruvius' writings and the observation of Roman ruins (the Greek ruins became available only after Greek Independence, 1821–23). What was added were rules {{for the use of the}} Architectural Orders, and the exact proportions of them down to the most minute detail. Commentary on the appropriateness of the orders for temples devoted to particular deities (Vitruvius I.2.5) were elaborated by Renaissance theorists, with Doric characterized as bold and manly, Ionic as <b>matronly,</b> and Corinthian as maidenly.|$|E
500|$|Art {{historian}} Cornelius Vermeule, in {{his work}} on U.S. coins, took a more positive view of Barber's coinage: [...] "the last word as to their aesthetic merits {{has yet to be}} written. Little admired or collected for more than three generations after their appearance , these essentially conservative but most dignified coins have suddenly become extremely popular with collectors". Vermeule argued that [...] "the designs of Barber's coins were more attuned to the times than he perhaps realized. The plumpish, <b>matronly</b> gravitas of Liberty had come to America seven years earlier in the person of Frédéric Bartholdi's giant statue ... He suggested that the features of Daniel Chester French's huge statue Republic, created for the World Columbian Exposition, [...] "were absolutely in harmony with what Charles Barber had created for the coinage in the year of the Fair's opening".|$|E
500|$|Its successor, How to be a Domestic Goddess (2000), focuses {{primarily}} on baking. Of this second bestseller, The Times wrote of Lawson's book, that it [...] "is defined by its intimate, companionable approach. She is not issuing <b>matronly</b> instructions like Delia; she is merely making sisterly suggestions". Lawson rejected feminist criticism of her book, adding that [...] "ome people did take the domestic goddess title literally rather than ironically. It {{was about the}} pleasures of feeling like one rather than actually being one." [...] The book sold 180,000 copies in four months, and won Lawson the title of Author of the Year at the British Book Awards in 2001, fending off competition from authors such as J. K. Rowling. How to Eat and How to be a Domestic Goddess {{were published in the}} U.S. in 2000 and 2001. As a result of the book's success, The Observer took her on as a social affairs columnist.|$|E
500|$|The {{first season}} follows the Harmon family: [...] (Dylan McDermott), [...] (Connie Britton) and [...] (Taissa Farmiga), who move from Boston to Los Angeles {{to start a}} new life in a Victorian mansion, after Vivien has a {{miscarriage}} and Ben has an affair with [...] (Kate Mara), one of his students. On arrival, they learn from [...] (Christine Estabrook), the real estate agent, that the previous owners of their new mansion, a couple named [...] and [...] (Zachary Quinto and Teddy Sears), died in an apparent murder/suicide. Their neighbour [...] (Jessica Lange) and her daughter [...] (Jamie Brewer) become frequent, and mostly unwelcome, guests. Addie seems to have a connection with the house's mysterious past. [...] (Denis O'Hare), a former resident of the house who has suffered from terrible burns, also begins inserting himself into the Harmons' lives, giving Ben a cryptic warning about the house. The house also [...] "comes with" [...] (Frances Conroy/Alexandra Breckenridge), a housekeeper who appears young and seductive to men, but old and <b>matronly</b> to women.|$|E
2500|$|Hera {{was most}} {{known as the}} matron goddess, Hera Teleia; but she presided over weddings as well. [...] In myth and cult, fragmentary {{references}} and archaic practices remain of the sacred marriage of Hera and Zeus, and at Plataea, there was a sculpture of Hera seated as a bride by Callimachus, {{as well as the}} <b>matronly</b> standing Hera.|$|E
2500|$|In his Behind the Mask: On Sexual Demons, Sacred Mothers, Transvestites, Gangsters, Drifters, and Other Japanese Cultural Heroes, Ian Buruma {{describes}} Tani as {{the most}} celebrated porn star of her time, [...] "combin the savage and the maternal." [...] To explain her popularity he says she [...] "looked like a Japanese mother, her ample breasts tucked into a <b>matronly</b> kimono. She was the ideal object for men to take their anxieties out in, like the patient mother being pummelled by her sons. She was the Mother Goddess in bondage, the passive cross-bearer of masculine inadequacy." ...|$|E
2500|$|By the mid-1980s, Victoria largely {{adopts a}} <b>matronly</b> role {{along with her}} {{capacities}} as well-connected town businesswoman and socialite, though she is still plagued with intermittent bouts of mental illness. The character comes to mother five of her own children onscreen (three from infancy), while providing surrogate nurture to younger siblings Tina and Todd. Since 2000s, the role has evolved {{to be regarded as}} the [...] "grande dame of Llanview." [...] In a 2006 Boston magazine article, Slezak remarked of Victoria representing [...] "the very classy, very old-world money," [...] with writer Michael Callahan calling the character [...] "the stiff-upper-lipped matriarch" [...] of the prominent Lord family.|$|E
2500|$|The Times wrote that, in the contralto roles, Leonard eschewed [...] "the more bizarre {{traits of}} these intimidating females {{in favour of}} a more {{balanced}} personification. As the domineering harridan Katisha [...] she convincingly demonstrated that the grotesque mask hid a fragile suffering woman. ... Her Queen of the Fairies [...] outwardly so full of composure, betrayed in tantalising moments the character's repressed sensuality." [...] Long-time musical director David Steadman wrote of her portrayals, [...] "we felt the despair of Ruth losing Frederic's attentions in Pirates, we could easily believe that her Buttercup adored Captain Corcoran in the moonlit stillness of Act Two of H.M.S. Pinafore, that Katisha was a woman with feelings ... and that the Fairy Queen was a monarch with a <b>matronly</b> love for her girls." ...|$|E
2500|$|As Virginia {{returns home}} she feels, as did Laura Brown in the {{previous}} chapter, {{as if she is}} impersonating herself, as if the person she is presenting herself to be requires artifice. She puts on this 'act' to convince herself and others that she is 'sane' and so Leonard will agree with the idea of moving back to London. Virginia understands that there is [...] "true art" [...] in the requirement for women such as herself to act as they do. Feeling in control of her 'act' she goes to speak to the cook, Nelly, about lunch. However, Nelly, with her petty grievances and implicit demands that the daily life of running the house which is Virginia's domain, be observed, overwhelms Virginia. Nelly appears to have a <b>matronly</b> competence whilst Virginia {{does not seem to have}} a house-wifey bone in her body. Virginia decides to give her character, Clarissa Dalloway, the great skill with servants that she herself does not possess.|$|E
2500|$|In the 1830s {{and early}} 1840s, blackface {{performances}} mixed skits with comic songs and vigorous dances. Initially, Rice and his peers performed only in relatively disreputable venues, but as blackface gained popularity they gained opportunities to perform as entr'actes in theatrical venues {{of a higher}} class. Stereotyped blackface characters developed: buffoonish, lazy, superstitious, cowardly, and lascivious characters, who stole, lied pathologically, and mangled the English language. Early blackface minstrels were all male, so cross-dressing white men also played black women who were often portrayed as unappealingly and grotesquely mannish, in the <b>matronly</b> mammy mold, or as highly sexually provocative. The 1830s American stage, where blackface first rose to prominence, featured similarly comic stereotypes of the clever Yankee and the larger-than-life Frontiersman; the late 19th- and early 20th-century American and British stage where it last prospered featured many other, mostly ethnically-based, comic stereotypes: conniving, venal Jews; drunken brawling Irishmen with [...] at the ready; oily Italians; stodgy Germans; and gullible rural rubes.|$|E
2500|$|While Dillon and Miss Kitty {{clearly had}} a close {{personal}} relationship, the two never married. In a July 2, 2002, Associated Press interview with Bob Thomas, Arness explained, [...] "If they were man and wife, {{it would make a}} lot of difference. The people upstairs decided it was better to leave the show as it was, which I totally agreed with." [...] In the episode [...] "Waste", featuring Johnny Whitaker as a boy with a prostitute mother, her madam questions Dillon as to why the law overlooks Miss Kitty's enterprise. It appears that bordellos could exist [...] "at the law's discretion" [...] (meaning the marshal's). As an historical matter, prior to the First World War, few laws criminalized prostitution in the United States. Miss Kitty was written out in 1974. The actress sought more free time and reportedly missed her late co-star, Glenn Strange, who played her Long Branch barkeep, Sam. When Blake decided not to return for the show's 20th (and final) season, the character was said to have returned to New Orleans. She was replaced by the hoarse-voiced, <b>matronly</b> actress Fran Ryan (known to many as the second Doris Ziffel on CBS' Green Acres).|$|E
60|$|John paused, {{and looked}} musingly at the <b>matronly</b> tea-pot, {{as if he}} saw a wondrous future in its shine.|$|E
60|$|Don. Louisa. Her {{father is}} uncommonly partial to her; but I believe {{you will find}} she has rather a <b>matronly</b> air.|$|E
6000|$|Whereunto Bella replied, with {{probably}} the least successful attempt at looking <b>matronly</b> that ever was seen: 'Indeed, I think so, John, dear.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh. I {{have helped}} out, sometimes, when a <b>matronly</b> personation is required, but my regular duties keep me busily {{engaged in the}} office." ...|$|E
6000|$|So, with abounding {{affection for}} you and our babies, I hail this day that brings you the <b>matronly</b> grace and dignity of three decades! ...|$|E
60|$|I looked: I {{saw a woman}} attired like a well-dressed servant, <b>matronly,</b> {{yet still}} young; very good-looking, with black hair and eyes, and lively complexion.|$|E
60|$|Martha shrugged her voluminous {{shoulders}} with voluminous and forgiving affection for her wayward, <b>matronly</b> daughters who left {{their children in}} her care for the afternoon.|$|E
60|$|Cronshaw, hearing her, {{turned a}} sheepish eye upon her; she was stout, <b>matronly,</b> and middle-aged; and solemnly kissed {{his hand to}} her. She shrugged her shoulders.|$|E
60|$|Isaac. [Aside.] Truly, {{the little}} damsel was right--she has rather a <b>matronly</b> air, indeed! ah! 'tis well my {{affections}} are fixed on her fortune, and not her person.|$|E
60|$|Isabella crossed herself, {{her cheek}} flushed, her eye kindled, and her <b>matronly</b> but fine form seemed to tower with {{the majesty of}} the {{feelings}} that these pictures created.|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{are glad}} to see you," [...] said Annie, while a blush reddened her <b>matronly</b> cheek. [...] "It was not like a friend to stay from us so long." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes, {{and sober}} and <b>matronly.</b> That I am!' said Violet, drawing herself up. 'I must stand on my dignity now I have two children. Don't I look old and wise, Annette?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, it 's good practice," [...] laughed Polly, {{filling her}} tiny teapot, and taking her place behind the tray, with a <b>matronly</b> air, {{which was the}} best joke of the whole.|$|E
60|$|As {{he stood}} waiting Mose saw {{a pretty young}} woman {{come out of the}} house and take a babe from the ground with <b>matronly</b> impatience of the dirt upon its dress.|$|E
6000|$|... "I shall {{take some}} up to Mother, though she {{said we were}} {{not to think of}} her, for she'd take care of herself," [...] said Meg, who presided and felt quite <b>matronly</b> behind the teapot.|$|E
6000|$|... "It is {{the wolf}} that devoured Little Red Riding Hood," [...] {{answered}} the virtuoso; [...] "and by his side--with a milder and more <b>matronly</b> look, as you perceive--stands the she-wolf that suckled Romulus and Remus." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "This," [...] {{said the}} <b>matronly</b> presence, {{ushering}} {{me into a}} low room on the right, [...] "is where the Travellers sit by the fire, and cook what bits of suppers they buy with their fourpences." ...|$|E
