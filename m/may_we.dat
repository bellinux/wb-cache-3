Chance, one might say, turned out a vast number of individuals; a small proportion of these were organized in such a manner that the animals' organs could satisfy their needs. A much greater number showed neither adaptation nor order; these last have all perished.... Thus the species which we see today are but a small part of all those that a blind destiny has produced.|$|E

500|$|Ahimsa as {{an ethical}} concept evolved in Vedic texts. The oldest scripts, along with {{discussing}} ritual animal sacrifices, indirectly mention Ahimsa, {{but do not}} emphasise it. Over time, the Hindu scripts revise ritual practices {{and the concept of}} Ahimsa is increasingly refined and emphasised, ultimately Ahimsa becomes the concept that describes the highest virtue by the late Vedic era (about 500 BC). For example, hymn 10.22.25 in the Rig Veda uses the words Satya (truthfulness) and Ahimsa in a prayer to deity Indra; later, the Yajur Veda dated to be between 1000 BC and 600 BC, states, [...] "may all beings look at me with a friendly eye, may I do likewise, and <b>may</b> <b>we</b> look at each other with the eyes of a friend".|$|E

The reason for this tribute was partly {{due to the fact that}} another Oslo youth, Omer Bhatti, Jackson's friend, was also a good friend of Hermansen. The dedication in the album reads, [...] "Michael Jackson gives 'special thanks': This album {{is dedicated}} to Benjamin 'Benny' Hermansen. <b>May</b> <b>we</b> continue to remember not to judge man by the color of his skin, but the content of his Character. Benjamin ... we love you ... may you rest in peace." [...] The album is also dedicated to Nicholette Sottile and his parents Joseph and Katherine Jackson.|$|E

Expect more tonight. What ammunition are you bringing? When <b>may</b> <b>we</b> expect you?" [...] During the day, the Pashtuns prepared for another night attack while the British destroyed the bazaar and the regions previously defended, and lost, by Subadar Syed Ahmed Shah and the men of the 31st. Trees were also cut down to improve fields of fire, attracting further attention from the Pashtun sharpshooters. Major Stuart Beatsen arrived at 4:00pm on the 29th with the 11th Bengal Lancers who had been summoned from Nowshera two days previous. The 35th Sikhs and 38th Dogras arrived {{at the mouth of the}} pass leading to Malakand South, but after losing between 19 and 21 of their ranks through heat exhaustion, they were forced to halt.|$|E
500|$|The exact date of {{the burning}} of the monastery is not known for certain. On April 27 1915, a message sent [...] "To Americans, or any Foreign Consul" [...] by Clarence Ussher and Ernest Yarrow, American missionaries in Van, said that [...] "From our window we could plainly see Shushantz afire on its mountain-side and Varak Monastery, with its priceless store of ancient manuscripts, going up in smoke." [...] However, a fellow missionary, Elizabeth Barrows Ussher, Clarence Ussher's wife, wrote in her diary that the monastery was {{attacked}} by 200 cavalry and foot soldiers on April 30, but they were repulsed. She gave May 4 as the day the monastery was burned. Another missionary teacher Grace H. Knapp recounted, however, that [...] "On the 8th <b>May</b> <b>we</b> saw the place in flames, and Varak Monastery near by, with its priceless ancient manuscripts, also went up in smoke." ...|$|E

500|$|President Lincoln had had {{concerns}} that the Emancipation Proclamation of 1863 might be reversed or found invalid after the war. He saw constitutional amendment as a more permanent solution. He had remained outwardly neutral on the amendment because he considered it politically too dangerous. Nonetheless, Lincoln's 1864 party platform resolved to abolish slavery by constitutional amendment. After winning reelection in the election of 1864, Lincoln made {{the passage of the}} Thirteenth Amendment his top legislative priority, beginning with his efforts in Congress during its [...] "lame duck" [...] session. Popular support for the amendment mounted and Lincoln urged Congress on in his December 6, 1864 State of the Union Address: [...] "there is only a question of time as to when the proposed amendment will go to the States for their action. And as it is to so go, at all events, <b>may</b> <b>we</b> not agree that the sooner the better?" ...|$|E
500|$|News of Arthur's death reached Henry VII's court late on 4 April.

[...] He then told the king that [...] " [...] dearest son hath {{departed}} to God," [...] and Henry burst into tears. [...] "Grief-stricken and emotional," [...] he then had his wife brought into his chambers, so that they might [...] "take the painful news together"; Elizabeth reminded Henry that God had helped him become king and [...] "had ever preserved him," [...] adding that they had been left with [...] "yet a fair Prince and two fair princesses and that God is where he was, and [...] both young enough." [...] Soon after leaving Henry's bedchamber, Elizabeth collapsed and began to cry, while the ladies sent for the King, who hurriedly came and [...] "relieved her." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the short}} story by Graham Greene, <b>May</b> <b>we</b> borrow your husband?, a {{character}} comments on her breasts as, [...] "Everybody could grow them big except me. I am no Jayne Mansfield, I can tell you." [...] In the 2001 fiction and poetry collection of Zaffi Gousopoulos, The I. V. Lounge Reader, a character tries out lipsticks in Mansfield colors and lifting underwear to emphasize her femininity. [...] "All women aspire to be Jayne Mansfield", says a character in Drake Worthington's 2002 book, St. Vincent's Manhattan, while trying out a bra. In the Seinfeld episode [...] "The Implant" [...] Jerry quips [...] "you know that Jayne Mansfield had some big breasts!" [...] to girlfriend Sidra (Teri Hatcher) {{as he tries to}} figure out if her breasts are in fact real. Mansfield Domes are the unofficial names of two prominent granite mounds located in Yosemite National Park. In Toni Morrison's Beloved a character comments [...] "Yeah, while I'm nursing. I feel like Jayne Mansfield" [...] when her son comments on how big her breasts are.|$|E

500|$|He {{was almost}} exasperated by the {{inventiveness}} of forms in nature; [...] "In my examination of Orchids, hardly any fact {{has so much}} struck me as the endless diversity of structure,—the prodigality of resources,—for gaining the very same end, namely, the fertilisation of one flower by the pollen of another." [...] His focus on detail was justified, as [...] "The use of each trifling detail of structure {{is far from a}} barren search to those who believe in natural selection." [...] The [...] "contrivances and beautiful adaptations" [...] slowly acquired through slight variations, subjected to natural selection [...] "under the complex and ever-varying conditions of life", far transcended the most fertile imagination. The mechanisms to transport the pollen of one flower or of one plant to another flower or plant underlined the importance of cross-fertilisation: [...] "For <b>may</b> <b>we</b> not further infer as probable, in accordance with the belief of {{the vast majority of the}} breeders of our domestic productions, that marriage between near relatives is likewise in some way injurious,—that some unknown great good is derived from the union of individuals which have been kept distinct for many generations?" ...|$|E
500|$|The two men {{discussed}} [...] "natural aristocracy." [...] Jefferson said, [...] "The natural aristocracy I {{consider as}} the most precious gift of nature for the instruction, the trusts, and government of society. And indeed {{it would have been}} inconsistent in creation to have formed man for the social state, and not to have provided virtue and wisdom enough to manage the concerns of society. <b>May</b> <b>we</b> not even say that the form of government is best which provides most effectually for a pure selection of these natural [...] into the offices of government?" [...] Adams wondered if it ever would be so clear who these people were, [...] "Your distinction between natural and artificial aristocracy does not appear to me well founded. Birth and wealth are conferred on some men as imperiously by nature, as genius, strength, or beauty. ... When aristocracies are established by human laws and honour, wealth, and power are made hereditary by municipal laws and political institutions, then I acknowledge artificial aristocracy to commence." [...] It would always be true, Adams argued, that fate would bestow influence on some men for reasons other than true wisdom and virtue. That being the way of nature, he thought such [...] "talents" [...] were natural. A good government, therefore, had to account for that reality.|$|E
