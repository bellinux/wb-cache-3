25|$|Leland D. Bryan built {{a series}} of roadable {{aircraft}} using an Ercoupe fuselage, calling this line the Bryan Autoplane. Significant modifications included a double-articulated folding wing mechanism and a pusher engine. It still retained Ercoupe features, such as the twin tail and the center section. The first flight was in 1953, and the model II flew 65 hours. The <b>Model</b> <b>III</b> with a single wing-fold mechanism crashed in 1974, killing Bryan.|$|E

Instead {{the computer was}} furnished with a floppy disk labelled [...] "Model III/A". This was called the [...] "Model III ROM Image" [...] disk. If the operator wanted to boot a <b>Model</b> <b>III</b> DOS, he inserted this disk into the boot drive after powering up. Once it was loaded, he replaced the ROM Image disk with his <b>Model</b> <b>III</b> DOS boot disk and pressed reset. From then on the computer would behave exactly like a <b>Model</b> <b>III.</b>|$|E

50|$|The Model 4 shipped with TRSDOS 6, an {{enhanced}} {{version of the}} popular LDOS (itself an enhancement to older versions of TRSDOS) by Logical Systems. When the Model 4 boots into TRSDOS 6 the video display switches into 80×24 mode and the entire 64KB address space is mapped as RAM. The Model 4 is also capable of running all <b>Model</b> <b>III</b> software when a <b>Model</b> <b>III</b> operating system disk is detected and loaded during bootup, with a 64×16 video mode and <b>Model</b> <b>III</b> ROMs mapped from address zero. Model 4 features, including the internal speaker, are unavailable in <b>Model</b> <b>III</b> mode. Users experienced in Z-80 assembler could access Model 4 features like the larger screen and banked RAM in <b>Model</b> <b>III</b> mode through its machine I/O ports.|$|E
50|$|Tandy {{would go}} on to replace the Model I with the broadly {{compatible}} <b>Model</b> <b>III</b> in 1980. (The TRS-80 Model II had been an entirely different and incompatible design). The <b>Model</b> <b>III</b> was in turn succeeded by the backward-compatible Model 4 in 1983.|$|E

5000|$|The {{successor}} to the <b>Model</b> <b>III</b> was the TRS-80 Model 4 (April 1983, with [...] "4" [...] written as an Arabic numeral). It had faster Z80A 4 MHz CPU, a larger video display 80 columns x 24 rows, bigger keyboard, and could be upgraded to 128KB of RAM. The Model 4 was fully compatible with <b>Model</b> <b>III</b> software and industry-standard CP/M applications software. A diskless Model 4 (with 16KB RAM) cost $999, with 64KB RAM and one single-sided 180K disk drive $1699, and two drives $1999; an upgrade for <b>Model</b> <b>III</b> owners cost $799 and provided a new motherboard and keyboard. Tandy sold 71,000 in 1984. The new computer used exactly the same all-in-one cabinet as the <b>Model</b> <b>III,</b> but instead of the silvery-gray plastic formerly used the Model 4's case was off-white.|$|E

50|$|An entirely rewritten {{version of}} the Microsoft BASIC {{interpreter}} was bundled, which overcame many limitations of the <b>Model</b> <b>III</b> Disk BASIC (such as two-letter variable names) and provided new features (such as program chaining and the While-Wend control structure). It had a feature permitting a running BASIC program to be temporarily suspended and another TRSDOS program be executed. Model 4 BASIC came, however, with two disadvantages for veteran <b>Model</b> <b>III</b> BASIC programmers. First, variable names had {{to be separated from}} BASIC keywords with spaces, unlike <b>Model</b> <b>III</b> Disk BASIC which permitted them to be run together. This is because the Model 4 interpreter's variable names could be up to 40 characters in length, and the <b>Model</b> <b>III</b> interpreter's variable names had to be one or two characters in length (the interpreter would accept longer names but only the first two characters were significant for uniquely identifying the variable). The Model 4 version of BASIC therefore had to search for the delimiting space to find the end of the variable name. What this meant for the programmer converting his old <b>Model</b> <b>III</b> program into Model 4 BASIC {{was a great deal of}} tedious editing because almost always <b>Model</b> <b>III</b> programmers, to save memory and speed execution, compacted their code by using two-character variable names and eliminating spaces separating variables and keywords. The second disadvantage was that the Model 4 BASIC lacked the command available in <b>Model</b> <b>III</b> BASIC for sorting arrays (CMD"O"). This was a major headache for programmers maintaining code for business applications, and prompted many BASIC coders to homebrew a replacement capability. Later third-party software publishers made products available to fill the gap for non-programmers.|$|E
50|$|Up to 95% of TRS-80 <b>Model</b> <b>III</b> {{software}} would function without modification on the MAX-80. This did {{not include}} games. The special version of LDOS used was able to run most <b>Model</b> <b>III</b> programs with a patch disk available for those, such as VisiCalc, which it couldn't. The CP/M operating system was offered as well.|$|E

50|$|Superscripsit for the <b>Models</b> <b>III</b> and 4 {{could handle}} text files larger than memory by paging text data {{in and out}} of RAM to disk (effectively a virtual memory technique, but {{implemented}} by an applications program).

50|$|In July 1980, Tandy {{released}} the TRS-80 <b>Model</b> <b>III.</b> The improvements of the <b>Model</b> <b>III</b> over the Model I included: built-in lowercase, a better keyboard with repeating keys, an enhanced character set, a real-time clock, 1500-baud cassette interface, a faster (2.03 MHz) Z-80 processor, and {{elimination of the}} cable spaghetti (due to its all-in-one enclosure). Furthermore, a <b>Model</b> <b>III</b> with two floppy drives required the use of only one electrical outlet (a two-drive Model I required five outlets: one each for the CPU/keyboard, Expansion Interface, Video Monitor, and the drives). Shortly after the Model III's introduction, Model I production was discontinued as it did not comply with new FCC regulations as of January 1, 1981 regarding electromagnetic interference.|$|E
