40|$|This letter {{explains}} that density of positive <b>mass</b> <b>and</b> negative <b>mass</b> is almost uniformly {{throughout the whole}} universe, but density of positive <b>mass</b> <b>and</b> negative <b>mass</b> included in a random universe radius R can be different from each other.

This letter is showing possibility in explaining the decelerating expansion and accelerating expansion due to density difference of positive <b>mass</b> <b>and</b> negative <b>mass</b> because negative <b>mass</b> <b>and</b> positive <b>mass</b> conducts different forms of movement depending on the density difference of positive <b>mass</b> <b>and</b> negative <b>mass.</b> As change of total gravitational potential energy sign occurs from UT= 0 and total gravitational potential energy oscillates based on 0.

40|$|We use a {{combination}} of X-shooter spectroscopy, ULTRACAM high-speed photometry and SOFI near-infrared photometry to measure the <b>masses</b> <b>and</b> radii of both components of the eclipsing post common envelope binaries SDSS J 1212 - 0123 and GK Vir. For both systems we measure the gravitational redshift of the white dwarf and combine it with light curve model fits to determine the inclinations, <b>masses</b> <b>and</b> radii. For SDSS J 1212 - 0123 we find a white dwarf <b>mass</b> <b>and</b> radius of 0. 439 +/- 0. 002 Msun and 0. 0168 +/- 0. 0003 Rsun, and a secondary star <b>mass</b> <b>and</b> radius of 0. 273 +/- 0. 002 Msun and 0. 306 +/- 0. 007 Rsun. For GK Vir we find a white dwarf <b>mass</b> <b>and</b> radius of 0. 564 +/- 0. 014 Msun and 0. 0170 +/- 0. 0004 Rsun, and a secondary star <b>mass</b> <b>and</b> radius of 0. 116 +/- 0. 003 Msun and 0. 155 +/- 0. 003 Rsun. The <b>mass</b> <b>and</b> radius of the white dwarf in GK Vir are consistent with evolutionary models for a 50, 000 K carbon-oxygen core white dwarf. Although the <b>mass</b> <b>and</b> radius of the white dwarf in SDSS J 1212 - 0123 are consistent with carbon-oxygen core models, evolutionary models imply that a white dwarf with such a low <b>mass</b> <b>and</b> in a short period binary must have a helium core. The <b>mass</b> <b>and</b> radius measurements are consistent with helium core models but only if the white dwarf has a very thin hydrogen envelope, which has not been predicted by evolutionary models. The <b>mass</b> <b>and</b> radius of the secondary star in GK Vir are consistent with evolutionary models after correcting for the effects of irradiation by the white dwarf. The secondary star in SDSS J 1212 - 0123 has a radius ~ 9 per cent larger than predicted. Comment: 21 pages, 14 Figures and 11 Tables. Accepted for publication in MNRA...|$|R

Methods We measured Lp-PLA 2 <b>mass</b> <b>and</b> activity in 714 healthy older adults with no clinical coronary heart disease and not taking dyslipidemia medication. We evaluated the association between race <b>and</b> Lp-PLA 2 <b>mass</b> <b>and</b> activity levels after adjustment for various covariates using multivariable linear regression. These covariates included age, sex, diabetes, hypertension, body mass index, lipid measurements, C-reactive protein, smoking status, physical activity, diet, income, and education level. We further examined genetic covariates that included three single nucleotide polymorphisms shown to be associated with Lp-PLA 2 activity levels. Results The mean age was 66 years. Whites had the highest Lp-PLA 2 <b>mass</b> <b>and</b> activity levels, followed by Hispanics and Asians, and then African-Americans; in age and sex adjusted analyses, these differences were significant for each non-White race as compared to Whites (p 2 <b>mass</b> <b>and</b> 24. 7 nmol/ml-min lower activity, compared with Whites, independent of age and sex (p 2 <b>mass</b> <b>and</b> activity levels (p 2 <b>mass</b> <b>and</b> 17. 3 nmol/ml-min lower activity compared with Whites (p Conclusion Biological, lifestyle, demographic, and select genetic factors do not appear to explain variations in Lp-PLA 2 <b>mass</b> <b>and</b> activity levels between Whites and non-Whites, suggesting that Lp-PLA 2 <b>mass</b> <b>and</b> activity levels may need to be interpreted differently for various races. </p...|$|R
