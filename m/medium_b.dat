50|$|In optics, medium A is {{a vacuum}} while <b>medium</b> <b>B</b> is glass. In acoustics, medium A {{may be a}} liquid or gas and <b>medium</b> <b>B</b> a solid. For both cases, medium A is a region of space where the particle's total energy is greater than its {{potential}} energy and <b>medium</b> <b>B</b> is the potential barrier. These have an incoming wave and resultant waves in both directions. There can be more mediums and barriers, and the barriers need not be discrete; approximations are useful in this case.|$|E
50|$|These {{effects are}} {{modelled}} similarly to the rectangular potential barrier. In these cases, {{there is one}} transmission medium through which the wave propagates {{that is the same}} or nearly the same throughout, and a second medium through which the wave travels differently. This can be described as a thin region of <b>medium</b> <b>B</b> between two regions of medium A. The analysis of a rectangular barrier by means of the Schrödinger equation can be adapted to these other effects provided that the wave equation has travelling wave solutions in medium A but real exponential solutions in <b>medium</b> <b>B.</b>|$|E

However, Tritton's Medium Mark C was a much longer vehicle. It had a separate engine compartment at the back like the <b>Medium</b> <b>B,</b> but here it was large enough to house a normal 6-cylinder Ricardo engine behind a standard epicyclic transmission. Also it was easily accessible from the fighting compartment. The larger engine meant the tank had better speed (about 8 mph). The greater length gave it a superior trench crossing ability. A fuel tank holding 150 imp gal of petrol allowed for a range of 140 mi. Overall mobility therefore was much better.|$|E

50|$|Although Erwinia papayae {{has been}} known to survive on leaves of cowpea, tomato, and rockmelon for a minimum of two weeks, the host range of {{bacterial}} crown rot is confined to papaya (Webb 1985). Inoculation with the pathogen of twenty-three common weed species and crops found in association with Philippine papaya fields found none of these species to be susceptible to the disease (Obrero 1980). Symptoms of bacterial crown rot begin as angular water-soaked lesions on leaf surfaces and eventually spread through veins and petioles to cause death to the canopy layer of leaves. Water-soaked cankers also appear on the stem, causing it to collapse, and spread to meristems, killing the growing tips of the plant (Webb 1985; Fullerton et al. 2011; Maktar et al. 2008). Water-soaked lesions can also appear on unripe fruit, and although they start small, the lesions can turn into firm depressions (Webb 1985). Dry conditions can allow infected plants to recover and produce unaffected, fruit-producing branches. Erwinia papayae is a Gram-negative, straight rod bacterium with peritrichous flagella, so diagnosis can be made using a Gram stain. On King’s <b>medium</b> <b>B,</b> colonies are creamy and mucoid with a non-diffusible blue pigment (Vawdrey 2011).|$|E

30|$|The B. subtilis strains DSM  10 T, DSM  28227, ATCC  21332, DSM  3256, DSM  1090 and DSM  3258 were {{analyzed}} regarding their Surfactin production during cultivation in <b>medium</b> <b>B</b> and medium C (Table  1). The CDW and Surfactin concentrations of these cultivations {{are shown in}} the appendix in Additional file 1 : Figure S 2. Most interestingly, the production of Surfactin seems to be enhanced in all cultivations employing the optimized medium C. Except {{for the results of}} DSM  3258, where the Surfactin production increased during cultivation in <b>medium</b> <b>B.</b> However, Surfactin production was generally very low (0.05 – 0.1 g/L) during the cultivations of DSM  3258 and the shown error bars indicate a rather similar production rate during cultivation in <b>medium</b> <b>B</b> and C. In summary, the concentration of Surfactin was doubled to tripled during cultivation of DSM  10 T, DSM  28227, ATCC  21332, DSM  3256 and DSM  1090 employing the enhanced medium C in comparison to the previously applied <b>medium</b> <b>B</b> (sole exception DSM 3258), which suggests a general improvement of Surfactin production during cultivation in medium C independent from the applied Bacillus strain.|$|E

Freshly isolated testes of immature giant gouramy were minced in dissociation medium and then incubated to get monodisperce cell suspension. Parameters observed were number and viability of spermatogonia (ø > 10 μm). The viability was analyzed using trypan blue exclusion dye. The results showed that the average number of spermatogonia observed in <b>medium</b> <b>B</b> was higher than in medium A (P 0. 05).
