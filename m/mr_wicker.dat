60|$|They enter, locking {{themselves}} in, descend {{the rugged}} steps, and are {{down in the}} Crypt. The lantern is not wanted, for the moonlight strikes in at the groined windows, bare of glass, the broken frames for which cast patterns on the ground. The heavy pillars which support the roof engender masses of black shade, but between them there are lanes of light. Up and down these lanes they walk, Durdles discoursing of the ‘old uns’ he yet counts on disinterring, and slapping a wall, in which he considers ‘a whole family on ’em’ to be stoned and earthed up, just {{as if he were}} a familiar friend of the family. The taciturnity of Durdles is for the time overcome by <b>Mr.</b> Jasper’s <b>wicker</b> bottle, which circulates freely;—in the sense, that is to say, that its contents enter freely into Mr. Durdles’s circulation, while Mr. Jasper only rinses his mouth once, and casts forth the rinsing.|$|R
50|$|It {{is likely}} that it was Hickman’s sudden {{increase}} in wealth which enabled him {{to set up a}} short-lived academy at Dusthorp, near Bromsgrove, to which Thomas Cotton, Eliezer and John Heywood (the sons of Oliver Heywood), and Adam Martindale’s son, were sent to study university learning. The antiquarian A. L. Reade later speculated that Hickman actually lived at Belbroughton, where his sister’s husband John Tristram was the patron, and where his son was baptized at Belbroughton on 28 October 1668 (Reade, Reades, 110). On Thursday 15 May 1673 Oliver Heywood had a fast at his house at nine o’clock for his two sons Eliezer and John, who were ‘to go abroad to learning’. The following Monday 19 May they set on their journey, accompanied by ‘little Jer: Baxter’ and arrived at Manchester in the evening; the following morning they set out again, now joined by ‘Mr Richardsons son and Mr Cottons two sons and man’, and made for Worcestershire, passing through Trentham, Stafford (on Wednesday 20), Stourbridge, and Bromsgrove, before coming at last to Hickman’s house (Mark Burden, A Biographical Dictionary of Tutors at the Dissenters’ Private Academies, 1660-1729; Dr Williams’s Centre for Dissenting Studies, 2013 275). On 21 November 1673 Eliezer Heywood wrote to his father from Dusthorp in Warwickshire ‘where he and his brother are trained up with Mr Hickman in university-learning’. The story of the education of Adam Martindale’s son Thomas provides some clear reasons why some students chose to attend Hickman’s academy. Martindale first took Thomas to London, ‘where I found noble friends willing to assist me as to the charge’ of attending Hickman’s academy, including Peter Brooke {{and a member of the}} Foley family. The younger Martindale ‘staid with this learned tutor two yeares, who had a deare respect for him, and brought him clearely through the whole bodie of philosophie’; during this period, Hickman had ‘a good free time’, although he was afterwards involved ‘in great sutes and troubles’ (Martindale, Life, 187-9). Another student of Hickman was the future minister Thomas Cotton; Cotton had previously studied under <b>Mr</b> <b>Wickers</b> at a school in Manchester, before proceeding to ‘Mr. Hickman’s private academy’. Cotton’s biographer Samuel Wright states that ‘Mr. Hickman was so disabled by age’ that Cotton ‘made a very short stay there; and was removed from thence to Mr. Frankland’s in Westmoreland.|$|R
