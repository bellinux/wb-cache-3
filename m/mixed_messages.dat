5|$|From a young age, Jackson {{was exposed}} to sex. He {{received}} <b>mixed</b> <b>messages</b> on the subject from his parents. His mother Katherine was a devout Jehovah's Witness and conveyed her thoughts clearly; lust in thought or deed was sinful outside of marriage, and physical intimacy should be saved for marriage. In contrast to his wife, father Joseph, a steel mill worker, shunned the religion and would have The Jackson 5 perform at strip clubs and seedy bars in {{the earliest days of}} their career. He allowed nine-year-old Michael to watch from the wings of the stage as male audience members whistled at women who stripped until nude. In one incident, a fascinated Michael watched as an apparently big breasted female removed all but her underwear. The stripper then proceeded to reach into her bra, removing two large oranges and the wig from her head, to reveal that the person he thought was a female was not a woman at all.|$|E
5|$|While Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) {{is having}} a meeting with Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) in his office, Robert California (James Spader) appears {{at the window and}} frantically says that his wife Susan (Maura Tierney) is looking for a job in the office, and that Andy must not give her one. When Susan arrives, Andy {{compliantly}} tells her that they have no openings, but Robert insists that they have a look around before coming to any conclusions. Susan looks at the different departments, and decides on accounting. Andy again claims the office is already fully staffed, but Robert insists that he give her a job, even pressuring Andy by reminding him of his power as CEO. Confused by Robert's <b>mixed</b> <b>messages,</b> Andy relents and gives her a job, but Robert later calls Andy on the phone to berate him for hiring Susan. Andy asks everyone in the office to treat her poorly to drive her out, which makes everyone uncomfortable as they like her, but end up doing so nevertheless. When Susan notices their behavior, she complains to Robert, who asks Andy to discuss the issues with Susan in the conference room and leaves. Susan eventually realizes it was Robert's idea to drive her away. When they call Robert out, he vehemently denies it. Andy tells them Jim also heard him say he did not want her working at the office, which Jim overhears, prompting him to flee the office. Robert orders security to close the gate, preventing him from leaving. Jim then runs all over the building, but Andy and Robert find him and take him back to the office. After trying unsuccessfully to deflect their questions about what Robert told Andy, Jim blurts out that he is baffled at Robert's attitude, since Jim enjoys working in the same place as his wife Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) and misses her while she is on maternity leave. Andy and Jim leave the conference room and after a short while, Robert and Susan leave. In the parking lot, Andy apologizes to Susan and after brief small talk, Susan asks Andy out on a date, leaving him surprised.|$|E

25|$|Miller {{had also}} hurt himself. He had fired {{most of his}} {{supporters}} in the intervening three years, including press officer Bernard Aronson, research director Thomas Bethell {{and most of the}} research department staff, leaving UMWA organizationally unable to handle the needs of the negotiations and strike. Miller turned to the Stanley H. Ruttenberg Company for negotiating advice and assistance at the bargaining table. This caused confusion among UMWA negotiators as to strategy, tactics and the content of proposals, and caused mixed signals to be sent by the bargaining committee, Miller and other UMWA officers. The lack of organizational competence and flow of <b>mixed</b> <b>messages</b> helped prolong the labor dispute.|$|E
25|$|Foreign leaders {{reacted with}} both {{positive}} and <b>mixed</b> <b>messages.</b> Most world leaders congratulated and praised Barack Obama on his re-election victory. However, Venezuela and some other states had tempered reactions. Pakistan commented that Romney's defeat had made Pakistan-United States relations safer. Stock markets fell noticeably after Obama's re-election, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average, NASDAQ, and the S 500 each declining over two percent {{the day after the}} election. By his inauguration, however, the markets had gained back all the losses and a bull run began that culminated in 2015 when the Dow closed at an all-time high of 18,312, the NASDAQ reached the milestone of 5,210, and the S 500 peaked at a record 2,130.|$|E

25|$|In June 2009 a coup d'état ousted President Manuel Zelaya; he {{was taken}} in a {{military}} aircraft to neighboring Costa Rica. The General Assembly of the United Nations voted to denounce the coup and called {{for the restoration of}} Zelaya. Several Latin American nations including Mexico temporarily severed diplomatic relations with Honduras. In July 2010, full diplomatic relations were once again re-established with Mexico. The United States sent out <b>mixed</b> <b>messages</b> after the coup; Obama called the ouster a coup and expressed support for Zelaya's return to power. US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, advised by John Negroponte, the former Reagan-era to Honduras implicated in the Iran-Contra affair, refrained from expressing support. She has since explained that the US would have had to cut aid if it called Zelaya's ouster a military coup, although the US has a record of ignoring these events when it chooses. Zelaya had expressed an interest in Hugo Chávez' Bolivarian Alliance for Peoples of our America (ALBA), and had actually joined in 2008. After the 2009 coup, Honduras withdrew its membership.|$|E

Using such deliberately <b>mixed</b> <b>messages</b> was part of Crass' strategy of presenting themselves as a [...] "barrage of contradictions", challenging audiences to (in Rimbaud's words) [...] "make your own fucking minds up". This included using loud, aggressive music to promote a pacifist message, a reference to their Dadaist, performance-art backgrounds and situationist ideas.|$|E

Claremont McKenna College professor John Pitney argued that the candidate was sending <b>mixed</b> <b>messages</b> since [...] "the Libertarian Party essentially supports open borders," [...] and was unlikely to gain the support of anti-immigration activists.

500|$|The {{cover sleeve}} and images were shot by Steven Meisel, {{who would become}} a regular {{collaborator}} with Madonna, in a suite at the St. Regis Hotel. Madonna wanted the album title to make provocative link between her own religious name—Madonna as the Roman Catholic title for Jesus' mother Mary—and the Christian concept of the virgin birth. With the title song alluding to this concept, Madonna wanted the album cover to have <b>mixed</b> <b>messages</b> as well. Author Graham Thompson described that [...] "reclining on a satin sheet, with a bouquet on her lap and wearing a wedding dress, a closer inspection reveals Madonna's image as highly fetishized and sexualized." [...] He added that the heavy make-up, pouting lips, and despoiled hair, along with the tight-fitting bustier and full-length gloves, turned Madonna's image into a figure not of virtue, but of desire. This point, according to Thompson, is further emphasized by the belt she is wearing, the wording on which is just visible as [...] "Boy Toy". He added: [...] "The image was ambiguous and was based upon the fact that Madonna's appeal at that point of her career was not presenting herself just {{as an object of}} desire, but also as a desiring female subject".|$|E

Tris McCall of The Star-Ledger wrote in his review of the song that its [...] "brutal" [...] music video took the critique of perfection and physical beauty further than what the track did. [...] Brandon Sodeber of the magazine Vice called the visual the best on Beyoncé and opined that it was [...] "an incredibly affecting mini-melodrama that underlines to Beyoncé's painful awareness that being black and female means you're never enough of something or other for mainstream America". However, Neil McCormick of The Daily Telegraph felt that the video sent <b>mixed</b> <b>messages.</b> Brent DiCrescenzo from Time Out complimented Keitel's appearance in the clip, but criticized the visual's message because he felt that it came from [...] "one of the most beautiful women in the world".|$|E
