5|$|At times Shelley {{had trouble}} finding {{sufficient}} research materials {{and had to}} <b>make</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> fewer resources than she would have liked, particularly for the Spanish and Portuguese Lives. She wrote in a style that combined secondary sources, memoir, anecdote, and her own opinions. Her political views are most obvious in the Italian Lives, where she supports the Italian independence movement and promotes republicanism; in the French Lives she portrays women sympathetically, explaining their political and social restrictions and arguing that women can be productive members of society if given the proper educational and social opportunities.|$|E
5|$|Louise had artistic {{training}} from childhood, {{first with}} Susan Durant from 1864, then Mary Thornycroft from 1867, and further lessons with Edgar Boehm. She also then attended National Art Training School, or NATS, which {{marks the first}} time a member of the British royal family attended a public education institution. Like many women artists in the nineteenth century, Louise had to <b>make</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> training intended for industrial designers and art teachers rather than fine artists. There was no training from the nude model, as there was for male art students.|$|E
5|$|Several armies in the Second World War in Northern European {{countries}} preferred separate winter uniforms {{rather than}} oversuits. The Waffen-SS went a step further, developing reversible uniforms with separate schemes for summer and autumn, {{as well as}} white winter oversuits. Other German units fighting in Eastern Europe were at first poorly equipped for winter, having to <b>make</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> ordinary summer uniforms, but {{in the winter of}} 1942 to 1942 new white two-piece hooded oversuits with long mitten gauntlets started to arrive. American troops in Europe in the winter of 1944 to 1945 improvised snow capes and helmet covers from white cloth such as bed linen.|$|E

5|$|The sepoys {{were also}} accused {{of not being}} able to adjust and adapt to the living {{conditions}} in their new environment. While in India, the sepoys would have a constant supply of goat meat and milk but because it was difficult to receive a constant supply of goat in Singapore, the sepoys had to <b>make</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> a substitute – chicken - and very little milk. The sepoys resorted to buying their own meat and milk to make up for the insufficient amount they received and the use of the dollar versus the rupee irked them further.|$|E
5|$|Walt Disney Imagineering (WDI) built animatronic WALL-E's {{to promote}} the picture, which made {{appearances}} at Disneyland Resort, the Franklin Institute, the Miami Science Museum, the Seattle Center, and the Tokyo International Film Festival. Due to safety concerns, the 318kg robots were always strictly controlled and WDI always needed {{to know exactly what}} they were required to interact with. For this reason, they generally refused to have their puppets meet and greet children at the theme parks in case a WALL-E trod on a child's foot. Those who wanted to take a photograph with the character had to <b>make</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> a cardboard cutout.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} the Voss Line was {{completed}} Norway had plunged into recession. Parliament {{was not willing to}} give more money to railways, and the country had to <b>make</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> a transport plan launched in 1886 that did not follow up with any funding. On 1 March 1894 parliament after five days of debate chose, with 60 against 53 votes, to build the Bergen Line. Several different routes had been proposed, including over Krøderen, or down Numedal (which later would get the Numedal Line). In the end Hallingdal was chosen, connecting to Hønefoss and via Sandvika. To save costs a preliminary line would connect Hønefoss to Roa with the branch Roa–Hønefoss Line. The final stage would be along the Gjøvik Line to Oslo. The line would also connect to the system via the Randsfjorden Line at Hønefoss.|$|E

5000|$|The {{secret of}} the success of these little {{sketches}} is that the artist does not so much seek to record exactly what he sees, like a camera, as to translate an overall vision and experience of the landscape. He <b>makes</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> little more than intimations of scenery, using streaks, flecks and blobs of paint to suggest vegetation, rocks and the contours of the land.|$|R
5|$|In March 1991, in {{his fourth}} top {{division}} tournament, Takahanada was runner-up with twelve wins, and became the youngest ever sanshō or special prize winner, receiving awards for Fighting Spirit and Technique. In the following tournament in May 1991 he defeated veteran yokozuna Chiyonofuji in a match watched by 44 percent of the Japanese population on TV, and became the youngest ever to defeat a yokozuna. Chiyonofuji retired two days afterwards. In January 1992, he became the youngest ever top division tournament champion (19years 5months). He {{was too young to}} drink the celebratory sake at the after tournament party, and had to <b>make</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> oolong tea instead. After his second championship in September 1992, followed by two good scores of 10–5 and 11–4 in the next two tournaments, he was promoted to ōzeki in January 1993, the same tournament in which Akebono was elevated to yokozuna.|$|E
5|$|The War Department {{approved}} Krueger's {{transfer to}} SWPA, {{but did not}} approve MacArthur's request for Third Army headquarters. There were only three American divisions in SWPA: the 32nd Infantry Division at Rockhampton, Queensland, the 41st Infantry Division in the Buna area in Papua, and the 1st Marine Division in Melbourne, Victoria. The 1st Cavalry Division and the 24th Infantry Division were scheduled to arrive in 1943, and other divisions would follow in 1944, but {{for the time being}} there were much fewer troops than an army would normally control. The War Department therefore saw no need for a full strength army headquarters. Instead, Krueger had to <b>make</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> him a skeleton staff of a new Sixth Army, which was activated in January 1943, with less than half the establishment strength of an army headquarters.|$|E
5|$|Janáček {{originally}} intended to study piano and organ but eventually devoted himself to composition. He wrote his first vocal compositions while choirmaster of the Svatopluk Artisan's Association (1873–76). In 1874 he enrolled at the Prague organ school, under František Skuherský and František Blažek. His student days in Prague were impoverished; with no piano in his room, he had to <b>make</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> a keyboard drawn on his tabletop. His criticism of Skuherský's performance of the Gregorian mass {{was published in the}} March 1875 edition of the journal Cecilie and led to his expulsion from the school – but Skuherský relented, and on 24 July 1875 Janáček graduated with the best results in his class. On his return to Brno he earned a living as a music teacher, and conducted various amateur choirs. From 1876 he taught music at Brno's Teachers Institute. Among his pupils there was Zdenka Schulzová, daughter of Emilian Schulz, the Institute director. She was later to be Janáček's wife. In 1876 he also became a piano student of Amálie Wickenhauserová-Nerudová, with whom he co-organized chamber concertos and performed in concerts over the next two years. In February 1876, he was voted choirmaster of the Beseda brněnská Philharmonic Society. Apart from an interruption from 1879 to 1881, he remained its choirmaster and conductor until 1888.|$|E
40|$|The {{recent years}} have seen a number of {{proposals}} for extending statically typed languages by dynamics or generics. Most proposals — if not all — require significant extensions to the underlying language. In this paper we show that this need not be the case. We propose a particularly lightweight extension that supports both dynamics and generics. Furthermore, the two features are smoothly integrated: dynamic values, for instance, can be passed to generic functions. Our proposal <b>makes</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> a standard Hindley-Milner type system augmented by existential types. Building upon these ideas we have implemented a small library that is readily usable both with Hugs and with the Glasgow Haskell compiler...|$|R
50|$|However, {{the weather}} had {{abruptly}} become dark and rainy, and Dick and Anne are directed only with the vaguest “ar”s when they request directions, besides being confused by ringing bells whose meaning they cannot decipher. The two children take completely the wrong route, and upon seeing a light, run to meet a completely deaf old woman. Assuming it must be Blue Pond Farm-House, Dick and Anne go in but the old woman, called Mrs. Taggart, bluntly announces they must leave because her son would not accept either of them. However, once Dick manages to communicate Mrs. Taggart agrees to let Anne stay in a remote loft whilst Dick <b>makes</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> sleeping in the barn.|$|R

This paper presents ideas and prototypes in offer-ing generic support for high-level, flexible, and pro-grammable introspection of software systems. Our hy-pothesis is that “quick-and-dirty ” scripting languages such as Tcl/Tk and Python can be effectively used to create ad-hoc dynamic analyses that help system engi-neers better understand, develop, and maintain their system. 1...|$|R
5|$|Medieval {{society was}} highly stratified. In {{a time when}} famine was commonplace and social {{hierarchies}} were often brutally enforced, food was an important marker of social status {{in a way that}} has no equivalent today in most developed countries. According to the ideological norm, society consisted of the three estates of the realm: commoners, that is, the working classes—by far the largest group; the clergy, and the nobility. The relationship between the classes was strictly hierarchical, with the nobility and clergy claiming worldly and spiritual overlordship over commoners. Within the nobility and clergy there were also a number of ranks ranging from kings and popes to dukes, bishops and their subordinates, such as priests. One was expected to remain in one's social class and to respect the authority of the ruling classes. Political power was displayed not just by rule, but also by displaying wealth. Nobles dined on fresh game seasoned with exotic spices, and displayed refined table manners; rough laborers could <b>make</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> coarse barley bread, salt pork and beans and were not expected to display etiquette. Even dietary recommendations were different: the diet of the upper classes was considered to be as much a requirement of their refined physical constitution as a sign of economic reality. The digestive system of a lord was held to be more discriminating than that of his rustic subordinates and demanded finer foods.|$|E
5|$|Most reviewers {{recommended}} the iPhone 5S over the iPhone 5C which was released {{at the same}} time. The 5C retained almost the same hardware as the discontinued iPhone 5, while the iPhone 5S featured substantially improved performance/features thanks to its new 64-bit A7 processor, as well as extra storage space, all for a relatively small additional upfront cost over the iPhone 5C (US$650 versus US$550 in March 2014). This was especially the case when iOS 8 was released and both iPhone 5S and iPhone 5C were moved to the mid and {{low end of the}} iPhone range, respectively; the iPhone 5S still had 16 or 32 GB storage available while the iPhone 5C had to <b>make</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> 8 GB storage with only 4.9GB available to the user after installing iOS 8. Furthermore, the 5C's polycarbonate exterior received a mixed reception and was seen as a cost-cutting downgrade compared to the iPhone 5's aluminum/glass case; the 5S retained the latter design and looked even more premium due its additional gold finish.|$|E

40|$|Reliable group {{communication}} {{is important for}} large-scale distributed applications such as information dissemination systems. The challenging issue in this context remains scalability.

50|$|They {{are perhaps}} the most disordered of the Laibon, the only type of legacy {{affiliation}} they maintain is the occasional exchange of information if they cross another Akunanse's path.
