Feeding in a creep-feeding system lasted 90 days, divided in three subperiods of 30 days. The body weight gain was {{greater in the}} subperiods 1 and 2 for SAL 10 and SAL 5 treatments, respectively. There were no differences in the third subperiod and, in the overall period, the SAL 10 treatment (0. 91 kg. animal- 1. day- 1) was better than control treatment (0. 81 kg,animal- 1. day- 1).

O primeiro resultado foi que as principais áreas de atuação dos trabalhadores informais são: alimentação, multifuncionalidade e informática. Outro resultado foi que o cruzamento (qui-quadrado) entre os motivos de satisfação, insatisfação e barreiras, de um lado, e idade, escolaridade e tempo de atuação no mercado informal, de outro, revelou significância estatística nos casos: (1) insatisfação e faixa etária, (2) motivos de satisfação e escolaridade, e (3) motivos de satisfação e tempo de trabalho no mercado informal.

OBJETIVO: apresentar de forma sistematizada, Ã  luz de Wanda de Aguiar Horta, as dimensÃµes do cuidado prestado pela enfermeira na {{consulta}} de prÃ©-natal, em um MunicÃ­pio de Santa Catarina, Brasil e identificar as caracterÃ­sticas das enfermeiras e suas atividades na consulta de prÃ©-natal. MÃ TODO: estudo descritivo exploratÃ³rio realizado em um municÃ­pio de mÃ©dio porte no Estado de Santa Catarina. Dois grupos participaram da pesquisa. O primeiro composto por 7 enfermeiras, integrantes da Equipe de EstratÃ©gia de SaÃºde da FamÃ­lia, localizadas em 4 unidades bÃ¡sicas de saÃºde que realizaram consulta de prÃ©-natal de gestantes de risco habitual no ano de 2014. O segundo, composto por 29 gestantes, que foram atendidas nas mesmas unidades bÃ¡sicas de saÃºde, que iniciaram e finalizaram o acompanhamento prÃ©-natal em 2014, foram classificadas como de risco habitual e que tiveram ao menos uma consulta com a enfermeira em cada trimestre gestacional. Os dados foram coletados com um instrumento para cada grupo participante da pesquisa. Para anÃ¡lise foi utilizado o Software Excel versÃ£o 2007 e realizado estatÃ­stica descritiva atravÃ©s de freqÃ¼Ãªncia relativa e absoluta. RESULTADOS: SÃ£o apresentados em dois manuscritos. No primeiro, as enfermeiras em sua maioria, 86 % sÃ£o do sexo feminino, recebem remuneraÃ§Ã£o mensal acima de 4. 000 reais e exercem suas atividades por meio contrato de trabalho por regime celetista. Na atenÃ§Ã£o ao prÃ©-natal realizam consultas de enfermagem, grupos de educaÃ§Ã£o em saÃºde e visitas domiciliares. Possuem ao menos um tÃ­tulo de especializaÃ§Ã£o e 29 % com mestrado. Sua experiÃªncia em saÃºde materna estÃ¡ voltada Ã  atenÃ§Ã£o primÃ¡ria Ã  saÃºde, e 14 % em maternidade. No segundo manuscrito, apresenta-se a mÃ©dia de idade das gestantes que foi de 25, 2 anos. Referente Ã  histÃ³ria gestacional anterior, 55 % das mulheres tiveram ao menos uma gestaÃ§Ã£o anterior, totalizando, 27 (67 %) partos vaginais, 3 (8 %) cesÃ¡reas e 10 (25 %) abortos. A necessidade terapÃªutica obteve maior freqÃ¼Ãªncia de registros se comparado Ã s demais necessidades. Em relaÃ§Ã£o a necessidade de sexualidade, nÃ£o foram identificados registros nos trÃªs trimestres gestacionais. As demais necessidades tiveram freqÃ¼Ãªncias variÃ¡veis de registros ao longo dos trÃªs trimestres gestacionais. CONCLUSÃ O: A enfermeira Ã© estratÃ©gica na atenÃ§Ã£o Ã  saÃºde das gestantes na APS.

Contudo, a observaÃ§Ã£o da falta de registro possibilita subentender que as gestantes nÃ£o foram atendidas em todas as suas necessidades humanas bÃ¡sicas, sendo com maior freqÃ¼Ãªncia, cuidadas em sua necessidade terapÃªutica.

Abstract : OBJECTIVES: {{to present}} a systematic way, according to Wanda de Aguiar Horta, dimensions of care provided by nurses during prenatal appointment, {{in a city of}} Santa Catarina, Brazil. Also identify the characteristics of nurses and their activities in prenatal appointment. METHOD: descriptive exploratory study. Two groups participated in the research. The first consists of 7 nurses, members of the family health strategy team, located in 4 community health centers who performed prenatal appointment to low risk pregnant women in the 2014. The second, consists of 29 women who were met in the same community health centers, who started and finished the prenatal care in 2014, were classified as low risk pregnancy, and who had at least one appointment with the nurse in each trimester. Data were collected with an instrument to each participating research group. Excel software version 2007 was used for analysis and descriptive statistics through relative and absolute frequency. RESULTS: They are presented in two manuscripts. The first, most nurses, 86 % are women, who receive <b>monthly</b> <b>remuneration</b> above 4, 000 reais and exert its activities through brazilian employment contract regime. In prenatal care nurses do appointments, health education groups and home visits. They have at least one specialist title and 29 % with master's degree. Their experience in maternal health is aimed at primary health care, and 14 % in maternities. In the second manuscript, the pregnant women average age was 25. 2 years. Referring to previous gestational history, 55 % of women had at least one previous pregnancy, where 27 (67 %) had vaginal deliveries, 3 (8 %) cesarean section and 10 (25 %) abortions. The therapeutic need had the highest attendance record compared to other needs. Regarding the sexuality need, there were no record in the three trimesters of pregnancy. The other needs had record of varying frequencies throughout the three trimesters of pregnancy. CONCLUSION: Nurse is strategic professional in health care of pregnant women in the primary health care. They are mostly women, married and with corresponding salary to the Brazilian regime. They perform prenatal consultation, home visits and health education groups. They perform their technical autonomy using information, making prescriptions, procedures, orientations and evaluations. However, the observation of lack of record imply that pregnant women were missed in all their basic human needs, but being more frequently cared in their therapeutic need. The exploratory study has the impossibility of comparison as a limitation, however it is indicative for other studies and provides opportunities to use a theory from the Brazilian reality wich explores its application in prenatal appointment...|$|E
