50|$|A {{suitcase}} {{nuclear device}} (also suitcase bomb, backpack nuke, <b>mini-nuke</b> and pocket nuke) is a hypothetical {{tactical nuclear weapon}} which is portable enough that it could use a suitcase as its delivery method.|$|E
5000|$|... 50. The Hellbomb Theft - Camellion {{must stop}} two <b>mini-nukes</b> from {{falling into the}} hands of Kaddafi, the {{dictator}} of Libya.|$|R
50|$|In {{a column}} for WorldNetDaily, Cohen claimed that 100 of these <b>mini-nukes</b> were {{in the hands of}} terrorists, and later that Saddam Hussein had taken {{delivery}} of about fifty of these devices, which he supposedly planned on using against the US forces as they approached Baghdad.|$|R
5000|$|Tanker Bugs - These {{are like}} tanks. They are {{the size of}} houses and breathe fire as their main {{offensive}} weapon. Although they don't move quickly, their ability to tunnel underground allows them to pop up unexpectedly {{in the middle of}} a battle. Their armored exoskeleton makes them impervious to everything except high explosives such as <b>mini-nukes</b> and plasma rockets.|$|R
5000|$|According to the Washington Post, the United States Strategic Command {{contingency}} plan {{for dealing with}} [...] "imminent" [...] threats from countries such as North Korea or Iran is formally known as CONPLAN 8022-02. The plan was reportedly completed in November 2003, resulting in a preemptive and offensive strike capability. The main plan involves the preemptive use of tactical nuclear strikes (<b>mini-nukes)</b> on deep-ground rocket/bomb installations, computer viruses, and radar disruption technology.|$|R
25|$|Jones was a {{founding}} member of Scholars for 9/11 Truth for approximately one year as co-chair with James H. Fetzer. From mid-November 2006 until the end of that year, Jones, Fetzer and a series of other researchers and individuals engaged in a dispute about the direction of the organization. Jones and others examined the claims of James Fetzer and Judy Wood— i.e., that directed energy weapons or <b>mini-nukes</b> destroyed the WTC Towers — and delineated empirical reasons for rejecting them.|$|R
5000|$|Bush, at {{the advice}} of Hadley, also {{proposed}} greater nuclear arms reductions than Gore. Hadley's plan proposed unilaterally {{reducing the number of}} proposed long-range nuclear missiles to around 1,500-2,000 from the then 6,500-7,500, but caveats to this included the abandonment of attempts to get the Senate to ratify the 1996 Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and the development of new low-yield bunker-busting <b>mini-nukes</b> for actual battle-field use. Hartung feared that these steps would [...] "re-start the nuclear arms race" [...] as the US arsenal was upgraded.|$|R
5000|$|In August 2005, Giraldi {{wrote that}} US Vice President Dick Cheney had {{instructed}} STRATCOM to prepare [...] "a contingency {{plan to be}} employed in response to another 9/11-type terrorist attack on the United States... including a large-scale air assault on Iran employing both conventional and tactical nuclear weapons ... not conditional on Iran actually {{being involved in the}} act of terrorism directed against the United States." [...] The reason cited for the attack to use <b>mini-nukes</b> is that the targets are hardened or are deep underground and would not be destroyed by non-nuclear warheads.|$|R
40|$|Constitutions are {{continuous}} {{outcomes of}} power relations. The primary function of any constitution is to manage power, a critical feature {{of which is}} the prevention of destructive conflict. Warfare—including its facilitation by failure to pursue diplomatic avenues in some circumstances, and its promotion through the development of technological horrors such as nuclear weapons, <b>mini-nukes,</b> and other weapons of mass destruction—is the foremost challenge to the viability of an international constitutional system. The collapse of the League of Nations provided the world with a stark lesson in how aggression and warfare can undo a weak international constitutional regime dedicated to peace and security. Following World War II, the United Nations Charter established a new international constitutional system designed to more effectively facilitate cooperation among the major global powers to maintain peace and security. The proliferation of nuclear weapons constrained the Charter as superpowers jockeyed for positions of direct and indirect security influence. Warfare assumed new ideological perspectives, which were tied to claims for decolonization, self-determination, and independence. The Cold War introduced a volatile world order in which high intensity internal and ideological conflicts were fought by surrogates backed by hegemons. The retreat of state absolutism has made room for the growth of civil society, now a central element of the emerging international constitutional order, and the effect on the constitutive process has been both positive and negative. It is generally well accepted that the all powerful state, which lacks checks and balances, transparency, responsibility, and accountability, is a dangerous and destructive political artifact. However, shifting power to civil society may not ameliorate the power problem. Civil society is a nascent form of global democratization. Segments of civil society adhere to particular ideological constructs, which can either improve or worsen world order. These constructs are typically shaped by influential ideologies that object {{to the way in which}} states traditionally enjoy sovereign power, despite, as some argue, the lethal and sometimes economically inefficient ways this power is exercised. Despite these inefficiencies, a dangerous ideology has taken root in the years since the end of the Cold War. Hailed as a “solution” to the problem of state power, the development of private power, particularly in the context of supporting and supplementing military combat, may instead prove to be harmful to the international constitutive process. Privatization of military combat functions is not a novel phenomenon. Some aspects of this form of privatization have indeed been fairly comprehensively analyzed, resulting in many commentaries on the lack of accountability and near absence of regulation of private military and security services, general admonitions against allowing questionably principled private actors driven by profit to capitalize on this regulatory lacuna, and criticisms of the various bloody combat errors committed by Private Military Contractors (PMCs) and Private Security Contractors (PSCs), which, in many cases, have been tantamount to slaughtering innocent bystanders in conflict zones. These commentators and policy makers typically harmonize on the need to enhance regulatory safeguards and overall accountability, as well as to reform the rules governing contractual arrangements between government authorities and PMCs or PSCs. Indeed, it might be argued that the debate surrounding the concept of privatized combat is characterized by an intellectual, scholastic staleness. However, we submit that there are as yet unexamined dangers posed by the military-private industry dyad, and we advocate a total reconsideration of the fundamental realities of the world order implications of PMCs and PSCs in the context of combat functions. Assaying these as yet unexamined global implications of the problem of power as it pertains to PMCs and PSCs presents an uneasy point of analytical departure; such an explorative effort traditionally requires authors to offer some definition of the subject matter in the context of international law and international relations. It further assumes that we can, to some degree, understand and measure these implications...|$|R
