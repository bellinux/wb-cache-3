5000|$|In 1967 and 1968 the MOS SGT {{transistors}} {{had good}} operating characteristics {{demonstrated by the}} C-V (capacitance-voltage) curves when first fabricated and tested, but then became degraded over time or when they were stressed under voltage or temperature, thus rendering them unusable. Gordon Moore, then head of Fairchild's R & D, assigned Andy Grove {{to the task of}} finding out why this promising technology was not working. The number of processing steps and types of solvents and materials used in processing of the semiconductor devices was quite large and any and all of them were suspects in giving off the contaminants, found eventually to be the mobile sodium ions, that might cause transistor C-V degradation because the concentration of the contaminants only had to be in the parts per billion (ppb) range. In order for Fairchild Semiconductor to effect the investigation of the source of the contaminants at such low concentrations they had to send many chemical and source samples to Union Carbide which had the type of equipment to detect such small amounts (neutron activation or <b>mass</b> <b>Spectrography)</b> but this was prohibitively expensive and slow to do with the many samples they had, frustrating and delaying the investigation. As the manager of Fairchild R & D's Chemical Analysis Lab, Bernard invented special techniques and modifications to use less expensive equipment (Flame Spectrophotometer [...] ) to perform the necessary analysis of the many samples ( [...] down to 1 ppb or less [...] ) and published this work in the paper titled [...] "A Method for Determining Sodium Content of Semiconductor Processing Materials" [...] in the Journal of the Electrochemical society in 1968.

However, the PM-bound proteins involved in elicitor-mediated plant defense responses still remain widely unknown. In {{order to get}} more information about PM proteins involved in rice defense responses, we conducted PM proteomic analysis of the rice suspension cells elicited by COS.

40|$|In several {{experimental}} {{procedures in}} bio-informatics, <b>mass</b> <b>spectrography</b> {{is an essential}} step. It is a challenging problem to extract {{as much information as}} possible from the resulting mass spectrogram. Ideally, one starts from a pure substance and desires to determine from the fragment peaks in the spectrogram the structure of the original molecule. One possible strategy is to search in the space of all molecules for molecules that could have generated the observed spectrum. This is a non-trivial computational problem, as the space of 1 all molecules is huge. In this work, we represent the molecules with graphs and we investigate the possibility to use recent and highly efficient graph pattern listing techniques to address this problem. In order to decide whether a molecule could have generated the observed spectrum, one has to take into account two factors. First, there is the a priori likelihood of the molecule. E. g. when analyzing proteins, sequences that are equal or very similar to parts of the genome are more likely than unrelated sequences. Second, it should be taken into account how likely the observed spectrum is, given the proposed molecule. Usually, one hopes that the molecule produces a sufficiently diverse set of fragments so that the massess of many subgraphs of the graph to find are observed. We will focus here on the listing part, i. e. the task to list all molecular graphs in a particular constrained space efficiently and without isomorphic duplicates. In the fields of data mining and graph theory, this problem has been studied in some depth. A rather generic result is given by Ramon and Nijssen, who show that one can list all elements of a monotone graph class with polynomial delay; i. e. such that the time needed between any two solutions is bounded by a polynomial in the input size. A graph class is monotone if it holds for all elements of the class that all subgraphs are also elements. This is typically a good property in the <b>mass</b> <b>spectrography</b> application where all subgraphs of a molecular graph are potentially observed fragments. It allows for focusing {{on the part of the}} search space with the highest likelihood according to a prior model of the fragmentation probabilities. We investigate further possibilities to constrain or direct the search. One can show that it is possible to efficiently list molecules satisfying constraints such as a given total mass, a given total number of atoms of the different types, and a given set of possible degrees of nodes (valencies of atom types). However, listing problems that combine such constraints with the requirement that solutions should contain (or not contain) certain subgraphs (or subgraphs of certain weights) may not be solvable in output-polynomial time. In ongoing work, we also consider the easier case of proteins, which have a linear structure (even though post-translational modifications can generate significant side chains). We'd also like to get a deeper understanding of the fragmentation probabilities as this would allow a better prioritizing in our search methods. status: publishe...|$|E

It {{is assumed that}} higher levels of dealcoholization could negatively affect the organoleptic quality of wine, but little data on this item is available. In the present study, two red wines (cv. Aglianico) with different initial alcohol contents (15. 37 and 13. 28 % v/v), were partially dealcoholized at three levels (- 2, - 3, - 5 % v/v), by a polypropylene hollow fibre membrane contactor apparatus. In order to evaluate if dealcoholized wines differed from the untreated ones, triangle sensory tests were performed. Both - 2 % wines were not perceived as different from the standard wines, while both - 5 % wines were different. Sensory profiles and overall quality ranking were obtained by a selected and trained panel. Dealcoholization caused a modification of the sensory profiles, and the greatest differences were found after a dealcoholization of 5 % v/v.
