2500|$|The poet Max Jacob said {{he came to}} Montparnasse to [...] "sin disgracefully", but Marc Chagall {{summed it}} up {{differently}} when he explained why {{he had gone to}} Montparnasse: [...] "I aspired to see with my own eyes what I had heard of from so far away: this revolution of the eye, this rotation of colours, which spontaneously and astutely merge with one another in a flow of conceived lines. That could not be seen in <b>my</b> <b>town.</b> The sun of Art then shone only on Paris." ...|$|E
2500|$|Soon {{afterward}} I {{resolved to}} visit <b>my</b> <b>town</b> of Taal; nothing {{was left of}} it except {{the walls of the}} church and convento. All the rest, the government house, the walks of the rope factory, the warehouse, everything was buried beneath a layer of stones, mud, and ashes more than 10 spans [...] thick; only here and there could be seen an upright post, the only remnant of a comfortable dwelling. I went down to the river and found it completely filled up, with a boat belonging to the alcalde and many of private persons buried in the mud. After incredible efforts I finally succeeded in unearthing in what had once been the church and sacristy, the chests which contained the sacred vestments and vessels. Nearly all of them were demolished by the rocks and beams which had fallen upon them, and filled with foul-smelling mud that had ruined or disfigured their contents. With the aid of some natives of Bauang, I likewise recovered some property from among the ruins of the convento.|$|E
