5|$|Although Georgia has no {{significant}} oil or gas reserves, its territory hosts {{part of the}} Baku–Tbilisi–Ceyhan pipeline supplying Europe. Russia, Iran and the Persian Gulf countries were against {{the construction of the}} pipeline. The pipeline circumvents both Russia and Iran. Because it has decreased Western dependence on Middle Eastern oil, the pipeline has been a <b>major</b> <b>factor</b> <b>in</b> the United States' support for Georgia.|$|E
5|$|In May 2003, The New York Times {{reporter}} Jayson Blair {{was forced}} to resign from the newspaper after he was caught plagiarizing and fabricating elements of his stories. Some critics contended that African-American Blair's race was a <b>major</b> <b>factor</b> <b>in</b> his hiring and in The New York Times initial reluctance to fire him.|$|E
5|$|Insects are a <b>major</b> <b>factor</b> <b>in</b> the low {{yields of}} African cowpea crops, and they affect each tissue {{component}} and developmental {{stage of the}} plant. In bad infestations insect pressure is responsible for over 90% loss in yield. The legume pod borer, Maruca vitrata, is the main pre-harvest pest of the cowpea. Other important pests include pod sucking bugs, thrips and the post-harvest cowpea weevil, Callosobruchus maculatus.|$|E

5|$|MU5 was {{designed}} to be about 20 times faster than Atlas, and was optimised for running compiled programs rather than hand-written machine code, something that contemporary computers were unable to do efficiently. A <b>major</b> <b>factor</b> <b>in</b> the MU5's much-improved performance over its predecessors was its incorporation of associative memory, which greatly speeded up access to its main store.|$|E
5|$|Meyerbeer's costly operas, {{requiring}} grand casts {{of leading}} singers, were gradually {{dropped from the}} repertoire in the early 20th century. They were banned in Germany from 1933, and subsequently in subject countries, by the Nazi regime because the composer was Jewish, {{and this was a}} <b>major</b> <b>factor</b> <b>in</b> their further disappearance from the repertory.|$|E

5|$|The El Niño–Southern Oscillation is a <b>major</b> <b>factor</b> <b>in</b> the {{variation}} of annual precipitation within Buenos Aires and the Pampas, particularly during spring and summer. During an El Niño year, precipitation is higher, {{with a significant}} increase in precipitation from November to January. In contrast, La Niña years are associated with lower precipitation; precipitation is below average during October–December.|$|E
5|$|A 2009 report, {{authored}} by Justice Manmohan Singh Liberhan, found that 68 people {{were responsible for}} the demolition, mostly leaders from the BJP. Among those named were Vajpayee, Advani, and Murli Manohar Joshi. The report also criticised Kalyan Singh, Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh during the demolition. He was accused of posting bureaucrats and police officers who would stay silent during the demolition. Anju Gupta, an Indian Police Service officer in charge of Advani's security, appeared as a prominent witness before the commission. She said that Advani and Joshi made provocative speeches that were a <b>major</b> <b>factor</b> <b>in</b> the mob's behaviour.|$|E

5|$|During {{the early}} 2000s, {{orangutan}} habitat has decreased rapidly due to logging and forest fires, {{as well as}} fragmentation by roads. A <b>major</b> <b>factor</b> <b>in</b> {{that period of time}} has been the conversion of vast areas of tropical forest to palm oil plantations in response to international demand. Palm oil is used for cooking, cosmetics, mechanics, and biodiesel. Hunting is also a major problem as is the illegal pet trade.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the setbacks at the Defile, Marj Ardabil and other similar disasters, the need to reinforce the buckling frontiers stretched the military and financial resources of the Caliphate. This was especially the case with the powerful Syrian army, the main pillar of the Umayyad regime, which was parcelled out to reinforce distant provinces. Eventually, this weakening of the Syrian army would be the <b>major</b> <b>factor</b> <b>in</b> the fall of the Umayyad dynasty during the civil wars of the 740s and the Abbasid Revolution that followed them.|$|E
5|$|Language {{varieties}} of Toraja, including Kalumpang, Mamasa, Tae, Talondo, Toala, and Toraja-Sa'dan, {{belong to the}} Malayo-Polynesian language from the Austronesian family. At the outset, the isolated geographical nature of Tana Toraja formed many dialects between the Toraja languages themselves. After the formal administration of Tana Toraja, some Toraja dialects {{have been influenced by}} other languages through the transmigration program, introduced since the colonialism period, and it has been a <b>major</b> <b>factor</b> <b>in</b> the linguistic variety of Toraja languages.|$|E

5|$|Malaria is {{not just}} a disease {{commonly}} associated with poverty: some evidence suggests that it is also a cause of poverty and a major hindrance to economic development. Although tropical regions are most affected, malaria's furthest influence reaches into some temperate zones that have extreme seasonal changes. The disease has been associated with major negative economic effects on regions where it is widespread. During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, it was a <b>major</b> <b>factor</b> <b>in</b> the slow economic development of the American southern states.|$|E
5|$|On 11th May, William and Mary {{formally}} {{accepted the}} Scottish throne and on 5th June, the Convention was {{converted into a}} full Parliament. William tried to avoid abolishing Episcopacy but Dundee's 1689 Highland campaign on behalf of James highlighted his reliance on Presbyterian support. He withdrew his opposition and the measures were approved by Parliament in 1690. The Glorious Revolution in Scotland resulted in a Parliament and Kirk far more independent than before but ending Episcopacy isolated {{a significant part of}} the political class. This was a <b>major</b> <b>factor</b> <b>in</b> political debates over the 1707 Act of Union and the Scottish Jacobite movement.|$|E
5|$|The lack {{of flight}} {{recorder}} {{data for the}} last six minutes of the flight added significant complexity to the investigation and was a <b>major</b> <b>factor</b> <b>in</b> its lengthy duration. The Transportation Safety Board team had to reconstruct the last six minutes of flight entirely from the physical evidence. As the aircraft was broken into 2 million pieces by the impact, this process was time-consuming and tedious. The investigation became the largest and most expensive transport accident investigation in Canadian history, costing C$57 million (US$48.5 million) over five years.|$|E

5|$|Western Christianity, {{particularly}} {{through its}} monasteries, was a <b>major</b> <b>factor</b> <b>in</b> preserving classical civilisation, with its art (see Illuminated manuscript) and literacy. Through his Rule, Benedict of Nursia (c.480–543), {{one of the}} founders of Western monasticism, exerted an enormous influence on European culture through the appropriation of the monastic spiritual heritage of the early Church and, with the spread of the Benedictine tradition, through the preservation and transmission of ancient culture. During this period, monastic Ireland became a centre of learning and early Irish missionaries such as St Columbanus and St Columba spread Christianity and established monasteries across continental Europe.|$|E
5|$|Although airpower {{was to be}} a <b>major</b> <b>factor</b> <b>in</b> {{the defense}} of Lima Site 85, it could not be applied without {{limitations}} and restrictions. The defense of Lima Site 85 was not the sole focus of limited air resources at the time. During this period, the 1968 Tet Offensive was underway in South Vietnam, the Marine outpost at Khe Sanh was under siege, and there existed an unprecedented flow of enemy logistical traffic which had to be interdicted. Lima Site 85 had provided direction to {{about a quarter of the}} USAF missions over North Vietnam and Barrel Roll from November1967 to 11March1968. No other facility existed to provide a similar coverage over these areas. While this loss was a serious blow to the USAF air effort, it was not crippling.|$|E
