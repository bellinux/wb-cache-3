Perhaps it refers to glass imitations of jewellery gemstones. He refers to using one hard mineral to scratch another, presaging the <b>Mohs</b> <b>hardness</b> scale.

5|$|Lead is a {{very soft}} metal with a <b>Mohs</b> <b>hardness</b> of 1.5; it can be {{scratched}} with a fingernail. It is quite malleable and somewhat ductile. The bulk modulus of lead—a measure of its ease of compressibility—is 45.8GPa. In comparison, that of aluminium is 75.2GPa; copper 137.8GPa; and mild steel 160–169GPa. Lead's tensile strength, at 12–17 MPa, is low (that of aluminium is 6 times higher, copper 10 times, and mild steel 15 times higher); it can be strengthened by adding small amounts of copper or antimony.|$|E
5|$|The {{density of}} {{individual}} particles varies with different eruptions. The density of volcanic ash varies between 700–1200kg/m3 for pumice, 2350–2450kg/m3 for glass shards, 2700–3300kg/m3 for crystals, and 2600–3200kg/m3 for lithic particles. Since coarser and denser particles are deposited close to source, fine glass and pumice shards are relatively enriched in ash fall deposits at distal locations. The high density and hardness (~5 on the <b>Mohs</b> <b>Hardness</b> Scale) {{together with a}} high degree of angularity, make some types of volcanic ash (particularly those with a high silica content) very abrasive.|$|E
5|$|Indium is a silvery-white, highly ductile post-transition metal with {{a bright}} luster. It is so soft (<b>Mohs</b> <b>hardness</b> 1.2) that like sodium, it can be cut with a knife. It also leaves a visible line on paper. It {{is a member of}} group 13 on the {{periodic}} table and its properties are mostly intermediate between its vertical neighbours gallium and thallium. Like tin, a high-pitched cry is heard when indium is bent – a crackling sound due to crystal twinning. Like gallium, indium is able to wet glass. Like both, indium has a low melting point, 156.60°C (313.88°F); higher than its lighter homologue, gallium, but lower than its heavier homologue, thallium, and lower than tin. The boiling point is 2072°C (3762°F), higher than that of thallium, but lower than gallium, conversely to the general trend of melting points, but similarly to the trends down the other post-transition metal groups because of the weakness of the metallic bonding with few electrons delocalized.|$|E

25|$|The {{large amount}} of mineral in enamel {{accounts}} {{not only for its}} strength but also for its brittleness.

Dentin, less mineralized and less brittle, 3–4 in hardness, compensates for enamel and is necessary as a support. On radiographs, the differences in the mineralization of different portions of the tooth and surrounding periodontium can be noted; enamel appears lighter than dentin or pulp since it is denser than both and more radiopaque.|$|E

Additionally, jade was used for adze heads, knives, and other weapons, which can be delicately shaped.

Jadeite measures between 6.0 and 7.0 <b>Mohs</b> <b>hardness,</b> and nephrite between 6.0 and 6.5, {{so it can be}} worked with quartz or garnet sand, and polished with bamboo or even ground jade.|$|E

Sapphire, ruby, and pure corundum are α-alumina, the most stable form of Al2O3, in which 3 electrons leave each aluminum ion to join the regular octahedral group of six nearby O2− ions; in pure corundum this leaves all of the aluminum ions with a very stable configuration of no unpaired electrons or unfilled energy levels, and the crystal is perfectly colorless.|$|E
25|$|The finest of {{turquoise}} {{reaches a}} maximum <b>Mohs</b> <b>hardness</b> of just under 6, or slightly more than window glass. Characteristically a cryptocrystalline mineral, turquoise almost never forms single crystals, {{and all of its}} properties are highly variable. X-ray diffraction testing shows its crystal system to be triclinic. With lower hardness comes lower specific gravity (2.60–2.90) and greater porosity: These properties are dependent on grain size. The lustre of turquoise is typically waxy to subvitreous, and transparency is usually opaque, but may be semitranslucent in thin sections. Colour is as variable as the mineral's other properties, ranging from white to a powder blue to a sky blue, and from a blue-green to a yellowish green. The blue is attributed to idiochromatic copper while the green {{may be the result of}} either iron impurities (replacing aluminium) or dehydration.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Rock surface {{hardness}} {{is often used}} {{as an indicator of}} the degree to which a rock surface has weathered. As the surface deteriorates the loss of cohesion results in crumbling of the surface, increased pore water circulation and dislodging of sections such as flakes. It is widely assumed that this results in a lowering of rock {{surface hardness}}. However, hardness can also increase if weathering leads to cementation of the surface due to the deposition of solutes such as quartz, clays and small quantities of carbonates. A number of different instruments are available to map out hardness distributions and changes over time. This chapter outlines the use of a simple field test (<b>Moh’s</b> <b>hardness</b> test), three rebound devices (Picolo, Equotip and Schmidt Hammer) and resistance drilling as possible methods for assessing rock surface hardness...|$|R
