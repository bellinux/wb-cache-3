25|$|A {{wireless}} network consists of nodes (each {{of which is}} a transmitter, receiver or both, depending on the system) that produce, relay or consume data within the network. For example, base stations and users in a cellular phone network or sensor nodes in a sensor network. Before developing stochastic geometry wireless models, models are required for mathematically representing the signal propagation and the node positioning. The propagation model captures how signals propagate from transmitters to receivers. The node location or positioning model (idealizes and) represents the positions of the nodes as a point process. The choice of these models depends {{on the nature of the}} {{wireless network}} and its environment. The network type depends on such factors as the specific architecture (for instance cellular) and the channel or <b>medium</b> <b>access</b> <b>control</b> (MAC) protocol, which controls the channels and, hence, the communicating structures of the network. In particular, to prevent the collision of transmissions in the network, the MAC protocol dictates, based on certain rules, when transmitter-receiver pairs can access the network both in time and space, which also affects the active node positioning model.|$|E

The longer cycle time means that the ONUs have to wait longer before the next transmission window arrives thus contributing to longer packet delays and poorer QoS.

40|$|Sensor {{networks}} have many potential applications in biology, physics, medi-cine, and the military. One major challenge in sensor networks is to maximize network life under the constraint of limited power supply. The paper addresses energy-efficiency {{in the context}} of routing and data gathering. A new protocol is proposed: Hybrid Indirect Transmission (HIT). HIT is based on a hybrid ar-chitecture that consists of one or more clusters, each of which is based on mul-tiple, multi-hop indirect transmissions. In order to minimize both energy con-sumption and network delay, parallel transmissions are used both among mul-tiple clusters and within a cluster. This is made possible by having each sensor independently compute a <b>medium</b> <b>access</b> <b>controlling</b> TDMA schedule. The com-putation within each sensor is intelligent yet simple. Formal analysis shows that it requires O(n) space and O(nu logn) time complexities, and O(1) setup mes-sages prior to the computation, where n is the total number of sensors.

40|$|Networked {{control over}} {{wireless}} sensor and actuator systems is of growing importancein many application domains. Energy and communication bandwidth are scarce resources in such systems. Despite that feedback control might only be needed occasionally, sensor and actuator communications are often periodic and with high frequency in today’s implementations. In this thesis, resource-constrained wireless networked control systems with an adaptive sampling period are considered. Our first contribution {{is a system}} architecture for aperiodic wireless networked control. As the underlying data transmission is performed over a shared wireless network, we identify scheduling policies and <b>medium</b> <b>access</b> <b>controls</b> that allow for an efficient implementation of sensor communication. We experimentally validate three proposed mechanisms and show that best performance is obtained by a hybrid scheme, combining the advantages of event- and self-triggered control {{as well as the}} possibilities provided by contention-based and contention-free medium accesscontrol. In the second contribution, we propose an event-triggered PI controller for wireless process control systems. A novel triggering mechanism which decides the transmission instants based on an estimate of the control signal is proposed. It addresses some side-effects that have been discovered in previous PI proposals, which trigger {{on the state of the}} process. Through simulations we demonstrate that the new PI controller provides setpoint tracking and disturbance rejection close to a periodic PI controller, while reducing the required network resources. The third contribution proposes a co-design of feedback controllers and wireless <b>medium</b> <b>access.</b> The co-design is formulated as a constrained optimization problem, whereby the objective function is the energy consumption of the network and the constraints are the packet loss probability and delay, which are derived from the performance requirements of the control systems.

40|$|Abstract — While the {{practical}} coding scheme [1] {{has been shown}} to be able to improve throughput of wireless networks, there still lacks fundamental understanding on how the coding scheme works under realistic settings, namely, when it operates on a realistic physical layer and the <b>medium</b> <b>access</b> is <b>controlled</b> by some random access methods. In this paper, we provide a formal analysis on the performance of {{the practical}} coding scheme under such realistic settings. The key performance measure is the encoding number, i. e., the number of packets that can be encoded by a coding node in each transmission. We provide an upper bound on the encoding number for the general coding topology, and derive the average encoding number and system throughput for a general class of random access mechanisms. Based on the practical coding scheme, we also derive a tighter upper bound on the throughput gain for a general wireless network. Our results can be particularly useful for coding-related MAC/Routing protocol design and analysis. I...|$|R
40|$|The {{increasing}} demand for last mile high speed internet access {{has contributed to}} the popularity of the broadband wireless access (BW A) systems for fulfilling such requirement since they can realized it with lower cost compared to the wired solutions. WiMAX which is based on the IEEE 802. 16 standard {{and is one of the}} latest offerings in the BW A systems promises to provide high speed access with Quality of Service (QoS) support. Different service classes are defined together with their associated QoS parameters in order to support different types of user applications. However, no scheduling architecture is defined to guarantee these defined QoS requirements. In this thesis, a scheduling algorithm which observes the QoS requirements of all service classes in both uplink and downlink directions has been proposed. Using the service class type to determine the priority for transmission and the calculation of required slots, the QoS of users from higher service- classes could be guaranteed without starving users from the lowest service class. To gain from multiuser diversity, channel-aware scheduling algorithm based on cross-layer optimization in band Adaptive Modulation and Coding (AMC) has also been developed. The algorithm not only aims to fulfil the QoS requirements and increase the system throughput but also aims to be practical and conform to the standard. Instead of finding the optimal solution which is too complex for practical implementation a suboptimal solution using heuristic method has been proposed. The cross-layer approach has been extended to provide cross-system optimization in which WiMAX and WiFi networks are selected for the case study. The optimization between the <b>Medium</b> <b>Access</b> <b>Controls</b> (MACs) of the two networks has been facilitated by QoS mapping of the application types between the two networks. Combined with the cross-layer optimization, the system throughput could be increased while guaranteeing the end-to-end QoS. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

However, time-triggered protocols not only adds extra complexity because related to maintainence of glabal time but also incure a penalty in network utilitisation due to temporal padding. To relieve thoes issues, we introduce a node ordering concept in which a strict node order is defined and the order of communication events is established by this pre-configured order instead of global time. Thus what is required is maintaining the node order only. Based on such a concept, we propose Node Ordering Protocol (NOP) in which <b>medium</b> <b>access</b> is <b>controled</b> by strict node ordering. In NOP, there is no concept of global time and communication activities are event-triggered. So NOP eliminates the interval reserved for keeping temporal order and can saturates the network in the general case. In this paper, we first desribe communication semantics of NOP. Then the fault hypothesis is analysed and error detection and handling is introduced in detail. Finally, we supplement consideration in proctical implementation of NOP. ...|$|R
