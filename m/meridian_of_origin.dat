5000|$|Indeed, {{even the}} Greenwich {{meridian}} {{itself is not}} quite {{what it used to}} be—defined by [...] "the centre of the transit instrument at the Observatory at Greenwich". Although that instrument still survives in working order, it is no longer in use and now the <b>meridian</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> of the world's longitude and time is not strictly defined in material form but from a statistical solution resulting from observations of all time-determination stations which the BIPMtakes into account when co-ordinating the world's time signals. Nevertheless, the line in the old observatory's courtyard today differs {{no more than a few}} metres from that imaginary line which is now the prime meridian of the world. Howse, D. (1997).

5000|$|A {{position}} on the Earth is given by the UTM zone number and the easting and northing planar coordinate pair in that zone. The point <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> each UTM zone is {{the intersection of the}} equator and the zone's central meridian. To avoid dealing with negative numbers, the central <b>meridian</b> <b>of</b> each zone is defined to coincide with [...] meters East. In any zone a point that has an easting of [...] meters is about 100 km west <b>of</b> the central <b>meridian.</b> For most such points, the true distance would be slightly more than 100 km as measured {{on the surface of the}} Earth due to the distortion of the projection. UTM eastings range from about [...] meters to [...] meters at the equator.|$|R
