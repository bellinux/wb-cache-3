5|$|Little {{progress}} was made the next day as Byng directed that the focus for the day was to simply consolidate the gains made and prepare for a further <b>movement</b> <b>forward</b> on 23 August. The relative inactivity of 22 August encouraged von Below in {{a belief that the}} attacks of the previous day were a failure. Seeking to take advantage, he arranged for counterattacks to be mounted by the 17th Army, and these resulted in the loss of Dovecot, which overlooked the New Zealand positions. The machine gun battalion of 42nd Division provided key support in driving off the counterattacks which, according to prisoners of war captured during the action, was launched by 52nd Infantry Division, largely made up of men from the Grand Duchy of Baden, which had newly arrived in the sector from Flanders.|$|E

On 21 March, the 6th Brigade mounted a nighttime attack on a feature known as Point 201, which was defended by Italian forces.

25|$|The French {{army was}} {{composed}} of three Army Groups. The 2nd and 3rd Army Groups defended the Maginot Line to the east; the 1st Army Group under Gaston Billotte was situated {{in the west and}} would execute the <b>movement</b> <b>forward</b> into the Low Countries. Initially positioned on the left flank near the coast, the Seventh Army, reinforced by a Divisions Légères Méchanique (DLM), was intended to move to the Netherlands via Antwerp. Next to the south were the motorised divisions of the BEF, which would advance to the Dyle Line and position itself {{to the right of the}} Belgian army, from Leuven (Louvain) to Wavre. The First Army, reinforced by two light mechanised divisions and with a Division Cuirassée de Réserve (DCR, Reserve Armoured Division) in reserve, would defend the Gembloux Gap between Wavre and Namur. The southernmost army involved in the move forward into Belgium was the French Ninth Army, which had to cover the Meuse sector between Namur to the north of Sedan.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{reaching}} Company E {{with the}} forward observer's party, Fissel {{observed that the}} greatest volume of fire {{was coming from the}} east side of the trail, in the direction of Piva River, promptly calling for an artillery concentration in that area. Receiving conflicting reports, in order to obtain more accurate information, Smoak pushed his command post forward into the edge of the coconut grove through which the Numa Numa Trail ran. Fissel was able to make contact with Smoak and advised that Company E needed help immediately. After a quick reconnaissance, Smoak ordered Company F to pass through Company E, resume the attack, and allow Company E to withdraw, reorganize, and take up a protective position on the battalion's right flank. Company G—which had reached a position to the left of Company E—was ordered to hold its position. Company F began its <b>movement</b> <b>forward,</b> and Company E—finding an opportunity to disengage itself—began a withdrawal, redeploying on the right of the battalion's position. Company F failed to make contact with either Company E or Company G.|$|E
25|$|<b>Movement</b> <b>forward</b> to the British {{positions}} {{was difficult}} in daylight, {{due to a}} lack of communication trenches, so Indian troops moved along wet ditches in the dark and conducted the relief over two nights. Exchanging two battalions took about 2½ hours and a German attack on 30 October pushed a Gurkha battalion back and exposed the flank of the neighbouring battalion until a counter-attack could be arranged to regain the line. Early on 31 October, Willcocks, the Indian Corps commander, took over from Smith-Dorrien from Givenchy to Fauquissart, who left about ten severely depleted infantry battalions and most of the corps artillery behind. The II Corps troops had been promised ten days to rest but troop movements towards Wytschaete began immediately, some on foot and some by bus. On 1 November the last seven battalions in the area were sent north to Bailleul behind III Corps. The 5th Division artillery was sent north to the Cavalry Corps by 2 November and the remaining II Corps engineer companies built more field fortifications.|$|E

Wrigley's force had a long and exhausting approach, and much of its <b>movement</b> <b>forward</b> to its jump off point had been under Italian shellfire intended for the 16th Infantry Brigade. Awaiting its turn to move, the force sought shelter in Wadi Scemmas and its tributaries. Wrigley called a final coordinating conference for 1030, but at 1020 he was wounded by a bullet and his second in command, Major G. E. Sell took over.

500|$|The {{creeping}} barrage was a barrage that lifted in small increments, perhaps , {{so that it}} moved forward slowly, keeping pace with the infantry, who were trained to follow close behind the moving wall of their own fire, often as close as infantry commanders were encouraged to keep their troops {{as close to the}} barrage as possible, even at the risk of casualties from friendly fire. A {{creeping barrage}} could maintain the element of surprise, with guns opening fire only shortly before the assault troops moved off. It was useful when enemy positions had not been thoroughly reconnoitred, as it did not depend on identifying individual targets in advance. The idea behind the creeping barrage was that the infantry should reach the enemy positions before the defenders had time to recover, emerge from shelters, and man their positions. On {{the first day of the}} battle of the Somme, the barrage outpaced the infantry, allowing the defenders to recover and emerge from their dugouts, with disastrous results for the attackers. The creeping barrage demonstrated its effectiveness a year later, in 1917, during the battle of Arras. A weakness of the creeping barrage was that the infantry was subordinated to the artillery schedule, while the infantry commanders had less control over the tactical situation and were therefore in danger of forgetting how to manoeuvre their troops around the battlefield. The importance of the barrage was such that traditional infantry tactics, including a reliance on the infantry's own firepower to support its <b>movement</b> <b>forward,</b> was sometimes forgotten.|$|E

500|$|At 8:45 a.m. the Newfoundland Regiment and 1st Battalion of the Essex Regiment {{received}} {{orders to}} move forward. The Newfoundland Regiment was situated at St. John's Road, a support trench [...] behind the British forward line {{and out of}} sight of the enemy. <b>Movement</b> <b>forward</b> through the communication trenches was not possible because they were congested with dead and wounded men and under shell fire. Lieutenant Colonel Arthur Lovell Hadow, the battalion commander, decided to move immediately into attack formation and advance across the surface, which involved first navigating through the British barbed wire defences. As they breasted the skyline behind the British first line, they were effectively the only troops moving on the battlefield and clearly visible to the German defenders. Subjected to the full force of the 119th (Reserve) Infantry Regiment, most of the Newfoundland Regiment who had started forward were dead, dying or wounded within 15 to 20 minutes of leaving St. John's Road trench. Most reached no further than the Danger Tree, a skeleton of a tree that lay in No Man's Land that was being utilized as a landmark. So far as can be ascertained, 22 officers and 758 other ranks were directly involved in the advance. Of these, all the officers and slightly under 658 other ranks became casualties. Of the 780 men who went forward only about 110 survived unscathed, of whom only 68 were available for roll call the following day. For all intents and purposes the Newfoundland Regiment had been wiped out, the unit as a whole having suffered a casualty rate of approximately 80%. The only unit to suffer greater casualties during the attack was the 10th Battalion of the West Yorkshire Regiment, attacking west of Fricourt village.|$|E

40|$|By {{means of}} bone-marrow tissue cultnre the author studies the {{movement}} of the specific granules of pseudo-eosinophils and eosinophils in normal rabbits, and obtained the following results: 1. The movement cycles of these cells are classified into the original stage, the preparatory stage, the pseudopodia formation stage, the migratory stage of the main body, the stage of caudal retraction, and the stage of distribution of granules. 2. The types of the granular movement are classified into the molecular movement, linear formation advance, advance line after line, and semi-radial linear <b>forward</b> <b>movement,</b> zigzag <b>forward</b> <b>movement,</b> disproportionate linear forwad movement with semi-crescent front, circular movement, reverse-flow movement, alternate movement, individual movement, and irregular movement. and in addition, are included the rapid advance immediately after the nucleus advance and the rapid <b>forward</b> <b>movement</b> after passing through holes as the behaviors of the granular movements. However, the main granular movement is the linear formation advance. 3. The molecular and irregular movements can hardly be observed in eosinophils, but the advance line by iine, semiradial linear <b>forward</b> <b>movement,</b> and zigzag <b>forward</b> <b>movement</b> can be observed in eosinophils at the time of semi-radial movement of the cell. The reverseflow mevement may be observed either at pseudopodia or at the tail end, and as an atypical one, a movement in opposite direction may be observed. There is no marked difference in the rate of appearance of various granular movements from the duration of tissue culture. 4. The granular movement is not automatic, but it is {{the movement of}} granules riding on the current of cytoplasma. 5. The molecular movement is not necessarily involved in the negativity of the cell movement, but it seems to indicate the potential motive power...|$|R

Rosecrans sent a questionnaire to his corps and division commanders in the hopes of documenting support for his positionthat Bragg had so far detached no significant forces to Johnston in Mississippi, that advancing the Army of the Cumberland would do nothing to prevent any such transfer, and that any immediate advance was not a good idea. Fifteen of the seventeen senior generals supported most of Rosecrans's positions and the counsel against advancing was unanimous. The only dissenter was the newly assigned chief of staff, Brig. Gen. James A. Garfield, who recommended an immediate advance. On June 16, Halleck wired a blunt message: [...] "Is it your intention to make an immediate <b>movement</b> <b>forward?</b> A definite answer, yes or no, is required." [...] Rosecrans responded to this ultimatum: [...] "If immediate means tonight or tomorrow, no. If it means as soon as all things are ready, say five days, yes."
