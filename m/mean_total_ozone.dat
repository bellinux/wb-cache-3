40|$|A more {{detailed}} {{examination of the}} TOMS observations reveals {{a number of important}} aspects of the Antarctic ozone depletion. First, it is noted that the presence of large scale disturbances {{around the edge of the}} ozone hole can lead to highly variable station observations. Second, an examination of the zonal <b>mean</b> <b>total</b> <b>ozone</b> for the seven Octobers shows that the large systematic decline is not simply confined to the polar region but exists at midlatitudes as well. Integrations of the total ozone from the South Pole northwards show that a portion of the systematic trend of decreasing Antarctic total ozone (prior to 1985) seems to be due to a redistribution of total ozone to subpolar and midlatitude regions. That is, decreases at high latitudes are compensated by increases at lower latitudes. The correlation between zonal <b>mean</b> <b>total</b> <b>ozone</b> and 70 mb zonal mean temperatures from polar to midlatitudes shows that the systematic decreases in total ozone is well correlated with a systematic decrease in stratospheric temperatures...|$|E

In this regard, {{a series of}} total ozone content measurements were carried out in Athens, Greece for air-mass values (μ) extending up to μ = 5. The monochromatic-heterochromatic stray light derived by Basher's model was used in order to evaluate the specific instrumental parameters which determine if this instrument suffers from this problem or not. The results obtained indicate that the measurements made by the Dobson instrument of the Athens station for air mass values up to 2. 5, underestimates the total ozone content by 3. 5 DU in average, or about 1 % of the station's <b>mean</b> <b>total</b> <b>ozone</b> content (TOC). The comparison {{of the values of}} the same parameters measured 15 years ago with the present ones indicates the good maintenance of the Dobson spectrophotometer No. 118.

40|$|Abstract. The wintertime {{ozone buildup}} over the Northern Hemisphere (NH) {{midlatitudes}} and its {{connection with the}} mean meridional circulation in the stratosphere are examined statistically {{on a monthly basis}} from October to March (1980 – 2002). The ozone buildup begins locally in October with positive total ozone tendencies over the North Pacific, which spread eastward and westward in November and finally cover all midlatitudes in December. The local onset of the buildup in October is not evident in zonal mean ozone tendency, which is close to zero. From November to March, zonal <b>mean</b> <b>total</b> <b>ozone</b> tendency (50 ◦ – 60 ◦ N) shows a strong correlation (|r|= 0. 7) with several zonal mean parameters associated to the mean meridional circulation, namely: eddy heat flux, temperature tendency, the vertical residual velocity and the residual streamfunction.

In a reply by Schoeberl and Stolarski, additional TOMS observations are reported which suggest that some uncompensated ozone loss may be occurring in the spring Antarctic in the most recent years.

40|$|International audienceGlobal {{total ozone}} {{measurements}} from various satellite instruments such as SBUV, TOMS, and GOME show {{an increase in}} zonal <b>mean</b> <b>total</b> <b>ozone</b> at NH mid to high latitudes since the mid-nineties. This increase could be expected from the peaking and start of decline in the effective stratospheric halogen loading, but the rather rapid increase observed in NH zonal <b>mean</b> <b>total</b> <b>ozone</b> suggests that another physical mechanism such as winter planetary wave activity has increased {{which has led to}} higher stratospheric Arctic temperatures. This has enhanced ozone transport into higher latitudes in recent years as part of the residual circulation {{and at the same time}} reduced the frequency of cold Arctic winters with enhanced polar ozone loss. Results from various multi-variate linear regression analyses using SBUV V 8 total ozone with explanatory variables such as a linear trend or, alternatively, EESC (effective equivalent stratospheric chlorine) and on the other hand planetary wave driving (eddy heat flux) or, alternatively, polar ozone loss (PSC volume) in addition to proxies for stratospheric aerosol loading, QBO, and solar cycle, all considered to be main drivers for ozone variability, are presented. It is shown that the main contribution to the recent increase in NH total ozone is from the combined effect of rising tropospheric driven planetary wave activity associated with reduced polar ozone loss at high latitudes as well as increasing solar activity. This conclusion can be drawn regardless of the use of linear trend or EESC terms in our statistical model. It is also clear that more years of data will be needed to further improve our estimates of the relative contributions of the individual processes to decadal ozone variability. The question remains if the observed increase in planetary wave driving is part of the natural decadal atmospheric variability or will persist.

The photochemical decay rate is found to be identical between the two hemispheres. High predictability of ozone through late summer exists based on the late-spring values.

40|$|The {{impact of}} tropospheric {{aerosols}} on the retrieval of column ozone amounts using spaceborne measurements of {{backscattered ultraviolet radiation}} is examined. Using radiative transfer calculations, we show that uv-absorbing desert dust may introduce errors as large as 10 % in ozone column amount, depending on the aerosol layer height and optical depth. Smaller errors are produced by carbonaceous aerosols that result from biomass burning. Though the error is produced by complex interactions between ozone absorption (both stratospheric and tropospheric), aerosol scattering, and aerosol absorption, a surprisingly simple correction procedure reduces the error to about 1 %, {{for a variety of}} aerosols and {{for a wide range of}} aerosol loading. Comparison of the corrected TOMS data with operational data indicates that though the zonal <b>mean</b> <b>total</b> <b>ozone</b> derived from TOMS are not significantly affected by these errors, localized affects in the tropics can be large enough to seriously affect the studies of tropospheric ozone that are currently undergoing using the TOMS data...|$|E

It is shown that a substantial part of the observed variability of total ozone is reproduced by the model, despite uncertainties in the heating rates and without any special attempts to obtain consistent eddy diffusion or otherwise to tune the model. Results indicate that the temperature dependence of the ozone gas phase chemistry plays a negligible role in explaining the observed interannual variations in total ozone. A large part of the variability can be explained by the year-to-year differences in the transport circulation.

40|$|Ninth-degree spherical {{harmonic}} {{models are}} used to represent monthly <b>mean</b> <b>total</b> columnar <b>ozone</b> fields, with spatial spectra {{defined in terms of}} simple analytic expressions representing the rms value of each spherical harmonic coefficient. The spectra are combined with estimation theory techniques to develop a realistic error analysis accounting for errors due to nonglobal coverage. Amplitude and phase variations for longitudinal waves one, two and three are presented, and it is shown that these waves reinforce in space and time in the period of high poleward ozone transport in the northern hemisphere. In the southern hemisphere, the wave two and three components are much smaller, with wave one maximum amplitude occurring in September and October...|$|R
40|$|The daily averages {{of total}} column amount of ozone {{taken in the}} period 1964 - 1988 at a network of 24 Dobson {{stations}} have been analyzed. Year-round data as well as summer data (May - Aug.) and winter data (Dec. - March) have been examined in the following regions: latitude bands (30 deg N - 39 deg N, 40 deg N - 52 deg N, 30 deg N - 60 deg N), North America, Europe, and Japan. To find year-to-year changes {{in the shape of}} the annual statistical distribution of <b>total</b> <b>ozone</b> (ASDTO) for these regions, we analyze trends in the following statistic characteristics of ASDTO: mean, standard deviation, median, and 10 and 90 percentiles. Time series of the statistical characteristics for the selected regions have been combined by averaging the individual stations values of these characteristics. The trends have been calculated by the multiple regression model adjusted for: the 11 -year solar cycle, the Southern Oscillations effects, and for serial correlations. We have found that: a) in all regions (excluding Japan, North America), the shape of ASDTO has been drifting towards low ozone values. The drift seems to be not accompanied with a transformation in the shape of ASDTO. The drift speed (the rate of decrease in the annual <b>means</b> of <b>total</b> <b>ozone)</b> is of order 1 - 3 percent per decade (in the period 1970 - 1988). b) In Japan, the interannual changes in the shape of ASDTO have not been revealed. c) In North America, the drift of the year-round ASDTO (the year-round ASDTO comprises all the daily <b>means</b> of <b>total</b> <b>ozone</b> in a given year) has been accompanied with a transformation in the shape. The shape of the year round ASDTO becomes narrower. d) In all regions, except Japan and the band 30 deg - 39 deg N, the winter ASDTO (the winter ASDTO comprises the data taken in the period December in a given year through March next year) moves faster towards low ozone values than the summer ASDTO (the summer ASDTO comprises the data taken in the period May through August in a given year) ...|$|R
