40|$|AbstractIn {{the recent}} {{literature}} {{a lot of}} attention has been given to intermodal transportation networks, mainly related to inland freight mobility. In particular, the landside distribution of maritime containers from/to seaports {{has been the focus of}} many research works. In fact, seaports are now suffering the lack of space at <b>maritime</b> <b>terminals</b> and the growing congestion on their access routes with the inland connections. In this regard, a well established strategic choice for <b>maritime</b> <b>terminals</b> is to perform gateway operations at inland dry ports, especially when topological and environmental constraints prevent terminals from expanding. Following this idea, in this paper we deal with the problem of locating dry ports for freight mobility in intermodal networks. In particular, the containerized flows originating at the <b>maritime</b> <b>terminals</b> of the port of Genoa, Italy, towards inland destinations throughout rail and road itineraries are examined. The present problem fits in the class of capacitated multiple hub location problems. We give a mathematical programming model for the problem, which is modelled on a two level weighted multimodal graph. Computational experiences based on randomly generated instances of different size are reported together with results related to the case study rail–road logistic network...|$|R

40|$|The {{article is}} focused on the role of a <b>maritime</b> {{automobile}} <b>terminal</b> in finished vehicle logistics (FVL). Different drivers that force the management of a <b>maritime</b> automobile <b>terminal</b> to find new solutions in accommodating the increased flows of vehicles are described. The analysis of the <b>maritime</b> automobile <b>terminal</b> at Koper indicates the need to further expand the storage area and its delivery zone to support regular clients from the automotive industry. The main research goal of the paper is to elaborate and describe the model where an external storage platform under port’s operation might be used. On this basis the analysis of current inbound and outbound flows is elaborated. The model of Extended Gate Concept (EGC) for a <b>maritime</b> automobile <b>terminal</b> is presented as an option to serve increased outgoing flows of finished vehicles. With proper infrastructure development, established inland connections and secured information flow the presented EGC model can be adopted at the observed <b>maritime</b> automobile <b>terminal.</b> Nevertheless, obstacles hindering EGC implementation {{play a crucial role in}} the model implantation, thus the final consent should be given by the relevant stakeholders in FVL...|$|R

Based on our research of the north Adriatic <b>maritime</b> automobile <b>terminals</b> and with Lambert's model an in-deep analysis of limiting factors, user's expectations and possibilities for productivity increase has been performed. Moreover, with our acknowledgments a three-level decision-support model is presented.

This is particularly valid for terminals, where the physical extensionof the terminal is practically impossible and further developmentof the system is possible only by searching internalsources. Therefore, the management of a maritime containerterminal must develop an appropriate decision support mode~in order to make an adequate support to strategic decisions.

The choice {{processes}} of <b>maritime</b> <b>terminals</b> {{included in the}} networks have become, in recent times, a significant importance due to the general improvement of accessibility that has characterized most of the infrastructure. The high degree of interconnection of the terminals, achieved thanks to the logistics innovation processes, revealed other attributes of the terminal activity, other than the localisation of facilities, which may be decisive for the users. In this context, considerable importance have strategies adopted by operators of shipping terminals whose level of competitiveness and efficiency is the key element {{in the process of}} selection of ports. Therefore the organizational and functional complexity of most of the ports may prove extremely useful to the analysis of characteristics of terminal for its right collocation in the network...|$|R
