5|$|Australian kites may be {{sedentary}} or nomadic, {{and generally}} occur in open grasslands or valleys {{where there are}} scattered clumps of trees. In urban areas they are found {{on the edge of}} towns on wasteland, irregularly mown areas, or grassy roadside verges. They also hunt over coastal dunes, drier <b>marshland,</b> and farmland.|$|E
5|$|DE 9 {{heads into}} <b>marshland</b> and crosses the Leipsic River on a {{high-level}} bridge, leaving Leipsic. Here, the road becomes Smyrna-Leipsic Road and enters agricultural areas with some woods and homes. Smyrna-Leipsic Road curves {{to the northwest}} and the route continues north on Hay Point Landing Road, running {{to the west of}} the Bombay Hook National Wildlife Refuge, where the Allee House is located. DE 9 comes to an intersection with DE 6 as it passes through the Woodland Beach Wildlife Area, turning to the northwest as it heads through a mix of woods and <b>marshland.</b> The road continues to a high-level bridge over the Smyrna River.|$|E

5|$|Since Roman times, silting {{and land}} {{reclamation}} in the Pevensey Levels {{have pushed the}} coastline out by about , leaving the castle landlocked. The land between the castle and the sea is now a flat <b>marshland</b> drained by a network of ditches and sewers or field drains. The modern village of Pevensey is situated mostly {{to the east of}} the castle, {{at the end of the}} ancient peninsula. Castle Road (the B2191) curves around the Roman north wall and connects Pevensey to the nearby village of Westham. A public footpath crosses the interior of the castle, linking the two villages. An area of reclaimed land, formerly part of the Pevensey tidal lagoon but now <b>marshland</b> and fields crossed by the Eastbourne to Hastings railway line, is situated immediately to the south of the castle.|$|E

5|$|Beacon Park {{stands on}} land which was {{originally}} low lying, poorly drained pasture alongside the Leamonsley Brook. The Museum Gardens and Recreation Grounds were {{the site of}} Bishops Fish Pool (sometimes known as Upper Pool). The pool was created when a causeway was built on Beacon Street in the 14th century separating it from Minster Pool. The waterlogged <b>marshland</b> surrounding Bishops Fish Pool became known as 'The Moggs' from the 15th century and later 'Swan Moggs'.|$|E
5|$|Bred {{primarily}} as hunting dogs, {{their goal is}} to find the bird, send it into the air and then to retrieve it on command after the hunter has shot the quarry. The Russian Spaniel is suited for hunting in <b>marshland,</b> fields, woodland, for birds as well as rabbits and other small game. The breed is also popular in their native Russia as their small size makes them suitable to be kept in busy cities, and easily transported to hunting sites.|$|E
5|$|Compared to {{the other}} crested newt species, the Danube crested newt is more adapted to life along a river system and {{frequently}} occurs in flowing water and together with fish. Typical breeding sites are slow-flowing river margins, oxbow lakes, flooded <b>marshland,</b> larger ponds, or ditches, provided abundant underwater vegetation is available. During land phase, the newts live in deciduous forests or groves, bushlands, or meadows.|$|E

5|$|MD363 {{begins at}} a dead end in the {{community}} of Wenona {{at the southern end of}} Deal Island. The state highway heads north, sharply curving before crossing Middle Creek. The road runs through another series of sharp curves through <b>marshland</b> before straightening out and passing St. John's Methodist Episcopal Church and the old post office building, two examples of buildings on the island preserved as part of the Deal Island Historic District. The route passes a boat ramp accessed from Ralph Abbott Road before a high-level bridge carries it over Upper Thorofare, a strait between Laws Cove and Tangier Sound. On the north side of the bridge, MD363 intersects MD363A, the northern approach to the previous bridge to Deal Island, before passing through the community of Chance, the site of Rock Creek Methodist Episcopal Church. After passing Haines Point Road, which leads to a large public boat ramp, the state highway continues northeast across the two branches of Rock Creek and through more <b>marshland</b> before entering Dames Quarter. MD363 traverses Dames Quarter Creek and passes through Deal Island Wildlife Management Area.|$|E
5|$|Originally the Frome {{joined the}} Avon {{downstream}} of Bristol Bridge, and formed {{part of the}} city defences, but in the thirteenth century the river was diverted through <b>marshland</b> belonging to St Augustine's Abbey (now Bristol Cathedral), as part of major port improvement works. In {{the late nineteenth and early}} twentieth centuries, the lower reaches of the river were culverted and the river now flows under The Centre into St Augustine's Reach.|$|E
5|$|The American {{alligator}} {{has also}} suffered serious declines from hunting and habitat loss throughout its range, threatening it with extinction. In 1967 it {{was listed as}} an endangered species, but the United States Fish and Wildlife Service and state wildlife agencies in the Southern United States stepped in and worked towards its recovery. Protection allowed the species to recuperate, and in 1987 it {{was removed from the}} endangered species list. Much research into alligator ranching has been undertaken at the Rockefeller Wildlife Refuge, a large area of <b>marshland</b> in the state of Louisiana. The resulting data has increased understanding of penning, stocking rates, egg incubation, hatching, rearing, and diet, and this information has been used at other establishments around the world. Income from the alligators kept at Rockefeller Wildlife Refuge contributes to conservation of the <b>marshland.</b> A study examining alligator farms in the United States showed that they have generated significant conservation gains, and poaching of wild alligators has greatly diminished.|$|E

5|$|The land housing Old Fort Schuyler {{was part}} of a 20,000-acre (80.94km²) portion of <b>marshland</b> granted by King George II to New York {{governor}} William Cosby on January2, 1734. Since the fort was located near several trails (including the Great Indian Warpath), its position—on a bend at a shallow portion of the Mohawk River—made it an important fording point. The Mohawk called the bend Unundadages ("around the hill"), and the Mohawk word appears on the city's seal.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of the park was originally waterlogged <b>marshland</b> and a lake covered the area {{of what is now}} the Museum Gardens. The land was drained in the early 19th century and the Museum Gardens were raised with silt dredged from Minster Pool. The large northern area of the park once formed the land and gardens of Beacon House. This land was incorporated into the park when the owner of Beacon House, Colonel Swinfen Broun, donated the land after his death.|$|E

5|$|Upon leaving Delaware City, DE 9 {{continues}} west as Wrangle Hill Road, passing between PBF Energy's Delaware City Refinery to {{the north}} and farm fields to the south. The route turns north onto River Road to head into the oil refinery complex, with DE 72 continuing west on Wrangle Hill Road. Within the oil refinery, the road crosses Norfolk Southern's Reybold Running Track railroad line. DE 9 leaves the industrial area upon crossing marshy Red Lion Creek and continues into a mix of fields, woods, and <b>marshland,</b> with DE 9 Truck heading northwest on Hamburg Road. At this point, the route turns {{to the north}}east and passes between Ommelanden Park to the west and the Ommelanden Hunter Training Center to the east before running between residential subdivisions to the west and the northern training grounds for the Delaware National Guard to the east. DE 9 passes through wooded areas with some homes before continuing into industrial areas and crossing a railroad spur. The road continues into <b>marshland</b> immediately to the northwest of the Delaware River before entering New Castle.|$|E
5|$|With {{the rise}} of sea levels that {{occurred}} during the Pleistocene approximately 17,000years ago, the runoff of water from Lake Okeechobee slowed and created the vast <b>marshland</b> that is now known as the Everglades. Slower runoff also created an accumulation of almost 18 feet (5.5 m) of peat in the area. The presence of such peat deposits, dated to about 5,000years ago, is evidence that widespread flooding had occurred by then.|$|E
