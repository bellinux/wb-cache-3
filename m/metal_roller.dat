25|$|Located in {{the western}} corner of the site {{adjacent}} to Bowen Park the building is a single-storey structure comprising two smaller elements separated by an access gate. The walls of the buildings are face brick and each has a hipped roof clad with metal custom orb sheeting. Recent additions to these structures appear to include the cement rendering of the brickwork to the Bowen Bridge Street facade and the installation of <b>metal</b> <b>roller</b> doors to the ticket issuing areas.|$|E
25|$|These {{consist of}} a number of {{uncovered}} stands, curved around the northern perimeter of the Main Arena, between the northeast end of the John MacDonald Stand and the Marshalling Yards at the northeast end of the arena. They are of concrete construction (concrete seating tiers supported on concrete piers), with brick or concrete in-fill to the sides. The seating consists of curved, slatted timber benches and is accessed via subways beneath the stands. The sub-floor beneath the northern-most stand provides kiosk space, with <b>metal</b> <b>roller</b> doors between the concrete piers opening to Ring Road. The sub-floor beneath the middle stand is utilised as the Cattleman's Bar. Sections of the seating on the northernmost of these open-air stands have been in-filled recently to provide access for horsemen entering the show ring for special display riding. There is a large sign {{at the back of the}} northern stand, with the lettering: MACHINERY HILL, which can be viewed from all over the show ring.|$|E
2500|$|Stoddard's {{original}} calliope {{was attached}} to a <b>metal</b> <b>roller</b> set with pins in the manner familiar to Stoddard from the contemporary clockwork music box. The pins on the roller opened valves that admitted steam into the whistles. [...] Later, Stoddard replaced the cylinder with a keyboard, so that the calliope could be played like an organ.|$|E
50|$|Traction drives {{transmit}} power through <b>metal</b> <b>rollers</b> running against mating <b>metal</b> <b>rollers.</b> The input/output speed ratio is adjusted {{by moving the}} rollers to change thediameters of the contact path. Many different roller shapes and mechanical designs have been used.|$|R

50|$|The {{cane juice}} is {{generally}} extracted from cleaned and eventually shredded cane stalks by mechanical processes, commonly with simple crushers consisting of three <b>metal</b> <b>rollers.</b> It is filtered to separate bagasse particles and/or allowed to settle so to eliminate solid impurities.|$|R
25|$|Crompton's {{machine was}} largely built of wood, using bands and pulley for the driving motions. After his machine was public, {{he had little}} to do with its development. Henry Stones, a {{mechanic}} from Horwich, constructed a mule using toothed gearing and, importantly, <b>metal</b> <b>rollers.</b> Baker of Bury worked on drums, and Hargreaves used parallel scrolling to achieve smoother acceleration and deceleration.|$|R
50|$|Except for the westernmost shop {{which has}} a <b>metal</b> <b>roller</b> shutter, the shopfronts have glazed showcases either side of splayed and glazed reveals and central doorways, and date from early this century.|$|E
50|$|The {{construction}} demonstrates {{an early}} use of reinforced concrete floors {{in a large}} scale building. Steel framing was employed in the roofs over the photographic rooms on the top floor and over the fireproofed sections. <b>Metal</b> <b>roller</b> shutters were installed in the fireproof sections.|$|E
5000|$|Intended {{primarily}} for children, the Wacky Worm is a <b>metal</b> <b>roller</b> coaster with a ride vehicle resembling a smiling green worm. The ride has a maximum height {{of less than}} 20 ft and consists of several turns and short [...] "bunny hop" [...] hills.|$|E
50|$|Scutching is done {{several ways}} by machine. Scutching mills started in Ireland, and were {{commonly}} used there by 1850, {{at a time when}} hand scutching was still common in Continental Europe. Machine scutching, while faster and cheaper, causes more waste than scutching by hand. One method of machine scutching is to crush the stalks between two <b>metal</b> <b>rollers</b> so that parts of the stalk can be separated.|$|R
2500|$|Methods {{for cutting}} a block can vary {{depending}} on the formation and other factors, but usually involve three types of saws (wire and two chain types of which all three are diamond edged). [...] The usual approach starts with a horizontal cut at the bottom after which <b>metal</b> <b>rollers</b> are inserted (on which to move the block away from the mountain after all sides have been cut). [...] Next is the back cut with a wire saw followed by chain saws to cut the vertical sides. [...] A metal bag is then inserted behind the back cut and filled with water, which pushes the block away from the rock face (on the <b>metal</b> <b>rollers).</b> [...] The block is then rigged for lifting by forklift and placed on a haul truck and driven out of the mountain and down to the staging area {{on the grounds of the}} old mill site. [...] (When the quarry opened in 1990 a [...] tunnel had been blasted through the mountain and into the quarry interior to enable marble to be driven out of the quarry.) ...|$|R
50|$|Coppersmithing as a trade benefited {{strongly}} {{from the}} invention of sheet <b>metal</b> <b>rollers.</b> Copper sheet was then available {{in a much more}} versatile and easy form for creating copper wares. By the 1700's, coppersmiths lived in the American colonies, but did not have access to much sheet copper due to the Crown's regulation of copper and other goods to the Americas. Sheet metal production was prohibited in the colonies as well before the American Revolution.|$|R
50|$|To {{the west}} of the Police Station and on the {{northern}} boundary of the site is a simple rectangular planned face brick building, originally constructed as stables but now used as a Radio Maintenance Building. The two ends of the building have pyramidal roofs and a hipped roof extends between these two end bays. The roof is clad with coated metal, clip lock profile, roof sheeting. The ends of the building project {{from the face of the}} principal southern facade and the corners of these ends on this face project upward through the roof and terminate in flat parapets. Between the end bays this facade is lined with three <b>metal</b> <b>roller</b> doors with another <b>metal</b> <b>roller</b> door in a concrete extension on the eastern end of the building.|$|E

5000|$|Feed-Roller: This {{actually}} {{is the first}} patented method used in the semi-automatic label dispenser to advance the label forward. The label material is fed over the peeling edge, then through a feed-roller assembly which pinches the label material between a <b>metal</b> <b>roller</b> and a rubber roller. The <b>metal</b> <b>roller</b> is held in place with bushings pressed into aluminum blocks which hinge on a rod supported between two sideframes. The blocks use springs on each side to hold tension against the rubber roller (driven by a motor), and this also holds the tracking of the label material {{to the side of}} the machine with the sensor. Using this method label stock up to 16" [...] width can be advanced and tracked perfectly. The disadvantage/advantage to this method is waste is not collected, but pushed out through the rear of the machine where it can be fed into a trash receptacle.|$|E
50|$|After retting, {{the stalks}} {{are ready for}} scutching, which takes place between August and December. Scutching removes the woody portion of the stalks by {{crushing}} them between two <b>metal</b> <b>rollers,</b> so that {{the parts of the}} stalk can be separated. The fibers are removed and the other parts such as linseed, shive, and tow are set aside for other uses. Next the fibers are heckled: the short fibers are separated with heckling combs by 'combing' them away, to leave behind only the long, soft flax fibers.|$|R
40|$|A {{collaboration}} between NASA Lewis Research Center (LRC) and Gladwin Engineering {{resulted in the}} adaptation of aerospace high temperature metal technology to the continuous casting of steel. The continuous process is more efficient because it takes less time and labor. A high temperature material, once used on the X- 15 research plane, was applied to <b>metal</b> <b>rollers</b> by a LRC developed spraying technique. Lewis Research Center also supplied mold prototype of metal composites, reducing erosion and promoting thermal conductivity. Rollers that previously cracked due to thermal fatigue, lasted longer. Gladwin's sales have increased, and additional NASA-developed innovations are anticipated...|$|R
5000|$|In 2002, in an {{experimental}} move, the RATP installed a moving walkway that moved at 12 km/h, {{which was then}} termed the [...] "fastest in the world." [...] (The speed has however since been reduced to 9 km/h). The first several metres consist of <b>metal</b> <b>rollers</b> that accelerate passengers as they hold onto the handrail, {{because it would be}} dangerous to step directly onto the fast-moving conveyor. However, RATP announced in May 2009 that they would replace the walkway with an ordinary one in March 2011 in response to 'numerous customer complaints concerning safety and unreliability'.|$|R
50|$|The {{kitchen and}} store have metal trusses, a fibrous cement sheet ceiling with timber cover strips and {{tongue and groove}} walls. A section of timber floor {{following}} {{the line of the}} stage bay, and abutting the kitchen and store floor, is visible. A section of folding partition wall with a <b>metal</b> <b>roller</b> divides the store area and in its detailing appears to be originally from the hall.|$|E
50|$|In 1850, Gottlieb Ziebold {{purchased}} the Mill. In 1851, he converted the Mill to steam power. The dam {{may have been}} abandoned at this time, {{in favor of a}} direct, iron pipe from the spring to the Mill. (There is no authoritative record as to when this change was made.) In 1882, Charles Duryea was hired to convert the rock grindstones to <b>metal</b> <b>roller</b> technology, along with a general modernization of the milling equipment.|$|E

40|$|Metals {{and other}} {{materials}} can be machined with surpassing quality and highest flexibility with high power ultrafast lasers. In this study a slab based MOPA ps-laser system with fluencies of up to 30 J/cm 2 and pulse repetition rates in the multi MHz range for processing of large embossing <b>metal</b> <b>rollers</b> has been investigated. Different materials (Cu, Ni, Al, steel) have been explored for parameters like ablation rate per pulse, ablation geometry, surface roughness, influence of pulse overlap and number of loops. An enhanced ablation quality and an effective ablation rate of 4 mm 3 /min has been achieved by using different scanning systems and an optimized processing strategy...|$|R
5000|$|A {{middlings}} purifier is {{a device}} {{used in the}} production of flour to remove the husks from the kernels of wheat. It was developed in Minnesota by Edmund LaCroix, a French inventor hired by Cadwallader C. Washburn and George Christian of the Washburn [...] "A" [...] Mill. It was developed to complement the emerging roller mill technique of the late 19th century, which used corrugated <b>metal</b> <b>rollers</b> instead of abrasive grindstones to grind wheat into flour. The middlings purifier was used in this process to separate the bran from the usable part of the flour. The machine developed by LaCroix passed the partially ground middlings over a screen, and a stream of air blew away the particles of bran.|$|R
5000|$|One line of Cabbage Patch Kids dolls, the Cabbage Patch Snacktime Kids, was {{designed}} to [...] "eat" [...] plastic snacks. The mechanism enabling this {{was a pair of}} one-way smooth <b>metal</b> <b>rollers</b> behind plastic lips. The snacks would exit the doll's back and [...] "magically" [...] appear into a backpack. The mechanism could be de-activated by releasing the back pack. They were extremely popular during Christmas 1996. The line was voluntarily withdrawn from the market following an agreement between Mattel and the Consumer Product Safety Commission in January 1997 following several incidents where children got their fingers or hair stuck in the dolls' mouths leading to safety warnings from Connecticut's consumer protection commissioner, Mark Shiffrin.|$|R
5000|$|The land {{imprinter}} is a no-till {{device for}} establishing grass cover in arid environments and deserts (Figure 1). The imprinter {{consists of a}} <b>metal</b> <b>roller,</b> with steel angles welded to the surface in various configurations. The angled teeth of the imprinter cut through weeds and brush to form a mulch, while the teeth press seeds of grasses and other plants into the soil. The imprints remain stable for approximately two years. During that time, imprints funnel water toward seedlings, protect them from wind, and concentrate nutrients for plant growth.|$|E
5000|$|Ski {{bindings}} {{evolved from}} the cable binding system of the 1950s, which looped around behind the boot and {{over the back of}} the sole. Many boots of the 1950s and 60s included a semi-circular indentation in the sole to provide a better fit for the cable. Early releasing bindings were designed to fit into this groove or over the sole, like a cable, often using a <b>metal</b> <b>roller</b> about the same size as the cable, the Look Nevada's [...] "Gran Prix" [...] release heel being a typical example. When plastic boots were introduced, they too provided similar sole extensions for mounting the bindings.|$|E
50|$|The most {{effective}} countermeasure deployed against mine fields is mine clearing, using either explosive methods or mechanical methods. Explosive methods, {{such as the}} Giant Viper and the SADF Plofadder 160 AT, involve laying explosives across a minefield, either by propelling the charges across the field with rockets, or by dropping them from aircraft, and then detonating the explosive, clearing a path. Mechanical methods include plowing and pressure-forced detonation and the deactivating RS36 Eggtron robot used during combat operations to protect vehicles. In plowing, a specially designed plow attached to {{the front end of}} a heavily armored tank is used to push aside the earth and any mines embedded in it, clearing a path as wide as the pushing tank. In pressure-forced detonation, a heavily armored tank pushes a heavy spherical or cylindrical solid <b>metal</b> <b>roller</b> ahead of it, causing mines to detonate.|$|E
40|$|We {{made for}} trial the carpet-comperssion-recovery-tester that {{consisted}} {{of a pair of}} <b>metal</b> <b>rollers</b> {{and one of them was}} covered with carpets. 　We mesured the carpet thickness and their rotating torque with the electric apparatus upon condition of constant load and constant rotating speed. 　we tested a few kinds of commercial carpets. 　The results was as follows. 　(1) The carpet thickness changes more than parallel when their rollers rotate in direction of perpendcular to their pile stich. 　(2) It is possible to estimate viscoelastic factors of carpet on the basis of change of its thickness for the number of period. 　(3) Rotating torque decreases with increasing the number of period, and so we estimate that the work recovery of carpet increases with them...|$|R
50|$|One problem often {{encountered}} with roll-off containers is {{the liability}} of scratching or damaging the surface they are placed on. Most roll-off containers have <b>metal</b> <b>rollers</b> for wheels, which can at times scratch or be abrasive to a concrete or asphalt surface. It is recommended {{to place a}} protective board such as plywood under the container to avoid {{a situation where the}} placement surface can be damaged. Most roll-off companies do not offer plywood, but will place the container on the wood if supplied. The roll-off must be placed on a hard surface other than dirt. Gravel, asphalt, and concrete are all acceptable. If the container is placed on dirt, the wheels may sink after a rainfall event and the truck could get stuck.|$|R
5000|$|The {{patterns}} of United Kingdom's first postage stamps (known as the [...] "line engraved" [...] series), including the Penny Black of 1840, {{were based on}} rose engine patterns. The die used to prepare the printing plates was partially created {{by means of the}} rose engine, which produced a complicated pattern on a separate piece of <b>metal.</b> <b>Rollers</b> were then used to transfer this pattern to the die, where it formed the background and border patterns (the head, corner decoration and lettering were hand-engraved). This pattern made the stamps difficult to forge, and PB&P (known from 1852 as Perkins, Bacon & Co.) held the contract for forty years, during which time the designs of the stamps which they printed changed little.|$|R
