A switch {{on the other hand}} {{provides a}} series of point-to-point circuits, via microsegmentation, which allows each client node tohave a dedicated circuit and the added advantage of having full-duplex connections.|$|E
40|$|Over {{the last}} several years, a variety of <b>multipoint</b> virtual <b>circuit</b> {{switching}} systems have been proposed for use in Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) networks. The inherent flexibility of ATM networking {{and the desire to}} apply this technology {{to a wide range of}} different applications makes it impractical to rely on statistical traffic models when engineering a system. This motivates a renewed interest in networks which are nonblocking with respect to requests to create or modify <b>multipoint</b> virtual <b>circuits.</b> While the various multipoint switching system architectures can all be configured to achieve nonblocking operation, for most, the cost of the nonblocking configuration quickly becomes prohibitive. We examine the complexity characteristics of a variety of multipoint switch architectures, taking into account the switching network, the memory required for routing <b>multipoint</b> virtual <b>circuits</b> and the effort required to create or modify a virtual circuit. In particular, we show that a ver [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Multihop mobile {{wireless}} networks o#er a {{means for}} providing a rapidly-deployable and fluid network infrastructure that enables "on-the-move" communications among nodes that may be widelydispersed over a large area. These networks experience frequent changes in node interconnectivity and link characteristics, resulting from node movements and environmental changes. Such volatility in network state presents challenges in maintaining a desired quality of service {{over the life of}} a session, particularly if the session involves many participants. We have developed, simulated, and tested a network architecture designed to support distributed multimedia sessions in a multihop mobile wireless network. In this paper, we focus on the functions of construction, maintenance, and use of <b>multipoint</b> virtual <b>circuits</b> for transporting session tra#c among mobile nodes. I. INTRODUCTION Over the years, much networking research has been devoted to the development of theoretically interesting and practic [...] ...|$|R
40|$|We {{present an}} {{efficient}} proof system for <b>Multipoint</b> Arithmetic <b>Circuit</b> Evaluation: for every arithmetic circuit C(x_ 1, [...] .,x_n) of size s and degree d over a field F, and any inputs a_ 1, [...] .,a_K in F^n, - the Prover sends the Verifier the values C(a_ 1), [...] ., C(a_K) in F and a proof of O(K * d) length, and - the Verifier tosses poly(log(dK|F|epsilon)) coins and can check the proof in about O(K * (n + d) + s) time, with {{probability of error}} less than epsilon. For small degree d, this "Merlin-Arthur" proof system (a. k. a. MA-proof system) runs in nearly-linear time, and has many applications. For example, we obtain MA-proof systems that run in c^n time (for various c < 2) for the Permanent, #Circuit-SAT for all sublinear-depth circuits, counting Hamiltonian cycles, and infeasibility of 0 - 1 linear programs. In general, the value of any polynomial in Valiant 2 Ì† 7 s class VP can be certified faster than "exhaustive summation" over all possible assignments. These results strongly refute a Merlin-Arthur Strong ETH and Arthur-Merlin Strong ETH posed by Russell Impagliazzo and others. We also give a three-round (AMA) proof system for quantified Boolean formulas running in 2 ^ 2 n/ 3 +o(n) time, nearly-linear time MA-proof systems for counting orthogonal vectors in a collection and finding Closest Pairs in the Hamming metric, and a MA-proof system running in n^k/ 2 +O(1) -time for counting k-cliques in graphs. We point to some potential future directions for refuting the Nondeterministic Strong ETH...|$|R
