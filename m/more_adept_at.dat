5|$|Shakespeare's {{use of his}} poetic {{dramatic}} structure (especially effects such as switching between {{comedy and}} tragedy to heighten tension, his expansion of minor characters, and his use of sub-plots to embellish the story) has been praised as an early sign of his dramatic skill. The play ascribes different poetic forms to different characters, sometimes changing the form as the character develops. Romeo, for example, grows <b>more</b> <b>adept</b> <b>at</b> the sonnet {{over the course of}} the play.|$|E
5|$|Despite being a {{major power}} of the cotton {{industry}} {{in the first quarter}} of the 19th century, the Strutts' company began to lose out to competition from Lancashire mill towns. The problem of shifting markets affected the entire Derwent Valley; Lancashire was better situated than Derbyshire in relation to the raw materials and new markets. The mills run by the Strutt family also suffered from a lack of modernisation; although they were at the forefront of fireproofing technology at the start of the 19th century, as the machines the mills used got bigger and more powerful, the Strutts persevered with child labour where adults would have been <b>more</b> <b>adept</b> <b>at</b> using the machinery. The company declined and in the second half of the 19th century some of its mills were leased or sold off to other companies. Although the cotton industry in the Derwent Valley declined, many of the structures associated with the industrial processes associated with producing cotton and workers' housing has survived and there are 848 listed buildings in the World Heritage Site.|$|E
5|$|Grey reef sharks feed {{mainly on}} bony fishes, with {{cephalopods}} such as squid and octopus being the second-most important food group, and crustaceans such as crabs and lobsters {{making up the}} remainder. The larger sharks take {{a greater proportion of}} cephalopods. These sharks hunt individually or in groups, and have been known to pin schools of fish against the outer walls of coral reefs for feeding. They excel at capturing fish swimming in the open, and they complement hunting whitetip reef sharks, which are <b>more</b> <b>adept</b> <b>at</b> capturing fish inside caves and crevices. Their sense of smell is extremely acute, being capable of detecting one part tuna extract in 10 billion parts of sea water. In the presence of a large quantity of food, grey reef sharks may be roused into a feeding frenzy; in one documented frenzy caused by an underwater explosion that killed several snappers, one of the sharks involved was attacked and consumed by the others.|$|E

5|$|Like the old revolutionary States-General, the new National Assembly {{contained}} radically opposed parties: the unitary democrats, led by Pieter Vreede, Johan Valckenaer and Pieter Paulus, and the federalists, such as Jacob Abraham de Mist and Gerard Willem van Marle. But {{there was}} a broad continuum of opinion between these poles. In this force-field the federalists held the upper hand after the sudden demise of Paulus (who might otherwise have acted as a unifier). The conservative federalists were <b>more</b> <b>adept</b> <b>at</b> parliamentary manoeuvering (Rutger Jan Schimmelpenninck proved himself especially adept at this). The frustration this engendered among the democrats led them to appeal to popular opinion and to extra-parliamentary action. Meanwhile, the Assembly installed a constitutional commission that in November 1796 presented a report that amounted to {{a continuation of the}} old federal arrangements. As this was totally unacceptable to the unitarists, this draft was subsequently amended into its opposite, by a compromise that finally formed a basis for a new Constitution. The Assembly now started upon a discussion of other important matters, like the separation between church and state, and the emancipation of minorities. The organs of the state were to be a bicameral Legislative Corps, to be elected in indirect elections, and a Directoire-like Executive of five members. The end result looked much like the French Constitution of 1795. This was approved by the Assembly on 10 May 1797.|$|E

25|$|Feeding {{intensity}} varies {{throughout the}} year, and is strongly correlated {{to changes in}} the precipitation and wind during cyclical shifts in the climate. Young fish tend to feed intensively throughout the year, but show a peak in the spring and autumn months, while adults intensify their feeding during the dry and rainy seasons, with feeding declining during intermediate periods (winter and early summer). Daily intakes during the period of intensive feeding reach 3–7% of the fishes body weight, and during the periods of decline to 0.5–2%, with the annual intake being 1000–1500% of the body weight. In a 1993 paper, Troy Baird reported a foraging association between bar jacks and puddingwife wrasse, Halichoeres radiatus, in which a jack followed a single wrasse while it foraged for food. These associations were initiated by both jacks and wrasse, with apparently little pilfering of uncovered items, suggesting a beneficial relationship to both parties. While foraging with the wrasse, the jack increases its prey detection levels, which is useful for a species which is <b>more</b> <b>adept</b> <b>at</b> pelagic hunting, allowing it to be more efficient at this less common mode of food gathering.|$|E
25|$|Stanton's role in Manny's legal trio {{was as a}} researcher. Though he {{admitted}} that George Harding, an established patent lawyer, was <b>more</b> <b>adept</b> <b>at</b> the scientific aspects of the case, Stanton worked to summarize the relevant jurisprudence and case law. To win McCormick v. Manny for Manny, Stanton, Harding and Watson had to impress upon the court that McCormick had no claim to exclusivity in his reaper's use of a divider, a mechanism on the outer end of the cutter-bar which separated the grain. A harvesting machine would not have worked properly without a divider, and Manny's defense knew this. However, to assure a win, Watson opted to use duplicity—he employed a model maker named William P. Woods to retrieve an older version of McCormick's reaper and alter it to be presented in court. Woods found a reaper in Virginia which was built in 1844, one year prior to McCormick's patent being granted. He had a blacksmith straighten the curved divider, knowing that the curved divider in Manny's reaper would not conflict with a straight one in McCormick's reaper. After using a salt and vinegar solution to add rust to where the blacksmith had worked to ensure the antiquity of the machine was undeniable, Woods sent the reaper to Cincinnati. Stanton was joyed when he examined the altered reaper, and knew the case was theirs. Arguments for the case began on September 1855. In March 1856, Justices John McLean and Thomas Drummond delivered a ruling in favor of John Manny. McCormick appealed the decision to the Supreme Court, and McCormick v. Manny, was, all of a sudden, a political issue, and the matters concerning the case {{found their way to}} the floor of Congress.|$|E
40|$|AbstractSeveral {{contemporary}} large {{multinational corporations}} (MNCs) have developed interfirm ecosystems {{that are likely}} to attract a heterogeneous set of actors, including new ventures. New ventures are asymmetric vis-à-vis the focal MNC in terms of organisational size, structure and power which could be an impediment to the development of social capital between these sets of firms. And yet MNCs are potentially a source of novel information, opportunities and ideas. An interesting question to consider therefore is how new ventures overcome interfirm asymmetries to develop and leverage social capital with large MNCs. Our synthesis of the academic literature suggests that some new ventures are <b>more</b> <b>adept</b> than others <b>at</b> partnering with MNCs because they are more proactive in forming and leveraging interfirm ties with large MNCs. Insightful observations of four panellists shed light on how startups’ proactive behaviours can be vitally important in forming, consolidating and extending relationships with large MNCs...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. We {{present and}} analyze {{results from the}} 2004 Trading Agent Competition supply chain {{management}} scenario. We identify behavioral differences between the agents that contributed to their performance in the competition. In the market for components, strategic early procurement remained an important factor despite rule changes from the previous year. We present a new experimental analysis {{of the impact of}} the rule changes on incentives for early procurement. In the finals, a novel strategy designed to block other agent’s access to suppliers at the start of the game was pivotal. Some agents did not respond effectively to this strategy and were badly hurt by their inability to get crucial components. Among the top three agents, average selling prices in the market for finished goods were the decisive difference. Our analysis shows that supply and demand were key factors in determining overall market prices, and that some agents were <b>more</b> <b>adept</b> than others <b>at</b> exploiting advantageous market conditions. ...|$|R

He is also implied to be a self-made man of humble origins (Mannion calls him the Gorbals Goebbels, seemingly in reference to his hometown), a firm believer in meritocracy and a staunch opponent of classism and cronyism, e.g. comparing the intentions of an MP's daughter to capitalise on her family connections to the practices of Tsarist Russia and [...] "the fucking Dimblebys". This probably places him well within the left wing of his own party, which although unnamed is strongly implied to be Labour; at one point aide Jamie even accuses him of {{being a member of the}} [...] "Nutters", loosely based on the Gordon Brown faction which heavily contested Blair's Third Way politics.|$|R

40|$|It is {{well known}} that humans are far <b>more</b> <b>adept</b> than {{computers}} <b>at</b> identifying similarities between stories. Humans are able to communicate values and event patterns back and forth through these narratives. Parents communicate through the telling of "The Tortoise and the Hare" that hard work and determination can often trump talent, and that hubris can lead to one's downfall. It would be quite useful to develop a computational technique to apply this type of analysis to a story to relate to more generic cases. In this paper, I demonstrate the beginnings of a technique called Spatial Semantic Analysis of Narrative that identifies a "trajectory" for each story that enables comparison between them. These trajectories take into account the temporal progression of a story, which aims to provide a dimension of information beyond traditional "bag of words" comparisons. I present promising results when this technique is applied to a corpus of "how-to" articles scraped from the Internet as well as a corpus of Islamic texts annotated using Mark Finlayson's Story Workbench application. I also present next steps for improving the algorithm and allowing it to operate on standard untagged datasets. by Michael L. Puncel. Thesis: M.

500|$|On the overworld {{and within}} dungeons, random {{encounters}} with enemies can be fought to improve each character's attributes. Unlike the original Final Fantasy, players could not upgrade their characters' classes. The game {{is also one}} of the few games in the series to not use experience-based levels. Instead, each character participating in battle develops depending on what actions they take. For instance, characters who frequently use a particular type of weapon will become <b>more</b> <b>adept</b> <b>at</b> wielding a weapon of that type, and will also increase in physical strength and accuracy. Attributes include hit points, magic points, magic power, stamina, strength, spirit, agility, intelligence, and evasion. Players can also increase their ability to wield certain types of weapon, and repeated use in combat causes the ability to level up. Hit points (HP) and magic points (MP) increase with their use; a character who takes a heavy amount of damage in a battle might earn an increase in maximum HP, while a character who uses a lot of MP during battle might increase their maximum MP. This experience system had several unintended consequences that allowed characters to gain much more experience than intended, such as players having their characters attack each other and repeatedly cast spells, thus causing their HP and abilities to grow extensively. Final Fantasy II uses the same turn-based battle system seen in the original Final Fantasy, with battle parties consisting of up to four characters at a time.
