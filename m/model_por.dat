40|$|Most of the world’s natural {{languages}} have complex morphology. But {{the expense}} of building morphological analyzers by hand has prevented the development of morphologi-cal analysis systems for {{the large majority of}} languages. Unsupervised induction tech-niques, that learn from unannotated text data, can facilitate the development of computa-tional morphology systems for new languages. Such unsupervised morphological analysis systems have been shown to help natural language processing tasks including speech rec-ognition (Creutz, 2006) and information retrieval (Kurimo and Turunen, 2008). This the-sis describes ParaMor, an unsupervised induction algorithm for learning morphological paradigms from large collections of words in any natural language. Paradigms are sets of mutually substitutable morphological operations that organize the inflectional morphol-ogy of natural languages. ParaMor focuses on the most common morphological process, suffixation. ParaMor learns paradigms in a three-step algorithm. First, a recall-centric search scours a space of candidate partial paradigms for those which possibly model suffixes of true paradigms. Second, ParaMor merges selected candidates that appear to <b>model</b> <b>por...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{adsorption}} isotherm data ofR- and S- 1 -indanol and oftheir racemic mixture on cellulose tribenzoate were measured by frontal analysis. These data were then fitted to the Langmuir, the Bilangmuir, the Toth, and the Langmuir-Freundlich isotherm models. The single component data fitted well {{to both the}} Bilangmuir and the Toth models. Combined with the lumped pore diffusion <b>model</b> (<b>POR)</b> of chromatography, these isotherms were used to calculate overloaded elution profiles of the pure enantiomers. The calculated and the experimental profiles agree excellently in all cases if the former are derived from the Bilangmuir model. The competitive experimental data also gave excellent agreement with the Bilangmuir model. The simultaneous fit ofall the data, for the single components and the racemic mixture, gave again superior agreement with the bilangmuir model. The overloaded elution profiles ofsamples ofthe racemic mixture calculated with the Bilangmuir isotherm model combined with the POR model ofchromatography gave results in very good agreement with the experimental band profiles oflarge samples ofthe racemic mixture. This confirms that in numerous cases the whole set ofcompetitive isotherms oftwo enantiomers {{can be derived from}} the experimental data obtained only with the racemic mixture...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Consider a {{meta-analysis}} where a 'head-to-head' comparison of diagnostic tests for {{a disease of}} interest is intended. Assume there are two or more tests available for the disease, where each test has been studied {{in one or more}} papers. Some of the papers may have studied more than one test, hence the results are not independent. Also the collection of tests studied may change from one paper to the other, hence incomplete matched groups. Methods We propose a model, the proportional odds ratio (<b>POR)</b> <b>model,</b> which makes no assumptions about the shape of OR p, a baseline function capturing the way OR changes across papers. The <b>POR</b> <b>model</b> does not assume homogeneity of ORs, but merely specifies a relationship between the ORs of the two tests. One may expand the domain of the <b>POR</b> <b>model</b> to cover dependent studies, multiple outcomes, multiple thresholds, multi-category or continuous tests, and individual-level data. Results In the paper we demonstrate how to formulate the model for a few real examples, and how to use widely available or popular statistical software (like SAS, R or S-Plus, and Stata) to fit the models, and estimate the discrimination accuracy of tests. Furthermore, we provide code for converting ORs into other measures of test performance like predictive values, post-test probabilities, and likelihood ratios, under mild conditions. Also we provide code to convert numerical results into graphical ones, like forest plots, heterogeneous ROC curves, and post test probability difference graphs. Conclusions The flexibility of <b>POR</b> <b>model,</b> coupled with ease with which it can be estimated in familiar software, suits the daily practice of meta-analysis and improves clinical decision-making. </p...|$|R

40|$|A {{proof of}} {{retrievability}} (POR) is a compact proof by a file system (prover) to a client (verifier) that a target file F is intact, {{in the sense}} that the client can fully recover it. As PORs incur lower communication complexity than transmission of F itself, they are an attractive building block for high-assurance remote storage systems. In this paper, we propose a theoretical framework for the design of PORs. Our framework improves the previously proposed POR constructions of Juels-Kaliski and Shacham-Waters, and also sheds light on the conceptual limitations of previous theoretical <b>models</b> for <b>PORs.</b> It supports a fully Byzantine adversarial model, carrying only the restriction—fundamental to all PORs—that the adversary’s error rate ɛ be bounded when the client seeks to extract F. Our techniques support efficient protocols across the full possible range of ɛ, up to ɛ non-negligibly close to 1. We propose a new variant on the Juels-Kaliski protocol and describe a prototype implementation. We demonstrate practical encoding even for files F whose size exceeds that of client main memory. ...|$|R
40|$|Cytochrome P 450 {{oxidoreductase}} (POR) supplies electrons from NADPH to steroid {{and drug}} metabolizing reactions catalyzed by the cytochrome P 450 s located in endoplasmic reticulum. Mutations in human POR cause {{a wide spectrum}} of disease ranging from disordered steroidogenesis to sexual differentiation. Previously we and others have shown that POR mutations can lead to reduced activities of steroidogenic P 450 s CYP 17 A 1, CYP 19 A 1 and CYP 21 A 1. Here we are reporting that mutations in the FMN binding domain of POR may reduce CYP 3 A 4 activity, potentially influencing drug and steroid metabolism; and the loss of CYP 3 A 4 activity may be correlated to the reduction of cytochrome b(5) by POR. Computational molecular docking experiments with a FMN free structural <b>model</b> of <b>POR</b> revealed that an external FMN could be docked in close proximity to the FAD moiety and receive electrons donated by NADPH.

40|$|Abstract: Rare {{events are}} an {{important}} limitation of discrete-event simulation {{in some areas of}} applications. The existing rare-event simulation (RES) techniques, such as importance sampling (IS), splitting, and RESTART, have been used for RES so far. However, these techniques not only have some limitations, but also are not general or easy to use. In this paper, the partition of the region (PoR) method is used as a variance reduction technique in a new RES technique for usage {{with a wide range of}} modeling and simulation languages. Three variants of the proposed technique will be introduced: simple PoR, recursive PoR, and advanced PoR. Simple and recursive PoR methods are powerful techniques that have some important features such as bounded relative error; however, they are restricted to some specific <b>models.</b> Advanced <b>PoR</b> is a more general technique that integrates the PoR method and the IS technique. To evaluate the efficiency of the proposed technique and its variants, the comparative simulation results of some illustrative examples using stochastic activity networks will be presented.

Unfortunately, past experience has shown that BDD-based techniques do not work well for loosely-synchronized models,whereas POR methods allow explicit-state model checkers to deal with large concurrent models. This paper presents an algorithm that combines symbolic <b>model</b> checking and <b>POR</b> to verify linear temporal logic properties without the next operator (LTLX), which performs better on models featuring asynchronous processes. Our algorithm adapts and combines three methods: Clarke et al. ’s tableau-based symbolic LTL model checking,Iwashita et al. ’s forward symbolic CTL model checking and Lerda et al. ’s ImProviso symbolic reachability with POR.

40|$|Microsomal P 450 enzymes, which metabolize {{drugs and}} {{catalyze}} steroid biosynthesis require electron donation from NADPH via P 450 oxidoreductase (POR). POR knockout mice are embryonically lethal, {{but we found}} recessive human POR missense mutations causing disordered steroidogenesis and Antley-Bixler syndrome (ABS), a skeletal malformation syndrome featuring craniosynostosis. Dominant mutations in exons 8 and 10 of fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR 2) cause phenotypically related craniosynostosis syndromes and were reported in patients with ABS and normal steroidogenesis. Sequencing POR and FGFR 2 exons in 32 patients with ABS and/or hormonal findings suggesting POR deficiency showed complete genetic segregation of POR and FGFR 2 mutations. Fifteen patients carried POR mutations on both alleles, four carried POR mutations on 1 allele, nine carried FGFR 2 / 3 mutations on one allele and no mutation was found in three patients. The 34 affected POR alleles included 10 with A 287 P, 7 with R 457 H, 9 other missense mutations and 7 frameshifts. These 11 missense mutations and 10 others identified by database mining were expressed in E. coli, purified to apparent homogeneity, and their catalytic capacities were measured in four assays: reduction of cytochrome c, oxidation of NADPH, {{and support of the}} 17 alpha-hydroxylase and 17, 20 lyase activities of human P 450 c 17. As assessed by Vmax/Km, 17, 20 lyase activity provided the best correlation with clinical findings. <b>Modeling</b> human <b>POR</b> on the X-ray crystal structure of rat POR shows that these mutant activities correlate well with their locations in the structure.

While the number of megacities is projected to increase, the largest population growth is expected to be in cities of less than one million people. Such a dramatic demographic shift can be expected to have an impact on population health. Although there has been historic interest in how city living affects health, a cogent framework that enables systematic study of urban health across time and place has yet to emerge. Four alternate but complementary approaches to the study of urban health today are presented (urban health penalty, urban health advantage, urban sprawl, and an integrative urban conditions model) followed by three key questions that may help guide the study and practice of urban health in coming decades. A maioria da população mundial irá residir em cidades dentro de alguns poucos anos e a velocidade de urbanização continuará acelerada mundialmente nas próximas décadas.

40|$|The light {{dependent}} enzyme protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase (POR) is a {{key enzyme}} in the chlorophyll biosynthesis pathway, catalysing {{the reduction of the}} C 17 C 18 bond in protochlorophyllide (Pchlide) to form chlorophyllide (Chlide). This reaction involves the light-induced transfer of a hydride from the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) cofactor, followed by proton transfer from a catalytic tyrosine residue. Much work has been done to elucidate the catalytic mechanism of POR, however {{little is known about the}} protein structure. POR isoforms in plants are also notable as components of the prolamellar bodies (PLBs), large paracrystalline structures that are precursors to the thylakoid membranes in mature chloroplasts. Bioinformatics studies have identified a number of proteins, related to POR, which contain similar structural features, leading to the production of a structural <b>model</b> for <b>POR.</b> A unique loop region of POR was shown by EPR to be mobile, with point mutations within this region causing a reduction in enzymatic activity. Production of a 2 H, 13 C, 15 N labelled sample of POR for NMR studies has enabled significant advancement in the understanding of the protein structure. This includes the calculation of backbone torsion angles for the majority of the protein, in addition to the identification of multiple dynamic regions of the protein. The protocol for purification of Pchlide, the substrate for POR, has been significantly improved, providing high quality pigment for study of the POR ternary complex. Various biophysical techniques have been used to study the macromolecular structure of these complexes, indicating the formation of large aggregates of the cyanobacterial enzyme induced by substrate binding, similar to PLBs. This has also led to the identification of ring structures, composed of 5 and 6 monomers of POR, which are likely to be the primary components of the cyanobacterial POR structures...|$|R
40|$|Partial order {{reduction}} (POR) {{capabilities are}} typically added by extending a model checking algorithm supporting analysis of programs {{in a given}} programming language. In this {{paper we propose a}} generic method to generate a <b>model</b> checker with <b>POR</b> capabilities for any programming language of interest. The method is based on giving a formal executable specification of the semantics of a programming language L as a rewrite theory R_L, and then exploiting the efficient execution, search, and LTL model checking capabilities of the Maude rewriting logic language to generate a model checker for L essentially for free. The key idea is to achieve the desired POR reduction by means of a theory transformation that transforms the theory R_L into a semantically equivalent theory which is then used to explore the POR-reduced state space. This can be done for a language L with relatively little effort and has the advantage of not requiring any changes in the underlying model checker. Our experiments with the JVM and with a Promela-like language indicate that significant state space reductions and time speedups can be gained for the tools generated this way...|$|R

The symposium speakers summarized and critically evaluated our current understanding of the physiological, pharmacological and toxicological roles of NADPH-cytochrome P 450 oxidoreductase (POR), a flavoprotein involved in electron transfer to microsomal cytochromes P 450 (P 450), cytochrome b 5, squalene monooxygenase and heme oxygenase. Considerable insight has been derived from the development and characterization of mouse <b>models</b> with conditional <b>Por</b> deletion in particular tissues or partial suppression of POR expression in all tissues. Additional mouse models with global or conditional hepatic deletion of cytochrome b 5 are helping to clarify the P 450 isoform- and substrate-specific influences of cytochrome b 5 on P 450 electron transfer and catalytic function.

40|$|Search {{is a major}} {{technique}} for planning. It amounts to exploring a state space of planning domains typically modeled as a directed graph. However, prohibitively large sizes of the search space make search expensive. Developing better heuristic functions has been the main {{technique for}} improving search efficiency. Nevertheless, {{recent studies have shown}} that improving heuristics alone has certain fundamental limits on improving search efficiency. Recently, a new direction of research called partial order based reduction (POR) has been proposed as an alternative to improving heuristics. POR has shown promise in speeding up searches. POR has been extensively studied in model checking research and is a key enabling technique for scalability of model checking systems. Although the POR theory has been extensively studied in model checking, it has never been developed systematically for planning before. In addition, the conditions for <b>POR</b> in the <b>model</b> checking theory are abstract and not directly applicable in planning. Previous works on POR algorithms for planning did not establish the connection between these algorithms and existing theory in model checking. In this paper, we develop a theory for POR in planning.

Since 2007, {{with the first}} efficient storage integrity protocols Proofs of Retrievability (PoR) of Juels and Kaliski, and Provable Data Possession (PDP) of Ateniese et al., many researchers worked on such protocols. The first proposals worked for static or limited dynamic data, whereas later proposals enabled fully dynamic data integrity and retrievability. Since the beginning, the difference between PDP and <b>PoR</b> <b>models</b> were greatly debated. Most notably, {{it was thought that}} dynamic PoR (DPoR) was harder than dynamic PDP (DPDP). Historically this was true: The first DPDP scheme was shown by Erway et al. in 2009, whereas the first DPoR scheme was created by Cash et al. in 2013. We show how to obtain DPoR from DPDP and PDP, together with erasure codes, making us realize that even though we did not know it, in 2009 we already could have had a DPoR solution. We propose a general framework for constructing DPoR schemes. Our framework encapsulates all known DPoR schemes as its special cases. We further show practical and interesting optimizations that enable even better performance than Chandran et al. and Shi et al. constructions. For the first time, we show how to obtain audit bandwidth for DPoR that is independent of the data size, and how the client can greatly speed up updates with O(λ n) local storage (where n is the number of blocks, and λ is the security parameter), which corresponds to less than 3 MB for 10 GB outsourced data, and can easily be obtained in today’s smart phones, let alone computers...|$|R
40|$|Having {{access to}} {{architectural}} programming information that documents the predesign {{requirements for the}} building throughout the lifecycle of a building can add value to design evaluation, facility management, renovation and extension. Building Information Modeling (BIM) is {{a new approach to}} manage the information that represents the characteristics of a building throughout its lifecycle. Architectural programming, although a key part of Architecture/Engineering/Construction/Operations (AECO) processes, has not been well integrated into Building Information Modeling (BIM) standards. Although research for many years has established computational data models for a BIM, there is not yet a comprehensive and standard data model to store architectural programming information that is compatible with BIM data modeling standards. This study investigated the possibility for a Universal Format for an Architectural Program Of Requirements (UFPOR) that can connect the architectural programming information to the BIM. Three well-known formats for architectural programming were analyzed to produce data models representing each format. The data models were further analyzed and compared to form a common data model that can bring together all three formats, producing a Universal Format for Architectural Program Of Requirements (UFPOR). The capabilities of UFPOR in representing PORs from the industry was further analyzed by <b>modeling</b> a <b>POR</b> excerpt using UFPOR. In the next phase, the data schema for the industry standard International Foundation Classes (IFC), which represents Building Information Models, was analyzed to explore its capabilities in supporting architectural programming information. Previous attempts to use IFC in documenting architectural programming information were reviewed and analyzed. The findings were compared with UFPOR to evaluate the capabilities of IFC in supporting a universal format for architectural programming. The result was a subset of IFC that can partially represent UFPOR (UFPOR-IFC). The limitations of IFC to fully support UFPOR are also discussed. In the next phase, a computer application prototype (Target) was developed based on the findings of the previous phase to demonstrate how a limited subset of architectural programming requirements can be represented in IFC based on UFPOR-IFC. The output of the application was tested to ensure the IFC physical files produced by the application accurately reflect the data inserted by the application?s user. UFPOR-IFC was tested by modeling two architectural programming documents to assess the external credibility of the findings. The devised system offers a blueprint for creating a link between real-world Architectural Programs and BIM models through IFC physical files. For future work, the findings of the study can be further analyzed by testing the extensibility of the UFPOR-IFC in modeling architectural programming requirements in different subdomains such as lighting, earthquake resilience, and acoustics. Enhancement of IFC to fully support UFPOR could also be investigated and devised. The capabilities of UFPOR-IFC to create a link between UFPOR information and other BIM models should be further tested and analyzed...|$|R

We built bacterial expression vectors for each POR variant, purified the membranes expressing normal or variant POR and characterized their activities with cytochrome c and P 450 c 17 assays.

Understanding the genetic and biochemical basis of POR-mediated drug metabolism will provide valuable information about possible differences in P 450 -mediated reactions among the individuals carrying a variant or polymorphic form of POR...|$|R
