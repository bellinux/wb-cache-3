5|$|Dating {{the monuments}} remains {{difficult}} because of the movement of many from their original contexts prior to archaeological investigation. <b>Most</b> <b>have</b> been dated to the Early Preclassic period (1500–1000BC) with some to the Middle Preclassic (1000–400BC) period.

5|$|Fossorial creatures live in {{subterranean}} environments. Many fossorial mammals {{were classified}} under the, now obsolete, order Insectivora, such as shrews, hedgehogs and moles. Fossorial mammals have a fusiform body, thickest at {{the shoulders and}} tapering off at the tail and nose. Unable {{to see in the}} dark burrows, <b>most</b> <b>have</b> degenerated eyes, but degeneration varies between species; pocket gophers, for example, are only semi-fossorial and have very small yet functional eyes, in the fully fossorial marsupial mole the eyes are degenerated and useless, talpa moles have vestigial eyes and the cape golden mole has a layer of skin covering the eyes. External ears flaps are also very small or absent. Truly fossorial mammals have short, stout legs as strength is more important than speed to a burrowing mammal, but semi-fossorial mammals have cursorial legs. The front paws are broad and have strong claws to help in loosening dirt while excavating burrows, and the back paws have webbing, as well as claws, which aids in throwing loosened dirt backwards. <b>Most</b> <b>have</b> large incisors to prevent dirt from flying into their mouth.|$|E
5|$|Ground-dwelling frogs {{generally}} {{lack the}} adaptations of aquatic and arboreal frogs. <b>Most</b> <b>have</b> smaller toe pads, if any, and little webbing. Some burrowing frogs such as Couch's spadefoot (Scaphiopus couchii) have a flap-like toe extension on the hind feet, a keratinised tubercle {{often referred to}} as a spade, that helps them to burrow.|$|E

5|$|Many {{hypotheses}} {{have been}} advanced {{as to what}} functions the cranial crest of Parasaurolophus performed, but <b>most</b> <b>have</b> been discredited.
