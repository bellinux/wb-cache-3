5|$|After {{the initial}} boom had ended, {{explicitly}} anti-foreign and racist attacks, laws and confiscatory taxes sought {{to drive out}} foreigners—not just Native Americans—from the mines, especially the Chinese and Latin American immigrants <b>mostly</b> <b>from</b> Sonora, Mexico and Chile. The toll on the American immigrants was severe as well: one in twelve forty-niners perished, as the death and crime rates during the Gold Rush were extraordinarily high, and the resulting vigilantism also took its toll.|$|E

5|$|Both sexes drum, {{although}} the male does {{so much more}} often, <b>mostly</b> <b>from</b> mid-January until the young are fledged. The far-carrying drumming is faster than for any other woodpecker in its range at around 10–16strikes per second, typically in one-second bursts, although repeated frequently. As late as {{the early twentieth century}} it was thought that the drumming might be a vocalisation, and it was not until 1943 that it was finally proved to be purely mechanical.|$|E
5|$|Forty-niners {{came from}} Latin America, {{particularly}} from the Mexican mining districts near Sonora and Chile. Gold-seekers and merchants from Asia, primarily from China, began arriving in 1849, at first in modest numbers to Gum San ("Gold Mountain"), the name given to California in Chinese.

Strachwitz's tactics quickly made news within the Wehrmacht, and even Generalfeldmarschall Albert Kesselring, Commander-in-Chief, West as of 11 March 1945, expressed an interest.

5|$|In a 1998 review, {{primatologist}} Marc Godinot recognized Sivaladapidae as {{a separate}} family within the Adapiformes, and this classification has been followed since then. Several genera in addition to Indraloris and Sivaladapis are now allocated to Sivaladapidae, which is known from the Eocene through the Miocene of China, Thailand, Myanmar, India, and Pakistan. Sivaladapids are notable for including by far the youngest adapiforms; {{members of this group}} are otherwise known <b>mostly</b> <b>from</b> the Eocene, but several sivaladapids occurred during the Miocene.|$|E
