5|$|A {{study by}} Sanchez and Wiley showed that seductive details caused poor {{learning}} outcomes because they take {{up some of}} the limited space in working memory. The experiment compared people's ability to control their attention to scientific text that contained either seductive images, relevant images, or no images. The study showed that people with low working <b>memory</b> <b>capacity</b> were especially vulnerable to the seductive details effect. Sanchez and Wiley also did an experiment where eye-tracking was monitored to evaluate how people were reading the same seductively illustrated scientific text. The results showed that people with low working memory looked at the seductive illustrations more often and for longer than those with high working <b>memory</b> <b>capacity.</b> It could be argued that differences in performance between high- and low- working <b>memory</b> <b>capacity</b> individuals is really due to general reading ability, an attribute that has been correlated with working <b>memory</b> <b>capacity</b> in other studies.|$|E
5|$|This {{vulnerability}} as {{it relates}} to low working <b>memory</b> <b>capacity</b> individuals and seductive details within textual information can also be seen as a difference between children and adult learners. Because adults, on average, having a higher working <b>memory</b> <b>capacity</b> than children, adults are less affected by seductive details than children.|$|E

Eighteen insight tasks, 10 non-insight tasks and measures of individual differences in working <b>memory</b> <b>capacities,</b> switching and inhibition were administered to 120 participants. Performance on insight problems was not linked with executive functions of inhibition or switching but was linked positively to measures of verbal and visuo-spatial working <b>memory</b> <b>capacities.</b> Non-insight task performance was positively linked to the executive function of switching (but not to inhibition) and to verbal and visuo-spatial working <b>memory</b> <b>capacities.</b> These patterns regarding executive functions were maintained when the insight and non-insight composites were split into verbal and spatial insight and non-insight composite scores. The results are discussed in relation to dual processing accounts of thinking...|$|R
40|$|The {{literature}} {{indicates that}} high daily doses of gluco-corticosteroids have a degenerating effect upon the hippocampus and thus result in reduced declarative <b>memory</b> <b>capacities.</b> In {{order to prevent}} rejection, renal transplant recipients are treated with moderate daily doses of gluco-corticosteroids and, if necessary, with high pulse-doses during a few days. The question, therefore, arises {{as to whether or}} not such standard treatments result in memory impairments. For this reason, declarative <b>memory</b> <b>capacities</b> were measured, by means of a Dutch version of Rey's 15 Words Test, in a group of 52 renal transplant recipients.

5|$|The {{circuit board}} of Radar Scope was {{restructured}} for Donkey Kong. The Radar Scope hardware, originally {{inspired by the}} Namco Galaxian hardware, was designed for {{a large number of}} enemies moving around at high speeds, which Donkey Kong did not require, so the development team removed unnecessary functions and reduced the scale of the circuit board. While the gameplay and graphics were reworked for updated ROM chips, the existing CPU, sound hardware and monitor were left intact. The character set, scoreboard, upper HUD display and font are almost identical to Radar Scope, with palette differences. The Donkey Kong hardware had the <b>memory</b> <b>capacity</b> for displaying 128 foreground sprites at 16x16 pixels each and 256 background tiles at 8x8 pixels each. Mario and all moving objects used single sprites, the taller Pauline used two sprites, and the larger Donkey Kong used six sprites.|$|E

5|$|During the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) and Super NES (SNES) eras, Nintendo and Capcom {{enjoyed a}} close relationship, with Mega Man {{as one of}} the NES' most {{prominent}} franchises. This closeness was partially due to Nintendo's monopoly of the video game console market, which allowed the company to compel third-party developers to release exclusive content according to Nintendo's schedule. Sega's rival Genesis system forced Nintendo to relax some of its restrictions on third parties with respect to the SNES. However, relations with third-party developers reached a turning point when Nintendo decided to retain a proprietary cartridge-based format for the Nintendo 64, in the face of Sony's disc-based PlayStation. Due to increased manufacturing costs and severely limited cartridge <b>memory</b> <b>capacity,</b> many third parties—Capcom included—moved to the PlayStation to start new franchises, such as Resident Evil. On this new platform, developers could create bigger games while avoiding the restriction of ordering the manufacture of expensive proprietary cartridges through Nintendo, which could lead to under- or over-stocking inventory which might eat into revenue. This third-party abandonment allowed the PlayStation to outsell the Nintendo 64 during that console generation.|$|E
5|$|Kaga {{designed}} Gaiden {{to address}} issues raised with the first game, such as tedious elements of map navigation. The system of Shadow Dragon and the Blade of Light was used as base for various improvements to aspects such as enemy AI, although the gameplay adjustments ended up removing some of the strategic elements. These elements included a navigable overworld and more overt role-playing elements, along {{with the introduction of}} the class evolution system. Balancing these elements proved challenging for the team. The game made use of the new MMC4 memory chip, developed partially in response to the <b>memory</b> <b>capacity</b> problems faced during the development of the first game. For the story, Kaga wanted to deepen the relationship between the player and their units, represented through the growth of the characters through their battles. To create a stronger and broader central narrative, Kaga created the game's dual protagonists. An overt reference to Shadow Dragon and the Blade of Light was made {{in the form of a}} trio of female Pegasus Knights, who were similar to another trio from the first game yet bore different names.|$|E

25|$|Considered to be {{a mental}} {{workspace}} enabling temporary storage and retrieval of information, working memory {{is crucial to}} problem-solving and analysis of different situations. Working <b>memory</b> <b>capacity</b> {{is a measure of}} the number of mental processing functions one is able to perform consecutively. Increases in one's working <b>memory</b> <b>capacity</b> can be accomplished with a strategy known as chunking. Aritake et al. conducted a finger sequence tapping experiment in which the subjects were shown coloured dots in sequence on a monitor corresponding to buttons on their keyboard. When a colour was shown the subject had to react by pressing the right colour on the keyboard. The subjects were separated into three groups. Group one continually trained with no periods of sleep. Group two was trained and retested over ten hours of wakefulness followed by eight hours of sleep and final testing. The third group was trained at ten pm, followed by an eight-hour sleep. This group was then tested the following morning and again later in the same day. Results displayed that wakefulness was an insignificant predictor of performance improvement, unless followed by a period of sleep. Groups that were allowed a post training sleep period, regardless of its time in reference to training, was beneficial to the improvement on the finger tapping sequences. The initial working <b>memory</b> <b>capacity</b> of the groups averaged three to four units. In groups two and three the working <b>memory</b> <b>capacity</b> was increased to an average of 5–6 units. It was proposed that sleep-dependent improvements may contribute to overall improvement in working <b>memory</b> <b>capacity</b> leading to improved fluid intelligence.|$|E

Results indicated that use of the contiguity, redundancy, and modality principles tended to increase learning outcomes for individuals with low working <b>memory</b> <b>capacities</b> but decrease learning outcomes for those with higher working <b>memory</b> <b>capacities.</b> These findings call into question the generality of these design principles, and suggest that multimedia designers should carefully consider the effects of individual differences in the human learner...|$|R
