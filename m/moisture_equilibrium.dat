50|$|Moisture participates both {{physically}} and chemically in degradation. Water absorption by synthetic materials and coatings from humidity and direct wetness is a diffusion controlled process. This hydration of the surface layers produces a volume expansion which places mechanical stress on the dry subsurface layers. A following drying out period signifies a desorption of water. The drying out of the surface layers {{would lead to a}} volume contraction; the hydrated inner layers resist this contraction, leading to surface stress cracking. This oscillation between hydrated and dehydrated states may result in stress fractures. Because of diffusion rates in organic materials, it may takes weeks or months to reach a <b>moisture</b> <b>equilibrium.</b>|$|E

Due to the relative newness of this material, minimal information regarding its performance under the duress of environmental effects is known. Composite and neat resin specimens were cycled to effective <b>moisture</b> <b>equilibrium</b> during exposure to a 85 % relative humidity/ 90 C environment followed by exposure to a 10 % relative humidity/ 90 C environment. The composite through-the-thickness moisture diffusion coefficients (Dz) ranged from 2. 3 106 to 5. 1 106 mm 2 /s. The value of Dz for moisture absorption was measured to be about 67 % greater than the value of Dz for moisture desorption; residual stress-accelerated diffusion, void-assisted diffusion, and diffusion hindered by moisture–matrix interactions are discussed as possible explanations for this difference. At 85 % relative humidity, the effective <b>moisture</b> <b>equilibrium</b> content of the composite and neat resin were 0. 52 0. 02 % and 1. 60 0. 01 %, respectively.
