500|$|When {{asked if}} Darwinism informs his {{everyday}} apprehension of life, Dawkins says, [...] "in one way it does. <b>My</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> constantly wide {{open to the}} extraordinary fact of existence. Not just human existence but the existence of life and how this breathtakingly powerful process, which is natural selection, has managed to take the very simple facts of physics and chemistry and build them up to redwood trees and humans. That's never far from my thoughts, that sense of amazement. On the other hand I certainly don't allow Darwinism to influence my feelings about human social life," [...] implying that he feels that individual human beings can {{opt out of the}} survival machine of Darwinism since they are freed by the consciousness of self.|$|E

2500|$|Of mixed {{race with}} African and European ancestry on both sides, White had {{features}} showing the latter. He emphasized in his autobiography, A Man Called White (p.3): [...] "I am a Negro. My skin is white, <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> blue, {{my hair is}} blond. The traits of my race are nowhere visible upon me." [...] Of his 32 great-great-great-grandparents, only five were black, and the other 27 were white. All members of his immediate family had fair skin, and his mother, Madeline, was also blue-eyed and blonde. The oral history of his mother's family is that her maternal grandparents were Dilsia, a slave and concubine, and her master, William Henry Harrison. Harrison had six children with Dilsia and, much later, {{was elected president of}} the United States. Madeline's mother, Marie Harrison, was one of Dilsia's daughters by Harrison. Held as a slave in La Grange, Georgia, where she had been sold, Marie became a concubine to Augustus Ware. The wealthy white man bought her a house, had four children with her, and passed on some wealth to them. White and his family identified as Negro and lived among Atlanta's Negro community.|$|E
