5|$|Among the <b>most</b> <b>serious</b> disease {{problems}} are fireblight, a bacterial disease; and Gymnosporangium rust, and black spot, two fungal diseases. Codling moths and apple maggots {{are two other}} pests which affect apple trees. Young apple trees are also prone to mammal pests like mice and deer, which feed on the soft bark of the trees, especially in winter.|$|E
5|$|As of January 2014, {{and since}} the {{introduction}} of the euro, interest rates of most members countries (particularly those with a weak currency), have decreased. The countries whose interest rates fell most {{as a result of the}} adoption of the euro are Greece, Ireland, Portugal, Spain, and Italy. These very countries have had the <b>most</b> <b>serious</b> sovereign financing problems.|$|E

Other enterprise- and HPC-focused processor lines include Oracle's and Fujitsu's SPARC processors and IBM's POWER microprocessors. Measured by quantity sold, Itanium's <b>most</b> <b>serious</b> competition comes from x86-64 processors including Intel's own Xeon line and AMD's Opteron line. Since 2009, most servers were being shipped with x86-64 processors.|$|E

5|$|Parsnip {{leaves are}} {{sometimes}} tunnelled by the larvae of the celery fly (Euleia heraclei). Irregular, pale brown passages {{can be seen}} between {{the upper and lower}} surfaces of the leaves. The effects are <b>most</b> <b>serious</b> on young plants, as whole leaves may shrivel and die. Treatment is by removing affected leaflets or whole leaves, or by chemical means.|$|E
5|$|Several {{complications}} {{can occur}} {{as a result of}} SCSFLS including decreased cranial pressure, brain herniation, infection, blood pressure problems, transient paralysis, and coma. The primary and <b>most</b> <b>serious</b> complication of SCSFLS is spontaneous intracranial hypotension, where pressure in the brain is severely decreased. This complication leads to the hallmark symptom of severe orthostatic headaches.|$|E
5|$|The <b>most</b> <b>serious</b> {{potential}} {{adverse effect}} of biguanide use is metformin-associated lactic acidosis (MALA). Though the incidence for MALA about nine per 100,000 person-years, {{this is not}} different from the background incidence of lactic acidosis in the general population. A systematic review concluded no data exists to definitively link metformin to lactic acidosis. Lactic acidosis can be fatal.|$|E
25|$|Atrial {{fibrillation}} is the <b>most</b> common <b>serious</b> abnormal heart rhythm. In Europe and North America, as of 2014, {{it affects}} about 2% to 3% of the population. This {{is an increase}} from 0.4 to 1% of the population around 2005.|$|R

The widespread implementation of several preventive measures is, at least in part, associated with the observed decrease in VAP incidence [2].|$|R
5|$|The pair {{defends the}} chosen nest site against other peregrines, and often against ravens, herons, and gulls, and if ground-nesting, also such mammals as foxes, wolverines, felids, bears, wolves, and {{mountain}} lions. Both nests and (less frequently) adults are predated by larger-bodied raptorial birds like eagles, large owls, or gyrfalcons. The <b>most</b> <b>serious</b> predators of peregrine nests in North America and Europe are the {{great horned owl}} and the Eurasian eagle owl. When reintroductions have been attempted for peregrines, the <b>most</b> <b>serious</b> impediments were these two owls routinely picking off nestlings, fledglings and adults by night. Peregrines defending their nests have managed to kill raptors as large as golden eagles and bald eagles (both of which they normally avoid as potential predators) that have come {{too close to the}} nest by ambushing them in a full stoop. In one instance, when a snowy owl killed a newly fledged peregrine, the larger owl was in turn killed by a stooping peregrine parent.|$|E
5|$|To appease {{those who}} {{considered}} her sex {{to be the}} <b>most</b> <b>serious</b> obstacle, Maria Theresa assumed masculine titles. Thus, in nomenclature, Maria Theresa was archduke and king; normally, however, she was styled as queen.

5|$|A modern {{repeat of}} the 1858 storm is {{estimated}} to cause damages of {{hundreds of millions of}} dollars. A {{repeat of the}} 1939 tropical storm would cause around 200million dollars in damage. The <b>most</b> <b>serious</b> damage would be due to rains rather than winds or storm surge, although distant hurricanes may still create heavy surf, possibly injuring or killing people. Nora caused millions in damage and skirted extreme southeastern California.|$|E

He also wrote at least two symphonies: an undated in A minor and a Sinfonia (1947 or 1967).|$|R
50|$|The Lancashire Heeler {{has a life}} {{expectancy}} of 12-15 years or more.

As well as these eye conditions, dogs of this breed may suffer from Patella luxation.|$|R
5|$|As {{early as}} 1857, {{the need for}} a {{lighthouse}} on Point Stephens was identified, due to the proximity to the entrance of Port Stephens, and the dangers of the local coastline to ships. Another reason was that mariners were mistaking the entrance to Fingal Bay for that of Port Stephens. At least twenty four vessels are known to have been wrecked in the area. the <b>most</b> <b>serious</b> being the Dove in 1828 with the loss of seven lives, and the Pandora in 1836 with five lives. Another notable wreck was the Florence Irving in 1877.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{richness}} of high-quality habitats in Yosemite, the brown bear, California condor, and least Bell's vireo have become extinct in the park within historical time, and another 37 species currently have special status under either California or federal endangered species legislation. The <b>most</b> <b>serious</b> current threats to Yosemite's wildlife and the ecosystems they occupy include loss of a natural fire regime, exotic species, air pollution, habitat fragmentation, and climate change. On a more local basis, factors such as road kills {{and the availability of}} human food have affected some wildlife species.|$|E
5|$|Even {{after the}} Christianisation of the Rus', however, {{relations}} {{were not always}} friendly. The <b>most</b> <b>serious</b> conflict between the two powers was the war of 968–971 in Bulgaria, but several Rus' raiding expeditions against the Byzantine cities of the Black Sea coast and Constantinople itself are also recorded. Although most were repulsed, they were often followed by treaties that were generally favourable to the Rus', {{such as the one}} concluded {{at the end of the}} war of 1043, during which the Rus' gave an indication of their ambitions to compete with the Byzantines as an independent power.|$|E
