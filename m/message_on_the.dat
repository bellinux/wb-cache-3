5|$|In 1942, Hepburn {{returned}} to Broadway {{to appear in}} another Philip Barry play, Without Love, which was also written with the actress in mind. Critics were unenthusiastic about the production but with Hepburn's popularity at a high it ran for 16 sold-out weeks. MGM was eager to reunite Tracy and Hepburn for a new picture, and settled on Keeper of the Flame (1942). A dark mystery with a propaganda <b>message</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> dangers of fascism, the film was seen by Hepburn {{as an opportunity to}} make a worthy political statement. It received poor notices but was a financial success, confirming the popularity of the Tracy–Hepburn pairing.|$|E
5|$|In the episode's epilogue, Jones, {{having been}} {{transferred}} to secured hospital, is rescued by his men, leaving a <b>message</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> wall telling Olivia she passed. Meanwhile, Walter, who has also started reading the ZFT, recognizes a unique offset letter, and finds that his own lab typewriter produces the same offset. Olivia receives a call from Nina who had further looked into the Cortexiphan trials and discovered a smaller case study that occurred at Jacksonville.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} episode, it is {{revealed}} that Pauline, aged 40, is {{pregnant with her}} third child. The character's pregnancy quickly became a prominent storyline within the series. Pauline, against her mother's opposition, is determined to keep the baby. The storyline was used to spread a public <b>message</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> increased risk of genetic defects in late pregnancies, with Pauline undergoing amniocentesis tests. The storyline culminates {{with the birth of}} the serial's first baby, Martin, in July 1985.|$|E

5|$|The {{prints were}} {{intended}} {{as a form of}} moral instruction; Hogarth was dismayed by the routine acts of cruelty he witnessed on the streets of London. Issued on cheap paper, the prints were destined for the lower classes. The series shows a roughness of execution and a brutality that is untempered by the funny touches common in Hogarth's other works, but which he felt was necessary to impress his <b>message</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> intended audience. Nevertheless, the pictures still carry the wealth of detail and subtle references that are characteristic of Hogarth.|$|E
5|$|When Seungsahn {{first began}} {{teaching}} in the United States, there was an underemphasis in his <b>message</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> significance of zazen. Under advice from some students, however, he soon came to incorporate zazen into the curriculum more frequently. More than {{a few of his}} earliest students had practiced Zen previously under the Sōtō priest Shunryū Suzuki, laying out a convincing argument about how zazen and Zen were seen as inseparable in the Western psyche.|$|E

5|$|Massive {{flooding}} in the Midwest {{resulted in the}} Sounds and the Iowa Cubs played a game with an official attendance of zero on June 14, 2008. Though downtown Des Moines was under a mandatory evacuation, team officials received permission from the city {{to play the game}} as long as no fans were allowed into Principal Park. In order to keep fans away, the lights and scoreboard were not turned on, the game was not broadcast in the local market, and a <b>message</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> team's website announced that the game was postponed. PCL Commissioner Branch Rickey III believed that {{this was the first time}} such actions were taken out of necessity. Kremblas' Sounds ended with a 59–81record, the second-lowest in the team's history.|$|E
5|$|Tammi Peyton enters AAA-1 Surekill Exterminators {{and plays}} her message machine, which {{contains}} the victim's {{phone call from}} the previous night. She attempts to get into her right desk drawer, when Dwight walks in, and begins harassing her about a <b>message</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> machine. She mentions the murder to Dwight, and he responds by asking her to try to get Randall on the phone. Dwight then confronts Randall in the alley; Dwight tells him that he doesn't mind what he does, as long as he asks first. Later, Scully and Doggett investigate the Chase residence and find a bullet casing on the floor. Doggett notes that {{it would be difficult to}} miss a target in a confined space, but Scully notes it would have if the gunman was shooting from outside. Eventually, Scully proposes that the killer can perceive wave lengths of light not visible with an ordinary human eye, allowing him to virtually see through walls.|$|E

25|$|Especially {{popular in}} this period were vanitas paintings, in which sumptuous {{arrangements}} of fruit and flowers, books, statuettes, vases, coins, jewelry, paintings, musical and scientific instruments, military insignia, fine silver and crystal, were accompanied by symbolic reminders of life's impermanence. Additionally, a skull, an hourglass or pocket watch, a candle burning down or a book with pages turning, {{would serve as a}} moralizing <b>message</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ephemerality of sensory pleasures.

Students know when they can begin to paint over the previous <b>message</b> <b>on</b> <b>The</b> Rawk by the two smaller rocks in front of it; one for the date, and one for the time at which the message was painted.

25|$|The {{first trial}} lasted {{three weeks and}} {{took place at the}} Dunedin High Court in May 1995. The Crown put forward that Bain shot to death his mother, two sisters and brother in {{undetermined}} order before going on his morning paper run. On his return he waited for his father to come in from the caravan and go into the lounge to pray and then shot him from behind the computer alcove curtain, typed the <b>message</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> computer, arranged the scene {{to make it look like}} a suicide, and called 111.

25|$|Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark's 1980 song Enola Gay {{depicts the}} events of the 1945 {{deployment}} of nuclear weapons on Hiroshima {{from the point of view}} of the crew of the B29 Superfortress Bomber Enola Gay. Clear references are made to the exact time the bomb detonated ("It's eight fifteen, and that's the time that it's always been"), and questions are asked as to whether the action was necessary. The song also references a supposed radio message in which the crew detail no anomalies as a result of nuclear detonation ("We got your <b>message</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> radio - conditions normal and you're coming home"); the American government denied any rumours of radiation sickness associated with the dropping of the bombs.|$|E
25|$|Lütjens radioed Wilhelmshaven and Berlin and all {{the naval}} {{commands}} concerning the sinking of Hood continually until his message was acknowledged. It was received only at 14:40 in Berlin. Aboard Prinz Eugen Captain Brinkmann noted that such actions were dangerous. He recorded in the ships' war diary that Lütjens' insistence on radioing every change of course to the shore commands; then confirmed by a final “Execute!” order, was unnecessary and risky. In {{the morning of the}} 25 May, his 52nd birthday, Lütjens persisted by sending a long <b>message</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Hood action. It was apparent that he mistakenly believed he was still under surveillance by the British and thus any message could do no harm since his position was known to the enemy.|$|E
