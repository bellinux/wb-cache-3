40|$|Abstract. Many {{industrial}} {{manufacturing processes}} {{depend on the}} rapid and accurate measurement of circular objects, for example, pipe, tube and ball and roller bearings, {{to ensure that the}} components satisfy the engineering tolerance standards. Despite the importance of these measurements, they are often carried out using time-consuming, manual and randomly sampled procedures. Cross-sectional imaging techniques offer the advantage of simultaneous dense <b>measurement</b> <b>of</b> <b>dimensions</b> and the detection of defects. Levels of precision achievable using x-ray computed tomography (CT) to measure circular objects are determined here. Edge detection procedures have achieved subpixel measurement to a precision of 3. 5 x 10 − 2 pixels (17 microns) using a medical x-ray CT scanner. Even when the image function is properly sampled and the image is a perfect isotropic disc, it is possible for significant anisotropic effects to be introduced when sampled data is processed. Methods of overcoming such effects are described as are techniques for handling image noise. ...|$|E

However, automatic and accurate <b>measurement</b> <b>of</b> <b>dimensions,</b> especially girths, is an issue of concern to many designers and footwear developers. Existing methods for measuring girths are primarily based on points or generated triangles, but their accuracy is heavily dependent on the density of the point cloud data. In this paper we present the use of the Radial Basis Function (RBF) surface modelling technique for measuring girths as it has the advantage of being able to operate on unorganised three-dimensional points, so that the generated surface passes through every scanned point, while repairing incomplete meshes. To overcome the high computational expense of the RBF method, local surface recovery, octree division and combination, inverse power method and improved Cholesky factorisation are used. The girth measurements obtained from adopting these approaches are compared against the existing measurement methods. Experimental results demonstrate that the local RBF implicit surface can provide more stable and accurate measurements using relatively less time, proving its value in custom footwear manufacture. close 2...|$|E

40|$|There is {{a growing}} {{awareness}} that research of the etiology of depressive and anxiety disorders has been hampered by their strictly categorical definition in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM). The DSM uses a syndrome approach, which – although beneficial for standardization - has inherent problems that make it suboptimal for research: high rates of (artificial) comorbidity, diagnostic heterogeneity and the unrealistic assumption of discontinuity between ill and healthy. A dimensional approach that focusses on the relative severity of continuous symptom domains could be more optimal but measurement and the added value of such dimensions has been debated. Therefore, this dissertation was aimed to investigate (1) the internal validity and possibility to measure dimensions and (2) their added value in etiological and clinical research. The results showed that <b>measurement</b> <b>of</b> <b>dimensions</b> can be optimized using self-report questionnaires. In addition, dimensions were shown to have added value in etiological and clinical research. Because of their specific and continuous nature, dimensions {{could be used to}} uncover symptom-specific and/or non-linear association. Together, the results suggest that dimensions of depression and anxiety have internal and external validity and have the potential to improve the psychiatric research...|$|E

Thus the measurement of the refractive index of air and application of the instantaneous value of the index to all of measurement interferometric axes is necessary. In the work we developed new concept of electronic unit which is able to monitor the refractive index of air on basis of measurement of weather conditions: temperature, humidity and pressure of the air. The unit uses modified Edlen formula for calculation of the refractive index. The next step of the work is verification of accuracy of the measuring capability of the unit. We tested the accuracy with reference unit which measure the refractive index of air by a set of etalon sensors. The expected accuracy of the smart electronic unit falls to the 4. 1 exp(- 7) relatively.

40|$|AUTHORS ' SYNOPSIS An {{ultrasonic}} {{transit time}} device was modified to permit close {{placement of the}} crystals and to broaden the effective spatial angle of the beam of ultrasound. The device is ideal for chronic animal experiments since its output is linear for displacement and calibration may be performed at any time. Displacement, and its derivatives with respect to time, are fundamental variables of the cardio-vascular system. For animal experimentation, several methods are satisfactory for acute studies, but few are suited to chronic implantation studies which require linear systems with instant cali-bration. Ultrasonic methods were introduced in-to physiological research by Rushmer, Franklin, and Ellis (1956) with barium titanate crystals sutured to the external wall of the left ventricle. The instrument was an electronic tube design. In {{the search for a}} transducer system capable of recording dimensions of blood vessels, we developed a transistorized version of the 3 megahertz ultrasound device, which permitted stable recordings of small dimensions. Further changes have been introduced to overcome the problem of extreme directionality of the beam of ultrasound. The modifications consist of replacement of the transmitter output trans-former to decrease the excitation pulse duration, and the use of transistors in the transit time converter for <b>measurement</b> <b>of</b> <b>dimensions</b> as small as 3 mm...|$|E

Results {{obtained from the}} analysis of anisotropy {{can be used for}} evaluation of material properties and parameters of technology processes. Stereological metallography was used for describing of structure anisotropy. In case of plastically deformed material, degree of orientation of grain boundaries was determined. Grain boundaries are decomposed into isotropic, planar and linear oriented components - specific surface area of grain boundaries and these parameters were measured using oriented test lines stereology method. These results were used for estimation of local plastic deformation using conversion model of orientation grain boundaries to deformation of grains. Our proposed conversion method enables estimation of local plastic deformation in arbitrary place of body with arbitrary state of initial deformation. In case of short fibre reinforced thermoplastics oriented test plane stereology method was used for estimation of experimental orientation of fibres. Degree of orientation was estimated from the number of intersections of fibres with test planes and from these results components of an orientation tensor are estimated. This method is very simple in comparison with a current method which is based on <b>measurement</b> <b>of</b> <b>dimensions</b> and orientation of lot of fibre intersections in analyzed plane...|$|E
40|$|A hybrid scheme {{combining}} Particle Image Velocimetry and Shadow Image Velocimetry {{has been}} used for a full-volume, three-dimensional, transient study of the shape, trajectory and forces acting on air bubbles rising in stagnant tap water in restricted media. The bubble Reynolds number ranged from 400 to 650. The three-dimensional reconstruction of the bubble was accomplished by combining images from two orthogonal views. This reconstruction process allowed for <b>measurement</b> <b>of</b> <b>dimensions,</b> orientation, trajectory, rotation, velocity and accel- eration of an individual rising bubble. These parameters were then used to compute drag and lift forces acting on the bubble. Instantaneous values of drag and lift coefficients were then determined. These experimental results were compared to known experimental data and val- ues obtained from correlations found in scientific literature. It was found that correlations intended for determining drag coefficient values should be adequately modified when necessary to account for wall impact, since the drag coefficient magnitude is considerably higher than that predicted by such correlations at Re below 550. Regarding the bubble lift coefficient, instantaneous data scatter noticeably as a function of Re, but average values agree within the range of known data. The major contributors to the uncertainty in this experiment were the capability of accurately reconstructing the 2 D shape of the bubbles from distorted and/or incomplete PIV images and determining the bubble centroid. An overall error of 7 % was computed for the drag coefficient, but it rises up to 44 % for the lift coefficient...|$|E
