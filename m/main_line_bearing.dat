40|$|There are {{at least}} two forms of {{cellular}} receptors for interleukin 2 (IL- 2); one with a very high affinity and the other with a lower affinity. We identified a non-Tac IL- 2 binding peptide with a relative molecular weight of 75, 000 (p 75). Cell <b>lines</b> <b>bearing</b> either the p 55 Tac or the p 75 peptide alone manifested low-affinity IL- 2 binding, whereas a cell <b>line</b> <b>bearing</b> both peptides manifested both high- and low-affinity receptors. After the internalization of labeled IL- 2 through high-affinity receptors, the p 75 peptide could not be detected by cross-linking studies. Furthermore, fusion of cell membranes from low-affinity IL- 2 binding cell <b>lines</b> <b>bearing</b> the Tac peptide alone with membranes from a cell <b>line</b> <b>bearing</b> the p 75 peptide alone generated hybrid membranes bearing high-affinity receptors. These results suggest a multichain model for the high-affinity IL- 2 receptor in which high-affinity receptors would be expressed when both Tac and p 75 IL- 2 binding peptides are present and associated in a receptor complex...|$|R

50|$|Today, {{changes have}} been made in the {{terminology}} making the number of <b>main</b> <b>lines</b> four. The northwestern <b>main</b> <b>line</b> is not considered a <b>main</b> <b>line</b> anymore and is renamed Värmlandsbanan. The southern <b>main</b> <b>line</b> between Nässjö and Falköping is also degraded since now what was the Eastern <b>main</b> <b>line</b> (Nässjö - Katrineholm) is considered a part of the southern one. The Norrland cross line is not a <b>main</b> <b>line</b> anymore, but a regional railway. Finally the northern <b>main</b> <b>line</b> south of Ockelbo refers to another and shorter way than that through Avesta. Sometimes the Ostkustbanan Stockholm-Sundsvall is now considererd a <b>main</b> <b>line,</b> since it has the majority of the passenger traffic into Norrland.
