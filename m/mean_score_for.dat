30|$|Overall, {{this study}} {{examined}} the relationship between personality traits and entrepreneurial intent considering the influence of grit. Our study made a unique contribution in that we introduced grit as a potential mechanism through which personality traits relate to entrepreneurial intent. The results confirmed that there was a strong positive association between grit and entrepreneurial intentions. It was also found that grit shared a significant positive correlation with both agreeableness and conscientiousness. Conversely, there was a significant negative correlation between grit and neuroticism. When the sample was segmented into high and low grit participants, the high grit participants emerged as having significantly higher <b>means</b> <b>scores</b> <b>for</b> entrepreneurial intent than their counterparts in the low grit group. We also found that in comparison with the low grit group, high grit participants had higher <b>means</b> <b>scores</b> <b>for</b> agreeableness and conscientiousness, and lower <b>means</b> <b>scores</b> <b>for</b> neuroticism. Lastly, the data indicated that grit fully mediated the predictive effect of conscientious and neuroticism on entrepreneurial intent.|$|R

As {{a principle of}} caring for diabetes, recommending patients to lose weight through more physical activities and a restrictive diet has a long history. The present study was carried out aiming at determining and comparing dietary style and physical activity in women with gestational diabetes and healthy pregnant women. This descriptive-comparative study was carried out simultaneously on 200 pregnant women (with gestational diabetes and healthy). Tools for data collection were questionnaires of dietary style and physical activity during pregnancy. After obtaining research informed consent from samples, sampling was done by multi-stage convenience random sampling. Data was analyzed using SPSS 21. The {{results of the study}} revealed that the demographic and obstetric variables were identical. The <b>mean</b> <b>scores</b> <b>for</b> the dietary style of case and control groups were 65. 05 and 74. 12, P < 0. 001 respectively.

40|$|Graduation date: 1984 The {{primary purpose}} of the present study was to {{investigate}} the effect of peer presence upon the health-related physical fitness test scores of college students. A total of 312 undergraduate college students, 156 males and 156 females, 18 through 29 years of age, randomly selected from the physical education activity lists at Oregon State University were used in this study. The subjects were divided equally into three groups and randomly assigned to one of the following methods of testing: method A coacting; method B, audience; and method C, individual. In the coacting group, four subjects of the same sex were tested at the same time. In the audience group, subjects were tested individually in the presence of four peers, 2 males and 2 females. Subjects in the third group, method C, were tested alone without the presence of an audience or co-actors. The dependent variables were three test items from American Alliance for Health Physical Education Recreation and Dance, Health-Related Physical Fitness Test (1980). The test items included were: 1) the twelve-minute-run-and-walk test, as a measure of cardiovascular endurance, 2) sit-up test for 60 seconds, as a measure of muscular strength and muscular endurance, and 3) sit and reach test, as a measure of flexibility. A two by three analysis of variance fixed model was used as the statistical tool to test the null hypotheses. An alpha level of. 05 was established. The results of this study indicated that there was a significant difference between the male and female health-related physical fitness test <b>scores</b> <b>for</b> college students. Male <b>mean</b> <b>scores</b> were greater than the female <b>mean</b> <b>scores</b> <b>for</b> the twelve-minute-run-and-walk test and the sit-up test; however, female <b>mean</b> <b>scores</b> were greater than the male <b>mean</b> <b>scores</b> <b>for</b> the sit and reach test.

50|$|For {{additive}} tasks {{the mean}} {{level of a}} trait may be most appropriate because these tasks are structured so that the contribution of each member adds to a collective pool {{that can be used}} to help the team succeed. The most common operationalization is to calculate a <b>mean</b> <b>score</b> <b>for</b> the individual measures. This approach assumes that the amount of a characteristic possessed by each individual member increases the collective pool of that characteristic. That is, more of a trait is always better or worse, regardless of how that characteristic is distributed among team members. The mean score of individual measures is, however, potentially problematic in some instances because aggregation can mask important information when individual characteristics do not combine additively to form a collective resource pool. A team score for a particular characteristic can also be measured by taking the average, or mean, of all team member scores. Using this method, the amount of each trait for individual members is combined to form a group-level measurement of that trait. For example, cohesion could be measured this way. This would be accomplished by providing team members with a survey for them to assess cohesive traits (i.e. cooperation, harmony) and then calculating the average of the survey scores. General Mental Ability (GMA), conscientiousness, agreeableness and emotional stability are examples of a team composition attributes that could be operationalized utilizing the mean.|$|E
