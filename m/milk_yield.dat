5|$|The {{breeding}} of farm animals seldom occurs spontaneously but is managed by farmers {{with a view}} to encouraging certain traits that are seen as desirable. These include hardiness, prolificness, mothering abilities, fast growth rates, low feed consumption per unit of growth, better body proportions, higher yields, better fibre qualities and other characteristics. Undesirable traits such as health defects, aggressiveness or lack of docility are selected against. Selective breeding has been responsible for some large increases in productivity. In 2007, a typical broiler chicken at eight weeks old was 4.8 times as heavy as a bird of similar age in 1957.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{effect of}} choline {{chloride}} supplementation through forced drinking combined with concentrate diets containing Ca-fish oil on milk production and milk composition of Etawah Grade goats was evaluated. Choline chloride {{is an essential}} component in ruminant diets as it is required for fat metabolism. Method The experiment was conducted in a completely randomized block design with three types of treatments and eight replications. The trial had two successive experimental periods; the first, during the eight weeks of late pregnancy, and the second, during the first 12 weeks of lactation. Twenty-four Etawah Grade does in the second gestation period were divided into three treatment groups. Commercial choline chloride 60  % in corncobs-based powder {{was used as a}} source of choline chloride. The treatments were no supplementation (control) and supplemented with either 4 g or 8 g/ 2 days of choline chloride. Choline chloride was given to the animals through a forced drinking technique, after dissolving it in 60 ml drinking water. The initial body weight of does was 38. 81 [*]±[*] 3. 66 kg. The does were penned individually, and were given fresh chopped King Grass ad libitum and 700 g/day of concentrate diets containing Ca-fish oil, starting eight weeks prior to expecting kidding and continuing for 12 weeks of parturition. Results All nutrient intakes were not significantly different (p[*]>[*] 0. 05) among the treatments during the late pregnancy and the lactation periods. Supplementation did not affect (p[*]>[*] 0. 05) the average daily gains and feed conversion ratio during pregnancy but gave effects (p[*]<[*] 0. 05) on the average daily gains, feed conversion ratio and income over feed cost during lactation. The highest average daily <b>milk</b> <b>yields</b> and 4  % fat corrected <b>milk</b> <b>yields</b> were found in goats supplemented with 4 g/ 2 days of choline chloride and increased by 17. 00  % and 24. 67  %, respectively, compared to the control. Moreover, milk composition percentage and <b>milk</b> constituent <b>yields</b> improved significantly (p[*]<[*] 0. 05) in those supplemented with 4 g/ 2 days of choline chloride. Conclusion The supplementation of 4 g/ 2 days of choline chloride through forced drinking increased <b>milk</b> <b>yields,</b> the 4  % fat corrected <b>milk</b> <b>yields,</b> <b>milk</b> composition, <b>milk</b> constituent <b>yields,</b> and improved feed conversion ratio and income over feed cost of Etawah Grade goats...|$|R
40|$|Peri-urban dairy {{producers}} in West Africa face major production constraints including inadequate and poor quality feeds. In {{view of the}} high cost of traditional supplementary feeds such as oilseed cakes, the production of forage, especially legumes, is increasingly being advocated. However, it has not been established whether returns in terms of increased livestock productivity from sown forages will be adequate to encourage smallholder livestock owners to undertake forage production for indigenous livestock. In three trials involving indigenous Bunaji cows biological and economic responses in terms of <b>milk</b> <b>yields</b> to farmer-planted forage legumes and tree legumes from home gardens were evaluated. Synthesis of the resulting data on labour inputs, forage <b>yields,</b> feed intakes, <b>milk</b> <b>yields,</b> value of outputs and cost of inputs such as seeds and fertilizers showed that for the semi-intensive smallholder and zero-grazed models considered in this study, the margin or profit from using home-grown fodder was 5 - 8 times the cost of acquiring the feed. The opportunity cost of using the land for forage production rather than for cultivating sorghum, a highly favoured cereal crop, was only 67 percent of the accrued benefits from <b>milk</b> <b>yields</b> produced by cows supplemented with the forage hays. Thus, there is a real potential for profitable dairy production in peri-urban areas using home-grown fodder...|$|R
