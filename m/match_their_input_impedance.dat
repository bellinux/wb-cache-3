40|$|As {{they are}} spread across almost all {{applications}} based on electrical circuits, frequency filters form {{one of the}} most complex issues on electronic devices. There exist a great number of different design methods based on various approaches. A large group of these filters is based on active components, namely amplifiers, that are equipped with the appropriate feedback to achieve the desired transfer function. In terms of applications operating at audible frequencies it became to be a rule that one or two operational amplifiers are applied, taking into consideration that <b>their</b> <b>input</b> <b>impedance</b> and amplification factor are infinitely high, whilst their output impedance is infinitely low. The simulation results presented in this paper show that these considerations may not be so strict. That means the <b>input</b> <b>impedance</b> may be in tens of kiloohms and the amplification factor of 40 dB without the feedback loop can do enough. Moreover, the operational amplifiers may be replaced by a simple circuit consisting of two transistors, as it is shown in this paper. This should be considered when calculating manufacturing costs of several designs. In this paper, a detailed description of a band pass filter for a third octave equalizer is presented.

30|$|The {{proposed}} approach introduces an autosuggest {{service that}} considers the semantic {{flavor of the}} query suggestions that are recommended to the searchers by <b>matching</b> <b>their</b> <b>input</b> against Wikipedia’s titles. Ambiguous terms are properly disambiguated and the deriving disambiguations are prioritized within {{the list of the}} provided suggestions. Thus, the searcher’s input “jaguar” leads to a list of disambiguated query suggestions that contain the not-so-popular information need “jaguar (animal)” (see Fig.  3), which, in turn, results in a list full of useful resources about such a need. The service is benefited from the fact that disambiguated words/phrases in Wikipedia appear as article titles that provide contextual words within parentheses after the ambiguous word/phrase. Thus, an autosuggest service that performs prefix search over an index of such literals results in a list of semantically disambiguated suggestions.|$|R
30|$|We assume {{services}} are applicable once {{the information they}} need is available, that is, there exist some data that <b>match</b> <b>their</b> <b>input</b> parameters, usually the output of another service. Therefore, the state of the system in a given moment is determined by the parameter instances (data) available, and the precondition of a service is its set of input parameters. Parameter instances are consumed but cannot disappear, i.e., there are no negative effects on invoking a service (which only adds more data to the system). Therefore, no mutual exclusion relations will exist between services in our approach (a service cannot prevent another from being called by suppressing its inputs), making the problem easier to solve. In our case, additional constraints are added in order {{to improve the quality of}} the solutions, as discussed in the following sections.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—A {{metamaterial}} {{paradigm for}} achieving an efficient, electrically small antenna is introduced. Spherical shells of homogenous, isotropic negative permittivity (ENG) material {{are designed to}} create electrically small resonant systems for several antennas: an infinitesimal electric dipole, a very short center-fed cylindrical electric dipole, and a very short coaxially-fed electric monopole over an infinite ground plane. Analytical and numerical models demonstrate that a properly designed ENG shell provides a distributed inductive element resonantly matched to these highly capacitive electrically small antennas, i. e., an ENG shell can be designed to produce an electrically small system with a zero input reactance and an input resistance that is matched to a specified source resistance leading to overall efficiencies approaching unity. Losses and dispersion characteristics of the ENG materials are {{also included in the}} analytical models. Finite element numerical models of the various antenna-ENG shell systems are developed and used to predict <b>their</b> <b>input</b> <b>impedances.</b> These electrically small antenna-ENG shell systems with idealized dispersionless ENG material properties are shown to be very efficient and to have fractional bandwidths above the values associated with the Chu limit for the quality factor without any degradation in the radiation patterns of the antennas. Introducing dispersion and losses into the analytical models, the resulting bandwidths are shown to be reduced significantly, but remain slightly above (below) the corresponding Chu-based value for an energy-based limiting (Drude) dispersion model of the permittivity of the ENG shell.

We measured the spectral characteristics of membrane voltage noise in vitro at the soma and the apical dendrite of layer 4 / 5 (L 4 / 5) neocortical neurons of rats near the resting potential. We found a remarkable similarity between the voltage noise power spectra at the soma and the dendrites, despite a marked difference in <b>their</b> respective <b>input</b> <b>impedances.</b> At both sites, the noise levels and the <b>input</b> <b>impedance</b> are voltage dependent; in the soma, the noise level increased from σ = 0. 33 ± 0. 28 mV at 10 mV hyperpolarization from the resting potential to σ = 0. 59 ± 0. 3 at a depolarization of 10 mV. At the dendrite, the noise increased from σ = 0. 34 ± 0. 28 to σ = 0. 56 ± 0. 30 mV, respectively. TTX reduced both the <b>input</b> <b>impedance</b> and the voltage noise, and eliminated their voltage dependence at both locations. We describe a detailed compartmental model of a L 4 / 5 neuron with simplified electrical properties that successfully reproduces the difference in <b>input</b> <b>impedance</b> between dendrites and soma and demonstrates that spatially uniform conductance-base noise sources leads to an apparent isopotential structure which exhibits a uniform power spectra of voltage noise at all locations.

40|$|Traditional didjeridus have a {{broad range}} of bore {{geometries}} with many details not immediately apparent to a player, and are therefore suitable for examining the relationship between perceived quality and physical properties. Seven experienced players assessed the overall playing quality of 38 didjeridus that spanned a wide range of quality, pitch, and geometry, as well as 11 plastic cylindrical pipes. The ranking of these instruments was correlated with detailed measurements of <b>their</b> acoustic <b>input</b> <b>impedance</b> spectra. Most significantly, the ranked quality of a didjeridu was found to be negatively correlated with the magnitude of its acoustic <b>input</b> <b>impedance,</b> particularly in the frequency range from 1 to 2 kHz. This is in accord with the fact that maxima in the impedance of the player`s vocal tract can inhibit acoustic flow, and consequently sound production, once the magnitude of these impedance maxima becomes comparable with or greater than those of the instrument. This produces the varying spectral peaks or formants in the sound envelope that characterize this instrument. Thus an instrument with low impedance and relatively weak impedance maxima in this frequency range would allow players greater control of the formants in the output sound and thus lead to a higher perceived playing quality...|$|R

The aim {{of this study is to}} develop numerical tools for the analysis and optimisation of such horns, with respect to <b>their</b> <b>input</b> <b>impedance</b> spectra. Important effects such as visco-thermal damping and modal conversion are shown to be localised to different parts of a typical brass instrument. This makes it possible to construct hybrid methods that apply different numerical techniques in different parts of the instrument. Narrow and slowly flaring parts are modelled using a one-dimensional transmission line analogy, and the rapidly flaring bell is modelled using a two-dimensional finite-difference method. The connection between the different regions is done by the aid of impedance boundary conditions. The use of such boundary conditions is investigated with respect to the required number of degrees of freedom. Numerical shape optimisation is employed in order to design horns with desired impedance characteristics throughout a design frequency band. A loudspeaker horn is optimised with respect to its sound power output, and a brass instrument is optimised with respect to its intonation. The horns are modelled using the finite-element method and a transmission line analogy. In order to achieve rapid convergence of the optimisation, gradient based minimisation algorithms are used. A prerequisite for success is the ability to accurately and inexpensively compute the gradient of the objective function. The gradient for the finite-element method is computed by an adjoint equation technique, whereas for the transmission line analogy, it is derived by formal differentiation of the model. In order to find smooth solutions, a smoothing technique is used, where optimisation is done with respect to the right hand side of a Poisson type equation...|$|R
5000|$|Looking Glass Self is a sociological {{term that}} was {{introduced}} {{by a man named}} Charles Horton Cooley. This term makes a connection between the reactions of a group and the reactions of an individual. Cooley is saying that a person's opinion of oneself is determined by the opinions of those around them. The group around the person acts as a mirror for them and shows a reflection of how they should view themselves. According to this, if the group thinks an individual is [...] "odd" [...] the individual will view themselves as [...] "odd". This relates to identity control theory in many ways, in fact this idea allowed the identity control theory to be formed. In identity control theory, the individuals feelings arise from the reactions of the group around them. If these two ideas are looked at collectively, an individual would view themselves exactly how the group did and then their feelings would be brought out by whether their current view of self <b>matched</b> <b>their</b> previous view of self. For example, if an individual originally viewed themselves as more of a scholar than an athlete, but the group around them started to view them as an athlete more than an individual their view of themselves would turn to more of an athlete according to looking glass self. But, following identity control theory this individuals <b>input</b> would not <b>match</b> <b>their</b> output which would have the potential to induce negative feelings. This can also be seen in the reverse because if the principle of looking glass self caused the output of an individual to <b>match</b> <b>their</b> <b>input,</b> positive emotions would be brought out. With that being said, the idea of looking glass self has the ability to manipulate the emotional responses of individuals in regards to identity control theory.|$|R

Nevertheless, due to high attenuation at this frequency,the design of a reliable and energy-effective communications for BANs requires a detailedanalysis of the body channel. A planar and compact SIW horn antenna was designed and usedfor body channel measurements at 60 GHz. The main contribution in the antenna design is thebandwidth enhancement covering the whole available band around 60 GHz compared to thesame antenna type available at this frequency. The on-body measurements with this antennashow that short-distance and LOS (Line Of Sight) links are possible at 60 GHz. The bodydynamic is taken into account by statistical off-body channel measurements. For the firsttime, measurements are done for the same scenarios at 60 GHz and another frequency in theUltra WideBand suitable with OOK impulse radio modulation. By taking into accounttransmission power standards and low power consumption receivers sensitivity in theliterature, the potentiality of 60 GHz for BAN is shown with an outage probability lower than 8 % whereas this parameter is lower than 15 % at 4 GHz. When characterizing antenna onbody, difficulties arise for antenna de-embedding due to the antenna-body coupling. In fact,the antenna gain depends on transmitter-receiver distance on body.

50|$|Many {{electronic}} circuits, especially amplifiers, incorporate negative feedback. This reduces their gain, but improves <b>their</b> linearity, <b>input</b> <b>impedance,</b> output impedance, and bandwidth, and stabilises all {{of these}} parameters, including the closed-loop gain. These parameters also become less dependent {{on the details of}} the amplifying device itself, and more dependent on the feedback components, which are less likely to vary with manufacturing tolerance, age and temperature. The difference between positive and negative feedback for AC signals is one of phase: if the signal is fed back out of phase, the feedback is negative and if it is in phase the feedback is positive. One problem for amplifier designers who use negative feedback {{is that some of the}} components of the circuit will introduce phase shift in the feedback path. If there is a frequency (usually a high frequency) where the phase shift reaches 180°, then the designer must ensure that the amplifier gain at that frequency is very low (usually by low-pass filtering). If the loop gain (the product of the amplifier gain and the extent of the positive feedback) at any frequency is greater than one, then the amplifier will oscillate at that frequency (Barkhausen stability criterion). Such oscillations are sometimes called parasitic oscillations. An amplifier that is stable in one set of conditions can break into parasitic oscillation in another. This may be due to changes in temperature, supply voltage, adjustment of front-panel controls, or even the proximity of a person or other conductive item.|$|R

The generalized theory is presented using a model amplifier consisting of an input stage containing the field effect transistor, followed by two transistor stages. All the necessary criteria are derived from this model. An experimental amplifier was built and tested in the laboratory to check {{the validity of the}} theoretical analysis. The <b>input</b> <b>impedance</b> of this amplifier rneasured 20. 7 MΩ of resistance shunted by 1. 7 pf. of capacitance; the band-width extended from about 30 cps to about 10 Mc...|$|R
2500|$|Finite <b>input</b> <b>impedances</b> : The {{differential}} <b>input</b> <b>impedance</b> of {{the operational}} amplifier {{is defined as}} the impedance between its two inputs; the common-mode <b>input</b> <b>impedance</b> is the <b>impedance</b> from each <b>input</b> to ground. [...] MOSFET-input operational amplifiers often have protection circuits that effectively short circuit any input differences greater than a small threshold, so the <b>input</b> <b>impedance</b> can appear to be very low in some tests. However, as long as these operational amplifiers are used in a typical high-gain negative feedback application, these protection circuits will be inactive. [...] The input bias and leakage currents described below are a more important design parameter for typical operational amplifier applications.|$|R
