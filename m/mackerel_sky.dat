60|$|The {{walk home}} was very solemn and strange. Once, through a broken gorge, {{we had a}} glimpse of a little space of <b>mackerel</b> <b>sky,</b> moon-litten, {{on the other side of}} the hill; the broken ridges {{standing}} grey and spectral between; and the hilltop over all, snow-white, and strangely magnified in size.|$|E
60|$|There was a {{very fine}} sunset on the night Paul and Miss Trevor first met, and she had lingered on the {{headland}} beyond Noel's Cove to delight in it. The west was splendid in daffodil and rose; away to the north there was a <b>mackerel</b> <b>sky</b> of little fiery golden clouds; and across the water straight from Miss Trevor's feet ran a sparkling path of light to the sun, whose rim had just touched the throbbing edge of the purple sea. Off to the left were softly swelling violet hills and beyond the sandshore, where little waves were crisping and silvering, there was a harbour where scores of slender masts were nodding against the gracious horizon.|$|E
6000|$|I {{have now}} three {{bedrooms}} arranged {{as my own}} particular dens. One of [...] the other two was also a choice of Uncle Roger's. It {{is at the top}} [...] of one of the towers to the extreme east, and from it I can catch the [...] first ray of light over the mountains. I slept in it last night, and [...] when I woke, as in my travelling I was accustomed to do, at dawn, I [...] saw from my bed through an open window--a small window, for it is in [...] a fortress tower--the whole great expanse to the east. Not far off, [...] and springing from the summit of a great ruin, where long ago a seed [...] had fallen, rose a great silver-birch, and the half-transparent, [...] drooping branches and hanging clusters of leaf broke the outline of [...] the grey hills beyond, for the hills were, for a wonder, grey instead [...] of blue. There was a <b>mackerel</b> <b>sky,</b> with the clouds dropping on the [...] mountain-tops till you could hardly say which was which. It was a [...] <b>mackerel</b> <b>sky</b> of a very bold and extraordinary kind--not a dish of [...] mackerel, but a world of mackerel! The mountains are certainly most [...] lovely. In this clear air they usually seem close at hand. It was [...] only this morning, with the faint glimpse of the dawn whilst the [...] night clouds were still unpierced by the sunlight, that I seemed to [...] realize their greatness. I have seen the same enlightening effect of [...] aerial perspective a few times before--in Colorado, in Upper India, [...] in Thibet, and in the uplands amongst the Andes.|$|E

50|$|The {{songs on}} <b>Mackerel</b> <b>Skies,</b> {{released}} in 2008, are Nova Scotia heritage songs. Folklorist Helen Creighton collected these songs, decades ago, from {{people living in}} Nova Scotia’s harsh and rugged coastal fishing communities. The songs were brought over the Atlantic Ocean {{hundreds of years ago}} by immigrants. They were passed down from generation to generation orally, and took on a style unique to the Canadian Maritimes. Isolation, adventure, and hardship shaped the songs and altered the lyrics, and often only fragments of the songs were left to collect.|$|R
5000|$|John Roche (February 6, 1893 [...] - [...] November 10, 1952) was an American actor of {{the stage}} and screen. Born in the small village of Penn Yan, New York on February 6, 1893. He {{graduated}} from the University of Rochester, after which Roche began his acting career touring with stock companies during the 1910s and early 1920s. In 1922 he would break into the film industry with a featured role in The Good Provider. During the 1920s, he acted in both films and the legitimate stage, including several roles in Broadway productions. He acted steadily in films through 1936, in both featured and supporting roles. In the mid-1930s he took a break from films, focusing on the legitimate stage, including a directorial stint of the play, <b>Mackerel</b> <b>Skies,</b> which had a short run at the Playhouse Theatre in 1936. Roche returned to films in 1941, with a small role in the Norma Shearer vehicle, We Were Dancing (1942), based on the Noël Coward play of the same name. Over {{the course of his}} career he was involved in over half a dozen Broadway productions and appeared in over 50 films. His final screen appearance was in 1946's The Brute Man. Roche died on November 10, 1952 in Los Angeles, California.|$|R
60|$|One evening Anne and Gilbert finally {{walked down}} to the Four Winds light. The day had begun sombrely in gray cloud and mist, but it had ended in a pomp of scarlet and gold. Over the western hills beyond the harbor were amber deeps and {{crystalline}} shallows, with the fire of sunset below. The north was a <b>mackerel</b> <b>sky</b> of little, fiery golden clouds. The red light flamed on the white sails of a vessel gliding down the channel, bound to a southern port in a land of palms. Beyond her, it smote upon and incarnadined the shining, white, grassless faces of the sand dunes. To the right, it fell on the old house among the willows up the brook, and gave it for a fleeting space casements more splendid than those of an old cathedral. They glowed out of its quiet and grayness like the throbbing, blood-red thoughts of a vivid soul imprisoned in a dull husk of environment.|$|E

6000|$|Thirdly, Multitude: The {{delicacy}} of these vapors is sometimes carried into such an infinity of division, {{that no other}} sensation of number that the earth or heaven can give is so impressive. Number is always most felt when it is symmetrical, (vide Burke on [...] "Sublime," [...] Part ii. sect. 8,) and, therefore, no sea-waves nor fresh leaves make their number so evident or so impressive as these vapors. Nor is nature content with an infinity of bars or lines alone--each bar is in its turn severed {{into a number of}} small undulatory masses, more or less connected according to the violence of the wind. When this division is merely effected by undulation, the cloud exactly resembles sea-sand ribbed by the tide; but when the division amounts to real separation we have the mottled or <b>mackerel</b> <b>skies.</b> Commonly, the greater the division of its bars, the broader and more shapeless is the rank or field, so that in the mottled sky it is lost altogether, and we have large irregular fields of equal size, masses like flocks of sheep; such clouds are three or four thousand feet below the legitimate cirrus. I have seen them cast a shadow on the Mont Blanc at sunset, so that they must descend nearly to within fifteen thousand feet of the earth.|$|R

50|$|By extension, {{the term}} is applied also to other species such as the {{mackerel}} tabby cat, and to inanimate objects such as the altocumulus <b>mackerel</b> <b>sky</b> cloud formation.|$|E

50|$|A <b>mackerel</b> <b>sky</b> is {{a common}} term for a sky with rows of {{cirrocumulus}} or altocumulus clouds displaying an undulating, rippling pattern similar in appearance to fish scales; this is caused by high altitude atmospheric waves.|$|E
50|$|These new works, {{alongside}} the 1917 pieces {{and some other}} works such as <b>Mackerel</b> <b>Sky,</b> were exhibited in Nash's solo exhibition entitled The Void of War at the Leicester Galleries in May 1918. This exhibition was critically acclaimed with most commentators focusing on how Nash had portrayed nature, {{in the form of}} devastated woods, fields and hillsides, as the innocent victim of the war.|$|E
5000|$|Writing as Isabel Beaumont, {{she won the}} 250-guinea Melrose Prize for her 1922 novel Smokeless Burning. [...] She {{followed}} this with Secret Drama (1922). Writing as Eleanor Reid, she published The Fortunate Woman (1922), Marrying Madeline (1922), The Fallen (1923), Through the Curtains (1925), The Barrington Scandal (1925), <b>Mackerel</b> <b>Sky</b> (1926), The Tenth of March (1929), Last Will and Testament (1930), and A Wife and Child (1932).|$|E
5000|$|The film uses 35 {{pieces of}} music, {{many of them}} in their entirety. Critic David Thomson in his April 2007 review of the film in the British Film Institute's Sight & Sound {{magazine}} draws attention to the music that was used in the film, in particular [...] "at {{the end of the film}} ... that <b>mackerel</b> <b>sky</b> and Sir Arthur Sullivan's 'The Long Day Closes' itself" [...] sung by Pro Cantione Antiqua.|$|E
50|$|Towering {{altocumulus}}, {{known as}} altocumulus castellanus, frequently signals {{the development of}} thunderstorms later in the day, as it shows instability and convection in the middle levels of the troposphere, the area where towering cumulus clouds can turn into cumulonimbus. It is therefore one of three warning clouds often recorded by the aviation industry, the other two being towering cumulus and cumulonimbus. Altocumulus generally forms about 2,000 to 6,100 m above ground level, a similar level to altostratus formations, and satellite photography has revealed that {{the two types of}} cloud can create formations that can stretch for thousands of square miles. Extensive altocumulus formations, particularly if they take the form of undulatus are often referred to as altocumulus <b>mackerel</b> <b>sky.</b>|$|E
50|$|Atmospheric {{internal}} waves can be visualized by wave clouds: at {{the wave}} crests air rises and cools {{in the relatively}} lower pressure, which can result in water vapor condensation if the relative humidity is close to 100%. Clouds that reveal internal waves launched by flow over hills are called lenticular clouds because of their lens-like appearance. Less dramatically, a train of internal waves can be visualized by rippled cloud patterns described as herringbone sky or <b>mackerel</b> <b>sky.</b> The outflow of cold air from a thunderstorm can launch large amplitude internal solitary waves at an atmospheric inversion. In northern Australia, these result in Morning Glory clouds, used by some daredevils to glide along like a surfer riding an ocean wave. Satellites over Australia and elsewhere reveal these waves can span many hundreds of kilometers.|$|E
5000|$|Cirrocumulus appears almost {{exclusively}} with cirrus some {{way ahead of}} a warm front and is a reliable forecaster that the weather is about to change. When these high clouds progressively invade {{the sky and the}} barometric pressure begins to fall, precipitation associated with the disturbance is likely about 6 to 12 hours away. A thickening and lowering of cirrocumulus into middle-étage altostratus or altocumulus is a good sign the warm front or low has moved closer and it may start raining within less than six hours. The old rhymes [...] "Mackerel sky, not twenty-four hours dry" [...] and [...] "Mares' tails and mackerel scales make lofty ships to carry low sails" [...] both refer to this long-recognized phenomenon. Other phrases in weather lore take mackerel skies as a sign of changeable weather. Examples include [...] "Mackerel sky, <b>mackerel</b> <b>sky.</b> Never long wet and never long dry", and [...] "A dappled sky, like a painted woman, soon changes its face".|$|E
50|$|Raine has {{appeared}} {{in a variety of}} repertory theatre, TV drama and film productions. Her theatre works includes Hedda Gabler (as Juliana Tesman), 2005, at The Duke of York's Theatre, Richard Eyre’s production of La Grande Magia for the National Theatre, Mike Bradwell’s <b>Mackerel</b> <b>Sky</b> at the Bush Theatre and Bill Bryden’s production of A Month in the Country at the Yvonne Arnaud Theatre and in the West End at the Albery Theatre. Film work includes Darling and A Night to Remember and on television Kiss Me Kate, Suddenly Last Summer, Vanity Fair, A Very Peculiar Practice and Under the Hammer. She met Rossiter when they were both appearing in the play Semi-Detached in 1962 at the Belgrade Theatre, Coventry. At this time Leonard was married to Josephine Tewson. During the play's second run at the Belgrade, in September 1963, Leonard and Gillian fell in love and started to live together, although they did not to marry until 1972. She played the part of Phyllis Bennett in the 1987 TV Series, The Charmer starring Nigel Havers.|$|E
