5|$|The Montreal team in Canada {{depended}} on the Americans for supplies of heavy water from the US heavy water plant in Trail, British Columbia, (which was under American contract), as well as technical information about plutonium. The Americans {{said that they would}} give heavy water to the Montreal group only if it agreed to direct its research along the limited lines suggested by du Pont. Despite doing <b>much</b> <b>good</b> work, by June 1943 work at the Montreal Lab had come to a complete standstill. Morale was low and the Canadian Government proposed cancelling the project. In April 1944, a Combined Policy Committee meeting in Washington agreed that Canada would build a heavy water reactor. John Cockcroft became the director. The Americans supported the project with information and visits. They also supplied material, for example, uranium and heavy water. The Chalk River Laboratories opened in 1944, and in 1946 the Montreal Laboratory was closed. The project developed the ZEEP reactor, which went critical in September 1945.|$|E
25|$|The {{retention}} of original material (carving, woodwork, etc.) {{tended to be}} of little importance to the early restorers: appearance was all, and <b>much</b> <b>good</b> old work was discarded {{to be replaced by}} modern replacement in the chosen style. Different architects had different degrees of sympathy with original material, and as the century progressed greater care was generally taken; this was at least {{partly as a result of}} the increasingly louder voices that were raised in opposition.|$|E
25|$|Predictions {{that the}} batting would prove {{superior}} to the bowling and that the first Test might well be left unfinished were certainly justified; and yet there were three times when {{one side or the}} other might have gained a winning advantage... there was some very brilliant batting, some splendid bowling, and <b>much</b> <b>good</b> fielding and throwing. On the other hand there was rather too much indifferent batting, a surfeit of defensive bowling and tactics, and some deplorable fielding in which the simplest of chances were missed.|$|E

25|$|The {{conversion}} to single-man operation meant {{that about half}} of the company's workforce was suddenly surplus. Many employees found it hard to get work and were often forced to take strange shifts. One worker recorded having a 17-hour shift from 4:24p.m. on Sunday to 9:49a.m. on Monday. There was a company union, although it hadn't done <b>much</b> <b>good.</b> By October 1933, the workers had gained backing from Minnesota Governor Floyd B. Olson, St. Paul Mayor William Mahoney and the National Recovery Administration, among others. The next year, the workers voted to join the Amalgamated Transit Union.|$|E
25|$|Effective altruists {{argue that}} {{counterfactual}} reasoning {{is important to}} determine which course of action maximizes positive impact. Many people assume {{that the best way}} to help people is through direct methods, such as working for a charity or providing social services, but since charities and social-service providers usually can find people willing to work for them, effective altruists compare the amount of good somebody does in a conventional altruistic career to how <b>much</b> <b>good</b> would have been done had the next-best candidate been hired for the position. According to this reasoning, the impact of a career may be smaller than it appears.|$|E
25|$|Miley is {{especially}} close with her father, from whom she receives <b>much</b> <b>good</b> advice and emotional support. She also values her relationships with her best friends Lilly and Oliver. However Miley {{is shown to}} be very uncomfortable {{with the fact that}} they're dating and even stops them from being a couple. Her relationship with Lilly occasionally suffers the occasional setback, but they always make up. In the episode 'What I Don't Like About You', Miley is asked to choose a side between a fight Lilly and Oliver had. But Miley, showing what a kind friend she was, made a mini-Indiana Joannie movie, which made Lilly and Oliver forgive each other. Miley's relationship with her brother Jackson is often hostile. The two siblings constantly fight and trash talk each other. However, in a few private conversations, both Miley and Jackson say that they love and appreciate each other, but they are both unwilling to admit this in public.|$|E

25|$|As every individual, therefore, {{endeavours}} {{as much as}} he {{can both}} to employ his capital in the support of domestic industry, and so to direct that industry that its produce may be of the greatest value; every individual necessarily labours to render the annual revenue of the society as great as he can. He generally, indeed, neither intends to promote the public interest, nor knows how much he is promoting it. By preferring the support of domestic to that of foreign industry, he intends only his own security; and by directing that industry in such a manner as its produce may be of the greatest value, he intends only his own gain, and he is in this, as in many other cases, led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention. Nor is it always the worse for the society that it was no part of it. By pursuing his own interest he frequently promotes that of the society more effectually than when he really intends to promote it. I have never known <b>much</b> <b>good</b> done by those who affected to trade for the public good. It is an affectation, indeed, not very common among merchants, and very few words need be employed in dissuading them from it.|$|E
25|$|In 1922, the {{regiment}} was grouped with five other Baluch battalions: 1st & 2nd Battalions of 124th Duchess of Connaught's Own Baluchistan Infantry, 127th Queen Mary's Own Baluch Light Infantry, 129th Duke of Connaught's Own Baluchis and the 130th King George's Own Baluchis (Jacob's Rifles), {{to form the}} 10th Baluch Regiment. The 126th Baluchistan Infantry was redesignated as the 2nd Battalion of the new regiment. During the Second World War, 2/10th Baluch fought with great gallantry in the Malayan Campaign. The battalion was taken prisoner by the Japanese on Singapore Island after the surrender of British forces on 15 February 1942. It suffered a total of 1596 casualties in the war and during the Japanese captivity. The battalion earned <b>much</b> <b>good</b> name for resisting intense enemy pressure to join the Japanese-sponsored Indian National Army. Prominent among them was Lieutenant Abrar Hussain, who was awarded the MBE for his heroic conduct whilst a Prisoner of War. On its return from captivity, the battalion was reformed in 1946. On the independence of Pakistan in 1947, the Baluch Regiment was allocated to Pakistan Army. In 1956, on the merger of 8th Punjab and Bahawalpur Regiments with the Baluch Regiment, 2 Baluch was redesignated as 7 Baluch (now 7 Baloch). During the Indo-Pakistan War of 1965, the battalion fought with distinction in the Kasur Sector.|$|E

500|$|Labour {{suffered}} a historic {{defeat in the}} local elections and European elections, finishing third place behind the Conservatives and the United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP). Voter apathy {{was evident in the}} historically low turnout of around 33%. In Scotland, voter turnout was only 28%. In the local elections, Labour finished third place behind the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats; Labour lost control of the four councils it had held prior to the election. The vote was widely considered to be a reaction to the expenses scandal; the share of the votes for all the major parties fell; Labour was down 1%, the Conservative share was down 5%. The minor parties, including the Green party and UKIP, were considered to have benefited from the public backlash against the major parties. Brown said that the results were [...] "a painful defeat for Labour", and that [...] "too many good people doing so <b>much</b> <b>good</b> for their communities and their constituencies have lost through no fault of their own".|$|E

500|$|Early on, Young {{established}} himself {{as one of the}} harder-throwing pitchers in the game. Bill James wrote that Zimmer often put a piece of beefsteak inside his baseball glove to protect his catching hand from Young's fastball. In the absence of radar guns, however, it is impossible to say just how hard Young actually threw. Young continued to perform at a high level during the 1890 season. On {{the last day of the}} season, Young won both games of a doubleheader. In the first weeks of Young's career, Cap Anson, the player-manager of the Chicago Colts spotted Young's ability. Anson told Spiders' manager Gus Schmelz, [...] "He's too green to do your club <b>much</b> <b>good,</b> but I believe if I taught him what I know, I might make a pitcher out of him in a couple of years.

500|$|Kneale {{never saw}} himself as a science-fiction writer, and was often {{critical}} of the genre. He particularly disliked the BBC series Doctor Who (1963–89; 1996; 2005–present), {{for which he had}} once turned down an offer to write. [...] "It sounded a terrible idea and I still think it was," [...] he commented in 1986. [...] "The fact that it's lasted a long time and has a steady audience doesn't mean much. So has Crossroads and that's a stinker". He also slammed Blake's 7, which he described as the lowest point of British television science-fiction: [...] "I think the low point for me would be the very few bits I've seen of a thing called Blake's 7 which I found paralytically awful. The dialogue/characterisation seemed to consist of a kind of childish squabbling" [...] and Doomwatch: [...] "I was approached to write Doomwatch. That didn't seem to be <b>much</b> <b>good</b> either." [...] Doctor Who was heavily influenced by Kneale's Quatermass serials, in some cases even using specific storylines that were very similar to those from Quatermass.|$|E
