40|$|Molybdenum {{aluminum}} boride (MoAlB) is a ternary {{transition metal}} boride which has promising aeronautic and nuclear applications. It inheres excellent {{properties of the}} binary transitional metal borides (e. g., MoB, ZrB 2) such as high melting temperature, high hardness, and thermal conductivity. Besides, MoAlB is superior to MoB because: (1) the Al element provides an oxidation resistance at high temperatures; (2) its nanolaminated structure consisting of M-B layers with alternating Al layers results in a unique damage tolerance property. In this research, polycrystalline MoAlB have been successfully synthesized and simultaneously sintered using spark plasma sintering (SPS) from <b>molybdenum</b> <b>boride</b> (MoB) and aluminum (Al) powders. The SPS conditions have been optimized to obtain bulk samples with a high purity (3 ̆e 98 vol. ...|$|E
40|$|Molybdenum {{silicides}} and borosilicides {{are promising}} structural materials for gas-turbine power plants. A major challenge, however, is to simultaneously achieve high oxidation resistance and acceptable mechanical properties at high temperatures. For example, molybdenum disilicide (MoSi 2) has excellent oxidation resistance and poor mechanical properties, while Mo-rich silicides such as Mo 5 Si 3 (called T 1) have much better mechanical properties but poor oxidation resistance. One approach {{is based on}} the fabrication of MoSi 2 −T 1 composites that combine high oxidation resistance of MoSi 2 and good mechanical properties of T 1. Another approach involves the addition of boron to Mo-rich silicides for improving their oxidation resistance through the formation of a borosilicate surface layer. In particular, Mo 5 SiB 2 (called T 2) phase is considered as an attractive material. In the thesis, MoSi 2 −T 1 composites and materials based on T 2 phase are obtained by mechanically activated SHS. Use of SHS compaction (quasi-isostatic pressing) significantly improves oxidation resistance of the obtained MoSi 2 −T 1 composites. Combustion of Mo−Si−B mixtures for the formation of T 2 phase becomes possible if the composition is designed for the addition of more exothermic reactions leading to the formation of <b>molybdenum</b> <b>boride.</b> These mixtures exhibit spin combustion, the characteristics of which are in good agreement with the spin combustion theory. Oxidation resistance of the obtained Mo−Si−B materials is independent on the concentration of Mo phase in the products so that the materials with a higher Mo content are preferable because of better mechanical properties. Also, T 2 phase has been obtained by the chemical oven combustion synthesis technique. ...|$|E
40|$|Multilayered {{thin film}} {{structures}} are widely applied as reflective coatings for optical {{elements in the}} extreme ultraviolet wavelength regime. In this thesis we investigate the structural and chemical changes that occur in Mo/Si based multilayers {{as a result of}} radiation induced thermal loads and other heating schemes. This thesis addresses thermally induced diffusion in such multilayers, focussing on reaction mechanisms at the interfaces and how these are modified {{in the presence of a}} diffusion barrier layer. To allow these studies, a new, in-situ X-ray diffraction method is introduced to analyse diffusion induced interface growth and measure diffusion speeds in Mo/Si multilayers during thermal annealing. This method can determine the change in the interface thickness at picometer accuracy. Because of this high accuracy it is possible to study diffusion at relatively low temperatures. A diffusion-reaction model was developed to describe the interface growth. The diffusion in multilayers is shown to be dependent on the structure of all the layers as well as on the chemical interactions with barrier layer materials. In particular, the crystallinity of the Mo layer (crystalline or quasi-amorphous) has a large influence on the diffusion speed. The structure and density of the B 4 C diffusion barrier layers have a large influence on the diffusion coefficient. Furthermore it is shown that B 4 C also forms <b>molybdenum</b> <b>boride</b> compounds during annealing, which reduce the diffusion rate. In conclusion, the diffusion properties of thin film multilayer structures are determined by both the structure and the chemical interactions of the individual (barrier-) layers. The damage mechanisms of these layered structures by intense femtosecond pulses are also investigated, to find a possible difference in damage mechanism between continuous heat loads and ultrafast pulsed heat loads. This investigation was performed on MoN/SiN multilayers. We find that the damage mechanisms for annealing and pulsed irradiation are fundamentally the same. In both cases, the MoN layer dissociates and N 2 gas is released, which subsequently forms bubbles in the MoN layer which may lead to delamination...|$|E
40|$|The {{friction}} and wear properties of several refractory compound coatings were examined. These compounds {{were applied to}} 440 C bearing steel surfaces by radiofrequency (RF) sputtering. The refractory compounds were the titanium and <b>molybdenum</b> <b>borides,</b> the titanium and molybdenum silicides, and the titanium, molybdenum, and boron carbides. Friction testing was done with a pin-on-disk wear apparatus at loads from 0. 1 to 5. 0 newtons. Generally, the best wear properties were obtained when the coatings were bias sputtered onto 440 C disks that had been preoxidized. Adherence was improved because of the better bonding of the coatings to the iron oxide formed during preoxidation. As a class the carbides provided wear protection to the highest loads. Titanium boride coatings provided low {{friction and}} good wear properties to moderate loads...|$|R
40|$|Refractory metal borides have {{recently}} generated intense interest in materials chemistry. These compounds {{have been shown}} to possess many advantageous properties, such as exceptionally high hardness, electrical conductivity, and even superconductivity. Higher <b>molybdenum</b> <b>borides</b> are discussed as compounds of interest in this category of materials. However, the complex phase relationships in the molybdenum-boron system complicate the preparation of phase-pure samples. MoB 2 and Mo 2 B 4 have both been successfully arc melted previously, while Mo 1 -xB 3 has been arc synthesized herein for the first time. Additionally, experimentation with ternary solid solutions including niobium and vanadium in the Mo-B system showed formation of MoB 2, Mo 2 B 4, and Mo 1 -xB 3 at different metal-boron ratios than observed in binary systems. Solubility limits of niobium and vanadium have been determined experimentally. This work enables future exploration of the physical properties of molybdenum borides; advancement towards the rational design of superhard materials; and finally the refinement of the Mo 1 -xB 3 structure...|$|R
30|$|It {{was shown}} that the {{corrosion}} resistance in standard nickeling electrolytes for nanopowders of silicon carbide, {{as well as for}} zirconium, titanium, vanadium, chromium, <b>molybdenum,</b> and tungsten <b>borides</b> and carbides, depends on the acidity of the electrolyte, the temperature, and the treatment duration.|$|R
