Both patients had classical features of thrombotic microangiopathy with <b>microangiopathic</b> <b>haemolytic</b> <b>anaemia,</b> thrombocytopenia and renal failure commencing in the first 48 hours after envenomation.

40|$|Atypical {{haemolytic}} uraemic syndrome (aHUS) is a {{rare disease}} characterized by <b>haemolytic</b> <b>microangiopathic</b> <b>anaemia,</b> thrombocytopaenia and acute onset of renal failure, {{in the absence of}} Escherichia coli infection.

40|$|Methods: Serum cardiac {{troponin}} I {{concentrations were}} measured in 11 healthy dogs, 27 dogs with primary <b>haemolytic</b> <b>anaemia</b> and 49 hospitalised dogs without primary cardiac or haematological disorders. Results: Dogs with primary <b>haemolytic</b> <b>anaemia</b> have higher serum concentrations of cardiac troponin I than hospitalised ill dogs (P < 0. 005) and healthy dogs (P < 0. 01). Using a cut-off {{of less than}} 0. 1 ng/mL, 20 of 27 dogs with primary <b>haemolytic</b> <b>anaemia</b> had increased serum cardiac troponin I concentrations, which was a significantly higher proportion compared to the hospitalised ill dogs (P < 0. 001, 16 out of 49 dogs) and healthy dogs (P < 0. 05, 3 out of 11 dogs). Clinical Significance: Dogs with primary <b>haemolytic</b> <b>anaemia</b> have {{a higher incidence of}} subclinical myocyte damage than healthy dogs or dogs with non-haematological or primary cardiac illnesses.

40|$|BACKGROUND <b>Haemolytic</b> <b>anaemia’s</b> are characterised by {{increased}} RBC destruction {{and evidence of}} accelerated erythropoiesis. Haemolysis due to intrinsic RBC disorders, i. e. the inherited <b>haemolytic</b> <b>anaemias</b> are more common. Most of these anaemias are easily recognisable under the light microscope. MATERIALS AND METHODS To study the clinical and morphological profile {{of different types of}} <b>haemolytic</b> <b>anaemia</b> due to RBC defects in patients admitted in a tertiary care hospital of North Kerala, India. RESULTS A cross-sectional study was carried out among 217 patients of <b>haemolytic</b> <b>anaemia</b> admitted in a tertiary care hospital over a period of five years from January 2012 to December 2016.
