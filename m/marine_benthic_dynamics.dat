We evaluate the spatial structure of vulnerable <b>marine</b> <b>benthic</b> invertebrate populations based on connectivity to improve the placement of marine protected areas. LocationGulf of Lions, NW Mediterranean Sea. MethodsWe used a spatially explicit metapopulation model to explore how larval dispersal affects <b>marine</b> <b>benthic</b> invertebrate <b>dynamics</b> at local and regional scales. Minimum recruitment success (the proportion of larvae that settle in a site and survive between spawning and first reproduction, which is required to ensure species persistence) is proposed {{as a measure of}} vulnerability. Three contrasting simulations were constructed: closed versus connected populations, habitat loss versus recruitment failure disturbances and varying patterns of oceanographic connectivity. The rescue factor (the ratio of minimum recruitment success in connected and closed populations) quantified the decrease in vulnerability because of oceanographic connectivity. ResultsIn the Gulf of Lions, connectivity reduced population vulnerability by a rescue factor of 5. 3. The minimum recruitment success for regional persistence decreased from 3 % to 0. 2 % when species' life expectancies increased from 2 to 50 years. Connectivity enabled the spread of individuals over the entire region, but there were higher densities in sink sites, where low retention rates do not allow for local persistence (western tip of the gulf). Source sites, defined as those sites bringing metapopulation resistance to recruitment failure and stresses from habitat loss, were located in the centre of the gulf. Main conclusionsConnectivity drives the spatial structure of population density distribution and population vulnerability {{in the absence of any}} other structuring factor. In the Gulf of Lions, marine protected areas are located in population sinks; however; if protection measures were taken in the central part, populations would benefit throughout the region via the rescue effect...|$|R

40|$|The sediments from Chinese {{coastal waters}} contain {{relatively}} {{high concentrations of}} arsenic (As), mainly arsenate As(V), which may be transferred along the <b>marine</b> <b>benthic</b> food chain. The prey-specific determination of As bioaccumulation and transformation in <b>marine</b> <b>benthic</b> fish remains little known. In this study, we focused on a typical <b>marine</b> <b>benthic</b> food chain comprising of sediments, deposit-feeding invertebrates (polychaete Nereis succinea and clam Gafrarium tumidum) and goby fish Mugilogobius chulae. Graded exposed experiments using different As exposure durations and concentrations were conducted to examine their transformation rate and efficiency. Radiotracer techniques {{were used to determine}} the rates of As uptake (as arsenate) from seawater, assimilation from two prey and its subsequent efflux in the goby fish. We demonstrated that the two prey (polychates and clams) displayed different As biotransformation in the goby fish. Biotransformation rate was higher in the goby fish fed on the clams than on the polychaetes, and biotransformation efficiency was lower with increasing inorganic As concentration in the prey. The As overall bioaccumulation in the goby fish was very low, mainly because of the low dissolved uptake and dietary assimilation and high efflux. Combining the biotransformation and biokinetics measurements, our findings highlighted that different prey containing different As concentrations and As species resulted in the comparable As bioaccumulation in the goby fish.

40|$|Summary. Hamelin Pool in Western Australia {{is home to}} {{distinctive}} shallow-water <b>marine</b> <b>benthic</b> communities {{dominated by}} stromatolites-structures formed by bacterial assemblages. We have sought to establish if the principal consumers of bacteria, the flagellates, form a distinctive community. We present observations of 87 species of flagellates, of which three are new (Notosolenus hamelini, Ploeotia laminae, Ancyromonas sinistra), and 15 (12 of which are dinoflagellates) have not been previously reported in Australia. The communities have been compared with other communities from marine sediments using cluster analysis. The community of flagellates in Hamelin Pool was found not to be significantly different from communities from other <b>marine</b> <b>benthic</b> habitats, and abundances (about 1 x 105 cells/cm 3) are also comparable to those in other sediments. We find {{no evidence that the}} formation of stromatolites is made possible by a reduced predation pressure from heterotrophic flagellates...|$|R

40|$|Mapping of <b>marine</b> <b>benthic</b> flora using {{remote sensing}} {{techniques}} {{has been used}} to assess the dynamics of environmental conditions in coastal areas. Mostly studies used panchromatic/colour aerial photography and/or medium resolution multispectral satellite imagery to create time series showing the change of seagrass distribution, as indicator species of environmental conditions. While successful within their project parameters, these studies were limited by conditions at time of image capture, such as sun-glare, turbidity, wave action and low contrast in deeper waters due to absorption and scattering. The use of polarized multispectral imagery has the potential to overcome, or at least reduce these problems such that a finer detail of benthic flora may become visible. This paper explores the theoretical background in the application of polarization for mapping seagrass and other <b>marine</b> <b>benthic</b> flora.
