40|$|Recent {{disasters}} during {{major events}} {{have resulted in}} increased focus on influencing crowds, both during emergencies and under normal circumstances. In this exploratory study event experts were interviewed to uncover good practices {{regarding the use of}} technology to communicate with crowds. They agree that, rather than using <b>directive</b> <b>means</b> and <b>force,</b> crowds can best be persuaded; proving relevant information enables them to decide for themselves what course of action to take. Some of the experts remain critical about use of social media at events; effectiveness depends on target group composition, visitors’ engagement in the event, and reliability. Additionally, the abundance of information visitors have at their fingertips may reduce effectiveness of information emitted by organisers. Especially important in communicating with crowds is “communicating as one”, not only pertaining to explicit messages but also to non-verbal communication. Based on these results, implications for event safety are discussed...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, it {{is argued}} that the use of the imperatival infinitive (or, infinitivus pro imperativo) can be {{explained}} by means of the notion of procedure. The imperatival infinitive refers to the appropriate action that is to be carried out as part of a practical or conventional social procedure (script, frame) which is evoked in the discourse or by the extra-linguistic situation of the interlocutors. Unlike the imperative proper, the imperatival infinitive does not involve a direct appeal of the speaker to the hearer. As its <b>directive</b> <b>force</b> depends on the appropriateness of the action within a particular procedure, the imperatival infinitive {{can be seen as a}} more indirect type of directive expression. The functional differences between the imperative and the imperatival infinitive can be clarified by reference to the notions of finiteness and grounding. As imperatival infinitives are not finite, they do not invoke the ground (i. e. the speech event, its participants, and its immediate circumstances), but merely designate a type of action which is not epistemically located with respect to time or reality. Unlike the imperative, therefore, the <b>directive</b> <b>force</b> of the imperatival infinitive is not anchored in the ground, but, instead, it is pragmatically implicated by the procedure at hand. © 2010 Brill Academic Publishers...|$|R

In particular, in the so-called surface mount technology (SMT) used to connect semiconductor components mechanically and electrically to circuit boards, the resins have to withstand peak temperatures of 260 °C and more during the soldering process. This triggered {{the rapid growth of}} polymer resins based on polyamides with melting points above 300 °C, in particular PPAs and Nylon 46. The application requires the resin to pass GWIT and UL94 ratings mentioned above. Aluminium diethylphosphinate confers this flame retardancy on polyamides whilst meeting the other requirements such as CTI.|$|R

40|$|This article {{presents}} {{an account of}} the cross-linguistic variation in the availabil-ity of negative imperatives. By imperatives, I refer to sentences with a distinctive imperative morphology on the main verb and/or a distinctive syntax. In many lan-guages (e. g., Italian, Modern Greek, and Spanish), imperatives cannot be negated. Instead, negative commands are expressed with negative subjunctives and/or in-finitivals. However, in German, French, English, Bulgarian and Serbo-Croatian, imperatives can be negated. I argue that some languages rule out negative im-peratives because the syntax of the language derives a structure which maps onto an incoherent interpretive representation. The analysis I propose builds on the intuition that the <b>directive</b> <b>force</b> contributed by the imperative mood cannot be negated. The negative imperative Don’t call! means I require that you not call; it does not mean I do not require that you call. This judgment was already noted by Frege, consequently positing that illocutionary force operators cannot be negated. Pursuing this idea further, I propose that negative imperatives are unavailable in some languages because the syntax derives a structure in which the operator en-coding <b>directive</b> <b>force</b> arrives within the c-command domain of negation, where it is interpreted as being negated. As this is incoherent, the structure is ruled impos-sible. The proposed analysis has implications for the mapping between syntax and semantics of imperatives in particular. In general, it provides evidence that the set of available syntactic structures in a language is restricted by uniform mechanisms for semantic interpretation across languages. 1. I am grateful to Anthony Kroch for his encouragement and many valuable discussions on this topic. I have also benefited from comments at various stages from Robin Clark, Luis López...|$|R

For better understanding the differences arising from local disparities, six factors related to technical, economic, legislative and environmental aspects have been identified as crucial influences in the market share of C&D waste recycling solutions. These factors are able to identify the causes that limit the recycling rate of a certain region. Moreover, progress towards an efficient waste management can vary through the improvement of a single factor. This study provides the background for further fine-tuning the factors and their combination into a mathematical model for assessing the market share of C&D recycling solutions...|$|R

The system is able to attenuate the exhaust noise without passive attenuation prior to the active silencer. There have been developed electrical equivalent models to dimension the silencer wherein the engine acoustical characteristics, such as the acoustic impedance and source strength at the exhaust, have been included. A cold engine test rig is developed which generates realistic exhaust noise using compressed air with similar characteristics as an operational engine. The test rig permits to develop new concepts of exhaust systems economically, using low cost materials and standard measurement equipment.

This paper aims to contribute to our understanding of how an EU directive on energy use in buildings diffuses into, and is managed by, a public construction client organisation. Drawing on a framework of Rouleau and Balogun, we have examined how discursive competences were deployed by an energy expert as means to influence the organisational sensemaking of the target initially. The paper is based on an explorative case study, namely in-depth interviews with seven respondents, a focus group meeting and extensive field notes. Using a narrative approach, we account for talk, action and interaction between mainly the energy expert, the management team and officials. Thus, we unfold how the sensemaking of the target progressed over time...|$|R

It was to bring home to people some various aspects of one very startling proposition: that human society had arrived at a phase when the complete restatement of its fundamental ideas had become urgently necessary, a phase when the slow, inadequate, partial adjustments to two centuries of changing conditions had to give place to a rapid reconstruction of new fundamental ideas.

Rate of progress from selection is determined by (1) average selection differential of parents for all traits under selection, (2) heritability of traits, (3) genetic correlations between traits, and (4) interval between generations of parents. Selection differential is the difference in performance of selected sires and dams compared with the average of the unselected group from which they came. Heritability is the fraction of the observed differences between animals caused by average genetic differences. Genetic correlation is the average genetic association between traits. Interval between generations is the average age of sires and dams when offspring are born (which in our herd was 4. 4 years) ...|$|R

Rather than being a separate department, the Wardrobe and its officers now came {{under the authority of}} the Steward, and before long, even within the Household, the Wardrobe began to lose its separate identity: by the late 14th century, its senior officers were more often than not referred to as the Treasurer of the Household, Controller of the Household and Cofferer of the Household (rather than as [...] "Treasurer/Controller/Cofferer of the Household Wardrobe"). Despite this gradual demise of the Wardrobe, these three officers remained (and two of them still remain) as senior officers of the Household who are also members of the Government.
