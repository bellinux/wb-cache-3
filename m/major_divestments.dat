50|$|At {{the same}} time that the company was making <b>major</b> <b>divestments</b> in the early 1990s, American Stores also looked for {{opportunities}} to make strategic minor acquisitions that would enhance its position in the main markets where it needed to strengthen market share.|$|E
50|$|Eventually, on 26 January 1998, what {{remained}} of the company (including DEC's multivendor global services organization and customer support centers) was sold to PC manufacturer Compaq in what was the largest merger up to that time in the computer industry. Several years earlier, Compaq had considered a bid for DEC but became seriously interested only after DEC's <b>major</b> <b>divestments</b> and refocusing on the Internet in 1997. At the time of Compaq's acquisition announcement, DEC had a total of 53,500 employees, down from a peak of 130,000 in the 1980s, but it still employed about 65% more people than Compaq to produce about half the volume of sales revenues. After the merger closed, Compaq moved aggressively to reduce DEC’s high selling, general, and administrative (SG&A) costs (equal to 24% of total 1997 revenues) and bring them more in line with Compaq’s SG&A expense ratio of 12% of revenues.|$|E

During {{his tenure}} at Amec Foster Wheeler, Brikho was widely {{credited}} with a major turnaround of the company. The company's share price rose from under 400 pence when he {{assumed the role of}} CEO in October 2006, to over 1,200 pence in June 2014. At the beginning of his tenure, Brikho also secured the confidence of the board in rejecting a £1.5bn, or 450p a share, cash takeover offer from private equity groups Texas Pacific and First Reserve Corporation. In December 2007, the company was moved from its ranking within the FTSE 250 Index to the FTSE 100 Index, a promotion which was credited to Brikho's streamlining of the business, and a number of <b>major</b> <b>divestments</b> which left £600m of cash in the company, and over £1bn of capital for acquisition. He served until 18 January 2016 and was succeeded by Ian McHoul, the Chief Financial Officer, on interim basis.|$|E

5000|$|In 1998, Compaq {{acquired}} Digital Equipment Corporation for a then-industry {{record of}} $9 billion USD. The merger made Compaq, at the time, the world's second largest computer maker {{in the world}} in terms of revenue behind IBM. Digital Equipment, which had nearly twice as many employees as Compaq while generating half the revenue, had been a leading computer company during the 1970s and early 1980s. However, Digital had struggled during the 1990s, with high operating costs. For nine years the company had lost money or barely broke even, and had recently refocused itself as a [...] "network solutions company". In 1995, Compaq had considered a bid for Digital but only became seriously interested in 1997 after Digital's <b>major</b> <b>divestments</b> and refocusing on the Internet. At the time of the acquisition, services accounted for 45 percent of Digital's revenues (about $6 billion) and their gross margins on services averaged 34 percent, considerably higher than Compaq's 25% margins on PC sales and also satisfying customers who had demanded more services from Compaq for years. Compaq had originally wanted to purchase only Digital's services business but that was turned down. When the announcement was made, it was initially viewed as a master stroke as it immediately gave Compaq a 22,000 person global service operation to help corporations handle major technological purchases (by 2001 services made up over 20% of Compaq's revenues, largely due to the Digital employees inherited from the merger), in order to compete with IBM. However it was also risky merger, as the combined company would have to lay off 2,000 employees from Compaq and 15,000 from Digital which would potentially hurt morale. Furthermore, Compaq fell behind schedule in integrating Digital's operations, which also distracted the company from its strength in low-end PCs where it used to lead the market in rolling out next-generation systems which let rival Dell grab market share. Reportedly Compaq had three consulting firms working to integrate Digital alone.|$|E
40|$|This paper reports first {{results from}} a survey of 404 middle-sized and large {{manufacturing}} firms from 40 Russian regions in April-June 2003. We examine the extent of social service and infrastructure provision by the firms and the firms’ assessment {{of the quality of}} public infrastructure and the regulatory environment. Background information of ownership, investment, performance, competition, and finance decisions of the firms is also gathered. The data reveal that despite <b>major</b> <b>divestments</b> of social services during 1990 s, a great majority of firms still provide at least some form of social services. For example, 56 % of the firms have their own housing or support local housing, and 73 % of the firms have recreation facilities or support employee’s recreation activities. While managers view the social service provision as non-essential and costly, many of the firms continue to provide these services, even to users other than their own workforce. The quality of public infrastructure is generally assessed as being good or satisfactory; the respondents were the least satisfied with the quality of roads. Over a half of the firms provide their own heat, but mainly due to technological reasons – although public service interruptions do occur – and 24 % of the firms give support to the maintenance and construction of public road network. The regulatory burden the firms face continues to be severe. In {{more than half of the}} firms, for example, the general manager has to spend more than two weeks in negotiations about public infrastructure with the authorities. These descriptive results indicate that there is still a lot scope for improvement in the quality and quantity of public service provision in Russia. Enterprises are still engaged rather heavily in social service provision, road network would require improvements, and the easing of regulatory burden should continue. Addressing these questions is likely to be vital for the sustainability of investments and growth in Russia. ...|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} widely {{suggested}} that since the early 1980 s the trend towards ever greater corporate diversification has been reversed in many mature economies; with many diversified firms narrowing the scope of their activities by refocusing on what {{are perceived to be}} core businesses primarily, though not exclusively, through <b>major</b> <b>divestments.</b> Whilst recent research, largely in the US context, has started to take place on corporate refocusing there is a paucity of evidence on refocusing in the UK. The aim of this thesis is to address this shortcoming and to examine corporate refocusing activity in the UK. This study uses a specially constructed data set compiled from primary and secondary sources, covering 158 publicly quoted companies over the period 1985 to 1993. The thesis initially examines the extent and nature of refocusing activity in the UK. It is found that refocusing activity is undertaken by a substantial majority of the sample firms. Firms refocused primarily by divesting unrelated businesses and acquiring related activities. The thesis proceeds to examine the characteristics of refocusing firms using cross-sectional OLS and logit techniques. It is found that refocusing firms are characterised by high levels of diversification, low levels of management ownership and to a limited extent by an attractive core business on which to refocus. The thesis next examines the determinants of firms' divestment behaviour using both crosssectional and panel data proportions and count data (Poisson and Negative Binomial regressions) techniques. The results indicate that divestment is a purposeful response to financial, strategic, corporate governance and - to a limited extent - market structure characteristics. In the final part of the thesis, we examine the impact of divestment on firm performance by adopting a dynamic profitability equation augmented with divestment variables. The results suggest that divestment has a positive impact on the profitability of divesting firms. The performance effect is greater for firms operating weak governance mechanisms. It is concluded that corporate refocusing is an important phenomenon in the UK and is not merely an invention of the business press. The determinants of divestment indicate that divestment is not simply a reflection of managerial idiosyncrasies or mean reversion behaviour in the activities undertaken, but a purposeful response to a change in the equilibrium level of diversification. The adoption of a refocusing strategy appears to improve the overall performance of divesting firms...|$|E
5000|$|As of June 1, 2015, Roll Global {{changed its}} name to The Wonderful Company. As the current {{incarnation}} of the Resnicks' holding company, The Wonderful Company has a number of predecessors. The Resnicks first bought Teleflora in 1979; later they purchased a home alarm and security company called American Protection Industries. They made API their holding company, and their subsequent purchases (the Franklin Mint, Paramount agribusinesses) became subsidiaries of API. Even after they sold the underlying alarm business, they kept the name API for the holding company until 1993. [...] In 1993, they renamed the company Roll International (later Roll Global) and continued to cultivate a changing portfolio of subsidiaries. One <b>major</b> <b>divestment</b> was the Franklin Mint, sold to a private equity group in 2006. Acquisitions included POM Wonderful and Fiji Water.|$|R

40|$|The {{propensity}} of corporate executives and strategists to restructure their companies has intensified in recent years. Although a substantial literature, mainly overseas, has addressed the motives and economic consequences of mergers and acquisitions, comparatively {{little research has}} been directed towards corporate divestment activity, particularly in the Australasian region. This research investigates the motives for <b>divestment,</b> and some <b>major</b> factors influencing <b>divestment</b> decision-making of New Zealand listed companies. It highlights the importance of divestment as an integral aspect of corporate restructuring processes. An inter-disciplinary model of divestment has been developed and explored in this study. Three different but inter-related perspectives - industrial organisation economics; corporate strategy; and finance - capture the various dimensions of divestment activity hitherto unexplored in a single study. This study relied on mail survey questionnaire as a data collection method. The senior executives of leading companies listed on the New Zealand Stock Exchange were asked to indicate the relative importance of the divestment motives and factors affecting their companies I divestment activities for the past five financial years. Non-parametric statistical methods were employed to test the research hypotheses. The research results offer strong support for the conceptual model of divestment. This confirms the notion that selected environmental, organisational, and performance factors have significant influences on a firm I s motives for divestment, which in turn determines the corresponding divestment strategy formulation and implementation adopted by firms...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we discuss the Divestment Strategy at Getronics, a {{subsidiary}} of the Dutch telecom company KPN, with a focus on Asia Pacific (APAC). Getronics has divested a significant number of its subsidiaries over the past few years. There are various reasons for a company to divest assets: getting rid of a liability, re-directing investments towards more profitable markets, expanding through larger local partners, need for cash etc. Yet it can also be a clearly defined strategy. And at KPN/Getronics, it is. The divestment strategy must be the result of thorough thinking at corporate level, based on a robust framework which considers a well defined set of rules, the right timing and consider the interests of main stakeholders. As used by Getronics, a SWOT analysis is a powerful tool to develop and drive strategies. It {{can also be used to}} validate a strategy post decision-making. The divestment strategy at Getronics, which affected all regions of the globe, must primarily fit in the core strategy of the company which is to protect and develop its market leadership in the Benelux and to better service its large international clients through its network of subsidiaries and partners. It implies having a robust international delivery capability in place with global reach. But owning a large number of subsidiaries is not a necessity for as long as Getronics remains credible and keeps its customers satisfied. But the more Getronics relies on partners, the riskier it gets. And a major risk is to be seen as a company that only manages partners. This research also focuses on the APAC region where three <b>major</b> <b>divestments</b> took place in China/Hong Kong, Japan and Australia while two main subsidiaries (Malaysia and Singapore) were retained. The focus on a reduced number of cases allows for a deeper analysis. Divestment decisions are strategic in nature hence carry a very sensitive aspect and are made behind closed doors, at a very high management level, and therefore only communicated at a late stage of the process. To understand the divestment strategy from various angles, a qualitative analysis of data was conducted then analysed so that findings, recommendations and conclusions can be presented. Customers have also a keen interest in Getronics’ divestment strategy, especially if it impacts their own strategic locations. While acknowledging that divestments have so far been conducted successfully, they also voice their concerns over future potential risks. We conclude that the divestment strategy at Getronics has been successful so far yet it has reached its limits. Divesting more entities out of the handful of remaining subsidiaries will negatively impact Getronics branding internationally and reduced further its direct global reach. And this success is only relative as the new partnerships have yet to prove they are durable. The global service delivery model which relies heavily on partners makes a lot of sense but it is also very risky as customers may see Getronics as a company that mainly manages partners. We also conclude on the importance for the company to keep a foothold in strategic locations, as requested by some major customers, suggesting de-facto a limitation to the number of subsidiaries that shall be divested in the future...|$|E
