50|$|By 1880 safes and vaults {{had become}} and {{important}} part firms exports and {{a decision was}} made to expand that line of products. Property was bought in 1882 for a vault machine shop and a <b>moulding</b> <b>shop,</b> another lot was also acquired in 1883 for further expansion. This was also the year that the company obtained the Canadian patent to the Wheelock engine. This would become one of Goldie McCulloch's & Co.'s defining products, with at least a few engines remaining in operation more than 100 years later.|$|E
50|$|The {{business}} ceased {{trading in}} December 1979, the Winter of Discontent, and restarted in 1980. New models were introduced: 24, 27 and 22 wide beam but the <b>moulding</b> <b>shop</b> {{was destroyed in}} a fire in 1982, destroying most of the moulds and the business never recovered. Some moulds were re-built and when the business finally ceased, these were sold and marketed under other names, such as the Atlanta 24. Also some designs were copied and made into hybrids. Mr. Wheeldon once estimated that approximately 7,000 Normans were built.|$|E
5000|$|He {{followed}} in his father's footsteps and first became {{a maker of}} carriages. He later added a blacksmith shop, a wheelwright shop and a <b>moulding</b> <b>shop</b> to his business as a carriage maker. His foundry was located in Charleston {{on the street corner}} of Cumberland and State. His business soon expanded into a large enterprise throughout the state of South Carolina. Werner had an excellent reputation for quality work. It has been said that his work did not need the modest stamp [...] "Werner, fecit" [...] (Werner made it) as the grace and beauty of his work spoke for itself.|$|E

5000|$|The [...] Foundry {{comprised}} <b>moulding</b> <b>shops,</b> casting bays, fettling {{shops and}} machine shops, all suitable for castings {{up to three}} tons weight. Although larger castings were made by mixing metal from all the sources these were machined and finished outside. The remainder of the site comprised the Fabrication Shops, three bays laid out {{for the production of}} welded fabrications and heat exchangers. Following World War II a new laboratory block was added adjacent to the Sheffield Road entrance. This comprised facilities for Chemical Analysis, Physical Testing, Non-Destructive Testing, Mechanical Testing and Metallography. This facility also had its own small machine shop, for making mechanical test pieces, and a reference library / conference facility.|$|R
500|$|In 1865, George Duncan {{purchased}} the Ripley & Company glass factory at 10th and Carson Streets in the South Side neighborhood of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania from D.C. Ripley, a former business partner of Duncan. [...] The factory was located {{adjacent to the}} Monongahela River, which provided easy access to transportation. [...] A new company, George Duncan & Sons, was formed by Duncan, his sons Harry B. Duncan and James E. Duncan, and Augustus H. Heisey, who was married to George's daughter Susan. [...] In 1874, John Ernest Miller, a 20-year veteran of the glass manufacturing industry, joined the company as a designer. [...] He was previously the foreman of the <b>mould</b> <b>shop</b> at King, Son and Company. [...] The addition of Miller proved to be fortuitous, because Miller's designs over the next 52 years became internationally famous. [...] In 1877, George Duncan died and James E. Duncan {{took control of the}} company.|$|R
5000|$|In July 2015, Toowoomba Regional Council {{approved}} {{the demolition of}} the <b>moulding</b> <b>shop,</b> the core shop, Brooks Shed and post-1960 additions, and partial demolition of the cylinder head building, maintenance building and machine shop. The demolition of the mostly state heritage-listed buildings was locally controversial. Bunnings claimed that the [...] "high value state heritage places being the cylinder head building, maintenance building and the old canteen building" [...] would be retained in the new development. In May 2016, Bunnings announced that a successful tenderer for the project had been selected and that construction would begin later in 2016.|$|E
50|$|Before {{the start}} of the Second World War, the Government decided to {{disperse}} certain production to locations away from obvious bombing targets. This led to a shadow factory at Cowbridge House, Malmesbury, Wiltshire, being established by Ekco. This was followed by other shadow factories at Aylesbury, Woking, Preston, and Rutherglen. The wartime headquarters of Ekco was based at Aston Clinton House in Buckinghamshire. Following the outbreak of war, the Southend-on-Sea factory was evacuated apart from the bakelite <b>moulding</b> <b>shop</b> whose large moulding presses could not be moved easily. Less than a year later, the empty factory was re-equipped to make wiring looms for aircraft such as the Avro Lancaster.|$|E
5000|$|The company {{suffered}} a major financial setback in 1932, when a fire swept through its {{research and development}} laboratories. The blaze destroyed much of the design work for the company’s new range of receivers.Ekco launched its first car radio at the 1934 Radiolympia exhibition. Another important development for the company was the introduction of bakelite cabinets for its radios. Initially these cabinets were made for the company in Germany by AEG, however the introduction of high import duties on the cabinets in 1931 led Ekco to establish its own bakelite <b>moulding</b> <b>shop</b> adjacent to its Southend-on-Sea works. The company employed famous architects such as Serge Chermayeff and Wells Coates to design its bakelite radio cabinets.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Based on a {{background}} to the <b>mould</b> job <b>shop,</b> this paper considers a two-stage flexible flow shop scheduling problem subject to release dates, {{where the first}} stage {{is made up of}} unrelated machines and tasks have group constraint. The objective is to find a schedule that minimizes makespan in that flexible flow shop environment. For this problem, a mathematic model is formulated. Because this problem is NP-hard, an improved Palmer-based heuristic (denoted by MPL) is proposed. Based on MPL, a new heuristic (denoted by IMPL) is developed. In order to test the efficiency of the two heuristics, sets of examples are designed. Compared to the MPL, the performance of IMPL is more superior...|$|R
40|$|Summary: The role of fungi and mycotoxins {{contamination}} in pet food is not conveniently evaluated in Portugal. The authors report {{the identification of}} mycoflora and mycotoxins determi-nation in 60 samples of dry pet food; 20 for dogs, 20 for cats and 20 for domestic birds (10 for canaries and 10 for parrots) acquired in different pet <b>shops.</b> <b>Moulds</b> evaluation was determi-ned using a conventional method. The mycotoxins, aflatoxins (AFs), ochratoxin A (OTA), fumonisin B 1 (FB 1) and deoxyni-valenol (DON) were analysed by high performance liquid chro-matoghraphy (HPLC). The detection limits were: 1. 0 µg/kg for aflatoxins, 2. 0 µg/kg for ochratoxin A, 10 µg/kg for fumonisin B 1 and 100. 0 µg/kg for deoxynivalenol. All samples had very low fungi counts. The predominant genera were Aspergillus (58. 3 %), Penicillium (38. 3 %) and Mucor (38. 3 %). Aflatoxins were not detected in any sample. Ochratoxin A was detected i...|$|R
50|$|The shop front {{has a wide}} awning {{that extends}} out over the footpath. Two doors {{fronting}} Grafton Street, which are set off centre, provide access to each shop. Next to each door is a large display window. The front window on the southern shop has been replaced with a window incorporating louvres but the northern <b>shop</b> <b>moulded</b> outer timber window frame remains original but has been modified from four panes to a single pane. Above each door is another smaller window, possibly originally a hopper. A brick parapet was made prior to 1927 and the mid section of the parapet raised at the front sometime after. There are 2 steeply pitched corrugated iron gabled roofs over each shop, of uniform height. The gabled roof on the northern shop has remained the same but the southern shop has been altered to a similar pitch. There is patchy flat metal flashing against the parapet. The rear skillion and framing is old and slightly bowed.|$|R
40|$|This diploma thesis {{deals with}} a study on {{production}} process management for a selected component of the joint-stock company ZDAS. This component is cast piece. The first section is {{paying attention to the}} production process of a cast piece, starting from the offer, offer processing, proposal of manufacturing process, production of a cast piece inclusive of testing and, according to customer´s requirement, rough machining, where the last phase of order is a transport of product to customer. Another section is focusing on the productional subdivision of the <b>moulding</b> <b>shop,</b> where the <b>moulding</b> <b>shop</b> inputs and outputs, the mould making are described as well as evaluation of the plan fulfilment of castings production in the monitored periond. The closing section contains proposals that should lead to the improvement of production, conditions of their implementation and potential contributions...|$|E

30|$|After {{loading the}} furnace, melting is {{obtained}} at about 1, 450 – 1, 500  °C (depending {{of the type}} of cast iron). During this phase, slag is removed from the hot metal {{with the help of a}} slag overflow notch; tapping can be automatic or manual from the melting pot into the ladles. Then cast iron is poured: the pour can be automatic or manual from the ladles to the moulds. On the moulding side, a basic distinction is made between permanent and lost moulds. Foundries casting in permanent moulds buy these metal moulds (dies) externally, but typically operate an in-house mould repair and maintenance shop. Foundries casting in lost moulds, often buy wooden, metal or plastic patterns (for their mould design) and operate an in-house pattern maintenance and repair <b>shop.</b> <b>Moulds,</b> cores and lost models are generally produced as part of the foundry process, starting from sand, alloying elements and other additives to give to this mixture the opportune moulding, cohesion and mechanical resistance. Successively, moulds and cores are assembled together than they are ready to the previous cited casting phase.|$|R
40|$|This {{study used}} a hedonic {{approach}} {{to estimate the}} economic value of radiata pine log attributes (small-end diameter, form and internode length) for appearance grade lumber, including <b>Moulding</b> & Better, <b>Shop</b> and Industrial Finger Joint. Models were also built at the tree level to investigate the effect of selection as conducted by breeders. A Chilean sawing study provided information on wood traits and log out-turn for 156 logs divided into three classes: pruned butt log, second log and third log. The conversion return of logs, instead of log prices, {{was used as the}} measure of log economic value. The economic values of log small-end diameter were 0. 33, 0. 19 and 0. 10 US $/mm for the first, second and third log respectively. Concerning form, those values were 2. 6, 1. 4 and 0. 63 US $ for a marginal improvement of this characteristic. The value of mean internode length was 0. 19 US $/cm for second unpruned logs. Values for other internode length indices are also presented in this paper. Branch variables were not statistically significant in explaining the log recovery value. Finally, log recovery value was found to be elastic to the changes in small-end diameter and form, but inelastic to changes in the mean internode length...|$|R
