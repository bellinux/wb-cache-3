50|$|The Proctor {{compaction}} test is a laboratory method of experimentally determining the optimal moisture content {{at which a}} given soil type will become most dense and achieve its <b>maximum</b> <b>dry</b> <b>density.</b> The term Proctor is in honor of R. R. Proctor, who in 1933 showed that the dry density of a soil for a given compactive effort depends {{on the amount of}} water the soil contains during soil compaction. His original test is most commonly referred to as the standard Proctor {{compaction test}}; later on, his test was updated to create the modified Proctor compaction test.|$|E
50|$|These {{laboratory}} tests generally consist of compacting soil at known moisture content into a cylindrical mold of standard dimensions using a compactive effort of controlled magnitude. The soil is usually compacted {{into the mold}} to {{a certain amount of}} equal layers, each receiving a number of blows from a standard weighted hammer at a specified height. This process is then repeated for various moisture contents and the dry densities are determined for each. The graphical relationship of the dry density to moisture content is then plotted to establish the compaction curve. The <b>maximum</b> <b>dry</b> <b>density</b> is finally obtained from the peak point of the compaction curve and its corresponding moisture content, also known as the optimal moisture content.|$|E
30|$|Having {{prepared}} the samples, standard Proctor compaction tests (ASTM D 698 - 78 [4]) {{were carried out}} for each sample. Then, <b>maximum</b> <b>dry</b> <b>density</b> and optimum moisture content of each sample were obtained by plotting {{the relationship between the}} dry density and moisture content. With those results, the relationship between <b>maximum</b> <b>dry</b> <b>density</b> (MDD) and optimum moisture content (OMC) with flyash content was obtained. The best proportion which delivers the <b>maximum</b> <b>dry</b> <b>density</b> was selected as the optimum mix proportion.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this report {{was to assess the}} ability of several different devices to measure moisture content and <b>dry</b> <b>density</b> of various compacted geomaterials. The experimental research involved the testing of different subgrade soils and one base material. More than a dozen specimens, 2 ft in height and 1. 5 ft in diameter, were constructed to evaluate the Transtech SDG 200, Purdue TDR, and the Decagon 10 HS moisture content sensor. The Speedy Moisture Tester and DOT 600 Roadbed Water Content Meter were also evaluated using individual soil samples. All materials were tested at five different moisture contents, but at their corresponding <b>maximum</b> <b>dry</b> <b>densities.</b> ^ The Transtech SDG 200 and Purdue TDR estimate both the moisture content and <b>dry</b> <b>density.</b> Conversely, the DOT 600 Meter, Speedy Moisture Tester, and the Decagon 10 HS Sensor only estimate the moisture content.

40|$|Lightweight fill materials, {{including}} foamed aggregates {{are increasingly}} being used in civil engineering and infrastructure applications. This research assessed the engineering properties of foamed recycled glass through a laboratory evaluation to ascertain this novel recycled material as a lightweight fill material in civil engineering applications. The engineering assessment included particle size distribution, particle density, water absorption, minimum and <b>maximum</b> <b>dry</b> <b>densities</b> with a vibrating table, California Bearing Ratio (CBR) and Los Angeles (LA) abrasion tests. Shear strength properties of the recycled foamed glass were studied through large-scale direct shear tests. This recycled foamed glass is classified as a gap graded material. Due to high porosity, the coarse particles of this material have high water absorption of 60 % and low particle density of 4. 54 kN/m 3, which is much {{lower than that of}} water. The minimum and <b>maximum</b> <b>dry</b> <b>densities</b> of this material are very low of 1. 67 and 2. 84 kN/m 3, respectively. The LA abrasion of foamed recycled glass is lower than the requirement for pavement base/subbase material, being of 94 %. The shear resistance at small shear displacement is thus low as shown by low CBR value of 9 - 12 %. However, the shear resistance at large shear displacement is high as shown by high cohesion and friction angle of 23. 36 kPa and 54. 7 o, respectively. The environmental assessment included pH value, organic content, total and leachate concentration of the material for a range of contaminant constituents. All the hazardous concentrations in the leachate are far lower than 100 times of those of the drinking water standards, indicting the foamed recycled glass as a non-hazardous material. The energy savings assessment demonstrates that the use of foamed recycled glass as engineering material has much lower energy consumption relative to a conventional aggregate-cement material in construction projects. The lightweight properties of the foamed recycled glass coupled with its satisfactory engineering and environmental results, particularly its high friction angle, indicates that the material is ideal for usage as a lightweight construction material in engineering applications such as non-structural fills in embankments, retaining wall backfill and pipe bedding...|$|R
40|$|The proper {{densification}} of {{the separate}} pavement layers forms {{an integral part}} of road construction. Many problems, are, however, experienced in this area. Because of a lack of knowledge the compaction of untreated roadbuilding materials in problem situations is usually approached on a ''trial and error'' basis rather than basing possible solutions on scientific evidence of the collective influence of the material properties and site conditions. The {{purpose of the study was}} to place the compaction of untreated roadbuilding materials on a more scientific basis. An investigation was therefore launched to determine the effect of measured material properties on their compactability. A non-standard vibratory compaction test was used to compact the samples in one layer. New test parameters to quantify the shape and texture of the material were also developed, namely the shakedown bulk density and the shape factor. The CBR values of the materials at moulding moisture content were determined for each material for a range of densities and moisture contents. The <b>maximum</b> <b>dry</b> <b>densities</b> (MOD) (vibratory and mod. AASHTO) and optimum moisture content (OMC) (vibratory and mod. AASHTO) were also determined. The measured values were then evaluated in terms of the following physical properties of the materials: grading, Atterberg limits, linear shrinkage, shakedown bulk density (SBD), loose bulk density (LBO), shape factor (SF) and specific rugosity (Srv). In the extensive laboratory study of 21 different untreated roadbuilding materials, varying from TAB classes A- 7 - 6 to A- 1, it was found that both the <b>maximum</b> <b>dry</b> <b>densities</b> and moisture regimes can be quantified in terms of the grading, liquid limit and linear shnnkage of the materials. These relations were modelled by means of regression analysis. Besides this a general bearing capacity model was found for all these materials where the CBR is a function of the <b>dry</b> <b>density</b> and moisture content of the material. This model was further refined to take account of the influence of shape and texture of the particles so that it is possible to determine reasonable estimates of the bearing capacity for a range of densities and moisture contents from the grading, Atterberg limits, linear shrinkage, shakedown bulk density and shape factor. This investigation has shown that physical laws govern both the compactability and bearing capacity of untreated roadbuilding materials, irrespective of their composition or nature, making it possible to approach the compaction of untreated roadbuilding materials in a more generalised manner.

40|$|MSWI {{bottom ash}} is a well-graded highly {{compactable}} material {{that can be}} used as a road material in unbound pavements. Achieving the compactness assumed in the design of the pavement is of primary concern to ensure long term structural stability. Regulations on road construction in a number of EU countries rely on standard tests originally developed for natural aggregates, which may not be appropriate to accurately assess MSWI bottom ash. This study is intended to assist in consistently assessing MSWI bottom ash compaction by means of the Proctor method. This test is routinely applied to address unbound road materials and suggests two methods. Compaction parameters show a marked procedural dependency due to the particle morphology and weak particle strength of ash. Re-compacting a single batch sample to determine Proctor curves is a common practise that turns out to overvalue optimum moisture contents and <b>maximum</b> <b>dry</b> <b>densities.</b> This could result in wet-side compactions not meeting stiffness requirements.

This project aims to use a vibratory method of compaction using an electric jackhammer to address these problems. Background: The MDR test is used to establish the <b>Maximum</b> <b>Dry</b> <b>Density</b> (MDD) and the Optimum Moisture Content (OMC) of coherent constriction materials for embankments, footings and pavements. This result is compared to {{the result of a}} field density test to find the relative density for quality control of construction projects. Methodology: A 1240 W electric jackhammer with a flat compaction plate was to supply compaction energy to the sample. The jackhammer was initially used hand held to find the compaction characteristics of the jackhammer then an apparatus was designed and built to hold the jackhammer during operation. Comparison was made between the results from Queensland Main Roads test method Q 110 A and the project results.

An investigation at the microscopic level with mercury intrusion porosimetry showed that lime treatment induced the formation of a new small class, with a diameter lower than 3 × 103 Å in the compacted soil. This class is responsible for the difference in dry density between the treated and the untreated sample after compaction. It is shown that this small pores class was not altered by the compaction water content, the compaction procedure or the dry density.

We also performed engineering property tests (compaction, California bearing ratio (CBR) and triaxial) both at the stabilized and unstabilized states with the addition of 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 % coconut shell and husk ash (CSHA) contents. The results showed that the soil samples were well graded sand with good to excellent rating as subgrade material for pavement construction. However, the engineering properties of the samples were further improved with the addition of 4 % CSHA contents. This caused reductions in the PI of samples A and C from 20. 43 to 16. 74 % and 29. 51 to 15. 67 % respectively and reduction at 2 % of CSHA in sample B.

From the graphs, stabilised soil has a very high <b>maximum</b> <b>dry</b> <b>density</b> of 2365 kg/m 3 at an optimum moisture content of 7. 2 % as compared to the unstabilised sample which has a <b>maximum</b> <b>dry</b> <b>density</b> which ranges from 2116 kg/m 3 to 2120 kg/m 3 determined above. This shows that SoilTechMkIII increases the <b>maximum</b> <b>dry</b> <b>density</b> of the soil. The optimum of moisture content of the stabilized sample increased by 0. 2 % from the optimum moisture content which was determined in the higher compactive effort (HCE) test of the unstabilised sample. It is recommended to stabilize the soil in order to increase its bearing capacity. It is also noted that the significance of mixing material thoroughly helps in coming out with more accurate results.,African Community Access Programme (AFCAP), International Road Federation (IRF), Zimbabwe National Road Administration(ZINARA...|$|E
40|$|This study {{presents}} laboratory {{experimental study}} {{on the effect of}} inclusion of polypropylene fiber in clay soil sample. The initial work of the experimental program presents the study of the effect of polypropylene fiber on <b>maximum</b> <b>dry</b> <b>density</b> and optimum moisture content with different fiber inclusions. The light compaction tests have been conducted on a clay soil sample with 0 %, 0. 25 %, 0. 50 %, 0. 75 %, 1. 0 % and 1. 25 % in additions of polypropylene fiber and the samples have been prepared with the same dry density. At the different stages of admixtures of polypropylene fiber with clay soil sample were tested and the <b>maximum</b> <b>dry</b> <b>density</b> and optimum content of fiber was found. The further study of experimental work focuses on the unconfined compression test, California bearing ratio test and swelling behavior of the soil sample. The experimental test results indicated that addition of polypropylene fiber inclusions in stabilized clay results in higher bearing strength values and California bearing ratio values...|$|E
40|$|Abstract – This paper {{examined}} the geotechnical properties of lateritic soils modified with coconut shell and husk ash {{with a view}} to obtaining a cheaper and effective road stabilizer. After collecting samples A, B and C from three borrow pits meant for road construction works, we performed preliminary tests on them for identification and classification purposes, followed by the consistency limit tests. We also performed engineering property tests (compaction, California bearing ratio (CBR) and triaxial) both at the stabilized and unstabilized states with the addition of 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 % coconut shell and husk ash (CSHA) contents. The results showed that the soil samples were well graded sand with good to excellent rating as subgrade material for pavement construction. However, the engineering properties of the samples were further improved with the addition of 4 % CSHA contents. This caused reductions in the PI of samples A and C from 20. 43 to 16. 74 % and 29. 51 to 15. 67 % respectively and reduction at 2 % of CSHA in sample B. We obtained optimum values of <b>maximum</b> <b>dry</b> <b>densities</b> (MDD) and shear strengths at 4 % CSHA stabilization. The addition of CSHA increased the values of shear strengths to 136. 32, 146. 91 and 127. 96 kN/m 2 whereas MDD increased to 1939. 00, 1749. 86 and 2080. 25 kg/m 3 respectively in samples A, B and C. We therefore concluded that coconut shell and husk ash has a good potential for improving the geotechnical properties of lateritic soils.

40|$|This paper {{compares the}} {{stabilizing}} effects {{of three different}} materials, namely: rice husk ash, powdered glass, and cement on the properties of lateritic soil. The basic properties of the lateritic soil were first obtained through colour, moisture content determination, specific gravity, particle size distribution and Atterberg limits tests. Each of the stabilizing materials was then mixed with the lateritic soil in varying percentages of 2. 5 %, 5 %, 7. 5 %, 10 %, 12. 5 % and 15 % by weight of the soil. Thereafter, compaction and California bearing ratio (CBR) tests were carried out on the sample mixes {{to determine the effects}} of the materials on the lateritic soil. Chemical tests were also carried out on the samples to determine their percentage oxides composition. The compaction test showed that the highest <b>maximum</b> <b>dry</b> <b>densities</b> (MDD) obtained for the mixed samples were 2. 32 g/cm 3 (at 2. 5 % cement addition), 2. 28 g/cm 3 (at 5 % powdered glass (PG) addition) and 2. 18 g/cm 3 (at 5 % rice husk ash (RHA) addition) with corresponding optimum moisture contents (OMC) of 10. 06 %, 14. 3 % and 12. 31 % respectively. The CBR tests showed that the CBR values increased in all cases as the materials were added with those of the cement and powdered glass giving the highest values and showing close semblance under unsoaked conditions. The chemical test showed that the significant oxides present in the cement, powdered glass and rice husk ash were CaO (53. 60 %), SiO 2 (68. 45 %) and SiO 2 (89. 84 %) respectively...|$|R
40|$|M. Tech. There is {{a general}} lack of {{understanding}} of the laboratory compaction test based on the vibrating hammer method. The impact method of testing soil in the laboratory is conservatively used by engineers for design and construction control purposes even when the specified mode of compaction on site is vibratory. Furthermore, the effects of vibratory compaction are not fully understood, and hence this mode of compaction in the field has not always been effectively utilized. The objective of this research project was to determine whether the vibrating hammer method could be used in the laboratory for design and control purposes, through an investigation of its operating characteristics, and a comparison of its effectiveness against that of the impact method, following a study of the compaction properties of a range of different soils used in road and embankment construction. The results of the study showed that the vibrating hammer can be used in place of impact in the laboratory for non-cohesive soils and gravels. In one instance, vibratory compaction produced <b>maximum</b> <b>dry</b> <b>densities</b> for a decomposed granite which were almost 5 % higher than that for impact compaction. Cohesive soils reached maximum compaction at moisture contents which were 7 % wetter under the vibratory mode as opposed to those for impact, but at lower densities. This showed that field densities under vibratory compaction would be difficult to achieve when the laboratory control method was based on impact. The research showed that electrical power input to the vibrating hammer must be carefully regulated in order to maintain specified standards which are based on a fixed frequency. Further study based on operation at different frequencies would be required to determine whether the vibrating hammer would be suitable for cohesive soils having natural frequencies lower than the current standard specified...|$|R
