We're working on really using all three vocals, which {{we used to}} do a bit more in the early days and works great, and people always seem to want more of, so that will be fun. But <b>mostly</b> <b>I</b> expect a great Dillinger Four record: fun, fast-paced, great change-ups and a couple songs on this one where it's a bit {{different}} than stuff we've done before.|$|E
500|$|Since [...] "Moves Like Jagger" [...] was {{the first}} time Maroon 5 had collaborated with an outside writer, the band decided to attempt it again on their next album, {{entitled}} Overexposed. Its title is supposedly an allusion to Levine's public ubiquity. In an interview with Rolling Stone, he opined that is their most dance-driven album ever, commenting: [...] "It's very much an old-fashioned disco tune. I have a love/hate relationship with it – but <b>mostly</b> <b>I</b> love it". The album and its lead single [...] "Payphone" [...] gave Maroon 5 their second Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Album and Best Pop Duo/Group Performance nominations. [...] In support of Overexposed, the band conducted the Overexposed Tour from 2012–13 (with the European leg extending to 2014 due to scheduling conflicts), and also headlined the 12th Annual Honda Civic Tour, which included The Voice contestant Tony Lucca.|$|E

2500|$|However, he was {{subsequently}} completely {{dropped from the}} squad by Moyes and pushed into the reserves despite being the top scorer. At {{the time of his}} Everton career, Velios mainly played for Everton Reserves, however still holding the Premier League statistic of a goal every 86 minutes, still the highest rate at Everton during 2011–2012 season. He made his 2012/13 first team debut by coming on as a sub against Sunderland, which Everton won 2–1 with Marouane Fellaini and Nikica Jelavic getting the goals for the Toffees. On 10 May 2014, after 3 and a half years with the Toffees, Vellios announced his removal from the club on Twitter. Throughout these years did not succeed {{to be one of the}} regulars of the club. [...] "I would like to thank Everton for these three and a half years of my life, but <b>mostly</b> <b>I</b> have a big thanks for the supporters. You will be forever in my heart" [...] he stated.|$|E

Korshunov remembered [...] "She never misses a chance of buying new books when competing in other places. Elena swallows one book after another. I see one book lying, next to her bag one day, a new one is there the next day." [...] She played checkers. She enjoyed going on angling trips with Viktor, her father, and Gennady. [...] "I like to read and listen to music, but <b>mostly</b> <b>I</b> enjoy a few quiet hours by the water. I love to go fishing. I {{spend a lot of time}} fishing with my father or my coach, either on a lake in a boat, or on the banks of the Neva." [...] She enjoyed cooking and baking. As with many gymnasts she has a fondness for ice cream.|$|E
2500|$|Thus {{began his}} {{transition}} into the brash, bombastic manager [...] "Captain" [...] Lou Albano. With a quick wit and a grating personality, Albano delivered memorable promos and earned the scorn of the wrestling audience as {{he attempted to}} dethrone World Wide Wrestling Federation superstar and WWWF World Heavyweight Champion Bruno Sammartino. Albano described the strategy behind his overblown, ranting interview style: [...] "I just remember the point I wanna bring across, and then I just babble before, during, and after. [...] Somehow, in the middle, I said {{the two or three}} sentences that sold tickets. [...] <b>Mostly,</b> <b>I</b> just tried to make people want to see me get my ass kicked, and along the way, hopefully the guy I was managing would catch a beating too!" [...] Growing out his hair and beard, and packing on extra pounds, Albano gave the image of a wild man. He developed a later trademark, applying rubber bands to his beard, after having seen a homeless man do the same. He also often wore a rubber band hanging from a safety pin pushed through his cheek.|$|E

We went down Carfex, I remember, to Folly Bridge, and inspected the Barges, and then back by way of Merton to the Botanic Gardens and Magdalen Bridge.

60|$|The Cathedral {{service is}} {{performed}} twice {{every day at}} ten o'clock and at four. When I first entered, the choristers (young and old, but <b>mostly,</b> <b>I</b> think, boys, with voices inexpressibly sweet and clear, and as fresh as bird-notes) were just winding up their harmonious labors, and soon came thronging through a side-door from the chancel into the nave. They were all dressed in long white robes, and looked like a peculiar order of beings, created on purpose to hover between the roof and pavement of that dim, consecrated edifice, and illuminate it with divine melodies, reposing themselves, meanwhile, on the heavy grandeur of the organ-tones like cherubs on a golden cloud. All at once, however, one of the cherubic multitude pulled off his white gown, thus transforming himself before my very eyes into a commonplace youth of the day, in modern frock-coat and trousers of a decidedly provincial cut. This absurd little incident, I verily believe, had a sinister effect in putting me {{at odds with the}} proper influences of the Cathedral, nor could I quite recover a suitable frame of mind during my stay there. But, emerging into the open air, I began to be sensible that I had left a magnificent interior behind me, and I have never quite lost the perception and enjoyment of it in these intervening years.|$|E
60|$|In many cases, {{let it be}} remembered, {{such action}} is not merely {{going back to the}} old ideal, but is even going back to the old reality. It would be a great step forward for the gin shop {{to go back to the}} inn. It is incontrovertibly true that to mediaevalize the public schools would be to democratize the public schools. Parliament did once really mean (as its name seems to imply) a place where people were allowed to talk. It is only lately that the general {{increase}} of efficiency, that is, of the Speaker, has made it mostly a place where people are prevented from talking. The poor do not go to the modern church, but they went to the ancient church all right; and if the common man in the past had a grave respect for property, it may conceivably have been because he sometimes had some of his own. I therefore can claim that I have no vulgar itch of innovation in anything I say about any of these institutions. Certainly I have none in that particular one which I am now obliged to pick out of the list; a type of institution to which I have genuine and personal reasons for being friendly and grateful: I mean the great Tudor foundations, the public schools of England. They have been praised for a great many things, <b>mostly,</b> <b>I</b> am sorry to say, praised by themselves and their children. And yet for some reason no one has ever praised them the one really convincing reason.|$|E
