I grew up kind of only thinking how much fun it was to tinkle on the piano and not noticing that what I did had an effect on others. I did not even think about a relationship to an audience, really, until way later.|$|E
500|$|President Grant: [...] "I did not {{remember}} about these dispatches at all until since the conspiracy trials have commenced. I have heard General Babcock's explanation of {{most or all of}} them since that. Many of the dispatches may have been shown to <b>me</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time,</b> and explained, but I do {{not remember}} it." ...|$|E
500|$|During {{the spring}} of 1964, Ray Davies played {{an early version of}} [...] "You Really Got Me" [...] on piano to rock {{photographer}} Allan Ballard during a photo shoot. Ballard later remembered, [...] "It was quite a small, pokey, Victorian Terrace, a bit scruffy, and in the hallway they had an upright piano. Ray sat down and plonked out, 'Der-der, der, Der-der!' He said, 'What do you reckon to this?' It meant nothing to <b>me</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time,</b> but it ended up as 'You Really Got Me'." ...|$|E

60|$|He sat down, {{and made}} me sit beside him. Holding my hand in both his own, he chafed it; gazing on <b>me,</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> same <b>time,</b> with <b>the</b> most troubled and dreary look.|$|R
500|$|Thrale {{explains}} that her {{book is not}} for [...] "diary-keeping in the strict sense" [...] when she writes: [...] "It is many Years since Doctor Samuel Johnson advised {{me to get a}} little Book, and write in it all the little Anecdotes which might come to my Knowledge, all the Observations I might make or hear; all the Verses never likely to be published, and in fine ev'ry thing which struck <b>me</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Time.</b> Mr Thrale has now treated me with a Repository, - and provided it with the pompous Title of Thraliana; I must endeavour to fill it with Nonsense new and old." [...] These encouraging remarks from Johnson set the theme of the work as it became a new [...] "Johnsoniana" [...] collection. In particular, she transferred her previous notes and documentations about Johnson's life into the collection.|$|E
500|$|LeMond has {{acknowledged}} since 2010 that the increasing prevalence of doping in cycling {{contributed to his}} lack of competitiveness. Said LeMond: [...] "Something had changed in cycling. The speeds were faster and riders that I had easily out performed were now dropping <b>me.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>time,</b> the team I was on, Team Z, {{became more and more}} demanding, more and more concerned..." [...] He stated he had been told in 1994 that he would need to blood dope in order to win again. LeMond did not focus solely on doping for his difficulties. He frankly admitted to Abt in 1999: [...] "I figure I had three months that went right for me after the hunting accident," [...] three months in which he won the two Tours and a world road race championship. [...] "The rest were just pure suffering, struggling, fatigue, always tired." ...|$|E
500|$|Boycott's slow scoring led to {{increasing}} media pressure, and owing to his perceived selfish attitude, he was {{dropped from the}} team after the match. He remembered in 1987 that [...] "the decision stunned <b>me</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time,</b> though looking back now I see that it had become inevitable. I was mortified with embarrassment and filled with an angry, burning sense of injustice which I can remember clearly and painfully to this day." [...] A combination of low confidence and a throat infection limited Boycott to two further Test appearances, playing once more against India and once against Pakistan, {{for the rest of}} the year. He nevertheless again topped the domestic averages with 1260 at 48.46. In 1967, Boycott toured the West Indies with England, where he hit a rich seam of form. He scored 463 runs at 66.14 in a series England won 1–0.|$|E

500|$|Peart {{has often}} been {{categorized}} as an Objectivist and an admirer of Ayn Rand. This is largely based on his work with Rush in the 1970s, particularly the song [...] "Anthem" [...] and the album 2112; the latter specifically credited Rand's work. However, in his 1994 Rush Backstage Club Newsletter, while contending the [...] "individual is paramount in matters of justice and liberty," [...] Peart specifically distanced himself from a strictly Objectivist line. In a June 2012 Rolling Stone interview, when asked if Rand's words still speak to him, Peart replied, [...] "Oh, no. That was forty years ago. But {{it was important to}} <b>me</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> in a transition of finding myself and having faith that what I believed was worthwhile." [...] Peart has also ascribed to a philosophy that he has called [...] "Tryism," [...] which means that anything that one tries to attain will be attained if one tries hard enough.|$|E
500|$|Jones {{was cast}} as Rooney {{based on his}} role in Amadeus, where he played the emperor; Hughes thought that character's modern {{equivalent}} was Rooney. [...] "My part was actually quite small in the script, but {{what seemed to be}} the important part to me was that I {{was the only one who}} wasn't swept along by Ferris", recalls Jones. [...] "So I was the only one in opposition, which presented a lot of opportunities, some of which weren't even in the script or were expanded on. John was receptive to anything I had to offer, and indeed got ideas along the way himself. So that was fun, working with him." [...] "Hughes told <b>me</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> — and I thought he was just blowing his own horn — he said, 'You are going to be known for this for the rest of your life.' And I thought, 'Sure'... but he was right." [...] To help Jones study for the part, Hughes took him to meet his old vice principal. [...] "This is the guy I want you to pay close attention to," [...] Jones explained to Hughes' biographer Kirk Honeycutt. While meeting him, the VP's coat momentarily flew open revealing a holster and gun attached to the man's belt. This made Jones realize what Hughes had envisioned."The guy was 'Sign up for the Army quick before I kill you!'" [...] Jones exclaimed.|$|E

60|$|That gentleman {{examined}} me, {{and pronounced}} {{the apex of}} my left lung {{to be in a}} state of consolidation, recommending <b>me</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> same <b>time</b> to go through a course of medical treatment and to take a long sea-voyage.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{know now}} that he was afraid of <b>me,</b> but <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> that did not occur to me. As I tried to explain to him he {{interrupted}} me in imperious tones, bidding me, I suppose, stand aside.|$|R
2500|$|Minor Threat's song [...] "Guilty of Being White" [...] {{led to some}} {{accusations of}} racism, but MacKaye has {{strongly}} denied such intentions and said that some listeners misinterpreted his words. He claims that his experiences attending Wilson High School, whose student population was 70 percent black, inspired the song. There, many students bullied MacKaye and his friends. Thrash metal band Slayer later covered the song, with the last iteration of the lyric [...] "Guilty of being white" [...] changed to [...] "Guilty of being right." [...] In an interview, MacKaye stated that he was offended that some perceived racist overtones in the lyrics, saying, [...] "To <b>me,</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> and now, it seemed clear it's an anti-racist song. Of course, it didn't occur to <b>me</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> I wrote it that anybody outside of my twenty or thirty friends who I was singing to would ever have to actually ponder the lyrics or even consider them." ...|$|E
2500|$|How [...] {{could have}} made a daily {{observation}} of my balcony is still a mystery to <b>me.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>time,</b> the back of my building was not enclosed so anyone could have driven in the back alley to observe my balcony. In addition, my balcony and the back of the apartment complex faced onto a courtyard or back area that was shared with a number of other apartment or office buildings in the area. My balcony could have been seen from dozens of apartments or offices.|$|E
2500|$|Gouldman’s {{reputation}} as a hit songwriter {{attracted the attention of}} bubblegum pop producers Jerry Kasenetz and Jeff Katz of Super K Productions, who invited him to New York to write formula bubblegum songs. In what he later called a [...] "creative lowpoint", Gouldman accepted. He recalled: [...] "They wanted me to write and produce for them, so I figured, why not? Nothing else was happening for <b>me</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time.</b> All told I worked for them for three or four periods {{over the course of a}} year, just writing and recording, and had no time for anything else. I was totally involved in the whole Kasenetz-Katz thing while I was with them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Fairly," [...] Lisle responded, smiling. [...] "I've already {{confessed that}} you people {{interest}} <b>me.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> same <b>time,</b> I had my difficulties--first {{of all to}} explain to the Marples why you didn't come.

2500|$|A {{number of}} television, radio, and {{newspaper}} reports listed Ladany {{as one of}} those killed. One headline stated: [...] "Ladany Could Not Escape his Fate in Germany for a Second Time". Ladany recalled later:The impact did not hit <b>me</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time,</b> when we were in Munich. It was when we arrived back in Israel. At the airport in Lod there was a huge crowd – maybe 20,000, people – and each one of us, the survivors, stood by one of the coffins on the runway. Some friends {{came up to me and}} tried to kiss me and hug me as if I was almost a ghost that came back alive. It was then that I really grasped what had happened and the emotion hit me.|$|E
2500|$|Lucretia Mott {{was active}} in the {{abolitionist}} movement. Though well known for her women's rights advocacy, Mott also {{played an important role in}} the abolitionist movement. During four decades, she delivered sermons about abolitionism, women's rights, and a host of other issues. Mott acknowledged her Quaker beliefs' determinative role in affecting her abolitionist sentiment. She spoke of the [...] "duty (that) was impressed upon <b>me</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> I consecrated myself to that Gospel which anoints 'to preach deliverance to the captive, to set at liberty them that are bruised..." [...] Mott's advocacy took a variety of forms: she worked with the Free Produce Society to boycott slave-made goods, volunteered with the Philadelphia Female Anti-Slavery Convention of American Women, and helped slaves escape to free territory.|$|E
2500|$|In 2006, in a {{town hall}} meeting in Pennsylvania debating the Jewish Tradition with Martin Amis, Hitchens commented on his {{political}} philosophy by stating, [...] "I am no longer a socialist, but I still am a Marxist". In a June 2010 interview with The New York Times, he stated that [...] "I still think like a Marxist in many ways. I think the materialist conception of history is valid. I consider myself a very conservative Marxist". In 2009, in an article for The Atlantic entitled [...] "The Revenge of Karl Marx", Hitchens frames the late-2000s recession in terms of Marx's economic analysis and notes how much Marx admired the capitalist system that he called for the end of, but says that Marx ultimately failed to grasp how revolutionary capitalist innovation was. Hitchens was an admirer of Che Guevara, yet in an essay written in 1997, he distanced himself from Che, and referred to the mythos surrounding him as a [...] "cult". In 2004 he re-emphasized his positive view of Che, commenting that [...] " [...] death {{meant a lot to me}} and countless like <b>me</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time.</b> He was a role model, albeit an impossible one for us bourgeois romantics insofar as he went and did what revolutionaries were meant to do—fought and died for his beliefs." ...|$|E

2500|$|Off-screen, actress Lucy Speed {{had decided}} to leave the serial after playing Natalie for a year, as she was {{reportedly}} “freaked out” by the media attention she was receiving from being in such a high-profile show. In an interview with the ‘’Walford Gazette’’, Speed commented: “I was very frightened by it quite frankly and certainly unprepared for it. I didn't like at all the attention that came with being on such a high-profile show. It simply wasn't what I signed up for in the first place-all that craziness. I was naive, I admit. Of course it does come with the job of being on the show and {{you have to learn to}} deal with it and cope with it. The advantages always outweigh the drawbacks, anyway, but it didn't seem like that to <b>me</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time.</b> I was very young and extremely shy, so it all became a huge difficulty for me…But I also have to make it clear that from the beginning when I joined, I always intended to stay in it for just a year anyway. I honoured my initial one-year contract and then moved on…they did express their interest in signing me for another year, but I politely but firmly declined. They were a bit shocked. I tried to explain in the best way I could my reasons for leaving at the end of my contract and they ultimately understood, and so I left on good terms with them…I had some growing up to do and instinctively knew that growing up more or less in front of the British public for one year was enough!” ...|$|E
2500|$|Scheduled for {{a release}} date of November 1998, the premiere issue was rescheduled for March 1999, to {{coincide}} with the creation of a trade paperback, , to help promote the new series. Collecting several of the character's printed appearances, Batman: Anarky was released in February 1999. However, the release date for the second volume was then pushed back again to May. An unintended result of this constant rescheduling was the effect it had on Grant's efforts to plot early story lines for the series. Due to increasing time constraints for the approaching millennium, it prevented Grant from exploring potential plots involving the Y2K bug he discussed with Breyfogle. Grant also reported that the series was dogged by editorial restrictions, including demands that he include cameos for particular characters, or [...] "tone down" [...] the degree of philosophy of the series. One of the earliest of these editorial mandates was that Grant was ordered to completely rewrite the first three-issue story line, and remove Anarky from Gotham City in the first issue. This was achieved by explaining that following an [...] Lonnie's parents disappear, their house is destroyed, and he is threatened by Batman to leave the city. [...] As one of many refugees who escapes from No Man's Land, he relocates to a new base of operations beneath the Washington Monument. Extremely displeased with the forced approach in creating this justification, Grant later said, [...] "Reading over that I was not so happy with the way I’d written that because it didn’t make sense to <b>me</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> and it doesn’t make sense now." [...] These constant impositions on the part of editors nearly drove Grant to quit the series, but he continued the project for Breyfogle's benefit. [...] "I was all for walking away, but artist Norm had a mortgage and family, and basically needed the work." ...|$|E
