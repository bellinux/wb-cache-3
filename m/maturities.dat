5|$|The forward {{exchange}} rate is {{the rate at which}} a commercial bank is willing to commit to exchange one currency for another at some specified future date. The {{forward exchange}} rate is a type of forward price. It is the exchange rate negotiated today between a bank and a client upon entering into a forward contract agreeing to buy or sell some amount of foreign currency in the future. Multinational corporations and financial institutions often use the forward market to hedge future payables or receivables denominated in a foreign currency against foreign exchange risk by using a forward contract to lock in a {{forward exchange rate}}. Hedging with forward contracts is typically used for larger transactions, while futures contracts are used for smaller transactions. This is due to the customization afforded to banks by forward contracts traded over-the-counter, versus the standardization of futures contracts which are traded on an exchange. Banks typically quote forward rates for major currencies in <b>maturities</b> of one, three, six, nine, or twelve months, however in some cases quotations for greater <b>maturities</b> are available up to five or ten years.|$|E
5|$|Although members {{contribute}} {{capital to}} the IBRD, the Bank acquires funds primarily by borrowing on international capital markets by issuing bonds. The Bank raised $29 billion USD worth of capital in 2011 from bonds issued in 26 different currencies. The IBRD {{has enjoyed a}} triple-A credit rating since 1959, which allows it to borrow capital at favorable rates. It offers benchmark and global benchmark bonds, bonds denominated in non-hard currencies, structured notes with custom-tailored yields and currencies, discount notes in U.S. dollars and eurodollars. In 2011, the IBRD sought an additional $86 billion USD (of which $5.1 billion would be paid-in capital) {{as part of a}} general capital increase to increase its lending capacity to middle-income countries. The IBRD expressed in February 2012 its intent to sell kangaroo bonds (bonds denominated in Australian dollars issued by external firms) with <b>maturities</b> lasting until 2017 and 2022.|$|E
5|$|The IFC makes {{loans to}} {{businesses}} and private projects generally with <b>maturities</b> of seven to twelve years. It determines a suitable repayment schedule and grace period for each loan individually to meet borrowers' currency and cash flow requirements. The IFC may provide longer-term loans or extend grace periods if a project is deemed to warrant it. Leasing companies and financial intermediaries may also receive {{loans from the}} IFC. Though loans have traditionally been denominated in hard currencies, the IFC has endeavored to structure loan products in local currencies. Its disbursement portfolio included loans denominated in 25 local currencies in 2010, and 45 local currencies in 2011, funded largely through swap markets. Local financial markets development is one of IFC’s strategic focus areas. In line with its AAA rating, it has strict concentration, liquidity, asset-liability and other policies. The IFC committed to approximately $5.7 billion in new loans in 2010, and $5 billion in 2011.|$|E

5|$|The Bank offers {{flexible}} loans with <b>maturities</b> {{as long as}} 30 {{years and}} custom-tailored repayment scheduling. The IBRD also offers loans in local currencies. Through a joint effort between the IBRD and the International Finance Corporation, the Bank offers financing to subnational entities either with or without sovereign guarantees. For borrowers needing quick financing for an unexpected change, the IBRD operates a Deferred Drawdown Option {{which serves as a}} line of credit with features similar to the Bank's flexible loan program. Among the World Bank Group's credit enhancement and guarantee products, the IBRD offers policy-based guarantees to cover countries' sovereign default risk, partial credit guarantees to cover the credit risk of a sovereign government or subnational entity, and partial risk guarantees to private projects to cover a government's failure to meet its contractual obligations. The IBRD's Enclave Partial Risk Guarantee to cover private projects in member countries of the IDA against sovereign governments' failures to fulfill contractual obligations. The Bank provides an array of financial risk management products including foreign exchange swaps, currency conversions, interest rate swaps, interest rate caps and floors, and commodity swaps. To help borrowers protect against catastrophes and other special risks, the bank offers a Catastrophe Deferred Drawdown Option to provide financing after a natural disaster or declared state of emergency. It also issues catastrophe bonds which transfer catastrophic risks from borrowers to investors. The IBRD reported $26.7 billion in lending commitments for 132 projects in fiscal year 2011, significantly less than its $44.2 billion in commitments during fiscal year 2010.|$|E

40|$|This paper studies early {{refinancing}} {{activities in}} the corporate bond market and its impli-cations for debt <b>maturity</b> structure. In additional to interest rate reduction, speculative-grade firms constantly extend <b>maturity</b> through early refinancing. Moreover, they take advantage of accommodating credit market conditions to extend <b>maturity</b> on a large scale, leading to pro-cyclical debt <b>maturity</b> structure. The evidence is consistent with precautionary <b>maturity</b> management, where speculative-grade firms extend <b>maturity</b> in order to hedge against future refinancing risk, as the longer <b>maturity</b> reduces {{the possibility of being}} forced to refinancing at high yield rates. In contrast, investment-grade firms do not appear to manage their <b>maturity</b> similarly, as they are less exposed to refinancing risk...|$|R

25|$|To {{facilitate}} the securitization of non-mortgage assets, businesses substituted private credit enhancements. First, they over-collateralised pools of assets; shortly thereafter, they improved third-party and structural enhancements. In 1985, securitization techniques {{that had been}} developed in the mortgage market were applied {{for the first time}} to a class of non-mortgage assets — automobile loans. A pool of assets second only to mortgages in volume, auto loans were a good match for structured finance; their <b>maturities,</b> considerably shorter than those of mortgages, made the timing of cash flows more predictable, and their long statistical histories of performance gave investors confidence.|$|E

25|$|Another {{explanation}} is that longer <b>maturities</b> entail greater risks for the investor (i.e. the lender). A risk premium is needed by the market, since at longer durations there is more uncertainty and a greater chance of catastrophic events that impact the investment. This explanation depends {{on the notion that}} the economy faces more uncertainties in the distant future than in the near term. This effect {{is referred to as the}} liquidity spread. If the market expects more volatility in the future, even if interest rates are anticipated to decline, the increase in the risk premium can influence the spread and cause an increasing yield.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to evaluate the performance of the conventional system of classifying <b>maturity</b> type in potato and to provide a concept of <b>maturity</b> type based on crop physiology. We present an approach in which physiological traits are used to quantify and assess <b>maturity</b> type unambiguously for a set of varieties covering a wide range of <b>maturity</b> classes and a diploid F 1 population separating for <b>maturity</b> and well-adapted to Dutch growing conditions, both grown in six environments. We defined physiological <b>maturity</b> based on four traits: the duration of maximum green canopy, the area under the green canopy cover progress curve, and the rate and duration of tuber bulking. The results indicated that physiological <b>maturity</b> type criteria tended to define <b>maturity</b> classes less ambiguously than the conventional criterion. Moreover, the conventional criterion was subject to more random noise and lacked stability and/or repeatability compared with the physiological traits. The physiological <b>maturity</b> criteria also illustrated the physiological trade-offs that existed between the selected traits and underlined the subtle complexities in classifying <b>maturity</b> type. This study highlighted the capabilities of different <b>maturity</b> type criteria in discriminating between different <b>maturity</b> classes among the large set of genotypes. Our new approach involving key physiological traits could be beneficial in offering physiology-based criteria to re-define <b>maturity</b> type. An improved criterion based on important physiological traits would allow relating the <b>maturity</b> to crop phenology and physiology. These new criteria may be amenable to further genetic analysis and could help in designing strategies for potato ideotype breeding for genotypes with specific <b>maturity</b> type...|$|R

Since these high-risk securities can experience large swings in price or even default, ultrashort bond funds, unlike money market funds, do not seek to maintain a stable $1.00 NAV and may lose money or dip below the $1.00 mark in the short term. Finally, because they invest in lower quality securities, ultrashort bond funds are more susceptible to adverse market conditions such as those brought on by the financial crisis of 2007–2010.|$|E
