500|$|Despite {{the racial}} and social {{implications}} of R and {{country at the}} time, Charles {{did not agree with}} contemporary views of race records and other genres, including pop and country, as essentially different. In an interview with Ben Fong-Torres of Rolling Stone, Charles said of the similarities between the blues and country music, [...] "he words to country songs are very earthy like the blues, see, very down. They're not as dressed up, and the people are very honest and say, 'Look, I miss you, darlin', so I went out and I got drunk in this bar.' That's the way you say it. Where in Tin Pan Alley will say, 'Oh, I <b>missed</b> <b>you</b> darling, so I went to this restaurant and I sat down and I had dinner for one.' That's cleaned up now, you see? But country songs and the blues is like it is." ...|$|E
500|$|The Charter {{called for}} the {{introduction}} of a constitutional monarchy, an independent judiciary, and a bicameral legislature composed of a lower house of elected representatives and an upper house of appointed legislators. The Charter also granted equal rights between men and women, and recognised all Bahraini citizens as having equal political rights, including the entitlement to elections and political candidacy. In the 8 February meeting, the government promised that [...] "the new political arrangements will not invalidate the 1973 constitution and that the upper appointed house will be for consultation only." [...] The next day, after leading Friday prayer, al-Jamri delivered a famous speech, starting with [...] "Allah is my witness, I have <b>missed</b> <b>you</b> as much as Jacob missed Joseph", before Abdulwahab announced that the opposition had decided to accept the reform plan. The National Action Charter was voted on in a referendum on 14 and 15 February, gaining massive popular support (98.4%). In November 2001, the Al Wefaq Shia political society was founded, with al-Jamri being seen as its mentor.|$|E
500|$|... "Feedback" [...] {{received}} general acclaim {{upon its}} release. Chuck Taylor of Billboard declared it a [...] "bona fide smash," [...] equipped with [...] "the goods for a meaningful return to pop." [...] Taylor noted the song [...] "features a gracious dance groove, but more so, supplies a sing along hook and distinctive melody," [...] likening it to [...] "a funked-up 'All for You'," [...] concluding [...] "Welcome back, Janet. <b>Missed</b> <b>you</b> much." [...] Glenn Gamboa of Newsweek called it [...] "enjoyable fluff," [...] with a [...] "robo-dance" [...] sound highlighting [...] "Jackson's playful phrasing {{and ability to}} mine the electro-groove." [...] Blender called it [...] "her most distinctive track in years," [...] and MTV News cited Jackson as [...] "bringing back the dance sound" [...] to the mainstream. Nick Levine of Digital Spy deemed it a [...] "libidinous strut" [...] that contains [...] "everything you want from a Jackson single", including [...] "hard-edged beats, plenty of hooks and enough attitude to compensate for her flimsy-as-cling-film voice." [...] Levine went on to call the track [...] "a Shoulda Been Smash, if only for Janet's boast that she's [...] "something heavy like a first-day period." [...] Keith Harris of Rolling Stone called the song a [...] "high-voltage money shot," [...] likening Jackson's vocals to a [...] "sex droid," [...] complete with [...] "crass" [...] beats and [...] "heavy breathing." [...] Harris added, [...] "When Janet brags she's heavy like a first-day period [...] all the amateur competition should just pack up their Webcams and go home." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{an email}} debate with Carmon, Whitaker asked about MEMRI's November 2000 {{translation}} {{of an interview}} given by the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem to Al-Ahram al-Arabi. One question asked by the interviewer was: [...] "How {{do you deal with}} the Jews who are besieging al-Aqsa and are scattered around it?" [...] which was translated as: [...] "How {{do you feel about the}} Jews?" [...] MEMRI cut out the first part of the reply and combined it with the answer to the next question, which, Whitaker claimed, made [...] "Arabs look more anti-semitic than they are". Carmon admitted this was an error in translation but defended combining the two replies as both questions referred to the same subject. [...] Carmon rejected other claims of distortion by Whitaker, saying: [...] "it is perhaps reassuring that you had to go back so far to find a mistake... You accused us of distortion by omission but when asked to provide examples of trends and views we have <b>missed,</b> <b>you</b> have failed to answer." [...] Carmon also accused Whitaker of [...] "using insults rather than evidence" [...] in his criticism of MEMRI.|$|E
2500|$|The Dwight Schrute {{character}} {{has had a}} very positive reception, and is often cited {{as one of the}} most popular characters on the show. According to Entertainment Weekly he is one of the [...] "greatest sidekicks." [...] In TV Guide's list of the top 100 characters in television history, Dwight was ranked 85th. [...] In an ABC News interview with Rainn Wilson, the interviewer commented that [...] "Words barely describe Dwight Schrute, the suck-up salesman and assistant to the regional manager of the Scranton branch for the Dunder Mifflin Paper Company..." [...] and [...] "Dwight, as played by the 41-year-old Wilson, has become one of the breakout characters in television comedy. Dwight is a survivalist geek, a student of karate who likes to shoot a crossbow and watch [...] "Battlestar Galactica" [...] on television. And he takes himself very, very seriously..." [...] E! News commented that Rainn Wilson should be nominated for an Emmy Award for his performance of Dwight, commenting: [...] "...Who's laughing now? Who's laughing now, Dwight Schrute? Oh, only the ten million-plus people who watched as you pepper sprayed the living daylights out of Roy for trying to pop Jim in the face last night. My God, have I <b>missed</b> <b>you,</b> man. Mr. Schrute, you are the reason I love my job, my friend. It is the selflessly heroic actions of a man such as you that make television a nice place to be on a Thursday night. You may just be an everyday citizen who does not accept prizes for being a citizen, but you'd best be accepting a supporting actor Emmy nod this year, because, hot damn if you don't deserve it." ...|$|E
