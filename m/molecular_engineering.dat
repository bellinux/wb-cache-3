2500|$|Notably, {{the growing}} {{capacity}} and fidelity of DNA synthesis platforms allows for increasingly intricate designs in <b>molecular</b> <b>engineering.</b> These projects may include very long strands of novel DNA sequence and/or test entire libraries simultaneously, {{as opposed to}} of individual sequences.

2500|$|The college offers 52 majors (originally called 'concentrations,' but {{changed in}} 2004). A primary {{departmental}} or committee affiliation is denoted {{for those whose}} names differ from that of their field designation. A student is awarded either the A.B. or S.B. degree. The college notably does not offer majors in pre-professional areas such as engineering (with {{the exception of the}} newly introduced <b>Molecular</b> <b>Engineering</b> program) or finance; however, the school contends that students going on to graduate study in these fields often can select work in related areas such as physics or economics in order to receive adequate preparation within the liberal arts tradition. The college recently introduced minors in a select numbers of fields, and also offers several joint bachelors / masters programs to high performing students in a variety of subjects.|$|E
