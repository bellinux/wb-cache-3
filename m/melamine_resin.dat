25|$|Formaldehyde is {{a common}} {{precursor}} to more complex compounds and materials. In approximate order of decreasing consumption, products generated from formaldehyde include urea formaldehyde resin, <b>melamine</b> <b>resin,</b> phenol formaldehyde resin, polyoxymethylene plastics, 1,4-butanediol, and methylene diphenyl diisocyanate. The textile industry uses formaldehyde-based resins as finishers to make fabrics crease-resistant. Formaldehyde-based materials are key to the manufacture of automobiles, and used to make components for the transmission, electrical system, engine block, door panels, axles and brake shoes. The value of sales of formaldehyde and derivative products was over $145 billion in 2003, about 1.2% {{of the gross domestic}} product (GDP) of the United States and Canada. Including indirect employment, over 4 million people work in the formaldehyde industry across approximately 11,900 plants in the U.S. and Canada.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a systematical {{approach to the}} properties of wood impregnated with different waterbased <b>melamine</b> <b>resins,</b> to {{provide a basis for}} further research. Therefore, ten commercially available methylated <b>melamine</b> formaldehyde <b>resins</b> with increasing ratios of melamine to formaldehyde have been compared in respect of their influence in dimension stabilisation, sorption behaviour, formaldehyde emissions, and water repellency of the treated wood. The dimension stabilisation caused by resin molecules that penetrated the wooden cell wall correlated with the molar mass of the resins used for impregnation. The changes in the sorption isotherms were attributed to a bulking effect. Formaldehyde emissions during and after curing increased with an increasing ratio of formaldehyde to <b>melamine</b> in the <b>resins...</b>|$|R

50|$|Resin is then mist-sprayed through fine nozzles {{onto the}} particles. There are {{several types of}} resins that are {{commonly}} used. Amino-formaldehyde based resins are the best performing when considering cost and ease of use. Urea <b>Melamine</b> <b>resins</b> are used to offer water resistance with increased melamine offering enhanced resistance. It is typically used where the panel is used in external applications due to the increased water resistance offered by phenolic resins and also the colour of the resin resulting in a darker panel. Melamine Urea phenolic formaldehyde resins exist as a compromise. To enhance the panel properties even further the use of resorcinol resins typically mixed with phenolic resins are used, but this is usually used with plywood for marine applications and a rare occasion in panel production.|$|R
5000|$|An {{electric}} arc {{over the surface}} of plastics causes their degradation. A conductive carbon-rich track tends to form in the arc path, negatively influencing their insulation properties. The arc susceptibility is tested according to ASTM D495, by point electrodes and continuous and intermittent arcs; it is measured in seconds required to form a track that is conductive under high-voltage low-current conditions. Some materials are less susceptible to degradation than others. For example, polytetrafluoroethylene has arc resistance of about 200 seconds (3.3 minutes). From thermosetting plastics, alkyds and <b>melamine</b> <b>resins</b> are better than phenolic resins. Polyethylenes have arc resistance of about 150 seconds; polystyrenes and polyvinyl chlorides have relatively low resistance of about 70 seconds. Plastics can be formulated to emit gases with arc-extinguishing properties; these are known as arc-extinguishing plastics.|$|R

40|$|One-layer particleboards (pine wood) {{were made}} using three {{different}} low-emission UFresins and various amounts of different catalysts (ammonium sulfate, ammonium nitrate, {{a mixture of}} ammonium sulfate and formic acid). <b>Melamine</b> formaldehyde <b>resin,</b> resorcinol, quebracho-tannin and diphenylmethane diisocyanate (PMDI) were used as modifiers. The investigations led to the following results: The use of ammonium nitrate as a catalyst led, compared with ammonium sulfate and the mixture from ammonium sulfate and formic acid, to higher mechanical properties and lower thickness swelling of the particleboards. Particleboards bonded with UF <b>resin</b> modified with <b>melamine</b> formaldehyde <b>resin</b> showed, compared with the other investigated modifications, higher resistance in dry state, in the wet state and after water soaking and redrying of the particleboards, and lower thickness swelling.

40|$|A new four-step synthetic-route for {{combining}} chromophores with <b>melamine</b> <b>resins</b> {{was developed}} and practized. Despite of other <b>melamine</b> <b>resins,</b> the basis molecule of this system is the 2, 4, 6 -trichloro- 1, 3, 5 -triazine, the cyanuric chloride. In the first step the azochromophore was bonded to the s-triazine-ring. Then the residual chlorines of this triazine-chromophore were substituted by ammonia or primary amines. In the third step an aldehyde was added, leading to melamine- chromophore precondensates. For increasing the stability and the solubility of these precondensates the reactive methylolgroups were etherificated with methyl- or butylalcohol. The mass-spectra give evidence that the modified melamine precondensates are monomers and no mixture of different oligomers like else in melamine-aldehyde prepolymers. Though the result of these systems is a crosslinkable melamine-chromophore monomer which is converted in a resin by heating or under acid conditions. It is remarkable that these polymers show an excellent thermal stability with a decomposition temperature far beyond 300 °:C, a great advantage for using them a s optical materials. Resins, which build homogenous amorphous and highly transparent films, were achieved by thermal treating of the melamine-chromophore-resins. The reaction steps were monitored by online-IR-spectroscopy, which has enabled to find and optimize the reaction conditions of the syntheses steps. Furthermore the characteristic changing IR-bands and time-reaction-profiles were extracted. Concerning their usability in second order nonlinear optics the alignment of the dipoles was investigated by applying a corona discharge. Simultaneously to the poling process, the monomers were polycondensated by thermal heating. The continuously measured UV/Vis-absorptions of the poled polymer films have demonstrated that the absorption of the film have fallen within the first weeks after poling. An electric potential from 10 till 20 V could be measured during this period, indicating orientation processes of the poled films. The E/Z-switching behaviour of the azo-groups were investigated by Kelvin-Probe. The results have demonstrated that the new monomers and polymers are potential candidates for optical switching processes. The fixing of thioles on the triazine-chromophores of the first reaction step has been made successfully. E/Z-switchings of self-assembled monolayers of the azo-triazine-thioles on gold have indicated that these monolayers need {{only a few seconds}} for an isomerization process. <P...|$|R
30|$|A {{practical}} {{approach to}} enhancing the fire retardancy of wood-based materials by adding fire-retardant chemicals to the glue was developed. Plywoods were manufactured using urea <b>melamine</b> formaldehyde <b>resin</b> mixed with ammonium pentaborate or dihydrogen phosphate. Treated plywoods had better incombustibility than untreated ones. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis clearly demonstrated {{the distribution of}} boron and phosphorus, which had migrated from the glue to the wood, contributing to better fire retardant properties. The cross-sectional micrographs from scanning electron microscopy showed that untreated specimens exhibited a foamy structure near the interface in the glue layer and the deformed structure of wood cells. The cell structure and cell wall thickness retained intact in the specimens treated with urea <b>melamine</b> formaldehyde <b>resin</b> mixed with ammonium pentaborate or dihydrogen phosphate. When observing {{the effect of the}} thickness of overlay veneers on incombustibility, a shorter glowing time was obtained from the specimens with a thicker surface layer when the fire retardant chemical was added at 2 %, but the differences were smaller at the higher chemical retention of 4 %. A similar tendency was observed for the char length.|$|R
