40|$|In {{this work}} we develop a Markov Chain Jump-Diffusion (MCJD) model, {{where we have}} a {{financial}} market in which there are several possible states. Asset prices in the market follow a generalised geometric Brownian motion, with drift and volatility depending {{on the state of the}} market. So for example, one state may represent a bull <b>market</b> where <b>drifts</b> are high, whilst another state may represent a bear <b>market</b> where where <b>drifts</b> are low. The state the market is in is governed by a continuous time Markov chain. We add to this diffusion process jumps in the asset price which occur when the market changes state, and the jump sizes are dependent on the states the market is transiting to and transiting from. We also allow the market to transit to the same state, which corresponds to a jump in the asset price with no change to the drift or volatility. We will develop conditions of no arbitrage in such a market, and methods for pricing derivatives of assets whose prices follow MCJD processes. We will also consider Term-Structure models where the short rate (or forward rate) follows an MCJD process...|$|R

Strategy execution so far has not received the attention it should be given in view of its critical role in the performance of the firm, especially with the growth of complexity in organizations. The attention that is usually given to strategy execution in the strategy literature and especially in popular management books is, with a few exceptions, not linked to the system of management control being the function responsible for the system of strategy execution, especially through the resource allocation process. Vice versa, within the function of management control also divergent schools exists on strategy execution, and {{the field of}} management control under influence of the capital <b>market</b> has <b>drifted</b> too much away into management accounting.

For an investor who maximizes expected logarithmic utility of his portfolio, we derive the optimal strategy explicitly in different settings for the available information. The optimal expected utility, the value function of the control problem, de-pends on the conditional variance. The bounds and asymptotic results for the conditional variances are used to derive bounds and asymptotic properties for the value functions.

To elaborate how the martingale for the Libor belongs to the general class of numeraire for the forward interest rates, two other numeraire’s are considered, namely the money market measure that makes {{the evolution of the}} zero coupon bonds a martingale, and the forward measure for which the forward bond price is a martingale. The price of an interest rate cap is computed for all three numeraires, and is shown to be numeraire invariant.

This renders remaining problems equivalent to solving European contingent claims under a new forward measure, and it is straightforward to obtain a forward looking non-sequential Monte Carlo simulation scheme. We also give a special example where the hedging position is available in a semi-closed form.

The scanning process is inherently slow and commonly suffers from instrumental drift. Drift evaluation and control is an important issue for quantitative metrology. Drift characterization is essential in order to establish an appropriate method for eliminating, compensating or correcting it, allowing the improvement of measurement quality and accuracy. Drift distortions are often regarded as temperature-dependent phenomena, associated with temperature gradients and transients that may occur both in the single components of the equipment and in the measuring volume. Commercial SPMs are designed and manufactured with different approaches, e. g. combining different scanners' architectures, with selected hardware, software and materials, in order to optimize specific instrument performances such as accuracy and scanning speed.

A study of the political, technical, and economical conjuncture and balance of power at the international level show three important periods. 1904 - 1941  : The imperialistic policy of the military-industrial complex supports the operations of the large enterprises. Between 1933 and 1940, Japan has several hundreds of fishing plants along the coasts of the Russian Far East; factory vessels are used for the canning of salmon and crabs in the Sea of Okhostk and the Behring Sea, and for whaling in the Antarctic and North Pacific; industrial trawling is carried on along the coasts of the Asian continent while numerous enterprises are set up in Indo-Malaysia for coastal tuna fishing. 1948 - 1973  : Within the framework of the reconstruction of its economy, Japan at first resumes the same campaigns as those of the pre-War period; to these are added drifting long line fishing of tuna in the intertropical grounds and a powerful industrial trawling in North Pacific. By 1960, these activities are curtailed due to regulations imposed by USSR, USA, and the International Whaling Commission for stock protection. And then there are new competitors (Taiwan, South Korea). A general fail off after 1965 is partly compensated by the industrial trawling in the Behring Sea. 1974 - 1986 : Significant geopolitical and economic changes force Japan to define and to redeploy its foreign fisheries.

The amount to which a particular area of non-profit activity is effected by social enterprise and the outcomes can be studied {{with the help of}} structuration of organisational fields. Structuration is the process by which areas of a social activity are ordered. At much higher levels, this accounts to increasing organisational interaction and incorporation thereby developing a consensus although no methodical research has been taken place by the approaches specified. One more theme that went unaddressed was to what degree non-profits rely extensively on earned income and are successful in their ventures. We also need to identify that earned income can govern non-profits. Conceptual challenges root out from the fact that best practices are not customary and the theory of change is not aligned. Further, operational challenges consist of situations where values cannot always be measured and quality measurement is not sound. Structural challenges comprise of the issue that important diversity exists within each non-profit field.

40|$|Optimal {{premium pricing}} {{policies}} {{in a competitive}} insurance environment are investigated using approximation methods and simulation of sample paths. The market average premium is modelled as a diffusion process, with the premium as the control function and the maximization of the expected total utility of wealth, over a finite time horizon, as the objective. In order to simplify the optimisation problem, a linear utility function is considered and two particular premium strategies are adopted. The first premium strategy is a linear function of the market average premium, while the second is a linear combination of the break-even premium and the market average premium. The optimal strategy is determined over the free parameters of each functional form. It is found that for both forms the optimal strategy is either to set a premium close to the break-even or not to sell insurance depending on the model parameters. If conditions are suitable for selling insurance then for the first premium strategy, {{in the case of}} no <b>market</b> average premium <b>drift,</b> the optimal premium rate is approximately ¯p(0) /aT above break-even where ¯p(0) is the initial market average premium, a is a constant related to the elasticity of demand and T is the time horizon.

This leads to optimal strategies which generate substantial wealth since then the market average premium can be much larger than break-even leading to significant market exposure whilst simultaneously making a profit.

With contributions from leading academics, this book {{is the first to}} provide a comprehensive analysis of the varying historical origins of, and recent developments in, vocational training systems, offering in-depth studies on coordinated market economies, namely Germany, Austria, Switzerland, the Netherlands, and Denmark. It also contains comparative chapters that analyze how these countries react to common challenges such as deindustrialization, labor <b>market</b> stratification, academic <b>drift,</b> gender inequalities, and Europeanization. Whereas previous research has focused on the differences between various kinds of skill regimes, this book focuses on explaining institutional variety within the group of collective skill formation systems. The development of skill formation systems is regarded as a dynamic political process, dependent on the outcome of various political struggles regarding such matters as institutional design and transformations during critical junctures in historical development.

40|$|Thesis (M. Ing. (Computer and Electronic Engineering)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2012. In this {{research}} the market’s reaction to earnings announcements is investigated. The investigation {{can be divided}} into three parts: testing whether earnings announcements convey any information to the market; finding any patterns in the market’s response to the earnings announcements and testing the exploitability of patterns through the simulation of trading strategies. The three part investigation essentially focuses on two parts of the market’s reaction to earnings announcements on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) for the period 1991 to 2010. The first part focuses on the short–term market reaction around earnings announcements including the dynamics of the response and the information content of earnings announcements, the predictability of the earnings surprise and the exploitability of the predictability. We found that the magnitude of the cumulative returns for the days [0; 2] is on average positive and decreases with an increase in firm size. The average information content of earnings announcements also decreases with an increase in firm size. This therefore means information uncertainty decreases with size. The earnings surprise is on average found to be predictable for firms in the two smallest size categories and shares with relatively low liquidity. Proxies for the value effect and particularly the autocorrelation structure of unexpected earnings provide some additional information to predict future unexpected earnings. Our findings regarding the autocorrelation structure of the three–day reaction (event returns) to earnings announcements are consistent with that found by Bernard and Thomas [1]. We however found that the autocorrelation is largely restricted to small size firms. The second part of the investigation involves the longer–term reaction to earnings announcements which includes investigating the statistical significance and exploitability of the post–earnings announcement drift (PEAD). The Post–Earnings Announcement Drift anomaly has been widely researched and confirmed for several markets around the world. It is observed that contrary to previous research conducted on the JSE that confirmed the overreaction phenomenon for the period 1975 – 1989 [2], evidence suggests that for the period under investigation the PEAD effect occurred on the JSE for the period from 1991 to 2010 and it is found to be statistically significant and independent of the size, value and/or momentum effect. All these effects are however found to have a significant influence on the magnitude of the PEAD effect. The results indicate that the market reacts very quickly to the announced earnings and it is not until about the 20 th to 40 th trading day after the earnings announcement that the <b>market</b> starts <b>drifting</b> {{in the direction of the}} initial reaction. The market therefore seems not to underreact to the earnings information at first, but that it receives confirmation in the two months following the announcement that is indicative of better future prospects and that the higher than expected earnings might persist. In retrospect, when only considering earnings news, it thus seems that the market under–reacted to the information released at the earnings announcement. We however found no conclusive evidence in the trading simulation analysis to indicate that the PEAD effect can be exploited on a profitable basis.
