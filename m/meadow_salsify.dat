50|$|Western salsify {{is quite}} similar to the {{generally}} commoner <b>meadow</b> <b>salsify,</b> T. pratensis, but the bracts which show behind the flower head, a distinctive feature of salsifies, are longer and more noticeable. Although not particularly closely related to <b>meadow</b> <b>salsify</b> or the common salsify or oyster plant (T. porrifolius), the western salsify hybridises readily with both, and in North America its hybrids {{have given rise to}} the new alloploid hybrid species T. mirus and T. miscellus.|$|E

5000|$|Tragopogon pratensis (common names Jack-go-to-bed-at-noon, <b>meadow</b> <b>salsify,</b> showy goat's-beard or meadow goat's-beard) is a {{biennial}} {{plant in}} the Asteraceae family, distributed across Europe and North America, commonly growing in fields (hence its name) and on roadsides. It is found in North America from southern Ontario to Massachusetts; most of England; on the eastern and southern edges of Scotland; and central Ireland but not the coastal edges.|$|E
5000|$|Salsifies are {{one example}} where hybrid {{speciation}} has been observed. In the early 1900s, humans introduced three species of goatsbeard into North America. These species, the western salsify (T. dubius), the <b>meadow</b> <b>salsify</b> (T. pratensis), and the oyster plant (T. porrifolius), are now common weeds in urban wastelands. In the 1950s, botanists found two new {{species in the}} regions of Idaho and Washington, where the three already known species overlapped. One new species, Tragopogon miscellus, is a tetraploid hybrid of T. dubius and T. pratensis. The other species, Tragopogon mirus, is also an allopolyploid, but its ancestors were T. dubius and T. porrifolius. These new species are usually referred to as [...] "the Ownbey hybrids" [...] after the botanist who first described them. The T. mirus population grows mainly by reproduction of its own members, but additional episodes of hybridization continue {{to add to the}} T. mirus population.|$|E
40|$|Experimental {{studies have}} shown that {{phenolic}} compounds have antiproliferative and tumour arresting effects. The aim of this original study was to investigate the content of phenolic compounds (PhC) in flowers of Allium schoenoprasum (chive), Tragopogon pratensis (<b>meadow</b> <b>salsify)</b> and Rumex acetosa (common sorrel) and their effect on proliferation of HaCaT cells. Antiproliferative effects were evaluated in vitro using the following concentrations of phenolic compounds in cultivation medium: 100, 75, 50 and 25 µg/mL. Phenolic composition was also determined by HPLC. The results indicate that even low concentrations of these flowers’ phenolic compounds inhibited cell proliferation significantly and the possible use of the studied herb’s flowers as sources of active phenolic compounds for human nutrition...|$|E
40|$|During {{past decades}} {{a lot of}} {{experimental}} studies shown that polyphenols have anti-carcinogenic properties have been published. Their antioxidant and tumour arresting effects have been demonstrated using both in vitro and in vivo studies many times. Aim {{of the present study}} was to investigate the content of polyphenols in edible flowers of Ag yoncha, Wild chive, <b>Meadow</b> <b>salsify</b> and Garden sorrel and their effect on proliferation activity of human hepatocellular carcinoma cells which has not been studied yet. Anti-proliferative effect was evaluated in vitro using following concentrations of polyphenols 100, 75, 50 and 25 Ķg/ml. Also, phenolic composition was determined by the high performance liquid chromatography. The present results indicate that even low concentrations of edible flowers’ polyphenols inhibited cell proliferation significantly. This effect was observed at all studied edible flowers extracts and was independent on the compositions of individual polyphenols. Results indicate possible employment of studied edible flowers for prevention as well as for treatment of cancers...|$|E
