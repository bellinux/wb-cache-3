40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was threefold; (1) to {{identify}} instructional technologies teacher educators use in teaching <b>methods</b> <b>courses,</b> (2) to identify the factors that influence their decisions for using such technologies in teaching <b>methods</b> <b>courses,</b> and (3) to investigate the extent to which teacher educators address the use of technology in inclusion in teaching <b>methods</b> <b>courses.</b> In this study, thirty teacher educators responded to fourteen Likert Scale questions, seven open-ended questions, listed technologies they use in the <b>methods</b> <b>courses,</b> and 5 of the teacher educators responded to another seven interview questions. The study used a concurrent mixed methods research design and used t-test, analysis of variances and Wilcoxon to analyze quantitative data. For qualitative data, collected through the Open-ended Questionnaire and Technology Inventory Checklist and the semi-structured interview responses were analyzed using open-coding. The results showed that teacher educators do use several technologies. However, the technologies they use are mostly instructional technologies and not inclusive technologies. In addition, the technologies used are more of content management like Desire to Learn and Black Board. Very few pedagogical and content delivery technologies are modeled to pre-service teachers. The study found that, regardless of teacher educators 2 ̆ 7 experience, tenure and non-tenure, they all model technology similarly and not much variety of technology is used. They also minimally model inclusive technologies in the <b>methods</b> <b>courses.</b> The extent teacher educators model technology to pre-service teachers was low. While one third of the participants reported modeling technology for inclusion, the results also showed that two thirds of teacher educators modeled technology minimally. These results concurred with the results from the technology inventory list which showed that very few inclusive technologies are modeled to pre-service teachers in the <b>methods</b> <b>courses.</b> Study also found a non-significant effect on technology use and technologies used due gender, tenure, K- 12 teaching experience or technology training. These results have an implication on how teacher educators integrate, use and model technology in the <b>methods</b> <b>courses</b> to pre-service teachers...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine {{prospective}} mathematics teachers' knowledge development and beliefs changes for teaching fraction division through the undergraduate mathematics <b>method</b> <b>course</b> to the field practice. Further, it reveals the correlation between the knowledge development and beliefs changes. Therefore, this study uses a qualitative methodology. I analyze the data from two time periods using three steps. In the <b>method</b> <b>course</b> period, interviews concerning knowledge and beliefs are triangulated with the tests, surveys, concept mapping and the writing assignment. There are two steps in this time period. First, I focus on a total of 27 prospective teachers' subject matter knowledge (SMK), including common content knowledge (CCK) and special content knowledge (SCK), and its development. Further, I examine their beliefs changes towards fraction division and mathematics teaching and learning during the <b>method</b> <b>course.</b> Next, I choose six participants from the total 27, based on different mathematics achievement. I do this to identify 1) whether CCK differences impact SCK development and 2) whether SCK development influence beliefs changes in the <b>method</b> <b>course.</b> In the field practice period, classroom observation of fraction division is triangulated with the interviews. I follow up one prospective teacher in his field practice and focus on the way his beliefs influence his teaching behavior and the development of the pedagogical content knowledge (PCK), through the teaching. The results indicate that the prospective teachers developed both CCK and SCK in their <b>method</b> <b>course.</b> Their beliefs towards to teaching and learning fraction division progress from procedural-oriented to conceptual-oriented. The knowledge development and beliefs changes derived from the different learning experiences from their past school experiences and <b>method</b> <b>course.</b> Moreover, prospective teachers who had high CCK developed his/her SCK significantly. Thus, his/her beliefs changes became more significant. Further, the prospective teacher's beliefs changes in the <b>method</b> <b>course</b> influenced the way of teaching behavior in the field practice and SCK impacts PCK in teaching. On the other hand, field practice changed prospective teacher's beliefs and the development of PCK. Therefore, further attention is called for in the prospective teachers' knowledge transition and beliefs changes from a student to a future teacher...|$|R

40|$|In 2010 the Common Core State Standards (CCSS) for {{mathematics}} and English Language Arts were introduced into K – 12 classrooms (Common Core State Standards Initiative, 2015 b). The standards for mathematics focus on having students demonstrate and explain understanding {{more than the}} standards {{have in the past}} (Burns, 2013). McCallum (2011) divides the eight Standards for Mathematical Practice into four main themes: reasoning and explaining, modeling and using tools, seeing structure and generalizing, and overarching habits of mind of a productive mathematical thinker. These four themes encompass what a mathematics classroom should look like when utilizing the CCSS for mathematics. With this shift in the standards it creates a need for teachers to have a strong content knowledge and pedagogical understanding (Zhang, 2014). One place to look and see whether teachers are prepared for these new standards is the university level with teacher preparation programs. <b>Methods</b> <b>courses</b> have long been the place where preservice teachers gain pedagogical content knowledge (Shulman, 1987) and gain methods of teaching mathematics that can be carried into their own classrooms someday (Ball, 1990).

The Likert item data was quantitatively analyzed to report means by item and to look for statistically significant changes between the pre-and post-administrations of the survey. The open-ended items were analyzed using the qualitative technique of open coding to look for trends and patterns. Data were disaggregated to highlight minority students’ responses. In addition, a number of qualitative case studies (n= 10) were conducted of UM and BSU interns as they experienced in their senior year the semester long transformative science <b>methods</b> <b>course</b> and their yearlong PDS urban field placements. At least 6 of the participants were minority teacher candidates, representing both BSU and UM (3 from each institution).

What assignments were required in the special <b>methods</b> <b>courses.</b> 3. What content was included in the special <b>methods</b> <b>courses.</b> 4. What instructional materials were used and taught to students in the special <b>methods</b> <b>courses.</b> 5. What <b>methods</b> were used and taught to students in the special <b>methods</b> <b>courses.</b> To obtain the information that this study was based on, a survey questionnaire was constructed, validated and sent to the head of the home economics department in 210 colleges or universities in the United States. The 111 that were returned in usable form were divided into five groups on the basis of the division of the academic year and the number of special <b>methods</b> <b>courses</b> offered. The results obtained from the analysis of these data indicated, in most instances, what the present practices and beliefs of home economics educators were but the responses to the trends and beliefs of these educators regarding what they thought should be done if there were no limiting factors was poor, so any statements concerning trends had to be of a general nature. The facilities and equipment which were available a majority of the time to the home economics education teachers and students included projectors, resource materials and subject-matter files, and the seminar-library room. The respondents desired more access to the instructional materials center, multipurpose laboratory, seminar-library room and the opaque and overhead projectors. A similar group of assignments were believed desirable and were required by the 111 respondents. These included the development of plans, evaluative and illustrative materials and the study of guides, journals, resource materials, textbooks and topics of special interest to the students. Content believed desirable and included by the teacher educators were similar. This content included philosophy, trends, curriculum, evaluation, understanding and working with students, management of and interpreting the department, teaching of special areas and professional obligations. The instructional materials the respondents used and taught students to use included bulletin boards, charts, chalk boards, exhibits, films and filmstrips, flannel boards and posters. The home economics educators believed it was desirable to use the opaque and overhead projectors, photographs and tape recorders more than they were at the time of this study. The methods used by teacher educators which they also taught students to use included development of concepts and generalizations, cooperative planning, discussion methods, demonstrations, evaluation and grading, family centered teaching, field trips, laboratory, lecture, problem solving, reports and role playing. In addition to these, the students were taught to use case studies, home and extended experiences, home visits, sociograms and supervised study. Also included in the methods used by teachers and students were taught to use was learning experiences to develop an understanding of how to develop creativity. It appeared desirable to use some methods more than they were used at the time of this study. These methods included activities to develop creativity, case studies, home and extended experiences, home visits, interviews, problem solving, programmed learning, puppets, supervised study and team teaching...|$|R
