40|$|TREASURE (Towards Responsible ExtrAction of SUbmarine REsources) is a Dutch project {{funded by}} the Technology Foundation (STW) and {{industry}} with the aim to develop and test methodologies enabling the industry to properly monitor the impacts of deep-sea mining of SMS (Seafloor Massive Sulphide) deposits. SMS deposits contain {{a high percentage of}} metals like copper, zinc, gold as well as trace metals for industrial applications (e. g. electronics) (Hein et al. 2013), and are typically found near vent sites in seafloor spreading areas such as the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (MAR). The protected Rainbow Vent site (36 o 13. 8 N 33 o 54. 12 ’W) {{is an example of a}} vent on MAR outside the EEZ containing SMS deposits (Marques et al. 2006; Hannington et al. 2011). The TREASURE project has selected Rainbow Vent as study area (Fig. 1) to test methodologies and approaches acknowledging that the area is protected under the OSPAR convention and is not a potential mining site. Moreover, the focus of TREASURE is on the background environment and fauna of the vent site and not on the active vents themselves as latter will be not be targeted by mining. In comparison to the active vents and their fauna, little to nothing is known of the background. The TREASURE project covers 3 cruises (2014 - 2016) during which video-footage has been recorded, oceanographic measurements have been made using bottom moored instruments, and water and small sediment samples have been collected. The sampling is conducted in cooperation withcolleagues from the University of the Azores and various other European universities. The Dutch TREASURE project has strong links with the European MIDAS project (www. EU-Midas. net) through exchange of data and scientific crew. For the 3 rd TREASURE cruise (64 PE 412), the following primary activities were scheduled: • recovery of <b>moored</b> <b>equipment</b> (2 x landers, 1 x mooring) which had been deployed in spring 2015; • collection of water (CTD) and seabed samples (boxcorer) at varying distances from Rainbow Vent; • video surveys of the seafloor to supplement earlier recordings; • deployment of 2 seafloor moorings with thermistors for the duration of the cruise. Primary focus of the sampling program will be put on the background physical conditions and associated deep-water fauna at varying distances from the active Rainbow vent. As secondary target a seamount was chosen ca 10 nm N of Rainbow Vent with a contrasting rich fauna on its flanks and summit (see map in Fig 2). Video recordings of the seamount had already been made in 2014 and 2015 TREASURE cruises...|$|R

The EU's Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD) includes a specific indicator focused on this noise. This indicator is the yearly average sound level in third-octave bands with centre frequencies at 63 Hz and 125 Hz. These levels are described for Falmouth Bay, UK, an active port {{at the entrance to}} the English Channel. Underwater sound was recorded for 30 min h− 1 over the period June 2012 to November 2013 for a total of 435 days. Mean third-octave levels were louder in the 125 -Hz band (annual mean level of 96. 0 dB re 1 μPa) than in the 63 -Hz band (92. 6 dB re 1 μPa). These levels and variations are assessed as a function of seasons, shipping activity and wave height, providing comparison points for future monitoring activities, including the MSFD and emerging international regulation.

The aims of this project are to investigate connectivity among deep-sea populations at different depths and spatial scales using: 1) larval dispersal modelling using Lagrangian particle tracking, driven by hydrographic models, 2) population genetics/genomics, and 3) benthic community analysis. The aims of cruise JC 136 were then to sample a range of sites and depth bands to: 1. obtain physical samples of 4 model organisms for molecular analysis, 2. gather benthic biological survey data for community level analysis, 3. collect oceanographic data to validate high resolution oceanographic models with which we will model larval dispersal.

40|$|Hydrokinetic energy {{technologies}} {{have been proposed}} as renewable, environmentally preferable alternatives to fossil fuels for generation of electricity. Hydrokinetic technologies harness the energy of water in motion, either from waves, tides or from river currents. For energy capture from free-flowing rivers, arrays of rotating devices are most commonly proposed. The placement of hydrokinetic devices in large rivers {{is expected to increase}} the underwater structural complexity of river landscapes. Moore and Gregory (1988) found that structural complexity increased local fish populations because fish and other aquatic biota are attracted to structural complexity that provides microhabitats with steep flow velocity gradients (Liao 2007). However, hydrokinetic devices have mechanical parts, blades, wings or bars that move through the water column, posing a potential strike or collision risk to fish and other aquatic biota. Furthermore, in a setting with arrays of hydrokinetic turbines the cumulative effects of multiple encounters may increase the risk of strike. Submerged structures associated with a hydrokinetic (HK) project present a collision risk to aquatic organisms and diving birds (Cada et al. 2007). Collision is physical contact between a device or its pressure field and an organism that may result in an injury to that organism (Wilson et al. 2007). Collisions can occur between animals and fixed submerged structures, <b>mooring</b> <b>equipment,</b> horizontal or vertical axis turbine rotors, and structures that, by their individual design or in combination, may form traps. This report defines strike as a special case of collision where a moving part, such as a rotor blade of a HK turbine intercepts the path of an organism of interest, resulting in physical contact with the organism. The severity of a strike incidence may range from minor physical contact with no adverse effects to the organism to severe strike resulting in injury or death of the organism. Harmful effects to animal populations could occur directly (e. g., from strike mortality of individuals) or indirectly (e. g., if the loss of prey species to strike reduces food for predators). Although actively swimming or passively drifting animals may collide with any of the physical structures associated with hydrokinetic devices, turbine rotors are the most likely sources for risk of strike or significant collision (DOE 2009). It is also possible that during a close encounter with a HK device no physical contact will be made between the device and the organism, either because the animal avoids the device by successfully changing its direction of movement, or by successfully evading any moving parts of the device. Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) has been funded by the US Department of Energy (DOE) Waterpower Program to evaluate strike potential and consequences for Marine and Hydrokinetic (MHK) technologies in rivers and estuaries of the United States. We will use both predictive models and laboratory/field experiments to evaluate the likelihood and consequences of strike at HK projects in rivers. Efforts undertaken at ORNL address three objectives: (1) Assess strike risk for marine and freshwater organisms; (2) Develop experimental procedures to assess the risk and consequences of strike; and (3) Conduct strike studies in experimental flumes and field installations of hydrokinetic devices. During {{the first year of the}} study ORNL collected information from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) MHK database about geographical distribution of proposed hydrokinetic projects (what rivers or other types of systems), HK turbine design (horizontal axis, vertical axis, other), description of proposed axial turbine (number of blades, size of blades, rotation rate, mitigation measures), and number of units per project. Where site specific information was available, we compared the location of proposed projects rotors within the channel (e. g., along cutting edge bank, middle of thalweg, near bottom or in midwater) to the general locations of fish in the river (shoreline, bottom/midwater/surface of channel) to ascertain potential interactions. In addition, we are collaborating and communicating with scientists at other national laboratories and industry who are also developing information useful to this task. For example, other studies being funded by DOE include evaluations of different in-current (hydrokinetic) turbine designs for their effects on rates and severity of blade strike and likelihood of cavitation.
