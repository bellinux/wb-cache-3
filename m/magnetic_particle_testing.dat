The probe developed by the authors has a conspicuous feature of generating very little probe lift-off noise. The experimental results in the laboratory have indicated that so performed eddy current testing can pick-up longitudinal and transversal flaws in weld zones at a reasonable signal-to-noise ratio.

The micromethod allows isolation DNA using <b>magnetic</b> <b>particles</b> from crude lysates of cells obtained by direct homogenization of plant tissues. Various methods of processing homogenates were compared. Homogenization was performed by lysis buffer containing cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB).

40|$|In {{order to}} ensure the safe service of modern railway vehicles, safety {{critical}} components are subjected to a dedicated maintenance and inspection plan. Railways axles, in particular, are periodically inspected by the ultrasonic testing method during maintenance interruptions in first level workshops, while the <b>magnetic</b> <b>particles</b> <b>test</b> is carried out in second level workshops. The reliability of such inspections is quantified in terms of ‘‘Probability of Detection’’ curves, which are traditionally related to a specific linear dimension of the defect to be detected. Actually, a fatigue crack is known to change its shape under cyclic loading, so affecting its detectability. In the present paper, a novel approach to ‘‘Probability of Detection’’ takes into account of this effect, introducing a ‘‘Master’’ probability of detection curve, which {{is a function of}} the reflecting area of the crack. A comparative applicative example between standard and such advanced probabilities of detection curves is then presented considering high-speed railway applications, whose hollow axles are made of the medium strength EA 4 T steel grade...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{directed}} toward {{the question of whether}} recent advancements in radiation sources and test media offered significant improvements over {{the current state of the}} art. Included were experiments characterizing common penetrant and <b>magnetic</b> <b>particle</b> materials to determine their fluorescent excitation spectra, and a comparison between the fluorescent excitation spectra and the emission spectra of common excitation sources. The relationship between exciter and test medium directly controls the luminance of a defect indication. As indication luminance increases, the probability of it being detected by the inspector increases. Fluorescent penetrant and <b>magnetic</b> <b>particle</b> <b>test</b> media were originally designed around the widely available filtered medium pressure mercury vapor lamp, which remains the standard excitation radiation source. Test media properties, and the types of available excitation sources have changed with time, and it was unclear whether present-day media was still best excited by the historical standard ultraviolet radiation source. Predictions and experimental work was performed to determine the optimal excitation source for fluorescent nondestructive testing, and to determine which safety lens option would offer the highest probability of detection. Improvement in radiation sources was primarily judged by an increase in fluorophore luminance versus background, which led to an increase in signal-to-noise ratio facilitating better indication detectability.

50|$|NDT methods may {{rely upon}} use of {{electromagnetic}} radiation, sound, and inherent {{properties of materials}} to examine samples. This includes some kinds of microscopy to examine external surfaces in detail, although sample preparation techniques for metallography, optical microscopy and electron microscopy are generally destructive as the surfaces must be made smooth through polishing or the sample must be electron transparent in thickness. The inside of a sample can be examined with penetrating radiation, such as X-rays, neutrons or terahertz radiation. Sound waves are utilized {{in the case of}} ultrasonic testing. Contrast between a defect and the bulk of the sample may be enhanced for visual examination by the unaided eye by using liquids to penetrate fatigue cracks. One method (liquid penetrant testing) involves using dyes, fluorescent or non-fluorescent, in fluids for non-magnetic materials, usually metals. Another commonly used NDT method used on ferrous materials involves the application of fine iron particles (either liquid or dry dust) that are applied to a part while it is in an externally magnetized state (magnetic-particle testing). The particles will be attracted to leakage fields within the test object, and form on the objects surface. <b>Magnetic</b> <b>particle</b> <b>testing</b> can reveal surface & some sub-surface defects within the part.Thermoelectric effect (or use of the Seebeck effect) uses thermal properties of an alloy to quickly and easily characterize many alloys. The chemical test, or chemical spot test method, utilizes application of sensitive chemicals that can indicate the presence of individual alloying elements. Electrochemical methods, such as electrochemical fatigue crack sensors, utilize the tendency of metal structural material to oxidize readily in order to detect progressive damage.|$|E
40|$|International audienceBased on complex space discretized {{hysteresis}} {{model of}} the ferromagnetic materials (including both macroscopic and microscopic eddy currents contributions), a simplified magnetic lump model of a polymer matrix material filled with <b>magnetic</b> <b>particles</b> is proposed in this paper.

A quite simple consideration of the frequency magnetic hysteresis dependence in such flexible magnetic materials is established and consolidated by testing it on a new material the validity of the microscopic eddy currents model.

40|$|The {{isolation}} of DNA from plant tissue {{of the required}} quality is very complicated, especially {{because of the presence}} of substances that can interfere during amplification of DNA. These substances are mainly polyphenols, polysaccharides, proteins and various dyes. The chemical diversity of such materials can have a significant effect on the yield and quality of DNA using one isolation procedure. The main aim of the work was to evaluate the use of microisolation protocol for related matrices to the quality of the isolated DNA as well as the evaluation of the effect of inhibitors isolated with the nucleic acid to the amplification in the PCR.

Bridge element {{inspection}} is {{the first}} step to reach the general proper assessment about the condition of materials and deterioration grade.

A. In order to accomplish this purpose is important to determinate the appropriate test for concrete and steel members evaluation, based on results obtained, to distinguish materials and defects and finally give a diagnosis about the elements in study. The visual inspection work was possible through visits to the bridges to collect information about common concrete and steel defects while the physical one was the result of destructive and nondestructive test as core sampling, ultrasonic testing to verify the extent of defects on decks and <b>magnetic</b> <b>particle</b> <b>test</b> for weld analysis and thickness ultrasonic measurement for steel web beams. The general cracking orientation is longitudinal for concrete bridges and cross for steel bridges due to the unbraced length in each case because of flexion stress, the concrete strength got from cores was upper to the design strength and it was possible to measure some crack deeps in one of the decks.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} dynamic viscoelastic {{properties of}} magnetorheological (MR) grease under variation of magnetic fields and <b>magnetic</b> <b>particle</b> fractions. The <b>tests</b> {{to discern the}} field-dependent properties are undertaken using both rotational and oscillatory shear rheometers.
