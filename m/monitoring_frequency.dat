25|$|Clozapine was {{synthesized}} in 1958 by Wander AG, a Swiss pharmaceutical company, {{based on}} the chemical structure of the tricyclic antidepressant imipramine. The first test in humans in 1962 was considered a failure. Trials in Germany in 1965 and 1966 {{as well as a}} trial in Vienna in 1966 were successful. In 1967 Wander AG was acquired by Sandoz. Further trials took place in 1972 when clozapine was released in Switzerland and Austria as Leponex. Two years later it was released in West Germany, and Finland in 1975. Early testing was performed in the United States around the same time. In 1975, after reports of agranulocytosis leading to death in some clozapine-treated patients, clozapine was voluntarily withdrawn by the manufacturer. Clozapine fell out of favor {{for more than a decade}} despite unclear reasons for the agranulocytosis which occurred in Finland, the rate of which was 20 times higher than had been reported in any other country. However, when studies demonstrated that clozapine was more effective against treatment-resistant schizophrenia than other antipsychotics, the FDA and health authorities in most other countries approved its use only for treatment-resistant schizophrenia, and required Restricted Distribution, a Patient Registry and regular hematological monitoring to detect granulocytopenia, before agranulocytosis develops. In December 2002, clozapine was approved in the US for reducing the risk of suicide in schizophrenic or schizoaffective patients judged to be at chronic risk for suicidal behavior. In 2005 FDA approved criteria to allow reduced blood <b>monitoring</b> <b>frequency.</b>|$|E

Moving components such as pumps and agitators are monitored more frequently than non-moving components such as flanges and screwed connectors. The regulations require that when a leak is detected the component be repaired within a set amount of days. Most facilities get 5 days for an initial repair attempt with no more than 15 days for a complete repair. Allowances for delaying the repairs beyond the allowed time are made for some components where repairing the component requires shutting process equipment down.|$|E
50|$|Sandside Bay is a Site of Special Scientific Interest. It is {{recognised}} by surfers {{as being}} {{home to a}} powerful high quality left-hand reef break. This, however, is extremely fickle, and requires very particular wind, swell, and tide conditions to come into shape. The break is also notorious for being very rocky, shallow, and dangerous, such is the irregular form of the reef upon which the wave breaks. One of the main environmental issues caused by the Dounreay Nuclear Power Development Establishment are radioactive nuclear fuel particles that have been released from the site into the sea, and {{are now on the}} seabed near the plant and in Sandside Bay. Some of these are being washed ashore, including a small number on the privately owned Sandside Bay beach which {{is open to the public}} and is part of the 10000 acre Sandside Estate. The Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs committed to clean up and open oversight of the work on 25 October 2006. http://www.sandsideestate.com/pressRelease.asp?releaseId=537 The Dounreay Particles Advisory Group recommended that the particle <b>monitoring</b> <b>frequency</b> of the beach should be increased to fortnightly. http://www.neimagazine.com/story.asp?sectionCode=132&storyCode=2040484. The 13th Laird of Sandside the Duke of Portland took the Government to Court to assert his ownership down to the low watermark of the estate granted by a barony of 1628 and won. The 19th Laird of Sandside since 1991, Geoffrey Minter, following the radioactive contamination beginning in 1997, took the Government owned UKAEA to court in 2003 and won, beyond appeal, a judicial review in Scotland's highest court proving radioactive damage to the estate's land and the UKAEA to be in breach of its statutory duty under the Nuclear Installations Act. UKAEA's contractors now regularly monitor the beach due to a permanent agreement with the landowner.|$|E

INTRODUCTION When setting up land-use monitoring systems, spatial uncertainties {{and their impact on}} the detection of indicator changes are usually ignored. To capture a significant change in land-use indicators is thus strongly related to its spatial resolution, the velocities of the process it represents and the accuracy of the used indicators. As a consequence, the required monitoring land-use change frequency, corresponding to the mimimum time step to ensure a significant change in indicators, also depends on these three factors: indicator spatial resolution, change process velocity and spatial indicator accuracy...|$|E

Here we want to determine the satisfaction of well-controlled type 2 diabetes patients with either three-monthly or six-monthly diabetes monitoring and their future preference. Methods: Survey among 2215 well-controlled type 2 diabetes patients (not using insulin, HbA 1 c Results: Most patients (70. 8 %) would like to continue their <b>monitoring</b> <b>frequency.</b> Patients from the preference groups were more often satisfied than randomised patients (92. 7 % and 88. 1 %, respectively) and patients monitored three-monthly were more often satisfied than patients monitored six-monthly (93. 5 % and 88. 5 %, respectively).

40|$|Using {{remote sensing}} {{technology}} becomes an important method for monitoring the land-use practice in China. For pursuing economic benefits, the local governments often implement various development programs by using state land illegally, {{thus it is}} essential to identify these illegal cases in using proper techniques such as remote sensing technology. The identification of those illegal cases will help government to adopt necessary punishment measures. It is believed that sufficient punishment measures will bring down the number of cases in using land illegally.

40|$|Background: Adherence to {{treatment}} {{has been defined}} as {{the degree to which a}} patient’s behavior corresponds to medical or health advice; however, the most appropriate method to evaluate adherence to diabetes care has yet to be identified. We conducted analyses to compare adherence assessments and blood glucose monitoring measures with regard to their ability to predict glycemic control in adults with type 1 diabetes. Methods: We analyzed four instruments to evaluate adherence: Self-Care Inventory-Revised, a self-administered survey; Diabetes Self-Monitoring Profile (DSMP), administered by trained researchers; a categorical (yes/no/sometimes) adherence self-evaluation; and a continuous (0 – 100) adherence self-evaluation. Blood glucose <b>monitoring</b> <b>frequency</b> was evaluated by self-report, diary, and meter download. Results: Participants (n = 82) were aged 39. 0 ± 13. 1 years with a mean diabetes duration of 21. 2 ± 11. 1 years; 27 % monitored blood glucose > 4 times/day. The DSMP score was the strongest predictor of glycemic control (r = − 0. 32, P = 0. 004) among adherence assessments, while blood glucose <b>monitoring</b> <b>frequency</b> assessed by meter download was the strongest predictor among blood glucose monitoring measures (r = − 40, P < 0. 001). All the self-report assessments had a significant but weak correlation with glycemic control (r ≤ 0. 28, P ≤ 0. 02). The final adjusted model identified the assessment of blood glucose <b>monitoring</b> <b>frequency</b> by meter download as the most robust predictor of HbA 1 c (estimate effect size = − 0. 58, P = 0. 003).

Then, we discuss stability of firms’ pollution control strategy and derive the condition of inspiring firms to control pollution. Our findings indicate that firms tend to control pollution after long-term repeated games if government’s excitation level and <b>monitoring</b> <b>frequency</b> meet some conditions. Otherwise, firms tend to discharge pollution that exceeds the stipulated standards. As a result, in order to effectively control pollution, a government should adjust its excitation level and <b>monitoring</b> <b>frequency</b> reasonably...|$|E
