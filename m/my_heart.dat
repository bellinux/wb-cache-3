So the manuscript says, for verse 3 lines 4 & 5, [...] "O, my Lord, who are <b>my</b> <b>heart's</b> desire, hurry please." [...] But the conventional printings (such as ArtScroll) have it, [...] "My heart desired only these, so please have pity." ...|$|R

5|$|A {{few months}} ago I told the American people I did not trade arms for hostages. <b>My</b> <b>heart</b> and my best {{intentions}} still tell me that's true, but {{the facts and the}} evidence tell me it is not. As the Tower board reported, what began as a strategic opening to Iran deteriorated, in its implementation, into trading arms for hostages. This runs counter to my own beliefs, to administration policy, and to the original strategy we had in mind.|$|E

5|$|My Lords, I apologise to noble Lords {{for this}} {{dramatic}} last-minute but not opportunistic maiden speech. Although I inherited my title 30 {{years ago and}} have attended spasmodically, particularly during the early 1970s when we rigorously debated the Industrial Relations Bill and the European Community Bill of Accession, both in Committee and on Report until extremely late at night, <b>my</b> <b>heart</b> has not entirely been in the thrust and cut of politics, unlike my more distinguished ancestors.|$|E
5|$|<b>My</b> <b>heart</b> {{goes out}} to the {{families}} of those lost in the Challenger disaster.

The songwriters included the audio in tribute to the unselfish work of the Challenger crew with hope that they will never be forgotten.|$|E

5|$|So much {{controversy}} has swirled around my career this past decade that very little attention ever gets paid to my music. The songs {{are all but}} forgotten.

So without a lot of fanfare, without any distractions, I present to you this collection of ballads. Some are old, some are new. All of them are from <b>my</b> <b>heart.</b>|$|E

5|$|Sometime I {{have thought}} that {{impossible}} it had been, so to have removed my affection {{from the realm of}} Scotland, that any realm or nation could have been equal dear to me.

5|$|Stax {{released}} Redding's debut album, Pain in <b>My</b> <b>Heart,</b> {{two years}} later. Initially popular mainly with African-Americans, Redding later reached a wider American pop music audience. Along with his group, he first played small gigs in the American South. He later {{performed at the}} popular Los Angeles night club Whisky a Go Go and toured Europe, performing in London, Paris and other major cities. He also performed at the Monterey Pop Festival in 1967.|$|E
