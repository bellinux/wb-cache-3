5|$|During the 1980s, NSB started leasing SJ T44-locomotives from Sweden to {{supplement}} the Di 3. In 1992, the decision was <b>made</b> <b>to</b> <b>order</b> 12 Di 6 and 20 Di 8 to replace the Di 3. The former {{was based on the}} Di 4 and had twice the power of the Di 3. The Di 8 was slightly more powerful than the Di 3, and were intended for freight trains. Both series were put into service in 1996, but the Di 6 proved to have so many technical problems that they were returned to Siemens in 1998. The Di 3 units had been set aside and some had been scrapped, but the return of the Di 6 forced NSB to put the units back into service.|$|E
5|$|Potter biographer Linda Lear {{notes that}} none of the rabbit books {{subsequent}} to Peter Rabbit appealed to Potter with the passion she experienced for the original, but, in Benjamin Bunny, she successfully wrote a simple, didactic tale for very young children that was less complicated than The Tale of Squirrel Nutkin and The Tailor of Gloucester. Benjamin Bunny however lacked the vitality of her previous efforts because it was <b>made</b> <b>to</b> <b>order</b> rather than allowed to flower from a picture letter to real children in the manner of Peter Rabbit and Squirrel Nutkin. The weak story line of Benjamin Bunny is evidence of her dwindling interest in continuing the Peter Rabbit saga, but the book displays a delight in place, a deep understanding of rabbit anatomy and behaviour, and beautifully miniaturized illustrations of vegetable gardens. Benjamin Bunny presented demands upon Potter she had not encountered in her previous three tales. She had depleted all her sketchbook backgrounds in the production of the other tales and was forced to create new ones, but the greatest challenge to Potter's artistry was consciously working to satisfy both her publisher's demand for another commercial success and her public's expectation of a tale as delightful as her others while labouring under the pressure to produce a sequel to a work of genius.|$|E

25|$|In the {{immediate}} aftermath of the explosion, Falk was forced to outsource some parts of the production process to other manufacturers, and are continuing to send regular updates of work in progress to customers, including emailing pictures of the products, which are <b>made</b> <b>to</b> <b>order,</b> as they are built. A fund was set up for victims of the explosion. Rexnord made an initial donation of $100,000; by December 2006, the fund had topped $325,000. A separate fund was also set up for the young children of one of the deceased. The company had started to ship finished products again by December 20. By January 10, all 750 Falk Corporation employees had returned to work. The company intends to rebuild on the site. The explosion has, to date, cost Rexnord over $40 million in damage and lost sales. The company is insured for up to $2billion per incident. When Christmas came, the Salvation Army donated toys to Falk employees for their children, to help with the cost of Christmas at a time when the families were still very distressed. Milwaukee's state representative, Pedro Colón, has said that there were no laws in Wisconsin requiring the inspection of propane tanks, and is now pushing for adoption of such laws. In October 2008, the lawsuit went to trial in Milwaukee. After four weeks of trial, Rexnord was found to be primarily at fault for the explosion and J.M. Brennan was not liable for any of the damages.|$|E

500|$|The {{company was}} {{acquired}} by Pascal Raffy, its current president, on February 6, 2001. [...] In June 2006, Mr. Raffy purchased several manufacturing structures, such as the STT group, which produced complicated watch movements, {{in order to obtain}} complete control over the quality of all phases of the watch crafting process. STT was renamed Dimier 1738 Manufacture de Haute Horlogerie Artisanale and went into a full restructuring {{over the next two years}} in order to bring the standards up to those of Bovet. The second purchase was a dial and precious gem setting manufacture located in Plan-les-Ouates in Geneva. The name was changed also from Valor, Lopez, et Villa to Dimier 1738 Manufacture Artisanale de Cadrans et de Sertissages. With the same philosophy as the movement factory, Mr. Raffy turned this factory into an artisan center providing dials for Bovet, Dimier's watch brand, and a select group of clients in luxury watchmaking. There are currently about 150 employees of Bovet Fleurier SA and the Dimier manufactures, and the company only produces under 2,000 watches a year. [...] Some modern Bovet watches are fitted with mechanisms manufactured by Vaucher Manufacture, a company that also supplied watches to the Chinese market in the 19th century. [...] Bovet spends very little to advertise and prefers to have private salons for clients instead of attending public fairs.

The company gave {{up trying to}} retail its models and set up a branch company called X-El Products to sell reissued promos. The X-El reissues have {{sometimes}} been passed off as originals in antique malls and flea markets. The X-El Products era was an ironic time.
