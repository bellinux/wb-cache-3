25|$|Chemotherapy is {{teratogenic}} during pregnancy, {{especially during}} the first trimester, {{to the extent that}} abortion usually is recommended if pregnancy in this period is found during chemotherapy. Second- and third-trimester exposure does not usually increase the teratogenic risk and adverse effects on cognitive development, but it may increase the risk of various complications of pregnancy and fetal <b>myelosuppression.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{very severe}} <b>myelosuppression,</b> which occurs in some regimens, {{almost all the}} bone marrow stem cells (cells that produce white and red blood cells) are destroyed, meaning {{allogenic}} or autologous bone marrow cell transplants are necessary. (In autologous BMTs, cells are removed from the patient before the treatment, multiplied and then re-injected afterward; in allogenic BMTs, the source is a donor.) However, some patients still develop diseases because of this interference with bone marrow.|$|E
25|$|Alemtuzumab (Campeth-1H) is an anti-CD52 humanized IgG1 {{monoclonal}} antibody indicated {{for the treatment}} of fludarabine-refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, peripheral T-cell lymphoma and T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia. CD52 is found on >95% of peripheral blood lymphocytes (both T-cells and B-cells) and monocytes, but its function in lymphocytes is unknown. It binds to CD52 and initiates its cytotoxic effect by complement fixation and ADCC mechanisms. Due to the antibody target (cells of the immune system) common complications of alemtuzumab therapy are infection, toxicity and <b>myelosuppression.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{exploration}} of the antiangiogenic and immunomodulatory activities of thalidomide {{has led to the}} study and creation of thalidomide analogs. Celgene has sponsored numerous clinical trials with analogues to thalidomide, such as lenalidomide, that are substantially more powerful and have fewer side effects— except for greater <b>myelosuppression.</b> In 2005, Celgene received FDA approval for lenalidomide (Revlimid) as the first commercially useful derivative. Revlimid is available only in a restricted distribution setting to avoid its use during pregnancy. Further studies are being conducted to find safer compounds with useful qualities. Another more potent analog, pomalidomide, is now FDA approved. Additionally, apremilast was approved by the FDA in March 2014. These thalidomide analogs can be used to treat different diseases, or used in a regimen to fight two conditions.|$|E
25|$|Traditional {{chemotherapeutic}} {{agents are}} cytotoxic {{by means of}} interfering with cell division (mitosis) but cancer cells vary widely in their susceptibility to these agents. To a large extent, chemotherapy {{can be thought of}} as a way to damage or stress cells, which may then lead to cell death if apoptosis is initiated. Many of the side effects of chemotherapy can be traced to damage to normal cells that divide rapidly and are thus sensitive to anti-mitotic drugs: cells in the bone marrow, digestive tract and hair follicles. This results in the most common side-effects of chemotherapy: <b>myelosuppression</b> (decreased production of blood cells, hence also immunosuppression), mucositis (inflammation of the lining of the digestive tract), and alopecia (hair loss). Because of the effect on immune cells (especially lymphocytes), chemotherapy drugs often find use in a host of diseases that result from harmful overactivity of the immune system against self (so-called autoimmunity). These include rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, multiple sclerosis, vasculitis and many others.|$|E
25|$|The enzyme thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT) is {{responsible}} for various activation and deactivation steps in azathioprine's mechanism of action. The first metabolic step that azathioprine undergoes in the body is the conversion to 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP; see Pharmacokinetics), which is itself an immunosuppressant prodrug. The TPMT enzyme {{is responsible}}, in part, for the methylation of 6-MP into the inactive metabolite 6-methylmercaptopurine - this methylation prevents 6-MP from further conversion into active, cytotoxic thioguanine nucleotide (TGN) metabolites. Certain genetic variations within the TPMT gene can lead to decreased or absent TPMT enzyme activity, and individuals who are homozygous or heterozygous for these types of genetic variations may have increased levels of TGN metabolites and {{an increased risk of}} severe bone marrow suppression (<b>myelosuppression)</b> when receiving azathioprine. In many ethnicities, TPMT polymorphisms that result in decreased or absent TPMT activity occur with a frequency of approximately 5%, meaning that about 0.25% of patients are homozygous for these variants. However, an assay of TPMT activity in red blood cells or a TPMT genetic test can identify patients with reduced TPMT activity, allowing for the adjustment of azathioprine dose or avoidance of the drug entirely. The FDA-approved drug label for azathioprine recommends testing for TPMT activity to identify patients at risk for myelotoxicity. Indeed, testing for TPMT activity is currently one of the few examples of pharmacogenetics being translated into routine clinical care. Missense SNP in NUDT15 (e.g., rs116855232, inducing R139C)) has been identified to be a causal factor for AZA-induced leukopenia through a genome wide association study (GWAS) in East Asians.|$|E
500|$|All FAB subtypes except M3 {{are usually}} given {{induction}} chemotherapy with cytarabine (ara-C) and an anthracycline (most often daunorubicin). This induction chemotherapy regimen {{is known as}} [...] "7+3" [...] (or [...] "3+7"), because the cytarabine is given as a continuous IV infusion for seven consecutive days while the anthracycline is given for three consecutive days as an IV push. Up to 70% of people with AML will achieve a remission with this protocol. Other alternative induction regimens, including high-dose cytarabine alone, FLAG-like regimens or investigational agents, may also be used. Because of the toxic effects of therapy, including <b>myelosuppression</b> and {{an increased risk of}} infection, induction chemotherapy may not be offered to the very elderly, and the options may include less intense chemotherapy or palliative care.|$|E
2500|$|Thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) catalyzes the S-methylation of thiopurines, thereby {{regulating}} {{the balance between}} cytotoxic thioguanine nucleotide and inactive metabolites in hematopoietic cells. [...] TPMT is highly involved in 6-MP metabolism and TMPT activity and TPMT genotype is known to affect the risk of toxicity. Excessive levels of 6-MP can cause <b>myelosuppression</b> and myelotoxicity.|$|E
2500|$|Bortezomib is {{associated}} with peripheral neuropathy in 30% of patients; occasionally, it can be painful. [...] This can be worse in patients with pre-existing neuropathy. In addition, <b>myelosuppression</b> causing neutropenia and thrombocytopenia can also occur and be dose-limiting. However, these side effects are usually mild relative to bone marrow transplantation and other treatment options for patients with advanced disease. Bortezomib {{is associated}} with a high rate of shingles, although prophylactic acyclovir can reduce the risk of this.|$|E
2500|$|The main {{drawback}} of carboplatin is its myelosuppressive effect. This {{causes the}} blood cell and platelet output of bone marrow {{in the body}} to decrease quite dramatically, sometimes as low as 10% of its usual production levels. [...] The nadir of this <b>myelosuppression</b> usually occurs 21–28 days after the first treatment, after which the blood cell and platelet levels in the blood begin to stabilize, often coming close to its pre-carboplatin levels. This decrease in white blood cells (neutropenia) can cause complications, and is sometimes treated with drugs like filgrastim. The most notable complication of neutropenia is increased probability of infection by opportunistic organisms, which necessitates hospital readmission and treatment with antibiotics.|$|E

50|$|Unlike other {{nitrogen}} mustards, estramustine phosphate seldom produces significant gastrointestinal or hematologic toxicity such as <b>myelosuppression,</b> {{the major}} drug toxicity-related cause of drug discontinuation is thromboembolism (blood clots).|$|E
50|$|Other {{potential}} {{side effects}} are thrombosis, pulmonary embolus, and hepatotoxicity, {{as well as}} bone marrow toxicity resulting in neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. <b>Myelosuppression</b> is the major dose-limiting toxicity, which is contrary to experience with thalidomide.|$|E
5000|$|A 2009 review noted [...] "Deep venous {{thrombosis}} and pulmonary embolism {{are the major}} side effects ofthalidomide and lenalidomide. Lenalidomide causes more <b>myelosuppression,</b> and thalidomide causes more sedation. Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy and thrombocytopenia are major side effects of bortezomib." ...|$|E
50|$|The major {{side effects}} of tegafur are similar to {{fluorouracil}} and include <b>myelosuppression,</b> central neurotoxicity and gastrointestinal toxicity (especially diarrhoea). Gastrointestinal toxicity is the dose-limiting side effect of tegafur. Central neurotoxicity is more common with tegafur than with fluorouracil.|$|E
50|$|Like {{many other}} {{cytotoxic}} drugs, it can often cause alopecia, headache, muscle pain, joint pain, nausea and vomiting, <b>myelosuppression</b> with leukopenia (especially neutropenia), lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia and immunosuppression. At therapeutic doses, those side effects are usually relatively milder compared with carmustine and lomustine.|$|E

50|$|The main major {{side effect}} of ThioTEPA is <b>myelosuppression</b> (bone marrow depression), {{which is the most}} serious {{complication}} of excessive therapy, causing leukopenia, thrombocytopenia and anemia. Serious toxicity involving the hematologic, hepatic and respiratory system were considered as expected consequences of the conditioning regimen and transplant process.|$|E
50|$|Common {{side effects}} of {{administration}} included shivering, fever, nausea and vomiting. Serious side effects included severe <b>myelosuppression</b> (suppressed activity of bone marrow, which is involved in formation of various blood cells in 98% of patients), disorder of the respiratory system, tumor lysis syndrome, Type III hypersensitivity, venous occlusion, and death.|$|E

50|$|Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX, Bactrim) is {{generally}} considered first-line therapy for PCP or toxoplasmosis. However, atovaquone {{may be used in}} patients who cannot tolerate, or are allergic to, sulfonamide medications such as TMP-SMX. In addition, atovaquone has the advantage of not causing <b>myelosuppression,</b> which is an important issue in patients who have undergone bone marrow transplantation.|$|E
50|$|Chemotherapy is {{teratogenic}} during pregnancy, {{especially during}} the first trimester, {{to the extent that}} abortion usually is recommended if pregnancy in this period is found during chemotherapy.

50|$|TPMT is {{best known}} for its role in the {{metabolism}} of the thiopurine drugs such as azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine and 6-thioguanine. TPMT catalyzes the S-methylation of thiopurine drugs. Defects in the TPMT gene leads to decreased methylation and decreased inactivation of 6MP leading to enhanced bone marrow toxicity which may cause <b>myelosuppression,</b> anemia, bleeding tendency, leukopenia & infection.|$|E
50|$|Bone marrow {{suppression}} {{also known}} as myelotoxicity or <b>myelosuppression,</b> is the decrease in production of cells responsible for providing immunity (leukocytes), carrying oxygen (erythrocytes), and/or those responsible for normal blood clotting (thrombocytes). Bone marrow suppression is a serious side effect of chemotherapy and certain drugs affecting the immune system such as azathioprine. The risk is especially high in cytotoxic chemotherapy for leukemia.|$|E
50|$|Anthracyclines are a {{class of}} drugs that {{are among the most}} {{commonly}} used agents in the treatment of cancer. Doxorubicin, the first anthracycline to gain approval, has demonstrated efficacy {{in a wide variety of}} cancers including breast cancer, lung cancer, sarcomas, and lymphomas. However, doxorubicin is associated with side effects such as <b>myelosuppression,</b> gastrointestinal disorders, mucositis, stomatitis, cumulative cardiotoxicity and extravasation.|$|E
50|$|Low blood counts, or <b>myelosuppression,</b> occur about 50% of {{the time}} with ABVD. Blood cell growth factors are {{sometimes}} used to prevent this (see Supportive care below). Blood counts are checked frequently while receiving chemotherapy. Any fever or sign of infection that develops needs to be promptly evaluated; severe infections can develop rapidly in {{a person with a}} low white blood cell count due to chemotherapy.|$|E
50|$|These anticancer drugs have, however, some {{limitations}} due to side effects, principally <b>myelosuppression</b> and neurotoxicity. But the main inconvenience {{is that many}} cancers are, or become, resistant to these drugs. Several strategies have been proposed {{for the development of}} more effective and less toxic anticancer drugs. One of them is to use molecules that can induce the stabilization of microtubules, and Pyr1 is one of them.|$|E
50|$|Nonsteroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} drugs (NSAIDs), in some rare instances, {{may also}} cause bone marrow suppression. The decrease in blood cell counts {{does not occur}} right {{at the start of}} chemotherapy because the drugs do not destroy the cells already in the bloodstream (these are not dividing rapidly). Instead, the drugs affect new blood cells that are being made by the bone marrow. When <b>myelosuppression</b> is severe, it is called myeloablation.|$|E
50|$|Chemotherapy {{can cause}} <b>myelosuppression</b> and unacceptably {{low levels of}} white blood cells (neutropenia), making {{patients}} susceptible to infections and sepsis. G-CSF stimulates the production of granulocytes, a type of white blood cell. In oncology and hematology, a recombinant form of G-CSF is used with certain cancer patients to accelerate recovery and reduce mortality from neutropenia after chemotherapy, allowing higher-intensity treatment regimens. It is administered to oncology patients via subcutaneous or intravenous routes.|$|E
50|$|In {{very severe}} <b>myelosuppression,</b> which occurs in some regimens, {{almost all the}} bone marrow stem cells (cells that produce white and red blood cells) are destroyed, meaning {{allogenic}} or autologous bone marrow cell transplants are necessary.

50|$|For {{therapeutic}} usage, thioTEPA {{is given}} in 30 mg doses intravesically weekly for four to six weeks. Many studies have reported a success rate of up to 55 percent. Main toxicity of intravesical therapy is due to systemic absorption causing <b>myelosuppression,</b> which results in thrombocytopenia and leukopenia.The use of thioTEPA has been extended for ovarian cancer, breast cancer, Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphomas, and to help control the accumulation of fluid in body cavities that may result from certain cancers.|$|E
