25|$|Private bundles may be sent with unicast or {{multicast}} addressing. Bundle numbers 65280–65535 {{are reserved}} for private bundles. Private bundle numbers are paired with the <b>MAC</b> <b>address</b> of the device that transmits them. To receive a private bundle, both the bundle number and the <b>MAC</b> <b>address</b> of the transmitter must be specified. Because 256 private bundles available to each transmitter, there is no limit on the total number private bundles on a network.|$|E
25|$|Because {{the meaning}} of amateur {{transmissions}} may not be obscured, security measures that are implemented must be published. This does not necessarily restrict authentication or login schemes, but it does restrict fully encrypted communications. This leaves the communications vulnerable to various attacks once the authentication has been completed. This makes {{it very difficult to}} keep unauthorized users from accessing HSMM networks, although casual eavesdroppers can effectively be deterred. Current schemes include using <b>MAC</b> <b>address</b> filtering, WEP and WPA/WPA2. <b>MAC</b> <b>address</b> filtering and WEP are all hackable by using freely available software from the Internet, making them the less secure options. Per FCC rules the encryption keys themselves must be published in a publicly accessible place if using WEP, WPA/WPA2 or any other encryption, thereby undermining the security of their implementation. Such measures however are effective against casual or accidental wireless intrusions.|$|E

Users can {{make use of the}} new [...] "Network Center" [...] to see the status of their network connections, and to access every aspect of configuration. The network can be browsed using Network Explorer, which replaces Windows XP's [...] "My Network Places". Network Explorer items can be a shared device such as a scanner, or a file share. Network Location Awareness uniquely identifies each network and exposes the network's attributes and connectivity type. Windows Vista graphically presents how different devices are connected over a network in the Network Map view, using the LLTD protocol. In addition, the Network Map uses LLTD to determine connectivity information and media type (wired or wireless). Any device can implement LLTD to appear on the Network Map with an icon representing the device, allowing users one-click access to the device's {{user interface}}. When LLTD is invoked, it provides metadata about the device that contains static or state information, such as the <b>MAC</b> <b>address,</b> IPv4/IPv6 address, signal strength etc.|$|E

50|$|MAC {{spoofing}} is {{a technique}} for changing a factory-assigned Media Access Control (<b>MAC)</b> <b>address</b> of a network interface on a networked device. The <b>MAC</b> <b>address</b> that is hard-coded on a network interface controller (NIC) cannot be changed. However, many drivers allow the <b>MAC</b> <b>address</b> to be changed. Additionally, there are tools which can make an operating system believe that the NIC has the <b>MAC</b> <b>address</b> of a user's choosing. The process of masking a <b>MAC</b> <b>address</b> is known as MAC spoofing. Essentially, MAC spoofing entails changing a computer's identity, for any reason, and it is relatively easy.|$|E

The BSSID is the formal name of the BSS and is always associated with only one BSS.

50|$|Content-addressable {{memory is}} often used in {{computer}} networking devices. For example, when a network switch receives a data frame from one of its ports, it updates an internal table with the frame's source <b>MAC</b> <b>address</b> and the port it was received on. It then looks up the destination <b>MAC</b> <b>address</b> in the table to determine what port the frame needs to be forwarded to, and sends it out on that port. The <b>MAC</b> <b>address</b> table is usually implemented with a binary CAM so the destination port can be found very quickly, reducing the switch's latency.|$|E
50|$|When an Internet Protocol (IP) {{datagram}} is {{sent from}} one host {{to another in}} a local area network, the destination IP address must be resolved to a <b>MAC</b> <b>address</b> for transmission via the data link layer.
