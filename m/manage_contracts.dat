40|$|Abstract- Contracting is an {{integral}} part of construction projects. <b>Managing</b> the <b>contracts</b> therefore is equally important for the success of any business process due to rapid increase in multiple contracts. The conventional method of <b>managing</b> <b>contract</b> involves risks and chaos which include inadequate information in contracts, inadequate delegation of authority and responsibility, fraud, theft, corruption, other unethical activities, communication gap, delayed financial decisions thus dampening the progress of the project, all due to manual intervention in <b>managing</b> <b>contracts.</b> This calls for a need of systematic and an effective method of contract management. This paper speaks about Intelligent Contract Management (automated contract management) which is an efficient, transparent and flawless concept of <b>managing</b> <b>contracts.</b> This technique will streamline the business process by reducing the time taken to create, review, execute and approv...|$|R

The research proposes alternative approaches for improving the DoD's ability to <b>manage</b> <b>contract</b> termination liability and discusses the resulting effect of each alternative on defense acquisition practices.

Next, we present program management challenges and preliminary observations and findings based on our research of current contract termination liability policies and real-world practices. A discussion of alternative approaches to funding contract termination liability is then presented, including the use of Special Termination Cost Clauses (STCC). Finally, this research concludes with a summary and recommendations on how the DoD can improve the policies and practices for <b>managing</b> <b>contract</b> termination liability...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: An {{important}} decision confronting public managers is choosing when to contract for service delivery. We focus on two service characteristics that transaction cost theory suggests {{may influence the}} chances of contract success. Asset specificity {{is the extent to}} which resources applied to delivering a service can be applied to other services and ease of measurement {{is the extent to which}} the quality and quantity of service outcomes and outputs can be easily gauged. Drawing on a survey of public managers ’ perceptions of these dimensions for sixty-four common municipal services, we review previous studies of contracting to investigate how these two transaction costs factors influence governments’ decisions about whether to contract, how to <b>manage</b> <b>contracts,</b> and when contracting is likely to be successful. Our survey and review sheds light on how public managers should manage contracting and how scholars should further investigate this important subject...|$|E
40|$|Designing and {{implementing}} performance measurement systems in public contracts {{is not an}} easy task. Little guidance has been available on which specific measures work better in producing certain managerial benefits. The objective {{of this study is to}} evaluate the effect of different performance measurement practices on accountability effectiveness in government contracts. The findings suggest that the overall scope of performance measurement has a positive impact on the government’s ability to effectively <b>manage</b> <b>contracts.</b> More specifically, measuring costs, client impact, service timeliness and disruptions, as well as specifying the detailed processes for service delivery are associated with higher accountability effectiveness. On the other hand, evaluating quality, client satisfaction, and using informal monitoring techniques has a negative impact on perceived accountability effectiveness. The results of this study provide motivation for the contract managers to optimize performance monitoring and reduce transaction costs by relying on the measures that are more likely to improve contract implementation...|$|E
