The best {{study for}} such a day--or the best amusement: {{call it what you}} will--is a book of travels {{describing}} scenes the most unlike that sombre one which is mistily presented through the windows. I have experienced that Fancy is then most successful in imparting distinct shapes and vivid colors to the objects which the author has spread upon his page, and that his words become magic spells to summon up a thousand varied pictures. Strange landscapes glimmer through the familiar walls of the room, and outlandish figures thrust themselves almost within the sacred precincts of the hearth. Small as my chamber is, it has space enough to contain the ocean-like circumference of an Arabian desert, its parched sands tracked by the long line of a caravan with the camels patiently journeying through the heavy sunshine.

True it is, however, that amid the bustle of traffic, or whatever else may seem to be going on around me, the raindrops will occasionally be heard to patter against my window-panes, which look forth upon one of the quietest streets in a New England town. After a time, too, the visions vanish, and will not appear again at my bidding. Then, it being nightfall, a gloomy sense of unreality depresses my spirits, and impels me to venture out before the clock shall strike bedtime to satisfy myself that the world is not entirely made up of such shadowy materials as have busied me throughout the day.

30|$|It is {{well known}} that {{envelope}} gravity waves {{play an important role in}} atmospheric dynamics [1 – 5], the troposphere is excited by convection, topography and other excitation processes to transfer energy and momentum from the source (e.g., mountains, thermal forcing) to the <b>middle</b> and upper <b>atmosphere</b> [6 – 9]. Atmospheric parameters, such as density and temperature, oscillate with fluctuations due to the influence of envelope gravity waves at the <b>middle</b> and upper <b>atmosphere.</b> In addition, the atmosphere is further achieved through the wave process of envelope gravity waves in actual atmospheric movement.

30|$|Energy and {{momentum}} transport by internal atmospheric waves {{is an important}} factor of dynamical interactions between the lower and upper atmosphere and a substantial contributor to space weather developments (Kelley 1997). It is important for the numerical modeling of the general circulation and thermal regime of the <b>middle</b> and upper <b>atmosphere</b> to account for accelerations of the mean flow and heating rates produced by dissipating internal waves (Holton 1975). One of the major sources of mesoscale atmospheric waves is the Earth’s topography (Gossard and Hooke 1975). Generation of orographic gravity waves (OGWs) at the surface and their propagation into the <b>middle</b> and upper <b>atmosphere</b> significantly affect the atmospheric general circulation as well as the amplitudes and other parameters of planetary waves in these regions.

Depending on the requirements, purely physical models, semi-empirical or empirical models are considered to be the most appropriate. This review focuses on the interaction of solar wind disturbances with geospace. We cover interplanetary space, the Earth's magnetosphere (with the exception of radiation belt physics), the ionosphere (with the exception of radio science), the neutral atmosphere and the ground (via electromagnetic induction fields). Space weather relevant state-of-the-art physical and semi-empirical models of the various regions are reviewed. They include models for interplanetary space, its quiet state and the evolution of recurrent and transient solar perturbations (corotating interaction regions, coronal mass ejections, their interplanetary remnants, and solar energetic particle fluxes). Models of coupled large-scale solar wind-magnetosphere-ionosphere processes (global magnetohydrodynamic descriptions) and of inner magnetosphere processes (ring current dynamics) are discussed. Achievements in modeling the coupling between magnetospheric processes and the neutral and ionized upper and <b>middle</b> <b>atmospheres</b> are described.
