5|$|Judy Taylor, {{author of}} several books about Potter and her works, observes that Potter had {{difficulty}} drawing the human form, and, {{as a result of her}} limitations, restricted depictions of Mr. McGregor in The Flopsy Bunnies to his hands and feet. Any awkwardness in their depictions was minimized by presenting his hands and feet in isolation and from the bunnies' point of view. In the few full-length illustrations of Mr. McGregor, the need to depict his face was eliminated by presenting him in the <b>middle</b> <b>or</b> far distance and from the rear.|$|E
5|$|Schizophrenia affects around 0.3–0.7% {{of people}} {{at some point in}} their life, or 24million people {{worldwide}} as of 2011. It occurs 1.4times more frequently in males than females and typically appears earlier in men—the peak ages of onset are 25 years for males and 27 years for females. Onset in childhood is much rarer, as is onset in <b>middle</b> <b>or</b> old age.|$|E

5|$|The <b>Middle</b> <b>or</b> East Plains Trail {{also came}} into common {{use in the}} 1840s. Shorter than the {{competing}} West Plain Trail, it became {{the route of the}} large cart trains originating from Pembina when well-known trader Henry Sibley retired from the fur trade in 1854. His successor and former partner Norman Kittson moved their company's cart trains from the West Plains Trail in the Minnesota River valley to the East Plains route.|$|E
5|$|This supreme, states Kaivalya Upanishad, is the eternal, the all-pervading, formless, unmanifest, infinite, inconceivable, {{one without}} {{beginning}} or <b>middle</b> <b>or</b> end, {{one which is}} chidananda ("consciousness-bliss"). He is, states the Upanishad, Brahman, Shiva, Indra, Vishnu, Prana (life force, breath), fire and moon (time, lunar calendar). Eternity is him, states the text, all that originated is him, all that originates is him. Know him, find liberation, {{there is no other}} way, states verse 9.|$|E
5|$|Changes in {{government}} may occur during the campaign, for example {{as a consequence}} of a rise in republicanism. The United States may only come into existence if the ruling British Empire is unable to maintain social order. In addition, nations with highly unpopular governments and a history of workers' unrest may experience revolutions similar to the French Revolution. When the <b>middle</b> <b>or</b> upper classes become disenchanted with a current government, a civil war or revolt may occur. Upon revolution, the player can choose to side with the rebels or with the loyalists. The type of government selected by the player will determine how other factions view the player and influence their diplomatic relations. While religion no longer plays a central role (as in Medieval II: Total War), it is still important in helping bring under control newly captured regions and in influencing diplomatic relations between nations.|$|E

5|$|In {{terms of}} social class the average American may be {{referred}} to as being either a member of the <b>middle</b> <b>or</b> working class. The discrepancy is largely the result of differing class models and definitions of what constitutes a member of the middle class. Currently the vast majority of Americans self-identify as middle class, yet some experts in the field such Michael Zweig of Stony Brook University or Dennis Gilbert of Cornell University have brought forth different theories. As most Americans are neither professionals nor managers and lack college degrees the average American may be described as being either or both, lower middle and working class.|$|E
5|$|Kronan {{was one of}} {{the most}} heavily armed {{warships}} in the world in 1672 when she was launched, a three-decker with 110 guns. The ship had three full gundecks with guns from bow to stern. Altogether there were seven separate levels, divided by six decks. Furthest down in the ship, above the keel, was the hold, and immediately above it, but still below the waterline, lay the orlop; both were used primarily for storage. Above the orlop were the three gundecks, two of them covered, while about half of the topmost gundeck was open to the elements in the ship's <b>middle,</b> <b>or</b> waist. The bow had one deck, making up the forecastle, and the stern had two decks, including a poop deck.|$|E
5|$|Players {{can choose}} from a cast of 20 playable drivers divided in 10 pairs. All of the {{characters}} have their own special items which are unique to them, like Mario and Luigi with Fireballs, Donkey Kong and Diddy Kong with Giant Bananas, Bowser and Bowser Jr. with Bowser Shells, Yoshi and Birdo with Eggs, Peach and Daisy with Hearts, Wario and Waluigi with Bob-ombs, Koopa Troopa (who previously appeared in Super Mario Kart) and Paratroopa with Triple Shells, Toad and Toadette with Golden Mushrooms, and Baby Mario and Baby Luigi with Chain Chomps. Petey Piranha and King Boo have the unique ability to use {{any of the other}} characters' special items excluding Luigi's Green Fireball and Birdo's Pink Egg. There are 21 karts in all and the character's weight class (light, <b>middle,</b> <b>or</b> heavy) determines the kart in which they can ride as well as their speed, acceleration, and weight attributes.|$|E

5|$|The middle Miocene {{marked the}} spread of the bovids into China and the Indian subcontinent. According to Vrba, the {{radiation}} of the subfamily Alcelaphinae began {{in the latter part of}} middle Miocene. The Caprinae tribes probably diverged in the early middle Miocene. The Caprini emerged in the middle Miocene, and seem to have been replaced by other bovids and cervids in Eurasia. The earliest fossils of the antilopines are from the middle Miocene, though studies show the existence of the subfamily from the early Miocene. Speciation occurred in the tribe Antilopini during the <b>middle</b> <b>or</b> upper Miocene, mainly in Eurasia. Tribe Neotragini seems to have appeared in Africa by the end of Miocene, and had become widespread by the Pliocene.|$|E
5|$|Until the <b>middle</b> <b>or</b> {{the end of}} the 1700s, much of the Buffalo Creek {{watershed}} was on the frontier. During this time, {{there were}} many forts, such as Fort Titzell in the watershed. In 1769, the northern side of Buffalo Creek was surveyed. In the same year, the area {{in the vicinity of the}} creek was opened to settlers. John Sierer was among the first to arrive, settling on the creek in 1769. The prominent Revolutionary War veteran Colonel John Kelly built an estate on the northern bank of Buffalo Creek. In 1780, there was an Indian attack near the mouth of the creek.|$|E

5|$|Because of the {{structure}} of the SYNOP code, a maximum of three cloud symbols can be plotted for each reporting station that appears on the weather map. All cloud types are coded and transmitted by trained observers then plotted on maps as low, <b>middle,</b> <b>or</b> high-étage using special symbols for each major cloud type. Any cloud type with significant vertical extent that can occupy more than one étage is coded as low (cumulus and cumulonimbus) or middle (nimbostratus) depending on the altitude level or étage where it normally initially forms aside from any vertical growth that takes place. The symbol used on the map for each of these étages at a particular observation time is for the genus, species, variety, mutation, or cloud motion that is considered most important according to criteria set out by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). If these elements for any étage at the time of observation are deemed to be of equal importance, then the type which is predominant in amount is coded by the observer and plotted on the weather map using the appropriate symbol. Special weather maps in aviation show areas of icing and turbulence.|$|E
