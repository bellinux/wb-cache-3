Protection by Olympic National Park, has allowed these rain forests to retain old growth trees, which supports a varied ecosystem. The Olympic rain forests are composed primarily of Sitka spruce and western hemlock, as are the surrounding lowland Sitka spruce forests, but are distinct in having a relative abundance of groves of bigleaf maple and vine maple, which support large epiphytic communities of mosses, lichens, ferns, and clubmosses; an abundance of nurse logs on the forest floor; a relatively open forest canopy and sparse shrub layer; and a dense <b>moss</b> <b>layer</b> on the forest floor.

Some experts argue that salvage logging tends to have a greater negative effect on the vegetation than the bark beetle outbreak alone. A study of the effects of forestry interventions on the herb and <b>moss</b> <b>layers</b> of infested mountain spruce forests suggest that without intervention the forests do eventually recover. Salvage logging also had negative effects on the composition of species, delaying recovery.|$|R

40|$|Boreal peatlands play {{important}} roles in global C and nutrient cycling. Oligotrophic bogs are naturally nitrogen (N) limited, receiving nutrients only via atmospheric deposition. Increased nutrient deposition, particularly N will almost certainly change the microbiology, biogeochemistry, and C and nutrient balances in bogs. Both primary production and decomposition can be affected, but the net effects of N fertilization are complex and unclear. A three-year N fertilization experiment with 15 N double labeled 15 NH 415 NO 3 as a tracer was designed to {{study the effects of}} increasing N deposition on various N pools (including microbial communities, moss, roots, litter, and aboveground vascular plants) and how these N pools process and retain applied N in four ombrogenous bogs in northern Alberta, Canada. Linear growth of Sphagnum mosses was highly variable. However, both capitulum and stem weight showed increase in weight with N addition, resulting in significant increase of capitulum and stem bulk density with N deposition. Total annual primary production, with both capitulum and stem growth accounted for, doubled from low N deposition plots to high N deposition plots. Microbial biomass N measured by chloroform fumigation-extraction only showed a decrease with N deposition {{in the first year of}} the experiment. Fungal biomass declined with N deposition as nutrients are readily available under high N loads, perhaps eliminating the need for help from symbiotic fungi for nutrient uptake. The growth of Sphagnum mosses and microbial communities may have been influenced by drier and warmer growing period during 2005 to 2007. These abnormal climatic events could have masked the effects of N deposition on surface Sphagnum moss and microbial communities. This 15 N tracer experiment revealed high retention rates of 15 N by <b>moss</b> <b>layers</b> as expected. However, retention efficiency of <b>moss</b> <b>layers</b> declined over time and with increasing N deposition, indicating a leakier system as N deposition exceeds the critical load of Sphagnum moss. Aboveground vascular plants overall benefited from N deposition, but different species responded differently based on the root morphology, rooting depths, and the mycorrhizae associations...|$|R
50|$|The {{shrub layer}} is the stratum of {{vegetation}} within a habitat with heights of {{between one and}} a half to about five metres. Young trees are also part of this layer. It may be divided into the first and second shrub layers (low and high bushes). The shrub layer needs sun and only a little moisture, unlike the <b>moss</b> <b>layer,</b> which requires a lot of water. This stratum only receives light filtered by the canopy. i.e. it is preferred by semi-shade or shade-loving plants that would not tolerate bright sunlight. In the shrub layer, which consists of young trees and bushes, birds like the blackbird, song thrush, robin or blackcap are at home. They build their nests protected in the bushes and are therefore referred to as bush nesters. In addition to shrubs, such as elder, hazel, hawthorn, raspberry and blackberry, clematis may also occur. At the edge of a wood, the shrub layer acts as a windbreak close to the trees and protects the soil from drying out.|$|E
5000|$|A plant {{community}} (sometimes [...] "phytocoenosis" [...] or [...] "phytocenosis") {{is a collection}} or association of plant species within a designated geographical unit, which forms a relatively uniform patch, distinguishable from neighboring patches of different vegetation types.

30|$|The results {{indicate}} that fire impacts and vegetation burning in the Alaskan boreal forest were significantly different from year to year, in part {{as a product of}} climate conditions. The overall distribution of burned land cover supports the considerable body of research that describes the coniferous species found in late-succession boreal forest, such as black and white spruce and spruce bogs, as the primary fire carriers in interior Alaska. However, the interannual distribution of land cover burned (Figure 2) also points out the occurrence of years when a substantial proportion of the vegetation burned is shrub and dwarf scrub, which have previously received comparatively less attention as fire carriers in the forest boreal interior. Very little research has been conducted on fire in shrub ecosystems in interior Alaska, and the bulk of the literature available indicates that fire does not burn in the shrub cover types (reviewed in Chapin et al. 2006), in part because there is substantially less fuel available compared to late-succession spruce forests and bogs, where fire carries primarily in the thick duff and <b>moss</b> <b>layers.</b> This result shows that there is considerable interannual variability in the composition of vegetation burned, and while Conifer is the most flammable ecosystem, Shrub and other classes can be quite flammable, especially under certain climatic conditions.|$|R
40|$|Litter {{decomposition}} is a core ecosystem {{process critical}} for carbon and nutrient cycling, and {{the functioning of}} terrestrial ecosystems. This thesis explores two contrasting ways by which plants can influence litter decomposition in forested ecosystems. The {{first half of the}} thesis examined the role of feather mosses in mediating the environmental conditions on the soil surface in boreal forests and the impact this has on litter decomposition. The feather <b>moss</b> <b>layer</b> intercepts much of the litterfall in boreal forests as well as retaining significant quantities of rainfall. The results showed that the pattern of moisture inputs to the <b>moss</b> <b>layer</b> was a major driver of litter decomposition and moss-associated cyanobacterial N 2 -fixation. Under conditions of limited moisture availability the mosses promoted the decomposition of leaf litter within the <b>moss</b> <b>layer</b> by preventing the desiccation of the litter, maintaining decomposer activity. In this way the effect of the <b>moss</b> <b>layer</b> was dependent on the prevailing moisture conditions. Further, the results showed that the <b>moss</b> <b>layer</b> promoted the decomposition of intercepted leaf litter to a similar extent across all stages of a 360 -year successional gradient, despite a large increase in the depth of the <b>moss</b> <b>layer</b> and changing ecosystem properties. The second half of the thesis investigated two poorly explored aspects of the relationships between plant functional traits, litter quality and litter decomposition in temperate rain forests in New Zealand. The results showed that the decomposition of leaf, twig and wood litter of 27 co-occurring tree species was uncoordinated. This lack of coordination occurred because wood decomposition was driven by differences in the wood density of trees, which itself was unrelated to the chemical traits driving the decomposition of leaf and twig litter. The results also revealed a high degree of intraspecific variation in the leaf functional traits and leaf litter decomposition of 16 co-occurring plant species. Within species, leaf traits varied predictably in response to a soil nutrient gradient but were not related to the variations in decomposition. Overall, the results of this thesis illustrate the important and contrasting impacts that plants can have on litter decomposition, and contributes {{to the understanding of the}} complex interactions between multiple factors that regulate litter decomposition in forest ecosystems...|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{atmospheric}} nitrogen (N) deposition on ecosystem functioning largely {{depend on the}} retention of N in different ecosystem compartments, but accumulation and partitioning processes have rarely been quantified in long-term field experiments. In the present study we analysed {{for the first time}} decadal-scale flows and allocation patterns of N in a heathland ecosystem that has been subject to airborne N inputs over decades. Using a long-term 15 N tracer experiment, we quantified N retention and flows to and between ecosystem compartments (above-ground/below-ground vascular biomass, <b>moss</b> <b>layer,</b> soil horizons, leachate). After 9 years, about 60 % of the added 15 N-tracer remained in the N cycle of the ecosystem. The <b>moss</b> <b>layer</b> proved to be a crucial link between incoming N and its allocation to different ecosystem compartments (in terms of a short-term capture, but long-term release function). However, about 50 % of the 15 N captured and released by the <b>moss</b> <b>layer</b> was not compensated for by a corresponding increase in recovery rates in any other compartment, probably due to denitrification losses from the <b>moss</b> <b>layer</b> in the case of water saturation after rain events. The O-horizon proved {{to be the most important}} long-term sink for added 15 N, as reflected by an increase in recovery rates from 18 to 40 % within 8 years. Less than 2. 1 % of 15 N were recovered in the podzol-B-horizon, suggesting that only negligible amounts of N were withdrawn from the N cycle of the ecosystem. Moreover, 15 N recovery was low in the dwarf shrub above-ground biomass (< 3. 9 % after 9 years) and in the leachate (about 0. 03 % within 1 year), indicating still conservative N cycles of the ecosystem, even after decades of N inputs beyond critical load thresholds. The continuous accumulation of reactive forms of airborne N suggests that critical load-estimates need to account for cumulative effects of N additions into ecosystems...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Fine root {{is a key}} {{component}} in nutrient cycling of forested ecosystems. In this study, fine root biomass (< 2 mm in diameter) were examined at a severely burned black spruce forest at the Poker Flat Research Range in August 2005, one year after severe wildfire in summer 2004. An unburned black spruce forest close to the burned site was also investigated as a control. Estimated fine root biomass, including live and dead fine roots, in surface <b>moss</b> + organic <b>layer</b> to the soil depth of 20 cm was ~ 1010 and ~ 1040 g m- 2 in burned and unburned sites, respectively, 70 % of which was concentrated to surface <b>moss</b> + organic <b>layers</b> in both sites. However, because of technical difficulties, we could not separate roots from root-organic matter complexes in part and they were 360 and 900 g m- 2 in burned and unburned sites, respectively. Thickness of the surface <b>moss</b> + organic <b>layer</b> was smaller in the burned site (~ 22 cm) than in the unburned site (~ 38 cm), which resulted in larger fine root density at the surface layer in burned site (~ 4. 4 kg m- 3) than in unburned site (~ 2. 4 kg m- 3). Roughly estimated living proportion of fine roots was 1 % and 65 % in the burned and unburned plots, respectively. Although there are technical problems to be solved, {{the results of this}} study suggested that wildfire in 2004 substantially affected ground surface condition (decline in <b>moss</b> + organic <b>layer)</b> and killed most of fine roots at the severely burned black spruce forest, but the effects on total fine root biomass might not be remarkable. 1...|$|R
40|$|We {{reconstruct}} terrestrial and freshwater environments of {{the last}} two Quaternary interglacials in coastal east Antarctica by examining multi-proxy evidence in a lake sediment core. The record, from Progress Lake in the Larsemann Hills consists of two discrete sediment units. The lower unit contains the first known evidence of Antarctic coastal environments during a previous interglacial, likely to be MIS 5 e. Biogeochemical, biological and sedimentological climate proxies revealed a productive biological community and an active hydrological regime, consistent with the warmer conditions detected in continental ice cores at this time. The diatom assemblage was similar to that currently found in the sub- and maritime-Antarctic biome and included some sub-Antarctic endemic taxa that have not previously been reported from east Antarctica. This suggests southward expansion of the sub-Antarctic diatom biome during MIS 5 e. Mosses were also present in the lake or the catchment but are rare in the region today. Two discrete periods of enhanced productivity show that the MIS 5 e environment was not stable. MIS 5 e ended abruptly with a rapid transition to glacial conditions, the lake was covered by a layer of firnified snow and ice, and phototrophic biological activity ceased for a period of c. 90, 000 years. The upper unit was deposited in MIS 1 after 3470 – 3687 cal yr BP after phototrophic biological production resumed. Lower species diversity, pigment production, an Antarctic continental diatom assemblage and an absence of <b>moss</b> <b>layers</b> suggest cooler conditions during MIS 1. ...|$|R

The basal sediments, which are dominated by glacial and glaciofluvial clastic sediments, attest to a Late Pleistocene deglaciation of the lake basin. These sediments are overlain by 2. 70 m of laminated algal and microbial mats and a few interspersed <b>moss</b> <b>layers.</b> Radiocarbon dating, conducted on bulk organic carbon of 12 samples throughout the organic sequence, provides a reliable chronology since the onset of biogenic accumulation at c. 12, 400 cal. year BP. Successful diatom colonization, however, was probably hampered by extensive ice and snow cover on the lake and restricted input of nutrients until 10, 200 cal. year BP. A subsequent increase of nutrient supply culminated between 8600 and 8200 cal. year BP and is related to warm summer temperatures and reduced albedo in the catchment.

Colder temperatures from 6700 cal. year BP culminated in several periods between 6200 and 3700 cal. year BP, when high amounts of sulphur and low abundances of diatoms were deposited due to a perennial ice and snow cover on the lake. During the late Holocene, relatively warm conditions between 3200 and 2300 cal. year BP and between 1500 to 1000 cal. year BP, respectively, indicated by high accumulation of organic matter and reducing bottom water conditions, were interrupted and followed by colder periods. 19 page(s...|$|R

40|$|The {{predicted}} {{increase in}} atmospheric temperatures {{is expected to}} affect the turnover of soil organic carbon in permafrost soils through modifications of the soil thermal regime. However, the tundra biome is formed of a mosaic of diverse landscape types with differing patterns of soil organic carbon storage and partitioning. Among these, differences in e. g. vegetation diversity and soil movements due to freeze-thaw processes are of main importance for assessing potential C remobilization under a changing climate. In this study, we described the storage of soil organic carbon (SOC) and the aboveground phytomass carbon in relation to geomorphology and periglacial features for two areas on Taymir Peninsula (Arctic Russia). An average of 29. 5 kg C m- 2, calculated by upscaling with a land cover classification, is stored in the upper soil meter at these two study sites. The mean C phytomass storage amounts to ca. 0. 406 Kg C m- 2, or only 1. 38 % of the total SOC storage. The topography, at different scales, {{plays an important role}} in the carbon partitioning. High amounts of soil organic carbon are found in highland areas and within the patterned ground features found in peatlands. The highest amounts of aboveground phytomass carbon are found in deciduous shrubs and <b>moss</b> <b>layers.</b> The large variability in carbon distribution within land cover types among the sites reveals the challenge of upscaling the carbon storage values over the Arctic and thus highlight the necessity to carry out detailed field inventories in this region...|$|R
40|$|There are two {{dominant}} {{mechanisms for}} {{development of a new}} tree layer and subsequent canopy recruitment after major canopy mortality events. First, regeneration may develop from a pulse of new post-disturbance recruitment. Alternatively, regeneration can be from the existing seedling bank that survived the canopy mortality event. The timing and extent of post-disturbance recruitment from seed and the relative importance of the existing seedling bank is poorly understood in MPB-disturbed forests. The recruitment of post-MPB seedlings is a function of seed-source availability, seedbed substrate, overstory structure, and time since MPB attack. In the northern interior, post-MPB recruitment was sparse in stands impacted by beetle 3 - 10 years earlier. Subalpine fir comprised the majority of the post-MPB recruitment. It increased with local parent tree basal area and increased strongly with proximity to a major seed source, resulting in a patchy distribution. Lodgepole pine post-MPB recruitment was limited by overstory shading; pine regeneration decreased as the total overstory basal area increased. Spruce regeneration was similarly limited by total overstory basal area. Seedbed substrates were dominated by undisturbed <b>moss</b> <b>layers</b> and changed little (in the 3 - 10 yr post-MPB attacked stands). There was a weak trend to increased regeneration in older stands (7 - 10 years). Based on destructive sampling and stand reconstruction, regeneration post-beetle attack in the Flathead was often, but not always, delayed by 5 - 10 years. In most stands, this was followed by a strong pulse of regeneration for about 10 years. Twenty years after the outbreak there was an abrupt decrease in recruitment. In 2007, densities of post-beetle regeneration in all but 2 of the 22 stands were adequate for stocking. Based on age of understory trees in 2007, there was little advance regeneration in these forests {{at the time of the}} beetle attack.

40|$|Rates of input, accumulation, and {{turnover}} of C differ markedly within soil profiles and in soils with different drainage in the BOREAS northern study area. Soil C storage increases from ∼ 3 kg C m - 2 in well-drained, sandy soils to greater than 100 kg C m - 2 in wetlands. Two modes of C accumulation {{were observed in}} upland soil profiles. Large annual C inputs (0. 06 - 0. 1 kg C m - 2 yr - 1) and slow decomposition (turnover times of 6 - 250 years) lead to rapid C accumulation in regrowing surface <b>moss</b> and detrital <b>layers</b> following fire. Deep organic layers that have accumulated over the millennia since the initiation of soil development, and are located below the most recent charred horizon, show slower rates of input (0. 015 - 0. 03 kg C m - 2 yr - 1) and turnover (100 - 1600 years) and accumulate C about 10 times slower than surface detrital layers. Rates of C input to soils derived from C and 14 C data were in accord with net primary production estimates, with highest rates of input (0. 14 - 0. 6 kg C m - 2 yr - 1) in wetlands. Turnover times for C in surface detrital layers were 6 - 15 years for well-drained sand soils that showed highest soil temperatures in summer, 30 - 40 years for wetlands, and 36 - 250 years for uplands with thick moss cover and black spruce trees. Long (> 100 years) turnover times in upland black spruce/clay soils most likely reflect the influence of woody debris incorporated into detrital layers. Turnover times for deep organic and mineral layer C were controlled by drainage, with fastest turnover (80 - 130 years) in well-drained sand soils and slowest turnover (> 3000 years) in wetlands. Total C accumulation rates, which account for C losses from both deep organic and surface detrital layers, are close to zero for sand/jack pine soils, 0. 003 - 0. 01 kg C m - 2 yr - 1 for moderately to poorly drained sites in mature forest stands, and 0. 03 kg C m - 2 yr - 1 for a productive fen. Decomposition of organic matter more than several decades old accounts for 9 - 22 % of total heterotrophic respiration at these sites. The rates of C accumulation derived here are decadal averages for specific stands and will vary as stands age or undergo disturbance. Extrapolation to larger regions and longer timescales, where burning offsets C gains in <b>moss</b> <b>layers,</b> will yield smaller rates of C storage...|$|R

Dead trees were covered in an airtight fashion by the <b>moss.</b> This <b>layer</b> is also referred to today as old forest peat (Waldtorf). The peat moss died underneath but continued to grow upwards indefinitely. This formed a thick layer of peat. The surface of this vegetation is strongly curved towards the centre, which is why it is called a raised bog. The geographic elevation of the bog has thus {{nothing to do with the}} term [...] "raised bog", because they also occur in the lowlands.|$|R
40|$|When {{fertilizer}} is {{broadcast in}} boreal forest stands, the applied nutrients must {{pass through a}} thick layer of either feather moss or leaf litter which covers the forest floor. In a growth chamber experiment we tested the transfer of N through living feather moss or aspen litter when fertilized with urea ((NH 2) 2 CO) or NH 4 NO 3 at a rate of 100 kg ha− 1 and under different watering regimes. When these organic substrates were frequently watered to excess they allowed the highest transfer of nutrients through, although 72 % of the applied fertilizer was captured in the substrates. In a field experiment we also fertilized moss and aspen litter with urea ((NH 2) 2 CO) or NH 4 NO 3 at a more operationally relevant rate of 330 kg ha− 1. We captured the NO 3 − or NH 4 + by ion exchange resin at the substrate–mineral soil interface. In contrast to the growth chamber experiment, this fertilizer rate killed the moss and there was no detectable increase in nutrient levels in the aspen litter or feather <b>moss</b> <b>layers.</b> Instead, the urea was more likely transferred into the mineral soil; mineral soil of the urea treatment had 1. 6 times as much extractable N compared to the NH 4 NO 3 treatment. This difference between the growth chamber and field studies was attributed to observed fertilizer- damage to the living moss and possibly damage to the litter microflora due to the higher rate of fertilization in the field. In addition, the early and substantial rainfall after fertilization in the field experiment produced conditions for rapid leaching of N through the organic layers into the mineral soil. In the field, only 8 % of the urea-N that was applied was captured by the ion exchange resin, while 34 % was captured in for the NH 4 NO 3 fertilization. Thus, the conditions for rapid leaching in the field moved much of the N in the form of urea through the organic layers and into the mineral soil before it was hydrolyzed...|$|R
50|$|The {{herbaceous}} stratum contains non-woody vegetation, {{or ground}} cover, {{growing in the}} forest with heights of up to about {{one and a half}} metres. The herbaceous layer consists of various herbaceous plants, grasses, dwarf shrubs (hemicryptophytes, geophytes, therophytes and chamaephytes) and young shrubs. In forests, early flowering plants appear first before the canopy fills out. Thereafter, the amount of light available to plants is significantly reduced and only those that are suited to such conditions can thrive. By contrast, grassland consists of <b>moss</b> and herbaceous <b>layers.</b> Sometimes, a shrub layer builds up as part of a process of reforestation (succession).|$|R
40|$|Transport of nutrients, CO 2, methane, {{and oxygen}} plays an {{important}} ecological role at the surface of wetland ecosystems. A possibly important transport mechanism in a water-saturated peat <b>moss</b> <b>layer</b> (usually Sphagnum cuspidatum) is nocturnal buoyancy flow, the downward flow of relatively cold surface water, and the upward flow of warm water induced by nocturnal cooling. Mathematical stability analysis showed that buoyancy flow occurs in a cooling porous layer if the system’s Rayleigh number (Ra) exceeds 25. For a temperature difference of 10 K between day and night, a typical Ra value for a peat <b>moss</b> <b>layer</b> is 80, which leads to quickly developing buoyancy cells. Numerical simulation demonstrated that fluid flow leads to a considerable mixing of water. Temperature measurements in a cylindrical peat sample of 50 -cm height and 35 -cm diameter were {{in agreement with the}} theoretical results. The nocturnal flow and the associated mixing of the water represent a mechanism for solute transport in water-saturated parts of peat land and in other types of terrestrializing vegetation. This mechanism may be particularly important in continental wetlands, where Ra values in summer are often much larger than the threshold for fluid flow. ...|$|E
40|$|Due to {{land use}} changes and reduced hunting {{pressure}} in their wintering grounds, goose numbers increased {{dramatically over the}} past 50 years. To understand the consequences of these changes, studies on ecosystem processes of the breeding grounds in the Artic are indispensable. A key process affected by herbivores is decomposition, which in turn influences nutrient cycling and thus plant growth. Here, we investigated the influence of geese on the nitrogen cycle. In Spitsbergen (78 ° 55 ' N, 11 ° 56 ' E), we used paired long-term exclosures and control plots. Nitrogen incorporation from decomposing litter was studied by tracing the fate of 15 N originating from 15 N-labelled moss and grass litter. In this study we found indications of geese (grazing) impacting on almost all levels of nitrogen cycling. Geese change the start material for decomposition and nitrogen mineralisation by enhancing the nitrogen concentration and by redistribution of nitrogen among the different ecosystem compartments. Although goose grazing did not significantly alter nitrogen release from moss or grass litter, geese might indirectly {{have an impact on}} nitrogen release rates from plant litter by suppressing the production of grass litter, which was found to release nitrogen more readily than moss litter. Moreover, the fate of litter nitrogen varied through at least two mechanisms: i. e. the suppression of grass litter production and the reduction of the <b>moss</b> <b>layer.</b> Indeed, in this study a strong indication was found that nitrogen from grass litter is partly intercepted by the <b>moss</b> <b>layer</b> when it, after decomposition, migrates down to the rooting zone of vascular plants. In absence of geese the <b>moss</b> <b>layer</b> is thicker and more nitrogen from grass litter is intercepted. Already after one winter goose effects on release rates and redistribution from litter nitrogen were found. This means that geese even impact on the nitrogen cycle outside the growing season, when they overwinter further south, and underlines the need for more research over winter times...|$|E
40|$|Arctic tundra {{vegetation}} {{composition is}} expected to undergo rapid changes during the coming decades because of changes in climate. Higher air temper- atures generally favor growth of deciduous shrubs, often {{at the cost of}} moss growth. Mosses are con- sidered to be very important to critical tundra ecosystem processes involved in water and energy exchange, but very little empirical data are avail- able. Here, we studied the effect of experimental moss removal on both understory evapotranspira- tion and ground heat flux in plots with either a thin or a dense low shrub canopy in a tundra site with continuous permafrost in Northeast Siberia. Understory evapotranspiration increased with removal of the green <b>moss</b> <b>layer,</b> suggesting that most of the understory evapotranspiration originated from the organic soil layer underlying the green <b>moss</b> <b>layer.</b> Ground heat flux partitioning also increased with green moss removal indicating the strong insulating effect of moss. No significant effect of shrub canopy density on understory evapotranspiration was measured, but ground heat flux partitioning was reduced by a denser shrub canopy. In summary, our results show that mosses may exert strong controls on understory water and heat fluxes. Changes in moss or shrub cover may have important consequences for summer perma- frost thaw and concomitant soil carbon release in Arctic tundra ecosystems...|$|E
40|$|Managed {{and wild}} fires play a {{significant}} role in the ecology of heathlands in the UK but we currently have little ability to forecast fire behaviour or the likelihood of accidental wildfires. Like many shrubland fuel types, heathlands display significant structural complexity and the role of different fuel components in governing flammability has not been clear. Using a series of small, field-based ignition tests, we demonstrate the critical importance of the moisture content of dead fine fuels in the lower canopy for determining when sustaining fires in the vegetation canopy can develop. At moisture contents above c. 70 % both spot and line ignitions failed but where moisture contents were less than c. 60 % fires developed rapidly. The initial rate of spread of successful ignitions was primarily controlled by the moisture content of the lower canopy and the moss/litter layer. Models that predict the moisture content of elevated dead fuels and the <b>moss</b> litter <b>layer</b> are urgently needed in order to protect heathlands from wildfire and to allow forecasts of the suitability of conditions for prescribed burning to be developed...|$|R
40|$|The {{atmospheric}} {{heavy metal}} pollution (lead, cadmium and zinc) of the Brynica district (one {{of the most}} polluted regions of Poland) was assessed in {{the top layer of}} soils (0 - 20 cm), organic layer and in tissues of the common woodland moss Pleurozium schreberii. Samples were taken in July 2008 at 31 points distributed over a 1500 x 1500 m grid. The concentration of trace elements changed depending on analysed material, distance from the metallurgic complex &# 8220;Miasteczko Slaskie&# 8221; and type of metals. The highest concentrations were close to Miasteczko Slaskie. The highest values were in the organic <b>layer.</b> <b>Moss</b> samples were useful as biomonitors. The analyses confirmed a considerable contamination with heavy metals of the forest environment in the Brynica district...|$|R
5000|$|Growing bogs can {{be divided}} into two layers. The 'acrotelm' (Greek: akros = highest; telma = bog) is the upper part and {{includes}} the vegetation layer and the bog 'floor'. Here fresh organic substances (peat formation horizon) are created by the growth and dying of plant elements. The [...] "catotelm" [...] (Greek: kato = below) is the underlying water-saturated part with less biological activity. This layer is counted as a geological subsoil due to the small earth-forming processes that are still going on and is known as the peat preservation horizon (Torferhaltungshorizont). In raised bogs, the upper peat layer is called white peat, since it consists of largely undecomposed light brown peat <b>mosses.</b> The lower <b>layer</b> is black peat, which is already well humified and has a black-brown colour with still recognizable plant remains.|$|R
