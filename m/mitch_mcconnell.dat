Ultimately, Bevin and his advisors decided that legislative redistricting had made Yarmuth's district unwinnable for a Republican, and Bevin chose not to run.|$|E

Although he gained the support of various groups aligned with the Tea Party Movement, McConnell attacked him repeatedly for inconsistencies in his public statements and policy positions and defeated him by almost 25 percentage points. After announcing he would seek the governorship in 2015, Bevin emerged from a four-way Republican primary, besting his nearest competitor, Agriculture Commissioner James Comer by 83 votes. On November 3, 2015, he defeated the state's attorney general, Democrat Jack Conway, in the general election.|$|E
5|$|On July 14, 2017, McCain {{underwent}} a minimally invasive craniotomy at Mayo Clinic Hospital in Phoenix, Arizona, {{in order to}} remove a blood clot above his left eye.

Five days later, Mayo Clinic doctors announced that the laboratory results from the surgery confirmed the presence of a glioblastoma, which is a very aggressive brain tumor. Standard treatment options for this tumor include chemotherapy and radiation, although even with treatment, average survival time is approximately 14 months. McCain is a survivor of previous cancers, including melanoma.|$|E

25|$|In 2008, in {{addition}} to serving {{as an adviser to}} <b>Mitch</b> <b>McConnell's</b> reelection campaign, Jennings served as the General Consultant to Brett Guthrie, the Republican running for Congress in the open seat in Kentucky's second congressional district.

5|$|Beshear {{did little}} in the {{political}} arena for almost a decade after his 1987 primary defeat, but in late 1995, he was encouraged by Democratic leaders – including former governor Ned Breathitt, Senator Wendell H. Ford, and Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee chair Bob Kerrey – to challenge incumbent Republican Senator <b>Mitch</b> <b>McConnell.</b> Beshear entered the primary as a heavy favorite against Tom Barlow, a former one-term Congressman from Kentucky's First District, and Shelby Lanier, a retired Louisville police officer. During the primary campaign, Beshear virtually ignored Barlow and Lanier and focused his rhetoric on McConnell. Despite Barlow's tour of all 120 Kentucky counties, Beshear cruised to victory in the primary, garnering 177,859 votes (66.38%) to Barlow's 64,235 (23.97%) and Lanier's 25,856 (9.65%).|$|E

5000|$|Working {{alongside}} Senator <b>Mitch</b> <b>McConnells</b> 2014 {{campaign as}} lead digital director, Harris brought [...] "a {{new era of}} social campaigning for Republicans" [...] through social media integration. Straying from the typical communication plan centered on traditional media, Harris created a brand new, modernized platform skyrocketing the Senators following. Armed with a social media strategy, McConnell won the 2014 Kentucky Primary Election and will contest the upcoming November elections utilizing the same digital expertise.|$|R
5000|$|After the 2012 presidential election, Benton {{agreed to}} serve as Senate Minority Leader <b>Mitch</b> <b>McConnell's</b> {{campaign}} manager for his 2014 re-election campaign. In hiring Benton, McConnell hoped to avoid a Republican primary from a conservative challenger, although Tea Party Republican Matt Bevin would ultimately challenge McConnell. The move was notable as McConnell had endorsed Paul's 2010 Republican primary opponent, Trey Grayson, and McConnell represented the [...] "establishment" [...] wing of the Kentucky Republican party while Benton's background was in [...] "grassroots" [...] advocacy.|$|R
5|$|In the 1980s, Nunn {{served on}} the boards of regents of Morehead State University and Kentucky State University. He served as a {{lecturer}} at Western Kentucky University, and received the Distinguished Alumni Award from the University of Louisville in 1999. During the late 1980s, he criticized Senator <b>Mitch</b> <b>McConnell,</b> one of the emerging leaders of the state's Republican party, for not doing more to support other Republicans in their bids for office; McConnell maintained that he had to focus on his own reelection campaign in 1990. In 1988, Nunn unsuccessfully challenged Congressman Jim Bunning in his bid to retain his position as Kentucky's Republican national committeeman.|$|E
5|$|Wendell Hampton Ford (September 8, 1924 – January 22, 2015) was an American {{politician}} {{from the}} Commonwealth of Kentucky. He served for twenty-four {{years in the}} U.S. Senate and was the 53rd Governor of Kentucky. He {{was the first person}} to be successively elected lieutenant governor, governor and United States senator in Kentucky history. The Senate Democratic whip from 1991 to 1999, he was considered the leader of the state's Democratic Party from his election to governor in 1971 until his retirement from the Senate in 1999. At the time of his retirement, he was the longest-serving senator in Kentucky's history, a mark which was then surpassed by <b>Mitch</b> <b>McConnell</b> in 2009.|$|E
5|$|Beshear's initial rise to {{political}} prominence was interrupted in 1987 {{when he finished}} third in a five-candidate Democratic gubernatorial primary election. The Beshear campaign's sparring with that of former Governor Brown, the second-place finisher in the primary, {{opened the door for}} political novice Wallace Wilkinson's well-financed campaign to achieve a come-from-behind upset in the race. For the next 20 years, Beshear practiced law at a Lexington law firm. His only foray into politics during this period was an unsuccessful challenge to Senator <b>Mitch</b> <b>McConnell</b> in 1996. In 2007, however, Beshear was drawn back into politics by the vulnerability of incumbent Republican Governor Ernie Fletcher, whose administration was under extended investigation by then-Attorney General Greg Stumbo, over violations of the state's merit system. In the 2007 gubernatorial election, Beshear emerged from a six-candidate Democratic primary – largely on the strength of his pledge to expand casino gambling as a means of further funding social programs like education – and defeated Fletcher in the general election. Beshear won re-election in 2011, defeating Republican David L. Williams and Independent Gatewood Galbraith. He was ineligible for re-election in 2015 due to term limits imposed by the Kentucky Constitution.|$|E
5|$|In March 2013, Paul, with Senators Ted Cruz and Mike Lee, {{threatened}} another filibuster, {{this one}} opposing any legislative proposals to expand federal gun control measures. The filibuster was attempted on April 11, 2013, but was dismissed by cloture, in a 68–31 vote. Also in March 2013, Paul endorsed fellow Kentucky Republican Senator <b>Mitch</b> <b>McConnell's</b> 2014 re-election campaign. McConnell had previously hired Paul's 2010 campaign manager, Jesse Benton, {{as his own}} campaign manager. Paul's endorsement {{was seen as a}} major win for McConnell in avoiding a challenge in the Republican primary.|$|R
50|$|Memorial {{services}} were held on April 25, 2014 {{on what would}} have been his 94th birthday. Representatives from Japan including members of the organization that found his remains attended the memorial services as well as representatives of Kentucky Governor Steve Beshear and Senator <b>Mitch</b> <b>McConnell's</b> offices. Governor Steve Beshear ordered that flags should be lowered to half-staff from sunrise to sunset in Kentucky on April 25, 2014, in honor of PFC William T. Carneal. He was laid to rest in Paducah, Kentucky, rather than Arlington National Cemetery, because his surviving family wanted to have him buried next to the sister who raised him after his parents died. Carneal was remembered in the Congressional Record.|$|R
