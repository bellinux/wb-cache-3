40|$|Recently, silk sericin has {{attracted}} the attention of researchers owing to its useful properties as a biomaterial including 1) good wound healing and cell activities, 2) fast gelation character, and 3) high water retention property. In the present study, silk sericin was prepared using different extraction times in hot water and the effect of extraction time on the rheological properties of sericin solutions and gels was examined. It was found that the production yield of sericin increased with extraction time. The shear viscosity of sericin solutions and gels decreased with increasing extraction time due to a decrease in sericin molecular weight. When the sericin solution transformed to a gel, the viscosity increased and the shear thinning behavior was more evident. In addition, the shear stress measurements indicated that the slip between the sericin samples and the <b>measuring</b> <b>plate</b> of the rheometer was increased by the gelation of sericin.

40|$|M. Tech. (Chiropractic) Purpose: The pelvis, femur, tibia, fibula, {{ankle and}} foot form a closed {{kinematic}} chain during gait. According to biomechanical principles any restriction or tension {{in one part}} of the kinematic chain will create increased load on the other parts of the same chain (Comerford and Mottram, 2001; Sahrmann, 2000). This increased load can lead to dysfunction and compensation along the chain and also lead to gait anomalies. A chiropractic adjustment is utilised for the treatment of sacroiliac joint restrictions. There has not been research conducted to establish the effects that a chiropractic adjustment has on lower limb biomechanics and gait. The purpose of this study was to determine whether a sacroiliac adjustment had an effect on gait by looking at the gait parameters. Method: Sixty participants who were between the ages of 18 and 40 years were recruited. The participants were asked to sign a consent form and then a thorough history and physical examination was performed to ensure that participants did not have any disease or pathology that may have excluded them from the study. These included foot pathologies, knee pathologies, hip pathologies, structural leg length discrepancies, or any contraindications to chiropractic adjustment. A lumbar spine regional examination as well as motion palpation of the sacroiliac joints was performed to determine which joints were restricted. Each participant then underwent a gait assessment before and after they received a chiropractic adjustment to the restricted sacroiliac joint. Procedure: Participants only received one adjustment. Objective measurements were obtained using the Zebris FDM gait analysis system. This system uses high-quality capacitive force sensors that are arranged in matrix form. As a result, each sensor produces its own calibration curve. The measuring plates enable the static and dynamic force distribution to be analysed under the feet while standing and walking. The <b>measuring</b> <b>plate</b> is integrated in a level walking area. The measuring parameters are automatically calculated in the WinFDM program and a printable, easy to read report of the measuring results is then available (Zebris Medical GmbH, Germany). Each participant walked over the <b>measuring</b> <b>plate</b> for 4 times. This was done before and after the adjustment. Results: Statistically significant changes were seen between the pre and post treatment measurements of foot rotation on the treatment side, the step length on the treatment side, the stride length, the stance phase on both the treatment and non-treatment sides, the swing phase on the treatment and non-treatment side and the total double support. Conclusion: This study shows that a chiropractic adjustment to the sacroiliac joint does change certain gait parameters and it should therefore be part of any treatment regime for gait abnormalities. Podiatrists, biokineticists and chiropractors should work together when treating patients with gait abnormalities. As the study only recruited asymptomatic participants, further studies are necessary to determine the effect a chiropractic adjustment has on the gait of symptomatic patients...|$|E

Visual assessment methods are frequently applied in plate waste studies because they are more convenient than weighing; the visual quarter-waste method has become one of the most commonly used in studies of school meal consumption, but little is known about its accuracy. Objective The aims of this study were to determine whether the visual quarter-waste method is valid and reliable in a school cafeteria setting when compared to weighing plate waste. Methods Researchers both weighed and visually assessed plate waste from 748 trays in nine middle schools and high schools. In addition, two researchers independently assessed 59 of these trays using the quarter-waste method. The data were analyzed using the weighted Kappa coefficient and interpreted using the scale developed by Landis & Koch. Results For validity, 45 % of foods assessed using the quarter-waste method were in “almost perfect agreement” with the measured weight, 42 % of foods visually assessed were in “substantial agreement” with the weight, 10 % were in “moderate agreement” and 3 % were in “slight agreement”. For inter-rater reliability, eight of ten food groups had Kappas in “almost perfect agreement” between the two raters and the other two groups had Kappas in “substantial agreement” between the two raters.

In this study, we investigated {{for the first time}} that whether high pressure CO 2 (HPCD), one of the nonthermal pasteurization techniques, can induce Escherichia coli O 157 :H 7 into the VBNC state. By <b>measuring</b> <b>plate</b> counts, viable cell counts and total cell counts, E. coli O 157 :H 7 in 0. 85 % NaCl solution (pH 7. 0) was able to enter the VBNC state by HPCD treatment at 5 MPa and four temperatures (25 °C, 31 °C, 34 °C and 37 °C). Meanwhile, with the improvement of treatment temperature, the time required for E. coli O 157 :H 7 to enter VBNC state would shorten. Enzymatic activities in these VBNC cells were lower than those in the exponential-phase cells by using API ZYM kit, which were also reduced with increasing the treatment temperature, but the mechanical resistance of the VBNC cells to sonication was enhanced. These results further confirmed VBNC state was a self-protection mechanism for some bacteria, which minimized cellular energetic requirements and increased the cell resistance. When incubated in tryptic soy broth at 37 °C, the VBNC cells induced by HPCD treatment at 25 °C, 31 °C and 34 °C achieved resuscitation, but their resuscitation capabilities decreased with increasing the treatment temperature. Furthermore, electron microscopy revealed changes in the morphology and interior structure of the VBNC cells and the resuscitated cells. These results demonstrated that HPCD could induce E. coli O 157 :H 7 into the VBNC state.

40|$|Mass {{balances}} usually use {{a strain}} gauge that requires an impedance measurement and {{is susceptible to}} noise and thermal drift. A piezoelectric balance {{can be used to}} measure mass directly by monitoring the voltage developed across the piezoelectric balance, which is linear with weight or it can be used in resonance to produce a frequency change proportional to the mass change (see figure). The piezoelectric actuator/balance is swept in frequency through its fundamental resonance. If a small mass is added to the balance, the resonance frequency shifts down in proportion to the mass. By monitoring the frequency shift, the mass can be determined. This design allows for two independent measurements of mass. Additionally, more than one sample can be verified because this invention allows for each sample to be transported away from the measuring device upon completion of the measurement, if required. A piezoelectric actuator, or many piezoelectric actuators, was placed between the collection plate of the sampling system and the support structure. As the sample mass is added to the plate, the piezoelectrics are stressed, causing them to produce a voltage that is proportional to the mass and acceleration. In addition, a change in mass delta m produces a change in the resonance frequency with delta f proportional to delta m. In a microgravity environment, the spacecraft could be accelerated to produce a force on the piezoelectric actuator that would produce a voltage proportional to the mass and acceleration. Alternatively, the acceleration could be used to force the mass on the plate, and the inertial effects of the mass on the plate would produce a shift in the resonance frequency with the change in frequency related to the mass change. Three prototypes of the mass balance mechanism were developed. These macro-mass balances each consist of a solid base and an APA 60 Cedrat flextensional piezoelectric actuator supporting a <b>measuring</b> <b>plate.</b> A similar structure with 3 APA 120 Cedrat flextensional piezoelectric actuators spaced equidistantly at 120 degrees supporting the plate and a softer macro balance with an APA 150 actuator/sensor were developed. These flextensional actuators were chosen because they increase the sensitivity of the actuator to stress, allow the piezoelectric to be pre-stressed, and the piezoelectric element is a stacked multilayer actuator, which has a considerably lower input impedance than a monolithic element that allows for common instruments (e. g., input impedance of 10 megohms) to measure the voltage without rapidly discharging the charge/voltage on the piezoelectric actuator...|$|E
40|$|M. Tech. (Chiropractic) Problem Statement: Ankle sprains {{are one of}} {{the most}} common acute {{injuries}} treated by physicians (Pellow & Brantingham, 2001). Most ankle sprains involve the lateral ankle ligaments, with the anterior tibiotalar ligament being the most commonly affected in injuries involving plantarflexion and inversion. These injuries often result in restriction of movements that will limit gait (Crosbie, Green, Refshauge, 1999). Even in the event of injury to one ankle, the sensorimotor and postural deficits can be bilateral due to central processing of motor control information (Munna et. al., 2010, Monaghan et. al., 2006). The primary aim of a chiropractic adjustment is to increase joint range of motion (Fryer, Mudge, McLaughlin, 2002) and to correct local joint dysfunction (Pellow & Brantingham, 2001). No prior research has been done using the Zebris FDM-system to analyze changes in gait after ankle adjustment. Method: Sixty participants between the age of 15 and 45 years were recruited. The participants were asked to sign a consent form after which a thorough case history, full physical exam and foot and ankle regional examination were performed. Participants were included in the study if they were of the correct age, had a chronic history of minor ankle sprain and had palpable motion restrictions of ankle joint range of motion. Participants were excluded if they had a history of severe ankle injury or ankle surgery, had any contraindications to chiropractic adjustment or were currently undergoing any other treatment that could interfere with the study, including the use of certain medications. Each participant underwent a gait assessment before and after they received a chiropractic adjustment to the restricted ankle joint. Procedure: Objective measurements were obtained using the Zebris FDM-system before and after participants received one chiropractic adjustment using a long axis distraction technique. The Zebris FDM-system uses capacitive force sensors arranged on a platform in a high density. The <b>measuring</b> <b>plate</b> allows dynamic force distribution to be analysed during gait. The length of the Zebris platform allowed successive footfalls to be captured and measurements taken during three full gait cycles were used in the analysis. All data was processed using the WinFDM program to produce a gait report (Zebris Medical GmbH, 2008) Results: A statistically significant change was seen in the single support line on the non-adjusted side. Changes were measured in the other gait parameters although they were not statistically significant. Conclusion: This study has shown that chiropractic adjustment of the ankle joint has an effect on the path of centre of pressure and foot rotation during gait. It also helps clinicians to see that the adjustment has a bilateral effect. Future studies will be able to determine whether this is a positive or a negative outcome as the limits of normal and pathological gait using these parameters have not yet been set. Chiropractors can treat patients with a history of chronic ankle sprain more effectively if they have a better understanding of residual motion restrictions and movement patterns after acute ankle sprain. A future study including several treatments could be beneficial as clinical chiropractic practice would most likely involve more than one treatment of a patient with a history of ankle sprain. In this way the lasting and accumulative effects of chiropractic adjustment could be measured...|$|E
