Digestion of the genomic DNA with the restriction endonuclease NheI revealed 15 fragments between 10 kb and 450 kb. The sum of the fragments and resolution of the linearized chromosome yielded a total genome size of about 2. 3 Mbp. By overlapping methylation with the AluI-methylase six NheI recognition sites could be blocked. Fragments were ordered by partial/complete 2 D-PFGE of genomic DNA with and without prior AluI methylation, respectively.

40|$|We {{selected}} {{lines of}} Plasmodium chabaudi that {{are resistant to}} high levels of the antifolate drug pyrimethamine and have shown that rearrangement and duplication of a portion of chromosome 7 has occurred in the resistant lines. This chromosomal duplication results in an increase in the chromosome number from 14 to 15 : two derived chromosomes (450 kilobases and 1. 1 megabases) were smaller than the original chromosome 7 (1. 3 megabases), so that essentially only a 200 -kilobase region was duplicated. This region contained the DHFR-TS gene and the closely linked Hsp 70 gene. We have <b>macrorestriction</b> <b>mapped</b> chromosome 7 from the pyrimethamine-susceptible line (DS) and also the duplicated chromosome 7 s in the resistant line.

Additionally, the strain possesses a fourth smaller accessory segment of 28 kb and two deletions relative to strain K- 12. We report an integrated physical and genetic map of the 5, 120 -kb J 96 genome. The chromosome contains 26 NotI, 13 BlnI, and 7 I-CeuI <b>macrorestriction</b> sites. <b>Macrorestriction</b> <b>mapping</b> was rapidly accomplished by a novel transposon-based procedure: analysis of modified minitransposon insertions served to align the overlapping macrorestriction fragments generated by three different enzymes (each sharing a common cleavage site within the insert), thus integrating the three different digestion patterns and ordering the fragments. The resulting map, generated from a total of 54 mini-Tn 10 insertions, was supplemented with auxanography and Southern analysis to indicate the positions of insertionally disrupted aminosynthetic genes and cloned virulence genes, respectively. Thus, it contains not only physical, macrorestriction landmarks but also the loci for eight housekeeping genes shared with strain K- 12 and eight acknowledged urovirulence genes; the latter confirmed clustering of virulence genes at the large unique accessory chromosomal segments.

I found that strain BcF produced high levels of N-acyl homoserine lactones (AHLs) compared to closely related species of the Burkholderia cepacia complex. The predominant AHL was octanoyl homoserine lactone. A major goal {{of the project was}} to isolate mutants of strain BcF blocked in AHL formation and examine whether functions related to biocontrol were subject to quorum-sensing regulation. ^ I used PCR technology to isolate a 2, 191 -nt DNA fragment containing two divergently oriented genes, bafI and bafR, encoding, respectively, AHL synthase and AHL-binding transcriptional activator. Putative promoters were identified for both genes. The 724 -bp intergenic region between bafI and bafR contained a 417 -nt ORF of unknown function, which may be cotranscribed with bafR. ^ AHL-deficient strains, in which the bafI and bafR genes had been inactivated by allelic exchange or by transposon mutagenesis, exhibited decreased exoprotease and antifungal activity, and overproduced siderophores. I also isolated spontaneous AHL-deficient mutants with the same phenotypes in which the bafIR locus had been deleted. The AHL-deficient mutants had reduced ability to inhibit the growth of fungal pathogens such as Pythium ultimum, Rhizoctonia solani, and Fusarium oxysporum, and also exhibited reduced ability to suppress damping-off of cucumber by P. ultimum in vivo. We have constructed gfp-labelled derivative of strain BcF that we plan to use to monitor root colonization in vivo.

The putative oriC has been located on a 27. 5 -kb NotI fragment. Gene organization upstream the oriC is almost identical to that of Pseudomonas putida and Bacillus subtilis, whereas gene organization downstream the oriC seems to be unique among bacteria.

Summation of individually sized fragments derived by digestion of Scott A genomic DNA with each of these four enzymes provided an average estimated genome length of 3, 210 +/- 60 kb. Efforts to assemble the <b>macrorestriction</b> <b>map</b> benefited greatly from the construction and use of pLUCH 80 and pLUCH 88, temperature-sensitive vectors for delivering transposon Tn 917 ::NotI/SmaI to the chromosome of Scott A.

The Ps 55 chromosome map was constructed by transduction of auxotrophic and cryptic transposon insertions, with known genetic and physical locations in S. aureus NCTC 8325, into the Ps 55 background. PFGE and DNA hybridization analysis were used to detect the location of the transposon in Ps 55. Ps 55 restriction fragments were then ordered on the basis of genetic conservation between the two strains. Cloned DNA probes containing the lactose operon (lac) and genes encoding staphylococcal protein A (spa), gamma hemolysin (hlg), and coagulase (coa) were also located on the map by PFGE and hybridization analysis. This methodology enabled a direct comparison of chromosomal organization between NCTC 8325 and Ps 55 strains. The chromosome size, gene order, and some of the restriction sites are conserved between the two phage group strains. A physical map of a chromosome consists of an ordered set of restriction fragments that places genomic sequence in the order it exists inside the cell.
