This leads to the central limit theorem. Weak convergence to a Gaussian process using equicontinuity of functions is indicated. The results are established under very general conditions.

Then we look for sufficient conditions that guarantee the same energy estimate from above in all the extended phase space.

In some cases, these estimates produce a dissipative effect on the energy. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
