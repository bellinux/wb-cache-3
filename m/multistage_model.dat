It seems likely that multistage processes underlie the generation of a large majority of human cancers (the carcinomas), yet most research workers do not have any real interest in discussing the various alternative <b>multistage</b> <b>models</b> that attempt to describe these processes. These research workers can't all be wrong, so what is wrong with <b>multistage</b> <b>models?</b> The trouble is, I suppose, that the processes usually invoked are, in principle, extremely diffi-cult to observe (phenotypically silent changes in a few scattered somatic cells), and that very similar predictions for the few things we can actually observe may follow from mathematical elaboration of various very different <b>multistage</b> <b>models</b> (each with its own implausible chalones, feedback mechanisms, exact numbers of "stages " to be progressed through, mutations, epig<inetic switches, clonal growth rates, etc.).

Clinical judgment is used to define various categories of care, including a category for patients who are inappropriately hospitalized, for a large teaching hospital with a heavy indigent and psychiatric workload.

40|$|Murdoch and Krewski (1988) {{introduced}} {{the concept of}} the relative effectiveness of dosing in models of carcinogenesis with time-dependent exposure. Under certain models, such as the Armitage [...] Doll <b>multistage</b> <b>model</b> with a single stage dose-dependent, the hazard H(t) from any pattern of dosing d(Â·) may be calculated under a constant dosing model using an equivalent constant dose d*(t) which is simply an average of the true dose rate weighted proportionally to the relative effectiveness at each time from 0 to t. The <b>multistage</b> <b>model</b> has the property of scalable relative effectiveness: the relative effectiveness function is the same (except for a rescaling of the time axis) for any time t. In this paper we consider general models with scalable relative effectiveness and arbitrary constant dose hazard functions. Not all such models are valid, and we derive a characterization of those that are: the constant dosing hazard may be proportional to any increasing function k(t) with k(0) = 0, and the relative effectiveness must increase slower than a fixed power of time.

40|$|Lung Cancer {{mortality}} {{associated with}} arsenic trioxide exposure at the Anaconda Smelter was {{studied in the}} context of the <b>multistage</b> <b>model,</b> using a risk difference formulation. Expected lung cancers were based upon a nonsmoking population selected for the contrast it provided for the smoking information. The Anaconda data supported the <b>multistage</b> <b>model</b> used reasonably well but several trends in the data were conflicting, given model predictions. ^ Lung cancer rates were higher as arsenic exposure, smoking habit and duration of employment increased. Mortality increased with increasing age at first exposure when controlled for duration, and increased with time lapsed since exposure ceased as well. These last two patterns indicate different stages of effect within a multistage framework. The observed latency period was long for a late stage carcinogen, though all of the analyses suggested that the late stage model was the best. The results obtained in this analysis are consistent with those of Brown and Chu (1983 a, 1983 b) even with the addition of smoking habit information. ^ Both the stratified and multivariate analyses of the smoking and arsenic data failed to rule out the presence of a multiplicative effect for the two exposures. The data were too sparse to make a judgment with confidence. Lung cancer rates among nonsmokers or light smokers seemed proportionally higher in this population than in others examined. There was evidence of possible confounding between arsenic and smoking in the Anaconda data. ^ The continued inconsistencies in the evidence suggest that a different formulation of a <b>multistage</b> <b>model</b> should be tried for arsenic-associated lung cancer mortality. Others have suggested that the lung retention time is important, and if this is true, it may help explain the continued rise in lung cancer rates despite the cessation of exposure. ^ vi...|$|E

40|$|Metallic alloys have a {{significant}} role in thin-walled engineering structures due to their unique properties such as corrosion resistance, low density or durability. Their mechanical behaviour is usually nonlinear, and this nonlinearity can be further increased during the work-hardening process. In such cases, designers have to take the proper stress-strain relationship into account to obtain reliable prediction of deformations or internal forces. In this paper, a theoretical model is proposed to match different kinds of measured data or already existing stress-strain models. It is flexible to accommodate any number of measured or recommended material parameters, and therefore makes design rules independent on testing standards. It is particularly suitable for computer code implementation. The approximate inversion of the <b>multistage</b> <b>model</b> is also included in the presented study. The general formula is applied on the set of parameters typically available for structural stainless steels in Europe (0. 2 % and 1. 0 % proof strength and ultimate strength) and compared to the existing models by curve-fitting of analytical equations to measured stresses and strains of austenitic, duplex and ferritic stainless steels.

40|$|The {{modeling}} of cohort data {{based on the}} Armitage-Doll <b>multistage</b> <b>model</b> of the carcinogenic process has gained popular acceptance as a methodology for quantitative risk assessment for estimating the dose-related relationships between different occupational and environmental carcinogenic exposures and cancer mortality. The <b>multistage</b> <b>model</b> {{can be used for}} extrapolation to low doses relevant for setting environmental standards and also provides information regarding whether more than one stage is dose-related, which assists in determining whether different carcinogens affect different stages of the cancer process. This paper summarizes recent developments in the multistage {{modeling of}} cohort data and emphasizes practical issues such as handling data arising from large epidemiologic follow-up studies, the time-dependent nature of exposures and statistical issues such as multicollinearity in time-related variables, robustness of parameter estimates, validating of the fitted models, and routine inferential procedures. Problems related to uncertainties of risk estimates are discussed also. Computer programs for fitting multistage models with one or two dose-related stages to cohort data incorporating time-dependent exposure patterns; constructing confidence regions for model parameters; and predicting lifetime risks of dying from cancer adjusting for competing causes of death are detailed.

Methods We analyzed thyroid cancer incidence in the SEER- 9 registry from 1973 - 2010 using multistage carcinogenesis and age-period-cohort <b>models.</b> <b>Multistage</b> <b>models</b> were used to investigate differences in initiation, promotion and malignant conversion rates of thyroid tumors by sex, race, stage, and histology. Models were adjusted for period and cohort trends to investigate the contributions of each factor, and determine whether birth- or diagnosis-year better correlate with observed incidence patterns. Results Significant increases in thyroid cancer incidence by period or calendar-year were found for all sex, race, stage and histology combinations, particularly for localized cases (a 3 - and 4 -fold increase from 1973 - 2010 for females and males, respectively). Multistage analyses suggest that the 3 -fold higher incidence in women {{could be explained by}} 1. 5 -fold higher initiation and promotion rates. Analyses by race suggest that the lower incidence in blacks can be attributed to lower promotion rates versus whites. Analysis by histology showed considerable decreases in follicular cancer incidence by birth-cohort since the early 1900 s. Conclusions <b>Multistage</b> <b>modeling</b> suggests that variations in thyroid cancer initiation and promotion can explain the observed differences in incidence by sex, race and histology. The consistent increases in incidence by calendar-year for all sex-race-histology-stage combinations suggest that the rise may be predominantly due to more intensive screening-diagnostics, although an environmental factor may be also at play.
