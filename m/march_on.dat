5|$|Even {{classical}} historians, {{who were}} writing only {{years after the}} events themselves, seem to be divided {{as to what the}} motives of Spartacus were. Appian and Florus write that he intended to <b>march</b> <b>on</b> Rome itself—although this may have been no more than a reflection of Roman fears. If Spartacus did intend to <b>march</b> <b>on</b> Rome, it was a goal he must have later abandoned. Plutarch writes that Spartacus merely wished to escape northwards into Cisalpine Gaul and disperse his men back to their homes.|$|E
5|$|In 1923, the Nazis felt {{strong enough}} to try to seize power in Munich. They decided to <b>march</b> <b>on</b> the city, {{inspired}} by Benito Mussolini's successful <b>march</b> <b>on</b> Rome. Known as the Beer Hall Putsch, Hitler and his paramilitary Sturmabteilung (SA) troops failed {{to take control of}} Munich. Schaub and other Nazis were arrested and imprisoned with Hitler at Landsberg Prison. After the 1925 reformation of Nazi Party, Schaub became {{a founding member of the}} Schutzstaffel (SS), documented as member #7. In 1943, he was promoted his final rank of SS-Obergruppenführer.|$|E

5|$|The Serbian {{patriotic}} song <b>March</b> <b>on</b> the Drina {{was written}} by Serbian composer Stanislav Binički shortly after the battle to commemorate the victory. Binički dedicated the march to his favourite commander in the army, Colonel Stojanović, who was killed during the fighting. A Yugoslav war film also titled <b>March</b> <b>on</b> the Drina was released in 1964 and is loosely based on the battle.|$|E

Her unit was composed of roughly 280 infantry, 60 cavalry and several hundred peasants armed with war scythes.|$|E

The group sought to restate the Occupy movement's expressed stance against unfettered corporate greed, growing economic inequality and the perceived mainstream media collusion with the dominant political and economic forces.|$|R

5|$|After {{several months}} of stalemate, Philip finally {{advanced}} into Boeotia {{in an attempt to}} <b>march</b> <b>on</b> Thebes and Athens. Opposing him, and blocking the road near Chaeronea, was the allied Greek army, similar in size and occupying a strong position. Details of the ensuing battle are scarce, but after a long fight the Macedonians crushed both flanks of the allied line, which then dissolved into a rout.|$|E
5|$|At the time, {{according}} to German sociologist , Vizzini {{could easily have}} had himself elected as a parliamentary deputy. Nevertheless, he preferred {{to remain in the}} background and instead advise voters and elected officials, playing the role of benevolent benefactor, strengthening his clientele and prestige. He was present at a dinner in July 1922 with the future ruler of Italy, Benito Mussolini, in Milan and supported the <b>March</b> <b>on</b> Rome by Mussolini in October 1922, financing the column that marched from Sicily.|$|E
5|$|Bayard Rustin's open homosexuality, {{support of}} {{democratic}} socialism, {{and his former}} ties to the Communist Party USA caused many white and African-American leaders to demand King distance himself from Rustin, which King agreed to do.

5|$|Before {{reaching}} Italy, Titus learnt that Galba {{had been}} murdered and replaced by Otho, the governor of Lusitania (modern Portugal).

5|$|Despite its post-revolutionary mythology, {{the march}} {{was not a}} {{spontaneous}} event. Numerous calls for a mass demonstration at Versailles had already been made; the Marquis of Saint-Huruge, one of the popular orators of the Palais-Royal, had called for just such a march in August to evict the obstructionist deputies who, he claimed, were protecting the king's veto power. Although his efforts were foiled, revolutionaries continued {{to hold onto the}} idea of a <b>march</b> <b>on</b> Versailles to compel the king to accept the Assembly's laws. Speakers at the Palais-Royal mentioned it regularly throughout the next month, creating enduring suspicions of the proprietor, Louis Philippe II, Duke of Orléans. The idea of a <b>march</b> <b>on</b> Versailles was widespread, and was even discussed {{in the pages of the}} Mercure de France (5 September 1789). A menacing unrest was in the air, and many nobles and foreigners fled the oppressive atmosphere.|$|E
