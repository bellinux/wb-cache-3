5|$|A {{few years}} later, in 1835 his native {{province}} of Rio Grande do Sul was engulfed in a secessionist rebellion, the Ragamuffin War. The conflict lasted for almost ten years, and the Count was leading military engagements for <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>time.</b> He played a decisive role in saving {{the provincial capital}} from the Ragamuffin rebels, allowing forces loyal to the legitimate government to secure a key foothold.

He was awarded a noble title, eventually raised from baron to viscount and finally to count.|$|E
5|$|After delays, {{the voyage}} began on 27 December 1831; it lasted almost five years. As FitzRoy had intended, Darwin spent <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>time</b> on land {{investigating}} geology and making natural history collections, while HMS Beagle surveyed and charted coasts. He kept careful notes of his observations and theoretical speculations, and at intervals during the voyage his specimens {{were sent to}} Cambridge together with letters including {{a copy of his}} journal for his family. He had some expertise in geology, beetle collecting and dissecting marine invertebrates, but in all other areas was a novice and ably collected specimens for expert appraisal. Despite suffering badly from seasickness, Darwin wrote copious notes while on board the ship. Most of his zoology notes are about marine invertebrates, starting with plankton collected in a calm spell.|$|E

The dispute with Aymer was only settled in early 1253. Boniface was once more absent from England from October 1254 to November 1256, and spent <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>time</b> in Savoy where he attempted to help his brothers rescue their eldest brother Thomas who was being held captive at Turin.|$|E
