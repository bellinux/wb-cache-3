In this work, we analyzed the electrophoretic patterns of <b>basic</b> <b>protein</b> extracts, enriched for a number of cell-wall proteins, from bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) seedlings and 21 -d-old plants subjected to water deficit. Three <b>major</b> <b>basic</b> <b>proteins</b> accumulated in bean seedlings exposed to low water potentials, with apparent molecular masses of 36, 33, and 22 kD, which we refer to as p 36, p 33, and p 22, respectively.

In 21 -d-old plants subjected to a fast rate of water loss, both p 33 and p 36 accumulated to approximately the same levels, whereas if the plants were subjected to a gradual loss of water, p 33 accumulated to higher levels. Both p 36 and p 33 were glycosylated and were found in the cell-wall fraction. In contrast, p 22 was not glycosylated and was found in the soluble fraction. The accumulation of these proteins was also induced by abscisic acid (0. 1 - 1. 0 mM) treatment but not by wounding or by jasmonate treatment...|$|R
40|$|Schistosomiasis is {{characterized}} clinically {{by an increase}} in eosinophil counts in bone marrow and peripheral blood. This eosinophil response is also manifest pathologically by cell accumulation around the invading schistosomula and the parasite ova retained in host tissues. The parasites undergo a series of antigenic and maturational changes within the host that result in two distinct peaks of eosinophilia. Furthermore, products of parasite interaction with complement, antibodies, and sensitized T lymphocytes have been shown to enhance eosinophil migration and chemotaxis. Eosinophils, which con-stitute a prominent cellular component in the host response to the schistosomes, may be activated biochemically. Both in vivo and in vitro studies have delineated a protective role for the eosinophils against schistosomula and eggs.

However, in inflammatory conditions including asthma and inflammatory bowel disease, localization of eosinophils to nerves {{is associated with}} nerve plasticity, specifically remodeling. In previous in vitro studies, we have shown that eosinophil adhesion to IMR- 32 nerve cells, via nerve cell intercellular adhesion molecule- 1, results in an adhesion-dependent release of granule proteins. We hypothesized that released eosinophil granule proteins may affect nerve cell signaling and survival, leading to nerve cell remodeling. Culture in serum-deprived media induced apoptosis in IMR- 32 cells that was dose-dependently abolished by inclusion of MBP 1 but not by EDN. Both MBP 1 and EDN induced phosphorylation of Akt, but with divergent time courses and intensities, and survival was independent of Akt. MBP 1 induced activation of neural nuclear factor (NF) -�B, from 10 min to 12 h, declining by 24 h, whereas EDN induced a short-lived activation of NF-�B. MBP 1 induced protection was dependent on phosphorylation of ERK 1 / 2 and was related to a phospho-ERK-dependent upregulation of the NF-�B–activated anti-apoptotic gene, Bfl- 1. This signaling pathway was not activated by EDN. Thus, MBP 1 released from eosinophils at inflammatory sites may regulate peripheral nerve plasticity by inhibiting apoptosis...|$|R

40|$|A new {{technique}} is described to identify antigenically related proteins by radioimmunoassay after sodium dodecyl sulfate/polyacrylamide gel fractionation. When adult mouse myelin was examined by this technique, four proteins that are antigenically {{related to the}} small myelin <b>basic</b> <b>protein</b> were identified. They were designated: prelarge (molecular weight 21, 500), large (18, 500), presmall (17, 000), and small (14, 000). The four proteins were isolated by elution from polyacrylamide gels, and each protein migrated as a single band when analyzed by either sodium dodecyl sulfate or acidic polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Serial dilutions of the purified proteins were measured by radioimmunoassay. Both {{the slope of the}} inhibition curve and the level of maximal inhibition for each protein were the same as for the small myelin <b>basic</b> <b>protein,</b> indicating that each of the four proteins contains all of the antigenic sites present in the small <b>basic</b> <b>protein.</b> Structural relationships among the four proteins were examined by using two-dimensional analysis of tryptic digests.

The four proteins were also treated with 2 -(2 -nitrophenylsulfenyl) - 3 -methyl- 3 ′-bromoindolienine (BNPS-skatole) which cleaves proteins specifically at tryptophan residues.

This effect of MBP on neurons was basicity-dependent because the binding was blocked by acidic lipids and competed by other <b>basic</b> <b>proteins.</b> Further studies revealed that MBP induced damage to neuronal membrane integrity and function by depolarizing the resting membrane potential, increasing the permeability to cations and other molecules, and decreasing the membrane fluidity. At last, artificial liposome vesicle assay showed that MBP directly disturbed acidic lipid bilayer and resulted in increased membrane permeability.

40|$|AbstractThe {{advances}} {{over the}} last 10  years on the understanding of myelin heterogeneity are reviewed. The main {{focus is on the}} applicability of Langmuir monolayers, Langmuir–Blodgett films and some associated techniques to unravelling the behaviour of interfaces formed with all the components of a natural membrane. Lipid–protein lateral segregation appears as a major driving force to determine surface patterns that can change under compression from circular domains to two-dimensional fractal structures. The major proteins of the myelin membrane induce lateral segregation in an otherwise homogeneous surface formed by the mixture of total myelin lipids. The lipid and protein components appear to distribute in the surface domains according to their charge, compressibility and relative molecular weight: myelin proteins, ganglioside GM 1 and fluorescent lipid probes partition into liquid-expanded phase domains; other components such as phosphatidylserine and galactocerebroside partition into another liquid phase enriched in cholesterol. Simplified protein–lipid mixtures allow assessment of the participation of the major proteins in the two dimensional pattern development. One of the major myelin proteins, the Folch–Lees proteolipid, self-segregates into, and determines formation of, fractal-like patterns. The presence of the second <b>major</b> <b>protein,</b> myelin <b>basic</b> <b>protein,</b> leads to round liquid-expanded domains in the absence of Folch–Lees proteolipid and softens the boundaries of the fractal structures in its presence.

40|$|<b>Major</b> <b>basic</b> <b>protein,</b> {{the primary}} {{constituent}} of eosinophil granules, regulates the alternative and classical pathways of complement. <b>Major</b> <b>basic</b> <b>protein</b> and other eosinophil granule cationic proteins, which {{are important in}} mediating tissue damage in allergic disease, regulate the alternative pathway by interfering with C 3 b interaction with factor B to assemble an alternative pathway C 3 convertase. In the present study, eosinophil peroxidase, eosinophil cationic protein and eosinophil-derived neurotoxin, as well as <b>major</b> <b>basic</b> <b>protein,</b> were examined for capacity to regulate the classical pathway. Eosinophil peroxidase, eosinophil cationic protein and <b>major</b> <b>basic</b> <b>protein</b> inhibited formation of cell-bound classical pathway C 3 convertase (EAC 1, 4 b, 2 a), causing 50 % inhibition of complement-mediated lysis at about 0. 19, 0. 75 and 0. 5 micrograms/ 10 (7) cellular intermediates, respectively. Eosinophil-derived neurotoxin had no activity on this pathway of complement. The eosinophil granule proteins were examined for activity on {{the formation of the}} membrane attack complex. <b>Major</b> <b>basic</b> <b>protein</b> and eosinophil cationic protein had no activity on terminal lysis. In contrast, eosinophil peroxidase inhibited lysis of EAC 1, 4 b, 2 a, 3 b, 5 b, but had only minimal activity on later events in complement lysis. These polycations were then examined to determine the site(s) at which they regulated the early classical pathway. Eosinophil granule polycationic proteins: (1) reduced the Zmax at all time points but had only minimal effect on the Tmax during the formation of the classical pathway C 3 convertase (EAC 1, 4 b, 2 a); (2) inhibited formation of EAC 1, 4 b, 2 a proportional to C 4 but independent of C 2 concentration; (3) inhibited fluid phase formation of C 1, 4 b, 2 a, as reflected by a decrease in C 1 -induced consumption of C 2 over time; and (4) inhibited C 1 activity over time without a direct effect on either C 4 or C 2. These observations suggest that polycations regulate the early classical pathway by interfering with C 1 and may exert this activity in vivo...|$|E
40|$|Passive {{transfer}} of {{experimental allergic encephalomyelitis}} (EAE) was performed with lymph node cells from donor rats immunized with spinal cord or purified encephalitogenic <b>basic</b> <b>protein</b> and any of several adjuvant combinations. Transfer was inhibited by injection of recipients with the brain <b>basic</b> <b>protein.</b> <b>Basic</b> <b>proteins</b> from rat and guinea-pig CNS inhibited transfer from donors immunized with rat or guinea-pig spinal cord or <b>basic</b> <b>protein.</b> Monkey <b>basic</b> <b>protein</b> inhibited transfer from donors immunized with monkey or human cord. There was only partial cross-inhibition between rodent and primate groups. The inhibition was organ specific in that <b>basic</b> <b>proteins</b> from lung, spleen and adrenal did not inhibit {{transfer of}} EAE.

40|$|Degradation of myelin <b>basic</b> <b>protein</b> during incubations {{with high}} {{concentrations}} of horseradish peroxidase has been demonstrated [Johnson & Cammer (1977) J. Histochem. Cytochem. 25, 329 – 336]. Possible mechanisms for {{the interaction of the}} <b>basic</b> <b>protein</b> with peroxidase were investigated in the present study. Because the peroxidase samples previously observed to degrade <b>basic</b> <b>protein</b> were mixtures of isoenzymes, commercial preparations of the separated isoenzymes were tested, and all three degraded <b>basic</b> <b>protein,</b> but to various extents. Three other <b>basic</b> <b>proteins,</b> P 2 protein from peripheral nerve myelin, lysozyme and cytochrome c, were not degraded by horseradish peroxidase under the same conditions. Inhibitor studies suggested a minor peroxidatic component in the reaction. Therefore the peroxidatic reaction with <b>basic</b> <b>protein</b> was studied by using low concentrations of peroxidase along with H 2 O 2. Horseradish peroxidase plus H 2 O 2 caused the destruction of <b>basic</b> <b>protein,</b> a reaction inhibited by cyanide, azide, ferrocyanide, tyrosine, di-iodotyrosine and catalase. Lactoperoxidase plus H 2 O 2 and myoglobin plus H 2 O 2 were also effective in destroying the myelin <b>basic</b> <b>protein.</b> Low concentrations of horseradish peroxidase plus H 2 O 2 were not active against other <b>basic</b> <b>proteins,</b> but did destroy casein and fibrinogen. Although {{high concentrations of}} peroxidase alone degraded <b>basic</b> <b>protein</b> to low-molecular-weight products, suggesting the operation of a proteolytic enzyme contaminant in the absence of H 2 O 2, incubations with catalytic concentrations of peroxidase in the presence of H 2 O 2 converted <b>basic</b> <b>protein</b> into products with high molecular weights. Our data suggest a mechanism for the latter, peroxidatic, reaction where polymers would form by linking the tyrosine side chains in basic-protein molecules. These data show that the myelin <b>basic</b> <b>protein</b> is unusually susceptible to peroxidatic reactions...|$|R
