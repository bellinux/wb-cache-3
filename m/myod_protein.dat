50|$|As stated earlier, the {{combination}} of Myf5 and MyoD {{is crucial to the}} success of myogenesis. Both MyoD and Myf5 are members of the myogenic bHLH (basic helix-loop-helix) proteins transcription factor family. Cells that make myogenic bHLH transcription factors (including MyoD or Myf5) are committed to development as a muscle cell. Consequently, the simultaneous deletion of Myf5 and MyoD also results in a complete lack of skeletal muscle formation. Research has shown that MyoD directly activates its own gene; this means that the protein made binds the myoD gene and continues a cycle of <b>MyoD</b> <b>protein</b> production. Meanwhile, Myf5 expression is regulated by Sonic hedgehog, Wnt1, and MyoD itself. By noting the role of MyoD in regulating Myf5, the crucial interconnectedness of the two genetic factors becomes clear.|$|E
50|$|MyoD was cloned by {{an ingenious}} {{functional}} assay for muscle formation reported in Cell in 1987 by Davis, Weintraub, and Lassar. It was first {{described as a}} nuclear phosphoprotein in 1988 by Tapscott, Davis, Thayer, Cheng, Weintraub, and Lassar in Science. The researchers expressed the complementary DNA (cDNA) of the murine <b>MyoD</b> <b>protein</b> in a different cell lines (fibroblast and adipoblast) and found MyoD converted them to myogenic cells. The following year, the same research team performed several tests to determine both the structure and function of the protein, confirming their initial proposal that the active site of the protein consisted of the helix loop helix (now referred to as basic helix loop helix) for dimerization and a basic site upstream of this bHLH region facilitated DNA binding only once it became a protein dimer. MyoD has since been an active area of research as still relatively little is known concerning many aspects of its function.|$|E

Here we report the distribution of <b>MyoD</b> 1 <b>protein,</b> determined by reactivity with anti-MyoD 1 polyclonal sera in normal tissues, rhabdomyosarcoma cell lines, and {{in a variety of}} pediatric solid tumors. The distribution of <b>MyoD</b> 1 <b>protein</b> was highly restricted in normal tissues and was detected only in fetal skeletal muscle and more faintly in adult skeletal muscle. All six human rhabdomyosarcoma cell lines analyzed expressed MyoD 1 mRNA transcripts as well as immunoreactive protein. The immunohistochemical expression of <b>MyoD</b> 1 <b>protein</b> was then examined in 49 surgical specimens from a variety of pediatric solid tumors. Each of 16 rhabdomyosarcoma specimens was positive for MyoD 1, including four that did not express the intermediate filament protein desmin. Two of five specimens originally designated sarcoma type indeterminate (STI) and two of three specimens originally designated extraosseous Ewing's sarcoma (EOE) were positive for MyoD 1, suggesting commitment to myogenic differentiation. Three of eight Wilms' tumors, which also expressed desmin and had clearly evident myogenic elements, also were positive for MyoD 1. Tumors that failed to express <b>MyoD</b> 1 <b>protein</b> included neuroblastoma, primitive neuroectodermal tumor, non-Hodgkins lymphoma, embryonal sarcoma of the liver, malignant fibrous histiocytoma, malignant rhabdoid tumor, and Ewing's sarcoma of the bone. These results indicate that expression of <b>MyoD</b> 1 <b>protein</b> is highly restricted in normal human tissues and that expression of this gene product in malignant tissue may be diagnostic for rhabdomyosarcoma.

40|$|The {{accumulation}} of two myogenic regulatory <b>proteins,</b> <b>MyoD</b> and myogenin, was investigated by double-immunocytochemistry and correlated with myosin heavy chain expression in different classes of myoblasts in culture and during early myogenesis in vivo. During in vitro differentiation of fetal myoblasts, MyoD-positive cells were detected first, {{followed by the}} appearance of cells positive for both MyoD and myogenin and finally {{by the appearance of}} differentiated myocytes and myotubes expressing myosin heavy chain (MHC). A similar pattern of expression was observed in cultures of embryonic and satellite cells. In contrast, most myogenic cells isolated from newly formed somites, expressed MHC in the absence of detectable levels of myogenin or MyoD. In vivo, the appearance of both myogenin and <b>MyoD</b> <b>proteins</b> was only detected at 10. 5 d postcoitum (d. p. c.), when terminally differentiated muscle cells could already be identified in the myotome. Parasagittal sections of the caudal myotomes of 10. 5 -d-old embryos showed that expression of contractile proteins preceded the expression of myogenin or MyoD and, when coexpressed, MHC and myogenin did not co-localize within all the cells of the myotome. In the limb bud, however, many myogenin (or MyoD) positive/MHC negative cells could be observed in the proximal region at day 11. During further embryonic development the expression of these proteins remained constant in all the muscle anlagens examined, decreasing to a low level during the late fetal period. Western and Northern analysis confirmed that the myogenin protein could only be detected after 10. 5 d. p. c. while the corresponding message was clearly present at 9. 5 d. p. c., strongly suggesting a posttranscriptional regulation of myogenin during this stage of embryonic development. These data show that the first myogenic cells which appear in the mouse myotome, and can be cultured from it, accumulate muscle structural proteins in their cytoplasm without expressing detectable levels of myogenin protein (although the message is clearly accumulated).

40|$|MyoD, {{a member}} of the family of helix-loop-helix myogenic factors that plays a crucial role in {{skeletal}} muscle differentiation, is a nuclear phosphoprotein. Using microinjection of purified <b>MyoD</b> <b>protein</b> into rat fibroblasts, we show that the nuclear import of MyoD is a rapid and active process, being ATP and temperature dependent. Two nuclear localization signals (NLSs), one present in the basic region and the other in the helix 1 domain of <b>MyoD</b> <b>protein,</b> are demonstrated to be functional in promoting the active nuclear transport of MyoD. Synthetic peptides spanning these two NLSs and biochemically coupled to IgGs can promote the nuclear import of microinjected IgG conjugates in muscle and nonmuscle cells. Deletion analysis reveals that each sequence can function independently within the <b>MyoD</b> <b>protein</b> since concomittant deletion of both sequences is required to alter the nuclear import of this myogenic factor. In addition, the complete cytoplasmic retention of a beta-galactosidase-MyoD fusion mutant protein, double deleted at these two NLSs, argues against the existence of another functional NLS motif in MyoD...|$|E
40|$|In {{studying}} the mechanism {{through which the}} myogenic determination protein MyoD prevents entry into the S phase of the cell cycle, we have found a relationship between MyoD and the retinoblastoma (Rb) tumor suppressor protein. By direct needle microinjection of purified recombinant <b>MyoD</b> <b>protein</b> into quiescent fibroblasts, which were then induced to proliferate by serum, we found that MyoD arrested progression of the cell cycle, in agreement with studies utilizing expression constructs for MyoD. By studying temporal changes in cells injected with <b>MyoD</b> <b>protein,</b> {{it was found that}} MyoD did not prevent serum induced expression of the protooncogene c-Fos, an event that occurs in the G 0 to G 1 transition of the cycle.

40|$|We {{previously}} reported {{the isolation of}} several complementary DNAs from Xenopus Iaevis that encode distinct <b>MyoD</b> <b>proteins.</b> Two of these genes, XImfl and X 1 mf 25, appear to represent a gene duplication {{as a consequence of}} the polyploid Xenopus genome. Although both MyoD genes are expressed exclusively in skeletal muscle in adult animals, they have very different temporal patterns of expression in early development. In the present work, we show that XImfl transcripts rapidly accumulated to high levels shortly after activation of the zygotic genome at the midblastula transition. In contrast, X 1 mf 25 was expressed as a maternal transcript that was maintained at a relatively constant level throughout early development. X 1 mf 25, like XImfl, was capable of converting 1011 / 2 fibroblasts to a myogenic phenotype. In addition, both proteins directly trans-activated reporter genes linked to muscle-specific regulatory elements. XImfl was twice as active in this regard as X 1 mf 25 and required a carboxy-terminal domain for its function. The absence of apparent effect of the maternally expressed myogenic gene in early embryos, but not in transfected fibroblasts, suggests the existence of regulatory mechanisms that repress the function of this gene in cells with nonmuscle fates during early amphibian development...|$|R

The disulfide-stabilized helix from apamin served as a nucleus for a helix that extended for a further ten residues, thereby holding apaMyoD's DNA recognition helix in a predominantly α-helical conformation. The thermal stability of the DNA complexes of apaMyoD was increased by 13 °C relative to MyoD-bHLH. Measurements of the fluorescence anisotropy change on DNA binding indicated that apaMyoD bound to E-box-containing DNA sequences with enhanced affinity relative to MyoD-bHLH.

40|$|AbstractThe myogenic b-HLH {{transcription}} factor MyoD activates expression of muscle-specific genes and autoregulates positively its own expression. Various {{factors such as}} growth factors and oncogene products repress transcriptional activity of MyoD. The c-mos proto-oncogene product, Mos, is a serine/threonine kinase that can activate myogenic differentiation by specific phosphorylation of MyoD which favors heterodimerization of MyoD and E 12 proteins. Here we show that overexpression of Mos enhances the expression level of <b>MyoD</b> <b>protein</b> in myoblasts although phosphorylation of MyoD by Mos does not modify its stability but promotes transcriptional transactivation of the MyoD promoter linked to the luciferase reporter gene. Moreover, co-expression of MyoD with Moswt {{but not with the}} kinase-inactive MosKM greatly enhances expression of endogenous <b>MyoD</b> <b>protein</b> and the DNA binding activity of MyoD/E 12 heterodimers in 10 T 1 / 2 cells.

40|$|MyoD {{is a basic}} helix-loop-helix {{transcription}} factor involved in the activation of genes encoding skeletal muscle-specific proteins. Independent {{of its ability to}} transactivate muscle-specific genes, MyoD can also act as a cell cycle inhibitor. MyoD activity is regulated by transcriptional and posttranscriptional mechanisms. While MyoD can be found phosphorylated, the functional significance of this posttranslation modification has not been established. MyoD contains several consensus cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) phosphorylation sites. In these studies, we examined whether a link could be established between MyoD activity and phosphorylation at putative CDK sites. Site-directed mutagenesis of potential CDK phosphorylation sites in MyoD revealed that S 200 is required for MyoD hyperphosphorylation as well as the normally short half-life of the <b>MyoD</b> <b>protein.</b> Additionally, we determined that turnover of the <b>MyoD</b> <b>protein</b> requires the proteasome and Cdc 34 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme activity. Results of these studies demonstrate that hyperphosphorylated MyoD is targeted for rapid degradation by the ubiquitin pathway. The targeted degradation of MyoD following CDK phosphorylation identifies a mechanism through which MyoD activity can be regulated coordinately with the cell cycle machinery (CDK 2 and CDK 4) and/or coordinately with the cellular transcriptional machinery (CDK 7, CDK 8, and CDK 9) ...|$|E

40|$|We {{show that}} in mouse myoblasts the MyoD 1 {{promoter}} is highly stimulated by MyoD 1 expression, suggesting that it is controlled by a positive feedback loop. Using deletion and mutation analyses, we identified the targets for MyoD 1 promoter autoregulation as the two proximal E-boxes located close to the MyoD 1 core promoter. Gel mobility shift competition assays with MyoD 1 antibodies as competitor suggest that the <b>MyoD</b> 1 <b>protein</b> is binding directly to these E-boxes. Autoregulation did not occur in fibroblasts cotransfected with the expression vector of MyoD 1. It is assumed that autoregulation {{is controlled by the}} stoichiometry between the <b>MyoD</b> 1 <b>protein</b> and negatively regulatory proteins like Id, which is known to be highly expressed in fibroblasts. When the MyoD 1 promoter was methylated, autoregulation only occurred when the density of methylated sites was low. The density of DNA methylation, therefore, can determine the accessibility of the MyoD 1 promoter to transcription factors and interfere with the auto- and crossregulatory loop. The MyoD 1 promoter in vivo was found to be only partially methylated in all tissues tested except in skeletal muscle where it was demethylated. We propose that high level expression of the MyoD 1 gene is a result of release from constraints such as negative regulatory factors and/or DNA methylation interfering with MyoD 1 autoregulation...|$|R

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Muscle biopsies (m. vastus lateralis) were taken in 14 hospitalised COPD patients (aged 68 +/- 8), 11 clinically stable COPD patients (aged 68 +/- 9) and seven healthy subjects (aged 70 +/- 7) to analyse local mRNA expression levels of IL- 6, IL- 8, TNF-alpha, IGF-I and protein expression levels of IGF-I, MyoD and myogenin. Relationships of these expression levels with lung and skeletal muscle function were investigated. RESULTS: IGF-I mRNA and <b>MyoD</b> <b>protein</b> levels were significantly lower in hospitalised patients compared to healthy subjects. <b>MyoD</b> <b>protein</b> levels were positively related to quadriceps force. Muscle IL- 6 and IL- 8 expression in hospitalised patients was similar compared to stable patients and healthy subjects and was not related to expression levels of muscle markers of disuse or quadriceps force.

Therefore, understanding the molecular control of muscle fiber plasticity is a critical step toward improving the production of high quality pork. The objectives of these studies were to test in vivo the recent hypothesis suggesting that the myogenic regulator factor myogenin and the serine/threonine phosphatase calcineurin (CaN) control muscle fiber phenotype. The full-length porcine CaN delta isoform catalytic subunit gene (GenBank accession number AF 193515) was cloned and CaN expression was characterized in several adult muscles. Surprisingly, we detected by northern blot a novel 5. 2 kb mRNA transcript and have shown that CaN mRNA isoform expression is greatest in fast muscles. Using immunohistochemistry, we have shown that CaN protein is mainly localization in cytoplasm of fast fibers. The effects of myogenin and calcineurin overexpression on muscle fiber phenotype was studied using direct DNA injection technology. First plasmid DNA encoding for epitope-tagged porcine myogenin and mouse <b>MyoD</b> <b>proteins</b> was injected in fast skeletal muscles of 10 -day-old piglet (n = 6). At day 3, 10 and 17, piglets were euthanized and injected muscles were collected.

However, strongly staining succinate dehydrogenase was detected specifically in myogenin positive fibers. Therefore, myogenin may participate in controlling metabolism shifts in muscle metabolism. Plasmid DNA encoding myc epitope-tagged constitutively active form of CaN was also injected into pig muscle. Control plasmid DNA containing sequences encoding for the green fluorescent protein (GFP) were also injected into fast piglet muscle. Injected muscle samples were collected at 3, 10 and 17 days post-injection. Positive myc-transfected fibers were observed only a day 3 post-injection, whereas GFP positive fibers were observed until 17 days post-injection. Conclusive evidence regarding the role of calcineurin in controlling skeletal muscle fiber type were not possible. However, data suggest that overexpression of calcineurin may trigger apoptosis. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{accumulation}} of two myogenic regulatory <b>proteins,</b> <b>MyoD</b> and myogenin, was investigated by double-immunocytochemistry and correlated with myosin heavy chain expression in different classes of myoblasts in culture and during early myogenesis in vivo. During in vitro differentiation of fetal myoblasts, MyoD-positive cells were detected first, {{followed by the}} appearance of cells positive for both MyoD and myogenin and finally {{by the appearance of}} differentiated myocytes and myotubes expressing myosin heavy chain (MHC). A similar pattern of expression was observed in cultures of embryonic and satellite cells. In contrast, most myogenic cells isolated from newly formed somites, expressed MHC in the absence of detectabl...|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} we have {{developed}} bioluminescence-imaging strategies to noninvasively and quantitatively image protein—protein interactions in living mice by using a cooled charge-coupled device camera and split reporter technology. We validate both complementation and intein-mediated reconstitution of split firefly luciferase proteins driven by the interaction of two strongly interacting <b>proteins,</b> <b>MyoD</b> and Id. We use transient transfection of cells and image MyoD–Id interaction after induction of gene expression in cell culture and in cells implanted into living mice. Techniques to study protein–protein interactions in living subjects will allow the study of cellular networks, including signal transduction pathways, as well as development and optimization of pharmaceuticals for modulating protein–protein interactions...|$|R
40|$|AbstractDifferentiation often {{requires}} conversion of analogue signals to a stable binary output through positive feedback. Hedgehog (Hh) signalling promotes myogenesis in the vertebrate somite, {{in part by}} raising the activity of muscle regulatory factors (MRFs) of the Myod family above a threshold. Hh is known to enhance MRF expression. Here we show that Hh is also essential at a second step that increases <b>Myod</b> <b>protein</b> activity, permitting it to promote Myogenin expression. Hh acts by inducing expression of cdkn 1 c (p 57 Kip 2) in slow muscle precursor cells, but neither Hh nor Cdkn 1 c is required for their cell cycle exit. Cdkn 1 c co-operates with Myod to drive differentiation of several early zebrafish muscle fibre types. Myod in turn up-regulates cdkn 1 c, thereby providing a positive feedback loop that switches myogenic cells to terminal differentiation...|$|E
40|$|The {{transcription}} factor Pax 7 negatively regulates {{the activity of}} the muscle regulatory {{transcription factor}} MyoD, preventing muscle precursor cells from undergoing terminal differentiation. In this context, the ratio between Pax 7 and <b>MyoD</b> <b>protein</b> levels is thought to be critical in allowing myogenesis to proceed or to maintain the undifferentiated muscle precursor state. We have previously shown that Pax 7 is subject to rapid down regulation in differentiating myoblasts, via a proteasome-dependent pathway. Here we present evidence indicating that Pax 7 is also subject to caspase- 3 -dependent regulation. Furthermore, simultaneous inhibition of caspase- 3 and proteasome activity induced further accumulation of Pax 7 protein in differentiating myoblasts. These results suggest that at early stages of muscle differentiation, Pax 7 levels are regulated by at least two independent mechanisms involving caspase- 3 and proteasome activity...|$|E
40|$|SummaryMyogenic microRNAs (myomiRs) {{that are}} {{specifically}} expressed in cardiac and skeletal muscle are highly relevant to myogenic development and diseases. Discovery and elucidation of unknown myomiRs-involved regulatory pathways in muscle cells are important, but challenging {{due to the}} lack of proper molecular tools. We report here a miR- 221 / 222 -myoD-myomiRs regulatory pathway revealed by using a small-molecule probe that selectively inhibits myomiRs including miR- 1, miR- 133 a, and miR- 206. The small-molecule inhibitor screened from luciferase assay systems was found to inhibit myomiRs and differentiation of C 2 C 12 cells. Using the small molecule as a probe, we found that the transcriptional factor myoD, which is upstream of myomiRs, was further regulated by miR- 221 / 222. This miR- 221 / 222 -myoD-myomiRs regulatory pathway was confirmed by over-expressing or knockdown miR- 221 / 222 in muscle cells, which respectively led to the inhibition or enhancement of <b>myoD</b> <b>protein</b> expression and subsequent downregulation or upregulation of myomiR expression...|$|E
40|$|The {{oncogene}} p 3 k, coding for a constitutively active form of phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase (PI 3 -kinase; EC 2. 7. 1. 137), strongly enhances myogenic differentiation in {{cultures of}} chicken-embryo myoblasts. It increases {{the size of}} the myotubes and induces elevated levels of the muscle-specific <b>proteins</b> <b>MyoD,</b> myosin heavy chain, creatine kinase, and desmin. Inhibition of PI 3 -kinase activity with LY 294002 or with dominant-negative mutants of PI 3 -kinase interferes with myogenic differentiation and with the induction of muscle-specific genes. PI 3 -kinase is therefore an upstream mediator for the expression of the muscle-specific genes and is both necessary and rate-limiting for the process of myogenesis...|$|R
40|$|ROR/RZR is {{an orphan}} nuclear {{receptor}} {{that has no}} known ligand in the 2 ̆ 7 classical sense 2 ̆ 7. In the present study we demonstrate that RORalpha is constitutively expressed during the differentiation of proliferating myoblasts to post-mitotic multinucleated myotubes, that have acquired a contractile phenotype. Exogenous expression of dominant negative RORalpha 1 DeltaE mRNA in myogenic cells significantly reduces the endogenous expression of RORalpha 1 mRNA, represses the accumu-lation and delays the activation of mRNAs encoding MyoD and myogenin [the muscle-specific basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) proteins] and p 21 (Waf- 1 /Cip- 1) (a cdk inhibitor). Immunohistochemistry demonstrates that morpho-logical differentiation is delayed in cells expressing the RORDeltaE transcript. Furthermore, the size and development of mutlinucleated myotubes is impaired. The E region of RORalpha 1 interacts with p 300, a cofactor that functions as a coactivator in nuclear receptor and MyoD-mediated transactivation. Consistent with the functional role of RORalpha 1 in myogenesis, we observed that RORalpha 1 directly interacts with the bHLH <b>protein</b> <b>MyoD.</b> This interaction was mediated by the N-terminal activation domain of the bHLH <b>protein,</b> <b>MyoD,</b> and the RORalpha 1 DNA binding domain/C region. Furthermore, we demonstrated that p 300, RORalpha 1 and MyoD interact in a non- competitive manner. In conclusion, this study provides evidence for a biological role and positive influence of RORalpha 1 in the cascade of events involved in the activation of myogenic-specific markers and cell cycle regulators and suggests that crosstalk between theretinoid- relatedorphan (ROR) nuclear receptors and the myogenic bHLH proteins has functional consequences for differentiation...|$|R
40|$|To {{study the}} protein-protein {{interactions}} that allow Id, a negative regulator of cell differentiation, to inhibit the DNA-binding activities of MyoD and E 47, we have synthesized peptides {{corresponding to the}} helix-loop-helix domains of MyoD, E 47, and Id. We show that Id preferentially inhibits the sequence-specific DNA-binding activity of <b>MyoD,</b> a muscle-specific <b>protein,</b> as compared to E 47, a more ubiquitous protein. The Id helix-loop-helix domain itself forms stable tetramers, and its inhibitory activity arises from {{the formation of a}} heterotetrameric structure with MyoD. The formation of this higher order complex provides a general mechanism by which inhibitory proteins can generate sufficient interaction free energy to overcome the large DNA-binding free energy of dimeric DNA-binding proteins...|$|R
