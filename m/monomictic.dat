2500|$|Based upon thermal stratification, lakes are {{classified}} as either holomictic lakes or meromictic lakes. A meromictic lake is a lake which has layers of water which do not intermix.

In addition, the [...] layers of sediment {{at the bottom of}} a meromictic lake remain relatively undisturbed because there are no living aerobic organisms. The lack of disturbance allows for the development of lacustrine varves. A Holomictic lake is a lake that has a uniform temperature and density from top to bottom at a specific time during the year. This uniformity temperature and density in allows the lake waters to completely mix. Holomictic lakes are non-meromictic lakes. Based upon thermal stratification and frequency of turnover, holomictic lakes are divided into amictic lakes, cold <b>monomictic</b> lakes, dimictic lakes, warm <b>monomictic</b> lakes, polymictic lakes, and oligomictic lakes.

5000|$|... ==Cold <b>monomictic</b> lakes== Cold <b>monomictic</b> lakes are lakes {{that are}} covered by ice {{throughout}} much of the year. During their brief [...] "summer", the surface waters remain at, or below, 4 °C. The ice prevents these lakes from mixing in winter. During summer, these lakes lack significant thermal stratification, and they mix thoroughly from top to bottom. These lakes are typical of cold climate regions (e.g. much of the Arctic).|$|E

50|$|Lake Berryessa is a <b>monomictic</b> lake, {{which means}} that the waters of the lake {{turnover}} once a year. For <b>monomictic</b> lakes that turnover time is somewhere in the Fall. Lake turnover happens when the warmer surface water starts to cool to match the lower cooler water. Once the lake is all the same temperature, water can freely circulate all around and oxygen replenishes parts of the water where it has been diminished. Fishing during the turnover time or after can be difficult because the monotone temperature and oxygen level of the lake allows for the fish to go anywhere in the lake.|$|E
50|$|Most lakes are holomictic; {{meromictic}} lakes are rare, {{although they}} may be less rare than commonly thought. There are four types of holomictic lakes: oligomictic lakes, polymictic lakes, <b>monomictic</b> lakes, and dimictic lakes.|$|E

50|$|Having only {{a single}} season of free circulation, the lake is <b>monomictic,</b> and water passes through Lago Huiñaimarca and flows out the single outlet at the Río Desaguadero, which then flows south through Bolivia to Lake Poopó. This only {{accounts}} for about 10% of the lake's water balance. Evapotranspiration, caused by strong winds and intense sunlight at high altitude, balances the remaining 90% of the water loss. It is nearly a closed lake.|$|E
50|$|Most lakes are holomictic; that is, {{at least}} once per year, {{physical}} mixing occurs between the surface and the deep waters. In so-called <b>monomictic</b> lakes, the mixing occurs once per year; in dimictic lakes, the mixing occurs twice a year (typically spring and autumn), and in polymictic lakes, the mixing occurs several times a year.

50|$|Warm <b>monomictic</b> lakes are lakes {{that never}} freeze, and are {{thermally}} stratified {{throughout much of}} the year. The density difference between the warm surface waters (the epilimnion) and the colder bottom waters (the hypolimnion) prevents these lakes from mixing in summer. During winter, the surface waters cool to a temperature equal to the bottom waters. Lacking significant thermal stratification, these lakes mix thoroughly each winter from top to bottom. These lakes are widely distributed from temperate to tropical climatic regions. One example is South Australia's Blue Lake, where the change in circulation is signaled by a striking change in colour.|$|E

5000|$|Lake Whatcom is a <b>monomictic</b> lake. The {{water body}} is {{stratified}} {{for part of}} the year (late spring through mid-fall) and mixed during the rest. This phenomenon is important to the hydrology of the lake. The top layer of water (epilimnion) is warmed by the sun and sits atop the metalimnion (also a thermocline). In this middle layer water temperatures take a pronounced decline and eventually a distinct third layer forms (hypolimnion), much colder and isolated {{from the rest of the}} water body. Minimal oxygen from the air diffuses down to the hypolimnion, causing very low dissolved oxygen (DO) levels. This combined with sediment oxidation, cause for near or complete anoxic conditions in the deeper levels of the lake. This stratification is more pronounced in Basin 3 where water is deepest. This layering of the lake, as well as the distinct physical barriers (sills) between basins cause for slow movement of water through the lake. (Ecology TMDL, 2008) ...|$|E
40|$|This study {{focuses on}} facies analysis, geochemistry, geochronology and tectonic {{significance}} of the Ural Volcanics (UV) and Mount Hope Volcanics (MEV) in the Central Lachlan Orogen in New South Wales. The UV and MHV overlie non-volcanic sedimentary, below wave base, submarine facies within two intracontinental rift basins, the Rast and Mount Hope Troughs. The UV and MHV consist primarily of felsic, coherent facies and associated felsic <b>monomictic</b> breccia facies. These volcanic facies are interpreted to represent submarine lava-sill complexes, which define intrabasinal, effusive, volcanic and shallow intrusive centres. The lTV include at least 35 separate lava or sill emplacement units that amount to 10 km 3 In the MHY, at least 18 lavas and sills are present, and have thicknesses up to 120 m.

This facies is interpreted to form from water-settled sediment deposited between lava clasts, and must therefore occur on the upper margin of a lava. The presence of conformable, continuous laminae helps to distinguish this facies from peperite. Hence, correct identification of the siltstone-matrix <b>monomictic</b> breccia facies is critical in distinguishing lavas from sills.

40|$|Stable carbon isotopic {{analysis}} was performed on sedimentary biomarkers of a shallow sulfide-rich <b>monomictic</b> lake, Lake Cisó (NE Spain). Specific biomarkers derived from phototrophic sulfur bacteria in Lake Cisó were considerably depleted in 13 C, most likely due to the depleted 13 C-content of the dissolved inorganic carbon that was photosynthetically fixed. Recycling of respired CO 2, a well-known phenomenon in <b>monomictic</b> lakes, probably caused this depletion. The stable carbon isotopic composition of terrestrial markers, such as C 25 33 odd-carbon-numbered n-alkanes and C 22 30 even-carbon-numbered n-alkan- 1 -ols and fatty acids, were rather similar {{to each other and}} their 13 C depleted values (c. − 31 to − 35) indicated that they were derived from the surrounding vegetation.

40|$|Abstract. Temporal {{changes in}} {{phytoplankton}} quality composition, structure, numbers and biomass were investigated at the warm <b>monomictic</b> Yasna Polyana Reservoir {{over a period}} of ten years (1979 – 1989). A total of 108 taxa were encountered. Green algae, followed by diatoms, were the richest in species, while in respect to biomass the main algal groups were diatoms and dinoflagellates. Community structure and dominant composition were low changeable throughout the period of study, with Cyclotella sp., Peridinea sp. and Ceratium hirundinella as the leading taxa. Phytoplankton numerical abundance ranged from 11. 103 to 4296. 103 ind. l- 1 and biomass from 0. 05 – 16. 5 mg l- 1, respectively. In terms of the phytoplankton biomass, the reservoir was determined as oligomesotrophic and the phytoplankton was found to be phosphorus-limited.
