50|$|The glucosinolates {{are natural}} {{components}} of many pungent {{plants such as}} mustard, cabbage, and horseradish. The pungency of those plants is due to <b>mustard</b> <b>oils</b> produced from glucosinolates when the plant material is chewed, cut, or otherwise damaged.

25|$|The cuisine of Mizoram {{differs from}} that of most of India, though it shares {{characteristics}} to other regions of Northeast India and North India. Rice is the staple food of Mizoram, while Mizos love to add non-vegetarian ingredients in every dish. Fish, chicken, pork and beef are popular meats among Mizos. Dishes are served on fresh banana leaves. Most of the dishes are cooked in <b>mustard</b> <b>oil.</b> Meals tend to be less spicy than in most of India. Mizos love eating boiled vegetables along with rice. A popular dish is bai, made from boiling vegetables (spinach, eggplant, beans, and other leafy vegetables) with bekang fermented soya beans or Sa-um, a fermented pork and served with rice. Sawhchiar is another common dish, made of rice and cooked with pork or chicken.|$|E
25|$|Many Indian {{dishes are}} cooked in {{vegetable}} oil, but peanut oil is popular in northern and western India, <b>mustard</b> <b>oil</b> in eastern India, and coconut oil {{along the western}} coast, especially in Kerala. Gingelly (sesame) oil is common in the south since it imparts a fragrant, nutty aroma. In recent decades, sunflower, safflower, cottonseed, and soybean oils have become popular across India. Hydrogenated vegetable oil, known as Vanaspati ghee, is another popular cooking medium. Butter-based ghee, or deshi ghee, is used frequently, though less than in the past. Many types of meat are used for Indian cooking, but chicken and mutton {{tend to be the}} most commonly consumed meats. Fish and beef consumption are prevalent in some parts of India, but they are not widely consumed except for coastal areas, as well as the north east.|$|E
40|$|This PhD thesis {{contributes}} {{to a better understanding}} of the chemistry of <b>mustard</b> and rapeseed <b>oils</b> in the field of authenticity, formation of antioxidants during roasting and their effects on the oil oxidative stability. At first, a chemometric methodology based on Monte Carlo simulation was developed to evaluate the authenticity of <b>mustard</b> and rapeseed <b>oils.</b> In the second part, the isolation of a potent radical scavenger, canolol, from the roasted <b>mustard</b> seed <b>oil</b> was carried out and its identity was confirmed via spectrometric data (NMR, UV, MS) and chemical synthesis. Canolol was found to be formed during seed roasting by decarboxylation of sinapic acid. In the third part, the oxidative stability of roasted and unroasted <b>mustard</b> seed <b>oils</b> collected from the Nepalese market was evaluated. Furthermore, the effects of seed roasting on the oxidative stability of <b>mustard</b> and rapeseed <b>oils</b> was investigated. These studies showed that canolol could play an important role in the oxidative stability of roasted rapeseed oil; in contrast, it could only play a limited role in the much higher oxidative stability of roasted <b>mustard</b> seed <b>oil.</b> In fact, the oxidative stability of roasted <b>mustard</b> seed <b>oil</b> was mainly correlated with the phospholipid content and the Maillard type browning reaction products formed during roasting. At last, the Maillard type reactions involving phospholipids and their antioxidant potential were evaluated in a model system containing phosphatidylethanolamine and glucose. The reaction products not only increased the oil oxidative stability but also increased the stability of tocopherol and plastochromanol- 8 during oil storage. The occurrence of such reactions in an apolar medium was demonstrated by identifying some of the reaction products by liquid chromatography-time of flight mass spectrometry (LC-TOF MS). Such antioxidants could find a wide application in different food products...|$|R

25|$|In {{the north}} Indian state of Uttarakhand and {{neighbouring}} Nepal, taro {{is considered a}} healthy food cooked {{in a variety of}} ways. The delicateGaderi taro of Kumaun, especially from Lobanj region is much sought after. Most commonly it is boiled in tamarind water till tender, then cubes are diced out, which are stir fried in <b>mustard</b> <b>oil</b> with methi (fenugreek) leaves. Boiling it in salty water in iron cooking pots until it becomes like porridge, is another technique. The young leaves, called gaaba, are steamed, then sun-dried and stored for later use. For another use, the taro leaves and stems are used raw as an ingredient for pickles. Crushed leaves and stems are mixed with de-husked urad dal – black lentils and then dried as small balls called badi. The stems may also be sun-dried and stored for later use. On one special day, women worship saptarshi ("seven sages") and eat only rice with taro leaf vegetable.|$|E
25|$|Odia cuisine {{refers to}} the cooking of the eastern Indian state of Odisha. Foods from this area are rich and varied, while relying heavily on local ingredients. The {{flavours}} are usually subtle and delicately spiced, quite unlike the fiery curries typically associated with Indian cuisine. Fish and other seafood such as crab and shrimp are very popular. Chicken and mutton are also consumed, but somewhat occasionally. Only 6% {{of the population of}} Odisha is vegetarian, and this is reflected in its cuisine. The oil base used is mostly <b>mustard</b> <b>oil,</b> but in festivals ghee is used. Panch phutana, a mix of cumin, mustard, fennel, fenugreek and kalonji (nigella) is widely used for tempering vegetables and dals, while garam masala (curry powder) and haladi (turmeric) are commonly used for non-vegetarian curries. Pakhala, a dish made of rice, water, and yogurt, that is fermented overnight, is very popular in summer, particularly in the rural areas. Oriyas are very fond of sweets and no Oriya repast is considered complete without some dessert at the end. Festivals and fasts witness a cuisine without onion and garlic, whereas other days witness an aroma of garlic and onion paste in curries. One can find restaurants serving food without onion and garlic in major places like Puri and other coastal area, which is run by Brahmin owners.|$|E

40|$|High erucic <b>mustard</b> seed <b>oil</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} common liquid cooking oil in India and Nepal. Roasting of seed prior to oil {{extraction}} is a common practice in these areas. This study was carried out to evaluate the oxidative stability of the roasted <b>mustard</b> seed <b>oil.</b> At first, a potent radical scavenger formed during seed roasting was isolated and identified based on NMR, MS, UV and fluorescence spectra. The compound was found to be 2, 6 -dimethoxy- 4 -vinylphenol (also known as canolol) and was confirmed by chemical synthesis. The compound was isolated for the first time from roasted high erucic <b>mustard</b> seed <b>oil.</b> It was previously observed in the roasted low erucic <b>mustard</b> and rapeseed <b>oil.</b> Furthermore, the oxidative stability of the different <b>mustard</b> seed <b>oil</b> samples collected from Nepalese market was evaluated. The different samples showed varying degree of oxidative stability and some samples were remarkably stable even for 2 months at 50 oC (dark). The differences in the oxidative stability among samples were only slightly correlated with the concentration of radical scavengers. Further study revealed that browning reaction markers (absorbance at 330 to 430 nm and fluorescence emission at 450 nm after excitation at 350 nm) showed high correlation with the oxidative stability. The browning reaction products were lipophilic, which indicated the possible involvement of lipids in the Maillard type reactions. The phospholipids content showed high correlation with both the browning reaction markers and the oxidative stability. This showed that the presence of phospholipids along with its possible browning reaction products (mainly due to amino group containing phospholipids) during heat treatments could play important synergistic role with canolol and tocopherols on the oxidative stability of the roasted <b>mustard</b> seed <b>oil...</b>|$|R

40|$|An {{enzyme-linked}} immunosorbent assay for {{the detection}} of mustard protein was developed. The assay is based on a polyclonal antiserum directed against a mixture of mustard proteins raised in rabbits. The assay has a detection limit of 1. 5 ppm (milligrams per kilogram) and is suitable {{for the detection of}} traces of mustard protein in mustard seed-derived flavoring ingredients. Limited cross-reactivity testing showed that no other plant proteins reacted significantly. From the animal proteins tested, only milk showed some cross-reactivity. With this sensitive assay, it was shown that refined <b>mustard</b> seed <b>oil</b> produced by steam distillation does not contain detectable amounts of mustard protein. <b>Mustard</b> seed <b>oil</b> is used as a flavoring in very low quantities, typically between 40 and 200 mg/kg. Thus, 100 g of a food product flavored with 200 mg of <b>mustard</b> seed <b>oil</b> per kg containing < 1. 5 mg of protein per kg would represent an amount of mustard seed protein of < 30 ng. Taking into account the published literature on allergic reactions to the unintended ingestion of mustard, this conservatively low calculated level indicates that it is unlikely that food products containing <b>mustard</b> seed <b>oil</b> as a flavoring ingredient will elicit an allergic reaction in mustard-allergic individuals.
