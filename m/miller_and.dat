40|$|<b>Millers</b> <b>and</b> Dawes Points are two harbour side, {{inner city}} suburbs of Sydney {{that have been}} subject to {{contests}} over space. Because of <b>Millers</b> <b>and</b> Dawes Points’ histories, the area contains some of Sydney’s oldest residential housing. More recently, certain areas within <b>Millers</b> <b>and</b> Dawes Points have experienced residential and commercial gentrification. This thesis extends existing gentrification studies through a middle range framework, which includes the concepts of ‘territoriality’, ‘sense of place’ and ‘placelessness’. This theoretical framework increases our understandings of the changes occurring in local areas. Nestled within the suburbs of <b>Millers</b> <b>and</b> Dawes Points are pockets of social housing occupied by residents who are dubbed the ‘traditional community’. The traditional community live cheek by jowl with some of the area’s wealthier residents who reside in the suburbs’ ‘privatopias’ (McKenzie 1994, 9). These wealthier residents are gentrifiers who I have labelled as the ‘new community’ in this thesis. This thesis identifies how these communities have developed distinct senses of and attachments to place that have been constructed <b>and</b> manifested within <b>Millers</b> <b>and</b> Dawes Points’ complex and contested terrain. The recent sales of social housing in <b>Millers</b> <b>and</b> Dawes Points as well as the local ‘Barangaroo’ redevelopment are explored as an exemplar of territorialisation. Using territoriality theory (Sack 1986), this thesis describes how different stakeholder groups have enacted acts of territorialisation to gain control of this urban space. These enactors of territoriality included the New South Wales state government, residents of the new community and other commercial corporations. This thesis is also concerned with how these acts of territoriality have posed a threat to the traditional community and the senses of place experienced by its members. In particular, the outcomes of these territorial actions were causing members of the traditional community to feel increasingly ‘placeless’. This thesis presents evidence from the residents of <b>Millers</b> <b>and</b> Dawes Points showing that although residents have not been passive recipients of the changes occurring within their suburbs, the politics of resisting these changes has been difficult...|$|R
