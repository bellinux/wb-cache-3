5000|$|In 2011, {{the first}} non-grid {{controller}} in the <b>Monome</b> family was introduced, the <b>Monome</b> Arc. The <b>Monome</b> Arc {{consists of two}} aluminum knobs mounted on a rectangular walnut box. Each knob {{is surrounded by a}} ring of 64 LED lights, and similarly to the <b>Monome,</b> affords function only by USB connection to an application. Some critics of the Arc have said it should be positioned as a complement to the <b>Monome</b> rather than a [...] "complete control paradigm" [...] that can stand alone, and that its overly-simplistic design {{can be seen as a}} limiting factor for independent use.|$|E

50|$|Despite being {{produced}} irregularly in small quantities since its introduction in 2006, the <b>Monome</b> button-grid controller {{has had a}} significant impact on electronic music. Together with the physically similar Yamaha Tenori-On, which was released a year later in 2007, the <b>Monome</b> inspired interest in minimalist, grid-based music controllers throughout the industry. That interest spawned hobbyist projects like the Arduinome and commercial products like the Akai APC40, the Novation Launchpad, and the Livid Instruments Block and Ohm64. GridFest, a festival for <b>Monome</b> enthusiasts, took place in New Mexico in May 2011, following the release of the <b>Monome</b> Arc earlier that year.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Monome</b> devices do {{not produce}} any sound on their own; they must be {{connected}} to a computer via USB, in which an app affords use to the device. The creators of <b>Monome</b> said: [...] "The wonderful thing about this device is that is doesn't do anything really... It wasn't intended for any specific application. We'll make several applications, and others will make more. We hope to share {{as many of these}} as possible." [...] A core design principle of the <b>Monome</b> {{is that it is not}} intended for any one specific application — the function of each button and the decision as to which lights are lit are completely up to the software communicating with the device over the Open Sound Control protocol. The <b>Monome</b> is not strictly a musical device. Depending the software used, the <b>Monome</b> can function as anything from a sample cutter to a math machine.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Monome</b> has {{a minimalist}} design, {{and has been}} complimented for its {{interface}} design. It is a box with a grid of back-lit buttons, with no labels or icons. No screws are visible on any surface of the <b>Monome.</b> The box that holds the <b>Monome</b> is made entirely of wood, usually walnut, with a clear aluminum top plate. There are three different size options for the Monome: sixteen by sixteen, sixteen by eight, and eight by eight.|$|E

However, the main theme is provided by Juan Magan and Belinda playing [...] "Te Voy A Esperar" [...] This song was placed at number 1 on the charts in Spain on iTunes and Spotify. On the other hand, the soundtrack {{of the film}} also features songs from One Direction and The <b>Monomes,</b> beyond the hit song [...] "The Final Countdown" [...] by the group of Swedish rock band called Europe. The soundtrack was released by MovieScore Media on 12 September 2012.|$|R
50|$|The {{song was}} co-written and {{produced}} by Juan Magán, although the movie soundtrack is composed by Zacarías M. de la Riva, the main theme is performed by Juan Magán with Belinda, which was peaked at number 1 on Spain iTunes charts and Spotify. On the other hand, the original movie soundtrack also features with {{songs of the}} groups One Direction and The <b>Monomes.</b> The song spent 10 weeks at number 1 in the charts of Spain {{and a total of}} 43 weeks in that chart. It was certified platinum in Spain for sales of over 60.000 units. In Mexico, the song was only released for airplay and peaked at number 7.|$|R
30|$|Practical {{examples}} {{for such}} HGMs employ, e.g., <b>monomes</b> as nonlinearity basis functions [44, 45] (so-called power filters) and Legendre polynomials [19 – 22], {{as well as}} sinusoidal functions [8, 9, 42]. Some of the publications employing sinusoidal functions also refer to HGMs as FLAF without memory [8, 9]. Inspired by machine learning, FLAFs typically express the input/output relation of (5) differently: instead of individual branch signals, all branch signals are interleaved and concatenated to a larger expanded vector, which is mapped to an echo estimate by linear combination (covers both convolution and summation in (5)). However, with focus on the applicability of fast convolution methods in this article, the formulation according {{to a group of}} parallel Hammerstein systems is advantageous.|$|R
5000|$|In September 2013, <b>Monome</b> {{introduced}} another open-sourced controller, Aleph. Aleph {{was designed}} and engineered by original <b>Monome</b> creator Brian Crabtree and Ezra Buchla, musician and son of Don Buchla. The Aleph differs greatly from the minimalist <b>Monome</b> and Arc machines. [...] Aleph contains four digital inputs and outputs, four control voltage inputs and outputs, multiple optical encoders, a display screen and USB - {{all of which can}} be completely reprogrammed at the software level. Full release and distribution was planned for late Fall 2013.|$|E

40|$|In {{biological}} systems, specific protein-DNA {{interactions are}} often modulated by ligands {{as in the}} regulation of gene expression. Many transcription factors arc active as dimers, but inactive as <b>monomes.</b> In at least one case, dimerization is regulated by an additional protein cofactor. We recently described {{the design of a}} triple helical complex compnsmg two oligonucleotides which bind adjacent sites on DNA cooperatively through dimerization. If dimerizat 1 on could be controlled by additional ligands such an artificial nucleic acid system would be analogous to the naturally occurring inducible protein systems. We now report that the stability of the dimerization domain can be enhanced by a small molecule, echinomycin (E). The strengths of ligand-promoted control of oligonucleotides binding cooperatively to DNA are quantitated by affinity cleaving...|$|R
40|$|In 70 's {{there was}} {{discovered}} a construction how to attach to some algebraic-geometric data an infinite-dimensional subspace {{in the space}} k((z)) of the Laurent power series. The construction {{is known as the}} Krichever correspondence. It was applied in the theory of integrable systems, particularly, for the KP and KdV equations. We show that the Krichever construction can be generalized to the case of dimension 2. We also include a known description of connection between the KP hierarchy in the Lax form and the vector fields on infinite Grassmanian manifolds and a construction of the semi-infinite <b>monomes</b> for the field k((z)) which {{is an important part of}} the theory of Sato Grassmanian. The text was published in Communications in Algebra, 29 (2001), No. 9, 4157 - 4181. This version includes a corrected proof of the proposition 2.

50|$|Hardware {{typically}} {{consists of}} a physical controller, most often a MIDI or Human interface device, often resembling a scaled-down CDJ setup (albeit, without hardware CD players) or a pad-controller resembling the traditional Akai MPC; a newer class of controllers is represented by grid-based button controllers such as the Novation Launchpad. Some include built-in sound card interfaces and others rely on the PC's internal sound setup or make use of a breakout box with a sound card. Some makers of controllers include Akai Professional, Numark Industries, Native Instruments, Novation, Vestax, Livid Instruments, Keith McMillen, Denon, <b>Monome.</b> Some DJ CD Players, such as the Pioneer Corporation CDJ800 and Numark MixDeck can also function as controllers. Older controllers occasionally used standard MIDI connectors, most controllers today are USB-based.|$|E

40|$|While the <b>Monome</b> and its {{variants}} {{have created}} a large user community (and a variety of custom applications) the devices do not afford performers direct access to continuous control data from either the buttons or the LEDs. With the addition of continuous control, the Chronome provides a new open-source iteration of the <b>Monome</b> that is more expressive and organic to perform with. This increased control is provided through the addition of pressure control via the buttons, and multi-colour support for the LEDs. By increasing the level of control, but keeping a familiar instrument design, the authors aim to facilitate {{an increase in the}} virtuosic potential afforded by the <b>Monome</b> family of devices. With this in mind, the authors have developed several new applications that utilize the Chronome’s new functionality, and provide increased levels of visual feedback, while taking advantage of the continuously variable “aftertouch ” from the pressure buttons. 1...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to define the process of {{iterative}} interface design as it pertains to musical performance. Embodying this design approach, the <b>Monome</b> OSC/MIDI USB controller represents a minimalist, open-source hardware device. The open-source nature of the device has allowed for a small group of <b>Monome</b> users to modify the hardware, firmware, and software associated with the interface. These user driven modifications have allowed the re-imagining of the interface for new and novel purposes, beyond even that of the device’s original intentions. With development being driven by a community of users, a device can become several related but unique generations of musical controllers, each one focused on a specific set of needs...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT：Melt {{grafting}} of {{itaconic acid}} (IA) onto an ethylene-propylene-diene terpolymer (EPDM) with various organic peroxide initiators was performed. Finding the optimum mixing conditions and concentration of ingredients {{is critical for}} effective grafting and optimum properties of grafted materials. This study focused {{on the effects of}} mixing conditions (temperature and time), initiator type/concentration and monomer concentration on the grafting degree and efficiency, melt flow index, and gel content of EPDM-g-IA. The initiator, 2, 5 -dimethyl- 2, 5 -di(tert-butyl peroxy) -hexane (T- 101), appeared to meet for the best grafting degree (1. 91 %).

40|$|International audienceThe {{grafting}} {{efficiency of}} dimethylaminoethylmethacrylate (DMAEMA) on to natural rubber (NR) has been studied. Grafting was by topology-controlled emulsion polymerization, whereby polymerization is initiated by a redox couple where one component (tetraethylene pentamine) is hydrophilic {{and the other}} (cumene hydroperoxide) is hydrophobic. This should promote grafting at the interface between hydrophobic natural rubber particles and the hydrophilic DMAEMA. The effects of different amounts of monomer were examined, with NMR to obtain the percent branching, transmission electron microscopy to obtain information on morphology, gel fraction measurement and dynamic mechanical analysis to obtain information on mechanical properties. Although there will be significant amounts of ungrafted polyDMAEMA present, there is good evidence {{for the formation of}} graft copolymers of NR with core-shell morphology, and significant amounts of grafting, at high concentrations of <b>monome...</b>|$|E
