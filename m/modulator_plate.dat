40|$|A module is {{described}} with a receiver having a solar energy acceptance opening {{and supported by}} a mounting ring along the optic axis of a parabolic mirror in coaxial alignment for receiving solar energy from the mirror, and a solar flux <b>modulator</b> <b>plate</b> for varying the quantity of solar energy flux received by the acceptance opening of the module. The <b>modulator</b> <b>plate</b> is characterized by an annular, plate-like body, the internal diameter of which is equal to or slightly greater than {{the diameter of the}} solar energy acceptance opening of the receiver. Slave cylinders are connected to the <b>modulator</b> <b>plate</b> for supporting the plate for axial displacement along the axis of the mirror, therby shading the opening with respect to solar energy flux reflected {{from the surface of the}} mirror to the solar energy acceptance opening...|$|E
40|$|The routing {{scheme and}} some {{permutation}} properties of a four-shuffle-exchange-based Omega network are discussed. The corresponding optical setup, which {{is composed of}} 2 -D phase spatial light <b>modulators</b> and calcite <b>plates,</b> is proposed and demonstrated through mapping the inputs to a 2 -D array. Instead of one shuffle-exchange followed by one switching operation as in ordinary Omega networks, in our presented system, the shuffle interconnection embraced in the switches is accomplished simply by varying the switching structure of each stage. For the proposed polarization-optical modules, the system is compact in structure, efficient in performance, and insensitive to the environment.

40|$|The 1 -MW High Voltage Converter Modulators [1] have {{operated}} {{in excess of}} 250, 000 hours at the Spallation Neutron Source. Increased demands on the accelerator performance require increased modulator reliability. An effort is underway at SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory to redesign the <b>modulator</b> H-bridge switch <b>plate</b> {{with the goals of}} increasing reliability and performance [2]. The major difference between the SLAC design and the existing design is the use of press-pack IGBTs. Compared to other packaging options, these IGBTs have been shown to have increased performance in pulsed-power applications, have increased cooling capability, and do not fragment and disassemble during a fault event. An overview of the SLAC switch plat...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, a {{meaningful}} classification of optical caustic beams in two dimensions is presented. It is {{demonstrated that the}} phase symmetry of the beam's angular spectrum governs the optical catastrophe, which describes the wave properties of ray singularities, for cusp (symmetric phase) and fold (antisymmetric phase) caustics. In contrast to the established idea, the caustic classification arises from the phase symmetry {{rather than from the}} phase power, thus breaking the commonly accepted concept that fold and cusp caustics are related to the Airy and Pearcey functions, respectively. Nevertheless, the role played by the spectral phase power is to control the degree of caustic curvature. These findings provide straightforward engineering of caustic beams by addressing the spectral phase into a spatial light <b>modulator</b> or glass <b>plate...</b>|$|R
30|$|A {{unit of the}} {{electrostatic}} fluxmeter type is used at the observatory. The PG {{is transformed}} into electric current by a rotary electrostatic generator, in which the basis of operation involves the electrostatic induction phenomenon. The electrostatic induction current of the measured field induces an electric charge on the measuring <b>plate.</b> The <b>modulator</b> and shielding <b>plate</b> periodically shields the measuring plate in the electric field, and as a result, the value of induced charge periodically changes. Inflowing and outflowing charge from the plate creates current in a load circuit. The amplitude of this current {{is proportional to the}} strength of the measured electric field, modulation plate rotation frequency, and measuring plate square. The phase is determined by the electric field direction and by the surface of the measuring plate.|$|R
40|$|The Los Alamos Neutron Science Center (LANSCE) linac {{provides}} {{high power}} proton beams for neutron science, Tritium target development, nuclear physics, material science, isotope production, and weapons research. The number of simultaneous beam users places heavy {{demands on the}} RF powerplant, especially the 201. 25 MHz power amplifiers (PA) driving four drift tube linac (DTL) tanks. Designed nearly 30 years ago, these amplifiers have operated at up to 3 Megawatts with duty factors of 12 %. The large number of power tubes in the PA and Intermediate Power Amplifier (IPA) <b>plate</b> <b>modulators,</b> {{the age of the}} cooling and control subsystems, tube manufacturing problems, and operation near maximum PA tube ratings have all affected the system reliability. By monitoring final power amplifier plate dissipation and tube vacuum, improved operating procedures have raised RF system reliability above 95 % for operation periods in 1993 - 95. Other recent modifications and upgrades to the 201. 25 MHz RF powerplant have significantly improved the operation. Higher beam current for a proposed Long Pulse Spallation Source (LPSS) cannot be delivered simultaneously with other beams at high duty factor, however. Plans are underway to develop a new final power amplifier which can use low-level RF modulation for amplitude control. With only a few power tubes, the system will deliver high peak power and duty factor, with improved DC to RF efficiency. and a simplified cooling system. Overview of Original 201. 25 MHz RF Systems A block diagram of the original 201. 25 MHz RF system is shown in Figure 1. The maximum duty factor is 12 % where the plate dissipation of the final amplifier tube (Burle Industries 7835 triode) is approximately 250 kW. A selection of the 7835 parameters is given in table 1. The peak power out of the final cavity amplifier is over 3. 0 MW in some cases. The amplifier chain used a solid state preamplifier and a dual tube driver to provide 4 kW output. This output drives the IPA, a Burle 4616 tetrode, to achieve 130 kW. Finally the 7835 PA can deliver over 3 MW. The 7835 cavity amplifier is unstable if operated with B+ but no RF drive, so the input high voltage is modulated by th...|$|R
