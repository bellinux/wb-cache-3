2500|$|As {{part of the}} {{worldwide}} trend, there is a decline in biodiversity within the Kaipara. The timber industry removed most of the native forest. Much of the kauri and kahikatea forest, and scrub and riparian vegetation, has been replaced with farm and urban areas. Mangrove forests and wetlands have been [...] "reclaimed". Soil erosion has increased on the land and sedimentation in the harbour. Shellfish abundance has declined, especially toheroa, scallops, tuatua, cockles and pipi. Finfish like <b>mullet,</b> <b>snapper,</b> kanae and school shark have diminished.|$|E

50|$|Tourism is an {{important}} economic drive for the town, with tourists flocking to the area at Easter and over the summer holidays. Fishing for many species including King George and Silver whiting, Garfish, <b>Mullet,</b> Flathead, <b>Snapper,</b> Tommy Ruff, Snook, Yellowfin Whiting, squid and crabs is very popular, with other forms of water sport available further up the coastline.|$|R
5000|$|Wildlife on {{and around}} Munyon Island {{includes}} blue sea grass, great blue heron, and little blue heron. The waters contain mojarras, sardines, <b>mullet,</b> pinfish, and <b>snapper.</b> [...] The seagrasses surrounding Munyon Island {{should be treated}} with care, there can be fines levied if the grass is damaged.|$|R
50|$|Inverloch is {{very popular}} for surf and bay fishing. Anderson Inlet and Inverloch Surf Beach are popular for fishing and a good catch is usually found. Surf fishing usually {{produces}} fish such as Silver Trevally, King George Whiting, Flathead, <b>Mullet</b> and Juvenile <b>Snapper</b> (pinky). There are two boat launches on in Inverloch on Anderson Inlet.|$|R
25|$|The {{marine and}} estuarine {{areas in the}} Kaipara Harbour breed <b>snapper,</b> <b>mullet,</b> flounder, sole, kahawai, white trevally, gurnard, yellow‑eyed mullet and skates, rays and sharks. The Kaipara is the largest estuarine harbour {{on the west coast}} of New Zealand and {{provides}} significant areas of suitable breeding grounds and habitats for juvenile fish. It has fewer problems with water quality than the Manukau, and is the single most significant wetland for west coast fisheries.|$|R

500|$|The {{silky shark}} is an {{opportunistic}} predator, feeding mainly on bony fishes from {{all levels of}} the water column, including tuna, mackerel, sardines, <b>mullets,</b> groupers, <b>snappers,</b> mackerel scads, sea chubs, sea catfish, eels, lanternfishes, filefishes, triggerfishes, and porcupinefishes. It may also take squid, paper nautilus, and swimming crabs, and fossil evidence indicates it scavenged on whale carcasses. Good feeding opportunities can draw silky sharks in large numbers; one such feeding aggregation in the Pacific has been documented [...] "herding" [...] a school of small fishes into a compact mass (a bait ball) and trapping it against the surface, whereupon the sharks consumed the entire school. When attacking tightly packed fish, silky sharks charge through the ball and slash open-mouthed, catching the prey fish at the corners of their jaws. Although multiple individuals may feed at once, each launches its attack independently.|$|R
50|$|Mapire has a {{stunning}} beach, {{in harmony with}} mountain ranges, slopes encarpadas itself wrapped by a mountain climate. In Mapire its inhabitants are divided into two sectors. La Playa (beach) and El Cerro (the hill). in the beach fishing of (<b>snapper,</b> <b>mullet,</b> Moor, etc.) is performed, woodworking (making fishing boats) and dry cocoa produced in the estates. In the Hill have settled most of the families find the school, the chapel {{of the town and}} the river Mapire, water source and meeting area for residents.|$|R
40|$|Mariculture {{is defined}} as the {{cultivation}} of marine organisms in their natural environment (Webster’s Dictionary). In other words mariculture is the rearing of the aquatic organisms under controlled or semi-controlled conditions in coastal and offshore waters. The mariculture environment thus includes sea, backwaters, estuaries and coastal lagoons. Marine organisms include both migratory species to estuaries/backwaters and non-migratory species confined only to the sea. Mariculture today includes predominantly migratory marine fishes such as seabass, shrimps,lobsters, cobia, <b>snappers,</b> <b>mullets,</b> pearlspot, milkfish etc. Most of these species are capable of tolerating variations in the environmen...|$|R
50|$|Othoni is {{the first}} migratory bird station in southeastern Europe from Libya, {{especially}} for turtle doves. There are also grouse and snipe (xilokotes) during the winter months, and Petritis falcons, the European bee-eater birds, martins, ravens and several species of eagles.There are several hares and rabbits. The most common species of reptile is the viper (Vipera ammodytes or astritis).Marine mammals have been observed off the island's coast, including the bottlenose dolphin, at least three species of sharks (including white shark), while sporadically near the cave of Calypso there have been monk seals. also found almost all varieties of marine fauna, such as the white sea bream, red <b>mullet,</b> the <b>snapper,</b> the grouper, the bumpkin (weighing up to 30 pounds), octopus, moray, the stingray, lobster. Remarkable {{is the presence of}} barnacles and sea urchins.Zooplankton is in small coves of the island and especially in seaweed is abundant at night, and when the sea is calm, the plankton illuminates the sea bed.|$|R

In India, technology for production of marine finfish seeds is in primitive stage except for sea bass. The Mandapam Regional Centre of the Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute (CMFRI) has developed hatchery technology for cobia, Rachycentron canadum during March 2010 {{for the first time}} in the country. Again the Centre has developed hatchery seed production technology for the silver pompano, Trachinotus blochii {{for the first time in}} the country. Both the technologies are standardised and hence the CMFRI has entered into agreements with interested entrepreneurs and farmers for dissemination of technologies for development of cobia and silver pompano aquaculture sector in our country...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{subsistence}} {{strategies of}} coastal Neolithic groups in eastern Arabia, reliant upon {{the exploitation of}} marine and terrestrial animal resources, are not yet fully understood. A central question in relevant literature {{is the issue of}} mobility. This is the reason for excavations in Umm al-Quwain (UAQ 2), UAE, from 2011 by the French Archaeological Mission. UAQ 2 is a site with obvious potential, occupied for 1500 years from the mid-sixth millennium BC. It has an area of approximately 6 ha with 3. 2 m or more of imposing and unusual stratigraphy. A large quantity of faunal remains, including terrestrial and marine vertebrates, was recovered from UAQ 2. The terrestrial mammals are composed mainly of domestic herbivores including caprines, cattle, and dogs. The most striking feature is the number of newly born and young animals among the small herbivores, a clear indication of occupation during late winter/spring. As for the fish bones, the following taxa were identified: requiem sharks, shark-suckers, marine catfish, needlefish, jacks/trevallies, milkfish, mojarra, emperors, <b>snappers,</b> <b>mullet,</b> flatheads, shortfin flounders, parrotash, kawakawa, tuna, groupers, sea bream, barracuda, puffer, and tripod fish. These indicate that most fishing was carried out in the shallow lagoon area, but some fishing for tuna may have been carried out in the open seas beyond the local lagoon. Besides fish were also the remains of cuttlefish and swimming crabs. This assemblage provides new information on the mixed exploitation of inland and marine resources during the sixth to fifth millennium BC. The integrated study of the faunal remains contributes to the proposal of a possible year-round residency, not excluding coastal mobility...|$|R
