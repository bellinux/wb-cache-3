40|$|The {{research}} problem this dissertation addresses is how judicial practices generate administrative justice in asylum determination procedures. Previous research on immigration policies argues that when asylum determinations are processed in courts, principles of administrative justice are ensured and immigrants’ rights protected. In this dissertation, I challenge that argument by approaching administrative justice as an empirical phenomenon open for {{different types of}} interpretations. Instead of assuming that administrative justice characterizes courts, I assume that this concept acquires particular meanings through the practices of the courts. Empirically, this dissertation studies practices of assessing asylum claims at the Swedish <b>migration</b> <b>courts.</b> The <b>migration</b> <b>courts</b> {{are the result of}} a major reform of the Swedish asylum procedure that took place in 2006, with the motive to end inhumane rejections of asylum seekers by enhancing administrative justice in the asylum process. By interviewing and observing judges at the <b>migration</b> <b>courts,</b> litigators from the Migration Board and public counsels from different law firms, this interpretive and ethnographic study analyzes how administrative justice acquires meanings in the daily practices of assessing asylum claims at the <b>migration</b> <b>courts.</b> The main result is that a ceremonial version of administrative justice is generated at the <b>migration</b> <b>courts.</b> This version of administrative justice forefronts symbolic dimensions of justice. The asylum appeal procedure succeeds in communicating justice through rituals, building design and metaphors, which emphasize objectivity, impartiality and certainty on behalf of the judicial practices. However, these symbols of justice disguise several unfair aspects of the asylum appeal procedure, such as inequality in resources and trustworthiness between the state’s representative and the asylum applicants as well as the uncertainty inherent in both the factual and the credibility assessment of asylum claims. The implications of these findings are that immigration policy research needs to reconsider the relationship between the courts and immigrants’ rights by paying more attention to the everyday practices of ensuing administrative justice in courts than on the instances when courts oppose political attempts to restrict immigrants’ rights...|$|R

40|$|Fleeing {{the horrors}} of an {{internal}} armed conflict constitutes a ground for subsidiary protection under the Qualification Directive and in the Swedish Aliens Act. However, {{what is to be}} defined as such a conflict is disputed. This is obvious within the European context from the inconsistent interpretations of for example the situation in Iraq amongst Member States. In Sweden, the <b>Migration</b> <b>Court</b> of Appeal established the situation in Iraq as severe, but as not amounting to an armed conflict. In France and Great Britain however, Iraq is regarded as such a conflict. The argument of this article is that the concept of internal armed conflict in the Swedish Aliens Law is incoherent and inadequate. This {{is due to the fact}} that the Swedish interpretation is based upon international humanitarian law, a law which provides an unclear and anachronistic concept of internal armed conflict...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the essay {{is to examine the}} views on {{sexuality}} that guide the Swedish Migration board and court’s judgments and decisions in asylum cases. The essay investigates seven cases from the Swedish <b>Migration</b> <b>court</b> regarding asylum seekers from seven different countries seeking protection in Sweden due to their sexuality and/or gender identity. By applying discourse analysis, along with the theoretical perspectives of Judith Butler and the postcolonial critique of Chandra Talpade Mohanty, the essay discuss what kind of criteria and/or practice is demanded of the asylum seekers to be rendered as trustworthy. The essay concludes that the asylum seekers are considered untrustworthy by the migration authorities when not acting according to a (hetero) normative sexuality. It also explores how the migration authorities depoliticize homophobic structures in the asylum seekers’ home countries by articulating homophobia as an individual experience rather than institutionalized discrimination. There is a lack of knowledge within the migration authorities regarding how the process of seeking asylum, which in the examined cases leads to arbitrary judgements, affects sexual identity. Being a somewhat undertheorized subject in the Swedish academia, the essay aims to contribute to the theoretical field of Queer Migration by exploring a Swedish context...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The {{responsibility}} to manage migration to Europe {{is becoming an}} increasingly important issue. The agreement of a Common European Asylum System (CEAS) is an ever ongoing debate. Today there is nearly 60 million refugees in the world, {{and many of these}} are children.  According to the UN Declaration of Human Rights everyone has the right to seek asylum in another country. Through the Dublin Regulation it is, however, regulated which country is responsible for the asylum application. Due to criticism the Dublin Regulation has been revised from Dublin II to current Dublin III. The UN Child Rights Committee has recommended Sweden to incorporate the UN Convention of the Rights of the Child with Swedish law to ensure {{the rights of the child}}. This essay examines whether the rights of the child are ensured when the <b>Migration</b> <b>Court</b> of Appeal and the Court of Justice of the European Communities are making decisions according to the Dublin Regulation. This essay also examines the effects of incorporation of the UN Convention of the Rights of the Child with Swedish law.   Keywords: best interests of the child, respect for the views of the child, asylum seeking children, rule of law, justice, the Dublin regulation. ...|$|E

Essay 2 : Although economic circumstances have been argued to be a major determining factor of attitudes to redistribution, there is little well identified evidence at the individual level. Utilizing a unique dataset, with detailed individual information, provides new and convincing evidence on the link between economic circumstances and demand for redistribution (in the form of social benefits). The Swedish National Election Studies are constructed as a rotating survey panel, which makes it possible to estimate the causal effect of economic changes. The empirical analysis shows that individuals who experience a job loss become considerably more supportive of redistribution. Yet, attitudes to redistribution return to their initial level as economic prospects improve, suggesting that the effect is only temporary. Although a job loss also changes attitudes to the political parties, the probability to vote for the left-wing is not affected. Essay 3 : A well-functioning labor market is characterized by job reallocations, but the individual costs can be vast. We examine if individual's ability to cope with such adjustments depends on their cognitive and non-cognitive skills (measured by the enlistment tests). Since selection into unemployment is a function of skills, we solve the endogeneity of a job loss by using the exogenous labor market shock provided by the military base closures in Sweden following the end of the Cold War. We find, first, that, on average, labor earnings decrease and unemployment and labor-related benefits increase for those affected. Second, there are heterogeneous treatment effects in terms of unemployment; the treated individuals with high non-cognitive and cognitive skills face lower unemployment effects than the treated individuals with low non-cognitive and cognitive skills...|$|R
40|$|In recent times, the Irish {{courts have}} found {{themselves}} faced {{with a variety of}} cases on Article 8 protections for migrant families. The cases mainly concern the right of non-Irish national parents to remain in Ireland with their citizen child. A common thread within many of the cases on Article 8 issues is the focus the courts have given, not on {{the best interests of the}} child, but the good behaviour or otherwise of the parent and the state 2 ̆ 7 s interest in immigration control. The Irish Courts have formulated disputes within migration law and families as surrounding the states near unqualified right to control the entry and exit of aliens versus the qualified and heavily circumscribed rights of non-Irish nationals to enjoy family life within the State with their citizen child. Where Article 8 has been utilised by the Irish courts, there has been a very expansive reading given to the needs of the State to ensure integrity of its immigration system.

40|$|Denna uppsats är en kritisk diskursanalys vars syfte är att studera hur begreppet “barnets bästa” används och tolkas i asylprocessen för ensamkommande barn. Jag har undersökt hur de tjänstemän som fattar beslut om asyl i fall med ensamkommande barn formulerar föreställningar om ”barnets bästa” och hur begreppet förhåller sig till andra begrepp i den diskursiva praktiken. Detta har jag gjort genom att dels analysera de styrdokument som ska ligga till grund för besluten och dels beslut ifrån migrationsverket och domar ifrån  migrationsdomstolarna. Det som utifrån min analys går att se är att ”barnets bästa” fylls med mening utifrån regelverk och styrdokument. Det framgår även att principen om ”barnets bästa” konkurrerar med andra samhälleliga intressen som t. ex. ”reglerad invandring”. Det har även framkommit att det förekommer en maktrelation mellan regelverk och tjänsteman samt mellan tjänsteman och barn. This {{essay is}} a {{critical}} discourse analysis which purpose is to investigate how the principle of “In the Child's Best Interest” is used and interpreted in the work with children without custodians seeking asylum.

40|$|Abstract Asylum {{determination}} has, historically, {{not been}} sensitive to women's gender-based claims. Rather, male experiences and governmental persecution {{have been held}} as preferences in asylum determination. There have been international calls to assess gender-based claims {{in relation to a}} social constructivist approach towards gender, in order to eradicate the misinterpretations of women's asylum claims. This dissertation analyses the constructions of women's gender-based asylum claims, and further, examines whether or not verdicts of such claims have been sensitive to the gendered aspects involved. The data used are verdicts from a Swedish <b>Migration</b> <b>Court.</b> Both qualitative and quantitative content analysis has been used as method. Social constructivism has been the main theoretical approach for analysing the construction of women's gender-based asylum claims. The major findings of the analysis are that even though women's claims are largely gender-based, gender is rarely used as a perspective for understanding the claims. Instead, they are often constructed as either being private matters that are not severe enough as to constitute a need for international protection; being random criminal acts without a particular goal and thus disconnected from a protection ground; or as lacking credibility when deviating from notions and understandings of the cultural context related to the claim. Furthermore, claims of violence/harm due to transgression of social mores are often constructed as something that could be averted by the asylum seeker, if she only followed the norms set. Thus, the political agency of transgressing such mores was overlooked. Lastly, the construction and use of gender is to a great extent equated with women, as biologically different to men. In this sense, the socially constructed and gendered power relations and ideological expectations placed on men and women are disregarded. The conclusion {{is that there is a}} great need for assessing gender-based asylum claims with a gender sensitive approach, in order to eradicate widespread misunderstandings based on notions of gender and culture.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the constructions of sexuality, which are {{produced}} when judgments concerning asylum are made, based on an asylum seeker’s sexual orientation. The question formulations are the following: Which constructions of sexuality are produced when necessary condition, fear of persecution due to sexual orientation, is applied in judgments regarding refugee status? Furthermore, how constructions of sexuality differ in the judgments where the asylum seeker has been consented and rejected is investigated. The empirical material consists of 13 judgments, which were announced between the years 2009 - 2013 by the <b>Migration</b> <b>court.</b> A critical discourse analysis is applied in order to answer the question formulations. By examining the linguistic representations in these judgments, the aim is to visualize the statements and positions that are made possible within the discourse. The discourse analysis is mainly based on a queer theoretical perspective with selected concepts from Foucault. The concepts that the analysis is based on are the following; object and subject positions, heteronormativity, performativity and the heterosexual matrix. The results show that constructions of sexuality within the legal discourse, are based on heteronormative perceptions around sexuality. In 8 of 13 judgments, the asylum applicant’s sexual orientation is questioned and they are made to prove their homosexuality. Homosexuality is not given legitimacy within the discourse when the asylum seeker has given descriptions of a heterosexual life according to the judge definition, such as when the person has been in relationships with the opposite sex and have children. A bisexual practice is therefore, not given any legitimacy. Homosexuality is given legitimacy only when the asylum seeker is living in a homosexual relationship. In addition, homosexuality is given credibility when the narrative includes descriptions of homosexuality as an insight involving strong emotions. The result also shows how the asylum seeker is requested to hide their homosexuality in cases where the sexual orientation is criminalized in the person’s home country. In the judgments where the asylum seeker has been rejected, there are constructions of sexuality, which accept the prevailing heteronormativity as well as conceal resistance against oppression. In the judgments in which the asylum seeker has been given refugee status, the definition of sexuality is set in a larger context focusing on the social structures prevalent in the asylum seeker’s home country...|$|E
40|$|Protection of {{asylum seeker}} and Illegal {{migrants}} human rights, {{has often been}} difficult due to the need of states to regulate unwanted <b>migration</b> flows.

40|$|Propelled by the {{commitment}} to ‘reduce net migration to the tens of thousands’ and a decision to expel all ‘foreign national criminals’, the coalition government took steps to reduce the reach of article 8 ECHR. Following the 2012 introduction of the new family migration and private life rules most of the early leading cases concerned deportation appeals of foreign national prisoners, and considered {{to what extent the}} new rules provided a ‘complete code’ for balancing the individual’s right to family life against the Secretary of State’s view of the public interest. Alongside that litigation, the High Court and Court of Appeal considered the lawfulness of the new financial requirements for family <b>migration,</b> and the <b>Court</b> of Appeal decided in July 2014 that those were not incompatible with the Convention, and briskly clarified the ‘complete code’ issue. However, many decisions by the Secretary of State and the FTT maintained that {{in the absence of any}} ‘exceptional or compelling circumstances’ there was no need to consider article 8 at all. Further litigation appeared to re-establish that if an applicant unable to meet the rules could point to circumstances engaging art 8, and where such consideration would not simply arrive at the same answer, then those circumstances should be considered, following Huang and Razgar as before. In July 2014 the Immigration Act (IA) 2014 introduced a new Part 5 into the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act (NIAA) 2002, headed Article 8 of the ECHR: public interest considerations, placing the government’s view on article 8 firmly in primary legislation. While the Upper Tribunal, considering the new ss 117 A-D, quickly decided that even where the rules appear to provide a ‘complete code’, there was still room for the exercise of discretion, a series of Court of Appeal cases on deportation of foreign criminals stress the need to consider article 8 ‘through the lens of the rules’, and emphasise the ‘great weight’ to be given to the Secretary of State’s expression of the public interest. Meanwhile, in April this year the Inner House of the Court of Session (in Mirza and other cases) handed down judgments appearing to follow the ‘previous caselaw’ approach.

Trends {{established}} in California often {{find their way into}} the heartland, having a profound effect on our nation 2 ̆ 7 s cultural scene. Nouvelle cuisine, the dialect of the Valley Girl and rollerblading all have their genesis on the West Coast. The most recent trend to emerge from California, instead of catching on {{in the rest of the}} country, has been stopped dead in its tracks by a legislative rebuke from Washington, D. C. California 2 ̆ 7 s latest, albeit short-lived, contribution to the nation was a migration of securities fraud class actions from federal to state <b>court.</b> This <b>migration</b> had its origin in Washington, D. C., not Los Angeles. Less than three years ago, Congress passed the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (Reform Act, Act, or PSLRA. The corporate lobby and professionals who serve corporations persuaded Congress that companies and their managers were being harassed by class action lawyers more concerned with a case 2 ̆ 7 s settlement value (and potential attorneys 2 ̆ 7 fees) than its merits. In response to that perceived abuse, Congress enacted the Reform Act, a series of primarily procedural measures making it more difficult to bring securities fraud class actions. Three years after its passage, the Act has greatly altered the course of securities litigation; however, its effect on capital formation and investor protection remains uncertain. One result of the Reform Act became clear soon after its passage although it seems not to have been anticipated by Congress. The Act 2 ̆ 7 s sweeping reform, directed largely at securities fraud class actions brought in federal court, leaves state securities fraud actions untouched. Class action lawyers sought to avoid the restrictions imposed by the Reform Act by resorting to state law actions brought in state court. The majority of the state class actions filed since passage of the Reform Act have been filed in California. The first part of this Article assesses the evidence showing a migration to California state court. The authors conclude that claims regarding the magnitude of <b>migration</b> to state <b>court</b> were overblown, but that parallel state and federal cases were a serious problem for corporate issuers forced to defend such dual-track litigation and that state liability concerns threatened to undermine the Reform Act 2 ̆ 7 s safe harbor for forward-looking statements...|$|R
