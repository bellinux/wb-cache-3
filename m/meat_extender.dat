40|$|Abstract: The chemical, physical, and sensory {{evaluation}} of buffalo meat patties was evaluated {{in order to}} study {{the effect of adding}} low fat soy flour and/or mung bean powder as <b>meat</b> <b>extenders.</b> The results indicated that using low fat soy flour or mung bean powder as <b>meat</b> <b>extenders</b> at a level of 10 % reduced the moisture and fat content, whereas increased the fiber and protein contents in the cooked samples. The reduction was greatest in the control (100 % buffalo meat), and lowest in the sample containing 5 % of both low fat soy flour and mung bean powder. The cooking treatment increased the expressible water for the control and 10 % low fat soy flour samples, and increased the protein water coefficient for all samples. The Feder value for sample containing 5 % of both low fat soy flour and mung bean powder was similar to the control one. The addition of mung bean powder increased the water holding capacity, whereas the addition of low fat soy flour and mung bean powder as <b>meat</b> <b>extenders</b> decreased the cooking loss in the formulated patties. The lowest value was in the sample containing 5 % of both extenders. Samples containing 5 % of both low fat soy flour and mung bean powder had the highest water retention value, whereas the sample with 10 % low fat soy flour had the highest fat retention value. Samples containing 5 % of both low fat soy flour and mung bean powder had the highest values for color, taste, odor, juiciness, and overall acceptability among the other samples.

50|$|Textured {{vegetable}} protein {{was invented by}} the agricultural commodities and food processing company Archer Daniels Midland in the 1960s; the company owns the TVP name as a registered trademark. Archer Daniels Midland had developed a textured soy protein isolate made with an extruder {{in the shape of}} rods or tubes. The soy protein isolate was produced in a small pilot plant and sold to one or two customers for use in chili, but the product was not commercially successful. In September 1965, Dwayne O. Andreas and his brother Lowell took over leadership of Archer Daniels Midland. The brothers possessed extensive experience in the soybean processing industry. Dwayne Andreas was greatly impressed with TVP and its potential. Although, at the time, TVP was being produced only in the company's laboratories, Andreas could envision a host of potential uses for TVP, ranging from a <b>meat</b> <b>extender</b> to a low-cost protein source {{in a wide variety of}} foods. Under Andreas's leadership, TVP use expanded in the U.S.; by 1968, it was widely used in a variety of food products, and consumption skyrocketed after 1971, when TVP was approved for use in school lunch programs. By 1980, similar products were being produced by rival companies in America, but Archer Daniels Midland remained the leader in TVP production.|$|E

40|$|The main {{objectives}} {{of this research}} were to examine effects of protein modification (protein cleavage and crosslinking) on turkey meat gelation and to evaluate textural properties and water holding capacity of meat gels prepared from normal and PSE (pale, soft, exudative) turkey breast meat. First, the effect of protein degradation on turkey breast meat gelation was studied. To create different extent of proteolysis in the meat, á-chymotrypsin (EC 3. 4. 21. 1) was added to normal and PSE meat batters at 0, 2. 5, 5 and 10 ppm levels. Sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) of cooked meat gels showed progressive protein hydrolysis with increasing enzyme level. Texture profile analysis and torsional analysis of the cooked meat gels showed an incremental deterioration in texture with increasing enzyme level. This inferior texture caused by proteolysis {{was similar to that}} observed in the gels made from PSE turkey meat alone. Pearson correlation coefficients indicated gel textural properties and expressible moisture were highly correlated to the degree of proteolysis, especially to that of myosin heavy chain (p < 0. 001). The second study focused on modifying protein size to improve meat gelation, especially PSE meat gelation. Transglutaminase (TGase, EC 2. 3. 2. 13) was chosen due to its ability to catalyze crosslinking of proteins. Pea protein isolate, an alternative to soy protein, was also evaluated as a <b>meat</b> protein <b>extender.</b> Textural profile and torsional gelometry analyses of the cooked meat gels showed TGase alone significantly (p < 0. 05) increased gel texture, especially for those made from PSE meat. However, cook yield of the meat gels was compromised possibly due to steric effects. Addition of pea protein isolate alone improved cook yield and gel texture, especially for the gels made from PSE meat. The combination of TGase and pea protein produced the strongest meat gels, while maintaining a similar cook yield to the control. SDS-PAGE showed the disappearance of several protein bands contributed from the meat or pea protein with TGase addition, indicating that these likely were crosslinked and too large to enter the gel. Dynamic rheological analysis revealed TGase altered the viscoelastic properties of the meat or meat-pea protein mixtures and produced more elastic gels on cooling. This research indicated proteolysis had a dramatic impact on textural properties of turkey breast meat gels. Crosslinking of proteins catalyzed by TGase significantly improved gel texture, especially for the gels made from PSE meat. However, TGase-assisted crosslinking of proteins resulted in greater cooking losses unless an extender/adjunct such as pea protein was added...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{investigated the}} use of mushrooms in beef-based products {{as a means to}} reduce overall sodium and fat for food service applications. Initial product development used physical characterization analysis (color, moisture, texture, yield, fat, and sodium) to determine initial threshold of mushroom inclusion with minimal differences against an all-meat control. Additional physical analysis then investigated a variety of other factors (mushroom type, blanching, mushroom particle size, salt level, and meat/fat blend) to determine if there were other attributing ingredient characteristics that would yield statistical similarity to the all-meat control. Taco filling formulations with optimized ingredients were then fielded in a hedonic sensory study to untrained consumers to evaluate attributes product (overall liking, aroma, color, flavor, juiciness, saltiness, and texture). Samples with liking scores that closely matched the control where then fielded in paired preference tests to determine acceptance using patrons from the UMass Dining Commons. Based on physical property assessments, an optimized taco filling formulation containing up to 45 % un-blanched, white button mushrooms finely chopped (1 to 5 mm) maximized mushroom usage while minimizing differences from the all-meat control. Furthermore, consumers preferred a reduced sodium taco filling containing 45 % mushroom over a full sodium taco filling also containing 45 % mushroom in a food service fielded paired preference sensory test. The second part of this research investigated {{the use of}} mushrooms in burger patties in direct comparison to textured soy protein, which is a well established and used <b>meat</b> <b>extender</b> in the industry, specifically in reduced sodium applications. Again, initial product development used physical characterization analysis to determine initial thresholds of <b>meat</b> <b>extender</b> inclusion with minimal differences against an all-meat control. Optimized patty formulations were then fielded in two hedonic sensory studies to identify favorable meat extenders and concentrations of supplementation in full and reduced sodium patties. Results from the hedonic study showed that reduced sodium meat products extended with mushroom can be equally liked to all-meat full sodium counterparts. The findings from this research showed how mushroom {{has the potential to be}} successfully incorporated into meat products to lower sodium and fat without compromising consumer expectation and altering acceptance...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the texture properties of a standard sausage that contained a chicken <b>meat</b> <b>extender</b> at a replacement percentage of 35 % of the PMD when subjected to postproduction heating. An experimental design that looked at the combination of three extenders in ten mixture points was used; the extenders were composed of fiber, pig skin, and carrageenan, respectively, and there was one product without an extender. Five days after production, the sausages were cooked for two hours at 80 °C. An instrumental texture analysis and a firmness and elasticity evaluation were carried out on the recently produced samples and on samples after the subsequent thermal treatments. Hardness, masticability and firmness decreased with the application of the thermal treatments. In addition, a synergistic interaction was seen between the fiber and the carrageenan at the two temperature levels. It was concluded that the fiber, the pig skin and the carrageenan did not exhibit properties that were similar to those of chicken paste because their applications demonstrated a marked decrease in the texture properties, a decrease that was more pronounced when the product was subjected to postproduction heating. </p...|$|E
40|$|Objective: The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to use Lens culinaris flour, verdina variety, as a <b>meat</b> <b>extender,</b> and to analyze its effect on the physical characteristics and acceptability of a sausage. Methodology: The flour was obtained and its qualitative characteristics, its oil absorption index (OAI) and its water holding capacity (WHC) were analyzed. The sausage was prepared, it was added 5 % of flour to it; then, the bromatological, microbiological, textural, and sensory parameters per triplicate of the finished product were evaluated. Statistical Analysis: An experimental design was used completely at random, making three replicates of the formulation, and analysis of variances was performed to find statistical differences. Results: The protein content of the flour was 35. 89 % while the fiber was 11. 82 %. The water holding capacity and the lipid index absorption were 3. 87 mL water/ g sample, and 2. 01 ml of oil/g sample. The final product showed that microbial counts were within the provisions of the Colombian Technical Standards. Flour positively influenced the acceptability of sausages and was favorable in all texture parameters, which were similar to those obtained in commercial sausages. Conclusions: L. culinaris flour represents a non-meat alternative raw material in the manufacture of products with interesting protein values. These results may encourage the use of Lentil flour with verdina variety of food products consumers...|$|E
