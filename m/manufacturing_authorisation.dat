Leaflets are produced in Binzen. Labels are manufactured in Schopfheim, using flexo and digital printing methods. The manufacturing facility in Großbeeren produces leaflets and provides packaging services. This site also has the <b>manufacturing</b> <b>authorisation</b> pursuant to Article 13 of German ‘Medical Preparations Act’. This states that secondary packaging {{is an integral part of}} a medical preparation. The company’s subsidiary, August Faller A/S, manufactures folding cartons in Hvidovre, near the Danish capital of Copenhagen.

GMP-grade DOTA-NOC acetate in 60  μg vials {{was obtained from}} ABX (Radeberg, Germany). ABX was approved as a supplier in conformance with our quality management system based on their GMP <b>manufacturing</b> <b>authorisation</b> and a supplier audit.|$|E
40|$|The {{traditional}} quality {{culture in}} the pharmaceutical industry {{is driven by the}} regulatory process of marketing authorisation and <b>manufacturing</b> <b>authorisation.</b> These components of the South African regulatory control system are exclusively technically-orientated, with no managerial focus. This study identifies several quality management principles which could find general application in the pharmaceutical industry. The research compares the current regulatory control system with the total quality concept, and highlights the positive contribution which the total quality approach is able to make in terms of its field of reference; the strategic business value of quality; quality policy formulation; the quality organisational structure; enhanced operations management; and management's control over quality costs, in particularEconomic and Management SciencesM.

30|$|At {{the bottom}} line the {{discussion}} focusses on the question, are we “preparing” or “manufacturing” radiopharmaceuticals. If they are (extemporaneously, on a small scale, locally) prepared, exemptions as stated above may apply, whereas in they are (industrially) manufactured, the framework of GMP implemented within a <b>manufacturing</b> <b>authorisation</b> should be applied. The European Pharmacopeia (Ph. Eur.) as a legal basis for almost all European countries have tried to clarify {{what they see as}} “preparation”, in the monograph on “Pharmaceutical Preparations” (Pharmaceutical preparations. Monograph N° 2619) the following definition can be found: “the ‘manufacture’ of unlicensed pharmaceutical preparations in pharmacies or other healthcare establishments (the term ‘preparation’ is used instead of ‘manufacture’ in order clearly to distinguish it from the industrial manufacture of licensed pharmaceutical preparations)”. Even more specifically the term radiopharmaceutical preparation is used in the General text 5.19 of the Ph. Eur. and explicitly includes kit-based preparations as well as unlicensed preparations for PET and SPECT.|$|E
