The resulting reader was a mechanical tour-de-force, combining five MICR readers with a large rotating drum that forced checks dumped in the top to come out the bottom single-file.

50|$|Magnetic {{immunoassay}} (MIA) {{is a novel}} type {{of diagnostic}} immunoassay utilizing magnetic nanobeads as labels in lieu of conventional, enzymes, radioisotopes or fluorescent moieties. This assay involves the specific binding of an antibody to its antigen, where a magnetic label is conjugated to one element of the pair. The presence of magnetic nanobeads is then detected by a <b>magnetic</b> <b>reader</b> (magnetometer) which measures the magnetic field change induced by the beads. The signal measured by the magnetometer {{is proportional to the}} analyte (virus, toxin, bacteria, cardiac marker,etc.) quantity in the initial sample.|$|E

There is no <b>magnetic</b> <b>reader</b> technology in use, such as NYC or Nassau County's MetroCard, in use. Bus transfers cost an additional $0.25, and must be requested and paid for upon boarding the bus.

5000|$|The MICR E-13B font was {{designed}} for automated reading by a very simple <b>magnetic</b> <b>reader</b> {{in the early days}} of automatic character recognition. The weight of strokes in the characters can be recognised as [...] "light" [...] or [...] "heavy" [...] by a simple circuit and these patterns then map directly to the bit patterns of a computer character set. This made the characters practical to read before 'smart' OCR, but limited the length of the character set. E-13B has only 14 characters: the numeric digits and a few control codes. None of the alphanumeric 'computer' typefaces like Westminster could be read magnetically.|$|E

5000|$|Until the {{introduction}} of Chip & PIN, all face-to-face credit or debit card transactions used a magnetic stripe or mechanical imprint to read and record account data, and a signature for verification.

In the former case, the system verifies account details and prints a slip for the customer to sign. In the case of a mechanical imprint, the transaction details are filled in and the customer signs the imprinted slip. In either case, the clerk verifies that the customer's signature matches that {{on the back of the}} card to authenticate the transaction.|$|E
40|$|For {{magnetic}} immunoassay applications, a novel <b>magnetic</b> <b>reader</b> for quantification {{of magnetic}} particle concentrations has been developed. Upon magnetic excitation at two distinct frequencies incident on the sample, the response signal generated at a sum frequency is detected. The low-frequency field component periodically drives the magnetic particles into saturation, which is probed by the high-frequency field. The appearance of frequency mixing lines is highly {{specific to the}} nonlinearity of the superparamagnetic particles' magnetization. The optimization of field coils, differential pickup coil, preamplifier, demodulators and filters are discussed. The output signal is linear for four orders of magnitude in iron concentration.

40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. May 2014. Major: Electrical Engineering. Advisor: Jian-Ping Wang. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); ix, 122 pages, appendix A. Spin transfer torque (STT) induced magnetization switching and oscillation in nanometer scale magnetoresistance (MR) devices {{have been studied}} intensively due to its direct application in the non-volatile STT random access memory (STT-RAM) and its potential application in the high frequency spin torque oscillatior (STO). STO {{could be used in}} high-density microwave signal processor and chip-to-chip communication system due to its nanometer scale footprint and ultra high oscillation frequency. STO has also been suggested in the magnetic recoridng head for the microwave assisted magnetic recording (MAMR) and in the high-speed <b>magnetic</b> <b>reader</b> for future hard disk drive. However, several critical engineering challenges for those exciting STO applications are still remaining, including optimizing the operating condition, tuning the frequency, narrowing the linewidth and improving the output power. In this thesis work, the spin transfer torque induced oscillation is experimentally studied in MgO barrier based magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) with focus on the improvement of the key performances of the STO. The power angular dependence of spin torque oscillation is experimentally studied in dual MgO barrier MTJs based on the understanding of the relation between the MR and oscillation output power. It is proved that the STO electrical power increases with the polarizer canting angle. Meanwhile, the results also reveal a solution for extending the oscillation operating condition. Furthermore, the MTJ based STO device with a built-in hard axis polarizer is designed and studied. This design provides an external-field-free STO with high power, low critical current and extended operation range of the driving current for the first time. Additionally, two oscillation modes in the dual MgO barrier MTJs are observed and investigated. It is found from the field-dependent power spectra that the extra oscillation mode may come from the weakly-pinned top reference layer. A single-shot time-domain measurement to characterize the switching time of each switch under different voltages for MTJs in the nanosecond precessional regime was carried out too...|$|E

50|$|Since the {{introduction}} of payment card Chip and PIN, however, cloning of the chip is not feasible; only the magnetic stripe can be copied, and a copied card cannot be used by itself on a terminal requiring a PIN. The introduction of Chip and PIN coincided with wireless data transmission technology becoming inexpensive and widespread. In addition to mobile-phone-based <b>magnetic</b> <b>readers</b> like those from Square, merchant personnel can now bring wireless PIN pads to the customer, so the card is never out of the cardholder's sight.
