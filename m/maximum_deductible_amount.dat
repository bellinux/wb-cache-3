Using cross-section data, I structurally estimate the labor supply of married women under the piece-wise linear budget constraint created by the Japanese tax and social security system. I find that the wife’s labor supply response to her husband’s decreasing deduction tends to be greater than the response to her own income tax.

40|$|The present work {{studies the}} optimal {{insurance}} policy offered by an insurer adopting a proportional premium principle to an insured whose decision-making behavior is modeled by Kahneman and Tversky's Cumulative Prospect Theory with convex probability distortions. We show that, under a fixed premium rate, the optimal insurance {{policy is a}} generalized insurance layer (that is, either an insurance layer or a stop-loss insurance). This optimal insurance decision problem is resolved by first converting it into three different sub-problems {{similar to those in}} Jin and Zhou (2008); however, as we now demand a more regular optimal solution, a completely different approach has been developed to tackle them. When the premium is regarded as a decision variable and there is no risk loading, the optimal indemnity schedule in this form has no deductibles but a cap; further results also suggests that the <b>deductible</b> <b>amount</b> will be reduced if the risk loading is decreased. As a whole, our paper provides a theoretical explanation for the popularity of limited coverage insurance policies in the market as observed by many socio-economists, which serves as a mathematical bridge between behavioral finance and actuarial science. © 2011 Elsevier B.

The company, founded in 1962, is a large heavy machinery manufacturer. Packer’s balance sheet at December 31, 1997 includes a deferred tax asset of approximately $ 22 million related to net future deductible temporary differences. However, realization of the deferred tax asset is dependent upon profitable operations in the U. S. and abroad, and future reversals of existing temporary differences.

Management has carefully considered various factors in assessing the probability of realizing these deferred tax benefits.

40|$|The {{relationship}} IRS – taxpayer {{runs the}} risk of turning into a psychological war in which, however, given the positions held, the IRS is by far on a favorable footing. Between the apparently excessively formal position held by the IRS, which seems to conceal behind the laws, and the sometimes forced interpretation of the laws, by the taxpayer, there are the courts of law, also disturbed by the legislative changes which appear to have entered a perpetual motion. The objective of the fiscal administration regarding the value added tax is to combat tax evasion and fraud. It is very important to combat evasion in the VAT field because it represents the indirect tax of the largest share in the consolidated general budget. VAT evasion represents the intention of not paying the tax, withholding or not declaring it, or requesting its refund which would not be fit, due to the exaggeration of the <b>deductible</b> <b>amount</b> of the VAT.

40|$|Abstract Background Consumer {{directed}} {{health care}} proposes that patients will engage as informed consumers {{of health care}} services by sharing in more of their medical costs, often through deductibles. We examined knowledge of deductible plan details among new enrollees, as well as anticipated care-seeking changes {{in response to the}} deductible. Methods In a large integrated delivery system with a range of deductible-based health plans which varied in services included or exempted from deductible, we conducted a mixed-method, cross-sectional telephone interview study. Results Among 458 adults newly enrolled in a deductible plan (71 % response rate), 51 % knew they had a deductible, 26 % knew the <b>deductible</b> <b>amount,</b> and 6 % knew which medical services were included or exempted from their deductible. After adjusting for respondent characteristics, those with more deductible-applicable services and those with lower self-reported health status {{were significantly more likely to}} know they had a deductible. Among those who knew of their deductible, half anticipated that it would cause them to delay or avoid medical care, including avoiding doctor's office visits and medical tests, even services that they believed were medically necessary. Many expressed concern about their costs, anticipating the inability to afford care and expressing the desire to change plans. Conclusion Early in their experience with a deductible, patients had limited awareness of the deductible and little knowledge of the details.

Up until the late 19802 ̆ 7 s, risk control services were provided to clients as a customer service, with the costs hidden in the premiums. Many companies estimated 4 - 5 percent of the premium amount was devoted to risk control departments. The late 1980 s brought about a change that some attribute to a misapplication of Deming 2 ̆ 7 s Total Quality Management (TQM) philosophy. Insurance companies tried to make the move to accountability, thinking that it would drive customer service to a 2 ̆ 2 Deming 2 ̆ 2 level and would create even higher profits. To accomplish this, companies made every department, including customer service functions such as risk control, profit centers. Risk control services that were previously funded through hidden costs were now sold at a rate of 130 - 200 per hour. Within companies, departments that traditionally had worked together began to avoid each other because of internal cost factors.

However, Medicare coverage is not complete and the additional costs are substantial: for example, the hospital deductible for part A is $ 956 and the part B <b>deductible</b> <b>amounts</b> to $ 123 in 2006. The elderly can insure against these financial risks by obtaining supplemental insurance from different sources. A private market designed to cover the "gaps" in Medicare {{is known as the}} "Medigap" market. This market is regulated since 1992 by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990. The law created markets with homogenous goods mainly by standardizing the policies that could be offered. Economic theory predicts that in a market for homogenous goods, there should be little or no price variation. However, premiums of Medigap policies continue to vary even within narrowly defined markets. This dissertation is concerned with finding economic explanations for this puzzle. Sources of premium variation in the Medigap market are empirically investigated as well as reasons for why premium variation is sustained. Chapter one provides a general overview of the Medigap market and points out specific peculiarities due to the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990. In the second chapter, which is joint work with Nicole Maestas and Dana Goldman, differences in the populations covered by insurance firms are investigated with respect to their impact on actuarially fair premiums. The third chapter focuses on how firms set prices for specific components of Medigap premiums and how these change over time. Also, the degree to which firm and state specific variables explain premium variation is investigated. The fourth chapter (joint with Nicole Maestas and Dana Goldman) targets the consumer side of the Medigap market by estimating a structural model that allows for sustained price variation due to consumer search costs. The findings in this dissertation suggest that premium variation is at least partially caused by firm specific differences The premium variation is sustained through consumer search costs and thus uninformed consumers. However, there are some indications that the market experienced an increase in competition that reduces premium variation...|$|R
