40|$|From Wall Street to Washington, from boardrooms to union halls, -what {{anybody with}} power is most scared of is change. Any kind of change. " Lee lacocca, Former President, Ford Motor Corp. and Chrysler Corp. (Quoted in O'Toole, 1995) The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to develop a scale to measure middle <b>management</b> support <b>for</b> organisational improvement. Middle <b>management</b> support <b>for</b> improvement is critical to the achievement of high performance, and can therefore be described as an enabler of high performance. The EFQM Excellence Model, the primary organisational excellence award in Europe, also describes enablers of high performance, but it does not include middle <b>management</b> support <b>for</b> improvement. Although the literature includes many articles on the importance of middle <b>management</b> support <b>for</b> improvement, {{there is a lack of}} information on methods for measuring it. Research is undertaken to identify the primary attributes of middle <b>management</b> support <b>for</b> improvement. The resulting questionnaire is used to collect data on middle <b>management</b> support <b>for</b> improvement in four organisations in the US and the UK. The reliability of the questionnaire is evaluated, and the questionnaire is revised based upon the findings. The revised questionnaire is shown to have strong validity and reliability. The relationship between organisational performance and middle <b>management</b> support <b>for</b> organisational improvement is discussed. A shortened version of the EFQM Excellence Model self-assessment is developed. Data are collected using this questionnaire at the four participating organisations. The results of the EFQM and middle management support questionnaires are compared. There appears to be a correlation between middle <b>management</b> support <b>for</b> improvement and the EFQM enablers, but more research is needed in this area. The primary contribution {{of this research is}} the development of a reliable and valid scale to measure middle <b>management</b> support <b>for</b> improvement. Recommendations are provided for further research opportunities...|$|R
