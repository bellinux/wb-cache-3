40|$|A flow cytometric {{technique}} for scoring {{the incidence of}} micro-nucleated reticulocytes in rat peripheral blood was compared to a standard microscopy-based procedure. For these studies, groups of five male Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with vehicle or {{a broad range of}} chemical genotoxicants: 6 -thioguanine, N-methyl-N-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine, vincristine, <b>methylaziridine,</b> acetal-dehyde, methyl methanesulfonate, benzene, monocrotaline, and azathioprine. Animals were treated once a day for up to 2 days, and peripheral blood was collected between 24 and 48 h after the final administration. These samples were processed for flow cyto-metric scoring and microscopy-based analysis using supravital acridine orange staining, and the percentage of reticulocytes and micronucleated reticulocytes was determined for each sample. The resulting data demonstrate good agreement between these scoring methodologies, although careful execution of the flow cytometri...|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} (aryltriazolyl) <b>methylaziridines</b> were {{synthesized}} and evaluated as selective inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinase- 2. They constitute a novel class of hydroxamic acid-free matrix metalloproteinase inhibitors. The triazole fragment {{serves as a}} linker between the hydrophilic aziridine and the lipophilic part of the molecule. The best inhibition was observed with 1 -(aziridin- 2 -ylmethyl) - 4 -(4 -butylphenyl) - 1 H- 1, 2, 3 -triazole and 1 -(aziridin- 2 -ylmethyl) - 4 -phenyl- 1 H- 1, 2, 3 -triazole that selectively inhibited MMP- 2 at 73 % in 20 μM concentration and at 75 % in 10 μM concentration, respectively...|$|R
