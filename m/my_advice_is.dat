Darwin wrote [...] "I would urge {{you not to}} publish it for some months, at the soonest, & then consider whether you think it new & important enough to counterbalance the evils; remembering the cart-loads which have been published on this subject. – The evils on giving pain to others, & injuring your own power & usefulness... It is an old doctrine of mine {{that it is of}} foremost importance for a young author to publish.. only what is very good & new... remember that an enemy might ask who is this man... that he should give to the world his opinions on the deepest subjects?... but <b>my</b> <b>advice</b> <b>is</b> to pause, pause, pause." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{chaffinch}} {{was once}} popular as a caged song bird and {{large numbers of}} wild birds were trapped and sold. At {{the end of the}} 19th century trapping even depleted the number of birds in London parks. In 1882 the English publisher Samuel Orchart Beeton issued a guide on the care of caged birds and included the recommendation: [...] "To parents and guardians plagued with a morose and sulky boy, <b>my</b> <b>advice</b> <b>is,</b> buy him a chaffinch." [...] Competitions were held where bets were placed on which caged chaffinch would repeat its song the greatest number of times. The birds were sometimes blinded with a hot needle in the belief that this encouraged them to sing. This practice is the subject of the poem The Blinded Bird by the English author Thomas Hardy which contrasts the cruelty involved in blinding the birds with their zestful song. In Britain the practice of keeping chaffinches as pets declined after the trapping of wild birds was outlawed by the Wild Birds Protection Acts of 1880 to 1896.|$|E

60|$|Æge. By <b>my</b> <b>advice,</b> <b>Being</b> {{past all}} hope of children, He took, embraced, and owned you for his son.|$|R
6000|$|... "Had <b>my</b> <b>advice</b> <b>been</b> heeded," [...] said he, [...] "one or {{the other}} would have been your goal. But your mother took counsel with Messer Arcolano." ...|$|R
60|$|As <b>my</b> <b>advice</b> <b>was</b> by far {{the easiest}} to follow, we ended by {{adopting}} it, and contrived to embrace the gunwale and give her her head.|$|R
6000|$|... "There, {{that will}} do, Mr. Starbottle, thank you. Now <b>my</b> <b>advice</b> <b>is</b> {{to get away}} from here while you can. I'll look after Folinsbee. Do you hear?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't {{worry about}} us!" [...] Bob shouted angrily. [...] "We're {{glad to get}} rid of you at any price; but <b>my</b> <b>advice</b> <b>is</b> that you give Nassau a pretty wide berth!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nor {{to raise}} curiosity which you don't mean to satisfy," [...] {{retorted}} his friend; [...] "however, <b>my</b> <b>advice</b> <b>is,</b> that {{you accept the}} Captain's offer, and trust to your uncle's generosity." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You are my prisoners, gentlemen," [...] {{said the}} sailor, as he advanced; [...] "resistance is useless, and without it you shall receive favor. Ha, Miss Plowden! <b>my</b> <b>advice</b> <b>was</b> {{that you should}} not be present at this scene." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The nursery {{screen that}} you bought {{yesterday}} by <b>my</b> <b>advice</b> <b>was</b> decorated by Jessie and Kate Seaward, so I {{thought it would}} be nice to let you see for yourself how sweet and `deserving' are the poor people whom you have befriended!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And then, {{when all}} the world will know it, how is your mother {{to be kept in}} the dark? And that which she fears and anticipates is as bad, probably, as the actual truth. If <b>my</b> <b>advice</b> <b>be</b> {{followed}} nothing will be kept from her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, <b>my</b> <b>advice</b> <b>is,</b> {{keep your}} eyes wide open all the time," [...] said Songbird. [...] "Those fellows are desperate--their actions show it--and they'll play you foul if they get half a chance." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Osborn felt disturbed, {{because she}} {{wondered}} how much he had heard, but he went on carelessly: [...] "Gerald's too young for one to trust his judgment. <b>My</b> <b>advice</b> <b>is,</b> leave the thing alone." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, if you {{are angry}} {{because you want to}} do magical things and can't, and if you don't want to get angry at all, <b>my</b> <b>advice</b> <b>is</b> not to want to do magical things." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Had <b>my</b> <b>advice</b> <b>been</b> asked, a year ago, I {{should have}} voted to {{preserve}} the Alliance [with YOU] which we {{had been used to}} for sixteen years [strictly for twelve, though in substance ever since 1740], and which was by nature advantageous to us. But if <b>my</b> <b>advice</b> <b>were</b> asked just now, I should answer, That the said method being now impossible, we are {{in the case of a}} ship's captain who defends himself the best he can, and when all resources are exhausted, has, rather than surrender on shameful conditions, to fire the powder-magazine, and blow up his ship. You remember that of your Francois I."--FORS L'HONNEUR; ah yes, very well!--"Perhaps it will be my poor Children who will be the victims of these past errors,"--for such I still think them, I for my part.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't want to {{take any}} liberties," [...] Bullsom said, [...] "and I'm afraid I forget {{sometimes}} who you are, but that's your fault, seeing that you will call yourself only Mr. Kingston Brooks when you're by rights a lord. But {{if you were the}} Prince of Wales I'd still say that <b>my</b> <b>advice</b> <b>was</b> good. Forgive your father anything you've got against him, and start afresh." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ah!' said Mrs Nickleby, {{with great}} fervour, 'if <b>my</b> <b>advice</b> had <b>been</b> {{taken at the}} beginning--Well, I have always done MY duty, and that's some comfort.' ...|$|R
6000|$|Suddenly she interrupted. [...] "Tell me," [...] she said, [...] "one thing.... I confess," [...] she explained, [...] "I've no {{business}} to ask. But if I'm to advise----If <b>my</b> <b>advice</b> <b>is</b> {{to be worth}} anything...." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I say,' {{returned}} Mr. Micawber, quite forgetting himself, {{and smiling}} again, 'the miserable wretch you behold. <b>My</b> <b>advice</b> <b>is,</b> never do tomorrow {{what you can}} do today. Procrastination is the thief of time. Collar him!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I think not," [...] replied Slagg; [...] "if all's true {{that one}} hears, {{there is not}} much honesty afloat in them seas. <b>My</b> <b>advice</b> <b>is</b> to stay where we are and see what turns up." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then {{your first}} {{assumption}} must be correct," [...] she declared. [...] "You cannot explain things to me, so I cannot help you even with <b>my</b> <b>advice.</b> I <b>am</b> sorry." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "If you're {{looking for}} {{emotional}} satisfaction, <b>my</b> <b>advice</b> to you <b>is</b> seek professional help." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] {{answered}} the Countess, and her eye flashed fire as she spoke; [...] "and had <b>my</b> <b>advice</b> <b>been</b> listened to, {{they had been}} apprehended in the very fact; and so dealt with, as to be a warning to all others how they sought this independent principality on such an errand. But my son, who is generally so culpably negligent of his own affairs, was pleased to assume the management of them upon this crisis." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'That's a laudable {{proceeding}} on {{the part}} of our aunt, at all events,' said Steerforth, when I mentioned it; 'and one deserving of all encouragement. Daisy, <b>my</b> <b>advice</b> <b>is</b> that you take kindly to Doctors' Commons.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I see {{no signs}} at present--but understanding--" [...] {{emphasizing}} the word, [...] "is more general than you imagine, and no secrets must be told. <b>My</b> <b>advice</b> <b>is</b> 'Millions for defence, {{and not a}} cent for tribute.'" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But you can't do anything," [...] said he, {{when there}} came a pause. [...] "This {{is a case in}} which there is nothing to do. <b>My</b> <b>advice</b> <b>is</b> that you go away for a time, and try to get over it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "As long as Lord Charles honours me {{so far as}} to ask <b>my</b> <b>advice</b> I <b>am</b> {{sure that}} he would not place me in the false {{position}} of having that advice disregarded." ...|$|R
60|$|She took <b>my</b> <b>advice</b> and <b>was</b> {{turning to}} put it into execution, when her eyes lighted on Oofty-Oofty, {{immediately}} before her, his body instinct with alertness and grace as he held the turn of the rope.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{confess that}} at first I was disappointed. But after a while, I {{reflected}} that, if people would not take <b>my</b> <b>advice,</b> it <b>was</b> more their loss than mine, and I dismissed the matter from my mind.|$|R
60|$|<b>My</b> <b>advice</b> <b>is</b> that Mr. Cramer {{does not}} resign {{until he is}} asked to. Simpson I do not suppose will be {{disturbed}} in his position. He is very competent, and the soul of honor, both qualities wanted in the Sub-treasury.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm 'fraid so, your Majesty. Of course, {{they may}} not be dangerous, but we mustn't take chances. Enough {{accidents}} happen to us poor Loons as it is, and <b>my</b> <b>advice</b> <b>is</b> to condemn and perforate 'em as quickly as possible." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "True, lad," [...] replied Barney, {{knitting}} {{his brows}} and looking extremely sagacious; [...] "the fact is, since {{neither of us}} knows nothing about anything, or the way to any place, <b>my</b> <b>advice</b> <b>is</b> to walk straight for'ard till we come to something." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Lady Hunterleys," [...] {{he begged}} earnestly, [...] "please take <b>my</b> <b>advice.</b> I <b>am</b> your friend, you know. I {{want you to}} go {{straight}} to your room. I will come with you. I will explain to you then--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 25. I was so lazy to-day that I dined at next door,(9) {{and have}} sat at home since six, {{writing to the}} Bishop of Clogher, Dean Sterne, and Mr. Manley: the last, because I am in fear for him about his place, and have sent him my opinion, what I and his other friends here {{think he ought to}} do. I hope he will take it well. <b>My</b> <b>advice</b> <b>was,</b> to keep as much in favour as {{possible}} with Sir Thomas Frankland, his master here.|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{came to me}} {{with his}} troubles," [...] said Captain Trimblett, {{bunching}} up his gray beard in his hand reflectively. [...] "Leastways, he made a remark or two which I took up. Acting under <b>my</b> <b>advice</b> he <b>is</b> taking up gardening." ...|$|R
