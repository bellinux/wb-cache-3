40|$|Abstract * Multicast is {{a common}} method for distributing audio and video over the Internet. Since {{receivers}} are heterogeneous in processing capability, network bandwidth, and requirements for video quality, a single multicast stream is usually insufficient. A common strategy is to use layered video coding with multiple <b>multicast</b> <b>groups.</b> In this scheme, a receiver adjusts its video quality by selecting the number of <b>multicast</b> <b>groups,</b> and thereby video layers, it receives. Implementing this scheme requires the receivers to decide when to join a new group or leave a subscribed group. This paper presents a new solution to the join/leave problem using ThinStreams. In ThinStreams, a single video layer is multicast over several <b>multicast</b> <b>groups,</b> each with identical bandwidth. ThinStreams separates the coding scheme (i. e., the video layers) from control (i. e., the <b>multicast</b> <b>groups),</b> helping to bound network oscillations caused by receivers joining and leaving high bandwidth <b>multicast</b> <b>groups.</b> This work evaluates the join/leave algorithms used in ThinStreams using simulations and preliminary experiments on the MBONE. It also addresses fairness among independent video broadcasts and shows how to prevent interference between them. 1...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{challenging}} problems in network security is to provide security in <b>multicast</b> <b>groups</b> as they are more vulnerable to attacks. In dynamic <b>multicast</b> <b>groups</b> the frequent joins and evictions is the major issue that makes to provide security. In the literature, most proposed solutions do not take this parameter into consideration and so suffer from the scalability problem. Group key must be updated and distributed securely and efficiently within the group, whenever membership changes. The key distribution problem is the major problem in the dynamic groups. Secure key distribution is one such solution in dynamic <b>multicast</b> <b>groups.</b> In this paper, an efficient security to the group key is provided in dynamic <b>multicast</b> <b>groups</b> than earlier developed. This is because distribution of group key to members. A Hybrid key tree is proposed here with each node as a group member. The main advantages are less storage of keys for each member, the sponsor node selection burden is reduced during join or leave, takes less computations and the tree size is minimum than the earlier methods...|$|R
40|$|In sensor networks, {{there is}} a lot of {{overlapping}} <b>multicast</b> <b>groups</b> because of many subscribers, associated with their potentially varying specific interests, querying every event to sensors/publishers. Also gossip-based communication protocols are promising as one of potential solutions providing scalability in P(Publish) / S(Subscribe) paradigm in sensor networks. Moreover, despite the importance of both guaranteeing message delivery order and supporting overlapping <b>multicast</b> <b>groups</b> in sensor or P 2 P networks, there exist little research works on development of gossip-based protocols to satisfy all these requirements. In this paper, we present a causally ordered delivery guaranteeing protocol for overlapping <b>multicast</b> <b>groups,</b> based on sensor-brokers as delegates. In the protocol based on sensor-broker, sensor-broker might lead to make overlapping <b>multicast</b> <b>groups</b> organized by subscriber's interests. The message delivery order has been guaranteed consistently and all multicast messages are delivered to overlapping groups using gossip-based protocols by the sensor-broker. Therefore, these features of the protocol based on sensor-broker might be significantly scalable rather than those of the protocols by coordinated groups like traditional committee protocols...|$|R

IPv6 uses the address block with the prefix ff00::/8 for multicast applications.

40|$|In {{many large}} scale data {{dissemination}} systems, {{a large number}} of information flows must be delivered to {{a large number of}} information receivers. However, because of differences in interests among receivers, not all receivers are interested in all of the information flows. Multicasting provides the opportunity to deliver a subset of the information flows to a subset of the receivers. With a limited number of <b>multicast</b> <b>groups</b> available, the channelization problem is to find an optimal mapping of information flows to a fixed number of <b>multicast</b> <b>groups,</b> and a subscription mapping of receivers to <b>multicast</b> <b>groups</b> so as to minimize a function of the total bandwidth consumed and the amount of unwanted information received by receivers. In this paper, we formally define two versions of the channelization problem and subscription problem (a subcomponent of the channelization problem). We analyze the complexity of each version of the channelization problem and show that they are both NP-complete. We also find that the subscription problem is NP-complete when one flow can be assigned to multiple <b>multicast</b> <b>groups.</b> We also study and compare different approximation algorithms to solve the channelization problem, finding that one particular heuristic, flow-basedmerge, finds good solutions over a range of problem configurations. 1...|$|R

30|$|In {{the above}} evaluation, we have {{neglected}} {{the effect of}} the queries needed to maintain the membership to <b>multicast</b> <b>groups</b> used to transport announcement data. Clearly, this effect is present only when announcements are multi-casted. We suggest two possible approaches to take this effect into account and limit the performance penalty to a negligible level. The first one is to use an IGMPT 2 timer value larger than IGMPT 1 (e.g., 10 times larger), so as to have a lower rate, and thus a lower impact of the responses to queries on the signaling server. The other approach consists of both using IGMPT 2 > > IGMPT 1 and sending a General Query upon expiration of the IGMPT 2 timer at ASN-GW. In this way, irrespective of the number of the <b>multicast</b> <b>groups</b> the client has joined, it will answer by means of a single Report message, listing all <b>multicast</b> <b>groups</b> [5]. In both approaches, the additional resource consumption is negligible.|$|R

50|$|In IPv4 {{it is very}} {{difficult}} for an organization to get even one globally routable <b>multicast</b> <b>group</b> assignment, and the implementation of inter-domain solutions is arcane. Unicast address assignments by a local Internet registry for IPv6 have at least a 64-bit routing prefix, yielding the smallest subnet size available in IPv6 (also 64 bits). With such an assignment it is possible to embed the unicast address prefix into the IPv6 multicast address format, while still providing a 32-bit block, the least significant bits of the address, or approximately 4.2 billion <b>multicast</b> <b>group</b> identifiers. Thus each user of an IPv6 subnet automatically has available a set of globally routable source-specific multicast groups for multicast applications.|$|E

In this paper, we present a novel multicast layering protocol where the sender proactively distributes FEC repair packets among multiple <b>multicast</b> <b>groups.</b> Receivers can selectively tune in to a subset of these <b>multicast</b> <b>groups</b> to obtain only the number of repair packets they require. We present a highly efficient algorithm that dynamically determines the optimal distribution of FEC repair packets to a given (small constant) number of <b>multicast</b> <b>groups.</b> The running time of this algorithm is independent {{of the number of}} receivers in the multicast session, and it is hence scalable.
