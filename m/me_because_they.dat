25|$|In a 2005 {{interview}} with Pearce, he recalls the event:This {{has to do}} with politics, not to do with <b>me</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> had a local election and they thought I was going to bring an army of skinheads to Lausanne and destroy the city. Because they've heard from someone in Germany who contacted a policeman in Bern. And the policeman in Bern contacted the authorities in Lausanne. This is like gossip. This is like fishwives. This is like old women. I don't care about old women gossiping. If {{at the end of the}} day, it means I don't play, good, I don't want to play in the city of old women talking about people behind their backs. And they are so stupid they believe in all the rumours.|$|E
500|$|I {{have faith}} in my fans. I believe they will come through for <b>me,</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> always have. My house is not {{complete}} without an American Moonman, and I would say 'Touch My Body' deserves one. Brett Ratner directed it, I have a unicorn in there, I have [...] in there — who else has that?" ...|$|E
500|$|Scientology critic Andreas Heldal-Lund {{stated that}} the Church of Scientology views {{candidates}} for the test as [...] "raw meat from the street". [...] "You're told you're worth nothing," [...] he said. Heldal-Lund stated that, [...] "thousands of desperate parents contact <b>me</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> have children who have had major mental problems, or taken their own life after similar circumstances to Kaja Ballo". Scientology-associated celebrity, Hank Von Helvete, commented to the press that he thought psychiatry, not Scientology, {{was the cause of}} Ballo's suicide. TV 2 reported that psychologists advised that subsequent to the personality test, there should be proper follow-up attention with the subject. In an analysis of personality tests available online on social networking sites, Norwegian Psychological Association department advisor Andreas Høstmælingen cited Kaja Ballo as [...] "an example of how wrong things can go". The Norwegian Psychological Association warned individuals against taking such types of personality tests.|$|E
6000|$|... "I will. I {{suppose the}} reason they didn't come back for <b>me</b> is <b>because</b> <b>they</b> were {{in a hurry to}} get to Eastport and see Mr. Carrington before he went off to Chambersburgh." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why?" [...] {{said the}} old man, with a sudden burst of {{impotent}} passion. [...] "YOU ask <b>me</b> why! <b>Because</b> <b>they</b> {{are going to the}} rendezvous again. They are going to seek him. Do you understand--to seek HIM--the Coyote!" ...|$|R
6000|$|They know well, Master, [...] That all I {{said was}} {{but to make}} them argue. [...] They've pushed me in to make a mock of <b>me,</b> [...] <b>Because</b> <b>they</b> knew I could take either side [...] And beat them at it.|$|R
500|$|On September 11, 1970, Hendrix {{gave his}} final {{interview}} in his suite at the Cumberland Hotel in London, where he talked with Keith Altham, a journalist for Record Mirror. During the interview, Hendrix confirmed reports that Billy Cox, the bass player in his band, The Jimi Hendrix Experience, was leaving. Cox, who had been suffering from severe exhaustion and was exhibiting symptoms of paranoia, mutually agreed with Hendrix that they should suspend their plans to collaborate musically. When Altham asked Hendrix: [...] "Do you feel any kind of compulsion to prove yourself as King Guitar", Hendrix replied: [...] "No, I don't even let that bother <b>me.</b> <b>Because</b> <b>they</b> {{say a lot of}} things about people that, if they let it bother them, they wouldn't even be around today... King Guitar now? Wow, that's a bit heavy." [...] Altham also suggested that Hendrix invented psychedelic music, to which he laughed and replied: [...] "A mad scientist approach... I don't consider [...] the invention of psychedelic, it's just asking a lot of questions." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Give It Away" [...] {{was made by}} French fashion {{photographer}} and director Stéphane Sednaoui. Kiedis wanted the video to be visually distinct and readily identifiable but disliked much of the material Warner Bros. sent for him to choose from: [...] "I started viewing reels and reels and reels of video directors but nothing looked good to me. Everything was the same, boring, homogenized, contrived shit." [...] Upon finding Sednaoui's reel, however, Kiedis noticed it was [...] "like nothing else. It was slower and poetic, shot in black and white. It seemed like authentic art, not something shot for MTV." [...] He and Flea met with Sednaoui {{to talk about the}} video, for which the director proposed a [...] "very desolated [...] very graphic landscape," [...] while heavily focusing on the band members with little to no outside influence. It was decided that the video would be filmed in black and white while Sednaoui took the idea of painting the band members with silver acrylic from previous photo shoots he had done. Sednaoui recalls that he was [...] "amazed by what [...] gave <b>me</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> went far far far beyond what I was expecting and I think that's one of my best experiences in that regard". The overall mood of the video was intended to be a personification of the song, which is upbeat and lively.|$|E
2500|$|... "This one, it {{just really}} baffled <b>me</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> said they couldn't find any {{paperwork}} or documentation about her." ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{very first}} {{rehearsal}} I did with Perpetuum Jazzile, I practised a song I'd written called 'Anything can happen’… They were so fantastically good. For <b>me,</b> that's <b>because</b> <b>they</b> have {{spent so much}} time together, so the friendship they have, that comes out in the music. Peder Karlsson ...|$|R
60|$|As I say, in {{obedience}} to {{the tradition of the}} Standings I went to war and found that I had no aptitude for war. So did my officers find <b>me</b> out, <b>because</b> <b>they</b> made <b>me</b> a quartermaster's clerk, and as a clerk, at a desk, I fought through the Spanish-American War.|$|R
6000|$|... "'Tain't {{my right}} name. They {{used to call}} me Phil at home, but the sailors all call <b>me</b> Polly here, <b>because</b> <b>they</b> say I act like a girl." ...|$|R
2500|$|My hope is [...] {{would reach}} {{some of the}} people who were just out there looking for {{something}} to get them through another day. When I wrote the poem two years ago and people started coming to <b>me</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> just needed to talk after hearing it, I realized this is not a Canadian problem or an American problem, it’s everywhere...I believe the bullies must be forgiven. That’s how we heal.|$|E
2500|$|... "Most agents {{would avoid}} <b>me</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> knew what I wanted to do—what agent wants to book their big client in a no pay, $800-a-day, two-day shoot?" [...] he said. [...] "The truth is, I {{had a lot}} of friends who were in this movie. And if they didn't say yes, this movie wouldn't have gotten made." [...] In the end, most of the actors were willing to take part because the film only {{required}} a few days of their time and often allowed them to play a character outside of their wheelhouse.|$|E
2500|$|Just as Lancashire's tail {{had pushed}} {{on at the}} end of their innings, so did Somerset's on the third day. Blackwell made his second century in two innings, finally {{surrendering}} on 122. The second-highest scorer was Richard Johnson with 40. Blackwell explained, [...] "I've changed a few things this year and started to bat on off stump. A lot of bowlers have been going across <b>me</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> know that I go at widish balls. The ball's now closer to me if it's slanted across and I'm backing my hand-eye co-ordination to avoid being lbw." [...] The day itself was very cold, with Blackwell saying, [...] "It was absolutely perishing out there. I think play should be abandoned if it gets that cold." [...] After Somerset were dismissed for 272, six Somerset men came out to field sporting woollen hats. Bad light and rain meant the day ended at 2.07pm, with Lancashire on 33 for 1, 84 runs ahead. Whilst a Lancashire victory was not out of the question, the most likely result was the draw.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I {{could make}} myself {{understood}} among them <b>because</b> <b>they</b> still talk a corrupt Zulu, as {{do all the}} tribes in those parts. At first they wanted to kill me, but let <b>me</b> go <b>because</b> <b>they</b> thought that I was mad. Everyone thinks that I am mad, Allan; {{it is a kind}} of public delusion, whereas I think that I am sane and that most other people are mad." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do {{not look}} so uncomfortable, both of you," [...] she begged. [...] "Those young men startled <b>me</b> at first, <b>because</b> <b>they</b> knew my name. I am quite sure though {{that they did}} not mean to be rude." ...|$|R
6000|$|At every motion undertook, The vulgar all consult my look. I {{sometimes}} {{give advice}} in writing, But never {{of my own}} inditing. [...] I am a courtier in my way; For those who raised me, I betray; And some give out that I entice To lust, to luxury, and dice. Who punishments on <b>me</b> inflict, <b>Because</b> <b>they</b> find their pockets pickt. [...] By riding post, I lose my health, And only to get others wealth.|$|R
2500|$|Janet Arvizo first {{approached}} attorney Bill Dickerman {{to discuss}} taking {{legal action against}} Martin Bashir. Dickerman referred her to Larry Feldman, the attorney who represented Jordan Chandler , the first accuser, in 1993. Feldman then contacted child psychologist Stan Katz, who told Santa Barbara sheriff's investigator Paul Zelis that [...] "Mr. Feldman actually referred these kids to <b>me.</b> <b>Because</b> <b>they</b> {{had come to him}} in this lawsuit." [...] It was then that allegations of child molestation surfaced, and Katz reported this to the authorities, as is compulsory for someone in his profession in such cases. He said in a taped conversation that he didn't consider Jackson a pedophile but a [...] "regressed 10-year-old." [...] Larry Feldman was the attorney who helped Jordan Chandler win an out-of-court settlement reportedly for $20million, and Dr. Katz was the psychologist that assisted Evan Chandler in uncovering whether his son was suffering abuse. The defense later focused on Feldman and Katz, stressing that Janet went to the same people who helped obtain a settlement from Jackson in 1993 prior to ever going to the police. The circumstances by which the Arvizos' allegations surfaced aroused suspicion over their claims and caused some to believe that the family was merely seeking money. Others believed that Janet sought legal advice perhaps because she was afraid that she could be charged with child endangerment for allowing her sons to sleep in Jackson's bed.|$|E
6000|$|He {{explained}} to Wetmore: [...] "They have <b>me</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> partly own me. Dryfoos is Fulkerson's financial backer in 'Every Other Week'." ...|$|E
6000|$|It {{cleared the}} case as he had wished. [...] "Cease to require <b>me</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> won't care?" [...] She paused with that sketch of her idea.|$|E
5000|$|Natasha Lyonne had {{intended}} to audition for the part of Lorna Morello but, according to Lyonne, [...] "they wouldn’t let <b>me</b> for Morello, <b>because</b> <b>they</b> already liked <b>me</b> for Nicky." [...] Yael Stone, who had auditioned {{for the role of}} Nichols, was cast as Morello.|$|R
6000|$|They talked it over, {{and they}} {{was going to}} rule <b>me</b> out, <b>because</b> <b>they</b> said every boy must have a family or {{somebody}} to kill, or else it wouldn't be fair and square for the others. Well, nobody could {{think of anything to}} do--everybody was stumped, and set still. I was most ready to cry; but all at once I thought of a way, and so I offered them Miss Watson--they could kill her. Everybody said: ...|$|R
60|$|This {{amanuensis}} {{was very}} different from any other I had had. The others worked to make money for themselves, or to please <b>me,</b> or <b>because</b> <b>they</b> liked it. This one worked from principle. The money which I paid for her labor did not become her money. It was paid to the House of Martha. She sat there and wrote to promote the principles upon which the House of Martha was founded. In fact, so far as I was concerned, she {{was nothing more than a}} principle.|$|R
60|$|I {{write in}} phrases that the evangelical Christianity of my {{childhood}} made familiar to <b>me,</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> are the most expressive phrases I have ever met for the psychological facts with which I am dealing.|$|E
60|$|They had {{not taken}} my revolvers or {{ammunition}} away from <b>me</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> {{did not know what}} they were; but my heavy rifle I had lost. They simply left it where it had lain beside me.|$|E
60|$|But now nobody shot at <b>me</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> {{all thought}} {{the boy was}} killed and were {{gathered}} round him looking very solemn. Only I saw that the Red-faced Man had Tom by the neck and was kicking him hard.|$|E
2500|$|Eastwood {{received}} a percentage-based salary, unlike {{the first two}} films where he {{received a}} straight fee salary. When Lee Van Cleef was again cast for another Dollars film, he joked [...] "the only reason they brought <b>me</b> back was <b>because</b> <b>they</b> forgot to kill me off in For A Few Dollars More".|$|R
5000|$|Regarding Robinson's {{theological}} {{influences in}} Gilead, she herself has explained {{the importance of}} primary Calvinist texts, particularly Calvin's Institutes of the Christian Religion. In regard to Calvin’s Institutes, Robinson states in her Yves Simone lecture entitled [...] "The Freedom of a Christian," [...] that “one of the reasons these texts are important to <b>me</b> is <b>because</b> <b>they</b> have {{everything to do with}} my own theology certainly, with my aesthetic perhaps, and in so far as I can say I have an intention in writing, they have everything to do with my intention”.|$|R
6000|$|... "But, good God, Zoe!" [...] he exclaimed, [...] "do {{you know}} what it is that you are asking me? Do you want me to go into court and say--'That isn't the man... It is I who am the murderer'? Do you want me to feel their hands upon my shoulder, to be put there in the dock and have all the people staring at <b>me</b> curiously <b>because</b> <b>they</b> know that before very long I am to stand upon the {{scaffold}} and have that rope around my neck and--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What the blazes {{has that}} got to do with you?" [...] demanded the skipper. [...] "Look here, my lads; don’t you play any of your little games on <b>me,</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> won’t do. You’re both of you as drunk as owls." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Because {{my friends}} are {{in the habit of}} telling me (and each other) that the sea is my only love. They were always {{chaffing}} <b>me</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> couldn’t see or guess in my life at any woman, open or secret. [...] .” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh! It's {{curious that}} you seem proud of it. In this case, I don't mind your keeping <b>me,</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> can't {{drive up the}} birds until we have crossed the higher moor. It will annoy Gladwyne and his keeper, and I'm not pleased with either of them. I wanted Flo Marple's station at the first butts." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I do {{not mind}} that," [...] said Kenneth, quietly. [...] "It was my desire {{that the voters}} should fully {{understand}} {{the issues of the}} campaign. Then, if they vote against <b>me,</b> it is <b>because</b> <b>they</b> are not worthy of honest representation in the Legislature, and I shall in the future leave them to their own devices." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Master, for so I {{will still}} call you who am not yet upon {{the land of}} Egypt where you have promised me freedom, do you {{remember}} anything strange about the people of that tribe from among whom you and the Egyptian soldiers captured <b>me</b> by surprise, <b>because</b> <b>they</b> wished to drive you and your following from their country?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Davies of Louder Than the Music {{gave his}} journey {{with respect to}} A Way to See in the Dark that [...] "It {{took a while for}} this album to grow on <b>me,</b> not <b>because</b> <b>they</b> are bad songs or 'growers', but it took me a good few listens to get what the message and themes of the album were trying to convey. Once I got that, and sat back and took in the songs as they were, I {{understood}} what Jason is trying to do with this album. Even when we are in hard times and dark places, God is still there".|$|R
