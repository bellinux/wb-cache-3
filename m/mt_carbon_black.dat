The <b>carbon</b> <b>black</b> loading used was from 0 to 50 phr and ferrite loading was fixed at 80 phr. <b>Carbon</b> <b>black</b> grades N 330 and N 660 were used in this work. The scorch time decreased {{with the addition of}} <b>carbon</b> <b>black</b> in ferrite filled NR composites whereas the cure time increased. The tensile strength and elongation at break of ferrite filled natural rubber composites were found to decrease with the increase of both types <b>carbon</b> <b>black</b> loading. However, the stress at 100 % elongation (M 100) and stress modulus at 300 % elongation (M 300) exhibit an increasing trend. The microstructure showed that filler dispersion of ferrite filled natural rubber composites become poorer with increasing <b>carbon</b> <b>black</b> loading. The thermal stability was found to enhance with <b>carbon</b> <b>black</b> loading. The swelling test indicated that the swelling percentage reduced with increasing <b>carbon</b> <b>black</b> loading while at low loading enhanced the magnetic properties of the composites.

40|$|Industrial {{exposure}} to <b>carbon</b> <b>black</b> {{has occurred in}} the <b>carbon</b> <b>black</b> production industry and in several user industries, including the rubber, paint and printing industries. The risks for cancer associated with these three exposure circumstances have been evaluated previously (IARC, 1982, 1989, 1996). The Working Group considered that the epidemiological evidence concerning the risk for cancer in user industries where there has been no attempt to identify which of the workers may have been exposed to <b>carbon</b> <b>black</b> carries little weight in the present evaluation. Consequently, in this monograph, attention was restricted to those studies that explicitly attempted to identify workers who had been exposed to <b>carbon</b> <b>black.</b> Studies based on <b>carbon</b> <b>black</b> production workers and some studies of workers in user industries satisfied this criterion. From {{the point of view of}} exposure patterns, the greatest potential for elucidating the carcinogenicity of <b>carbon</b> <b>black</b> would seem to be in the <b>carbon</b> <b>black</b> production industry. A further advantage of studies among producers is the fact that, in this industry, <b>carbon</b> <b>black</b> was the dominant exposure in the industrial environment, whereas workers in other industries were often exposed to complex mixtures of substances, of which <b>carbon</b> <b>black</b> may in some circumstances have been a relatively minor component. 2. 1 Industry-based studies Table 2. 1 summarizes industry-based studies including cohort analyses and nested case–control analyses of workers exposed to <b>carbon</b> <b>black.</b> 2. 1. 1 <b>Carbon</b> <b>black</b> production The occurrence of cancer among employees at <b>carbon</b> <b>black</b> production facilities in the USA has been followed for different periods since 1935 and was initially described i...|$|R

40|$|The {{electrical}} and mechanical behavior of <b>carbon</b> <b>black</b> filled poly(vinyl acetate) latex-based and solution-based polymer composites was examined. A set of experiments {{were performed to}} distinguish composites with a segregated network (emulsion-based) from those with random dispersion (solution-based) of the filler. The percolation thresholds for the emulsion-based composites were near 1. 2 vol% <b>carbon</b> <b>black,</b> while the solution-based composites were around 8. 2 vol% <b>carbon</b> <b>black.</b> This difference {{is due to the}} segregated network formation, which leads to excluded volume effects in emulsion-based systems. This excluded volume created by the solid polymer particles forces the <b>carbon</b> <b>black</b> particles into conductive pathways at low concentration. In the solution-based case, fully solvated polymer results in a random dispersion of <b>carbon</b> <b>black.</b> The segregated network composite also shows significant improvement in both electrical conductivity and storage modulus with low <b>carbon</b> <b>black</b> loading, while the solution-based composite achieves significant property enhancements at higher <b>carbon</b> <b>black</b> loading because of the greater percolation threshold. The effect of clay in both emulsion and solution-based composites with <b>carbon</b> <b>black</b> was also studied by preparing composites with three clay concentrations (0. 2, 0. 4 and 2 wt%). In emulsion-based composites, low clay concentration reduced the percolation threshold from 1. 2 vol% to 0. 8 vol% <b>carbon</b> <b>black,</b> but with solution-based composites clay increased the percolation threshold from 8. 2 vol% to 11. 7 vol% <b>carbon</b> <b>black.</b> It is assumed that clay helps to force the <b>carbon</b> <b>black</b> particles into the conductive pathways in the emulsion-based composites. In solution-base composites, clay improves the dispersion of <b>carbon</b> <b>black,</b> thereby destroying the <b>carbon</b> <b>black</b> network and reducing conductivity and storage modulus. The storage modulus in emulsion-based composites improved with 0. 2 wt% clay but greater clay concentration resulted in a drop in modulus due to porosity from excess excluded volume effects...|$|R

We wish to report {{a new type of}} composite of polypyrrole (ppy) and <b>carbon</b> <b>black</b> that is electrosynthesized from an aqueous medium containing pyrrole monomer and dispersed <b>carbon</b> <b>black.</b> The <b>carbon</b> <b>black</b> is assimilated into a growing ppy matrix in much the same manner as the formation of ppy-Pt "nanocomposites " that we described recently. 1 Composites of <b>carbon</b> <b>black</b> and other ma-terials, e. g., polymers, have a long history, especially in the rubber and plastics industry. 2 We are aware of only one other instance wherein an electronically conducting polymer such as ppy was cosynthesized with <b>carbon</b> <b>black.</b> 3 These authors presented prelim-inary results for a composite sample prepared from a nonaqueous medium (propylene carbonate § LiCIO 4) containing 0. 5 g/liter of <b>carbon</b> <b>black.</b> We present results below for a range of solution <b>carbon</b> <b>black</b> loading from 0. 5 to 50 g/liter and show that the resul-tant material has enhanced charge-storage capacity. More impor-tantly, the composite retains good electronic conductivity at nega-tive potentials wherein ppy is in the reduced (insulating) state.

40|$|<b>Carbon</b> <b>black,</b> {{used as a}} {{reinforcing}} filler for rubber materials, was evaluated for asphalt binders in pavements. <b>Carbon</b> <b>black</b> added to straight asphalt within 20 wt% caused {{an increase in the}} elastic modulus and a decrease in the viscosity of the asphalt, especially at temperatures higher than room temperature. Addition of <b>carbon</b> <b>black</b> raised the maximum service temperature of asphalt in the category of the binder performance grade according to the SHRP (Strategic Highway Research Program) specifications. On the other hand, addition of <b>carbon</b> <b>black</b> also increased the failure strain at low temperatures. Furthermore, addition of <b>carbon</b> <b>black</b> reduced the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) of asphalt to closer to that of aggregates. In asphalt mixtures, tensile stress occurs at the boundary between asphalt and aggregate with decreasing temperature due to the CTE difference. Addition of <b>carbon</b> <b>black</b> reduced this stress. <b>Carbon</b> <b>black</b> addition to asphalt has the potential to improve both deformation resistance in the high temperature region and crack resistance in the low temperature region, which were empirically considered to be contradictory. Therefore, <b>carbon</b> <b>black</b> is an effective filler for improving the durability of asphalt pavements. ゴム材料の補強用充填材として知られるカーボンブラックを取り上げ，舗装用アスファルトへの利用の可能性について検討を行った。 20 wt％（外割，pha = parts per hundred asphalt）までの範囲でカーボンブラックを添加したストレートアスファルトの性状を調べた。常温域から高温側において，カーボンブラックの添加はアスファルト単体の弾性率を増大させ粘性傾向を低下させた。これにより，SHRP（Strategic highway research program）規格のパフォーマンスグレードの分類上，供用可能な温度範囲が高温側に拡大することが確認された。一方，低温域ではカーボンブラックの添加は破壊時のひずみを大きくすることが判明した。さらに，カーボンブラック添加は，アスファルトの熱膨張係数を小さくし，骨材のそれに近づける効果も生み出した。アスファルト混合物では，温度の低下に伴いアスファルトと骨材の熱膨張係数の差に起因してその界面に応力が発生することが知られているが，カーボンブラックの添加はこの応力の軽減にも貢献することが期待される。アスファルトへのカーボンブラックの添加は，経験的に相反する性状とされている高温域における変形に対する抵抗性と低温域におけるひび割れに対する抵抗性を両立して改善できる可能性があり，アスファルト舗装の耐久性を向上する一つの有効な策と考えられる...|$|R
