50|$|CAD/CAM {{dentistry}} {{involves a}} digital impression {{from one or}} more scans (using visible light scanning, digital radiographs, CT scans, or other methods), designing the restoration on the computer (computer-aided design, leading to a 3D model), and manufacturing the restoration (computer-aided manufacturing, whether by CNC milling, 3D printing, or other means). In order to carry all of these steps out in the dentist’s office - chairside - the dentist requires an image acquisition unit with an intraoral camera, the corresponding designing software, and a milling machine or a printer. If the dentist {{does not have a}} <b>milling</b> <b>unit</b> in their office, they can send the data in a digital file to the dental laboratory via an online portal. The lab designs and manufactures the restorations according to the dentist's prescription and then sends the finished restorations back to the dentist’s office. Around 38,000 dentists worldwide use the CEREC method and thus produce some 6.9 million restorations each year (as of October 2013).|$|E
50|$|Ranney Hill {{is named}} after Winslow C. Ranney, a {{prospector}} and trapper who first came into the Yellowknife region in 1934. Numerous claims were staked in this area between 1935 and 1937 by Mr. Ranney. Development was undertaken by a small crew under Ranney’s supervision during 1937 and 1938, and apparently Ranney utilized a small <b>milling</b> <b>unit</b> to recover some gold from a short mine tunnel around 1939. Further exploration was conducted at this site during the 1940s by Ranney Gold Mines Limited, but no further mining development was undertaken. Ranney's now abandoned cabin, claim, and tunnel are between David Lake and Rater Lake — lakes seen in the first illustrative panorama below. In 1998, claims were staked {{in the area and}} some shallow x-ray diamond drilling was conducted on Ranney's main claim. The results of this work are unknown. Presently, the Ranney Hill area is a favored hiking destination and is well-marked by ribbons from the Vee Lake Road.|$|E

40|$|STATEMENT OF PROBLEM Milling is {{a central}} and {{important}} aspect of computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) technology. High milling accuracy reduces {{the time needed to}} adapt the workpiece and provides restorations with better longevity and esthetic appeal. The influence of different milling processes on the accuracy of milled restorations has not yet been reviewed. PURPOSE The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate the influence of different milling processes on the accuracy of ceramic restorations. MATERIAL AND METHODS Four groups of partial crowns were milled (each n= 17) : Three groups in a 4 -axial milling unit: (1) 1 -step mode and Step Bur 12 S (12 S), (2) 1 -step mode and Step Bur 12 (1 Step), (3) 2 -step mode and Step Bur 12 (2 Step), and (4) one group in a 5 -axial <b>milling</b> <b>unit</b> (5 axis). The milled occlusal and inner surfaces were scanned and superimposed over the digital data sets of calculated restorations with specialized difference analysis software. The trueness of each restoration and each group was measured. One-way ANOVA with a post hoc Tukey test was used to compare the data (α=. 05). RESULTS The highest trueness for the inner surface was achieved in group 5 axis (trueness, 41 ± 15 μm, P<. 05). The 4 -axial <b>milling</b> <b>unit</b> exhibited trueness at settings ranging from 61 μm (2 Step) to 96 μm (12 S). For the occlusal surface, the highest trueness was achieved with group 5 axis (trueness, 42 ± 10 μm). The 4 -axial <b>milling</b> <b>unit</b> exhibited trueness at settings ranging from 55 μm (1 Step) to 76 μm (12 S). CONCLUSIONS Restorations milled with a 5 -axial <b>milling</b> <b>unit</b> have a higher trueness than those milled with a 4 -axial <b>milling</b> <b>unit.</b> A rotary cutting instrument with a smaller diameter results in a more accurate milling process.

40|$|Background: Different CAD/CAM machinesâ {{generation}} may {{impact the}} restoration overall quality. The present study evaluated the marginal fit of CAD/CAM restorations manufactured with different generations of CEREC <b>milling</b> <b>unit</b> systems. Material and Methods: Sixteen typodont teeth {{were divided into}} two groups (n= 8) according to the machineâ s generation assigned. These are control group (G 1) : Cerec AC with Bluecam/Cerec 3 <b>milling</b> <b>unit</b> and (G 2) : Cerec AC with Bluecam/MC XL Premium Package <b>milling</b> <b>unit.</b> Scanning of the preparation were performed and crowns were milled using the Vita Mark II blocks. Blocks were cemented using epoxy glue on the pulpal floor only and finger pressure applied for 1 min. Upon completion of the cementation step, misfits between the restoration and abutment were measured by microphotography and the silicone replica technique using light body silicon material on Mesial (M) and Distal (D) surfaces. Results: Mean and SDs of marginal gaps in micrometers were: G 1 /M: 94. 90 (Â± 38. 52), G 1 /D: 88. 53 (Â± 44. 87), G 2 /M: 85. 65 (Â± 29. 89), G 2 /D: 95. 28 (Â± 28. 13). Two-way ANOVA indicated no significant differences among different groups (P> 0. 05); surface area (P> 0. 05) and the interaction (P> 0. 05). Overall, G 2 had greater margin gaps than G 1, however, without statistical difference (P> 0. 05). Conclusions: Difference in <b>milling</b> <b>unit</b> generation did not significantly affect the marginal fit.

40|$|A better {{understanding}} of the behaviour of prepared cane and bagasse, and the ability to model the mechanical behaviour of bagasse as it is squeezed in a <b>milling</b> <b>unit</b> to extract juice, would help identify how to improve the current process.

The reliability, availability and maintainability (RAM) of the primary mill, and hence the overall concentrator, is then determined by a combination of three different Markov models where each Markov model is used to evaluate and measure a separate set of reliability parameters. This approach effectively overcomes the computational complexity associated with large Markov models. The results of two case studies used to validate the methodology do indicate that the reliability, availability and maintainability profiles of large single stream Platinum concentrators could be fundamentally different from the conventional multiple stream primary mill configurations...|$|R
