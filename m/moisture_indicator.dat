40|$|Abstract: Predicting {{the spatial}} and {{temporal}} occurrence of rainfall triggered landslides represents an important scientific and operational issue due to the high threat that they pose to human life and property. This study investigates the relationship between rainfall, soil moisture conditions and landslide movement by using recorded movements of a rock slope located in central Italy, the Torgiovannetto landslide. This landslide {{is a very large}} rock slide, threatening county and state roads. Data acquired by a network of extensometers and a meteorological station clearly indicate that the movements of the unstable wedge, first detected in 2003, are still proceeding and the alternate phases of quiescence and reactivation are associated with rainfall patterns. By using a multiple linear regression approach, the opening of the tension cracks (as recorded by the extensometers) as a function of rainfall and soil moisture conditions prior the occurrence of rainfall, are predicted for the period 2007 – 2009. Specifically, soil <b>moisture</b> <b>indicators</b> are obtained through the Soil Water Index, SWI, a product derived by the Advanced SCATterometer (ASCAT) on board the MetOp (Meteorological Operational) satellite and by an Antecedent Precipitation Index, API.

As part of an exploratory study, three houses near Harrisburg, Pennsylvania have been intensively monitored over an 18 -month period for <b>moisture</b> <b>indicators,</b> radon levels, building operations, and other environmental parameters while ASD systems were cycled on and off. To implement this intensive monitoring program, novel protocols and study design were developed. A conceptual model suggested that the ASD systems can cause important changes in basement ventilation and interzonal air flows – therefore these parameters were periodically measured. Moisture levels were measured in walls and slab floors, indoor and outdoor air, surrounding soil, and wood framing members in the basement. The participating houses have unfinished basements: one having poured foundation walls, and the others having foundation walls of open and partially-filled concrete block. Results from these three houses indicate that ASD operation can produce significant moisture reductions in the basement air and walls, especially during non-summer months, and caused the predicted changes in air flow patterns.

The actual scenario of climate and land use changes, bring attention for the large-scale water productivity (WP) analyses. MODIS images were used together with gridded weather data for these analyses. A generalized sugarcane growing cycle inside a crop land mask, from September 2011 to October 2012, was considered in the main growing regions of the state. Actual evapotranspiration (ET) is quantified by the SAFER (Simple Algorithm for Evapotranspiration Retrieving) algorithm, the biomass production (BIO) by the RUE (Radiation Use Efficiency) Monteith?s model and WP is considered as the ratio of BIO to ET. During the four generalized sugarcane crop phases, the mean ET values ranged from 0. 6 to 4. 0 mm day- 1; BIO rates were between 20 and 200 kg ha- 1 day- 1, resulting in WP ranging from 2. 8 to 6. 0 kg m- 3.

40|$|Abstract Monitoring {{evapotranspiration}} {{and surface}} energy fluxes over {{a range of}} spatial and temporal scales is crucial for many agroenvironmental applications. Different remote sensing based energy balance models have been developed, to estimate evapotranspiration at both field and regional scales. In this contribution, METRIC (Mapping EvapoTranspiration at high Resolution with Internalized Calibration), has been applied for the estimation of actual evapotranspiration in the Ghriss plain in Mascara (western Algeria), a semiarid region with heterogeneous surface conditions. Four images acquired during 2001 and 2002 by the Landsat- 7 satellite were used. The METRIC model followed an energy balance approach, where evapotranspiration is estimated as the residual term when net radiation, sensible and soil heat fluxes are known. Different <b>moisture</b> <b>indicators</b> derived from the evapotranspiration were then calculated: reference evapotranspiration fraction, Priestley-Taylor parameter and surface resistance to evaporation. The evaluation of evapotranspiration and surface energy fluxes are accurate enough for the spatial variations of evapotranspiration rather satisfactory than sophisticated models without having to introduce an important number of parameters in input with difficult accessibility in routine. In conclusion, {{the results suggest that}} METRIC can be considered as an operational approach to predict actual evapotranspiration from agricultural areas having limited amount of ground information...|$|R

Housing density was the most important indicator of fire observations. Increasing minimum fire size increased the relative importance of biophysical variables. Key biophysical variables included land cover type, soil <b>moisture</b> <b>indicators,</b> and an index of presettlement fire rotation associated with glacial landforms.

Our {{intent was to}} develop a house-dust monitoring method to detect hidden moisture damage excluding the influence of outdoor air, accumulated old dust, and dust swirled up from room surfaces. Methods Based on standardized measurement of mould spores in the 63 -μm fraction of house dust yielded by carpets, the background concentrations were determined and compared to simultaneously obtained colony numbers and total spore numbers of the indoor air in 80 non-mouldy living areas during summer and winter periods. Additionally, sampling with a vacuum-cleaner or manual sieve was compared to sampling with a filter holder or sieving machine, and the evaluative power of an established two-step assessment model (lower and upper limits) was compared to that of a one-step model (one limit) in order to derive concentration limits for mould load in house dust. Results Comparison with existing evaluation procedures proved the developed method to be the most reliable means of evaluating hidden moisture damage, yielding the lowest false-positive results (specificity 98. 7 %). Background measurements and measurements in 14 mouldy rooms show that even by evaluating just the indicator genera in summer and winter, a relatively certain assessment of mould infestation is possible. Conclusion A one-step evaluation is finally possible for house dust. The house-dust evaluation method is based on analysis of the indicator genera Aspergillus, Eurotium and Penicillium spp., which depend on the total fungal count.

Thorough modern pollen studies are still lacking to understand the reliability and limitation of A/C ratio as a <b>moisture</b> <b>indicator,</b> however. Here we review how well this ratio can be applied in arid and semi-arid China on the basis of new surface pollen data, previous data synthesis and other publications. Results indicate that variance in the A/C ratio can permit identification of modern vegetation types and that the A/C ratio generally has a positive relationship with annual precipitation. However, soil salinity, vegetation community composition, human activity and sample provenance (e. g. soil and lake sediments) will affect the values of the A/C ratio in different vegetation zones and therefore the A/C ratio is not comparable in different regions. We argue that the A/C ratio can only be used to reconstruct vegetation types and climate change in regions with precipitation < 450 - 500 mm, and in steppe, steppe desert and desert areas. Careful studies should be undertaken to understand the modern pollen-vegetation-climate relationships in various regions before using the A/C ratio to interpret vegetation and climate...|$|E

40|$|The use of {{data from}} {{multiple}} sensors is often required to ensure data coverage and continuity, but differences in the spectral characteristics of sensors result in spectral index values being different. This study investigates spectral response function effects on 48 spectral indices for cultivated grasslands using simulated data of 10 very high spatial resolution sensors, convolved from field reflectance spectra of a grass covered dike (with varying vegetation condition). Index values for 48 indices were calculated for original narrow-band spectra and convolved data sets, and then compared.

40|$|Water is an {{important}} component of vegetation canopies and the timely monitoring of vegetation moisture status is very useful for agricultural drought assessment and forest fire prediction. Currently, the retrieval of vegetation water content (VWC) is mainly based on spectral indices. However, the different performances under varying conditions make the evaluation of spectral indices very necessary. In previous studies, the determination coefficient (R 2), mean square error (MSE) and root mean square error (RMSE) were widely used for the evaluation of spectral indices. However, using these constants as evaluation criteria, the performance of spectral indices was the same within a wide range and thus could not be precisely described. In this study, the sensitivity function was introduced to investigate the strength of the spectral indices to VWC estimation based on LOPEX (Leaf Optical Properties EXperiment) data set. Equivalent water thickness (EWT) and fuel moisture content (FMC), both FMC based on fresh weight (FMCw) and FMC based on dry weight (FMCd), were used to indicate vegetation moisture status. According to the results, the major conclusions are as follows: (1) the sensitivity of spectral indices to VWC is not a constant but a function of VWC; (2) for each VWC indicator, the spectral indices show varying performances at different moisture levels, which can provide reference for spectral index selection while monitoring the vegetation moisture status; and (3) besides, the sensitivity of the same spectral index to different vegetation <b>moisture</b> <b>indicators</b> is not the same and the comparative study indicates that spectral indices are much more sensitive to EWT than FMCw and FMC d. 2012 Taylor Francis...|$|R

Specifically, r is equal to 0. 40 when only rainfall is used as a predictor variable and increases to r = 0. 68 and r = 0. 85 if the API and the SWI are used respectively. Therefore, the coarse spatial resolution (25 km) of satellite data notwithstanding, the ASCAT SWI is found to be very useful for the prediction of landslide movements on a local scale.

The highest altitudes of the East Antarctic ice shield, where major ice cores have been drilled, have mean source latitudes of 45 – 40 °S year-round. This finding contrasts to results from previous Lagrangian studies which detected a more southerly moisture origin due to too short trajectories.

The study was conducted in 2015 – 2016. Three types of meadow communities were distinguished (alliances Molinion, Arrhenatherion, Filipendulion), due to the absence of the species characteristic for associations. The species richness noted per relevé differed significantly between the types of meadows (Kruskal–Wallis test: H = 21. 65, p < 0. 05). The highest floristic biodiversity (H' = 2. 99) was noted for the meadow patches classified as in the Molinion alliance and the lowest (H' = 2. 50) was found for the patches from the Filipendulion alliance. Mean values of the ecological indicators (F, R, N) differed between the meadow communities. The greatest disparity was noted for the mean values of the soil <b>moisture</b> <b>indicator</b> (from 6. 42 to 7. 45). Patches classified in the Filipendulion alliance were developed on the wettest soil substratum, whereas the patches classified in the Arrhenatherion alliance were predominant on a relatively dry substratum. The abandonment of traditional management practices (grazing, mowing) has contributed to transformation of the Molinia meadows, disappearance of characteristic species and succession of shrubs.

Salinity, along with other abiotic variables, constrains the distribution of coastal plants in predictable ways, with relatively few taxa adapted to the most saline conditions. However, few attempts have been made to quantify these relationships to create niche models for coastal plants. Quantification of the effects of salinity, and other abiotic variables, on coastal plants is essential to predict the responses of coastal ecosystems to external drivers such as sea level rise. We constructed niche models for 132 coastal plant taxa in Great Britain based on eight abiotic variables. Paired measurements of vegetation composition and abiotic variables are rare in coastal habitats so four of the variables were defined using community mean values for Ellenberg indicators, i. e. scores assigned according to the typical alkalinity, fertility, moisture availability and salinity of sites where a species occurs. The remaining variables were the canopy height, annual precipitation, and maximum and minimum temperatures. Salinity and <b>moisture</b> <b>indicator</b> scores were significant terms in over 80 % of models, suggesting the distributions of most coastal species are at least partly determined by these variables. When the models were used to predict species occurrence against an independent dataset 64 % of models gave moderate to good predictions of species occurrence.

Secondly, we used the resulting coefficients to predict climatic sensitivity for 688 plant species without spatially explicit distributional information. The models predicted range losses of 34 ± 20 % (mean±standard deviation) and range gains of 3 ± 4 %. Specifically, measures of species’ distribution, such as range size, were significantly related to both range loss and range gain. Other traits associated with range loss (e. g. life form, number of floristic zones) were not necessarily related to range gain (instead related to Ellenberg temperature indicator), indicating that two distinct sets of ecological processes govern range expansion and contraction. We found interaction effects between <b>moisture</b> <b>indicator</b> values and life form for range loss, and between moisture and temperature indicator values for range gain. The responses of species to climate change are complex and context dependent. Thus, our results highlight the importance of incorporating trait interactions in models to assess risks of climate change.    </p...|$|E

The work is carried out by means of GIS. The test site is located within the boundaries of the axial West Sayan district of mountain taiga forests, which ensures homogeneity of natural and climatic conditions. Stages of the method: creation of rasters on groups of absolute heights, exposures and inclinations with their subsequent combination into a single Combine raster; obtaining the regularities of spatial distribution of heat and moisture and their representation in the form of rasters (digital models); and interactive mapping of the Holocene forests with various combinations of heat and moisture. The use of Combine raster makes it possible to refuse to use any other contours as – landscape, geomorphological, forest inventory. To determine parameters of climatic boundaries of forest formations, the types of forests are linked to the heat and <b>moisture</b> <b>indicators.</b> As a result of linking, a graphic image is produced, where forest formations and their productivity are located in a certain order. The mapping technique involves creating a dBASE table with a field containing information about forest formations. The row-wise change in the records of forest formations as they move to other values of heat and moisture is performed interactively. Each next combination of heat and moisture on maps corresponds to a certain distribution of forest formations and site productivity (bonitet) classes.

This paper examines height growth of sessile oak (Quercus petraea) and hornbeam (Carpinus betulus) seedlings, as well as, spread of blackberry (Rubus fruticosus) in circular gaps of various sizes. Material and Methods: Three gaps of 15 m (G 15), three gaps of 30 m (G 30) and two gaps of 45 m (G 45) in diameter were cut in a sessile oak-hornbeam forest. Height of sessile oak and hornbeam seedlings, as well as, cover of soil <b>moisture</b> <b>indicator</b> plants and that of blackberry were monitored until the fourth year of the regeneration. Results and Conclusion: ISessile oak grew faster in G 30 than in G 15, but the two larger gap types did not differ in this aspect. Intensity of hornbeam seedling development increased with gap size. Proliferation rate of blackberry was the highest in G 45. Within the gaps, both sessile oak and hornbeam were the tallest in the centres. In the northern parts, competition ability of hornbeam decreased relatively to that of sessile oak. For spread of blackberry, the west locations were the most optimal. Development of both of sessile oak and hornbeam seedlings was related to soil moisture as indicated by the herb layer. It was concluded that regeneration of sessile oak could be made more secure if starting it with cutting small gaps (e. g. 0. 5 tree height) and if these gaps are enlarged then gradually...|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} work {{the results of}} a three-year {{ecological}} study carried out in 11 forest sites of the CP Estate, are discussed. Three different data set, ecological-floristic, edaphic and microclimatic, have been collected through phytosiological relèves, soil profiles and microclimatic measurements. The Ellenberg model (1974) has been applied to the floristic matrix to obtain for each community indicator values for light, temperature, continentality, soil moisture, soil reaction and soil nutrients. A statistical treatment of data showed several significant correlations between ecological indicators of species and communities and variables of soil and microclimate measured in the field. In particular, a strong relationship between soil <b>moisture</b> <b>indicator</b> value and Available Water Capacity measured in the soils (AWC) has been found. Microclimatic data focus on a remarkable heterogeneity of the Castelporziano woodlands, showing different seasonal trends as well as different critical periods during the year. In particular, different associations can be ordered according to a gradient of a few correlated parameters: temperature, yearly thermic excursion, air moisture. The seasonal trend of different microclimatic parameters varies along this gradient, and it seems that not average values but seasonal variaton is the key factor in structuring vegetation. Microclimatic parameters are also correlated with chemical soil parameters: for instance, high soil temperature correlated with high soil water capacity increases microbial activity and consequently influences the cycles of nitrogen, carbon and phosphorus. The whole of the correlations suggests the strenght of the interactions existing between plant communities and environmental measured variables, indicating a rather coherence of the ecological processes in the forest habitat of the CP Estate...|$|E
40|$|Widespread {{outbreaks}} {{of the mountain}} pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins) in the lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Dougl. ex Loud. var. latifolia Engelm.) forests of North America have produced stands with significant levels of recent tree mortality. The needle foliage from recently attacked trees typically turns red within {{one to two years}} of attack indicating successful colonization by the beetle and tree death. Attempts to model crown fire potential in these stands have assumed that the moisture content of dead foliage responds similarly to changes in air temperature and relative humidity as other fine, dead surface fuels. However, this assumption has not been verified. In this exploratory study we sampled the moisture content of dead foliage on an hourly basis through two different diurnal cycles during the fire season and compared the results to measurements of 10 -h fuel <b>moisture</b> <b>indicator</b> sticks and predictions made from models used to estimate dead fuel moisture in the USA, Canada, and Australia. The observed degree of variation in dead foliar moisture content was small (6. 9 – 14. 5 %) with a mean value of ∼ 10 %. All existing models performed poorly, but measurements of 10 -h fuel moisture and a modified version of an existing model where timelags were extended to ∼ 20 -h had the best fit to the data. The results from our study suggest that the dead foliage on attacked trees does not respond similarly to changing environmental conditions as other fine, dead surface fuels as has been assumed. This in turn has important implications for wildland fire suppression operations, including firefighter safety, and in modeling fire behavior, and solicits the need for further research...|$|E
40|$|Under the {{guidance}} of Strategic Highway Research Program, an Environmental Conditioning System (ECS) was developed. The system simulates traffic loads by application of repeated loads during conditioning and uses resilient modulus as a <b>moisture</b> sensitivity <b>indicator.</b> However, the test setup was not recommended by Strategic Highway Research Program due to poor repeatability. ^ At the time of ECS development and modifications, state highway agencies (SHAs) typically used resilient modulus test results to estimate performance. However, NCHRP 9 - 19 researchers have proposed new tests, commonly known as “Simple Performance Tests (SPT),” to evaluate performance of AC mixes. These tests include dynamic modulus to predict permanent deformation and fatigue cracking, axial repeated (flow number) test to predict permanent deformation, and axial creep (flow time) test to predict permanent deformation. Since SPT {{is expected to be}} utilized by the SHAs in the near future, the objective of this research was to determine the potential of the most suitable simple performance tests integration with ECS for predicting moisture sensitivity.

40|$|A {{review of}} grain quality {{indicators}} and measurement methods {{was conducted in}} order to assess the feasibility of using remote sensing technology to develop a continuous monitoring system for use during grain transfer operations. Most detection methods were found to be too slow or too expensive to be incorporated into the normal inspection procedure of a grain elevator on a continuous basis. Two <b>indicators,</b> <b>moisture</b> content and broken corn and foreign material, show potential for automation and are of an economic value. A microprocessor based system which utilizes commercially available electronic moisture meter was developed and tested. A method for automating BCFM measurement is described.

40|$|Aim of study: This paper {{reviews the}} global {{research}} {{during the last}} 6 years (2007 - 2012) on the state, trends and potential of remote sensing for detecting, mapping and monitoring forest defoliation caused by insects. Area of study: The review covers research carried out within different countries in Europe and America. Main results: A nation or region wide monitoring system should be scaled in two levels, one using time-series with moderate to coarse resolutions, {{and the other with}} fine or high resolution. Thus, MODIS data is increasingly used for early warning detection, whereas Landsat data is predominant in defoliation damage research. Furthermore, ALS data currently stands as the more promising option for operative detection of defoliation. Vegetation indices based on infrared-medium/near-infrared ratios and on <b>moisture</b> content <b>indicators</b> are of great potential for mapping insect pest defoliation, although NDVI is the most widely used and tested. Research highlights: Among most promising methods for insect defoliation monitoring are Spectral Mixture Analysis, best suited for detection due to its sub-pixel recognition enhancing multispectral data, and use of logistic models as function of vegetation index change between two dates, recommended for predicting defoliation. Key words: vegetation damage; pest outbreak; spectral change detection. </p...|$|R
