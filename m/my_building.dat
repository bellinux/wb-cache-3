At the time, the back of <b>my</b> <b>building</b> was not enclosed so anyone could have driven in the back alley to observe my balcony. In addition, my balcony and the back of the apartment complex faced onto a courtyard or back area that was shared with a number of other apartment or office buildings in the area.

He moved into <b>my</b> <b>building</b> at Union Square in New York with his son Nikita. I saw him every day, worked with him and watched over his deteriorating health. He drank too much and ate little food. Brodovitch came to virtually every Design Laboratory workshop session and invited many of the famous {{in the fields of}} design and photography. I recorded him and his well known visitors talking during those many sessions. These recordings are now available to hear at R.I.T. library in Rhode Island. His mind remained sharp and true to his beliefs during those last years in New York City. It was the greatest privilege to do this for him and to learn from him. He loved New York and I had to make him leave to go to his brother in France, as he was wasting away. There will never be another Brodovitch." ...|$|E

My {{confession}} was too exciting {{to be kept}} a secret, and soon several of mother's most intimate friends had heard of my expedition, and in their minds, as in hers, my early marriage was assured.

60|$|In {{order to}} be at hand when I might need him, Walkirk took up his {{residence}} at the village tavern, or, as {{some of us were}} pleased to call it, the inn. To make him available when occasion should require, I took him with me to the scene of <b>my</b> <b>building</b> operations and to my grandmother's farm, and he there showed the same intelligent interest that he gave to my evening recitals. I had no difficulty in finding occupation for my under-study, and, so far as I could judge, he attended to the business I placed in his hands as well as I could have done it myself; indeed, in some instances, he did it better, for he gave it more time and careful consideration.|$|E

I promised to join him there, {{and at the same time}} that he set out on his errand, I hurried to a shop in the village, the owner of which combined the occupations of cabinet maker and undertaker, and who generally kept on hand a small stock of cheap furniture. From this I selected such articles as I thought would be suitable or useful in a small house, which at present contained nothing too good for a bonfire, and ordered them sent immediately to the Frenchman's cottage.|$|E

5000|$|The {{building}} design received accolades in the architectural press, resulting in swarms of uninvited visitors trespassing {{on the property}} to glimpse this latest <b>Mies</b> <b>building.</b> But {{as a result of}} the accusations contained in Edith Farnsworth's lawsuit, the house became a prop in the larger national social conflicts of the McCarthy era. The weekend house became a lightning rod for anti-modernist publications, exemplified in the April 1953 issue of House Beautiful, which attacked it as a communist-inspired effort to supplant traditional American styles.|$|R

60|$|Such {{impression}} {{did this}} make upon me, {{that after the}} storm was over I laid aside all my works, <b>my</b> <b>building</b> and fortifying, and applied myself to make bags and boxes, to separate the powder, and {{to keep it a}} little and a little in a parcel, in the hope that, whatever might come, it might not all take fire at once; and to keep it so apart that it should not be possible to make one part fire another. I finished this work in about a fortnight; and I think my powder, which in all was about two hundred and forty pounds weight, was divided in not less than a hundred parcels. As to the barrel that had been wet, I did not apprehend any danger from that; so I placed it in my new cave, which, in my fancy, I called my kitchen; and the rest I hid up and down in holes among the rocks, so that no wet might come to it, marking very carefully where I laid it.|$|E
6000|$|Next {{morning it}} was all in the newspapers, in the minutest detail. It even had additions--consisting of Detective This, Detective That, and Detective The Other's [...] "Theory" [...] as to how the robbery was done, who the robbers were, and whither they had flown with their booty. There were eleven of these theories, and they covered all the possibilities; and this single fact shows what {{independent}} thinkers detectives are. No two theories were alike, or even much resembled each other, save in one striking particular, and in that one all the other eleven theories were absolutely agreed. That was, that although the rear of <b>my</b> <b>building</b> was torn out and the only door remained locked, the elephant had not been removed through the rent, but by some other (undiscovered) outlet. All agreed that the robbers had made that rent only to mislead the detectives. That never would have occurred to me or to any other layman, perhaps, but it had not deceived the detectives for a moment. Thus, what I had supposed {{was the only thing that}} had no mystery about it was in fact the very thing I had gone furthest astray in. The eleven theories all named the supposed robbers, but no two named the same robbers; the total number of suspected persons was thirty-seven. The various newspaper accounts all closed with the most important opinion of all--that of Chief Inspector Blunt. A portion of this statement read as follows: ...|$|E

His Mechanical Engineering Research building on the Illinois Institute of Technology campus featured an exposed concrete frame, but it was infilled with brick spandrel walls and windows and was not constructed in accordance with Mies' design. However, the building design is clearly a precursor to the Promontory Apartments.|$|R

40|$|This project {{emerged from}} an {{awareness}} of a need in Paris for architecture that caters for children of the community, rather than for tourism needs. The program seeks to create a safe and fun environment for these children to interact and engage with {{each other as they}} discover, create or play, forming important social skills at a young age. Simultaneously, {{it is a place where}} parents can gather on a regular basis and take part in their children’s learning. The site I was allocated allowed me immense freedom in the arrangement of <b>my</b> <b>buildings</b> and in <b>building</b> <b>my</b> concept. Having been given a site with an open courtyard, I chose to take advantage of this as an outdoor playground space. A separate building for services (reception and food court) and activities and play (craft areas, mini-sports) placed opposite each other allowed me to claim this area. In order to retain the connection to nature, my design features extensive use of glass, allowing observers to look on from inside out, outside in. The beehive structure that encloses <b>my</b> two <b>buildings</b> features an arrangement of transparent, semi-transparent and opaque material that casts a patterned shadow corresponding to the functions of the spaces below. Resting spaces are sheltered; play spaces are well lit. The design also features various interactive spaces – pods, hives and other areas – that children will enjoy. The intriguing structure of this design subverts the uniformity of the context in which it has been placed, and makes a statement about its function. The symbol of the beehive conveys the social interaction and team work involved in creating it, and this is an important part in the development of a child’s maturity.
