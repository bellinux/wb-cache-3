5|$|Bennett was {{selected}} by the New York Giants in the fourth round of the 1999 National Football League Draft. As a rookie in 1999, Bennett missed seven games due to a knee injury. After undergoing surgery on the knee, he <b>missed</b> <b>all</b> of the 2000 season. In 2001, New York expected Bennett to work in tandem with Tiki Barber but after suffering a hamstring injury, he was released on September 3, 2001. After multiple injuries to their running backs, the Giants became interested in re-signing Bennett but because of NFL rules {{they were unable to}} do so until January 2002. During this time period, he was offered contracts by the Philadelphia Eagles and Miami Dolphins but rejected both hoping to return to the Giants. He re-signed with the Giants on January 16, 2002. During the season, Bennett was returned to the wide receiver position he played in high school, due to multiple injuries suffered by the Giants players in that position. He was waived on December 4, 2002.|$|E
5|$|In the 1990s, primary {{education}} reform {{had become one}} of the top priorities in the People's Republic of China. About 160million Chinese people had <b>missed</b> <b>all</b> or part of their education because of the Cultural Revolution in the late 1960s and early 1970s, and in 1986 the National People's Congress enacted a law calling for nine years of compulsory education. By 1993, it was clear that much of the country was making little progress on implementing nine-year compulsory education, so the 1993–2000seven-year plan focused on this goal. One of the major challenges educators faced was the large number of rural schoolchildren dropping out to pursue work. Another issue was a large urban–rural divide: funding and teacher quality were far better in urban schools than rural, and urban students stayed in school longer.|$|E
5|$|During the 2012–13 season Walker {{appeared}} in twenty games with HC Vítkovice and recorded one assist; he was loaned to Hokej Šumperk 2003 for three games, {{where he also}} had one assist. After {{six years in the}} Czech Republic, Walker signed a contract on 8 January 2013 with the Youngstown Phantoms of the United States Hockey League, a junior ice hockey league in the United States. He made his debut for the team on 11 January against the Chicago Steel, recording a goal. After four games with the Phantoms, in which he recorded six points, Walker was named to the USHL/NHL Top Prospects Game on 23 January 2013; he replaced his teammate, who was ill. Walker played 29 games for the Phantoms during the regular season and recorded 27 points (7 goals, 20 assists). His 20 assists were good enough for fifth on the team, even though Walker only joined the team midway through the season. His season ended early due to an injury suffered in a game on 5 April where Walker broke a bone in his neck {{as a result of a}} hit from behind; as a result he <b>missed</b> <b>all</b> the Phantoms playoff games.|$|E

Fordham last won a conference game on January 28, 2009, but Temple Owls had a 27–22 {{deficit in the}} first half. However, a {{balanced}} offensive attack, led by Juan Fernandez and Ramone Moore's 15 points each, helped Temple Owls to take the lead. Michael Eric scored his first collegiate double-double with 14 points and 11 rebounds, and Lavoy Allen was the fourth starter to score in double figures, with 12 points. On January 6, starting point guard Juan Fernandez bruised his knee in practice and missed the January 9 game against Saint Louis. Despite shooting 30.6 percent from the field, the Owls won 57–53 behind Ramone Moore's 15 points. Temple Owls was behind 41–32 with 10:13 remaining, then went on an 11–2 run. Moore scored five consecutive points to break a tie at 49, giving the Owls a lead. The Billikens <b>missed</b> <b>all</b> seven three-point shots against the Temple Owls defense. Fernandez also missed the January 12 game against St. Bonaventure, but the Owls defeated the Bonnies nonetheless, 83–55. Ramone Moore led all five starters in double-digit scoring with 19 points. The team shot 30 of 59 {{from the field and}} 9 for 21 from three-point land.|$|E

Destroyers were instructed to close the enemy fleet to fire torpedoes as soon as engagements between the main ships on either side would keep enemy guns busy directed at larger targets. Destroyers should also be ready to immediately engage enemy destroyers if they should launch an attack, endeavouring to disrupt their chances of launching torpedoes and keep {{them away from the}} main fleet.|$|E
