5|$|Six Flags designers' {{decorative}} theme {{attempts to}} capture the spirit of Batman's world for those queuing to board the ride. As the queue moves through Gotham City Park, the theme becomes <b>more</b> <b>ominous.</b> Modeled after Anton Furst's award-winning set design for the original Batman film, the atmosphere indicates a crime-ridden and dirty environment, with wrecked cars, discarded pieces of equipment, crumbling concrete, and a Gotham City Police car riddled with bullet holes. The queue then enters the ride structure. The ride passenger loading area is modeled on Batman's Batcave, and features {{a replica of the}} Batsuit from the 1989 film.|$|E
5|$|The soundtrack for {{the game}} is an {{original}} score composed by Alex Guilbert. The theme for Saw, a series of plunking piano keys joined by a bass drum and violins, can be heard during the menu screen and the end credits. At some points during the game, a quick tempo score similar to the opening piano track is used to increase suspense during trap and puzzle sequences. A high-pitched tune can be heard during slower parts of the game, which was used to make these parts <b>more</b> <b>ominous.</b> Variations or mixes of these tracks occur throughout the game. The game utilizes a minimalist approach to music, {{with most of the}} ambient sound being provided by other victims, screaming or taunting protagonist David Tapp. Because the tracks were meant for a video game, there are no vocals; the tracks are much shorter than typical songs and are more abundant.|$|E
5|$|The war {{came to a}} {{disastrous}} end in 1828, as Brazil relinquished Cisplatina, which became the independent nation of Uruguay. Nonetheless, Luís Alves was promoted {{to the rank of}} major on 2 December 1828 and made second-in-command of the Emperor's Battalion in early 1829. During his stay in Montevideo, he met María Ángela Furriol González Luna. How far their relationship progressed is unknown, but {{there may have been a}} failed engagement. He returned to Rio de Janeiro and witnessed the increasing deterioration in Emperor PedroI's political position. A growing opposition to PedroI's policies eventually erupted into mass protests at the Field of Santana in downtown Rio de Janeiro on 6 April 1831. The situation became <b>more</b> <b>ominous</b> when several military units, led by Luís Alves' father and uncles, joined the protests.|$|E

25|$|After this victory, {{expectations}} for the county were high, with many pundits predicting that Donegal would win the Ulster Championship. Donegal beat Antrim 1–10 to 0–07 in the preliminary round. This was the team's first Championship win since 2007. This set up an away match against Cavan from which Donegal once again emerged victorious, by a scoreline of 2–14 to 1–08. A <b>more</b> <b>ominous</b> test against Tyrone would follow this Cavan victory. The new defensive system developed by Jim McGuinness would {{be put to the}} test against a Tyrone team which perfected the blanket defense tactic on the way to three All Ireland victories in the 2000s.

He presides over Rigby's funeral and acknowledges that despite his efforts, [...] "no one was saved". The first McCartney composition to depart from the themes of a standard love song, its lyrics were the product of a group effort, with Harrison, Starr and Lennon all contributing. While Lennon and Harrison supplied harmonies beside McCartney's lead vocal, no Beatle played on the recording; instead, Martin arranged the track for a string octet, drawing inspiration from Bernard Herrmann's 1960 film score for Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho.

50|$|To {{succeed in}} {{the aim of the}} game dexterity was required, and unusual ability in the game was rated as high as {{corresponding}} excellence in throwing the javelin. Not only was the kottabos the ordinary accompaniment of the festal assembly, but, at least in Sicily, a special building of a circular form was sometimes erected so that the players might be easily arranged round the basin, and follow each other in rapid succession. Like all games in which the element of chance found a place, it was regarded as <b>more</b> or less <b>ominous</b> of the future success of the players, especially in matters of love - and the excitement was sometimes further augmented by some object of value being staked on the event.|$|R

500|$|In April 1859, sledge parties set {{out from}} Fox to search on King William Island. On 5 May, the party led by Royal Navy Lieutenant William Hobson found a {{document}} in a cairn left by Crozier and Fitzjames. It contained two messages. The first, dated 28 May 1847, said that Erebus and Terror had wintered in the ice off the northwest coast of King William Island and had wintered earlier at Beechey Island after circumnavigating Cornwallis Island. [...] "Sir John Franklin commanding the Expedition. All well," [...] the message said. The second message, written {{in the margins of}} that same sheet of paper, was much <b>more</b> <b>ominous.</b> Dated 25 April 1848, it reported that Erebus and Terror had been trapped in the ice {{for a year and a}} half and that the crew had abandoned the ships on 22 April. Twenty-fourofficers and crew had died, including Franklin on 11 June 1847, just two weeks after the date of the first note. Crozier was commanding the expedition, and the 105survivors planned to start out the next day, heading south towards the Back River.

Rebecca Haithcoat of the Pitchfork stated [...] "Nightride sounds fascinating and, while polished, less sleek and cold than the title suggests. It has <b>more</b> of an <b>ominous,</b> broken-down carnival vibe" [...] and that [...] "Tinashe has long preferred shadows and slinkiness to bright poppiness, and Nightride is strictly after-hours music. ... the album is infinitely interesting, possibly {{more so than the}} artist singing it.

[...] Kitty Empire of The Observer gave a more mixed but still positive review; describing the tracks from Nightride as a series of 'hazy, gauzy tracks'.|$|R
40|$|Current {{physiologic}} {{monitoring alarm}} systems are weak because they exhibit a high false positive rate and true positive alarms {{that are often}} clinically irrelevant.

Without a commercially viable solution, the solution might as well not exist. The objective of this research is to identify a process that tailors the current alarm system of a physiologic monitor {{in such a way as}} to <b>more</b> accurately identify <b>ominous</b> problems with a patient. The modification of the alarm system will be limited to defining a more appropriate set of alarm thresholds for existing physiologic variables.

40|$|Background To {{evaluate}} {{the role of}} admission cardiotocography in intrapartum patients in detecting fetal hypoxia already present and to correlate the results of admission cardiotocography with perinatal outcome. Materials and Methods: It was a cross-sectional study conducted in the Labor and Maternity ward during the period 2007 - 2009. The study included 176 pregnant women (both high risk and low risk), admitted to the emergency department or through the outpatient department with period of gestation ≥ 36 weeks, in first stage of labor with fetus in cephalic presentation. All of them were subjected to an admission test, a 20 min recording of fetal heart rate and uterine contractions on cardiotocograph machine {{at the time of}} admission. Results: The results of the admission test were ′reactive′ in 82. 38 %, ′equivocal′ in 10. 22 %, and ′ominous′ in 7. 38 % women. Women with the reactive admission test had low risk of intrapartum fetal distress (6. 9 %) as compared to 39. 9 % in the equivocal and 84. 6 % in the ominous group (P< 0. 001). Incidence of moderate to thick meconium stained liqor were <b>more</b> in <b>ominous</b> (61. 5 %) and equivocal group (33. 3 %) in compared to reactive group (4. 8 %) (P< 0. 001). Incidence of NICU admission was also significantly high (62 %) in babies delivered from mother with ominous test group compared to those with equivocal (28 %) and reactive test (3. 45 %) group babies. Neonatal mortality was also seen in babies born to mothers with equivocal (5. 5 %) and ominous (7. 6 %) admission test groups. Operative delivery for fetal distress was required in only 5. 5 % (8 of 145) woman of the reactive group, in 27. 8 % (5 of 18) woman of the equivocal group and in 84. 6 % (11 of 13) women of the ominous group. Conclusion: The admission cardiotocography is a simple non-invasive test that can serve as screening tool to detect fetal distress already present or likely to develop and prevent unnecessary delay in intervention. The test has high specificity and can help in ′triaging′ fetuses in obstetric wards of developing countries with a heavy workload and limited resources...|$|R

Traditional treatment methods wasted too much time and cost. professional inpatient clinics are not adequate for admission of all care seekers. Rapid detoxification methods are supposed to be better alternatives. Materials and Methods: 140 male drug abusers in two matched groups were assessed from March to September, 2005. They used heroin or opium. Both groups were scheduled for detoxification and were closely observed for 3 months thereafter. First group received Clonidine, Benzodiazepine and Naltrexone besides symptom relieving modalities in first 4 days of treatment. Naltrexone was continued in maintenance dose for one month. Second group received Methadone for one month. Results: Clients age was between 18 to 73 years, with mean age 34 years old. Their intelligence quotients were above the lower limit of normal range. There was no significant difference according to these parameters between two groups. Success rate in rapid detoxification group was 55 % and in Methadone group was 50 %. Relapse in rapid detoxification method occurred less frequent and slower (45 % vs. 50 %). In Naltrexone group, better success rate was due to less duration of drug abuse and heroin dependency. In Methadone group, therapy had better results in patients with longer drug abuse history and opium addiction. There {{was no significant difference between}} success rate and either drug kind or job, marital status or education level.
