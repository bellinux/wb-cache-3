40|$|<b>Plant</b> <b>fibres</b> have {{a unique}} set of {{properties}} ranging from being stiff and brittle, such as hemp and flax, to more ductile, such as coir, c ombining these properties with their cost and availability makes them attractive alternative reinforcements for the production of greener composites. This article reviews the tensile properties of various <b>plant</b> <b>fibre</b> or <b>plant</b> based natural <b>fibre</b> - reinforced polymer s reported in the literature. We critically discuss the use of <b>plant</b> <b>fibres</b> as reinforcement for the production of bio - based, renewable or green polymer composites, showing t he evolution of the properties of <b>plant</b> <b>fibre</b> composites. The reported tensile properties of <b>plant</b> <b>fibre</b> - reinforced polymer composites are compared against various renewable and n on - renewable engineering/commodity polymers as well as the tensile properties of commercially available randomly oriented glass fibre - reinforced polymers (GFRP). G reen composites containing random short <b>plant</b> <b>fibres</b> do have similar properties to randomly oriented GFRP at a lower overall part weight. U nidirectional <b>plant</b> <b>fibre</b> - reinf orced polymers offer better performance than randomly oriented GFRP and could have the potential to be adapted in applications requiring even higher mechanical performance, especially in areas where the use of costly synthetic fibres might be less attracti ve. Furthermore, <b>plant</b> <b>fibres</b> can also be regarded as effective fillers to replace more expensive polymer s and improve the green credential s of final composite parts.

50|$|The {{origin of}} the rebozo is not known, but {{probably}} had its beginnings {{in the very early}} colonial period. The first mention and description of the garment in written records is in 1572 by Friar Diego Duran, according to research done by Ruth D. Lechuga. The rebozo itself shows various influences, which probably come from the various cultures that had contact at that time. There are various indigenous garments that share physical characteristics with the rebozo. They include the ayate, a rough cloth of <b>maguey</b> <b>fibre</b> used to carry cargo, the mamatl, which is a cotton cloth also used to carry objects and which often had a decorative border, and the tilma (used for carrying and as a garment), a cloth best known from the one Juan Diego wore and which bears the image of the Virgin of Guadalupe. There are chronicles that say that La Malinche carried a cloth called a “Manta del sol” (sun cloth) which was not just used to protect from the sun but also to denote status as decoration. However, pre Hispanic clothing and other cloths did not have woven fringes. The main European influence is most likely the Spanish mantilla, although a southern Spanish garment called a rebociño (introduced to the area by the Moors) may have also played a part. Later influences probably came from Asia with the start of trade from the Manila Galleon.|$|R
40|$|With {{increased}} {{understanding of}} the complex roles nutrients play within metabolic pathways, {{the purpose of this}} contribution is to explore the rationale for expanding the definitions and criteria for nutrient essentiality. A further objective was to develop three case study scenarios to probe issues surrounding the definition of essentiality using dietary <b>fibre,</b> <b>plant</b> sterols and polyphenols. Current definitions and criteria for 2 ̆ 2 essentiality 2 ̆ 2 were reviewed through an environmental scan of the scientific literature. Additionally, international regulatory bodies were asked whether the terms 2 ̆ 2 nutrient 2 ̆ 2 and/or 2 ̆ 2 essential nutrient 2 ̆ 2 are regulated in their respective jurisdictions. Regulatory bodies including the EFSA, the US FDA, HC and FSANZ were found not to currently possess regulated definitions for the term 2 ̆ 2 essential nutrient 2 ̆ 2. Case studies examining <b>fibre,</b> <b>plant</b> sterols and polyphenols served as a means of presenting evidence for expanding the list of functional food constituents regarded as meeting criteria for essentiality. For each example, certain instances applied where these case study bioactives met criteria of essentiality. Thus, in order to reflect advances in current science, a series of non-classical compounds known to have bioactivity should be considered for their potential essentiality under certain situations...|$|R

40|$|Optical access {{networks}} provide a future proof platform {{for a wide}} range of services, and today, several operators are deploying fibre to the home (FTTH) networks. Installing an FTTH infrastructure, however, involves very high investment cost. Therefore, a good estimation of the investment cost is important for building a successful business strategy and, consequently, to speed up the FTTH penetration. In this paper, for calculating the amount of cable and fibre in the outside plant together with the associated civil works, and the number of required network elements, two different approaches are investigated: (1) geometric modelling of the <b>fibre</b> <b>plant</b> based on approximate mathematical models and (2) geographic modelling of the <b>fibre</b> <b>plant</b> based on map-based geospatial data. The results obtained from these two approaches can then be used as input for preliminary investment cost calculations and/or techno-economic evaluations. Compared to more complex and accurate geographic modelling, we verify that especially with uneven population density and irregular street system, simple geometric models do not provide accurate results. However, if no geospatial data is available or a fast calculation is desired for a first estimation, geometric models definitely have their relevance. Based on the case studies presented in this paper, we propose some important guidelines to improve the accuracy of the geometric models by eliminating their main distortion factors...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} and evaluate NGA architectures which meet {{the foreseeable future}} bandwidth demand and allow for highest bandwidth and quality for end-users and which no longer rely on copper cable elements. These are FTTH architectures only. From all available FTTH architectures we concentrate on the two most relevant architectures in Europe, Ethernet Point-to-Point and GPON. We assume the incumbent to be the investor in the NGA network infrastructure. If the NGA architecture {{is based on a}} Point-to-Point <b>fibre</b> <b>plant</b> we have modelled the competitors as using unbundled fibre loops as the wholesale access service. If the architecture is based on a Point-to-Multipoint <b>fibre</b> <b>plant,</b> we consider an active wholesale access (bitstream access) at the MPoP or at the core network node locations. Our basic modelling relies upon an engineering bottom-up cost modelling approach. We model the total cost of the services considered under efficient conditions, taking into account the cost of all network elements needed to produce these services in the specific architecture deployed. This approach is coherent with a Long Run Incremental Cost approach as applied in regulatory economics. Our modelling approach generates a broad set of results including the relative performance of the various network architectures, investment requirements and the degree of profitable coverage. In this paper, however, we focus on the results on the potential for competition and potential market structures in an NGA environment.
