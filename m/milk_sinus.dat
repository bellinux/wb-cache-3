40|$|Mammary {{secretion}} (1 =. =n-=. ml) {{was collected}} from the <b>milk</b> <b>sinus</b> of each mammary gland (quarter) of two pregnant heifers and eight pregnant cows (dry period 49 =n- 29 days), first at weekly intervals from 40 days before parturition, then with increasing frequency as parturition approached. The progressive changes in the concentration of lactose, glucose, casein, non=req- casein protein and fat in the mammary secretion were determined. Calves were separated from the cows immediately after birth and the yield and composition of milk from individual quarters were determined for 5 days after parturition. Two quarters (milked quarters) of each of a further five cows were milked throughout pregnancy, while the other two quarters(unmilked quarters) of each cow were allowed to involute (dry off) 63 =n- 104 days before parturition. Small samples (5 =n- 0 ml) of secretion were {{collected from the}} unmilked quarters, first at weekly intervals after drying off and then every second day from 10 to 15 days before parturition. On the days that the unmilked quarters were sampled, corresponding composite milk samples were collected from the milked quarters and the progressiv...|$|E
