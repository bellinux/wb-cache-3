5|$|In {{addition}} to the operas, recordings have been issued of several orchestral works, including the ballet Le carillon, the piano concerto in E, the Fantaisie for cello and orchestra, and orchestral suites. Many individual mélodies by Massenet were included in mixed recitals on record during the 20th century, and <b>more</b> <b>have</b> been committed to disc since then, including, for the first time, a CD in 2012, exclusively devoted to his songs for soprano and piano.|$|E
5|$|Many {{objective}} measures {{show the}} positive impact of Hubble data on astronomy. Over 9,000 papers based on Hubble data {{have been published}} in peer-reviewed journals, and countless <b>more</b> <b>have</b> appeared in conference proceedings. Looking at papers several years after their publication, about one-third of all astronomy papers have no citations, while only 2% of papers based on Hubble data have no citations. On average, a paper based on Hubble data receives about twice as many citations as papers based on non-Hubble data. Of the 200 papers published each year that receive the most citations, about 10% are based on Hubble data.|$|E
5|$|The Islanders {{have won}} the Stanley Cup four {{consecutive}} times (1980, 1981, 1982, and 1983), {{with a total of}} 34 players playing for the team throughout those four seasons.

5|$|According to Cockerell, {{the side}} of the façade that is to the south of the central door is the more sacred and the scheme is divided accordingly. The lowest range of niches each {{contained}} a standing figure, of which all but four figures on the west front, two on each side, have been destroyed. <b>More</b> <b>have</b> survived on the northern and eastern sides of the north tower. Cockerell speculates that those to the south of the portal represented prophets and patriarchs of the Old Testament while those to the north represented early missionaries to Britain, of which Augustine of Canterbury, St Birinus, and Benedict Biscop are identifiable by their attributes. In the second zone, above each pair of standing figures, is a quatrefoil containing a half-length angel in relief, some of which have survived. Between the gables of the niches are quatrefoils that contain a series of narratives from the Bible, with the Old Testament stories to the south, above the prophets and patriarchs, and those from the New Testament to the north. A horizontal course runs around the west front dividing the architectural storeys at this point.|$|E
5|$|Most of the cultivars {{brought into}} {{cultivation}} in Australia {{in the latter}} part of the 20th century are perennials. 'Dargan Hill Monarch' was the first of these, and many <b>more</b> <b>have</b> followed. Profusely flowering, these grow in many colours including white, yellow, orange, bronze, pink, and red. Their commercial lifespans are generally around three years. Queensland-based company Aussie Winners has a range of compact plants ranging from orange to white known as Sundaze. Plants of this series usually have larger leaves. This range won the Gran premio d'oro at the Euroflora exposition in Geneva in 2001, for the best new plant series in the previous three years. 'Florabella Gold', a member of the Florabella series, won the award for best new pot plant (vegetative) in the Society of American Florists' competition of 1999. The Wallaby cultivars are range of taller forms with narrow leaves and white, yellow or pink flowers. Other commercial ranges include the Nullarbor series, and Queensland Federation daisies, including 'Wanetta Sunshine' and 'Golden Nuggets'.|$|E

5|$|The {{first modern}} {{population}} census {{in the country}} was conducted in 1857, and 15 <b>more</b> <b>have</b> been performed since then. Since 1961 the censuses are conducted in regular ten-year intervals, with the latest one in 2011. The first institution {{set up in the}} country specifically for the purposes of maintaining population statistics was the State Statistical Office, founded in 1875. Since its founding, the office changed its name and structure several times and was alternately subordinated to other institutions and independent, until the most recent changes in 1992, when the institution became the Croatian Bureau of Statistics. The 2011 census was performed on 1–28 April 2011, recording situation as of 31 March 2011. The first census results, containing the number of the population by settlement, were published on 29 June 2011, and the final comprehensive set of data was published in December 2012. The 2011 census and processing of the data gathered by the census was expected to cost 171.9million kuna (23.3million euro). The 2011 census was performed using new methodology: the permanent population was determined as the enumerated population who lived in the census area for at least 12 months prior to the census, or plans to live in the same area for at least 12 months after the census. This method was also retroactively applied to the 2001 census data.|$|E
