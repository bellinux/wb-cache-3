5|$|Cannel coal (also called candle coal) {{is a type}} of {{terrestrial}} shale, which is hydrogen-rich brown to black coal, sometimes with shaly texture, composed of resins, spores, waxes, cutinaceous and corky materials derived from terrestrial vascular plants as well as varied amounts of vitrinite and inertinite. Lacustrine shales consist of Lamosite and Torbanite. Lamosite is a pale-brown and grayish-brown to dark-gray to black oil shale whose chief organic constituent is lamalginite derived from lacustrine planktonic algae. Torbanite, named after Torbane Hill in Scotland, is a black oil shale whose organic matter is telalginite derived from lipid-rich Botryococcus and related algal forms. Marine shales consist of three varieties, namely Kukersite, Tasmanite, and <b>Marinite.</b> Kukersite, named after Kukruse in Estonia, is a light-brown marine oil shale whose principal organic component is telalginite derived from the green alga, Gloeocapsomorpha prisca. Tasmanite, named after Tasmania, is a brown to black oil shale whose organic matter consists of telalginite derived chiefly from unicellular tasmanitid algae of marine origin. <b>Marinite</b> is a gray to dark-gray to black oil shale of marine origin in which the chief organic components are lamalginite and bituminite derived from marine phytoplankton with varied admixtures of bitumen, telalginite, and vitrinite.|$|E

40|$|The {{decay of}} {{hydrogen}} chloride (HCl) {{has been studied}} {{in a variety of}} large scale and small scale fire scenarios. In fact, it has also been studied in scenarios where HCl was not generated in a fire but was simply introduced into the scenario directly. The effects of a variety of atmospheric conditions and of surfaces (in particular, but not only, construction surfaces) have also been investigated. The large scale scenarios were principally the following: (a) a room and plenum, where HCl was generated in the plenum by electrical overload of poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) wire and cable coatings, (b) room and corridor, where HCl was generated in a “fire ” room and followed along a corridor, (c) room-corridor-room, where HCl was generated in a “fire ” room and followed along a corridor into a “target ” room and (d) HVAC scenario, where HCl was injected into a long series of tunnels simulating a heating, ventilating and air conditioning system. The small scale scenarios involved box-like containers, with 3 L and 200 L volumes, as well as heated glass flasks, of spherical and cylindrical shapes. The surfaces studied included the following: poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), glass, gypsum board, cement, <b>Marinite,</b> ceiling tile, painted gypsum board, painted PMMA and soot.

40|$|Oil shales are {{a diverse}} group of rocks that may become an {{important}} source of liquid fuel and chemical feedstocks. The bulk of the organic matter in oil shales is generally exinite derived from a variety of organisms ranging from terrestrial higher plants to freshwater and marine algae. In this study reflected light and fluorescence mode petrography provide data not readily available through chemical, transmitted light and palynological studies. The petrographic studies elucidate the mode of preservation and mineral-maceral relationships usually destroyed during mineralization and pyrolysis. Previous petrographic terminology for algal components is revised and two new terms, lamalginite and telaginite, are defined. Type of exinite is used to classify oil shales into three primary and six secondary groups. Telalginite derived from Reinschia and Pila, both related to the extant green alga Botryococcus braunii, is the major exinite in torbanite which is formed in shallow lakes associated with coal forming swamps. The reflectance of vitrinite in torbanite decreases as the alginite content increases. Lamosites are freshwater, laminated oil shales and are divided into Rundle type and Green River type. Australian Tertiary lamosites belong to the Rundle type and contain discrete lamalginite derived in part from the colonial green alga Pediastrum, the freshwater dinoflagellate Septodinium, and the acritarch Cleistosphaeridium. Botryococcus telalginite and huminite are minor constituents. Green River lamosite contains layered lamalginite with minor bitumen and huminite. Differences between the two forms of lamalginite in the Rundle and Green River type lamosites indicate that the environments of deposition were not the same for both types. Australian Tertiary lamosites were deposited in fresh to brackish water, probably nearshore lakes. Recognition of phytoplanktonic algae, but not benthonic or mat-forming algae, suggests that the bulk of the exinite in these lamosites was derived from planktonic precursors. The Rundle-Stuart and Byfield deposits have a brown coal unit overlying the lamosite units. In the Condor and Byfield deposits a brown coal unit underlies the lamosite units. The boundaries between the coal and lamosite units represent significant changes in the environments of deposition. The Duaringa deposit has brown coal interbedded with lamosite (as occurs in several of the Rundle-Stuart lamosite units) in a lower unit that is overlain by a younger lamosite unit containing a different assemblage of alginite to the older unit. Within the lamosite units of Australian Tertiary deposits the abundance of lamalginite changes vertically (but is not related to depth) but type does not. Lateral variation in the type of lamalginite was not observed in any deposit. Cannel coal contains abundant exinite derived from higher plants. Tasmanite, contains abundant telalginite derived from Tasmanites punctatus and related algae that have affinities with Pachysphaera pelagica. Lamalginite, derived from dinoflagellates, acritarchs and other algae, or bituminite is the dominant exinite in <b>marinite.</b> <b>Marinite</b> also contains tasmanitid telalginite and in some specimens, vitrinite-like organic matter of probable algal origin. Kukersite is composed of telalginite derived from Gloeocapsomorpha prisca, an alga that is closely related to Botryococcus. The classification and characterization of oil shales provides much-needed data from which a framework for further studies can develop. More meaningful comparisons of the chemical properties of kerogen and shale oil can be attempted and the behaviour of the oil shale during retorting can be more readily understood...|$|E
40|$|Providing cleaner {{sources of}} energy will require {{significant}} improvements to the solid-state materials available for energy storage and conversion technologies. Rechargeable lithium and sodium batteries are generally regarded as the best available candidates for future energy storage applications, {{particularly with regard to}} implementation within hybrid or fully electric vehicles, due to their high energy density. However, production of the next generation of rechargeable batteries will require significant improvements in the materials available for the cathode, anode and electrolyte. Modern computer modelling techniques enable valuable insights into the fundamental defect, ion transport and voltage properties of battery materials at the atomic level. Polyanionic framework materials are being investigated as alternative cathodes to LiCoO 2 in Li-ion batteries largely due to their greater stability, cost and environmental benefits. In this thesis, four types of polyanion materials are examined using computational techniques. Firstly, the pyrophosphate material, Li 2 FeP 2 O 7 is investigated, which has the highest voltage (3. 5 V) for an iron-based phosphate cathode. In this pyrophosphate material the anti-site defect in which the Li+ and Fe 2 + cations exchange positions is the intrinsic defect type found with the lowest energy. Lithium ion diffusion will follow non-linear, curved paths in the b-axis and c-axis directions, which show low migration energies. Hence, in contrast to 1 D diffusion in LiFePO 4, fast Li+ transport in Li 2 FeP 2 O 7 is predicted to be through a 2 D network in the bc-plane, which is important for good rate capability and for the function of particles without nano-sizing. Favourable doping is found for Na+ on the Li+ site, and isovalent dopants (e. g., Mn 2 +, Co 2 +, Cu 2 +) on the Fe 2 + site; the latter could be used in attempts to increase the Fe 2 +/Fe 3 + redox potential towards 4 V. Secondly, the relative abundance and low cost associated with Na-ion batteries now make them an attractive alternative for large-scale grid storage. Therefore, defect chemistry and ion migration results are presented for the sodium-based pyrophosphate framework, Na 2 MP 2 O 7 (where M = Fe, Mn). Formation energies for Na/M ion exchange are found to be higher than Li/Fe exchange, which has been related to the larger size of the Na ion compared to the Li ion. Low activation energies are found for long-range diffusion in all crystallographic directions in Na 2 MP 2 O 7 suggesting three-dimensional (3 D) Na-diffusion. Thirdly, the search for high voltage cathodes for lithium-ion batteries has led to recent interest in the Li 2 Fe(SO 4) 2 material which has a voltage of 3. 83 V vs lithium, the highest recorded for a fluorine-free iron-based compound. Ion conduction paths through the Li 2 M(SO 4) 2 (M = Fe, Mn, Co) <b>marinite</b> family of cathode materials, show low activation energies for lithium migration along the a-axis channels giving rise to long-range 1 D diffusion, supported by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Density functional theory (DFT) simulations were used to reproduce the observed high voltage of Li 2 Fe(SO 4) 2 and to make predictions of the voltages of both Li 2 Mn(SO 4) 2 and Li 2 Co(SO 4) 2, and also examine local structural distortions on lithium extraction. Finally, the layered and tavorite polymorphs of LiFeSO 4 OH have recently attracted interest as sustainable cathode materials offering low temperature synthesis routes. Using DFT techniques the experimental voltage and structural parameters are accurately reproduced for the tavorite polymorph. An important result for the layered structure, is that similar accuracy in both cell voltage and structure can only be obtained if a van der Waals functional is included in the DFT methodology to account for the inter-layer binding...|$|E
