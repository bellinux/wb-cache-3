5|$|On 9 July, a group {{representing}} Pakistani madrasahs, {{headed by}} Maulana Salimullah Khan, {{called for an}} immediate cessation of the Lal Masjid operation. Finland also temporarily closed its embassy in Islamabad on 9 July due to the deteriorating security situation and {{the proximity of the}} embassy to the mosque compound. By 10 July, the Pakistani government reported that 100 <b>militants</b> <b>and</b> between 300 and 400 women and children remained inside the mosque.|$|E

5|$|On December 14, 1998 the Yugoslav Army (VJ) ambushed a {{group of}} 140 Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) militants {{attempting}} to smuggle weapons and supplies from their base in Albania into the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. A five-hour battle ensued, ending with the deaths of 36 <b>militants</b> <b>and</b> the capture of a further nine. Dozens more fled back to Albania, abandoning large quantities of weapons and supplies, which were subsequently seized by the Yugoslav authorities. The ambush was the most serious war-related incident in Kosovo since a U.S.-negotiated truce took effect two months before. It came {{on the heels of}} increasing tensions in the province, where inter-ethnic violence had been escalating steadily since early 1996.|$|E
5|$|On September 27, {{the guerrillas}} assassinated the French-installed chief of Gò Công, {{displaying}} his severed {{head in the}} town market. The chief's servant, who was an informant for Định, aided this operation. The killing {{had the effect of}} intimidating the chief's designated successor into submitting to the rebels and ceasing his service for the French. In November 1861, Định's men went into the town of Mỹ Tho to recruit <b>militants</b> <b>and</b> collect food supplies. During this time, they attacked and burned pro-French villages and their leaders.|$|E
5|$|The complex was besieged from 3 to 11 July 2007, while {{negotiations}} were attempted between the <b>militants</b> <b>and</b> the state's Shujaat Hussain and Ijaz-ul-Haq. Once negotiations failed, the complex was stormed and {{captured by the}} Pakistan Army's Special Service Group. The government reported that the operation resulted in 154 deaths, and 50 militants were captured (other estimates were higher). It also prompted pro-Taliban rebels along the Afghan border to nullify a 10-month-old peace agreement with the Pakistani Government. This event triggered the Third Waziristan War, which marked another surge in militancy and violence in Pakistan and has resulted in more than 3,000 casualties.|$|E

5|$|There was {{a common}} belief among the Poles that most Jews were Bolsheviks and Communists, in league with the enemy of the Polish state, Soviet Russia. The Polish army stated that any Jews it killed were <b>militants</b> <b>and</b> {{collaborators}} engaged in actions against the Polish army. Having been fired at from Jewish homes, Polish soldiers took this {{as an excuse to}} break into many Jewish homes and stores, beating the Jews and robbing them, desecrating synagogues, arresting hundreds, depriving them of food and drink for days and deporting them from the city; such abuses were, however, not supported by – and even specifically forbidden by – the Polish high command.|$|E
5|$|All of {{the warring}} parties were {{responsible}} for widespread violations {{of the laws of}} war, as civilians were caught in the ensuing crossfire. Insurgents reportedly deployed <b>militants</b> <b>and</b> established strongholds in heavily populated neighborhoods, launched mortar rounds from residential areas, and targeted public and private individuals for assassination and violence. TFG forces alleged to have failed to efficaciously warn civilians in combat zones, impeded relief efforts, plundered property, in some instances engaged in murder and violence, and mistreated detainees during mass arrests. According to HRW, the implicated TFG forces included military, police and intelligence personnel, as well as the private guards of senior TFG officials. Victims were often unable to identify TFG personnel, and confused militiamen aligned with TFG officials with TFG police officers and other state security personnel.|$|E
5|$|Gaddafi {{transformed}} Libya {{into a new}} socialist state {{called a}} Jamahiriya ("state of the masses") in 1977. He officially adopted a symbolic role in governance but remained head of both {{the military and the}} Revolutionary Committees responsible for policing and suppressing dissent. During the 1970s and 1980s, Libya's unsuccessful border conflicts with Egypt and Chad, support for foreign <b>militants,</b> <b>and</b> alleged responsibility for the Lockerbie bombing left it increasingly isolated on the international stage. A particularly hostile relationship developed with the United States, United Kingdom, and Israel, resulting in the 1986 U.S. bombing of Libya and United Nations-imposed economic sanctions. From 1999, Gaddafi rejected Arab socialism and encouraged economic privatization, rapprochement with Western nations, and Pan-Africanism; he was Chairperson of the African Union from 2009–10. Amid the 2011 Arab Spring, protests against widespread corruption and unemployment broke out in eastern Libya. The situation descended into civil war, in which NATO intervened militarily {{on the side of the}} anti-Gaddafist National Transitional Council (NTC). The government was overthrown and Gaddafi retreated to Sirte, only to be captured and killed by NTC militants.|$|E
