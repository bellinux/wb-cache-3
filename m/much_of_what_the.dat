5|$|Thomas Dales, an {{assistant}} constable, arrived from Birmingham, {{where he was}} one of those responsible for policing the town. On ascertaining the situation he interrogated Thornton, and soon arrested him. However, Dales did not keep any notes and later proved unable to remember <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> prisoner told him. Thornton was then examined by the local magistrate, William Bedford, who ordered Thornton searched. The search revealed that Thornton was wearing underclothing with bloodstains, and Thornton admitted having sexual intercourse with Ashford the previous night. The prisoner's shoes were removed, and comparisons with the footprints in the field were made by the factory workers, who later testified at trial that they matched. A post-mortem examination revealed that Ashford died from drowning, and that the only marks on her body were two lacerations in the genital area. The examination concluded that until the sexual act which caused the bleeding, Ashford was a virgin. She was menstruating at the time of her death.|$|E

A major breakthrough was the deciphering of the Maya syllabary in the 1950s, which has allowed the glyphs carved into many temples to be understood. Excavation and forensic examination of human remains has also thrown light on the age, sex and cause of death of sacrificial victims.|$|E

25|$|In {{the summer}} of 1975, congressional Church Committee reports and the presidential Rockefeller Commission report {{revealed}} {{to the public for}} the first time that the CIA and the Department of Defense had conducted experiments on both unwitting and cognizant human subjects as part of an extensive program to find out how to influence and control human behavior through the use of psychoactive drugs such as LSD and mescaline and other chemical, biological, and psychological means. They also revealed that at least one subject, Frank Olson had died after administration of LSD. <b>Much</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> Church Committee and the Rockefeller Commission learned about MKUltra was contained in a report, prepared by the Inspector General's office in 1963, that had survived the destruction of records ordered in 1973. However, it contained little detail. Sidney Gottlieb, who had retired from the CIA two years previously, was interviewed by the committee but claimed to have very little recollection of the activities of MKUltra.|$|E

500|$|Bohemond's lands were {{to include}} St Simeon and the coast, {{the towns of}} Baghras and Artah, and the Latin {{possessions}} in the Jebel as-Summaq. Latakia and Cilicia, however, were to revert to direct Byzantine rule. As Thomas Asbridge points out, <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> Emperor granted to Bohemond (including Aleppo itself) was still in Muslim hands (e.g. neither Bohemond nor Alexios controlled Edessa, although at the time Tancred was regent there {{as well as in}} Antioch), which contradicts Lilie's assessment that Bohemond did well out of the Treaty. René Grousset calls the Treaty a [...] "Diktat", but Jean Richard underscores that the rules of feudal law to which Bohemond had to submit [...] "were in no way humiliating." [...] According to John W. Birkenmeier, the Treaty marked the point at which Alexios had developed a new army, and new tactical doctrines with which to use it, {{but it was not a}} Byzantine political success; [...] "it traded Bohemond's freedom for a titular overlordship of Southern Italy that could never be effective, and for an occupation of Antioch that could never be carried out." ...|$|E
500|$|... {{literary}} {{societies that}} began in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. [...] The first such society at Dartmouth, the Social Friends, was formed in 1783. [...] A rival organization, called the United Fraternity, was founded in 1786. [...] A chapter of Phi Beta Kappa was established at Dartmouth in 1787, and counted among its members Daniel Webster, class of 1801. [...] These organizations were, in large part, the only social life available to students at the college. [...] The organizations hosted debates on a variety of topics not encountered in the curriculum of the day, and amassed large libraries of titles not found in the official College library. [...] Both the Social Friends and the United Fraternity created libraries in Dartmouth Hall, and met in a room called Society Hall inside Dartmouth Hall. [...] In 1815, the college decided to intervene in the hotly contested recruitment battle between the Social Friends and the United Fraternity by restricting each society to recruit only from separate halves of the new student class. [...] In 1825, the college began simply assigning new students to one society or the other. [...] Interest in the literary societies declined in the 1830s and 1840s. [...] The College library and instructional curriculum had expanded to include <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> literary societies had supported, and new Greek letter societies began to appear on campus.|$|E

2500|$|Shelley Stamp {{argues that}} Weber's [...] "image was {{instrumental}} in defining both her particular place in film-making practices, and women's roles within early Hollywood generally", and that her [...] "wifely, bourgeois persona, relatively conservative and staid, mirrored the film industry's idealized conception of its new customers: white, married, middle-class women perceived to be arbiters of taste in their communities". [...] While Weber's beliefs reflected modern values, as did {{her career as a}} filmmaker that was atypical for women of her era, she had [...] "internalized <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> Victorians deemed proper behavior for women", and there are [...] "strong elements of the Victorian code of womanhood in her films". The Smalleys exemplified and promoted the Victorian ideal of marriage as companionship and a partnership.|$|E
2500|$|In the 20th century Ezra Pound's poem [...] "Homage to Sextus Propertius" [...] cast Propertius as {{something}} of a satirist and political dissident, and his translation/interpretation of the elegies presented them as ancient examples of Pound's own Imagist theory of art. Pound identified in Propertius an example of what he called (in [...] "How to Read") 'logopoeia', [...] "the dance of the intellect among words." [...] Gilbert Highet, in Poets in a Landscape, attributed this to Propertius' use of mythic allusions and circumlocution, which Pound mimics to more comic effect in his Homage. The imagist interpretation, the poet's tendency to sustain an interior monologue, and the deeply personal nature of his poetry have made Propertius a favorite in the modern age. Two modern English translations of his work have appeared since 2000, and the playwright Tom Stoppard suggests in his best-known work The Invention of Love that the poet was responsible for <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> West regards today as [...] "romantic love".|$|E

Lieberman says that while his wife frequented lesbian bars, it was because she did not want a repeat of the situation that had happened with her coworker. She never had sex with the women she went home with, he claims, and they would often merely listen to music, sleep or paint. One time, in fact, she came home covered with paint after going home with an artist. Her drinking was a temporary phase to ease her through the depression she was experiencing after being fired by Cabrini, and would stop once her life got back to normal, as he believed it was doing.|$|E
