The lifespan of this fish about 2.5 years, but difficult to determine because the annual rings in their scales may be formed for several reasons other than yearly changes in their environment. Only {{after the first year}} are the rings a reliable indicator of age, because they may be formed due to the reduced feeding activity associated with planktonic scarcity during the rise in temperature of the environment in summer. An experiment was done by <b>measuring</b> <b>scales</b> from a selected body area, and then determining the relationship between the fish length and scale length. According to these tests, the average lengths for each ring were 14.3, 16.4, and 18.4 cm at the age of one, two, and three years, respectively.|$|E

However, in some places, instead of hangam, anna used which is based on twelve-hour period for each quota. Therefore, if a person own 16 quotas it means that he is entitled for water for eight days in high seasons and 16 days in winter when water level went down as well as expectation of winter rain (Baharga) in Makran region.

50|$|A {{travelling}} microscope is {{an instrument}} for measuring length with a resolution typically {{in the order of}} 0.01mm. The precision is such that better-quality instruments have <b>measuring</b> <b>scales</b> made from Invar to avoid misreadings due to thermal effects. The instrument comprises a microscope mounted on two rails fixed to, or part of a very rigid bed. The position of the microscope can be varied coarsely by sliding along the rails, or finely by turning a screw. The eyepiece is fitted with fine cross-hairs to fix a precise position, which is then read off the vernier scale. Some instruments, such as that produced in the 1960s by the Precision Tool and Instrument Company of Thornton Heath, Surrey, England, also measure vertically. The purpose of the microscope is to aim at reference marks with much higher accuracy than is possible using the naked eye. It is used in laboratories to measure the refractive index of liquids using the geometrical concepts of ray optics. It is also used to measure very short distances precisely, for example the diameter of a capillary tube. This mechanical instrument has now largely been superseded by electronic- and optically-based measuring devices that are both very much more accurate and considerably cheaper to produce.|$|E

The second stage was a pilot study with ten participating SMEs. The responses from the pilot study allowed the authors to verify whether respondents were biased towards certain categories of questions or leaving questions unanswered. The study found that all respondents answered all questions and the responses on the ordinal scales were reasonably dispersed. Finally, the <b>measuring</b> <b>scales</b> were tested to verify the reliability of instrument with the help of Cronbach’s alpha (α) (Hinton [2004]; Black [1999]).

40|$|In this paper, {{a general}} formula has been modified, proving that the scaling {{difference}} of a surface parameter depends {{not only on}} the variance of the surface parameter itself but also on the function structure of the surface parameter. Through quantitatively describing the relationship between <b>scaling</b> differences and <b>measuring</b> <b>scale,</b> in terms of the concept of information fractal dimension and topological dimension, a definition of information fractal dimension used in remote sensing was proposed. By computing the information fractal dimension of Leaf Area Index and surface temperature, we found that the method describes not only the information on spatial texture and spatial structure of remotely sensed data as the traditional methods did, but also illustrates the connection between the <b>scaling</b> difference and <b>measuring</b> <b>scale.</b> Where the information fractal dimension of a surface parameter in some areas is known, the scaling difference can be obtained according to the <b>measuring</b> <b>scale,</b> then it can be eliminated and more accurate results could be achieved after scaling transform.

This study was to evaluate the efficacy of wound infiltration with local anesthetics in reducing postoperative pain after appendectomy. This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial on 40 patients with non-complicated acute appendicitis. Cases received a combination of lidocaine hydrochloride and bupivacaine hydrochloride after appendectomy and before closing the wound. Controls received the same volume of saline solution. Injections were done both under the fascia of external oblique muscle and intradermal. Pain assessment was done by two pain <b>measuring</b> <b>scales,</b> VAS and NRS, in 4, 8, 12 and 24 hours after the operation. Cases and controls were the same in age, sex, and history of opium addiction. Pain peaked in the 8 th hour after operation in both groups and reduced afterwards.

No significant difference {{was seen in the}} time of receiving the first analgesic after the operation but the frequency of analgesic consumption was significantly lower in controls. This study showed local anesthetic infiltration to be effective in reducing the postoperative pain in patients undergoing appendectomy which is in contrast with the previous studies.

40|$|We {{introduce}} {{a notion of}} <b>measuring</b> <b>scales</b> for quantum abelian gauge systems. At each measuring scale a finite dimensional affine space stores information about {{the evaluation of the}} curvature on a discrete family of surfaces. Affine maps from the spaces assigned to finer scales to those assigned to coarser scales play the role of coarse graining maps. This structure induces a continuum limit space which contains information regarding curvature evaluation on all piecewise linear surfaces with boundary. The evaluation of holonomies along loops is also encoded in the spaces introduced here; thus, our framework is closely related to loop quantization and it allows us to discuss effective theories in a sensible way. We develop basic elements of measure theory on the introduced spaces which are essential for the applicability of the framework to the construction of quantum abelian gauge theories.
