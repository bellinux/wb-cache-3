40|$|The Sapir {{report in}} 2004 famously dubbed the EU Budget a {{historical}} relic. In spite {{of calls from}} many quarters for a comprehensive budget reform, the Council negotiation was hampered by many institutional and political constraints and managed to deliver only limited change. However, the final agreement on the <b>Multiannual</b> <b>Financial</b> Framework 2007 / 13 did introduce a potentially important novelty, namely a review clause in 2008 / 9. Such an occasion should be seized to introduce appropriate incentives and tools for revamping the EU budget {{with the aim of}} making it consistent with the Lisbon-oriented objectives of the EU. This paper argues for the respect of the <b>Multiannual</b> <b>Financial</b> Framework over the period covered rather than in every single year and per every single heading. This should be accomplished via an inter-temporal guarantee of the respect of the <b>Multiannual</b> <b>Financial</b> Framework and coupled with cost-benefit analysis of the additional spending carried out at the EU level. Such â€œconstrained flexibilityâ€, which can be introduced either under the current or the new Lisbon Treaty, should be supported by appropriate governance arrangements to ensure the respect of subsidiarity, allow an efficient running of the budget and enforce budgetary discipline.

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} how {{change and}} stability have affected EU budget policy {{during the current}} 2007 - 13 period. It argues that the budget is, on the whole, marked by stability, but changes were seen within and across specific policies leading to three revisions of the <b>Multiannual</b> <b>Financial</b> Framework (MFF) during the first Barroso Commission. These changes and the new institutional provisions of the Lisbon Treaty may hold interesting projections for the next multi-annual budget period starting in 2014...|$|R
40|$|The main aim of {{the paper}} is to display and analyse both the revenue and the {{expenditure}} side of the future budget which came to light in the Commission proposal concerning the EU new <b>Multiannual</b> <b>Financial</b> Framework (MFF) of 2014 - 2020. Efforts were also made to clarify the interests lying behind claims and different behaviour of the member states vis-a-vis the common European budget. All available EU documents on MFF were exploited, especially those published concerning the Commission proposal {{at the end of}} June 2011. As a very interesting observation, it was revealed that the Commission proposal rather favours the old and/or developed member states than the new and/or underdeveloped ones. Considering the amount of efforts needed to surmount the crisis and to stabilise public finances, considering in addition the weakening propensity of net contributors to the budget (especially that of Germany) to place EU-cooperation before their own national interests, it is to be feared that the next MFF will not be the one to accelerate the catching-up process of the less developed regions of Europe.

50|$|Discussing {{financial}} and legal complexities involved in negotiating withdrawal, including settlement of outstanding financial liabilities and division of assets, the report mentions (paragraph 15) that the EU budget {{is funded by}} revenue drawn from various sources, governed by the EU’s Own Resources Decision (ORD), which was made part of UK law by the European Union (Finance) Act 2015. The revenue includes contributions from import duties and VAT collected by member states.

40|$|Macroeconomic {{conditionality}} {{has become}} one of the major elements in discussions on the future of EU cohesion policy. Such conditional-ity would make the cohesion budget dependent on EU economic governance rules. This would have advantages for economic governance and, to a lesser extent, the efficiency of cohesion policy and the EU’s <b>Multiannual</b> <b>Financial</b> Framework negotiations. Yet, conditionality also risks entailing serious disadvantages for the end beneficiaries and cohesion policy itself. If the EU decides to put macroeconomic conditionality in place, it needs to reconsider the design and agree on an ample cohesion budget...|$|R

The scope of the review, as laid down in the legislation, as well as the difficult implementation of the MFF in its first years, give grounds to expect changes in the MFF Regulation.

In the negotiations for Horizon 2020, which will follow the 7th Research Framework Programme (FP7), he supports the restructuring of the available sources towards more funding for small and medium-sized enterprises. At the same time, he requests in the ongoing budget negotiations for the new <b>Multiannual</b> <b>Financial</b> Framework (MFF) an increase of means for growth generating measures in education, science and research. According to him, ultimately it always have been technological innovations that have shaped the history of mankind. Hence, today's investments into research, shape Europe's destiny of tomorrow.|$|R

Specifically, policymakers have attempted to reconcile the need to balance the level of payments per hectare among administrative regions, altimetric regions, and agricultural sectors with increased requests for greater FIs in a sector where prices, income volatility, and natural risks are high and profitability levels are, on average, below those {{in the rest of the}} economy (Severini and Tantari 2013 a).|$|R

In this paper I analyse an original dataset containing yearly data on the main macrocategories of expenditure and how they have changed over the last three decades (1984 - 2013). Using time series analysis, I find that the ability to form winning coalitions in the Council, the ideological position of the co-legislators, and some ‘structuring events’ - like the adoption of the <b>Multiannual</b> <b>Financial</b> Framework and the accession of the cohesion countries - have a significant role in driving the process of budgetary reform...|$|R
