5|$|Elected {{with support}} from the Farmers' Alliance {{and as a result of}} {{agricultural}} protest, Tillman was thought likely to join the Populists in their challenge to the established parties. Tillman refused, and generally opposed Populist positions that went beyond his program of increasing access to higher education and reform of the Democratic Party (white supremacy was not a Populist position). The Alliance (and Populists) demanded a system of subtreasuries under the federal government, that could accept farmers' crops and advance them 80 percent of the value interest-free. Tillman, not wanting <b>more</b> <b>federal</b> officeholders in the state (that in Republican administrations might be filled by African Americans), initially opposed the proposal. Many farmers felt strongly about this issue, and in 1891, Tillman was censured by the state Alliance for his opposition. Attuned to political necessities, Tillman gradually came to support the subtreasuries in time for his re-election campaign in 1892, though he was never an active proponent.|$|E

25|$|Two {{months after}} being sworn in, Rizzo {{endorsed}} Richard Nixon, a Republican, for re-election as US president. In return for Rizzo's support, the victorious Nixon granted <b>more</b> <b>federal</b> funding to Philadelphia. But the action alienated many of Rizzo's supporters {{in his own}} party. The Democratic city committee, Democrats on the city council, and party chairman Peter Camiel viewed Rizzo's action as a betrayal.|$|E
25|$|However, {{after the}} Treaty of Maastricht, Parliament gained {{a much bigger}} role. Maastricht brought in the codecision procedure, which gave it equal {{legislative}} power with the Council on Community matters. Hence, with the greater powers of the supranational institutions and the operation of Qualified Majority Voting in the Council, the Community pillar {{could be described as}} a far <b>more</b> <b>federal</b> method of decision making.|$|E
25|$|Federal {{involvement}} in the territories was considerable. In addition to direct subsidies, the federal government maintained military posts, provided safety from Indian attacks, bankrolled treaty obligations, conducted surveys and land sales, built roads, staffed land offices, made harbour improvements, and subsidized overland mail delivery. Territorial citizens came to both decry federal power and local corruption, {{and at the same}} time, lament that <b>more</b> <b>federal</b> dollars were not sent their way.|$|E

After killing two <b>more</b> <b>federal</b> agents, Castor briefly takes Jamie hostage, but she escapes by stabbing him with a butterfly knife Castor ironically gave her earlier for self-defense. A speedboat chase ensues wherein Sean forces Castor to shore by collision, then bests Castor in a melee fight. Castor mutilates his/Sean's face to taunt him, but Sean kills Castor with a spear gun. Backup agents arrive and address Sean by name, having been convinced by Eve of Sean's true identity. After the face transplant surgery is undone, Sean returns home, adopting Adam into his family and keeping his promise to Sasha.|$|E
25|$|Louisiana taxpayers receive <b>more</b> <b>federal</b> funding per {{dollar of}} federal taxes paid {{compared}} to the average state. Per dollar of federal tax collected in 2005, Louisiana citizens received approximately $1.78 {{in the way of}} federal spending. This ranks the state fourth highest nationally and represents a rise from 1995 when Louisiana received $1.35 per dollar of taxes in federal spending (ranked seventh nationally). Neighboring states and the amount of federal spending received per dollar of federal tax collected were: Texas ($0.94), Arkansas ($1.41), and Mississippi ($2.02). Federal spending in 2005 and subsequent years since has been exceptionally high due to the recovery from Hurricane Katrina.|$|E
25|$|From 1952, {{with the}} {{appointment}} of Sir Owen Dixon as Chief Justice, the court entered a period of stability. After World War II, the court's workload continued to grow, particularly from the 1960s onwards, putting pressures on the court. Sir Garfield Barwick, who was Attorney-General from 1958 to 1964, and from then until 1981 Chief Justice, proposed that <b>more</b> <b>federal</b> courts be established, as permitted under the Constitution. In 1976 the Federal Court of Australia was established, with a general federal jurisdiction, and in more recent years the Family Court and Federal Magistrates Court {{have been set up}} to reduce the court's workload in specific areas.|$|E

25|$|In early 2001, President Bush {{worked with}} Republicans in Congress to pass {{legislation}} changing the way the federal government regulated, taxed and funded charities and non-profit initiatives run by religious organizations. Although prior to the legislation {{it was possible for}} these organizations to receive federal assistance, the new legislation removed reporting requirements, which required the organizations to separate their charitable functions from their religious functions. Bush also created the White House Office of Faith Based and Community Initiatives. Days into his first term, Bush announced his commitment to channeling <b>more</b> <b>federal</b> aid to faith-based service organizations. Bush created the Office of Faith-Based and Community Initiatives to assist faith-based service organizations. Critics claimed that this was an infringement of {{the separation of church and}} state.|$|E
25|$|Most Democrats {{and some}} Republicans are {{critical}} of such ideas, {{partly because of the}} large (US$1 trillion or <b>more)</b> <b>federal</b> borrowing the plan would require, which might actually worsen the imbalance between revenues and expenses that Bush pointed to as a looming problem; and partly because of the problems encountered by the United Kingdom's privatized pension plan. See Social Security debate (United States). In addition, many Democrats opposed changes that they felt were turning Social Security into a welfare program that would be politically vulnerable. Portions of Bush's bill exempting private companies from social security payments have led to complaints that Bush's plan was created to benefit private companies, and that it would turn Social Security into just another insurance program.|$|E
25|$|In {{the center}} were the conservationists, led by Theodore Roosevelt and his {{coalition}} of outdoorsmen, sportsmen, bird watchers and scientists. They wanted to reduce waste; emphasized {{the value of}} natural beauty for tourism and ample wildlife for hunters; and argued that careful management would not only enhance these goals but also increase the long-term economic benefits to society by planned harvesting and environmental protections. Roosevelt worked his entire career to put the issue high on the national agenda. He was deeply committed to conserving natural resources. He worked closely with Gifford Pinchot and used the Newlands Reclamation Act of 1902 to promote federal construction of dams to irrigate small farms and placed 230 million acres (360,000mi² or 930,000km²) under federal protection. Roosevelt set aside <b>more</b> <b>Federal</b> land, national parks, and nature preserves than all of his predecessors combined.|$|E

25|$|In January 2002, Bush {{signed the}} No Child Left Behind Act, with Democratic Senator Ted Kennedy as chief sponsor, {{which aims to}} close the {{achievement}} gap, measures student performance, provides options to parents with children in low-performing schools, and targets <b>more</b> <b>federal</b> funding to low-income schools. Critics, including Senator John Kerry and the National Education Association, say schools were not given the resources to help meet new standards, although their argument is based on premise that authorization levels are spending promises instead of spending caps. The House Committee on Education and the Workforce said that the Department of Education's overall funding increased by US$14 billion since the enactment of NCLB in fiscal year 2001, going from US$42.6 billion to US$56.6 billion in fiscal year 2005. Some state governments are refusing to implement provisions of the act {{as long as they}} are not adequately funded.|$|E
25|$|Supporters of the Davis–Bacon Act {{contend that}} these costs {{differences}} either don't exist {{or may be}} justified. One contention is that higher paid labor may be paid more because they have superior skills and are more productive. Under this assumption, a union journeyman would be worth the additional money because he works faster, more accurately, and with less supervision than an inexperienced worker. For example, four union journeyman paid $25 per hour might perform as well as or better than five entry level workers being paid $20 per hour. Others point out that federal projects {{tend to be more}} complex and require more skilled labor than on either private or state projects. Yet another counterpoint is that by inflating wages, such requirements direct more income into the middle class rather than paying rock bottom dollars to unskilled labor through federal programs while supporting their families through social service programs. Finally, blogger Matthew Yglesias has suggested that because union workers tend to vote overwhelmingly Democratic, and because Democrats favor <b>more</b> <b>federal</b> projects, then Davis-Bacon may actually increase the amount of infrastructure built by supporting those who indirectly vote for more programs.|$|E

This came after the state had seen its share of faith-based grants decline over the preceding three years.

Increased European integration giving a central body increased control over the budgets of member states was proposed on 14 June 2012 by Jens Weidmann President of the Deutsche Bundesbank, expanding on ideas first proposed by Jean-Claude Trichet, {{former president of the}} European Central Bank. Control, including requirements that taxes be raised or budgets cut, would be exercised only when fiscal imbalances developed. This proposal is similar to contemporary calls by Angela Merkel for increased political and fiscal union which would [...] "allow Europe oversight possibilities".|$|E
500|$|Strong {{opposition}} to the whiskey tax by cottage producers in remote, rural regions erupted into the Whiskey Rebellion in 1794; in Western Pennsylvania and western Virginia, whiskey was the basic export product and was fundamental to the local economy. In response to the rebellion, believing compliance with the laws was vital {{to the establishment of}} federal authority, Hamilton accompanied to the rebellion's site President Washington, General Henry [...] "Light Horse Harry" [...] Lee, and <b>more</b> <b>federal</b> troops than were ever assembled in one place during the Revolution.

500|$|One of the administration's early major {{initiatives}} was the No Child Left Behind Act, which {{aimed to}} measure and {{close the gap between}} rich and poor student performance, provide options to parents with students in low-performing schools, and target <b>more</b> <b>federal</b> funding to low-income schools. This landmark education initiative passed with broad bipartisan support, including that of Senator Ted Kennedy of Massachusetts. It was signed into law by Bush in early 2002. Many contend that the initiative has been successful, as cited by the fact that students in the U.S. have performed significantly better on state reading and math tests since Bush signed [...] "No Child Left Behind" [...] into law.
