60|$|He {{walked the}} rest of the way home in indignant silence, and, after giving minute {{instructions}} to <b>Mr.</b> <b>Kemp</b> next morning at breakfast, went off to work in a more cheerful frame of mind. <b>Mr.</b> <b>Kemp</b> was out when he returned, and after making his toilet he followed him to Mrs. Bradshaw's.|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Bradshaw's [...] "Well! Well!" [...] {{seemed to}} sum up the general feeling; <b>Mr.</b> <b>Kemp,</b> shaking his head, eyed him with gentle reproach.|$|E
6000|$|<b>Mr.</b> <b>Kemp</b> nodded. [...] "I {{can turn}} 'em round my little finger," [...] he said. [...] "You'll have Bella all to {{yourself}} to-morrow evening." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "I Don't Like Dogs!": <b>Mrs</b> <b>Kemp</b> has terrible cynophobia (fear of dogs) {{and this}} fear passes {{on to her}} {{daughter}} Helen. After <b>Mrs</b> <b>Kemp</b> dies, Dad finds a new girlfriend, Rowena, but when Helen sees she has a golden retriever, Benji, her cynophobia starts causing problems with the new relationship.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Hodges {{sat down}} beside <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Kemp</b> and {{proceeded}} to comfort her.|$|R
50|$|When <b>Mrs</b> <b>Kemp</b> {{comes home}} and sees her {{daughter}}'s injuries, all she does is offer her some alcohol (whiskey or gin). That evening they both get drunk, despite Liza's pregnancy. During {{the next night}} Liza has a miscarriage. Mr Hodges, who lives upstairs, fetches a doctor from the nearby hospital, who soon says he can do nothing for her. While her daughter is dying, <b>Mrs</b> <b>Kemp</b> has a long talk with Mrs Hodges, a midwife and sick-nurse. Liza's last visitor is Jim, but Liza is already in a coma. <b>Mrs</b> <b>Kemp</b> and <b>Mrs</b> Hodges {{are talking about the}} funeral arrangements when they hear Liza's death rattle and the doctor declares her dead.|$|R
6000|$|... "'Ark at him," [...] {{said the}} {{blushing}} <b>Mr.</b> <b>Kemp,</b> as Mrs. Bradshaw {{shook her head}} at the offender {{and told him to}} behave himself.|$|E
60|$|He ordered {{some more}} beer for <b>Mr.</b> <b>Kemp,</b> {{and in a}} low voice gave him as much of the family history as he {{considered}} necessary.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, I don't," [...] said <b>Mr.</b> <b>Kemp,</b> plainly. [...] "I'm {{not going}} back, never no more--never! I'm {{going to stop}} here and court Mrs. Bradshaw." ...|$|E
60|$|Liza did not answer, and <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Kemp,</b> {{having nothing}} more to say, {{continued}} her supper in silence.|$|R
60|$|<b>Mrs.</b> <b>Kemp</b> {{considered}} it a judgment of Providence. She got up and mixed some whisky and water.|$|R
60|$|After which pious remark <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Kemp</b> {{went out}} of the house and turned into another a few doors up.|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{you can go}} and fetch a hansom-cab, George, while she's a-doing of it," [...] said <b>Mr.</b> <b>Kemp.</b> [...] "Pick out a good 'orse--spotted-grey, if you can." ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>Mr.</b> <b>Kemp</b> brightened. [...] "Well, mine isn't {{as bad as}} that... No, I don't mean that," [...] {{he broke}} off apologetically. [...] "Both awfully jolly names, of course..." ...|$|E
60|$|He took <b>Mr.</b> <b>Kemp</b> {{round the}} waist, and the {{laughing}} Bella {{and her mother}} each secured an arm. An appeal to Mr. Wright to secure his legs passed unheeded.|$|E
60|$|Quite accidentally {{there was}} some in the room, and <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Kemp</b> poured it out {{for herself and her}} friend.|$|R
60|$|<b>Mrs.</b> <b>Kemp's</b> money always ran out on Tuesday, and Liza had to {{keep things}} going till the {{following}} Saturday.|$|R
60|$|There {{was no one}} to hear; <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Kemp</b> {{continued}} to sleep heavily, occasionally breaking out into a little snore.|$|R
60|$|She patted Mr. Kemp's hand; <b>Mr.</b> <b>Kemp</b> patted back, {{and with}} his {{disengaged}} hand helped himself to a glass of beer--the fourth--and beamed in a friendly fashion upon the company.|$|E
6000|$|... "She ain't coming out," [...] said <b>Mr.</b> <b>Kemp.</b> [...] "She's {{going to}} stay at home and mind the shop; it's the mother what's coming out. Going to spend the evening with me!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I didn't do it," [...] said <b>Mr.</b> <b>Kemp,</b> equably; [...] "they done it. The {{old lady}} says that, just {{for once in}} her life, {{she wants to see}} how it feels to spend money like water." ...|$|E
6000|$|... ''Usbands is cautions, 'owever {{good they}} are,' said <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Kemp,</b> aphoristically. 'But I mustn't stay aht 'ere {{in the night}} air.' ...|$|R
50|$|Uncle Hobart Kemp: Howie's {{uncle who}} marries Ramona's aunt, Beatrice. He is <b>Mr.</b> <b>Kemp's</b> younger brother. He makes his only {{appearance}} in Ramona Forever.|$|R
6000|$|... 'You're right, <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Kemp,</b> you're right. I've {{been on the}} job now {{for nearly}} twenty years, an' if I don't know somethin' abaht it I ought.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It don't {{matter to}} me," [...] said <b>Mr.</b> <b>Kemp.</b> [...] "I {{can have a}} {{headache}} or a chill, or something of that sort, if you like. I don't want to go. It's no pleasure to me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why 'apparently'? I {{told you}} that we had got intimate, and I {{explained}} how. You can't stay shut up in an elevator half the night with anybody without getting to know him. I found <b>Mr.</b> <b>Kemp</b> very pleasant." ...|$|E
60|$|The news, communicated in halting accents by <b>Mr.</b> <b>Kemp,</b> was {{received}} with flattering dismay. Mrs. Bradshaw {{refused to believe}} her ears, {{and it was only}} after the information had been repeated and confirmed by Mr. Wright that she understood.|$|E
60|$|The day passed, and in {{the evening}} Mrs. Hodges, who had been {{attending}} to her own domestic duties, came downstairs again. <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Kemp</b> was on the bed sleeping.|$|R
50|$|From January 1885 Jeremiah Armitage, fruit grower, {{conducted}} the first postal receiving office at Eimeo. By 1891 this duty had {{been transferred to}} <b>Mrs</b> <b>Kemp</b> of the Sea View Hotel.|$|R
6000|$|... 'No one {{any good}} you be sure,' said <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Kemp.</b> 'I can't swaller these new people as are comin' in; the street ain't wot {{it was when}} I fust come.' ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>Mr.</b> <b>Kemp,</b> {{prompted}} by a nudge in the ribs, assented. [...] "It's wonderful how they took it all in about me," [...] he said; [...] "but I feel certain {{in my own mind}} that I ought to chuck some money about." ...|$|E
60|$|He came in {{next evening}} for another cigar, and heard all {{that there was}} {{to hear about the}} Empire. Mrs. Bradshaw would have treated him but coldly, but the {{innocent}} <b>Mr.</b> <b>Kemp,</b> charmed by his manner, paid him great attention.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's not for long," [...] said <b>Mr.</b> <b>Kemp.</b> [...] "I'm {{just going}} back {{for about a}} year to wind up things out there, and then I'm coming back to leave my old bones over here. George has very kindly offered to let me live with him." ...|$|E
60|$|This {{was a very}} {{discreet}} remark, but it set <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Kemp</b> in {{a whirlwind}} of passion. She raised herself and sat up in the bed, flourishing her clenched fist at her daughter.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Garn!' said <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Kemp,</b> in surprise. Then {{looking at}} her: 'Swop me bob, wot's up with yer? Why, yer cheeks is flushed, an' yer forehead--it is 'ot! Wot's {{the matter with}} yer, gal?' ...|$|R
60|$|<b>Mrs.</b> <b>Kemp</b> {{was frightened}} {{out of her}} wits. Going upstairs she woke the woman {{who lived on the}} floor above her. Without hesitating, the good lady put on a skirt and came down.|$|R
