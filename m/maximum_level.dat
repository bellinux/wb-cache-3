Materia have a limited number of uses before they must be recharged at one of the game's magic shops. Like party members, materia gain experience when used, and can be leveled up to a <b>maximum</b> <b>level</b> of nine. Characters can swap materia among themselves, with unequipped materia being used mid-battle for such things as healing party members, compensating for the limited amount of healing items.|$|E
5|$|There is no {{generally}} accepted <b>maximum</b> <b>level</b> of wind penetration. The limit {{for a particular}} grid {{will depend on the}} existing generating plants, pricing mechanisms, capacity for energy storage, demand management and other factors. An interconnected electric power grid will already include reserve generating and transmission capacity to allow for equipment failures. This reserve capacity can also serve to compensate for the varying power generation produced by wind stations. Studies have indicated that 20% of the total annual electrical energy consumption may be incorporated with minimal difficulty. These studies have been for locations with geographically dispersed wind farms, some degree of dispatchable energy or hydropower with storage capacity, demand management, and interconnected to a large grid area enabling the export of electric power when needed. Beyond the 20% level, there are few technical limits, but the economic implications become more significant. Electrical utilities continue to study the effects of large scale penetration of wind generation on system stability and economics.|$|E

5|$|In this installment, Link gains {{experience}} {{points to}} upgrade his attack, magic, and life by defeating enemies. This feature is exclusive to Zelda II {{in the game}} series. He can raise each of these attributes {{to a maximum of}} eight levels. Raising a life level will decrease the damage Link receives when hit, raising a magic level will decrease the magic points (MP) cost of spells, and raising an attack level will strengthen his sword's offensive power. Each attribute requires a different amount of experience to level up, with the life level requiring the least number of points to level and attack requiring the most. When enough points are acquired to raise an attribute, the player may choose to level up that attribute or to cancel and continue gaining experience points towards the next level in another attribute. Once Link has raised an attribute to the <b>maximum</b> <b>level</b> of eight, further advances in that attribute will earn Link an extra life, without advancing the attribute itself. Link begins the game with four Heart Containers and four Magic Containers and can acquire up to four more of each, permanently increasing his life points and magic points respectively. Other games in The Legend of Zelda series only allow Link to increase his strength through new weapons, items, and Heart Containers. Certain enemies drain Link's experience when they attack, but he will never lose a level once raised. When a game ends or is saved, the cartridge records Link's current ability levels and the number of experience points required for the next increase, but resets his accumulated points to zero.|$|E

25|$|Historically, flood {{irrigation}} {{was the most}} common method used, whereby large amounts of water are allowed to run across flat vineyard lands. While this method may have been an unwittingly preventive measure against the advance of phylloxera, it does not provide much control for the vineyard manager to limit yields and increase potential quality in the wine grapes. Subsequently, a method of furrow irrigation was developed whereby water is funneled into furrow channels that the vines are planted in. While providing a little more control, this method was still more suited to producing high yields. In the late 1990s, drip irrigation started to become more popular. Though expensive to install, this method provides for the <b>maximum</b> <b>level</b> of control by the vineyard manager to facilitate yield control and increase potential quality in the grape by leveraging water stress on the vine.|$|E
30|$|Sheep may {{be exposed}} to more highly {{contaminated}} soils because they often graze on areas near rivers or industrial sites, along streets, or on former industrial or military areas.

One possible reason for the lower levels in sheep meat might be the high accumulation of PCDD/Fs and some dl-PCB congeners in sheep liver. Prior to the amendment of the EU <b>maximum</b> <b>levels</b> for liver of terrestrial animals in 2013, over 90 % of sheep livers in Germany exceeded the EU <b>maximum</b> <b>levels</b> [55], and the Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) warned against consumption [56].
