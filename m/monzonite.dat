25|$|Most of the {{mountains}} and canyons in the Sierra Nevada are formed in granitic rocks. These rocks, such as granite, diorite and <b>monzonite,</b> formed when molten rock cooled far {{beneath the surface of}} the earth. The molten rock was a by-product of a geologic process known as subduction. Powerful forces in the earth forced the landmass under the waters of the Pacific Ocean beneath and below an advancing North American Continent. Super-hot water driven from the subjecting ocean floor migrated upward and melted rock as it went. This process took place during the Cretaceous Period, 100 million years ago. Granitic rocks have speckled salt and pepper appearance because they contain various minerals including quartz, feldspars and micas.

Although most of the mineralized island arc intrusions are quartz diorites, there are more potassic intrusions including quartz <b>monzonites</b> and syenites.

Copper and possibly zinc are enriched in the island arc intrusions. Chlorine contents are similar to accepted averages for craton intrusions, and fluorine is depleted in the quartz diorites and enriched in granodioritic island arc intrusions.

Cu-Au mineralization has scarcely been found in the regional Jurassic-Early Tertiary batholiths related to subduction of the Neo-Tethyan oceanic plate. Here, we report petrological, zircon geochronological and geochemical data for Late Cretaceous (similar to 90 Ma) intrusive rocks that contain Cu-Au mineralization from the Kelu area in the GBST. These rocks consist of quartz <b>monzonites</b> and diorites. The quartz <b>monzonites,</b> with SiO 2 of 58 - 59 wt. % and Na 2 O/K 2 O of 1. 1 - 1. 2, are geochemically similar to slab-derived adakites characterized by apparent depletions in heavy rare earth elements (e. g., Yb = 1. 4 - 1. 5 ppm) and Y (16 - 18 ppm) contents, positive Sr but negative Nb and Ti anomalies on multi-element variation diagrams. They have relatively low (Sr- 87 /Sr- 86) (i) (0. 7038 - 0. 7039) ratios and high epsilon(Nd) (t) (+ 3. 4 to + 3. 9) and in situ zircon epsilon(Hf) (t) (+ 9. 3 to + 15. 8) values. The diorites exhibit high Mg-numbers (0. 57 - 0. 61) similar to those of magnesian andesites, and have (Sr- 87 /Sr- 86) (i) (0. 7040 - 0. 7041) and epsilon(Nd) (t) (+ 3. 0 to + 4. 4) values {{similar to those of the}} quartz <b>monzonites.</b> We suggest that the quartz monzonitic magmas were most likely generated by partial melting of the subducted Neo-Tethyan basaltic oceanic crust and minor associated oceanic sediments, with subsequent melt-mantle interaction, and the dioritic magmas were mainly derived by the interaction between slab melts and mantle wedge peridotites, with fractionation of apatite and hornblende. These slab-derived adakitic magmas have high oxygen fugacity that may have facilitated Cu-Au mineralization. The close association of the Late Cretaceous adakitic intrusive rocks and Cu-Au mineralization in the Kelu area suggests that the arc magmatic rocks in the GBST may have higher potential than previously thought for Cu-Au mineralization.

50|$|Most {{surviving}} Archean {{rocks are}} metamorphic or igneous. Volcanic activity was considerably higher than today, with numerous lava eruptions, including unusual types such as komatiite.

40|$|An {{extensive}} {{study of}} the Triassic volcano-plutonic complex of Predazzo has been carried out. As it is known, Predazzo intrusion represent the main plutonic body of the magmatic activity which affect the South Alpine domain during the Triassic age. It is composed by a ring-shaped small intrusive bodies emplaced between 238 and 232 My (Laurenzi et al., 1997), partly coeval with the volcanic products which overlye the complex. Petrographyc and geochemical features, together with age relationships allow to depict a rather complicated tectono-magmatic evolution, resulting in several small magma pulses with different magmatic affinity injected {{in a short time}} gap. According to Visonà (1997) four main sequences were distinguished on the basis of silica saturation degree, mineral phases and compositions. They are: - a shoshonitic silica saturated series (M 1), - a shoshonitic silica oversaturated series (M 2), - a potassic-alkaline series (M 3) and - a probably calc-alkaline series made up only by the granites (G). M 1 represents {{the main part of the}} outer ring of the complex and is mainly constituted by monzo-gabbros and <b>monzonites,</b> with subordinate gabbros and pyroxenites and syenites. Diopsidic to augitic clinopiroxene is the most common phase, followed by olivine, Mg-horneblende and minor ortopiroxene, while plagioclase is the most abundant sialic phase, followed by K-feldspar and scarse quartz. It represents the most common series in the Dolomitic area as both intrusives (M. ti Monzoni, Cima Pape) and volcanics. M 2 is mainly represented by monzo-diorites, with minor quartz-monzonites and quartz-syenites. Clinopiroxene and amphibole, with similar composition to those of M 1, are common; quartz is more abundant in monzo-diorites, <b>monzonites</b> and syenites, coherently with he marked silica-oversaturation of the series. M 3 outcrops exclusively in the eastern part of the complex (Val di Viezzena). It is characterized by abundance of differentiated products (syenites), with subordinate monzo-gabbros and <b>monzonites,</b> all bearing nepheline. In this series clinopiroxene is salitic to aegirinaugitic in composition and amphibole varies from Mg-hastingsite to Fe-pargasite. The presence of titanite, apatite and garnet (rare) is peculiar. Calc-alkaline granites constitute the core of the complex. An “I Type” nature was proposed by Visonà, (1997) for these rocks, considered differentiated from calc-alkaline basic magmas; the presence of muscovite is related to secondary deuteric processes overimposed on primary biotite crystals. Differentiation processes were modelled using a mass-balance calculations. Results indicate that crystallization played a dominant role in the differentiation of the three series. On the basis of field relationship between the various lithotypes the temporal succession of the intrusion may be put forward: M 1 represent the oldest intrusion in the western and north-western part of the complex. It was followed by M 2 in the eastern and south-eastern part. A gradational contact between lavas, sills and the M 1 and M 2 intrusives suggests concomitant, or slightly older, volcanic episodes. The youngest intrusive event is represent by the granitic rocks, which are clearly intruded in M 1 and M 2 as well as in the volcanics. Granites, in turn, are cut by several K-lamprophyric dykes, which might be analogous to the M 3 parental magmas. The timing of M 3 intrusion remain still uncertain, since it cuts M 1 and M 2, but no relationship were found with the granites...|$|R
