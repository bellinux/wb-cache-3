Construction was commenced in July 1939 by the civil engineering company [...] "ing. J. Domanský". The planned budget was 5,552,400 crowns. Despite most civil engineering projects in Czechoslovakia being halted after the German invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941, in order that <b>material</b> <b>schedule</b> for them could be diverted to the Nazi war effort, {{the construction of the}} bridge continued, although it was halted after the assassination of Reinhard Heydrich, the Nazi overlord of Czechoslovakia. Under the Communist regime which came about at the end of World War II, construction resumed, even though the emphasis at the time was on heavy industry and railroads rather than on automobile travel.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to examine the ways by which {{construction}} material resources can be optimised towards sustainable material resource preservation. Material waste in construction contributes approximately 30 - 35 % of project cost; thus leading to material loss and project cost overruns. Lack of concern by Governments and developers globally and Nigeria in particular is continuously affecting the use of these resources materials. Questionnaire method has been used. To achieve the objectives of the research, the questionnaire was administered among Consultants (Architect, Quantity Surveyors and Builders) in Nigerian construction sector. A total of 70 questionnaires were administered to construction practitioners; 53 were returned giving a 75 % response rate. This was analysed using Descriptive Statistics. The findings reveal that selection of low quality products and inexperience of method are the major sources of material wastage at the design stage. Construction stage major sources of material wastage are design changes during construction and re-working due to incorrect use of material and labour. While at procurement stage the major source of materials waste are lack of possibility to order small quantity and waste encountered during loading/transportation. Finally, at the handling stage the major sources of material wastage are theft and inappropriate storage. The study also revealed that lack of adequate security in the country and inadequate knowledge of recycling are the main challenges that occur more frequently in resource management. The study found that the following factors should be considered for sustainable material resources optimisation and include, use of standard space product design, adoption of supply chain management, and developing of <b>material</b> <b>schedule</b> software will assist in reducing materials wastage. It recommends that better utilization of resources through adopting lean production and prefabricated component processes, use of appropriate equipment and specification, recycling/re-using of old materials for new construction projects will assist greatly in reducing visiting of base materials, hence leading to resource optimization and protection of the environment. Lastly, there is the need for policy establishment and implementation for resource optimisation for the Nigeria construction industry...|$|E

40|$|Emergency <b>materials</b> <b>scheduling</b> {{is one of}} the key {{links in}} the process and also is a {{complicated}} system engineering that is influenced by multitudinous factors. In order to improve the efficiency of emergency rescue, dynamic change of demand function for emergency materials was analyzed according to the characters of emergency <b>materials</b> <b>scheduling.</b> On this basis, optimization model of emergency <b>materials</b> <b>scheduling</b> have been built to minimize the total casualty losses when the demand doesn’t meet and to minimize the total cost which is from distribution center of emergency materials to the rescue point. Considering that the encoder mode of the different evolution and particle swarm optimization algorithm is similarity and the search capability of two types of algorithm is very strong, the Different Evolution (DE) optimization algorithm and Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm (PSO) are combined into an efficient hybrid algorithm (H-PD) to solve this problem. Finally, a case study has been carried out in order to testify validity of this model and its algorithm by using calculating and comparing analysis. The results show that the hybrid optimization algorithm above mentioned can gain smaller loss and larger cost than greedy algorithm, the improved simulated annealing optimization algorithm is reasonable. This model and its algorithm can well reflect the laws of things development and can be of practical and effective value in actual project...|$|R
