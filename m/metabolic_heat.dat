40|$|This study {{investigated}} the effects of hatchery shading, nest depth, and <b>metabolic</b> <b>heating</b> on the temperature of Chelonia mydas clutches incubated in hatcheries at Ma'Daerah, Terengganu, Malaysia. <b>Metabolic</b> <b>heating</b> {{was found to be}} the most influential factor on nest temperature; the number of completely developed eggs explained nearly half of the variation in mean nest temperature. The degree of hatchery shading (70 % vs. 100 %) and nest depth (50 vs. 75 cm) had little influence on nest temperatures, with mean nest temperatures between 28 ࠡnd 28. 6 àin the first third of incubation (before <b>metabolic</b> <b>heating</b> of the clutch began to have an effect). Nests at a depth of 75 cm had significantly lower daily temperature ranges than nests at a depth of 50 cm, but a maximum mean daily range of 0. 5 à(50 cm depth in 70 % shade hatchery) resulted in calculated constant temperature equivalents (CTE) being identical to observed mean nest temperatures. The results of this study indicate that, under current climatic conditions in this area, shading between 70 % and 100 % and nest depths between 50 and 75 cm will incubate green turtle clutches within the optimal temperature range for development. However, this information is site-specific and could vary significantly between locations due to the complex interaction of biological, chemical, and physical factors that influence sea turtle nest temperature.

5|$|The Earth {{experienced}} {{a number of}} changes during the time period megalodon existed which affected marine life. A cooling trend starting in the Oligocene 35 mya ultimately led to glaciation at the poles. Geological events changed currents and precipitation; among these were {{the closure of the}} Circumtropical Seaway between the Americas and through the Tethys Sea, contributing to the cooling of the oceans. The stalling of the Gulf Stream prevented nutrient-rich water from reaching major marine ecosystems, which may have negatively affected its food sources. As its range did not apparently extend into colder waters, megalodon may {{not have been able to}} retain a significant amount of <b>metabolic</b> <b>heat,</b> so its range was restricted to shrinking tropical waters. Fossil evidence confirms the absence of megalodon in regions around the world where water temperatures had significantly declined during the Pliocene. The largest fluctuation of sea levels in the Cenozoic era occurred in the Plio-Pleistocene, between around 5 mya to 12 thousand years ago (kya), due to the expansion of glaciers at the pole, which negatively impacted coastal environments, and may have contributed to its extinction along with those of several other marine megafaunal species. These oceanographic changes, in particular the sea level drops, may have restricted many of the suitable shallow warm-water nursery sites for megalodon, hindering reproduction. Nursery areas are pivotal for the survival of many shark species, in part because they protect juveniles from predation.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{feeding of}} pollinating dynastid-scarab beetles on nutritious tissue of Annonaceae flowers results in macroscopically visible gnawing marks on petals. In the present paper, we present and discuss {{examples}} of such gnawing marks on Annonaceae from the Cerrado and the Amazon Forest in Brazil. The localization of gnawing marks on the petals and the histochemistry of the nutritious tissues are emphasized. In some species, nutritious tissue is apparently distributed among all petals, while in other species it {{is more or less}} diffusely localized. There are also cases in which nutritious tissue occurs only on clearly localized regions of the inner petals. Petals of selected Amazon species were stained, and studied by light and scanning electron microscopy. The nutritious tissue consists of cells with mucilage-rich walls, which contain starch, lipids and/or tannins. Starch and lipids are not only energy-rich food for the beetles but are apparently also “fuel” for <b>metabolic</b> <b>heating</b> of the flowers, which is a further benefit for the pollinators inside the pollination chamber...|$|R
25|$|The carotid rete is a {{counter-current}} heat exchanging organ in some ungulates. The blood ascending the carotid arteries {{on its way}} to the brain, flows via {{a network}} of vessels where heat is discharged to the veins of cooler blood descending from the nasal passages. The carotid rete allows Thomson's gazelle to maintain its brain almost 3°C (5.4°F) cooler than the rest of the body, and therefore aids in tolerating bursts in <b>metabolic</b> <b>heat</b> production such as associated with outrunning cheetahs (during which the body temperature exceeds the maximum temperature at which the brain could function).|$|E
25|$|Researchers {{suggest that}} common {{ostriches}} also employ a ‘selective brain warming’ mechanism {{in response to}} cooler surrounding temperatures in the evenings. The brain was found to maintain a warmer temperature when compared to carotid arterial blood supply. Researchers hypothesize three mechanisms for this finding. They first suggest a possible increase in <b>metabolic</b> <b>heat</b> production within the brain tissue itself {{to compensate for the}} colder arterial blood arriving from the core. They also speculate that there is an overall decrease in cerebral blood flow to the brain. Finally, they suggest that warm venous blood perfusion at the ophthalmic rete facilitates warming of cerebral blood that supplies the hypothalamus. Further research will need to be done to find how this occurs.|$|E
25|$|Global warming of that {{magnitude}} {{would make}} {{most of the}} planet uninhabitable by humans. The human body generates about 100 W of <b>metabolic</b> <b>heat</b> that must be carried away to maintain a core body temperature near 37°C, which implies that sustained wet bulb temperatures above 35°C can result in lethal hyperthermia. Today, the summer temperature varies widely over the Earth's surface, but wet bulb temperature is more narrowly confined by the effect of humidity, with the most common value of approximately 26–27°C and the highest approximately of 31°C. A warming of 10–12°C would put most of today's world population in regions with a wetbulb temperature above 35°C. Given the 20°C warming that occurs with 4.8 times current CO2 levels, such a climate forcing would produce intolerable climatic conditions even if the true climate sensitivity is significantly less than the Russell sensitivity, or, if the Russell sensitivity is accurate, the CO2 forcing required to produce intolerable conditions for humans is less than this amount.|$|E

Spots of elevated temperature that were confined {{to the place of}} infection increased in intensity from 8 h before the onset of visible cell death, and remained detectable as a halo around the ongoing necrosis. Salicylic acid accumulates during the prenecrotic phase in TMV-infected tobacco and is known to induce stomatal closure in certain species. We show that the time course of SA accumulation correlates with the evolution of both localized thermal effect and stomatal closure. Since the contribution of leaf respiration is marginal, we concluded that the thermal effect results predominantly from localized, SA-induced stomatal closure. The presymptomatic temperature increase could be of general significance in incompatible plant-pathogen interactions...|$|R

Measurements of the bill sizes of several species of American sparrows found in salt marshes along the North American coastlines show a strong correlation with summer temperatures recorded in the locations where the sparrows breed; latitude alone showed a much weaker correlation. By dumping excess heat through their bills, the sparrows are able to avoid the water loss which would be required by evaporative cooling—an important benefit in a windy habitat where freshwater is scarce.
