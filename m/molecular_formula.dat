At standard temperature and pressure, hydrogen is a colorless, odorless, tasteless, non-toxic, nonmetallic, highly combustible diatomic gas with the <b>molecular</b> <b>formula</b> H2. Since hydrogen readily forms covalent compounds with most nonmetallic elements, most of the hydrogen on Earth exists in molecular forms such as water or organic compounds. Hydrogen plays a particularly important role in acid–base reactions because most acid-base reactions involve the exchange of protons between soluble molecules. In ionic compounds, hydrogen can {{take the form of}} a negative charge (i.e., anion) when it is known as a hydride, or as a positively charged (i.e., cation) species denoted by the symbol H+. The hydrogen cation is written as though composed of a bare proton, but in reality, hydrogen cations in ionic compounds are always more complex. As the only neutral atom for which the Schrödinger equation can be solved analytically, study of the energetics and bonding of the hydrogen atom has played a key role in the development of quantum mechanics.|$|E

Duplicate dark controls were placed alongside the irradiated samples. After 28 days, samples were extensively photo-degraded based upon colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) photo-bleaching (> 95 %). Samples were solid phase extracted using PPL resin to isolate, concentrate and desalt the dissolved organic matter (DOM) in the samples. Ultrahigh resolution electrospray ionization Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FTICR-MS) enabled 3024 <b>molecular</b> <b>formulas</b> to be identified in the dark control. Photo-degradation decreased molecular diversity, with 2402 <b>formulas</b> assigned post-irradiation. <b>Molecular</b> <b>formulas</b> were classified based upon their photo-lability as 1) photo-resistant; 2) photo-labile; and, 3) photo-produced.

25|$|In organic chemistry, Carnelley's Rule, {{established}} in 1882 by Thomas Carnelley, states that high molecular symmetry {{is associated with}} high melting point. Carnelley based his rule on examination of 15,000 chemical compounds. For example, for three structural isomers with <b>molecular</b> <b>formula</b> C5H12 the melting point increases in the series isopentane −160°C (113 K) n-pentane −129.8°C (143 K) and neopentane −16.4°C (256.8 K). Likewise in xylenes and also dichlorobenzenes the melting point increases in the order meta, ortho and then para. Pyridine has a lower symmetry than benzene hence its lower melting point but the melting point again increases with diazine and triazines. Many cage-like compounds like adamantane and cubane with high symmetry have relatively high melting points.|$|E
25|$|Another, easier {{equation}} {{that can}} be applied to get the correct <b>molecular</b> <b>formula</b> of the CFC/R/Freon class compounds is this to take the numbering and add 90 to it. The resulting value will give the number of carbons as the first numeral, the second numeral gives the number of hydrogen atoms, and the third numeral gives the number of fluorine atoms. The rest of the unaccounted carbon bonds are occupied by chlorine atoms. The value of this equation is always a three figure number. An easy example is that of CFC-12, which gives: 90+12=102 -> 1 carbon, 0 hydrogens, 2 fluorine atoms, and hence 2 chlorine atoms resulting in CCl2F2. The main advantage of this method of deducing the molecular composition in comparison with the method described in the paragraph above is that it gives the number of carbon atoms of the molecule.|$|E

Plant cellulose, which makes up the cell walls of most plants, is a tough, mesh-like bulkwork in which cellulose fibrils are the primary architectural elements. While bacterial cellulose has the same <b>molecular</b> <b>formula</b> as plant cellulose, it has significantly different macromolecular properties and characteristics. In general, microbial cellulose is more chemically pure, containing no hemicellulose or lignin, has a higher water holding capacity and hydrophilicity, greater tensile strength resulting from a larger amount of polymerization, ultrafine network architecture. Furthermore, bacterial cellulose can be produced on a variety of substrates and can be grown to virtually any shape due to the high moldability during formation. Additionally, bacterial cellulose has a more crystalline structure compared to plant cellulose and forms characteristic ribbon-like microfibrils. A hallmark of microbial cellulose, these thin microfibrils are significantly smaller than those in plant cellulose, making bacterial cellulose much more porous.|$|E
