30|$|However, {{previous}} studies of call blocking and dropping performance with CAC have not considered adapting <b>multiservices</b> in cellular systems. Mobile cellular systems can now support multiple call services, such as voice and video calls. The bandwidth of these call services is usually fixed. If the bandwidth of these call services can be adapted, the CAC used by such adaptive multirate (AMR) services may reduce the call blocking and dropping probabilities, thereby increasing cellular system utilization to meet a guaranteed level of QoS. For example, G. 722 can change the bandwidth of voice call services while Multiple Description Coding (MDC) can vary the bandwidth of video call services.|$|R

The method used adaptive coding of handover connection service requests and the parameter adjustment of CAC policy functions in a multi-service cellular system.

Our study considered the mobility and arrival (departure) rate of user connection requests, the capacity of each cell, CAC policy, the adaptive coding probability of the “dual mode full-rate service type”, and blocking (dropping) probabilities of connection requests for each service. An efficient method is proposed to derive a better connection-level QoS, which was verified by performance simulations. The {{results indicate that the}} reservation policy for the new connection requests threshold ψ and the adaptive coding threshold σ were effective in providing a better connection-level QoS for new and handover calls.
