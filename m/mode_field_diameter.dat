Power levels have increased from the 1kW regimes due to the advancements in components as well as the Yb-doped fibers. Fabrication of Low NA, Large Mode Area fibers enable achievement of near perfect beam qualities (M2<1.1) at power levels of 1.5 kW to greater than 2 kW at ~1064 nm in a broadband configuration. Ytterbium-doped LMA fibers also have the advantages of a larger <b>mode</b> <b>field</b> <b>diameter,</b> which negates the impacts of nonlinear effects such as stimulated Brillouin scattering and stimulated Raman scattering, which limit the achievement of higher power levels, and provide a distinct advantage over single mode ytterbium-doped fibers.|$|E

5000|$|Optical waveguides {{find their}} most {{important}} application in photonics. Configuring the waveguides in 3D space provides integration between electronic components on a chip and optical fibers. Such waveguides may be designed for a single mode propagation of infrared light at telecommunication wavelengths, and configured to deliver optical signal between input and output locations with very low loss. [...] One of the methods for constructing such waveguides utilizes photorefractive effect in transparent materials. An increase in the refractive index of a material may be induced by nonlinear absorption of pulsed laser light. In order maximize the increase of the refractive index, a very short (typically femtosecond) laser pulses are used, and focused with a high NA microscope objective. By translating the focal spot through a bulk transparent material the waveguides can be directly written. A variation of this method uses a low NA microscope objective and translates the focal spot along the beam axis. This improves the overlap between the focused laser beam and the photorefractive material, thus reducing power needed from the laser.When transparent material is exposed to an unfocused laser beam of sufficient brightness to initiate photorefractive effect, the waveguides may start forming on their own {{as a result of}} an accumulated self-focusing. The formation of such waveguides leads to a breakup of the laser beam. Continued exposure results in a buildup of the refractive index towards the centerline of each waveguide, and collapse of the <b>mode</b> <b>field</b> <b>diameter</b> of the propagating light. Such waveguides remain permanently in the glass and can be photographed off-line (see the picture on the right).|$|E

40|$|In {{the last}} years a {{dramatic}} increase of the output power of rare-earth-doped fiber lasers and amplifiers with diffraction limited beam quality has been observed. These demonstrates impressively that fiber lasers and amplifiers are an attractive and power scalable solid-state laser concept. The main limiting factors for the laser output power are the damage of the fiber ends, heating of the fiber due to the quantum defect and nonlinear effects. To overcome these problems, an increasing of the core diameter and keeping the fiber single mode, by using solid core step-index large-mode-area fibers, allow the power scaling beyond 1 kW at diffraction limited beam quality.
