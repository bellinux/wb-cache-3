This paper describes the derivation of the rank constraint for matching using the rank transform Previous work has shown that this constraint was capable of resolving ambiguous matches thereby improving match reliability A new matching algorithm incorporating this constraint was also proposed. This paper extends on this previous work by proposing a matching algorithm which uses a dimensional <b>match</b> <b>surface</b> in which the match score is computed for every possible template and match window combination. The principal advantage of this algorithm is that the use of the <b>match</b> <b>surface</b> enforces the left�right consistency and uniqueness constraints thus improving the algorithms ability to remove invalid matches Experimental results for a number of test stereo pairs show that the new algorithm is capable of identifying and removing a large number of in incorrect matches particularly in the case of occlusion...|$|E

40|$|The {{clinical}} performance of three posterior composites and two amalgams was evaluated over 3 years. Three hundred and nine composites and 200 amalgams were reviewed at the 3 -year recall. The following parameters were assessed: fractures, gingival condition, interproximal contacts, marginal adaptation, staining and colour match. Although {{there was no}} significant difference in the overall failure rate between the two types of material, there was a significantly higher incidence of fracture in the amalgam restorations. The amalgam failures were exclusively mechanical, whereas those affecting composites also included failures that were more biological in nature. A significantly higher proportion of the Class II composites failed to achieve an adequate approximal contact, but this was not reflected in a more adverse gingival response.

40|$|Abstract—Three {{dimensional}} <b>surface</b> <b>matching</b> is {{an important}} problem in computer vision. The process of <b>surface</b> <b>matching</b> is to match similar regions or correspondences across multiple surfaces with unknown relative poses. Many surface descriptors for finding correspondences have been proposed. However, most of these approaches {{have been used in}} triangle mesh surfaces. In this paper, a local surface descriptor constituting moving least square (MLS) surface representation, differential angle calculation, and Zernike moments is proposed to find correspondences in unconstraint point set surfaces. The MLS projection is applied to generate a differential angle map described the geometric information. Then, Zernike moments are used to provide surface descriptors with rotation invariant. In addition, a congruent consistency method is proposed to find the reliable correspondences. To conclude, the experimental results show that the approach outperforms the original spin image method [2], and has slightly better performance than a modified spin image method presented in this paper. Moreover, the proposed approach has good matching performance both in terms of <b>matching</b> <b>surface</b> by using variety of descriptor size or <b>matching</b> <b>surface</b> among different resolutions.

40|$|Under typical viewing conditions, {{we find it}} easy to {{distinguish}} between different materials, such as metal, plastic, and paper. Recognizing materials from their surface reflectance properties (such as lightness and gloss) is a nontrivial accomplishment because of confounding effects of illumination. However, if subjects have tacit knowledge of the statistics of illumination encountered in the real world, then it is possible to reject unlikely image interpretations, and thus to estimate surface reflectance even when the precise illumination is unknown. A surface reflectance matching task was used to measure the accuracy of human surface reflectance estimation. The results of the matching task demonstrate that subjects can <b>match</b> <b>surface</b> reflectance properties reliably and accurately in the absence of context, as long as the illumination is realistic. Matching performance declines when the illumination statistics are not representative of the real world. Together these findings suggest that subjects do use stored assumptions about the statistics of real-world illumination to estimate surface reflectance. Systematic manipulations of pixel and wavelet properties of illuminations reveal that the visual system’s assumptions about illumination are of intermediate complexity (e. g., presence of edges and bright light sources), rather than of high complexity (e. g., presence of recognizable objects in the environment) ...|$|E

40|$|Mutual {{information}} (MI) {{has shown}} promise {{as an effective}} stereo matching measure for images affected by radiometric distortion. This {{is due to the}} robustness of MI against changes in illumination. However, MI-based approaches are particularly prone to the generation of false matches due to the small statistical power of the matching windows. Consequently, most previous MI approaches utilise large matching windows which smooth the estimated disparity field. This paper proposes extensions to MI-based stereo matching in order to increase the robustness of the algorithm. Firstly, prior probabilities are incorporated into the MI measure in order to considerably increase the statistical power of the matching windows. These prior probabilities, which are calculated from the global joint histogram between the stereo pair, are tuned to a two level hierarchical approach. A 2 D <b>match</b> <b>surface,</b> in which the match score is computed for every possible combination of template and matching window, is also utilised. This enforces left-right consistency and uniqueness constraints. These additions to MI-based stereo matching significantly enhance the algorithm’s ability to detect correct matches while decreasing computation time and improving the accuracy. Results show that the MI measure does not perform quite as well for standard stereo pairs when compared to traditional areabased metrics. However, the MI approach is far superior when matching across multi-spectra stereo pairs...|$|E

Digital images and scanning electron microscope were used to assess microleakage and adaptation ability. Sample for clinical study consisted of 60 children, aged 6 - 8 years, with high caries risk, divided in two groups according to the sealant material.

From January 2012 to February 2013, a total of 29 patients (eight men, 21 women; mean age, 24 ± 5 years) received 29 pairs of restorations using both SC (Filtek Silorane, 3 M ESPE) and NHC (Filtek Z 550, 3 M ESPE) materials. Patients were followed until February 2015. One operator performed all restorations using the corresponding adhesive resins according to the manufacturers' instructions.

Materials and MethodsA total of 60 fixed partial dentures were made with the experimental version of SR Adoro veneering composite. Half had a Vectris framework, and the other half gold alloy. Evaluation criteria were: shade <b>match,</b> <b>surface</b> texture, marginal shoulder, marginal gap, fracture, recurrent caries, retention, and abutment tooth hypersensitivity. The fixed partial dentures were rated as: R (ideal), S (acceptable) or T/V (unacceptable). Statistical analysis was performed using Mann-Whitney and Wilcoxon tests. ResultsComparison between Baseline and 1 -Year in the Adoro/Gold group showed no change in color match. A statistical significant degradation in surface texture (p= 0. 007), marginal shoulder (p= 0. 014), marginal gap (p= 0. 034), and fracture (p= 0. 025) was found. All changes were minor from R to S except in the criteria marginal gap where 1 bridge was rated T/V, and fracture with 5 T/V ratings. Since fractures consisted in loss of small parts of veneering composite, 4 of these fixed partial dentures remained in service and only 1 was replaced. In Adoro/Vectris group only surface texture degradation was statistically significant (p= 0. 001). Nevertheless, SR Adoro maintained a clinically acceptable surface texture.

40|$|The {{lithosphere}} {{is commonly}} {{defined as the}} outermost rigid layer of the Earth, including the crust and the uppermost part of the mantle. It forms the rigid 'plate' in plate tectonic theory. To study its large-scale structure globally, I use fundamental mode surface waves with a period range between 25 s and 200 s. A large dataset including all long period seismograms publicly available for earthquakes with magnitudes larger than Mw= 5. 5 between 1977 and 2007 has been assembled. To analyze such a large dataset, an efficient measurement method has been developed based on a cluster analysis technique to measure the velocity and amplitude variations of the surface wave packages. These measurements are then inverted for a self- consistent global dispersion model for both Rayleigh and Love waves, which provides the basic input data for constraining the lithospheric structure at high resolution. These maps of surface wave phase/group velocities <b>match</b> <b>surface</b> tectonics very well. Slow anomalies are found beneath orogenic zones and other regions with thick crust, e. g. the Himalayas and Andes. The Basin and Range province in North America, mid-ocean ridges, and back-arc basins also show up as slow anomalies. Cratons {{can be seen in}} the low frequency maps as regions of anomalously high velocities. I also find that azimuthal anisotropy needs to be included in order to obtain reliable isotropic velocity variations for Rayleigh waves, and the uncertainties in earthquake locations can affect the resulting azimuthal anisotropy. In addition, I apply finite-frequency theory to account for the focusing- defocusing effect when modeling the amplitude data and present a set of 2 D global attenuation maps for Rayleigh waves. The products from this thesis are expected to find wide use by the seismological and the broader geophysical community.

40|$|Amenthes Rupes is a 380 km-long lobate fault scarp {{located in}} the eastern {{hemisphere}} of Mars near the dichotomy boundary. The scarp is marked by about 1 km of vertical separation across a northeast dipping thrust fault (top to the SW) and offsets heavily-cratered terrain of Late Noachian age, the visible portion of which was in place by 3. 92 Ga and the buried portion in place between 4. 08 and 4. 27 Ga. The timing of scarp formation is difficult to closely constrain. Previous geologic mapping shows that near {{the northern end of}} Amenthes Rupes, Hesperian age basalts terminate at the scarp, suggesting that fault slip predated the emplacement of these flows at 3. 69 to 3. 9 Ga. Maxwell and McGill also suggest the faulting ceased before the final emplacement of the Late Hesperian lavas on Isidis Planitia. The trend of the faults at Amenthes, like many thrust faults at the dichotomy boundary, parallels the boundary itself. Schultz and Watters used a dislocation modeling program to <b>match</b> <b>surface</b> topography and vertical offset of the scarp at Amenthes Rupes, varying the dip and depth of faulting, assuming a slip of 1. 5 km on the fault. They modeled faulting below Amenthes Rupes as having a dip of between 25 and 30 degrees and a depth of 25 to 35 km, based on the best match to topography. Assuming a 25 degree dip and surface measurements of vertical offset of between 0. 3 and 1. 2 km, Watters later estimated the maximum displacement on the Amenthes Rupes fault to be 2. 90 km. However, these studies did not determine the geometry of the thrust using quantitative constraints that included shortening estimates. Amenthes Rupes deforms large preexisting impact craters. We use these craters to constrain shortening across the scarp and combine this with vertical separation to infer fault geometry. Fault dip was also estimated using measurements of scarp morphology.

40|$|Reports of erroneously old 14 C {{dates for}} modern Antarctic {{materials}} have thrown doubt into 14 C chronologies. The carbon reservoir effect purported {{to exist in}} Quaternary lacustrine sediments of the McMurdo Dry Valleys was investigated by studying 14 C distribution, and testing alternate dating techniques. Our {{results show that the}} carbon reservoir effect is not pervasive. Stream and near-shore microbial mats and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) in the surface waters of Lake Fryxell are in equilibrium with modern 14 CO 2. The surface waters of Lake Hoare and Lake Bonney, however, have DIC 14 C ages of 1650 and 2080 yr B. P., respectively. These older age estimates are suggested to be due to the direct input of large amounts of glacial melt with relict DIC. On the other hand, Lake Fryxell receives only a minor component of its inflow directly from a glacier, while a large component must travel long distances in numerous shallow ephemeral streams after leaving local valley glaciers. This mode of melt-water input allows the water to equilibrate with modern CO 2 before entering the lake. Bottom-water 14 C ages for Lake Hoare closely <b>match</b> <b>surface</b> sediment ages, supporting the widely published period ∼ 1200 yr B. P. (after a 1650 yr reservoir correction) when most dry valley lakes apparently evaporated to small brine ponds and/or disappeared completely. Lake Bonney bottom-water is ∼ 8000 yr B. P. Carbon dating is shown to be a viable technique for lake edge deposits, and possibly lake bottom deposits where a correction to the sediment surface age can be obtained. However, we conclude that deep-water paleolake deposits can not be reliably dated using 14 C alone because of an inability to determine the age of the reservoir correction (i. e. accounting for the initial carbon reservoir, plus the age of the bottom water). A suite of alternative and complimentary dating techniques were tested on modern and late Holocene lacustrine deposits. These include thermoluminescence (TL), 210 Pb, 137 Cs, and paleomagnetism. Of these techniques, TL (or the more sensitive optically stimulated luminescence) holds the most promise for correcting lake sediment 14 C ages. TL dating of the modern Lake Hoare sediments showed an ∼ 1000 yr relict signal. This signal is unaffected by the age of the lake water. Both 210 Pb and 137 Cs occurred in very low levels in the sediments and {{do not appear to be}} viable dating techniques for the perennially ice-covered lakes of the McMurdo Dry Valleys.

40|$|Image {{registration}} {{is a fundamental}} problem {{that can be found}} in a diverse range of fields within the research community. It is used in areas such as engineering, science, medicine, robotics, computer vision and image processing, which often require the process of developing a spatial mapping between sets of data. Registration plays a crucial role in the medical imaging field where continual advances in imaging modalities, including MRI, CT and PET, allow the generation of 3 D images that explicitly outline detailed in vivo information of not only human anatomy, but also human function. Mutual Information (MI) is a popular entropy-based similarity measure which has found use in a large number of image registration applications. Stemming from information theory, this measure generally outperforms most other intensity-based measures in multimodal applications as it does not assume the existence of any specific relationship between image intensities. It only assumes a statistical dependence. The basic concept behind any approach using MI is to find a transformation, which when applied to an image, will maximise the MI between two images. This thesis presents research using MI in three major topics encompassed by the computer vision and medical imaging field: rigid image registration, stereo vision, and non-rigid image registration. In the rigid domain, a novel gradient-based registration algorithm (MIGH) is proposed that uses Parzen windows to estimate image density functions and Gauss-Hermite quadrature to estimate the image entropies. The use of this quadrature technique provides an effective and efficient way of estimating entropy while bypassing the need to draw a second sample of image intensities (a procedure required in previous Parzen-based MI registration approaches). It is possible to achieve identical results with the MIGH algorithm when compared to current state of the art MI-based techniques. These results are achieved using half the previously required sample sizes, thus doubling the statistical power of the registration algorithm. Furthermore, the MIGH technique improves algorithm complexity by up to an order of N, where N represents the number of samples extracted from the images. In stereo vision, a popular passive method of depth perception, new extensions have been pro- posed in order to increase the robustness of MI-based stereo matching algorithms. Firstly, prior probabilities are incorporated into the MI measure to considerably increase the statistical power of the matching windows. The statistical power, directly related to the number of samples, can become too low when small matching windows are utilised. These priors, which are calculated from the global joint histogram, are tuned to a two level hierarchical approach. A 2 D <b>match</b> <b>surface,</b> in which the match score is computed for every possible combination of template and matching windows, is also utilised to enforce left-right consistency and uniqueness constraints. These additions to MI-based stereo matching significantly enhance the algorithms ability to detect correct matches while decreasing computation time and improving the accuracy, particularly when matching across multi-spectra stereo pairs. MI has also recently found use in the non-rigid domain due to a need to compute multimodal non-rigid transformations. The viscous fluid algorithm is perhaps the best method for re- covering large local mis-registrations between two images. However, this model can only be used on images from the same modality as it assumes similar intensity values between images. Consequently, a hybrid MI-Fluid algorithm is proposed to compute a multimodal non-rigid registration technique. MI is incorporated via the use of a block matching procedure to generate a sparse deformation field which drives the viscous fluid algorithm, This algorithm is also compared to two other popular local registration techniques, namely Gaussian convolution and the thin-plate spline warp, and is shown to produce comparable results. An improved block matching procedure is also proposed whereby a Reversible Jump Markov Chain Monte Carlo (RJMCMC) sampler is used to optimally locate grid points of interest. These grid points have a larger concentration in regions of high information and a lower concentration in regions of small information. Previous methods utilise only a uniform distribution of grid points throughout the image...|$|E

Existing approaches, which attempt to match two meshes directly in 3 D, can be cumbersome to implement and it is often hard to produce accurate results in {{a reasonable amount of}} time. In this paper, we present a new variational method for <b>matching</b> <b>surfaces</b> that addresses these issues. Instead of <b>matching</b> two <b>surfaces</b> directly in 3 D, we apply well-established matching methods from image processing in the parameter domains of the <b>surfaces.</b> A <b>matching</b> energy is introduced that can depend on curvature, feature demarcations or surface textures, and a regularization energy controls length and area changes in the induced non-rigid deformation between the two surfaces.

We tackle this problem by means of robust <b>surface</b> <b>matching.</b> In presence of local deformation, conventional <b>surface</b> <b>matching</b> algorithm with least square condition would fail. Efforts have been made by some researches to robustify the <b>surface</b> <b>matching</b> algorithm using M-estimators. We use least median of squares estimator and data snooping technique to robustify the <b>surface</b> <b>matching</b> algorithm and use a M-estimator to improve the efficiency of least median of squares estimator. Evaluation and comparison of these methods are carried out using simulative data. The result shows robust matching using least median of squares estimator can detect a local deformation that covers up to 50 percents of the surface and very small deformation can detected and it is not sensitive to position of deformation, which is much superior to other methods of robustifying <b>surface</b> <b>matching.</b> Department of Land Surveying and Geo-InformaticsRefereed conference pape...|$|R
