This was widely thought to be the case well before 1988, and the wildfires of that year drove the conclusion home.

500|$|... "Sexual Healing" [...] {{suggests}} celebrities {{involved in}} sexual scandals {{should not be}} forced to undergo rehabilitation and public acts of contrition. The scene in which the celebrities start shaking and dancing, proclaiming [...] "Look, the sex addiction is leaving my body!", demonstrates the insincerity and ridiculousness of these public steps. The episode also mocked the measures used to diagnose and treat sexual addiction in the United States. This is particularly prevalent when Kenny, Kyle and Butters are misdiagnosed with sexual addiction based on an inaccurate test of simply presenting an image of a naked woman to them and testing whether they could identify a handkerchief in the woman's hand and specify its color. The rehabilitation courses themselves are also mocked as ineffective and unnecessary, particularly because the <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>lesson</b> taught in them is how to avoid getting caught.|$|E
500|$|At Regent's Park David {{made little}} {{professional}} progress. The company was distinguished, headed by Nigel Playfair and Jack Hawkins, and, in the leading female roles, Anna Neagle and Margaretta Scott. David {{was restricted to}} bit parts. Among her colleagues in the company was an actor nine years her senior, Charles Gibson Cowan. His disregard for social conventions appealed strongly to her, and she also found him sexually irresistible. His being married did not daunt either of them, and they began an affair that outlasted her stage career. According to an interview with Chaney, [...] "Cowan was the ultimate outsider. He was working class, left wing, Jewish, an actor, a pickpocket, a vagabond, who lived in caves in Hastings for a time. Her mother called him a 'pacifist worm'. He was a sexual presence, and slept with anything that moved." [...] David's mother strongly disapproved, and tried {{to put a stop}} to the affair. She arranged for her daughter to spend several weeks holidaying with family and friends in Malta in the first half of 1936 and in Egypt later in the same year, but in her 1999 biography Artemis Cooper comments that David's lengthy absence failed to detach her from her involvement with Cowan. During her stay in Malta, David was able to spend time learning from her hostess's cook, Angela, who was happy to pass on her expertise. Although she could produce elaborate grand dinners when required, the <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>lesson</b> she taught David was to work day in, day out, with all available ingredients, showing her how to make an old bird or a stringy piece of meat into a good dish.|$|E

Other Reagan-era officials, however, have been more supportive of the film. Michael Johns, the former foreign policy analyst at The Heritage Foundation and White House speechwriter to President George H. W.

60|$|That {{there is}} no 'effect of light' here arrived at, I beg you at once to observe as a <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>lesson.</b> The subject is St. Francis {{challenging}} the Soldan's Magi,--fire-worshippers--to pass with him through the fire, which is blazing red at his feet. It is so hot that the two Magi {{on the other side}} of the throne shield their faces. But it is represented simply as a red mass of writhing forms of flame; and casts no firelight whatever. There is no ruby colour on anybody's nose: there are no black shadows under anybody's chin; there are no Rembrandtesque gradations of gloom, or glitterings of sword-hilt and armour.|$|E
6000|$|Now, observe, first, I do {{not mean}} by {{luxuriance}} of ornament, quantity of ornament. In the best Gothic in the world there is hardly an inch of stone left unsculptured. But I mean that character of extravagance in the ornament itself which shows that it was addressed to jaded faculties; a violence and coarseness in curvature, a depth of shadow, a lusciousness in arrangement of line, evidently arising out of an incapability of feeling the true beauty of chaste form and restrained power. I do not know any character of design which may be more easily recognized at a glance than this over-lusciousness; and yet {{it seems to me}} that at the present day there is nothing so little understood as the essential difference between chasteness and extravagance, whether in color, shade, or lines. We speak loosely and inaccurately of [...] "overcharged" [...] ornament, with an obscure feeling that there is indeed something in visible Form which is correspondent to Intemperance in moral habits; but without any distinct detection of the character which offends us, far less with any understanding of the <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>lesson</b> which there can be no doubt was intended to be conveyed by the universality of this ornamental law.|$|E

60|$|Suppose for instance, a study card, {{like the}} one {{described}} in a preceding chapter, is made, so as to mark the time of recess and of study. The teacher near the close of recess, is sitting {{with a group of}} his pupils around him, telling them some story. They are all interested, and they see he is interested. He looks at his watch, and shows by his manner, that he is desirous of finishing what he is saying, but that he knows that the striking of the bell will cut short his story. Perhaps he says not a word about it, but his pupils see that he is submitting to the control which is placed over them: and when the card goes up, and he stops instantly {{in the middle of his}} sentence, and rises with the rest, each one to go to his own place, to engage at once in their several duties, he teaches them a <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>lesson,</b> and in the most effectual way.
