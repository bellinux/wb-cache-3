2500|$|One of {{the main}} reasons why Yorkshire were {{prepared}} to offer the captaincy to Sutcliffe in 1927 was because he was not perceived to be the typical professional. Sutcliffe set high standards for himself and was determined to get on in life, as well as cricket, and <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>money.</b> Wally Hammond, who eventually did turn amateur and captained England, was another example. Sutcliffe took pains to modify his accent and, as Neville Cardus commented, Sutcliffe eventually spoke [...] "not with the accents of Yorkshire but of Teddington". Cardus remarked on the Savile Row suits worn by Sutcliffe and Hammond: [...] "The county cricketer has in certain instances become a man of bourgeois profession". [...] But Bill Bowes, an ex-grammar school boy who had benefited from educational reforms that were unavailable to Sutcliffe and the older professionals, regarded Sutcliffe as a hero. Writing about Sutcliffe, Bowes pointed out that Sutcliffe was [...] "no ordinary man" [...] and stressed that [...] "professionalism was very important to him".|$|E

2500|$|Licata's successor, Dominic Brooklier, was {{initially}} able {{to stabilize the}} family's businesses, but later endured considerable damage done by FBI informants. Brooklier was able to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> in pornography, extortion, and drugs, but wasn't able to take back control of the independent bookmaking rackets in Los Angeles. The Last Mafioso described several instances during {{the time when the}} family would shake down people in the porn industry. These men would then pay a fee to their Mafia backers, usually on the East Coast, to set things straight. Once they paid, the Mafia backers would secretly split the money with the L.A. family. Brooklier also ordered the death of Frank Bompensiero for his growing criticism of the family, and later finding evidence that he was cooperating with the FBI. When Brooklier was sentenced to a short prison stint along with his underboss Samuel Sciortino in 1975, Jimmy Fratianno transferred back to the L.A. family and was named acting boss. Fratianno took this position to heart, traveling across the country making connections and deals. Fratianno's goal was to bring back the ailing families stature and reputation amongst the Mafia. Since Jack Dragna's death, Los Angeles was starting to be seen as an [...] "open city" [...] where any family could do business, but Fratianno hoped that by restoring the ailing family he'd be a candidate to officially run the family even when Brooklier was released. However, Brooklier quickly took back control of the family after his release and Fratianno was left back to being a low level soldier.|$|E
