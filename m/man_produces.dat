60|$|There is {{a little}} unpretending church not far from Phillimore Gardens, in which a little unpretending clergyman preaches every Sunday out of a very shabby pulpit. It lies in Castle Lane, which is a narrow by-way, and the great crowd of church-goers ebbs and flows within a hundred yards of it, but none know of its existence, for it has never risen to the dignity of a spire, and the bell is so very {{diminutive}} that the average muffin <b>man</b> <b>produces</b> quite as much noise. Hence, {{with the exception of}} some few families who have chanced to find their way there, and have been so pleased with their spiritual welcome that they have returned, there is a poor and fluctuating congregation. So scanty is it that the struggling incumbent could very well weep when he has spent the week in polishing and strengthening his sermon, and then finds upon the Sunday how very scanty is the audience to whom it is to be addressed.|$|E

In any case, and under any fashion, the great <b>man</b> <b>produces</b> beauty, terror, and mirth, and the little man produces----" [...] We know what he produces, and though his books may be praised as if the little man were a Sophocles up to date, he and his works are a weariness to think upon. In them is neither beauty, mirth, nor terror, except the terror of illimitable ennui.|$|E

50|$|The human {{ejaculate}} {{is mostly}} composed of water. 96 to 98% of semen is water. One way {{of ensuring that}} a <b>man</b> <b>produces</b> more ejaculate is to drink more liquids. Men also produce more seminal fluid after lengthy sexual stimulation and arousal. Reducing the frequency of sex and masturbation helps increase semen volume. Sexually transmitted diseases also affect the production of semen. Men who are infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) produce lower semen volume.|$|E
50|$|Poor semen {{quality is}} {{measured}} {{not only by}} the number of sperm a <b>man</b> <b>produces</b> but also by how effective the sperm is at fertilising an egg. The motility and shape of the sperm are important for this role. A man with poor semen quality will often present with fertility problems which is defined as a couple trying to conceive for over 1 year with no success. Diagnosis can be made from semen analysis, taking a sample of the man’s semen and running tests to count numbers and quality of the individual sperm.|$|E

50|$|In Yawuru cosmology, the {{primordial}} time and its world (bugarrigarra) is still present in its creative force, governing social relations, informing {{the way one}} interacts with the maritime and continental landscape within their traditional territory, and securing the well-being (liyan) of the community (ngarrungunil). The traditional kinship structure, typical also of other contiguous tribal {{groups such as the}} Karajarri, Nyikina and Mangala, is fourfold, consisting of the Banaga and the Burungu, the Garimba and the Barrjarri, the first two in each case form the binary unit of optimal marriage choice. Children assume their kin-tribal identity through the mother. Thus, a child born to a Banaga father and a Burungu woman is classified as Barrjarri, while a Garimba woman married to a Barrjarri <b>man</b> <b>produces</b> Banaga offspring.|$|E
50|$|An old man {{sits alone}} at a large table in an earthen-floored room, {{escaping}} {{the heat of the}} day. He drinks saké and converses enigmatically with the proprietress. When he departs, the dreamer, who is a young child, follows him to a willow where children are playing. The old <b>man</b> <b>produces</b> a towel and tells them to watch it become a snake. He blows a whistle and circles with dance-like steps, but the towel remains a towel. Finally, he puts the towel into his box and walks on, still insisting it will change. They reach the riverbank, but the old man doesn’t stop. The dreamer watches him wade in, still hoping to see the snake when he emerges on the other bank. The old man, however, disappears beneath the surface and does not reappear.|$|E
50|$|It is true {{that animals}} also produce. They build nests and dwellings, like the bee, the beaver, the ant, etc. But they produce only their own {{immediate}} needs or those of their young; they produce only when immediate physical need compels them to do so, while <b>man</b> <b>produces</b> even when he is free from physical need and truly produces only in freedom from such need; they produce only themselves, while man reproduces the whole of nature; their products belong immediately to their physical bodies, while man freely confronts his own product. Animals produce only according to the standards {{and needs of the}} species to which they belong, while man is capable of producing according to the standards of every species and of applying to each object its inherent standard; hence, man also produces in accordance with the laws of beauty.|$|E

5000|$|A Yemenite {{manuscript}} entitled [...] "Midrash ha-Hefez" [...] (published by S. Schechter in [...] "Folk-Lore", 1890, pp. 353 et seq.) gives nineteen riddles, most {{of which}} are found scattered through the Talmud and the Midrash, which the author of the [...] "Midrash ha-Hefez" [...] attributes to the Queen of Sheba. Most of these riddles are simply Bible questions, some not of a very edifying character. The two that are genuine riddles are: [...] "Without movement while living, it moves when its head is cut off," [...] and [...] "Produced from the ground, <b>man</b> <b>produces</b> it, while its food is the fruit of the ground." [...] The answer to the former is, [...] "a tree, which, when its top is removed, can be made into a moving ship"; the answer to the latter is, [...] "a wick." ...|$|E
5000|$|Although it is {{apparent}} that Roberts and Smith may have had differing views on whether there was death before the fall of Adam, it is evident that they may have had similar views against organic evolution as the explanation for the origin of man. For example, Roberts wrote that [...] "the theory of evolution as advocated by many modern scientists lies stranded upon the shore of idle speculation. There is one other objection to be urged against the theory of evolution before leaving it; it is contrary to the revelations of God." [...] Roberts further criticized the theories of evolution as follows:As before stated, the claims of evolution, as explained by philosophers of the Darwin school, are contrary to all experience so far as man's knowledge extends. The great law of nature is that every plant, herb, fish, beast and <b>man</b> <b>produces</b> its kind; and though there may be slight variation from that law, those variations soon run out either by reverting to the original stock, or else by becoming incapable of producing offspring, and thus become extinct.|$|E
5000|$|George Dundas is sacked by {{his uncle}} {{from his job}} for taking too much time off work. He is accused of not {{grasping}} the [...] "golden ball of opportunity". Walking through the city, he is stopped by a society girl, Mary Montresor, in her expensive touring car who driving past Hyde Park Corner questions George {{as to whether or}} not he would like to marry her. Somewhat distracted by Mary's reckless driving, he has answered yes when he sees newspaper bills, which tell that Mary is to marry the Duke of Edgehill. Mary doesn't seem interested in her commitment and suggests they drive into the country and find a place to live. Going along with her, George agrees. Heading southwest they spot a house on the brow of a hill that Mary likes and go to investigate. Mary states that they will suggest to anyone that is there that they thought it belonged to a [...] "Mrs Pardonstenger" [...] to cover up their investigations. Peeping through the windows they are approached by a butler who does not seem surprised by the pseudonym Mary uses and asks them into the house. Once inside they are quickly accosted by a man and a woman. The <b>man</b> <b>produces</b> a revolver and tells George and Mary to go upstairs at gunpoint. At the top of the stairs, George suddenly fights back and knocks the man out badly. George is all for tying the man up but Mary begs him to leave the house, which they do, George taking the revolver with him. Once in the car, he checks the gun and is astonished to find that it isn't loaded. Mary confesses that the house is hers and the situation they found themselves in was staged by her as a test of any prospective husband and how he would react instinctively to protect her from danger. All so far have failed the test. The couple in the house were engaged by her for the purpose, the man being Rube Wallace, a film actor. As George has been proposed to and passed the test, he suggests getting a special licence for the wedding. Mary however wants him to go down on bended knee, which George refuses to do, telling her that it is degrading. When they arrive in London and he contrives to slip on a banana skin when he gets out of the car, thereby getting down on one knee. George enjoys going back to his uncle and telling him that he is going to marry a rich young society girl - he has grasped the golden ball! ...|$|E
