5|$|Prior to the {{expansion}} of the Roman Empire into the region, Gallic tribes had occupied the Armorican peninsula, dividing it into five regions that then formed the basis for the Roman administration of the area, and which survived into the period of the Duchy. These Gallic tribes (termed the Armorici in Latin), had close relationships with the Britonnes tribes in Roman Britain. Between the late 4th and the early 7th centuries, many of these Britonnes migrated to the Armorican peninsula, blending with the local people to form the later Britons, who eventually became the Bretons. These migrations from Britain contributed to Brittany's name, while also shaping its ethnic and linguistic identity. Brittany was divided into small, warring kingdoms, each competing for resources. The Frankish Carolingian Empire conquered the region during the 8th century, starting around 748 taking the whole of Brittany by 799. In 831 Louis the Pious appointed Nominoe, the Count of Vannes, as imperial <b>missus</b> dominicus for Brittany. The death of Louis in 840, sparked a civil war that fragmented the realm, enabling Nominoe to assert his authority over the former March of Brittany. In 846, the ruler of West Francia, Charles the Bald, signed a peace treaty with Nominoe, recognizing him as the first duke of Brittany.|$|E

50|$|Under Charlemagne's {{surviving}} legitimate son, Louis the Pious (ruling 813-840), who, however, lacked Charlemagne's military charisma, {{the process}} of disintegration was hastened, as, once he had associated the choice of <b>missi</b> with the assembly of nobles, the nobles interfered in the appointment of the <b>missi,</b> who, now selected from the district in which their duties lay, were soon found to be looking after their own interests rather {{than those of the}} central power, and {{to be associated with the}} rising local hereditary filiations. The 825 list of <b>missi</b> reveals that the circuits of the missatica now corresponded with provinces, strengthening local powers. The duties of <b>missi,</b> who gradually increased in number, became merged in the ordinary work of the bishops and counts, and under the emperor Charles the Bald (ruling 843-877), who was repeatedly pressured by bishops to send out <b>missi,</b> they took control of associations for the preservation of the peace. Louis the German (ruling 843-876) is not known to have sent out <b>missi.</b> About the end of the ninth century, with the implosion of Carolingian power, the <b>missi</b> disappeared from France too, and during the 10th century from Italy.|$|R

[...] On 31 January, Bent scored two goals in the period of two minutes against Bolton Wanderers at the Reebok Stadium after coming on as a second-half substitute, in a match that eventually finished as a 3–2 defeat. Following the return of striker Robbie Keane at Tottenham, Redknapp assured Bent of his future at the club. He finished the season as Tottenham's top goalscorer with 17 goals in 43 matches.|$|E
500|$|On 16 December, {{working from}} the small yard behind 11 Exchange Buildings, the gang began {{to break through the}} back wall of the shop; number 10 had been unoccupied since 12 December. At around 10:00 that evening, {{returning}} to his home at 120 Houndsditch, Max Weil heard curious noises coming from his neighbour's property. Outside his house Weil found Police Constable Piper on his beat and informed him of the noises. Piper checked at 118 and 121 Houndsditch, where he could hear the noise, which he thought was unusual enough to investigate further. At 11:00 he knocked at the door of 11 Exchange Buildings—the only property with a light on in the back. The door was opened in a furtive manner and Piper became suspicious immediately. So as not to rouse the man's concerns, Piper asked him [...] "is the <b>missus</b> in?" [...] The man answered in broken English that she was out, and the policeman said he would return later.|$|E
500|$|Upon being {{approached}} by the BBC {{to develop a}} new police procedural drama, Jordan explained that he was conflicted between emulating the former BBC police drama Dixon of Dock Green, using [...] "a set of flawless characters roaming the streets dispensing justice and words of wisdom", or creating a more modern drama, developing characters who would [...] "snort a line of coke, beat up the <b>missus</b> on the way out and shag each other in the locker rooms". Jordan went on to research his new project by spending time with first serving officers, who [...] "portrayed a world of endless, statistic-led red tape". After spending time with first serving officers, Jordan concluded that he was left with an image [...] "not of a modern-day police force, fighting crime on the streets and keeping us all safe, but some kind of unwieldy, top-heavy administrative process, more concerned with public opinion than dispensing justice." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{greatest}} {{influence on}} the later Duchy, however, was {{the formation of a}} unitary Brittany kingdom in the 9th century.

[...] After the death of Louis in 840, Nominoe rose to challenge the new emperor, Charles the Bald, emboldened in part by new Viking raids on the empire. Charles the Bald created the Marches of Neustria to defend Western Francia from the Bretons and the Vikings. Erispoe fought Charles the Bald, who felt that a quick attack would successfully challenge the new Breton leader. Erispoe won a victory at the Battle of Jengland and, under their Treaty of Angers in 851, Brittany's independence was secured.|$|E

2500|$|Meanwhile, {{companies}} like the Wenhua Film Company ("Culture Films"), {{moved away from}} the leftist tradition and explored the evolution and development of other dramatic genres. Wenhua treated postwar problems in universalistic and humanistic ways, avoiding the family narrative and melodramatic formulae. Excellent examples of Wenhua's fare are its first two postwar features, Unending Emotions (1947) and Fake Bride, Phony Bridegroom (1947). Another memorable Wenhua film is Long Live the <b>Missus</b> (1947), like Unending Emotions with an original screenplay by writer Eileen Chang. Wenhua's romantic drama Spring in a Small Town (1948), a film by director Fei Mu shortly prior to the revolution, is often regarded by Chinese film critics {{as one of the most}} important films in the history of Chinese cinema, with it being named by the Hong Kong Film Awards in 2004 as the greatest Chinese-language film ever made. Ironically, it was precisely its artistic quality and apparent lack of [...] "political grounding" [...] that led to its labeling by the Communists as rightist or reactionary, and the film was quickly forgotten by those on the mainland following the Communist victory in China in 1949. However, with the China Film Archive's re-opening after the Cultural Revolution, a new print was struck from the original negative, allowing Spring of the Small Town to find a new and admiring audience and to influence an entire new generation of filmmakers. Indeed, an acclaimed remake was made in 2002 by Tian Zhuangzhuang. Remorse at Death (1948), by the same director, was the first Chinese color film.|$|E
