40|$|A 49 -channel {{parallel}} reactor for {{the high}} throughput screening of catalysts has been developed. The reactor consists of a stainless steel body connected to a <b>multiport</b> <b>valve</b> via capillaries. For product analysis almost any technique can be used. In case of methane oxidation a two-GC setup with a hot and a cold column provided the necessary speed of analysis. The reactor was shown to give data of a quality close to the data quality obtained from measurements in a conventional single-tube flow reactor. Using this reactor setup {{it is possible to}} achieve a test capacity of 49 samples per day. If tests are to be performed at several different temperatures and different residence times, the cycle times are becoming correspondingly longer...|$|E
40|$|A system {{containing}} nine catalytic microreactors for parallel {{preparation and}} testing of heterogeneous catalysts is described. The catalyst samples are prepared {{in the form of}} thin films coated on thin quartz rods by dip-coating in solutions of different composition. Catalyst-coated rods are placed within thin tubes housed inside a wider tube heated in an electrical furnace. A <b>multiport</b> <b>valve</b> serves to sequentially conduct the reaction products from each microreactor to a mass spectrometer for analysis. The system was tested with the reaction of methane reforming with carbon dioxide over Pt/Ce_(1 −x) Gd_xO_(2 − 0. 5 x) and Pt/Ce_(1 −x) Sm_xO_(2 − 0. 5 x) at 650 and 700 °C. Individual catalysts were characterized by X-ray analysis, and induction-coupled plasma mass spectrometry for catalyst mass and elemental composition. The measurements showed that Pt/CeO_ 2 had the highest activity among the series of catalysts tested and generally the activity increased with the cerium oxide content. After exposure to the feedstream for 2 – 3 h at 700 °C, most catalysts suffered significant deactivation except the mixed oxides with 25 – 85 % samarium oxide that maintained relatively stable activity...|$|E
40|$|A {{hydraulic}} valve controller that uses an existing pressure differential as {{some or all}} of the power source for valve operation. In a high pressure environment, such as downhole in an oil or gas well, the pressure differential between the inside of a pipe and the outside of the pipe may be adequately large to drive a linear slide valve. The valve is operated hydraulically by a piston in a bore. When a higher pressure is applied to one end of the bore and a lower pressure to the other end, the piston moves in response to the pressure differential and drives a valve attached to it. If the pressure differential is too small to drive the piston at a sufficiently high speed, a pump is provided to generate a larger pressure differential to be applied. The apparatus is conveniently constructed using <b>multiport</b> <b>valves,</b> which can be rotary valves...|$|R
40|$|A fluid sampler for {{collecting}} {{a plurality of}} discrete samples over separate time intervals is described. The sampler comprises a sample assembly having an inlet and a plurality of discreet sample tubes {{each of which has}} inlet and outlet sides. A <b>multiport</b> dual acting <b>valve</b> is provided in the sampler in order to sequentially pass air from the sample inlet into the selected sample tubes. The sample tubes extend longitudinally of the housing and are located about the outer periphery thereof so that upon removal of an enclosure cover, they are readily accessible for operation of the sampler in an analysis mode...|$|R
40|$|U. S. Patent 6, 142, 151 {{describes}} a dual-bed ventilation {{system for a}} space suit, with emphasis on a <b>multiport</b> spool <b>valve</b> that switches air flows between two chemical beds that adsorb carbon dioxide and water vapor. The valve is used to alternately make the air flow through one bed while exposing the other bed to the outer-space environment to regenerate that bed through vacuum desorption of CO 2 and H 2 O. Oxygen flowing from a supply tank is routed through a pair of periodically switched solenoid valves to drive the spool valve in a reciprocating motion. The spool valve equalizes the pressures of air in the beds and the volumes of air flowing {{into and out of}} the beds during the alternations between the adsorption and desorption phases, in such a manner that the volume of air that must be vented to outer space is half of what it would be in the absence of pressure equalization. Oxygen that has been used to actuate the spool valve in its reciprocating motion is released into the ventilation loop to replenish air lost to vacuum during the previous desorption phase of the operating cycle...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{is based}} on the further development and applications of capillary electrophoresis (CE) with capacitively coupled contactless conductivity detection (C 4 D), i. e. sequential injection analysis (SIA) applications when coupled with CE-C 4 D, or determination and quantification of various ions that are not or barely UV absorbed. A purpose made CE-C 4 D system was used for determination of the DNA fragments of different length, using additives to modify the medium and to sieve charged anions according to their size. We determined DNA mass ladder and PCR products from various sources. Feasibility of the C 4 D method and its practical application in the separation of DNA fragments was studied and as far as we are concerned has not been implemented for the routine analysis yet. CE-C 4 D method demonstrated separation with much shorter analysis time than the standard gel-electrophoresis used in conventional approach. No derivatization or sample preparations were necessary. Further on, we investigated employment of an automated system with a sequential injection analysis (SIA) manifold based on a syringe pump and <b>multiport</b> <b>valve</b> coupled with CE-C 4 D. Hydrodynamic pumping was introduced for electrophoretic separation of most commonly used artificial sweeteners. Compounds were determined in their anionic form at a high pH. Without any surfactant or modifier to reverse the electroosmotic flow, higher separation efficiency was noticed. The conditions were optimized either for better detection limits or for shorter analysis time. In addition, band broadening was observed due to pressure caused by hydrodynamic pumping. Therefore, the requirement of the narrow capillary of 10 µm for sensitive detection was necessary. The best compromise for differences between analysis time and separation efficiency was found. This coupled system setup approved to complete all operation steps to perform complex measurements with possibility to change any of the parameters during the measurements, among which sampling, separation, detection, data acquisition and polarity of the high-voltage. SIA-CE-C 4 D composition was afterwards engaged with an array of 16 contactless conductivity detectors aligned on the capillary for real time monitoring of the entire electrophoretic separation. For better control of pressurization, some modifications were implemented, demonstrating the developments of the peaks throughout the whole capillary. Dual capacitively coupled contactless conductivity detector was implemented. Both channels were brought into line in a bridge mode where one acts as a reference with subtracted signal. As a result, the electronic zero setting of the baseline, caused by conductivity change of the background buffer, was not necessary as in previous versions of the cell. All the differences in buffer content are consequently considered. At the end, study on the effect of buffer concentration on the sensitivity was taken into consideration. Narrow capillaries employed, resulted in high signal-to-noise ratio when higher buffer concentration are used. Several fundamental aspects of the axial capacitively contactless conductivity detection were investigated in order to explain this uncertain effect. The performance, behavior and the cell geometry of a new detector design are reported but some evidence of the solution for this problem is still missing. ...|$|E
