5|$|A trial {{assembly}} of the Gadget without the active components or explosive lenses {{was carried out by}} the bomb assembly team headed by Norris Bradbury at Los Alamos on July 3. It was driven to Trinity and back. A set of explosive lenses arrived on July 7, followed by a second set on July 10. Each was examined by Bradbury and Kistiakowsky, and the best ones were selected for use. The remainder were handed over to Edward Creutz, who conducted a test detonation at Pajarito Canyon near Los Alamos without nuclear material. This test brought bad news: <b>magnetic</b> <b>measurements</b> of the simultaneity of the implosion seemed to indicate that the Trinity test would fail. Bethe worked through the night to assess the results, and reported that they were consistent with a perfect explosion.|$|E

25|$|As the {{industry}} strives to reduce {{maintenance and repair}} costs, non-destructive testing of structures becomes increasingly valued both in production control and {{as a means to}} measure the utilization and condition of key infrastructure. There are several measurement techniques to measure stress in a material. However, techniques using optical measurements, <b>magnetic</b> <b>measurements,</b> X-ray diffraction, and neutron diffraction are all limited to measuring surface or near surface stress or strains. Acoustic waves propagate with ease through materials and provide thus a means to probe the interior of structures, where the stress and strain level is important for the overall structural integrity.|$|E

25|$|SCO {{was first}} {{observed}} in 1931 by Cambi et al. who discovered anomalous magnetic behavior for the tris(N,N-dialkyldithiocarbamatoiron(III) complexes. The spin states of these complexes were {{sensitive to the}} nature of their axial ligands. Upon the development of Ligand Field Theory, it became evident that equilibrium could exist between spin states. In the 1960s, the first CoII SCO complex was reported. <b>Magnetic</b> <b>measurements</b> and Mössbauer spectroscopic studies established the nature of the spin transition in iron(II) SCO complexes. Building on those early studies, there is now interest in applications of SCO in electronic and optical displays.|$|E
25|$|A DAC {{consists}} of two opposing diamonds with a sample compressed between the polished culets (tips). Pressure may be monitored using a reference material whose behavior under pressure is known. Common pressure standards include ruby fluorescence, and various structurally simple metals, such as copper or platinum. The uniaxial pressure supplied by the DAC may be transformed into uniform hydrostatic pressure using a pressure-transmitting medium, such as argon, xenon, hydrogen, helium, paraffin oil or a mixture of methanol and ethanol. The pressure-transmitting medium is enclosed by a gasket and the two diamond anvils. The sample can be viewed through the diamonds and illuminated by X-rays and visible light. In this way, X-ray diffraction and fluorescence; optical absorption and photoluminescence; Mössbauer, Raman and Brillouin scattering; positron annihilation and other signals can be measured from materials under high pressure. Magnetic and microwave fields can be applied externally to the cell allowing nuclear magnetic resonance, electron paramagnetic resonance and other <b>magnetic</b> <b>measurements.</b> Attaching electrodes to the sample allows electrical and magnetoelectrical measurements as well as heating up the sample to a few thousand degrees. Much higher temperatures (up to 7000 K) can be achieved with laser-induced heating, and cooling down to millikelvins has been demonstrated.|$|E
500|$|In 1833 the British Association for the Advancement of Science {{commissioned}} {{a series of}} <b>magnetic</b> <b>measurements</b> across the United Kingdom. Under the direction of Major Edward Sabine of the Royal Artillery, a multi-year measuring project began, with the results {{to be published in}} 1838. As the measurements were being made a number of proposals were put forth to expand the program worldwide. In 1836 the German explorer and naturalist Alexander von Humboldt wrote to Prince Augustus Frederick, Duke of Sussex, then President of the Royal Society, stating that a formal program was important to a nation with dominions spread across the globe. At the seventh meeting of the British Association in Liverpool in 1837, Sabine declared that [...] "the magnetism of the earth cannot be counted less than {{one of the most important}} branches of the physical history of the planet we inhabit" [...] and mapping its variations would be [...] "regarded by our contemporaries and by posterity as a fitting enterprise of a maritime people; and a worthy achievement of a nation which has ever sought to rank foremost in every arduous undertaking".|$|E
40|$|Room {{temperature}} ferromagnetism in both transition-metals doped and undoped semiconductor {{thin films}} and nanostructures challenges {{our understanding of}} the magnetism in solids. In this report, we performed the <b>magnetic</b> <b>measurement</b> and Andreev reflection spectroscopy study on undoped IndiumTin oxide (ITO) thin films and bulk samples. The <b>magnetic</b> <b>measurement</b> results of thin films show that the total magnetization/cm 2 is thickness independent. Prominent ferromagnetism signal was also discovered in bulk samples. Spin polarized electron transports were probed on ITO thin film/superconductor interface and bulk samples surface/superconductor interface. Based on the <b>magnetic</b> <b>measurement</b> results and spin polarization measurement data, we propose that the ferromagnetism in this material originates from the surface spin polarization and this surface polarization may also explain the room temperature ferromagnetism discovered in other undoped oxide semiconductor thin films and nanostructures...|$|R

500|$|Dione is {{the second-largest}} inner moon of Saturn. It {{has a higher}} density than the geologically dead Rhea, the largest inner moon, but {{lower than that of}} active Enceladus. While the {{majority}} of Dione's surface is heavily cratered old terrain, this moon is also covered with an extensive network of troughs and lineaments, indicating that in the past it had global tectonic activity. The troughs and lineaments are especially prominent on the trailing hemisphere, where several intersecting sets of fractures form what is called [...] "wispy terrain". The cratered plains have a few large impact craters reaching 250km in diameter. Smooth plains with low impact-crater counts are present as well on a small fraction its surface. They were probably tectonically resurfaced relatively later in the geological history of Dione. At two locations within smooth plains strange landforms (depressions) resembling oblong impact craters have been identified, both of which lie at the centers of radiating networks of cracks and troughs; these features may be cryovolcanic in origin. Dione may be geologically active even now, although on a scale much smaller than the cryovolcanism of Enceladus. This follows from Cassini <b>magnetic</b> <b>measurements</b> that show Dione is a net source of plasma in the magnetosphere of Saturn, much like Enceladus.|$|E

40|$|The linac {{coherent}} light source [LCLS] project requires 5 {micro}m straightness of the particle beam trajectory {{to achieve the}} desired goal of x-ray multiplication.

50|$|<b>Magnetic</b> <b>measurements</b> {{have been}} used to {{investigate}} past climate. A classic example is the study of loess, which is windblown dust from the edges of glaciers and semiarid desert margins. In north-central China, blankets of loess that were deposited during glacial periods alternate with paleosols (fossil soils) that formed during warmer and wetter interglacials. The magnetic susceptibility profiles of these sediments have been dated using magnetostratigraphy, which identifies geomagnetic reversals, and correlated with climate indicators such as oxygen isotope stages. Ultimately, this work allowed environmental magnetists to map out the variations in the monsoon cycle during the Quaternary. <b>Magnetic</b> <b>measurements</b> of lacustrine sediments {{can also be used to}} reconstruct the upland surfical processes that were associated with past climate.|$|E
