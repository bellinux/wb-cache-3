5|$|All {{students}} {{have the right to}} enter upper secondary education when they turn sixteen. Around 97% of students leaving lower secondary education enter into upper secondary education; however there is a notable drop-out rate. There are specific entry requirements for different courses, but as all {{students have}} the right to this sort of education, a general program of study is available for those students who <b>may</b> <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> meet requirements. Some schools enjoy more prestige and popularity than others, especially in Reykjavík, and those may need to turn away hundreds of students every year.|$|E
5|$|Progressive {{deterioration}} eventually hinders independence, with subjects {{being unable}} to perform most common activities of daily living. Speech difficulties become evident due to an inability to recall vocabulary, which leads to frequent incorrect word substitutions (paraphasias). Reading and writing skills are also progressively lost. Complex motor sequences become less coordinated as time passes and AD progresses, so the risk of falling increases. During this phase, memory problems worsen, and the person <b>may</b> <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> recognise close relatives. Long-term memory, which was previously intact, becomes impaired.|$|E
5|$|Proposed {{methods for}} {{controlling}} gopher populations in agricultural areas include poisoning dandelions, clover, carrots, {{sweet potatoes and}} parsnips. Camas pocket gophers are larger than other gophers, so conventional gopher traps <b>may</b> <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> capture them. Toxic baits and fumigants may also fail, since the gophers will sometimes wall off {{a segment of the}} burrow. Gophers may also cause local flooding if their tunneling activities damage levees.|$|E

5|$|Details of {{the fruit}} bodies' appearance, color in particular, are {{somewhat}} variable and dependent on growing conditions. For example, specimens growing on logs in oak and hickory forests in the spring {{tend to have more}} yellowish-white, depressed caps than those found in the same location in autumn, which are light yellow brown and more convex in shape. The fruit body development of M.rotula is hemiangiocarpous, with an hymenium that is only partially enclosed by basidiocarp tissues. Robert Kühner showed that a -like tissue covers the young gills before the expanding cap breaks away from the stem. In unfavorable weather conditions, however, the mushrooms <b>may</b> <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> develop normally and instead produce semi-gasteroid basidiocarps.|$|E
5|$|Microsoft {{originally}} {{announced that}} users {{who did not}} install the update would not receive any other updates after May 13, 2014. However, meeting this deadline proved challenging: The ability to deploy Windows 8.1 Update through Windows Server Update Services (WSUS) was disabled shortly after its release following {{the discovery of a}} bug which affects the ability to use WSUS as a whole in certain server configurations. Microsoft later fixed the issue but users continued to report that the update <b>may</b> <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> install. Microsoft's attempt to fix the problem was ineffective, to the point that Microsoft pushed the support deadline further to June 30, 2014. On 16 May, Microsoft released additional updates to fix a problem of BSOD in the update.|$|E
5|$|The least weasel feeds {{predominantly}} on mouse-like rodents, including mice, hamsters, gerbils and others. It {{usually does}} not attack adult hamsters and rats. Frogs, fish, small birds and bird eggs are rarely eaten. It {{can deal with}} adult pikas and gerbils, but usually cannot overcome brown rats and sousliks. Exceptional cases are known of least weasels killing prey far larger than themselves, such as capercaillie, hazel hen and hares. In England, a favoured prey item is the field vole (Microtus agrestis). These have fluctuations in population size, and in years of abundance may form up to 54% of the weasel's diet. In years of scarcity, birds form {{a greater proportion of}} the diet and female least weasels <b>may</b> <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> breed.|$|E

5|$|Three {{aspects of}} {{communication}} patterns are of clinical interest: poor prosody, tangential and circumstantial speech, and marked verbosity. Although inflection and intonation {{may be less}} rigid or monotonic than in classic autism, people with AS often have a limited range of intonation: speech may be unusually fast, jerky or loud. Speech may {{convey a sense of}} incoherence; the conversational style often includes monologues about topics that bore the listener, fails to provide context for comments, or fails to suppress internal thoughts. Individuals with AS <b>may</b> <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> detect whether the listener is interested or engaged in the conversation. The speaker's conclusion or point may never be made, and attempts by the listener to elaborate on the speech's content or logic, or to shift to related topics, are often unsuccessful.|$|E
5|$|Three {{possible}} {{mechanisms of}} relapse were proposed by Marchoux in 1926 (i) parthenogenesis of macrogametocytes: (ii) persistence of schizonts in small {{numbers in the}} blood where immunity inhibits multiplication, but later disappears and/or (iii) reactivation of an encysted body in the blood. James in 1931 proposed that sporozoites are carried to internal organs, where they enter reticuloendothelial cells and undergo a cycle of development, based on quinine's lack of activity on them. Huff and Bloom in 1935 demonstrated stages of avian malaria that transpire outside blood cells (exoerythrocytic). In 1945 Fairley et al. reported that inoculation of blood from a patient with P. vivax <b>may</b> <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> induce malaria, although the donor may subsequently exhibit the condition. Sporozoites disappeared from the blood stream within one hour and reappeared eight days later. This suggested the presence of forms that persist in tissues. Using mosquitoes rather than blood, in 1946 Shute described a similar phenomenon and proposed {{the existence of an}} 'x-body' or resting form. The following year Sapero proposed a link between relapse and a tissue stage not yet discovered. Garnham in 1947 described exoerythrocytic schizogony in Hepatocystis (Plasmodium) kochi. In the following year Shortt and Garnham described the liver stages of P. cynomolgi in monkeys. In the same year a human volunteer consented to receive a massive dose of infected sporozoites of P. vivax and undergo a liver biopsy three months later, thus allowing Shortt et al. to demonstrate the tissue stage. The tissue form of Plasmodium ovale was described in 1954 and that of P. malariae in 1960 in experimentally infected chimpanzees.|$|E
