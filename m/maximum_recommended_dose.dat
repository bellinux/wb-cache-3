40|$|The {{present study}} was carried out to {{establish}} whether the Defined Daily Doses (DDDs) system could be reliably applied to standardize antipsychotic dosages. Initially, the relationship between antipsychotic doses expressed as DDDs, chlorpromazine equivalents (CPZEs) and percentages of the British National Formulary (BNF) <b>maximum</b> <b>recommended</b> daily <b>dose</b> were investigated by calculating Spearman's rank correlation coefficients. Second, factors associated with antipsychotic dose, expressed as DDDs, CPZEs and percentages of the BNF <b>maximum</b> <b>recommended</b> daily <b>dose,</b> were investigated by means of linear regression analysis. The study sample consisted of 277 patients with schizophrenia. The relationship between antipsychotic daily doses expressed as multiples of DDDs and CPZEs revealed a significant correlation (Spearman's rho= 0. 779, P < 0. 001). Similarly, the relationship between antipsychotic daily doses expressed as multiples of DDDs and percentages of the BNF <b>maximum</b> <b>recommended</b> daily <b>dose</b> revealed a significant correlation (Spearman's rho= 0. 869, P < 0. 001).

40|$|Fluvastatin is a hydroxymethylglutaryl {{coenzyme}} A(HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor used {{to treat}} hyper-lipidemia. It is a very effective agent for lowering low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and total cholesterol concentrations. 1 These reductions in lipids result in an overall reduction in coronary events.

Specifically, several cases of myopathy have been observed with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors. 1, 4 - 6 Myopathy consists of myalgia, muscle tenderness or weak-ness, and elevated serum creatine kinase (CK). 5, 7 In partic-ular, mega trials 8 with simvastatin have shown a 0. 025 % incidence of myopathy in long-term studies. The estimated rate of myopathy with statin monotherapy is 0. 025 – 0. 5 % and is dose dependent. 8 - 10 The risk of myopathy increases with concurrent use of other drugs. 8 Notably, there is an in-creased risk for myopathy when HMG-CoA reductase in-hibitors are used with cyclosporine, erythromycin, fibrates, or niacin. 8, 11 - 14 Myopathy can progress to severe rhabdomy-olysis and renal failure.

40|$|Rabbits with Staphylococcus aureus {{endocarditis}} {{were treated}} with cephalothin or ceftazidime to determine whether differences in in vitro activity would result in differences in in vivo efficacy. Antibiotics were administered in <b>doses</b> equivalent to <b>maximum</b> <b>recommended</b> human <b>doses,</b> and results of laboratory tests to predict antimicrobial efficacy were determined during treatment. Cephalothin and ceftazidime MICs for the challenge strain were 0. 5 and 8 micrograms/ml, respectively. MBCs were 32 and greater than 128 micrograms/ml, respectively. With peak sera, laboratory results (means) for cephalothin and ceftazidime were as follows: ratios of concentration in serum to MIC, 300 and 16; ratios of concentration in serum to MBC, 4. 8 and less than 1; bacteriostatic antibacterial activity titers in serum, 1 : 256 and 1 : 16; and bactericidal antibacterial activity titers in serum, 1 : 16 and 1 : 4, respectively.
