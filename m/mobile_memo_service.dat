This paper explores a novel concept called <b>Mobile</b> Electronic <b>Memo</b> {{whose purpose}} is to {{overcome}} the limitations in terms of interoperability and accessibility imposed by the current technology. To achieve this goal, <b>Mobile</b> Electronic <b>Memos</b> decouple the semantics of {{the information from the}} physical and pragmatic constraints of the medium that transports it. We examine related works and standards that could be good candidates for implementing MEMs and describe a prototype implementation that has been realized as a proof of concept...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{first part}} of this paper {{introduces}} “MEMs ” (<b>Mobile</b> Electronic <b>Memos).</b> MEMs are electronic notes consisting of a data structure associated with a specific class of information (e. g. information describing a location, a person, a service, or a Web site), and meta-information, used for management. Users can automatically capture MEMs from the environment or from other services, store them for future use, share them with other users and send them as input to other services and applications. With MEMs, users can drastically reduce the amount of information they have to input manually. MEMs should be seen {{as an extension of the}} traditional clipboard, a uniform mechanism allowing users to store output from one service and provide it to other services. We suggest that this possibility could play an important role in encouraging the take-up of mobile services by private and business users. The second part of the paper describes the implementation of the MEM concept in the framework of a EU-funded project, named Simple Mobile Services. The implementation includes as main elements: i) an open source client for mobil...|$|R

The second part of the paper describes the implementation of the MEM concept in the framework of a EU-funded project, named Simple Mobile Services. The implementation includes as main elements: i) an open source client for mobile devices (called MOVE), which simplifies access to mobile services and allows easy management of MEMs; ii) server-side components; iii) a middleware platform; iv) Smart Card Web Server (SCWS) technology to access the security features offered by the (U) -SIM, contained in the mobile devices. The whole solution has been implemented on real-life SIMs by a major operator, and is currently tested in real life environments on the University of Roma “Tor Vergata” campus and at Athens International Airport. Finally, we point out that the aim of this paper is a high-level description of our work. More technical details can be found in project deliverables and documents...|$|R

2500|$|On 12 January 2016, {{according}} to a <b>memo</b> from the <b>service,</b> {{it was reported that}} Fort Worth was sidelined in port at Singapore indefinitely because of damage to gears that propel the vessel, which resulted from a failure to use enough lubricating oil. As a result, on 28 March 2016, CDR Michael Atwell, the commander of LCS crew 101 (the LCS is manned by a rotating crew), was relieved of duty and was temporarily replaced by CDR Lex Walker, deputy commodore of Destroyer Squadron 7. The Navy cited the reason for CDR Atwell's removal was [...] "due to a due to loss of confidence in Atwell's ability to command," [...] stemming from initial findings into the incident that sidelined Fort Worth. [...] It is estimated that the repairs to Fort Worth would cost between $20 and $30 million {{according to}} defense officials, and it was feared that the ship would need to be heavy-lifted back from Singapore to San Diego so it can be repaired during its scheduled overhaul. However, the USN announced on 13 April 2016, that Fort Worth would transit back to San Diego on her gas turbines instead, with the journey scheduled for summer 2016. It was expected that Fort Worth would take 6 weeks to travel from Singapore to San Diego with several underway replenishments and planned fueling stops along the way. However, a subsequent assessment found that the damage to Fort Worth was less severe than initially believed, and her engines were repaired in Singapore by late July ahead of returning to the United States for further repairs.|$|R
5000|$|After the {{publication}} of his Greek Memories in 1932, he was prosecuted the following year at the Old Bailey under the Official Secrets Act for quoting from supposedly secret documents. His account of the trial, vividly described, is in Octave Seven (1931-38) of his autobiography: the result was a fine of £100 and (prosecution) costs of £100. His own costs were over £1,000. Mackenzie states that a plea-bargain (described in the text as [...] "an arrangement") had been reached with the judge prior to the trial: in exchange for his pleading guilty, he would be fined £500 with £500 costs. However Sir Thomas Inskip, then attorney general who prosecuted the case, succeeded in annoying the trial judge {{to such an extent that}} he then reduced the penalties to a token amount. Even so the costs of his defence and the withdrawal from sale of Greek Memories left Makenzie out of pocket and an attempt was made to ask the authorities exactly which passages in the book they objected to so it could be re-issued with the offending material removed. This approach was rebuffed. In Octave Eight, covering the years 1939-45, Mackenzie recounts that the matter was raised in Parliament and a new version of Greek Memories was eventually published in 1939.However, in spite of the withdrawal of the 1st edition a copy had already been deposited at the British Museum [...] (which then contained what is now the independent British Library) but was not given a general catalogue reference making it effectively impossible to access. In 1994 The Guardian newspaper published an article about this anomaly The muzzling of Compton Mackenzie - 62 years on. Following this the 1932 edition was entered in the British Library’s public catalogue. In 2011 Biteback published the original 1932 edition of Greek Memories, including the Secret Intelligence <b>Service</b> <b>memo</b> detailing the offending passages of the book.|$|R
