25|$|In 1900, Sonor drum company {{introduced}} its first single bass drum pedal. William F. Ludwig made the bass drum pedal workable in 1909, {{paving the way}} for the modern drum kit. A bass drum pedal operates much the same as the hi-hat control; a footplate is pressed to pull a chain, belt, or metal drive mechanism downward, bringing a beater or mallet forward into the drumhead. The beater head is usually made of either felt, wood, plastic, or rubber and is attached to a rod-shaped <b>metal</b> <b>shaft.</b> The pedal and beater system are mounted in a metal frame and like the hi-hat, a tension unit controls the amount of pressure needed to strike and the amount of recoil upon release.|$|E

50|$|Turned, Ground, and Polished (TGP) is a {{classification}} of finishing processes {{often used for}} <b>metal</b> <b>shafting.</b> Turning (on a lathe) creates straight round bars without the strain induced by cold drawing, while grinding and polishing improves the surface finish and roundness for high dimensional accuracy. Extreme straightness is critical in high-speed applications to prevent vibration and reduce wear on bearings.|$|R
5000|$|An {{evaluation}} {{performed by}} NHTSA in 1982 on passenger cars found that [...] "integral" [...] head restraints—a seat back extending {{high enough to}} meet the 27.5 in height requirement—reduces injury by 17 percent, while adjustable head restraints, attached to the seat back {{by one or more}} sliding <b>metal</b> <b>shafts,</b> reduce injury by 10 percent. NHTSA has said this difference may be due to adjustable restraints being improperly positioned.|$|R
500|$|Art Ross was {{an early}} {{innovator}} of the game. [...] He designed rounded goal nets that became the league standard, replacing the old square-backed nets. [...] He also successfully argued for using synthetic rubber pucks rather than real rubber. [...] Some of Ross' inventions did not catch on, however. [...] Ross invented a puck with rounded edges that was rejected after goaltenders complained about their erratic behaviour on the ice. [...] He also created a two-piece hockey stick that had a <b>metal</b> <b>shaft</b> and replaceable wooden blades. [...] The idea did not catch on at the time, but was a forerunner to modern composite sticks used today.|$|E
2500|$|Electronic stethoscopes require {{conversion}} of acoustic sound waves to electrical signals which {{can then be}} amplified and processed for optimal listening. Unlike acoustic stethoscopes, which are all {{based on the same}} physics, transducers in electronic stethoscopes vary widely. The simplest and least effective method of sound detection is achieved by placing a microphone in the chestpiece. This method suffers from ambient noise interference and has fallen out of favor. Another method, used in Welch-Allyn's Meditron stethoscope, comprises placement of a piezoelectric crystal {{at the head of a}} <b>metal</b> <b>shaft,</b> the bottom of the shaft making contact with a diaphragm. 3M also uses a piezo-electric crystal placed within foam behind a thick rubber-like diaphragm. The Thinklabs' Rhythm 32 [...] uses an Electromagnetic Diaphragm with a conductive inner surface to form a capacitive sensor. This diaphragm responds to sound waves, with changes in an electric field replacing changes in air pressure.

Instead of bothering with bolts and bars for their dwellings, the red Martians simply run them up out of harm's way during the night. They also have private means for lowering or raising them from the ground without if they wish to go away and leave them.|$|E

50|$|The staves must {{resist the}} {{forces in the}} bearing and offer {{adequate}} lubrication from this water alone. They must also survive long-term immersion without rotting, softening or swelling. The historical material for this was the tropical hardwood timber, lignum vitae. In modern practice, Tufnol is often used. Recent developments in composites have seen polyester resin and phenolic resin composites such as ACM, Maritex and Orkot being used.

The front ranks usually cast their pila, and the following ranks hurled theirs {{over the heads of the}} front-line fighters. If a cast pilum did not cause direct death or injury, they were so designed that the hard iron triangular points would stick into enemy shields, bending on their soft <b>metal</b> <b>shafts,</b> weighing down the shields and making them unusable.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: It has {{recently}} been shown that some carbon fiber-reinforced composite <b>shafts</b> with a <b>metal</b> core or casing are superior to all carbon fiber reinforced plastics (CFRP) or <b>metal</b> <b>shafts</b> {{from the viewpoint of}} the natural frequencies. However, it has not been reported whether or not the benefit of the metal/CFRP hybrid shafts exists in the general cases of various fiber angles, length-to-diameter ratios, material properties, and thicknesses of metal layers. In this study, the effects of a steel core or casing on the bending natural frequencies of CFRP shafts are analytically investigated. In order to calculate the frequencies, the equations of motion are obtained for metal/CFRP hybrid shafts. Several beam theories are evaluated, and differences between these theories in the prediction of the frequencies are also presented. It is found that, in certain cases, an optimum thickness of steel exists to maximize the frequencies of the steel/CFRP shafts. Parametric studies are also carried out over wide ranges of design factors, and design guidelines for the hybrid shafts are finally distilled.

40|$|In May 1987, the Musée Guimet {{bought in}} London a rare {{sculpture}} of a bodhisattva from Nepal. The piece, made by the lost wax process, is in quite pure copper as many old nepali statuettes. It contains some <b>metal</b> <b>shafts</b> to give more solidity to the figure {{before and after the}} cooking. This inside structure appears by radio examination. In the head, its top extremity is scroolled on, in crozier shape. This strange particularity is also present on another {{sculpture of a}} bodhisattva in the Guimet collection (MA 3373). To give a precise iconographical identification of this deity is difficult. The lotus flower, took by the left hand and perhaps supporting some attributes, and disappeared. However, the right hand is depicted in argumentation gesture (vitarka- mudrâ). In the group of eight or sixteen important bodhisattva, only Maitreya and Manjuçrî usually do this mudrâ. In a strict canonical iconography Maitreya, as a bodhisattva, bears a stûpa in his hairdress. It is true that this rule is not strictly used in Nepal. But without any definit argument, it is reasonable to identifie the new bodhisattva of the Musée Guimet as Manjuçrî. The sculpture belongs to the classical style of the XIIe-XIIIe century. Close comparisons with other bronzes give some more similitudes with the imposing figures of the XIIIe century than with the refined pieces of the XIIe century. In the XIVe century, a new taste for affected attitudes and decorative ornaments appears. Béguin Gilles, Drilhon France. Un bodhisattva néwar au musée Guimet.

40|$|The power {{produced}} from an engine of automobile {{can be transferred}} to the drive wheel by power transmission system. Each automobile has different power transmission system constructive features depend on the vehicle’s driveline concept. (H. Bayrakceken et al., 2006) To transmit the driving torque from the engine or gear unit to the wheels, most of passenger car and light vehicle driven by combustion engine has at least two driveshaft as a basic requirement (Amborn, P. 1995). During operation, torsional stress and bending stress was experienced by driveshaft due to the weight of the car or misalignment of journal bearing (Asi, 2006). In order to meet the requirements {{of one of the most}} highly stressed components in automotive assembly, a failure investigation must be conducted. Finite element method was used as stress analysis to determine the stress conditions at the failed section. Nearly all of driveshaft are <b>metal</b> <b>shafts</b> or <b>metal</b> tubes that has special joint at each end called universal joint (Birch and Rockwood 2005). Power transmission system of vehicles consist several components which sometimes encounter unfortunate failures. Some common reasons for the failures may be manufacturing and design faults, maintenance faults, raw material faults, material processing faults as well as the user originated faults. In this study, fracture analysis of a universal joint yoke and a drive shaft of an automobile power transmission system are carried out. Spectroscopic analyses, metallographic analyses and hardness measurements are carried out for each part. For the determination of stress conditions at the failed section, stress analysis is also carried out by the finite element method.
