40|$|In this paper, laser-induced {{breakdown}} spectroscopy (LIBS) using micro-droplet NaCl {{solution is}} described. Since the 1980 s, many liquid <b>micronizing</b> techniques for LIBS measurements have been reported. In this study, micro-droplet ejection systems for sampling are designed and presented for two volumes. These micro-droplet ejection systems enable a constant volume of the sample liquid to be obtained and they {{take advantage of the}} liquid physical state; the density of the solution can be controlled accurately. The methods presented here generate small droplets (diameter 30 or 50 μm) by confining the entire volume of the sample material in the laser beam spot area (minimum beam spot diameter: 53. 2 μm) and separating it from its surroundings. Using these liquid <b>micronizing</b> methods, improved sensitivities are obtained for drawing calibration curves for quantitative LIBS measurements...|$|E
30|$|Microparticles of olivine and {{ordinary}} chondrite were produced by first crushing the samples to ~ 0.5 mm pieces and then grinding {{the pieces in}} a McCrone <b>micronizing</b> mill for 30 minutes. The <b>micronizing</b> mill is a wet slurry grinder that uses thirty agate grinding elements, and our protocol produces olivine {{and ordinary}} chondrite microparticles ~ 2 μm in diameter. After the samples were micronized, they were suspended in a 4 to 1 methanol-water solution to create a 0.005 % w/v suspension of microparticles. This {{is not the only}} solvent combination that works for electrospray, but our experience, as well as the work of Cai et al. (2002), shows this solvent combination and particle concentration are effective. The suspensions were sonicated for thirty minutes to disperse the particles, and they were re-sonicated for at least two minutes before using them in an experiment. For the experiments in this study, the pH of both olivine and meteorite suspensions was 4.7.|$|E

All subjects received supplementation to ensure a minimum of 1500 mg calcium daily. Fifty-one subjects completed at least 1 year of follow-up bone density measurements by quantitative computed tomography and by single- and dual-photon absorptiometry. In the placebo group spinal trabecular bone density decreased 4. 9 % annually (p less than 0. 001), whereas in those taking <b>micronized</b> 17 beta-estradiol bone density tended to increase (annual increases of 0. 3 % in the 0. 5 mg <b>micronized</b> 17 beta-estradiol group, 1. 8 % in the 1. 0 mg <b>micronized</b> 17 beta-estradiol group, and 2. 5 % in the 2. 0 mg <b>micronized</b> 17 beta-estradiol group). After completing the double-blind phase, 41 subjects completed an additional 18 months of follow-up while taking 1. 0 mg <b>micronized</b> 17 beta-estradiol. During this time one third of the subjects were randomly assigned to discontinue calcium supplements. Among those who previously received placebo, trabecular bone density increased 4. 3 % annually, whereas among those who had used <b>micronized</b> 17 beta-estradiol, trabecular bone density response was inversely related to the dosage previously used. Additionally and independently, the level of calcium intake showed a statistically significant correlation with the change in spinal trabecular bone density (r = 0. 37, p = 0. 02). We conclude that <b>micronized</b> 17 beta-estradiol has a continuous skeletal dose-response effect in the range of 0. 5 to 2. 0 mg and that calcium intake positively modifies the skeletal response to 1. 0 mg <b>micronized</b> 17 beta-estradiol...|$|R

40|$|The {{fabrication}} of tailored microparticles for delivery of therapeutics {{is a challenge}} relying upon a complex interplay between processing parameters and materials properties. The emerging use of electrospraying allows better tailoring of particle morphologies and sizes than current techniques, critical to reproducible release profiles. While dry encapsulation of proteins {{is essential for the}} release of active therapeutics from microparticles, it is currently uncharacterized in electrospraying. To this end, poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) was assessed as a <b>micronizing</b> and solubilizing agent for dry protein encapsulation and release from electrosprayed particles made from polycaprolactone (PCL). The physical effect of PEG in protein-loaded poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) particles was also studied, for comparison. The addition of 5 – 15 wt% PEG 6 kDa or 35 kDa resulted in reduced PCL particle sizes and broadened distributions, which could be improved by tailoring the electrospraying processing parameters, namely by reducing polymer concentration and increasing flow rate. Upon micronization, protein particle size was reduced to the micrometer domain, resulting in homogenous encapsulation in electrosprayed PCL microparticles. Microparticle size distributions were shown to be the most determinant factor for protein release by diffusion and allowed specific control of release patterns...|$|E
40|$|Research in {{the field}} of protein {{therapeutics}} has exploded over the past decade and continues to grow in both academia and in industry. Protein drugs have advantages of being highly specific and highly active making them coveted targets for high profile disease states like cancer and multiple sclerosis. Unfortunately, their many advantages are complemented by their obstacles. Because proteins are highly active and highly specific, the window between efficacy and toxicity is very narrow and drug development can be long and arduous. In addition, protein activity is dependent on its specific folding conformation that is easily disrupted by a variety of development processes. This research aimed to identify microparticle formulations to control protein release and also to determine which formulation parameters affected burst release, encapsulation, and steady-state release the most. It was found that polymer type and composition were two of the most important factors. Long-term controlled release of bovine serum albumin (BSA) was achieved as well as a wide variety of release profiles. A method was identified for <b>micronizing</b> protein at low cost to retain activity and coacervation was evaluated as a method for preparing protein loaded microspheres.

40|$|Fly ash, a {{byproduct}} of coal-fired thermal power plants is considered an environmental pollutant {{if it is to}} be disposed of and requires considerate financial liabilities on fly ash producers for its safe disposal. But fortunately, because of its physical and chemical properties, it has found applications in many fields; like mineral extraction, soil stabilization, waste treatment and as a supplementary cementitious material. As cement industry is responsible for 5 - 7 % of global greenhouse gas emissions, application of fly ash as a cement replacement material provides the dual benefit of cutting down the greenhouse gas emissions and in increasing the utilization rate of fly ash produced worldwide. The majority of global fly ash production falls under class F low calcium category, which has low reactivity. Therefore to improve the performance of fly ash blended cement composites, the researchers have looked at many ways like; reducing the particle size, making use of hydrated lime, silica fume, and Metakaolin, etc. Recently, the use of nanomaterials has been gaining widespread attention of the research community due to their small particle size and high reactivity that help in improving the properties of the concrete at the nanoscale level. The majority of the past research on low calcium, class F fly ash cement composites, concentrated on 60 % or less of fly ash content and there is a great potential for the further improvement in replacement levels. Therefore, our research aimed at developing a cement composite that not only increases the percentage of fly ash content but also considerably increases the cement replacement level having comparable mechanical properties to that of ordinary portland cement (OPC). Based on the review of existing literature, there appeared to be no research available that investigates the effect of micro (silica fume) and nano silica in combination with hydrated lime and set accelerator on high volume fly ash (HVFA) cement composite replacing 80 % of cement. Therefore, our first study was undertaken to fill up this knowledge gap. The fly ash used in this study was micronised using Sturtevant jet mill microniser to produce ultra fine fly ash (UFFA). The research findings show that when UFFA is partially replaced with silica fume (SF) and used in combination with both the set accelerator (SA) and hydrated lime (HL), there is a considerable improvement in its pozzolanic activity resulting in large improvement in its 7 and 28 day compressive strength. On the contrary, nano silica (nS) modified HV-UFFA performed better when used without the SA and HL, resulting in significantly improving its 7 and 28 day compressive strength. The strength achieved at 28 days was at par with that of OPC. The addition of SA and HL to nS modified HV-UFFA blend resulted in the development of high early age microcracking, thereby considerably reducing its 28 day strength compared to that of nS, HV-UFFA and OPC blend not containing HL and SA. The second experiment was planned to look at the effect of different concentrations of nS on raw HVFA cement blends with and without SA and HL, replacing 70 % of cement. The difference in experiment 2 compared to experiment 1 were (i) raw fly ash was used in experiment 2 in lieu of UFFA as micronising fly ash consumes electricity that adds to the carbon footprint (ii) two concentrations of nano silica were used i. e. 5 and 7. 5 % to study the effect of increase in nano silica content on HVFA cement composite. The fly ash content was partially replaced with 5 and 7. 5 % of nS and 5 % HL. The results show that the 7 day strength increased with the increasing amount of nano silica. However, at 28 days both the samples showed approximately the similar improvement in strength. With the addition of set accelerator to nano silica modified HVFA cement blends, there was a considerable reduction in 7 and 28 day compressive strength results. Addition of HL to HVFA cement blend, containing 5 % nS showed no effect on its further strength development. However, when HL was added to the 7. 5 % nS modified HVFA cement coposite, a considerable reduction in its 7 and 28 day compressive strength results were observed. This shows that nS is highly effective in improving the strength of HVFA cement composites when used alone without any additives, but when it is used in combination with either HL or SA, shows no or negative effect on the development of compressive strength of raw fly ash blended cement composites. Looking at the significant improvement in the strength results of HVFA cement composites by incorporating nano silica, the next experiment was planned to looking at the effect of other nano materials on HVFA cement composites. As the major elemental oxides present in OPC are SiO 2, CaO and Al 2 O 3. This experiment was planned to incorporate the nano sized sources of these elemental oxides. Since the reaction of pure CaO is highly thermal in nature and addition of nano CaO would have been highly exothermic and could have introduced high thermal stresses at early ages of curing, nano CaCO 3 was used as a source of CaO. Therefore, the third experiment plan looked at a quantitative comparative study of the effect of 5 % and 7. 5 % of nano silica, 2. 5 % and 5 % of nano alumina (nA) and 2. 5 % and 5 % of nano calcium carbonate (nCC), on the properties of HVFA cement composites, replacing 80 % of cement. The results show that the addition of nS significantly improves the compressive strength of HVFA cement composites and considerably increases the formation and thermal stability of silica-rich hydrogarnet phase, which increases with the increase in nS content. The addition of nCC to HVFA cement composite does not show any effect on the pozzolanic reaction at 7 days of curing but at 28 days considerably improves its pozzolanic reaction, which increases with the increase in nCC content. The performance of nCC in improving the mechanical properties is less pronounced than that of nS. The addition of nA though improves the hydration/pozzolanic reaction of HVFA cement composite, resulting in the improvement in compressive strength, but only if added in small quantities (2. 5 % or less). If it is added in higher amounts, it promotes the formation of Al(OH) 3 gel that severely inhibits the hydration/pozzolanic reaction within the cement matrix. Based on the knowledge gained from the previous experiments, we found that the amorphous nano silica holds a great potential for the development of zero cement composite. That motivated us to design our fourth experiment, replacing 100 % of cement. In the fourth experiment we replaced OPC with slag, which is another industrial by product. Zero cement mix designs were developed incorporating slag, HVFA and various concentrations of nano silica and hydrated lime. The results show that the optimum content of nano silica in a high volume fly ash, slag and HL blend is 5 %. With a further increase in nano silica content although the pozzolanic reaction and the resulting C-S-H/C-A-S-H gel formation increases but it also increase the micro-cracking within the cement matrix, resulting in negatively impacting the strength development. The portlandite added externally in the form of Ca(OH) 2 powder, to the nS modified SCM blend, activates the pozzolanic reaction which increases with the increase in portlandite content. The best mix design containing 5 % nS, 70 % FA and 25 % slag in combination with 15 % HL as an additive, achieved a 28 day compressive strength of 70 % compared to that of OPC. It is to be noted that though this research aimed at minimising the carbon footprint of the cement composites, it was not completely eliminated. The various raw materials that have CO 2 emissions associated with their production are listed below: Nano silica &ndash; As per the information provided by the supplier of Nano silica, it was produced by pyrogenic method, which is highly energy intensive process. It is produced from the flame hydrolysis of silicon tetrachloride (SiCl 4) at ~ 1800 &deg;C temperature. Calcium hydroxide &ndash; Calcium hydroxide is produced commercially by treating lime (CaO) with water (H 2 O). The CaO used in this process is produced by the de-carbonation of limestone (CaCO 3), which releases CO 2 into the atmosphere during production. Ultrafine fly ash (UFFA) &ndash; Though fly ash is a by-product of thermal power plants using coal as a fuel, <b>micronizing</b> the fly ash (i. e. reducing the particle size of the raw fly ash) is an energy intensive process. The Sturtevant jet mill microniser used to reduce the particle size of the raw fly ash runs on electricity which otherwise is produced primarily by the thermal power plants in Australia...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Ganciclovir (GCV) is only {{slightly}} soluble in water and hence oral GCV gives low absolute bioavailability. Liquid precipitation is {{an effective way to}} prepare micro-sized drug particles. The solubility of GCV in several solvents or in aqueous solution at different pH values was determined. According to its solubility behavior, reactive precipitation was suggested as the micronization method of GCV. The mean particle diameter of <b>micronized</b> GCV powder was around 15 ~ 20 µm, smaller than that of raw GCV powder, and the size distribution of <b>micronized</b> GCV was narrower than that of raw GCV. The stirring rate, the type and addition of stabilizing agents seemed to have no significant effect on the particle size of <b>micronized</b> GCV. <b>Micronized</b> GCV showed much faster dissolution rate than raw GCV...|$|R

40|$|In this study, <b>micronized</b> sand is {{selected}} {{as a kind}} of filler to partially replace cement in cementitious materials. This filler is considered as chemically inert material, which can not react with water or hydration products, but still indirectly influences the hydration in a positive way. In the experimental program, non-evaporable water test was carried out to determine the degree of hydration of cement paste with and without <b>micronized</b> sands. The influence of different finenesses of sand particles, 240 m 2 /kg, 400 m 2 /kg and 1300 m 2 /kg, and different curing ages were investigated.

40|$|The {{influence}} of relative humidity (RH) on the cohesion properties of three drugs: salbutamol sulphate (SS), triamcinolone acetonide (TAA), and disodium cromoglycate (DSCG) was investigated using the {{atomic force microscope}} (AFM) colloidal probe technique. <b>Micronized</b> drug particles were mounted in heat-sensitive epoxy resin for immobilization. Multiple AFM force-distance curves were conducted between each drug probe and the immobilized drug particulates at 15, 45, and 75 % RH using Force-Volume imaging. Clear variations in the cohesion profile with respect to RH were observed for all three <b>micronized</b> drugs. The calculated force and energy of cohesion to separate either <b>micronized</b> SS or DSCG increased as humidity was raised from 15 to 75 % RH, suggesting capillary forces become a dominating factor at elevated RH. In comparison, the separation force and energy for <b>micronized</b> TAA particles decreased with increased RH.

40|$|PURPOSE: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} if the combination of <b>micronized</b> purified flavonoid fraction with short-term routine antibiotic and anti-inflammatory therapy was better at reducing the intensity of postoperative symptoms and wound bleeding after a Milligan-Morgan's open hemorrhoidectomy than antibiotic and anti-inflammatory treatment alone. METHODS: Fifty patients were randomly assigned to receive routine antibiotic and anti-inflammatory treatment alone (control patients) or a combination of <b>micronized</b> purified flavonoid fraction with identical antibiotic and anti-inflammatory treatment (<b>micronized</b> purified flavonoid fraction patients). The evolution of symptoms (pain, tenesmus, pruritus, and bleeding) during the postoperative period was assessed by means of patients' self-questionnaires. Each symptom was scored on a graded severity scale from 0 to 3, daily during the first three days of the immediate postoperative period, then at regular intervals (about every 14 days) until postoperative day 60. A global score for evaluation of each postoperative symptom and bleeding was used. The global score for each symptom was the sum of scores for each patient over the study period. The global score for each symptom was compared between the two groups with the Mann-Whitney U test. RESULTS: No significant differences in age, gender distribution, and stage of disease between the two groups were noticed at baseline. Posthemorrhoidectomy symptoms were relieved more rapidly in the <b>micronized</b> purified flavonoid fraction group; during the first three postoperative days, the global score for each symptom was significantly more reduced in the <b>micronized</b> purified flavonoid fraction group. The global scores for each symptom are as follows: pain after 3 days, 6. 16 (SD = 1. 9) in the control group vs. 3. 48 (SD = 1. 8) in the <b>micronized</b> purified flavonoid fraction group (P < 0. 0001); tenesmus, 5. 36 (SD = 1. 8) in the control group vs. 1. 48 (SD = 1. 5) in the <b>micronized</b> purified flavonoid fraction group (P < 0. 0001); pruritus, 4. 04 (SD = 1. 9) in the control group vs. 1. 84 (SD = 1. 4) in the <b>micronized</b> purified flavonoid fraction group (P < 0. 0001); bleeding, 4. 4 (SD = 2. 1) in the control group vs. 2. 0 (SD = 1. 3) in the <b>micronized</b> purified flavonoid fraction group (P < 0. 0001). A significant difference (P < 0. 0001) between groups was also shown in favor of <b>micronized</b> purified flavonoid fraction patients when global scores were calculated over the entire study period (60 days). CONCLUSION: <b>Micronized</b> purified flavonoid fraction used in combination with short-term antibiotic and anti-inflammatory treatment can reduce both the duration and extent of postoperative symptoms and wound bleeding following hemorrhoidectomy...|$|R
40|$|As {{previously}} reported, {{magnesium sulphate}} administered parenterally significantly increased an opioid antinociception in {{different kinds of}} pain. Since the typical form of magnesium salts are poorly and slowly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract we examined whether their <b>micronized</b> form could increase opioids induced antinociception. In behavioural studies on rats morphine, tramadol and oxycodone together with magnesium (lactate dihydrate, hydroaspartate, chloride) in <b>micronized</b> (particles of size D 90 < 50 μm) and conventional forms were used. Changes in pain thresholds were determined using mechanical stimuli. The intestinal absorption of two forms of magnesium lactate dihydrate (at the doses of 7. 5 or 15 mg ions) in the porcine gut sac model were also compared. <b>Micronized</b> form of magnesium lactate dihydrate or hydroaspartate but not chloride (15 mg of magnesium ions kg- 1) enhanced the analgesic activity of orally administered opioids, significantly faster and more effective {{in comparison to the}} conventional form of magnesium salts (about 40 % for oxycodone administered together with a <b>micronized</b> form of magnesium hydroaspartate). Moreover, in vitro studies of transport across porcine intestines of magnesium ions showed that magnesium salts administered in <b>micronized</b> form were absorbed from the intestines {{to a greater extent than}} the normal form of magnesium salts. The co-administration of <b>micronized</b> magnesium organic salts with opioids increased their synergetic analgesic effect.

40|$|The {{particle}} {{sizes of}} pharmaceutical substances {{are important for}} their bioavailability. Bioavailability can be improved by reducing the particle size of the drug. In this study, artemisinin was <b>micronized</b> by {{the rapid expansion of}} supercritical solutions (RESS). The particle size of the unprocessed white needle-like artemisinin particles was 30 to 1200 µm. The optimum micronization conditions are determined as follows: extraction temperature of 62 °C, extraction pressure of 25 MPa, precipitation temperature 45 °C and nozzle diameter of 1000 μm. Under the optimum conditions, <b>micronized</b> artemisinin with a (mean particle size) MPS of 550 nm is obtained. By analysis of variance (ANOVA), extraction temperature and pressure have significant effects on the MPS of the <b>micronized</b> artemisinin. The particle size of <b>micronized</b> artemisinin decreased with increasing extraction temperature and pressure. Moreover, the SEM, LC-MS, FTIR, DSC and XRD allowed the comparison between the crystalline initial state and the micronization particles obtained after the RESS process. The results showed that RESS process has not induced degradation of artemisinin and that processed artemisinin particles have lower crystallinity and melting point. The bulk density of artemisinin was determined before and after RESS process and the obtained results showed that it passes from an initial density of 0. 554 to 0. 128 g·cm− 3 after the processing.
