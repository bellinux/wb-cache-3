50|$|Simonsen {{then moved}} to Richardson, Texas where, with Jerry Robinson, he co-founded <b>Microbotics,</b> {{manufacturers}} of peripherals for the Amiga platform of home computers. Around 1992 <b>Microbotics</b> closed and he retired from active work, becoming a gaming network moderator for BIX and other places. In 1993 Simonsen contributed to Master of Orion: The Official Strategy Guide (Prima Publishing, 1993), devising a naming-convention for ships. By 1998 he had retired completely and spent his time drawing, writing computer programs and science fiction short stories.|$|E
50|$|<b>Microbotics</b> (or microrobotics) is {{the field}} of {{miniature}} robotics, in particular mobile robots with characteristic dimensions less than 1 mm. The term {{can also be used}} for robots capable of handling micrometer size components.|$|E
50|$|Infrared Control Freak 360 (IRCF360) is a 360 degree {{proximity}} sensor and a motion sensing devices, developed by ROBOTmaker. The sensor is in BETA developers release as a low cost (software configurable) sensor for use within research, technical and hobby {{projects such as}} Maker Faire type projects, <b>Microbotics,</b> Kinetic art / art, crafts, engineering, UAV, Science, Technology and alternative music type of projects.|$|E
50|$|Harvey Ho, {{a former}} {{graduate}} student of Parviz {{who worked at}} Sandia National Laboratories in Livermore, California presented the results in January 2008 at the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers' International Conference on Micro Electro Mechanical Systems (or <b>microbotics)</b> in Tucson, Arizona. The lens {{is expected to have}} more electronics and capabilities on the areas where the eye does not see. Radio frequency power transmission and solar cells are expected in future developments. Recent work augmented contact lens with Wi-Fi connectivity.|$|E
50|$|Potential {{applications}} for swarm robotics are many. They include tasks that demand miniaturization (nanorobotics, <b>microbotics),</b> like distributed sensing tasks in micromachinery or the human body. One {{of the most}} promising uses of swarm robotics is in disaster rescue missions. Swarms of robots of different sizes could be sent to places rescue workers can't reach safely, to detect the presence of life via infra-red sensors. On the other hand, swarm robotics can be suited to tasks that demand cheap designs, for instance mining or agricultural foraging tasks. Also some artists use swarm robotic techniques to realize new forms of interactive art.|$|E
40|$|Vehicles) all require {{accurate}} {{position and}} attitude to be effective. Commercial units range in both cost and accuracy, {{as well as}} power, size, and weight. With the advent of low-cost blended GPS/INS solutions, several new options are available to accomplish the positioning task. In this work, we experimentally compare three commercially available, off-the-shelf units insitu, {{in terms of both}} position, and attitude. The compared units are a <b>Microbotics</b> MIDG-II, a Tokimec VSAS- 2 GM, along with a KVH Fiber Optic Gyro. The position truth measure is from a Trimble Ag 122 DGPS receiver, and the attitude truth is from the KVH in yaw. Care is taken {{to make sure that all}} measurements are taken simultaneously, and that the sensors are all mounted rigidly to the vehicle chassis. A series of measurement trials are performed, including light driving on coastal roads and highway speeds, static bench testing, and flight data taken in a light aircraft both flying up the coast as well as aggressively maneuvering. Allan Variance analysis performed on all of the sensors, and their noise characteristics are compared directly. A table is included with the final consistent models for these sensors, and a methodology for creating such models for any additional sensors as they are made available. The <b>Microbotics</b> MIDG-II demonstrates performance that is superior to the Tokimec VSAS- 2 GM, both in terms of raw positioning data, as well as attitude data. While both perform quite well during flight, the MIDG is much better during driving tests. This is due to the MIDG internal tightly-coupled architecture, which is able to better fuse the GPS information with the noisy inertial sensor measurements...|$|E
