40|$|The Bacillus cereus {{sensu lato}} group is genetically very close and {{possesses}} a remarkable plasmid gene pool that encodes {{a variety of}} functions such as virulence and self-transfer capabilities. The potential for horizontal transfer among the various subspecies of this group, which includes the human opportunistic pathogens B. cereus sensu stricto and B. anthracis {{as well as the}} biopesticide B. thuringiensis, has led to growing concerns regarding food safety and public health. In this study, the conjugative behaviour of B. thuringiensis strains was compared in LB medium, milk and rice pudding using the pXO 16 and pAW 63 conjugative systems, as well as the <b>mobilisable</b> <b>plasmid</b> pC 194, in bi- and triparental matings. Conjugation and mobilisation of these plasmids were shown to occur at significant levels in both food products, attaining the highest transfer frequencies in milk, with an approximately ten-fold increase in conjugative transfer in this growth medium as compared to liquid LB. Furthermore, the ability of an emetic strain of B. cereus to function as either plasmid donor or recipient partner in heterologous biparental matings with B. thuringiensis was demonstrated in these food matrices...|$|E
40|$|Staphylococcus aureus is {{a common}} cause of hos-pital, {{community}} and livestock-associated infections and is increasingly resistant to multiple antimi-crobials. A significant proportion of antimicrobial-resistance genes are plasmid-borne, but only a mi-nority of S. aureus plasmids encode proteins re-quired for conjugative transfer or Mob relaxase pro-teins required for mobilisation. The pWBG 749 fam-ily of S. aureus conjugative plasmids can facili-tate the horizontal transfer of diverse antimicrobial-resistance plasmids that lack Mob genes. Here we reveal that these <b>mobilisable</b> <b>plasmids</b> carry copies of the pWBG 749 origin-of-transfer (oriT) se-quence and that these oriT sequences facilitate mo...|$|R
40|$|Recent characterisations of {{plasmids}} {{related to}} the anthrax virulence plasmids pXO 1 and pXO 2 in clinical isolates of Bacillus cereus and Bacillus thuringiensis {{have contributed to the}} emerging picture of a virulence-associated plasmid pool in the B. cereus sensu lato group. The family of pXO 2 -like plasmids includes the conjugative plasmid pAW 63 from the biopesticide strain B. thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki HD 73 and the heretofore cryptic plasmid pBT 9727 from the clinical strain B. thuringiensis subsp. konkukian 97 - 27. Comparative sequence analysis of these three plasmids suggested that they were derived from an ancestral conjugative plasmid, with pAW 63 retaining its self-transfer capabilities, and pXO 2 having lost them through genetic drift. Such properties had not been investigated in pBT 9727, but sequence homologies led us to predict that it may possess self-transfer capabilities. Here, we report that pBT 9727 is indeed conjugative, and is able to promote its own transfer {{as well as that of}} small <b>mobilisable</b> <b>plasmids...</b>|$|R
40|$|The IncQ is a {{group of}} non-conjugative but <b>mobilisable</b> <b>plasmids</b> that are found and stably {{maintained}} {{in a wide range of}} bacteria contributing to the spread of antimicrobial resistance genes and to the insurgence of multidrug resistant bacteria. Here we report the identification, in clinical Salmonella Typhimurium strains, of an IncQ 1 plasmid (pNUC) which confers resistance to sulfamethoxazole, streptomycin and tetracycline through the presence of sul 2, strAB and tetA genes, respectively. pNUC was detected in five multidrug resistant S. Typhimurium strains collected in Southern Italy from various hospitals and years of isolation. Bioinformatics analyses highlighted the presence of pNUC-like plasmids in pathogenic bacteria of various Enterobacteriaceae genera or species. Taken as a whole, these plasmids constitute a novel group of IncQ 1 plasmids that might have originated through recombination events between a tetR-tetA gene cluster (possibly derived from a Tn 1721) and a recipient IncQ 1 plasmid related to RSF 1010. Our findings raise concerns regarding the possible contribution of the newly identified group of IncQ 1 plasmids to the spread of tetracycline resistance...|$|R
40|$|Conjugation, {{mobilisation}} and retromobilisation {{are three}} related mechanisms of horizontal gene transfer in bacteria. They have been extensively studied in Gram-negative species, where retromobilisation, {{the capture of}} DNA from a recipient by a donor cell, was shown to result from two successive steps: {{the transfer of the}} conjugative plasmid from the donor to the recipient, followed by the retrotransfer of the <b>mobilisable</b> <b>plasmid</b> to the donor. This successive model was established for Gram-negative bacteria but was lacking experimental data from the Gram-positive counterparts. In the present work, mobilisation and retromobilisation abilities of the conjugative plasmid pXO 16 from Bacillus thuringiensis sv israelensis were studied using the mobilisable plasmids pUB 110 and pE 194 and the "non-mobilisable" element pC 194 lacking the mob and oriT features (all from Staphylococcus aureus). Experimental data suggested a successive model since different retromobilisation frequencies were observed between the small plasmids. More importantly, retromobilisation was shown to be delayed by 50 and 150 min for pUB 110 and pE 194, respectively, compared to pXO 16 conjugation. Natural liquid foods (cow milk, soy milk and rice milk) were used to evaluate the putative ecological impact of these transfers. In cow and soy milk, conjugation, mobilisation and retromobilisation were shown to occur at frequencies of 8. 0 x 10 (- 1), 1. 0 x 10 (- 2) and 1. 2 x 10 (- 4) transconjugants per recipient, respectively. These data are comparable to those obtained in LB medium and about 10 -fold lower than in the case of rice milk. Taken together, these results emphasize the potential role of plasmid capture played by B. thuringiensis in natural environments...|$|E
40|$|One {{hundred and}} thirty-six Salmonella enterica strains, {{isolated}} from humans, animals, environmental and plant sources in Australia from 23 serovars, were examined for the streptomycin resistance gene strA and strB, the sulfonamide resistance gene sul 2, and the tetracycline resistance gene tetA(A) and tetA(B). Thirteen strains {{were identified as}} containing the strA-strB genes located on the transposon Tn 5393. S. enterica serovar Hadar accounted for 11 of these strains, 6 of which were isolated from humans and 5 were from ducks. This investigation is therefore the first report of the Tn 5393 transposon being detected in bacterial strains from a human source in Australia. RSF 1010 plasmids were identified and extracted from 4 S. enterica strains, and were further confirmed by restriction enzyme profiling using PstI, SspI and EcoRV. Small non-conjugative plasmid p 9123 was extracted and characterised from 3 of the S. enterica strains and also confirmed by restriction enzyme digestion. An RSF 1010 -like plasmid was also identified in 3 of the strains. This plasmid {{was found to be}} approximately 2. 6 kb larger than RSF 1010, and possibly derived from the RSF 1010 plasmid via insertion of the tetracycline resistance gene tetA(A) between strB and mobC genes. An IS 26 -strB-strA-sul 2 -repC-repA-IS 26 antibiotic resistance region was identified in 33 S. enterica strains, among these were 23 serovar Typhimurium isolates, 8 serovar Bovismorbificans, 1 serovar Senftenberg and 1 isolate where the serovar could not be conclusively identified. The 23 Typhimurium strains were further characterised by PCR and Southern hybridisation analysis using a blaTEM gene probe. The analysis identified two classes of antibiotic resistance gene clusters. Eleven S. enterica serovar Typhimurium strains harboured an IS 26 -strB-strA-sul 2 -repC-repA-IS 26 -blaTEM- 1 -IS 26 antibiotic resistance gene cluster and another 10 S. enterica serovar Typhimurium strains contained an IS 26 -strB-strA-sul 2 -repC-repA-IS 26 -blaTEM- 1 gene cluster, without the IS 26 element downstream of the blaTEM- 1 gene. Two strains contain elements of these gene clusters but further investigation is needed to fully identify these. Further linkage PCR amplifications revealed that the IS 26 -strB-strA-sul 2 -repC-repA-IS 26 -blaTEM- 1 -IS 26 antibiotic resistance gene cluster was possibly inserted into the 3 P-CS of a class 1 integron (In 4 type) and truncated the 3 P-CS region. Three derivatives were identified, of which the dfrA 5 -intI 1 type was most commonly found downstream of the blaTEM- 1 -IS 26 region. Southern hybridisation analysis using an IS 200 gene probe revealed that strains which contain different antibiotic resistance gene clusters also display different but related IS 200 profiles. The antibiotic resistance gene clusters of 19 S. enterica serovar Typhimurium strains were transferred to an E. coli 294 Rifr recipient either by direct mating or triparental mating methods. These experiments confirmed that the antibiotic resistance gene clusters were located on conjugative or <b>mobilisable</b> <b>plasmids.</b> The antibiotic resistance gene clusters of 4 S. enterica serovar Typhimurium strains could not be transferred to the E. coli 294 Rifr recipient. These experimental results suggest that the antibiotic resistance gene cluster of IS 26 -strB-strA-sul 2 -repC-repA-IS 26 -blaTEM- 1 -IS 26 might move as one genetic element between distinct plasmid backbones...|$|R
40|$|Antibiotic {{resistance}} in bacteria {{is a growing}} threat to global health. Many of the genes responsible for resistance are carried on mobile genetic elements which can be transferred laterally between strains and species. The {{most important of these}} are conjugative and <b>mobilisable</b> elements including <b>plasmids</b> and integrating and conjugating elements, ICEs. Haemophi/us influenzae is an important human pathogen, which was first identified as carrying antibiotic resistance genes in the 1970 s. Much of this resistance is encoded by ICEHin 1056, which is present in H. influenzae strains worldwide. The aims of this study were to describe features of the biology of ICEHin 1056, with particular reference to the genetic site and control mechanisms responsible for instigating conjugative transfer. The origin of transfer has been localised to a sequence on ICEHin 1056 and an environmental stressor initiating conjugative transfer, oxidative stress, has been identified. In addition, detailed phylogenetic analysis has demonstrated ICEHin 1056 {{to be part of a}} much larger family of mobile genetic elements, widely distributed in proteobacteria and carrying accessory genes responsible for survival in adverse environments, virulence and antibiotic resistance. The ICEs in the family have conserved homology of gene content and synteny of gene arrangement over deep evolutionary time, challenging the accepted paradigm of modular mosaicism of mobile genetic elements. A key event in increasing dissemination of the ICE, acquisition of a phage type integrase gene has also been identified. The findings presented provide significant insight into the behaviour of ICEs and may in future allow predictions about the spread of virulence factors and antibiotic resistance genes, with important implications for human and animal health.
