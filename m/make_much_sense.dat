25|$|Although {{the first}} {{electric}} railway between Retiro and Tigre was inaugurated in 1916, major electrification projects were not adopted. The large {{size of the}} country, its long distances and flat topography mean that major electrification does not <b>make</b> <b>much</b> <b>sense</b> economically, although some suburban networks in Buenos Aires Metropolitan Area were electrified. After several decades of the Buenos Aires rail-service being under-funded, there is presently an ongoing modernistion plan so as to provide much needed improvement in services, and the trend is towards electrification of several lines. Similarly, ongoing maintenance and investment has continued on existing electric lines, such as with the $845 million purchase of 705 CSR electric multiple unit cars from China for the Mitre, Sarmiento and Roca lines in 2013.|$|E
25|$|As a {{military}} term, the word quijote refers to cuisses, {{part of a}} full suit of plate armour protecting the thighs. The Spanish suffix -ote denotes the augmentative—for example, grande means large, but grandote means extra large.

25|$|There is {{controversy}} in the academic world though as to who is really {{the topic of the}} machinations of the Gallo-Romano Aristocracy after the death of Avitus who was of Gallic origin and from amongst their own ranks. Many scholars old and new have either read the name of the event Marcellini, Marcelliniana instead of Marcellana. This does not <b>make</b> <b>much</b> <b>sense</b> to place Marcellinus as the person in question for this action of the Gallic aristocracy since he is not Gallic and most likely comes from a wealthy Dalmatian family. The assumption to place Marcellinus as the person being spoken of has only led others to assume then that he is Gallic in origin when there is absolutely no evidence to support this. Mathisen has shown that Marcellinus cannot be the person in question and that Apollinaris Sidonius was speaking of a Marcellus, who was a Gallic aristocrat. He demonstrates why Marcellinus cannot logically be the person in question by comparing other names written by the same author and showing that Sidonius using the same style in writing the names thus giving the support it is Marcellus not Marcellinus he speaks of.|$|E
500|$|The {{amendment}} {{removed the}} stigma of not being considered purebred from American-bred horses. A major consideration was that by the late 1940s most of the horses with suspect pedigrees were so far back in most horses' ancestry {{that it no longer}} made much sense to exclude them. Neither did it <b>make</b> <b>much</b> <b>sense</b> to exclude some of the most successful racehorses in Europe from registration. Weatherby's further amended its regulations in 1969, introducing the word [...] "thoroughbred" [...] to describe the horses registered in previous volumes of the General Stud Book.

The review concluded that [...] " [...] doesn't <b>make</b> <b>much</b> <b>sense</b> at all, and it doesn't have to — she’s Alexandra Stan, damnit". Hitfire praised the refrain and the strophes of the tune, but criticized its drop and main part, confessing that they [...] "destroy the song a little bit". Spanish music website Melty eventually named the recording [...] "great", foreseeing it successful in European clubs. Daring To Do provided a negative review for [...] "I Did It, Mama!", {{saying that it was}} [...] "boring" [...] and confessing that its radio potential was [...] "below zero".

500|$|Later that year, Farrell {{played the}} main {{antagonist}} in the Fright Night remake, joining Anton Yelchin, David Tennant and Toni Collette {{in the story}} of a charismatic vampire who moves next door to a high-school student and his single mother. The film was released by DreamWorks, with Craig Gillespie (of Lars and the Real Girl) directing a script by Buffy the Vampire Slayer writer Marti Noxon. Sukhdev Sandhu of the Telegraph wrote that Farrell [...] "proves his comedy credentials once more....utterly seductive as the plushly eyebrowed carpenter-cum-bloodsucker", while the New York Timess A.O.

[...] Raymund Flandez for The Wall Street Journal was equally positive regarding Chenoweth's role, praising her [...] "powerful voice", [...] "kittenish mien" [...] and [...] "commanding presence". Flandez deemed the performance of [...] "Somebody to Love" [...] the show's best number since [...] "Don't Stop Believin debuted in the pilot episode. Mike Hale of the New York Times similarly stated that [...] "The Rhodes Not Taken" [...] was [...] "the best episode musically since the pilot", calling the performance of [...] "Somebody to Love" [...] "truly rousing". TV Guide included the renditions of [...] "Somebody To Love" [...] and [...] "Maybe This Time" [...] in its list of Glee best performances so far. Jarett Wieselman for the New York Post called the episode: [...] "the smartest, funniest, heart-warmingest, song-tastic-est episode of the show yet." ...|$|E

He argues that because spelling was not consistent in Shakespeare's time {{there is no way of}} knowing for sure whether it was to her or not. He does think it is plausible that such a pun on her name exists within this sonnet since he does make other puns in various other sonnets.|$|R

500|$|Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club was {{critical}} of Emma in the show's second season. He said: [...] "Emma is apparently married, but we haven’t seen her husband since October, and {{even when he was}} more of a “fixture” on the show (which is difficult to say about a character who’s appeared as little as Carl Howell has), his relationship with Emma made no sense as anything other than a plot device. Now, as it turns out, Emma and Carl haven’t consummated their marriage at all, and this {{has something to do with}} the fact that the show has combined Emma’s germ-phobia and virginity into some sort of terrifying psychosexual pathology that doesn’t <b>make</b> <b>much</b> <b>sense</b> and doesn’t resemble the somewhat levelheaded person she used to be. (The plotting in Will Schuester’s love life is the one place where the show attempts to have even a modicum of continuity, for whatever reason.) Anyway, Carl is necessarily upset about this, and he’s also upset when Holly Holliday gets Emma to admit that she still has confusing feelings for Will, so he resolves to let her stay in the condo while he stays in the Radisson where all of the good big-name Glee guest stars go to hope their pilots for the fall are picked up." ...|$|E
500|$|Gillian Anderson {{described}} [...] "Sanguinarium" [...] as [...] "one of {{the most}} repulsive scripts I ever shot", explaining {{that she could not}} watch scenes such as the doctor stabbing a patient. David Duchovny stated that [...] "I didn't understand the plot, but I liked the script", noting that Carter and his team improved a weak teleplay and that director Kim Manners [...] "did an excellent job". Entertainment Weekly gave [...] "Sanguinarium" [...] a [...] "B–", feeling that it was [...] "redeemed" [...] by the gore. However, they were [...] "worried" [...] by what they called the [...] "fourth consecutive phoned-in performance by Duchovny and Anderson". Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club was more negative, grading it a [...] "D". He felt that the episode was [...] "too much", and that the gore should have been suggested rather than shown directly. He also criticized the characterization of the characters (especially that of Scully), the [...] "predictable" [...] scares, the [...] "ludicrously bad" [...] dialogue, and a story that did not <b>make</b> <b>much</b> <b>sense.</b> Despite this, he did praise the [...] "strong" [...] guest acting. Sarah Stegall awarded [...] "Sanguinarium" [...] two stars out of five, and criticizing its reliance on gore. Ultimately, she found the conclusion wanting, because the [...] "good" [...] magic seemed useless; she wrote, [...] "Where's the logic in that?"

500|$|On Stranger Tides {{also had}} {{positive}} reviews; some critics found {{the film to}} be entertaining and well-made. Richard Roeper gave the film a B+, describing it as [...] "the most fun installment since the first", calling the story [...] "pure cartoon, but {{a lot easier to}} follow than the other sequels", and summing as [...] "the franchise is getting tired, but Penelope energizes it." [...] Along the same lines, Ann Hornaday of The Washington Post gave the film three out of four stars, writing that it [...] "feels as fresh and bracingly exhilarating as the day Jack Sparrow first swashed his buckle, infusing new reckless energy into a franchise that shows no signs of furling its sails". She said that Marshall [...] "swiftly and without fuss delivers the action set pieces and eye-popping escapism" [...] and praised Depp, Cruz, and McShane's performances. Ray Bennett from The Hollywood Reporter considered that Marshall [...] "shows terrific flair with all the usual chases and sword fights, and he handles the 3D well", and welcomed Penélope Cruz's character, saying she [...] "brings her Oscar-winning vivacity" [...] and had [...] "lively sexual tension" [...] with Depp. Writing for The Globe and Mail, Rick Groen found the action scenes to range from [...] "merely competent to tritely cluttered", but he was pleased with the overall result, calling McShane a [...] "fresh villain" [...] whose [...] "stentorian tones are welcome anywhere". Variety's Andrew Barker considered the film derivative, but accessible. [...] "It has nary an original idea and still doesn't <b>make</b> <b>much</b> <b>sense,</b> but it's lost all pretensions that it should". He praised Geoffrey Rush, stating that he [...] "not only gets the funniest lines and reaction shots, but also starts to siphon away much of the roguish charm that used to be Depp's stock and trade." ...|$|E
30|$|The {{findings}} {{reported in}} this paper suggest {{that the process of}} communication between humans, which is known to optimize information transfer [2], also creates a bias towards positive emotional content.

Thus, it <b>makes</b> <b>much</b> <b>sense</b> that human languages on average have strong bias towards positive emotions, as we have shown (see Figure 2).
