40|$|After {{almost a}} decade of {{nationalist}} HDZ rule in Croatia, the change of government in 2000 brought pro-minority governance and concrete implementation <b>of</b> <b>minority</b> rights legislation. In 2003, when a reformed HDZ came to power, the new government declared that the unconditional return of all refugees, regardless of their ethnicity {{and the return of}} their property constitutes the priority of its mandate. This shift in the treatment <b>of</b> <b>minorities,</b> particularly the Serb minority which is the second largest ethnic community in the country, is closely linked to the fact of the country’s key foreign policy priority of joining the European Union. Since the current government is striving to legitimize its mandate by supporting the country’s entry into the European Union, the state is obliged to comply with all conditionality policies pursued by the Union, including respect for and protection <b>of</b> <b>minorities.</b> This paper examines how the issue <b>of</b> <b>minority</b> protection was perceived and realized in Croatia in thirteen years of the country’s independence by tracing amendments in Croatian legislation for minority protection. The paper emphasises that even though the potential accession to the European Union has motivated politicians to publically advocate the proper inclusion <b>of</b> <b>minorities,</b> the majority <b>of</b> Croatians remain reluctant to accept the need for minority protection. The domestic legislative framework has been brought in line with international minority protection standards, and implementation <b>of</b> <b>minority</b> rights has become more active. Nevertheless, the absence <b>of</b> broad <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> <b>minorities</b> constitutes major obstacle for the true realization <b>of</b> <b>minority</b> rights in Croatia...|$|R
40|$|Aim of {{the study}} : The paper {{presents}} the results of examining the level <b>of</b> <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> the illness in cancer patients using the <b>Acceptance</b> <b>of</b> Illness Scale (AIS). Materials and methods: The study involved cancer patients treated at the Central Clinical Hospital of the Ministry the Interior in Warsaw in 2014. The questionnaire comprised basic demographic questions (socio-economic factors) and the AIS test estimating the level <b>of</b> illness <b>acceptance</b> in patients. Results : For the group of patients in the research group, the arithmetic mean amounted to 27. 56 points. The period of time that elapsed between the first cancer diagnosis and the start {{of the study}} did not influence the score of accepting illness. The <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> illness in patients diagnosed with metastases differed from the <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> illness by patients diagnosed with metastatic cancer. Females obtained the average of 29. 59 in the AIS test, whereas the average in male patients was 26. 17. The patients’ age did not impact the AIS test. There were no differences in the AIS test results between a group of people with secondary education and a group of people with higher education. There were no differences in the AIS test results between employed individuals versus pensioners. The inhabitants of cities were characterized by the highest degree <b>of</b> <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> their health condition. The lowest degree <b>of</b> <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> illness was observed in the group with the lowest average incomes. In the group of married individuals the average degree <b>of</b> <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> illness amounted to 27. 37 points. The average degree <b>of</b> <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> illness in patients that declared themselves as single amounted to 25. 75. Conclusions : The average degree <b>of</b> <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> illness in the study group was 27. 56 points, which is a relatively high level <b>of</b> <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> cancer. The main socio-economic factor, which influenced the AIS test results was whether metastases were diagnosed or not. There were no differences between patients in groups where the time that elapsed from the first diagnosis of cancer varied. There were no statistical differences between female and male patients as well as patients of different age. Additionally, the level of education and patients’ professional status did not impact in the AIS test results...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Human {{functioning}} {{is based}} on physical, psychological, social and spiritual areas. The emergence of cancer and all types of problems affect these areas. Adapting to cancer {{is very important for}} the process <b>of</b> therapy, and <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> the disease is its determinant. Aim of the research study : To determine the relationship between oncological patients physical fitness and their <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> the disease. Material and methods: The following research techniques and tools have been used: a questionnaire survey, the Repta operation scale for assessing the functionality of patients {{in the course of the}} disease, a modified Pain Assessment Worksheet for evaluating the intensity of pain and its impact on daily activities and the AIS scale to assess the degree <b>of</b> <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> the disease. Results: Most of the respondents were fully efficient in the field of the activities of daily living. The vast majority of respondents did not feel pain, or felt pain that could be taken lightly. Pain that made daily functioning difficult, particularly in mobility and locomotion, concerned only persons over 60 years old. In the study group there was dominantly an average degree <b>of</b> <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> the disease; a small group was marked by a high level, and only a few people showed a lack <b>of</b> <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> the disease. Independent people and people in need of assistance accepted the illness at a medium level, and vulnerable patients showed the lowest level <b>of</b> <b>acceptance.</b> Conclusions : The efficiency of patients with cancer affects the level <b>of</b> <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> the disease. Cancer for the majority of respondents is not an obstacle in performing basic activities. Most respondents accept the disease, a small part selects a high level, and only a few people show a lack <b>of</b> <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> the disease...|$|R

Utilising a sample of 360 respondents drawn from academic and managerial staff the study sought to test for male-female {{differences in}} the <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> change, explore for male-female {{differences in the}} major factors that affect <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> change, and to test for male-female differences in {{the effects of the}} major determinants <b>of</b> <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> organizational change. Self-administered questionnaires were used to collect the data required for the study. The bulk of the data were analysed using SPSS statistical package with the t-test and regression (beta) coefficients ~s the key test statistics. The study showed that the overall <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> organizational change among employees was moderate with male and female employees being equally likely to accept the changes taking place at the workplace. However, the sexes differed significantly in the levels of 10 of the 20 determinants <b>of</b> <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> change analysed with women, relative to men, being substantially lower in promotional opportunity, work overload, job-skill match, participative management, trust in leadership, receptivity, and in job satisfaction and higher in routinization, enthusiasm, and desire to leave. Results for regression analyses showed that eight (8) of 19 substantive variables were significant determinants <b>of</b> <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> change for all employees. However, separate regression models for men and women revealed that 11 of 19 substantive factors were significant determinants <b>of</b> <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> change for males compared to two factors for females.

5000|$|A counteroffer {{is a new}} {{offer that}} varies {{the terms of the}} {{original}} offer. Therefore, it is simultaneously a rejection of the original offer.
