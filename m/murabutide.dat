40|$|Adjuvant-active <b>murabutide</b> (N-acetylmuramyl-L-alanyl-D-glutamine-alpha-n-butyl ester), {{devoid of}} {{the side effects of}} muramyl {{dipeptide}} (N-acetylmuramyl-L-alanyl-D-isoglutamine), was administered in saline with natural and synthetic hepatitis B surface antigens (HBsAgs). This derivative enhanced the antibody responses against natural HBsAg. The persistence of high antibody titers was the same in the murabutide-treated group as in the alum-treated group. A synergistic enhancement of the antibody was obtained when both adjuvants were administered together. Cell-mediated immunity to HBsAg, tested by the proliferative response of lymph node cells to the antigen, was also shown to be induced in mice treated with alum-associated <b>murabutide.</b> When administered with natural HBsAg, <b>murabutide</b> produced titers of total antibodies as high as did alum but lower titers of specific immunoglobulin E. High levels of antipeptide antibodies were obtained when a synthetic fragment [HBsAg(99 - 121) ] conjugated to a toxoid carrier was administered with <b>murabutide</b> in saline...|$|E
40|$|<b>Murabutide</b> {{is a safe}} {{synthetic}} immunomodulator {{derived from}} muramyl dipeptide, the smallest bioactive unit of bacterial peptidoglycan. Although {{it is well known}} that muramyl peptides modulate the functions of monocytes/macrophages, their activity on dendritic cells is poorly documented. We thus investigated the effects of <b>Murabutide</b> on immunophenotype, endocytosis, T-cell stimulatory capacity, and cytokine secretion of human monocyte-derived immature dendritic cells (iDCs). We found that <b>Murabutide</b> triggers immunophenotypic changes as upon treatment, iDCs up-regulate the surface expression of the major histocompatibility complex type II molecule human leucocyte antigen-DR, the co-stimulatory molecules CD 80, CD 86 and CD 40 and the differentiation marker CD 83, and down-regulate the expression of the mannose receptor. These phenotypic changes are also mirrored by changes in their biological activity. Subsequent to treatment with the synthetic immunomodulator, DC have a decreased endocytic capacity but exhibit enhanced stimulatory capacity for both allogeneic and autologous T cells. In addition, Murabutide-stimulated iDCs have a greater cytostatic activity toward the tumour cell line THP- 1. Furthermore, in the presence of <b>Murabutide,</b> DCs transiently increased the release of macrophage inhibitory protein- 1 β, tumour necrosis factor-α and interleukin- 10, whereas the enhanced production of macrophage-colony stimulating factor was sustained over the 3 -day period analysed. In addition, <b>Murabutide</b> triggers the phosphorylation of the three classes of mitogen-activated protein kinases in iDCs. Altogether our results demonstrate that <b>Murabutide</b> triggers the maturation and activation of monocyte-derived iDCs. As this immunomodulator is approved for administration in humans, it could be a useful adjunct to boost the efficacy of DC-based vaccines designed against tumours or virus-infected cells...|$|E
40|$|A {{synthetic}} peptide whose sequence {{was derived from}} the circumsporozoite protein of Plasmodium knowlesi coupled to bovine gamma globulin {{has been shown to be}} immunogenic when administered with Freund complete adjuvant. The present experiments were designed to test the immunogenicity of the peptide when attached to a tetanus toxoid carrier and administered with alum or <b>murabutide,</b> both acceptable clinical adjuvants. In both cases, the use of an adjuvant increased the levels of circulating anti-peptide antibodies over those observed when no adjuvant was used. However, when the antisera were tested for reactivity with the native protein, animals of the group receiving the conjugate associated with <b>murabutide</b> always had titers greatly exceeding those observed in animals that received the conjugate with alum. Moreover, the sera of the murabutide-treated group were shown to be more active in eliciting shedding of the circumsporozoite protein than were sera of animals of the Freund complete adjuvant-treated group. The use of tetanus toxoid in secondary immunizations could be eliminated when the mice primed with peptide-tetanus toxoid and <b>murabutide</b> were boosted with a polymer of the peptide. The results indicate that the synthetic malarial peptide-tetanus toxoid conjugate is capable of stimulating high levels of biologically active antibodies only when administered with <b>murabutide...</b>|$|E
40|$|Despite {{the great}} efforts put into their development, {{the list of}} {{clinically}} approved immunological adjuvants is still very short. Evolution of {{the knowledge of the}} immune system has enabled for rational design of novel adjuvants and has led to the conclusion that more than one type of adjuvant will be required. Derivatives of muramyl dipeptide (MDP), the minimal immunomodulatory structure of bacterial cell wall peptidoglycan, have gained considerable attention in the past decades, because of their potent adjuvant effects. <b>Murabutide</b> is a safe derivative of MDP, which interacts with cells of the immune system, both innate and adaptive, and exerts its effect through activation of Nod 2. The transcriptional response of murabutide-stimulated macrophages revealed enhanced expression of genes coding for various proteins such as immune mediators and their receptors, transcription factors and kinases, ion channels/transporters and proteins involved in cell metabolic activity, thus reflecting a broad spectrum of biological effects. In addition to its well recognized adjuvant effect, <b>murabutide</b> has also been shown to enhance the host 2 ̆ 7 s resistance against microbial infections, nonspecific resistance against tumors and the induction of cytokines and chemokines implicated in enhancing the immune response and hematopoesis. This article provides an insight into the mechanism of action of <b>murabutide</b> and its interactions with the cells of the immune system in vitro and in vivo. On account of its numerous biological effects, <b>murabutide</b> {{has been the subject of}} several clinical studies. Many of these have confirmed its potential to synergize with cytokines of therapeutic interest in potentiating the tumoricidal activity of macrophages or targeting chronic viral diseases, as well as reducing the cytokine dosage needed to achieve a therapeutic effect. This review covers the findings of all relevant studies and focuses on the role of <b>murabutide</b> and its potential in the treatment of several microbial diseases...|$|E
40|$|Macrophages and {{dendritic}} {{cells are}} known {{to play an important}} role in the establishment and persistence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Besides antiretroviral therapy, several immune-based interventions are being evaluated with the aim of achieving better control of virus replication in reservoir cells. <b>Murabutide</b> is a safe synthetic immunomodulator presenting a capacity to enhance nonspecific resistance against viral infections and to target cells of the reticuloendothelial system. In this study, we have examined the ability of <b>Murabutide</b> to control HIV type 1 (HIV- 1) replication in acutely infected monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) and dendritic cells (MDDCs). Highly significant suppression of viral replication was consistently observed in Murabutide-treated cultures of both cell types. <b>Murabutide</b> did not affect virus entry, reverse transcriptase activity, or early proviral DNA formation in the cytoplasm of infected cells. However, treated MDMs and MDDCs showed a dramatic reduction in nuclear viral two-long terminal repeat circular form and viral mRNA transcripts. This HIV- 1 -suppressive activity was not mediated by inhibiting cellular DNA synthesis or by activating p 38 mitogen-activated protein kinase. Furthermore, Murabutide-stimulated cells expressed reduced CD 4 and CCR 5 receptors and secreted high levels of β-chemokines, although neutralization of the released chemokines did not alter the HIV- 1 -suppressive activity of <b>Murabutide.</b> These results provide evidence that a clinically acceptable immunomodulator can activate multiple effector pathways in macrophages and in dendritic cells, rendering them nonpermissive for HIV- 1 replication...|$|E
40|$|We have {{previously}} {{observed that the}} synthetic immunomodulator <b>Murabutide</b> inhibits human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1) replication at multiple levels in macrophages and dendritic cells. The present {{study was designed to}} profile the activity of <b>Murabutide</b> on CD 8 -depleted phytohemagglutinin-activated lymphocytes from HIV- 1 -infected subjects and on the outcome of HIV- 1 infection in severe combined immunodeficiency mice reconstituted with human peripheral blood leukocytes (hu-PBL-SCID mice). Maintaining cultures of CD 8 -depleted blasts from 36 patients in the presence of <b>Murabutide</b> produced dramatically reduced levels of viral p 24 protein in the supernatants. This activity correlated with reduced viral transcripts and proviral DNA, was evident in cultures harboring R 5, X 4 -R 5, or X 4 HIV- 1 isolates, was not linked to inhibition of cellular DNA synthesis, and did not correlate with β-chemokine release. Moreover, c-myc mRNA expression was down-regulated in Murabutide-treated cells, suggesting potential interference of the immunomodulator with the nuclear transport of viral preintegration complexes. On the other hand, daily treatment of HIV- 1 -infected hu-PBL-SCID mice with <b>Murabutide</b> significantly reduced the viral loads in plasma and the proviral DNA content in human peritoneal cells. These results are the first to demonstrate that a clinically acceptable synthetic immunomodulator with an ability to enhance the host's nonspecific immune defense mechanisms against infections can directly regulate cellular factors in infected lymphocytes, leading to controlled HIV- 1 replication...|$|E
40|$|Natural and {{synthetic}} adjuvants of microbial origin were compared for {{their capacity to}} potentiate the induction of experimental autoimmune thyroiditis (EAT) with the autoantigen mouse thyroglobulin (MTg). Regardless of the immunomodulator used, severe thyroiditis was observed only in EAT-susceptible strains of the k haplotype and not in EAT-resistant strains of the d haplotype. Compared to phenol-extracted lipopolysaccharide, a potent adjuvant for enhancing EAT induction, phthalyl-substituted, detoxified lipopolysaccharide, even at doses 15 - to 50 -fold greater, led to only low anti-mouse thyroglobulin titers and mild thyroid infiltration. The synthetic adjuvant N-acetylmuramyl-L-alanyl-D-isoglutamine (MDP) and three of its analogs, N-acetylmuramyl-L-alanyl-D-isoglutamine-L-alanyl-D-glycerol mycolate (MDP-L-Ala-Glyc-Myc), N-acetylmuramyl-L-alanyl-D-glutamyl-(decyl) methyl ester [MDP(decyl) methyl], and N-acetylmuramyl-L-alanyl-D-glutamine-alpha n-butyl ester [MDP-(Gln) -OnBu], designated <b>murabutide,</b> were tested in incomplete Freund adjuvant or in saline. In incomplete Freund adjuvant, MDP-L-Ala-Glyc-Myc was inefficient in inducing EAT, <b>murabutide</b> induced very mild involvement, and MDP and, more so, MDP(decyl) methyl were active but {{to a lesser degree}} than CFA. When saline was used, low levels of thyroid infiltration were observed in a few of the MDP-treated animals in only one experiment, whereas no lesions were observed when <b>murabutide</b> was used...|$|E
40|$|Subunit {{vaccines}} against anthrax {{based on}} recombinant protective antigen (PA) potentially offer more consistent and less reac-togenic anthrax vaccines but require adjuvants to achieve optimal immunogenicity. This {{study sought to}} determine in a murine model of pulmonary anthrax infection whether the polysaccharide adjuvant Advax or the innate immune adjuvant <b>murabutide</b> alone or together could enhance PA immunogenicity by comparison to an alum adjuvant. A single immunization with PA plus Advax adjuvant afforded significantly greater protection against aerosolized Bacillus anthracis Sterne strain 7702 than three immunizations with PA alone. <b>Murabutide</b> had a weaker adjuvant effect than Advax when used alone, but whenmurabutide was formulated together with Advax, an additive effect on immunogenicity and protection was observed, with complete protection after just two doses. The combined adjuvant formulation stimulated a robust, long-lasting B-cell memory response that pro-tected mice against an aerosol challenge 18 months postimmunization with acceleration of the kinetics of the anamnestic IgG response to B. anthracis as reflected by 4 -fold-higher anti-PA IgG titers by day 2 postchallenge versus mice that received PA with Alhydrogel. In addition, the combination of Advax plus <b>murabutide</b> induced approximately 3 -fold-less inflammation than Alhydrogel as measured by in vivo imaging of cathepsin cleavage resulting from injection of ProSense 750. Thus, the combina-tion of Advax andmurabutide provided enhanced protection against inhalational anthrax with reduced localized inflammation, making this a promising next-generation anthrax vaccine adjuvanting strategy. Bacillus anthracis is a spore-forming, Gram-positive bacteriumthat is the causative agent of anthrax. The primary infectiou...|$|E
40|$|In a {{previous}} study the adjuvant action of a monophosphoryl lipid A, a nontoxic derivative of endotoxic lipopolysaccharide (LPS), {{was found to be}} negated by a monoclonal anti-gamma interferon (anti-IFN-gamma) antibody. The present investigation centered on three other adjuvants of diverse microbial origins, testing for their capacity to affect the release of IFN-gamma as an explanation for their antibody-enhancing action. The adjuvant action of each of the three, a wild-type LPS, synthetic poly(A) -poly(U) complexes, and a synthetic muramyl dipeptide, n-acetylmuramyl-L-alanyl-D-glutaminyl-n-butyl ester (<b>murabutide),</b> was transferable by adjuvant-stimulated T cells to normal spleen cells on coculture. Supernatant fluids from these T cells contained increased levels of IFN-gamma. Addition of a monoclonal anti-IFN-gamma antibody to adjuvant-stimulated spleen cell cultures reduced the adjuvant action by approximately one-half. Removal of natural killer cells from spleen cell populations prior to culture with antigen had no effect on the enhancement induced by LPS and monophosphoryl lipid A. It was concluded that the enhancement induced by the adjuvants LPS, poly(A) -poly(U), and <b>murabutide</b> is mediated in part by their action on T cells resulting in release of IFN-gamma suggesting activation of a common transmembrane signal...|$|E
40|$|A nonpyrogenic desmuramyl peptidolipid, 1 -O-(L-alanyl-D-isoglutaminyl-L-alanyl-glycerol-mycolate), had {{previously}} {{been shown to be}} inactive as adjuvant in guinea pigs, but to be very active in stimulating nonspecific resistance. We now show that 1 -O-(L-alanyl-D-isoglutaminyl-L-alanyl-glycerol-mycolate) is capable of enhancing or suppressing the immune responses in mice when injected with or before an antigen. In vivo suppression of the immune response to sheep erythrocytes was also observed with high doses of <b>murabutide,</b> a nonpyrogenic adjuvant-active N-acetylmuramyl-L-alanyl-D-isoglutamine analog. Chemiluminescence measurements with mouse spleen cells show a very strong activity of 1 -O-(L-alanyl-D-isoglutaminyl-L-alanyl-glycerol-mycolate) by far superior to the effect obtained with the corresponding muramyl peptide, N-acetylmuramyl-L-alanyl-D-isoglutaminyl-L-alanyl-glycerol-myco late...|$|E
40|$|A {{chemically}} synthesized copy (S-CB 7) of {{a fragment}} (35 amino acid residues) of type 24 streptococcal M protein was covalently linked to polylysine with carbodiimide and injected subcutaneously into rabbits without adjuvant. Although the primary immune responses {{as measured by}} enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays at biweekly intervals were weak, the secondary responses as measured by both enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays and opsonophagocytic assays were as high as those obtained previously in rabbits immunized with the peptide conjugate emulsified in complete Freund adjuvant. Injection of <b>murabutide,</b> a synthetic muramyl dipeptide derivative of bacterial peptidoglycan, with the initial immunizing dose of peptide conjugate had no apparent effect on the secondary immune responses. These results indicate that protective immune responses may be raised against polylysine conjugates of chemically synthesized peptide copies of streptococcal M protein without adjuvant...|$|E
40|$|Four {{synthetic}} peptides that copy {{fragments of}} two bacterial antigens (Streptococcus pyogenes M protein and diphtheria toxin), one viral antigen (hepatitis B surface antigen), and one parasitic antigen (circumsporozoite protein of Plasmodium knowlesi) were covalently bound {{within the same}} construct. This totally synthetic polyvalent administered to mice with Freund complete adjuvant or in saline with <b>murabutide</b> (an adjuvant-active muramyl peptide) elicited high levels of antibodies which, in certain cases, were shown to be biologically active. The results indicated that these antibodies recognized specifically the four peptides. None of the epitopes were immunodominant. It was also demonstrated that the association of several peptides enhanced their respective immunogenicities as {{compared with those of}} their homopolymers. Finally, this study shows that a totally synthetic vaccine administered in saline with a synthetic adjuvant can be immunogenic {{in the absence of a}} protein carrier...|$|E
40|$|<b>Murabutide</b> (MB) is a {{synthetic}} immunomodulator {{recognized by the}} nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing protein 2 (NOD 2) receptor on mammalian cells. MB has previously been approved for testing in multiple human clinical trials to determine its value as an antiviral therapeutic, and as an adjuvant for injected vaccines. We have found a new use for this immunomodulator; it functions as a mucosal adjuvant that enhances immunogenicity of virus-like particles (VLP) administered intranasally. MB enhanced Norwalk virus (NV) VLP-specific IgG systemically and IgA production at distal mucosal sites following intranasal (IN) vaccination. A dose escalation study identified 100 µg as the optimal MB dosage in mice, based on the magnitude of VLP-specific IgG, IgG 1, IgG 2 a and IgA production in serum and VLP-specific IgA production at distal mucosal sites. IN vaccination using VLP with MB was compared to IN delivery VLP with cholera toxin (CT) or gardiquimod (GARD) and to parenteral VLP delivery with alum; the MB groups were equivalent to CT and GARD and superior to alum in inducing mucosal immune responses and stimulated equivalent systemic VLP-specific antibodies. These data support the further testing of MB as a potent mucosal adjuvant for inducing robust and durable antibody responses to non-replicating subunit vaccines...|$|E
40|$|The {{synthetic}} immunomodulator <b>murabutide</b> (MB) presents multiple biological {{activities with}} minimal toxicity in animals and in man. Although MB {{is known to}} target cells of the reticuloendothelial system and to regulate cytokine synthesis, the molecular mechanisms underlying several of its biological effects are still largely unknown. In an effort to define cellular factors implicated in the immunomodulatory and HIV-suppressive activities of MB, we have undertaken profiling the regulated expression of genes in human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) following a 6 -h stimulation with this synthetic glycopeptide. Oligonucleotide microarray analysis was performed on RNA samples of differentiated MDM from four separate donors, using probe sets corresponding to 1081 genes. We have identified, in a reproducible fashion, the enhanced expression of 40 genes and the inhibition of 16 others in MB-treated MDM. These regulated genes belonged to different families of immune mediators or their receptors, transcription factors and kinases, matrix proteins and their inhibitors, ion channels and transporters, and proteins involved in cell metabolic pathways. Additional verification of the regulated expression of selected genes was carried out using Northern blots or the quantification of released proteins in MDM cultures. The profile of MB-regulated genes in MDM provides a molecular basis for some of its previously reported biological activities, and reveals new set of genes targeted by the immunomodulator suggesting potential application in novel therapeutic indications...|$|E
40|$|Intraocular {{inflammation}} (uveitis) {{was produced}} in rabbits by intravenous or subcutaneous treatment with N-acetylmuramyl-L-alanyl-D-isoglutamine and several of its synthetic analogs at doses of {{greater than or equal}} to 0. 2 mg/kg in saline. A dose-dependent increase in permeability of the ocular blood-aqueous barrier as measured by leakage of protein or fluoresceinated dextran from the serum into the eye was observed from 2 to 14 h after glycopeptide treatment. Peak response occurred at approximately 3 h postdose. The lowest dose found to produce maximal vascular leakage for the most active glycopeptide analogs was 1 mg/kg. The adjuvant-inactive L-L stereoisomer of N-acetylmuramyl-L-alanyl-D-isoglutamine was inactive, even at doses as high as 10 mg/kg. Analogs of N-acetylmuramyl-L-alanyl-D-isoglutamine which were homologous in the lactyl side chain were found to cause less uveitis. Chronic biweekly intravenous treatment of rabbits for 1 month with either N-acetyl-L-alpha-aminobutyryl-D-isoglutamine or its lipophilic 6 -O-stearoyl derivative at 1 mg/kg, but not with <b>murabutide,</b> resulted in leukocytic inflammatory lesions unique to the uveal tract of the eye. The uveitis was potentially reversible and occurred with decreased severity as long as 2 months after cessation of chronic treatment. Vascular leakage but not cellular infiltrate in the choroid could be modulated by pharmacologic means. Pyrogenicity but not adjuvanticity correlated with ability of glycopeptides to induce vascular leakage. Several adjuvant-active muramyl dipeptide analogs with minimal ability to cause acute vascular leakage or chronic inflammation in the rabbit eye have been identified...|$|E
