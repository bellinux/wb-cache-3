5|$|Hannibal was now {{isolated}} at {{the northern}} end of the British line, under heavy fire from Formidable as well as the Spanish shore batteries and gunboats and unable to <b>manoeuvre</b> or effectively respond. Ferris attempted to notify Saumarez of his ship's precarious position, but his signal halyards had been torn away by shot and it was sometime before assistance could be organised. The rest of the squadron was ordered to provide ship's boats to attempt to tow Hannibal off the shoal but the attempt failed, Caesars pinnace sinking in the process after being struck by a cannonball. Ultimately, Hannibal was left stranded as the last of the seabreeze disappeared, preventing any of the other British ships from coming to Ferris' assistance. There was however a light land breeze from the northwest that initially favoured the outnumbered and battered French squadron, Linois immediately ordering his ships to sever their anchor cables and use the breeze to <b>manoeuvre</b> slowly into stronger defensive positions closer inshore. His flagship Formidable successfully completed the <b>manoeuvre,</b> but neither Indomptable nor Desaix could be brought back under control in time, and both grounded, Desaix directly in front of Algeciras and Indomptable northeast of Isla Verda with her bow facing out to sea.|$|E
5|$|On {{the night}} of 2–3 June 1969, Melbourne and her escorts were {{involved}} in anti-submarine training exercises in the South China Sea. In preparation for launching a Tracker, Stevenson ordered Evans to the plane guard station, reminded the destroyer of Melbournes course, and instructed the carrier's navigational lights {{to be brought to}} full brilliance. Evans had performed the <b>manoeuvre</b> four times {{over the course of the}} night. Evans was positioned on Melbournes port bow, but began the <b>manoeuvre</b> by turning starboard, towards the carrier. A radio message was sent from Melbourne to Evans bridge and Combat Information Centre, warning the destroyer that she was on a collision course, which Evans acknowledged. Seeing the destroyer take no action and on a course to place herself under Melbournes bow, Stevenson ordered the carrier hard to port, signalling the turn by both radio and siren blasts. At approximately the same time, Evans turned hard to starboard to avoid the approaching carrier. It is uncertain which ship began to <b>manoeuvre</b> first, but each ship's bridge crew claimed that they were informed of the other ship's turn after they commenced their own. After having narrowly passed in front of Melbourne, the turns quickly placed Evans back in the carrier's path. Melbourne hit Evans amidships at 3:15am, cutting the destroyer in two.|$|E

40|$|Ship {{manoeuvrability}} {{is fundamental}} for the navigation safety of ships. Furthermore, through the equipment used for <b>manoeuvring,</b> it also affects investment, operation, and maintenance cost of these ships. Ships are primarily designed {{from an economic}} point of view. To ensure and improve the maritime efficiency, research on inland vessel manoeuvrability deserves more attention than the present situation. Most {{of the research on}} manoeuvrability has been performed for seagoing ships. Since sailing conditions and ship particulars between seagoing ships and inland vessels are different, the impacts of these differences on <b>manoeuvring</b> prediction and evaluation should be carefully considered. Inland vessels should be designed {{in such a way that}} they should always be capable of <b>manoeuvring</b> without significantly harming the cost-effectiveness of operations. One of the biggest differences between seagoing ships and inland vessels is the rudder configuration. Conventionally, seagoing ships have similar single-rudder configurations while inland vessels have more complex multiple-rudder configurations. Although multiple-rudder configurations can have a positive effect on manoeuvrability, they often have a negative effect on resistance and, therefore, also a negative effect on the fuel consumption. Quantitative impacts of the rudder configuration on ship manoeuvrability have not been fully understood, especially for multiple-rudder configurations with complex rudder profiles. These differences in the rudder configuration may significantly change the ship <b>manoeuvring</b> behaviours and, therefore, should require further research. Moreover, to compare and evaluate the <b>manoeuvring</b> performance of inland vessels with different configurations, the existing <b>manoeuvring</b> tests and standards for inland vessels are less elaborate than those for seagoing ships. The above-mentioned considerations formulate the following main research question: What are the proper rudder configurations to achieve well manoeuvrable inland vessels without significant loss of navigation efficiency? The main research question of this thesis can be answered through resolving four key research questions as follows: Q 1. What are the practical <b>manoeuvres</b> to evaluate and compare the <b>manoeuvring</b> performance of inland vessels? Q 2. How does the rudder configuration affect the rudder hydrodynamic characteristics? Q 3. How do changes in the rudder configuration affect the ship manoeuvrability in specific <b>manoeuvres?</b> Q 4. How to choose a proper rudder configuration according to the required <b>manoeuvring</b> performance? An accurate estimation of rudder forces and moments is needed to quantify the impacts of the rudder configurations on ship <b>manoeuvring</b> performance. This thesis applied Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) simulations to obtain rudder hydrodynamic characteristics and integrated the RANS results into <b>manoeuvring</b> models. Additionally, new <b>manoeuvres</b> and criteria have been proposed for prediction and evaluation of inland vessel manoeuvrability. Simulations of ships with various rudder configurations were conducted to analyse the impacts of rudder configurations on ship manoeuvrability in different classic and proposed test <b>manoeuvres.</b> Accordingly, guidance on rudders for inland vessel manoeuvrability has been summarised for practical engineers to make proper design choices. Through the research presented in this thesis, it is clear that different rudder configurations have different hydrodynamic characteristics, which are influenced by the profile, the parameters, and the type of a specific configuration. New regression formulas have been proposed for naval architects to quickly estimate the rudder induced forces and moments in <b>manoeuvring.</b> Furthermore, an integrated <b>manoeuvring</b> model has been proposed and validated for both seagoing ships and inland vessels. Using the proposed regression formulas and <b>manoeuvring</b> model, the impacts of rudder configurations on inland vessel manoeuvrability have been studied. The <b>manoeuvring</b> performance of a typical inland vessel can be improved by 5 % to 30 % by changing the rudder configuration. The rudder configuration should be capable of providing sufficient <b>manoeuvring</b> forces and then optimised to reduce the rudder induced resistance. In general, well-streamlined profiles are good for efficiency but not as good as high-lift profiles for effectiveness. As a summary, the ship <b>manoeuvring</b> performance can be improved by using effective profiles, enlarging the total rudder area, accelerating the rudder inflow velocity, increasing the effective rudder aspect ratios, and enlarging the spacing among multiple rudders.

40|$|The {{superior}} manoeuvrability of hummingbirds {{emerges from}} complex interactions of specialized neural and physiological processes with the unique flight dynamics of flapping wings. Escape <b>manoeuvring</b> is an ecologically relevant, natural behaviour of hummingbirds, {{from which we}} can gain understanding into the functional limits of vertebrate locomotor capacity. Here, we extend our kinematic analysis of escape <b>manoeuvres</b> from a companion paper to assess two potential limiting factors of the <b>manoeuvring</b> performance of hummingbirds: (1) muscle mechanical power output and (2) delays in the neural sensing and control system. We focused on the magnificent hummingbird (Eugenes fulgens, 7. 8 g) and the black-chinned hummingbird (Archilochus alexandri, 3. 1 g), which represent large and small species, respectively. We first estimated the aerodynamic forces, moments and the mechanical power of escape <b>manoeuvres</b> using measured wing kinematics. Comparing active-manoeuvring and passive-damping aerodynamic moments, we found that pitch dynamics were lightly damped and dominated by the effect of inertia, while roll dynamics were highly damped. To achieve observed closed-loop performance, pitch <b>manoeuvres</b> required faster sensorimotor transduction, as hummingbirds can only tolerate half the delay allowed in roll <b>manoeuvres.</b> Accordingly, our results suggested that pitch control may require a more sophisticated control strategy, such as those based on prediction. For the magnificent hummingbird, we estimated that escape <b>manoeuvres</b> required muscle mass-specific power 4. 5 times that during hovering. Therefore, {{in addition to the}} limitation imposed by sensorimotor delays, muscle power could also limit the performance of escape <b>manoeuvres...</b>|$|R
