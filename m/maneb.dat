50|$|The least but not {{the less}} {{important}} management is the chemical control that ensure good control of the disease. The chemical control is basically spraying fungicide {{as soon as the}} symptoms are evident. Compounds registered for using are: chlorothalonil, <b>maneb,</b> mancozeb and copper.|$|E
5000|$|The {{most common}} {{diseases}} affecting S. rostrata are damping-off caused by Pythium spp. and Rhizoctonia spp., Cercospora leafspot caused by Cercospora spp., and leaf mosaic virus.

50|$|Leaf blight {{occurs in}} areas with hot and humid weather. The spores land on onion leaves, {{penetrate}} the skin, and rapidly kill the leaf. This causes a severe reduction in bulb size, as high as 50%, and can happen {{in less than a}} week. Applications of foliar fungicides can be used to control leaf blight. These include azoxystrobin, chlorotholonil copper, mancozeb, <b>maneb,</b> and mefenoxam.|$|E
50|$|Peronospora manshurica infects soybeans, {{reducing}} photosynthetic activity, yield, and quality. The fungus spreads by oospores on diseased leaves and/or on infected seed.

50|$|Downy mildew left {{uncontrolled}} has {{the ability}} to reduce yields by up to 55% and infest up to 80% of plants. Downy mildew is primarily controlled through the use of several fungicides applied during midseason. The fungicides used include azoxystrobin, copper, chlorothalonil, mancozeb, and <b>maneb.</b> Farmers in Florida who regularly use fungicides have been shown to reduce yield losses due to downy mildew to as low as 2%.|$|E
50|$|Southern corn leaf blight {{thrives in}} the {{southern}} United States because unlike NCLB it requires warm weather to develop. During favorable conditions the disease has been documented ruining a whole crop within days when left untreated. Treatment is available {{with the use of}} chlorothalonil, mancozeb, and <b>maneb</b> but even this is limited. In one study in Florida even when a regular fungicide plan was followed over 25% of the ears were lost.|$|E
50|$|Applying {{fungicides}} {{that contain}} chlorothalonil, <b>maneb,</b> mancozeb, or metalaxyl {{as the main}} ingredient on a regular schedule will help to eliminate the pathogen. You can also apply fungicides containing mefenoxam to the soil surface under the vines around 4-8 weeks prior to harvest. A third practice to help control the disease is to spray with another fungicide, difolatan, 4 times over a 10-day period. Soil should be fumigated before anything else is planted in previously-infected soil.|$|E
50|$|Alternaria {{leaf spot}} affects the cabbage plant by causing severe {{spotting}} and discoloration {{to the head}} of the plant. It is only a superficial effect to the plant but because of the black color of the leaf spots the marketability of a severely infected cabbage crop is low. Without control leaf spot is estimated to be able to reduce yields by up to 50%. Alternaria leaf spot is controlled using the same treatment as downy mildew: applications of azoxystrobin, copper, chlorothalonil, mancozeb, and <b>maneb</b> beginning midseason.|$|E
50|$|Downy mildew is an {{extremely}} common disease of the lettuce plant. This {{is largely due to}} the disease's quick germination period—three hours—and the lettuce plant being susceptible at all growth stages. One study estimated that in untreated Florida fields 75% of lettuce was infected with downy mildew and considered unsalable. Research with <b>maneb</b> has shown the ability {{to reduce the number of}} lesions per 10 plants from 187 to about one. EBDC and fosetyl-al have also been shown effective in Florida trials that reduced unmarketable heads to 2%.|$|E
50|$|Downy mildew is an {{extremely}} fast-developing disease in the onion. Studies have observed up to 40% of a field being infected {{in less than three}} days. The first symptoms of the disease are white and purple growths {{on the surface of the}} plant leaves. Eventually these leaves die. This in turn destroys the plant's photosynthetic abilities, stunting growth and sometimes killing the plant. Untreated downy mildew can reduce yields by 65%. Downy mildew is controlled with the same foliar fungicides as leaf blight: azoxystrobin, copper, mancozeb, <b>maneb,</b> and mefenoxam.|$|E
50|$|Almond rust is {{a disease}} of almond trees that is {{characterized}} by angular yellow leaf spots on upper leaf surfaces and rusty brown masses of spores on lower leaf surfaces. It was first discovered in the upper Sacramento Valley area of California but now has subsequently spread throughout both the Sacramento and San Joaquin valley orchards. It typically emerges {{in the summer and}} fall seasons and has been shown to cause rapid and extensive defoliation of trees. Treatments of <b>maneb</b> and sulfur in the early season months (typically spring and summer) have been shown to significantly reduce incidence and severity of rust outbreaks.|$|E
50|$|As {{there are}} many strains, {{northern}} corn leaf blight (NCLB) {{is considered one of}} the most serious and hard to control diseases of sweet corn. Its multiple strains mean it is nearly impossible to attempt any control of NCLB with plant resistance. The symptoms of the disease include long, thin dead areas on the leaf that slowly grow and coalesce. These lesions produce spores that can infect other plants. However much of the spread and severity of the disease is dependent upon weather conditions. Heavy rains, low temperatures, and relatively high humidity increase the number of life cycles of the fungus, producing additional spores. The most common control practice for NCLB is chlorothalonil, <b>maneb,</b> and mancozeb.|$|E
5000|$|In addition, {{multiple}} fungicides {{have been}} seen to reduce Banana Freckle disease. In Hawaii, spraying the leaves and fruit with <b>maneb</b> (1 lb./100 gal water plus 4 oz of sticker-spreader) every 2 weeks or once a month throughout the year has remarkably reduced the spread of inoculum. In Taiwan, spraying fungicides, such as phaltan, orthocide, chlorothalonil, dithiocarbamates, and propiconazole, biweekly have produced effective results against the disease. In the Philippines, chemical controls used against Black or Yellow Sigatoka disease have been helpful. These consist of mancozeb, triazoles, tridemorph, and strobilurin. Mancozeb {{seems to be the}} most effective fungicide against Banana Freckle disease in Hawaii and the Philippines [...] These fungicides do not eliminate the pathogen completely, but they reduce the inoculum levels and eventually reduce yield loss.|$|E
50|$|In Brazil, it is {{recommended}} not to plant seed lots with more than 30 percent black point in order to limit spot blotch. Seed treatment {{may prove to be}} appropriate, although the inoculum remaining on secondary hosts or in the soil may reduce the treatment efficiency. Seed treatments with phytoalexin inducer appeared to provide good protection to wheat seedlings against ''''''B. sorokiniana'''''' infection (Hait and Sinha, 1986). Seed treatment with fungicide will help protect germinating seed and seedlings from fungi causing seedling blights. Fungicide seed treatments include: captan, mancozeb, <b>maneb,</b> thiram, pentachloronitrobenzene (PCNB) or carboxin guazatine plus, iprodione and triadimefon (Stack and McMullen, 1988; Mehta, 1993). Seed-borne inoculum of ''''''P. tritici-repentis'''''' can be controlled with seed-applied fungicides, such as guazatine and guazatine + imazalil, but other chemicals are also effective (Schilder and Bergstrom, 1993).|$|E

40|$|In {{the present}} thesis, {{at the first}} stage, methods were {{developed}} and validated for {{the determination of the}} residues of the fungicide <b>maneb</b> and of its metabolite ethylenethiourea (ETU) in tomatoes and tomato products. Subsequently, the stability of <b>maneb</b> in tomato homogenates during thermal processing and storage was studied. For the determination of ETU a high performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) method combined with photodiode array detection was applied. The method for the determination of <b>maneb</b> residues was based on the measurement of CS 2, released upon acid digestion of the samples, by headspace gas chromatography. <b>Maneb</b> conversion factors to ETU for the thermal treatments of pasterization, sterilization, and cooking and for the industrial lye peeling procedure which is performed at high pH values and high temperatures, ranged from 8 to 32 % (mol/mol), while the percentage of remaining <b>maneb</b> ranged from 85 to 1 %. First-order kinetics adequately described <b>maneb</b> degradation in tomato homogenates in the temperature range from 50 to 90 °C (Ea: 36 ± 4 KJ mol- 1). When the pH of the substrate was adjusted to 9, the degradation of <b>maneb</b> proceeded faster.
