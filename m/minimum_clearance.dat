2500|$|Unskilled labourers and {{soldiers}} could quickly assemble prefabricated [...] sections of track weighing about [...] along roads or over smooth terrain. The track distributed heavy loads to minimize development of muddy ruts through unpaved surfaces. Small locomotives pulled short trains of [...] capacity cars through areas of <b>minimum</b> <b>clearance</b> and small-radius curves. Derailments were common, {{but the light}} rolling stock was relatively easy to rerail. [...] Steam locomotives typically carried a short length of flexible pipe (called a water-lifter) to refill water tanks from flooded shell holes.|$|E

50|$|Since {{overhead}} transmission wires {{depend on}} air for insulation, {{the design of}} these lines requires <b>minimum</b> <b>clearances</b> to be observed to maintain safety. Adverse weather conditions, such as high wind and low temperatures, can lead to power outages. Wind speeds as low as 23 kn can permit conductors to encroach operating clearances, resulting in a flashover and loss of supply.Oscillatory motion of the physical line can be termed gallop or flutter depending on the frequency and amplitude of oscillation.|$|R

50|$|In October 2008, {{a portion}} of the Tunnel was relined by Johnson Western Gunite Company of Seattle, WA using {{shotcrete}} methods. ECI Rail Constructors, Inc. of Williston, VT concurrently lowered the tracks to offset the 6-inch shotcrete layer and to structurally brace the tunnel at the new floor elevation. The new track structure consisted of steel ties and steel reinforcing encased in concrete. The completed work allows for a Plate-C car to pass with required <b>minimum</b> <b>clearances.</b> The project was completed {{at a cost of about}} $1.2 million ($240,000 paid by NECR and $960,000 covered by federal funds).

50|$|An ideal {{steam turbine}} is {{considered}} to be an isentropic process, or constant entropy process, in which the entropy of the steam entering the turbine is equal to the entropy of the steam leaving the turbine. No steam turbine is truly isentropic, however, with typical isentropic efficiencies ranging from 20-90% based on the application of the turbine. The interior of a turbine comprises several sets of blades or buckets. One set of stationary blades is connected to the casing and one set of rotating blades is connected to the shaft. The sets intermesh with certain <b>minimum</b> <b>clearances,</b> with the size and configuration of sets varying to efficiently exploit the expansion of steam at each stage.|$|R

50|$|Conversely, if a ship is {{to safely}} pass under a low bridge or {{overhead}} power cable, the mariner must know the <b>minimum</b> <b>clearance</b> between the masthead and the obstruction, which {{will occur at}} high tide.

50|$|The Kort nozzle is {{a sturdy}} {{cylindrical}} structure around a special propeller having <b>minimum</b> <b>clearance</b> between the propeller blades {{and the inner}} wall of the Kort nozzle. The thrust-to-power ratio is enhanced because the water approaches the propeller in a linear configuration and exits the nozzle the same way. The Kort nozzle is named after its inventor, but many brands exist.|$|E

5000|$|The {{structure}} gauge, {{also called}} the <b>minimum</b> <b>clearance</b> outline, is the minimum height and width of tunnels and bridges {{as well as the}} minimum height and width of the doors that allow a rail siding access into a warehouse. In addition, the term may apply to the minimum distance to railway platforms (passenger or freight), buildings, electrical equipment boxes, railway signal equipment, third rails or to supports for overhead catenaries or overhead lines from the track. The width of a narrow cut can also affect the maximum loading gauge.|$|E

40|$|<b>Minimum</b> foot <b>clearance</b> (MFC) as {{it relates}} to trips and falls has been {{extensively}} researched in many locomotor tasks, but never within the same study/population. Past research on MFC has yielded a wide range of results, which may be due to different placements of shoe markers and/or MFC calculation methods. The purpose {{this study was to determine}} the effects of locomotor task and shoe marker placement on MFC. Ten young adults performed 3 trials of 8 locomotor tasks including obstacle crossing, level change and stair negotiation. Clearance was calculated for 72 points on each shoe, including those most commonly used in past research. <b>Minimum</b> foot <b>clearance</b> was smallest during level change and stair descent and largest during the biggest obstacle crossing tasks. Shoe marker placement was a determining factor for MFC, and the most commonly used shoe marker locations did not experience the actual MFC for most tasks...|$|R
