500|$|In a 1991 Canadian {{television}} interview, Love {{commented on}} the album's coarse musical structure. She said that since the band was from Los Angeles, the [...] "metal capital of the US", {{they thought they were}} making a [...] "pop record with an edge", and were surprised by people's reactions when they were told it was violent and extreme. Love also said, [...] "It was all about the expression of my experience. I was not coming from a black void; I was trying to create light... I was trying to heal." [...] In an interview with Spin magazine several years after its release, Love said that she was [...] "posing in a lot of ways" [...] with the album: [...] "It was the truth, but it was also me catching up with all <b>my</b> <b>hip</b> peers who'd gone all indie on me, and who made fun of me for liking R.E.M. and The Smiths. I'd done the whole punk thing, sleeping on floors in piss and beer, and waking up with the guy with the fucking mohawk and the skateboards and the speed and the whole goddamned thing. But I hated it. I'd grown out of it by the time I was seventeen." [...] In a 1994 interview with Kurt Loder, Love admitted to having been [...] "consciously self-conscious" [...] when making the record due to her feeling the need to compete with her peers at the time.|$|E
2500|$|In August 2009, Blunt {{stated in}} two {{separate}} newspaper interviews that, because he was 59 years old, [...] "In either Canada or Great Britain, if I broke <b>my</b> <b>hip,</b> I couldn't get it replaced." [...] He stated {{he had heard the}} statement in Congressional testimony by [...] "some people who are supposed to be experts on Canadian health care." [...] The PolitiFact service of the St. Petersburg Times reported that it could not find any such testimony.|$|E
2500|$|In a 2000 {{episode of}} The Simpsons {{entitled}} [...] "Pygmoelian", {{there is a}} character who takes Moe's picture for the Duff calendar, introduced by Duffman as [...] "Duff's Vice President in charge of calendars and fake IDs, Phil Angelides." [...] When asked about the episode, the real-life Angelides acknowledged Simpsons creator Matt Groening as [...] "a friend" [...] and said [...] "By the way, that made me very popular among my three daughters. It raised <b>my</b> <b>hip</b> status among all my daughters and their friends." ...|$|E

2500|$|Speaking of {{the musical}} {{background}} to Sex Therapy, Thicke told Pete Lewis – Deputy Editor of Blues & Soul – [...] "I'm always gonna have the influence of Marvin Gaye, Stevie Wonder and Al Green in my music. But with this album I also wanted to show <b>my</b> <b>hip</b> hop side. I {{grew up listening to}} Run-DMC and N.W.A and Biggie and Pac and Jay-Z... So I really wanted to make a record that represented how much that music has influenced me." [...] Earlier in 2009, on October 14, Leighton Meester's debut single [...] "Somebody to Love", featuring Thicke, was released. Thicke told MTV he hoped to have Lil Wayne on the album. He also pointed out that he was featured on Lil Wayne's last two albums, and Lil Wayne was on his last two albums. [...] "We're kind of good luck charms for each other." ...|$|E

5000|$|During {{the music}} video's editing stages, Lopez {{wanted to make}} sure {{everything}} was authentic. She said, [...] "I really worked out and did the diet thing... and then after the video...there's always that one guy who's like [...] "We should retouch this". I was like, [...] "You're going to leave everything the way it is. That's how it wiggles and jiggles in real life, that's how they're going to see it in the video. And I noticed—editors sent video to me and they have shaved off a little bit of <b>my</b> <b>hips</b> and—I was like, [...] "That ain't me—those are not <b>my</b> <b>hips.</b> Just leave them the way they are. Do me a favor—don't touch <b>my</b> <b>hips.</b> Don't try to make me look skinnier. It's fine, it's fine the way it is". And that's what they did." [...] Prior to the clip being released, Jon Wiederhorn of MTV News reported that it was heavily influenced by the 1980s, stating that Lopez [...] "strikes '80s dance moves, and the color, style and camerawork have a decidedly retro vibe".|$|R

60|$|All of {{the boys}} wore long trousers, and even my eight year old brother looked like a {{miniature}} man with his full-length overalls, high-topped boots and real suspenders. As for me I carried a bandanna in <b>my</b> <b>hip</b> pocket and walked with determined masculine stride.|$|E
6000|$|... 'The {{time was}} met. I felt {{the call of}} her breast, and it seemed there I must pillow my head and forget. She opened her arms to me, and I came against her. Then, sudden, the hate flamed in her eye, her hand was at <b>my</b> <b>hip.</b> And once, twice, she passed the knife.|$|E

60|$|Now the {{creature}} {{at my side}} was creeping slowly toward the near-by sea. At <b>my</b> <b>hip</b> hung a long-barreled six-shooter--somehow I {{had been unable to}} find the same sensation of security in the newfangled automatics that had been perfected since my first departure from the outer world--and in my hand was a heavy express rifle.|$|E
6000|$|I fancy this gloomy ramble {{is caused}} by a twinge of age; I put on an under-shirt {{yesterday}} (it was the only one I could find) that barely came under my trousers; and just below it, a fine healthy rheumatism has now settled like a fire in <b>my</b> <b>hip.</b> From such small causes do these valuable considerations flow! ...|$|E
60|$|I {{wondered}} if Raja would {{stand for a}} leash. His head as he paced beside me was level with <b>my</b> <b>hip.</b> I laid my hand upon it caressingly.

6000|$|I mind how once we lay such a {{transparent}} summer morning, [...] How you settled your head athwart <b>my</b> <b>hips</b> and gently turn'd over upon me, [...] And parted the shirt from my bosom-bone, and plunged your tongue [...] to my bare-stript heart, [...] And reach'd till you felt my beard, and reach'd till you held my feet.|$|R

30|$|Body Dissatisfaction was {{measured}} with a subscale of the Eating Disorders Inventory (Garner et al., 1983). The scale contained 9 items designed to measure dissatisfaction with specific body parts. Examples of items include “I think <b>my</b> <b>hips</b> are too big” and “I think that my stomach is just the right size”. Responses were rated on a 6 point scale where 1 [*]=[*]never and 6 [*]=[*]always. Scores ranged from 0 to 54, with higher scores indicating higher dissatisfaction.|$|R
6000|$|... "Aye! thou ugly old toad. He {{has begun}} a new one, for which I have promised to sit. I'll pay for the breakfast he gives me, by donning a {{gorgeous}} gold embroidered doubtlet which he once stole from somewhere, by putting my hand on <b>my</b> <b>hip,</b> tilting my hat at a becoming angle, and winking at him by the hour whilst he paints away." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Before {{we had a}} carriage, yes, it {{was hard}} for me to get about. I had to be helped by the {{conductors}} into the streetcars. I broke <b>my</b> <b>hip</b> when we lived in Steelville, and the doctor was a numbskull. He should be put in prison, is what I tell Adolf. I was standing on a clothes-horse, when it fell. I had much washing to do in those days." ...|$|E
60|$|And as I saw Juag's predicament I saw, too, in {{the same}} instant, a way to relieve him. Leaping quickly {{to the side of}} the fellow I had just felled, I {{snatched}} up my fallen revolver. It was a desperate chance to take, and I realized it in the instant that I threw the gun up from <b>my</b> <b>hip</b> and pulled the trigger. There was no time to aim. Juag was upon the very brink of the chasm. His relentless foe was pushing him hard, beat-ing at him furiously with the heavy knife.|$|E
60|$|Here the Elsinore {{lay down}} to starboard, {{and the water}} in the {{forecastle}} poured out against <b>my</b> legs and <b>hips.</b> <b>My</b> wet mittens slipped on the iron work, and I swept down the runway into the scuppers, where I was turned over and over by another flood that had just boarded from windward.|$|R
50|$|Stephanie Barto, {{a student}} of Nericcio, brought ATS to the Midwest with a group called Read <b>My</b> <b>Hips,</b> founded in Chicago with Heather Stants. Later, during the early {{development}} of Tribal Fusion, Heather Stants worked to introduce new elements to Tribal Style bellydance, including a minimalist aesthetic, underground electronica music and elements of modern dance. In 1999, she formed Urban Tribal Dance Company in San Diego, largely influenced by hip hop and street dance styles. In contrast to many other tribal fusion performers, Urban Tribal Dance Company was known for their minimalist costuming more traditional to modern dance than to Tribal Style.|$|R
5000|$|... 'This morning Fräulein {{and two of}} {{the girls}} laced me in fairly easily to 14½ in...

At all events, I shall have the two dresses mother promised me at Christmas if I came back with a really small waist and a good figure.' ...|$|R
60|$|But {{the land}} breeze {{had begun to}} die away with the rising sun, and now came only in failing puffs. The salmon boat got out its oars and soon left us far astern. Some of the Chinese stood in the forward part of the cockpit, near the cabin doors, and once, as I leaned over the cockpit rail to flatten down the jib-sheet a bit, I felt some one brush against <b>my</b> <b>hip</b> pocket. I made no sign, but {{out of the corner}} of my eye I saw that the Yellow Handkerchief had {{discovered}} the emptiness of the pocket which had hitherto overawed him.|$|E
6000|$|I {{who live}} in England must wear the {{hackneyed}} symbols of the profession, to show that I have (at least) consular immunities, coming as I do out of another land, where they are not so wise as they are here, but fancy that God likes what he makes and is not best pleased with us when we deface and dissemble all that he has given us and put about us to one common standard of----Highty-Tighty!--when was a jester obliged to finish his sentence? I cut so strong a pirouette that all my bells jingle, and come down in an attitude, with one hand upon <b>my</b> <b>hip.</b> The evening's entertainment is over,--"and if our kyind friends----" ...|$|E
60|$|As I buttered a {{piece of}} bread my eyes chanced to rest upon my hand. The {{knuckles}} were skinned and inflamed clear across, the fingers swollen, the nails rimmed with black. I felt the mattress-like growth of beard on my neck, knew that the sleeve of my coat was ripped, that a button was missing from the throat of the blue shirt I wore. The dirk mentioned by Wolf Larsen rested in its sheath on <b>my</b> <b>hip.</b> It was very natural that it should be there,—how natural I had not imagined until now, when I looked upon it with her eyes and knew how strange it and all that went with it must appear to her.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{know all}} about it," [...] Easton said. [...] "I did it three nights ago, and have no skin at present on my knees or my elbows or <b>my</b> <b>hips,</b> and mighty little on my back. I went down one place fifty or sixty feet deep head-foremost, bumping from rock to rock, and it flashed through my mind as I did so what an ass I was to be going through all this when I might be comfortably in bed at home. They don't tell one of these things," [...] he said plaintively, [...] "when they talk of the {{advantages}} of the army." ...|$|R
60|$|This I did, {{but it was}} {{not easy}} to do. Twice I sank above my knees in mud and water, and {{had it not been for}} reeds, masses of which I {{frequently}} clutched when I thought I was going over, I believe I should have fallen down and come to my death in that horrible marsh. When I reached the boat, I stood up to <b>my</b> <b>hips</b> in water and saw no way of climbing up. The gang-plank had undoubtedly floated away, and if it had not, it would have been of no use to me in my position.|$|R
5000|$|In a post-season interview, Joubert {{said that}} the 2010-11 season had not turned out as he had hoped, but that {{he still had a}} strong record {{throughout}} his career. He added that [...] "perhaps I was burned out after so many years. I was also worried about my left knee. I put pressure on <b>my</b> <b>hips</b> more and more to compensate for the pain I was feeling". Following the season, Joubert consulted different specialists about his knee injury and was told he would be unlikely to fully recover his normal strength if he underwent surgery; he therefore decided on a strict diet and specific exercises to restore his musculature balance.|$|R
