500|$|In {{his memoir}} , Dylan {{described}} the kinship he felt with the route that supplied {{the title of}} his sixth album: [...] "Highway 61, the main thoroughfare of the country blues, begins about where I began. I always felt like I'd started on it, always had been on it and could go anywhere, even down in to the deep Delta country. It was the same road, full of the same contradictions, the same one-horse towns, the same spiritual ancestors... It was <b>my</b> <b>place</b> <b>in</b> the universe, always felt like it was in my blood." ...|$|E
500|$|Pinker {{identifies}} {{himself as}} an equity feminist, which he defines as [...] "a moral doctrine about equal treatment that makes no commitments regarding open empirical issues in psychology or biology". He reported {{the result of a}} test of his political orientation that characterized him as [...] "neither leftist nor rightist, more libertarian than authoritarian." [...] He describes himself as having [...] "experienced a primitive tribal stirring" [...] after his genes were shown to trace back to the Middle East, noting that he [...] "found it just as thrilling to zoom outward in the diagrams of my genetic lineage and see <b>my</b> <b>place</b> <b>in</b> a family tree that embraces all of humanity".|$|E

500|$|Steinbeck {{continued}} {{to write in}} late 1953 while Hammerstein and Rodgers went to London to produce the West End production of The King and I. As Hammerstein received new material from Steinbeck, he and Rodgers began to map out the musical, conceiving scenes and deciding where songs should be placed. On January 1, 1954, following the completion of Steinbeck's novel, Hammerstein began to write dialogue and lyrics. Sweet Thursday was published in early 1954 to mixed reviews. Steinbeck later commented, [...] "Some of the critics are so concerned for my literary position that they can't read a book of mine without worrying where it will fit in <b>my</b> <b>place</b> <b>in</b> history. Who gives a damn?" [...] By that time, Rodgers and Hammerstein were busy producing {{the film version of}} Oklahoma! ...|$|E
500|$|Following {{the end of}} hostilities, No.4 Squadron {{joined the}} British Army of Occupation at Bickendorf, near Cologne, Germany, in December 1918. The unit {{returned}} to England in March 1919, and King sailed with it back to Australia aboard RMS Kaisar-i-Hind on 6May. He left the AFC on 11August 1919 in Melbourne, before gaining employment as an air courier for Larkin-Sopwith Aviation Co. of Australasia Ltd, which had been co-founded by fighter ace Herbert Larkin. While working for Larkin-Sopwith, King refused an appointment in the newly established Australian Air Corps (AAC)—forerunner of the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF)—because it had not then offered a commission to Frank McNamara, VC. In {{a letter to the}} AAC selection committee on 30January 1920, he wrote [...] "I feel I must forfeit <b>my</b> <b>place</b> <b>in</b> favor (sic) of this very good and gallant officer"; McNamara received a commission in the AAC that April.|$|E
500|$|The album {{opens with}} [...] "We Want the Airwaves", which has {{instrumentation}} that strays from traditional punk rock and more so towards hard rock. Music journalist Chuck Eddy described the song as [...] "a sort of Black Sabbath punk rock." [...] Though rumors of the album's third track, [...] "The KKK Took My Baby Away", being about Johnny stealing Joey's girlfriend have circulated {{in the music}} business, the song was actually written some time before Joey had reportedly found out about this. Joey's brother Mickey Leigh relates: [...] "The fluky connection between Johnny and the KKK raised a specter that keeps friends and fans speculating to this day. At the time, though, {{it had to be}} an unusual situation for him being that, as often happens with song lyrics, his words now took on a whole new meaning." [...] The following track, [...] "Don't Go", was described in Musician, Player, and Listener as [...] "Spector-ish", referring to the song's high production value through Phil Spector, the infamous producer of the band's previous record, End of the Century. According to the book, the lyrics detail [...] "an archivist's sense of young love by the book and how innocent rock 'n' roll is supposed to sound." [...] Everett True, author of Hey Ho Let's Go: The Story of the Ramones (2005), explains that the album's fifth track, [...] "You Sound Like You're Sick", is very bass incorporated, saying that it [...] "returns to the bassist's traditional institutionalised theme." [...] Side A ends with [...] "It's Not <b>My</b> <b>Place</b> (<b>In</b> the 9 to 5 World)", which was described by music critic David Fricke to be [...] "driven home" [...] by drummer Marky's [...] "feisty, Bo Diddley-style" [...] drum beat, and noted that it borrows the middle eight (of thirty-two-bar form) from The Who song [...] "Whiskey Man".|$|E

2500|$|Born on 24 June 1987 in Rosario, Santa Fe Province, Messi {{has spent}} his entire {{professional}} career at Spanish club Barcelona. His prodigious talents were spotted at an early age; he was discovered by Barcelona scout Josep Maria Minguella {{at the age of}} 13, and promptly moved to Spain where he progressed through Barcelona's youth academy La Masia, before making his senior debut on 16 October 2004. At the age of 10, Messi was diagnosed with growth hormone deficiency and upon joining Barcelona, the club paid for his treatment. Throughout the early years of his career, Messi had to endure the pressure of the tag New Maradona, comparisons furthered by scoring goals comparable to those Diego Maradona scored against England in the 1986 FIFA World Cup; on 19 April 2007, he scored a mazy dribble against Getafe which bore remarkable resemblance to that of Maradona's, before scoring his own version of the Hand of God on 9 June against rivals Espanyol. Maradona himself said of the comparison [...] "I have seen the player who will inherit <b>my</b> <b>place</b> <b>in</b> Argentinian football and his name is Messi".|$|E

2500|$|King {{is a fan}} of the Ramones, to {{the extent}} that he wrote the liner notes for the 2003 Ramones tribute album [...] He states that he agreed to write them because he [...] "loved The Ramones from the first time (he) heard them". Furthermore, King has {{referred}} to the band several times in his writing, both in his fiction and non-fiction. Non-fiction references include a mention in King's book Danse Macabre where he calls the Ramones [...] "an amusing punk-rock band that surfaced some four years ago". He also wrote about them in On Writing, making reference to [...] "dancing to the Ramones—gabba gabba hey" [...] as one of the reasons he has maintained a good marriage. King included further Ramones references in his fictional work. He quotes the lyrics to the Ramones' debut single [...] "Blitzkrieg Bop" [...] in his novel Pet Sematary on numerous occasions, as in the sentence [...] "What is it the Ramones say? Hey-ho, let's go"! In The Dark Tower novel [...] the Ramones get a further mention by the character Eddie Dean who states that [...] "Roland stage-dives like Joey Ramone". Critics have also noted the Ramones references. Entertainment Weekly, for example, in their review of Black House by King and Peter Straub, note that King's [...] "trademark references" [...] are in evidence, quoting Dee Dee Ramone. In turn, the Ramones have referenced King on their song [...] "It's Not <b>My</b> <b>Place</b> (<b>In</b> the 9 to 5 World)", from their Pleasant Dreams album of 1981 in the line: [...] "Ramones are hangin' out in Kokomo / Roger Corman's on a talk show / With Allan Arkush and Stephen King". Further, Dee Dee Ramone wrote the song [...] "Pet Sematary" [...] in King's basement after King handed him a copy of the novel. The song was eventually featured as the title song for the Pet Sematary (1989) film and also appeared on the Ramones album Brain Drain (1989).|$|E
