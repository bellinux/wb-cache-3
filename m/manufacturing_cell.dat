5000|$|A {{simple but}} rather {{complete}} description of cell implementation {{comes from a}} 1985 booklet of 96 pages by Kone Corp. in Finland, producer of elevators, escalators, and the like. Excerpts follow: [...] "The first step involved creating cells in the assembly, electrical and chemical testing departments. In April 1984 six cells, identified by different colors, were established... All devices manufactured in cells are identified by the cell's color, and all feed-back from quality control is directed straight to the workers of the cell concerned... The second step, in summer, 1984, was to [...] "cellularize" [...] manufacture of the analyzer subassemblies are needed in the analyzer cells, and to test them if necessary. Production of the five sub-assembly cells consists exclusively of certain analyzer sub-units. The parts and materials {{are located in the}} cells... Material control between the cells is based on the pull system and actual demand. In the analyzer cells there is a buffer consisting of two pieces for each (roughly 25 different) sub-unit. When one piece is taken into assembly, a new one is ordered from the corresponding unit-cell. The order is made using a magnetic kanban button, which identifies the ordering cell (by color), unit (by code), and order date... When the <b>manufacturing</b> <b>cell</b> has completed the order, the unit is taken with the kanban button to its place on the ordering cell shelf. Orders from the unit cells to the sub-cells are based on the same principle. The only difference is that the buffer size is six sub-units. This procedure was implemented in August, 1984." ...|$|E

40|$|This paper formalizes {{the problem}} of a {{concurrent}} design of a modular product architecture and a cellular manufacturing layout and presents {{a way to deal}} with this design problem. First, the different types of a modular product architecture are explained as well as important implications of modularity for the manufacturing process. Several advantages of a modular product architecture refer to the manufacturing process of the product. Second, it is shown that the extent in which assembly tasks are performed in the cells strongly determines the advantages of a cellular manufacturing layout. These two facts ask for a simultaneous consideration of modular product design and the design of the manufacturing layout (i. e., <b>manufacturing</b> <b>cells</b> in which parts are manufactured and modules are assembled). The relation between product design and manufacturing process is described in this paper by means of four relation matrices: a module-module matrix, a module-machine matrix, a machine-part matrix, and a part-part matrix. On the basis of this description, a systematic approach is developed to support the concurrent design of modules and <b>manufacturing</b> <b>cells.</b> The experiences of two firms are included in the paper and illustrate the advantages of including assembly activities in <b>manufacturing</b> <b>cells...</b>|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn many {{practical}} instances, {{the choice}} whether to apply family-based dispatching or not can be decided per machine. This paper explores {{the impact of}} the location of family-based dispatching, load variations between machines, and routing of jobs on the flow time effect of family-based dispatching. These factors are explored in small <b>manufacturing</b> <b>cells</b> with and without labour constraints. An industrial case motivates the study. A simulation study is performed to assess {{the impact of the}}se effects. The results show that shop floor characteristics such as routing and load variation impact the decision where to locate family-based dispatching in <b>manufacturing</b> <b>cells</b> without labour constraints. By contrast, the effect of family-based dispatching is much less vulnerable to shop floor characteristics in cells with labour constraints. Since workers are the bottleneck in these cells, it becomes less important at what machine the set-up time involving a worker is reduced. In general, there seems to be a trade-off between the positive effect of applying family-based dispatching at a (bottleneck) machine and the possible negative effect of the more irregular job arrivals at subsequent machines. The results further indicate that family based dispatching is more advantageous in cells with labour constraints than in cells without labour constraints, when both types of <b>manufacturing</b> <b>cells</b> have comparable machine utilisations...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a comprehensive methodology {{for the design}} of a hybrid manufacturing shop layout that comprises both <b>manufacturing</b> <b>cells</b> and individual workcenters. The proposed approach targets the minimization of the material handling effort within the shop and comprises four basic steps (1) identification of candidate <b>manufacturing</b> <b>cells,</b> (2) evaluation and selection of the cells to be implemented, (3) determination of the intra-cell layout, and (4) determination of the shop layout. For the first step, an existing cell formation technique has been employed and enhanced to facilitate reduction of part setup times. The resulting <b>manufacturing</b> <b>cells</b> are evaluated with respect to the expected reduction in material handling and the most significant ones are selected for implementation. The layout of each selected cell is determined to minimize the material handling between the cell resources. For this purpose a stimulated annealing (SA) algorithm is employed which accounts fully for all physical cell constraints. Once the sizes and shapes of the selected cells are known, the shop layout is determined by a similar algorithm. the resulting hybrid shop consists of the selected cells and the remaining machines. The methodology has been implemented in an integrated software system and has been applied to redesign the shop of a large manufacturing of radar antennas...|$|R
