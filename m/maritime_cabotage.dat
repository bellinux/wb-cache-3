40|$|On 7 May 2008, Indonesia enacted Law 17 / 2008 on Shipping (Shipping Act) which {{substituted}} Law 20 / 1992 on Shipping. In the new Shipping Act, <b>maritime</b> <b>cabotage</b> {{is scheduled}} to take its full effects on 7 May 2011, exactly three years after its enactment. By the scheduled time, domestic seaborne transportation in Indonesian territorial waters shall {{be carried out by}} Indonesian shipping companies, using Indonesian-flagged vessels manned by Indonesian citizens. As a result, foreign flagged vessels will be excluded from transporting goods and/or passengers between islands or ports within Indonesian territorial waters. Among the important reasons for the implementation of this principle are the sovereignty and protection of domestic shipping industry as well as Indonesia national security issues. This paper will argue that implementing <b>maritime</b> <b>cabotage</b> does not contradict any provisions in the 1982 UNCLOS. It will also show that <b>maritime</b> <b>cabotage</b> and the 1982 UNCLOS are closely related although this principle is not in the convention. The 1982 UNCLOS will advise Indonesia on the limit of its territorial waters, and thus where this largest archipelagic state in the world can exercise its <b>maritime</b> <b>cabotage</b> policy...|$|E

40|$|Coastal {{shipping}} {{has been}} widely recognised as a sustainable and efficient alternative to road transport. However, the barriers encountered in the industry have not been systematically studied in any region. From an Indian perspective, this study aims to prioritise barriers to coastal shipping development for effective policy interventions. It identifies important barriers through a Delphi study and then quantifies their cause-and-effect relationships by the decision making-trial and evaluation laboratory analysis (DEMATEL) technique. It is interesting that the main barriers, those have most impact on coastal shipping development, {{are not necessarily the}} ones most widely recognised. The study also uncovers the hidden cause-and-effect relationships between several barriers. Four main barriers are identified: (1) Indian <b>maritime</b> legislation (especially <b>cabotage</b> rules); (2) issues in the infrastructure and procedures at port and port-centric areas; (3) underdevelopment of small ports; (4) lack of a collaborative culture among the various service providers involved in the logistics supply chain. This study finally recommends relaxing cabotage rules to stimulate the inflow of foreign capital to grow coastal shipping, improving the current port system through joint efforts of the ports, Indian customs and government, and fostering supply chain collaboration...|$|R
40|$|Container paths play an {{important}} role in liner shipping services with container transshipment operations. In the literature, link-based multi-commodity flow formulations are widely used for container routing. However, they have two deficiencies: the level of service in terms of the origin-to-destination transit time is not incorporated and <b>maritime</b> <b>cabotage</b> may be violated. To overcome these deficiencies, we first present an operational network representation of a liner shipping network. Based on the network, an integer linear programming model is formulated to obtain container paths with minimum cost. Finally, we add constraints to the integer linear programming model, excluding those paths already obtained, so as to find all the container paths...|$|E
40|$|Throughout the 1970 s and 1980 s, Canada {{studied the}} impact of its {{cabotage}} legislation thoroughly and opted to provide protection of the domestic shipping market with new legislation in 1992. This paper traces the decision-making process through this period, and the concurrent discussions within NAFTA under negotiations for liberalization of trade in services. Now that Canada has 13 years experience with the existing cabotage legislation, and has adopted a policy to promote the development of short sea shipping, this paper evaluates Canada’s shipping policy options {{in order to identify}} if changes are required given the new policy environment.

40|$|The <b>maritime</b> <b>cabotage,</b> {{represented}} by the movement of goods along the coastline, has shown as a competitive modal against other transportation systems, especially because of its low cost freight. The objective {{of this paper is}} to present what the literature brings about the cabotage regulation and to develop a comparison between Canadian and Brazilian markets. In a first analysis, the Canadian’s system goes through problems of productivity efficiency, especially for the short stayed permitted time of foreign containers in the country. In a contrast, the extensive coastline and the high import taxes, contribute to the development of Brazilian cabotage. However, the policies of Mercosur prevent the cabotage along countries in the same coast (i. e. Brasil-Argentina), a fact that would facilitate trade between the countries...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the tension between WTO {{liberalization}} rules in the services sector and the domestic regulation of maritime transport - a sector that is dependent on excessive government subsidies - {{and the impact of}} such tension on the future of maritime transport. Multilateral negotiations on the use of subsidies in the services sector have attracted little or no attention in comparison with other services related issues. This ordinarily should not be a problem except for that fact the existence or otherwise of subsidy disciplines will have profound consequences on the effectiveness and reach of market access commitments made in the ongoing Doha Round. Then again, subsidy disciplines would also affect the ability of WTO Members (especially developing countries that lack the power to subsidize) to utilize subsidies in achieving national policy objectives. While the tension between national regulation and the multilateral trading system in the goods sector has been subject of extensive analysis, the interface of trade liberalization and national regulation in the services sector has been less analyzed. Ironically, the services sector is arguably of similar and probably. greater significance in international trade. In analyzing the future of maritime transport under the liberalization framework of the WTO, the thesis uses the protectionist concept of <b>maritime</b> <b>cabotage</b> as its analytical framework. This facilitates a more profound understanding of the tension between domestic regulation and multilateral liberalization of maritime services and also highlights the role of subsidies - which are essential in <b>maritime</b> <b>cabotage</b> trade - in exacerbating this tension. In developing international law jurisprudence on this score, the thesis delicately interconnects protectionism in maritime transport, domestic regulation and multilateral liberalization of services within the GATS.

40|$|Fierce policy {{disputes}} {{are inevitable}} whenever two basic, widely-accepted principles intersect {{in a situation}} where one must prevail and the other give way. In the maritime field, these disputes occur whenever a nation-state is forced to choose between promoting free and open trade in maritime services or protecting its domestic merchant marine. The clash of these policies has generated vigorous debates in the United States {{on a wide variety of}} maritime issues (e. g., cargo preference requirements, operating and construction differential subsidies, vessel construction loan guarantee programs and whether to retaliate against foreign countries 2 ̆ 7 attempts to reserve import and export trades for their merchant marines). In one area, however, the advocates of a strong domestic merchant marine have routed the forces of free trade by reserving domestic maritime trades for national maritime fleets. The right of a nation to exclude foreign vessels from its domestic maritime trades is accepted without question in the international community; and most coastal nations, including the United States, have adopted cabotage laws to enforce that right. 2 ̆ 7 The United States 2 ̆ 7 <b>maritime</b> <b>cabotage</b> laws are contained in Section 27 of the Merchant Marine Act of 19202 - commonly referred to as the Jones Act. This article will challenge neither the United States 2 ̆ 7 legal right to adopt cabotage laws, nor the Congressional choice to protect the United States merchant marine through the enactment of the Jones Act. Instead, this article analyzes recent Jones Act rulings, opinions and decisions on the so-called 2 ̆ 2 continuity of the voyage 2 ̆ 2 issue (Le., whether the Act applies to the transportation of cargoes between two United States points if they are manufactured or processed at a foreign intermediate point) ...|$|E
40|$|Corsica {{is a large}} {{mediterranean}} island located 80 km {{far from}} the Italian coast and at least 160 km far from mainland France. These distances are not suitable for fixed links and give an irreplaceable role to air and maritime transport. There has been a particular interest from the State for the financing and the pricing of these services, following a principle forged during the 1970 s : the « territorial continuity ». Principles of organization initially adopted, which applied only to maritime transport, {{were based on a}} strict observance of the principles of the french public service (including the continuity of supply throughout the year), and a tariff alignment with SNCF. The air transport was concerned later (1979), under less restrictive forms; essentially grants to avoid the imposition of the full price to the inhabitants of the island. This system had subsequently to adapt to several changes more or less favorable to its perpetuation: -regionalization in the early 1980 s with the creation of the territorial community of Corsica (CTC) and the establishment of the Transportation Office of Corsica (OTC), who gets the powers previously exercised by the State;-the liberalization of <b>maritime</b> <b>cabotage</b> on 1 January 1993, any European carrier can operate without restriction any line. Public service contracts remain possible, with a maximum of five years. -liberalization of air transport, coupled with more stringent award of public service contract rules. These must be of short duration (three years) and the number of selection criteria is limited. These changes tend to bring the services to Corsica closer to the common law, while allowing the perpetuation of certain characteristics, particularly in terms of funding. Our analysis also involved the transport of domestic travelers across the island, with an internal railway system (CFC). They do not belong to the national rail network and the competition has been relaunched in 2011, after nearly three decades without calling into question the monopole of SNCF. For the latter, this evolution is of high importance with the prospect of a probable opening of mainland regional networks to competition...|$|E
