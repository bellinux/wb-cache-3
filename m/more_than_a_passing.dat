25|$|The show's premise also bears <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>passing</b> {{resemblance}} to the 1964 return of Captain America in Marvel Comics' (completely unrelated) The Avengers. Both characters are adventurers from an earlier era thawed out of blocks of ice in the present day.|$|E
25|$|The {{publication}} of Amos Barton caused some alarm {{among those who}} – rightly or wrongly – suspected {{that they had been}} the models for the characters, few of whom are described in a flattering manner. Eliot was forced to apologise to John Gwyther, who had been the local curate in her childhood, and to whom the character of Barton himself bore <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>passing</b> resemblance.|$|E
25|$|After courting the Japanese, Roosevelt {{decided to}} support the Tsar's refusal to pay indemnities, a move that policymakers in Tokyo {{interpreted}} as signifying that the United States had <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>passing</b> interest in Asian affairs. Russia recognized Korea {{as part of the}} Japanese sphere of influence and agreed to evacuate Manchuria. Japan would annex Korea in 1910 (Japan–Korea Treaty of 1910), with scant protest from other powers.|$|E

25|$|Tuttle and {{the studio}} are showing <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>passing</b> enthusiasm for Ladd. He {{has been trying}} to get a {{foothold}} in pictures for eight years but received no encouragement although he tried every angle known to town—extra work, bit parts, stock contracts, dramatic schools, assault of the casting offices. Sue Carol, the former silent star who is now an agent, undertook to advance the youth's career two years ago and only recently could she locate an attentive ear. Then the breaks began.|$|E
25|$|It {{can have}} <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>passing</b> {{similarity}} to serfdom or indenture, particularly where associated with large debts at a plantation store that effectively tie down {{the workers and}} their family to the land. It has therefore been seen as an issue of land reform in contexts such as the Mexican Revolution. However, Nyambara states that Eurocentric historiographical devices such as 'feudalism' or 'slavery' often qualified by weak prefixes like 'semi-' or 'quasi-' are not helpful in understanding the antecedents and functions of sharecropping in Africa.|$|E
25|$|In 1988, Zastava {{launched}} {{the first of}} its new “Florida” range, envisaged as a long-term replacement for the ageing Stojadin. Styled by Giorgetto Guigiaro, the car was a modern design for the time, and bore <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>passing</b> resemblance to the Citroen ZX. The Florida, marketed as the “Sana” in the United Kingdom, first appeared in Britain in 1990 and seemed set to fare well with positive early reviews. The Stojadin range ceased to be exported to the United Kingdom in 1991, with sales of the Sana under way.|$|E

50|$|CityLink account holders can, if {{they make}} {{multiple}} trips in a day, pay more to use the road <b>than</b> <b>a</b> casual user. <b>A</b> 24-hour <b>Pass,</b> for example, is charged at a flat rate, but an account holder pays per trip. Account holders who make multiple trips {{in a single day}} may pay <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>pass</b> customer would. However, CityLink recognises this and account customers can remove their e-TAG device and buy <b>a</b> <b>pass</b> for the day: just like casual customers. However, {{there is a limit to}} the number of passes that can be bought each 12 months. This limit applies to account holders and casual users.|$|R
25|$|In Terry Pratchett's The Colour of Magic, Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser are parodied as Bravd and the Weasel. Although Ankh-Morpork bears <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>passing</b> {{resemblance}} to Lankhmar, Pratchett, {{known for the}} use of pastiche in his early works, has been quoted as not intending a direct takeoff. Some of the features of similarity (e.g. a thieves' guild, and a general air of degeneracy) may instead be common tropes of fantasy literature, although it could be argued, {{especially in the case of}} the thieves' guild, that many of the tropes in question originated with Leiber.|$|E
25|$|The {{contractor}} of {{the building}} is Bong Sin, with the consulting engineer as Steen Sehested and Coltman as the architect. The structure bears <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>passing</b> resemblance to Frank Lloyd Wright's Imperial Hotel, Tokyo, in its details and overall layout. If this was explicit {{on the part of}} Coltman, it would be a most unusual apparition of Prairie Style in South East Asia, and an indication of the architect's ability to work within many stylistic parameters, a flexibility he exhibited throughout his long and distinguished career. Coltman is known for his role in establishing one of the largest firms in the area, and for his part in bringing modernism to the Federated States of Malaya, later Malaysia.|$|E
25|$|The {{main feature}} change was support for Microsoft's 64-bit {{operating}} system, however support for Banyan VINES was also dropped from {{this version of}} MDAC. There were several known issues: MDAC 2.7 continued causing connectivity problems on clustered servers running Microsoft SQL Server 6.5 or SQL Server 7.0, with no workaround provided by Microsoft. When creating or configuring ODBC data source names (DSNs) using the Microsoft SQL Server ODBC driver the network library protocol might unexpectedly switch to TCP/IP, even if the DSN was configured to use named pipes. This issue was found by InfoWorld reporter Randall C. Kennedy, who identified that the change was actually made in MDAC 2.6 but was never documented. It was discovered when testing client/server database workloads on a Windows XP computer; InfoWorld claims that although overall server CPU utilization rose by only 8 percent using TCP/IP, context switches per second dropped by more than 150 percent (which is of course impossible because you would then have a negative context switch rate - the drop is either 33% or 60% depending on which planet the author was on {{at the time of}} writing) for a 10-user workload. They were unimpressed that a fundamental functional change to the default behaviour of Net-Lib occurred without <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>passing</b> mention in an unrelated document. Windows XP users also sometimes experienced problems connecting to SQL Server because SQL Server attempts to use certificates it finds on the local computer, however if {{there is more than one}} certificate available it did not know which one to use. When attempting to use Microsoft Analysis Services 2000 RTM, an error would sometimes appear when trying to browse cubes. Microsoft also discovered a problem in Windows 95, Windows 98, and Windows Me's setup program which prevented the MDAC installation program from rolling back when it encountered an installation error.|$|E

500|$|Clement Scott in The Daily Telegraph {{found the}} opera [...] "not marred by ambitious music". But he added, [...] "Tuneful throughout, always pretty, {{frequently}} suggestive, {{the songs and}} dances are quite in character with the author's design.... Some of the numbers will certainly live, and the impression caused by the music {{as a whole is}} that it will have far <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>passing</b> interest." ...|$|E
500|$|Reception to Legends was mixed. Orlando Parfit of IGN UK {{wrote that}} while the {{decision}} to merge Halo and Japanese anime seemed an odd choice, [...] "Halo Legends proves a successful—if uneven—attempt to fuse these two universes, and will certainly prove essential viewing for those with <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>passing</b> interest in Bungie's seminal shooters." [...] IGN US reviewers Cindy White and Christopher Monfette said that the short films [...] "prove surprisingly accessible to sci-fi fans in general," [...] and that the collection was [...] "well worth" [...] the time. Matt Miller of Game Informer said that Halo Legends would appeal to story-interested fans of the franchise, not those who cared about multiplayer gameplay.|$|E
500|$|Ultimately, Joe 90 {{has proven}} to be less {{successful}} than previous series made by Anderson. In the Anderson-related book, Supermarionation Classics, the model work and scripts are praised, but it is conceded that the series [...] "failed to arouse <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>passing</b> interest with some Anderson fans." [...] Stephen Hulse refers to Joe 90 as [...] "clearly the most child-oriented of the latter Anderson Supermarionation series" [...] and [...] "technically accomplished", but [...] "one of the Anderson stable's lesser series". However, its spy-fi theme led on to the final Supermarionation series, The Secret Service, which too features an unconventional secret agent (a vicar, Father Stanley Unwin) and an intelligence organisation with a contracted name (BISHOP, an acronym for [...] "British Intelligence Service Headquarters, Operation Priest").|$|E

500|$|Her first {{picture with}} Warner Bros. was James Whale's comedy The Great Garrick (1937) in a {{supporting}} part. LeRoy then cast Turner in her second film, They Won't Forget (1937), a crime drama {{in which she}} played a teenage murder victim. Though the part was minor, William Wilkerson wrote in The Hollywood Reporter that Turner's performance was [...] "worthy of <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>passing</b> note." [...] Turner earned the nickname [...] "the Sweater Girl" [...] from her form-fitting attire in a scene in They Won't Forget. According to her daughter, this was a nickname Turner detested throughout her entire career. In late 1937, she {{signed a contract with}} Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer for $100 a week, and {{graduated from high school in}} between filming. The same year, she was loaned to United Artists for a minor role as a maid in The Adventures of Marco Polo.|$|E
500|$|Eston's {{second son}} Beverley Jefferson also {{served in the}} regular Union Army. [...] After {{operating}} the American Hotel with his brother John, he later separately operated the Capital Hotel. He also built a successful horse-drawn [...] "omnibus" [...] business. He and his wife Anna M. Smith had five sons, three of whom reached the professional class as a physician, attorney, and manager in the railroad industry. According to his 1908 obituary, Beverly Jefferson was [...] "a likeable character at the Wisconsin capital and a familiar of statesmen for half a century." [...] His friend Augustus J. Munson wrote, [...] "Beverly Jefferson death deserves <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>passing</b> notice, as he was a grandson of Thomas Jefferson... was one of God's noblemen - gentle, kind, courteous, charitable." [...] Beverley and Anna's great-grandson John Weeks Jefferson is the Eston Hemings descendant whose DNA was tested in 1998; it matched the Y-chromosome of the Thomas Jefferson male line.|$|E
500|$|For Rise Against, Appeal to Reason {{marked a}} musical {{shift from the}} gritty punk rock that had {{previously}} defined their career, to a more accessible and radio-friendly sound, with greater emphasis on production value. The New York Times felt the album was more tune-oriented than the band's previous works, while John Hanson of Sputnikmusic said that the album is [...] "'appealing' to a larger audience than old fans will be comfortable with". According to Bill Stewart of PopMatters, [...] "Appeal to Reason is a Rise Against album. If you possess <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>passing</b> familiarity with the band, I wouldn't even bother scrolling {{through the rest of}} this review, and I'd certainly avoid checking out the rating at the end of it—because that first sentence, for better or worse, says everything that needs to be said about this album." [...] Critics have characterized the album's music as melodic hardcore and punk rock, with influences of pop punk.|$|E
50|$|<b>More</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> month <b>passed</b> {{until the}} next word from the kidnappers. On January 28, 2006, Al Jazeera {{broadcast}} a video showing the four hostages alive, dated January 21, 2006. The captors stated that the U.S. and Britain had one last chance to free all Iraqi prisoners or the hostages would be killed.|$|R

500|$|In February 2011, American {{recording}} artist Katy Perry released her single [...] "E.T." [...] from her third studio album, Teenage Dream (2010). According to several music publications, {{the composition and}} rhythm bar of Perry's single {{was similar to the}} sound of [...] "Ya Soshla s Uma"; Matthew Cole from Slant Magazine disliked Perry's song for being [...] "inscrutability" [...] and said that its backing track was reminiscent of t.A.T.u.'s song. Similarly, The A.V. Club editor Genevieve Koski felt [...] "E.T." [...] "bears <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>passing</b> resemblance" [...] of t.A.T.u.'s single, and a reporter from Sound Magazine posted a mash-up version of the songs to distinguish the comparisons; the website labelled {{it one of the most}} [...] "annoyingly addictive" [...] songs. In May 2011, Galoyan responded to the comparisons and criticized Perry's track, considering legal action against the singer, West, and her labels Capitol Records and Universal Music Group, but not responding since his comments.|$|E
500|$|The 2006 series caused {{controversy}} for the misguided {{information presented}} in [...] "Silent Killer" [...] (2006), which suggested {{a link between}} TETRA radio emissions and motor neurone disease. Statements were released by the TETRA Industry Group and the MND Association, the latter emphasising that while {{there is some evidence}} to suggest a link, it is not a single contributory factor. [...] "Heart of Darkness" [...] (2006) was criticised for portraying a causal link between the MMR vaccine and autism, and the BBC received complaints on the matter. The Editorial Complaints Unit ruled that the episode had contravened the BBC's [...] "obligation of due impartiality on matters of public controversy" [...] and that the episode would not be repeated in its original form. The episode was cited in From Seesaw to Wagon Wheel, an internal BBC report on impartiality in its output that was published in June 2007, a section of which highlighted that the name of the Westwake character bore <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>passing</b> resemblance to that of Dr Andrew Wakefield.|$|E
500|$|Critics gave {{high marks}} to the game's retro art {{direction}} and presentation. Official Xbox Magazine (UK)s Mike Channel appreciated the variety found in {{each set of}} levels. [...] He stated that [...] "while the graphics may look crude, the presentation is exceptional. Each level has a distinct visual style." [...] Daemon Hatfield, a reviewer for IGN, noted {{the uniqueness of the}} game's visual presentation. He commented that the warp zone levels pay tribute to classic 8-bit games, and lauded the game's soundtrack: [...] "The rocking chiptune soundtrack is the best I've heard since Scott Pilgrim vs. The World: The Game". Joe Leonard of 1UP.com noted that the game's humor and over-the-top gameplay help to calm frustrations regarding the difficulty: [...] "Super Meat Boys greatest strength has to be how it never takes itself too seriously—as maddening as some of the levels got, I could never stay angry at the game for too long", said Leonard. MTV Multiplayer reviewer Russ Frushtick praised the game's visual design. He appreciated the game's cutscenes, which he noted are [...] "hand-drawn animated [...] which [...] <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>passing</b> resemblance to a classic video game intro".|$|E
