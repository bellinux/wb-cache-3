50|$|A <b>molecular</b> <b>logic</b> <b>gate</b> can {{processes}} modulators {{much like}} the set up seen in de Silva’s ‘Proof-of-principle’ but incorporating different logic gates on the same molecule. Such a function is called integrated logic and is exemplified by the BODIPY-based, half-subtractor logic gate illustrated by A. Coskun, E. U. Akkaya and their colleagues (as shown below). When monitored at two different wavelengths, 565 and 660 nm, XOR and INHIBIT logic gates are obtained at the respective wavelengths. Optical studies of this compound in THF reveal an absorbance peak at 565 nm and an emission peak at 660 nm. Addition of an acid results in a hypsochromic shift of both peaks as protonation of the tertiary amine results in an internal charge transfer. The colour of the emission observed is yellow. Upon addition of a strong base, the phenolic hydroxyl group is rendered deprotonated, resulting in a photoinduced electron transfer, which in turn renders the molecule non-emissive. Upon addition of both an acid and a base, the emission of the molecule is observed as red, as the tertiary amine would not be protonated while the hydroxyl group would remain protonated resulting {{in the absence of}} both PET and ICT. Due to the great difference in emission intensity, this single molecule is capable of carrying out an arithmetic operation; subtraction at a nanoscale level.|$|E

40|$|Chemical {{reactions}} are a prominent feature of molecular systems, with no direct parallels in wireless communications. While chemical reactions {{may be used}} inside the transmitter nodes, receiver nodes or the communication medium, we focus on its utility in the medium in this paper. Such chemical reactions {{can be used to}} perform computation over the medium as molecules diffuse and react with each other (physical-layer computation). We propose the use of chemical reactions for the following purposes: (i) to realize molecular physical-layer network coding (molecular PNC) by performing the natural XOR operation inside the medium, and (ii) to reduce signal-dependent observation noise of molecular receptors by canceling out the remaining molecules from previous transmission. To make the ideas formal, we consider an explicit two-way relaying example with a ligand receiver (which has a signal-dependent noise). The proposed ideas are used to define a modulation scheme (which we call the PNC scheme). We compare the PNC with a previously proposed scheme for this problem where the XOR operation is performed at the relay node (using a <b>molecular</b> <b>logic</b> <b>gate).</b> We call the latter, the straightforward network coding (SNC).

Prion diseases are a group of fatal neurodegenerative disorders that happen in human and animals. The main problem with a diagnosis of prion diseases is how to sensitively and selectively discriminate and detection of the minute amount of PrP(Res) in biological samples. Our previous work had demonstrated that dual-aptamer strategy could achieve highly sensitive and selective discrimination and detection of prion protein (cellular prion protein, PrP(C), and the diseases associated isoform, PrP(Res)) in serum and brain.

Includes bibliographical refences. Recent {{research}} in molecular logic gates produced molecular equivalence of highly complex digital designs. Advanced data processing {{at the molecular}} level requires a considerable degree of integration (concatenation) between molecular logic gates. So far, almost all the integration reported in the literature has been “virtual”, meaning that the outputs at various channels are determined first and then an integrated set of logic gates is proposed to be operating on inputs to produce those outputs. Nevertheless, {{there is no doubt that}} at some point there has to be methods to physically connect one <b>molecular</b> <b>logic</b> <b>gate</b> to the other one, for a rational design and implementation. In this study, we synthesized a few derivatives of the well known fluorophore “Bodipy” and then proposed two methodologies to concatenate separately existing and functioning Bodipy-based chemical logic gates. In one instance, we coupled a photochromicity-based AND gate to an ion-responsive Bodipy-based AND gate, making use of the modulation of inner filter effect. In the other example, we coupled two ion-responsive Bodipy-based AND gates through the increased efficiency of energy transfer and “click” chemistry.
