Micron-sized dust simulants, mixtures of sand- and dust- sized particles, and salt- encrusted sand are examined. We find that while the value of the {{diffusion coefficient}}, D, can be reduced by up to a factor of 10 for heavily salt- encrusted soils (minimum observed D = 0. 4 ± 0. 04 cm^ 2 s^- 1), moderate amounts of salt only produce minor reductions in D. <b>Mechanical</b> <b>packing</b> of pure dust can lower D by a similar amount, while mixtures of dust with sand- sized particles produce at most a factor of ~ 4 reduction. We conclude that present- day processes of aeolian redistribution, moderate levels of salt encrustation, and volatile loss from dirty ice would be inefficient at producing soil deposits and lags on Mars that pose significant barriers to diffusion. Therefore, subsurface ice deposits that are thermally unstable would not be protected against sublimative loss by such materials...|$|E

40|$|Air {{permeability}} and {{elastic modulus}} were measured for firn samples prepared from a 20 -m pit and cores drilled to {{the depth of}} 147. 5 m at Mizuho Station in East Antarctica. Air permeability decreased and elastic modulus increased with increasing depth or density. Two distinct changes were found at densities of 550 and 730 kg・m^, i. e. at porosities of 0. 40 and 0. 20,in the plots of air permeability and elastic modulus against density or porosity. The former change is explained by the alteration of the densification mechanicism from <b>mechanical</b> <b>packing</b> to plastic deformation of ice particles, and the latter by the attainment of an optimum configuration of ice bonding for air permeation and mechanical strength. Observed results are compared with the theoretical air permeability of an ideal snow, to which all polar snows are considered to approach in a long ageing period under high hydrostatic pressure and high homologous temperature.

Five critical depths were found at which some structural changes occurred. They were 8 m, 30 m, 55 m, 70 m and 110 m. Their corresponding densities were 550, 730, 840, 855 and 882 kg・m^, respectively. The densities of 550 and 840 kg・m^ correspond to frequently reported figures at which the densification mechanism changes from <b>mechanical</b> <b>packing</b> of air voids to plastic deformation of ice grains, and from plastic deformation to shrinkage of closed-off air bubbles. The critical density of 730 kg・m^ (30 m) was first pointed out by MAENO in 1974,who concluded that the bonding between ice grains reached its maximum or optimum state for packing at this density. The present analyses showed that air voids were gathered only at intersections of grain boundaries in the core samples at the critical density. The remaining two critical densities, 855 kg・m^ (70 m) and 882 kg・m^ (110 m), are related to alterations of mechanical stress fields; samples below 70 m contained layers of small grains intermittently, and at depths deeper than 110 m crystal sizes decreased, suggesting the presence of shear components...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] Boston UniversityExpanding {{interest}} in powder technology has generated many investigations of sintering, the major {{step in the}} solidification of powder to dense material. Sintering is defined herein as the establishment of physical bonds between powder particles in mechanical contact {{under the influence of}} temperature and time. Physical properties and tests previously studied lack direct correlation with the degree of sintering. The relation between the extent of sintering and changes in surface energy of the powder system is discussed. In accordance with Gibbs-Helmholtz principles, the equivalent of the energy change with degree of sintering was measured by the electrochemical potential. The empirical nature of the practices employed in and the change in properties produced by the transition from powder to solid are reviewed. The controllable conditions governing the final properties are the powder characteristics and the treatments employed. Briquetting raises the density of the powder relative to solid density from 20 - 40 % when loose to 60 - 90 % when pressed. Previous explanations attribute compacted strength to localized welding of particles due to interparticle friction and adhesion between clean surfaces exposed as they undergo motion. It is suggested that the major effect of compacting is to relocate the particles, causing better <b>mechanical</b> <b>packing.</b> The strength of the green compact is considered to originate in the interparticle friction opposing the force tending to separate the particles and cause rupture.

40|$|Molecular {{mechanical}} logic {{devices have}} been proposed {{as a method of}} eventually achieving very small size (device volumes of a few cubic nanometers) and thus of achieving very high packing densities. However, the heat generated by mole quantities of molecular <b>mechanical</b> logic devices <b>packed</b> into a small volume can be a major problem. Previous mechanical logic devices (in which the logic gates in a digital system are implemented using mechanical components) required that some part slide or rotate past another part, resulting in friction and heat generation when the parts move.

40|$|Evaluating {{contaminants}} impacting {{wells in}} fractured crystalline bedrock requires {{knowledge of the}} individual fractures that contribute water to the wells. This typically involves using a sequence of methods including downhole geophysics, flow meters, and straddle packers. These methods are expensive, time consuming, and can be logistically difficult to implement. This study demonstrates an unsteady state tracer method as a cost effective alternative for gathering fracture information in bedrock wells. The method entails: introducing tracer dye throughout the wellbore by trolling and <b>mechanical</b> mixing; <b>packing</b> off and draining the upper portion of the well; releasing the packer to induce a slug test and fracture flow into the well which dilutes out the dye within the well; monitoring the dilution front movement by profiling the tracer concentration to locate water contributing fractures, calculate their transmissivity values, determine their hydraulic heads, determine ambient flow conditions, and calculate contaminant concentration within the fractures. This method was tested on a large physical model well and a bedrock well. The model well {{was used to test}} the theory underlying the method and to perfect method logistics. The approach located the fracture and also generated transmissivity values that were in excellent agreement with those calculated by slug testing. For the bedrock well tested two major active fractures were located. Fracture location and ambient well conditions matched results from conventional methods.

40|$|The current lifestyles, {{increasing}} population, {{and limited}} resources result in energy research {{being at the}} forefront of worldwide grand challenges, increasing the demand for sustainable and more efficient energy devices. In this context, additive manufacturing brings the possibility of making electrodes and electrical energy storage devices in any desired three-dimensional (3 D) shape and dimensions, while preserving the multifunctional properties of the active materials in terms of surface area and conductivity. This paves the way to optimized and more efficient designs for energy devices. Here, we describe how threedimensional (3 D) printing will allow the fabrication of bespoke devices, with complex geometries, tailored to fit specific requirements and applications, by designing water-based thermoresponsive inks to 3 D-print different materials in one step, for example, printing the active material precursor (reduced chemically modified graphene (rCMG)) and the current collector (copper) for supercapacitors or anodes for lithium-ion batteries.

Methods: A prospective cohort study was undertaken in infants weighing < 1250 g and maternal postmenstrual age < 32 weeks if there was concern about prolonged exposure to oxygen. The main clinical outcomes were occurrence of any stage of ROP and in particular severe ROP. Perinatal variables considered were: birth weight, gestational age, gender, method of ventilation (nasal continuous airway pressure or intermittent <b>mechanical</b> ventilation), <b>packed</b> red blood cell and/or plasma transfusion, occurrence of sepsis, neonatal indirect hyperbilirubinemia, intraventricular hemorrhage, and patent ductus arteriosus. After obtaining informed consent from the parents, infants at risk were examined for ROP using indirect ophthalmoscopy, ie, RetCam II fundus photography. Results: The study included 152 infants of mean gestational age 31. 02 weeks and mean birth weight 1. 229 kg. Seventy-two cases (47. 5 %) were male and 80 cases (52. 5 %) were female. Of the cases screened, 100 (65. 6 %) had no ROP, 52 had ROP of any stage (34. 4 %), and 27 (18 %) had stage 1, five (3. 3 %) had stage 2, 17 (11. 5 %) had stage 3, and three (1. 6 %) had stage 4 disease. No infants had stage 5 ROP. Of all our cases with ROP, 15 (28. 6 %) had prethreshold disease type 1 that required treatment, comprising 9. 8 % of all cases screened for ROP. Using stepwise logistic regression analysis, all risk factors studied {{were found to be}} significantly associated with the development of ROP, except for neonatal indirect hyperbilirubinemia. Severity of ROP was inversely proportional to birth weight and gestational age. Conclusion: ROP occurred in 34. 4 % of all infants screened in the neonatal intensive care units at three obstetric hospitals in Alexandria. The main risk factors for development of threshold ROP by regression analysis were low birth weight, gestational age, method of ventilation, need for packed red blood cell and/or plasma transfusion, occurrence of sepsis, intraventricular hemorrhage, and patent ductus arteriosus but not neonatal indirect hyperbilirubinemia. We suggest that both immaturity and compromised pulmonary function are both important etiological factors in the development of ROP.

The research was conducted in three stages, namely: the measurement of physical and mechanical properties of fruit (Stage I); the packaging design i. e. determining the packaging dimension (Stage II); and packaging design testing (Stage III). Compression and vibration testing were conducted. For the vibration testing, transport simulations were conducted using the vibration simulator of 3. 50 Hz and amplitude of 4. 61 cm for 3 hours. The packaging was designed with a capacity of 8 kg and 15 kg using two packing pattern, namely the fcc and Jumble. Based on the physical and <b>mechanical</b> properties, optimal <b>packing</b> pattern of 8 kg container was 8, 4, and 4 pieces of fruit for the long x, y, and z direction, respectively, with the density of 62 %. Therefore, gave packaging dimension of 39. 4 x 21 x 21 cm. For the 15 kg container, the optimal packing pattern was 8, 6 and 5 pieces of fruit for the x, y, and z direction, respectively, with the packing density of 65. 6 %.

Simultaneously, a confocal scanning laser microscope (CSLM) was used to study the deformations in the material. Our liquids consisted of (nearly) refractive-index-matching water-DMSO mixtures. Particle layers were formed by sedimentation in normal gravity. In the absence of (added) electrolyte, the collective behavior of the layer is reminiscent of that of a simple liquid. Crystal-like structures were observed, with the individual particles showing positional fluctuations. Carefully adding 2 wt % LiCl to this system leads {{to the formation of}} a weakly aggregated network, in which the crystal-like order gets lost and the particles lose their mobility. On indenting into these aggregated layers, the CSLM recordings showed imprints that closely resembled {{the size and shape of}} the indenter. A more accurate inspection of the structural changes was allowed after localizing all silica particles in three dimensions. Calculated local concentrations and coordination numbers showed that even at the level of these highly local quantities, no deformation gradients could be observed in the vicinity of the probe. Particle image velocimetry analysis suggested that deformation occurs mostly in the lateral directions. On pulling the indenter out, adhesion between the silica particles and the glass indenter became manifest via a distortion of the initially spherical dent and lower coordination numbers under the dent. Together all these behaviors indicate that the aggregated layers behave like yield-stress materials, which are solidlike up to a critical stress and liquidlike above it.

Syngas fermentation, a hybrid process integrating the thermochemical (i. e. gasification of feedstock to syngas) and biochemical (i. e. microbial fermentation of syngas) conversions, has been considered as a promising technology for production of lignocellulosic-biomass-derived ethanol. The challenge to commercialize syngas fermentation, though, is to enhance the gas-to-liquid mass transfer rate due to the low solubilities of carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrogen (H 2) in an energy-efficient manner. Conventional suspended-growth bioreactors, such as continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR) and bubble column reactor (BCR), suffer from inefficient mass transfer and unwanted cell washout at high dilution rate, resulting to low productivities. The present study explored the feasibility of applying three innovative attached-growth bioreactor systems, hollow fiber membrane biofilm reactor (HFM-BR), monolithic biofilm reactor (MBR) and rotating packed bed biofilm reactor (RPB-BR), in continuous syngas fermentation, {{in order to enhance}} mass transfer of CO and to maximize ethanol production, by optimizing selected operational parameters. The highest ethanol productivity of HFM-BR, MBR and RPB-BR was achieved at 3. 44 g/L/day, 2. 35 g/L and 6. 70 g/L/day with optimized fermentation operational condition, respectively. HFM-BR showed the highest CO kLa (1096. 2 hour- 1) among the three bioreactor systems; however, the costly membrane and biofouling issue are the drawbacks to conduct continuous syngas fermentation with high ethanol productivity for extended period of time. MBR showed modest performance of CO mass transfer rate and ethanol productivity, but it has inherent advantages such as high mechanical strength and less biofouling problem. With installation of an in-situ washing device, the microchannel-clogging problem could potentially be resolved, indicating its capability of extended periods of continuous fermentation. RPB-BR gave the highest ethanol productivity with a simple <b>mechanical</b> design, inexpensive <b>packing</b> media and stable operation.

40|$|Lecturepg. 93 Centrifugal pump design {{plays an}} {{essential}} role in the safe operation of any refinery or chemical processing plant. In analyzing the performance of centrifugal pumps, pump operating time to failure is almost always limited to that of the shaft mechanical seal. Mechanical seals and their sophisticated supporting systems have become more complicated as the pumping industry perseveres in its efforts to produce satisfactorily seal life. Numerous research projects have proceeded, many papers demonstrating seal leakage have been presented, but the overall progress in extending seal life has not been to everyone?s satisfaction. A viable and important option, therefore, is a centrifugal pump that does not require mechanical seals. A magnetically driven sealless pump is such a machine. It conveys liquid safely with no dynamic seal between the motor shaft and the impeller(s). There is no potential leakage path, since prime mover energy is transmitted magnetically through the pressure casing wall. Magnet drive pumps are capable of producing flow rates to 5000 gpm and heads to 1000 ft. Temperatures ranging from - 100 ?F to + 850 ?F, and system pressure to 5000 psi can be accommodated without the need for any ancillary services or supporting systems. Likewise, the magnet drive pump is excellent for high vacuum services where sealing mechanically may prove extremely difficult. Sealless pumps generally are thought to be intolerant of solids in pumpage. However, magnet drive pump designs are now available with substantially improved performance in abrasive services. The magnet drive centrifugal pump is simply a conventional centrifugal pump with an integral magnetic coupling imposed between the driver and the liquid end. This magnetic coupling replaces the seal chamber or stuffing box {{in such a way that}} the liquid end is made hermetic.

Ferrofluids have a great potential for development in the medical applications, <b>mechanical</b> engineering, electronic <b>packing</b> aerospace, etc. [1, 2, 3, 4]. The low toxicity and water-soluble qualities of some polymers such as poly(ethylene glycol), PEG make them suitable for industrial applications.

Rheological measurements also give the useful information for designing the colloidal solutions in the food industry, paint industry and heat transfer applications [6]. Because of large application field of ferrofluids, colloidal solutions containing Fe 2 O 3 nanoparticles and polymers are topic of interest for some authors in the recent years. For example, the molar heat capacity for water-based α-Fe 2 O 3 nanofluid prepared over a simple biomolecule-assisted hydrothermal method was measured by a high-precision automatic adiabatic calorimeter at T = (290 – 335) K by Wei et al.

Thermal transport properties for these nanofluids were also investigated by Guo et al. [8]. Colla et al. [9] measured the viscosity and thermal conductivity of water-based Fe 2 O 3 nanofluid. Influence of the several surfactants in the colloidal stability, particle size distribution and thermal conductivity of water-based α-Fe 2 O 3 nanofluids have been investigated by Gayadhthri et al.
