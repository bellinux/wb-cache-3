25|$|As many indentured {{workers were}} illiterate, {{especially}} Africans, there were opportunities for abuse by planters and other indenture holders. Some ignored the expiration of servants' indentured contracts {{and tried to}} keep them as lifelong workers. One example is with Anthony Johnson, who argued with Robert Parker, another planter, over the status of John Casor, formerly an indentured servant of his. Johnson argued that his indenture was for life and Parker had interfered with his rights. The court {{ruled in favor of}} Johnson and ordered that Casor be returned to him, where he served {{the rest of his life}} as a slave. Such documented cases <b>marked</b> <b>the</b> <b>transformation</b> of Negroes from indentured servants into slaves.|$|E

However, under the policy of Privy Purse nobles were allowed to enjoy certain privileges and keep their titles. But this policy was abolished in 1971 by the [...] twenty-sixth Amendment of the Constitution of India. Thus the title of the [...] "Nawab Bahadur of Murshidabad" [...] was officially, constitutionally and [...] legally abolished in 1971. Thus, as titles have been abolished in India, the title of the Nawab Bahadur of Murshidabad no longer exists. However, Abbas Ali Meerza can now succeed Waris Ali Meerza's office legally, but his title of the fourth Nawab Bahadur of Murshidabad would be unofficial, as the title is not legally and officially recognised.|$|E
