5|$|MAO-B inhibitors (safinamide, {{selegiline}} and rasagiline) {{increase the}} amount of dopamine in the basal ganglia by inhibiting the activity of <b>monoamine</b> <b>oxidase</b> <b>B</b> (MAO-B), an enzyme which breaks down dopamine. Like dopamine agonists, their use may delay the commencement of levodopa therapy in early disease, but MAO-B inhibitors produce more adverse effects and are less effective than levodopa at controlling PD motor symptoms. There are few studies of their effectiveness in the advanced stage, although results suggest that they are useful to reduce fluctuations between on and off periods. An initial study indicated that selegiline in combination with levodopa increased the risk of death, but this was later disproven.|$|E

A renewed interest in <b>monoamine</b> <b>oxidase</b> type <b>B</b> inhibitors {{in the treatment of}} Parkinson disease has emerged after recent clinical trials of agents in this class. The use of selegiline monotherapy in early Parkinson disease is supported by the results of a large well-controlled trial in 800 patients (DATATOP) and several other studies, which demonstrated a symptomatic benefit, a reduction in disability, and a delay in the need to start levodopa therapy. Administered with levodopa in studies of up to 5 years' duration in patients with more advanced disease, selegiline improved disease-related disability, reduced the end-of-dose motor fluctuations, and also led to a reduction of the dose and dose frequency of levodopa required. Selegiline was the first drug to be investigated as a possible neuroprotective agent in patients with Parkinson disease, based on preclinical studies indicating protection of dopaminergic neurons from damage. The results of the extensive body of clinical trials, including delayed and lower levodopa requirements, may indeed suggest that selegiline, in addition to conferring symptomatic benefit, may have other effects on disease progression. Selegiline is well tolerated, and initial fears of increased mortality with the drug have not been borne out by subsequent robust meta-analyses...|$|R

50|$|Monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) {{generally}} metabolizes tyramine, norepinephrine (NE), serotonin (5-HT), and dopamine (DA) (and {{other less}} clinically relevant chemicals). In contrast, <b>Monoamine</b> <b>oxidase</b> <b>B</b> (MAOB) mainly metabolizes dopamine (DA) (and other less clinically relevant chemicals). The {{differences between the}} substrate selectivity of the two enzymes are utilized clinically when treating specific disorders: Monoamine oxidase A inhibitors have been typically used {{in the treatment of}} depression, and <b>monoamine</b> <b>oxidase</b> <b>B</b> inhibitors are typically used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. Nonspecific (i.e. MAOA/B combined) inhibitors can pose problems when taken concomitantly with tyramine-containing foods such as cheese, because the drug's inhibition of MAOA causes a dangerous elevation of serum tyramine levels, which can lead to hypertensive symptoms. Selective MAOB inhibitors bypass this problem by preferentially inhibiting MAOB, which mostly metabolizes DA.

40|$|Abstract: <b>Monoamine</b> <b>oxidase</b> (MAO) <b>B</b> is {{considered}} a key enzyme in dopamine metabolism. The present stud-ies, conducted in MAO B knockout mice, show that lack of MAO B does not alter extracellular levels of dopamine in striatum. Similarly, the synthesis, storage, uptake, and release of dopamine are also unaltered. However, auto-radiography revealed a significant up-regulation of the D 2 -like dopamine receptors in the striatum of MAO B knockout mice. Mutant mice also exhibit a functional supersensitivity of D 1 -dopamine receptors in the nucleus accumbens. Thus, the agonist SKF 38, 393 -induced c-Fos immunoreactivity was significantly increased in knockout mice as compared with wild-type controls. In view of the apparently normal basal dopamine dynamics observed in MAO B knockout mice, we hypothesize tha...|$|R
