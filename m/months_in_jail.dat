5|$|In the 1980s Adkins again {{found himself}} {{in trouble with the}} law. In 1983 he was living with his girlfriend who was still a minor. Her mother {{reported}} to police that she had been raped, and Adkins was subsequently charged with third-degree sexual assault, although the girl insisted the sexual acts were consensual. In October the same year, another relationship ended with jail time, when a shootout occurred between Adkins and a jealous husband. No one was hurt, but Adkins was charged with felony illegal possession of a shotgun and spent five <b>months</b> <b>in</b> <b>jail.</b>|$|E
5|$|Federal law {{states that}} {{national}} parks {{will have the}} same underage laws as the state that they are located in, and the Assimilative Crimes Act is applicable to New Jersey's underage drinking statute. Thus, in a private location, such as a cabin in a federal enclave in New Jersey, a parent can serve alcohol to their child, and an underage person can possess and consume alcohol. Outside of these exceptions, underage drinking and serving alcohol to a minor are federal misdemeanors, punishable by a fine and up to 6 <b>months</b> <b>in</b> <b>jail.</b> There is a five-year statute of limitations for DUI, underage drinking, and other alcohol violations that take place in federal enclaves.|$|E
5|$|If found, punishments {{ranged from}} death, {{to time in}} the pillory, to being ordered never to dress as a man again. Henry Fielding wrote a {{pamphlet}} titled The Female Husband in 1746, based {{on the life of}} Mary Hamilton, who was arrested after marrying a woman while masquerading as a man, and was sentenced to public whipping and six <b>months</b> <b>in</b> <b>jail.</b> Similar examples were procured of Catharine Linck in Prussia in 1717, executed in 1721; Swiss Anne Grandjean married and relocated with her wife to Lyons, but was exposed by a woman with whom she had had a previous affair and sentenced to time in the stocks and prison.|$|E

5|$|In January 1976, California's {{study of}} the {{economic}} impact of its law repealing prohibitions of use went into effect. The law reduced the penalty for personal possession of an ounce or less of marijuana from a felony to a citable misdemeanor with a maximum fine of $100. Possession of more than an ounce was made a misdemeanor, making the maximum fine $500 and/or six <b>months</b> <b>in</b> <b>jail.</b> After the law went into effect, the state's annual spending towards marijuana laws went down 74%. Prior to the law, the state had been spending from $35 million to $100 million.|$|E
5|$|Jackson's {{earliest}} public controversy {{came when}} he was linked to alleged Nigerian drug trafficker Pius Ailemen. Ailemen {{was supposed to be}} Jackson's best man at his 1991 wedding, but canceled at the last minute due to supposed passport-related issues. Jackson and Aileman were investigated by the FBI; the investigation and court proceedings extended for several years. A wiretap recorded many conversations between the two, and financial records indicate that Ailemen had purchased an Alfa Romeo using a $13,000 charge on Jackson's credit card. Ailemen was sentenced to 24 years and four <b>months</b> <b>in</b> <b>jail.</b> In 2003, Ailemen was denied petition for a writ of certiorari. Ailemen's current motion questions Jackson's activities as a government informant {{at the time of his}} testimony in Ailemen's trial.|$|E
5|$|Non-aggravated {{offences}} involving damage {{valued at}} less than £5,000 are triable only summarily by magistrates and the maximum sentence is three months' imprisonment and a fine of £2,500.

Santos will remain free pending the outcome of the appeal process. Four other controllers were acquitted for lack of proof. On 17 May 2011, Judge Mendes sentenced air traffic controller Lucivando Tiburcio de Alencar to a term of up to three years and four months but ruled he is eligible to do community service in Brazil instead and acquitted Santos on charges of harming Brazil's air transport safety.|$|E
5|$|The state underage {{drinking}} {{statute is}} a disorderly persons offense (misdemeanor), which upon conviction is punishable {{by up to}} 6 <b>months</b> <b>in</b> <b>jail</b> (rarely imposed), a $500–$1000 fine, and a mandatory 6-month suspension of the person's driver's license. The penalties are the same for using fake identification. Those who unlawfully serve alcohol to an underage person, entice an underage person to drink, knowingly permit underage drinking on their property, or bring alcohol onto a public school property face similar sanctions, except that their driver's license will not be suspended. A licensed business which serves alcohol to a person under age 21, even unintentionally, may be fined or have their liquor license suspended or revoked.|$|E
5|$|A {{native of}} Texas, Applewhite {{attended}} several universities and, {{as a young}} man, served in the United States Army. After finishing school at Austin College, he taught music at the University of Alabama. He later returned to Texas, where he led choruses and served as {{the chair of the}} music department at the University of St. Thomas in Houston. He left the school in 1970, citing emotional turmoil. His father's death a year later brought on severe depression. In 1972, he developed a close friendship with Bonnie Nettles, a nurse; together, they discussed mysticism at length and concluded that they were called as divine messengers. They operated a bookstore and teaching center for a short while, and then began to travel around the U.S. in 1973 to spread their views. They only gained one convert. In 1975, Applewhite was arrested for failing to return a rental car and was jailed for six <b>months.</b> <b>In</b> <b>jail,</b> he further developed his theology.|$|E

5|$|In late 1916 he was {{approached}} by Fasih al-Ayyubi in hope that Quwatli could help him secure an escape route for his ailing father, Shukri al-Ayyubi, who was arrested by the Ottomans, like he did for Nasib al-Bakri. However, despite Quwatli's refusal to help, Ottoman authorities tracked down the contact and arrested both men. Quwatli was subjected to further torture to coerce him to reveal the names of his al-Fatat colleagues. In an attempt to prevent himself from surrendering the names, Quwatli tried to commit suicide. After cutting his wrists, Quwatli's life was saved {{at the last minute}} by fellow inmate, al-Fatat member and practicing doctor, Ahmad Qadri. He spent four more <b>months</b> <b>in</b> <b>jail,</b> before being released on bail by his relative, Shafiq al-Quwatli, who served as a deputy at the Ottoman Parliament, on 28 January 1917. His experience in jail and the story about his attempted suicide turned Quwatli into a nationalist hero in Syria.|$|E
5|$|Grant {{replaced}} Richardson as Treasury Secretary with Benjamin H. Bristow, a {{man known}} for his honesty, who {{began a series of}} reforms in the department. Since the Civil War, whiskey distillers and corrupt treasury agents falsified figures on the amount of liquor produced, while certifying bogus returns, denying the treasury of revenue. Discovering that millions of gallons of whiskey escaped taxation, and having Grant's endorsement to act ("Let no guilty man escape"), Bristow in May 1875 struck at the Whiskey Ring. He ordered federal marshals to seize 32 installations and arrest 350 men; Bristow obtained 176 indictments that led to 110 convictions, and giving $3,150,000 to the Treasury. Bristow's investigation implicated Babcock and Missouri treasury agent John McDonald as part of the Whiskey Ring. When informed on separate occasions, Grant became defensive concerning Babcock, but concerning McDonald, the ringleader, Grant believed he had been betrayed. In 1876, a jury acquitted Babcock at a trial influenced by Grant's deposition in Babcock's favor. After the trial, Grant dismissed Babcock from the White House. Grant freed some Ring members after a few months in prison, including McDonald, released after serving 17 <b>months</b> <b>in</b> <b>jail.</b>|$|E
5|$|Michael the Brave, Voivode of Wallachia, and Ștefan Răzvan, Voivode of Moldavia, {{acknowledged}} his suzerainty. Their united forces defeated an Ottoman {{army in the}} Battle of Giurgiu. The triumph {{was followed}} by a series of Ottoman victories, and Sigismund abdicated in favor of Rudolph II in early 1598, receiving the duchies of Racibórz and Opole as a compensation. His maternal uncle, Stephen Bocskai, persuaded him to return in late summer, but he could not make peace with the Ottoman Empire. He renounced Transylvania in favor of Andrew Báthory and settled in Poland in 1599. During the following years, Transylvania was regularly pillaged by unpaid mercenaries and Ottoman marauders. Sigismund returned {{at the head of a}} Polish army in 1601, but he could not strengthen his position. He again abdicated in favor of Rudolph and settled in Bohemia in July 1602. After he was accused of a conspiracy against the emperor, he spent fourteen <b>months</b> <b>in</b> <b>jail</b> in Prague in 1610 and 1611. He died at his Bohemian estate.|$|E

5|$|On 29 May 1842, Victoria {{was riding}} in a {{carriage}} along The Mall, London, when John Francis aimed a pistol at her but the gun did not fire; he escaped. The following day, Victoria drove the same route, though faster and with a greater escort, in a deliberate attempt to provoke Francis {{to take a second}} aim and catch him in the act. As expected, Francis shot at her, but he was seized by plain-clothes policemen, and convicted of high treason. On 3 July, two days after Francis's death sentence was commuted to transportation for life, John William Bean also tried to fire a pistol at the Queen, but it was loaded only with paper and tobacco and had too little charge. Edward Oxford felt that the attempts were encouraged by his acquittal in 1840. Bean was sentenced to 18 <b>months</b> <b>in</b> <b>jail.</b> In a similar attack in 1849, unemployed Irishman William Hamilton fired a powder-filled pistol at Victoria's carriage as it passed along Constitution Hill, London. In 1850, the Queen did sustain injury when she was assaulted by a possibly insane ex-army officer, Robert Pate. As Victoria was {{riding in a}} carriage, Pate struck her with his cane, crushing her bonnet and bruising her forehead. Both Hamilton and Pate were sentenced to seven years' transportation.|$|E
