5|$|COPD {{develops}} as {{a significant}} and chronic inflammatory response to inhaled irritants. Chronic bacterial infections may also add to this inflammatory state. The inflammatory cells involved include neutrophil granulocytes and macrophages, two types of white blood cell. Those who smoke additionally have Tc1 lymphocyte involvement and some people with COPD have eosinophil involvement {{similar to that in}} asthma. Part of this cell response is brought on by inflammatory <b>mediators</b> such as chemotactic factors. Other processes involved with lung damage include oxidative stress produced by high concentrations of free radicals in tobacco smoke and released by inflammatory cells, and breakdown of the connective tissue of the lungs by proteases that are insufficiently inhibited by protease inhibitors. The destruction of the connective tissue of the lungs is what leads to emphysema, which then contributes to the poor airflow and, finally, poor absorption and release of respiratory gases. General muscle wasting that often occurs in COPD may be partly due to inflammatory <b>mediators</b> released by the lungs into the blood.|$|E

5|$|The {{symptoms}} of the common cold {{are believed to be}} primarily related to the immune response to the virus. The mechanism of this immune response is virus specific. For example, the rhinovirus is typically acquired by direct contact; it binds to human ICAM-1 receptors through unknown mechanisms to trigger the release of inflammatory <b>mediators.</b> These inflammatory <b>mediators</b> then produce the symptoms. It does not generally cause damage to the nasal epithelium. The respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), on the other hand, is contracted by direct contact and airborne droplets. It then replicates in the nose and throat before frequently spreading to the lower respiratory tract. RSV does cause epithelium damage. Human parainfluenza virus typically results in inflammation of the nose, throat, and bronchi. In young children when it affects the trachea it may produce the {{symptoms of}} croup due to the small size of their airways.|$|E

We recently identified a mammalian homologue of yeast <b>Mediator</b> subunit Med 8 and partially purified a Med 8 -containing <b>Mediator</b> complex from rat liver nuclei (Brower, C.

40|$|<b>Mediator</b> is a multi-unit {{molecular}} complex that {{plays a key}} role in transferring signals from transcriptional regulators to RNA polymerase II in eukaryotes. We have combined biochemical purification of the Sac-charomyces cerevisiae <b>Mediator</b> from chromatin with chromatin immunoprecipitation in order to reveal <b>Mediator</b> occupancy on DNA genome-wide, and to identify proteins interacting specifically with <b>Mediator</b> on the chromatin template. Tandem mass spectrometry of proteins in immunoprecipitates of <b>mediator</b> complexes revealed specific interactions between <b>Mediator</b> and the RSC, Arp 2 /Arp 3, CPF, CF 1 A and Lsm complexes in chromatin. These factors are primarily involved in chromatin remodeling, actin assembly, mRNA 3 '-end processing, gene looping and mRNA decay, but they have also been shown to enter the nucleus and participate in Pol II transcription. Moreover, we have found that <b>Mediator,</b> in addition to binding Pol II promoters, occupies chromosomal interacting domain (CID) boundaries and that <b>Mediator</b> in chromatin associates with proteins that have been shown to interact with CID boundaries, such as Sth 1, Ssu 72 and histone H 4.

These opportunities exist at the wrapper level, at the <b>mediator</b> level, and at the interface of the wrapper and <b>mediator.</b> At the wrapper level, a wrapper typically utilizes an extractor to extract objects by following links to multiple pages on the WebSource. For optimization, the number of accesses to the WebSource, across some wide-area network, or duplicate accesses to the same page by the extractor, must be minimized. The wrapper will also provide a cost estimation of the wrapper query. This cost will be used by the <b>mediator</b> to select a possibly optimal <b>mediator</b> plan. At the <b>mediator</b> level, the <b>mediator</b> has to explore the space of possibly execution plans to choose the one with the lowest cost.

40|$|Background: The <b>Mediator</b> complex {{associates}} with RNA polymerase (Pol) II, {{and it is}} recruited to enhancer regions by activator proteins under appropriate environmental conditions. However, the issue of <b>Mediator</b> association in yeast cells is controversial. Under optimal growth conditions (YPD medium), {{we were unable to}} detect <b>Mediator</b> at essentially any S. cerevisiae promoter region, including those supporting very high levels of transcription. In contrast, whole genome microarray experiments in synthetic complete (SC) medium reported that <b>Mediator</b> {{associates with}} many genes at both promoter and coding regions. Principal Findings: As assayed by chromatin immunoprecipitation, we show that there are a small number of <b>Mediator</b> targets in SC medium that are not observed in YPD medium. However, most <b>Mediator</b> targets identified in the genome-wide analysis are false positives that arose for several interrelated reasons: the use of overly lenient cut-offs; artifactual differences in apparent IP efficiencies among different genomic regions in the untagged strain; low fold-enrichments making it difficult to distinguish true <b>Mediator</b> targets from false positives that occur {{in the absence of the}} tagged <b>Mediator</b> protein. Lastly, apparent <b>Mediator</b> association in highly active coding regions is due to a non-specific effect on accessibility due to the lack of nucleosomes, not to a specific association of <b>Mediator.</b> Conclusions: These results indicate that <b>Mediator</b> does not bind to numerous sites in the yeast genome, but rathe...|$|R

40|$|<b>Mediator</b> {{has been}} shown to be {{essential}} for regulation of RNA Polymerase II mediated transcription. <b>Mediator</b> functions as an interface between the general transcriptional machinery and a multitude of DNA binding transcriptional regulators, although the molecular mechanism for the process is elusive. <b>Mediator</b> is a large complex of over twenty subunits, most of which are conserved from yeast to plants to mammals. Many of these subunits are essential for viability in yeast, and mutations in the corresponding genes have global effects on transcription. <b>Mediator</b> was originally identified in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, but has since been described in most eukaryotes. However, until recently the <b>Mediator</b> complex was not identified in plants. This thesis describes the first successful identification and isolation of the <b>Mediator</b> complex from the plant Arabidopsis thaliana. By raising antibodies against candidate A. thaliana <b>Mediator</b> subunits, we were able to purify a multisubunit protein complex. Mass spectrometry and bioinformatics analysis allowed us to identify 21 of these subunits as conserved <b>Mediator</b> components and six as A. thaliana specific subunits. Some of the genes that encode the identified <b>Mediator</b> subunits had earlier been described as components of specific regulatory pathways controlling for example cell proliferation and flowering time. Subsequent genetic analysis confirmed that the A. thaliana <b>Mediator</b> complex is important for several plant signaling pathways, including flowering and stress pathways. This thesis also describes identification of regulators that interact with the A. thaliana <b>Mediator</b> subunit Med 25, previously identified as PFT 1 (Phytochrome and Flowering Time 1) and implicated in regulation of flowering time in response to light quality. Finally, we describe the function of <b>Mediator</b> in S. cerevisiae using genome-wide approaches. We have carried out a transcriptional switch where half of the genome changes expression and determined <b>Mediator</b> occupancy across the genome before and after such a switch, using ChIP-SEQ on tagged subunits from different <b>Mediator</b> domains. Unexpectedly, we find that <b>Mediator</b> occupancy is limited at most promoters. However, at the highly occupied promoters, we see different modes of changes in occupancy as a result of the transcriptional switch. These highly occupied promoters control genes involved in different stress response pathways. Thus, our results suggest that <b>Mediator</b> function and composition differ considerably between different promoters...|$|R
