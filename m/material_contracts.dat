40|$|Abstract Over {{the past}} decades, {{business}} model innovation in product and its {{service has been}} growing rapidly, especially for durable goods. Companies shift their strategies from selling physical products to delivering solutions and performance for customers. Within this context, the outcome-based service contracts, such as Performance-based Logistics and Power-by-the-Hour, have been developed in both public and commercial industry. At the same time, traditional service contracts such as Warranty and Time & <b>Material</b> <b>contracts</b> are still being used in many occasions. Under various business models, managing the after-sales service and product support becomes increasingly challenging. In this thesis, we study several important service contracting problems concerning optimal design of contract terms, spare parts inventory and service capacity management, and service outsourcing management. We provide managerial insights for selecting the best service contract, choosing the right performance measurement, optimally managing the service resources (spare parts and repair capacity), and incentivizing the supplier to improve the profit of the after-sales service and product support supply chains...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{studies the}} pricing of {{software}} development outsourcing. Two pricing techniques – time and material and fixed price – are described {{and the economic}} conditions for selecting between them are discussed. Using agency theory and transaction cost economics, it is predicted that risky and specific systems will be priced on time and material basis while other projects will be fixed price. An additional prediction is that confidence in the vendor’s auditing of resources is essential for time and <b>material</b> <b>contracts.</b> The predictions are tested on fourteen external software development projects in two large corporations. Quantitative measures of risk, specificity and confidence are utilised, but the data-set {{does not support the}} theoretical predictions. In order to explain this result, interviews with senior managers at the two corporations have been conducted.

40|$|Using a {{proprietary}} dataset {{provided by a}} major manufacturer of aircraft engines, we empirically investigate the impact of incentives present in after-sales repair and maintenance support contracts on product reliability. In particular, we compare the reliability of products under time and <b>material</b> <b>contracts</b> (T&MC), which have been used traditionally in the aerospace industry, with the reliability under performance-based contracts (PBC), which are gaining wide acceptance. Adverse selection of customers into contract types, and consequently the endogeneity of contract choice, is explicitly modeled {{by means of a}} two-stage econometric model. After controlling for this selection process, we find evidence for the positive and significant effect of performance incentives created by PBC on product reliability. We test this hypothesis using a number of reliability proxies, alternative model specifications, and we perform a number of robustness checks. Our estimates indicate an improvement of product reliability in the 20 - 40 % range under PBC, compared to the reliability observed under T&MCs. Our research provides a valuable input into the ongoing policy debate about the effectiveness of performance-based maintenance contracts which are currently being introduced extensively in both the government and the private sectors. ...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} a firm 2 ̆ 7 s decision to redact proprietary information from its material contract filings. Information redaction results when the Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) grants a firm 2 ̆ 7 s request to withhold information from investors in its material contract filings, presumably because {{the information is}} proprietary. We hypothesize that when firms redact information, measures of adverse selection deteriorate. That is, the redaction of proprietary information from <b>material</b> <b>contracts</b> should be associated with: a larger adverse selection component of the bid-ask spread, reductions in market depth, and lower market turnover. In addition, we conjecture {{that the decision to}} redact depends on whether the firm plans on raising capital, the competitiveness of the firm 2 ̆ 7 s industry, and the performance of the firm. Overall the results of our analysis generally support our predictions. We find that when firms redact information, contemporaneous measures of the adverse selection component of the bid-ask spread rise, and market depth and share turnover deteriorate; this suggests an increase in adverse selection. We also find firms are less likely to redact when they issue long-term debt {{and are more likely to}} redact when they are in a competitive industry or experience losses...|$|E
40|$|In {{the defense}} industry, {{traditional}} sourcing arrangements for after-sales support of weapons systems (“products”) have centered around physical assets. Typically, the customer, a military service, {{would pay the}} supplier of maintenance services for the material resources, such as spare parts, that were needed to maintain the products. In recent years, we have witnessed {{the emergence of a}} new service contracting strategy called Performance-Based Logistics (PBL). Under PBL, the basis of supplier compensation is actual realized uptime of the product. The goal of this paper is to compare the inefficiencies arising under the traditional material contract and the PBL contract. In both cases, the customer sets the contract terms, and as a response, the supplier sets the base-stock inventory level of spare products as well as invests in increasing product reliability. We find that the PBL contract provides stronger incentives for the supplier to invest in reliability improvement and lowers incentives to invest in spare product assets. Moreover, the efficiency of the PBL contract improves if the supplier owns a larger portion of the spare assets. Our analysis advocates usage of the PBL contracts in favor of <b>material</b> <b>contracts</b> and supports a DoD recommendation for transforming suppliers into total service providers...|$|E

40|$|Gripping {{and holding}} of objects are key tasks for robotic manipulators. The {{development}} of universal grippers {{able to pick}} up unfamiliar objects of widely varying shape and surface properties remains, however, challenging. Most current designs are based on the multi-fingered hand, but this approach introduces hardware and software complexities. These include large numbers of controllable joints, the need for force sensing if objects are to be handled securely without crushing them, and the computational overhead to decide how much stress each finger should apply and where. Here we demonstrate a completely different approach to a universal gripper. Individual fingers are replaced by a single mass of granular material that, when pressed onto a target object, flows around it and conforms to its shape. Upon application of a vacuum the granular <b>material</b> <b>contracts</b> and hardens quickly to pinch and hold the object without requiring sensory feedback. We find that volume changes of less than 0. 5 % suffice to grip objects reliably and hold them with forces exceeding many times their weight. We show that the operating principle is the ability of granular materials to transition between an unjammed, deformable state and a jammed state with solid-like rigidity. We delineate three separate mechanisms, friction, suction and interlocking, that contribute to the gripping force. Using a simple model we relate each of them to the mechanical strength of the jammed state. This opens up new possibilities for the design of simple, yet highly adaptive systems that excel at fast gripping of complex objects. Comment: 10 pages, 7 figure...|$|E
40|$|Starch {{microcellular}} foams (SMCF) containing pores in the micron {{size range}} may be prepared by pore-preserving drying processes, developing highly porous, high specific surface area materials useful for {{applications such as}} opacifying pigments or as adsorbent materials. The objective {{of this research was}} to understand how the exchange of water with ethanol, used as a pore preserving step, affected the dimensional properties of the starch material during and after processing. SMCF were prepared from molded aquagels of cooked corn starch that were subjected to ethanol exchanges with different time intervals (6, 12, or 48 hrs) and number of exchanges (1, 2, or 3) and then air dried. To study the transformation of water-swollen starch into precipitated starch foam in ethanol, the volume of the starch material was measured in the wet state after each exchange and after final air drying. As water is replaced by ethanol, the starch <b>material</b> <b>contracts,</b> with the greatest contraction during the first ethanol exchange. The amount of contraction during air drying decreased with decreased starch water content just before air drying, presumably due to less pore collapse of the stiffer cell walls on drying. Interestingly, the minimum density of 0. 37 g/cc SMCF was for the 12 hour exchange time, not the longest exchange time. Evidence of a skin-core morphology included SEM images as well as dimensional instability data on dried samples. The results indicate that SMCF of low density with fewer tendencies to deform during drying does not necessarily require extremely long exchange times...|$|E
40|$|We {{present an}} atomistic-continuum model to {{simulate}} ultrashort laser-induced melting processes in semiconductor solids on {{the example of}} silicon. The kinetics of transient non-equilibrium phase transition mechanisms is addressed with a Molecular Dynamics method at atomic level, whereas the laser light absorption, strong generated electron-phonon non-equilibrium, fast diffusion and heat conduction due to photo-excited free carriers are accounted for in the continuum. We give {{a detailed description of}} the model, which is then applied to study the mechanism of short laser pulse melting of free standing Si films. The effect of laser-induced pressure and temperature of the lattice on the melting kinetics is investigated. Two competing melting mechanisms, heterogeneous and homogeneous, were identified. Apart of classical heterogeneous melting mechanism, the nucleation of the liquid phase homogeneously inside the material significantly contributes to the melting process. The simulations showed, that due to the open diamond structure of the crystal, the laser-generated internal compressive stresses reduce the crystal stability against the homogeneous melting. Consequently, the latter can take a massive character within several picoseconds upon the laser heating. Due to negative volume of melting of modeled Si material, - 7. 5 %, the <b>material</b> <b>contracts</b> upon the phase transition, relaxes the compressive stresses and the subsequent melting proceeds heterogeneously until the excess of thermal energy is consumed. The threshold fluence value, at which homogeneous nucleation of liquid starts contributing to the classical heterogeneous propagation of the solid-liquid interface, is found from the series of simulations at different laser input fluences. On the example of Si, the laser melting kinetics of semiconductors was found to be noticeably different from that of metals with fcc crystal structure. Comment: 38 pages, 27 figure...|$|E

40|$|Autonomous microrobots ‘swimming’ through bodily fluids {{promise a}} major {{breakthrough}} {{in the fields of}} medicine and surgery. Targeted drug delivery, ablations, stents, implants, and remote sensing applications are among the envisioned applications. One of the biggest challenges in the design of these devices is the propulsion actuator. Within this thesis, Ionic Polymer Metal Composite (IPMC) is proposed for the design of a distributed actuator. This smart material consists of a polymer backbone that is permeable to cations, whilst being impermeable to anions. When an electric potential is applied over the thin platinum electrodes, the cations migrate towards the negative electrode, while the anions remain fixed. This results in an expansion near the negative electrode, due to the higher concentration. Simultaneously, the <b>material</b> <b>contracts</b> at the positive electrode. On the macro level, this results in a large bending deformation of the IPMC strip. Using an improved video processing algorithm, the curvature of a strip of IPMC is investigated. By analyzing the dynamic response in fluids of varying viscosity, it is shown that IPMC behaves well in low-Reynolds environments. Thereby, IPMC is shown to be a feasible actuator at microscale, where viscous forces dominate inertial forces. Next, a novel swelling based model in Comsol is proposed. Since it accurately shows the deformation shape, is easily adaptable, and has fast computation times, it is highly suitable for engineering purposes. Finally, a methodology is proposed for designing IPMC based bending tail actuators. Segmented IPMC is kinematically modeled with a constant curvature assumption. Using a nested optimization algorithm, the segmentation is designed for optimally attaining a desired wave shape. The traveling wave behavior is confirmed through the Comsol model. Hopefully, this work provides a basis for future work to build on, thereby giving new direction to the development of microrobots for medical purposes...|$|E
40|$|Actuators and linear motors are {{a common}} way to provide single axis motion and force. Rack and pinion, chain, belt, cable, screw, {{hydraulic}} and electric solenoid {{are a few of}} the many types of actuators available. All have inherent strengths and weakness such as power consumption, mechanical failure and usually a trade off with speed and resolution. The thesis investigation is to develop a linear motion actuator based on the magnetic material, Terfenol-D which alters its shape when subjected to a magnetic field. This phenomenon is known as magnetostriction which can be defined as a changing of a material's physical dimensions in response to its magnetization. Terfenol-D has the largest known magnetostriction, 2000 ppm at ambient temperatures [1], of all commercially available materials. Because of these large strains it is given the term Giant Magnetostriction (GM). In Terfenol-D the GM is dependent on the direction of the applied magnetic field with respect to the direction in the crystal: the material elongates in the direction of the field and, orthogonal to this, the <b>material</b> <b>contracts</b> within the principal of constant volume. This property has been exploited by other researchers in the past resulting in Terfenol-D being used as a short stroke conventional actuator in applications requiring large force at both high and low frequencies, generating a range of applications including surgical instruments, ultrasonic transducers and many others. It is this property of Terfenol-D that will be exploited in this project in the development of the magnetostrictive linear motor. Stepping motors based upon Giant Magnetostrictive (GM) materials are more complex actuators than those based on a more conventional design. To get a long stroke, they use the addition of several small steps, each produced by quasi static deformation of the GM materials. In this project the Kiesewetter Elastic Wave Motor using Terfenol-D, as referenced in the abstract, was used as the starting point for the design of a new Terfenol-D based motor. In particular, the project investigates different topologies of Terfenol-D in the design and construction of a Magnetostrictive Linear Moto...|$|E
40|$|There are {{numerous}} {{factors that can}} cause a road to deteriorate, such as the traffic type, traffic volume, failure of materials used and climatic conditions. All four of the above listed factors can contribute to permanent deformation, commonly called pavement rutting. Most permanent deformation tests and simulation models have concentrated primarily on material properties and traffic loads. The effects of the environmental conditions are often neglected in these models {{with only a few}} accounting for climatic effects. The damaging effect of moisture on pavements, specifically hot mix asphalt (HMA), is a significant environmental distress that should be considered. As pavement is subjected to freeze/thaw cycling, the material expands and contracts. During expansion, water can seep into permeable air voids created with the increased volume and freeze. When the <b>material</b> <b>contracts</b> during thawing, the water can propagate cracks created during freezing for further damage in the next freeze cycle, which can weaken the structural strength of a pavement layer. Over time, the repetition of freeze/thaw cycling deteriorates a pavement and can lead to lengthwise indentations in roads appearing as ruts if a moisture susceptible mix is below the surface mix. Surface mixes that are susceptible to moisture damage would experience raveling. Identifying pavements susceptible to moisture damage and the effects of moisture damage on the life of a pavement can reduce maintenance costs accrued with the placement of a poorly performing HMA;In this dissertation, the affect of moisture on HMA materials is evaluated via an Asphalt Pavement Analyzer (APA) and a modified Dynamic Shear Rheometer (DSR). It was found that moisture damage of specimens tested in an APA after one freeze/thaw cycle yields similar results as Tensile Strength Ratio testing after three freeze/thaw cycles. The APA is seen as a viable alternative for evaluating moisture susceptible mixes. A new protocol for a modified DSR is outline and evaluated using 21 field collected HMA mixes. It was concluded that the new test protocol and modification have potential for being used as a method to determine the moisture susceptibility of a binder...|$|E
