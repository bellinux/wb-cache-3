5|$|In November 2015, Dream Theater {{announced}} some European tour {{dates for}} early 2016. The next month, they announced North American tour dates beginning in April and ending in May. As the band felt that The Astonishing would lend itself well to a live performance, {{they decided to}} play the album in full for each show and hired a production company to help with their presentation. They also <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> to book historical concert halls and theaters such as Radio City Music Hall. Following {{the conclusion of the}} North American leg, the band moved on to South America before returning to the United States for another run of shows, officially wrapping up the tour in December 2016.|$|E
5|$|In April, 1972 he was reassigned {{from the}} SAC to TAC {{and to the}} 42nd Tactical Electronic Warfare Squadron (42 TEWS), 388th Tactical Fighter Wing, at Korat, Thailand. He was {{familiar}} with targeting both SAC missiles and SAC airplanes, {{was one of the}} most knowledgeable missile and electronic counter-measures experts in Vietnam, and it is likely that his situation was quickly reported to U.S. intelligence services. Very few Americans remained on the ground in Vietnam, and the NVA <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> to track particularly valuable personnel, even in Thailand. The North Vietnamese were probably supported by the Russians with decrypting American message traffic and they likely knew exactly who had parachuted into their midst. This ability was likely enabled by the then unknown American spy CWO John Anthony Walker, who had given the Soviets a radio cipher card and other high-value intelligence. Hambleton's capture would be a terrific blow to American airpower around the world and a huge prize for the North Vietnamese and indirectly, the Soviets. Hambleton said after the war that he felt sure if he were captured that he would never have been taken to Hanoi.|$|E
25|$|I always <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> {{to carry}} several extra {{copies of the}} {{leaflets}} with me whenever I was walking through the city – specifically for that purpose. Whenever I saw an opportune moment, I took it. Another Sophie Scholl quote.|$|E
50|$|The city's {{distinctive}} shape <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> rallying <b>point</b> for Allied bombers {{returning to}} England after raids on Germany.|$|R
6000|$|Jake {{told him}} and he nodded. [...] "I <b>made</b> <b>it</b> half <b>a</b> <b>point</b> more to port, but this compass swivels rather wildly. Where do you think she's bound?" ...|$|R
25|$|Stirling's key {{position}} as the lowest bridging point of the River Forth before it broadens towards the Firth of Forth, <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> focal <b>point</b> for travel north or south.|$|R
25|$|In 1974, Cassidy <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> to {{find and}} re-establish contact with his stepson. He {{eventually}} persuaded California {{to return to the}} mainland and give the band another shot. Andes worked with the duo for a while, but never intended to stay, as he {{was in the process of}} working with the group Firefall at the same time. Andes was replaced by former Frank Zappa sound engineer Barry Keene.|$|E
25|$|He {{helped in}} {{the repeal of}} the Test and Corporation Acts in May 1828. They {{required}} many officials to be communicants in the Anglican Church and penalised both nonconformists and Catholics. They were no longer enforced but were a matter of humiliation. Peel at first opposed the repeal but reversed himself and led the repeal, after consultation with Anglican Church leaders. In future religious issues he <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> to consult with church leaders from the major denominations.|$|E
25|$|Various other strict {{codes of}} conduct were to be obeyed by the {{governors}} and state officials. The principal officers were required to travel to Mecca {{on the occasion of}} the Hajj, during which people were free to present any complaint against them. In order to minimize the chances of corruption, Umar <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> to pay high salaries to the staff. Provincial governors received as much as five to seven thousand dirham annually besides their shares of the spoils of war (if they were also the commander in chief of the army of their sector).|$|E
50|$|During World War II, Niigata's {{strategic}} location {{between the}} capital of Tokyo and the Sea of Japan <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> key <b>point</b> for the transfer of settlers and military personnel to the Asian continent, including Manchukuo.|$|R
50|$|The trail system down to {{the ford}} at Rocky <b>Point</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> natural <b>point</b> to have <b>a</b> ferry. As long as Rocky Point {{was used as a}} Missouri River {{crossing}} point in the breaks, the ferry continued, from the 1880s to the late 1920s.|$|R
5000|$|They {{are also}} remembered for their sculpture-like [...] "hand job" [...] cable hanger, which resembled a fist {{reaching}} up and grabbing the rear brake cable. The Hand Job took an overlooked {{part of every}} other bike and <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> focal <b>point</b> for <b>an</b> Ibis, and as such symbolized the company.|$|R
25|$|George P. Wilbur, who {{was cast}} as Michael Myers for this film, wore hockey pads under the costume {{to make himself}} look more {{physically}} imposing. During filming, {{the cast and crew}} <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> to take it easy on Danielle Harris, as she was only a young child at the time, and made sure that she was not scared too badly and knew that none of it was real; to this end, Wilbur regularly removed the mask in front of her in order to remind her that it was just a movie and {{he was not going to}} hurt her.|$|E
25|$|Snow Patrol next did a month-long tour of US and Canada, {{following}} a hugely successful SXSW appearance and a sold out US Tour in March. The Duke Spirit and Augustana were booked as support acts. The tour included an in-store performance at HMV to kick-off the Canadian dates. An autograph session was held after the set. The band chose Denver specifically {{to be the}} location of the first concert. They had kept the city as a surprise location on a previous tour two years before and had visited there for the first time, expect lukewarm reaction. However, the concert sold out and the band had <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> to return in the future.|$|E
25|$|The platoon {{who rushed}} to Bo. Capaya {{in search of}} the rebel band found the barrio deserted, the {{inhabitants}} having fled for fear of Spanish reprisal. However, in an outlying field, they found a lone farmer tending his baritan, a small field of a special grass called barit that was sold and fed to calesa (carriage) horses. The farmer was Roman Payumu, a humble zacatero, a gatherer and provider of animal feed like grass for horses. Although illiterate and ignorant family man, he was very industrious and a good provider. He was a deeply religious man with an intense faith in God and a very devout Catholic. After selling all his barit grass to carriage drivers in the town marketplace every evening, he <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> to pray fervently at the Holy Rosary Parish Church in Angeles town proper. When the Quinario devotion, prior to the fiesta of Apung Mamacalulu, was instituted on October 23, 1897, he quickly volunteered as a regular cargador (bearer) of the Apu during processions where he was popularly known by his nickname, Duman.|$|E

50|$|Sturges {{decided to}} {{eliminate}} this dialogue, since although <b>it</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> which Sturges indeed wished to make, it did it too well.|$|R
50|$|Baldock's {{position}} at the crossing of two important thoroughfares, the Great North Road and the Icknield Way has <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> stopping <b>point</b> for <b>a</b> number of illustrious visitors, including Charles I, who passed through Baldock en route for London after his arrest in 1648 and supposedly Dick Turpin. Preacher John Wesley came to the town in 1747.|$|R
25|$|RENACE {{failed to}} attract {{considerable}} {{support among the}} Carlists. Its political base was reduced mostly to Catalonia, with adherence declared by some Traditionalist groupings from other regions, like Navarre, Vascongadas and Andalusia. No nationally recognized Carlist leader joined Sivatte, though some like Joaquín Baleztena voiced their support. In the early 1960s it became evident that RENACE instead of a dynamic renovating force {{turned out to be}} just another Carlist splinter faction, though its doctrinal purity and intransigence versus Francoism <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> of reference within the Traditionalist realm. While initially Sivatte might have envisioned the initiative as a political grouping, its limited appeal rendered those ambitions irrelevant; as a result, RENACE formatted itself in-between a symbol, a pressure group and a doctrinal think-tank. Its public activity consisted of publishing the Tiempos Criticos periodical, issuing various manifestos and especially of organising public rallies, usually styled as Catholic feasts and with systematically decreasing attendance. The group did not assume a formal structure, apart from forming its Junta Suprema. Historians differ as to how Juntas de Defensa del Carlismo, local initiatives emergent across Spain in 1962–63, were related to RENACE.|$|E
25|$|Ramla {{was part}} of the {{territory}} allotted to a proposed Arab state under the 1947 UN Partition Plan. However, Ramla's geographical location and its strategic position on the main supply route to Jerusalem <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> of contention during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. A bomb by the Jewish militia group Irgun went off in the Ramla market on February 18, killing 7 residents and injuring 45. After a number of unsuccessful raids on Ramla, the Israeli army launched Operation Dani. Ramla was captured on 12–12 July 1948, {{a few days after the}} capture of Lydda. The Arab resistance surrendered on July 12, and most of the remaining inhabitants were driven out on the orders of David Ben-Gurion. A disputed claim, advanced by scholars including Ilan Pappé, characterizes this as ethnic cleansing. After the Israeli capture, some 1,000 Arabs remained in Ramla, and more were transferred to the town by the IDF from outlying Arab settlements which the military wanted emptied. As of 2000, the total population of Arab refugees and their descendents with origins in Ramla was estimated by Benny Morris and other historians at 635,000.|$|E
500|$|Shiban began {{crafting}} {{his story}} by borrowing a nanobot plot {{that had been}} considered by various writers for several seasons. Shiban {{and the rest of}} the writers <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> to give Alex Krycek control over Skinner. In this manner, Skinner once again became a mysterious character, one whose true loyalties were being tested. Shiban noted that, [...] " [...] gives Skinner an agenda that Mulder doesn't know about [...] Which was something we ultimately used again in the seasonender , and will carry us into next year".|$|E
5000|$|It {{has been}} said that [...] "Stirling, like a huge brooch clasps Highlands and Lowlands together". Similarly [...] "he who holds Stirling, holds Scotland" [...] is often quoted.Stirling's key {{position}} as the lowest bridging point of the River Forth before it broadens towards the Firth of Forth, <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> focal <b>point</b> for travel north or south.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes,' said Philip; 'when old Sir Guy <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>an</b> especial <b>point</b> that {{my father}} should take the guardianship, he only consented on {{condition}} that my uncle should be joined with him; so now my uncle is alone in the trust, and I cannot help thinking something must have happened at Redclyffe. It is certainly not Sir Guy's writing.' ...|$|R
50|$|Nevertheless, its {{position}} between Asunción - in present Paraguay - and Buenos Aires <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>an</b> important middle <b>point,</b> especially {{because of its}} 55-metre-high lands that prevent flooding when the water level rises.|$|R
500|$|Hawks was a {{versatile}} director whose career includes comedies, dramas, gangster films, science fiction, film noir, and Westerns. Hawks's own functional {{definition of what}} constitutes a [...] "good movie" [...] is characteristic of his no-nonsense style: [...] "Three great scenes, no bad ones." [...] Hawks also defined a good director as [...] "someone who doesn't annoy you." [...] In Hawks's own words, his directing style is based on being enjoyable and straightforward. His style was very actor-focused and he <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> to take as few shots as possible, thereby preserving an inherent and natural humor for his comedic pieces.|$|E
500|$|Despite Euler's immense {{contribution}} to the Academy's prestige, he eventually incurred the ire of Frederick and ended up having to leave Berlin. The Prussian king had a large circle of intellectuals in his court and he found the mathematician unsophisticated and ill-informed on matters beyond numbers and figures. Euler was a simple, devoutly religious man who never questioned the existing social order or conventional beliefs, {{in many ways the}} polar opposite of Voltaire, who enjoyed a high place of prestige at Frederick's court. Euler was not a skilled debater and often <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> to argue subjects that he knew little about, making him the frequent target of Voltaire's wit. Frederick also expressed disappointment with Euler's practical engineering abilities: ...|$|E
500|$|In {{order to}} {{encourage}} the captains of the merchant ships of all countries which carry the lifeblood of the U.K., I <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> to attend the briefing conference of all captains and chief engineers before their departure. During the winter of '42–'43, when sinkings were at their worst, I could see when I told them of the measures by escort and air cover that were being taken for their protection and safety; I could see that they knew very well and that they knew I knew {{in spite of my}} brave words, that anything up to 25 per cent of them would probably not arrive in the U.K. in their own ships, and that probably half of that number would not arrive in the U.K. at all. But there was never a waver in their resolve – Admiral Murray.|$|E
50|$|Lewiston’s {{economy has}} {{historically}} been driven by agriculture and manufacturing activity. Lewiston’s location at {{the confluence of the}} Snake River and Clearwater River <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> natural distribution <b>point</b> due to its seaport.|$|R
50|$|On 27 March 1912, Keohane, {{along with}} Atkinson, {{attempted}} to find Scott and his polar party {{and bring them}} back to Cape Evans from the One Ton supply depot. Starting at Hut Point, the party only <b>made</b> <b>it</b> to <b>a</b> <b>point</b> eight miles south of Corner Camp. There they left a weeks provisions and returned to Cape Evans on 1 April.|$|R
50|$|The {{village was}} laid out in 1831. Its {{location}} directly on the Missouri River <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> popular shipping <b>point</b> for the farms and plantations of Callaway County. The name Portland stems from that activity.|$|R
500|$|Following {{the match}} Gallaher {{was asked if}} he was unhappy with any aspect of the game; he replied that [...] "the better team won and I am content." [...] When asked about Dallas's refereeing, he said: [...] "I have always <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> never to express a view {{regarding}} the referee in any match in which I have played". Gallaher was gracious in defeat, but Dixon was highly critical of both Dallas and the Welsh newspapers, who he accused of [...] "violently and unjustly" [...] attacking New Zealand's captain. Gallaher would later admit that he had been annoyed by this criticism, which he found unfair; he also pointed out that though the Welsh condemned the wing-forward position, they had themselves adopted some elements of it. Later during the tour, when discussing the issue of his feeding the ball into the scrum, he said: ...|$|E
500|$|The Battle of Towton was {{associated}} with a tradition previously upheld in the villages of Tysoe, Warwickshire. For centuries the villagers had <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> to clear an area on a slope of the Vale of the Red Horse on each anniversary of the engagement, exposing a large figure of a horse cut into the red soil. They claimed to do this to honour the Earl of Warwick's inspirational deed of slaying his horse to show his resolve to stand and fight with the common soldiers. Local historian Mary Dormer Harris believed that the villagers modified the original Red Horse, which dated to pre-historic times, to a version that reflected mediaeval horses. The tradition died in 1798 when the Inclosure Acts implemented by the English government redesignated the common land, on which the equine figure was located, as private property. [...] The scouring was revived during the early 20th century but has since stopped.|$|E
500|$|Akbar's son, Emperor Jahangir, also {{continued}} {{the practice of}} Jharokha Darshan. In Agra Fort, the jharokha window {{is part of the}} structure which represents the Shah Burj, the Royal Tower. The tower is in the shape of an octagon and has a white marble pavilion. During Jahangir's time and even more frequently under Shah Jahan's rule this jharokha was used for giving darshan. During Jahangir's Jharokha Darshan, hanging a string to tie petitions, was also practiced. This was also a Persian system under naushrwan. Jahangir elaborated on this system by adopting a golden chain to tie the petitions but Aurangzeb stopped it. Nur Jahan, Jahangir's wife, was also known to have sat for the Jharokha Darshan and conducted administrative duty with the common people and hearing their pleas. Jahangir was fully dedicated to the practice and <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> to conduct the Jharokha Darshan even if he was sick; he had said [...] "even in the time of weakness I have gone every day to the jharokha, though in great pain and sorrow, according to my fixed custom." ...|$|E

50|$|The {{southern}} ground hornbill’s {{loud voice}} and large size have <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> focal <b>point</b> in many traditional African cultures. Historically, there were strong taboos against killing of ground hornbills; however {{these have been}} weakened with the modernisation of Africa. For southern African cultures, the ground hornbill {{was a symbol of}} the arrival of the rainy season and this may have been a factor in above-mentioned hunting taboos.|$|R
5000|$|The UN itself {{never had}} the chance to declare that Iraq had failed to take its [...] "final opportunity" [...] to comply as the U.S. {{invasion}} <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> moot <b>point.</b> American President George W. Bush stated that Saddam Hussein had 48 hours to step down and leave Iraq. As the deadline approached, the United States announced that forces would be sent to verify his disarmament and a transition to a new government.|$|R
