5000|$|One {{geological}} symptom {{resulting from}} human activity is increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) content. During the glacial-interglacial cycles {{of the past}} million years, natural processes have varied CO2 by approximately 100 ppm (from 180 ppm to 280 ppm). , anthropogenic net emissions of CO2 increased atmospheric concentration by a comparable amount from 280 ppm (Holocene or pre-industrial [...] "equilibrium") to approximately 400 ppm, with 2015 - 16 <b>monthly</b> <b>monitoring</b> data of CO2 displaying a rising trend above 400 ppm. This signal in the Earth's climate system is especially significant because it is occurring much faster, and to a greater extent, than previous, similar changes.

5|$|Because of its remote {{location}} and relative inaccessibility, climate records are poor. The nearest weather station, Potato Hill, {{has only been}} measuring precipitation since 1982 and temperatures since 1989. Temperature and precipitation records from Glenwood and Trout Lake, both considerably lower in elevation and farther from the mountain, are more complete and go back further, 1948 at Glenwood and 1924 at Trout Lake. Snowfall records from the three snow stations on Adams cover {{a number of years}} but are discontinuous and are limited to the northwest side. The Potato Hill station was <b>monitored</b> <b>monthly</b> from 1950-1976 and was replaced in 1982 with the automated precipitation sensor.

40|$|Several {{studies have}} {{explored}} {{the role of}} conifer oleoresins in the defense against herbivores and fungal attacks. However, biotic and abiotic injuries on stem and crown also promote resin fall and its accumulation in the forest floor. No study has explored oleoresins accumulation in the litter and soil layers under the crown: the modification of soil properties after fire is unknown. To quantify the magnitude of resin fall in a Mediterranean uneven-aged forest of Aleppo pine (Pinus halepensis Mill.) the amount and pattern of resin dripping was <b>monthly</b> <b>monitored</b> under large, medium and small crowns. During summer (June-September) occurred 58 % to 80 % of resin fall. Resin amount decreased significantly from the stem towards the crown border; half of the resin was collected along the West direction, which is the dominant wind direction in the study area.

40|$|In a 5 -period study (2007 - 2011) we {{examined}} the effects of human trampling on the last remaining population of Anchusa littorea on the sandy coastal habitat. This species, considered extinct in the wild for several years, was casually rediscovered in a small population at Is Arenas (SW Sardinia). We <b>monthly</b> <b>monitored</b> six trampled and six untrampled permanent plots, mapping individuals and recording their size and reproductive variables. Trampled and untrampled plots showed significant differences with respect to plant density, plant size and reproductive performance (flowers and fruits production). This study demonstrated that human trampling represents a severe threat to the conservation of A. littorea and urgent measures should be planned to protect the unique remnant population in the dune system of Is Arenas. Tourist flow should be redirected and confined to others areas in order to promote the natural expansion of A. littorea in its original habitat. A possible integrated strategy for the conservation and management of the species consists of combining in situ and ex situ measures...|$|R
40|$|Vegetation cover {{plays an}} {{important}} role on overland flow generation and erosion, directly impacting infiltration and soil water storage. The objective {{of this study was to}} investigate hydrological processes and soil moisture dynamics through conceptual modelling in intensively monitored experimental plots under natural rainfall with different soil cover conditions, in the Brazilian semiarid. Soil moisture was <b>monthly</b> <b>monitored</b> using a CPN 503 DR Neutron Probe device. Calibration curves previously defined were adopted for moisture assessment. Four experimental soil cover treatment were established: Cactus “Palma” barriers (PB); mulching (MC); Bare soil (BS) and natural vegetation cover (NC). Nash-Sutcliffe (ENS) coefficient and PBIAS index were adopted to assess hydrological processes analysis. The SMAP model successfully predicted the flow and humidity of the experimental plots for the natural cover and Mulching coverage, with a global ENS index of over 0. 877. Scenarios of changes in soil cover have dramatically affected the modeling of water resources in the plots.
