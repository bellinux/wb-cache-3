In 1968, he announced that Neiman-Marcus's buyers would give preference to companies employing and training significant numbers of minority employees, making his firm one of the first companies in the nation to have such a policy.|$|E
5|$|In her interview, Swedish Detective Superintendent Kajsa Wahlberg {{describes}} purchasing sex from {{a prostitute}} as paying to masturbate into someone. The leader {{of an organization}} working to rescue girls from prostitution in Cambodia {{says that it is}} not the poorest parents who sell their children into sexual slavery but rather the parents who are looking to buy luxury goods. He therefore argues that sex trafficking is a spiritual and <b>moral</b> <b>issue</b> that cannot be solved by education or money. In another interview, a man purchasing sex in Thailand says that he believes the girls are happy to be working as prostitutes. Another interview features an American man who had been a sex tourist in Asia.|$|E

40|$|The {{empirical}} {{and theoretical}} consideration of ethical decision making {{has focused on}} the process of moral judgment; however, a precondition to judgment is moral sensitivity, the ability to detect and evaluate <b>moral</b> <b>issues</b> [Rest, J. R. (1984). The major components of morality. In W. Kurtines 2 ̆ 6 J. Gewirtz (Eds.), Morality, moral behaviour, and moral development (pp. 24 – 38). New York, NY: Wiley]. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and contextually standardized, real life <b>moral</b> <b>issues,</b> we demonstrate that sensitivity to <b>moral</b> <b>issues</b> is associated with activation of the polar medial prefrontal cortex, dorsal posterior cingulate cortex, and posterior superior temporal sulcus (STS). These activations suggest that moral sensitivity is related to access to knowledge unique to one 2 ̆ 7 s self, supported by autobiographical memory retrieval and social perspective taking. We also assessed whether sensitivity to rule-based or “justice” <b>moral</b> <b>issues</b> versus social situational or “care” <b>moral</b> <b>issues</b> is associated with dissociable neural processing events. Sensitivity to justice issues was associated with greater activation of the left intraparietal sulcus, whereas sensitivity to care issues was associated with greater activation of the ventral posterior cingulate cortex, ventromedial and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and thalamus. These results suggest a role for access to self histories and identities and social perspectives in sensitivity to <b>moral</b> <b>issues,</b> provide neural representations of the subcomponent process of moral sensitivity originally proposed by Rest, and support differing neural information processing for the interpretive recognition of justice and care <b>moral</b> <b>issues...</b>|$|R

25|$|Pregnancy from rape is {{an ethical}} and <b>moral</b> <b>issue</b> {{in the context}} of {{opposition}} to legal abortion. In recent decades, claims of the improbability of rape-induced pregnancy, reminiscent of historical beliefs, have again begun {{to play a role in}} political discourse surrounding abortion regulation in cases of rape, particularly in the United States.|$|E
25|$|For many people, {{abortion}} {{is essentially a}} <b>moral</b> <b>issue,</b> concerning the commencement of human personhood, {{the rights of the}} fetus, and a woman's rights over her own body. The debate has become a political and legal issue in some countries with anti-abortion campaigners seeking to enact, maintain and expand anti-abortion laws, while abortion rights campaigners seeking the repeal or easing of such laws while expanding access to abortion. Abortion laws vary considerably between jurisdictions, ranging from outright prohibition of the procedure to public funding of abortion. Availability of safe abortion also varies across the world.|$|E

25|$|In the debates, Douglas reiterated {{his support}} of popular sovereignty. He demanded to know whether Lincoln would ever vote to admit a new slave state, even if the {{majority}} of settlers favored slavery. He denounced Lincoln for his insistence that slavery was a <b>moral</b> <b>issue</b> {{that had to be}} resolved by the nation as a whole. Douglas described this as causing an unnecessary conflict between free and slave states, which threatened to boil up into disunion and war. He also asserted that Lincoln supported civil and social equality between the races, and insinuated that Lincoln even accepted interracial marriage.|$|E
25|$|Slavery in the 19th century {{became the}} most {{critical}} <b>moral</b> <b>issue</b> dividing Baptists in the United States. Struggling to gain {{a foothold in the}} South, after the American Revolution, the next generation of southern Baptist preachers accommodated themselves to the leadership of southern society. Rather than challenging the gentry on slavery and urging manumission (as did the Quakers and Methodists), they began to interpret the Bible as supporting the practice of slavery and encouraged good paternalistic practices by slaveholders. They preached to slaves to accept their places and obey their masters. In the two decades after the Revolution during the Second Great Awakening, Baptist preachers abandoned their pleas that slaves be manumitted.|$|E
25|$|In England and Wales, {{which had}} been {{politically}} united following the Norman invasion of Wales in the Late Medieval period, cunning folk had operated throughout {{the latter part of}} the Medieval and into the Early Modern period. In the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, there had been no attempt to illegalise the cunning craft, although private law suits had been brought against some of them by those clients who felt that they had been cheated out of their money. This changed with the Witchcraft Act of 1542, enacted under the reign of Henry VIII, which targeted both witches and cunning folk, and which prescribed the death penalty for such crimes as using invocations and conjurations to locate treasure or to cast a love spell. This law was repealed no later than 1547, under the reign of Henry's son Edward VI, something that the historian Owen Davies believed was due to those in power changing their opinion on the law: they believed that either the death penalty was too harsh for such crimes or that the practice of the cunning craft was a <b>moral</b> <b>issue</b> that was better for the Church to deal with in ecclesiastic courts rather than a problem that had to be sorted out by the state.|$|E

The commission received thousands of letters both supporting Bryant's stance and condemning the commission; {{at one point the}} U.S. Postal Service installed bomb detection equipment for the mail collected for delivery to the Florida Citrus Commission. The publicity director for the Florida Department of Citrus told a reporter from the Associated Press, [...] "The whole Anita thing is a mess. No matter what we decide, we're only going to lose.

500|$|The {{nation and}} the {{constitution}} survived {{the rising tide of}} financial and political corruption during President Grant's two terms in office from 1869 to 1877. With slavery no longer the clear <b>moral</b> <b>issue</b> for the American people, and absent the dynamic leadership of Abraham Lincoln taken by an assassin's bullet, the nation for a while floundered in the seas of financial and political indulgence. The high-water mark of the flood of corruption that swept the nation took place in 1874, after Benjamin Bristow was put in charge to reform the Treasury. [...] In 1873, Grant's friend and publisher, Mark Twain, along with coauthor Charles Dudley Warner, called this American era of speculation and corruption the Gilded Age. Between 1870 and 1900, the United States population nearly doubled in size, gainful employment increased by 132 percent, and non farm labor constituted 60 percent of the work force.|$|E
500|$|Things soon degraded, a legal {{hearing was}} held, and Sullivan {{supported}} Carte by making an affidavit erroneously stating {{that there were}} minor legal expenses outstanding from a battle Gilbert had with Lillian Russell. On 5 May 1890, Gilbert had written to Sullivan: [...] "The time for {{putting an end to}} our collaboration has at last arrived." [...] Gilbert later asked Sullivan to say he had been mistaken in his affidavit, but Sullivan refused. Gilbert felt it was a <b>moral</b> <b>issue,</b> and could not look past it. Sullivan felt that Gilbert was questioning his good faith, and in any event, Sullivan had other reasons to stay in Carte's good graces: Carte was building a new theatre, the Royal English Opera House, to produce Sullivan's only grand opera, Ivanhoe. Gilbert brought suit, and after The Gondoliers closed in 1891, he withdrew the performance rights to his libretti, vowing to write no more operas for the Savoy.|$|E

40|$|Modelers, {{especially}} in operational research, {{are becoming increasingly}} aware that their role in decision-making raises moral problems. This paper discusses two questions: How do <b>moral</b> <b>issues</b> in modeling arise? How can these <b>moral</b> <b>issues</b> be addressed? I propose a framework that (1) provides tools for discovering <b>moral</b> <b>issues</b> raised by models, and (2) provides practical guidance for solving moral problems in modeling. As regards (1), I discuss three moral perspectives on modeling: a perspective {{that focuses on the}} beneficial or harmful consequences of using a model; a perspective that focuses on the intentions of using a model; and a perspective that focuses on whether a model promotes virtuous behavior. In order to achieve practical action guidance, (2), four moral mid-level principles are introduced: (i) The principle of transparency expresses the obligations to explain the structure, assumptions and further properties of the model; (ii) the principle of integrity demands for the application of professional standards; (iii) the principle of comprehensiveness stresses that all moral concerns should be acknowledged thoroughly; and finally, (iv) the principle of efficacy states that models should evaluate <b>moral</b> <b>issues</b> explicitly...|$|R
