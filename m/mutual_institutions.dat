50|$|Institutions {{known as}} mutual {{societies}} {{grew out of}} the friendly society movement of the 18th century, with the first mutual insurer, Equitable Life, being founded in 1762. Formalised under the Friendly Societies Act 1819, <b>mutual</b> <b>institutions</b> predated the welfare state and were formed {{to meet the needs of}} a growing urban working class. This communitarian self-help movement allowed small regular individual contributions to be pooled for mutual collective benefit, obtaining the same economies of scope and scale necessary for providing insurance and financial products. Mutual societies helped to raise funds for housing and consumer durables at a time when commercial banks were still exclusively commercial lenders. Building societies were formed as small temporary societies by worker co-operatives, pooling resources to build local houses and subsequently allocating them among members by drawing lots. Once all members were housed, these organisations were typically wound up, although some became permanent societies in an effort to promote wider home ownership, as exemplified by the Leeds Permanent Building Society.|$|E

Among several factors under consideration by prospective members is {{an evaluation of the}} perceived risk involved with membership based on unlimited liability. Using a trust index we can show that most <b>mutual</b> <b>institutions</b> are not attractive in the sense that prospective members must trust a disproportionately high share of members to find joining a mutual institution attractive. In the medium term, this leads to a non sustainable financial system. We also draw conclusions about the sources of thi...|$|E
40|$|Deregulation {{during the}} 1980 s allowed {{savings and loan}} {{associations}} to undertake {{many of the same}} activities as mutual savings banks, so that competition among thrifts increased, and they became more homogeneous in nature. At the same time, according to agency theory, <b>mutual</b> <b>institutions</b> should experience less efficient operations than stock institutions due to differences in monitoring and compensation of management. The purpose of this study, then, is two fold: first, to determine whether mutual savings banks exhibit the same cost behaviour as savings and loans; and second, to determine whether <b>mutual</b> <b>institutions</b> are less cost efficient than stock institutions. To compare cost structures and cost efficiencies, a three input, three output, translog cost frontier is estimated for mutual savings banks, mutual S&Ls, and stock S&Ls. Approximately 1500 observations, restricted to the states in which mutual savings banks are chartered, are extracted from the 1990 OTS data {{to be used in the}} estimation. Each type of institution is found to have a unique cost function. The data are then used in a second regression to determine which characteristics are correlated with the inefficiency scores. It appears that mutual savings banks do have a different cost structure than savings and loans. As well, the comparison of stock versus mutual savings and loans reveals that mutuals exhibit cost efficiency, a result that contradicts agency theory. ...|$|E

40|$|This study {{advances}} an entry/exit {{model to}} analyse the scale efficiency of UK building societies. We {{find that there}} are considerable divergences across building societies in levels of scale efficiency and also in technological change during the sample period 1992 - 1997. The paper also finds that scale economies and technological change estimates are dependent on whether the econometrician balances a panel data set or utilises the entry/exit model based on Dionne et al's (1998) specification. In general, scale economies in UK building societies {{are found to be}} more significant and more pervasive than in previous studies.

40|$|The {{annexation}} of Savoy by France fuels {{the issue of}} the fate of Banque de Savoie, because Banque de France was reluctant to share its monopoly as bank of issue, which explains the absorption of its rival in 1865. A second issue was the creation of local banking tools, embedded in regional business communities, as leverage to industrial clusters {{at the heart of the}} alpine productive system. Two big family banks and four <b>mutual</b> <b>institutions</b> reflected this Savoyard will to resist the grip of banks from Paris, Lyon, and Geneva. A third issue became the “type” of business model of Savoy banks, between a classical discount model, a type of enterprise banking committed to industrial finance in favour of customer companies, and, last, “regional banking”, quite mixed banking. Each period of the Savoy economic growth privileged this variety of models, before a convergence towards a more balance model of commercial banking took shape after WWII.

40|$|This study {{examines}} the relative efficiency of 210 mutual {{savings and loan}} associations (S 2 ̆ 6 L 2 ̆ 7 s) and 165 stock S 2 ̆ 6 L 2 ̆ 7 s located in five states during the 1974 - 83 time period. Since all mutual and most stock S 2 ̆ 6 L 2 ̆ 7 s lack publicly traded stock, data for market return and market risk estimates are unavailable. Hence, this study employs accounting based measures of risk and return. Annual residual returns are calculated for both stock and mutual S 2 ̆ 6 L 2 ̆ 7 s. The residual return {{is the difference between}} expected accounting returns adjusted for systematic or total risk and actual accounting returns. Mean difference t-tests are employed to test the research hypothesis of equal efficiency as measured by the average residuals between stock and mutual S 2 ̆ 6 L 2 ̆ 7 s. The results indicate no significant difference in average residuals between stock and mutual S 2 ̆ 6 L 2 ̆ 7 s. The null hypothesis of equal efficiency cannot be rejected. Hence, based upon accounting measures of risk and return both stock and <b>mutual</b> <b>institutions</b> earn returns consistent with their levels of risk. ...|$|E
40|$|The thrift {{industry}} has been studied extensively in recent years due to the enormous costs to resolve failed thrifts during the late 1980 s and early 1990 s. Almost all of the {{studies have focused on}} the causes of these failures. Yet an important but relatively neglected development that merits further study is the conversion of <b>mutual</b> <b>institutions</b> to the stock form of ownership. Such conversions raise questions regarding the appropriate price for the shares in initial offerings, particularly in view of reports that windfall profits have been realized by the initial investors in numerous cases and who should receive the shares. The {{purpose of this article is}} to examine mutual thrifts that converted to stock ownership form during 1992 and 1993 to determine whether excess returns were indeed realized and, if so, to identify the determinants of those excess returns. The empirical results indicate the initial investors do indeed benefit from significantly positive abnormal returns during the first few days of trading after conversion. Additional empirical results indicate that both the pro-forma price-to-book ratio and the dollar amount of shares management intends to purchase are significant factors in explaining the variation in the abnormal returns.

An analysis and discussion of the theories of organizational development and change is undertaken to explore the mutual building societies 2 ̆ 7 motivation for change. The financial performance measures, provided by financial ratios of the major mutual building societies in Australia, are examined to assess the behaviour of building societies under different governance structures in the 1980 s and 1990 s. The theoretical and empirical literature has suggested that <b>mutual</b> deposit-taking <b>institutions</b> should have lov^^er profitability and higher operating expenses than their publicly listed counterparts. Accounting ratios are observed over time to investigate if governance change in mutual deposit-taking organizations accounted for any discernable differences in profitability and cost efficiency pre- and post- demutualization.
