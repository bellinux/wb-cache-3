5|$|In 1935, Franck {{moved to}} the United States, where he had {{accepted}} a professorship at Johns Hopkins University. The laboratory there was poorly equipped compared {{to the one in}} Göttingen, but he received $10,000 for equipment from the Rockefeller Foundation. A more intractable problem was that the university had no <b>money</b> <b>to</b> hire skilled staff. Franck was concerned about his family members remaining in Germany, and needed <b>money</b> <b>to</b> help them emigrate. He therefore accepted an offer from the University of Chicago, where his work on photosynthesis had attracted interest, in 1938.|$|E
5|$|In 1987, after Laliberté re-privatized Cirque du Soleil, it {{was invited}} to perform at the Los Angeles Arts Festival.

5|$|In October 1899, Rhodes, aged 22, married Sarah Elizabeth Stancliffe, {{who lived}} in Kirkheaton and was two years his senior. They lived in a farmhouse, shared with other people, at Bog Hall near Kirkheaton. On 25 August 1902 his wife {{gave birth to a}} daughter, their only child. Rhodes found Yorkshire's {{dealings}} with <b>money</b> <b>to</b> be ungenerous; following his benefit in 1911 Yorkshire, as was their custom, paid only one-third of the <b>money</b> <b>to</b> Rhodes and kept back the rest to invest on his behalf, only paying out the interest. Rhodes considered this to be unfair; however, he was able to use the <b>money</b> <b>to</b> build a stone house at Marsh, Huddersfield, which his family moved into in the autumn of 1912. He lived there until 1956.|$|E

The Desjardins Group, which was Cirque du Soleil's financial institution at the time, covered about $200,000 of bad checks. Also, a financier named Daniel Lamarre, who worked {{for one of the}} largest public relations firms in Quebec, represented the company for free, knowing that they didn't have the <b>money</b> <b>to</b> pay his fee.
