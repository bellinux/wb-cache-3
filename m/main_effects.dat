5|$|Prometheus {{contains}} approximately 1,300 {{digital effect}} shots. The <b>main</b> <b>effects</b> studio was Moving Picture Company (MPC), which produced 420 of the shots. Several other studios, including Weta Digital, Fuel VFX, Rising Sun Pictures, Luma Pictures, Lola Visual Effects, and Hammerhead Productions, also produced effects shots for the film.|$|E
5|$|On September15, {{the eye of}} Choi-wan passed within 10km (5mi) of Alamagan {{and brought}} winds of up to 230km/h (145mph) to the island. The most recent storm of Choi-wan's {{intensity}} to strike the islands was Typhoon Chaba in 2004. That storm caused severe damage and widespread flooding. Unlike Chaba, relatively little rainfall fell due to Choi-wan, and no flooding was reported. The <b>main</b> <b>effects</b> from the typhoon in Saipan were downed trees which littered streets across the islands. Power lines were downed and sewer pipes were broken; however, crews began repairing damage once Choi-wan passed. In Garapan, the major shelter on the island sustained minor damage and repair work on it would take roughly a week.|$|E
5|$|The <b>main</b> <b>effects</b> of {{tropical}} cyclones include heavy rain, strong wind, large storm surges at landfall, and tornadoes. The destruction from a tropical cyclone depends mainly on its intensity, its size, and its location. Tropical cyclones act to remove forest canopy {{as well as}} change the landscape near coastal areas, by moving and reshaping sand dunes and causing extensive erosion along the coast. Even well inland, heavy rainfall can lead to mudslides and landslides in mountainous areas. Their effects can be sensed over time by studying the concentration of the Oxygen-18 isotope within caves within the vicinity of cyclones' paths being very hazardous to people's life.|$|E
30|$|The pO 2 {{decreased}} significantly {{during exercise}} and after {{exercise in the}} H trial (<b>main</b> <b>effect</b> for time, P[*]=[*] 0.002), whereas no changes were observed in the N trial. Consequently, the pO 2 remained significantly lower in the H trial during exercise and after exercise (interaction, P[*]=[*] 0.018; <b>main</b> <b>effect</b> for trial, P[*]<[*] 0.0001). The pCO 2 decreased significantly during exercise and after exercise in both trials (<b>main</b> <b>effect</b> for time, P[*]=[*] 0.002). Exercise-induced reductions in pCO 2 were significantly greater in the N trial during the post-exercise period (interaction, P[*]=[*] 0.861; <b>main</b> <b>effect</b> for trial, P[*]=[*] 0.002).|$|R
30|$|There was a {{significant}} memory <b>main</b> <b>effect,</b> F(1, 91)[*]=[*] 11.72, p[*]=[*]. 001, ƞp 2 [*]=[*]. 114; participants felt the negative memory to be fairer than the trauma memory. There was also a culture <b>main</b> <b>effect,</b> F(1, 91)[*]=[*] 8.11, p[*]<[*]. 01, ƞp 2 [*]=[*]. 08; Asian participants perceived the memories to be fairer than the British group.

30|$|The factor Proc had {{the largest}} <b>main</b> <b>effect</b> of - 1.63. Changing Proc from 4 to 16 islands dropped the mean speedup by 1.63. Factor Pop had the second largest <b>main</b> <b>effect</b> of 1.06. If the {{population}} size increased from 1, 600 to 3, 200, the speedup increased by 1.06. The <b>main</b> <b>effect</b> of Nindv was 0.6. The speedup increased {{when the number of}} migrants changed from one to five.|$|R
5|$|Erosion can be {{the result}} of {{material}} movement by the wind. There are two <b>main</b> <b>effects.</b> First, wind causes small particles to be lifted and therefore moved to another region. This is called deflation. Second, these suspended particles may impact on solid objects causing erosion by abrasion (ecological succession). Wind erosion generally occurs in areas with little or no vegetation, often in areas where there is insufficient rainfall to support vegetation. An example is the formation of sand dunes, on a beach or in a desert. Loess is a homogeneous, typically nonstratified, porous, friable, slightly coherent, often calcareous, fine-grained, silty, pale yellow or buff, windblown (Aeolian) sediment. It generally occurs as a widespread blanket deposit that covers areas of hundreds of square kilometers and tens of meters thick. Loess often stands in either steep or vertical faces. Loess tends to develop into highly rich soils. Under appropriate climatic conditions, areas with loess are among the most agriculturally productive in the world. Loess deposits are geologically unstable by nature, and will erode very readily. Therefore, windbreaks (such as big trees and bushes) are often planted by farmers to reduce the wind erosion of loess.|$|E
5|$|The Expendables 2 {{contains}} approximately 1,547 {{digital effect}} shots. The <b>main</b> <b>effects</b> studio was Worldwide FX (WWFX), which produced 1,186 of the shots, and a further 800 shots which were discarded {{in response to}} changes to the film's story. Several other studios, including El Ranchito, Malditochrome, Tata Elxsi, Reliance Mediaworks, and , also produced effects shots for the film through WWFX. Digital effect pre-production began in July 2011 and was completed one year later. WWFX's primary facility is situated in Sofia, allowing them to have constant access to the production, and model assets of the sets before their practical versions were built; this enabled WWFX to raise issues relating to the designs early and develop an optimised construction plan. Anything that was considered to potentially need a computer generated double was photographed and digitally modeled {{even if it was}} not scheduled to appear in the film, which later served useful as the film's story was adjusted, requiring WWFX to rebuild entire scenes.|$|E
25|$|When {{interactions}} between factors are not negligible, {{they are often}} confounded in Plackett–Burman designs with the <b>main</b> <b>effects,</b> meaning that the designs do not permit one to distinguish between certain <b>main</b> <b>effects</b> and certain interactions. This is called aliasing or confounding.|$|E
30|$|There was no {{significant}} interaction <b>effect</b> or <b>main</b> <b>effect</b> of instruction; however, the <b>main</b> <b>effect</b> of height was significant (Table  1). Ankle flexion moment was larger for the high drop height than for the low (Table  2).|$|R
30|$|Of {{critical}} {{interest to}} this study was {{whether there was a}} <b>main</b> <b>effect</b> of GFMT face-recognition performance category. A <b>main</b> <b>effect</b> of face-recognition ability would indicate that task performance, irrespective of task type, is related to GFMT screening-task performance. More specifically, a <b>main</b> <b>effect</b> of face-recognition ability, where there is a linear increase in accuracy from low to medium to high, would support the conclusion that the GFMT predicts performance on the other tasks. A <b>main</b> <b>effect</b> with no interaction would be the result most consistent {{with the use of the}} GFMT as a screening test. In short, the pattern of results would show a step-wise increase in each test with GFMT performance category.|$|R
30|$|There was a {{significant}} memory <b>main</b> <b>effect,</b> F(1, 73)[*]=[*] 14.82, p[*]<[*]. 001, ƞp 2 [*]=[*]. 17; participants rated that the pleasant memory was significantly more predictable, certain and understandable than the trauma memory. The culture <b>main</b> <b>effect</b> and interaction were not significant.|$|R
25|$|Shaking {{and ground}} rupture are the <b>main</b> <b>effects</b> created by earthquakes, principally {{resulting}} in {{more or less}} severe damage to buildings and other rigid structures. The severity of the local effects depends on the complex combination of the earthquake magnitude, {{the distance from the}} epicenter, and the local geological and geomorphological conditions, which may amplify or reduce wave propagation. The ground-shaking is measured by ground acceleration.|$|E
25|$|In {{his book}} Food of the Gods, McKenna {{proposed}} that the transformation from humans' early ancestors Homo erectus to the species Homo sapiens mainly {{had to do with}} the addition of the mushroom Psilocybe cubensis in its diet, an event that according to his theory took place in about 100,000 BCE (which is when he believed that the species diverged from the Homo genus). McKenna based his theory on the <b>main</b> <b>effects,</b> or alleged effects, produced by the mushroom while citing studies by Roland Fischer et al. from the late 1960s to early 1970s.|$|E
25|$|Buspirone {{acts as an}} agonist of the {{serotonin}} 5-HT1A receptor {{with high}} affinity. It is a preferential full agonist of presynaptic 5-HT1A receptors, which are inhibitory autoreceptors, and a partial agonist of postsynaptic 5-HT1A receptors. In accordance, an animal study found that buspirone dose-dependently decreases serotonin levels in specific brain areas while increasing dopamine and norepinephrine levels. It is thought that the <b>main</b> <b>effects</b> of buspirone are mediated via its interaction with the 5-HT1A receptor. Some of its effects may be mediated via oxytocin release secondary to 5-HT1A receptor agonism. Buspirone also has lower affinity for the serotonin 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B, 5-HT2C, 5-HT6, and 5-HT7 receptors.|$|E
30|$|There was a {{significant}} memory <b>main</b> <b>effect,</b> F(1, 73)[*]=[*] 24.56, p[*]<[*]. 001, ƞp 2 [*]=[*]. 25; participants {{reported that they had}} significantly greater perceived control in the pleasant memory than the trauma memory. The culture <b>main</b> <b>effect</b> and interaction were not significant.|$|R
30|$|There was no {{significant}} interaction <b>effect</b> or <b>main</b> <b>effect</b> of height; however, the <b>main</b> <b>effect</b> of instruction was significant (Table  1). Hip extension moment was smaller for the soft condition than for the natural and stiff, which were not {{different from each other}} (Table  2).|$|R
30|$|Condition had a {{significant}} <b>main</b> <b>effect</b> on SWRR, such that partial automation led to approximately eight more reversals per minute than did the baseline condition (χ 2  =  88.50 and B =  7.87). Condition and situation had no interaction effect, and order had no <b>main</b> <b>effect</b> on SWRR.|$|R
25|$|A coroner's inquest {{into the}} death, {{conducted}} by coroner Thomas Erskine Cleland, commenced {{a few days}} after the body was found but was adjourned until 17 June 1949. The investigating pathologist John Burton Cleland re-examined the body and made a number of discoveries. Cleland noted that the man's shoes were remarkably clean and appeared to have been recently polished, rather than being in the state expected of the shoes of a man who had apparently been wandering around Glenelg all day. He added that this evidence fitted in with the theory that the body might have been brought to Somerton beach after the man's death, accounting for the lack of evidence of vomiting and convulsions, which are the two <b>main</b> <b>effects</b> of poison.|$|E
25|$|The {{rhetoric of}} the nudism and anti-nudism {{movements}} emphasizes freedom {{from many of the}} normal constraints which regulate human interaction in nudist settings, although for different reasons. Using data from French and German beaches, this hypothesis was tested using five different indicators. Little significant variation between nudists and non-nudists within French and German settings is found in their patterns of interactional spacing, while more significant <b>main</b> <b>effects</b> for differences of cultures are found regardless of nudity status. As a subculture, nudists would appear to differ from nonnudists only in their propensity to like to sunbathe in the nude. Their nude status would appear to have none of the de-inhibiting effects often attributed to nudism. By contrast, clear cultural differences between German and French cultures are shown consistent with Hall's high-low context distinction and the Francoeur's hot-cool sexuality continuum.|$|E
25|$|Sulfate aerosol has two <b>main</b> <b>effects,</b> {{direct and}} indirect. The direct effect, via albedo, is a cooling effect that slows the overall rate of global warming: the IPCC's best {{estimate}} of the radiative forcing is −0.4 watts per square meter {{with a range of}} −0.2 to −0.8 W/m² but there are substantial uncertainties. The effect varies strongly geographically, with most cooling believed to be at and downwind of major industrial centres. Modern climate models addressing the attribution of recent climate change take into account sulfate forcing, which appears to account (at least partly) for the slight drop in global temperature {{in the middle of the}} 20th century. The indirect effect (via the aerosol acting as cloud condensation nuclei, CCN, and thereby modifying the cloud properties -albedo and lifetime-) is more uncertain but is believed to be a cooling.|$|E

500|$|During the writers' strike, {{producer}} Ralph Winter confronted what writer Paul Mandell termed an [...] "unenviable" [...] effects situation. Industrial Light & Magic {{had provided}} the effects {{for the three}} [...] previous Star Trek films, and Winter wanted them to work on The Final Frontier. However, all of the effects house's best technicians were busy working on Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade and Ghostbusters II. With a stretched budget and short timeframe, Winter had to look elsewhere. To save time and money, he planned to create as many effects as he could either on stage, or through camera trickery. The producers solicited test footage from various effects houses to judge which was best able to create the film's <b>main</b> <b>effects,</b> including the planet Sha Ka Ree and the godlike being which resided there. Bran Ferren's effects company Associates and Ferren was picked. Ferren had worked on films such as Altered States and Little Shop of Horrors; hiring the New York-based studio made The Final Frontier the first film in the Star Trek series produced on both {{the east and west}} coasts of the United States.|$|E
