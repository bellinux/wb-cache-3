500|$|The mixtape samples {{songs from}} Radiohead, Coldplay, MGMT, Mr. Hudson and The Eagles, which Ocean sings over. Ocean, when {{uploading}} the album to iTunes, labeled it as bluegrass and death metal, out of arbitrariness. When asked {{about why he}} uploaded the songs in that way, he replied; [...] "I don't want to seem like I have a cause against genres, or <b>maybe</b> <b>I</b> <b>do...</b> Bluegrass is swag. Bluegrass is all the way swag." [...] Ocean described the making of his mixtape as a labor of love, stating that [...] "It was like difficult to make. Not like writing the songs [...] arranging the songs. That had a level of difficulty, too. But just piecing together all the levels {{to do it at}} the level, the quality of records I wanted to make… But, it was a process I appreciate so much." ...|$|E

5000|$|On June 29, 1926, an El Paso Herald {{reporter}} asked Emil Lewis Holmdahl, an American infantryman turned soldier of fortune, {{if he had}} been involved in the alleged kidnapping of famous California evangelist Aimee Semple McPherson. Holmdahl, who fought extensively in earlier Latin American turmoil wars and was cleared by a Mexican judge as a suspect in the February 6, 1926 theft of Pancho Villa's head, enigmatically replied regarding McPherson, [...] "Well, <b>maybe</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> and <b>maybe</b> <b>I</b> didn't."

5000|$|Regarding {{the writing}} process for her lyrics, Holter noted, [...] "I {{basically}} just write stream of consciousness to a certain extent, I let the song kind of go where it wants to go. I don't think that's a new idea, at all, but I think that <b>maybe</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> it to an extreme." [...] Both [...] "Sea Calls Me Home" [...] and [...] "Betsy on the Roof" [...] were written years prior to recording and often performed during Holter's live performances. [...] "Lucette Stranded on the Island" [...] was influenced by Colette's novella, Chance Acquaintances, while novelist Christopher Isherwood's recurring fictional character, Sally Bowles, was an influence in writing [...] "How Long?".|$|E
500|$|The {{head coach}} dealt with young players who {{differed}} from the white, East-Coast students {{with whom he had}} previously worked. At the beginning, he used the then-customary coaching methods of rough language and a strict routine. The Native American students were unaccustomed to such an approach, and several key players stopped attending practices. Warner adjusted his technique, saying that he [...] "found I could get better results. I don't think I ever swore at a player from that time. <b>Maybe</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> a little cussing, now and then, but never at players." ...|$|R

That was the climax of my career, for sure. Living and playing in London was something that I will never forget.

5000|$|Following {{the death}} of his wife Annie, he closed La Tante Claire in 2003. The space became the {{flagship}} restaurant of Marcus Wareing. After taking a break from restaurants, he was briefly head chef at the Bleeding Heart pub in Clerkenwell. In 2009, he opened a pop-up restaurant at Selfridges in London for ten days as part of the London food festival. Koffmann decided to serve classic dishes from La Tante Claire instead of new dishes as he originally planned - [...] "... that's not what people want. They want the pig's trotter, the foie gras, the pistachio soufflé. But <b>maybe</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> a new dish each day, as a special." [...] The ten days turned into two months. Koffmann described the first month as [...] "a kind of hell", but got used to the hours again during the second month, and began to ponder about opening a new restaurant; [...] "I started to think about a new restaurant. I thought: why not? I still enjoy it. When you are a chef, your place is in the kitchen.".|$|E

[...] The remaining lyrics explain in a general way the premise of the film: a mystery tour of the type that was popular in Britain when the Beatles were young. Lennon and McCartney expanded the tour to make it magical, which allowed it to be [...] "a little more surreal than the real ones." ...|$|R

[...] She confesses about the room she stayed in during her treatment, [...] "I got so completely vulnerable and so raw, when I even step into this room I feel naked." [...] Showing her wrist tattoos, she reveals how meaningful they are to her and she didn't get them just to cover up the scars she had, but also because her fans kept encouraging her to stay strong while in rehab.|$|E
5000|$|Myers {{asks how}} DeLillo's theme of [...] "Life in Consumerland" [...] {{can still be}} {{considered}} edgy {{after it has been}} explored in literature for fifty years. He points out that much of DeLillo's writing consists of long [...] "shopping lists" [...] of brand name consumer items. Myers also criticizes DeLillo's development of characters who [...] "routinely talk and act like visitors from another planet." [...] Myers asserts that DeLillo's characters serve primarily as vessels for DeLillo's thoughts, rather than as discrete characters. DeLillo, according to Myers, attempts to persuade his readers that if something does not make sense it is [...] "over their heads," [...] or that [...] "something as inadequate as language can never do justice to the complexity of what they're trying to say." [...] But Myers also points out that DeLillo uses a slippery sense of irony in his writing: [...] "As so often with DeLillo's musings, the 'conclusion' is phrased as a rhetorical question. 'If this works for you, take it,' he is saying, 'but if you think it's silly, hey - <b>maybe</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> too.'" ...|$|E

Currently completing her PhD in international economics at Strasbourg university in France, Gisèle is also the executive secretary of ASAFE, the Support Association for Women Entrepreneurs, with 4, 000 members in Cameroon and beyond. For her the new millennium is that of telecommunications, and so it is essential that women fully learn how to manipulate ICTs. In November 1999, she headed the ASAFE delegation to the First Cyberforum for Women Entrepreneurs from Africa and the Diaspora, held in Douala, Cameroon, which brought together more than 100 women {{from all over the world}} for six days to exchange their knowledge and experiences. 'Power', Gisèle asserts, 'is not a personal issue. <b>Maybe</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> have an aura because I have a certain level of education but it is only together that we have the power to change things, so that parents have the means to provide a basic education for their children and so that women, including those in rural areas, have got access to information. For example, this first-ever cyberforum meant a breakthrough for a woman from Benin who produces dried cashew nuts manually with six people. Thanks to the Internet, she found a market in the United States. Sure, she will need funding for more modern equipment, and more personnel: but the diaspora will help her there.

5000|$|Dr. George Hill Hodel, Jr. {{came under}} police {{scrutiny}} in October 1949, when his 14-year-old daughter, Tamar, {{accused him of}} molesting her. Despite three witnesses testifying that they had seen Hodel having sex with Tamar, he was acquitted in December 1949. The trial led the LAPD to include Hodel, a physician specializing in sexually transmitted diseases, among its many suspects in the Dahlia case. Police put Hodel under surveillance from February 18 to March 27, 1950, to ascertain whether he could be implicated in the murder. In the surviving transcripts of microphone recordings, Hodel was heard making highly incriminating statements.Supposin' <b>I</b> <b>did</b> kill the Black Dahlia. They couldn't prove it now.
