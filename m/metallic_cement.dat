40|$|Hipresurfacing (HR) is {{a highly}} {{attractive}} option for young and active patients. Some surgeons have advocated cementing the metaphyseal stem of the femoral component to improve fixation and survivorship of HR. However, extending component fixation to the metaphysis may promote femoral head strain shielding, which in turn may reduce survival of the femoral component. Replacing the metallic metaphyseal stem by a composite material with bone-matching properties could help to alleviate this phenomenon. This study uses finite element analysis to examine the strain state in the femoral head for three types of implant fixation: an unfixed metallic stem, an osseointegrated biomimetic stem and a <b>cemented</b> <b>metallic</b> stem. Boneremodeling is also simulated to evaluate long-term bone resorption due to strain shielding. Results show that the unfixed stem causes strain shielding in the femoral head, and that cementing the stem increases strain shielding. The biomimetic stem does not eliminate the strain shielding effect, but reduces it significantly versus the <b>metallic</b> <b>cemented</b> version. The current finite element study suggests that an osseointegrated metaphyseal stem made of biomimetic material in hipresurfacingimplants could become an interesting alternative when fixation extension is desired.

A total of 34 proximally roughened cemented stems were implanted in 33 consecutive patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty by a single surgeon. An alarmingly high failure rate was observed, prompting a retrospective chart review, analysis of radiographs, and evaluation of retrieved stems and pathological specimens. Nineteen patients were available with more than two years follow-up. Of these 19 patients, nine stems had failed (47 %) due to severe osteolysis and stem loosening.

Using Isotopic Neutron Source, the delayed gamma-rays emitted due to neutron capture have been applied for {{the investigation of the}} elemental constituents and concentrations of major, minor and trace elements in such samples. The experimental investigations were carried out at the scale of researcher's practices at the chosen site by measuring soil/rock nutrient contents from hydrologically isolated farmland/site plots. Using detailed sampling procedures with special precautions, against contaminations, to yield meaningful results, soil/rock samples have been collected from selected areas of East Gojjam, pulverized, homogenized and prepared for irradiation. The samples were properly prepared together with known standards of potassium iodide or cupric sulphate or arsenic trioxide (one /or both at a time), and simultaneously irradiated in to isotopic neutron ux in the same irradiation position. After activation, the samples were subjected to gamma-ray spectrometry, using a high-purity germanium detection system and computerized multichannel analyzer. The gamma-ray spectra from the irradiated samples were measured by high resolution gamma-ray spectrometry with a calibrated germanium detector. Both qualitative and quantitative approach to data collection and analysis were used in order to gain insight into what should be acceptable to the community. The results obtained have a practical interest in view of possible applications to the technology of extraction and exploration of a variety of industrial, <b>metallic,</b> <b>cement</b> minerals, and geothermal energy and coal deposits. These results tend to agree with the lowest values reported in the literature, and the analytical precision is su cient for the determination of the standard deviation of the distribution of all elements in East Gojjam and these results were brie y discussed within the text of this research work.

Here we extend these capabilities to human femurs undergoing a total hip replacement using cemented prostheses. Methods: A fresh-frozen human femur was CT-scanned and thereafter in-vitro loaded in a stance position until fracture at the neck. The {{head and neck}} were removed and the femur was implanted with a cemented prosthesis. The fixed femur was CT-scanned and loaded through the prosthesis so that strains and displacements were measured. High-order FE models based on the CT scans, mimicking the experiments, were constructed to check the simulations prediction capabilities.

Material and method Thirty-six replicas of epoxy resin mixed with glass microfibers were made from an endodontically-treated human premolar root prepared to a length of 12 mm with a custom drill, leaving the apical 4 mm unprepared. Replicas were randomly restored with (n = 12) : FP-LM (fiber post with low elastic modulus– 50 GPa), FP-HM (fiber post with high elastic modulus – 67 GPa) and MP (metallic post – 208 GPa), using self-curing adhesive and dual resin cement. Cores were built up with composite resin and <b>metallic</b> crowns were <b>cemented</b> in all the roots with self-adhesive resin cement with self-curing mode. Specimens were subjected to a fracture load test (45 ° inclination/ 0. 5 mm/min) and displacement was registered at 100 N. Result One-way ANOVA showed that elastic modulus of the post {{did not affect the}} fracture load means (p = 0. 203) (FP-LM: 237. 4 ± 65. 11 N; FP-HM: 236. 7 ± 92. 85 N; MP: 295. 8 ± 108. 7 N) but was statistically significant for the displacement (p < 0. 00) : Tukey’s test showed that FP-LM displacement mean (0. 81 ± 0. 15 mm) was significantly higher than those for FP-HM (0. 46 ± 0. 26 mm; p = 0. 00) and MP (0. 62 ± 0. 07 mm; p = 0. 04).

40|$|By {{reducing}} the <b>metallic</b> binder in <b>cemented</b> carbides, so-called binderless hardmetals or pure tungsten carbide ceramics can ultimately be achieved. Nanoscaled tungsten carbide {{has a very}} high hardness of above 3000 HV 1 and still offers quite a good fracture toughness of up to 7. 5 MPa * m 1 / 2. Since only solid state sintering can be used, sintering temperatures as high as 2000 °C or higher are normally needed to completely densify these materials. At these temperatures abnormal grain growth {{which leads to a}} decrease in hardness is an often reported problem. However, using pressure assisted techniques such as SPS, ROC or HIP, WC ceramics can be produced at lower temperatures, although productivity and freedom in size and form are limited. The aim of this work was to investigate the drivers for densification, grain growth as well as the microstructure and chemical phases occurring during solid state sintering in a conventional SinterHIP furnace. A WC starting powder with DB ET = 115 nm was milled to nanoscaled size (50 to 60 nm), sintered at different temperatures (interrupted sintering experiments) and then analysed by using FESEM, XRD, Rietveld analysis, dilatometry and other methods. It could be shown that three main processes during sintering of slightly under-stoichiometric binderless WC hardmetals occur: first, the reduction of surface oxides at 800 °C after which densification starts due to cleaned surfaces and the existence of W in a nascent state; second, the secondary carburisation of WC and W at around 1400 °C; and, third, grain growth and pore annealing at around 1600 °C when a closed porosity exists. By adding Cr 3 C 2 as grain growth inhibitor the secondary carburisation step was lowered to around 1000 °C and a solid solution of (W,Cr) 2 instead of pure W 2 C was formed...|$|R
40|$|Hip {{resurfacing}} arthroplasty (HRA) {{is proposed}} {{as an alternative}} to total hip arthroplasty for patients suffering from osteoarthritis or degenerative arthrosis. HRA consist in removing the articular surface of the femoral head and replacing it with a spherical metallic implant that has a thin straight stem used as an alignment aid during implantation. HRA cannot be offered to all patients due to surgical contraindications related to bone quality in the femoral head. To overcome some of those problems, it has been suggested in the literature to cement the alignment stem of the femoral component. However, this could generate stress shielding (understressed bone tends to resorb, thus destabilizing the implant and causing aseptic loosening) in the femoral head, which could compromise the implant long term stability. The use of a biomimetic composite material with bone-matching properties could be a means of using the stem to optimize load transfer to the femoral bone. This optimisation would aim at minimizing stress shielding in the femoral head for an implant with a fixed stem, benefiting from the same stability as cemented stem implants without the increased stress shielding. The current thesis objective was to evaluate this solution by developing a finite element model of a hip resurfacing femoral component with a stem made of biomimetic composite material, and to evaluate its potential in terms of stress shielding reduction and biomechanical performance. Numerical results from a first study showed reduction of stress shielding for the implant with a fixed biomimetic stem when compared with a <b>cemented</b> <b>metallic</b> stem, but the biomimetic stem was still stress shielded when compared with an unfixed metallic stem or healthy femur. A second study examined modeling methods for bone-cement and bone-implant load-bearing interfaces for different fixation scenarios. It showed that traditional methods (bonded /frictional contact elements) created under certain circumstances unrealistic results such as complete absence of micromotions at bone-stem interface. A new interface element was developed to address some of the limitations observed on traditional interface modeling methods. This new interface element aimed at simulating the progressive degradation of bone-cement interfaces and osseointegration of bone-implant interfaces. Numerical results obtained with the biomimetic implant using the new element showed a partial osseointegration pattern on the stem surface, with the presence of “spot-welds” (localised points of perfect osseointegration). The new implant with its biomimetic stem allows reduction of stress shielding when compared with current metallic implants. Recommendations following this thesis include optimisation of the geometrical shape of the biomimetic stem, in order to further improve load transfer to the femoral proximal bone...|$|R

Porém, foi evidenciada diferença estatisticamente significativa dos valores iniciais entre os grupos A e C e dos valores finais entre os grupos A e B, A e C, B e C. A conexão cone morse apresentou os maiores valores de destorque inicial e final, mostrando-se mais estável. Currently {{the rehabilitation}} of patients totally or partially toothless with implantsupported prothesis constitutes a primary choice treatment in Dentistry. The success of the treatment {{is related to the}} precision and adaptation of components, {{as well as to the}} stability of the implant/abutment interface submitted to mastication loads. The unitary restoration is bio-mechanically more complex, especially for the posterior units. The objective of this study is to compare values of torque and detorque recorded for the screw of the abutment with external hexagon, internal hexagon and morse taper in unitary restorations, before and after the mechanical test. Fifteen samples were divided into three groups: Group A implant of external hexagon; Group B implant of internal hexagon and Group C morse taper implant. Universal abutments were torqued over the implants and <b>metallic</b> crowns were <b>cemented</b> over the abutments. Samples were submitted to mechanical test of a million cycles, frequency of 8 cycles per second and load equivalent to 400 N. Application and recording of torque and detorque values at screws of the abutment were carried out before and after the mechanical test. Results of a Tukey test with a 5 % level of significance showed no statistically significant difference between the initial and the final detorque values in samples of the same group. However, a statistically significant difference was found for the initial detorque values between the groups A and C and for the final detorque values between A and B, A and C, B and C. The Morse taper connection showed higher values of initial and final detorque values, therefore bearing increased stability...|$|R
40|$|Tribocorrosion plays a {{significant}} role in the performance and failure of implantable metallic devices. The damage caused by tribocorrosion has been reported previously in several implantable devices such as disk replacements, bone plates, the interface between the fixation <b>cement</b> and the <b>metallic</b> stem in <b>cemented</b> hip arthroplasties and also in the taper-trunnion contact area of hip replacements. The origin of the tribocorrosion processes is produced at the nanoscale as a result of the micromotion between hard single asperities and the metallic components at their contacting interfaces. Hard particles cause deformation and wear of the surfaces and depassivation, opening new metallic areas to corrosive attack. The combination of both processes produces the liberation of metallic ions and metal debris responsible for adverse reactions within the body, causing pain and the need for implant revision. Significant research has been undertaken to understand the wear-corrosion mechanisms at the macro and micro scale. The focus has been on different experimental conditions and the effects of the environment (protein-phosphate contents or pH), the role played by the microstructure of CoCrMo alloys and the contact conditions or the wear mode (sliding, fretting, scratching). However, no work has been undertaken into the interaction of plastic deformation and corrosion mechanisms at the nano-scale. For a better understanding of the combined effects of the corrosion and the deformation processes, a new electrochemistry cell was designed in combination with the nanoindenter systemto simulate a single asperity in contact with a metallic surface. Four CoCrMo alloys with different manufacturing and thermal histories were analysed toobtain a deformation-corrosion map which summarizes their scratch-corrosion performance at the nano-scale. The microstructure, chemical composition and mechanical properties of the Forged, As Cast (AC), As Cast thermal treated (AC-TT) and As Cast with low carbon content (AC-LC) Co based alloys were studied. Grain size, carbide morphology, carbon content and crystallographic phases present were analysed by metallographic preparation, Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) observations and Electron Backscattered Diffraction (EBSD) techniques respectively. Hardness (H) and Young’s Modulus (E) were calculated by indentation and nano-indentation techniques. Static corrosion behaviour of the four alloys immersed in 0. 9 wt. % NaCl solution was studied using open circuit potential (OCP) and potentiodynamic (PD) polarization experiments to understand the corrosion mechanisms affecting the alloys without the interference of the plastic deformation and to estimate the minimum stabilization time required to reach a steady potential to be used in the nano-scratch corrosion experiments. The deformation processes under fretting, reciprocating sliding and scratch experiments in dry conditions were also characterized by measuring tangential friction forces, coefficient of friction and plastic deformation values. Post experimental surface analysis was performed to analyse the oxide layer formation and the wear scar morphology. The four CoCrMo alloys were tested under several loading conditions using the new electrochemistry cell performing single scratch-corrosion experiments. The results demonstrated that the crystallographic orientation of the grains produced characteristic deformation features. These features were directly linked to therepassivation times and current densities and were governing the deformation corrosion processes at the nano-scale and the liberation of metallic ions. This work establishes a novel experimental technique that gives a better understanding of the deformation-corrosion processes occurring at the nano-scale in CoCrMo alloys. In addition the results obtained will be useful to help interpret the failure mechanisms observed in retrieved implants and improve the design and development of new materials and material pairing selection for future implants. Moreover the technique developed as part of this work can be extended not just to biomedical applications but also to any other applications in the materials science field where passivated metals are used in a corrosive environment and single asperity contacts act to deform metallic surfaces...|$|R
