40|$|Internal defects {{are among}} the {{problems}} in gravity casting of aluminum parts. The main internal volumetric defects are gas and shrinkage defects which form during solidification of the melt and drastically reduce {{the quality of the}} produced parts. These defects adversely affect the mechanical properties of thin walled castings parts. In this study, ceramic nanoparticles coatings were applied on the sand mold and the effect of mold coatings on the reduction of defects were investigated. X-ray radiography was used to detect defects in sand molds with ceramic nanoparticles coatings. For comparison, this test was performed on molds with micro-ceramic and graffiti coatings and uncoated sand mold. The results showed that the maximum amount of gas and shrinkage defects was observed in casting parts from AL 4 - 1 alloy in uncoated molds. On the other hand, the minimum defects were found in <b>molds</b> <b>coated</b> with ceramic nanoparticles. It seems that the reduced defects in casting parts in <b>molds</b> <b>coated</b> with ceramic nanoparticles may be due to high thermal and chemical stability and higher heat transfer rate of the coating.

After studying the contact angle and reaction between the molten silicon and other various high melting point materials, {{it was found that}} for shaped crystal growth with a lower impurity contamination level, a combination coating of SiaN 4 and SiO 2 is suitable for a <b>mold</b> <b>coating</b> material. A double layer coating was applied to the graphite mold base.

40|$|Microextrusion is {{becoming}} increasingly important for the manufacturing of microcomponents. However, this reduction in scale to a microlevel means that the influence of friction {{and the need for}} suitable lubrication are greatly increased. This study therefore looks at the use of a low-friction and highly wear resistant Graphit-ic coating on the mold-forming section of a microextrusion <b>mold,</b> this <b>coating</b> being applied by a closed-field unbalanced magnetron sputter ion plating technique.

In this research, Si-HDPE hybrid micro-lens arrays were press molded under various conditions, and the form accuracy and surface integrity of the molded lenses were evaluated. Air trapping occurs inside the micro-lens cavities during molding in a non-vacuum environment, which leads to severe surface defects. To investigate the air trapping phenomenon, a new in-situ observation system was developed which enables real-time direct observation of the molding process. From the in-situ observations, {{it was found that}} air traps were formed among the HDPE pellets during melting, and an increase in the pressing force will increase the pressure of the trapped air, forming trenches on the lens surface. The trapped air also impacts the <b>mold</b> <b>coating,</b> causing trench formation on the coating surface. To minimize air trapping, the molding temperature, and pressing force must be strictly controlled. By performing press molding in a vacuum environment, trench formation was completely eliminated.

Commercially available thermoelectric modules {{are based on}} planar structures, whereas tubular modules may have advantages for integration and performance {{in the field of}} automotive waste heat recovery. One major drawback of tubular generator designs is the necessity for ring-shaped legs made from thermoelectric material. Cutting these geometries from sintered tablets leads to considerable loss of thermoelectric material and therefore high cost. Direct sintering of ring-shaped legs or tubes of thermoelectric material is a solution to this problem. However, sintering such rings with high homogeneity and density faces some difficulties related to the mechanical properties of typical thermoelectric materials such as lead telluride (PbTe) â€”particularly brittleness and high coefficient of thermal expansion. This work shows a process for production of thermoelectric rings made of p- and n-doped PbTe.

Consequently, considerable attention in the literature {{is given to the}} rheology of suspensions of particles. Most studies are focused on highly filled systems (typically, volume fractions greater than 10 %), with polydisperse particles of irregular shapes due to their technological importance. In contrast, realtively few studies are conducted on the rheology of dilute or semi-dilute suspensions of monodisperse spheres. In the first part we elucidate the effect of viscoelasticity on the bulk rheological properties. The behavior of model suspensions composed of non Brownian, inertialess, rigid spheres immersed in Newtonian and viscoelastic matrices is investigated in the concentration range from 0 up to 10 %, thus encompassing both the dilute and semidilute regimes. The data are fitted with quadratic polynomial functions of the particle volume fraction in order to compare with theoretical, empirical and experimental models. As second part, new simulation technique for suspensions in Newtonian fluids under oscillatory shear flow is presented. The cases of a single sphere and two particles are studied and discussed. Finally, the flow induced microstructure of suspensions in viscoelastic fluids is studied by rheo-optical techniques.

30|$|In addition, many reports {{including}} the above two are for PDMS filling into protruded features (e.g., {{an array of}} pillar) in the master mold that is easier when the pillars are well separated than filling into (recessed) holes. This is because for the application as nanoimprint mold, the hole pattern in PDMS (pillar in the master mold) is much more mechanically stable than the pillar pattern (hole in the master mold). For hole filling by PDMS, one study claimed filling of 100 - to 200 -nm diameter holes in porous alumina, but unfortunately, this claim was not supported by its experimental results [6]. Two other studies on PDMS filling into porous alumina also obtained very shallow and incomplete filling [7, 8]. Another recent study showed complete filling into large 750 -nm diameter holes in the silicon master <b>mold</b> <b>coated</b> with anti-adhesion layer [9]. In this study, we achieved a hole filling down to sub- 200 -nm diameter by additional solvent treatment of the mold that was already coated with an anti-adhesion monolayer. Our study suggests that the wetting properties between PDMS and mold are important for PDMS filling into the nanoscale pattern, and the improved filling by the diluted PDMS could be mainly due to the diluent toluene or hexane increasing in situ the surface energy of the anti-adhesion-treated mold, rather than due to the reduced viscosity of the diluted PDMS. As such, our study represents a significant step forward in understanding this very widely employed process. However, even taking into consideration of both viscosity and surface energy/wetting property, we {{are not able to}} explain why smaller holes cannot be filled. Further theoretical and experimental study is needed in order to elucidate the hole filling process by PDMS.|$|R
