5|$|It {{has been}} said that an error of fact {{involves}} a situation where there are new or different primary facts yet to be put before the court, such as a new witness, or what people saw or heard, whereas an error of law involves a <b>misinterpretation</b> of a statutory word or phrase with regard to such facts. However, this distinction is debatable, and the view has been taken that courts sometimes simply regard a matter as one involving an error of law if they wish to adopt an interventionist approach, and seek to allow judicial review to take place.|$|E
5|$|As {{with other}} early sauropodomorphs, {{it has been}} {{proposed}} that Massospondylus had cheeks. This theory was proposed {{because there are a}} few large holes for blood vessels on the surfaces of the jaw bones, unlike the numerous small holes present on the jaws of cheekless reptiles. The cheeks would have prevented food from spilling out when Massospondylus ate. Crompton and Attridge (1986) described skulls of Massospondylus as possessing pronounced overbites and suggested the presence of a horny beak on the tip of the lower jaw {{to make up the difference}} in length and account for tooth wear on the teeth at the tip of the snout. However, the difference in length may be a <b>misinterpretation</b> based on crushing in a top–bottom plane, and the possession of a beak is considered unlikely in recent studies.|$|E
5|$|The History of Animals {{contains}} many accurate eye-witness observations, in particular {{of the marine}} biology around the island of Lesbos, such as that the octopus had colour-changing abilities and a sperm-transferring tentacle, that the young of a dogfish grow inside their mother's body, or that the male of a river catfish guards the eggs after the female has left. Some of these were long considered fanciful before being rediscovered in the nineteenth century. Aristotle {{has been accused of}} making errors, but some are due to <b>misinterpretation</b> of his text, and others may have been based on genuine observation. He did however make somewhat uncritical use of evidence from other people, such as travellers and beekeepers.|$|E

5|$|In the United States, the {{legality}} of DFS has been determined on a state-by-state basis based on local gambling laws and other rulings. The federal Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act (UIEGA) contains language dictating that fantasy sports are not considered an unlawful wager under the act; however, the act only prohibits the electronic transfer of funds from unlawful gambling as defined under state laws. A number of state attorneys general have issued opinions concluding that DFS {{is a form of}} illegal gambling, while the state of Nevada declared that DFS games must be licensed as a sports pool. The New York State ruling, which resulted from an investigation of DFS services after it was alleged that employees working for DraftKings and FanDuel had used inside information to win cash prizes from each other, spawned retaliatory lawsuits from the companies which alleged that the rulings were the result of a <b>misinterpretation</b> of the nature of their services. The state has since joined other states, such as Massachusetts and Virginia, in choosing to legalize and regulate DFS rather than prohibit it.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{recognizable}} of all dinosaurs, Stegosaurus has been depicted on film, in cartoons and comics, as children's toys, and was even declared the State Dinosaur of Colorado in 1982. Due to the fragmentary nature of most early Stegosaurus fossil finds, it took many years before reasonably accurate restorations of these animals could be produced. The earliest popular image of Stegosaurus was an engraving produced by A. Tobin for the November 1884 issue of Scientific American, which included the dinosaur amid a speculative Morrison age landscape. Tobin restored the Stegosaurus as bipedal and long-necked, with the plates arranged along the tail and the back covered in spikes. This covering of spikes might {{have been based on}} a <b>misinterpretation</b> of the teeth, which Marsh had noted were oddly shaped, cylindrical, and found scattered, such that he thought they {{might turn out to be}} small dermal spines.|$|E
5|$|The name Level Mountain is a {{reference}} to the gently sloping plateau surface of this large volcano. It was adopted on December 21, 1944 as identified in the Canada Department of Mines Summary Report, 1925, Part A. This name appeared on the National Topographic System (NTS) map 104/NE but was replaced with the name Level Mountain Range on August 14, 1952 upon production of NTS map 104J. The reason for this name change was that cartographers were uncertain as to what the name Level Mountain referred to. They cited H. S. Bostock's 1948 report Physiography of the Canadian Cordillera, With Special Reference to the Area North of the Fifty-Fifth Parallel in which Bostock stated that Level Mountain is a small prominent mountain range on the Nahlin Plateau. Despite this <b>misinterpretation,</b> Level Mountain is still the local name for the entire massif and the Level Mountain Range for a range of steep peaks centered on the volcano's summit.|$|E

40|$|Background: Somatoform {{disorders}} {{are characterized by}} multiple recurring symptoms that resemble physical illnesses but defy medical explanation. Psychological models suggest that catastrophizing <b>misinterpretations</b> of harmless physical symptoms play a key role. However, {{the question of whether}} such biases predict somatoform-related symptoms and the onset of somatoform disorders has not been adressed. Hence, the aim {{of the present study was}} to further advance our understanding of the role of catastrophizing <b>misinterpretations</b> in somatoform disorders. Methods: In the present study, we used data from the Dresden Predictor Study (N = 1538), in which an epidemiologic sample of young German women was tested at two time points approximately 17 months apart. Each participant completed a diagnostic interview, an interpretation questionnaire for somatoform and hypochondriacal symptoms, and three measures of such symptomatology: somatization subscale of the Symptom Checklist- 90 -Revised (SCL- 90 -R), Whiteley Index (WI), Body Sensations Questionnaire (BSQ). Results: At follow-up, 33 women were diagnosed with new onsets of lifetime somatoform disorder. Results showed that catastrophizing <b>misinterpretations</b> assessed at baseline were predictive of somatoform-related symptoms at follow-up, i. e., symptoms assessed with the WI and BSQ. Moreover, catastrophizing <b>misinterpretations</b> were predictive of new onsets of somatoform disorders, even after controlling for general threat-related <b>misinterpretations</b> and indices of somatoform symptoms (i. e., SCL- 90 -R and BSQ). Conclusions: This is the first prospective, longitudinal study to demonstrate that catastrophizing <b>misinterpretations</b> have incremental validity as predictors of future somatoform-related symptomatology and somatoform disorders...|$|R
5|$|Using {{a similar}} strategy, S. D. Malone and S. Bor {{analyzed}} the known intensities for the 1872 shock, then compared intensity patterns {{for a number}} of instrumentally recorded earthquakes that also occurred in the Pacific Northwest. A factor that was taken into consideration was that for earthquakes that have either circular or slightly elliptical isoseismal maps, the epicenter is usually close {{to the center of the}} pattern, but that for shocks where instrumental information are also available, the epicenter is sometimes not where it would have been assumed to be, had only the intensity information (and no instrumental information) been available. An isoseismal map of the 1949 Olympia earthquake was presented as an example of a distorted or convoluted pattern that was attributed to local geological conditions that either attenuated or amplified the seismic waves, and it was emphasized that not taking into account these local features could lead to a <b>misinterpretation</b> of the felt intensities and to a misplaced epicenter.|$|E

40|$|Two {{individual}} differences experiments {{examined the relationship}} between executive control and the revision of <b>misinterpretations</b> in sentence comprehension. Garden-path sentences were used as they often lead to initial <b>misinterpretations,</b> necessitating revision during comprehension. In addition to garden-path revision, verbal and non-verbal executive controls were assessed by using the verbal and non-verbal version of the Stroop task. Experiment 1 showed that garden-path revision errors in a grammaticality judgement task correlated with verbal Stroop interference errors. Experiment 2 further showed that the time taken to revise the garden-path interpretation correlated with the time taken to resolve verbal Stroop interference, but not with the time taken to resolve non-verbal Stroop interference. Together, the results argue for a role of executive control, which is possibly domain-specific, in the revision of <b>misinterpretations</b> during sentence comprehension.

40|$|The use of {{significance}} tests in science has been debated from {{the invention of}} these tests until the present time.
