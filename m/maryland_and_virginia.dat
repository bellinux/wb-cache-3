5|$|During the American Revolutionary War, the Continental Congress {{directed}} {{the organization of}} the <b>Maryland</b> <b>and</b> <b>Virginia</b> Rifle Regiment in resolves dated June 17 and 27, 1776. The unit comprised three of the four independent Continental rifle companies that had formed in <b>Maryland</b> <b>and</b> <b>Virginia</b> by decree of Congress in mid-1775, and six new companies—two from Maryland and four from Virginia. The three 1775 companies, among the first of the colonial units to join the newly constituted Continental Army, were raised and initially commanded by Capts. Michael Cresap, Thomas Price, and Hugh Stephenson. The nine-company force became a regiment on the same tables of organization as the 1st Continental Regiment, which was originally the Pennsylvania Rifle Regiment. Unlike this Pennsylvania unit, however, the <b>Maryland</b> <b>and</b> <b>Virginia</b> Rifle Regiment was an Extra Continental regiment because of its two-state composition. It was not part of a state line organization but was instead directly accountable to national authority (Congress and the Continental Army). The <b>Maryland</b> <b>and</b> <b>Virginia</b> Rifle Regiment's field officers were drawn from the original three 1775 companies based on their seniority. Hugh Stephenson from Virginia became the colonel, and Marylanders Moses Rawlings of Cresap's company and Otho Holland Williams of Price's company were designated the lieutenant colonel and major, respectively. All company officers were appointed in the summer of 1776, and subsequent recruiting for the unit in the two states extended {{to the end of the}} year. Recruiting occurred in Frederick and Harford Counties, Maryland, and Berkeley, Frederick, Loudoun, Fauquier, Prince William, and Culpeper Counties, Virginia. The enlisted men of the regiment served for three years or the duration of the war.|$|E
5|$|Events in {{the capital}} began when Reagan's casket arrived at Andrews Air Force Base, Maryland. It {{was removed from the}} plane, driven by hearse in a {{procession}} through the <b>Maryland</b> <b>and</b> <b>Virginia</b> suburbs and the nation's capital, across the Memorial Bridge, and onto Constitution Avenue.|$|E
5|$|Soon after Lt. Col. Moses Rawlings, a Marylander, was {{exchanged}} from British captivity in late December 1777 or January 1778, the Board of War, at {{the request}} of the Maryland state government, assigned him command of the prisoner-of-war camp at Fort Frederick, Maryland, and its state militia guard. The elements of the <b>Maryland</b> <b>and</b> <b>Virginia</b> Rifle Regiment in the field continued to be led by the company commanders until recruiting could bring the regiment up to greater strength. Maj. Otho Holland Williams, exchanged on January 16, 1778 (likely with Rawlings), had been promoted to colonel of the 6th Maryland Regiment in December 1776 while a prisoner of war; he took command of this unit upon his release. The position of major in the reduced <b>Maryland</b> <b>and</b> <b>Virginia</b> Rifle Regiment was never refilled.|$|E

5|$|The <b>Maryland</b> <b>and</b> <b>Virginia</b> Rifle Regiment {{consisted}} of nine companies—four from Maryland and five from Virginia. The two-state {{composition of the}} new unit precluded it from being managed through a single state government, and it was therefore directly responsible to national authority as an Extra Continental regiment.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{ratification}} of the United States Constitution {{by the state of}} New York in 1788, the delegates agreed to keep New York City as the temporary federal capital. In 1790, Congress passed the Residence Act, which created the District of Columbia, located {{on the banks of the}} Potomac River from land belonging until that time to the states of <b>Maryland</b> <b>and</b> <b>Virginia,</b> to serve as the new federal capital.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Maryland</b> <b>and</b> <b>Virginia</b> Rifle Regiment complemented the {{existing}} garrison at Fort Pitt: the 8th Pennsylvania and 9th (formerly 13th) Virginia Regiments. The men of these Pennsylvania and Virginia line infantry units had been {{recruited from the}} central and western frontier counties of the two states and {{were assigned to the}} army's Western Department while at Valley Forge, reflecting a clear logic on Washington's part. With the arrival of Rawlings' regiment, Western Department commander Col. Daniel Brodhead now led a force of largely frontier raised men experienced in Indian-style woodlands warfare. In his most notable tactical achievement, Brodhead headed a campaign of about 600 of his Continental regulars, which included the <b>Maryland</b> <b>and</b> <b>Virginia</b> Rifle Regiment, local militia, and volunteers to the upper waters of the Allegheny River in August and September 1779, where they destroyed the villages and crops of hostile Mingo and Munsee Indians. Brodhead's expedition was part of Washington's wide-ranging, coordinated offensive of the summer of 1779 that also included the larger, concurrent Sullivan Campaign led by Maj. Gen. John Sullivan and Brig. Gen. James Clinton against enemy Iroquois and Loyalist units in southern and western New York State. From mid-1779 until late 1780, however, the <b>Maryland</b> <b>and</b> <b>Virginia</b> Rifle Regiment was primarily deployed in detachments to support line infantry contingents at several of the frontier outposts in the general vicinity of Fort Pitt, including Fort Laurens, Fort McIntosh, and Fort Henry (Wheeling) in what is now eastern Ohio, western Pennsylvania, and northernmost West Virginia, respectively.|$|E
5|$|To fix the {{problems}} McClellan perceived in Washington's defenses, he directed Colonel Barnard {{to construct a}} continuous line from the Potomac north of Alexandria to a point west of the Aqueduct Bridge, {{one of the three}} bridges that crossed the Potomac River. By the time the Army of the Potomac was deployed for the Peninsula Campaign in March 1862, the line of defenses stretched completely around Washington, and extensions to the ring of defenses ensured the protection of the town of Alexandria and the Chain Bridge, the furthest west of the three bridges connecting <b>Maryland</b> <b>and</b> <b>Virginia.</b>|$|E

5|$|Article One, Section Eight, of the United States Constitution granted Congress the {{authority}} to create a federal district {{to serve as the}} national capital. Following the ratification of the Constitution, the Congress, while meeting in New York, passed the Residence Act on July 9, 1790. The Act established the District of Columbia {{on the banks of the}} Potomac River between the states of <b>Maryland</b> <b>and</b> <b>Virginia</b> to serve as the new federal capital. However, Robert Morris, a Senator from Pennsylvania, convinced Congress to return to Philadelphia while the new permanent capital was being built. As a result, the Residence Act also declared Philadelphia to be the temporary capital for a period of ten years.|$|E
5|$|Based on its {{fundraising}} {{efforts and}} crowd {{estimates for the}} Obama inauguration, the presidential committee set its budget at $160–$170million for the inauguration, including about $45million for the gala events. The federal government contributed about $49million, including $1.2million to cover the actual swearing-in ceremony. The District of Columbia and the neighboring states of <b>Maryland</b> <b>and</b> <b>Virginia</b> projected costs to provide support for inaugural events at more than $75million alone for police, fire and medical services. To help fund the efforts, President George W. Bush declared a federal state of emergency as a precaution so that funds could be sought from Federal Emergency Management Agency.|$|E
5|$|Most {{members of}} the <b>Maryland</b> <b>and</b> <b>Virginia</b> Rifle Regiment, however, were not chosen for the Rifle Corps and {{remained}} with the Main Army. The Marylanders in Smith's composite company served with the 11th Virginia Regiment in the 3rd Virginia Brigade at the Battles of Brandywine and Germantown, {{as well as at}} the Battle of Monmouth after they were administratively attached to the 4th Maryland Regiment of the 2nd Maryland Brigade at the end of the 1777 campaign season. The Virginians in Long's composite company remained attached to the 11th Virginia Regiment and fought at the same engagements in 1777 and 1778. Lt. (later Capt.) Philip Slaughter was the acting commander of the company during Long's nearly two-year attachment to the Rifle Corps and its permanent commander after Long's resignation.|$|E

5|$|On November 1, 1780, Washington issued orders {{approved}} by Congress that specified {{plans for the}} comprehensive reorganization of the Continental Army effective January 1, 1781. All Additional and Extra Continental regiments, such as the <b>Maryland</b> <b>and</b> <b>Virginia</b> Rifle Regiment, {{that had not been}} annexed to a state line organization were disbanded by that date. The much-diminished unit comprised only 2 officers and 50 enlisted men in late December 1780. The officers received discharges on January 1, 1781, and the enlisted men of the unit were transferred to the Maryland Line. Relocation of the men from their remote post at Fort Pitt to their new assignments, however, was not completed until November 1781, at least in part because their officers were not present to supervise the process.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Maryland</b> <b>and</b> <b>Virginia</b> Rifle Regiment, most {{commonly}} known as Rawlings' Regiment in period documents, was organized in June 1776 as a specialized light infantry unit of riflemen in the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War. The American rifle units complemented the predominant, musket-equipped, line infantry forces of the war with their long-range marksmanship capability and were typically deployed with the line infantry as forward skirmishers and flanking elements. Scouting, escort, and outpost duties were also routine. The rifle units' battle formation {{was not nearly as}} structured as that of the line infantry units, which employed short-range massed firing in ordered linear formations. The riflemen could therefore respond with more adaptability to changing battle conditions.|$|E
5|$|The Maryland–Virginia {{football}} rivalry was {{a designated}} official ACC cross-divisional series when Maryland was an ACC member and the teams have a long-standing rivalry due to proximity and history. The programs also vie for recruits {{in the same}} region, and more recently, an additional factor has been the schools' academic competition. <b>Maryland</b> <b>and</b> <b>Virginia</b> have occasionally served as spoilers for one another by precluding a championship or bowl game appearance. Since Maryland is {{moving out of the}} ACC and into the Big Ten, the future of this series is in question. On January 12th, 2017, the schools jointly announced a home-home series would be played during the 2023 and 2024 seasons.|$|E

5|$|The {{success of}} these rifle units during the skirmishing period, coupled {{with the arrival of}} large numbers of new army recruits, led Washington to create {{additional}} provisional rifle companies. He placed them under the command of Daniel Morgan in early June 1777, calling the unit the Provisional Rifle Corps, although it was most commonly known as Morgan's Rifle Corps in period documents. Morgan then simultaneously led the 11th Virginia Regiment, his permanent unit, and this provisional unit. Thirty-five officers and enlisted men in Smith's and Long's composite companies, as well as others selected from their regular musket regiments, were detached from their permanent units to form this elite regiment-sized force. The men from the <b>Maryland</b> <b>and</b> <b>Virginia</b> Rifle Regiment all served in one of the Rifle Corps' eight companies, Capt. Gabriel Long's Provisional Rifle Company; {{with the exception of a}} single man, all other members of the company came from the 11th Virginia Regiment. Like Morgan, Long was now technically in command of two Continental Army units, one permanent and one provisional. Long served in the Rifle Corps until his resignation in May 1779, at which time command of his company passed to Marylander Lt. Elijah Evans, also one of the original officers of the <b>Maryland</b> <b>and</b> <b>Virginia</b> Rifle Regiment. Evans returned to Rawlings' regiment, his permanent unit, when his detached duty in the Rifle Corps ended with its formal disbanding in early November 1779. The Rifle Corps is most notable for the major role it played in the Battles of Saratoga.|$|E
5|$|With the {{formation}} of WMATA in October 1966, planning of the system shifted from federal hands to a regional body {{with representatives of the}} District, <b>Maryland</b> <b>and</b> <b>Virginia.</b> Congressional route approval was no longer a key consideration. Instead, routes had to serve each local suburban jurisdiction to assure that they would approve bond referenda to finance the system. Because the least expensive way to build into the suburbs was to rely upon existing railroad right-of-ways, the Orange Line took much of its present form, except that it also featured a further extension along the railroad to Bowie, Maryland and along the Dulles Access Road to the Dulles Airport.|$|E
5|$|The Washington Metro, known colloquially as Metro and branded Metrorail, is {{the heavy}} rail rapid transit system serving the Washington {{metropolitan}} {{area in the}} United States. It {{is administered by the}} Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA), which also operates Metrobus service under the Metro name. Besides the District of Columbia, Metro serves several jurisdictions in the states of <b>Maryland</b> <b>and</b> <b>Virginia.</b> In Maryland, Metro provides service to Montgomery and Prince George's counties; in Virginia, to Arlington and Fairfax counties and the independent city of Alexandria. Combined with its ridership in the independent Virginia cities of Falls Church and Fairfax, the Metro service area is largely coextensive with the inner ring of the Washington metropolitan area. The system is currently being expanded to reach Dulles International Airport and Loudoun County, Virginia. It operates mostly as a subway in the District itself, while most of the suburban tracks are at surface level or elevated.|$|E
