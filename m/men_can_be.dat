5|$|The use of wool in {{the uniform}} {{meant that the}} uniforms were not suited to the warm climates that were common in the South. This contributed to many Confederate {{soldiers}} suffering from heatstroke on long marches. However, one understanding of the heavy woolen garments is that after the marching during the day time, when the soldiers would rest at night and cool themselves down, the thermal-shock could render some men unable to function the next day. As such, the woolen garments would protect the soldiers from this, and keep them able to keep marching {{the next day to}} fulfill their duties. This was also the case with the better equipped U.S. Army. Many Confederate soldiers started the war with frock coats. However, cloth shortages and wartime wear insured that, by 1863, waist-length cadet gray or butternut shell jackets were generally worn by Confederates in the Eastern and Western Theater. Examples of frock coats being worn by enlisted <b>men</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> seen in photographs taken after the battles of Gettysburg, (1863), and Spotsylvania, (1864).|$|E

25|$|A second graph-theoretic {{description}} {{of the problem is}} also possible. Once the women have been seated, the possible seating arrangements for the remaining <b>men</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> described as perfect matchings in a graph formed by removing a single Hamiltonian cycle from a complete bipartite graph; the graph has edges connecting open seats to men, and the removal of the cycle corresponds to forbidding the men to sit in either of the open seats adjacent to their wives. The problem of counting matchings in a bipartite graph, and therefore a fortiori the problem of computing ménage numbers, can be solved using the permanents of certain 0-1 matrices. In the case of the ménage problem, the matrices arising from this view of the problem are circulant matrices.|$|E
25|$|According to its Working Policy the Seventh-day Adventist Church restricts certain {{positions}} {{of service and}} responsibility {{to those who have}} been ordained to the gospel ministry and the General Conference (GC) session, which is the highest decision-making body of the church, has never approved the ordination of women as ministers. Adventists have found no clear mandate or precedent for the practice of ordaining women in Scripture or in the writings of Ellen G. White. In recent years the ordination of women {{has been the subject of}} heated debate, especially in North America and Europe. In the Adventist church, candidates for ordination are recommended by local conferences (which usually administer about 50–150 local congregations) and approved by unions (which serve about 6–12 conferences). The church's Fundamental Beliefs and its worldwide practice as set forth in its Church Manual, including the worldwide qualifications for ordination currently restricted to <b>men,</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> revised only at the GC session.|$|E
500|$|Written {{almost a}} decade before Sherwood Anderson {{established}} himself as a writer with the release of his 1919 short story cycle, Winesburg, Ohio, Marching Men is generally considered, along with Windy McPherson's Sons and two other unpublished novels, as one of Anderson's [...] "apprentice novels".

60|$|And {{yet there}} is an exception. If there were one man at table who was admittedly blind, should we not give {{him the benefit of}} the doubt? Should we not {{honestly}} feel that he was the exception that proved the rule? The very fact that he could not have seen would remind us that the other men must have seen. The very fact that he had no eyes must remind us of eyes. A <b>man</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> blind; a <b>man</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> dead; a <b>man</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> mad.

For it is the essence of madness to be unlike anything else in the world: which is perhaps why so many men wiser than we have traced it to another.|$|R

500|$|Writing {{more than}} thirty years after the novel's debut, author Joseph Conrad agreed that the novel's main {{struggle}} was internal rather than external, and that Fleming [...] "stands before the unknown. He would like to prove to himself by some reasoning process that he will not 'run from the battle'. And in his unblooded regiment he can find no help. He is alone with the problem of courage." [...] Crane's realistic portrayal of the psychological struck a chord with reviewers; as one contemporary critic wrote for The New York Press: [...] "At times the description is so vivid as to be almost suffocating. The reader is right down in the midst of it where patriotism is dissolved into its elements and where only a dozen <b>men</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> seen, firing blindly and grotesquely into the smoke. This is war from a new point of view." ...|$|E
500|$|In Belgium, a General Council was {{organized}} in 1911 by Antoine to manage all material issues. It is currently composed of nine members including a chairman, a treasurer and a secretary. The founction of the First Representative of the Father was abolished in 1971, {{and there are}} no internal regulations in the temples. In France, the movement is led by a religious association called [...] "Culte Antoiniste" [...] ("Antoinist Worship"). All the desservants are part of a College of Desservants which manage the material issues, and whose decisions are implemented by an Administrative Committee. Within the college, a Moral Secretary is elected and serves as legal representative of the religion. Locally, the desservants nominate auxiliaries among the dressed followers so that they perform reading during worship and/or serve as healers. A Council of Local Interior composed of seven members including desservants is used for issues related to the temple on which it depends. Women as well as <b>men</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> chosen as ministers, as Catherine promoted gender equality in the worship. In all cases, Antoine, although deceased, remains the leader of the religion, which led Debouxhtay to compare him to the Pope in the Catholic Church.|$|E
