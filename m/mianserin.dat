25|$|The {{primary use}} of {{trazodone}} is {{the treatment of}} major depression. Data from open and double-blind trials suggest the antidepressant efficacy of trazodone is {{comparable to that of}} amitriptyline, doxepin, and <b>mianserin.</b> Also, trazodone showed anxiolytic properties, low cardiotoxicity, and relatively mild side effects.|$|E
25|$|Mirtazapine is a tetracyclic piperazinoazepine; <b>mianserin</b> was {{developed}} by the same team of organic chemists and mirtazapine differs from it via addition of a nitrogen atom in one of the rings. It is a racemic mixture of enantiomers. The (S)-(+)-enantiomer is known as esmirtazapine.|$|E
25|$|The drug {{acts as an}} {{antagonist}} {{of certain}} adrenergic and serotonin receptors, and is also a strong antihistamine. It is sometimes described as a noradrenergic and specific serotonergic antidepressant (NaSSA), although the actual {{evidence in support of}} this label has been regarded as poor. Chemically, mirtazapine is a tetracyclic antidepressant (TeCA), with four interconnected rings of atoms, and is a relative of the TeCA <b>mianserin</b> (Tolvon).|$|E
25|$|Serotonin {{is known}} to {{regulate}} aging, learning and memory. The first evidence comes {{from the study of}} longevity in C. elegans. During early phase of aging, the level of serotonin increases, which alters locomotory behaviors and associative memory. The effect is restored by mutations and drugs (including <b>mianserin</b> and methiothepin) that inhibit serotonin receptors. The observation does not contradict with the notion that the serotonin level goes down in mammals and humans, which is typically seen in late but not early phase of aging.|$|E

Clozapine users in the United States, Australia, Canada, and the UK must be nationally registered for monitoring of low WBC and absolute neutrophil counts (ANC).|$|E
50|$|Carbamazepine and {{phenobarbital}} {{will cause}} the body to metabolize <b>mianserin</b> faster and may reduce its effects. There is a risk of dangerously low blood pressure if people take <b>mianserin</b> along with diazoxide, hydralazine, or nitroprusside. <b>Mianserin</b> can make antihistamines and antimuscarinics have stronger effects. <b>Mianserin</b> {{should not be taken}} with apraclonidine, brimonidine, sibutramine, or the combination drug of artemether with lumefantrine.|$|E
50|$|Tetracyclic {{antidepressants}} mirtazapine and <b>mianserin</b> {{are also}} potent α antagonists with mirtazapine being more selective for α2 subtype (~30-fold selective over α1) than <b>mianserin</b> (~17-fold).|$|E
5000|$|<b>Mianserin</b> is not {{approved}} {{for use in}} the United States, but is available in the United Kingdom and other European countries. <b>Mianserin</b> received [...] approval in May 1996 and hence is available in Australia.|$|E
50|$|<b>Mianserin</b> {{may make}} drugs that have {{effects on the}} brain, like alcohol, anxiolytics, {{hypnotics}} and antipsychotics, have stronger effects. It can make antiepileptic medicines work less well. People should not take monoamine oxidase inhibitors and <b>mianserin</b> at the same time.|$|E

50|$|<b>Mianserin</b> is a tetracyclic piperazinoazepine; {{mirtazapine}} {{was developed}} by the same team of organic chemists and differs via addition of a nitrogen atom in one of the rings. (S)-(+)-Mianserin is approximately 200-300 times more active than its enantiomer (R)-(−)-mianserin; hence, the activity of <b>mianserin</b> lies in the (S)-(+) isomer.|$|E
50|$|<b>Mianserin</b> is an antagonist/inverse agonist (at {{most or all}} sites) of the {{histamine}} H1 receptor, serotonin 5-HT1D, 5-HT1F, 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B, 5-HT2C, 5-HT3, 5-HT6, and 5-HT7 receptors, and α1- and α2-adrenergic receptors, and inhibits the reuptake of norepinephrine as well. As an H1 receptor inverse agonist {{with high}} affinity, <b>mianserin</b> has strong antihistamine effects (e.g., sedation). Conversely, it has low affinity for the muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, and hence lacks anticholinergic properties. <b>Mianserin</b> {{has been found to}} be a low affinity but potentially significant partial agonist of the κ-opioid receptor (Ki = 1.7 μM; EC50 = 0.53 μM), similarly to some tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs).|$|E

50|$|<b>Mianserin,</b> {{sold under}} {{the brand name}} Tolvon among others, is an {{atypical}} antidepressant which {{is used in the}} treatment of depression in Europe and elsewhere in the world. It is a tetracyclic antidepressant (TeCA). <b>Mianserin</b> is closely related to mirtazapine, both chemically and in terms of its actions and effects, although there are {{significant differences between the two}} drugs.|$|E
50|$|It was {{chemically}} derived via {{altering the}} chemical {{structure of the}} tetracyclic (atypical) antidepressant, <b>mianserin.</b>|$|E
50|$|Overdose of <b>mianserin</b> {{is known}} to produce sedation, coma, {{hypotension}} or hypertension, tachycardia, and QT interval prolongation.|$|E
5000|$|Antidepressants with a tetracyclic {{structure}} such as <b>mianserin</b> and maprotiline {{were first}} {{developed in the}} 1970s as tetracyclic antidepressants.|$|E
50|$|Setiptiline has a tetracyclic {{structure}} {{and is a}} close analogue of <b>mianserin</b> and mirtazapine, with setiptiline being delta(13b,4a),4a-carba-mianserin, and mirtazapine being 6-azamianserin.|$|E
5000|$|The use of <b>mianserin</b> to {{help people}} with {{schizophrenia}} who are being treated with antipsychotics has been studied in clinical trials; the outcome is unclear.|$|E
5000|$|... α2-blockers {{have found}} medical uses in {{treating}} depression; the tetracyclic antidepressants <b>mianserin</b> and mirtazapine are α2-blockers, although their efficacy as antidepressants {{may come from}} their activity at other receptor sites.|$|E
50|$|<b>Mianserin</b> {{was one of}} {{the first}} {{antidepressants}} to reach the UK market that was less dangerous than the tricyclic antidepressants in overdose; as of 2012 it was not prescribed much in the UK.|$|E
50|$|People {{with severe}} liver disease {{should not take}} <b>mianserin,</b> {{and it should be}} used with caution for people with {{epilepsy}} or who are at risk for seizures, as it can lower the threshold for seizures.|$|E
50|$|Along with mirtazapine, {{although}} to {{a lesser}} extent in comparison, <b>mianserin</b> has sometimes been described as a noradrenergic and specific serotonergic antidepressant (NaSSA). However, the actual evidence in support of this label has been regarded as poor.|$|E
50|$|Abrupt or rapid {{discontinuation}} of <b>mianserin</b> may {{provoke a}} withdrawal, {{the effects of}} which may include depression, anxiety, panic attacks, decreased appetite or anorexia, insomnia, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting, and flu-like symptoms, such as allergies or pruritus, among others.|$|E
50|$|<b>Mianserin</b> is marketed in many {{countries}} mainly under the brand name Tolvon. It is also available throughout the world {{under a variety of}} other brand names including Athymil, Bolvidon, Deprevon, Lantanon, Lerivon, Miansan, Serelan, Tetramide, and Tolvin among others.|$|E
50|$|Mirtazapine is a tetracyclic piperazinoazepine; <b>mianserin</b> was {{developed}} by the same team of organic chemists and mirtazapine differs from it via addition of a nitrogen atom in one of the rings. It is a racemic mixture of enantiomers. The (S)-(+)-enantiomer is known as esmirtazapine.|$|E
50|$|TeCAs have diverse {{pharmacology}} and {{differ from}} TCAs {{in a number}} of ways. With the exception of amoxapine, TeCAs do not inhibit the reuptake of serotonin. However, aside from mirtazapine, they do inhibit the reuptake of norepinephrine. TeCAs block the serotonin 5-HT2 receptors similarly to TCAs. Besides mirtazapine, they also block the α1-adrenergic receptor. Conversely, whereas TCAs have relatively low affinity for the α2-adrenergic receptor, <b>mianserin</b> and mirtazapine potently antagonize this receptor, and this action is thought to be involved in their antidepressant effects. TeCAs block the histamine H1 receptor similarly to the TCAs, but tend to be even stronger antihistamines than TCAs. On the other hand, in contrast to almost all TCAs, TeCAs have only low affinity for the muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, and for this reason, are associated with few or no anticholinergic side effects. <b>Mianserin</b> and mirtazapine are far less toxic than TCAs in overdose.|$|E

50|$|Maprotiline was {{developed}} by Ciba (now operated by Novartis). It was patented in 1966 and was first described in the literature in 1969. The drug was introduced for medical use in 1974. Generics are now widely available. It was introduced after {{most of the other}} TCAs but was the first TeCA to be developed and marketed, with the TeCAs <b>mianserin</b> and amoxapine following shortly thereafter and mirtazapine being introduced later on.|$|E
50|$|Blockade of the H1 and {{possibly}} α1-adrenergic receptors has sedative effects, and also antagonism of the 5-HT2A and α1-adrenergic receptors inhibits activation of intracellular phospholipase C (PLC), {{which seems to}} be a common target for several different classes of antidepressants. By antagonizing the somatodendritic and presynaptic α2-adrenergic receptors which function predominantly as inhibitory autoreceptors and heteroreceptors, <b>mianserin</b> disinhibits the release of norepinephrine, dopamine, serotonin, and acetylcholine in various areas of the brain and body.|$|E
50|$|The {{effectiveness}} of moclobemide in agitated depression {{is equivalent to}} that of imipramine and sedative antidepressants such as amitriptyline, <b>mianserin</b> and maprotiline. The therapeutic response in agitated depressive individuals {{is similar to that}} seen in non-agitated depression; however, a past history of use of antidepressants reduces the chance of successful therapeutic response. The addition of a benzodiazepine to moclobemide therapy has not been found to be of benefit in this population group.|$|E
50|$|A {{large number}} of drugshave been {{associated}} with agranulocytosis, including antiepileptics (such as carbamazepine and valproate), antithyroid drugs (carbimazole, methimazole, and propylthiouracil), antibiotics (penicillin, chloramphenicol and co-trimoxazole), ACE inhibitors (benazepril), cytotoxic drugs, gold, NSAIDs (indomethacin, naproxen, phenylbutazone, metamizole), mebendazole, allopurinol the antidepressants <b>mianserin</b> and mirtazapine, and some antipsychotics (the atypical antipsychotic clozapine in particular).

50|$|Psychopharmacology. Pharmaco-EEG {{studies were}} {{economically}} useful in clinically classifying new agents, dosage ranges and durations of effects, and separating active from inactive substances. The list of successful applications is extensive; some specific examples are {{the identification of}} <b>mianserin</b> (GB-94) and doxepin as antidepressants of the imipramine class; of the inactivity of flutroline as a proposed antipsychotic in man despite activity in dogs; and of equivalent EEG activity of the laevo and dextro enantiomers of 6-azamianserin (mirtazapine) despite differences in preclinical trials.|$|E
50|$|Of {{the mood}} {{stabilizers}} studied, valproate semisodium may ameliorate depression, interpersonal problems, and anger. Lamotrigine may reduce impulsivity and anger; topiramate may ameliorate interpersonal problems, impulsivity, anxiety, anger, and general psychiatric pathology. The effect of carbamazepine was not significant. Of the antidepressants, amitriptyline may reduce depression, but <b>mianserin,</b> fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, and phenelzine sulfate showed no effect. Omega-3 fatty acid may ameliorate suicidality and improve depression. As of 2017, trials with these medications {{had not been}} replicated {{and the effect of}} long-term use had not been assessed.|$|E
