40|$|The {{extinction}} {{probability of}} a branching process (a neutron chain in a <b>multiplying</b> <b>medium)</b> is calculated for a system randomly varying in time. The evolution {{of the first two}} moments of such a process was calculated previously by the authors in a system randomly shifting between two states of different multiplication properties. The same model is used here for the investigation of the extinction probability. It is seen that the determination of the extinction probability is significantly more complicated than that of the moments, and it can only be achieved by pure numerical methods. The numerical results indicate that for systems fluctuating between two subcritical or two supercritical states, the extinction probability behaves as expected, but for systems fluctuating between a supercritical and a subcritical state, there is a crucial and unexpected deviation from the predicted behaviour. The results bear some significance not only for neutron chains in a <b>multiplying</b> <b>medium,</b> but also for the evolution of biological populations in a time-varying environment...|$|E

Analytical transport results are often used as benchmarks or in pedagogical settings. Benchmark problems in infinite homogeneous media have been studied continually, beginning with the monograph by Case, DeHoffmann, and Placzek. A fundamental problem considered in this work is the Green`s function in an infinite medium. The Green`s function problem considers an infinite planar source emitting neutral particles in the single directions`. Recently, this Green`s function {{has been used to}} obtain solutions for finite media. These solutions, which hinge on accurate and fast evaluation of the infinite medium Green`s function, use Fourier and Laplace transform inversion techniques for the evaluation. Until now, only absorbing media have been considered, and applications were therefore limited to non-multiplying media. In an effort to relax this limitation, the infinite medium Green`s function is numerically evaluated for an infinite <b>multiplying</b> <b>medium</b> using the double-sided Laplace transform inversion.

40|$|The zero-power {{reactor noise}} theory {{in a steady}} neutron <b>multiplying</b> <b>medium</b> was {{extended}} recently to a medium randomly varying in time to bridge the fields of the zero-power and the power reactor noise. For a time-varying medium in which the transition probability randomly fluctuates, only {{the use of the}} probability generating function technique based on the forward master equation approach is practical. However, with the forward master equation approach, the treatment of the joint moments of the neutron number and the medium state leads to a closure problem.

40|$|The master {{equation}} approach, {{which has}} traditionally been used for the calculation of neutron fluctuations in multiplying systems with constant parameters, is extended to a case when {{the parameters of the}} system change randomly in time.

40|$|Neutron {{fluctuations}} {{in a constant}} <b>multiplying</b> <b>medium</b> (zero power noise) and those in a fluctuating medium (power reactor noise) have been traditionally considered as two separate disciplines that exist in two opposing limiting areas of operation (low and high power, respectively). They have also been treated by different mathematical methods, i. e., master equations and Langevin equation, respectively. In this paper we develop a theory of neutron {{fluctuations in}} a medium randomly varying in time, based on a forward-type master equation approach. This method accounts for both the zero power and the power reactor noise simultaneously. Factorial moments and related quantities (variance, power spectrum, etc.) {{of the number of}} the neutrons are calculated in subcritical systems with a stationary external source. It is shown that the pure zero power and power reactor noise results can be reconstructed in the cases of vanishing system fluctuations and high power, respectively, the latter being a nontrivial result. Further, it is shown that the effect of system fluctuations on the zero power noise is retained even in the limit of vanishing neutron number (reactor power). The results have thus even practical significance for low-power systems with fluctuating properties. The results also have a bearing on other types of branching processes such as evolution of biological systems, germ colonies, epidemics, etc., which take place in a time-varying environment...|$|E
40|$|For {{the purpose}} of {{studying}} a heterogeneous <b>multiplying</b> <b>medium,</b> the author proposes dividing it {{into a number of}} homogeneous regions having the diffusion and absorption properties of the pure moderator. The fuel elements, represented by portions of active surfaces of zero thickness, constitute the separation surfaces of these sub-regions. Externally, the system is bounded by passive surfaces devoid of fissionable nuclei. The theory of diffusion involving several groups of neutrons is applied to each sub-region, while the productive and absorbing effects of fissionable materials are represented by the conditions on the active surfaces. To apply the method, it is necessary to know certain parameters of the behaviour of an active surface in a known flux. The moderator group constants are presumed to be known. The author shows that, theoretically, a single exponential experiment, carried out with {{a very small number of}} rods, should suffice to determine these parameters experimentally. The facility used for these experiments is a subcritical assembly; the fuel is uranium oxide containing 1. 8 % uranium 235; a water moderator is used. Measurements made for a series of different configurations confirm that the parameters sought depend solely on the nature of the fuel. The results are used to forecast the behaviour of a subcritical and a critical lattice.

40|$|Graduation date: 2005 Benchmark {{calculations}} {{are performed}} for neutron transport in a two material (binary) stochastic <b>multiplying</b> <b>medium.</b> Spatial, angular, and energy dependence are included. The problem considered {{is based on}} a fuel assembly of a common pressurized water nuclear reactor. The mean chord length through the assembly is determined and used as the planar geometry system length. According to assumed or calculated material distributions, this system length is populated with alternating fuel and moderator segments of random size. Neutron flux distributions are numerically computed using a discretized form of the Boltzmann transport equation employing diffusion synthetic acceleration. Average quantities (group fluxes and k-eigenvalue) and variances are calculated from an ensemble of realizations of the mixing statistics. The effects of varying two parameters in the fuel, two different boundary conditions, and three different sets of mixing statistics are assessed. A probability distribution function (PDF) of the k-eigenvalue is generated and compared with previous research. Atomic mix solutions are compared with these benchmark ensemble average flux and k-eigenvalue solutions. Mixing statistics with large standard deviations give the most widely varying ensemble solutions of the flux and k-eigenvalue. The shape of the k-eigenvalue PDF qualitatively agrees with previous work. Its overall shape is independent of variations in fuel cross-sections for the problems considered, but its width is impacted by these variations. Statistical distributions with smaller standard deviations alter the shape of this PDF toward a normal distribution. The atomic mix approximation yields large over-predictions of the ensemble average k-eigenvalue and under-predictions of the flux. Qualitatively correct flux shapes are obtained, however. These benchmark calculations indicate that a model which includes higher statistical moments of the mixing statistics is needed for accurate predictions of binary stochastic media k-eigenvalue problems. This is consistent with previous findings...|$|E

40|$|The {{signals of}} fission {{chambers}} are usually evaluated {{with the help}} of the co-called Campbelling techniques. These are based on the Campbell theorem, which states that if the primary incoming events, generating the detector pulses, are independent, then relationships exist between the moments of various orders of the signal in the current mode. This gives the possibility to determine the mean value of the intensity of the detection events, which is proportional to the static flux, from the higher moments of the detector current, which has certain advantages. However, the main application area of fission chambers is measurements in power reactors where, as is well known, the individual detection events are not independent, due to the branching character of the neutron chains (neutron multiplication). Therefore it is of interest to extend the Campbelling-type theory for the case of correlated neutron events. Such a theory could address two questions: partly, to investigate the bias when the traditional Campbell techniques are used for correlated incoming events; and partly, to see whether the correlation properties of the detection events, which carry information on the <b>multiplying</b> <b>medium,</b> could be extracted from the measurements. This paper is devoted to the investigation of these questions. The results show that there is a potential possibility to extract the same information from fission chamber signals in the current mode as with the Rossi- or Feynman-alpha methods, or from coincidence and multiplicity measurements, which so far have required detectors working in the pulse mode. It is also shown that application of the standard Campbelling techniques to neutron detection in multiplying systems does not lead to an error for estimating the stationary flux as long as the detector is calibrated in in situ measurements...|$|E

The aim of the experiment was to develop new measurement techniques specific to ADSs and to test the performances of neutronic calculations codes for such systems. The interpretation of the MUSE- 4 experiment has shown that the physical parameters of the system are globally well reproduced by calculations performed with the ERANOS code system, which proves good agreement with both the measurements and the reference Monte Carlo calculations; this concerns the critical mass, the delayed neutron fraction, the fission rate shapes, and the spectral indices. This is a particularly remarkable issue for ERANOS and its associated libraries, which had never been tested for such situations. Concerning the nuclear data, JEF-based cross sections provide a better agreement on critical mass than other libraries. A sensitivity of several measured parameters to the elastic and inelastic cross section of lead have been demonstrated, and possible biases on these cross sections have been indicated.
