This natural reference fails to account for the ontological practice premised on African belief system which reconciles the natural and spiritual aspects of human existence. The study adopts the analytic approach in philosophy which evolves a clarification of the ontological concept within the African context.

40|$|One {{commonly}} used strategy in charitable fundraising is sharing names and contact information of donors between organizations, even those whose missions are unrelated. The efficacy of this <b>practice</b> <b>hinges</b> <b>on</b> {{the existence of}} "giving types," that is, a positive correlation {{at the individual level}} between giving to one organization and to another. We run an experiment using a non-student sample (an artifactual field experiment) in which participants have the opportunity to donate to multiple charitable organizations. We examine the relationship between giving to one organization and giving to another. Our results support the existence of a giving type; a factor analysis demonstrates that giving decisions are driven by a single (unique) factor, and individuals who give to one organization, give significantly more to other organizations than do non-donors. Our results have important implications for the economics of charity and for fundraising practice. Charitable Giving Public Goods Field Experiment Preference Stability Social Preferences...|$|R
40|$|Access to and {{diffusion}} of {{information relating to}} the Terrorism Finance Tracking Programme (TFTP) has become {{a focal point for}} discussions about secrecy and democracy in the European Union. This paper analyses the dynamics of secrecy and publicity in the context of post- 9 / 11 security programmes, in particular, the TFTP. Far from a binary between secrecy and transparency, the TFTP involves complex dynamics of knowledge, and strictly regulated information distribution. The purpose of the article is threefold. First, we contribute to debates on EU secrecy and democratic oversight, by advancing an understanding of secrecy as practice. Second, we document and discuss the longer trajectory of the contested secrecy and publicity of the TFTP, through examining three ‘secrecy controversies’. Third, we ask whether the logics of secrecy in the EU are being revised and challenged in the context of transatlantic security cooperation. The rationales of secrecy deployed in security <b>practice</b> <b>hinge</b> <b>on</b> particular notions of potential future harm that, we argue, are shifting in the face of current understandings of the terrorist threat...|$|R
40|$|Achieving {{privacy in}} verifiable {{computation}} with multiple servers – without FHE and without pre-processing Cloud services provide a powerful resource to which weak clients may outsource their computation. While tremendously useful, {{they come with}} their own security challenges. One of the fundamental issues in cloud computation is: how does a client efficiently verify the correctness of computation performed on an untrusted server? Furthermore, how can the client be assured that the server learns nothing about its private inputs? With the ever-increasing usage of cloud computation in practice, {{it is not surprising}} that the area of verifiable (or delegatable) computation, that addresses precisely these questions, has generated wide-spread interest in the cryptography community. In recent years, a number of proposals have been made for constructing verifiable computation protocols. Unfortunately, solutions that guarantee privacy of inputs (in addition to the correctness of computation) rely on the use of fully homomorphic encryption (FHE). An unfortunate consequence of this dependence on FHE, is that all hope of making verifiable computation implementable in <b>practice</b> <b>hinges</b> <b>on</b> the challenge of making FHE deployable in practice.

In the context of the changing health landscape, an integrated approach to service provision has taken precedence. For this, strengthening health workforce competencies is an imperative, and doing so in <b>practice</b> <b>hinges</b> <b>on</b> the oversight and steering function of governance. To aid health system stewards in their governing role, this review seeks to provide an overview of processes, tools and actors for strengthening health workforce competencies. It draws from a purposive and multidisciplinary review of literature, expert opinion and country initiatives across the WHO European Region's 53 Member States. Through our analysis, we observe distinct yet complementary roles can be differentiated between health services delivery and the health system. This understanding is a necessary prerequisite to gain deeper insight into the specificities for strengthening health workforce competencies in order for governance to rightly create the institutional environment called for to foster alignment. Differentiating between the contribution of health services and the health system in the strengthening of health workforce competencies is an important distinction for achieving and sustaining health improvement goals...|$|R
40|$|The use of {{large-scale}} antenna systems in future commercial wireless communications is an emerging technology that uses {{an excess of}} transmit antennas to realize high spectral efficiency. Achieving potential gains with large-scale antenna arrays in <b>practice</b> <b>hinges</b> <b>on</b> sufficient channel estimation accuracy. Much prior work focuses on TDD based networks, relying on reciprocity between the uplink and downlink channels. However, most currently deployed commercial wireless systems are FDD based, {{making it difficult to}} exploit channel reciprocity. In massive MIMO FDD systems, the problem of channel estimation becomes even more challenging due to the attendant substantial training resources and feedback requirements which scale with the number of antennas. In this paper, we consider the problem of training sequence design that employs a set of training signals and its mapping to the training periods. We focus on reduced-dimension training sequence designs, along with transmit precoder designs, aimed at reducing both hardware complexity and power consumption. The resulting designs are extended to hybrid analog-digital beamforming systems, which employ a limited number of active RF chains for transmit precoding, by applying the Toeplitz distribution theorem to large-scale linear antenna systems. A practical guideline for training sequence parameter selection is presented along with performance analysis. Comment: 16 pages, 9 figures, replaced with revised versio...|$|R
40|$|Chronic lower {{urinary tract}} {{symptoms}} (LUTS), such as urgency and incontinence, are common, {{especially among the}} elderly, but their etiology is often obscure. Recent studies of acute urinary tract infections implicated invasion by Escherichia coli into the cytoplasm of urothelial cells, with persistence of long-term bacterial reservoirs, but the role of infection in chronic LUTS is unknown. We conducted a large prospective study with eligible patients with LUTS and controls over a 3 -year period, comparing routine urine cultures of planktonic bacteria with cultures of shed urothelial cells concentrated in centrifuged urinary sedi-ments. This comparison revealed large numbers of bacteria undetected by routine cultures. Next, we typed the bacterial species cultured from patient and control sediments under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions, {{and we found that}} the two groups had complex but significantly distinct profiles of bacteria associated with their shed bladder epithelial cells. Strikingly, E. coli, the organismmost responsible for acute urinary tract infections, was not the only or even the main offending pathogen in this more-chronic condition. Antibiotic protection assays with shed patient cells and in vitro infection studies using patient-derived strains in cell culture suggested that LUTS-associated bacteria are within or extremely closely associated with shed epithelial cells, which explains how routine cultures might fail to detect them. These data have strong implications for the need to rethink our common diagnoses and treatments of chronic urinary tract symptoms.

40|$|Tightly {{integrating}} {{modeling and}} simulation techniques into Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL) practices {{can be one of}} the driving factors behind a successful and cost-effective capacity management effort for any Information Technology (IT) system. ITIL is a best practices framework for managing IT infrastructure, development and operations. Translating ITIL theory into operational reality can be a challenge. This paper aims to highlight how to best integrate {{modeling and simulation}} into an ITIL implementation. For cases where the project team initially has difficulty gaining consensus on investing in modeling and simulation resources, a clear definition for M&S implementation into the ITIL framework, specifically its role in supporting Capacity Management, is critical to gaining the support required to garner these resources. This implementation should also help to clearly define M&S support to the overall system mission. This paper will describe the development of an integrated modeling approach and how best to tie M&S to definitive goals for evaluating system capacity and performance requirements. Specifically the paper will discuss best practices for implementing modeling and simulation into ITIL. These <b>practices</b> <b>hinge</b> <b>on</b> implementing integrated M&S methods that 1) encompass at least two or more predictive modeling techniques, 2) complement each one's respective strengths and weaknesses to support the validation of predicted results, and 3) are tied to the system's performance and workload monitoring efforts. How to structure two forms of modeling: statistical and simUlation in the development of "As Is" and "To Be" efforts will be used to exemplify the integrated M&S methods. The paper will show how these methods can better support the project's overall capacity management efforts...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Foreclosures of single-family {{mortgages}} {{have increased}} dramatically {{in many parts}} of the US in recent years. Much of this has been tied to the rise of higher-risk subprime mortgage lending. Debates concerning mortgage regulation, as well as around other residential finance policies and <b>practices,</b> <b>hinge</b> critically <b>on</b> the social as well as personal costs of loan default and foreclosure. This paper examines the impact of foreclosures of single-family mortgages on levels of violent and property crime at the neighborhood level. Using data on foreclosures, neighborhood characteristics, and crime, the study found that higher foreclosure levels do contribute to higher levels of violent crime. The results for property crime are not statistically significant. A standard deviation increase in the foreclosure rate (about 2. 8 foreclosures for every 100 owner-occupied properties in one year) corresponds to an increase in neighborhood violent crime of approximately 6. 7 per cent. The policy implications of these findings are discussed. KEY WORDS: Foreclosures, subprime loans, mortgages, crim...|$|R

Interrogation of risk management conceptualization, provisions and mechanisms in schools becomes of particular interest. In this study, we argue that schools continue to do business as usual {{in the absence of}} policies, mechanisms and <b>practices</b> <b>hinged</b> <b>on</b> management of risk. The study focused on participantsâ€™ conceptualization of risk management, provisions and mechanisms in place, and challenges faced. The study of seven secondary schools in the Gweru Urban district, involved School Development Committee/Association chairpersons, school heads and deputy heads, and an official from provincial education office, all purposively selected as information- rich participants by virtue of positions they occupied. Informed by the post-positivist mixed methods paradigm, interview, questionnaire and observation methods were used to collect both quantitative and qualitative data. Analysis of quantitative data employed descriptive statistics (numbers [N] and corresponding Percentages [%]), while qualitative data were analysed using a thematic approach identifying patterns that emerged from the data, and enriched quantitative evidence. Findings indicated that schools were generally not risk-prepared. Evidence showed a poor, uninformed conceptualisation of risk management, which consequently did not appear as a priority during planning; there was general lack of awareness of potential risk areas in the schools coupled with a lack of policies and installation of mechanisms geared at managing risk, which, in some cases, placed lives of stakeholders at risk. The state of risk management in schools studied calls for deliberate preparation of risk management manuals and training efforts for school management personnel and parent members of the SDC/SDA structures. Such efforts could focus on risk management in terms of safety, emergency procedures, financial procedures, security of premises, and assets...|$|R
40|$|SummaryOne {{widely used}} measure of {{familial}} aggregation is the sibling recurrence-risk ratio, which {{is defined as}} the ratio of risk of disease manifestation, given that one's sibling is affected, as compared with the disease prevalence in the general population. Known as λS, it has been used extensively in the mapping of complex diseases. In this paper, I show that, for a fictitious disease that is strictly nongenetic and nonenvironmental, λS can be dramatically inflated because of misunderstanding of the original definition of λS, ascertainment bias, and overreporting. Therefore, for a disease of entirely environmental origin, the λS inflation due to ascertainment bias and/or overreporting is expected to be more prominent if the risk factor also is familially aggregated. This suggests that, like segregation analysis, the estimation of λS also is prone to ascertainment bias and should be performed with great care. This is particularly important if one uses λS for exclusion mapping, for discrimination between different genetic models, and for association studies, since these <b>practices</b> <b>hinge</b> tightly <b>on</b> an accurate estimation of λS...|$|R

Ex-isting dynamic verification tools for MPI programs suffer from exponential sched-ule explosion, especially when multiple non-deterministic receive statements are issued by a process. In this paper, we focus on detecting message-orphaning deadlocks within MPI programs. For this analysis target, we describe a sound heuristic that helps avoid schedule explosion in most practical cases while not missing deadlocks in <b>practice.</b> Our method <b>hinges</b> <b>on</b> initially computing the po-tential non-deterministic matches as conventional dynamic analyzers do, but then including only the entries which are found relevant to cause a refusal deadlock (essentially a macroscopic-view persistent-set reduction technique).

The effectiveness of the partitioning approach is demonstrated on both proprietary industrial designs as well as public benchmark circuits.

40|$|In this {{prospective}} study among 208 high-risk patients with suspected ectopic pregnancy, the diagnostic value of transvaginal sonography and serum human chorionic gonadotrophin (HCG) measurements were analysed in detail. The {{absence of an}} intra-uterine gestational sac obviously was the most constant sonographic finding among patients with ectopic pregnancy (n = 89), with a very high sensitivity (0. 99) but a low specificity (0. 41). The application of different HCG cut-off levels improved specificity to 1. 00 for values exceeding 4500 IU/l. Clinical utility obviously decreased, as many patients presented with HCG values well below this level. The additional effect of adnexal findings was analysed. Sonographic identification of an ectopic pregnancy was very specific (0. 99) but had low sensitivity (0. 56) because many ectopics were not detected. The additional effect of HCG values on these results was minor. The low HCG cut-off levels advocated in recent studies are questioned {{by the results of}} our analysis: whereas the combined use of sonography and HCG measurements is shown to be of great benefit, the limitations are also documented, underlining the need for re-evaluation at intervals of patients with low HCG values. The question of which cut-off level should be used in <b>practice,</b> however, <b>hinges</b> <b>on</b> a difficult choice between a certain specificity and clinical utilit...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to {{describe}} and examine the continuum of processes around the creation of works of art, by developing a methodology sensitive to the particularity of these elements, {{in order to preserve}} their vitality and function in the overall ecosystem of ongoing artistic <b>practice.</b> The thesis <b>hinges</b> <b>on</b> the proposition that the process leading to a completed work of art draws on a multitude of elements from the context in which it was created; such a process should not be viewed separately from the everyday experiences it is embedded in. It then follows that in order to provide an accurate document of artistic practice, this wider context around finalised and exhibited works of art constitutes {{an integral part of the}} data set under consideration. The idea is to write about art while maintaining intimacy with the work and, indeed, to feed directly back into that process of creation. The thesis highlights the particular value of an ongoing art practice that includes reflection upon and discussion of work and making, in that these more explicit undertakings coexist with and respect the fragile balance of the creative process. The creative practice proposed in this thesis is permeable to the everyday actualities that surround it. Although this is not relevant or useful to every artist, a cohort of artists in various media, writers and film-makers can be seen to fit such a model, and their work forms the central body of evidence examined in the thesis, together with evidence provided by the author’s own artistic practice...|$|R
