50|$|When the alloys for piping are forged, {{metallurgical}} {{tests are}} performed to determine material composition by % of each chemical {{element in the}} piping, {{and the results are}} recorded in a Material Test Report (MTR). These tests can be used to prove that the alloy conforms to various specifications (e.g. 316 SS). The tests are stamped by the mill's QA/QC department and can be used to trace the material back to the mill by future users, such as piping and fitting manufacturers. Maintaining the traceability between the alloy material and associated MTR is an important quality assurance issue. QA often requires the heat number to be written on the pipe. Precautions must also be taken to prevent the introduction of counterfeit materials. As a backup to etching/labeling of the <b>material</b> <b>identification</b> on the pipe, positive <b>material</b> <b>identification</b> (PMI) is performed using a handheld device; the device scans the pipe material using an emitted electromagnetic wave (x-ray fluorescence/XRF) and receives a reply that is spectrographically analyzed.|$|E

50|$|While these theorists all {{contributed to}} the theory of {{constitutive}} rhetoric, James Boyd White was the first to coin the term. In 1985, he explained that the term “constitutive rhetoric” described rhetoric that called a common, collective identity into existence. White wrote that persuasion and identification occur only when audiences already understand and relate to method and content. Thus, speech happens within culture, and speakers adapt messages to reflect the ideas and views of a community. When speeches address a diverse crowd as though they are of one community, White describes this as “calling identity into being” through <b>material</b> <b>identification.</b>|$|E
50|$|Forensic {{materials}} engineering, {{a branch}} of forensic engineering, focuses on the material evidence from crime or accident scenes, seeking defects in those materials which might explain why an accident occurred, or {{the source of a}} specific material to identify a criminal. Many analytical methods used for <b>material</b> <b>identification</b> may be used in investigations, the exact set being determined {{by the nature of the}} material in question, be it metal, glass, ceramic, polymer or composite. An important aspect is the analysis of trace evidence such as skid marks on exposed surfaces, where contact between dissimilar materials leaves material traces of one left on the other. Provided the traces can be analysed successfully, then an accident or crime can often be reconstructed. Another aim will be to determine the cause of a broken component using the technique of fractography.|$|E

50|$|The first {{seizures}} {{of nuclear}} or otherwise radioactive material {{were reported in}} Switzerland and Italy in 1991.

Nuclear forensics relies on making these determinations through measurable parameters including, but not limited to chemical impurities, isotopic composition, microscopic appearance, and microstructure.

5000|$|Health-related work {{continued}} to be a focus at Pacific Northwest well into the 1980s. Researchers introduced the first portable blood irradiator, which was used in leukemia treatments. The manufacture and delivery of the irradiators and the development of safer, more effective protocols occurred between the Laboratory and Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center. It was Pacific Northwest's first Cooperative Research and Development Agreement. In the mid-1980s, Pacific Northwest became one of the U.S. Department of Energy’s multiprogram laboratories. In the 1990s, the Laboratory’s scientific reputation began to garner more attention on a global and national scale, beginning with its name. In 1995, the Laboratory officially added [...] "National" [...] to its name, becoming the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory. The Laboratory’s global environmental and nuclear nonproliferation work moved to the forefront during the 1990s. The Pacific Northwest Center for Global Security was established to coordinate nuclear nonproliferation programs, research and policy work within the Laboratory and throughout the region. The <b>Material</b> <b>Identification</b> System and the Ultrasonic Pulse Echo instrument, technologies developed at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, were provided to customs inspectors in Eastern Europe and former Soviet Union republics to reduce smuggling and terrorism.

40|$|In this paper, {{we develop}} a novel {{approach}} to object <b>material</b> <b>identification</b> in spectral imaging by combining the use of invariant spectral absorption features and statistical machine learning techniques. Our method hinges in the relevance of spectral absorption features for <b>material</b> <b>identification</b> and casts the problem into a pattern recognition setting by making use of an invariant representation of the most discriminant band-segments in the spectra. Thus, here, we view the identification problem as a classification task, which is effected based upon those invariant absorption segments in the spectra which are most discriminative between the materials under study. To robustly recover those bands that are most relevant to the identification process, we make use of discriminant learning. To illustrate the utility of our method for purposes of <b>material</b> <b>identification,</b> we perform experiments on both terrestrial and remotely sensed hyperspectral imaging data and compare our results to those yielded by an alternative...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} tomographic capabilities for the Nuclear <b>Materials</b> <b>Identification</b> System (NMIS). The tomographic capabilities add weapons component {{spatial and}} material properties information {{that result in}} a more detailed item signature (template) and provide more information for physical attributes analyses. The Nuclear <b>Materials</b> <b>Identification</b> System (NMIS) is used routinely to confirm the identity of HEU components in sealed containers. It does this through a radiation signature acquired by shining a {sup 252 }Cf source through the container and measuring the radiation at four detectors stacked vertically on the other side. This measurement gives a gamma and neutron radiation transmission profile of the weapons component, mixed with the radiation production due to the induced fissions in the fissile materials. This information is sufficient to match an &#x 27;&#x 27;unknown&#x 27;&#x 27; weapons component signature to a template signature from a reference item when measuring under controlled conditions. Tomography measures the interior of an item by making transmission measurements from all angles around the item, whereas NMIS makes the measurements from a single angle. Figure 1 is a standard example of tomographic reconstruction, the Shepp-Logan human brain phantom. The measured quantity is attenuation so high values (white) are highly attenuating areas...|$|R
