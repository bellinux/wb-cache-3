An {{equivalent}} analysis {{model for}} engine powertrain mounting system is built with the FEA software ANSYS, {{in which the}} engine powertrain is equivalent to a composite body of one inertial body and one elastic body, every <b>mounting</b> <b>component</b> is simplified as one spring along its three principal elastic axes and the powertrain mass and rotational inertia are accurately embodied.

40|$|The {{object of}} the {{invention}} is a semiconductor component for the measurement of ion concentrations, in particular and ISFET (ion-sensitive field effect transistor). The semiconductor component consists of a substrate {{and a series of}} layers arranged on its front side, whereby the component has one or several ion- sensitive layers and possibly additional series of layers which are arranged in a thinned area of the substrate on the rear side. The ion-sensitive layer is formed as the gate of a field effect transistor or as the electrode of a capacitor or a diode. The contact terminals on the electronic components can be attached by <b>mounting</b> <b>component</b> exclusively on its front side. The geometric arrangement of the ion-sensitive membrane and the contacts permit a simple and reliable encapsulation of the semiconductor component which protects defined chip areas from electrolytic attack. The semiconductor component is adapted into a support for encapsulation, said support being coated with con ductors which are electrically connected to the electrical terminals of the semiconductor component. The support is designed so that the surface of the semiconductor component is fully covered on the front side by chemically resistant materials. The arrangement of a control gate in the series of layers arranged on the front side permits simple component drift correctio...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In {{the working}} {{process of the}} two way {{cartridge}} valve, deformation and stress are generated by {{the effect of the}} changed internal fluid pressures. In this process, the flow of the liquid flowing through the cross section also changes with it. To analyse the stress and deformation distributions of the cartridge valve under the different pressures and the flow analysis in different flow rates and different pressures, finite element method has been used in this paper for analysis and calculation in order to find the structure weak part, the instable flow rate region and the part which hinder the flow rate increased. The results show that: the phenomenon of stress concentration significantly existed in the opening part on the outlet side of the two-way cartridge valve. Under the maximum operating pressure (the maximum working pressure is 31. 5 MPa, the maximum flow rate is 4500 L / min), the deformation was larger in the part of girdle. There was nearly no deformation on the upside of the valve body and the stress was less. So, the valve body was the redundant part of two-way cartridge valves. The instable flow rate region was located in the region of the two-way cartridge valve opening across. In the junction of the export of plug-in <b>mounting</b> <b>component</b> and the plug-in mounting block, the flow of liquid was impeded because of its much block and angular structure. The analysis results above have laid a theoretical foundation for the fatigue strength analysis and structural optimization of two-way cartridge valves...|$|E

40|$|Internal {{combustion}} engines {{are used in}} many applications. The same engine type may have different <b>components</b> <b>mounted</b> to it depending upon its use. These engine <b>mounted</b> <b>components</b> need to be designed against fatigue in order to withstand the engine vibrations. Measured engine vibrations are commonly used as input data for fatigue estimation. The focus in this thesis is set on heavy-duty diesel engines, typically used in trucks, buses and industrial applications. All of the appended papers use engine vibration measurements to evaluate the proposed methods. In Paper A, the engine block motion is described with a seven degree of freedom kinematic model. These degrees of freedom consist of six rigid body modes and one assumed twisting degree of freedom. With this description, measured engine block vibrations {{can be used to}} accurately predict the vibration in positions that have not been measured. Relating the measured vibrations of an engine <b>mounted</b> <b>component</b> with the projected motion of the engine block at that same position, makes it possible to identify local dynamic phenomena. In Paper B, the kinematic model of Paper A is extended with three assumed bending deformation mode shapes. For the current engine type, all of the assumed deformation modes are ranked within the 10 - 300 Hz frequency range. The deformation mode of highest importance is the engine block twist. Including bending deformation increases the accuracy of the engine block vibration description but it also increases the demands on instrumentation. In Paper C, the possibility to modify measured engine vibration signals, for addition or removal of engine <b>mounted</b> <b>components,</b> is investigated. For this purpose, engine vibration measurements were performed with and without a 29 kg brake air compressor mounted to the engine. For the task of removing the effect that this engine <b>mounted</b> <b>component</b> has on the engine block, the two cases of knowing, and not knowing the vibration of the component are both considered. The proposed methodology successfully predicts the changes in engine vibration due to system modification. The proposed method {{can also be used to}} estimate the time response of a component's centre of gravity. In this study the component's dynamic properties are derived from measurements but they could also be produced using finite element analysis. This can be useful early in the design process to find critically stressed areas due to base excitation. QC 20171222 </p...|$|R

40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 28 - 31, 1996 / Town and Country Hotel and Convention Center, San Diego, CaliforniaEutectic (63 % tin- 37 % lead) or near-eutectic (40 % tin- 60 % lead) tin-lead solder {{is widely}} used for {{creating}} electrical interconnections between the printed wiring board (PWB) and the <b>components</b> <b>mounted</b> on the board surface. For <b>components</b> <b>mounted</b> directly on the PWB mounting pads, that is, surface <b>mounted</b> <b>components,</b> the tin-lead solder also constitutes the mechanical interconnection. Eutectic solder has a melting point of 183 °C (361 °F). It is {{important to realize that}} its homologous temperature, defined as the temperature in degrees Kelvin over its melting point temperature (T(m)), also in degrees Kelvin, is defined as T/T(m). At room temperature (25 °C = 298 K), eutectic solder's homologous temperature is 0. 65. It is widely acknowledged that materials having a homologous temperature ≥ 0. 5 are readily subject to creep, and the solder joints of printed wiring assemblies are routinely exposed to temperatures above room temperature. Hence, solder joints tend to be subject to both thermal fatigue and creep. This can lead to premature failures during service conditions. The geometry, that is, the lead configuration, of the joints can also affect failure. Various geometries are better suited to withstand failure than others.
