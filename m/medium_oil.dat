2500|$|Petroleum is used mostly, by volume, for {{producing}} fuel oil and gasoline, both important [...] "primary energy" [...] sources. 84 {{percent by volume}} of the hydrocarbons present in petroleum is converted into energy-rich fuels (petroleum-based fuels), including gasoline, diesel, jet, heating, and other fuel oils, and liquefied petroleum gas. The lighter grades of crude oil produce the best yields of these products, but as the world's reserves of light and <b>medium</b> <b>oil</b> are depleted, oil refineries are increasingly having to process heavy oil and bitumen, and use more complex and expensive methods to produce the products required. Because heavier crude oils have too much carbon and not enough hydrogen, these processes generally involve removing carbon from or adding hydrogen to the molecules, and using fluid catalytic cracking to convert the longer, more complex molecules in the oil to the shorter, simpler ones in the fuels.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This {{research}} {{was performed to}} assess the alterations in fatty acid profiles for hammour fish fillets lipid and refined sunflower (RSF) <b>oil,</b> frying <b>oil</b> <b>medium</b> and to evaluate the formation extent of some harmful compounds including malonaldehyde, polar compounds, oxidized and trans fatty acids in the former lipids throughout intermittent deep-fat frying process. The obtained results revealed that intermittent frying process caused a significant alteration in the fatty acid profiles of hammour fish lipid and frying <b>oil</b> <b>medium</b> due to the exchange of lipid occurs throughout frying process between frying <b>oil</b> <b>medium</b> and fried fish lipid and to the oxidative degradation of unsaturated and some saturated long chain fatty acids resulting {{in the formation of}} saturated short and medium chain fatty acids. In addition, the intermittent frying conditions encouraged the formation of tested harmful compounds in hammour fish fillets and RSF oil at exceptional high levels, especially with extending the repeating use period of frying <b>oil</b> <b>medium.</b> Therefore, the present results are recommended that the repeating use period of frying <b>oil</b> <b>medium</b> throughout intermittent frying process should not exceed 16 hours to avoid the formation of harmful compounds in fried foods and frying <b>oil</b> <b>medium</b> at hazardous and toxic levels.

50|$|Most of the Gulf Coast {{refineries}} {{have the}} capacity to process very heavy crude oils from Venezuela and Mexico. However, exports from those countries has been declining in recent years, and more of Venezuela's exports are going to other countries, notably China. US domestic oil production has been increasing since 2010 due to horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing in tight oil fields, notably the Eagle Ford Formation of Texas. Some Gulf Coast refineries have completely replaced imported light and <b>medium</b> <b>oil</b> with new Texas tight oil. Unfortunately, most of it is too light for the Gulf refineries. Much new US tight oil is being exported to Canada for use as oil sands diluent and returning in blends which are a better feedstock for heavy oil refineries.|$|E

5000|$|De Kooning’s {{well-known}} Woman series, {{begun in}} 1950 (after meeting his future wife) and culminating in Woman VI, owes much to Picasso, not {{least in the}} aggressive, penetrative breaking apart of the figure, and the spaces around it. Picasso’s late works show signs that he, in turn, saw images of works by Pollock and de Kooning.De Kooning led the 1950s art world into a new movement known as American abstract expressionism. “From 1940 to the present, Woman has manifested herself in de Kooning’s paintings and drawings as at once the focus of desire, frustration, inner conflict, pleasure, … and as posing problems of conception and handling as demanding as those of an engineer.” [...] The female figure is an important symbol for de Kooning’s art career and his own life. The Woman painting is considered as a significant work of art for the museum through its historical context about the post-World War II history and American feminist movement. Additionally, the <b>medium</b> (<b>oil,</b> enamel, and charcoal on canvas) of this painting makes it different from others of de Kooning’s time.|$|E
5000|$|At {{the end of}} World War I, Kanae Yamamoto {{proposed}} {{an overhaul of the}} Japanese education system. He thought that it had been geared too much towards uncritical absorption of information by imitation and wanted to promote a less restraining system, a vision he expounded in his book Theory of self-expression which described the Jiyu-ga method, [...] "learning without a teacher". Teachers Rinzo Satake and his brother-in-law Shuku Sasaki read Yamamoto's work and became fanatical supporters. They became keen to implement his ideas by replacing the many hours Japanese children had to spend drawing ideograms with black Indian ink with free drawing hours, filled with as much color as possible. For this, they decided to produce an improved wax crayon and in 1921 founded the Sakura Cray-Pas Company and began production. The new product wasn't completely satisfactory, pigment concentration was low and blending or impasto was impossible, so in 1924 they decided to develop a high viscosity crayon: the oil pastel. This used a mixture of mashed paraffin, stearic acid and coconut oil as a binder. Designed as a relatively cheap, easily applied, colorful <b>medium,</b> <b>oil</b> pastels granted younger artists and students a greater freedom of expression than the expensive chalk-like pastels normally associated with the fine arts. Until the addition of a stabiliser in 1927, oil pastels came in two types: winter pastels with additional oil to prevent hardening and summer pastels with little oil to avoid melting. State schools simply couldn't afford the medium and, suspicious of the very idea of [...] "self-expression" [...] in general, favoured the coloured pencil, a cheaper German invention then widely promoted in Europe as a means to instill work discipline in young children.|$|E
