5|$|Anniyan (English: Outsider or Stranger) is a 2005 Indian Tamil-language {{psychological}} thriller film {{written and}} directed by S. Shankar and produced by V. Ravichandran of Aascar Films. The plot centres on a disillusioned everyman whose frustration at what he sees as increasing social apathy and public negligence leads to a split personality that attempts to right the system. Vikram stars as Ramanujam, an idealistic, law-abiding lawyer who suffers from multiple personality disorder and develops two other identities: a <b>metrosexual</b> fashion model Remo and a vigilante serial killer named Anniyan. Sadha plays his love interest, Nandini. Actors Vivek, Prakash Raj, Nedumudi Venu and Nassar also feature in the film.|$|E

A duality of individual free choice and disciplinary institutional governance is the grand national paradox. Simply being—leading life without a bumper sticker avowing one’s elective institutional affinities—seems implausible in a country consumed by the makeover—the idea that what you were born as need not define you forever. As Toby Miller writes in his introduction: “I come neither to bury the makeover nor to praise the makeover, but to criticize it, even as I stand alternately bewildered, amused, appalled, and attracted by it. ” In Makeover Nation he does just that in a witty, no-holds-barred style. Miller looks at the power of various forms of knowledge about people and their emotions as they have been applied to the US population, from talk therapy to drug treatment. He is particularly interested in young people—in examining how childhood is constructed—and pays close attention to the much-favored (and overused) diagnosis and treatment of ADHD/ADD. He also focuses his attention on <b>metrosexuals</b> and right-wing Christians to disclose how these opposing groups manifest their drive toward self-creation.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the ways in}} which rural, national, and urban spaces become gendered through the practices and representations of beer drinking in New Zealand. Critical social theory combined with feminist poststructuralist debates on identities provides the theoretical framework for this research. Two focus groups with Pākehā beer drinkers aged between 18 - 30 years old were conducted; one consisting of six males and the other consisting of six females. Critical textual analysis was also undertaken on five beer advertisements representing the most popular beer brands in New Zealand; Tui, Lion Red, Waikato and Speight's. Three points frame the analysis. First, I examine rural and national gendered identities associated with beer drinking. New Zealand's beer drinking cultures are constructed within rural discourses of masculinity. There is not a single masculinity present in New Zealand's beer drinking cultures, rather there are multiple and conflicting masculinities. I suggest that through the need to constantly perform their identity, men create a rural hegemonic masculinity that is both hard, yet vulnerable. I argue that the femininities constructed within these spaces are used to enhance and further enable the hard, yet vulnerable, rural masculinity. Second, within urban spaces of beer drinking - such as the office, nightclub, clubrooms and home - homosexuals, <b>metrosexuals</b> and women are 'othered'. These identities are defined in relation to the hegemonic norm - 'Hard Man' masculinity - in negative ways. Furthermore, some women perform a hyper masculine identity in order to be included in these beer-drinking spaces. Finally, I examine {{the ways in which}} hegemonic gendered identities in rural, national and urban spaces may be resisted and subverted. I use contradictions from my focus group participants to unsettle the 'Hard Man' masculinity of New Zealand's beer drinking cultures...|$|R
40|$|Gender, {{the social}} rules and {{standards}} of behaviours imposed on male and female, {{has been a}} popular social debate. The modern pursuit of body beautiful and fashion among <b>metrosexuals</b> that trespasses feminine space causes uncertain social acceptance. Hence, the study aims to explore the marketing strategies in the grooming industry to overcome this uncertainty. Choosing the giant beauty producer, L’Oréal, the case study investigates its success story in cross-gender brand extension to L’Oréal Men Expert (LME), while continues to thrive in both female and male markets. Using Scollon's (2001, 2004) Mediated Discourse Analysis, the qualitative research aims to analyze how metrosexuality is negotiated through social interactions within the packaging discourse of L’Oréal Men Expert (LME), in comparison to L’Oréal Paris (LP). Approaching through actions, the study analyses how each social action within the packaging discourse is mediated by multimodal features strategized by gendered practices. Incorporated along are elements from structural semiotics, i. e. Barthesian Order of Signification and paradigmatic analysis, as well as Difference Framework from language and gender. The latter aims to depict the interaction (or tension) between traditional gender dichotomy (which causes gender stereotyping) and contemporary gender diversity (referring to queer identities, e. g. metrosexuality) {{that give rise to}} social controversies pertaining to metrosexuality. The ultimate aim is to uncover the marketers' manipulating (negotiating) strategies in overcoming traditional gender dichotomy to accept contemporary gender diversity. Narrowing the scope to whitening products, the analysis on a total of twelve (12) product packaging (consisting cleansers, toners and moisturizers) reveals different conceptual emphasis between male and female products. In LP/White Perfect, luxury, aesthetic, sensuality, vanity, attractiveness (beauty), passivity, femininity and skin-whitening are emphasised, while expertise, problems, functionality/performance, manual, unattractiveness, activeness, masculinity/anti-femininity and skin-brightening in LME/White Activ. These propose two different sets of gendered concepts in beauty and grooming contexts, separating metrosexuality from femininity. The study also depicts the strategies of negotiating metrosexuality in LME through both gender dichotomy and gender diversity, using binary/digital oppositions (either/or) and/or analogue oppositions (more/less) of both signifiers (multimodal features) and signifieds (meaning). Negotiation through gender dichotomy includes: 1) construct masculinity (claim masculinity); 2) avoid femininity (deny femininity); and 3) juxtapose masculinity and femininity (challenge femininity). On the contrary, negotiation through gender diversity is conducted through three ways: 1) downplay femininity (reduce femininity); 2) overshadow femininity (highlight masculinity); and 3) compromise femininity (add autonomy in femininity/add femininity in masculinity). Another significant discovery is the different portrayal between LP and LME for the same concepts. This includes portraying LP as a luxury worth-spending, aligns with the slogan "Because you're/I'm worth it", whereas LME sells the concept of cheap but highly functional products that are worth-buying "because it's worth it". Last but not least, the study uncovers the complementary nature between linguistics and marketing and further proposes the potential collaboration between both realms that serve as 'heuristic/explanation tool' and 'verification tool' respectively. In other words, it proposes the collaboration between the "grammar" and "dictionary" of semiotics.

40|$|The social {{sciences}} produce {{a kind of}} knowledge that has become vital, writes Raewyn Connell in this edited extract from her new book, Confronting Equality. • LATE IN 2009, the United Nations convened a great meeting in Copenhagen on an issue being defined as the greatest challenge of our time. Specialists in climate science had warned for years about the growing turbulence and risk resulting from human activities that change and especially heat the atmosphere. After two weeks of bitter wrangling, {{the governments of the}} world went home, having agreed on almost nothing. Developing countries, led by China, refused more extra restrictions on their high-pollution drive for economic growth; rich countries, led by the United States, refused the demand to wind down their high-consumption way of life. In mid 2010, the British-based transnational oil corporation BP had a nasty accident at an underwater well in the Gulf of Mexico, resulting from the urgent search for more fossil fuel as the time of ‘peak oil’ approaches. A media blitz followed the threat of pollution to the southern coast of the United States. A few media stories – only a few – drew a parallel with the catastrophe that had already surrounded oil spills on another continent. The Niger River delta has been the scene of epic corruption, social dislocation, civil war and devastating pollution since the oil companies arrived in the 1950 s. These traumatic events are not bad luck and not failures of personal leadership. They are consequences of the way our institutions and structures work: decisions in the hands of small elites, global struggle for profits and power, massive inequalities of resources, and the triumph of short-term calculation. We do not have a global environment problem, really. We have a global social problem. Ecological crisis and injustice can only be solved by social action and institutional change. The spread of HIV/AIDS, to take another critical issue, is not just a medical problem. From {{the early years of the}} epidemic it was clear that only social action could stop it. Community mobilizations did stop it, in some places – but not widely enough. The global epidemic continues to spread through social pathways formed by poverty, violence and patriarchy. Across a broad range of other issues, people grappling with practical dilemmas need to understand large-scale social processes. Women in organizations facing the ‘glass ceiling’, teachers troubled about over-surveillance of their work, activists dealing with domestic violence, knowledge workers grappling with marginality, all are stronger if they have reliable knowledge about how the problems arose and why they are intractable. We need social science because social processes shape human destinies. If we are to take control of our future, we need to understand society as much as we need to understand the atmosphere, the earth, and men’s and women’s bodies. There are many dubious interpretations of the social world on offer. There is market ideology, where every problem has the same solution – private property and unrestrained markets. There is ‘virtual sociology’ (skewered by Judith Stacey in her recent book Unhitched) where pressure-groups select the research results they like, ignore the ones they don’t, and so present their own prejudices as scientific findings. The most enjoyable pseudoscience is the pop sociology of market research firms: Generation X, Generation Y, the creative class, the mommy track, the <b>metrosexuals,</b> the sensitive new-age guy, the new traditionals, the aspirationals, the sea-changers... The names usually define faintly recognizable types, or at any rate marketing strategies, and the audience in wealthy countries fill in the details for themselves. Social science is harder. It is slower. Knowledge grows by a collective process of exploration that is complex and uncertain. Research must be unpredictable, since we never know at the start what the results will be. (If we do know, it isn’t research!) Social science needs patience and it does not suit media deadlines. It also needs resources, especially people and time. For intellectual work to be done there has to be a workforce; and that is not easily assembled or kept in being. There is often an awkward gap between significant questions and the means of answering them. Research is usually imagined as the gathering of data, but there is much more to it. Clarifying language, generating new concepts, relating ideas to each other, building interpretations – these too are necessary steps in producing knowledge. Theory is often handed over, with a sigh of relief, to a small group of specialists. It shouldn’t be. Theory is basically about trying to think beyond the immediately given; and this is business that concerns everyone with a stake in social science. In my experience, the best theoretical ideas bubble up in the midst of empirical research or practical problems and start talking to the facts straight away. The theories most widely used in social science come from Europe and North America. This is increasingly recognized as a problem. We have become conscious of the imperial history of social science itself and the limitations of vision in even the greatest thinkers of the global North. There is now a vigorous and exciting debate about how to create a world social science that mobilizes the social experience and intellectual resources of the South –where, after all, most of the people live. Social practices – including labour, care and struggle – are endlessly bringing new realities into existence. This is easily said, difficult to keep in mind. It is easier to think of the world as composed of things that we bump against like rocks – a family, a bank, a population, capitalism, patriarchy. But the storm of time keeps blowing: not only destroying what previously appeared solid, but creating and destroying and creating again. Borrowing a slightly pompous word from the Czech philosopher Karel Kosík, I call this the ontoformativity of social practice. Our collective actions, shaped by social structures precipitated from the past, make the social world we are moving into. And this social world is not a performative illusion, it becomes new fact. Social practice is generative, fecund, rich in real consequences. This is frightening, as many of the consequences are dire. The last hundred years have generated the most intense moments of violence (Kursk, Hiroshima) and the worst famines in human history, as well as the deepening disaster of climate change. Yet the same century has seen the greatest-ever increase in literacy and the greatest increase in expectations of life. Huge empires have been dismantled; there has been an unprecedented global struggle towards gender equality; there is tremendous cultural inventiveness, even in very poor and disrupted communities. Social science, concerned with this reality, has to be empirical; it tries to discover and describe the way things are in the world. The accuracy of its statements matters, its claims have to be testable and, ultimately, tested. That is what distinguishes social science from ideologies and pseudo-sciences, however entertaining or persuasive those may be. It is usually quantitative researchers who emphasize the empirical character of social science. I value the distributive information that surveys and censuses give, and some will be found in this book. A democratic science must be concerned with all the people, not just an iconic few. But social science cannot be only a system of quantitative statements. That would mean a sadly thin form of knowledge, missing out everything that produces the distributions our statistical methods describe – missing, in fact, the ontoformativity of practice. We need empirical methods that allow the creative surge through time to emerge. I have particularly used life-history interviews, combined with organizational ethnography, survey research and policy analysis in different studies. There are other ways to do it, of course. In this approach, the purpose of research is to illuminate situations, i. e. moments within the historical process that we call social reality. What social science produces, when working at full stretch, might be called social diagnoses – accounts of the dynamics of well understood situations. This approach is relevant to studying theory itself. In the conceptual chapters towards the end of the book, I look at social theories as creative responses to historical situations, whether by individual theorists or intellectual movements. This is the core of the argument against the Northern monopoly in theory – a monopoly that installs a privileged set of diagnoses as paradigms for the whole world. This would hardly matter, if social science were just a remote contemplation of human affairs. I don’t think we can afford this. Good social science, to me, means social science engaged with the world it studies. There are researchers who believe that to be scientific one must be neutral, because politics means bias. Science does need objectivity, but objectivity does not come from neutrality. Here I follow Max Deutscher’s sharp criticism of the belief that objectivity means detachment. Objectivity, as the attitude that leads to accurate, adequate knowledge of people and things, actually requires engagement with people and things. ‘Democracy’ is a word so contaminated by apologists for the rich and powerful that I hesitate to use it. But the principle remains and there is no better name – a world ruled by all the people who live in it, not by a privileged minority. No one who remembers the racism of colonialist anthropology or sociology’s surveillance of the poor, or who looks at economics now, would assume social science necessarily works for democracy. But social science can. Research can map the dynamics of the HIV epidemic for communities struggling to control it. Research can document power structures and the machinery of privilege. Social science has some capacity to multiply the voices heard in public arenas. And social theory has a capacity to bring imagination into dialogue with current reality. Doing social theory always means recognizing that things could be otherwise; that – to borrow a phrase again – another world is possible. For some years sociologists have been debating Michael Burawoy’s idea of ‘public sociology’. In that debate, public sociology figures as a choice for the social scientists. I would put the emphasis the other way around: social science is a necessity for the public. In a world where massive social institutions and social structures shape the fate of huge populations, a participatory democracy needs powerful and accurate knowledge about society. Only with this knowledge can collective decisions be made that steer our societies on the dangerous ground of the future. I am not suggesting that social science can be a political movement. It is a type of intellectual work, nothing more. But nothing less. It is work which produces a kind of knowledge that has become vital. Clarity and depth of understanding on social issues matter more than ever. I hope some will be found in my new book, Confronting Equality. • This is an edited extract from Confronting Equality: Gender, Knowledge and Global Change by Raewyn Connell, published by Allen & Unwin ($ 35. 00 rrp) ...|$|R
