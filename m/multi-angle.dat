The normalization algorithms aim at being position, scale and rotation invariant in order to standardize non-uniform handwriting results from all sorts of users. The process starts with identifying the bound of a handwriting. The cropped bound is centered to the origin and then scaled to a default size without producing undesirable distortions. Image skew problem is handled by sampling data image of <b>multi-angles</b> through rotation transformation to produce extra learning artifacts. Due to the high volume of pixel data, down-sampling is employed by mingling neighborhood pixels into blocks to improve learning and recognition speed. Finally, a 2 D image is serialized into an array of blocks to conduct learning and recognition. The empirical studies show that this proposed standardization approach can yield a high degree of accuracy, verified by a number of popular machine learning algorithms...|$|R

The Second generation Global Imager (SGLI) aboard the GCOM-C satellite is a follow-on sensor of the Global Imager (GLI) aboard the Midori- 2 satellite. It is designed for globally observing clouds and aerosols targets with high-accuracy and quick recurrence. The major geophysical parameters retrieved from SGLI atmosphere’s algorithm are cloud optical thickness, cloud particle radii, cloud top temperature, cloud geometrical thickness, aerosol optical thickness, and aerosol Angstrom exponents. Cloud discriminations all of SGLI pixels will also be supplied. It is notable that the SGLI has some functions specialized for observing aerosol properties over ocean and land.

Meanwhile, Sixpack sees the commotion and convinces a disillusioned and directionless Section 8 to rally and defeat the menace.

40|$|LED為近年來科技熱門發展的重要產業，在照明燈具的設計開發上白光LED為其首要，但由於白光LED的特性它在空間中的不同角度有不同的光譜及色溫分布，也只有透過檢測才能針對光源性質做其改良的部分。光源的檢測方式，通常都以積分球和光度計這兩種方法為主。而兩種檢測方式，可以偵測的項目也有些許的分別。例如: 積分球無法量測不同方向的光譜資訊，無法了解光源分布比例。而光度計在檢測的速度上收到旋轉平移台的限制，使得通常使用光度計都只量測單一截面而不夠全面化。兩種檢測方式都有其優點，也有其不足的部分，所以業界在檢測時常以兩種方式配合使用，以求得光源資訊的完整性。但這樣不但耗時，也相當耗費金錢。本論文提出一新型架構，利用多條光纖同時接收不同方位角之光線，經光纖分光及面型CCD記錄強度後，即可加以運算並獲得全方位之光譜資訊，克服了上述兩種技術不便處，並達到系統架構簡單、量測便利快速、資料完整的優點，建構出一新型的多方位角全功能光譜分析儀。LED is an {{important}} industry in today's high technology field; especially the design and development of white LED on lighting usage. However, usually light LEDs have different spectral and color temperature distribution along various angles. Thus {{it is critical to}} measure these properties to improve its performance. There are two test methods used in ordinary way. The first one is to use an integrating sphere, white can not provide the angular distribution. The second is to use a photometer, white needs a rotation stage to measure the spectrum at different angles. There two methods have their advantages and limitations, white is sometimes high cost and time consuming. In this thesis, a new configuration is proposed, which utilize several optical fibers and planer CCD to detect the light at different angles and provide all features of light source through post process. It can overcome the drawbacks of previous and offer many merits such as low cost, high speed and <b>multi-angles.</b> 摘要	III ABSTRACT	IV 表目次	VIII 圖目次	IX 第一章 序論	 1 1. 1 光譜簡介與應用	 1 1. 2 光源檢測簡介	 4 1. 3 文獻回顧	 6 1. 4 研究動機與目的	 10 1. 5 論文架構規劃	 13 第二章 基本理論介紹	 14 2. 1 幾何光學概述	 14 2. 1. 1 折射率	 15 2. 1. 2 折射與反射	 17 2. 1. 3 全反射	 18 2. 1. 4 光跡的可逆姓	 19 2. 2 透鏡成像原理	 19 2. 2. 1 單一球面透鏡成像	 21 2. 2. 2 造鏡者公式	 22 2. 2. 3 高斯公式	 23 2. 3 像差概述	 24 2. 3. 1 球面相差	 24 2. 3. 2 彗星像差	 25 2. 3. 3 像散與場曲	 26 2. 3. 4 畸變像差	 28 2. 3. 5 色像差	 29 2. 4 波動光學概述	 29 2. 4. 1 光的繞射	 30 2. 4. 2 光的干涉	 35 2. 4. 3 穿透式光柵概述	 37 2. 4. 4 色散現象	 39 2. 5 輻射度學與光度學	 40 2. 5. 1 光通量(Luminous flux：Φv) 	 41 2. 5. 2 照度(Illuminance：Ev) 	 43 2. 5. 3 光強度(Luminous Intensity：Iv) 	 44 第三章 系統架構設計與開發	 46 3. 1 系統架構	 46 3. 2 光源檢測距離分析	 47 3. 3 分光鏡組設計模擬	 52 3. 4 系統檢測模擬	 63 3. 5 實驗架設測試	 68 3. 5. 1 波長轉換	 71 3. 5. 2 波長響應校正	 73 3. 5. 3 色溫轉換	 78 第四章 結果與討論	 83 4. 1 研究結果	 83 4. 2 未來展望	 85 參考文獻	 8...|$|R

50|$|<b>Multi-angle</b> light {{scattering}} {{was invented in}} the mid-1980s and instruments like that {{were able to make}} measurements at the different angles simultaneously {{but it was not until}} the later 1980s (10-12) that the connection of <b>multi-angle</b> laser {{light scattering}} (MALS) detectors to SEC systems was a practical proposition enabling both molar mass and size to be determined from each slice of the polymer fraction.|$|E
50|$|For static light {{scattering}} experiments, a high-intensity monochromatic light, usually a laser, is launched {{in a solution}} containing the macromolecules. One or many detectors are {{used to measure the}} scattering intensity at one or many angles.

Hence simultaneous measurements at several angles relative to the direction of incident light, known as <b>multi-angle</b> {{light scattering}} (MALS) or <b>multi-angle</b> laser light scattering (MALLS), is generally regarded as the standard implementation of static light scattering.
