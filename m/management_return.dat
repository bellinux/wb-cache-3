40|$|Although few in number, studies {{consistently}} {{find that}} price explains little, if any, {{of the variation}} in profit across farms. This contrasts with farmers' opinions regarding the importance of price, as well as the use of price supports as a primary policy instrument. Using farm level data from the Illinois Farm Business Farm Management program for calendar years 1996 through 2004, a potential explanation for this conundrum is identified.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Ground-water/surface-water {{interactions}} are {{complex in the}} irrigated intermountain basins of Montana. In these basins, excess water from flood irrigation percolates to alluvial aquifers and may eventually contribute to streamflow. Water consumption {{in some of these}} basins is increasing as new irrigation wells pump ground water from the shallow aquifers, and as inefficient, flood-irrigation systems are converted to sprinkler irrigation, with subsequent increases in irrigated acreages. The Montana Department of Natural Resources and Conservation has conducted hydrology and return-flow studies in the Beaverhead, North Fork Blackfoot, and Smith river basins in west and west-central Montana. The intent of the studies is to characterize the interactions of ground water and surface water in these basins by intensively monitoring surface-water flows and ground-water levels. The results from these studies are being provided to water managers and policy makers so that they may use the information when making water management decisions.

40|$|This paper studies {{a supply}} chain {{consisting}} of two suppliers and an assembler who also acts as a retailer in a single period model. The suppliers provide complementary modules to the assembler and the latter assembles the final products and sells them to meet a stochastic demand. Each supplier can improve his performance by offering a return policy to the assembler while the best contract depends on that offered by the other supplier. We show that the non-cooperative contracts game between the firms has a unique and stable equilibrium in which the optimal return policies happen to fully coordinate the whole channel. Moreover, the suppliers still have the rights {{to negotiate with the}} assembler independently to share their profits properly. With such properties, the suppliers are encouraged to offer return policies to the assembler by following a simple rule derived from the favorable equilibrium, which will lead to a win-win-win situation.

An important aspect of loyalty is its moral basis. Scanning M&A literature, it becomes evident that very little has been written on the moral aspects of M&A. A case study of a merger was conducted, with the purpose to understand the influence that moral aspects could have on morale (understood as an expression of personnel‟s sense of loyalty to the organization), using theory on the social/psychological contract and utilitarianism. Could a changing morale reflect moral change? The study showed that, {{in the beginning of the}} merger process, when the management style was democratic and open, management invited to a psychological contract with personnel.

40|$|AbstractSport-related {{concussion}} is {{a common}} neurological injury that occurs in all levels of athletic participation. Concussions may actually go undiagnosed, as they do not always display outward signs and athletes may fail to report symptoms of concussion, either {{because they do not}} know the symptoms, or for fear of removal from play. Inappropriate management of concussion can lead to increased risk of subsequent injury. This article outlines various aspects of sport-related concussion management, including preparation/planning, education, evaluation, <b>management,</b> <b>return</b> to play decisions, and long term effects of concussion. Preparation and education are the first steps that must be taken to minimize the potentially negative consequences of concussion. If a concussion is suspected, it must be stressed that the evaluation should include a multifaceted approach, with a physical examination and assessment of signs and symptoms, neurocognition and balance. The management of concussion should include both physical and cognitive rest and factors such as transportation, sleep, work, and academics should be taken into consideration. Return to play following concussion should follow a graduated return to play protocol, with careful monitoring of symptoms. Sports medicine clinicians should stay up to date with information regarding concussion management and take a conservative approach, because there are recent reports of various cumulative effects of multiple concussions...|$|E
40|$|A {{method for}} {{estimating}} return on {{and risk of}} non-industrial private forest (NIPF) ownership involving the innovation of dividing the return into (i) felling, (ii) price change, (iii) change in the growing stock and (iv) silvicultural cost components has been developed. Comparison is made between stumpage price change and inflation {{as well as between}} forests and other assets, which are housing, offices, stocks and their subclass forest industry stocks as well as bonds and debentures. These results are based on a complete count of the stumpage prices, silvicultural costs, felling volumes and national forest inventory (NFI) data. Forest ownership produced a real return of only 2. 6 % in the 1972 – 2003 period, housing 4. 6 % and forest industry stocks as much as 7. 6 %. The nominal return on forest ownership of 8. 4 % consist-ed of stumpage price change rate 4. 6 %, commercial fellings 3. 1 %, costs – 0. 35 %, and volume change component 1. 0 %. Surprisingly, stumpage price change did not exceed the inflation level of 5. 8 %. The correlation with forest ownership was statistically significant only with private housing. Competi-tiveness benchmarking places forests slightly behind housing. However, optimal portfolios, which also recognise correlations, place housing behind forests. In all, financial investments clearly outperformed real investments in the low inflation 1987 – 2003 period.

40|$|Deciding when {{to return}} to sport after injury is complex and multifactorial-an {{exercise}} in risk <b>management.</b> <b>Return</b> to sport decisions are made every day by clinicians, athletes and coaches, ideally in a collaborative way. The purpose of this consensus statement was to present and synthesise current evidence to make recommendations for return to sport decision-making, clinical practice and future research directions related to returning athletes to sport. A half day meeting was held in Bern, Switzerland, after the First World Congress in Sports Physical Therapy. 17 expert clinicians participated. 4 main sections were initially agreed upon, then participants elected to join 1 of the 4 groups-each group focused on 1 section of the consensus statement. Participants in each group discussed and summarised the key issues for their section before the 17 -member group met again for discussion to reach consensus {{on the content of}} the 4 sections. Return to sport is not a decision taken in isolation {{at the end of the}} recovery and rehabilitation process. Instead, return to sport should be viewed as a continuum, paralleled with recovery and rehabilitation. Biopsychosocial models may help the clinician make sense of individual factors that may influence the athlete's return to sport, and the Strategic Assessment of Risk and Risk Tolerance framework may help decision-makers synthesise information to make an optimal return to sport decision. Research evidence to support return to sport decisions in clinical practice is scarce.

The average margin over all costs on a per head sold basis showed a large loss ($- 52. 89 for the average producer). The average return per hour of labor after all costs was -$ 12. 36 for all 18 producers, but $ 9. 23 per hour for the top 6 producers and -$ 9. 82 for the bottom 6 producers. The average total cost per hundred pounds of pork produced for all producers was $ 81. 40, while the top third (6) had average total costs that were $ 32. 43 less than the bottom 6 producers ($ 66. 52 vs $ 98. 75). Production costs increased by about 21 percent over the 2007 level. The main contributor to cost differences between the top third and bottom third producers was operating costs, which included feed and other operating expenses and labor costs. These costs represented the majority of the total cost difference and were about equally split between the two; operating costs (feed and other) and labor costs. The information summarized here shows striking differences in many areas between the top 6 and bottom 6 producers. The areas with the largest differences are places with the most potential to help producers improve. Educational programming that targets these areas is being developed to help these producers make changes to improve their operations, which in turn will improve the position of this sector of the industry...|$|E

Small successful farmers are young farmers with high education levels who rent most of the land they use and probably also rent high proportions of their equipment and machinery, given their high proportion of rent expenses and low proportion of depreciation and interest expenses. They have a low financial leverage. Overall, management appears an essential ingredient to farm success, as important as hard work, even more so in some instances.
