5|$|An {{example of}} a low-maintenance {{experiment}} was the protein crystal growth experiment, which had also been flown on previous shuttle missions. The goal was to produce better protein crystallizations than those produced on the Earth, and hence allowing for a <b>more</b> <b>accurate</b> model of protein structures. Of the 23 proteins and viruses attempted during Expedition 1, only four resulted in successful crystallizations, which was a lower success rate than predicted. Of those successful was the low-calorie sweetener Thaumatin, whose crystals diffracted at a higher resolution than Earth-grown crystal, {{which resulted in a}} <b>more</b> <b>accurate</b> protein structure model.|$|E
5|$|Another common {{progressive}} alignment method called T-Coffee is {{slower than}} Clustal and its derivatives but generally produces <b>more</b> <b>accurate</b> alignments for distantly related sequence sets. T-Coffee calculates pairwise alignments {{by combining the}} direct alignment of the pair with indirect alignments that aligns each sequence of the pair to a third sequence. It uses the output from Clustal as well as another local alignment program LALIGN, which finds multiple regions of local alignment between two sequences. The resulting alignment and phylogenetic tree are used {{as a guide to}} produce new and <b>more</b> <b>accurate</b> weighting factors.|$|E

5|$|A new guitar {{controller}} {{was developed}} for Guitar Hero 5, sold with bundles with the game though the option for standalone versions {{has not yet been}} determined. Like other Guitar Hero controllers, the guitar-shaped unit features five colored fret buttons on the neck of the guitar, a strum bar to mimic the act of strumming, a whammy bar to alter the pitch of a note, and additional buttons specific to the game console for maneuvering through the game's menus. The unit is mostly a redesign of the World Tour model with a new red finish and includes the touchpad that is farther up the neck of the controller, allowing the player to play notes via tapping or to slide along its surface for specially marked sections on the note track. The Guitar Hero 5 unit features a <b>more</b> <b>accurate</b> and responsive touchpad due to it being tracked digitally and with added tactile responses, a <b>more</b> <b>accurate</b> strum bar, and a controller finish that makes it easier to handle with sweaty hands. The game remains compatible with previous Guitar Hero game controllers as well as those from Rock Band and selected other rhythm games.|$|E

50|$|In 1925 Komarek synonymized Dugesia sagitta (then Planaria sagitta) with D. gonocephala, {{because the}} {{morphological}} description given by Schmidt when the species was named in 1861 was not accurated. In 1984 D. sagitta was {{back from the}} synonymization thanks to the contribution of a <b>more</b> <b>accurated</b> morphological description done by de Vries. In 1861 Schmidt also described D. sagitta from Cephalonia, but de Vries demonstrated that it was actually D. aenigma.|$|R

5|$|A third popular iteration-based method called MUSCLE (multiple {{sequence}} alignment by log-expectation) improves on progressive methods with a <b>more</b> <b>accurate</b> distance {{measure to}} assess the relatedness of two sequences.

5|$|After {{discovering}} the burst's X-ray afterglow, the BeppoSAX team provided a <b>more</b> <b>accurate</b> localization, and what Metzger had {{assumed to be}} a variable star was still present in this smaller error box.

40|$|This study {{aimed at}} {{constructing}} equations with fractionary, unitary and ten magnitude power, {{in an attempt}} of representing the top, medium and basis portion of the stem; at constructing polynomial equations compatible with volume equations; at evaluating the accuracy of three non-segmented polynomial taper models for estimating diameters and volumes along the stem of Pinus taeda; and at verifying if the <b>more</b> <b>accurated</b> model for diameters estimates is also the <b>more</b> <b>accurated</b> for estimating partial and total volumes. The database used was composed of 58 trees of Pinus taeda cubed by the Smalians method, in the farms of PISA Papel de Imprensa S/A enterprise, located in Jaguariaíva county (PR). The 58 trees were separated in 8 diameter classes. The models were fitted for each diameter class and for the total group of data. Three non-segmented polynomial models were tested: Schöepfer (1966); Hradetzky (1976); and Goulding and Murray (1976). The accuracy of the models in estimating diameters and volumes along the stem of Pinus taeda was evaluated through the following statistics: coefficient of determination; residual standard error; graphic analysis of the medium profile of the stem; mean deviation of the diameters and volumes for each position along the stem; standard deviation of the differences of the diameters and volumes; sum of square of the relative residue; and percentage of the residues of the diameters and volumes. Starting from the last four statistics, it was elaborated a ranking to detect the <b>more</b> <b>accurated</b> model for each position along the stem. It can {{be pointed out that}} among the non-segmented models tested, the model of Hradetzky (1976) is more stable than the others in the estimates of the two studied variables. Goulding and Murray (1976) model presented accurated estimates of diameters and volumes along the whole stem profile only when fitted by diameter classes. The model proposed by Schöepfer (1965) showed biased estimates along the whole stem profile, in all diameter classes...|$|R

5|$|It {{should be}} borne {{in mind that}} the {{characteristics}} of the filter predicted by the image method are only accurate if the section is terminated with its image impedance. This is usually not true of the sections at either end, which are usually terminated with a fixed resistance.
