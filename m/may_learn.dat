In addition to long-term facial recognition of individuals, sheep can also differentiate emotional states through facial characteristics. If worked with patiently, sheep <b>may</b> <b>learn</b> {{their names and}} many sheep are trained to be led by halter for showing and other purposes. Sheep have also responded well to clicker training. Sheep {{have been used as}} pack animals; Tibetan nomads distribute baggage equally throughout a flock as it is herded between living sites.|$|E
5|$|A {{supportive}} {{environment and}} family generally gives those with Tourette's {{the skills to}} manage the disorder. People with Tourette's <b>may</b> <b>learn</b> to camouflage socially inappropriate tics or to channel the energy of their tics into a functional endeavor. Accomplished musicians, athletes, public speakers, and professionals {{from all walks of}} life are found among people with Tourette's. Outcomes in adulthood are associated more with the perceived significance of having severe tics as a child than with the actual severity of the tics. A person who was misunderstood, punished, or teased at home or at school will fare worse than children who enjoyed an understanding and supportive environment.|$|E

It offers a contract in which a girl may have any wish granted in exchange for obtaining magical powers and being tasked with fighting against witches. Meanwhile, a transfer student and magical girl named Homura Akemi tries to stop Madoka from making the contract with Kyubey at all costs. Madoka and Sayaka then meet Mami Tomoe, an upperclassman at the same school {{who is also a}} magical girl and offers to bring them along on her witch hunts so that they <b>may</b> <b>learn</b> of the responsibilities that come with being a magical girl.|$|E

5|$|Magic is {{a common}} ability in the game, and several {{character}} classes use it. Spells are divided into two groups: White, which is defensive and healing, and Black, which is debilitating and destructive. Magic can be bought from White and Black magic shops and assigned to characters whose occupation allows them to use it. Spells are classified by a level between one and eight, with four White and four Black spells per level. Each character <b>may</b> <b>learn</b> only three spells per level. White and Black Mages can potentially learn any of their respective spells, while Red Mages, the Ninja, and the Knight cannot use most high-level magic.|$|E
5|$|To {{reach the}} cathedral, Garrett ventures through Old Quarter, a haunted, {{abandoned}} district of the City. Through {{an opening in}} the cathedral, The Eye informs Garrett of a nearby Keeper sanctuary, where he <b>may</b> <b>learn</b> how to unseal the cathedral. There, Garrett discovers that the cathedral was sealed to prevent the City's destruction by the Trickster. He learns that there are four talismans needed to remove the seal: two hidden in ancient ruins beneath the City, and two inside a Hammerite temple (in Thief Gold, one talisman is in possession of the mages and another was found at an opera house after it was taken from the caves below, while the other two are in the Lost City and the Hammerite Temple as in the original game). Garrett recovers the talismans and returns to the cathedral. After unsealing the cathedral, he learns that its inhabitants had been killed and made undead by The Eye. He returns The Eye to Constantine, who reveals himself to be the Trickster. Viktoria says that The Eye requires a flesh eye to function; she binds Garrett with vines and removes his right eye. The Trickster places it on the gemstone, and the two disappear through a portal. Garrett, left for dead, is found and freed by two Keepers. During his escape from the Trickster's mansion, he learns that the Trickster plans to use The Eye to revert the world to a wild state.|$|E
5|$|This {{incident}} causes Katarn {{to distance}} himself from the Force and return to mercenary missions with Jan Ors. In Jedi Outcast, Ors is captured by Desann, a former pupil of Luke Skywalker who has turned to the Dark Side. Katarn believes Desann to have killed Ors, and so he returns to the Valley of the Jedi in an attempt to reconnect to the Force so as to stop Desann. Eventually, it is revealed that Ors' death is a ruse by Desann {{for the express purpose of}} having Katarn return to the Valley, so Desann <b>may</b> <b>learn</b> of its location. Desann, in league with the Imperial Remnant, uses the power of the Valley to endow his troops with Force power, before using them to launch an attack on the Jedi Academy. However, Katarn defeats Desann and discovers his true path, becoming a tutor at the Academy. In Jedi Academy, Katarn takes on two students: Jaden Korr and Rosh Penin. The protagonist of the game is Jaden, who is dispatched on various peace-keeping missions across the galaxy, sometimes with Katarn, sometimes alone. Jaden eventually encounters a Sith cult led by Tavion (Desann's former apprentice) who plans to restore the Sith to power by using stolen Force energy to resurrect an ancient Sith Lord, Marka Ragnos. After learning that Rosh has betrayed the Jedi and joined Tavion, Jaden may either kill him and turn to the Dark Side or let him live and remain on the Light Side. If Jaden chooses to free Rosh, he ultimately faces and defeats both Tavion and the spirit of Ragnos. If he chooses the Dark Side, he kills Tavion, fights and defeats (but does not kill) Katarn, and then flees with Tavion's staff, which is capable of absorbing the Force. The game ends with Katarn setting out in pursuit of Jaden.|$|E

25|$|Both unschooling {{and natural}} {{learning}} advocates believe that children learn best by doing; a child <b>may</b> <b>learn</b> reading to further an interest about history or other cultures, or math skills by operating {{a small business}} or sharing in family finances. They <b>may</b> <b>learn</b> animal husbandry keeping dairy goats or meat rabbits, botany tending a kitchen garden, chemistry to understand the operation of firearms or the internal combustion engine, or politics and local history by following a zoning or historical-status dispute. While any type of homeschoolers may also use these methods, the unschooled child initiates these learning activities. The natural learner participates with parents and others in learning together.|$|E

25|$|The {{motivation}} {{for the study of}} logic in ancient times was clear: it is so that one <b>may</b> <b>learn</b> to distinguish good arguments from bad arguments, and so become more effective in argument and oratory, and perhaps also to become a better person. Half of the works of Aristotle's Organon treat inference as it occurs in an informal setting, {{side by side with the}} development of the syllogistic, and in the Aristotelian school, these informal works on logic were seen as complementary to Aristotle's treatment of rhetoric.|$|E
25|$|Blue jays {{can make}} a large variety of sounds, and {{individuals}} may vary perceptibly in their calling style. Like other corvids, they <b>may</b> <b>learn</b> to mimic human speech. Blue jays can also copy the cries of local hawks so well that it is sometimes difficult to tell which it is. Their voice is typical of most jays in being varied, but the most commonly recognized sound is the alarm call, which is a loud, almost gull-like scream. There is also a high-pitched jayer-jayer call that increases in speed as the bird becomes more agitated. This particular call can be easily confused with the chickadee's song because of the slow starting chick-ah-dee-ee. Blue jays will use these calls to band together to mob potential predators such as hawks and drive {{them away from the}} jays' nests.|$|E

25|$|Some {{schools have}} come and gone, and some have offshoots (such as the Mei'an school, a Zhucheng school offshoot). Often, the school is {{originated}} from a single person, such as the Wu school which is named after the late Wu Zhaoji. The style can vary considerably between schools; some are very similar, yet others are very distinct. The differences are often in interpretation of the music. Northern schools {{tend to be more}} vigorous in technique than Southern schools. But in modern terms, the distinction between schools and styles is often blurred because a single player <b>may</b> <b>learn</b> from many different players from different schools and absorb each of their styles. This is especially so for conservatory trained players. People from the same school trained under the same master may have different individual styles (such as Zhang Ziqian and Liu Shaochun of the Guangling school).|$|E
500|$|Thief {{takes place}} in a {{metropolis}} called [...] "the City", which has been noted to contain elements of the Middle Ages-like dark fantasy and the Industrial Revolution. Project director Greg LoPiccolo said in an early preview: [...] "In essence [...] this undefined medieval age, sort of medieval [...] meets Brazil meets City of Lost Children. There's some electricity, some magic, and some 19th century machinery kind of stuff." [...] The setting has been described as steampunk, a fantastical setting where steam engine technology is prominently used. During levels, the player <b>may</b> <b>learn</b> about the setting by finding notes and overhearing conversations; it has been noted that the player participates in the revelation of Thiefs setting.|$|E

According to Fine, his approach to development was haphazard and he totally failed to understand why Morphy won.|$|E
