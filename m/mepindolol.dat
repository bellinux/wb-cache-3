40|$|Transdermal drug {{delivery}} {{has been applied}} to various agents in an effort to decrease the frequency of drug administration and increase the patients compliance. In our study, we demonstrated that transdermal application of a ß-blocker (20 mg <b>mepindolol)</b> in patients with essential hypertension led to effective blood pressure lowering effect within 1 week (160. 1 ± 6. 1 mm Hg/ 95. 8 ± 8. 3 mm Hg vs 136. 8 ± 7. 2 mm Hg/ 84. 3 ± 5. 0 mm Hg; Ρ < 0. 05). A controlled study of transdermal versus oral ß-blocker administration in hypertensives is necessary before this new therapeutic system is introduced in antihypertensive treatment.

40|$|Every {{year the}} number of β-blockers on the {{pharmaceutical}} market is increasing, requiring systematization of their standardization methods. Aim of research. The aim of our research is to study literature data about identification and assay methods of β-blockers with different direction of action – selective (praktolol, metoprolol, atenolol, acebutolol, betaxolol, bevantolol, bisoprolol, celiprolol, esmolol, epanolol, esatenolol, nebivolol, Talinolol), non-selective (alprenolol, Oxprenololum, pindolol, propranolol, timolol, sotalol, nadolol, <b>mepindolol,</b> karteol, tertatolol, bopindolol, bupranolol, penbutolol, kloranolol) and combined (labetalol, carvedilol). Methods. The analytical review of literature sources about β-blockers analysis by physical, chemical, and physicochemical methods. Results. After literature sources’ analyzing {{it was found that}} physical and physicochemical constants are basically used for β-blockers pharmacopoeial analysis; both physicochemical values and chemical reactions are used in forensic analysis, resulting in the article. It was founded that titration methods, mostly acid-base titration method, are used for β-blockers assay in the analysis of substances. For β-blockers detection in biological fluids and dosage forms, active pharmaceutical ingredients and metabolites mixture separation one should prefer physicochemical methods, such as gas chromatography and liquid chromatography, absorption UV-Visible spectroscopy, fluorometry, etc. Conclusion. The results have shown can be used for the further search of the identification and assay optimal methods of β-blockers both pure and mixed with other active substances and excipients</p...|$|E
