40|$|The {{composition}} of mining waste {{varies according to}} the nature of the mining operation and many other factors, but where the same mineral is extracted from a similar style of metalliferous or industrial mineral deposit or coal, the waste usually has similar characteristics. There are many potential sources of industrial minerals from mining waste. Waste from one mine may be a byproduct or coproduct in a mining operation elsewhere. Much technical research work on mine waste utilization, for example studies on slate waste, has included a manufacturing process. The waste is invariably an inferior material compared with an industrial mineral from a primary resource for the manufacturing process. Successful markets have not been found. Four scenarios are proposed where an industrial <b>mineral</b> <b>product</b> made from mining waste may be marketed successfully. These are a bulk product for a local market made with minimal or no processing; a low unit value product and a cost-effective alternative source of a mineral for local industry; an industrial mineral commodity traded nationally or internationally; and extraction of a high unit value rare mineral. Making an industrial <b>mineral</b> <b>product</b> from mining waste and successfully marketing it should involve minimal processing of the waste consistent with the value of the <b>mineral</b> <b>product.</b> ...|$|E

Little research has evaluated the effect of an injectable trace <b>mineral</b> <b>product,</b> {{in conjunction with a}} dietary mineral supplementation program, on reproduction. This thesis includes two separate studies evaluating the use of an injectable trace <b>mineral</b> <b>product,</b> in addition to a dietary mineral program, on the reproductive success of yearling bulls and heifers. In the first study, we hypothesized that when dietary trace mineral needs are met, administration of an injectable trace <b>mineral</b> <b>product</b> to developing beef bulls would cause a short-term increase in circulating trace mineral concentrations, but not alter semen quality nor ability to pass a breeding soundness examination. Trace mineral treatment did not affect scrotal circumferences and BW of bulls throughout the trial (P [equal to or greater than] 0. 20). Trace Mineral bulls had greater (P [equal to or less than] 0. 0001) trace mineral concentrations at 8 h post-treatment than Control bulls. Semen trace mineral concentrations on d 42 and 91 were similar (P [equal to or greater than] 0. 52) between treatments. Sperm parameters improved (P [equal to or less than] 0. 003) from d 42 to 91, but did not differ (P [equal to or greater than] 0. 06) between treatments. A similar (P = 0. 94) percentage of Trace Mineral (67 %) and Control (68 %) bulls passed a BSE 91 d post-treatment. In the present study, supplemental trace mineral injection was successful at raising circulating trace mineral levels, but did not alter semen trace mineral levels nor improve semen quality. In the second study we hypothesized that when dietary trace mineral needs are met, the use of an injectable trace <b>mineral</b> <b>product</b> in developing heifers would not affect pregnancy rates at single service fixed-time artificial insemination (FTAI). Trace Mineral heifers had greater (P = 0. 02) pregnancy rates (51. 28 %) than Control heifers (25. 58 %). The percentage of Trace Mineral (30. 77 %) and Control heifers (47. 50 %) that displayed estrous behavior prior to FTAI as indicated by a red estrous detection patch was not different (P = 0. 13) between treatments. In the present study, despite dietary trace mineral requirements being met, use of an injectable trace mineral injection improved pregnancy rates following FTAI, but did not affect estrous behavior...|$|E

The {{distributed}} control system network involves analog data acquisition nodes interconnected through CAN and USB protocol interfaces to form a network. The network {{is designed to be}} generically applicable to various control problems. This network of controllers was specifically utilised on a scaled-down electrostatic roll separator plant used in the mineral processing industry. A SISO and a MIMO regulator was designed to demonstrate the regulation of plant parameters. The MIMO regulator was employed in a scheme that optimises the plant yield automatically. Analog data acquisition nodes were designed and built especially {{for the purposes of this}} project. These nodes were installed on the electrostatic roll separator plant. PC based application software was written so that plant ID experiments could be performed. SISO and MIMO regulators along with a yield optimising scheme was designed and implemented in the application software. Both SISO and MIMO regulators successfully regulated plant outputs. The nonconducting <b>mineral</b> <b>product</b> grade was regulated by the SISO regulator. The non-conducting <b>mineral</b> <b>product</b> grade and conductor mineral mass flow was regulated by the MIMO regulator.

40|$|The most {{important}} requirement for Hanford's low activity waste (LAW) form for shallow land disposal is the chemical durability of the product. A secondary, but still essential specification, is the compressive {{strength of the}} material {{with regards to the}} strength of the material under shallow land disposal conditions, e. g. the weight of soil overburden and potential intrusion by future generations, because the term ''near-surface disposal'' indicates disposal in the uppermost portion, or approximately the top 30 meters, of the earth's surface. The THOR{reg_sign} Treatment Technologies (TTT) mineral waste form for LAW is granular in nature because it is formed by Fluidized Bed Steam Reforming (FBSR). As a granular product it {{has been shown to be}} as durable as Hanford's LAW glass during testing with ASTM C- 1285 - 02 known as the Product Consistency Test (PCT) and with the Single Pass Flow Through Test (SPFT). Hanford Envelope A and Envelope C simulants both performed well during PCT and SPFT testing and during subsequent performance assessment modeling. This is partially due to the high aluminosilicate content of the <b>mineral</b> <b>product</b> which provides a natural aluminosilicate buffering mechanism that inhibits leaching and is known to occur in naturally occurring aluminosilicate mineral analogs. In order for the TTT Na-Al-Si (NAS) granular <b>mineral</b> <b>product</b> to meet the compressive strength requirements (ASTM C 39) for a Hanford waste form, the granular product needs to be made into a monolith or disposed of in High Integrity Containers (HIC's). Additionally, the Hanford intruder scenario for disposal in the Immobilized Low Activity Waste (ILAW) trench is mitigated as there is reduced intruder exposure when a waste form is in a monolithic form. During the preliminary testing of a monolith binder for TTT's FBSR <b>mineral</b> <b>product,</b> four parameters were monitored: (1) waste loading (not optimized for each waste form tested); (2) density; (3) compressive strength; and (4) durability must not be compromised [...] binding agent should not react with the NAS product and binding agent should not create an unfavorable pH environment that may cause accelerated leaching. It is the goal of the present study to survey cementitious waste forms based on Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC), Ceramicrete, and hydroceramic binders by correlating waste loading, density and compressive strength and then determine if these binders affect the product performance in terms of the PCT response. This will be done by making a one-to-one comparison of the PCT response measured on granular NAS <b>mineral</b> <b>product</b> (mixed bed and fines products) with the PCT response of the monolithed NAS product in the different binders. Future studies may include, refining the above binders, and examining other binders. It is likely that binders formed from kaolin would be most compatible with the chemistry of the THOR{reg_sign} mineral waste form which is made by steam reforming of kaolin and sodium rich wastes. The economics of production on a large scale have yet to be investigated for any of the binders tested...|$|E
