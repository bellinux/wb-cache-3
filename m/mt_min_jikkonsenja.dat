40|$|In {{order to}} study the effect of seed hydro priming and {{magnetic}} field on tomato seed germination an experiment was conducted in laboratory of Ferdowsi University of Mashhad, Iran, in 2010. The experimental treatments were all combinations of two levels of hydro priming (use of dry seed and soaked seed for five h in distilled water) and eight levels of magnetic field treatments (pretreatment of seeds in 15 mT for 5, 15 and 25 minutes, pretreatment of seeds in 25 mT for 5, 15 and 25 minutes, continuous magnetic field with 3 mT and control) with four replications. Results indicated that hydro priming of seeds reduced mean germination time significantly. Root length increased by 14 percent in seed hydro priming treatment in comparison with dry seed treatment.

40|$|Abstract:- Electromagnetic {{field is}} an {{inevitable}} environmental factor for living beings which many investigations {{have been conducted}} to consider its effect. In this research the effects of electromagnetic field on pollen ultrastructure, pollen germination and viability of Achillea wilhelmsii were studied. Achillea wilhelmsii C. Koch was collected from around area of Isfahan city (Iran). In case of pollen treatments, the pollens were exposed to electromagnetic field by a magnitude of 2, 4 <b>mT</b> at 10 <b>min</b> and 2, 4 <b>mT</b> at 20 <b>min</b> in the electromagnetic field generator apparatus. Untreated pollens were used as control under similar condition. Pollens were studied by Scanning electron microscopy. The effect of electromagnetic fields on pollen germination was evaluated. Germination was quatified {{as the percentage of}} germinated pollen grains per 100 evaluated. Pollen grains for study of viability, were stained with Evans blue. The results were analyzed using ANOVA statistical to analyses of the treatments. Treatment under pollens with electromagnetic fields 2 mT- 10, 20 min have few changes, but treatment under pollens with electromagnetic fields 4 mT- 20 min become abnormal, shrinkage and fragile. the percentage of pollen germination and viability decreased that was significantly(p< 0. 05). electromagnetic field have effects on the structure of some organs and developmental characteristic of them in Achillea wilhelmsii.

A music therapist, over four consecutive days in the late afternoon, engaged four female residents with dementia, aged 80 to 97, in a small group singing MT session.

40|$|Background aims Research {{results have}} shown that bone mesenchymal stromal cells (BMSC) can {{different}} into neural cells. Electromagnetic fields (EMF) {{play a role in}} regulating cell proliferation and differentiation, but the mechanisms behind this are unknown. In the present study, we explored the efficacy of EMF on the induction of rat BMSC differentiation into neurons in vitro. Methods First, rat BMSC were induced in a nerve cell culture environment and divided into three groups: an EMF induction treatment group (frequency of 50 Hz, magnetic induction of 5 <b>mT,</b> 60 <b>min</b> per day for 12 days), an induction-only group and a control group. Second, we observed cell phenotypes in a confocal microscope, tested gene expression through the use of reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction, and detected postsynaptic currents by means of a cell patch-clamp. We analyzed the cell cycles and the portion of cells expressing neural cell markers with the use of flow cytometry. Results The results indicated that EMF can facilitate BMSC differentiation into neural cells, which expressed neuronal-specific markers and genes; they formed synaptic junctions and pulsed excitatory postsynaptic currents. At the same time, the G 0 -G 1 phase ratio recorded by means of flow cytometry gradually decreased under the EMF treatment, whereas there was an increase of S-phase ratio, and the portion of cells expressing neuronal-specific markers increased. Conclusions Given that a noninvasive treatment of 50 -Hz EMF could significantly facilitate BMSC to differentiate into functional neurons, EMF appears to be a promising clinical option for stem cell transplantation therapies to combat central nervous system diseases...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to assess the effect of 50 Hz electromagnetic fields (EMFs) on hippocampal cell cultures in {{the presence or absence of}} either sodium nitroprusside (SNP, a NO donor) or Fe 2 + induced oxidative stress. One week old cultured rat hippocampal cells were exposed to either intermittent EMFs (IEMFs, 50 Hz, 0 - 5 <b>mT,</b> 1 <b>min</b> ON/OFF cycles, repeated 10 times every 2 h, 6 times/day during 48 h) or continuous EMFs (CEMFs, 50 Hz, 0 - 5 mT for 48 h). In a second set of experiments, the effect on such EMFs applied in combination with oxidative stress induced by 0. 5 microM Fe 2 + or SNP was estimated. At the end of both sets of experiments, cell mortality was assessed by lactate dehydrogenase measurements (LDH). Neither type of exposure to EMFs was observed to modify the basal rate of cell mortality. The exposure to CEMFs in presence of either NO or Fe 2 + did not induce any significant increase in cell death. However, when cells were exposed to EMFs in the presence of NO, we observed a significant increase in cell death of 11 and 23 % (P< 0. 001) at 2. 5 and 5 mT, respectively. This effect had some specificity because IEMFs did not modify the effect of Fe 2 + on cell mortality. Although the effects of IEMFs reported in this study were only observed at very high intensities, our model may prove valuable in trying to identify one cellular target of EMFs...|$|R

40|$|The {{following}} is an attempted economic study of Tasmania's principal non-ferrous mineral industries comprising copper, tin, silver-lead and zinc, which are surveyed separately and prefaced by an historical outline of the chief mining fields relating to each. The historical outlines have been included because they indicate the economic problems awaiting solution, and in addition they testify to the wisdom or otherwise of certain policies, and the applicability of specific principles. The economic survey here undertaken was prompted by a spirit of enquiry arising out of a three years' close association with Tasmania's west Coast mining fields. The instability of mining, with its derelict capital, annihilation of whole towns and impermanence in community life generally,first aroused this enquiry. The method adopted has been to collect as many facts as possible pertaining to the subject, and from this data, make {{a study of the}} structure and problems of each industry separately In the final analysis, the thesis is permitted to emphasise its most obvious conclusions,and provide a brief practical proposition as an answer to them. The base year taken for copper is 1933, and although this was a very unfavourable year for most industries, no serious objection can be taken to it here, for the copper industry was a steadily expanding one. Whore obtainable, I have tried to make 1928 the base year on which to plot graphs, because this year was generally recognised as a most favourable one.
