25|$|Brain drain is a {{persistent}} problem {{evident in the}} educational system of the Philippines due to the modern phenomenon of globalization, {{with the number of}} Overseas Filipino Workers (OFWs) who worked abroad {{at any time during the}} period April to September 2014 was estimated at 2.3 million. This ongoing mass immigration subsequently induces an unparalleled brain drain alongside grave economic implications. Additionally, Philippine society hitherto is footing the bill for the education of <b>millions</b> <b>who</b> successively spend their more productive years abroad. Thus, the already poor educational system of the Philippines indirectly subsidizes the opulent economies who host the OFWs.|$|E

Reappearing inside a Sphinx-shaped ship, Apocalypse confronts the X-Men with his newly assembled cadre of Horsemen on the front lawn of the X-Mansion. The Horseman Famine uses his powers to cause an intense feeling of hunger and weakness in the mutants and humans on the institute grounds. Apocalypse offers the mutants an elixir: his own blood, provided they join his side. Bent on becoming the new messiah for mutant-kind, Apocalypse approaches the Earth leaders at the United Nations in New York and issues an ultimatum: humanity would destroy ninety percent of its own population, putting man and mutant on level ground in anticipation of the final conflict when the worthy alone would survive - or Apocalypse would unleash his meta-plague on the planet and obliterate all humanity.|$|E

Their per capita incomes ranged in 2004 from less than $ 250 per year to more than $ 50, 000 (World Bank 2006), {{providing}} significant incentive to migrate {{from one country to}} another for higher wages. The thirty high-income countries had 1 bil-lion residents in 2004, a sixth of the world’s population, and their gross national income was $ 32 trillion, 80 percent of the global $ 40 trillion. 1 The resulting aver-age per capita income of $ 32, 000 was twenty-one times the average $ 1, 500 for the five-sixths of the world’s people in low- and middle-income countries.

His name was often invoked by those criticising his successors like Mbeki and Zuma.

500|$|By 1909, {{the bell}} had made six trips, {{and not only}} had the {{cracking}} become worse, but souvenir hunters had deprived it of over one percent of its weight. When, in 1912, {{the organizers of the}} Panama-Pacific International Exposition requested the bell for the 1915 fair in San Francisco, the city was reluctant to let it travel again. The city finally decided to let it go as the bell had never been west of St. Louis, and it was a chance to bring it to <b>millions</b> <b>who</b> might never see it otherwise. However, in 1914, fearing that the cracks might lengthen during the long train ride, the city installed a metal support structure inside the bell, generally called the [...] "spider." [...] In February 1915, the bell was tapped gently with wooden mallets to produce sounds which were transmitted to the fair as the signal to open it, a transmission which also inaugurated transcontinental telephone service. Some five million Americans saw the bell on its train journey west. It is estimated that nearly two million kissed it at the fair, with an uncounted number viewing it. The bell was taken on a different route on its way home; again, five million saw it on the return journey. Since the bell returned to Philadelphia, it has been moved out of doors only five times: three times for patriotic observances during and after World War I, and twice as the bell occupied new homes in 1976 and 2003. Chicago and San Francisco had obtained its presence after presenting petitions signed by hundreds of thousands of children. Chicago tried again, with a petition signed by 3.4million schoolchildren, for the 1933 Century of Progress Exhibition and New York presented a petition to secure a visit from the bell for the 1939 New York World's Fair. Both efforts failed.|$|E
