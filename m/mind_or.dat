5|$|A {{person is}} disqualified from voting in certain circumstances, which include {{engaging}} in acts incompatible {{with being a}} Singapore citizen, being of unsound <b>mind,</b> <b>or</b> being in prison for committing a criminal offence. The constitutionality of the statutory provisions denying prisoners {{the right to vote}} has not yet become an issue in Singapore, though it has been controversial in some foreign jurisdictions.|$|E
5|$|This was {{a blow to}} the {{short-range}} committee, who {{had made}} good progress on the specification. Despite being technically superior, FACT had not been created with portability in <b>mind</b> <b>or</b> through manufacturer and user consensus. It also lacked a demonstrable implementation, allowing supporters of a FLOW-MATIC-based COBOL to overturn the resolution. RCA representative Howard Bromberg also blocked FACT, so that RCA's work on a COBOL implementation would not go to waste.|$|E
5|$|Eliminativists such as Paul and Patricia Churchland {{argue that}} folk {{psychology}} is a fully developed but non-formalized theory of human behavior. It {{is used to}} explain and make predictions about human mental states and behavior. This view {{is often referred to}} as the theory of <b>mind</b> <b>or</b> just simply theory-theory, for it is a theory which theorizes the existence of an unacknowledged theory. As a theory in the scientific sense, eliminativists maintain, folk psychology needs to be evaluated on the basis of its predictive power and explanatory success as a research program for the investigation of the mind/brain.|$|E

5|$|Like his heroes Swedenborg and Saint-Martin, Balzac {{attempts}} in Louis Lambert {{to construct a}} viable theory to unify spirit and matter. Young Lambert attempts this goal in his Traité de la Volonté, which – having been confiscated by a teacher – is described by the narrator:The word Will he used to connote... the mass of power by which man can reproduce, outside himself, the actions constituting his external life.... The word <b>Mind,</b> <b>or</b> Thought, which he regarded as the quintessential product of the Will, also represented the medium in which the ideas originate to which thought gives substance.... Thus the Will and the Mind were the two generating forces; the Volition and the Idea were the two products. Volition, he thought, was the Idea evolved from the abstract state to a concrete state, from its generative fluid to a solid expression.... According to him, the Mind and Ideas are the motion and the outcome of our inner organization, just as the Will and Volition are of our external activity. He gave the Will precedence over the Mind.The exploration of human will and thought is linked to Balzac's interest in Franz Mesmer, who postulated the theory of animal magnetism, a force flowing among humans. The narrator invokes Mesmer twice in the text, and describes {{a section of the}} Traité de la Volonté which reflects the animal-magnetic theory.|$|E
5|$|Robert Wise was in {{post-production}} on West Side Story {{when he read}} {{a review}} in Time magazine of author Shirley Jackson's novel, The Haunting of Hill House. Wise read the book and found it frightening; he passed it to screenwriter friend Nelson Gidding, whom he had worked with on the 1958 film I Want to Live!. Gidding did a full story treatment for Wise before proceeding {{to work on the}} adaptation. As Gidding crafted the screenplay, he came to believe that the novel was not a ghost story at all, but rather a compilation of the insane thoughts of the lead character, Eleanor Vance. He theorised that Vance was having a nervous breakdown, envisaging a scenario in which Hill House is the hospital where she is held, Markway is her psychiatrist, the cold, banging, and violence are the results of shock treatment, and the opening and closing of doors reflected the opening and closing of hospital doors. Wise and Gidding traveled to Bennington, Vermont to meet Shirley Jackson who told them {{that it was a good}} idea, but the novel was definitely about the supernatural. Nonetheless, elements of the insanity concept remained in the script, so that the audience was left wondering whether the supernatural events in the film were in Eleanor's <b>mind</b> <b>or</b> whether they were real. It was also during their visit with Jackson that Wise and Gidding chose the title for the film. As they did not want to keep the book title, they asked Jackson if she had considered an alternative title. She suggested The Haunting, which Wise and Gidding immediately adopted.|$|E

25|$|In sum, {{a reason}} for the {{division}} between psychiatry and neurology was the distinction between <b>mind</b> <b>or</b> first-person experience and the brain. That this difference is taken to be artificial by proponents of mind/brain monism supports a merge between these specialties.|$|E
25|$|The quantum <b>mind</b> <b>or</b> quantum {{consciousness}} {{group of}} hypotheses propose that classical mechanics cannot explain consciousness.

50|$|A group mind, hive mind, group ego, <b>mind</b> coalescence, <b>or</b> gestalt {{intelligence}} in science fiction is a plot device in which multiple <b>minds,</b> <b>or</b> consciousnesses, are linked into a single, collective consciousness or intelligence. Its use in literature goes {{back at least}} as far as Olaf Stapledon's science fiction novel Last and First Men (1930). A group mind might be formed by any fictional plot device that facilitates brain to brain communication, such as telepathy.|$|R

25|$|Panpsychism is the {{philosophical}} view held by many pantheists that consciousness, <b>mind,</b> <b>or</b> soul {{is a universal}} feature of all things.

25|$|René Descartes {{contrarily}} {{believed that}} non-humans are automata, complex machines with no soul, <b>mind,</b> <b>or</b> reason. In Cartesian dualism, consciousness was unique to human among all other animals and linked to physical matter by divine grace. However, close analysis shows that many human {{features such as}} complex sign usage, tool use, and self-consciousness {{can be found in}} some animals.|$|E
25|$|The {{most famous}} {{aspect of the}} {{production}} is Craig's use of a single, plain set that varied from scene to scene by means of large, abstract screens that altered {{the size and shape}} of the acting area.

25|$|For Sri Aurobindo, <b>Mind</b> <b>or</b> the Mental {{being is}} not simple and uniform, but {{consists}} itself of various strata and subdivisions, which act {{at different levels}} of being. These various faculties are described or variously referred to, usually in obliquely or in passing, in some of his books, including Savitri, which has poetic references to many types of Mind. In his letters answering questions from disciples, Sri Aurobindo summarises the characteristics of the various levels of Mind.|$|E
