In entire male deer {{there is an}} annual oscillation in voluntary food intake, accompa-nied by a severe intake depression during the rut in autumn. This can result in up to a 30 % loss in body weight and almost total depletion of body fat in male deer. In female deer {{there is evidence of}} a seasonal cycle in food intake and live weight, although there is little information on changes in body composition. An experiment was conducted to investigate seasonal changes in body composition in <b>mature</b> <b>fallow</b> does (Dama dama).

40|$|Sexual size {{dimorphism}} may evolve as {{a result}} of both natural and sexual selection. In polygynous mammals, the main factor resulting in the evolution of large body size in males is the advantage conferred during competition for mates. In this study, we examined whether sexual selection acts on body size in <b>mature</b> <b>fallow</b> bucks (Dama dama) by examining how the following traits are inter-related: age, body (skeletal) size, body mass, prerut dominance rank, rut dominance rank and mating success. This is the first study to examine how all these factors are together related to the mating success of a large sexually dimorphic and polygynous mammal. We found that male mating success was directly related to body size, but not to body mass. However body mass was related to prerut dominance rank which was in turn strongly related to rut dominance rank, and thus there was an indirect relationship between mating success and body mass. Rut dominance rank was the variable most strongly related to mating success. Mating success among mature males was unrelated to age. We conclude that larger <b>mature</b> <b>fallow</b> bucks have advantages over other males when competing for matings, and sexual selection therefore continues to act on sexual size dimorphism in this species. Heavier fallow bucks also have advantages, but these are mediated through the dominance ranks attained by males before the rut...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{sustainability}} of traditional farming systems {{in many parts}} of Africa is threatened by losses in the variety of species, reduction in land, forest, soil and water resources under demographic pressure. Together with foreign influences these farming system are no longer in equilibrium with local culture and ecology and are therefore disintegrating {{due to the lack of}} local capacity to adjust to these changes. This has led to environmental degradation. The paper employs a combination of qualitative and quantitative techniques to: analyse the farming systems, assess the effect of cropping intensification on the climatic climax vegetation, and to establish the post-cultivation vegetation successions in fallows. It reports four crop fallow rotations: crop 3 years with 1 year bush fallow, crop 5 years with 1 - 2 year bush fallow, crop 10 years with 1 - 3 year bush fallow and continuous cropping. The post-cultivation successions present a plagioclimax dominated by Hyparhenia species with scattered shrubs maintained by cycles of cultivation and burning. The paper concludes that these shifting cultivation cycles involving cropping intensification and post cultivation savannization have deprived the farming system of its ecological benefits, that is, nutrient recycling through a long and <b>mature</b> <b>fallow.</b> The inability of the vegetation to reconstitute itself requires the development of farming systems that combine trees and crops in the field because of proven micro-ecological and ecological benefits. The paper therefore identifies the scope for the development of ecologically sustainable agro-ecosystems as a development path for shifting cultivation systems...|$|E

This study was carried out on the densities of natural root suckers of S. birrea in three areas (reserved forests, <b>mature</b> and new <b>fallows),</b> as well as on particular characteristics of these root suckers. This up to date study shows that the amount of root suckers in the <b>mature</b> <b>fallows</b> (34. 28 ± 22. 28 root suckers / ha) is significantly superior (p = 0. 005) to those of the new fallows (12. 36 ± 7. 98 root suckers / ha). 41. 1 % of mature S. birrea produces some, and more than 70 % of the mature ones, which root sucker, have 1 to 3 suckers. Half of the root suckers are carried by roots with a diameter between 2 and 4 cm. Under the crown of the mother plants, we can count 41 % of the root suckers, whereas the rest grow in the full light. Less than 17 % escaped by creating adventitious roots. These root suckers ability could be used for woodland management. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{assessment}} of carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) in agro-ecosystems of West African savannas (WAS) {{may be a}} useful tool to define sustainable intensification schemes needed {{to respond to the}} rapid increase in local populations as well as global change issues. Changes in soil properties, and particularly in the soil organic matter status, under semi-permanent cultivation were thus examined through a groundnut crop-fallow chronosequence in southern Senegal. The effect of fallowing was mainly restricted to the 0 - 20 cm soil layer and hardly affected soil physical properties. In this layer, steady improvements were recorded for Mg and Ca contents. Carbon and N amounts increased by 30 %, and by 50 % for available P (POD) within the very first year of fallow and then remained steady (C and N) or dropped back to levels recorded for crops (POD). The rapid initial change in organic status after crop abandonment was attributed to fast recovery of woody vegetation. The steady soil organic matter (SOM) content in oldest fallows compared to young fallows probably resulted from poor protection of soil organic matter from oxidation during biological activity. This hypothesis was confirmed by mesh-bag experiments, which indicated that > 40 - 60 % of decaying woody root biomass disappeared after 6 months of in situ incubation. In fallow systems in southern Senegal, soil fertility may in fact rely at least as much on fast organic matter cycling in soil food webs as on SOM build-up. Carbon storage in the soil-plant system of <b>mature</b> <b>fallow</b> ecosystems was only 27 t C ha(- 1) higher than in crops and consisted mainly of pools with fast turnover. Consequently, the potential of semi-permanent cultivation for C sequestration in the WAS will be rather indirect, by a shift to more intensified practices, thus avoiding the conversion of dense forests to cropping in more humid areas.

40|$|State-of-the-art impact-modeling {{studies in}} {{environmental}} and climatological sciences require detailed future deforestation scenarios that allow forest {{to be replaced}} by a mosaic of multiple successional land-cover types, rather than the simple conversion of forest to a single land-cover type, such as bare soil or cropland. Therefore, not only the amount and location of forest removal has to be known (as is typically provided by scenarios), but also knowledge about the successional land-cover types and their relative areal proportions is needed. The main objective of this study was to identify these successional land-cover types and quantify their areal proportions in regions deforested during the past 37 years around the city of Kisangani, D. R. Congo. The fallow vegetation continuum was categorized in different stages, adapted from existing classifications. Ground-truth points describing the present-day vegetation were obtained during a field campaign and used for supervised and validated land-cover classification of these categories, using the Landsat image of 2012. Areal proportions of successional land-cover types were then derived from the resulting land-cover map. The second objective of this study was to relate these areal proportions to time since deforestation, which is expected to influence fallow landscapes. Landsat images of 1975, 1990, and 2001 were analyzed. Present-day <b>mature</b> tree <b>fallow</b> is less abundant on areas deforested during 1975 – 1990. The relative areal proportions were used to refine a deforestation scenario and apply it to existing data-sets of LAI and canopy height (CH). Assuming a simple conversion of forest to cropland, the deforestation scenario projected a reduction of grid-cell-averaged CH from 25. 5 to 7. 5 m (within deforested cells), whereas the refined scenarios that we propose show more subtle changes, with a reduced CH of 13 m. This illustrates the importance of taking successional land cover correctly into account in environmental and climatological modeling studies. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The {{study was}} carried out in the Cusseque area of the Municipality of Chitembo in south-central Angola. Our {{objectives}} were to assess the floristic diversity, the species composition, and stand structure of Miombo woodlands during regeneration after shifting cultivation. A total of 40 plots of 1000 [*]m 2 were surveyed and analyzed, corresponding to mature forests/woodlands and three fallow types of different age. The analyses were based on plot inventories of all trees with DBH ≥ 5 [*]cm. A total of 51 woody species, 38 genera, and 19 families were recorded. The dominant family was Fabaceae, with subfamily Caesalpinioideae being very abundant. Shannon Diversity and Evenness were highest in mature forests and young <b>fallows,</b> while the <b>mature</b> forest stands showed the highest species richness. A Principal Coordinates Analysis (PCoA) showed many species shared between the intermediate fallow types, but only few species were shared with young <b>fallows.</b> <b>Mature</b> forests formed a clearly distinct group.

40|$|Rodent pests cause major {{economic}} losses to rice crops and inflict health risk {{to people and}} live-stock in villages. Maize-based baits were used traditionally to control ricefield rodents. This study aimed to determine if replacing maize with rice as bait base would increase uptake of zinc phosphide and warfarin wax block baits in <b>maturing</b> rice crops, <b>fallow</b> fields and villages. The study site was in lowland ricefields in Cambodia. Nineteen experimental plots {{were placed in the}} three habitats, with three/four plots treated with zinc phosphide and three with warfarin per habitat. Each plot consisted of five bait points each with rice and maize-based toxic and non-toxic baits. Mean bait uptake was increased by 65 % through replacing maize with rice as the base. Such increase was greater with warfarin being the active ingredient than with zinc phosphide, but both increases were substantial (62 % and 51 %). The increase was high in villages (85 %) and maturing rice crops (79 %), and lower in fallow fields (49 %). We recommend that rice be the base in both baits. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Appropriate pre-sowing {{methods for}} oversowing new plant {{germplasm}} {{and the presence}} of productive legume are of key importance to development of New Zealand hill country. A pastoral fallow, which involves not defoliating pasture for a period generally from spring to autumn, has profound influence on plant and soil, and creates a potentially favourable environment for introducing improved germplasm. A series of field and glasshouse experiments examined the response of pasture structure, soil properties and natural reseeding to pastoral fallow, and the post-fallowing effects on white clover (Trifolium repens L.) and pasture growth in moist North Island hill country, New Zealand. Pastoral fallowing effectively reduced the plant population density and altered the structure of a hill sward. A seven-month (October - May) pastoral fallow dramatically decreased the densities of grass tillers by 72 %, white clover growing points by 87 % and other species by 87 %. The decline in tiller density by pastoral fallow was enhanced on a shady, south facing aspect. Root growth and distribution was altered by pastoral fallowing and there was significantly less root biomass at 0 - 50 mm depth of soil in the fallowed than the grazed sward. Decreased plant density during pastoral fallowing was attributed to above-ground biomass accumulation which altered sward structure, leading to inter-plant competition and mortality by self-thinning and completion of the life circle of some <b>matured</b> plants. Pastoral <b>fallowing</b> significantly improved soil physical properties. Compared with the grazed treatment, pastoral fallow increased soil air permeability at 500 mm tension by 38 %, saturated hydraulic conductivity by 26 %, unsaturated hydraulic conductivity at 20 mm tension by 56 % and soil moisture by 10 - 15 %, and reduced soil bulk density by 11 % {{at the end of an}} October - May pastoral fallow. Pastoral fallow had little effect on the concentration of most nutrients in soil both at the end of fallowing and two to three years after fallowing. A spring - autumn pastoral fallow increased the viable grass, legume and weed seed population by 51 - 160 %, compared with the grazed control. The variation in viable seed population during the fallow followed a predictable pattern, which could be used to manipulate natural reseeding in practice. Regression analysis revealed that the patterns of cumulative seedling appearance followed a modified negative exponential function. Partial differentiation of this function derived a germination rate curve on which a two-pool (rapidly germinable pool and base pool) model was developed to quantitatively describe the seed dynamics of soil viable seed reserves. Short-duration (partial) pastoral fallow had a marked effect on plant population density and natural reseeding. Pastoral fallows starting from December, January and February or March with nitrogen addition and ending in June considerably reduced plant population density. Most partial pastoral fallows also considerably reduced viable seed population of all plant species, except for December to June fallow which had a higher viable grass seed population than the grazed sward. Pastoral fallowing increased dispersion of white clover stolons by internode elongation. At the conclusion of a pastoral fallow, the clover stolons initiated branching, and grasses initiated tillering. Their growth and competition resulted in a greater grass growth rate in the first two years after fallowing, and a greater white clover yield and content with an increase in clover patch density and size 3 - 4 years post-fallowing, compared with the grazed pastures...|$|R
