This is done using historic cash prices from 1988 to 1995, and making inferences about how futures prices would have behaved if they had traded during this sample period. Futures prices are simulated over the sample period based on two assumptions about futures market behavior for fluid milk.

It is divided into research, which includes agriculture and livestock components of organic farming and the practical part, where are the evaluated data obtained from databases ÚZEI, MA and the internal structure of the Faculty of Agriculture, specifically the Department of agro-ecosystems. The part of the research is divided into five main chapters. The introductory chapter describes the history of organic farming. The chapter Changes in {{the structure of}} agriculture, depictes conventional agriculture and an important evenst for the development of agriculture in the territory of the Czech Republic. The following chapter Specifications crop and livestock production enters up the main principles of organic farming.

In order to determine the degree of crystallization of α-lactose monohydrate, the water bound to the crystals (water of crystallization or hydrate water) is calculated as the difference between total moisture and free moisture or non-hydrate water. The free moisture content is determined in a drying oven at 87 or 105 oCat constant weight. The totalmoisture is determined by a newmethod using a vacuum-drying desiccator with dried zeolite powder as a function of temperature, vacuum and time. This newmethod is then compared to the Karl Fishermethod. Results on the percentage of α-lactose monohydrate are also presented for various milk, whey and lactose powders with degrees of crystallinity of α-lactose monohydrate ranging from 0 to 100 %.

40|$|Trabajo presentado en el qPCR & Digital PCR Congress (Developments & Potential of qPCR & dPCR as a Tool for Progressing Molecular Biology Research), celebrado en Lyon (Francia) el 9 y 10 de septiembre de 2013. In the Dairy Industry, {{members of}} the Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB) group are the most {{important}} microorganisms used as starter cultures in the <b>manufacture</b> of <b>milk</b> fermented <b>products,</b> as cheese or yogurt. Starter cultures are responsible for the milk fermentation and confer characteristic flavors and textures to the final products. However, lytic bacteriophages present on the dairy environment can infect and kill the LAB used as starter cultures, which leads the delay and even total failure of the fermentative process. In fact, lytic bacteriophages have been pointed as the leading cause of fermentation failure during the <b>manufacture</b> of fermented <b>milk</b> <b>products</b> and as responsible of the largest-economic losses of the Dairy Industry. To avoid problems associated to bacteriophages, fast and reliable detection methods are needed for the early detection of infective bacteriophages in the milk or at any point during the fermentation procedure. We have developed methods based on the real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) to quickly (30 minutes) detect and quantify bacteriophages that infect Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii, the two LAB species used as starter cultures of yogurt, a dairy product in which phages are particularly fastidious. The low quantification limits of the methods allow the detection of 102 bacteriophages in one microliter of milk, without any previous sample treatment. In addition, the PCR developed methods allow the typification of the detected phages. The rapid quantification and identification of potentially infective bacteriophages in milk is a valuable tool for dairy factories, as they can make fast decisions concerning the destination of the contaminated milk towards processes that are not affected by the detected bacteriophages and even guide a rational rotation of the starter cultures based on their host range.

Mastitis often results such high SCC - besides the potential risk for humans - that the clotting of milk will not be perfect, resulting slack curd with higher whey releasing; furthermore, wrong structure, ripening, bad sensory properties of cheese can also be its consequences. In this paper, we report the SCC of milk samples from five different goat breeds bred in Hungary, measured with two fast methods compared with {{the results from the}} reference method. Furthermore, we investigated the applicability and the accuracy of the MT- 02 (Agro Legato Ltd., Hungary) instrument.

The general summarized average milk SCC was 6. 64 × 105 ml− 1. The highest difference between the results from MT- 02 and the fluorometric (reference) method was 5 × 105 ml− 1, but it was a singular, extreme value. The r 2 of the calculated linear calibration equation was 0. 7819; consequently, this method seems to be applicable in the measurement of SCC with MT- 02 instrument.
