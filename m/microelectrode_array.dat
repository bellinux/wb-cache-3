50|$|Neural {{prostheses}} are {{a series}} of devices that can substitute a motor, sensory or cognitive modality that might have been damaged {{as a result of an}} injury or a disease. Cochlear implants provide an example of such devices. These devices substitute the functions performed by the ear drum and stapes while simulating the frequency analysis performed in the cochlea. A microphone on an external unit gathers the sound and processes it; the processed signal is then transferred to an implanted unit that stimulates the auditory nerve through a <b>microelectrode</b> <b>array.</b> Through the replacement or augmentation of damaged senses, these devices intend to improve the quality of life for those with disabilities.|$|E
50|$|There {{are also}} several {{biological}} responses to implantation of a <b>microelectrode</b> <b>array,</b> particularly {{in regards to}} chronic implantation. Most notable among these effects are neuronal cell loss, glial scarring, and {{a drop in the}} number of functioning electrodes. The tissue response to implantation is dependent among many factors including size of the MEA shanks, distance between the shanks, MEA material composition, and time period of insertion. The tissue response is typically divided into short term and long term response. The short term response occurs within hours of implantation and begins with an increased population of astrocytes and glial cells surrounding the device. The recruited microglia then initiate inflammation and a process of phagocytosis of the foreign material begins. Over time, the astrocytes and microglia recruited to the device begin to accumulate, forming a sheath surrounding the array that extends tens of micrometres around the device. This not only increases the space between electrode probes, but also insulates the electrodes and increases impedance measurements. Problems with chronic implantation of arrays have been a driving force in the research of these devices. One novel study examined the neurodegenerative effects of inflammation caused by chronic implantation. Immunohistochemical markers showed a surprising presence of hyperphosphorylated tau, an indicator of Alzheimer's disease, near the electrode recording site. The phagocytosis of electrode material also brings to question the issue of a biocompatibility response, which research suggests has been minor and becomes almost nonexistent after 12 weeks in vivo. Research to minimize the negative effects of device insertion includes surface coating of the devices with proteins that encourage neuron attachment, such as laminin, or drug eluting substances.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In the paper, {{in order}} to {{overcome}} machining limits in throughput and precision because of positioning error and tool wear of a single tool electrode, a method for the <b>microelectrode</b> <b>array</b> fabrication by micro-WEDM is described and assessed. Characteristics of the <b>microelectrode</b> <b>array</b> fabrication by micro-WEDM, such as machining open voltage, pulse peak current, discharge duration and servo feed rate so on, are investigated {{through a series of}} experiments. A 10 × 10 squared electrode array is machined by micro-WEDM and the width of each squared electrode is about 40 µm. The <b>microelectrode</b> <b>array</b> with good quality is obtained by applying decreased open voltage and peak current, increased discharge duration and optimized machining speed. Then micro hole-array is processed by applying obtained electrode array in micro-EDM method. The diameter of each squared hole in the array is about 50 µm due to appropriate control strategy that per micro pulse energy is decreased and periodic jump-down is applied during the machining process.

40|$|The {{diffusion}} domain {{approach is}} a general framework for the understanding, interpretation and prediction of the response of <b>microelectrode</b> <b>arrays.</b> This work exposes some of its limitations, particularly when dealing with nanoelectrode arrays of a few microns in size. This article {{provides an overview of}} the principles and assumptions underpinning the diffusion domain approach, and then applies it to the study of nanoelectrode arrays. The apparent disagreement between theory and experimental data, due to the importance of radial diffusion to nanoelectrode <b>arrays</b> compared to <b>microelectrode</b> <b>arrays,</b> is explained using simulations and experiments. The principle that an array of micro- or nano-electrodes eventually behaves as if the entire array were a single electrode {{of the size of the}} array, with its corresponding properties, applies always. However, while <b>microelectrode</b> <b>arrays</b> tend to behave as macroelectrodes, nanoelectrode arrays on the other hand may behave as microelectrodes. For the case of arrays of small numbers of electrodes, or array sizes of microns or less in size, this compromises one of the key assumptions of the diffusion domain approach, namely that inner electrodes in an array are equivalent, which may lead the unaware to erroneous conclusions.

40|$|<b>Microelectrode</b> <b>arrays</b> find broad {{application}} in electroanalysis offering the enhanced sensitivity associated with microelectrodes, {{but with a}} high total current output. Such arrays are often constructed to make the electrodes ‘diffusionally independent’. To emphasize {{that this is a}} time dependent property, a two-dimensional simulation, in conjunction with the diffusional domain approach, is used to model potential step transient currents at <b>microelectrode</b> <b>arrays.</b> Two types of array, hexagonal and cubic, are considered. In both cases the absolute (not relative) microelectrode separation distance has a significant effect on transient current. Three different regimes of transient current versus time can be observed at <b>microelectrode</b> <b>arrays.</b> At short times the transient response of isolated microelectrodes is seen, then at intermediate times the steady-state response of independent electrodes can be observed. At longer times planar diffusion to the entire array takes over. It follows that only at timescales corresponding to the first two regimes can the electrodes be considered as diffusionally independent. To verify the theory the potential step experiment is performed at a regularly spaced hexagonal iridium microdisk array. Theory is found to be in a good agreement with the experimental results.

50|$|The {{three major}} {{categories}} of implantable MEAs are microwire, silicon- based, and flexible <b>microelectrode</b> <b>arrays.</b> Microwire MEAs are largely made {{of stainless steel}} or tungsten {{and they can be}} used to estimate the position of individual recorded neurons by triangulation. Silicon-based <b>microelectrode</b> <b>arrays</b> include two specific models: the Michigan and Utah arrays. Michigan arrays allow a higher density of sensors for implantation as well as a higher spatial resolution than microwire MEAs. They also allow signals to be obtained {{along the length of the}} shank, rather than just at the ends of the shanks. In contrast to Michigan arrays, Utah arrays are 3-D, consisting of 100 conductive silicon needles. However, in a Utah array signals are only received from the tips of each electrode, which limits the amount of information that can be obtained at one time. Furthermore, Utah arrays are manufactured with set dimensions and parameters while the Michigan array allows for more design freedom. Flexible arrays, made with polyimide, parylene, or benzocyclobutene, provide an advantage over rigid <b>microelectrode</b> <b>arrays</b> because they provide a closer mechanical match, as the Young's modulus of silicon is much larger than that of brain tissue, contributing to shear-induced inflammation.|$|R

Homogeneous poly(o-phenylenediamine) films of - 40 nm thickness formed at the surfaces of screen printed carbon electrodes via the anodic electropolymerisation of o-phenylenediamine are shown to serve as effective diffusional barriers, thus insulating the underlying carbon electrodes. <b>Microelectrode</b> <b>arrays</b> formed by the sonochemical ablation of such films to expose microscopic areas of the underlying conductive substrates are seen to possess electrode element populations of - 7. 3 x 104 cm 2.
