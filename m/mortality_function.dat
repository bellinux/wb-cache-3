40|$|AbstractThe Gompertz law of {{mortality}} quantitatively describes {{the mortality rate}} of humans and almost all multicellular animals. However, its underlying kinetic mechanism is unclear. The Gompertz law cannot explain the mortality plateau at advanced ages and cannot give an explicit relationship between temperature and mortality. In this study a reaction kinetics model with a time dependent rate coefficient is proposed to describe the survival and senescence processes. A temperature-dependent <b>mortality</b> <b>function</b> was derived. The new <b>mortality</b> <b>function</b> becomes the Gompertz <b>mortality</b> <b>function</b> with the same relationship of parameters prescribed by the Strehler–Mildvan correlation when age is smaller than a characteristic value δ, and reaches the mortality plateau when age is greater than δ. A closed-form analytical expression for describing the relationship of average lifespan with temperature and other equations are derived from the new <b>mortality</b> <b>function.</b> The derived equations {{can be used to}} estimate the limit of average lifespan, predict the maximal longevity, calculate the temperature coefficient of lifespan, and explain the tendency of the survival curve. This prediction is consistent with the most recently reported mortality trajectories for single-year birth cohorts. This study suggests that the senescence process results from the imbalance between damaging energy and protecting energy for the critical chemical substance in the body. The rate of senescence of the organism increases while the protecting energy decreases. The mortality plateau is reached when the protecting energy decreases to its minimal levels. The decreasing rate of the protecting energy is temperature-dependent. This study is exploring the connection between the biochemical mechanism and demography...|$|E

40|$|Structural refuges {{within which}} prey can escape from predators {{can be an}} {{important}} limiting resource for the prey. In a manner that resembles the childhood game of musical chairs, many prey species rapidly retreat to shared, unguarded refuges whenever a predator threatens, and only when refuges are relatively abundant do all prey individuals actually escape. The key feature of this process is that the per capita prey mortality rate depends on the ratio of prey individuals to refuges.

40|$|Successional {{dynamics}} of forests under current and changed climate are often investigated using gap models, {{a subset of}} forest succession models that simulate establishment, growth, and mortality of trees. However, the mortality submodels of gap models are largely based on theoretical assumptions, and have not been tested in detail. In the present study, we compared {{the performance of a}} range of theoretical <b>mortality</b> <b>functions</b> (TMFs) that are commonly used in gap models with several empirical <b>mortality</b> <b>functions</b> (EMFs) that were derived using logistic regression from growth patterns of tree-ring series as predictor variables. Data from dead and living Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) trees from subalpine forests at three study sites in Switzerland were used to this end. Three of the four EMFs consistently performed better at all three sites, while three of the four TMFs performed worse than the remaining <b>mortality</b> <b>functions.</b> At one site, these three EMFs correctly classified 71 – 78 % of the dead trees (48 – 72 % for the three TMFs) and 73 % (49 – 64 %) of the living trees. 44 – 54 % (21 – 25 %) of the dead trees were predicted to die within 15 years prior to death. 0 – 2 % (7 – 10 %) of the dead trees and 5 % (19 – 31 %) of the living trees were predicted to die more than 60 years prior to the last measured year. We conclude that, unless the parameters of the TMFs are optimized for individual species, the TMFs are not appropriate to predict the time of tree death, in spite of their widespread use. A substantial change in simulated forest succession is to be expected if the currently implemented TMFs in gap models are replaced by species-specific EMFs...|$|R
40|$|Infection {{caused by}} {{parasitic}} nematodes {{of humans and}} livestock can have significant health and economic costs.

However, using mathematical models of long-lasting interventions, such as vaccination, and regularly repeated short interventions, such as drenching, we show here that the expected outcome actually depends on how mortality rates vary as a function of worm size and developmental status. Interventions which change <b>mortality</b> <b>functions</b> can exert selection pressure to either shorten or extend the time to maturity, and thus increase or decrease worm fecundity and size.

The difference is more than an order of magnitude. We argue for a YOLL valuation on the grounds of economic rationality. For the implementation there is a difficulty: the relation between E-R (exposure-response) <b>functions</b> for <b>mortality</b> and YOLL is not clear. Whereas a YOLL calculation eeds variations in life expectancy (inverse of population mortality rate), acute <b>mortality</b> E-R <b>functions</b> (based on time series analysis) report variations in daily death counts, and chronic <b>mortality</b> E-R <b>functions</b> (based on cohort studies) report variations in age-specific mortality.

Recent aspen mortality {{has been linked to}} drought stress and elevated temperatures characteristic of conditions expected under climate change, but the role of individual aspen tree growth patterns in contributing to recent tree mortality is less well known. We used tree-ring data to investigate the relationship between an individual aspen tree 2 ̆ 7 s lifetime growth patterns and mortality. Surviving aspen trees had consistently higher average growth rates for at least 100 years than dead trees. Contrary to observations from late successional species, slow initial growth rates were not associated with a longer lifespan in aspen. Aspen trees that died had slower lifetime growth and slower growth at various stages of their lives than those that survived. Differences in average diameter growth between live and dead trees were significant (? = 0. 05) across all time periods tested.
