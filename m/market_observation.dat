40|$|The {{central theme}} of this thesis is to develop methods of {{financial}} mathematics to understand the dynamics of a firm’s capital structure through <b>observations</b> of <b>market</b> prices of liquid securities written on the firm. Just as stock prices are a direct measure of a firm’s equity, other liquidly traded products such as options and credit default swaps (CDS) should also be indicators of aspects of a firm’s capital structure.

The more appropriate assumption is the fractional recovery of par, which explicitly violates the strippable cash flow valuation assumption that is necessary for the conventional credit term structure definitions to hold.

Our empirical findings show that whatever types of warrants, such as American or European warrants, call or put warrants, ordinary type or reset type warrants, higher news coverage of a company, securities companies are more likely to issue its warrants and issue more warrants. Additionally, warrant issuance probabilities are higher for underlying stocks with high stock returns, high shareholding proportions of directors and supervisors, low book to market ratio and low stock weekly turnover rates.

Next to the economic challenges, there are equally important factors that hinder renovating the existing residential building stock and adding newly constructed high performance buildings. Under these circumstances this paper summarises the findings of a cross-comparative study of the societal and technical barriers of nZEB implementation in 7 Southern European countries. The study analyses the present situation and provides an overview on future prospects for nZEB in Southern Europe. The result presents an overview of challenges and provides recommendations based on available empirical evidence to further lower those barriers in the European construction sector. The paper finds that the most Southern European countries are poorly prepared for nZEB implementation and especially to the challenge/opportunity of retrofitting existing buildings.

We provide a threshold estimation under the general equilibrium framework. The Keynes-Einzig conjecture based on <b>market</b> <b>observation</b> is verified. Within thresholds, the momentum effect holds. The behavioural finance applies as the aggregated data are used. Outside thresholds, the random process is shown from our general equilibrium estimation. Our estimations show that the CIP deviation is nonstationary within thresholds for some countries. It contradicts to the limit of arbitrages and other market frictions for the threshold trading. The robustness test has been performed to reconfirm our results based on the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) criterion. The implication shows that the trend-following exists within thresholds and the directionless moving as the threshold is reached. Behind our estimation, {{it shows that the}} threshold forms a new equilibrium. As the nonparametric general equilibrium is pursued, the interactive effects behind the parameters estimation are also discussed.

40|$|We {{consider}} the component-purchasing {{problem for a}} supply chain consisting of one retailer and two complementary suppliers with different lead-times. The retailer purchases a specific component from each supplier for assembling into a fashionable product. After ordering from the long-lead-time supplier (Supplier 1) and before ordering from the short-lead-time supplier (Supplier 2), the retailer can update its demand forecast for the product. The retailer can partially cancel its order from Supplier 1 after forecast updating. By formulating the problem as a dynamic optimization problem, we explore the measures that can be deployed to coordinate the retailer's ordering decisions with forecast updating. We analytically show that the supply chain can be coordinated if both suppliers offer a returns policy and Supplier 1 charges an order-cancelation penalty to the retailer. We find that the coordination mechanism is independent of demand distribution and the forecast updating process. We further show that {{it is easier for}} the suppliers to coordinate the supply chain if <b>market</b> <b>observation</b> indicates the future market demand is sufficiently large. We also study the case where demand is price-dependent and propose a generalized revenue-sharing contract to coordinate the supply chain.

40|$|The multivariate {{lognormal}} {{model is}} a basic pricing model for derivatives with multiple underlying processes, for example, spread options. However, the <b>market</b> <b>observation</b> of implied correlation skew examplifies how inaccurate the constant correlation assumption in the multivariate lognormal model can be. In this paper, we study alternative modeling approaches that generate implied correlation skews {{while at the same}} time maintain practical tractability. First, we propose a multiscale stochastic volatility model, and derive asymptotic formulas for option valuation and implied correlation. The {{model is a}} two-dimensional extension of the multiscale stochastic volatility model proposed in [20] which was tested on single underlying options. To obtain option valuations, we only need to calibrate a set of special parameters, and we propose a calibration procedure using option prices on individual underlying assets. From our simulated results, the multiscale stochastic volatility model generates implied correlation skews, and the asymptotic formulas are easy and fast to implement. However, in the multiscale stochastic volatility model, the stochastic volatilities introduce non-tradable sources of risk, and the market is no longer complete. Alternatively, we propose a local correlation model, which assumes the instantaneous correlation to be a deterministic function of time and the underlying prices. This model can be viewed as a two-dimensional extension of Dupire’s local volatility model. The local correlation approach preserves the completeness of the market and low dimensionality of uncertainty...|$|E

The Hybrid User Forum is an independent {{part of the project}} – with a neutral organisation and moderation outside the formal project consortium. As the user group for buses have specific conditions for operation (usually under public control), there is a section of the Hybrid User Forum specific to buses. In parallel, the truck section gathers both operators and some public agencies (e. g. from waste collection). One task of the Hybrid User Forum is the analysis of market obstacles. Expectations and – where it exists – practical experience can be compared to the expected outcomes of the HCV project through a series of questionnaires. The needs in terms of vehicle size and performance (e. g. for special operational conditions) can be analysed and also compared with the expected outcomes of the HCV project and in particular with the demonstrators. Both the bus and truck sections have an annual workshop including demonstrations and extensive exchange between users and potential users of hybrid commercial vehicles and HCV representatives.
