40|$|Regular {{therapy with}} the radiolabeled {{somatostatin}} analog 177 Lu-octreotate (22. 2 – 29. 6 GBq) {{in patients with}} gastroentero-pancreatic or bronchial neuroendocrine tumors results in tumor remission in 46 % of patients, including <b>minor</b> <b>response.</b> We pres-ent the effects of additional therapy with 177 Lu-octreotate in pa-tients in whom progressive disease developed after an initial benefit from regular therapy. Methods: Thirty-three patients with progressive disease after an initial radiologic or clinical re-sponse were treated with additional cycles of 177 Lu-octreotate. The intended cumulative dose of additional therapy was 14. 8 GBq in 2 cycles. Responses were evaluated using Southwest Oncology Group criteria, including <b>minor</b> <b>response</b> (tumor size reduction of $ 25 % and, 50 %). Results: Median time to pro-gression (TTP) after regular therapy was 27 mo. In 4 patients, the intended cumulative dose was not achieved (2 had progres-sive disease, 2 had long-lasting thrombocytopenia). Hemato-logic toxicity grade 3 was observed in 4 patients, and grade 4, in 1. The median follow-up time was 16 mo (range, 1 – 40 mo). No kidney failure or myelodysplastic syndrome was observed. Renewed tumor regression was observed in 8 patients (2 partial remission, 6 <b>minor</b> <b>response),</b> and 8 patients had stable disease. Median TTP was 17 mo. Treatment outcome was less favorable in patients with a short TTP after regular cycles. Treatment ef-fects in patients with pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors {{were similar to those}} in patients with other gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors. Conclusion: Most patients tolerated additional cycles with 177 Lu-octreotate well. None developed se-rious delayed adverse events. Additional cycles with 177 Lu-octreotate can have antitumor effects, but effects were less than for the regular cycles. This may be because of a worse clin-ical condition, more extensive tumor burden, or changed tumor characteristics. We conclude that this salvage therapy can be ef-fective and is safe...|$|E

40|$|We {{undertook}} a phase 1 study of Carboplatin (CBDCA) on an intermittent single intravenous (IV) bolus (schedule A) and a 24 -hour continuous infusion schedule (schedule B). Hydration and forced diuresis were not performed. Patients were not premedicated for anticipated vomiting. Thirty-eight adult patients with solid tumors received {{a total of}} 71 courses. In schedule A, doses were escalated from 20 to 600 mg/m 2. The dose-limiting toxicity was myelosuppression. At doses of 270 mg/m 2 and higher, leukopenia and thrombocytopenia were reproducibly seen. The dose of 600 mg/m 2 was the maximally tolerated dose, producing severe thrombocytopenia (platelet counts less than 30, 000 /microL). Other toxicities included a fall in hemoglobin levels and tolerable nausea and vomiting. Schedule B produced comparable hematologic and emetogenic toxicities to those in schedule A.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We investigated 145 mg/m(2) SU 5416 twice weekly in patients with advanced or metastatic RCC, M, and STS. The primary objectives were efficacy and safety. Disease assessments were performed after 4 and 8 weeks of treatment and every 2 months thereafter. Documented stable disease (SD) lasting for > or = 3 months was considered an antitumor response. RESULTS: A group of 29 patients was entered in the RCC trial, 20 patients in the M trial, and 31 patients in the STS trial.

40|$|Purpose The {{primary goal}} {{of this study was}} to {{evaluate}} whether pathologic response to chemotherapy predicts patient survival after preoperative chemotherapy and resection of colorectal liver metastases (CLM). The secondary goal of the study was to identify the clinical predictors of pathologic response. Patients and Methods A retrospective review was performed of 305 patients who underwent preoperative irinotecan- or oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy, followed by resection of CLM. Pathologic response was systematically evaluated and reported as the mean of the percentage of cancer cells remaining within each tumor. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify the predictors of pathologic response and survival. Results Cumulative 5 -year overall survival rates by pathologic response status were as follows: 75 % complete response (no residual cancer cells), 56 % major response (1 % to 49 % residual cancer cells), and 33 % <b>minor</b> <b>response</b> (≥ 50 % residual cancer cells; complete v major response, P =. 037; major v <b>minor</b> <b>response,</b> P =. 028). Multivariate analysis revealed that only surgical margin status (P =. 050; hazard ratio [HR], 1. 77) and pathologic response (major response: P =. 034; HR, 4. 80; minor response: P =. 007; HR, 6. 93) were independent predictors of survival. Multivariate analysis of the predictors of pathologic response revealed that carcinoembryonic antigen level ≤ 5 ng/mL, tumor size ≤ 3 cm, and chemotherapy with fluoropyrimidine plus oxaliplatin and bevacizumab were independent predictors of pathologic response. Conclusion Pathologic response predicts survival after preoperative chemotherapy and resection of CLM. Degree of pathologic response represents a new outcome end point for prognosis after resection of CLM. PublishedN/...|$|E
40|$|ObjectiveTo {{improve the}} {{prognosis}} of cN 2, N 3 non–small cell lung cancer, we performed induction chemoradiotherapy (carboplatin-taxane chemotherapy and concurrent 50 -Gy radiation) followed by surgery. MethodsPatients with pathologically proven non–small cell lung cancer with bulky cN 2, N 3 disease were enrolled. Forty-one patients underwent an operation after chemoradiotherapy from January 2000 to April 2006. Either carboplatin-paclitaxel (n = 19) or carboplatin-docetaxel (n = 22) chemotherapy was randomly used. Two cycles of chemotherapy were performed with concurrent radiation (50 Gy). In all cases, conventional radiological reevaluations were performed; in the latest 21 cases, reevaluations with positron-emission tomography with fludeoxyglucose F 18 were also performed. ResultsIn all 41 cases, complete resections were performed, with no operative mortality. The histologically complete response rate, major response rate, and <b>minor</b> <b>response</b> rate were 17. 1 % (7 / 41), 56. 1 % (23 / 41), and 26. 8 % (11 / 41), respectively. The 5 -year overall survival was 52. 7 %. There were no differences in survival between taxane groups. Both the complete response and the major response groups revealed a significantly better 5 -year survivals than the <b>minor</b> <b>response</b> group (85. 7 %, P =. 044, 52. 4 %, P =. 01). Even with persistent N 2 disease, the 5 -year survival in the major response group (66 %) was promising.

Secondary efficacy endpoints included progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). No confirmed objective responses occurred among the 24 evaluable patients (ORR =  0 % [95 % CI: 0 - 14 %]) and the study was terminated at the first stage. <b>Minor</b> <b>responses</b> (tumor regression less than 30 %) were seen in eleven of 24 (45 %) patients. The median PFS was 4 months [95 % CI: 1 - 6 months] and the 6 -month PFS was 29 % [95 % CI: 13 %- 48 %]. The median OS was 11 months [95 % CI: 7 - 14 months]. In this study, the overall efficacy of CP plus sorafenib in metastatic uveal melanoma did not warrant further clinical testing when assessed by ORR, although <b>minor</b> tumor <b>responses</b> and stable disease were observed in some patients.

40|$|Aberrant activations of Fms-like {{tyrosine}} {{receptor kinase}} (FLT) 3 are {{implicated in the}} pathogenesis of 20 % to 30 % of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). G- 749 is a novel FLT 3 inhibitor that showed potent and sustained inhibition of the FLT 3 wild type and mutants including FLT 3 -ITD, FLT 3 -D 835 Y, FLT 3 -ITD/N 676 D, and FLT 3 -ITD/F 691 L in cellular assays. G- 749 retained its inhibitory potency in various drug-resistance milieus such as patient plasma, FLT 3 ligand surge, and stromal protection. Furthermore, it displayed potent antileukemic activity in bone marrow blasts from AML patients regardless of FLT 3 mutation status, including those with little or only <b>minor</b> <b>responses</b> to AC 220 or PKC 412. Oral administration of G- 749 yielded complete tumor regression and increased life span in animal models. Thus, G- 749 {{appears to be a}} promising next-generation drug candidate for the treatment of relapsed and refractory AML patients with various FLT 3 -ITD/FLT 3 -TKD mutants and further shows the ability to overcome drug resistance. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Objective: Optic pathway/hypothalamic astrocytomas (OPHA) {{in young}} {{children}} often show accelerated growth and require rather intensive induction chemotherapy. Methods: Fifteen children (median age: 3 years) with a large OPHA were treated. All of them presented with progressive disease, and the tumor size was larger than 34 mm. Pilocytic astrocytoma was confirmed histologically in 10 patients. Eleven patients had visual disturb-ance, six had diencephalic syndrome and four had hydrocephalus. Results: The children received six to eight cycles of cisplatin (20 mg/m 2 : days 1 – 5) and vin-cristine (1. 4 mg/m 2 : days 1, 8, 15), every 4 weeks. Objective response was obtained in 11 patients (73 %); one complete response, eight partial <b>responses</b> and two <b>minor</b> <b>responses.</b> Although the remaining four cases were evaluated as stable disease, all tumors decreased in volume. All children tolerated the chemotherapy well under careful audiological monitoring. Conclusion: Although the present series was small, this chemotherapy is a useful regimen for induction therapy in children with an aggressive deep-seated pilocytic astrocytoma.
