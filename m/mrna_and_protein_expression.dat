Another group with sham operation was set as control. All rats were administered with corresponding drugs for 3 weeks. After the last administration, each rat was sacrificed and weighed and the serum was separated for creatinine (Cr) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) detection. Kidneys of the rats were taken out, <b>and</b> <b>mRNA</b> <b>and</b> <b>protein</b> <b>expressions</b> of TGF-β, smad 2, smad 7 and CTGF were measured with real-time fluorescent quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting respectively; fibrosis of the kidney tissue was observed with hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining and Masson trichrome staining. Results: Compared with sham-operation group, Cr and BUN in serum of UUO groups were increased, while high-dose YQHXF treatment decreased the UUO-induced increase of Cr and BUN levels. HE staining and Masson staining {{results showed that the}} renal tubular epithelial cells in untreated group got atrophied; lumens of renal tubules expanded; fibroplastic proliferation and inflammatory cell infiltration were observed in renal interstitium; the number of glomerulus decreased and collagen increased significantly compared with sham-operation group. In the high- and medium-dose YQHXF groups and fosinopril sodium group, the histopathological changes of inflammatory cell infiltration, fibroplastic proliferation, expansion of lumens of renal tubules was improved as compared with the untreated group. The <b>mRNA</b> <b>and</b> <b>protein</b> <b>expressions</b> of TGF-β, smad 2 and CTGF in untreated group were higher than those in sham-operation group (P＜ 0. 05), <b>and</b> the <b>mRNA</b> <b>and</b> <b>protein</b> <b>expressions</b> of smad 7 in untreated group were lower than those in the sham-operation group (P＜ 0. 05).

Since early oligonucleotide microarray studies in liver of cholesterol-fed mice showed an AQP 8 downregulation, we tested whether alterations of cholesterol content per se modulate mtAQP 8 expression in human hepatocyte-derived Huh- 7 cells. Cholesterol loading with methyl-β-cyclodextrin (mβCD) :cholesterol complexes downregulated the proteolytic activation of cholesterol-responsive sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) transcriptions factors 1 and 2, and the expression of the target gene 3 -hydroxy- 3 -methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGCR).

FGF21 treatment induced <b>mRNA</b> <b>and</b> <b>protein</b> <b>expression</b> of PGC-1α, but in mice PGC-1α expression was not necessary for the effect of FGF21 on glucose metabolism.|$|E
5000|$|Genenetwork {{started as}} {{component}} of the NIH Human Brain Project in 1999 {{with a focus on}} the genetic analysis of brain structure and function. This international program consists of tightly integrated genome and phenome data sets for human, mouse, and rat that are designed specifically for large-scale systems and network studies relating gene variants to differences in <b>mRNA</b> <b>and</b> <b>protein</b> <b>expression</b> and to differences in CNS structure and behavior. The great majority of data are open access. GeneNetwork has a companion neuroimaging web site—the Mouse Brain Library—that contains high resolution images for thousands of genetically defined strains of mice.|$|E
40|$|The {{process of}} {{osteoclast}} differentiation and resorption is fine-tuned by signal pathways, which {{need to be}} further elucidated. The {{aim of this study}} was to explore the possible connections between NF-kappa B and Notch in RANKL-induced osteoclast activity. To this end, RANKL was used to stimulate mouse osteoclast precursor cell line RAW 264. 7. The number of multinucleated TRAP(+) osteoclasts was counted and the resorption area was measured. NF-kappa B transcriptional factor activity was determined by EMSA. Quantitative RT-PCR and Western blotting analysis were used to determine Hes 1 (one of Notch signaling primary targets) <b>mRNA</b> <b>and</b> <b>protein</b> <b>expressions</b> respectively. Mature osteoclasts and bone resorption areas were detected in the present study. NF-kappa B activity was increased in RANKL-induced osteoclast differentiation <b>and</b> resorption. <b>mRNA</b> <b>and</b> <b>protein</b> <b>expressions</b> of Hes 1 in RAW 264. 7 cells were up-regulated after RANKL stimulation. In conclusion, NF-kappa B signaling mediated RANKL-induced osteoclast differentiation and resorption, during which, Notch signaling was activated. Therefore, Notch could be a novel therapeutic target for bone resorption related diseases...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{observe the}} effects of Huanglian Jiedu Decoction (HLJDD), a {{traditional}} Chinese compound herbal medicine, on p 85 <b>mRNA</b> <b>and</b> <b>protein</b> <b>expressions</b> of phosphatidylinositol- 3 -kinase (PI- 3 K) in target tissues (skeletal muscular and adipose tissues) in rats with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T 2 DM) and to investigate the molecular mechanism of HLJDD in treating T 2 DM. Methods: The male Wistar rats were injected with streptozotocin (STZ) 30 mg/kg through tail vein, and fed with high-fat and high-caloric diets to induce T 2 DM. Then the rats were randomly divided into untreated group, aspirin-treated group and HLJDD group, and treated correspondingly. Meanwhile, a group of normal animals without any treatment was set up for normal control group. Ten weeks later, serum fasting blood glucose (FBG), serum fasting insulin (FINS) and oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) were routinely determined. The expressions of PI- 3 K p 85 <b>mRNA</b> <b>and</b> <b>protein</b> in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue were determined with RT-PCR and Western blotting before and after insulin treatment. Results: Compared with the untreated group, the FBG and OGTT levels in T 2 DM rats treated with HLJDD decreased significantly (P＜ 0. 05). The FINS in HLJDD group was lower than that in the normal control group (P＜ 0. 05), but was {{not significantly different from}} that in the untreated group. The PI- 3 K p 85 <b>mRNA</b> <b>and</b> <b>protein</b> <b>expressions</b> in HLJDD group obviously increased, as compared with those in the untreated group. Conclusion: The effect of HLJDD in treating T 2 DM was probably associated with its improvement of PI- 3 K p 85 <b>mRNA</b> <b>and</b> <b>protein</b> <b>expressions</b> in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue of the T 2 DM rats...|$|R
