40|$|In Standing Committee on Discipline of the United States District Court for the Central District of California v. Yagman, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals {{held that}} an {{attorney}} who publicly criticized a federal judge did not commit sanctionable conduct. In determining whether the attorney, Stephen Yagman, had violated a local {{rule of professional conduct}} for lawyers, the court applied a 2 ̆ 2 reasonable attorney 2 ̆ 2 standard, rather than a subjective malice standard. The court held that Yagman 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>statements,</b> in light of this higher standard, did not violate the rule 2 ̆ 7 s prohibition against impugning the integrity of the court. The Ninth Circuit also held that the attorney 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>statements</b> did not violate the rule 2 ̆ 7 s prohibition against attorneys interfering with the administration of justice. In finding no interference with the administration of justice the Ninth Circuit announced a new standard. Under this new standard the attorney 2 ̆ 7 s conduct must pose a 2 ̆ 2 clear and present danger 2 ̆ 2 to the administration of justice to be sanctionable. This note examines the Ninth Circuit 2 ̆ 7 s analysis of Yagman 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>statements</b> and questions whether the newly-created 2 ̆ 2 clear and present danger 2 ̆ 2 standard is stringent enough to prevent attorneys from forum shopping.

40|$|In Lilly v. Virginia, the Supreme Court {{once again}} has the {{opportunity}} to grapple with the meaning of the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendmel). t. The basic facts of Lilly are simple, for they present the ageold problem of accomplice confessions. Three men, Gary Barker and Ben and Mark Lilly, went on a crime spree, during which one of them shot to death a young man they had robbed and kidnaped. Ben Lilly was charged with being the triggerman, and Barker testified to that effect at Ben 2 ̆ 7 s trial. Mark did not testify. But Mark had made a statement to the police shortly after the trio was apprehended, and he also identified his brother Ben as the triggerman. Mark 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>statement</b> was introduced over Ben 2 ̆ 7 s objection. Ben was convicted. The Virginia Supreme Court upheld the conviction, treating Mark 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>statement</b> as a declaration against penal interest, 499 S. E. 2 d 522 (1998), and the U. S.
