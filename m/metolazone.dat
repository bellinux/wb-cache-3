25|$|<b>Metolazone</b> {{may also}} be used in renal (kidney) disease, such as chronic renal failure or the {{nephrotic}} syndrome. Chronic renal failure causes excess fluid retention that is often treated with diet adjustments and diuretics. <b>Metolazone</b> may be combined with other diuretics (typically loop diuretics) to treat diuretic resistance in CHF, chronic renal failure, and nephrotic syndrome. <b>Metolazone</b> and a loop diuretic will synergistically enhance diuresis {{over the use of}} either agent alone. Using this combination, diuretic effects will occur at two different segments of the nephron; namely, the loop diuretic will act at the loop of Henle, and <b>metolazone</b> will act at the distal convoluted tubule. <b>Metolazone</b> is frequently prescribed in addition to the loop diuretic. <b>Metolazone</b> may be used for edema caused by liver cirrhosis as well.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the primary}} uses of <b>metolazone</b> is for {{treating}} edema (fluid retention) associated with congestive heart failure (CHF). In mild heart failure, <b>metolazone</b> or another diuretic may be used alone, or combined with other diuretics for moderate or severe heart failure. In addition to preventing fluid buildup, the use of <b>metolazone</b> may allow the patient to relax the amount of sodium restriction that is required. Although most thiazide diuretics lose their effectiveness in renal failure, <b>metolazone</b> remains active even when the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is below 30â€“40 mL/min (moderate renal failure) (Citation needed). This gives it a considerable advantage over other thiazide diuretics, since renal and heart failure often coexist and contribute to fluid retention.|$|E
25|$|<b>Metolazone</b> is a thiazide-like {{diuretic}} marketed {{under the}} brand names Zytanix from Zydus Cadila, Zaroxolyn, and Mykrox. It is primarily {{used to treat}} congestive heart failure and high blood pressure. <b>Metolazone</b> indirectly decreases {{the amount of water}} reabsorbed into the bloodstream by the kidney, so that blood volume decreases and urine volume increases. This lowers blood pressure and prevents excess fluid accumulation in heart failure. <b>Metolazone</b> is sometimes used together with loop diuretics such as furosemide or bumetanide, but these highly effective combinations can lead to dehydration and electrolyte abnormalities.|$|E
25|$|<b>Metolazone</b> is only {{available}} in oral preparations. Approximately 65% {{of the amount}} ingested becomes available in the bloodstream. Its half-life is approximately fourteen hours, similar to indapamide but considerably longer than hydrochlorothiazide. <b>Metolazone</b> is around ten times as potent as hydrochlorothiazide. The primary form of excretion is in the urine (around 80%); the remaining fifth is evenly split between biliary excretion and metabolism into inactive forms.|$|E
25|$|Since thiazide diuretics {{affect the}} {{transport}} of electrolytes and water in the kidney, they can be responsible for abnormalities of water balance and electrolyte levels. Removal of too much fluid can cause volume depletion and hypotension. Various electrolyte abnormalities may result, including hyponatremia (low sodium), hypokalemia (low potassium), hypochloremia (low chloride), hypomagnesemia (low magnesium), hypercalcemia (high calcium), and hyperuricemia (high uric acid). These may result in dizziness, headache, or heart arrhythmias (palpitations). Serious, though rare, side effects include aplastic anemia, pancreatitis, agranulocytosis, and angioedema. <b>Metolazone,</b> like other thiazide diuretics, may unmask latent diabetes mellitus or exacerbate gout, especially by interacting with medicines used to treat gout. In addition, thiazide diuretics, including <b>metolazone,</b> are sulfonamides; those with hypersensitivity to sulfonamides ("sulfa allergy") may also be allergic to <b>metolazone.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Metolazone</b> quickly gained {{popularity}} due to {{its lower}} renal toxicity compared to other diuretics (especially thiazides) in patients with renal insufficiency.|$|E
25|$|The primary {{target of}} all thiazide diuretics, {{including}} <b>metolazone,</b> is the distal convoluted tubule, {{part of the}} nephron in the kidney, where they inhibit the sodium-chloride symporter.|$|E
25|$|<b>Metolazone</b> was {{developed}} in the 1970s. Its creator, Indian born chemist Dr. Bola Vithal Shetty has been active in helping the U.S. Food and Drug Administration review drug applications, and in the development of new medicines.|$|E
25|$|Spironolactone is also {{formulated}} {{in combination with}} a variety of other drugs, including with hydrochlorothiazide as Aldactazide, with hydroflumethiazide as Aldactide, Lasilacton, Lasilactone, and Spiromide, with altizide as Aldactacine and Aldactazine, with furosemide as Fruselac, with benazepril as Cardalis (veterinary), with <b>metolazone</b> as Metolactone, with bendroflumethiazide as Sali-Aldopur, and with torasemide as Dytor Plus, Torlactone, and Zator Plus.|$|E
25|$|Sulfonamides {{are used}} to treat allergies and cough, as well as {{antifungal}} and antimalarial functions. The moiety is also present in other medications that are not antimicrobials, including thiazide diuretics (including hydrochlorothiazide, <b>metolazone,</b> and indapamide, among others), loop diuretics (including furosemide, bumetanide, and torsemide), acetazolamide, sulfonylureas (including glipizide, glyburide, among others), and some COX-2 inhibitors (e.g., celecoxib).|$|E
25|$|Thus, {{reaction}} of (1) with phosgene gives the reactive the isatoic anhydride (2). Condensation {{of that with}} ortho-toluidine leads to the acylation product (3) formed with a simultaneous loss of carbon dioxide. This is then converted to the quinazolone (4) by heating with acetic anhydride. Reaction with sodium borohydride {{in the presence of}} aluminum chloride selectively reduces the double bond to yield the diuretic agent <b>metolazone</b> (5).|$|E
25|$|<b>Metolazone</b> and {{the other}} thiazide diuretics inhibit the {{function}} of the sodium-chloride symporter, preventing sodium and chloride, and therefore water too, from leaving the lumen to enter the tubule cell. As a result, water remains in the lumen and is excreted as urine, instead of being reabsorbed into the bloodstream. Since most of the sodium in the lumen has already been reabsorbed by the time the filtrate reaches the distal convoluted tubule, thiazide diuretics have limited effects on water balance and on electrolyte levels. Nevertheless, they can be associated with low sodium levels, volume depletion, and low blood pressure, among other adverse effects.|$|E
2500|$|The {{other major}} use of <b>metolazone</b> is in {{treating}} hypertension (high blood pressure). Thiazide diuretics, though usually not <b>metolazone,</b> are very often used alone as first-line treatment for mild hypertension.

[...] "The Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure" [...] (JNC 7) recommends thiazide diuretics as the initial medication for treatment of hypertension. Hydrochlorothiazide {{is by far the most}} commonly used, as it is both better-studied and cheaper (about four times) than <b>metolazone,</b> although as mentioned above <b>metolazone</b> is used in patients with moderate renal failure.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Metolazone</b> is a quinazoline, a {{derivative}} of the similar diuretic quinethazone, {{as well as}} a sulfonamide. It is related to analogs of 1,2,4-benzothiadizine-1,1-dioxide (benzothiadiazine). These drugs are called benzothiadiazides, or thiazides for short. Chemically, <b>metolazone</b> is not a substituted benzothiadiazine, and therefore is not technically a thiazide. However, since <b>metolazone,</b> as well as other drugs like indapamide, act on the same target as thiazides and behave in a similar pharmacologic fashion, they are considered [...] "thiazide-like diuretics". Therefore, they are often included in the thiazide diuretics despite not being thiazides themselves.|$|E

5000|$|The {{members of}} this class of diuretics are derived from benzothiadiazine.

[...] The term [...] "thiazide" [...] is also often used for drugs with a similar action {{that do not have}} the thiazide chemical structure, such as chlorthalidone and <b>metolazone.</b> These agents are more properly termed thiazide-like diuretics.|$|E

50|$|Once {{the person}} is stabilized, {{attention}} can be turned to treating pulmonary edema to improve oxygenation. Intravenous furosemide is generally the first line.

These loop diuretics may be combined with thiazide diuretics such as oral <b>metolazone</b> or intravenous chlorothiazide for a synergistic effect.
