5000|$|The {{philosophical}} question, „what is {{your place}} of protection“ determines {{the first decade}} of Weiss’ oeuvre. It marks her discourse with individual places of protection and their antithesis, which the artist defines as her leitmotiv. Her performative quest for answers on all continents took longer than ten years and often took place in situations in which people were socially not accepted and in places, which are themselves precarious or not offering shelter, like homeless people or refugees. However also tribal chiefs in Africa, monks in monasteries in India or Russia or Europe were interviewed. She condensed the poetical nucleus of these worldwide performances in a multimedia installation with 54 video works titled “Art Protector”.Weiss uses her own body in performances and puts it into contexts essential to her, thus using her biography as the “literary“ background of her work. She was the first artist to exhibit her placenta at the Senckenberg Museum in Frankfurt.The performance “Muttertier“ shows the artist with her baby and a <b>milk</b> <b>pump</b> in her arm in the Apothecary of Anomalies at the Senckenberg Museum. It is meant to be understood as the source of life {{in the midst of the}} ambivalence of being and not-being, death and new life. Weiss calls “performance” the “momentary picture of an emotion or a dialectic, which is translated into images”.“In the material and performance art of Mia Florentine Weiss we find an artist who definitively utilizes her body and the vital blood metaphor as a living medium. This attitude reflects and shapes her immediate circulatory consciousness of the world“ writes British curator Mark Gisbourne.The eternal circulus vitiosus, the antagonistical agony of both poles of living and dying are a recurring theme in Weiss’ oeuvre. The “Pegasus Project“ is a performative voyage from the Senckenberg Museum Frankfurt along the European borders with the destination of Venice. There it was exhibited by the German-Italian Cultural Society (Deutsch-Italienische Kulturgesellschaft) at Palazzo Albrizzi during the Biennale di Venezia 2015. The artist created the taxidermy sculpture of a white horse with luminous wings symbolizing innocence but also terror of our times in a bipolar field of tension. Pegasus followed an authentic refugee route on land and water at the European borders in early 2015 as a “Moving Installation“ titled “Edges of Europe“. She had researched this route a year prior with the organization Pro Asyl, long before the topic had become so prevalent in the media. The Senckenberg Museum in Frankfurt dedicated a solo exhibition to this project under the motto “Nature meets Culture“ titled “The Navel of the World“.For the final performance called „Anthropocene“ the artist staged herself as center of the exhibition. Positioned in a glass showcase as an artifact between extinct dinosaurs, symbolizing the end of the human race, she communicated with her audience via digital connections during the performance. Mia Florentine Weiss dissolved the classical concept of the artist individual by having her audience partake in her artworks and performances. Freely after Joseph Beuys’ resolution that every person could be an artist, she connects human beings of the most different origins to a collective: Thus the discursive space of a societal status quo is created, which can overcome national borders by force of images and words and which finds its origin in slightly different format in the German classicist concept of the res publica literaria. All this from a time when all of Germany understood itself as a state of world citizens in the sense of Alexander von Humboldt and drew its identity from the power of humanism.The Generaldirektor of the Senckenberg Museum Prof. Dr. Dr. h.c. Volker Mosbrugger said “’Culture is one form of nature’ - as formulated by the philosopher Volker Gerhardt and this hits at the core of our human being. Mia Florentine Weiss is conscious about these correlations and touches that, which is elementary human and finds its roots in nature.“ ...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Background, {{rationale}} and aim of {{the study}} Breastfeeding {{is considered to be}} an important measure to secure child s optimal health and survival. In urban areas of Pakistan most of the women can t afford to live at home longer because they serve as an important contributor of their family income. A woman's return to work has frequently been found to be a main contributor to the early termination of breastfeeding. Most workplaces do not have the supportive environment for breastfeeding. This will probably result in discontinuation of mother's milk and breastfeeding. Little research exists regarding workplace breastfeeding facilities. The current study aimed to assess the factors affecting breastfeeding practices among employed mothers in the workplace. Methodology A cross-sectional study was conducted in Karachi, Pakistan, using a random sampling procedure where 297 workplace sites were assessed. One mother and one employer from each site were interviewed using a structured questionnaire. Data were collected between June 2014 to December 2014. The eligibility criterion for mothers was that they had initiated breastfeeding 3 - 24 months prior to the survey. Studied factors were workplace breastfeeding facilities. Results Only 12 % of the sites were providing breastfeeding breaks for working mothers. Almost 86 % of the mother s had received 3 months maternity leave. Provision of lighter jobs and information about breastfeeding options upon mothers return to work were reported from 15 % and 5 % of the work places respectively. Less than 1 % of the sites had separate lactation rooms, a nursery for childcare, breast <b>milk</b> <b>pump</b> and refrigerator for storing mother's milk. There were statistically significant difference by type of employer (government or private) and site level (national or multinational) with regards to flexible time, lactation room, lighter job, paid maternity leave and provision of breastfeeding options upon mothers return. Conclusion We found {{that the majority of the}} workplace sites lacked basic facilities to support mothers to combine breastfeeding with work such as breastfeeding breaks, lactation room, and nursery for childcare, breast <b>milk</b> <b>pump,</b> refrigerator and provision of lighter job.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Phthalates {{may pose}} a risk for {{perinatal}} developmental effects. An important question {{relates to the}} choice of suitable biological matrices for assessing exposure during this period. OBJECTIVES: This {{study was designed to}} measure the concentrations of phthalate diesters or their metabolites in breast milk, blood or serum, and urine and to evaluate their suitability for assessing perinatal exposure to phthalates. METHODS: In 2001, 2 – 3 weeks after delivery, 42 Swedish primipara provided breast milk, blood, and urine samples at home. Special care was taken to minimize contamination with phthalates (e. g., use of a special breast <b>milk</b> <b>pump,</b> heat treatment of glassware and needles, addition of phosphoric acid). RESULTS: Phthalate diesters and metabolites in milk and blood or serum, if detected, were present at concentrations close to the limit of detection. By contrast, most phthalate metabolites were detectable in urine at concentrations comparable to those from the general population in the United States and in Germany. No correlations existed between urine concentrations and those found in milk or blood/serum for single phthalate metabolites. Our data are at odds with a previous study documenting frequent detection and comparatively high concentrations of phthalate metabolite...|$|E

The aim of the study is to assess workplace breastfeeding support provided to working mothers in Pakistan. Method A workplace based cross-sectional survey was conducted from April through December 2014. Employers from a representative sample of 297 workplaces were interviewed on pre-tested and structured questionnaire. The response rate was 93. 7 %. Prevalence of workplace breastfeeding facilities were assessed in the light of World Alliance for Breastfeeding Action (WABA) guidelines. Results Among non-physical facilities, all workplaces offered 3 months paid maternity leave, 45 % of the sites were offering task adjustment to mothers during lactation period. Only 15 % of the sites were offering breastfeeding breaks to working mothers. Physical facilities that include a breastfeeding corner, refrigerator for storing breast milk, breast <b>milk</b> <b>pump</b> and nursery for childcare were provided in less than 7 % of the sites. Multinational organizations provided better support compared to national organizations. Conclusion Support for continuation of breastfeeding by working women at workplaces is inadequate; hence, women discontinue breastfeeding earlier than planned. Policies need to be developed and enforced, employers and employees need to be educated and supportive environment needs to be created to encourage and facilitate breastfeeding friendly worksite environment...|$|E

40|$|Foam and bubbles are {{ubiquitous}} in industry and nature. They {{have a wide}} range of applications but are also an undesirable product of certain processes. This thesis considers two individual industrial problems with the common phenomenon of bubble and foam formation. Bubble nucleation is a phenomenon observed in many different physical situations from decompression sickness to champagne effervescence. It is of vital importance to the formation of a creamy head that is distinctive to stout beers. I present experimental work that demonstrates that cellulose fibres can be used to initiate stout beers and could serve as an alternative to widget technology. I derive mathematical models for the various gas pocket geometries I observed in cellulose fibres that produce bubbles when submerged in stout beer. These models are solved and compared to experimental results where possible to give the first quantitative evaluation of the current models of bubble nucleation. I present the work done to model a novel design for accurate volume measurement of milk. The new design proposes a modification of the air elimination vessel used in current <b>milk</b> <b>pumping</b> systems to increase accuracy by preventing air bubbles being <b>pumped</b> with <b>milk.</b> We consider the operation of the entire system to <b>pump</b> <b>milk,</b> the flow of milk inside the air elimination vessel, the entrainment of air bubbles into a pool of milk and the drainage of foam...|$|R

40|$|Background: The {{incidence}} of breastfeeding of preterm infants {{is affected by}} the support provided at the hospital and in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). However, policies and guidelines promoting breastfeeding vary both nationally and internationally. Objectives: The aim of this survey was to describe breastfeeding support in Danish NICUs, where approximately 98 % of mothers initiate lactation. Methods: A national survey of all 19 Danish NICUs was conducted in 2009. Four NICUs were at designated Baby-Friendly hospitals, and 5 had a lactation consultant. In all NICUs, it was possible for some parents to stay overnight; 2 units had short restrictions on parents' presence. Five NICUs had integrated postpartum care for mothers. Breastfeeding policies, written guidelines, and systematic breastfeeding training for the staff were common in most NICUs. Seventeen NICUs recommended starting breast milk expression within 6 hours after birth, and mothers were encouraged to double pump. Most NICUs aimed to initiate skin-to-skin contact the first time the parents were in the NICU, and daily skin-to-skin contact was estimated to last for 2 - 4 hours in 63 % and 4 - 8 hours in 37 % of the units. The use of bottle-feeding was restricted. Conclusions: The Danish NICUs described the support of breastfeeding as a high priority, which was reflected in the recommended policies for breast <b>milk</b> <b>pumping,</b> skin-to-skin contact, and the parents' presence in the NICU, {{as well as in the}} restricted use of bottle-feeding.

Despite being encouraged by her own mother to wean the baby early to avoid this discomfort, she was committed (jianchi, jianchi) and confessed that she felt guilty about her plans to wean her baby at 1  year of age. Mei banfa, she explained, “there is nothing to be done.” Another mother, Wu Fang (interviewee 3 a), described the work of pumping, transporting, and storing milk as xinku (exhausting, a hardship), but she was adamant that the decision to do so was not difficult. “For a mother, you always want to give your baby the best, and because I feel that breast milk is the best, so I’ve decided to give him the best—breast milk.” Even women who had no intention to continue breastfeeding after returning to work recognized the commitment that continued breastfeeding could represent. For example, He Lanying (interviewee 5 a), who explained that she had no intention to <b>pump</b> <b>milk</b> at work and who felt formula feeding was perfectly acceptable, also remarked “I admire [those women] who keep nursing after returning to work.” noting that breastfeeding is xinku.|$|R

25|$|Milk {{often is}} homogenized, a {{treatment}} that prevents a cream layer from separating {{out of the}} milk. The <b>milk</b> is <b>pumped</b> at high pressures through very narrow tubes, breaking up the fat globules through turbulence and cavitation. A greater number of smaller particles possess more total surface area than {{a smaller number of}} larger ones, and the original fat globule membranes cannot completely cover them. Casein micelles are attracted to the newly exposed fat surfaces. Nearly one-third of the micelles in the milk end up participating in this new membrane structure. The casein weighs down the globules and interferes with the clustering that accelerated separation. The exposed fat globules are vulnerable to certain enzymes present in milk, which could break down the fats and produce rancid flavors. To prevent this, the enzymes are inactivated by pasteurizing the milk immediately before or during homogenization.|$|R
