It is the hope of both cities that the relationship will grow to include the exchange of delegations, including manufacturers, youth, academicians, scientists, artists, associations, clubs, tourists, technicians and others, which will result in enriching the cultures of the respective cities. As of 2001, the two cities have been sending high school age students on a three-week-long exchange to gain <b>more</b> <b>knowledge</b> about their differences in society and culture.|$|E

On 25 October 2009 her story was featured on CNN's television program Another Day: Cheating Death. Hosted by Sanjay Gupta, the program features stories {{from people who have}} survived severe conditions against all odds. Bågenholm hoped the program would give the people watching it <b>more</b> <b>knowledge</b> of hypothermia. The story is also included in Gupta's companion book, Cheating Death: The Doctors and Medical Miracles that Are Saving Lives Against All Odds. On 30 October 2009, Bågenholm and Gilbert appeared together on the popular Norwegian NRK talk show Skavlan, hosted by Fredrik Skavlan.|$|E

Calculus, though allowed in solutions, is never required, {{as there is a}} principle that anyone with a basic understanding of mathematics should understand the problems, even if the solutions require a great deal <b>more</b> <b>knowledge.</b> Supporters of this principle claim that this allows more universality and creates an incentive to find elegant, deceptively simple-looking problems which nevertheless require a certain level of ingenuity.|$|E

This gave rise to the belief that sharks, as well as being difficult to capture and transport, were difficult to care for. <b>More</b> <b>knowledge</b> has led to more species (including the large pelagic sharks) living far longer in captivity, along with safer transportation techniques that have enabled long distance transportation. For a long time, the great white shark had never been successfully held in captivity for long, but in September 2004, the Monterey Bay Aquarium successfully kept a young female for 198 days before releasing her.|$|E

25|$|Consumer {{behaviour}} is {{the study}} of the motivations surrounding a purchase of a product or service.
