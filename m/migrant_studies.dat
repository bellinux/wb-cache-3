Methodology The PERU <b>MIGRANT</b> <b>study</b> is a cross-sectional study comprising three groups: an urban group from a shanty town in Lima; a rural group from a com-munity in Ayacucho-Peru; and a migrant group originally from Ayacucho currently living in the same urban shanty town. Common mental disorders were assessed using the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ- 12), and social capital was assessed using the Short Social Capital Assessment Tool (SASCAT). Poisson regression with robust standard errors was used to estimate prevalence ratios. Results The overall prevalence of common mental dis-orders was 39. 4 %; the highest prevalence was observed in the rural group. Similar patterns were observed for cogni-tive social capital and structural social capital. However after adjustment for sex, age, family income and education, {{all but one of the}} significant relationships was attenuated, suggesting that in this population migration per se does not impact on common mental health disorders or social capital. Conclusions In the PERU <b>MIGRANT</b> <b>study,</b> we did not observe a difference in the prevalence of common mental disorders, cognitive and structural social capital between migrant and urban groups.

40|$|Background: <b>Migrant</b> <b>studies</b> offer {{a unique}} {{opportunity}} to analyze variation in disease occurrence due to background factors. The role of environmental and lifestyle exposures are of particular interest in cancer research, and <b>migrant</b> <b>studies</b> can be considered as natural experiments in epidemiological research. Large numbers of immigrants from different regions {{of the world and the}} availability of comprehensive demographic and health-related registers in Sweden have prompted us to conduct <b>migrant</b> <b>studies</b> on the epidemiology of cancer. Breast cancer and genital tract cancers were selected for study since the role of environmental and lifestyle risk factors are debated for these disorders. Objectives: To compare the risk and survival of the female breast, cervical, ovarian and endometrial cancers and male prostate and testicular cancers among immigrants to those among Swedish-born individuals to elucidate the importance and the potential timing of environmental and genetic factors in cancer etiology. Methods: We established different cohorts by linkages between Swedish national registers, including Cancer and Cause of Death registers, through personal identity number. The main exposure variable was country of birth with Swedish-born persons with both parents born in Sweden as reference group. Each cohort was followed from start date of follow-up period, date of birth or first immigration date, whichever occurred last, until exit date from the cohort, which was diagnosis of primary outcomes of interest, first emigration, or end of follow-up, whichever came first. We calculated incidence rate ratios and hazard ratios with 95 % confidence intervals adjusted for age and calendar period of follow-up using Poisson and Cox proportional hazards regression models. Results: First-generation immigrants in Sweden had an overall lower risk of cancers studied compared with Swedish-born people. However, we found remarkable variations in cancer risks and survival by country of birth. Age at immigration and duration of residence of first-generation immigrants were important factors affecting risk of cervical, breast, prostate, and testis seminomas. An increasing trend in incidence of prostate cancer among first-generation immigrants similar to either Sweden or country of birth was observed. Secondgeneration immigrants showed a risk converging toward the risk in Sweden for testicular and breast cancers. Education, as an indicator of socio-economic position, differentially affected the risk of cervical cancer among first-generation immigrants and Swedish-born women. Among both immigrants and Swedish-born women, breast cancer risk increased, while its mortality decreased with increasing level of education. Conclusions: Country of birth was a major determinant for cancer risk. Variation of risk by age at immigration or duration of residence highlights the effect of environmental and lifestyle factors on cancer risk. The observed patterns of prostate cancer risk imply the importance of both genetic and environmental factors in the etiology of this cancer. Patterns of testicular cancer risk indicate the importance of early environmental risk factors acting even after the intrauterine period...|$|E

Comparison populations need to be carefully selected depending on the study questions under consideration within the life course framework. Migrant health research will benefit from an approach using a life course perspective.

The aims of this review are to systematically identify studies related to the incidence of schizophrenia, to describe the key features of these studies, and to explore the distribution of rates derived from these studies. Methods Studies with original data related to the incidence of schizophrenia (published 1965 – 2001) were identified via searching electronic databases, reviewing citations and writing to authors. These studies were divided into core studies, <b>migrant</b> <b>studies,</b> cohort studies and studies based on Other Special Groups. Between- and within-study filters were applied in order to identify discrete rates. Cumulative plots of these rates were made and these distributions were compared when the underlying rates were sorted according to sex, urbanicity, migrant status and various methodological features. Results We identified 100 core studies, 24 <b>migrant</b> <b>studies,</b> 23 cohort studies and 14 studies based on Other Special Groups. These studies, which were drawn from 33 countries, generated a total of 1, 458 rates. Based on discrete core data for persons (55 studies and 170 rates), the distribution of rates was asymmetric and had a median value (10 %– 90 % quantile) of 15. 2 (7. 7 – 43. 0) per 100, 000. The distribution of rates was significantly higher in males compared to females; the male/female rate ratio median (10 %– 90 % quantile) was 1. 40 (0. 9 – 2. 4). Those studies conducted in urban versus mixed urban-rural catchment areas generated significantly higher rate distributions. The distribution of rates in migrants was significantly higher compared to native-born; the migrant/native-born rate ratio median (10 %– 90 % quantile) was 4. 6 (1. 0 – 12. 8). Apart from the finding that older studies reported higher rates, other study features were not associated with significantly different rate distributions (e. g. overall quality, methods related to case finding, diagnostic confirmation and criteria, the use of age-standardization and age range). Conclusions There is a wealth of data available on the incidence of schizophrenia. The width and skew of the rate distribution, and the significant impact of sex, urbanicity and migrant status on these distributions, indicate substantial {{variations in}} the incidence of schizophrenia. </p...|$|E

Combining <b>migrant</b> <b>studies</b> and media studies, it explores how the identities of Taiwanese migrants are shaped and reshaped through the ongoing interactions of mediated communication and lived experience {{in the place of}} adoption. Against the linear model of assimilation, three discourses on transnationalism argue for the pluralization and deterritorialization of identities among contemporary migrants, including continuous home-country loyalty, diasporic hybrid identities, and cosmopolitan consciousness. However, this case study also encounters historical particularities, such as the opposition of Taiwanese and Chinese identities in Taiwan, Taiwanese migration to their imagined homeland, and China ’ authoritarian media system. While attending to these issues, I analyze the migration patterns of Taiwanese migrants, their use of the media in China, and the relations between mediation and identity. Primarily based on in-depth interviews with 68 Taiwanese migrants conducted in 2008, I found that Taiwanese migrants ’ spatial and upward mobility upon migration contributes to their class distinction and outsider mentality in China.

Geographical and ethnic {{differences}} {{in the distribution of}} BPH and the results of <b>migrant</b> <b>studies</b> indicate that not only age, androgens and genetics, but also modifiable factors {{may play a role in}} the aetiology of BPH. Oxidative stress induced by chronic inflammation could be a cause and antioxidants, including selenoproteins, may reduce the risk. The published data related to this topic are scarce and are mainly based on cross-sectional and case-control studies. In a nested case-control study, we observed a significant inverse association between serum selenium concentrations and the risk of BPH. These results need to be confirmed in larger, prospective epidemiological studies. Prostate enlargement is an increasing health problem as a result of an ageing population in many countries. Modifiable factors may also play a role. In the present study, before this antioxidant can be recommended as a preventive measure. OBJECTIVE: •  To determine whether geographical differences in the distribution of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and <b>migrant</b> <b>studies</b> indicate that modifiable factors play a role in the aetiology of BPH. Oxidative stress produced by chronic inflammation could represent one of the causes, and antioxidants, including selenoproteins, may reduce the risk. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: •  Conditional logistic regression was used to examine the associations of serum selenium and selenoprotein P concentrations and glutathione peroxidase activity with respect to the risk of BPH in a case-control study nested in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition-Heidelberg cohort, including 111 cases and 214 matched controls. •  In addition, dietary glucosinolate intake and the serum glutathione S-transferase α concentration was investigated. RESULTS: •  The risk of BPH significantly decreased with an increasing serum selenium concentration; the risk estimate was 0. 83 (35 % CI 0. 69 - 0. 99) per 10  µg/L increase in serum selenium concentration. •  However, no significant association was present for serum selenoprotein P concentration or glutathione peroxidase activity. Risk estimates for BPH decreased with a higher intake of glucosinolates, although the results were not statistically significant. CONCLUSION: •  A low serum selenium concentration may increase the risk of BPH, although the findings reported in the present study need to be confirmed in larger, well-designed epidemiological studies...|$|E
