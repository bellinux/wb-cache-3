25|$|The last {{murder to}} involve Gravano was {{the murder of}} Louie DiBono, the made man Gravano had {{threatened}} to kill earlier. Gravano described {{the reasons for the}} murder in Underboss: He was still robbing the family and I asked for permission to take him out. But John had a meeting with DiBono, and DiBono told John that he had a billion dollars of drywall work that was coming out of the World Trade Center. John bit, hook, line and sinker, and refused <b>my</b> <b>request.</b> John said he would handle DiBono personally and become his partner. But DiBono was up to his old tricks double-dealing. He had obviously been bullshitting John. So when John called Louie in for meetings to discuss their new partnership, DiBono didn't show up. John was humiliated. This meant an automatic death penalty. John gave the contract to DiBono's captain, Pat Conte. Conte botched an ideal opportunity to kill DiBono. Then, as Gotti grew increasingly impatient, Conte explained that the problem now was trying to corner DiBono again. Whenever a meeting with him was arranged, DiBono never appeared. It was a joke, what was going on. I couldn't help laughing to myself. I told John why didn't Pat simplify everything. Just call Louie up and tell him to hang himself. Ten months went by. John looks like an asshole. He was too embarrassed even to ask me for help.|$|E

500|$|The cricket press {{noticed the}} absence of Crawford and the {{professionals}} from Surrey's team over the following games, and noted that Crawford was now playing club cricket. Meanwhile, Alverstone wrote to Crawford that the Surrey committee fully supported Leveson Gower's decision to omit Rushby and Lees, {{and told him that}} Surrey would not select him again unless he apologised to Leveson Gower. Crawford refused, writing to Alverstone: [...] "I do not know who was responsible for the selection of the second eleven sort of team furnished up for such an important match... There seems to be some impression amongst a few of the Surrey committee that I am some young professional instead of being a young fellow who has had an experience of cricket that has seldom fallen to the lot of anyone, and <b>my</b> <b>request</b> for an alteration of the team should have had some weight". In his History of Cricket, Benny Green describes the letter as evidence of a [...] "literate and quietly self-confident young man who will not easily be manipulated." ...|$|E
500|$|With {{the ninth}} issue, dated July 1, 1919, Hersey was {{replaced}} by Ronald Oliphant. [...] The reason he was replaced is not clear, though several explanations have been suggested. [...] Murray Leinster claimed that Hersey was fired for publishing too much of his own fiction and poetry in the magazine; according to Leinster, some of the poetry may have actually been written by Hersey's mother rather than by Hersey himself. [...] Pulp historian Richard Bleiler regards this theory as unlikely, since although up to eighteen of the twenty-five short poems in the first eight issues of the magazine may have been by Hersey, only two stories in those issues are definitely by him, and there are only four other stories {{which may have been}} Hersey's work published under a pseudonym. [...] Bleiler suggests that at most Street & Smith would have reprimanded Hersey, and that the real reason for his dismissal {{is more likely to be}} that Street & Smith were dissatisfied with The Thrill Book under his editorship. [...] Bleiler also suggests that Hersey may have started the rumor that he was let go for buying too much of his own material, as this would have been less harmful to his reputation than a dismissal for failure. [...] Hersey himself claimed that he was not fired, but quit: [...] "I wasn't fired, but I should have been... I saw the 'handwriting on the wall' ahead of time. [...] I asked to be relieved of my duties... and <b>my</b> <b>request</b> was promptly accepted!" ...|$|E

40|$|Over {{the past}} ten years I have {{contacted}} James Watson three times seeking his evaluation of my discovery of cell life that would offer some functional significance to his DNA structure discovery. However, he ignored <b>my</b> <b>requests</b> all three times. Why? Since 1997 I have contacted James Watson, a Nobel Prize winner in 1962 for the discovery of a double-helix structure of DNA, over my discovery on how semi-conservative DNA replication could be integrated into a new cell life theory which links DNA aging with cell aging and combines genetics with epigenetics. However, Watson has ignored <b>my</b> <b>requests</b> for reading <b>my</b> manuscripts and showing support for three separate times in 1998, in 2005 and, most recently, in 2007. He never replied to me directly and his secretary’s replies have been that he was very busy, mainly with his fund-raising obligation for his institution. His lack of interest, not to say support for scientific discoveries disappointed me greatly.

2500|$|Upon {{her return}} to Canada, Jean yet again became a target when the subject of her dual {{citizenship}} was raised, in particular the French variety she had obtained through her marriage to the French-born Lafond. A section of the French civil code forbade French citizens from holding government or military positions in other countries, yet Jean, as governor general, would hold a governmental position as the representative of Canada's head of state, and, as such, would have a military role carrying out the duties of Commander-in-Chief of the Canadian Forces, as constitutionally vested in the monarch. The French embassy in Ottawa stated that there was [...] "no question" [...] that the law would not be enforced in Jean's case, but, on September 25, two days before her swearing-in, Jean made it public that she had renounced her French citizenship [...] " [...] light of the responsibilities related to the function of Governor General of Canada and Commander-in-Chief of the Canadian Forces" [...] and [...] "France acceded to <b>my</b> <b>request</b> by decree on September 23, 2005." ...|$|E

2500|$|While not {{active in}} any Watergate {{activities}} per se, Gray was aware through {{his dealings with}} John Dean that the White House was concerned about what might be discovered from a full-field FBI investigation and explored {{what he could do}} to limit the investigation or shift it away from the Bureau’s jurisdiction. As Dean wrote in his Watergate memoir “Blind Ambition,” he used Gray as a shill knowing that “we could count on Pat Gray to keep the Hunt material from becoming public, and he did not disappoint us.” [...] In fact, even though he thought of this as a political not criminal situation and that he was ultimately serving the President as the “nation’s chief law enforcement officer,” Gray would come dangerously close to collusion because he chose to be useful to the White House without asking the hard questions. Dean goes on to say, “I met Pat Gray secretly at his home in southwest Washington.

2500|$|In September 1994, Nunn, former President Jimmy Carter {{and former}} Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Colin Powell were asked by President Bill Clinton {{to go to}} Haiti in order to force the {{departure}} of the military dictator Lieutenant General Raoul Cédras. In 1994 Clinton publicly demanded that the Haitian government step aside and restore democratic rule. Clinton deployed a large military force to surround the country in September 1994. Just before the troops reached Haiti, Clinton sent a delegation led by Carter, Nunn and Powell to urge Cédras to step down and leave the country. Cédras agreed and surrendered the government, and he and his top lieutenants left the country in October. Just days later, American forces escorted the country’s elected president, Jean-Bertrand Aristide, into the capital. Afterwards, Clinton lavished praise on Nunn's delegation for averting a military strike on the nation. [...] "As all of you know, at <b>my</b> <b>request,</b> President Carter, Gen. Colin Powell, and Sen. Sam Nunn went to Haiti to facilitate the dictators' departure. I have been in constant contact with them for the last two days.

Today, I decided to remove any ambiguity. I withdraw <b>my</b> <b>request</b> of Belgian nationality. Requesting Belgian nationality was to better protect the foundation that I created with the sole purpose of ensuring the continuity and integrity of the LVMH group if I were to disappear." [...] On 10 April 2013, Arnault announced that he had decided to abandon his application for Belgian citizenship, saying he did not want the move to be misinterpreted as a measure of tax evasion at a time when France faced economic and social challenges. Arnault also stated that several employees requested to leave France for tax purposes, that he declined their requests, and that [...] "the 75% tax would not raise a lot of revenue but should prove less divisive now that it was set to be levied on firms rather than people and only due to stay in place for two years." ...|$|E

[...] Basse's [...] "Angler's Song", beginning [...] "As inward love breeds outward talk", then follows. Piscator's friend Coridon says [...] "we are all beholding to the good man that made this song" [...] and proposes a toast to the poet. Of the other two songs mentioned by Walton, a unique copy of [...] "Maister Basse, his careere, or the new hunting. To a new Court tune", is in the Pepys collection at Cambridge; it is reprinted in 'Wit and Drollery' (1682), p.64, and in Old Ballads (1725), ii. 196. The tune is given in the Skene MS. preserved in the Advocates' Library, Edinburgh, and a ballad in the Bagford collection in the British Museum, entitled [...] "Hubert's Ghost", is written [...] "to the tune of Basse's Career". Basse's second ballad, [...] "Tom of Bedlam", has been identified by Sir Harris Nicolas in his edition of Walton's Angler, with a song {{of the same name}} in Percy's Reliques, ii. 357; but many other ballads bear the same title, and this identification is therefore doubtful.
