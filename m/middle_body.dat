50|$|Before {{creating}} the Banjo model, Simon designed a shelf clock (1780s, Grafton).

50|$|The milk has an {{excellent}} quality and is adequate either for the direct consumption or for the processing to high-quality products (cheese, butter, yogurt). Among the mountain cattle breeds in Italy the Tyrol Grey has the best milk amount/milk quality (fat, protein) ratio and delivers a higher amount of contents for the processing to quality products. The above-average per cow was 2002 in the South Tyrol about 4,836 kg milk per annum, 3.78% milk fat content, and 3.38% protein (8,491 control cows).

Water of India, where a magic jug keeps replenishing itself endlessly {{and by the end}} of the show, there's an entire bucket of water filled through that little jug.

50|$|The Caspian whipsnake {{is perhaps}} the largest species of snake in Europe. It {{typically}} grows to around 140 - 160 cm in length, though a few may exceed a length of 200 cm. The record sized specimen was approximately 250 cm This species is not venomous and is mostly active during the day. The head is joined to the body by a thick neck. Its pupils are round. Nineteen rows of smooth scales {{can be found at}} the <b>middle</b> <b>body,</b> though rarely there may be seventeen. Dorsal scales each have two apical pores at the posterior edge. The centre of the scale is lighter in colour than the edges. The dorsal side is grey-brown and features markings which are distinctive in juveniles and young snakes but fade with age. The ventral side is light yellow or white.|$|E
5000|$|This {{species can}} reach {{a length of}} 4 cm SL.

This streak of red is slightly brighter in males than females, which, except for the shape, is the only outward indication of sex. At first glance, the fish appears to be identical to the tiger barb. However, when compared side-to-side, it can be seen that on P. tetrazona, the <b>middle</b> <b>body</b> stripe extends completely through the dorsal fin. On P. partipentazona, the blotch on the dorsal fin is not part of any of the body stripes, the colors are brighter, and the anal fin shows red.|$|E
