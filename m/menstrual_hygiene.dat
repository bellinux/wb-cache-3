Girls may lack knowledge of <b>menstrual</b> <b>hygiene</b> since the subject is taboo. An intervention in four districts of Southern Ethiopia, identified and tested local material for making sanitary pads, trained local tailors to make and mass-produce them, established local supply outlets and lobbied stakeholders to up-scale. Successful testing and raising awareness of the problem resulted in improved facilities for girls in five primary schools and one secondary school.|$|E

[...] During the first year, Kapoor visited schools in the states of Rajasthan and Maharashtra where she interacted with students and participated in fundraising events hosted by the Kasturba Gandhi Balika Vidyalaya organisation in the Jalna district. Along with UNICEF India's Goodwill Ambassador (Sharmila Tagore), Kapoor hosted a charity dinner to help raise awareness {{for the development of}} underprivileged kids, and launched the 'Child-Friendly School and Systems' (CFSS) package. She later donated an equivalent amount of the funds raised during a joint initiative by UNICEF and Groupon for a higher-quality learning environment in Indian schools. The following year, she awarded 31 students and 5 teachers for their contribution towards the field of education in Chhattisgarh at the concluding ceremony of Child Rights Protection week.

40|$|ABSTRACT Menstruation is {{a process}} of utmost {{importance}} in the reproductive physiology of females. The present study aims at assessing the understanding of menstruation process among married women and to gain insight into the sources of information and nature of knowledge pertaining to the physiological process under consideration. The sample for the study comprised of 200 married women in the age group of 20 - 40 years. Equal numbers of women were drawn from two ecological settings (Rural and Urban) of Jammu District, through stratified random sampling technique. The tools for data collection included interview schedules. The results reflected a picture of ignorance and lack of understanding among respondents regarding the physiology and importance of menstrual process particularly among rural respondent (χ 2 = 35. 24, *Significant at 1 %). Their explanation of menstruation reflected incomplete knowledge, unscientific notions and blindfold faith in cultural taboos, myths and social customs pertaining to practices and procedures. Besides these, rural respondents also associated a variety of negative physical and psychological changes with menstruation. Marked differences were also evident in the perception of urban and rural respondents regarding the right age of menarche (χ 2 = 64. 72, *Significant at 1 %), prior information regarding menstruation (χ 2 = 13. 20, *Significant at 1 %) and cleanliness measures adopted. Among the varied sources of information, mass media especially television and magazines, were found to be the major source of information among urban respondents, which is credited for their awareness regarding <b>menstrual</b> health and <b>hygiene</b> particularly in the usage of napkins, bathing and personal care.

40|$|Background: In {{the recent}} years, {{the issue of}} gynaecological {{problems}} of poor women in the developing countries has been receiving increasing attention. High levels of gynaecological morbidity, especially reproductive tract infections and sexually transmitted infections {{may turn out to}} be fatal if not treated properly. The objective of this study was to assess the health seeking attitude of women regarding reproductive tract infections, to elicit the past history pertaining to it, to assess the personal hygiene measures relevant to it. Methods: Various community based studies carried out in the different regions world showed the prevalence of reproductive tract infections 36 - 84 %. The sample size of study as per statistical calculation (4 pq/l 2, where p = 50, q= 100 -p and l= 10 % of p) came out to be 400. Prior enlisting all villages of Surendranagar district, one village was selected randomly. After random selection the village found was Khodu. Results: 75. 3 % of women narrated treatment was necessary; 44 % told that preferably to be taken from doctor and 24. 7 % told treatment should not be taken because of social and personal reason. 56. 5 % of women having one or the other kind of symptom of reproductive tract infections. Women with poor <b>menstrual</b> and personal <b>hygiene</b> has got 2. 5 times chances of reproductive tract infections (OR= 2. 35, CI= 1. 374 - 4. 01, P value: 0. 001). Thus the overall prevalence in our study is 56. 5 %. On statistical analysis it was found that women who used clothes were two times more symptomatic as compared to women who used sanitary pads, a significant association between women having symptoms of reproductive tract infections and their sexual history. The present study showed 61. 94 % of women had taken treatment which shows that the health seeking behavior had improved. Conclusions: Women who used sanitary pads during menstrual periods had lower prevalence. Women with complaints of dyspareunia, bleeding during and or after intercourse and history of forceful intercourse had maximum prevalence of reproductive tract infections. 19. 8 % of women gave past history of reproductive tract infections and out of that 15. 16 % of women had taken treatment for it. Regarding health seeking attitude of symptomatic women, 61. 94 % of women had taken treatment and majority of them had taken treatment from doctors. This implies that health intervention measures directed towards reducing morbidity from reproductive tract infections need not focus mainly on treatment of reproductive tract infections but rather on disease preventing strategies.

50|$|Menstrual cups can {{be useful}} {{as a means of}} <b>menstrual</b> <b>hygiene</b> {{management}} for women in developing countries, such as Kenya, Uganda and India, where access to affordable sanitary products may be limited. Menstruation can be a barrier to education for many girls, as a lack of effective sanitary products restricts girls' involvement in educational and social activities. Often they do not attend school due to fear of leaking, shame or embarrassment, period pain or inadequate sanitation facilities that do not allow them to wash or change in privacy. This applies mainly to schoolgirls from low-income families, since disposable hygiene products are a monthly expense that many females simply cannot afford. A lack of affordable hygiene products means inadequate, unhygienic alternatives are used, which can present a serious health risk. Menstrual cups offer a longer-term solution than other feminine hygiene products, because they {{do not need to be}} replaced monthly. The quality of the material also makes them a reliable and healthy <b>menstrual</b> <b>hygiene</b> solution, as long as there is access to clean water for washing them.|$|E
