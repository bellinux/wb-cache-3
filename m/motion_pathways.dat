Using point-light animations of biological motion, we examine {{the extent to which}} form and <b>motion</b> <b>pathways</b> are mutually involved in perceiving figures depicted by the spatio-temporal integration of local motion components. Previous work discloses that viewing biological motion selectively activates a region on the posterior superior temporal sulcus (STSp). Here we report that the occipital and fusiform face areas (OFA and FFA) also contain neural signals capable of differentiating biological from nonbiological motion. EBA and LOC, although involved in perception of human form, do not contain neural signals selective for biological motion. Our results suggest that a network of distributed neural areas in the form and <b>motion</b> <b>pathways</b> underlie the perception of biological motion...|$|E

40|$|A key intuition behind {{probabilistic}} roadmap planners for motion {{planning is}} that many collision-free paths potentially exist between two given robot configurations. Hence the connectivity of a robot's free space can be captured effectively by a network of randomly sampled configurations. In this paper, a similar intuition is exploited to preprocess molecular <b>motion</b> <b>pathways</b> and efficiently compute their ensemble properties, i. e., properties characterizing the average behavior of many pathways. We construct a directed graph, called stochastic conformational roadmap, whose nodes are randomly sampled molecule conformations. A roadmap compactly encodes many molecular <b>motion</b> <b>pathways.</b> Ensemble properties are computed by viewing the roadmap as a Markov chain. A salient feature of this new approach is that it examines all the paths in the roadmap simultaneously, rather than {{one at a time}} as classic methods such as Monte Carlo (MC) simulation would do. It also avoids the localminima problem encountered by the classic methods. Tests of the approach on two important biological problems show that it produces more accurate results and achieves several orders of magnitude reduction in computation time, compared with MC simulation...|$|E

An accurate Roentgenstereophotogrammetric system was used for motion measurements. Four knees were tested in a motion and loading rig with one and the same experimental protocol. A fifth specimen was used to study the effects of some of the experimental conditions on the axis parameters. On the basis of earlier reported motion characteristics in terms of Euler rotations and translations, two <b>motion</b> <b>pathways</b> were chosen to be reported here: a flexion motion with an internal torque of 3 Nm and one with an external torque of 3 Nm on the tibia. The positions and orientations of the axes were described relative to the insertions of the four major ligaments and the geometry of the articular surfaces of the femur. and also as intersections with a medial and a lateral sagittal plane. The three-dimensional patterns of the helical axes of the four knee specimens were found to be highly reproducible and consistent for each of the two <b>motion</b> <b>pathways.</b> The axis patterns were not unique, but reflected the particular combination of Rexion and axial rotation for each particular motion pathway.

Thresholds were measured for slow oscillatory displacements for 68 infants aged 6, 12, 18, and 24 weeks.

Six-week-olds as a group were very insensitive to these slow displacements. Sensitivity increased systematically across the three older ages.

40|$|AbstractVisual motion {{processing}} {{is often}} {{attributed to the}} dorsal visual pathway despite visual motion’s involvement in almost all visual functions. Furthermore, some visual motion tasks critically depend on the structural integrity of regions outside the dorsal pathway. Here, based on numerous studies, I propose that visual motion signals are swiftly transmitted via multiple non-hierarchical routes to primary motion-dedicated processing regions (MT/V 5 and MST) that {{are not part of}} the dorsal pathway, and then propagated to a multiplicity of brain areas according to task demands, reaching these regions earlier than the dorsal/ventral hierarchical flow. This not only places MT/V 5 at the same or even earlier visual processing stage as that of V 1, but can also elucidate many findings with implications to visual awareness. While the integrity of the non-hierarchical <b>motion</b> <b>pathway</b> is necessary for all visual motion perception, it is insufficient on its own, and the transfer of visual motion signals to additional brain areas is crucial to allow the different motion perception tasks (e. g. optic flow, visuo-vestibular balance, movement observation, dynamic form detection and perception, and even reading). I argue that this lateral visual <b>motion</b> <b>pathway</b> can be distinguished from the dorsal pathway not only based on faster response latencies and distinct anatomical connections, but also based on its full field representation. I also distinguish between this primary lateral visual <b>motion</b> <b>pathway</b> sensitive to all motion in the visual field, and a much less investigated optic flow sensitive medial processing pathway (from V 1 to V 6 and V 6 A) that appears to be part of the dorsal pathway. Multiple additional predictions are provided that allow testing this proposal and distinguishing between the visual pathways...|$|R

Here, we investigated whether our own movements benefit from preferential processing even when the task is unrelated to self-recognition, and does not involve agency judgments. Participants searched for a moving target defined by its known shape among moving distractors, while continuously moving the computer mouse with one hand. They thereby controlled the motion of one item, which was randomly either the target or any of the distractors, while the other items followed pre-recorded <b>motion</b> <b>pathways.</b> Performance was more accurate and less prone to degradation as set size increased when the target was the self-controlled item. An additional experiment confirmed that participant-controlled motion was not physically more salient than motion recorded offline. We found no evidence that self-controlled items captured attention.

40|$|The {{influence}} of position and motion signals on saccades was studied in two dimensions (2 D) using a double step-ramp paradigm. We showed {{the presence of}} a predictive component in 2 D catch-up saccade programming that is based on motion signals and influences both saccade amplitude and orientation. Interestingly, a significant proportion of catch-up saccades was characterized by a large curvature or a sudden change of direction in midflight for large values of retinal slip. For these saccades, a quantitative analysis showed that their trajectory could be explained by an asynchrony between position and motion signals in saccade programming. When the saccade trajectory was not straight, position error was always available first and influenced the initial orientation of the saccade, whereas retinal slip determined the final orientation. This new paradigm could be used in electrophysiological experiments, where it should prove to be very useful to study position and <b>motion</b> <b>pathways</b> separately in catch-up saccades...|$|E

Here, we approximate this previous model with a second order feedback control system, capturing key dynamic characteristics of cone responses, namely, a system with a natural frequency of 5 Hz and peak response time of 50 ms. Even if considerably simplified when compared to the original model, the second order feedback system is found useful as a computational tool to simulate blurring of moving visual cues. Comparison with a signal averaging model- an accepted approximation of motion blur- shows that second order feedback more closely follows visual perception of motion smear in various stimulus patterns. The finding that cone dynamics capture perceptual phenomena that has been hitherto associated with <b>motion</b> <b>pathways</b> raises questions about the neurological origins of motion blur effects.

40|$|Neurons {{sensitive}} to visual motion change their response properties during prolonged motion stimulation. These {{changes have been}} interpreted as adaptive and were concluded, for instance, to adjust {{the sensitivity of the}} visual <b>motion</b> <b>pathway</b> to velocity changes or to increase the reliability of encoding of motion information. These conclusions are based on experiments with experimenter-designed motion stimuli that differ substantially with respect to their dynamical properties from the optic flow an animal experiences during normal behavior. We analyze for the first time motion adaptation under natural stimulus conditions. The experiments are done on the H 1 -cell, an identified neuron in the blowfly visual <b>motion</b> <b>pathway</b> that has served in many previous studies as a model system for visual motion computation. We reconstructed optic flow perceived by a blowfly in free flight and used this behaviorally generated optic flow to study motion adaptation. A variety of measures (variability in spike count, response latency, jitter of spike timing) suggests that the coding quality does not improve with prolonged stimulation. However, although the number of spikes decreases considerably during stimulation with natural optic flow, the amount of information that is conveyed stays nearly constant. Thus the information per spike increases, and motion adaptation leads to parsimonious coding without sacrificing the reliability with which behaviorally relevant information is encoded. ...|$|R
40|$|Animals use {{vision to}} {{traverse}} novel cluttered environments with apparent ease. Evidence {{suggests that the}} mammalian brain integrates visual motion cues across a number of remote but interconnected brain regions {{that make up a}} visual <b>motion</b> <b>pathway.</b> Although much is known about the neural circuitry that is concerned with motion perception in the primary visual cortex (V 1) and the middle temporal (MT) area, little is known about how relevant perceptual variables might be represented in higher-order areas of the <b>motion</b> <b>pathway,</b> and how neural activity in these areas might relate to the behavioral dynamics of locomotion. The main goal of this dissertation is to investigate the computational principles that the mammalian brain might be using to organize low-level motion signals into distributed representations of perceptual variables, and how neural activity in the <b>motion</b> <b>pathway</b> might mediate behavior in reactive navigation tasks. I first investigated how the aperture problem, a fundamental conceptual challenge encountered by all low-level motion systems, can be solved in a spiking neural network model of V 1 and MT (consisting of 153, 216 neurons and 40 million synapses), relying solely on dynamics and properties gleaned from known electrophysiological and neuroanatomical evidence, and how this neural activity might influence perceptual decision-making. Second, when used with a physical robot performing a reactive navigation task in the real world, I found that the model produced behavioral trajectories that closely matched human psychophysics data. Essential to the success of these studies were software implementations that could execute in real time, which are freely and openly available to the community. Third, using ideas from the efficient-coding and free-energy principles, I demonstrated that a variety of response properties of neurons in the dorsal subregion of the medial superior temporal (MSTd) area could be derived from MT-like input features. This finding suggests that response properties such as 3 D translation and rotation selectivity, complex motion perception, and heading selectivity might simply be a by-product of MSTd performing dimensionality reduction on their inputs. The hope is that these studies will not only further our understanding of how the brain works, but also lead to novel algorithms and brain-inspired robots capable of outperforming current artificial systems...|$|R
40|$|Knowing {{the depth}} {{structure}} of the environment is crucial for moving animals in many behavioral contexts, such as collision avoidance, targeting objects, or spatial navigation. An important source of depth information is motion parallax. This powerful cue is generated on the eyes during translatory self-motion with the retinal images of nearby objects moving faster than those of distant ones. To investigate how the visual <b>motion</b> <b>pathway</b> represents motion-based depth information we analyzed its responses to image sequences recorded in natural cluttered environments {{with a wide range}} of depth structures. The analysis was done on the basis of an experimentally validated model of the visual <b>motion</b> <b>pathway</b> of insects, with its core elements being correlation-type elementary motion detectors (EMDs). It is the key result of our analysis that the absolute EMD responses, i. e. the motion energy profile, represent the contrast-weighted nearness of environmental structures during translatory self-motion at a roughly constant velocity. In other words, the output of the EMD array highlights contours of nearby objects. This conclusion is largely independent of the scale over which EMDs are spatially pooled and was corroborated by scrutinizing the motion energy profile after eliminating the depth structure from the natural image sequences. Hence, the well-established dependence of correlation-type EMDs on both velocity and textural properties of motion stimuli appears to be advantageous for representing behaviorally relevant information about the environment in a computationally parsimonious way...|$|R

40|$|Priming for motion {{direction}} {{has been shown}} to depend upon the functional integrity of extrastriate area V 5 /MT. Its retinotopic organization and the interactions recently found between motion adaptation and misperceived localization may suggest, for this area, a role for priming of spatial position in addition to the established priming of {{motion direction}}. Disruption of V 5 /MT with repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation during the intertrial interval had the effect of abolishing priming of motion direction but no effect in priming of spatial position. These effects cannot be explained in terms of perception or task demands but only in terms of the effects of information irrelevant to the correct performance of the task stored over the intertrial interval. We suggest that the attribute of spatial position might be stored in short-term memory either in earlier areas of the <b>motion</b> <b>pathways</b> such as V 3 or in higher cortical areas traditionally associated with the analysis of spatial information, for example, posterior parietal cortex or the frontal eye fields...|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{occurrence}} of multi-directional sliding motion between total knee replacement bearing surfaces is theorized to be a primary wear and failure mechanism of ultra-high molecular weight poly(ethylene) (UHMWPE).

40|$|Flying blowflies {{shift their}} gaze by saccadic turns {{of body and}} head, keeping their gaze {{basically}} fixed between saccades. For the head, this results in almost pure translational optic flow between saccades, enabling visual interneurons in the fly <b>motion</b> <b>pathway</b> to extract information about translation of the animal and thereby about the spatial layout of the environment. There are noticeable differences between head and body movements during flight. Head saccades are faster and shorter than body saccades, and the head orientation is more stable between saccades than the body orientation. Here, we analyse the functional importance of these differences by probing visual interneurons of the blowfly <b>motion</b> <b>pathway</b> with optic flow based on either head movements or body movements, as recorded accurately with a magnetic search coil technique. We find that the precise head–body coordination {{is essential for the}} visual system to separate the translational from the rotational optic flow. If the head were tightly coupled to the body, the resulting optic flow would not contain the behaviourally important information on translation. Since it is difficult to resolve head orientation in many experimental paradigms, even when employing state-of-the-art digital video techniques, we introduce a ‘headifying algorithm’, which transforms the time-dependent body orientation in free flight into an estimate of head orientation. We show that application of this algorithm leads to an estimated head orientation between saccades that is sufficiently stable to enable recovering information on translation. The algorithm may therefore be of practical use when head orientation is needed but cannot be measured. ...|$|R

40|$|In adults, visual {{form and}} motion {{activate}} independent networks of extrastriate areas which are roughly {{aligned with the}} ventral and dorsal streams, respectively. Using high-density steady-state ERPs, we have previously shown that the scalp topographies of infant form and motion responses are markedly different from those in adults, implying a substantial developmental reorganisation of the underlying cortical pathways. However, {{it is hard to}} discern the nature of this reorganisation from the ambiguous polarity and timing information available in steady-state ERPs. We have started to address this problem by measuring transient ERPs to motion onset. In adults, the transient ERP topography initially suggests activation of extrastriate cortex, but rapidly switches to a dominant focus over the occipital pole originating in V 1 and/or V 2. The infant ERP is similar to the initial phase of adult ERP, but lacks the sudden switch to a V 1 /V 2 -dominated topography. The implications of these results for the reorganisation of cortical <b>motion</b> <b>pathways</b> will be discussed, with particular focus on the idea that the adult V 1 /V 2 component is mainly driven by feedback from extrastriate motion areas (eg, V 5), and that these feedback signals are not present in the infant brain...|$|E

Innovative experimental approaches may now provide limited partial information about conformational changes along <b>motion</b> <b>pathways</b> of proteins. There is therefore a need for computational approaches that can efficiently incorporate prior information into motion prediction schemes. In this paper, we present PathRover, a general setup designed for the integration of prior information into the motion planning algorithm of rapidly exploring random trees (RRT). Each suggested motion pathway comprises a sequence of low-energy clash-free conformations that satisfy an arbitrary number of prior information constraints. These constraints {{can be derived from}} experimental data or from expert intuition about the motion. The incorporation of prior information is very straightforward and significantly narrows down the vast search in the typically high-dimensional conformational space, leading to dramatic reduction in running time.

The suggested framework can serve as an effective complementary tool for molecular dynamics, Normal Mode Analysis, and other prevalent techniques for predicting motion in proteins. We applied our framework to three different model systems.
