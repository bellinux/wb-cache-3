The manner in which material flows into the <b>screw</b> <b>feeder</b> affects the flow characteristics of the feeding hopper, the residence periods of the material in various locations in the bunker and thus the properties of the dosed material. The present paper will present some experimental results regarding the discharging profile of the mass flow <b>screw</b> <b>feeders</b> with variable geometrical design...|$|R
40|$|<b>Screw</b> <b>feeders</b> {{are being}} {{widely used in}} {{industry}} to feed reliably many kinds of bulk solids because of their simplicity in structure, good metering characteristics, total enclosure for safety, great flexibility of design and wide application. However, to date, the design {{of this type of}} equipment is still not precise due to an overall shortage theoretical analyses and experimental data reported in the literature. For this reason, this thesis aims at formulating theoretical models to predict the performance of single and twin <b>screw</b> <b>feeders.</b> The models concentrate on the volumetric efficiency, draw-down performance and torque or power requirement of <b>screw</b> <b>feeders.</b> The models are based on analyses of the relevant particulate mechanics. An element of bulk solid sliding on the helical surface of a screw flight will move in a direction related to the angle of friction between the bulk solid and the surface, and helical of the flight surface. An analytical solution to the integral equation to express the volumetric efficiency of <b>screw</b> <b>feeders</b> has been obtained. A theoretical model for the torque requirement is developed by analysing the stresses acting on the five confining surfaces surrounding the bulk solid contained within a pitch. This model allows the torque characteristics to be predicted. A criterion for uniform draw-down performance is presented based on the pitch characteristics of the screw. To obtain detailed information on the interaction among the screw geometry, the operating conditions and properties of the bulk solid, a systematic experimental investigation is undertaken into the performance of <b>screw</b> <b>feeders</b> with different <b>screw</b> and trough configurations, three types of bulk material and different operating conditions. Experimental programs on the twin <b>screw</b> <b>feeders</b> are also conducted to observe the effect of operating conditions and geometric parameters. The factors affecting performance of the twin <b>screw</b> <b>feeders</b> also are analysed. Experimental data are compared with the results obtained from the theoretical predictions. The volumetric efficiency, draw-down performance and torque requirements of <b>screw</b> <b>feeders</b> predicted by the theoretical models developed in this work are found to provide results which agree well with experimental data. The performance prediction models are also applied in industrial practice. Some typical problems experienced by industry are analysed. New design of <b>screw</b> <b>feeders</b> are provided for four upgrade projects...|$|R

40|$|Experiments were {{conducted}} to investigate the effects of screw speed and <b>screw</b> <b>feeder</b> inclination on the residence time distribution (RTD) of particles in a <b>screw</b> <b>feeder</b> via a pulse stimulus response technique. Two models based on Markov chains were developed to simulate particle flows within and between pitches. In upward and horizontal <b>screw</b> <b>feeder</b> inclination cases, a three-parameter two-dimensional Markov chain model consisting of parallel active and stagnant zones fitted well with the experimental RTD data, with correlation coefficients (R- 2) higher than 0. 98, and gave a clear physical meaning for the parameters introduced. In these cases, a high screw speed or a horizontal inclination induced a high probability of forward movement from a pitch to the next pitch (f) during each rotation period of the screw, and a low ratio of stagnant zone to active zone (r) in a pitch. The upward <b>screw</b> <b>feeder</b> inclination yielded a higher diffusion probability from stagnant zone to active zone (d). In the downward <b>screw</b> <b>feeder</b> inclination case, a one-dimensional Markov chain model without a stagnant zone was {{in agreement with the}} corresponding experimental data. The analysis showed that during each rotation period of the screw, the particles in a pitch could be transferred not only to the next pitch but also to the following two pitches. </p...|$|R

This investigation explores the use of generalised norms and moments from structural-borne acoustic emission (AE) measurements as key statistics indicators for the estimation of powder mass flow rate in a <b>screw</b> <b>feeder.</b> Experimental work was carried out acquiring AE measurements from an industrial <b>screw</b> <b>feeder</b> working with four different types of material at different dispensation rates. Signal enveloping was used in first place to eliminate high frequency components while retaining essential information such as peaks or bursts caused by particle impacts.

Therefore, research of micro machining and smart material {{is an important step}} to develop the future manufacturing process. Layered manufacturing is one of the propective process of it. Research of powder deposition is a key of developing multi material micro fabrication. This research was implemented in four steps including materials preparation and characterization, design and manufacturing experiment apparatus, wall friction-flow ability test and design-manufacturing MMMF machine including the mechanical, electronics and software system. The research was initiated by study observation to find information about characteristic of fine powder and method of reducing the cohesiveness. By sieving process, powder was separated into 4 particle sizes including - 34, 34 - 60, 60 - 74, 74 - 104 micron. Particle shapes were observed using optical microscope. Wall friction test was performed to observe the effect of wall surface roughness, particle size and material powder on mass flow characteristic, by Jenike method. Flow ability test was carried out to yield the powder flow consistency by varying the particle sizes, models of <b>screw</b> <b>feeder</b> geometry, installing blender mechanism, reducing the particle cohesiveness and the wall friction test parameters (powder quantity in hopper and wall surface roughness). For these experiments, rotation of the <b>screw</b> <b>feeder</b> was fixed at 236 rpm. By plotting the experimental data, the optimum parameter of powder mass flow can be determined and it was tested by varying rotation of the <b>screw</b> <b>feeder.</b> The experimental results show that the mass flow characteristic is affected by wall surface roughness and particle size. Effect of powder quantity in hopper can be eliminated by installing blender mechanism; it can also reduce the compaction of the powder around nozzle orifice so that the mass flow can be increase. Mass flow characteristic is also affected by hopper angle, in which the optimal angle is achieved at 25. 67 o (by variation of 20. 6 o, 22. 62 o and 25. 67 o). Powder mass flow was caused dominantly by stimulating rotation of the <b>screw</b> <b>feeder,</b> it is not by helicoidal surface of the <b>screw</b> <b>feeder.</b> Powders trapped in helicoidal slot drive around particle caused by geometric interlocking. However, increasing <b>screw</b> <b>feeder</b> diameter is an effective way to increase the mass flow of smaller particle size (in this chase smaller than 60 micron). Preheating process gives the effective method to increase the mass flow, particularly for small particle (smaller than 60 micron). By considering these parameters, mass flow capacity can be arranged effectively by controlling rotation of the <b>screw</b> <b>feeder.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|<b>Screw</b> <b>feeders</b> {{are used}} {{extensively}} in the food, plastics, household products, mineral processing and agricultural industries to remove material from hoppers and bins at a controlled rate. A key design requirement {{is to make the}} empty space in the screw available evenly along its exposed length below the hopper or bin. The evenness of the flow depends on the drawdown flow pattern, which in turn depends on the screw and hopper design, shape of the particles and wall friction effects. If the drawdown is not even then compositional variations in the outgoing stream can be created. The strongly varying residence time distributions for particles within the bin can also lead to quality issues. Designs to date have typically been based on analytical models and often performance issues are observed when the screw design used does not give the desired flow pattern. In this study the Discrete Element Method (DEM) is used to simulate particle transport in a horizontal <b>screw</b> <b>feeder</b> system for a range of conventional screw designs including variable screw pitch, screw flight and core diameters. The influence of screw design on the particle mass flow rate, the evenness of particle drawdown from the hopper and power consumption are investigated.

40|$|The project ”Investment {{proposal}} for grinding station for service work of screw feeders” has been performed {{during the spring}} semester 2014 for the course Bachelor’s thesis for degree of  Bachelor of science in machine engineering at Karlstad’s University. The project has been performed in cooperation with Fiber Workshop which is a service department in the company Valmet AB. Valmet AB {{is a company that}} develops and manufacture soft paper tissue machines. The <b>screw</b> <b>feeder</b> is a part that is used to feed, and squeeze out the water out of woodchips. The service work of the <b>screw</b> <b>feeder</b> mostly consists of service work on two major parts, namely the <b>feeder</b> <b>screw</b> and the split pipe, which the <b>feeder</b> <b>screw</b> is mounted in.   The purpose of the project was to evaluate the service work, namely the grinding in a working environment point of view. Another goal of the project was to present some improvements for this process.   The working environment which has been evaluated is primarily the risk of vibration damage in arm and hand, the risk of ergonomic musculoskeletal disorders and even a dust measurement has been performed, with the help of Hans-Olov Karlsson from the company Clarahälsan. The result from the working environment survey suggests that the operator exceed the work environment limits in regards to the risk of suffering damages from vibrations in the hand and arm. The grinding work of the split pipe {{is considered to be a}} bigger problem in regards to ergonomics than the grinding on the <b>feeder</b> <b>screw.</b> The split pipe requires the operator to stand in a posture that takes more concentration and precision than for the <b>feeder</b> <b>screw.</b> The results from the dust measurements indicate that the levels of dust in the air, during the grinding, are within the approved limits.

In the present work, a feed delivery {{system for a}} solar gasification reactor was designed, fabricated and tested. The feedstock delivery system delivers the required amount of feedstock into the reactor which is a cavity of molten salt held at 1200 K. The feed delivery rate was from 8 ±(0. 4) gm/min to 15 (± 0. 75) gm/min. The cellulose feed particles were of diameter 0. 5 mm. The feed delivery system is comprised of hopper, <b>screw</b> <b>feeder,</b> stepper motor and feed injector. The hopper was designed to store a feed supply needed for continuous one hour operation of the reactor at the feed delivery rate of 15 (± 0. 75) gm/min. The <b>screw</b> <b>feeder,</b> which is rotated using a stepper motor, draws the feed particles from the hopper outlet and carries them in forward direction to the feed injector.

40|$|<b>Screw</b> <b>feeders</b> {{are used}} to remove {{material}} from hoppers and bins at a controlled rate. The evenness of the flow in the bin depends on the drawdown pattern, which in turn depends on the screw and hopper design, shape of the particles and wall friction effects. A key design requirement {{is to ensure that}} a progressive increase in the screws volumetric capacity is achieved along {{the entire length of the}} hopper's opening so as to produce even drawdown. If this is not achieved then compositional variations in the outgoing stream and other operational problems (such as caking) can be created. Screw designs to date have been generally based on analytical models and at times the predicted flow pattern is not achieved. In this study, the Discrete Element Method (DEM) is used to predict particle transport in a horizontal <b>screw</b> <b>feeder</b> system for a range of conventional screw designs including a variable screw pitch, variable screw flight outside diameters and variable core diameters. The influence of screw choice on the particle mass flow rate, the evenness of particle drawdown from the hopper, power consumption, screw wear and wall friction variations are all investigated. Important features captured by DEM that are not accounted for by the analytic model and which vary strongly between competing screw designs, include the particle circulation in the hopper, shearing of the particle bed in the trough just outside the screw and the spatially varying particle force along the hopper which leads to non-uniform drawdown and to the existence of large stagnant or slow moving zones. The screw design and consequent flow patterns also strongly affect the power draw with variations up to a factor of three and screw wear with large changes in their distribution and magnitude. Finally, the surface frictional properties of the screw are shown to strongly influence the rate of bed compaction within and along the screw leading to strong variation in mass flow rate, uniformity of drawdown and power draw...|$|R

The PIinspired process reduces the number of machines drastically compared to a conventional TMP line, as well as the number of pumps, chests and other auxiliary equipment...|$|R
40|$|There {{has been}} a {{noticeable}} shift from pharmaceutical batch processing towards a more continuous mode of manufacture for solid oral dosage forms. Continuous solid oral dose processes {{would not be possible}} {{in the absence of a}} highly accurate feeding system. The performance of feeders defines the content of formulations and is therefore a critical operation in continuous manufacturing of solid dosage forms. It was the purpose of this review to review the role of the initial powder feeding step in a continuous manufacturing process. Different feeding mechanisms are discussed with a particular emphasis on screw controlled loss in weight (LIW) feeding. The importance of understanding the physical properties of the raw materials and its impact on the feeding process is reviewed. Prior knowledge of materials provides an initial indication of how the powders will behave through processing and facilitates in the selection of the most suitable (i) feeder (capacity), (ii) feeding mechanism, and (iii) in the case of <b>screw</b> <b>feeder</b> - <b>screw</b> type. The studies identified in this review focus on the impact of material on powder feeding performance...|$|R
