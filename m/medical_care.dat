However, it is {{not clear}} what "social" means in <b>medical</b> <b>cares</b> and medicine. We argued about the concept of ethics in the second report. In this reoport we argued about "social". And in this report we {{compared}} the progression of <b>medical</b> <b>cares</b> and medicine with the formation of civilian society, which are both, what we call innovation. "Social" of ELSI seems to be the concept that differs from lexical "social" in a nuance a little somehow or other. In addition, there are basic philosophies (I took up respects of human rights and economic liberalism in this report) in civilian society to support itself, which are in higher rank than in social norms, but ELSI in <b>medical</b> <b>cares</b> and medicine has been immature...|$|R

5|$|Bringing {{dead and}} seriously wounded {{down from the}} top was {{difficult}} for both sides. UN litter-bearing teams of six men had to carry each wounded man on a stretcher down the mountain. A medical aide was also needed to administer care during the trip if the man was critically wounded, and riflemen often accompanied the groups to protect them from North Korean snipers along the trail. Critically wounded men often died before reaching the bottom where full <b>medical</b> <b>care</b> could be administered. This possibility was one of the factors that lowered morale in the 24th Infantry units fighting on Battle Mountain. Many men were afraid that if they were wounded there they would die before reaching adequate <b>medical</b> <b>care.</b> North Korean troops often did not have time to move dead and wounded from the peak at all, forcing both sides to bury casualties in shallow graves along the peak.|$|E
