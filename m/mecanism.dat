We first provide an introduction to basic concepts and <b>mecanisms,</b> and review existing compactification methods. We then review and discuss spacetime compactification triggered by non-linear sigma model fields. We study spacetime compactification via a single scalar field by requiring scalar field in higher dimensions to gravitate only in a subset of dimensions. For this purpose we first review fully non-gravitating scalar field configurations and then determine conditions and <b>mecanisms</b> for obtaining a partially gravitating scalar field. In each case Ricci and hence energy-momentum tensor of the scalar field vanishes completely or partially though this does not imply or reqire scalar field itself to vanish. By making use of the partially-gravitating scalar fields, we discuss how spacetime dimensions get compactified if the scalar field gravitates in those dimensions, only. We illustrate how this mechanism works in special cases, like generating a constant-curvature manifold of extra dimensions...|$|R
