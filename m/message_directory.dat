40|$|Analyses of {{solutions}} for large-scale optimization models {{are very difficult}} without effective computer aids. Solution reports may require weeks to design, implement and produce with conventional report writing systems. The reports produced are voluminous, often exceeding 100, 000 printed lines, and are thus quite awkward to access manually. Timely and economic analysis {{of solutions}} to large models is further hindered by inflexible and costly report writing software and procedures. ATHENA has been developed to allow extremely efficient immediate interactive storage {{and analysis of the}} solution file from any optimization system. ATHENA is easy to learn and use; user friendly features are provided which can preemptively assess the potential cost and implications of each request for solution information, assist the confused user, and provide the required solution information with very fast response time. The user is provided with extensive search under mask and compound logical relational constructs, as well as the capability to quickly diagnose suspicious model symptoms, and to format and issue offline reports. ATHENA is implemented in portable FORTRAN, with a parser and interpreter easily modified and expanded to suit particular hardware environments and user demands. The system has been initially designed and tuned for large-scale problems with up to 30, 000 rows and columns. Live test demonstrations show that the system exhibits very fast response time in actual use.

40|$|As {{databases}} {{have expanded}} in scope from storing purely business data to include XML documents, product catalogs, e-mail <b>messages,</b> and <b>directory</b> data, {{it has become}} increasingly important to search databases based on wild-card string matching: prefix matching, for example, is more common (and useful) than exact matching, for such data. In many cases, matches need to be on multiple attributes/dimensions, with correlations between the dimensions. Traditional multi-dimensional index structures, designed with (fixed length) numeric data in mind, are not suitable for matching unbounded length string data. In this paper, we describe a general technique for adapting a multi-dimensional index structure for wild-card indexing of unbounded length string data. The key ideas are (a) a carefully developed mapping function from strings to rational numbers, (b) representing an unbounded length string in an index leaf page by a fixed length offset to an external key, and (c) storing multiple elided t [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 51 - 52) This report {{describes a}} design of an {{electronic mail system}} called the Computer Message System(CMS). This system provides the user with tools to compose, send, receive, store, retrieve and forward messages. The CMS is designed on the NOS time-sharing system, an operating system developed for CYBER 170 classes of computers. The features of the CMS include the following: The user command interface to the CMS is the NOS system command(the standard NOS system commands such as PACK, XEDIT, and additional commands {{for the purpose of}} CMS, such as SEND, READ). Each separable component of message handling, such as message composition or message display, is a separate command. CMS stores each message as a separate file under NOS, and it utilizes the NOS file system to organize groups of files within separate directories. All of the NOS facilities for dealing with files and directories, such as rename, purge, catlog, change, etc., are applicable to <b>messages</b> and <b>directories</b> of <b>messages...</b>|$|R

All OSI application layer standards use ASN. 1 in order to specify data structures such as mail <b>messages</b> or <b>directory</b> entries that are exchanged in distributed applications. ASN. 1 allows to define complex data types, which are encoded in a standardized exchange format, the so-called transfersyntax. To automate the tedious task to program the encoding and decoding routines by hand, socalled ASN. 1 compilers can be used (e. g. MAVROS [Huit 91], Pepsy [Onio 89], [Neuf 90], [Harv 91] and [Koiv 92]). Today, ASN. 1 is a well-established language {{that has been used}} not only in all OSI application layer standards, but also for non-OSI standards such as the Internet Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) and the Open Document Interchange Format (ODIF).

30|$|In Clive, {{applications}} perform I/O through named channels. Named channels do {{not carry}} raw byte streams. Instead, they stream typed <b>messages</b> that include <b>directory</b> entries, raw bytes, file addresses, errors, and application defined data. Doing so enables streaming of structured data, avoiding extra RPCs, which permits operation in high latency networks. For example, for file commands, full file trees can be concurrently streamed {{from one or}} more servers and pipelines may process such streams without further RPCs to the file servers involved, reducing the effects of latency. Together, named channels and structured streams cooperate to make it practical to combine existing programs to build new ones in distributed environments with high latencies, instead of requiring to write ad-hoc applications in all cases. Existing UNIX programs {{may be used as}} well as new ones.|$|R

40|$|Conferencing {{services}} for Internet telephony and multimedia {{can be enhanced}} by the integration of other Internet services, such as instant <b>messaging,</b> presence notification, <b>directory</b> lookups, location sensing, email and web. These services require a service programming architecture that can easily incorporate new Internet services into the existing conferencing functionalities, such as voice-enabled conference control. W 3 C has defined the Call Control eXtensible Markup Language (CCXML), along with its VoiceXML, for telephony call control services in a point-to-point call. However, it cannot handle other Internet service events such as presence enabled conferences. In this paper, we propose an architecture combining VoiceXML with our Language for End System Services (LESS) and the Common Gateway Interface (CGI) for multi-party conference service programming that integrates existing Internet services. VoiceXML provides the voice interface to LESS and CGI scripts. Our architecture enables many novel services such as conference setup based on participant location and presence status.

40|$|With {{the trend}} towards {{increasing}} number of processor cores in future chip architectures, scalable directory-based protocols for maintaining cache coherence will be needed. However, directory-based protocols face well-known problems in delay and scalability. Most current protocol optimizations targeting these problems maintain a firm abstraction of the interconnection network fabric as a communication medium: protocol optimizations consist of endto-end <b>messages</b> between requestor, <b>directory</b> and sharer nodes, while network optimizations separately target lowering communication latency for coherence messages. In this paper, we propose an implementation of the cache coherence protocol within the network, embedding directories within each router node that manage and steer requests towards nearby data copies, enabling in-transit optimization of memory access delay. Simulation results {{across a range of}} SPLASH- 2 benchmarks demonstrate significant performance improvement and good system scalability, with up to 44. 5 % and 56 % savings in average memory access latency for 16 and 64 -node systems, respectively, when compared against the baseline directory cache coherence protocol. Detailed microarchitecture and implementation characterization affirms the low area and delay impact of in-network coherence. 1...|$|R

40|$|The {{challenge}} of securing of Web based transaction services continues {{to influence the}} development and evolution of ecommerce and Web Services. This problem had driven the computer industry and standards organizations to introduce a number of security measures {{in an attempt to}} compensate for the growing security concerns of enterprises and the software development community. These efforts have not yielded a standardized architectural framework to securing Web based transaction services. The research that was conducted provided a solution to this problem by using a unique combination of technologies and architectural design techniques that provided a security framework for these transactions. The research model defined an architectural framework that incorporated infrastructure technologies, including Public Key Infrastructure (PKI), Secure Socket Layer (SSL) and Lightweight Directory Protocol (LDAP), along with XML security and a set of SOAP specification extensions that when used in conjunction with custom Java components provided an environment for secure web based transaction services. This framework used a centralized operational model that represented behavioral, security and resource location parameters in an LDAP repository. The custom Java components of the framework provided client driven capabilities that allowed a client and service provider to establish a secure transaction relationship by using a predetermined negotiation protocol that captured these parameters in the LDAP repository. The parameters defined the trust relationship in the LDAP repository and were communicated in SOAP <b>messages</b> using <b>Directory</b> Service Markup Language (DSML). These DSML SOAP messages were used with custom SOAP extensions that applied a set of operational design patterns that communicated transaction behavior between client and service provider to ensure security of the Web based transactions. The research model used this extended SOAP model and XML security to provide message level confidentiality, authentication, authorization, content integrity and non-repudiation. The framework provided these security characteristics within a SOAP messaging environment that provided end-to-end message security, application independence, transport protocol independence, intermediary soap server processing capabilities, message protection during transmission and storage and notary service capabilities...|$|R
