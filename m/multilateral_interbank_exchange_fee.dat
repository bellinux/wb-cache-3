40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} {{experience}} with floating <b>interbank</b> <b>exchange</b> rate systems in five developing countries [...] The Gambia, Guyana, Jamaica, Nigeria and Sri Lanka [...] and draws some conclusions about the stability and efficiency of these systems. The experience of these countries illustrates both the difficulties and the advantages of <b>interbank</b> <b>exchange</b> rate markets. The main conclusion is that these markets can operate relatively well with a minimum banking infrastructure, provided that the authorities remove legal and institutional impediments to the free operation of these markets including, in particular, exchange restrictions.
