This study will draw on Hyland’s (2005) <b>metadiscourse</b> <b>model</b> where code glosses, endophoric markers, evidentials, frame markers and {{transition}} markers {{are included in}} the interactive dimension, and attitude markers, boosters, engagement markers, hedges and self mention are to be found within interactional metadiscourse. I shall apply this framework for the identification and analysis of data in a corpus which comprises a selection of recipes taken from both Middle English Medical Texts (Taavitsainen – Pahta – Mäkinen 2005) and The corpus of early English recipes. The metadiscursive approach to the study of medical recipes will allow us to establish links between authors, texts and audience of the recipe genre and, consequently, to affirm their status as products of social engagement...|$|E
40|$|AbstractAcademic {{book reviews}} {{published}} in academic journals {{are expected to}} provide readers with {{both positive and negative}} evaluation of the book under review. This academic genre has recently been the focus of increasing number of studies due to its evaluative and interactional nature. The present cross-cultural study aimed to explore how interpersonal metadiscourse was used in Turkish and English book reviews. The corpus used in this study consisted of 150 published book reviews from different disciplines in English and Turkish. In order to understand how writers engaged in their reviews and interacted with their readers, Hyland's (2000) <b>metadiscourse</b> <b>model</b> was used to identify interpersonal markers in book reviews. With a focus of five common features from this model, hedges, emphatics (boosters), attitude markers, relational markers, and person markers were used as categories to be investigated. Relying on a quantitative data analysis followed by qualitative analysis, {{it was found that the}} total number of interpersonal metadiscourse features was considerably higher in the English corpus than in the Turkish corpus. Two languages showed variations particularly in the use of hedging devices which help writers to tone down their statements. Particularly learners in academic contexts can gain awareness of how various academic genres are realized in different cultures based on the findings...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} multimodal discourse of academic posters from three disciplines, namely, Chemistry, Speech & Hearing Sciences and Linguistics, {{in an attempt}} to unravel how writers from different disciplinary communities build their communicative purposes into the verbal and visual modes in their posters. The analytical framework adopted for this study builds upon the one proposed by D’Angelo(2010), which incorporates Hyland’s <b>metadiscourse</b> <b>model</b> (2005) and Kress and van Leeuwen’s visual grammar paradigm (2006) for the verbal and visual analyses respectively, and supplements it with multimodal content analysis adapted from Jones’s (2007) model. Follow-up interviews with members of the discourse communities were also conducted to enhance the validity of the results. The findings reveal that there exist a wide range of differences in the use of metadiscourse markers (e. g. hedges, boosters, evidentials, code glosses) across the three group texts pertaining to disciplinary influences. There is also evidence that academics in different subjects value some of the same qualities in the texts necessitated either by the peculiar context of poster presentations (e. g. frame markers, engagement markers) or a need to maintain scientific formality (e. g. self-mentions). Visually, the concern for the context and ‘scientificness’ continue to exert great influences, rendering a myriad of visual manifestations (e. g. framing, modality) that are commonly shared across the data, whereas the cross-discipline discrepancy mainly narrows down to the image usage(functions and types). published_or_final_versionApplied English StudiesMasterMaster of Arts in Applied Linguistic...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{literature}} on the theory of metadiscourse markers suggests that one significant function fulfilled by this type of resources is facilitating the comprehensibility of texts. Although many researchers have investigated this function in written texts, {{there has been little}} research on the role metadiscourse plays in the comprehension of spoken discourse. The aim {{of the present study was}} to gain insights into the effect of metadiscourse use on Iranian EFL learners’ lecture comprehension. To do so, 22 students were selected to participate in the study. In order to assess the students’ language proficiency a pre-test, namely Oxford Placement Test (OPT), was used. Then the subjects were randomly divided into two groups. During ten sessions, students in two groups listened to lectures with different topics in the field of linguistics by the teacher. Two versions of the same lecture were used. One of them included <b>metadiscourse</b> markers (Hyland's <b>model,</b> 2005) and in the other one, metadiscourse markers were removed. To measure learners’ listening comprehension, a test consisting of a set of lecture-related questions (post-test) was administered. Then both groups of participants were asked to answer a questionnaire to assess the perceived level of the difficulty and the quality of the lecture. In order to analyze the obtained data, an independent t-Test was run. The findings of the study revealed that the subjects comprehended the lecture better when metadiscourse markers were included...|$|R

This study aims to {{investigate}} properties of writing relating to genre-based literacy in isiXhosa {{as a first}} language (that is, as home language) for Grade eleven learners. The research investigates the problem of writing in isiXhosa at secondary school level, and the associated instruction, to grade eleven learners, whose first (home) language is isiXhosa. The educational context of these learners is such that the language of instruction in content subjects is English, which is as an additional language to these learners. Furthermore, they take English as a language subject. The learners’ home language is, however, only taught as a subject in this context. The language of instruction officially is English in all the content subjects, hence language proficiency problems in English are often encountered {{not only by the}} learners, but by educators as well. The genre-based theoretical framework and associated methodology is explored and employed in this study to establish {{the extent to which the}} isiXhosa first language learners are able to transfer the skills they have acquired in their first language, isiXhosa, to writing in the content subjects. Thus, the study has the following five main aims: (i) The study investigates the question of the extent to which high school learners can use their isiXhosa as their home language for the purpose of writing in their content subjects in a bilingual education system, where English as their second or additional language is the prescribed medium of instruction for content subjects; (ii) The study addresses the questions of how genre-based writing skills of learners with isiXhosa as home language are realized in their writing in the home language, isiXhosa as subject, assuming a genre-based approach to language learning and teaching; (iii) This study examines the writing of learners whose first (home) language is isiXhosa with regards to the extent to which they can transfer the genre-based writing skills they have acquired in writing in isiXhosa as language subject to writing in their content subjects; (iv) This study aims to determine the textlinguistic properties of writing in isiXhosa. Thus, the study will investigate genre-related concerns about the extent to which explicit genre-based instruction in isiXhosa will result in improving genre-based writing across the curriculum while enhancing the educational performance and achievement of learners; (v) This study explores the gap in knowledge and insights as regard the role of writing across the curriculum in isiXhosa as home language (first language), providing theoretically-motivated arguments for the importance of a strong focus on genre-pedagogy for African languages as language subjects, more generally. Therefore, this study aims to address the question of the role of writing in isiXhosa, as learners’ home language in a bilingual education in the learning and teaching context, a central point of concern in the South African education system. The methodology of this study entails the examination of three stages of the learners’ writing in isiXhosa, in both the biographical recount and the expository genres. The three stages are termed stage one, stage two and stage three, respectively, of the learners’ writing. For the purpose of data collection the writing in isiXhosa, two secondary schools in the Cape Peninsula, Bulumko Secondary School in Khayelitsha and Kayamandi Secondary School in Stellenbosch have been examined, focusing on the writing of the grade eleven learners. For all the three stages of writing in each secondary school a class of fourty grade 11 learners was instructed to write essays in isiXhosa on both the biographical recount genre and the expository genre. After the learners had written their essays the effectiveness of the essays was classified according to the levels of learners’ performance, for the purpose of analysis. In stage one, learners write the essay without being taught the genre-based properties of writing. In the stage two essay writing, the learners wrote the biographical recount and the expository essays after they have been taught the genre-based properties of writing. In the stage three essay writing, the learners applied the skills they have been taught in stage two regarding genre-based properties of writing. The teacher and learners brainstormed, discussed and exchanged views with each other on genre-based properties before the learners engaged in the writing in the third stage. As mentioned above, the stage one, two and three essays were categorised according to the learners’ performance, that is the good essays, the middle standard essays and the less or lower performance essays were classified for the purpose of the analysis. This study explores the genre-specific writing in isiXhosa by grade 11 learners with isiXhosa as first language, assuming as framework the genre properties by Feez and Joyce (1998), Grabe and Kaplan (1996), and Hyland (2005), the latter concerning <b>metadiscourse.</b> These <b>models</b> are discussed in chapter two and employed in chapter three for the analysis of both the biographical recount and the expository genres of grade eleven learners. Grabe and Kaplan’s (1996) linguistic and ethnographic construction of texts, the overall structure of texts and the generic move structures were examined in the content of the isiXhosa text. The parameters of the ethnography of writing, “Who writes what to whom, for what purpose, why, when, where and when and how?” posited by Grabe and Kaplan are also employed in this study in the analysis of the essays written in isiXhosa. In addition, the isiXhosa essays have been analysed with respect to Grabe and Kaplan’s (1996) components of information structuring under the writes parameter; topic sentence structure, topic continuity, topic structure analysis, topic-comment analysis, given-new relations, theme-rheme relations and focus-presupposition. In addition to the textlinguistic components of the write parameter, the writing in isiXhosa was analysed as regard the elements of text structure, which form part of the textuality and the structuralism of a text, as well as text cohesion, text coherence and the lexicon. In addition, the writing in isiXhosa was examined as regard Feez and Joyce’s (1998) overall design and language components of a biographical recount, including the three stages that reflect the rhetorical structure. The analysis of the isiXhosa essays has taken into account Hyland’s (2005) classification of metadiscourse according to two dimensions of interaction: the interactive dimension and the interactional dimension. The evaluative discussion invoked evidence from the analysis of the isiXhosa essays conducted in chapter three to demonstrate the view that, despite the variations in the three stages of both the learner’s expository and biographical recount essays, a steady progress and improvement from the stage 1 to the stage 2, and from the stage 2 to the stage 3 was evidenced. The findings of this study confirmed the effective realization and effective transfer of genre-based skills across the curriculum, in accordance with the objectives and aims stated for the study...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Students’ {{skills in}} {{effective}} written communication are an essential and {{integral part of}} university education in both native and non-native speaker context. Focus {{of this study is}} on science writing in native speaker context. However, there is limited research on undergraduate writing in science. Research shows that such studies directly impact on student performance since they contribute to enhance pedagogies for academic literacy. The need for such studies has been highlighted by reports such as National Association Physics Teachers and National Science Foundation. Writing a laboratory report is an activity that models the writing of a scientific paper. Hence, this study focused on examining laboratory report writing (specifically introduction sections and discussion sections) and aimed to provide insights and implications for teaching and learning of laboratory report writing. A diverse sample of laboratory reports including different year levels and different subjects were chosen from two prestigious universities in Australia. The Swales CARS (Create-A-Research-Space) model (2004), which has been used extensively to analyse Research Articles (RA) in science was used as one analytical tool in this study to identify commonly used “Moves” by the students. Further, Hyland’s (2004), <b>metadiscourse</b> <b>model</b> for academic writing was used to identify common linguistic features used in undergraduate laboratory reports. The study found that novice writers follow most of the practices of expert writing, with only minor differences in laboratory reports between different year levels and different subject areas. The main difference is that laboratory reports lack some of the “Moves” of research articles. Research placement reports were found to be more consistent with the CARS model. The difference between laboratory reports and research placement reports {{can be attributed to the}} different learning outcomes of the two activities. This study contributes to the development of pedagogy of academic literacy practice and teaching laboratory report writing by suggesting two new models, based on the CARS model, for teaching report writing. These are presented as flowcharts in simple English, making them accessible to students. Further, this study highlights the importance of effective collaboration between science academics and literacy practitioners. A common understanding between disciplinary academics and EAP practitioners regarding the writing conventions, disciplinary differences and expected learning outcomes would be beneficial for student learning and their performance...|$|E
