5|$|Hospice Medical Director: The hospice <b>medical</b> <b>director,</b> a physician, often {{provides}} the most support to the clinical staff providing care to the patient and family. The <b>medical</b> <b>director</b> may also provide medical care if the primary physician is unavailable or if the patient {{does not have a}} primary care provider. The hospice <b>medical</b> <b>director</b> is also required under Medicare to recertify patients.|$|E
5|$|A {{pioneer of}} {{community-based}} {{research in the}} absence of effective government efforts, Sonnabend also helped to establish the nonprofit Community Research Initiative (CRI, later renamed CRIA, then ACRIA) in New York in 1987. One of CRI's early achievements was a trial that contributed to the approval of inhaled pentamidine for preventing Pneumocystis pneumonia, a common AIDS-related infection. Sonnabend served as <b>Medical</b> <b>Director</b> of CRI/CRIA until 1996.|$|E

In 1951, Casson was awarded an OBE for her work at Dorset House and was also made an honorary fellow of the World Federation of Occupational Therapists.

40|$|Background: The {{purpose of}} this study was to observe the roles played by six hospice <b>medical</b> <b>directors</b> from two hospice {{programs}} during interdisciplinary team case reviews. Methods: The study analyzed videotapes of case reviews in two hospice agencies over a two year period. The results indicate that the roles and levels of participation vary. <b>Medical</b> <b>Directors</b> were observed reviewing and assisting with care plans, acting as a liaison with primary physicians, educating staff, consulting with attending physicians, participating in quality assurance activities, and dealing with budget issues. Results: <b>Medical</b> <b>Directors</b> did not make home visits or assume the role of attending physician during the observation period. Conclusions: The study demonstrates variance in roles among <b>medical</b> <b>directors</b> and raises new questions for future research...|$|R

5|$|In {{order to}} qualify for hospice care, a patient must have {{certification}} from two physicians {{that he or she}} has less than six months to live if his or her disease runs its natural course; usually the patient's primary physician and the Hospice <b>Medical</b> <b>Director</b> will provide this certification. Patients can and do stay on hospice longer than six months, {{and as long as the}} hospice team continues to certify with supporting evidence that the patient is terminal, insurance companies will usually continue to pay for hospice care.|$|E

5|$|Dorset House had {{space for}} 800 {{patients}} in residence during the 1930s, moving to Bromsgrove during World War II. The building was damaged during the war, so in 1946, the School of Occupational Therapy moved to Oxford, whilst the patients moved to Clevedon. To ensure costs were kept {{down for the}} patients, Casson subsidised their treatment from her own funds. She began to release control of the projects in 1948, first by passing the school to a nonprofit company with her as vice-president and remaining as <b>medical</b> <b>director.</b> Then, in 1949, Casson created the Elizabeth Casson Trust which focused on occupational therapy treatment and education, {{with the majority of}} funds going to Dorset House school. In 1992, the school became part of Oxford Brookes University.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE To assess {{challenges}} in {{providing palliative care}} in long-term care (LTC) facilities {{from the perspective of}} <b>medical</b> <b>directors.</b> DESIGN Cross-sectional mailed survey. A questionnaire was developed, reviewed, pilot-tested, and sent to 450 <b>medical</b> <b>directors</b> representing 531 LTC facilities. Responses were rated on 2 different 5 -point scales. Descriptive analyses were conducted on all responses. SETTING All licensed LTC facilities in Ontario with designated <b>medical</b> <b>directors.</b> PARTICIPANTS <b>Medical</b> <b>directors</b> in the facilities. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Demographic and practice characteristics of physicians and facilities, importance of potential barriers to providing palliative care, strategies that could be helpful in providing palliative care, and the kind of training in palliative care respondents had received. RESULTS Two hundred seventy-fi ve <b>medical</b> <b>directors</b> (61 %) representing 302 LTC facilities (57 %) responded to the survey. Potential barriers to providing palliative care were clustered into 3 groups: facility staff’s capacity to provide palliative care, education and support, and the need for external resources. Two thirds of respondents (67. 1 %) reported that inadequate staffi ng in their facilitie...|$|R

50|$|An {{affiliate}} of AMDA - Dedicated to Long Term Care Medicine, the American <b>Medical</b> <b>Directors</b> Certification Program (AMDCP) accredits Certified <b>Medical</b> <b>Directors</b> (CMD) in long-term care.

The AMDCP is the sole organization to accredit Certified <b>Medical</b> <b>Directors</b> in long-term care, and has certified more than 2,700 CMDs since {{the founding of the}} program in 1991.|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Access to {{rheumatology}} {{care can}} expedite {{diagnosis and treatment}} of rheumatic diseases and reduce disparities. We surveyed community health center (CHC) <b>medical</b> <b>directors</b> to evaluate rheumatology care in underserved areas and potential strategies for improvement. METHODS: We identified 77 Massachusetts CHCs that provide adult medical services and sent a 40 -item survey to their physician <b>medical</b> <b>directors.</b> Survey questions assessed the centers 2 ̆ 7 prevalence of rheumatic diseases, prescribing practices of immunosuppressive medications, and possible interventions to improve care.

Qualitative data were analyzed thematically. RESULTS: Thirty-six CHC physician <b>medical</b> <b>directors</b> returned surveys (47...|$|R
40|$|<b>Medical</b> <b>directors</b> are {{directly}} or indirectly responsible for everything that occurs in a dialysis facility.

Involuntary discharges result in high costs to the patient, fam-ily, facility and payers. Consequently, End StageRenalDisease (ESRD) Networks oversee individual facility involuntary dis-charge rates. A large national survey found that involuntary discharges were due to disruptive behaviors, most commonly nonadherence to <b>medical</b> advice. <b>Medical</b> <b>directors</b> should cre-ate an environment designed to assure that disruptive behavior and conflict can be resolved.

40|$|Objectives: To derive {{and confirm}} scales {{measuring}} <b>medical</b> <b>director’s</b> attitudes about hospitalization {{of nursing home}} residents. Method: The authors surveyed nursing facility <b>medical</b> <b>directors</b> about the necessity of hospitalizing residents for eight clinical conditions and compared the ratings to those obtained from an expert panel to derive a relative hospitalization score. They also asked about factors that might influence hospitalization decisions. They performed a factor analysis to derive scales that measure attitudinal determinants of hospitalization and used the relative hospitalization score to confirm the scales. Results: The survey had a 79 % response rate. The relative hospitalization score demonstrated that <b>medical</b> <b>directors</b> were slightly less likely to recommend hospitalization than expert panel physicians. Factor analyses yielded 10 scales focusing on nursing home functioning, econom-ics, resident specific considerations, and physician attitudes. Eight of the 10 scales had significant bivariable associations with the relative hospitalization score, and 6 had significant multivariable associations. Discussion: <b>Medical</b> <b>directors</b> identify multiple determinants of hospitalization for nursing facility residents across several domains. Hospitalization decisions for nursing facility residents are complex and involve clinical and nonclinical factors...|$|R
