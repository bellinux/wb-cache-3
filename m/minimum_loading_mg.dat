Lower levels of <b>minimum</b> <b>load</b> are possible by either running only one gas turbine in combined-cycle mode or running one or two gas turbines in open cycle mode (this {{has the advantage of}} very short start-up times), but this means that the power plant operator needs to accept a substantial loss in efficiency. By contrast, a new coal-fired power plant has a lower <b>minimum</b> <b>load</b> of approximately 40 %, with further potential to reduce this to 20 – 25 %.

30|$|Finding an {{islanding}} solution with <b>minimum</b> <b>load</b> generation imbalance {{is indeed}} an NP-hard problem and {{considered as a}} special form of 0 – 1 knapsack problem [39]. This is why in this work we considered minimum power flow disruption instead of <b>minimum</b> <b>load</b> generation imbalance as the criterion for spectral clustering. It is a P-problem as can be converted into a minimum-cut problem and hence solved efficiently [40]. Consideration of generator coherency constraints during spectral clustering increases its complexity. However, this increased computational complexity can be overcome using recursive bisection to find island boundaries [41]. Thus, using minimum power flow disruption {{has the advantage of}} reducing the time complexity from NP-hard to P that makes the proposed DTW based islanding approach computationally efficient.|$|R

The MINIMUM ALL-OPTICAL ROUTING problem (given a list of pairs of nodes standing for as many point to point communication requests, assign to each request a route along with a wavelength so as to minimize {{the overall number of}} assigned wavelengths) has been paid a lot of attention and is known to be NP–hard. Rings, trees and meshes have thus been investigated as specific networks, but leading to just as many NP–hard problems. This paper investigates 1 -turn routings in meshes (paths are allowed one turn only).

40|$|A {{modeling}} tool {{has been developed}} {{which can be used}} to analyze interaction between intermittent wind power generation and thermal power plant generation in a regional electricity grid system. The model uses a mixed integer programming (MIP) approach to determine the power plant dispatch strategy which yields the lowest systems costs. In the model, each large thermal plant is described separately, including properties such as start-up time, start-up cost and <b>minimum</b> <b>load</b> level. The model is evaluated using western Denmark as a case study. For western Denmark, it is found that the inclusion of start-up performance (i. e. start-up time and related costs) and <b>minimum</b> <b>load</b> level of the power generating units {{have a significant impact on}} the results. It is shown that the inclusion of these aspects influences the analysis of the effect of wind power variations on the production patterns of thermal units in the system. The model demonstrates how the introduction of wind power production and associated variations change the dispatch order of the large thermal power plants in the western Denmark system so that the unit with the lowest running costs no longer has the highest capacity factor. It is shown that this effect only is detected if start-up performance and <b>minimum</b> <b>load</b> level limitations are included in the optimization. it can also be concluded that start-up performance and <b>minimum</b> <b>load</b> level must be taken into account if the total system costs and emissions are not to be underestimated. The simulations show that if these aspects are disregarded, both total costs and total emissions of the power system are underestimated, with 5 % in the case of western Denmark. Models such as the one developed in this work can be efficient tools to understand the effects of large-scale wind power integration in a power generation system with base load plants...|$|R

The employed admittance model considers loading of an initially spherical surface, and surface as well as subsurface loading is taken into account. Our results indicate that the gravity and topography data available at Tyrrhena Patera is consistent with the absence of subsurface loading, but the presence of a small subsurface load cannot be ruled out. We obtain <b>minimum</b> <b>load</b> densities of 2960 kg m− 3, <b>minimum</b> <b>load</b> thicknesses of 5 km, and <b>minimum</b> <b>load</b> volumes of 0. 6 × 106 km 3.

Best fitting model parameters are a load density of 3343 kg m− 3, a load thickness of 10. 8 km, and a load volume of 1. 7 × 106 km 3. These relatively large load densities indicate that lava compositions are comparable to those at other martian volcanoes, and densities are comparable to those of the martian meteorites.
