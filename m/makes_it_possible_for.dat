5|$|Like {{most state}} chief {{executives}} in the United States, the Governor is elected by the citizens of Maryland to serve a four-year term. Under the Constitution of Maryland, the Governor can run any number of times, {{but not more than}} twice in a row. This <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>possible</b> <b>for</b> a two-term governor to run for the office again after remaining out of office for at least one term. An eligible candidate for Governor must be at least 30 years old, and also a resident of and a registered voter in Maryland for the five years preceding the election. If a candidate meets this minimum requirement, he or she must file his or her candidacy with the Maryland State Board of Elections, pay a filing fee, file a financial disclosure, and create a legal campaign financial body. The Governor, like all statewide officials in Maryland, is elected in the even-numbered years in which the election for President of the United States does not occur.|$|E

5|$|Typical {{attachment}} development {{begins with}} unlearned infant reactions to social signals from caregivers. The ability to {{send and receive}} social communications through facial expressions, gestures and voice develops with social experience by seven to nine months. This <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>possible</b> <b>for</b> an infant to interpret messages of calm or alarm from face or voice. At about eight months, infants typically begin to respond with fear to unfamiliar or startling situations, and {{to look to the}} faces of familiar caregivers for information that either justifies or soothes their fear. This developmental combination of social skills and the emergence of fear reactions results in attachment behavior such as proximity-seeking, if a familiar, sensitive, responsive, and cooperative adult is available. Further developments in attachment, such as negotiation of separation in the toddler and preschool period, depend on factors such as the caregiver's interaction style and ability to understand the child's emotional communications.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} form of {{chromosomal}} crossover is homologous recombination, where the two chromosomes involved share very similar sequences. Non-homologous recombination can be damaging to cells, as it can produce chromosomal translocations and genetic abnormalities. The recombination reaction is catalyzed by enzymes known as recombinases, such as RAD51. The first step in recombination is a double-stranded break caused by either an endonuclease or damage to the DNA. A series of steps catalyzed in part by the recombinase then leads to joining of the two helices by at least one Holliday junction, in which a segment of a single strand in each helix is annealed to the complementary strand in the other helix. The Holliday junction is a tetrahedral junction structure that can be moved along the pair of chromosomes, swapping one strand for another. The recombination reaction is then halted by cleavage of the junction and re-ligation of the released DNA. Only strands of like polarity exchange DNA during recombination. There are two types of cleavage: east-west cleavage and north-south cleavage. The north-south cleavage nicks both strands of DNA, while the east-west cleavage has one strand of DNA intact. The formation of a Holliday junction during recombination <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>possible</b> <b>for</b> genetic diversity, genes to exchange on chromosomes, and expression of wild-type viral genomes.|$|E

25|$|Touchpads are {{primarily}} used in self-contained portable laptop computers {{and do not}} require a flat surface near the machine.

Touchpads also exist for desktop computers as an external peripheral, albeit rarely seen. Touchpads are sometimes integrated in some desktop computer keyboards, particularly keyboards oriented for HTPC use.|$|E

25|$|In recent years, some {{shows have}} moved their Tuesday show time {{an hour earlier}} to 7:00p.m. The {{rationale}} for the move was that since fewer tourists take in shows midweek then the Tuesday attendance, in particular, depends on the local audience. The earlier curtain <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>possible</b> <b>for</b> suburban patrons to get home by a reasonable hour after the show. Some shows, especially those produced by Disney, change their performance schedules fairly frequently depending on the season.

25|$|The Perspectives Project {{operates}} network notaries {{that clients}} {{can use to}} detect if a site's certificate has changed. By their nature, man-in-the-middle attacks place the attacker between the destination and a single specific target. As such, Perspectives would warn the target that the certificate delivered to the web browser does not match the certificate seen from other perspectives – the perspectives of other users in different times and places. Use of network notaries from a multitude of perspectives <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>possible</b> <b>for</b> a target to detect an attack even if a certificate appears to be completely valid.|$|E
25|$|Caudal: The {{upper and}} lower jaws are covered with sensory pits, visible as small, black {{speckles}} on the skin, the crocodilian version of the lateral line organs seen in fish and many amphibians, though arising from a completely different origin.

They respond to the slightest disturbance in surface water, detecting vibrations and small pressure changes {{as small as a}} single drop. This <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>possible</b> <b>for</b> crocodiles to detect prey, danger and intruders, even in total darkness. These sense organs are known as domed pressure receptors (DPRs).|$|E

25|$|Christians believe Jesus' {{death and}} resurrection <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>possible</b> <b>for</b> believers to attain {{forgiveness}} for sin and reconciliation with God through the atonement. Reformed Protestants generally subscribe to a particular view of the atonement called substitutionary atonement, which explains Christ's death as a sacrificial payment for sin. Christ {{is believed to have}} died in place of the believer, who is accounted righteous {{as a result of this}} sacrificial payment. Contemporary Reformed theologians such as William Placher and Nancy Duff have criticized this view, claiming it makes God appear abusive or vindictive and sanctions violence by the strong against the weak.|$|E
25|$|Sampan {{is a type}} of {{flat-bottom}} boat frequently seen in {{the shores}} of South China Sea, used by Cantonese, Hoklo, Vietnamese, and many other Southeast Asian ethnic groups. They are usually three to four meters in length and have small shelters on broad. This <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>possible</b> <b>for</b> fishermen to live on their own sampans. In major Cantonese cities such as Gwongzau and Hong Kong, it is a common sight to see crowds of sampans docked at the harbor. Thus, the image of sampan-filled harbor is strongly associated with Lingnan. Sampans also regularly show up in films and songs made by Cantonese.|$|E

This <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>possible</b> <b>for</b> the bees to convey always up-to-date directional information during their waggle dance, without having to make a comparison with the sun during long dance phases.
