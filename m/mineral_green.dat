Jaguar devised [...] "Insignia": a bespoke {{service for the}} XJ40/XJ81 (see below) and XJS, where prospective owners could specify special paint, trim, wood and wheels at additional cost in any given combination. 318 XJ40 Insignias were produced, most {{of them can be}} identified by the oblong gold-on-black [...] "Insignia" [...] badges on the front wings, and by their above-standard interiors.All of the interior trim was done in leather (two-tone colouring being an option), opposed to the leather-vinyl combinations used on regular-spec cars. Special paint colours were introduced for the Insignia: Mahogany, Amethyst Blue, <b>Mineral</b> <b>Green,</b> Primrose Pearl, Crystal Blue, Saturn Orange, Peppermint, Sandstone, White Pearl and Lavender.A number of Insignias were put onto the Jaguar demo fleet to do the round of the dealerships to show all the options available in the Insignia line.|$|E
40|$|Iron-rich (ferruginous) {{conditions}} were a prevalent {{feature of the}} ocean throughout much of Earth’s history. The nature of elemen-tal cycling in such settings is poorly understood, however, thus ham-pering reconstruction of paleoenvironmental conditions during key periods in Earth evolution. This is particularly true regarding con-trols on nutrient bioavailability, which is intimately linked to Earth’s oxygenation history. Elemental scavenging during precipitation of iron minerals exerts a major control on nutrient cycling in ferrugi-nous basins, and the predictable nature of removal processes provides a mechanism for reconstructing ancient ocean chemistry. Such recon-structions depend, however, on precise knowledge of the iron miner-als formed in the water column. Here, we combine mineralogical and geochemical analyses to demonstrate formation of the mixed-valence iron <b>mineral,</b> <b>green</b> rust, in ferruginous Lake Matano, Indonesia. Carbonated green rust (GR 1), along with signifi cant amounts of mag-netite, forms below the chemocline via the reduction of ferrihydrite. Further, we show that uptake of dissolved nickel, a key micronutrient required for methanogenesis, is signifi cantly enhanced during green rust formation, suggesting a major control on methane production in ancient ferruginous settings...|$|E
40|$|Dynamic and {{cellular}} histomorphometry of trabeculae {{is the most}} biologically relevant way of assessing steady state bone health. Traditional measurement involves manual visual feature identification by a trained and qualified professional. Inherent with this methodology is the time and cost expenditure, {{as well as the}} subjectivity that naturally arises under human visual inspection. In this work, we propose a rapidly deployable, automated, and objective method for dynamic histomorphometry. We demonstrate that our method is highly effective in assessing cellular activities in distal femur and vertebra of mice which are injected with calcein and alizarin complexone 7 and 2 days prior to sacrifice. The mineralized bone tissues of mice are cryosectioned using a tape transfer protocol. A sequential workflow is implemented in which endogenous fluorescent signals (bone <b>mineral,</b> <b>green</b> and red mineralization lines), tartrate resistant acid phosphatase identified by ELF- 97 and alkaline phosphatase identified by Fast Red are captured as individual tiled images of the section for each fluorescent color. All the images are then submitted to an image analysis pipeline that automates identification of the mineralized regions of bone and selection of a region of interest. The TRAP and AP stained images are aligne...|$|E

40|$|Hypoxic ground gas {{is rarely}} {{reported}} in London despite its frequent occurrence in the Upnor Formation and the serious {{health and safety}} implications for underground working. The death of two engineers by asphyxiation and recent interception of pressurised hypoxic gas by two ground investigation boreholes highlight {{the urgent need for}} research into this hazard which until now has been extremely limited. Glauconite is legally and widely assumed to cause the oxygen loss in confined spaces but this research proves it incapable of doing so. Visual inspection and laboratory analysis, using optical and infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction techniques confirm fresh glauconite within highly oxidised soil samples throughout the lower Lambeth Group and Thanet Sand Formation. The low concentration of pyrite and organic materials eliminates these as alternative causes. A poorly known but common bright blue-green <b>mineral,</b> <b>green</b> rust, is instead shown to be a very potent and plausible reducing agent. However, laboratory analysis under anoxic conditions has yet to prove its existence in the Upnor Formation, largely because of its extremely rapid oxidation, although the results are consistent with its presence in fresh samples. Significant preservation techniques were implemented to prevent oxidation of soil samples prior to laboratory analysis and improvements identified for future research. The presence of green rust during underground construction within the Upnor Formation will have serious implications for {{the health and safety of}} personnel. Measurements of soil suction, using the filter paper technique, show that the air entry value of the Lower Mottled Beds is such that they will act as an impermeable barrier to upward migration of hypoxic gas, trapping it within the underlying Upnor Formation. Field tests indicate that the gas is formed during periods of dewatering and may be influenced by changes in barometric pressure. Open Acces...|$|E

5000|$|In the Quaternary period, {{while the}} Rhine rift was subsiding, {{sediment}} {{made up of}} sand and gravel coming partly from the Vosges but above all from the Alps built up. The sediment thickness reaches 75 m in Strasbourg, 250 m in Neuf-Brisach, and 150 m in Mulhouse.

Thanks to their porosity, these weak rocks house Europe's largest water table.The estimated water quantity amounts to 300 billions cubic metres (of which 50 billions only in Alsace). Numerous sand and gravel pits can be encountered in the Ried, thus making Alsace one of the most productive regions in France, in terms of building materials.|$|R
