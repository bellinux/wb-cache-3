40|$|The {{detailed}} {{mechanisms for}} the borylation of alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl compounds, acrolein and <b>methylacrylate,</b> catalyzed by phosphine copper(I) boryl complexes were studied {{with the aid}} of density functional theory calculations. The results show that the catalyzed borylation occurs through C=C insertion into Cu-B to give a beta-borylalkyl C-bound Cu(I) enolate intermediate. In the borylation of acrolein, the C-bound Cu(I) enolate undergoes a keto-to-enol isomerization to give an O-bound enolate intermediate followed by a a-bond metathesis with a diboron reagent. In the borylation of <b>methylacrylate,</b> a keto-to-enol isomerization does not occur due to the inertness of the ester group. Alcoholysis or hydrolysis is necessary to convert the C-bound Cu(I) enolate intermediate efficiently to the borylation product and Cu(I) alkoxide that can easily undergo a-bond metathesis with a diboron reagent. The different borylation reaction mechanisms of acrolein and <b>methylacrylate</b> are closely related to the relative thermodynamic and kinetic stability of the C- and O-enolate intermediates involved in the reactions of the two different classes of substrates. The insertion reactions of ethene, formaldehyde, acrolein (2 -propenal, CH 2 =CH-CHO), and <b>methylacrylate</b> (CH 2 =CH-CO 2 Me) into a Cu-B bond were compared. It was found that the insertion barriers correlate very well with the orbital energies of the LUMOs calculated for the four substrates, supporting the notion that the insertion mainly involves a nucleophilic attack of the Cu-B a bond at the coordinated unsaturated substrate molecule. Although formaldehyde is more active than ethene in the insertion reaction, the reactivity of the C=C bond is greater than that of the C=O bond in alpha,beta-unsaturated aldehyde and ester. In addition, the thermodynamics and kinetics of interconversions between O- and C-bound enolates of Cu, B, and Si have been investigated...|$|E

The insertion reactions of alkenes into the Cu-B bond in (NHC) Cu(boryl) complexes (NHC = N-heterocyclic carbene) were studied via DFT calculations. The nature of the insertion reactions and the relevant regiochemistry were examined along with β-hydride eliminations followed by reinsertion of the alkene into the Cu-H bond. The relative reactivity of B 2 cat 2 versus B 2 pin 2 in the diboration reaction of alkenes catalyzed by carbene-ligated copper(I) complexes was studied using DFT calculations. Transmetallation reactions of B 2 cat 2 and B 2 pin 2 with (NHC) Cu-OMe were investigated. The detailed mechanism for the diboration of aldehydes catalyzed by (NHC) Cu(boryl) complexes was studied {{with the aid of}} DFT calculations. Aldehyde firstly inserted into Cu-B through a nucleophilic attack to give a Cu-O-C(boryl) species followed by σ-bond metathesis with a diboron reagent. We also studied the catalyzed diboration of 2 -pyridinecarboxaldehyde, which gave the unexpected reductive coupling product 1, 2 -di- 2 -pyridyl- 1, 2 -bis(pinacolboroxy) ethane. The detailed mechanism of the borylation of acrolein and <b>methylacrylate</b> catalyzed by phosphine copper(I) boryl complexes were theoretically investigated. The results showed that the catalyzed borylation occured through C=C insertion into Cu-B to give a β-borylalkyl C-bound Cu(I) enolate intermediate. In the borylation of acrolein, the C-bound Cu(I) enolate underwent a keto-to-enol isomerization to give an O-bound enolate intermediate followed by a σ-bond metathesis with a diboron reagent. While in the borylation of <b>methylacrylate,</b> a keto-to-enol isomerization did not occur due to the inertness of the ester group, but the addition of methanol enhanced the efficiency of the β-borylation. The insertion reactions of ethene, formaldehyde, acrolein and <b>methylacrylate</b> into a Cu-B bond were compared. In addition, the thermodynamics and kinetics of interconversions between O- and C-bound enolates of Cu, B, and Si were investigated. Carboxylation reactions of arylboronate esters with CO 2 catalyzed by (NHC) Cu(OMe) was studied by DFT calculations. Transmetalation proceeded via a B-O-Cu bridged intermediate, which was formed from the KOR adduct of the arylboronic acid, or by CuOR complex, was studied. Insertion of CO 2 into the Cu-Ar bond was found to be the rate-determining step, in which nucleophilic attack of the aryl ligand on the electron deficient carbon atom of CO 2 {{led to the formation of}} a new C-C bond.

Even for the difficult cases of ethyl and <b>methylacrylate,</b> that approach provides high polymerization yields and low polydispersity, allowing the molecular weight to be predetermined. LiOEEM/initiator molar ratio, solvent polarity, temperature and monomer concentration have proved to be key parameters in the control of the polymerization process. The efficiency of that control is however dependent on the monomer structure and improves with the length of the n-alkyl substituent, i. e., MA < EA < nBuA < nNonA. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Iron(II) {{dichloride}} complexes and iron(III) trichloride complexes were synthesized with a 2, 6 -bis(imino) pyridyl ligand {{and obtained}} in 78. 7 % and 47. 5 % theoretical experimental yield respectively. The {{results of the}} elemental analysis were {{in agreement with the}} expected values. The 2, 6 -diacetyl pyridine bis(2, 4, 6 -trimethylanil) iron(II) chloride catalysts was remarkable more active than the 2, 6 -diacetyl pyridine bis(2, 4, 6 -trimethylanil) iron(III) chloride catalyst. Initially, the catalysts were tested for the polymerization of ethylene, which occurred at relatively high activities (11, 158 kg HDPE / mol Fe h [mon]) at 35 C. Then we copolymerized ethylene and 1 -hexene using iron(III) based catalyst which also led to high activities results. We were able to copolymerize the polar monomer, <b>methylacrylate,</b> with ethylene using the iron(II) based catalyst, and we incorporated close to 1 mol % of methyl acrylate in the copolymer. GPC results show that the ethylene / methyacrylate copolymers have low polydispersities. TGA, DSC, FTIR, and H-NMR methods were used to characterize the copolymers...|$|E
40|$|Banana fiber (BF) -reinforced low-density {{polyethylene}} (LDPE) unidirectional composites were fabricated by the compression molding process with 40 wt% fiber loading. The fibers were modified with <b>methylacrylate</b> (MA) mixed with methanol (MeOH) along with 2 % benzyl peroxide under thermal curing method at different temperatures (50 – 90 °C) for different curing times (10 – 50 min) {{in order to}} have better compatibility with the matrix. The effect of fiber surface modification on the mechanical properties (tensile and impact properties) of the composites were evaluated. Monomer concentration, curing temperature, and curing time were optimized in terms of polymer loading and mechanical properties. The mechanical properties were found to be improved based on the improved interaction between the reinforcement and the matrix. Optimized BFs were again treated with 2 – 5 wt% starch solutions and composites made of 4 % starch treated BF showed the highest mechanical properties than that of MA treated composites. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was performed to get an insight into the morphology of the composites. Water uptake and soil degradation test of the composites were also investigated...|$|E
