5000|$|The Labour Party is {{the oldest}} {{political}} party formed and {{is still one of}} the main parties on the political front. Formed in 1936 by a group of people including Dr. Maurice Cure, Renganaden Seeneevasen, Professor Hassenjee and Emmanuel Anquetile among others. It is later led by the legendary Chacha Ramgoolam from 1948. The party in alliance with the <b>Muslim</b> <b>Action</b> <b>Committee</b> (CAM) and the Independent Forward Block (IFB) negotiated independence and end of colonial British rule in the country. It won the elections of 1967 and made an alliance with then main opposition party PMSD led by Gaetan Duval. They together passed a bill to postpone the 1972 elections to 1976. With continuous criticism and rather poor performance from 1971 and onward, it suffered a first electoral minor defeat in 1976. It managed to stay in power with the support of PMSD. It finally suffered a severe electoral defeat in 1982 and Seewoosagur Ramgoolam eventually resigned as Leader in the following year. From 1983 to 1991, Sir Satcam Boolell was leader of the party and supported the MSM-led government from 1983 to 1988. Navin Ramgoolam (son of chacha) was appointed as Leader in 1991 and restructured the torn party. Being the son of the father of the nation, his election became very emotional and the Labour Party won the 1995 elections (with a strategic alliance with the MMM). After the party lost in 2000, it came back in 2005 and won again the elections of 2010. It finally suffered a major defeat in the last 2014 elections.|$|E

40|$|The {{presented}} bachelor thesis <b>Action</b> <b>Committees</b> of the National Front and the Culture aims {{to present}} <b>action</b> <b>committees</b> {{as an institution}} that acted as a gearing-lever of the communist regime after February 1948. The thesis places great emphasis on their cathartic function - {{that is the way}} in which the society got rid of artists with a hostile look at the newly-built socialistic-democratic state. On the basis of specific cases not only penalty criteria are assessed, but also the selection of victims, political manipulation, and also a measure of the impact on personal and professional life of artists. Attention is also paid to the rising tide of protests against decisions of the <b>action</b> <b>committees</b> during the first half of 1948 and its suppression by a new law that re-legalized the activities of <b>action</b> <b>committees.</b> In the last part of the thesis activities of <b>action</b> <b>committees</b> in the second half of 1948 are depicted. This is the period when the main task of cleansing the society has already been achieved, therefore <b>action</b> <b>committees</b> slowly began to lose their status. My goal was to show the transformation of <b>action</b> <b>committees</b> from an institution, which society formed and reformed, into an organization that society merely tolerated...|$|R
40|$|Empirical {{public choice}} {{literature}} and casual observation {{suggest that the}} behavior of political <b>action</b> <b>committees</b> is remarkably unsophisticated, meaning that political <b>action</b> <b>committees</b> give to those legislators who would support their interests anyway. Thus, {{it is suggested that}} contributor behavior deviates from rational behavior, which is a cornerstone of economic analysis. In this paper, a switching regression model is estimated that allows for strategies of political <b>action</b> <b>committees</b> to vary for different contribution recipients. The author analyzes the behavior of farm political <b>action</b> <b>committees</b> over three election cycles. In contrast to previous findings, he finds that contributor behavior is not inconsistent with rational behavior. Copyright 1992 by University of Chicago Press. ...|$|R

40|$|The author {{develops}} a theoretical model that determines {{whether or not}} a firm sponsors a political <b>action</b> <b>committee</b> and, if it does, the quantity of funds that the political <b>action</b> <b>committee</b> will disburse.

Two related equations derived from the theoretical model [...] a probit equation for political <b>action</b> <b>committee</b> sponsorship and a disbursements equation [...] are estimated using pooled data on 226 government (primarily defense) contracting firms during the 1979 - 80 and 1981 - 82 election cycles.
