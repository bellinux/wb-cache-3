This paper documents {{the formation of a}} tornado in the U. S. using a mobile, rapidly scanning, Doppler radar. This radar, the MWR- 05 XP (<b>Meteorological</b> <b>Weather</b> <b>Radar,</b> 2005, X-band, Phased Array), electronically scans in elevation and azimuth over limited sectors, and mechanically in azimuth at high speed. While the radar scans electronically in elevation, the attitude of its beam is held nearly fixed in space because it electronically back scans in azimuth {{at the same rate as}} it mechanically scans. Back scanning in azimuth is accomplished by frequency hopping, while scanning in elevation is accomplished by changing the phase delay...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—A {{method for}} {{achieving}} extreme levels of compression of high-volume <b>weather</b> <b>radar</b> data is presented. Weather reflectivity contours, as per National Weather Service or custom thresholds, are processed by tracing their departure from a smoothed version {{to obtain the}} local extrema which serve as control points. The control points, which are transmitted in relative coordinates for further compression, are interpolated using a second-degree B-spline to retrieve the contours. The encoding–decoding method is capable of capturing the random undulations inherent in weather contours. It is shown that over two orders of magnitude of compression is possible without perceptible loss of meteorological information. Multiple enhancements to the basic method are quantitatively studied and compared with the existing methods for radar data compression.

40|$|The main {{phase of}} the {{moderately}} sized November 2004 eruption of the Grimsvotn volcano, located {{in the center of}} the 8100 km(2) Vatnajokull glacier, was monitored by the Icelandic <b>Meteorological</b> Office C-band <b>weather</b> <b>radar</b> in Keflavik, 260 km west of the volcano. The eruption plume reached a height of 6 - 10 km relative to the vent. The distribution of the most distal tephra was measured in the autumn of 2004, while the deposition on the glacier was mapped in the summers of 2005 and 2006. The tephra formed a well-defined layer on the glacier in the region north and northeast of the craters. The total mass of the tephra layer is quantitatively compared with the retrieved values, obtained from an improved version of the volcanic ash radar retrieval (VARR) algorithm. VARR was statistically calibrated with ground-based ash size distribution samples, taken at Vatnajokull, and by taking into account both antenna beam occlusion and wind-driven plume advection. The latter was implemented by using a space-time image phase-based cross-correlation technique. Accuracy of the <b>weather</b> <b>radar</b> records was also reviewed, noting that a large variability in the plume height estimation may be obtained using different approaches. The comparisons suggest that, at least for this subglacial eruption, the surface tephra mass, estimated by using the VARR inversion approach, is in a fairly good agreement with in situ measurements in terms of spatial extension, distribution, and amount...|$|R

40|$|Emerging {{technologies}} such as wireless local area networks and cellular telephones have dramatically increased the use of wireless communications services within the last 10 years. The shortage of available spectrum exists due to increasing demand for wireless services and current spectrum allocation regulations. To alleviate this shortage, Research aims to improve spectral efficiency and to allow spectrum sharing between separately managed and non-coordinating communications systems. This thesis explores the feasibility of spectrum sharing between airborne <b>weather</b> <b>radar</b> and wireless local area networks at 9. 3 GHz – 9. 5 GHz. Characteristics of flight paths of aircraft using airborne <b>weather</b> <b>radar</b> and the low duty cycle of radar transmissions offer unique opportunities for spectrum sharing. But {{it was found that}} the extremely sensitive receivers provide challenges for designing a communications system meant for widespread use. The probability of causing harmful interference to airborne <b>weather</b> <b>radar</b> is too great for most types of wireless local area networks, but a direct sequence spread spectrum scheme could share spectrum with airborne <b>weather</b> <b>radar.</b> Bit errors in wireless local area network links caused by airborne <b>weather</b> <b>radar</b> interference do not significantly decrease the performance of the wireless local area network system. The distribution of interference outside of the airborne <b>weather</b> <b>radar</b> receiver by using direct sequence spread spectrum combined with the acceptable bit error rates indicate that while spectrum sharing between airborne <b>weather</b> <b>radar</b> and wireless local area network at 9. 3 GHz – 9. 5 GHz is not feasible, direct sequence spread spectrum systems can share spectrum with airborne <b>weather</b> <b>radars</b> under more limited assumptions...|$|R

The method calculates rain rates from cloud liquid water path (LWP), particle effective radius, cloud thermodynamic phase and cloud top height. The accuracy of the precipitation detection and rain rate retrievals from SEVIRI is evaluated with <b>Weather</b> <b>Radar</b> observations. Rain rates from SEVIRI are compared against <b>Weather</b> <b>Radar</b> observations for an area over Northern Europe and a two month period. The <b>Weather</b> <b>Radar</b> observations are used to validate the instantaneous rain rate retrievals and accumulated rainfall sums (precipitation depths) across the entire study area and period. In addition, we evaluate the ability of SEVIRI to discriminate precipitating from non-precipitating clouds. The results show very high agreement (corr. ~ 0. 90) between amounts of precipitating clouds detected from <b>Weather</b> <b>Radar</b> and SEVIRI observations. Although weaker correlations (corr. ~ 0. 63) are found between the rain rate retrievals from <b>Weather</b> <b>Radar</b> and SEVIRI, the SEVIRI-retrievals still have an acceptable accuracy of about 0. 2 mm hr- 1 and a precision of about 0. 7 mm hr- 1. Part {{of the differences between}} <b>Weather</b> <b>Radar</b> and SEVIRI are explained by irregularities in the <b>Weather</b> <b>Radar</b> data due to residual sea clutter, and parallax shifts in the SEVIRI data.
