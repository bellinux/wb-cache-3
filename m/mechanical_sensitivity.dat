A {{variety of}} seemingly diverse pain syndromes {{are characterized by}} movement-induced pain radiating {{in the distribution of}} a peripheral nerve or nerve root. This could be explained by the induction of ectopic <b>mechanical</b> <b>sensitivity</b> in intact sensory axons.

40|$|The ampullae of Lorenzini, so {{characteristic}} of sharks and rays, {{have been examined}} by electrophysiological techniques, and were found not only very sensitive to thermal stimuli, but also remarkably responsive to weak mechanical and electrical stimuli. With these results, the ancient question about the function of these curious sense organs remained, however, unanswered. Subsequently, Dukgraaf and Kalmijn made a behavioral study of the electrical sensitivity of sharks and rays. They found 1. that the shark Scyliorhinus canicula and the ray Raja clavata react reflexly to very weak electric fields in the surrounding sea water, and 2. that the ampullae of Lorenzini are the sense organs by which these reflex actions are mediated. In the following years, Kalmjjn investigated especially the biological significance of the electrical sensitivity. It was demonstrated that 1, the plaice Pleuronectes platessa produces electric fields in the surrounding sea water that are sufficiently strong to be detected by sharks and rays, and 2. that the sharks and rays do not only respond reflexly to these fields, but are also capable of using them in localizing the plaice, even if it has burrowed into the sand. To what extent do sharks and rays in their natural habitat employ their electrical sensitivity? In order {{to answer this question}} it was necessary 1. to perform a more extensive study of the electric fields occurring in sea water, and 2, to determine the role these fields play in the life of sharks and rays. The first half of the three month stay at Banyuls was spent in collecting data on these two topics. What is the biological significance of the thermal and <b>mechanical</b> <b>sensitivities</b> of the ampullae of Lorenzini? Sand and Murray demonstrated the thermal and <b>mechanical</b> <b>sensitivities</b> in freshly killed specimens of which the ampullae of Lorenzini were partly or even completely severed {{from the rest of the}} animals. Moreover, they applied rather unnatural test stimuli. However, how do these sense organs respond in living animals to more natural stimuli? To examine this aspect, a method was developed by which the activity of the ampullary nerves could be recorded from live, free-swimming sharks. The preliminary results were promising, but, due to lack of experimental animals, this method could not be applied extensively in Utrecht, Therefore, the second half of the time available at Banyuls was reserved for these experiments...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: High-frequency {{electrical}} stimulation (HFS) of human skin induces {{not only an}} increased pain sensitivity in the conditioning area but also an increased pain <b>sensitivity</b> to <b>mechanical</b> punctate stimuli in the non-conditioned surrounding skin area. The aim {{of the present study}} was to investigate whether this heterotopically increased <b>mechanical</b> pain <b>sensitivity</b> can be facilitated through the induction of negative expectations. METHODS: In two independent conditions [a nocebo (n = 15) and control condition (n = 15) ], we applied mechanical pain stimuli before, directly after, 10 min and 20 min after HFS in the skin area surrounding the conditioning area, and measured the reported pain intensity [visual analogue scale (VAS) ]. All subjects (of both conditions) received a written instruction about the HFS protocol, but only the instruction in the nocebo condition was extended by the following text (in Dutch) : 'After the HFS, your skin will become more sensitive to the pinprick stimulation'.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the design and}} application of a lever coupling mechanism to improve the shock resistance of a dual-mass silicon micro-gyroscope with drive mode coupled along the driving direction without sacrificing the <b>mechanical</b> <b>sensitivity.</b> Firstly, the <b>mechanical</b> <b>sensitivity</b> and the shock response of the micro-gyroscope are theoretically analyzed. In the mechanical design, a novel lever coupling mechanism is proposed to change the modal order and to improve the frequency separation. The micro-gyroscope with the lever coupling mechanism optimizes the drive mode order, increasing the in-phase mode frequency to be {{much larger than the}} anti-phase one. Shock analysis results show that the micro-gyroscope structure with the designed lever coupling mechanism can notably reduce the magnitudes of the shock response and cut down the stress produced in the shock process compared with the traditional elastic coupled one. Simulations reveal that the shock resistance along the drive direction is greatly increased. Consequently, the lever coupling mechanism can change the gyroscope’s modal order and improve the frequency separation by structurally offering a higher stiffness difference ratio. The shock resistance along the driving direction is tremendously enhanced without loss of the <b>mechanical</b> <b>sensitivity...</b>|$|E
40|$|Several models {{concerning}} {{the sensitivity of}} capacitive pressure sensors have been presented in the past. Modelling of condenser microphones, which can {{be considered to be}} a special type of capacitive pressure sensor, usually requires a more complicated analysis of the sensitivity, because they have a strong electric field in the air gap. It is found that the <b>mechanical</b> <b>sensitivity</b> of condenser microphones with a circular diaphragm, either with a large initial tension or without any initial tension, increases with increasing bias voltage (and the corresponding static deflection), whereas the <b>mechanical</b> <b>sensitivity</b> of other capacitive pressure sensors does not depend on the static deflection. It is also found that the <b>mechanical</b> <b>sensitivity</b> increases with increasing input capacitance of a preamplifier. In addition, the open-circuit electrical sensitivity and, consequently, the total sensitivity too, also increases with increasing bias voltage (or static deflection). However, the maximum allowable sound pressure at which the diaphragm collapses, an effect that has to be taken into account, decreases with increasing static deflection in most cases, ulthnately resulting in an optimum value for the bias voltage.

40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} {{the relationship between}} NF-κB activity, cytokine levels, and pain sensitivities in a rodent model of osteoarthritis (OA). Method: OA was induced in transgenic NF-κB luciferase reporter mice via mono-iodoacetate (MIA) intra-articular injection. Using luminescent imaging we evaluated the temporal kinetics of NF-κB activity {{and its relationship to}} the development of pain sensitivities and serum cytokine levels in this model. Results: MIA induced a transient increase in joint-related NF-кB activity at early time points (day 3 post-injection) and an associated biphasic pain (mechanical allodynia) response. NF-кB activity, serum IL- 6, IL- 1 β, and IL- 10 accounted for ~ 75 % of the variability in pain-related <b>mechanical</b> <b>sensitivities</b> in this model. Specifically, NF-кB activity was strongly correlated to mechanical allodynia and serum IL- 6 levels in the inflammatory pain phase of this model (day 3), while serum IL- 1 β was strongly correlated to pain sensitivities in the chronic pain phase of the model (day 28). Conclusion: Our findings suggest that NF-кB activity, IL- 6 and IL- 1 β may be playing distinct roles in pain sensitivity development in this model of arthritis and may act to distinguish the acute from chronic pain phases of this model.

At day 1, there was a significant increase in <b>mechanical</b> <b>sensitivity</b> in animals injected with CFA + vehicle (n = 7) relative to those injected with vehicle alone (n = 7, P < 0. 05), and co-injection of AP 5 (n = 6) or Ifenprodil (n = 7) with CFA blocked this hypersensitivity. Subcutaneous injection of AP 5 (n = 7) and Ifenprodil (n = 5) instead of into the TMJ had no significant effect on CFA-induced hypersensitivity of the TMJ region.

40|$|Abstract Background Trigeminal nerve is a {{major source}} of the sensory input of the face, and trigeminal {{neuropathology}} models have been reported in rodents with injury to branches of the maxillary or mandibular division of the trigeminal nerve. Non-human primates are neuroanatomically more closely related to human than rodents; however, nerve injury studies in non-human primates are limited. Results We describe here a nerve injury model of maxillary nerve compression (MNC) in the cynomolgus macaque monkey, Macaca fascicularis, and the initial characterization of the consequences of damage to this trigeminal nerve branch. The nerve injury from the compression appeared to be mild, as we did not observe overt changes in home-cage behavior in the monkeys. When mechanical stimulation was applied to the facial area, monkeys with MNC displayed increased <b>mechanical</b> <b>sensitivity,</b> as the avoidance response scores were lower than those from the control animals. Such a change in <b>mechanical</b> <b>sensitivity</b> appeared to be somewhat bilateral, as the contralateral side also showed increased <b>mechanical</b> <b>sensitivity,</b> although the change on the ipsilateral side was more robust. Multiple-unit recording of the maxillary nerve showed a general pattern of increasing responsiveness to escalating force in mechanical stimulation on the contralateral side. Ipsilateral side of the maxillary nerve showed a lack of responsiveness to escalating force in mechanical stimulation, possibly reflecting a maximum stimulation threshold effect from sensitized nerve due to MNC injury. Conclusions These results suggest that MNC may produce increased sensitivity of the ipsilateral maxillary nerve, and that this model may serve as a non-human primate model to evaluate the effect of injury to trigeminal nerve branches. </p...|$|E

Aims were to investigate how sensory, autonomic and motor function change {{in the course of}} the disease. 19 CRPS-I patients (17 with acute, 2 with chronic CRPS, mean duration of disease 5. 7 ± 8. 3, range 1 - 33 months) were examined with questionnaires (LANSS, NPS, MPI, Quick DASH, multiple choice list of descriptors for sensory, motor, autonomic symptoms), motor and autonomic tests as well as quantitative sensory testing according to the German Research Network on Neuropathic Pain at two visits (baseline and 36 ± 10. 6, range 16 - 53 months later). CRPS-I patients had an improvement of sudomotor and vasomotor function, but still a great impairment of sensory and motor function upon follow-up. Although pain and mechanical detection improved upon follow-up, thermal and <b>mechanical</b> pain <b>sensitivity</b> increased, including the contralateral side. Increase in <b>mechanical</b> pain <b>sensitivity</b> and loss of mechanical detection were associated with presence of ongoing pain. The results demonstrate that patients with CRPS-I show a sensitization of the nociceptive system {{in the course of the}} disease, for which ongoing pain seems to be the most important trigger. They further suggest that measured loss of function in CRPS-I is due to pain-induced hypoesthesia rather than a minimal nerve lesion. In conclusion, this article gives evidence for a pronociceptive pain modulation profile developing in the course of CRPS and thus helps to assess underlying mechanisms of CRPS that contribute to the maintenance of patients' pain and disability...|$|R
40|$|Cancer-induced bone pain (CIBP), due to bony metastases, {{is a major}} {{clinical}} problem, significantly reducing {{quality of}} life in cancer patients. Current therapies often provide inadequate analgesia or unacceptable side effects. The aim of this thesis was to characterise behaviours of a preclinical model of CIBP and test novel analgesic interventions in this model. A secondary aim was to investigate the involvement of the N-methyl-D-Aspartate (NMDA) receptors and TRP channels (TRPM 8, TRPV 1 and TRPV 4) in CIBP. Investigation of CIBP in a preclinical model may lead to better pain management in CIBP patients. The results presented here demonstrate that this model of CIBP develops behaviours that may be indicative of <b>mechanical</b> allodynia, thermal <b>sensitivity,</b> movement-evoked pain, ongoing pain and spontaneous pain. This suggests that this model reflects the clinical condition of CIBP, where patients suffer from constant background pain with spontaneous and movement-related breakthrough pain. In this study it was found that radiotherapy significantly attenuated movement-evoked pain and thermal sensitivity to 20 °C and 40 °C. XRT also significantly reduced anxiety and risk assessment behaviours (grooming behaviour and number of protected stretch attends) compared to untreated CIBP. Duloxetine attenuated CIBP-induced <b>mechanical</b> allodynia, thermal <b>sensitivity</b> to 40 °C and movement-evoked pain, whereas S,S-reboxetine attenuated thermal sensitivity to 40 °C but did not effect CIBP-induced mechanical allodynia or movement-evoked pain. In addition, CB 65 attenuated movement-evoked pain and thermal sensitivity to 40 °C. A single dose of gabapentin did not attenuate CIBP-induced <b>mechanical</b> allodynia, thermal <b>sensitivity</b> to 40 °C or movement-evoked pain. These studies confirm that the CIBP model shows characteristics and pharmacological sensitivities consistent with known and predicted mechanisms and validate it as a useful model for assessing potential new treatments proposed for use in patients. Behavioural results suggest that NMDA receptors containing the NR 2 A subunit are involved in CIBP-induced movement-evoked pain. This suggests that NR 2 A antagonists may be useful for treating CIBP-induced movement-evoked pain. Additionally, results show that there is increased expression of NR 2 A in the laminae I, II and III in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. XRT treated animals also showed increased expression of NR 2 A in laminae I and II. The selective involvement of NR 2 A in CIBP is different to other chronic pain states, for example, neuropathic pain states that appear to involve the NR 2 B subunit. The TRPV 1 antagonist AMG 9810 did not attenuate <b>mechanical</b> allodynia, thermal <b>sensitivity</b> to 40 °C or movement-evoked pain. Interestingly, the TRPM 8 agonist icilin attenuated movement-evoked pain, which suggests that icilin might be useful in the treatment of movement-evoked pain. The TRPV 4 antagonist RN 1734 attenuated <b>mechanical</b> allodynia, thermal <b>sensitivity</b> to 40 °C and movement-evoked pain in CIBP. This suggests RN 1734 may be useful in the treatment of <b>mechanical</b> allodynia, thermal <b>sensitivity</b> to 40 °C and movement-evoked pain in CIBP. Results show that the expression of TRPV 4 is increased in DRG ipsilateral to the cancerbearing tibia. In conclusion, these results show that the preclinical model of CIBP investigated in this thesis is suitable for testing novel analgesic interventions. This thesis identified some useful targets for the analgesic treatment of CIBP and results suggest that many different mechanisms contribute to CIBP. A point to consider is that any robust effective treatment may need to target all (or at least several) of these mechanisms...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{contaminants}} on the <b>mechanical</b> impact <b>sensitivity</b> of Teflon, stainless steel, and aluminum in a high-pressure oxygen environment was investigated. Uncontaminated Teflon did not ignite under the test conditions. The liquid contaminants - cutting oil, motor lubricating oil, and toolmaker dye - caused Teflon to ignite. Raising the temperature lowered the impact energy required for ignition. Stainless steel was insensitive to ignition under the test conditions with the contaminants used. Aluminum appeared to react without contaminants under certain test conditions; however, contamination with cutting oil, motor lubricating oil, and toolmakers dye increased {{the sensitivity of}} aluminum to mechanical impact. The grit contaminants silicon dioxide and copper powder did not conclusively affect the sensitivity of aluminum...|$|R
