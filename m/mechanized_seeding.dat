Dessa forma, objetivou-se no presente trabalho avaliar o desempenho operacional do conjunto mecanizado trator-semeadora-adubadora na qualidade da semeadura mecanizada de amendoim em função de densidades de semeadura (10, 14 e 18 sementes m- 1) e tamanhos de sementes (21 e 23 mm), tanto quanto avaliar o desempenho operacional do conjunto trator-arrancador-invertedor e o possível efeito do teor de água do solo e da população de plantas sobre as perdas quantitativas no arranquio mecanizado de amendoim. Observou-se que o desempenho operacional do conjunto trator-semeadora-adubadora foi homogêneo. Para as sementes de 23 mm o número médio de dias para emergência foi menor e a porcentagem de germinação {{superior}}, ocorrendo o contrário para a densidade de semeadura de 18 sementes m- 1. Quanto maior a densidade de semeadura maior foi o estande de plantas, sendo que a semente de 23 mm obteve os melhores resultados, em que a mesma, na densidade de semeadura de 14 sementes m- 1, apresentou alta porcentagem de espaçamentos normais. Com relação á cobertura vegetal aos 60 DAS as sementes de 23 mm foi superior apenas na densidade de semeadura de 18 sementes m- 1. As densidades de 14 e 18 sementes m- 1 refletiram em maiores produtividades sendo sempre superior para as sementes de 23 mm. As maiores perdas visíveis e totais ocorreram para a população de 141. 144 plantas ha- 1 e para o teor de água do solo de 19, 3 %. Os teores de água do solo e as populações de plantas não influenciaram o desempenho do conjunto trator-arrancador-invertedorPeanut crop mechanization {{has been}} improved over the years, however there are drawbacks {{that affect the}} quality of operations. Thus, this paper’s objectives were to evaluate the operational performance of the mechanized tractor-seeder-fertilizer set and parameters for evaluating the quality of <b>mechanized</b> <b>seeding</b> of peanut crop according to seeding densities and seed sizes, as well as evaluate the operational performance of the tractor-digger set and the possible effect of the water content of the soil and plant population over the quantitative losses on the mechanical peanut digging. It was observed that the operational performance of the tractor-seeder-fertilizer set was homogeneous. The 23 mm seed had the number of days to emergence shorter and a higher percentage of germination, occurring the opposite to the 18 seeds. m- 1 seeding density. The higher the seeding density, the largest plant stand was, whereas the 23 mm seed obtained the best results, and the same with the 14 seeds. m- 1 seeding density that had a higher percentage of normal spacing. Regarding the vegetation cover at 60 DAS, the seed 23 mm was greater than the other at the 18 seeds. m- 1 seeding density. The densities of 14 and 18 seeds. m- 1 reflected in higher yields, being always superior than the 23 mm seed. The largest visible losses and total losses occurred to the 141. 144 plants. ha- 1 population and for soil water content of 19. 3 %. The water content of the soil and plant populations did not affect the performance of the peanut tractor-digger se...|$|E
40|$|PROBLEM: The use of {{eelgrass}} (Zostera marina) seeds {{is increasingly}} being {{recognized as a}} viable option for both small- and large-scale restoration projects. Although methods for hand-collecting, processing and storing eelgrass seeds have advanced to match the scale of collections, the number of seeds collected has limited the scale of restoration efforts, {{as well as the}} scale of ecologically relevant experiments. Recent experience with mechanized harvest of reproductive shoots has transcended the limitations of scale imposed upon divers working underwater during springtime with often severe weather limitations. Processing and storage methodologies and infrastructure previously scaled to hand collection now pose a bottleneck to the expansion of restoration and research to larger, previously unachievable scales. PURPOSE: The purpose of this research was to develop methodologies for achieving the full potential for large-scale restoration presented by <b>mechanized</b> eelgrass <b>seed</b> harvesting. The specific goal in this project was to develop techniques and infrastructure to fully exploit potential <b>mechanized</b> <b>seed</b> harvesting capabilities, and to identify optimal conditions for storage and survival of large volumes of harvested seeds.

5000|$|One of {{the first}} {{mechanical}} devices used in agriculture was the seed drill invented by Jethro Tull around 1700. The seed drill allowed more uniform spacing of seed and planting depth than hand methods, increasing yields and saving valuable <b>seed.</b> <b>Mechanized</b> agriculture greatly increased {{in the late eighteenth}} and early nineteenth centuries with horse drawn reapers and horse powered threshing machines. [...] By the late nineteenth century steam power was applied to threshing and steam tractors appeared. Internal combustion began being used for tractors in the early twentieth century. Threshing and harvesting was originally done with attachments for tractors, but in the 1930s independently powered combine harvesters were in use.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} extent to which {{agricultural}} modernization affects women’s status. Agricultural modernization refers to the ever-increasing use of farm implements and techniques that have previously not existed or have not been used in the local setting. These implements and techniques generally intend to imitate the western model of industrial agriculture, making large-scale cultivation more feasible. Examples of agricultural modernization include, but are not limited to, improved seeds, chemical fertilizers, tractors and <b>mechanized</b> threshers. Improved <b>seeds</b> are defined as seeds that are created by a laboratory and later sold to farmers; certainly hybrid seeds in the purist sense have existed for millennia as farmers knowingly cross-bred their plants for desirable traits. Biotech or genetically modified seeds are a subset at the most technologically advanced end of improved seeds, and these are seeds that contain genes not native to their own species [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Sweet sorghum is {{a unique}} {{multipurpose}} crop and of late widely promoted as biofuel crop. Its ability to produce grains for food/feed and stalks for fuel/ feed makes {{it one of the}} popular choices in the dryland regions. This crop is now widely grown in many of the countries as a feasible biofuel crop under different climatic conditions because of short its growing period and low water requirement (Soltani and Almodares 1994) as compared to sugarcane. When compared to other biofuel crops, sweet sorghum is best suited for ethanol production because of its higher total reducing sugar content (Huligol et al. 2004). Further, its suitability for <b>mechanized</b> crop production, <b>seed</b> propagation and higher ethanol production capacity of sweet sorghum have drawn the attention of researchers. The bagasse from sweet sorghum after the extraction of juice has a higher biological value in terms of micronutrients and minerals than the bagasse from sugarcane when used as animal feed (Seetharama et al. 2002). It can also be processed as a feed for ruminant animals. The crushed stalk contains similar levels of cellulose as sugarcane bagasse, and therefore is a good prospect as raw material for pulp and briquette making (for fuel purposes). Many attempts were made to use sweet sorghum for ethanol production in a centralized model of crushing the stalk for juice at the industry level. However, this model had some difficulties as the raw material availability was restricted for small period in a year apart from the problems of transportation of stalk from the farmer’s fields to distillers...|$|R
