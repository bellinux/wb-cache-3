In a column titled [...] "The real story behind the Armitage story", Novak stated: [...] "First, Armitage did not, as he now indicates, merely pass on something he had heard and that he 'thought' might be so. Rather, he identified to me the CIA division where Mrs. Wilson worked, and said flatly that she recommended the mission to Niger by her husband, former Ambassador Joseph Wilson. Second, Armitage did not slip me this information as idle chitchat, as he now suggests. He made clear he considered it especially suited for <b>my</b> <b>column...</b> {{he noted that the}} story of Mrs. Wilson's role fit the style of the old Evans-Novak column — implying to me it continued reporting Washington inside information." [...] Novak also disputes Armitage's claim that he learned he was Novak's [...] "primary source" [...] (Novak's phrase) only after reading Novak's October 1 column: [...] "I believed [...] contacted me October 1 because of news the weekend of September 27–28 that the Justice Department was investigating the leak." ...|$|E

Allan attributed her burgeoning career as a factor: [...] "I was obsessed with <b>my</b> <b>column.</b> I was intent on becoming the best journalist in the country." [...] They remained friends and Schachat supported Allan's testimony in the 1992 libel suit she brought against Channel 4 in London. Allan told a London court that eight years after their marriage breakup, Schachat was her closest friend and described their union as [...] "the right people at the wrong time." [...] Allan writes about the marriage to Schachat in her 2015 memoir, Jani Confidential: [...] "I keep thinking about what happened and what I would have done differently. Pretty much everything I suppose. Gordon had to live through the weekly angst about the column. It was like reinventing the wheel every week. My validity as a partner hinged - or so I thought - on my success as a columnist. I couldn't have got it more wrong.

2500|$|I {{was curious}} why a {{high-ranking}} official in President Bill Clinton's National Security Council (NSC) was given this assignment. Wilson {{had become a}} vocal opponent of President Bush's policies in Iraq after contributing to Al Gore {{in the last election}} cycle and John Kerry in this one. During a long conversation with a senior administration official, I asked why Wilson was assigned the mission to Niger. He said Wilson had been sent by the CIA's counter-proliferation section at the suggestion of one of its employees, his wife. It was an offhand revelation from this official, who is no partisan gunslinger. When I called another official for confirmation, he said: [...] "Oh, you know about it." [...] The published report that somebody in the White House failed to plant this story with six reporters and finally found me as a willing pawn is simply untrue. At the CIA, the official designated to talk to me denied that Wilson's wife had inspired his selection but said she was delegated to request his help. He asked me not to use her name, saying she probably never again will be given a foreign assignment but that exposure of her name might cause [...] "difficulties" [...] if she travels abroad. He never suggested to me that Wilson's wife or anybody else would be endangered. If he had, I would not have used her name. I used it in the sixth paragraph of <b>my</b> <b>column</b> because it looked like the missing explanation of an otherwise incredible choice by the CIA for its mission.|$|E

That frees me to reveal my role in the federal inquiry that, {{at the request of}} Fitzgerald, I have kept secret." [...] Novak dispels rumors that he asserted his Fifth Amendment right and made a plea bargain, stating: [...] "I have cooperated in the investigation." [...] He continues: For nearly the entire time of his investigation, Fitzgerald knew — independent of me — the identity of the sources I used in <b>my</b> <b>column</b> of July 14, 2003. That Fitzgerald did not indict any of these sources may indicate his conclusion that none of them violated the Intelligence Identities Protection Act.... In my sworn testimony, I said what I have contended in my columns and on television: Joe Wilson's wife's role in instituting her husband's mission was revealed to me {{in the middle of a}} long interview with an official who I have previously said was not a political gunslinger. After the federal investigation was announced, he told me through a third party that the disclosure was inadvertent on his part. Following my interview with the primary source, I sought out the second administration official and the CIA spokesman for confirmation. I learned Valerie Plame's name from Joe Wilson's entry in [...] "Who's Who in America." [...] (Italics added.)

2500|$|In 1999, {{near the}} height of the dot com boom, The New York Times {{approached}} Krugman to write a bi-weekly column on [...] "the vagaries of business and economics in an age of prosperity." [...] His first columns in 2000 addressed business and economic issues, but as the 2000 US presidential campaign progressed, Krugman increasingly focused on George W. Bush's policy proposals. According to Krugman, this was partly due to [...] "the silence of the media – those 'liberal media' conservatives complain about..." [...] Krugman accused Bush of repeatedly misrepresenting his proposals, and criticized the proposals themselves. After Bush's election, and his perseverance with his proposed tax cut {{in the midst of the}} slump (which Krugman argued would do little to help the economy but substantially raise the fiscal deficit), Krugman's columns grew angrier and more focused on the administration. As Alan Blinder put it in 2002, [...] "There's been a kind of missionary quality to his writing since then ... He's trying to stop something now, using the power of the pen." [...] Partly as a result, Krugman's twice-weekly column on the Op-Ed page of The New York Times has made him, according to Nicholas Confessore, [...] "the most important political columnist in America... he is almost alone in analyzing the most important story in politics in recent years – the seamless melding of corporate, class, and political party interests at which the Bush administration excels." [...] In an interview in late 2009, Krugman said his missionary zeal had changed in the post-Bush era and he described the Obama administration as [...] "good guys but not as forceful as I'd like...When I argue with them in <b>my</b> <b>column</b> this is a serious discussion. We really are in effect speaking across the transom here." [...] Krugman says he's more effective at driving change outside the administration than inside it, [...] "now, I'm trying to make this progressive moment in American history a success. So that's where I'm pushing." ...|$|E
