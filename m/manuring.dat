25|$|The Tamil people practiced a very {{systematic}} {{method of}} cultivation during the Sangam age. It was known that ploughing, <b>manuring,</b> weeding, irrigation and crop protection {{need to be}} followed in a proper way for the yield to be rich. Tiruvalluvar, in his Tirukkural, emphasizes the need {{for all of these}} steps to be undertaken in a careful manner {{in order to get a}} good yield. A paddy field was also known as Kalam and was ploughed with the help of oxen. Ploughed lands were leveled by the peasants using their feet, followed by the planting of the paddy seeds. Once the seeds grew into saplings, they were transplanted and when the crop was mature, it was harvested. Weeds were removed periodically. Paddy was removed from the harvested stalks by beating on the ground or by getting bullocks to tread on them. Cleared paddy was collected, measured and stored in proper containers. Millets were grown on the Pinpulam or the dry lands and in the Kurinji region. Crop rotation was followed – for instance, cotton and millets were grown simultaneously on the same plot and after that, beans were cultivated on it.|$|E
25|$|Among {{the five}} {{geographical}} {{divisions of the}} Tamil country in Sangam literature, the Marutam region was the most fit for cultivation, as it had the most fertile lands. The prosperity of a farmer depended on getting the necessary sunlight, seasonal rains and the fertility of the soil. Among these elements of nature, sunlight was considered indispensable by the ancient Tamils, because if rains fail other methods of irrigation could be put to use and if the soil wasn't naturally fertile, artificial <b>manuring</b> would enrich the soil. They differentiated the lands {{on the basis of}} fertility and accordingly cultivated the crops that were best suited for the kind of soil. They were Vanpulam (hardland), Menpulam (fertile land), Pinpulam (dry land) and Kalarnilam or Uvarnilam (salty land). Vanpulam in Mullai and Kurinji regions did not yield rich produce, whereas in Menpulam the yield was very good. Dry crops were cultivated on Pinpulam, because of the limited irrigation facilities. The Kalarnilam was unfit for cultivation. Some of the types of soil known to the people of this age were the alluvial soil, red soil, black soil, laterite soil and sandy soil and they knew what crops could be grown on each type of soil.|$|E

After the death of four men from influenza in 1926, there was a succession of crop failures in the 1920s. Investigations by the University of Aberdeen into the soil where crops had been grown have shown that there had been contamination by lead and other pollutants, caused by the use of seabird carcasses and peat ash in the manure used on the fields. This occurred over a lengthy period of time, as <b>manuring</b> practices became more intensive, and may have been a factor in the evacuation. The last straw came with the death of a young woman, Mary Gillies, who fell ill with appendicitis in January 1930 and was taken to the mainland for treatment. [...] She later died in hospital. For many years it was assumed that she had died of appendicitis, but her son Norman John Gillies discovered in 1991 that she had in fact died of pneumonia, having given birth to a daughter who also died.

Peasants grew turmeric plants {{in front of their}} houses and laid flower gardens in between the houses. Farmers believed that [...] ploughing, <b>manuring,</b> weeding, irrigation and the protection of crops must be done according to a specific method in order to obtain a good yield. A wide range of tools needed for agriculture, from ploughing to harvesting, were manufactured. The basic tool was the plough also known as meli, nanchil and kalappai. Palliyadutal referred to the process of removing weeds using a toothed implement attached to a plank and drawn by oxen. Lower-class peasants used stone sling devices to scare animals and birds away from the standing crops. Sickles were used for harvesting mature rice paddies. Since the rivers of the region were not perennial, several irrigation techniques were developed to ensure an adequate and continuous supply of water. Farmers used a bullock-propelled device called Kapilai for bailing out water from deep wells and a manual setup called Erram, for shallow wells. Tanks, lakes and dams were used as water storage systems and the water regulated using sluices and shutters.

The greater influence of the well-rotted farm <b>manure</b> was undoubtedly due to the greater decomposition occurring in that material than in the artificial <b>manures.</b> The nitrification studies in sand cultures in the greenhouse indicated that nitrate accumulation was depressed by the additions of farm <b>manure</b> and artificial <b>manures,</b> there being just as great a depression from the farm <b>manure</b> in 71 / 2 and 15 ton applications as from the artificial <b>manures.</b> The nitrifying power of the sand cultures was increased by the treatments, the artificial <b>manures,</b> in some cases, having a greater effect than the farm <b>manure.</b> The straw-clover <b>manure</b> and the sweet clover <b>manure</b> showed a greater effect than the farm <b>manure.</b> Apparently the greater nitrification brought about by the treatments was followed by a greater assimilation and, hence, there was a lower content of nitrates at 11 dates of sampling. In this test the artificial <b>manures</b> and the farm <b>manure</b> seemed to have similar effects on nitrification, but the artificial <b>manures,</b> in some cases, had a greater stimulative influence on the oats grown than did the farm <b>manure.</b> In the nitrate assimilation experiment in the laboratory, the application of farm <b>manure</b> appreciably stimulated the development of the nitrate assimilating organisms in the Carrington loam. The oats straw and the straw <b>manure</b> brought about a greater stimulation, but the artificial <b>manures</b> in general showed a smaller stimulation on this group of organisms. It is apparent that the artificial <b>manures</b> had no greater influence in increasing nitrate assimilation than did farm <b>manure.</b> These results were confirmed by later tests in the greenhouse and in the field on the Carrington loam, but it was noted that those artificial <b>manures,</b> which were not so well decomposed when applied to the soil, stimulated these nitrate assimilating organisms more and the effects persisted in the soil for a longer period. In the greenhouse experiments on Carrington loam, the artificial <b>manures</b> and farm <b>manure</b> had very similar effects on nitrate production, and while the influence on nitrification was not quite so great at first, the later effects were greater than those produced by farm <b>manure.</b> The influence of the various <b>manures</b> was similar on the crop of oats grown in this test. Field experiments on the Webster loam in 1926 and 1927 and on the Carrington loam in 1928 and 1929 with variously prepared artificial <b>manures</b> in comparison with farm <b>manure</b> indicate that nitrate assimilation, nitrification, nitrate accumulation and the numbers of bacteria, molds and actinomycetes were very similarly affected by the additions of the various <b>manures.</b> The yields of corn were also influenced in a very similar way by the artificial <b>manures</b> and farm <b>manure,</b> altho in some instances there were differences in yields which were out of line with the general trend of the results. From the results as a whole it is apparent that the proper composting of straw and cellulose residues may permit the production of artificial <b>manures</b> which will give similar effects on bacteriological conditions in the soil and on crop yields to those occasioned by farm <b>manure.</b> There is a similar stimulation in the nitrification process and in the numbers of organisms, and while nitrate assimilation is also stimulated by the artificial <b>manures,</b> the influence on this process is no greater than that produced by farm <b>manure.</b> While, therefore, there may be a reduced content of nitrates in the soils following the addition of these artificial <b>manures,</b> there is no greater reduction than that brought about by farm <b>manure.</b> As farm <b>manure</b> has a well-known beneficial effect on crop growth, it is apparent that there need be no deleterious effect from well-decomposed artificial <b>manures</b> either on crop yields or on soil conditions in general. In fact it would seem that quite as large beneficial effects should be exerted, and any increase in nitrate assimilation and decrease in nitrate content is more than offset, from a crop production standpoint, by the increased nitrification which is occasioned...|$|R

There are several technologies that may be used to manage <b>manure</b> on-farm and off-farm. These include nutrient recycling through soil application and composting. Composting reduces the volume of <b>manure,</b> but increases the nitrogen losses from the <b>manure</b> This review, using a very simplistic approach, estimated that more than 6. 3 million tonnes of <b>manure</b> were generated in Alberta in 1996.

However, <b>manure</b> production tends to be concentrated on smaller land areas. Benefits of <b>manure</b> are constrained by both hauling costs and the costs of managing the <b>manure</b> itself. The on-farm economic costs or benefits are not well documented. Four general approaches have been used to analyze the on-farm economics of <b>manure</b> management. - Opportunity Cost: Value the nutrient content of <b>manure</b> using commercial fertilizer values and consider the <b>manure</b> or <b>manure</b> product as a commercial fertilizer substitute or supplement. - Crop Benefit: Value the direct crop benefit through a comparison of production in soil with <b>manure</b> applied versus a control with no <b>manure</b> applied. - Cost of Business: View the <b>manure</b> exclusively as a by-product of livestock production and evaluate methods for minimizing the cost of disposal. - Business Enterprise: View <b>manure</b> production as a value-added business and evaluate as a separate business enterprise using an appropriate approach. Any detailed economic analysis should incorporate the dynamic nature of <b>manure</b> production, and the management of <b>manure</b> through recycling through soil. Only one study was identified that was based on Alberta conditions and utilized a systems approach. At best, only one of the published studies explicitly incorporated the dynamic interactions of the livestock operation with a cropping enterprise, to analyze the on-farm economics of <b>manure.</b> This may be, in part, related to the complexities of modeling the key components in the system, while including the dynamic time-related interactions between soil, <b>manure,</b> and the environment.

Nitrogen mineralization differs for different <b>manure</b> types since the inorganic/organic fraction and quality of organic N varies among <b>manure</b> types. Mineralization of organic N is expected to be low for composted <b>manure</b> (18...|$|R

This paper described the conversion of cow <b>manure</b> and anaerobically digested cow <b>manure</b> into a cellulosic ethanol through pretreatment and efficient enzymatic hydrolysis. Furthermore, this study determined the most common composition of cow <b>manure</b> and anaerobically digested cow <b>manure,</b> whether cow <b>manure</b> and anaerobically digested cow <b>manure</b> have higher inducibility than delignined corn cob residue for cellulase expression in cellulolytic filamentous fungi, and whether the pretreated cow <b>manure</b> and anaerobically digested cow <b>manure</b> could be effectively disrupted by enzymatic hydrolysis into fermentable sugars and have high bioethanol conversion yield. Taken together, the research has implications for all dairy farms {{as it is the}} first attempt to investigate the potential utilization of cow <b>manure</b> for lignocellulosic-ethanol in combination with lignocellulolytic enzyme production, which could serve as a reference for improving agricultural waste economics.|$|R
