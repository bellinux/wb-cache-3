Over 2000 sera were examined; 1422 from the general population, 374 from unselected children admitted to hospital and 300 from women attending an antenatal clinic. Waning levels of <b>maternally-derived</b> <b>antibody</b> were found in infants under 1 year old. In children 1 - 5 years old, 5 - 15 % had anti-B 19 IgG and this rose to 5040 % in older children, young adults and women of child-bearing age.

40|$|Passive {{immunity}} (PI), {{acquired through}} colostrum intake, {{is essential for}} piglet protection against pathogens. <b>Maternally-derived</b> <b>antibodies</b> (MDAs) can decrease the transmission of pathogens between individuals by reducing shedding from infected animals and/or susceptibility of naı̈ve animals. Only {{a limited number of}} studies, however, have been carried out to quantify the level of protection conferred by PI in terms of transmission. In the present study, an original modeling framework was designed to estimate parameters governing the transmission of infectious agents in the presence and absence of PI. This epidemiological model accounts for the distribution of PI duration and two different forces of infection depending on the serological status of animals after colostrum intake. A Bayesian approach (Metropolis-Hastings algorithm) was used for parameter estimation. The impact of PI on hepatitis E virus transmission in piglets was investigated using longitudinal serological data from six pig farms. A strong impact of PI was highlighted, the efficiency of transmission being on average 13 times lower in piglets with <b>maternally-derived</b> <b>antibodies</b> than in fully susceptible animals (range: 5 – 21). Median infection-free survival ages, based on herd-specific estimates, ranged between 8. 7 and 13. 8 weeks in all but one herd. Indeed, this herd exhibited a different profile with a relatively low prevalence of infected pigs (50 % at slaughter age) despite the similar proportions of passively immune individuals after colostrum intake. These results suggest that the age at HEV infection is not strictly dependent upon the proportion of piglets with PI but is also linked to farm-specific husbandr...|$|R

40|$|One {{thousand}} Holstein-Friesian heifer calves {{were studied}} {{to evaluate the}} effects of colostrum-derived 24 to 48 h serum Ig concentrations on growth and survival. The rate of growth increased as 24 to 48 h serum Ig concentrations increased. Calves born to first-calf heifers had higher 24 to 48 h serum Ig concentrations and gained weight {{at a higher rate}} of gain than heifers born to 3 -year-old and older cows. The concentration of serum Ig at 24 to 48 h in the dairy heifer is a significant source of variation affecting average daily gain through the first 180 d of life. Seasonal factors were also significant in influencing rate of gain from birth to 6 months. Age of dam was a significant source of variation in calf weight gains, but only for the first 35 d of life. Approximately 28 % of the calves absorbed less than 12 mg/ml of <b>maternally-derived</b> <b>antibody.</b> Heifers in this category suffered a death loss of 6. 78 % compared to only a 2. 59 % loss for heifers absorbing greater than 40 mg/ml Ig.

Expression levels of a number of adaptor proteins, such as src-like adaptor protein (SLA), a negative regulator of T-cell receptor signalling and the transcription factor Special AT-rich Binding Protein 1 (SATB 1), were significantly down-regulated by CAV infection, suggesting potential roles for these genes as regulators of viral infection or cell defence.

The epidemiology of porcine group A rotavirus was studied in commercial herds of pigs in New Zealand. A commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit (Dakopatts, Copenhagen) was found to be highly sensitive (100 %) and specific (96. 8 %) for the detection of group A rotavirus in pig faeces when compared to electron microscopy (EM). A highly sensitive and specific ELISA test for the measurement of antibody against group A rotavirus in pigs was also developed. Of 521 faecal samples collected from Massey University Piggery in a cross-sectional survey, 47 (9 %) were positive for group A rotavirus by the ELISA test. Only sucking (19. 3 %) and weaner (14. 4 %) pigs were shedding rotavirus. Rotavirus was not detected in the faeces of fattener pigs (over two months old) or adult pigs including sows and boars. Three cohort studies revealed that all pigs became infected with group A rotavirus before they were 40 days of age and shed the virus for an average of eight days. Some of the piglets shed rotavirus a second time approximately 10 days after the first period of shedding. All piglets ceased to shed the virus by two months of age. Rotaviral shedding was associated with the occurrence of milk scours in sucking piglets. Diarrhoea in weaner pigs (post-weaning diarrhoea, PWD) was more closely associated with the presence of haemolytic E. coli than with rotavirus in faeces. Infection with group A rotavirus was transmitted from piglet to piglet and from litter to litter. In one cohort of 50 piglets from five litters, shedding of rotavirus was first detected in one litter, then in the second litter two days later, and finally in other litters of piglets. Over a period of 16 days, all piglets in the five litters were infected. Group A rotavirus was also detected in dust, faeces and effluent collected from the farrowing and weaner houses, and from a weaner house which had not been used for three months. Rotavirus was not detected in any of the sows (11) during the period of investigation. Neither was rotavirus detected in fattener pigs (from two months of age to the time of slaughter), nor in the environments where old pigs (fattener and sow houses) were housed. It was not therefore possible to confirm that adult pigs, especially sows, act as carriers for rotaviral infection of young piglets as has been suggested by other workers. All the piglets acquired maternal antirotaviral antibody from their dams and the levels of antibody in piglets' sera were comparable to those in the colostrum of their dams. The <b>maternally-derived</b> <b>antibody</b> was also detected in piglets' faeces. Antibody in sera and in faeces declined rapidly after birth. Rotaviral shedding commenced in each of the cohorts when the geometric mean ELISA antibody titre fell below 1 / 1600 (equivalent to serum neutralizing antibody titre of 1 / 8 to 1 / 16). However, this correlation between antibody titres and protection was not observed in individual litters. In each of the cohorts studied, rotaviral shedding was usually detected initially in one or two piglets of a litter. The infection then spread to other piglets within the same litter and, finally, to piglets of other litters in the same group. Onset of rotaviral infection in particular litters was related to their location in the farrowing unit rather than to the levels of antibody. The shedding pattern of group A rotavirus was studied further in another five New Zealand piggeries and was found to be similar to that observed at the Massey University Piggery. Faecal samples from these piggeries were analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and no common electrophoretype of group A rotavirus was found in these piggeries. More than one electrophoretype of group A rotavirus was detected in three of these piggeries. Faecal samples collected from Massey University Piggery were also analyzed by PAGE and it was found that rotaviruses detected during {{the first two years of}} the present investigation had identical electrophoretypes, but one isolate detected in the third year had a distinctively different pattern. Non-group A rotaviruses were also detected for the first time in New Zealand. Nine samples had an electrophoretic pattern similar to that of group C rotavirus and one was similar to that of group B rotavirus. One of the samples containing group C rotavirus was from two litters of piglets with diarrhoea at two to four days of age. In one of these piggeries, five electrophoretypes of rotaviruses representing three groups were detected. These observations indicate that rotaviral infections are important causes of milk scours in piglets, and are probably significant in exacerbating PWD. The epidemiology of rotaviral infections is complicated by a number of factors. These include the continuous transmission of virus from pig to pig and from litter to litter, the survival of the virus in the piggery environment, the incomplete protection afforded by <b>maternally-derived</b> <b>antibody,</b> and the simultaneous circulation of different strains and different groups of rotavirus in one piggery...|$|E
40|$|Background: Schmallenberg virus (SBV) {{has swept}} through the major part of Europe in the period 2011 – 2013. A vaccine against SBV has been {{developed}} and may be a possible preventive instrument against infection. Presently, there is no data available to refute the assumption that natural SBV infection results in long-term immunity. In that respect, it is of interest to know how long (protecting) virus-neutralizing antibodies are present in naturally infected animals. New-born calves acquire passive immunity from their dams by ingestion and absorption of antibodies present in colostrum, which can block the production of serum antibodies when vaccine is administered to calves with maternally derived antibodies. In that respect, {{it is useful to}} know how long it takes for maternal antibodies against SBV to disappear in young animals born from infected dams. Results: Longitudinal whole-herd serological monitoring using virus neutralization test (VNT) indicated that 80 % of adult dairy cows still had measurable antibodies against SBV at least 24 months after the estimated introduction of the virus into the herd. Median 2 Log VNT titer of the adult dairy cows (= 1 year) dropped from 8. 6 to 5. 6 in a period of 17 months. Median 2 Log VNT maternal antibodies titers of calves sampled within 30 days after birth was 8. Calves lost their <b>maternally-derived</b> <b>antibodies</b> after 5 – 6 months. There was a definite positive relationship between the VNT titer of the dam and the VNT titer of the corresponding calf (age = 30 days) of dam-calf combinations sampled on the same day: the higher the VNT titer of the dam, the higher the VNT titer (maternal antibodies) of the calf. Conclusions: Our field data support the assumption that natural SBV infection in adult cows results in persistence of specific antibodies for at least two years. Based on the observed decay of <b>maternally-derived</b> <b>antibodies</b> in calves, it is presumed safe to vaccinate calves against SBV at an age of approximately 6 month...|$|R

Both conventional (proteins, conjugate vaccines) and new (live viral vectors, DNA plasmids) antigen presentation systems were found to be similarly susceptible to the inhibitory influence of maternal antibodies. Factors emerging as crucial determinants of maternal antibody-mediated effects on responses to both live and non-live vaccines include (i) the level of maternal antibodies present at immunization, (ii) the use of distinct vaccines in mothers and pups and (iii) their distinct influence on B cell and T cell vaccine responses...|$|R

Vaccination of dams at six weeks and again at two weeks prepartum increased pathogen-specific antibody levels in their colostrum and respective calf's serum. Calves initially vaccinated at three days produced both a primary and secondary pathogen-specific antibody response, whereas calves initially vaccinated at 12 and 21 days produced only secondary responses. <b>Maternally-derived</b> <b>antibodies</b> were found to suppress neonatal antibody production following primary immunization. They were also found to influence secondary humoral immune responses, although in a diminished capacity. Pathogen-specific IgG and IgM concentrations in dams' sera and colostra were found related to subsequent pathogen-specific IgG and IgM neonatal serum concentrations. Only pathogen-specific IgA in dams' colostra was correlated to neonatal levels, possibly owing to a different origin and role of this immunoglobulin class. All class-specific colostral immunoglobulin levels were related to subsequent neonatal concentrations. Based on results from this experiment, it is recommended that calves be vaccinated at three days postpartum with a booster administered at 63 days...|$|R

One week after birth, the offspring were immunized twice via the IP or IN route with the same vaccine and then challenged with a lethal dose of a highly homologous virus strain. The results showed that, no matter which immunization route (IP or IN) was used for mothers, the presence of MDAs severely interfered with the active immune response of the offspring when the offspring were immunized via the IP route. Only via the IN immunization route did the offspring overcome the MDA interference.

Methods Rectovaginal swabs and cord blood (birth) and infant nasopharyngeal/rectal swabs (birth, day 6 and day 60 – 89) were obtained from 750 mother/infant pairs. Antibody-mediated C 3 b/iC 3 b deposition with cord and infant sera was measured by flow cytometry. Results We established that as <b>maternally-derived</b> anti-GBS functional <b>antibody</b> increases, infant colonization decreases at birth and up to three months of life, the critical time window for the development of GBS disease. Further, we observed a serotype (ST) -dependent threshold above which no infant was colonized at birth. Functional antibody above the upper 95 th confidence interval for the geometric mean concentration was associated with absence of infant GBS colonization at birth for STII (p < 0. 001), STIII (p = 0. 01) and STV (p < 0. 001). Increased functional antibody was also associated with clearance of GBS between birth and day 60 – 89. Conclusions Higher concentrations of maternally-derived antibody-mediated complement deposition are associated with a decreased risk of GBS colonization in infants up to day 60 – 89 of life. Our findings are of relevance to establish thresholds for protection following vaccination of pregnant women with future GBS vaccines...|$|R

In each group (MDA+/MDA−), 2 seeders were placed with 4 piglets in direct contact and 5 in indirect contact (3 replicates per group). Serological kinetics (ELISA) and individual viral shedding (RT-PCR) were monitored for 28  days after infection. MDA waning was estimated using a nonlinear mixed-effects model and survival analysis. Differential transmission rates were estimated depending on the piglets’ initial serological status and contact structure (direct contact with pen-mates or indirect airborne contact). The time to MDA waning was 71. 3 [52. 8 – 92. 1] days on average. The airborne transmission rate was 1. 41 [0. 64 – 2. 63] per day. The compared shedding pattern between groups showed that MDA+ piglets had mainly a reduced susceptibility to infection compared to MDA− piglets.

Each study used 15 six week old dogs; five dogs were sero-negative; the remaining 10 had maternally derived antibodies to CDV, CAV and CPV. The five MDA-negative dogs and five of the MDA-positive dogs were vaccinated twice with the vaccine while the remaining 5 MDA-positive dogs were administered sterile water. According to EU guidelines for MDA studies dogs were challenged when <b>maternally-derived</b> <b>antibodies</b> in non-vaccinated dogs had greatly diminished or disappeared (3 – 5 weeks after second vaccination); clinical observations and rectal temperatures were recorded, and sera and faecal samples (CPV study only) were collected throughout the study. After challenge, non-vaccinated dogs showed clinical signs of infection while none of the vaccinated dogs did. MDA-negative vaccinated dogs sero-converted with increases in titre observed after each vaccination, and further increases observed after challenge. MDA-positive vaccinated dogs showed declining antibody titres following the first vaccination, but increases after the second vaccination and further increases after challenge. In all vaccinated dogs the immune responses generated were protective, irrespective of the presence of maternal antibodies, as demonstrated by heterologous viral challenge.

40|$|International audienceInactivated and fowlpox virus (FP) -vectored {{vaccines}} {{have been}} used to control H 5 avian influenza (AI) in poultry. In H 5 AI endemic countries, breeder flocks are vaccinated and therefore, <b>maternally-derived</b> <b>antibodies</b> (MDA) are transferred to their progeny. Results of three immunogenicity and one efficacy studies performed in birds with or without MDA indicated that the immunogenicity of an inactivated vaccine based on a H 5 N 9 AI isolate (inH 5 N 9) was severely impaired in chicks hatched from inH 5 N 9 -vaccinated breeders. This MDA interference was lower when breeders received only one administration of the same vaccine and could be overcome by priming the chicks at day-of-age with a live recombinant FP-vectored vaccine with H 5 avian influenza gene insert (FP-AI). The interference of anti-FP MDA was of lower intensity than the interference of anti-AI MDA. The highest interference observed on the prime-boost immunogenicity was in chicks hatched from breeders vaccinated with the same prime-boost scheme. The level of protection against an antigenic variant H 5 N 1 highly pathogenic AI isolate from Indonesia against which the FP-AI or inH 5 N 9 alone was poorly protective could be circumvented by the prime-boost regimen in birds with either FP or AI MDA. Thus, the immunogenicity of vaccines in young chicks with MDA depends on the vaccination scheme and the type of vaccine used in their parent flocks. The heterologous prime-boost in birds with MDA may at least partially overcome MDA interference on inactivated vaccine...|$|R

Serum samples were collected from mother-infant pairs during a longitudinal pneumococcal colonization study in Burmese refugees. Maternal and cord sera were collected at birth and infants were bled monthly (1 – 24 months of age). Nasopharyngeal swabs were taken monthly to detect colonization. Serum IgG titres to 27 pneumococcal protein antigens were measured in 2624 sera and IgG to dominant serotypes (6 B, 14, 19 F, 19 A and 23 F) were quantified in 864 infant sera. Antibodies to all protein antigens were detectable in maternal sera. Titres to four proteins (LytB, PcpA, PhtD and PhtE) were significantly higher in mothers colonized by pneumococci at delivery. <b>Maternally-derived</b> <b>antibodies</b> to PiuA and Spr 0096 were associated with delayed pneumococcal acquisition in infants in univariate, but not multivariate models. Controlling for infant age and previous homologous serotype exposure, nasopharyngeal acquisition of serotypes 19 A, 23 F, 14 or 19 F was associated significantly with a ≥ 2 -fold antibody response to the homologous capsule (OR 12. 84, 7. 52, 6. 52, 5. 33; p < 0. 05).

40|$|Assessment of {{antibody}} {{responses to}} pneumococcal colonisation {{in early childhood}} may aid our understanding of protection and inform vaccine antigen selection. Serum samples were collected from mother-infant pairs during a longitudinal pneumococcal colonisation study in Burmese refugees. Maternal and cord sera were collected at birth and infants were bled monthly (1 - 24 months of age). Nasopharyngeal swabs were taken monthly to detect colonisation. Serum IgG titres to 27 pneumococcal protein antigens were measured in 2, 624 sera and IgG to dominant serotypes (6 B, 14, 19 F, 19 A, 23 F) were quantified in 864 infant sera. Antibodies to all protein antigens were detectable in maternal sera. Titres to four proteins (LytB,PcpA,PhtD,PhtE) were significantly higher in mothers colonised by pneumococci at delivery. <b>Maternally-derived</b> <b>antibodies</b> to PiuA and Spr 0096 were associated with delayed pneumococcal acquisition in infants in univariate, but not multivariate models. Controlling for infant age and previous homologous serotype exposure, nasopharyngeal acquisition of serotypes 19 A, 23 F, 14, or 19 F were associated significantly with a ≥ 2 -fold antibody response to the homologous capsule (OR 12. 84, 7. 52, 6. 52, 5. 33; p< 0. 05). Acquisition of pneumococcal serotypes in the nasopharynx of infants was not significantly associated with a ≥ 2 -fold rise in antibodies {{to any of the}} protein antigens studied. In conclusion, nasopharyngeal colonisation in young children resulted in demonstrable serum IgG responses to pneumococcal capsules and surface/virulence proteins. However, the relationship between serum IgG and the prevention of, or response to, pneumococcal nasopharyngeal colonisation remains complex. Mechanisms other than serum IgG are likely to have a role but are currently poorly understood. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved...|$|R

Herein, we present safety and efficacy results from a virulent BRSV challenge of calves with MDA, which were immunized with one of three vaccine candidates that allow serological differentiation of infected from vaccinated animals (DIVA) : an SH gene-deleted recombinant BRSV (Delta SHrBRSV), and two subunit (SU) formulations based on HRSV-P, -M 2 - 1, and -N recombinant proteins displaying BRSV-F and -G epitopes, adjuvanted by either oil emulsion (Montanide ISA 71 (VG), SUMont) or immunostimulating complex matrices (AbISCO- 300, SUAbis). Whereas all control animals developed severe respiratory disease and shed high levels of virus following BRSV challenge, Delta SHrBRSV-immunized calves demonstrated almost complete clinical and virological protection five weeks after a single intranasal vaccination. Although mucosal vaccination with DSHrBRSV failed to induce a detectable immunological response, there was a rapid and strong anamnestic mucosal BRSV-specific IgA, virus neutralizing antibody and local T cell response following challenge with virulent BRSV. Calves immunized twice intramuscularly, three weeks apart with SUMont were also well protected two weeks after boost. The protection was not as pronounced as that in Delta SHrBRSV-immunized animals, but superior to those immunized twice subcutaneously three weeks apart with SUAbis. Antibody responses induced by the subunit vaccines were non-neutralizing and not directed against BRSV F or G proteins. When formulated as SUMont but not as SUAbis, the HRSV N, P and M 2 - 1 proteins induced strong systemic cross-protective cell-mediated immune responses detectable already after priming. Delta SHrBRSV and SUMont are two promising DIVA-compatible vaccines, apparently inducing protection by different immune responses that were influenced by vaccine-composition, immunization route and regimen...|$|R

40|$|REASONS FOR PERFORMING STUDY : African horse {{sickness}} is {{an insect}} transmitted, non-contagious disease of equids caused by African horse sickness virus (AHSV). Mortality can exceed 90 % in fully susceptible horse populations. A live-attenuated (modified-live) cell culture-adapted (MLV) polyvalent AHSV vaccine {{is widely used}} to control AHS in endemic areas in southern Africa. Field studies detailing antibody responses of vaccinated horses are lacking. OBJECTIVES : To determine antibody titres to the 9 known serotypes of AHSV in a cohort of brood mares that were regularly vaccinated with the MLV AHSV vaccine, and to measure the passive transfer and rate of decay of maternal antibody to the individual virus serotypes in foals. METHODS : Serum was collected from 15 mares before foaling and from their foals after foaling and monthly thereafter for 6 months. Antibody titres {{to each of the}} 9 AHSV serotypes were determined by serum-virus neutralisation assay. RESULTS : There was marked variation in the antibody response of the mares to individual AHSV serotypes even after repeated vaccination, with consistently higher titre responses to some virus serotypes. Similarly, duration of <b>maternally-derived</b> <b>antibodies</b> in foals differed among serotypes. CONCLUSIONS : Data from this study confirm variation of the neutralising antibody response of individual mares to repeated vaccination with polyvalent AHSV vaccine. Virus strains of individual AHSV serotypes included in the vaccine may vary in their inherent immunogenicity. Passivelyacquired maternal antibodies to AHSV vary markedly among foals born to vaccinated mares, with further variation in the duration of passive immunity to individual AHSV serotypes. POTENTIAL RELEVANCE : These data are relevant to the effective utilization of live-attenuated AHSV vaccines in endemic regions, and potentially to the use of vaccines in response to future incursions of AHSV into previously free regions. Further studies involving a larger population will be required to determine the optimal time for vaccinating foals. Racing South Africa and the Equine Research Centre, University of Pretoria.

40|$|The epidemiology, {{characterisation}} and vaccination {{responses to}} equine influenza (EI) in Ireland were studied between 2007 and 2010. Epidemiological evidence indicated a seasonal pattern to outbreaks with 50 % and 39 % occurring {{over the summer}} and winter months, respectively. Outbreaks were recorded in 13 of the 32 counties {{and the majority of}} cases occurred following animal movement on or off premises. Other key influences included housing type and fomites/personnel. Epidemiological evidence revealed poor vaccine compliance on premises where horses were infected with EI, while on premises where vaccination was widely practiced, the duration of vaccination history and time since last vaccination influenced disease expression. In a population of 1149 horses/ponies with mixed levels of antibody, 34 %, 11 %, 32 % and 23 % were considered to have index case potential, partial protection, clinical protection and virological protection respectively. Younger animals were identified as most susceptible to EI and the majority of teaser stallions had little serological evidence of vaccination. Phylogenetic analysis of the HA gene of 18 EI viruses identified suggested that predominant strains circulating among Irish horses were from clade 1 and clade 2 of the Florida sublineage. Equine influenza vaccine efficacy was examined in two different equine populations, mature National Hunt (NH) horses and immunologically naïve Thoroughbred (TB) weanlings. There {{was no significant difference between}} the levels of antibody response induced following booster vaccination with any of the six vaccines in the NH population. While the mean SRH levels post booster vaccination suggested that this population was clinically protected, analysis of the individual responses suggested that there was potential for vaccine breakdown among some horses. Antibody responses of weanlings vaccinated with the whole virus vaccine Duvaxyn IET Plus were significantly higher than those of the horses vaccinated with any of the other products. A high incidence of poor responders was observed post first vaccination (V 1). Vaccination of weanlings which had <b>maternally-derived</b> <b>antibodies</b> effectively primed the animals but in some cases their response to the primary course was lower than that of seronegative weanlings. Overall, the results indicated that EI is endemic in Ireland. Vaccine compliance is good within certain sectors of the industry however, there are vulnerable subgroups where vaccination is poorly executed thus creating potential pockets of disease and facilitating virus spread.

40|$|AIMS: To {{identify}} the respiratory viruses that are present among foals in New Zealand {{and to establish}} {{the age at which}} foals first become infected with these viruses. METHODS: Foals were recruited to the study in October/ November 1995 at the age of 1 month (Group A) or in March/ April 1996 at the age of 4 - 6 months (Groups B and C). Nasal swabs and blood samples were collected at monthly intervals. Nasal swabs and peripheral blood leucocytes (PBL) harvested from heparinised blood samples were used for virus isolation; serum harvested from whole-blood samples was used for serological testing for the presence of antibodies against equine herpesvirus (EHV) - 1 or - 4, equine rhinitis-A virus (ERAV), equine rhinitis-B virus (ERBV), equine adenovirus 1 (EAdV- 1), equine arteritis virus (EAV), reovirus 3 and parainfluenza virus type 3 (PIV 3). Twelve foals were sampled until December 1996; the remaining 19 foals were lost from the study at various times prior to this date. RESULTS: The only viruses isolated were EHV 2 and EHV 5. EHV 2 was isolated from 155 / 157 PBL samples collected during the period of study and from 40 / 172 nasal swabs collected from 18 foals. All isolations from nasal swabs, except one, were made over a period of 2 - 4 months from January to April (Group A), March to April (Group B) or May, to July (Group C). EHV 5 was isolated from either PBL, nasal swabs, or both, from 15 foals on 32 occasions. All foals were positive for antibodies to EHV 1 or EHV 4, as tested by serum neutralisation (SN), on at least one sampling occasion and all but one were positive for EHV 1 antibodies measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) on at least one sampling occasion. Recent EHV 1 infection was evident at least once during the period of study in 18 / 23 (78 %) foals for which at least two samples were collected. SN antibodies to ERBV were evident in 19 / 23 (83 %) foals on at least one sampling occasion and 15 / 23 foals showed evidence of seroconversion to ERBV Antibodies to ERAV were only detected in serum samples collected from foals in Group A and probably represented <b>maternally-derived</b> <b>antibodies.</b> Haemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibody titres {{greater than or equal to}} 1 : 10 to EAdV- 1 were evident in 21 / 23 (91 %) foals on at least one sampling occasion and 16 / 23 foals showed serological evidence of recent EAdV- 1 infection. None of the 67 serum samples tested were positive for antibodies to EAV, reovirus 3 or PIV 3. There was no clear association between infection with any of the viruses isolated or tested for and the presence of overt clinical signs of respiratory disease. CONCLUSIONS: There was serological and/or virological evidence that EHV- 1, EHV- 2, EHV- 5, EAdV- 1 and ERBV infections were present among foals in New Zealand. EHV- 2 infection was first detected in foals as young as 3 months of age.

40|$|There {{have been}} {{numerous}} reports of vaccinated horses that contract fatal African horse sickness due to African horse sickness virus (AHSV) serotypes that {{are included in the}} current commercial vaccine used in southern Africa, which emphasizes the importance of thorough characterization of the equine immune response to AHSV. In particular, there are concerns about possible interference between vaccine strains in the polyvalent vaccine which led us to hypothesise that the administration of individual AHSV serotypes could induce a better immunity to individual serotypes than that achieved with the current polyvalent vaccines. There is also little published information describing the half-life of maternally derived neutralising antibody in foals to the nine AHSV serotypes. This is important for revising and developing vaccination protocols for foals of vaccinated mares. Given the lethality of both natural and experimental AHSV infections in horses, several aspects of immunity induced by different types of AHSV vaccines were evaluated. The neutralising antibody response of horses (foals) immunized with a commercial modified live virus (MLV) AHSV vaccine was evaluated and compared to the immune response elicited to monovalent MLV AHSV serotypes. Foals were immunized with either the polyvalent AHSV vaccine, or one of four monovalent vaccines containing individual AHSV serotypes 1, 4, 7 and 8. There were marked differences in the immunogenicity of individual virus serotypes contained in the vaccine. Foals more consistently seroconverted to AHSV 1 and responses to other serotypes were highly variable, and often weak or not detected. The serotype-specific responses of foals given the monovalent MLV vaccines were similar to those of foals given the polyvalent preparation suggesting that there is no apparent enhanced immune response through the administration of a monovalent vaccine as opposed to the polyvalent vaccine. Furthermore, the immunogenicity of individual AHSV serotypes contained in the commercial MLV vaccine varies remarkably. Neutralising antibody titres to the 9 known serotypes of AHSV were determined in a cohort of brood mares that were regularly vaccinated with the MLV AHSV vaccine, and the passive transfer and rate of decay of maternal antibody to the individual virus serotypes in their foals were measured. Similar to the data obtained from immunized foals, there was marked variation in the neutralising antibody response of the mares to individual AHSV serotypes even after repeated vaccination. This was mirrored in the duration of <b>maternally-derived</b> <b>antibodies</b> in their respective foals. In an effort to further characterize cellular immune (CMI) responses to AHSV, the immunity in horses induced by an experimental canarypox virus vectored recombinant (ALVAC®-AHSV 4) vaccine was characterised. The detection of VP 2 /VP 5 specific IFN-γ responses was assessed by enzyme-linked immune spot (ELISpot) assay and clearly demonstrated that all ALVAC®-AHSV 4 vaccinated horses developed significant IFN-γ production compared to unvaccinated horses. Flow cytometry demonstrated that this vaccine induced mainly CD 8 + T-cells, able to recognize multiple T-cell epitopes throughout all of VP 2 and only the N-terminus portion of VP 5. In summary, the antibody and cellular response of horses to different AHSV vaccines was evaluated and compared. The results are relevant to the design of more efficacious AHSV vaccines and to identification of protective immunity in horses to this virus.

40|$|Porcine Circovirus 2 (PCV 2) {{associated}} diseases (PCVAD) cause {{economic loss}} to the global swine industry. Control measures for PCVAD largely depend {{on the use of}} PCV 2 vaccines. The available commercial PCV 2 vaccines contain either inactivated whole virus particles or recombinant PCV 2 capsid protein. These preparations most likely contain varying amounts of immune-irrelevant proteins that can cause adverse injection site reactions, with compromised efficacy due to alteration of protective immune epitopes arising during the viral inactivation process. Other constraints include high production cost attributed to propagation of slow growing virus and expression and extraction of recombinant proteins, a requirement for adjuvants, and the induction of a Th 2 -biased immune response. Hence, development of new PCV 2 vaccines is necessary. There are two recommended PCV 2 vaccination strategies. They are i. vaccinating sows, which relies on the passive transfer of maternal immunity to offspring, and ii. immunizing young piglets to induce an active immune response. The piglet vaccination has been shown to confer better protection from mortality. Maternal antibody interference to the induction of an active immune response is an obstacle when piglets are vaccinated at an early age. Can we sidestep this maternal antibody interference? To address this issue, I investigated whether a prototypical PCV 2 vaccine, parenterally administered, could override <b>maternally-derived</b> PCV 2 <b>antibodies</b> in seropositive piglets. The results of this study were not conclusive. However, they laid the foundation for future studies based upon using varying levels of vaccine antigen with different adjuvants, and administered to piglets with defined maternally derived PCV 2 antibodies. Subsequently, I examined if a new PCV 2 vaccine candidate comprised of bacteriophage lambda particles displaying part of the PCV 2 capsid protein could induce anti-PCV 2 immunity. Initial experiments showed that pigs do not have pre-existing anti-lambda antibodies and thus will not neutralize display particles used as a vaccine at primary vaccination. I produced and characterized lambda phage particles displaying four immunodominant regions of porcine circovirus 2 (PCV 2) capsid protein fused to the lambda capsid protein D i. e., D-CAP, phage display particles. Expression of D-CAP in Escherichia coli (E. coli) and its presence in the vaccine preparation was shown by ELISA and Western blots using anti-PCV 2 polyclonal antiserum from a gnotobiotic pig. The vaccine, lambda particles displaying PCV 2 capsid protein immunogenic epitopes fused to lambda D protein (LDP-D-CAP), administered without an adjuvant induced both humoral and cellular immunity to PCV 2 in conventional pigs, as shown by ELISA, Western blots, virus neutralization assay and delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH) reactions. This work produced the first potential phage vaccine to PCV 2. In order to further investigate the feasibility of using the lambda display technology. I produced and characterized two additional lambda display particle preparations, LDP-D-FLAG and LDP-D-GFP, displaying a FLAG tag and the green fluorescent proteins, respectively...|$|R
40|$|Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV 2) is an {{emerging}} virus {{that may result}} in devastating disease that affects swine herds worldwide. Only a decade has passed since researchers began to study {{the characteristics of the}} virus and the resulting diseases, and limited information was available regarding the long term presence or persistence of the virus in healthy swine herds. Our research contributes to the knowledge of the persistence of the virus in serum and semen, and the PCV 2 antibody profile in healthy pigs. In addition, we developed a novel quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay and quantified the PCV 2 -shedding in healthy and PCVD (porcine circovirus disease) -affected pigs. Lastly, we determined the efficacy of a novel vaccine in a subset of pigs from a PCVD-affected herd. Porcine serum was assayed by two PCR protocols (nested polymerase chain reaction (nPCR) and non-nested PCR) and a competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (cELISA) to determine when PCV 2 viremia and a rise in the serum level of PCV 2 -specific antibody (Ab) occurred in pigs raised in a large Canadian farrow-to-finish barn. Eight serial blood samples were collected from each of 40 pigs from 5 to 156 (± 1. 5) days of age; six pigs were removed from the study for various reasons at various times. Viremia was not detected in the samples collected before 72 days of age but was detected in those collected on or after 72 days: of 33 pigs, seven (21 %) had only one serum sample positive for PCV 2 deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) by nPCR after day 72; 11 (33 %) were intermittently positive by nPCR, non-nested PCR, or both between 72 and 156 days; and the remaining 15 (45 %) were repeatedly positive (in two to four samples). The level of serum Ab against PCV 2 declined after weaning and increased between 72 and 107 days of age, only after PCV 2 was detected in serum. Our results show that PCV 2 viremia persists in the presence of elevated levels of PCV 2 -specific Ab. In a separate study, we determined the long term presence or persistence of PCV 2 -shedding in semen from healthy boars and the effects of PCV 2 on sperm quality. A nPCR protocol was applied to porcine semen to demonstrate the PCV 2 -shedding patterns and duration in naturally-infected boars. Sperm morphology analysis was performed on a subset of samples to determine if the presence of PCV 2 DNA in semen was associated with reduced semen quality. Semen was collected serially from 43 boars representing six breeds, aged 33. 9 to 149. 3 weeks. Of the 903 semen samples collected, 30 samples (3. 3 %) were positive for PCV 2 DNA by nPCR from 13 boars. Boars shedding PCV 2 DNA in semen ranged between 35. 9 and 71. 0 weeks of age, and shedding occurred over a period of up to 27. 3 weeks. A semen nPCR test was 2. 6 {{times more likely to be}} positive when collected from pigs that were ≤ 52 weeks of age and 3. 0 times more likely to be positive when collected from pigs that were ≤ 26 weeks from the time of entry into the stud main unit (Generalized Estimating Equations: P= 0. 02; 95 % confidence interval (CI) of the Odd’s ratio (OR) 1. 2 to 5. 5 and P= 0. 01; 95 % CI of the OR 1. 3 to 6. 9, respectively). PCV 2 DNA was detected in semen from Duroc and Landrace boars only; however, the semen of the Hamline, Large White maternal, Large White paternal, and Meishan-synthetic boars were negative for PCV 2 DNA. These results demonstrate a sporadic and long-term shedding pattern of PCV 2 DNA in semen from naturally-infected boars. PCV 2 DNA in semen did not have detrimental effects on sperm morphology; however, boar age and possibly breed may contribute to the persistence of PCV 2 -shedding in semen. To further our studies of PCV 2 -shedding from pigs, a PCV 2 quantitative molecular assay was developed using SYBR green technology. This assay allowed for the simultaneous quantification of all the genotypes of PCV 2. The emergence of multiple genotypes of PCV 2, as demonstrated by phylogenetic analysis of whole genome or capsid sequences, makes it necessary to have quantitative diagnostic assays that perform equally well on all strains. The objectives of this study were to develop and validate a novel real-time PCR assay targeting the highly conserved replication-associated gene (Rep) open reading frame 1 (ORF 1) and investigate the effects of diagnostic specimen choice on its performance. The assay was tested in naturally-infected conventional pigs, experimentally-infected gnotobiotic pigs, and plasmid-spiked negative serum, lung tissue, and feces and found to have a linear detection range of 2. 2 × 103 to 2. 2 × 1010 copies of PCV 2 per mL. The assay successfully detected and quantified PCV 2 DNA in serum, buffy coat, feces, and multiple lymphoid (bronchial, mesenteric, and superficial inguinal lymph nodes, thymus, tonsil, ileal Peyer’s patches, and spleen) and non-lymphoid (myocardium, lung, kidney, liver, and gluteal muscle) tissues from naturally-infected pigs. Across all tissues and sera of naturally-infected pigs, the mean PCV 2 concentration was 3. 0 logs higher in pigs that were demonstrating weight loss, as a primary clinical sign of PMWS (postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome) when compared with PMWS-nonaffected pigs. PCV 2 concentration measured by tissue culture and immunohistochemical staining in homogenized liver samples of experimentally-infected gnotobiotic pigs were compared to the concentrations estimated by quantitative PCR. Similar trends were noted with increasing PCV 2 concentration detected in subclinically-infected to severely PMWS-affected pigs across all assays. Our diagnostic assay was developed with a conserved target sequence, and performed efficiently in the quantification of PCV 2 in a variety of tissues from naturally- and experimentally-infected pigs. With a quantitative assay, we then determined the amount of PCV 2 -shedding in feces between healthy and PCVD-affected herds. This study examined if pigs (n= 100) in a PCVD-affected herd shed more PCV 2 in their feces than pigs in a PCVD-nonaffected herd (n= 101), and if differences in shedding among production stages within and between the herds existed. The PCV 2 -shedding was quantified by real-time PCR. The highest median PCV 2 -shedding was found in the nursery stage of the PCVD-affected herd and in the grower stage of the PCVD-nonaffected herd. The PCV 2 -shedding was significantly higher in earlier stages (newly weaned, nursery, and pregrower) in the PCVD-affected herd (Wilcoxon Rank Sum; P< 0. 001) compared with the PCVD-nonaffected herd. PCV 2 DNA was not detected in a significant proportion of lactating sows (parity ≥ 3) in the PCVD-nonaffected herd (Fisher’s Exact Test; P= 0. 001) compared with the PCVD-affected herd. The results of this study suggest there may be an association between the presence of PCV 2 in the feces of lactating sows and increased PCV 2 -shedding in younger pigs. The quantitative PCR assay was used in a field study to determine the efficacy of a novel transdermal immune stimulating complex (ISCOM) technology-based PCV 2 virus-like particle (VLP) vaccine candidate administered at one and three weeks of age. Fifty-four pigs (vaccinates (VX) (n= 27); non-vaccinated controls (CTRL) (n= 27)) with variable levels of <b>maternally-derived</b> <b>antibodies</b> (MDAb) (high (hiMDAb) versus low (loMDAb)) in a PCVD-affected farm were assessed for PCV 2 -specific Ab levels by cELISA, PCV 2 DNA concentration in serum and feces by quantitative PCR, mortality, and average daily gain (ADG) from 1 to 18 weeks of age. A significant reduction in mortality (P= 0. 05) was observed in the VX. PCV 2 DNA concentration in serum was lower in the VX at 9 and 11 weeks of age (P= 0. 003 and 0. 01, respectively). The VX (both hiMDAb and loMDAb groups) at nine weeks of age had a higher Ab response to natural PCV 2 exposure, while the CTRL (both hiMDAb and loMDAb groups) had a significantly reduced Ab response in comparison. This suggests a priming of the immune response against PCV 2 infection by use of the vaccine. During this period from 9 to 11 weeks of age, the loMDAb CTRL were susceptible to PCVD. PCV 2 -specific Ab in serum was significantly higher in the VX at the onset of PCVD-related mortality (P= 0. 001); however, no significant difference was observed in the PCV 2 DNA concentration shed in feces, or in ADG between VX and CTRL. The benefit of the novel ISCOM vaccine was most evident in the loMDAb VX, as these pigs were protected from a PCVD-related death that was otherwise experienced in the loMDAb CTRL. However, producers and veterinarians using a vaccine against PCV 2 would expect a significant improvement in ADG and reduced viral shedding in feces. Although the vaccine prevented a PCVD-related death in the highest risk population, the loMDAb group, modifications regarding the protein or ISCOM concentration, or PCV 2 protein construction should be considered to potentially improve the vaccine’s efficacy. This study is the first report of the use of an ISCOM matrix (Matrix Q) mixed with PCV 2 VLP protein administered transdermally for the prevention of PCVD in swine...|$|R
