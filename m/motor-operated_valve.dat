40|$|INEL {{engineers}} evaluated {{effects of}} erosion-induced valve wall thinning on <b>motor-operated</b> <b>valve</b> operability. The authors reviewed reports that identified {{the extent and}} location of erosion damage in nuclear plant valves and chose a globe valve with severe erosion damage to assess the potential for loss of operability. They developed a finite element model of the selected valve and performed structural analyses with valve closing forces, seismic effects, and increased erosion areas to analyze effects of erosion on structural integrity. Results indicate that while some local stresses at the points of maximum erosion exceeded yield, the general stresses were well below yield. Therefore, displacements will be small and bending will not occur. It is concluded that erosion-related wall thinning {{is not likely to}} create an operability problem for motor-operated valves...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} how features {{from the field}} of Intelligent Tutoring Systems are applied to the <b>Motor-Operated</b> <b>Valve</b> (MOV) Advanced Technology Training System (ATTS). The MOV ATTS is a training system developed at Galaxy Scientific Corporation for the Central Research Institute of Electric Power Industry in Japan and the Electric Power Research Institute in the United States. The MOV ATTS combines traditional computer-based training approaches with system simulation, integrated expert systems, and student and expert modeling. The primary goal of the MOV ATTS is to reduce human errors that occur during MOV overhaul and repair. The MOV ATTS addresses this goal by providing basic operational information of the MOV, simulating MOV operation, providing troubleshooting practice of MOV failures, and tailoring this training to the needs of each individual student. The MOV ATTS integrates multiple expert models (functional and procedural) to provide advice and feedback to students. The integration also provides expert model validation support to developers. Student modeling is supported by two separate student models: one model registers and updates the student's current knowledge of basic MOV information, while another model logs the student's actions and errors during troubleshooting exercises. These two models are used to provide tailored feedback to the student during the MOV course...|$|E

The testing included parametric studies under reduced voltage and elevated temperature conditions. As part of {{the analysis of the}} results, we compared efficiency values determined from testing to the values published by the operator manufacturer and typically used by the industry in calculations for estimating motor-operator capabilities.

We present an unsupervised and fully automated method for the extraction of the motor current signature and an analysis to diagnose possible failures in MOV's, The reference Line frequency is obtained by sampling the line voltage, and is used to demodulate the current waveform, Having obtained the current signature, a set of features are extracted from the signature. A discriminant analysis is performed on these primitives to detect and classify various types of failures, The proposed method is nonintrusive, computationally efficient and yields good results, It can be easily installed as a part of an expert system for preventive maintenance of MOV's in nuclear power plants...|$|R
40|$|For {{the past}} several years, {{researchers}} at the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory, under the sponsorship of the U. S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, have been investigating the ability of <b>motor-operated</b> <b>valves</b> (MOVs) used in Nuclear Power Plants to close or open when subjected to design basis flow and pressure loads. Part of this research addresses the response of a dcpowered <b>motor-operated</b> gate <b>valve</b> to assess whether it will achieve flow isolation and to evaluate whether it will slow down excessively under design-basis conditions and thus fail to achieve the required stroke time. As part of this research, we have developed {{a model of a}} dc motor operating under load and a model of actuator efficiency under load based on a first principle evaluation of the equipment. These models include the effect that reduced voltage at the Motor Control Center and elevated containment temperatures have on the performance of a dc powered MOV. The model also accounts for motor torque and speed changes that result from the heatup of the motor during the stroke. These models are part of the Motor- Operated Valve In Site Test Assessment (MISTA) software which is capable of independently evaluating the ability of dc-powered motoroperated gate valves to achieve flow isolation and to meet required stroke times under design-basis conditions. This paper presents an overview of the dc motor model and the actuator efficiency under load model. The paper then compares the analytical results from the models with the results of actual dc motor and actuator testing, including comparisons of the effect reduced voltage, elevated containment temperature, and motor heating during the stroke have on an MOV...|$|R
40|$|One {{can find}} many reliability, availability, and {{maintainability}} (RAM) models {{proposed in the}} literature. However, such models become more complex day after day, as there {{is an attempt to}} capture equipment performance in a more realistic way, such as, explicitly addressing the effect of component ageing and degradation, surveillance activities, and corrective and preventive maintenance policies. Then, {{there is a need to}} fit the best model to real data by estimating the model parameters using an appropriate tool. This problem is not easy to solve in some cases since the number of parameters is large and the available data is scarce. This paper considers two main failure models commonly adopted to represent the probability of failure on demand (PFD) of safety equipment: (1) by demand-caused and (2) standby-related failures. It proposes a maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) approach for parameter estimation of a reliability model of demand-caused and standby-related failures of safety components exposed to degradation by demand stress and ageing that undergo imperfect maintenance. The case study considers real failure, test, and maintenance data for a typical <b>motor-operated</b> <b>valve</b> in a nuclear power plant. The results of the parameters estimation and the adoption of the best model are discussed.

40|$|The PWR Chemical and Volume Control System (CVCS) is {{designed}} to provide both safety and non-safety related functions. During normal plant operation it is used to control reactor coolant chemistry, and letdown and charging flow. In many plants, the charging pumps also provide high pressure injection, emergency boration, and RCP seal injection in emergency situations. This study examines the design, materials, maintenance, operation and actual degradation experiences of the system and main sub-components to assess the potential for age degradation. A detailed review of the Nuclear Plant Reliability Data System (NPRDS) and Licensee Event Report (LER) databases for the 1988 [...] 1991 time period, together with a review of industry and NRC experience and research, indicate that age-related degradations and failures have occurred. These failures had significant effects on plant operation, including reactivity excursions, and pressurizer level transients. The majority of these component failures resulted in leakage of reactor coolant outside the containment. A representative plant of each PWR design (W, CE, and B and W) was visited to obtain specific information on system inspection, surveillance, monitoring, and inspection practices. The results of these visits indicate that adequate system maintenance and inspection is being performed. In some instances, the frequencies of inspection were increase in response to repeated failure events. A parametric study was performed to assess the effect of system aging on Core Damage Frequency (CDF). This study showed that as <b>motor-operated</b> <b>valve</b> (MOV) operating failures increased, the contribution of the High Pressure Injection to CDF also increased...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the results of}} valve testing sponsored by the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Office of Nuclear Regulatory Research and conducted at the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory. The research objective was to evaluate the capabilities of specific actuator motor and gearbox assemblies under various design basis loading conditions. The testing was performed using the <b>motor-operated</b> <b>valve</b> load simulator, a test fixture that simulates the stem load profiles a valve actuator would experience when closing a valve against flow and pressure loadings. The authors tested five typical motors (four ac motors and one dc motor) with three gearbox assemblies at conditions a motor might experience in a power plant, including such off-normal conditions as operation at high temperature and reduced voltage. The authors also determined {{the efficiency of the}} actuator gearbox. The testing produced the following significant results: all five motors operated at or above their rated torque during tests at full voltage and ambient temperature; for all five motors (dc as well as ac), the actual torque loss due to voltage degradation was greater than the torque loss predicted using common methods; startup torques in locked rotor tests compared well with stall torques in dynamometer-type tests; the methods commonly used to predict torque losses due to elevated operating temperatures sometimes bounded the actual losses, but not in all cases; the greatest discrepancy involved the prediction for the dc motor; running efficiencies published by the manufacturer for actuator gearboxes were higher than the actual efficiencies determined from testing, in some instances, the published pullout efficiencies were also higher than the actual values; operation of the gearbox at elevated temperature did not affect the operating efficiency...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis article {{deals with}} a new <b>motor-operated</b> <b>valves</b> (MOVs) {{condition}} monitoring method. MOVs mainly consist of an induction machine driving a valve through a mechanical actuator. Such systems need important maintenance policies since they are critical concerning the operational readiness of the safety related systems of nuclear power plants. Unfortunately, today's policies present a major drawback. Indeed, these monitoring techniques rely on the measurement of an internal mechanical quantity and require the presence of human operators in dangerous power plants areas. The aim of this research work {{is to develop a}} monitoring method relying exclusively on remote electrical measurements (MOV supply voltages and currents), without the need of any internal MOV quantity. In this article, the instantaneous active power absorbed by the induction machine is first shown to be an interesting electrical quantity to elaborate mechanical failure indicators. An efficient real-time algorithm developed to estimate this physical quantity is then detailed and mechanical failure indicators based on the estimated electrical power are proposed. Finally, their performance is illustrated through experimental data...|$|R
40|$|Motor {{current and}} power {{analysis}} {{methods have been}} developed to assist in the condition monitoring of a variety of motor-driven devices. The early work in this area was conducted at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) on <b>motor-operated</b> <b>valves</b> in the mid-to-late 1980 `s in support of the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission`s Nuclear Plant Aging Research Program. The successful implementation of motor current signature analysis (MCSA) as a diagnostic for valves led to its application to other devices and to refinements in the methodologies used. Motor current and power analysis have been found to provide information that is complementary to that available from conventional diagnostics, such as vibration and pressure pulsation analysis. Inherent signal filtering associated with rotor to stator magnetic field coupling does limit the high frequency response capability of the motor as a transducer; as a result, certain phenomena, such as pump or fan vane pass energy, is not readily apparent in the motor electrical signals. On the other hand, the motor-monitored parameters have often been found to be much more sensitive than vibration transducers in detecting the effects of unsteady process conditions resulting from both system and process specific sources...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: An outline {{is given}} of how IPSN and GRS assess {{the effects of}} {{physical}} ageing on the safety of French and German Nuclear Power Plants (NPPs) {{on the basis of}} the available knowledge and how investigations are carried out. The presentation is focused exemplarily on a preliminary study illustrating approaches for the evaluation of the ageing behaviour of active components, the <b>motor-operated</b> <b>valves</b> (MOV). The results so far seems to demon-strate that the developed methodological approaches are suitable to obtain qualitative evi-dence with regard to the ageing behaviour of technical facilities such as MOV. The evalua-tion of the operating experience with French 900 MWe plants seems to reveal, for MOV of one system, a trend similar to some international findings about ageing-related events with increasing operating time; this trend will have to be confirmed. For the German NPPs so far, there appears to be no significant increase of ageing-related events concerning MOV as the plants get older. Future work on ageing scheduled at IPSN and GRS includes further co-operation on this issue, too; a deep analysis is necessary to explain the reasons of such apparent differences before any conclusion...|$|R

The research addresses the need to provide assurance that <b>motor-operated</b> <b>valves</b> can perform their intended safety function, usually to open or close against specified (design basis) flow and pressure loads. This report describes several important developments: Two methods for estimating or bounding the design basis stem factor (in rising-stem valves), using data from tests less severe than design basis tests; a new correlation for evaluating the opening responses of gate valves and for predicting opening requirements; an extrapolation method that uses the results of a best effort flow test to estimate the design basis closing requirements of a gate valve that exhibits atypical responses (peak force occurs before flow isolation); and the extension of the original INEL closing correlation to include low- flow and low-pressure loads. The report also includes a general approach, presented in step-by-step format, for determining operating margins for rising-stem valves (gate valves and globe valves) as well as quarter-turn valves (ball valves and butterfly valves) ...|$|R

For all five motors, actual torque losses due to voltage degradation were greater than the losses calculated by methods typically used for predicting motor torque at degraded voltage conditions. For the dc motor the actual torque losses due to elevated operating temperatures were greater than the losses calculated by the typical predictive method. The actual efficiencies of the actuator gearboxes were generally lower than the running efficiencies published by the manufacturer and were generally nearer the published pull-out efficiencies. Operation of the gearbox at elevated temperature did not affect the operating efficiency...|$|R
40|$|The {{results of}} Stage 2 of the Regulatory Instrument Review are {{presented}} in this volume. Selected regulatory instruments, such as the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), Regulatory Guides, and ASME Codes, were investigated {{to determine the extent}} to which these regulations apply aging management to selected safety-related components in nuclear power plants. The Regulatory Instrument Review was funded by the NRC under the Nuclear Plant Aging Research (NPAR) program. Stage 2 of the review focused on four safety-related structures and components; namely, cables, containment and basemat, reactor coolant pumps, and <b>motor-operated</b> <b>valves.</b> The review suggests that the primary-emphasis of the regulatory instruments was on the design, construction, start-up, and operation of a nuclear power plant, and that aging issues were primarily addressed after an aging-related problem was recognized. This Stage 2 review confirms the results of the prior review; (see Regulatory Instrument Review: Management of Aging of LWR Major Safety-Related Components NUREG/CR- 5490. The observations indicate that the regulations generally address management of age-related degradation indirectly. Specific age-related degradation phenomena frequently are dealt with in bulletins and notices or through generic issues, letters, etc. The major recommendation of this report, therefore, is that the regulatory instruments should more directly and explicitly address the aging phenomenon and the management of the age-related degradation process...|$|R

Part of this research addresses the friction that occurs at the interface between the valve disc and the valve body seats during operation of a gate valve. In most gate valves, these surfaces are hardfaced with Stellite 6, a cobalt-based alloy. The nuclear industry has developed methods to analytically predict the thrust needed to operate these valves at specific pressure conditions.

One {{of the questions that}} remains to be answered is whether, and to what extent, aging of the disc and seat surfaces affects the disc-to-seat coefficient of friction. Specifically, does the accumulation of a surface film due to aging of these surfaces increase the coefficient of friction and if so, how much? This paper presents results of specimen tests addressing this issue with emphasis on the following: • The change in the friction coefficient of Stellite 6 as it ages and whether the friction reaches a plateau. • The effect periodic gate valve cycling due to in-service testing has on the friction coefficient. • The results of an independent review of the test methods, processes, and the results of the research to date. • The status of ongoing aging and friction testing...|$|R
40|$|Implementing a risk-informed inservice testing (RI-IST) program {{provides}} a good aspect to the nuclear power plant licensee as an alternating program in the current ASME Section XI and 10 CFR 50. 55 a relevant testing programs. RI-IST concentrates testing resources on highly significant components, reduces excess testing burden, increases plant's availability, decreases dose rate on the plant's staff and also reduces cost on plant's operation and maintenance under nuclear safety expectations. Furthermore, RI-IST also gives a feature on prospective licensing change basis to a nuclear power plant's licensee. This study will focus on safety-related and PRA-molded <b>motor-operated</b> <b>valves</b> (MOVs) and air-operated valves (AOVs) under the inservice testing program in boiling water reactor (BWR) -type nuclear power plant. As MOVs and AOVs have crucial safety functions throughout the nuclear power plant's safety systems, the steady operation and performance of MOVs and AOVs will definitely ensure that the nuclear power plant operates under safety expectations; therefore, {{this is the key}} reason to implement risk-informed evaluation for MOVs and AOVs in this study and being able to provide the safety significance classification for MOVs and AOVs under the current IST program to the plant's management. As a pilot study of RI-IST, the methodology of qualitative assessment will incorporate with probabilistic risk assessment (PRA) analyzing MOVs' and AOVs' safety significance within the current PRA model. The evaluating result will then classify its safety significance into a high-safety significant component (HSSC) and a low-safety significant component (LSSC) for MOVs and AOVs based on relevant regulatory criteria. With this initiating achievement, it can provide a cornerstone for further studies on the other types of valves and pumps in RI-IST program and also provide a valuable reference as proposing license change to the licensee.

25|$|A {{servomotor}} is a motor, {{very often}} {{sold as a}} complete module, which is used within a position-control or speed-control feedback control system mainly control <b>valves,</b> such as <b>motor-operated</b> control <b>valves.</b> Servomotors are used in applications such as machine tools, pen plotters, and other process systems. Motors intended {{for use in a}} servomechanism must have well-documented characteristics for speed, torque, and power. The speed vs. torque curve is quite important and is high ratio for a servo motor. Dynamic response characteristics such as winding inductance and rotor inertia are also important; these factors limit the overall performance of the servomechanism loop. Large, powerful, but slow-responding servo loops may use conventional AC or DC motors and drive systems with position or speed feedback on the motor. As dynamic response requirements increase, more specialized motor designs such as coreless motors are used. AC motors' superior power density and acceleration characteristics compared to that of DC motors tends to favor PM synchronous, BLDC, induction, and SRM drive applications.|$|R
40|$|This report {{describes}} {{four sets}} of tests sponsored by the U. S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission and conducted by the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory. The tests support research addressing {{the need to provide}} assurance that <b>motor-operated</b> <b>valves</b> are able to perform their intended safety function, usually to open or close against specified (design basis) flow and pressure loads. One of the parameters that affects a gate valve's operability is the friction between the disc seats and the valve body seats. In most gate valves, these surfaces are hardfaced with Stellite 6, a cobalt-based alloy. The tests described in this report investigate the changes that occur in the friction as the Stellite 6 surfaces develop an oxide film as they age. Stellite 6 specimens were aged in a corrosion autoclave, the oxide films were examined and characterized, and the specimens were subjected to friction testing in a friction autoclave. A very thin oxide film formed after only a fe w days of natural aging. Even a very thin oxide film caused an increase in friction. The surface structure of the oxide film was dominated by a hard crystalline structure, such that the friction response was analogous to rubbing two pieces of sandpaper together. In the limited data provided by naturally aged specimens (78 days maximum exposure, very thin oxide films), the friction increased with greater aging time, approaching an as-yet-undetermined plateau. Although the thickness of the oxide film increased with greater aging time, the mechanical properties of the oxide film (larger granules with greater aging time) appeared to play a greater role in the friction response. Friction testing of specimens subjected to simulated in-service testing strokes at intervals during the aging process showed only a slight decrease in friction, compared to other specimens. Results from specimens subjected to accelerated aging were inconclusive, because of differences in the structure and comp osition of the oxide films, compared to naturally aged specimens. For the naturally aged specimens, the highest friction occurred on the first stroke. The first stroke smeared the oxide film and dislodged some of the granules, so that subsequent strokes saw lower friction values and less variation in the friction. This result underscores the importance of planning in-plant tests so that data are collected from the first stroke following a period of inactivity...|$|R
