5000|$|The [...] "registered jack" [...] in RJ11, RJ45 {{and similar}} connectors, and {{includes}} the <b>modular</b> <b>jacks</b> used in modern telephone systems and computer network interfaces (for example, [...] "Ethernet jack").|$|R
50|$|The {{connectors}} {{used for}} registered jack installations are primarily the modular connector and the 50-pin miniature ribbon connector. For example, RJ11 uses a six-position two-conductor connector (6P2C), RJ14 uses a six-position four-conductor (6P4C) <b>modular</b> <b>jack,</b> while RJ21 uses a 25-pair (50-pin) miniature ribbon connector.|$|E
50|$|Some modular {{connectors}} are indexed: their {{dimensions are}} intentionally non-standard, preventing connections with connectors of standard dimensions. The means of indexing may be non-standard cross-section dimensions or shapes, retention mechanism dimensions, or retention mechanism quantity. For example, a Modified <b>Modular</b> <b>Jack</b> (MMJ) using an offset latching tab {{was developed by}} Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) to prevent accidental interchange of data and telephone cables.|$|E
5000|$|The VT200s {{were the}} last DEC {{terminals}} to provide a 20mA current loop serial interface, an older standard originally developed for the telegraph system. A standard 25-pin D-connector was also provided for RS-232. Only {{one of the two}} ports could be in use at a given time. Later DEC terminals would replace both of these with their proprietary Modified <b>Modular</b> <b>Jack</b> (MMJ) connectors.|$|E
5000|$|In the mid 1970s, AT&T {{introduced}} modular connectors for {{the line}} cord and handset cords, requiring the [...] RJ11 standard home telephone jack. Most customers who had Princess telephones {{were converted to}} <b>modular</b> <b>jacks.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Different {{manufacturers}} of 8P8C <b>modular</b> <b>jacks</b> arrange for the pins of the 8P8C <b>modular</b> connector <b>jack</b> {{to be linked}} to wire connectors (often IDC type terminals) that are in a different physical arrangement from that of other manufacturers: Thus, for example, if a technician is in the habit of connecting the white/orange wire to the [...] "bottom right hand" [...] IDC terminal, which links it to 8P8C modular connector pin 1, in jacks made by other manufacturers this terminal may instead connect to 8P8C modular connector pin 2 (or any other pin). Labels and manufacturer's documentation should be consulted whenever an unfamiliar connector is first encountered.|$|R
25|$|All {{technologies}} except Fibre to the Node (FTTN) and Fibre to the Curb (FTTC, previously called Fibre to {{the distribution}} point (FTTdp)) provide User Network Interface (UNI) <b>jacks</b> (<b>modular</b> <b>jacks</b> for data (UNI-D, RJ45)) in premises. FTTN and FTTC each require premises {{to have a}} compatible VDSL2 modem. FTTC requires power to be provided from the premises to the kerb (distribution point).|$|R
50|$|In floodwired environments {{the center}} (blue) pair {{is often used}} to carry {{telephony}} signals. Where so wired, the physical layout of the 8P8C <b>modular</b> <b>jack</b> allows for the insertion of an RJ11 plug {{in the center of the}} jack, provided the RJ11 plug is wired in true compliance with the U.S. telephony standards (RJ11) using the center pair. The formal approach to connect telephony equipment is the insertion of a type-approved converter.|$|E
50|$|The Modified <b>Modular</b> <b>Jack</b> (MMJ) {{is a small}} {{form-factor}} {{serial port}} connector developed by Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC). It uses {{a modified version of}} the 6P6C modular connector with the latch displaced off-center so standard modular connectors found on Ethernet cables or phone jacks cannot accidentally be plugged in. MMJ connections are used on Digital minicomputers, such as the PDP-11, VAX and Alpha systems, and to connect terminals, printers, and serial console servers.|$|E
50|$|The <b>modular</b> <b>jack</b> {{was chosen}} as a {{candidate}} for ISDN systems. In order to be considered, the connector system had to be defined by an international standard, leading {{to the creation of the}} ISO 8877 standard. Under the rules of the IEEE 802 standards project, international standards are to be preferred over national standards so when the original 10BASE-T twisted-pair wiring version of Ethernet was developed, the modular connector {{was chosen as}} the basis for IEEE 802.3i-1990.|$|E
5000|$|A lineman's handset {{typically}} connects via {{a pair of}} test leads, not the modular connector {{found on}} most consumer telephone equipment. The test leads will feature some combination of alligator clips (to connect to bare wires), a piercing spike or [...] "bed-of-nails" [...] (for insulated wires), and something designed to fit a punch block. Adapters designed to fit other punch block types, heat coil sockets, or <b>modular</b> <b>jacks</b> may also be used.|$|R
50|$|The vast {{majority}} of houses in the U.S. are wired with 6-position <b>modular</b> <b>jacks</b> with four conductors (6P4C) wired to the house's junction box with copper wires. Those wires may be connected back to two telephone overhead lines at the local telephone exchange, thus making those jacks RJ14 jacks. More often, {{only two of the}} wires are connected to the exchange as one telephone line, and the others are unconnected. In that case, the jacks in the house are RJ11.|$|R
5000|$|An analog {{telephone}} adapter is {{a device that}} connects to the network and implements the electronics and firmware to operate a conventional {{analog telephone}} attached through a <b>modular</b> phone <b>jack.</b> Some residential Internet gateways and cablemodems have this function built in.|$|R
50|$|Two {{types of}} 8P8C plugs and {{installation}} tools (used for crimping the plug onto a cable) are commonly available: Western Electric/Stewart Stamping (WE/SS) and Tyco/AMP. While both types look remarkably similar, the tooling used {{to install the}} two different plug types is mutually exclusive and cannot be interchanged between the two types. WE/SS compatible plugs are available from {{a large number of}} manufacturers, whereas Tyco/AMP plugs are produced exclusively by Tyco Electronics. Both types of modular plugs will plug into the same standard 8P8C <b>modular</b> <b>jack.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Since most devices {{do not use}} all of the 20 {{signals that}} are defined by the standard, smaller {{connectors}} are often used. For example, the 9-pin DE-9 connector is used by most IBM-compatible PCs since the IBM PC AT, and has been standardized as TIA-574. More recently, modular connectors have been used. Most common are 8P8C connectors, for which the EIA/TIA-561 standard defines a pinout, while the [...] "Yost Serial Device Wiring Standard" [...] invented by Dave Yost (and popularized by the Unix System Administration Handbook) is common on Unix computers and newer devices from Cisco Systems. 10P10C connectors {{can be found on}} some devices as well. Digital Equipment Corporation defined their own DECconnect connection system which is based on the Modified <b>Modular</b> <b>Jack</b> (MMJ) connector. This is a 6-pin <b>modular</b> <b>jack</b> where the key is offset from the center position. As with the Yost standard, DECconnect uses a symmetrical pin layout which enables the direct connection between two DTEs. Another common connector is the DH10 header connector common on motherboards and add-in cards which is usually converted via a cable to the more standard 9-pin DE-9 connector (and frequently mounted on a free slot plate or other part of the housing).|$|E
5000|$|RS/EIA/TIA-423 is a {{standard}} for serial communications. It defines an unbalanced (single-ended) interface (similar to RS-232), with a single, unidirectional sending driver, and allows for up to 10 receivers (similar to RS-422). It is normally implemented in integrated circuit technology and can also be employed for the interchange of serial binary signals between DTE & DCE. There is no common pinout for RS-423. The BBC Micro computer used a 5-pin DIN connector. DEC used it extensively with a Modified <b>Modular</b> <b>Jack</b> connector. This was sometimes called [...] "DEC-423".|$|E
5000|$|The BS 6312 jack {{has been}} used in New Zealand since the 1980s, {{replacing}} a number of other connectors and hard-wired connections, and was subsequently replaced by a [...] "2-wire" [...] version suited to daisy chain wiring that eliminated the 3rd ringing voltage wire. The [...] "BT Jack" [...] is still the most common phone jack in use, although many installations in business use structured cabling with [...] "RJ45" [...] 8p8c modular connectors for telephone as well as data services. Since 2010 the Telecommunications Carriers Forum Premises Wiring Code of Practice has deprecated BT jacks in favour of [...] "RJ45" [...] <b>modular</b> <b>jacks</b> for all new residential and SOHO phone/data networks, although not yet a mandatory standard in 2016.|$|R
50|$|DECserver 300The DECserver 300 Terminal Server was an Ethernet Communications Server for Ethernet Local Area Networks, {{providing}} a convenient method to logically connect up to sixteen digital asynchronous terminals {{to one or}} more service nodes (hosts) on an Ethernet. The DECserver 300 used MMJs (Modified <b>Modular</b> <b>Jacks)</b> for the attachment of asynchronous devices. The MMJ segregated a Data from a Voice connection. The DECserver 300 utilized the EIA 423-A electrical interface standard for local connections. EIA 423-A is compatible with the EIA 232-D interface and supports DTR/DSR (Data Terminal Ready/Data Set Ready) signals. EIA 423-A supports longer cable runs and higher signaling speeds. The DECserver 300 implemented the LAT protocol for communication with service nodes that implemented this protocol on the same Ethernet. The DECserver 300 also implemented the TCP/IP protocol suite for communication with host systems that implemented TCP/IP.|$|R
50|$|Mindset's {{design was}} modular in many aspects. The {{top of the}} case had an opening to access its system bus, this allowed for the {{expansion}} module to plug into the main computer module to add memory {{and one or two}} disk drives. The Mindset was designed by several ex-Atari engineers like the Amiga 1000, another computer of the era with an advanced graphics subsystem and <b>modular</b> expandability. <b>Jack</b> Tramiel (forming TTL - Tramiel Technologies Limited) tried to buy Mindset's technology in Spring of 1984.|$|R
50|$|Early Macs {{used the}} {{built-in}} serial ports for LocalTalk, which {{set up a}} fast (at the time) network between two machines. Later, a modified AUI port was added named Apple Attachment Unit Interface {{to provide a more}} user friendly version of 10BASE2 cabling and adapters, with Apple's version known as FriendlyNet. As this was an implementation of an Ethernet physical layer it was indifferent to the protocols used - and allowed connection of Macintosh machines using LocalTalk, TCP/IP, or other protocols assuming it was supported by programs. Eventually as Ethernet over twisted pair emerged as the dominate method for connecting computers, all Macs adopted the now familiar modular 8 pin <b>modular</b> <b>jack</b> as standard. Fibre Channel adapters are also available for the Mac Pro and the discontinued Xserve, generally for connection to large storage subsystems and/or high bandwidth multimedia applications.|$|E
50|$|The VT1000 and VT1200 was {{packaged}} in a pizza box {{case with the}} monitor normally sitting on top and an LK400 series keyboard connected to it using a coiled cord and 4-pin modular connector. The three-button mouse was roughly puck-shaped, not unlike the original iMac mouse, and used a custom 7-pin round connector. The back panel included a coax connector for the monitor, mouse and keyboard ports, a Modified <b>Modular</b> <b>Jack</b> (MMJ) serial port for a printer, another MMJ serial port for host connections, and a thinwire Ethernet connector. It also included AC in and out connectors, the latter used to connect the monitor, allowing it to be turned on and off with the terminal using a single switch located {{on the side of}} the case beside the power connectors. The system supported a number of monochrome monitors, selected using a rotary switch beside the monitor port.|$|E
5000|$|The 8P8C <b>modular</b> plugs and <b>jacks</b> {{look very}} similar to the plugs and jacks used for FCC's {{registered}} jack RJ45 variants, although the specified RJ45 socket is not compatible with 8P8C modular plug connectors. It neither uses all eight conductors (but only two of them for wires plus two for connecting a programming resistor) nor does it fit into 8P8C because the true RJ45 is [...] "keyed".|$|R
5000|$|... early 70s The {{clear plastic}} button {{backplate}} with colored paper backing matching {{the color of}} the phone is replaced with an aluminum backplate on the round button Touch-Tone phones. Also at this time, the round handset cords using proprietary connectors are replaced with modern flat <b>modular</b> cords and <b>jacks.</b> On all Trimline phones, the screw cover above the dial changes from reading [...] "Bell System made by Western Electric" [...] to just [...] "Trimline" [...] with a bell logo {{to the left of the}} text.|$|R
50|$|Modular {{connectors}} {{were developed}} to replace older telephone installation methods that used either hardwired cords, or bulkier varieties of telephone plugs. The common nomenclature for modular connectors includes the number of contact positions {{and the number of}} wires connected, for example 6P indicates a six-position <b>modular</b> plug or <b>jack.</b> A six-position <b>modular</b> plug with conductors in the middle two positions and the other four positions unused has the designation 6P2C. RJ11 uses a 6P2C connector. The connectors could be supplied with more pins, but if more pins are actually wired, the interface is not an RJ11.|$|R
50|$|Although {{commonly}} referred to as an RJ45 in the context of Ethernet and category 5 cables, it is incorrect to refer to a generic 8P8C connector as an RJ45. A telephone-system-standard RJ45 plug has a key which excludes insertion in an un-keyed 8P8C socket. The registered jack (RJ) standard specifies a different mechanical interface and wiring scheme for an RJ45S from TIA/EIA-568-B which is often used for modular connectors used in Ethernet and telephone applications. 8P8C <b>modular</b> plugs and <b>jacks</b> look very similar to the plugs and jacks used for FCC's registered jack RJ45 variants, although the RJ45S is not compatible with 8P8C modular connectors.|$|R
