40|$|Fast nuclei are {{ionizing}} radiation {{which can cause}} deleterious effects to irradiated cells. The modelling of the interactions of such ions with matter and the related effects {{are very important to}} physics, radiobiology, medicine and space science and technology. A powerful method to study the interactions of {{ionizing radiation}} with biological systems was developed in the field of <b>microdosimetry.</b> <b>Microdosimetry</b> spectra characterize the energy deposition to objects of cellular size, i. e., a few micrometers. In the present thesis the interaction of ions with tissue-like media was investigated using the Monte Carlo model for Heavy-Ion Therapy (MCHIT) developed at the Frankfurt Institute for Advanced Studies. MCHIT is a Geant 4 -based application intended to benchmark the physical models of Geant 4 and investigate the physical properties of therapeutic ion beams. We have implemented new features in MCHIT in order to calculate microdosimetric quantities characterizing the radiation fields of accelerated nucleons and nuclei. The results of our Monte Carlo simulations were compared with recent experimental <b>microdosimetry</b> data. In addition to <b>microdosimetry</b> calculations with MCHIT, we also investigated the biological properties of ion beams, e. g. their relative biological effectiveness (RBE), by means of the modified Microdosimetric-Kinetic model (MKM). The MKM uses <b>microdosimetry</b> spectra in describing cell response to radiation. MCHIT+MKM allowed us to study the physical and biological properties of ion beams. The main results of the thesis are as follows: MCHIT is able to describe the spatial distribution of the physical dose in tissue-like media and <b>microdosimetry</b> spectra for ions with energies relevant to space research and ion-beam cancer therapy; MCHIT+MKM predicts a reduction of the biological effectiveness of ions propagating in extended medium due to nuclear fragmentation reactions; We predicted favourable biological dose-depth profiles for monoenergetic helium and lithium beams similar to the one for carbon beam. Well-adjusted biological dose distributions for H- 1, He- 4, C- 12 and O- 16 with a very flat spread-out Bragg peak (SOBP) plateau were calculated with MCHIT+MKM; MCHIT+MKM predicts less damage to healthy tissues in the entrance channel for SOBP He- 4 and C- 12 beams compared to H- 1 and O- 16 ones. No definitive advantages for oxygen ions with respect to carbon were found...|$|E

The impact of fragmentation reactions on <b>microdosimetry</b> spectra is investigated for He- 4, Li- 7 and C- 12, and contributions from nuclear fragments of different charge are evaluated for various TEPC positions in the phantom.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an overview of}} the development of semiconductor <b>microdosimetry</b> and the most current (state-of-the-art) Silicon on Insulator (SOI) detectors for <b>microdosimetry</b> based mainly on research and development carried out at the Centre for Medical Radiation Physics (CMRP) at the Uni- versity of Wollongong with collaborators over the last 18 years. In this paper every generation of CMRP SOI microdosimeters, including their fabrication, design, and electrical and charge collection character- isation are presented. A study of SOI microdosimeters in various radiation ﬁelds has demonstrated that under appropriate geometrical scaling, the response of SOI detectors with the well-known geometry of microscopically sensitive volumes will record the energy deposition spectra representative of tissue cells of an equivalent shape. This development of SOI detectors for <b>microdosimetry</b> with increased complexity has improved the deﬁnition of microscopic sensitive volume (SV), which is modelling the deposition of ionising energy in a biological cell, that are led from planar to 3 D SOI detectors with an array of segmented microscopic 3 D SVs.

An SOI microdosimeter “bridge” with 3 D SVs can derive the relative biological effectiveness (RBE) in 12 C ion radiation therapy that matches the tissue equivalent proportional counter (TEPC) quite well, but with outstanding spatial resolution.

30|$|Usually, MIRD {{formalism}} and macrodosimetry {{have been}} used to determine mean absorbed dose to the thyroid for 211 At, assuming homogeneous activity concentration in thyroid tissue [13, 14]. To compare if <b>microdosimetry</b> would give other absorbed doses than conventional macrodosimetry, we calculated the absorbed dose to the follicle cell nuclei from the amount of 211 At homogeneously distributed in the lumens (multiple follicle model) that gives a mean absorbed dose of 1 [*]Gy. Corresponding microscopic data were then 0.84, 1.18 and 0.71 [*]Gy for the mouse, rat and human models, respectively. A similar comparison for 131 I gave a microdosimetric value of 0.98 [*]Gy to the follicle cells due to the longer ranges of the electrons emitted [22]. Thus, our results show the importance of <b>microdosimetry</b> for non-homogeneous distribution of radionuclides emitting short-ranged particles in a thyroid.|$|E

In these radiation fields, determination of dose equivalent is not straightforward; however, the use of microdosimetric principles and techniques could solve this problem. In this paper, the authors discuss the measurement of lineal energy, a microscopic analog to linear energy transfer, and demonstrate {{the development and implementation of}} the variance-covariance method, a novel method in experimental <b>microdosimetry.</b> This method permits the determination of dose mean lineal energy, an essential parameter of radiation quality, in a radiation field of unknown spectrum, time-varying dose rate, and high dose rate.

40|$|This thesis {{continues}} {{research into}} the application of silicon <b>microdosimetry</b> to hadron therapy applications. It proposes the use of silicon <b>microdosimetry</b> for the verification of Monte Carlo calculations in hadron therapy. When applied in this manner, many of the restrictions previously impeding the use of silicon microdosimeters in hadron therapy are relaxed. An ion mircrophone was used to study the charge collection properties of the silicon microdosimeters using ions commonly found in the primary and secondary radiation of hadron therapy. An experimental setup was developed and diagnostic studies were conducted to establish low beam fluence and micron beam resolution necessary for the measurements. GEANT 4 Monte Carol simulations of the measurements facilitated the quantification of the charge collection efficiency of the devices for ions with various Linear Energy Transfer values. An ion beam analysis technique was developed to measure the collection time of charge carriers generated following ion strikes on the silicon microdosimeter. The dependence of this charge collection time was studied using the ion microprobe. A pulse shape discrimination technique was then implemented {{in an attempt to}} improve the spectral response of the microdosimeter. Simple Monte Carol simulations of silicon <b>microdosimetry</b> measurements in Fast Neutron Therapy and Proton Therapy were conducted using the GEANT 4 Monte Carlo toolkit. The charge collection efficiency information obtained from microprobe experiments was incorporated into the simulation. Discrpancies between experimental and theoretical measurements was then used to suggest improvements to the simulations. Future recommendations for the application of silicon microdosimeters in this capacity are discussed along with suggestions for other silicon based instrumentation...|$|E
40|$|The harsh space {{radiation}} environment, {{imposes a}} significant risk, to both biological and non-biological matter. Radiation Induced Damage (RID), {{depends upon the}} type and energy of radiation and the material properties of the interacting medium. The similarities between microelectronics and biological cells in relation to RID then, are such that a common methodology of measuring radiation dose might be used. <b>Microdosimetry,</b> being a technique that allows for the measurement of stochastic energy deposition distributions within micron size sensitive volume (SV), is a methodology well suited to act as dose monitoring system for biological and non-biological matter. A number of restrictions are placed upon device operation within the space radiation environment,that must be addressed when considering the viability of a detector. The cost of deployment, necessitates that the size, weight and power usage of the device be minimal. Spatial resolution, tissue equivalence and radiation hardness, especially for long term biological applications are concerned, are also vital. Solid state <b>microdosimetry</b> is well suited {{to address these issues}} and requirements, given the appropriate selection of materials such as diamond, which is both tissue equivalent and radiation hard. A variety of different device structures based upon different fabrication technologies were developed and investigated with respect to applicability to <b>microdosimetry.</b> The behaviour of each device, was studied using both experimental and simulation based techniques. Experimental characterisation was performed to determine the electrical and charge collection properties of each device and validate charge confinement to the desired SV region. Simulation studies, to support experimental results, utilised two different simulations package suites; Geant 4 and Sentaurus TCAD. Geant 4 was used to investigate the effect of contact thickness upon energy deposition in addition to determining a tissue equivalence correction, to convert the energy deposition response in diamond to that in water. TCAD was used to model device structures and characterising the electric field structures and response to heavy ion strikes. TCAD modelling enabled a pre-fabrication assessment tool for device design and optimisation. The results presented, demonstrate the viability of diamond along with a variety of different fabrication techniques, employed to produce structures, for solid state <b>microdosimetry.</b> Provided certain recommendations are followed, this work will certainly lead to the eventual realisation and commercialisation of diamond based devices for microdosimetric applications in space...|$|E

The recommendations for external radiation protection were outlined in ICRP Publication 51 and ICRP Publication 60. There is a growing need to measure the doses received from extraterrestrial sources at high altitudes. In the European Union (EU), flight staff are already classified as radiation workers following the European Commission Council Directive 96 / 29 /EURATOM of 13 May 1996 defining {{the need for the}} exposure of the airline crew to the elevated levels of radiation to be monitored.

40|$|Abstract: Recent {{developments}} in {{optically stimulated luminescence}} (OSL) dating allow the deter-mination of signals in increasingly smaller sample amounts. This has led to <b>microdosimetry</b> having a larger impact on equivalent dose (DE) distributions and therefore, detection and assessment of spatial distribution of radionuclides has become more important. This study demonstrates the application of autoradiography using imaging plates to determine spatially resolved radiation inhomogeneities in different types of samples. Qualitative evaluations of radiation inhomogeneity are carried out on un-consolidated sediments {{as well as on}} hard rock samples. While indicating some limitations of appli-cability, the results demonstrate that the method is an efficient tool to detect and document spatial variations in a sample’s radiation field. It therefore provides a possibility to rapidly screen samples to check whether <b>microdosimetry</b> might affect the DE data. Furthermore, an approach to calibrate autoradiographic images for quantitative use is suggested. Us-ing pressed powder pellets of reference materials, a series of calibration images were exposed, from which a functional relation between specific sample activity and greyscale value in the autoradio-graphic image has been deduced.
