40|$|Sporocysts of Isospora endocallimici, a {{parasite}} of marmosets, {{were exposed to}} <b>minimal</b> <b>essentials</b> <b>medium</b> (MEM) or a trypsin-bile salt solution (TBS) and then fixed and prepared for trans- mission electron microscopy. Excystation occurred in TBS but not MEM. The sporocyst wall has 2 layers, a thin outer layer (15 to 110 nm thick) and a thick inner layer (65 to 180 nm thick), which is composed of 4 separate curved plates. The outer layer consists of 1 to 3 membranes interspersed with lipid droplets. In the inner layer, {{a thin layer of}} material connects the peripheral margins of 2 apposing plates. Immediately beneath this layer, a thin strip of material is interposed between the 2 apposing plates. Ultrastructural changes preparatory to excystation occur primarily in the inner layer of the sporocyst wall. The TBS acts upon the site of apposition between 2 plates causing the interposed strip to swell and separate from the margin of each plate which leads to collapse of the sporocyst. As the sporocyst collapses, the margins of each curved plate curl inward {{toward the center of the}} sporocyst...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{pathogenesis}} of enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) O 157 :H 7 {{infection is}} attributed to virulence factors encoded on multiple pathogenicity islands. Previous {{studies have shown that}} EHEC O 157 :H 7 modulates host cell signal transduction cascades, independent of toxins and rearrangement of the cytoskeleton. However, the virulence factors and mechanisms responsible for EHEC-mediated subversion of signal transduction remain to be determined. Therefore, {{the purpose of this study}} was to first identify differentially regulated genes in response to EHEC O 157 :H 7 grown in the presence of epithelial cells, compared to growth in the absence of epithelial cells (that is, growth in <b>minimal</b> <b>essential</b> tissue culture <b>medium</b> alone, <b>minimal</b> <b>essential</b> tissue culture <b>medium</b> in the presence of 5 % CO 2, and Penassay broth alone) and, second, to identify EHEC virulence factors responsible for pathogen modulation of host cell signal transduction. Methodology/Principal Findings: Overnight cultures of EHEC O 157 :H 7 were incubated for 6 hr at 37 uC in the presence or absence of confluent epithelial (HEp- 2) cells. Total RNA was then extracted and used for microarray analyses (Affymetrix E. coli Genome 2. 0 gene chips). Relative to bacteria grown in each of the other conditions, EHEC O 157 :H 7 cultured in the presence of cultured epithelial cells displayed a distinct gene-expression profile. A 2. 0 -fold increase in the expression of 71 genes and a 2. 0 -fold decrease in expression of 60 other genes were identified in EHEC O 157 :H 7 grown in the presence of epithelial cells, compared to bacteria grown in media alone...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} study we {{examined}} the effect of culture media and protein source on the formation of pluripotent primary outgrowths from in vitro produced and in vivo derived porcine embryos {{as the first step}} towards the isolation of embryonic stem cells (ESCs). To do this we compared high glucose Dulbeccos Modified Eagles <b>Medium</b> (DMEM) with <b>Minimal</b> <b>Essential</b> Alpha <b>Medium</b> (αMEM) both supplemented with fetal bovine serum (FBS) or serum replacement (SR) in a 2 × 2 factorial design. Culture in DMEM or αMEM supplemented with 10 % SR resulted in the establishment of homogenous populations of cells which expressed Oct 4 and Nanog. In contrast culture in either media with FBS resulted in the formation of embryonal outgrowths composed entirely of differentiated cells or a mixture of differentiated cells and putative ESCs which grew poorly and could not be passaged. Using αMEM medium containing 10 % SR and culturing in 5 % oxygen, putative ESC lines were isolated from in vitro and in vivo derived embryos at efficiencies of 2 and 10 % respectively.

Comparing DNA synthesis in normal adult rat hepatocytes with DNA synthesis in hepatocytes isolated from regenerating livers, we found with <b>minimal</b> <b>essential</b> <b>medium</b> alone little DNA synthesis in normal adult rat hepatocytes and in hepatocytes isolated 4, 8, or 12 h after 70 % hepatectomy. In hepatocytes isolated 24 h after partial hepatectomy, however, the incorporation of [3 H]thymidine was 3 {{times the rate of}} normal hepatocytes. The addition of insulin to <b>minimal</b> <b>essential</b> <b>medium</b> had minimal effect on DNA synthesis in all hepatocytes. Addition of epidermal growth factor alone or in combination with insulin resulted in a dramatic increase in DNA synthesis in hepatocytes from regenerating rat liver. Increased incorporation was detectable as early as 4 h after partial hepatectomy and reached a maximum at 24 h after the operation. Results obtained with [3 H]thymidine incorporation were confirmed by autoradiography and by direct DNA determinations in hepatocyte cultures. Epidermal growth factor binding to the hepatocytes was determined and agreed with previously reported binding studies.
