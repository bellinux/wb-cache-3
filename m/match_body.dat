50|$|The {{fidelity}} of {{the shapes}} {{to the real}} cars was good, but not excellent. Perhaps the Riviera's and Barracuda's proportions are the best, while the Charger looks a bit stretched. The roof of the Corvette is a bit squarish and the opening doors on the Corvair look rather roundish compared to body panels {{they are supposed to}} <b>match.</b> <b>Body</b> lines are not smooth, with sometimes gravelly and uneven edges. Many of these cars have front and rear bumpers that are part of diecast plastic bases. Being such, many times the bumpers do not match up well with the diecast metal bodies, leaving gaps, as with the Barracuda shown above. (Goranson 2008). Wheels were simple and unadorned indented silver metal discs with protruding axle ends. Some later cars had plastic five-spoke 'star' chrome wheels.|$|E
50|$|Later Jericho, still {{trapped in}} <b>Match's</b> <b>body,</b> {{seemingly}} escaped from S.T.A.R. Labs in visible distress {{and asking for}} his friends' help. The Titans managed to help him escape <b>Match's</b> <b>body,</b> but it soon became apparent how much the experience had twisted Jericho's mind, leaving him bent on the Titans' destruction.|$|R
50|$|During the 1990s, officer uniforms {{changed with}} darker shirts and <b>matching</b> <b>body</b> armour vests were introduced. In {{the early years}} the OPP wore olive green {{coloured}} uniforms.|$|R

5000|$|The 4-4-2 model {{moved to}} the {{notchback}} Oldsmobile Cutlass Calais to return to its roots as a performance car as it had a larger 350 V8 engine not available on other Cutlass models. It included W-30 badging on the front fenders above the side marker lights, with less dramatic graphics. Otherwise, the cars shared identical powertrain,(minus the Hurst Shifter), with the '79 H/O. Also available only in gold over white or gold over black paint, a total of 886 were built, 540 in Black, and 346 in White.The MSRP of a Cutlass Calais in 1980 was $6,919.57. Option W-30 4-4-2 Appearance and Handling Package cost $1,255.12. This package consisted of: Gold Accent Paint Scheme (Y71), Painted Grille Face, Applique Pillar Molding, Aluminum Sport Wheels, [...] "W-30" [...] Decals on Front Fender, Tail Lamp Bezel and Rear Window Molding to <b>Match</b> <b>Body</b> Color, [...] "442" [...] Emblem on Sail Panel and Deck Lid, Engine 5.7 Liter (350 CID) V8, 4-bbl (L34), Sport Console (D55), Rallye Suspension Package (FE2), Tires P205/70R14 Steel Belted Radial Ply Blackwall with Raised White Letters (QFV) and Digital Clock (UE8). The W-30 4-4-2 option was not available in California.|$|E
5000|$|The Ram SRT-10 had {{a unique}} hood that {{featured}} a wide power bulge and honeycomb grill hood scoop. The hood scoop allowed cool air to enter {{as well as}} forcing hot air to exit from the engine bay, thus helping the engine to run cooler. [...] "Viper Powered" [...] badges {{were added to the}} sides of the power bulge, to indicate the SRT-10 engine under the hood. Large chrome SRT-10 logos were mounted to the driver and passenger side doors and rear tailgate right side on the Quad cab and Single Cab 2005 models replaced in 2006 by smaller chrome and red SRT-10 logo badges [...] All models were outfitted with large molded kickerpanels painted to <b>match</b> <b>body</b> color. Another exterior feature was a tonneau cover with an attached spoiler that was supposed to come standard on the 2005 Quad Cab version and all 2006 models, but due to manufacturing problems was not installed on nearly half of the Ram SRT-10s intended. To help remedy this situation, Dodge added a $1000 credit and a regular spoiler to the Ram SRT-10s that did not receive the tonneau cover. In addition to style, the spoiler also helped with air flow and provided a reduction in lift and drag. The Ram SRT-10 had a bed size of 6 ft, giving the regular cab an overall length of 17 ft, and 19 ft overall length for the Quad Cab. The Ram SRT-10 also had a lower ride height than regular Ram trucks.|$|E
30|$|If this {{hypothesis}} is correct, a further issue remains to be addressed: how do dolphins match human body parts (including the face) to their own bodies? It {{is clear that the}} body structure of dolphins and humans is completely different, both anatomically and visually. Therefore, matching, for example, the rostrum to the mouth, pectoral fins to the arms, and caudal fins to the legs appears problematic. However, evidence from motor imitation studies suggests that dolphins can <b>match</b> <b>body</b> parts in this manner (Herman 2002, 2012). Bottlenose dolphins will “imitate” the movements of a human model; when the model raised his leg, the dolphins raised their caudal fins, and when the human extended his arms, dolphins extended their pectoral fins. Therefore, in the present experiment, it is plausible that our dolphins recognized the correspondence between the human head and body and their own anatomy.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} Ramadan fasting on body water status markers of rugby players at basal condition and following a simulation of rugby sevens match. Methods: Twelve recreational rugby sevens players played three matches: one day before Ramadan (before Ramadan), {{at the end of}} the first week of Ramadan (Beg-R) and at the end of Ramadan (End-R). Before and immediately after each <b>match,</b> <b>body</b> weight was determined and blood samples were taken for the measurement of body water status markers.

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the level of}} dehydration after a match in 20 soccer players (mean ± SD, 17. 9 ± 1. 3 years old, height 1. 75 ± 0. 05 m, body mass 70. 71 ± 7. 65 kg) from two teams that participate in a Brazilian Championship game performed at a temperature of 29 ± 1. 1 C and a relative humidity of 64 ± 4. 2 %. Body mass, urine specific gravity and urinary protein were measured {{before and after the}} match, and self-perception measurements were performed during the <b>match.</b> <b>Body</b> mass loss was 1. 00 ± 0. 39 kg, corresponding to a dehydration percentage of 1. 35 ± 0. 87 %. The mean sweating rate during the match was 866 ± 319 ml[*]·[*]h[sup]- 1 [/sup] and total fluid intake was 1265. 00 ± 505. 45 ml. The sweating rate and the quantity of ingested fluids correlated positively (r = 0. 98; P< 0. 05). Protein occurred in the urine in 18 soccer players. The players showed no perception of thirst and considered themselves as comfortable during the match. At the end of the match the soccer players replaced 57. 7 ± 15 % of the water loss and presented a condition of significant to severe dehydration based on the post-match urine specific gravity data (1. 027 ± 6 g[*]·[*]ml[sup]- 1 [/sup]). The results of this study demonstrate that most of the soccer players began the match with some degree of dehydration that worsened during the match...|$|E

Methods:Twelve recreational rugby sevens players played three matches: one day before Ramadan (before Ramadan), {{at the end of}} the first week of Ramadan (Beg-R) and at the end of Ramadan (End-R). Before and immediately after each <b>match,</b> <b>body</b> weight was determined and blood samples were taken for the measurement of body water status markers.

Total body water measured before Ramadan did not differ significantly from that of Ramadan. After the match, values of hematocrit and plasma osmolarity increased significantly at End-R (+ 1. 4 %, P= 0. 02; + 3. 1 %, p < 0. 001 respectively) compared to before Ramadan. Although, hemoglobin measured after matches occurring during Ramadan did not differ from those of before Ramadan. In response to matches, the change of percentage of body water status markers did not differ during each period of the investigation. Conclusions:The present results show that Ramadan fasting induces dehydration at basal conditions. Also, rugby sevens match played during Ramadan did not exacerbate the magnitude of responses to matches of blood and body water status markers...|$|E
5000|$|The {{intuitive}} {{feature of}} body language used in teaching is the exemplification of the language, especially individual words, {{through the use}} of <b>matching</b> <b>body</b> language. For example, when teaching about the word [...] "cry", teachers can imitate a crying person. This enables a deeper impression which is able to lead to greater understanding of the particular word.|$|R
5000|$|The {{definition}} of a [...] "matched headstock" [...] varies between manufacturers and players - for example, the headstocks of Gibson guitars are nearly always black, and it is debatable whether a black-bodied Gibson has a matching headstock.

30|$|While faces may be {{the most}} {{important}} key to identity, in many everyday situations there may be information available from bodies as well. An eye witness to a crime remembers more than just the face of a criminal - they will describe their height, build and perhaps gait too. Noyes, Hill & O’Toole (2018) investigate whether screening with the GFMT predicts performance on matching faces (in a different task), <b>matching</b> <b>bodies</b> and <b>matching</b> bodily motions from point-light displays. Although groups identified as “good” or “bad” face matchers do also differ on performance in <b>matching</b> <b>bodies,</b> examination of individual differences showed that the GFMT correlates only with the other face-matching test, and not with the two body-matching tests. This underlines that for practical screening and/or theoretical interpretation the analysis of individual differences is essential. Noyes et al. argue that this “points to the use of individual differences to inform how or, indeed, whether to apply group analyses” rather than to individual differences being mentioned only as an afterthought.|$|R
40|$|Objective: The {{mechanisms}} by which bariatric surgeries so effectively and lastingly reduce body weight and normalize metabolic dysfunction are not well understood. Fibroblast growth fator- 21 (FGF 21) is a key regulator of metabolism and is currently considered for treatment of obesity. Although elevated by acute food deprivation, it is downregulated after weight loss induced by chronic calorie restriction but not after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery. Therefore, {{the goal of the}} present study was to assess the role of FGF 21 -signaling in the beneficial effects of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery (RYGB). Methods: High-fat diet-induced obese FGF 21 -deficient (FGF 21 −/−) and wildtype (WT) mice were subjected to RYGB, sham surgery, or caloric restriction to <b>match</b> <b>body</b> weight of RYGB mice. Body weight, body composition, food intake, energy expenditure, glucose tolerance, and insulin sensitivity, as well as plasma levels and hepatic mRNA expression of FGF 21 were measured. Results: Hepatic expression and plasma levels of FGF 21 are higher after RYGB compared with similar weight loss induced by caloric restriction, suggesting that elevated FGF 21 might play a role in preventing increased hunger and weight regain after RYGB. However, although the body weight differential between RYGB and sham surgery was significantly reduced in FGF 21 −/− mice, RYGB induced similarly sustained body weight and fat mass loss, initial reduction of food intake, increased energy expenditure, and improvements in glycemic control in FGF 21 −/− and WT mice. Conclusions: FGF 21 signaling is not a critical single factor for the beneficial metabolic effects of RYGB. This may open up the possibility to use FGF 21 as adjuvant therapy in patients with ineffective bariatric surgeries...|$|E
40|$|Insulin-mediated glucose {{disposal}} {{is dependent}} on the vasodilator effects of insulin. In type 2 diabetes, insulin-stimulated vasodilation is impaired {{as a result of an}} imbalance in NO and ET- 1 production. We tested the hypothesis that chronic voluntary wheel running (RUN) prevents impairments in insulin-stimulated vasodilation associated with obesity and type 2 diabetes independent of the effects of RUN on adiposity by randomizing Otsuka Long Evans Tokushima Fatty (OLETF) rats, a model of hyperphagia-induced obesity and type 2 diabetes, to 1) RUN, 2) caloric restriction (CR; diet adjusted to <b>match</b> <b>body</b> weights of RUN group), or 3) sedentary control (SED) groups (n = 8 /group) at 4 wk. At 40 wk, NO- and ET- 1 -mediated vasoreactivity to insulin (1 – 1, 000 μIU/ml) was assessed in the presence of a nonselective ET- 1 receptor blocker (tezosentan) or a NO synthase (NOS) inhibitor [NG-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (l-NAME) ], respectively, in second-order arterioles isolated from the white portion of the gastrocnemius muscle. Body weight, fasting plasma glucose, and hemoglobin A 1 c were lower in RUN and CR than SED (P < 0. 05); however, the glucose area under the curve (AUC) following the intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test was lower only in the RUN group (P < 0. 05). Vasodilator responses to all doses of insulin were greater in RUN than SED or CR in the presence of a tezosentan (P < 0. 05), but group differences in vasoreactivity to insulin with coadministration of l-NAME were not observed. We conclude daily wheel running prevents obesity and type 2 diabetes-associated declines in insulin-stimulated vasodilation in skeletal muscle arterioles through mechanisms that appear to be NO mediated and independent of attenuating excess adiposity in hyperphagic rats...|$|E
