5000|$|He {{noted that}} undines {{are similar to}} humans in size, while sylphs are rougher, coarser, longer, and stronger. Gnomes are short, while {{salamanders}} are long, narrow, and lean. The elementals {{are said to be}} able to <b>move</b> <b>through</b> their own elements as human beings <b>move</b> <b>through</b> air. Gnomes, for example, can <b>move</b> <b>through</b> rocks, walls, and soil. Sylphs are the closest to humans in his conception because they <b>move</b> <b>through</b> air like we do, while in fire they burn, in water they drown, and in earth, they get stuck. Paracelsus states that each one stays healthy in its particular [...] "chaos," [...] as he terms it, but dies in the others.|$|R

5|$|The {{most active}} Western Pacific typhoon season was in 1964, when 39storms of {{tropical}} storm strength formed. Only 15 seasons had 30 or more storms developing since reliable records began. The least activity {{seen in the}} northwest Pacific Ocean was during the 2010 Pacific typhoon season, when only 14tropical storms and seven typhoons formed. In the Philippines, the most active season, since 1945, for tropical cyclone strikes was 1993 when nineteen tropical cyclones <b>moved</b> <b>through</b> the country. There was only one tropical cyclone that <b>moved</b> <b>through</b> the Philippines in 1958. The 2004 Pacific typhoon season was the busiest for Okinawa since 1957.

5|$|Typhoon Roy, {{known in}} the Philippines as Typhoon Asiang, was the second-most intense January {{tropical}} cyclone on record in the Western Pacific basin. Forming out of an area of disturbed weather on January 7, 1988, Roy quickly intensified as it <b>moved</b> <b>through</b> the Marshall Islands. By January 9, the storm intensified into a typhoon and attained its peak intensity the following day. At its peak, sustained winds reached 215km/h (135mph). Slight weakening took place before the storm <b>moved</b> <b>through</b> the Mariana Islands. Continuing westward, the system eventually struck the Philippines as a minimal typhoon before dissipating over the South China Sea on January 19.|$|E
5|$|After {{spreading}} across the United States, the remnants <b>moved</b> <b>through</b> Ontario and Quebec, producing hurricane-force wind gusts and 40ft (12m) waves along Lake Ontario. Throughout the lake, 55vessels sunk {{due to the}} storm, resulting in {{tens of thousands of}} dollars in damage. High winds caused power outages and structural damage, as well as destroyed wheat fields across Ontario. In Toronto, the storm killed three people and injured others.|$|E

Heavy rain fell across a few islands and copious lightning was reported. No known damage or loss of life took place.|$|E

5|$|Because of its rapid movement, a {{hurricane}} watch was issued for Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands on December 22. As the storm weakened, the watches were discontinued.

There, the weakening tropical cyclone produced light rainfall, though there was no reported damage.
