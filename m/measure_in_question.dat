The support of an unconstitutional measure may be expedient, but it cannot be denied that it is the most indubitable evidence of confidence. This suggestion, though received with kindness, elicited little sympathy, and Lord George Bentinck, who had not yet spoken, and who always refrained at these meetings from taking that directing part which he never wished to assume, marking the general feeling of those present, and wishing to guide it to a practical result advantageous to their policy, observed that the support of the Coercion Bill by the Protectionists, ought to be made conditional on the government proving the sincerity of their policy by immediately proceeding with their measure; that if life were in such danger in Ireland as was officially stated, and as he was bound to believe, no Corn or Customs' Bill could compete in urgency with the necessity of pressing forward a bill, the object of which was to arrest wholesale assassination. He was, therefore, for giving the government a hearty support, provided they proved they were in earnest in their determination to put down murder and outrage in Ireland, by giving a priority in the conduct of public business to the <b>measure</b> <b>in</b> <b>question.</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{subject of}} discrete-event {{dynamical}} systems {{has taken on}} a new direction with the advent of perturbation analysis (PA), an efficient method for estimating the gradients of a steady-state performance measure, by analyzing data obtained from a single-simulation experiment in the time domain. A crucial issue is whether PA gives strongly consistent estimates, namely, whether average time-domain-based gradients converge, over infinite horizon, to the steady-state gradients. In this paper, we investigate this issue for a queue with a finite buffer capacity and a loss policy. The performance <b>measure</b> <b>in</b> <b>question</b> is the average amount of lost customers, {{as a function of the}} buffer's capacity, which is assumed to be continuous in our work.

40|$|Consistency {{between a}} process and its {{specification}} expressed in CSP is typically {{presented as a}} refinement check.

It is an important, crucial step in various image analysis tasks where multiple data sources are integrated/fused, in order to extract high-level information.

The goal is to search for the "optimal" instance of the transformation model assumed with respect to a similarity <b>measure</b> <b>in</b> <b>question.</b> In this paper we present a novel genetic algorithm (GA) -based approach for IR. Since GA performs effective search in various optimization problems, it could prove useful also for IR. Indeed, various GAs have been proposed for IR.

In contrast, we present a generalized GA-based solution for an almost fully affine transformation model, which achieves competitive results without such limitations using a two-phase method and a multi-objective optimization (MOO) approach.
