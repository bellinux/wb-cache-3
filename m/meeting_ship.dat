50|$|The Galveston Movement, {{also known}} as the Galveston Plan, was a U.S. {{immigration}} assistance program operated by several Jewish organizations between 1907 and 1914. The program worked to divert Jewish immigrants, fleeing Russia and eastern Europe, away from East Coast cities, particularly New York, which was already crowded with these poverty-stricken immigrants. During its operation, ten thousand Jewish immigrants passed through the port of Galveston, Texas, about a third the number that emigrated to Palestine during the same period. New York financier and philanthropist Jacob Schiff was {{the driving force behind the}} effort, which he supported with nearly $500,000 of his personal fortune. B'nai Israel's Rabbi Henry Cohen was the humanitarian face of the movement, <b>meeting</b> <b>ships</b> at the Galveston docks and helping guide the immigrants through the cumbersome arrival and distribution process, and on into the countryside.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT>NScheduling {{logistics}} {{operations in}} a multi-echelon production system requires planning and coordination {{of production and}} transpor-tation decisions. In this paper we show how these decisions {{can be made in}} an economical manner for a real situation involving a) limited capacity production lines in an automotive component plant, b) a A limited shipping capability at the component plant, and c) <b>meeting</b> <b>shipping</b> requirements on time for several automobile assembly plants over the planning horizon. "The nature of the production process and the rail car loading facility allow an aggregation of decisions concerning products to decisions concerning rail car units, reducing substantially the dimen-sionality of the problem. The resulting model is a special case of a multi-commodity network flow problem. A two-phase heuristic solution procedure is developed, first for weekly aggregate demand and then for shift-by-shift aggregate demand within {{the first week of the}} horizon. Finally, the straight-forward details of disaggregating into production and shipping schedules for products are presented. TN 13 aaes-eat...|$|R
