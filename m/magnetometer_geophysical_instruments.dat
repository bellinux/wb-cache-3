50|$|Pratt {{also played}} a {{prominent}} role in the scientific progress of his profession. As early as 1922, others were using <b>geophysical</b> <b>instruments</b> experimentally on the Texas Gulf Coast as a new method for finding salt domes. After studying results from this work, Pratt concluded that Humble should use <b>geophysical</b> <b>instruments</b> and methods. In line with these recommendations, in 1924, Humble set up a geophysics group and established a shop in Houston for geophysics research and development, and the manufacture of a refraction seismograph recording in the field.|$|R

40|$|Geophysical {{methods are}} often used to aid in {{exploration}} for safe and abundant groundwater. In particular resistivity and seismic refraction methods are helpful in determining depth to bedrock and zones of saturation in the subsurface. However the expense of these instruments ($ 5000 to $ 20, 000) has resulted in their limited use in developing countries. This paper describes how to construct these devices for less than $ 250 each. The instruments are small, light and robust and are as useful for groundwater exploration as the commercial models for shallow aquifers (less than 35 m deep) where wells can be hand dug, augured or drilled with small portable drill rigs. Data interpretation can be accomplished quickly in the field with free software implemented on a laptop computer. A suite of <b>geophysical</b> <b>instruments</b> and software can therefore be assembled for less than $ 850. This paper gives the design for these instruments and essential information needed to use them. It is hoped that these inexpensive <b>geophysical</b> <b>instruments</b> can be widely distributed among drillers and aid workers in developing countries, improving the success rate of water wells...|$|R

30|$|Volcanic unrest of Hakone volcano {{seems to}} be {{triggered}} by magma replenishment to the deep magma chamber and by pore pressure increase in the hydrothermal system beneath the volcano. Geophysical observations around the eruption center imply that the 2015 eruption took place owing {{to the formation of}} an open crack that reached near to the ground surface 5  h before the onset of ash fall. After the crack formation, fluid discharge from the source crater likely occurred before the ash emission. However, no signals associated with the ash fall or fluid discharge was observed by <b>geophysical</b> <b>instruments.</b>|$|R

40|$|A {{geophysical}} survey has traced some {{remnants of the}} earthen fortifications at the Petersburg battlefield; these earthworks were constructed during the U. S. Civil War in 1864 {{in the state of}} Virginia. Trenches and pits that were dug during the year-long battle were revealed by several <b>geophysical</b> <b>instruments.</b> After the battle at Petersburg, some of the fortifications were leveled so that those areas could be farmed once again; those earthworks are now invisible at the surface and it is these fortifications that were explored with this {{geophysical survey}}. Most of the now-refilled ditches and holes that were dug during the battle were detected; however, almost nothing of the parapets (earthen ridges) was revealed, for the soil from those ridges had been removed in order to fill the ditches. During this geophysical survey, detailed maps were made with many different <b>geophysical</b> <b>instruments</b> and techniques; this test revealed the density of buried features and showed the capabilities of the different methods. The suitability of the different geophysical techniques was as follows (in decreasing order of success) : Ground-penetrating radar, resistivity (mapping and pseudosections), electromagnetic induction (conductivity and susceptibility), magnetic (total field and gradient), seismic refraction, self-potential, and finally, aerial photography. This summary emphasizes the findings of the surveys that were done with a ground-penetrating radar and a magnetometer. Several factors simplified this survey and made it successful: Most of the ground's surface is covered by grass (it was easy to walk in the area of survey); the area has been a park for over fifty years (there is relatively little modern trash); and the natural stratigraphy of the soil is simple and it changes through archaeological depths (refilled holes, with their altered stratigraphy, were readily detected). Because of these favorable factors, the success of this survey was probably in the top ten percent of all surveys that might be done...|$|R

Four instruments are envisioned: (1) a Laser-Induced Breakdown Spectrometer (LIBS) for geochemical analysis at ranges up to 100 m, capable of operating in three different modes; (2) a combined x-ray fluorescence and x-ray diffraction (XRF/XRD) instrument for elemental and mineralogic analysis of acquired samples; (3) a mass spectrometer system for stepwise heating analysis of gases released from acquired samples; and (4) a <b>geophysical</b> <b>instrument</b> package for subsurface mapping of structures such as lava tubes...|$|R
50|$|Geophysical {{survey is}} used to create maps of {{subsurface}} archaeological features. Features are the non-portable part of the archaeological record, whether standing structures or traces of human activities left in the soil. <b>Geophysical</b> <b>instruments</b> can detect buried features when their physical properties contrast measurably with their surroundings. In some cases individual artifacts, especially metal, may be detected as well. Readings taken in a systematic pattern become a data set that can be rendered as image maps. Survey results {{can be used to}} guide excavation and to give archaeologists insight into the patterning of non-excavated parts of the site. Unlike other archaeological methods, geophysical survey is neither invasive nor destructive. For this reason, it is often used where preservation (rather than excavation) is the goal, and to avoid disturbance of culturally sensitive sites such as cemeteries.|$|R
40|$|Geophysical {{surveying}} around Building E 5032 {{using three}} new continuously recording <b>geophysical</b> <b>instruments</b> - {{two types of}} electromagnetic induction instruments and a cesium vapor magnetometer that were unavailable {{at the time of}} the original survey - has provided additional information for defining the location of buried debris, vaults, tanks, and the drainage/sump system near the building. The dominant geophysical signature around Building E 5032 consists of a complex pattern of linear magnetic, electrical-conductivity, and electromagnetic field anomalies that appear to be associated with drainage/sewer systems, ditches, past railway activity, the location for Building T 5033 (old number 99 A), and the probable location of Building 91.

However, its size (20 km diameter) and age (about 23 my) make close-up geologic examination in a limited field season difficult because of erosion of the wall surface as well as backfall from the original impact, which has substantially re-filled the crater.

5000|$|Data {{collection}} is broadly similar {{regardless of the}} particular sensing instrument. Survey usually involves walking with the instrument along closely spaced parallel traverses, taking readings at regular intervals. In most cases, the area to be surveyed is staked {{into a series of}} square or rectangular survey [...] "grids" [...] (terminology can vary). With the corners of the grids as known reference points, the instrument operator uses tapes or marked ropes as a guide when collecting data. In this way, positioning error can be kept to within a few centimeters for high-resolution mapping. Survey systems with integrated global positioning systems (GPS) have been developed, but under field conditions, currently available systems lack sufficient precision for high-resolution archaeological mapping. <b>Geophysical</b> <b>instruments</b> (notably metal detectors) may also used for less formally [...] "scanning" [...] areas of interest.|$|R
