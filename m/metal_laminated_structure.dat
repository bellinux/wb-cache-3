The results of burst pressure with respect to time showed four types of behaviour viz, elastic, elasto-plastic, peak and failure, irrespective of the type of fiber and thickness of fiber reinforced polymer (FRP).

40|$|The recent {{application}} of Glass Reinforced Aluminium (Glare) in the Airbus A 380 {{has proven to}} be a suitable candidate to replace metal structures. The reduction in weight and increased performance results in lower emissions and cost reduction. Therefore research has been performed at the Delft University of Technology, dedicated to the residual strength of fibre <b>metal</b> <b>laminates.</b> This has resulted in reliable prediction methods for flat structures. However in practise these structures are reinforced, to be able to support the loads present in aircraft, while minimising mass. The addition of these local reinforcement features has revealed interesting residual strength characteristics. It was observed that these structures may possess the ability to arrest unstable crack growth, when damaged, which is of great interest for the analysis of damage tolerance aircraft structures. Currently no simple prediction method is available, giving insight in the crack growth characteristics and enabling crack growth predictions in the early design phase. Therefore the objective of this thesis is to predict the damage arrest capabilities of stiffened structures in a simplified manner. Based on the literature study it was observed that the current understanding of fibre <b>metal</b> <b>laminate</b> stiffened <b>structures</b> was insufficient for predicting the fracture mechanics of built-up structures. Therefore the available linear elastic fracture mechanics for metal structures is modified to account for plasticity and stiffeners ahead of the crack-tip, by assuming isostrain conditions. As result, the stress intensity reduction factor is successfully implemented, incorporating the presence of a stiffener in combination with the Irwin plasticity correction method. This configuration results in accurate crack growth predictions for residual strength data obtained from literature. The model verification is expanded with experimental test results to validate the crackarrest capabilities of a stiffened structure. Therefore four test samples were tested and analysed, representing the different stages of the residual strength diagram. Based on the test results some difference were obtained in the model, which can be appointed to the negligence of stiffener yielding and stiffener effect on the plastic zone growth. Nevertheless a residual strength has been predicted within 7. 5 % of the experimental data. Finally it is concluded that the model is able to predict the crack growth characteristics of a stiffened structure in a simplified manner for both metal and fibre <b>metal</b> <b>laminates.</b> Design and Production of Composite StructuresMechanics, Aerospace Structures & MaterialsAerospace Engineerin...|$|R

The geometry of the element is described by sixteen nodes which are located {{at the top and}} the bottom surface of the element. At each node three translational degrees of freedom are defined. Additionally, four internal degrees of freedom are assumed to improve the description of the internal stretching.

A projectile of hemispherical {{head with a}} diameter of 36. 5 mm was used to impact the fibre <b>metal</b> <b>laminate</b> panels. Three types of woven fibre fabrics (Basalt, S 2 -glass and Kevlar- 29) were used to reinforce the aluminum sheets.

40|$|Cold {{expansion}} {{has proven}} to be an effective technique for extending the fatigue life of monolithic materials. Although fiber <b>metal</b> <b>laminate</b> materials show improved fatigue performance compared to their monolithic counterparts, the nucleation and growth of small cracks tends to occur early on in the fatigue life of the material, making acceptance of fiber <b>metal</b> <b>laminates</b> in aerospace more difficult. This work examined whether cold expansion could delay this process in fiber <b>metal</b> <b>laminates</b> and increase the fatigue life of these materials at the same time. The results showed that significant differences existed in the residual strain field between the mandrel exit and entry faces resulting in slower fatigue crack growth on the exit face, which also had higher residual strains in the region surrounding the cold expanded hole. Overall, cold expansion is effective at increasing the fatigue life of fiber <b>metal</b> <b>laminate</b> materials, but is less effective at delaying nucleation and growth of small cracks on the entry face.
