However, both cnidarians and ctenophores are <b>more</b> <b>complex</b> <b>than</b> sponges as they have: cells bound by inter-cell {{connections}} and carpet-like basement membranes; muscles; nervous systems; and some have sensory organs. Cnidarians are distinguished from all other animals by having cnidocytes that fire like harpoons and are used mainly to capture prey. In some species, cnidocytes {{can also be used}} as anchors.|$|E

5|$|Ctenophores form {{an animal}} phylum that is <b>more</b> <b>complex</b> <b>than</b> sponges, about {{as complex as}} cnidarians (jellyfish, sea anemones, etc.), and less complex than bilaterians (which include almost all other animals). Unlike sponges, both ctenophores and cnidarians have: cells bound by inter-cell {{connections}} and carpet-like basement membranes; muscles; nervous systems; and some have sensory organs. Ctenophores are distinguished from all other animals by having colloblasts, which are sticky and adhere to prey, although a few ctenophore species lack them.|$|E

5|$|Sonatas and Interludes is a {{collection}} of twenty pieces for prepared piano by American avant-garde composer John Cage (1912–1992). It was composed in 1946–48, shortly after Cage's introduction to Indian philosophy and the teachings of art historian Ananda K. Coomaraswamy, both of which became major influences on the composer's later work. Significantly <b>more</b> <b>complex</b> <b>than</b> his other works for prepared piano, Sonatas and Interludes is generally recognized as one of Cage's finest achievements.|$|E

5|$|The classic view {{describes}} a solitary hunter, ranging the oceans {{in search of}} food. However, this applies to only a few species.

Even solitary sharks meet for breeding or at rich hunting grounds, which may lead them to cover thousands of miles in a year. Shark migration patterns may be even <b>more</b> <b>complex</b> <b>than</b> in birds, with many sharks covering entire ocean basins.|$|E

The decorations were <b>more</b> <b>complex</b> <b>than</b> the earlier Islamic forms and more carefully adapted to structural constraints. The imposing architecture and decoration of Fatimid buildings {{such as the}} al-Hakim mosque provided a backdrop that supported the dual role of the Fatimid caliph as both religious and political leader.|$|E

Attempts to designate only the Hinomaru as the national flag by the DPJ and other parties during the vote of the bill were rejected by the Diet. The House of Representatives passed the bill on July 22, 1999, by a 403 to 86 vote. The legislation {{was sent to the}} House of Councilors on July 28 and was passed on August 9.

5|$|The {{motion of}} the Moon can be {{measured}} accurately, and is noticeably <b>more</b> <b>complex</b> <b>than</b> that of the planets. The ancient Greek astronomers, Hipparchus and Ptolemy, had noted several periodic variations in the Moon's orbit, such as small oscillations in its orbital eccentricity and the inclination of its orbit to {{the plane of the}} ecliptic. These oscillations generally occur on a once-monthly or twice-monthly time-scale. The line of its apses precesses gradually with a period of roughly 8.85 years, while its line of nodes turns a full circle in roughly double that time, 18.6 years. This accounts for the roughly 18-year periodicity of eclipses, the so-called Saros cycle. However, both lines experience small fluctuations in their motion, again on the monthly time-scale.|$|E
5|$|The musical {{style of}} The Book of Taliesyn {{is a mix}} of {{progressive}} rock, psychedelic rock and hard rock and different observers think that in this album the band is more mature and in greater control of its own means of expression. Critics highlight how the compositions are generally longer and <b>more</b> <b>complex</b> <b>than</b> in their debut album. Deep Purple biographer Dave Thompson writes that a dark mood permeates The Book of Taliesyn with little indulgence to pop rock, citing influences of the American band The Doors in the original tracks written for this album.|$|E
