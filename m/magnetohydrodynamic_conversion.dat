Experimental measurements of electron temperature, and ionization and recombination rates are presented for partially ionized plasmas of potassium-seeded argon. Experimental conditions were chosen to cover those ranges of interest in connection with proposed <b>magnetohydrodynamic</b> energy <b>conversion</b> devices for which nonequilibrium electrical conductivity measurements have been previously reported, e. g., translational atom temperatures of about 2000 °K, total atom densities near 10 ^(18) /cm^ 3, potassium densities of about 10 ^(16) /cm^ 3, electron densities from 10 ^(13) /cm^ 3 to 10 ^(15) /cm^ 3, and electron temperatures from 2200 to 3500 °K. Measured values of electron-electron-ion recombination coefficients for potassium show good agreement with theoretical values based upon the Gryzinski classical inelastic-collision cross-section expressions.

40|$|<b>Magnetohydrodynamic</b> (MHD) energy <b>conversion</b> {{consists}} of electrical energy generation directly from high enthalpy of ionized gas. MHD generators are devices having a channel in which ionized gas (plasma) is blown, where a high magnetic field is present. The {{interaction between the}} conductive gas and the magnetic field makes the conversion. To describe and to design the MHD plants, circuital models of MHD generators are advantageous for an easier investigation approach to the interface between generators and power plants; they become extremely useful when a 3 -D analysis is necessary for easier computation taking into account 3 -D effects due to spatial distribution of electromagnetic fields. In this paper we describe some design applications of the three-dimensional (3 -D) lumped parameter model for MHD generators...|$|R
40|$|Nuclear-based <b>magnetohydrodynamic</b> (MHD) energy <b>conversion</b> {{has been}} pursued {{in various forms}} since the 1950 's. The {{majority}} of this work was motivated by the compatibility of MHD generators with the high temperature achievable with a nuclear reactor and the associated potential for very high cycle efficiency. As {{a result of this}} perspective, methods for enhancing the electrical conductivity of the MHD flow have primarily focused on traditional thermal ionization processes, especially those utilizing alkali metal seeds. However, electrical conductivity enhancement via thermal interactions imposes significant limitations on the flow expansion through the generator, and hence on the ultimate power density. Furthermore, the introduction of an alkali metal seed into the flow significantly complicates the engineering design and increases the potential for system failures due to plating of the evaporated metal on cold surfaces...|$|R
40|$|This is {{the final}} report for a one-year, Laboratory-Directed Research and Development (LDRD) project at the Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL). The continual need for more efficient, {{high-output}} energy conversion techniques has renewed interest in nuclear-driven <b>magnetohydrodynamic</b> (MHD) energy <b>conversion.</b> To provide the fundamental knowledge required to evaluate the potential value of this concept, a one-year project aimed at measuring the nuclear-induced electrical conductivity of a {sup 3 }He/{sup 4 }He gas mixture under thermodynamic conditions consistent with the MHD flow conditions was carried out.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} the <b>magnetohydrodynamic</b> (MHD) <b>conversion</b> {{of the energy}} released during the planetary entry phase of an interplanetary vehicle trajectory. The effect of MHD conversion is multi-fold. It reduces and redirects heat transferred to the vehicle, and regenerates the dissipated energy in reusable and transportable form. A vehicle on an interplanetary mission carries about 10, 000 kWh of kinetic energy per ton of its mass. This energy is dissipated into heat during the planetary atmospheric entry phase. For instance, the kinetic energy of Mars Pathfinder was about 4220 kWh. Based on the loss in velocity, Mars Pathfinder lost about 92. 5 % of that energy during the plasma-sustaining entry phase that is approximately 3900 kWh. An ideal MHD generator, distributed over the probe surface of Mars Pathfinder could convert more than 2000 kWh of this energy loss into electrical energy, which correspond to more than 50 % of the kinetic energy loss. That means that the heat transferred to the probe surface can be reduced by at least 50 % if the converted energy is adequately stored, or re-radiated, or directly used. Therefore, MHD conversion could act not only as the power generating, but also as the cooling process. In this paper we describe results of preliminary experiments with light and microwave emitters powered by model magnetohydrodynamic generators and discuss method for direct use of converted energy...|$|R
40|$|<b>Magnetohydrodynamic</b> (MHD) energy <b>conversion</b> {{systems of}} the pulsed laser-supported {{detonation}} (LSD) wave, plasma MHD, and liquid-metal MHD (LMMHD) types are assessed for their potential as space-based laser-to-electrical power converters. These systems offer several advantages as energy converters relative to the present chemical, nuclear, and solar devices, including high conversion efficiency, simple design, high-temperature operation, high power density, and high reliability. Of these systems, the Brayton cycle liquid-metal MHD system {{appears to be the}} most attractive. The LMMHD technology base is well established for terrestrial applications, particularly with regard to the generator, mixer, and other system components. However, further research is required to extend this technology base to space applications and to establish the technology required to couple the laser energy into the system most efficiently. Continued research on each of the three system types is recommended...|$|R
40|$|Prospects for a low {{specific}} mass multi-megawatt nuclear space power plant were examined assuming closed cycle coupling of a high-temperature fission reactor with <b>magnetohydrodynamic</b> (MHD) energy <b>conversion</b> and utilization of a nonequilibrium helium/xenon frozen inert plasma (FIP). Critical evaluation of performance attributes and {{specific mass}} characteristics {{was based on}} a comprehensive systems analysis assuming a reactor operating temperature of 1800 K for a range of subsystem mass properties. Total plant efficiency was expected to be 55. 2 % including plasma pre-ionization power, and the effects of compressor stage number, regenerator efficiency and radiation cooler temperature on plant efficiency were assessed. Optimal specific mass characteristics were found to be dependent on overall power plant scale with 3 kg/kWe being potentially achievable at a net electrical power output of 1 -MWe. This figure drops to less than 2 kg/kWe when power output exceeds 3 MWe. Key technical issues include identification of effective methods for non-equilibrium pre-ionization and achievement of frozen inert plasma conditions within the MHD generator channel. A three-phase research and development strategy is proposed encompassing Phase-I Proof of Principle Experiments, a Phase-II Subscale Power Generation Experiment, and a Phase-III Closed-Loop Prototypical Laboratory Demonstration Test...|$|R
40|$|The use of <b>magnetohydrodynamic</b> (MHD) power <b>conversion</b> systems, {{potentially}} {{coupled with}} a fission power source, is currently being investigated as a driver for an advanced propulsion system, such as a plasma thruster. The efficiency of a MHD generator {{is strongly dependent on}} the electrical conductivity of the fluid that passes through the generator; power density increases as fluid conductivity increases. Although traditional MHD flows depend on thermal ionization to enhance the electrical conductivity, ionization due to nuclear interactions may achieve a comparable or improved conductivity enhancement while avoiding many of the limitations inherent to thermal ionization. Calculations suggest that nuclear-enhanced electrical conductivity increases as the neutron flux increases; conductivity of pure He- 3 greater than 10 mho/m may be achievable if exposed to a flux greater than 10 (exp 12) neutrons/cm 2 /s.) However, this remains to be demonstrated experimentally. An experimental facility has been constructed at the Propulsion Research Center at the NASA Marshall Space Flight Center, using helium as the test fluid. High energy electrons will be used to simulate the effects of neutron-induced ionization of helium gas to produce a plasma. These experiments will be focused on diagnosis of the plasma in a virtually static system; results will be applied to future tests with a MHD system. Initial experiments will utilize a 50 keV electron gun that can operate at up to a current of 200 micro A. Spreading the electron beam over a four inch diameter window results in an electron flux of 1. 5 x 10 (exp 13) e/sq cm/s. The equivalent neutron flux that would produce the same ionization fraction in helium is 1 x 10 (exp 12) n/sq cm/s. Experiments will simulate the neutron generated plasma modeled by Bitteker, which takes into account the products of thermal neutron absorption in He- 3, and includes various ion species in estimating the conductivity of the resulting plasma. Several different probes will be designed and implemented to verify the plasma kinetics model. System parameters and estimated operating ranges are summarized. The predicted ionization fraction, electron density, and conductivity levels are provided in for an equivalent neutron flux of 1 x 10 (exp 12) n/cm 2 /s. Understanding the complex plasma kinetics throughout a MHD channel is necessary to design an optimal power conversion system for space propulsion applications. The proposed experiments seek to fully characterize the helium plasma and to determine the reliability of each measurement technique, such that they may be applied to more advanced MHD studies. The expected value of each plasma parameter determined from theoretical models will be verified experimentally by several independent techniques to determine the most reliable method of obtaining each parameter. The results of these experiments will be presented in the final paper...|$|R
