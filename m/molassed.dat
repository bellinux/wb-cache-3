This study investigated the kinetic and efficiency of <b>molass</b> dye removal and mineralization in the yeast wastewater using nanocomposite catalysts in ozonation process. Materials and methods: The catalytic ozonation process (COP) of colored effluent of biological treatment of yeast production factory was carried out using semi-continuous flow cylindrical reactor and the effects of operational parameters such as initial pH value (4 - 10) and reaction time (5 - 60 min) on removal efficiency of dye and mineralization were investigated. After determining the kinetic parameters of reaction, the effects of some other parameters such as adsorption and reuse of the catalyst were calculated and the efficiency was compared with single ozonation process (SOP) and granular carbon as catalyst. Results: The removal efficiency of dye of <b>molass</b> factories effluent and its kinetic, at the condition of initial dye concentration 4521 ADMI, catalyst concentration 2 g/L and 60 min reaction time were 95 and 0. 045 min- 1, respectively; while these parameters in SOP and granular activated carbon as catalyst were 71 with 0. 018 min- 1 and 86 with 0. 028 min- 1, respectively. But, the mineralization and its kinetic in COP were 74 and 0. 023 min- 1, respectively, in which initial TOC was decreased from 510 mg/L to 132 mg/L. Conclusion: The nanocomposite was found to have the best efficiency in dye degradation and TOC removal and it is easy to recover and reuse over and over by magnet. The main mechanism of dye degradation in COP was chemical oxidation and less occurred by adsorption. © 2016, Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences. All rights reserved...|$|R

Pigs were slaughtered at around 160 kg live weight. The main qualitative parameters of carcasses, meat (pH and colour) and fat (fatty acid composition) were collected. Pigs receiving pressed beet pulp showed a significant (P < 0. 05) improvement of the weight of the gastrointestinal tract, inducing a slight reduction of the dressing out percentage in comparison with control animals. Back fat thickness and muscle percentage did not differ depending on the diet; these parameters were significantly (P < 0. 01) affected only by the sex of the animals. Similarly, the yield of the lean and fatty cuts was not affected by the diets, the significant differences (P < 0. 01) being exclusively related to the different hormonal status of the entire females and castrated males.

40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} energy source and protein level of diets on milk protein content, 12 multiparous Holstein-Friesian cows were used in a 4 ? 4 Latin square change-over experiment with 4 -week periods. Four diets were offered, with ad libitum silage as proportionately 0 ? 40 of the diet, and the remaining 0 ? 60 as one of four concentrates, two based on barley and two on <b>molassed</b> sugar-beet pulp. Two protein levels were achieved by altering the amounts of digestible undegraded protein in the concentrates, with all diets formulated to supply equal quantities of rumen degradable protein. There was no effect of diet on dry-matter intakes. Both starch and high dietary protein levels significantly increased milk protein concentration (P < 0 ? 05), but had no effects on milk fat and lactose concentrations. Mean milk yields were significantly higher (P < 0 ? 05) with increased dietary protein. Dietary protein significantly affected the yields of milk protein (P < 0 ? 01) and lactose (P < 0 ? 05) but not that of fat. Urinary allantoin excretion was significantly greater with both high protein (P < 0 ? 05) and starch-based diets (P < 0 ? 05). No significant interaction effects were found.

With the exception of MSBS and a control (C 2), all silages were ensiled with formic acid solution. Unmolassed sugar beet shreds were also ensiled with a granulated formic acid product (grFA). The silages were fed to 56 Finnish Landrace lambs for 21 days. Silage effluent retention rates were similar (1. 44 - 1. 55 kg kg - 1 absorbent) for the sugar beet shred-based absorbents but zero for RB. The organic matter digestibilities of the diets were not affected (p> 0. 05) by the silage absorbent treatment. The digestibility of SBS silage was, however, improved by grFA as an additive. Silage intake was generally increased by absorbent inclusion, and was about 29 % higher in lambs receiving silages treated with sugar beet shreds than in those receiving untreated silages. The daily growth rate of lambs was highest with the SBS treatment (124 g) followed by SBS ensiled with grFA (108 g) and MSBS (86 g); it was lowest with RB (36 g).

40|$|The {{objectives}} of the project were {{to determine the effects}} of dietary crude protein intake, on blood concentrations of ammonia and urea and on fertility, and on the possible biological mechanisms involved. Heifers were used in all experiments in order to avoid any confounding effects of lactation and, or, negative energy balance. The results are summarised as follows. • • • • 5 Blood urea and ammonia increased linearly with increases in dietary urea. Fermentable carbohydrate, in the form of <b>molassed</b> sugar beet pulp (MSBP), was more effective than barley in reducing blood urea concentration. Plasma ammonia concentrations were more variable but MSBP was again more effective than barley in reducing these. Embryo survival rate was not affected by either dietary crude protein (CP) or fermentable energy intake irrespective of whether animals were fed a silage diet supplemented with feed grade urea or were grazing pasture with a high crude protein content. Despite generating systemic urea concentrations of up to 25 mmol/L and systemic ammonia concentrations of up to 242 μmol/L no significant relationship between these parameters and embryo survival rate was established. Consistent with these results on embryo survival, elevated blood urea or ammonia had little effect on the biochemical composition of oviduct fluid, the environment of the early developing embryo. It can be concluded that elevations in systemic concentrations of ammonia or urea per se, particularly of the magnitude observed under normal feeding conditions, are unlikely to impair embryo survival in cattle as a consequence of disruptions to the oviductal environment.

The control treatment (C) consisted of pasture alone. For the other two treatments, cows were fed 4 kg per day of either a concentrate supplement consisting of barley (B) or a treatment (M) containing (g/kg) barley (200), oats (200), wheat bran (220), wheat (110), wheat syrup (60) and <b>molassed</b> sugar beet pulp (200). The {{experiment was}} carried out as a replicated (n= 5) 3 × 3 Latin square design. The grazing area was divided into 15 paddocks and cows were grazed on a 1 to 2 -day rotation. There was no treatment effect on rumen pH but the molar proportion of acetic acid in rumen fluid was higher (p< 0. 05) in cows grazing pasture alone (C). Ammonia N concentration was lower for M than B (p< 0. 01). Concentrate supplementation increased milk yield (p< 0. 001), the extent of which was greater for M than B (2. 6 versus 1. 3 kg per day; p< 0. 05). Protein yields increased (p< 0. 001) due to treatments B (51 g per day) and M (115 g per day).

Total gas pool size increased linearly (P&# 60; 0. 05) with increasing level of SB substitution of lucerne, with values ranging from 148 to 281  ml. Mathematical analysis of the cumulative gas production curves showed significant differences in the fermentation patterns of these feeds (P&# 60; 0. 001). Rate parameter values; fractional rate of degradation (FRGP) and time taken to produce 50 or 95 % of the total gas production (T 50 and T 95, respectively) were all improved by SB addition, which was particularly notable at lower levels of SB substitution (ASB 1 and ASB 2). Moreover, ASB 1 and ASB 2 produced rate parameters similar to those observed in bottles containing SB alone. In conclusion, the addition of SB to lucerne at levels of up to 400  mg g− 1 dry matter (DM) inclusion appears to significantly increase the rate at which Lucerne is degraded, which has important implications for the overall energy balance in the horse. Furthermore, the gas production technique appears to be a valuable tool for evaluating fibrous feedstuffs and feedstuff combinations, such as lucerne and SB, for equids in vitro, allowing the kinetics of degradation to be studied as opposed to end-point data...|$|E

Herbage from a timothy (Phleum pratense) sward was precision chopped and treated with a formic acid based additive (3 l/t grass). Units of 50 kg grass, without or with 2. 5 kg BP were randomly allocated among four replicates on each of seven treatments. The treatments were (1) no BP (NONE), (2) BP evenly mixed through the grass (EVEN), (3) BP evenly mixed through the lower 25 kg grass (LOWH), (4) BP evenly mixed through the lower 12. 5 kg grass (LOWQ), (5) 0. 625 kg BP mixed through the top 25 kg grass and 1. 875 kg SBP mixed through the lower 25 kg grass (25 / 75), (6) BP placed in 0. 5 kg layers beneath each 10 kg grass (LAYR), and (7) BP placed in a single layer under all of the grass (BOTM). Laboratory silos were filled and sealed, and stored at 15 °C for 163 days. Effluent was collected and weighed from each silo throughout the ensilage period. At opening, silage composition and aerobic stability measurements were made. Total outflow of effluent was reduced (P< 0. 001) by the addition of BP; LAYR had a greater effect (P< 0. 001) {{than any of the other}} treatments. Effluent dry matter (DM) concentration was highest (P< 0. 05) for BOTM and lowest (P< 0. 01) for NONE. All treatments underwent similar lactic-acid dominant fermentations.

Conversely, mathematical analysis of the cumulative gas production curves showed significantly different rates of fermentation in bottles containing ground substrates compared to unprocessed feedstuffs (P&# 60; 0. 001). Rate parameter values, fractional rate of degradation (FRGP) and time taken to produce 50 or 95 % of the total gas production (T 50 and T 95, respectively) were all increased (P&# 60; 0. 001) by grinding the substrates in both experiments. In experiment 2, total volatile fatty acid (TVFA) concentration in the culture fluid post-fermentation was also higher (P&# 60; 0. 001) in bottles containing U material compared to G (82. 9  mmol/l vs. 64. 0  mmol/l, respectively), with a marked change in the molar proportions of volatile fatty acids (VFA) present, with bottles containing G material containing more propionate and less acetate compared to the U substrates. In conclusion, particle size has a marked effect on the rate of substrate fermentation and TVFA concentration and VFA composition of the culture fluid, which has important implications for predicting in vivo digestibility from in vitro digestibility measurements; therefore, further work is required to determine optimal particle size of substrates evaluated in vitro using equine faecal inocula...|$|E
40|$|Comparison of sugar-beet {{pulp and}} barley {{with and without}} soya bean meal as {{supplements}} to silage for growing steers M. G. Keane† Teagasc, Grange Research Centre, Dunsany, Co. Meath The optimum live-weight gain for growing steers in winter depends {{on the cost of}} feed and subsequent compensatory growth. The objectives of this experiment were: (1) to determine the response in growing steers to increasing levels of <b>molassed</b> sugar-beet pulp (MSBP) as a supplement to grass silage, (2) to compare MSBP and barley, and (3) to ascertain if there was a response to the inclusion of soya bean meal as a protein source with both MSBP and barley. Weanling steers (n = 154) were assigned to the fol-lowing treatments: (1) silage only, (2) silage plus a low level of MSBP, (3) silage plus a low level of MSBP plus soya bean meal, (4) silage plus a high level of MSBP, (5) silage plus a high level of MSBP plus soya bean meal, (6) silage plus a high level of barley, and (7) silage plus a high level of barley plus soya bean meal. Low MSBP, high MSBP and barley levels were 1. 5 kg, 3. 0 kg and 3. 0 kg per head daily, respectively. Where soya bean meal was included it replaced 0. 2 kg/day (low) or 0. 4 kg/day (high) of MSBP or barley. The duration of the treatments was 125 days (winter) after which the animals grazed together for 148 days. Silage intake decreased linearly (P < 0. 001) with increas-ing MSBP level. Addition of soya bean meal had no effect on silage intake with low MSBP or barley but increased (P < 0. 05) intake with high MSBP. Live-weight gain increased both linearly (P < 0. 001) and quadratically (P < 0. 01) with increasing MSBP. There was a significant live-weight response to the addition of soya bean meal which was greater at the high than at the low MSBP level and was greater for MSBP than barley. Across all treatments, growth rate at pasture was inversely related to growth rate in winter. Final live weights for the treatments as listed were 376, 395, 411...|$|E
40|$|Fifty {{primiparous}} Finnish Ayrshire cows {{were used}} in 2 _ 2 factorial study. The factors were the protein-feeding strategy: constant (cCP) or variable (vCP) protein content in concentrate during lactation {{and the use of}} a commercial health product from 2 weeks pre- to 8 weeks postpartum. On treatment cCP, the CP content of the concentrate was 180 g/kg in dry matter (DM) throughout the lactation, and on vCP treatment, the CP content was 210, 180 and 150 g/kg DM during lactation days 0 - 100, 101 - 200 and 201 - 305, respectively. The concentrate blends included barley, oats, rapeseed meal, <b>molassed</b> sugar beet pulp and minerals and vitamins. Grass silage and ensiled wet sugar beet pulp (100 g/kg DM in TMR) were used as forage. The forage-toconcentrate ratio in TMR was 55 : 45 on both treatments. The experimental period was 305 days of the first lactation. The average daily milk yield (cCP: 26. 3 kg/day vs. vCP: 27. 5 kg/day) was higher (Pb 0. 05) when feeding concentrate with decreasing protein content, but the effect was not seen in an energy-corrected milk (cCP: 28. 1 kg/day vs. vCP: 29. 0 kg/day). Milk composition was not affected by the protein-feeding strategy. Protein-feeding strategy had no effect on DM intake (cCP: 18. 5 kg/day vs. vCP: 18. 9 kg/day). The efficiency of CP utilization (milk protein/CP intake) was higher (0. 327 vs. 0. 301; Pb 0. 05) on vCP treatment during the last 100 days of lactation, but during the first 200 days of lactation, no significant difference was found. The average efficiency of CP utilization throughout the lactation was 0. 32 with no difference between treatments. The protein-feeding strategy had no effect on the development of body condition scores of the cows. In midlactation, the cows on cCP treatment gained more weight than the cows on vCP treatment. The health product had no significant effect on production or feed intake. The results suggest that only small benefits can be obtained from feeding TMR to primiparous cows differing in CP content at various stages of lactation. v 2005 o...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this experiment was to quantify {{the effects of the}} degree of mixing of dry <b>molassed</b> sugar beet pulp (BP) with grass on silage conservation characteristics. Herbage from a timothy (Phleum pratense) sward was precision chopped and treated with a formic acid based additive (3 l/t grass). Units of 50 kg grass, without or with 2. 5 kg BP were randomly allocated among four replicates on each of seven treatments. The treatments were (1) no BP (NONE), (2) BP evenly mixed through the grass (EVEN), (3) BP evenly mixed through the lower 25 kg grass (LOWH), (4) BP evenly mixed through the lower 12. 5 kg grass (LOWQ), (5) 0. 625 kg BP mixed through the top 25 kg grass and 1. 875 kg SBP mixed through the lower 25 kg grass (25 / 75), (6) BP placed in 0. 5 kg layers beneath each 10 kg grass (LAYR), and (7) BP placed in a single layer under all of the grass (BOTM). Laboratory silos were filled and sealed, and stored at 15 °C for 163 days. Effluent was collected and weighed from each silo throughout the ensilage period. At opening, silage composition and aerobic stability measurements were made. Total outflow of effluent was reduced (P< 0. 001) by the addition of BP; LAYR had a greater effect (P< 0. 001) {{than any of the other}} treatments. Effluent dry matter (DM) concentration was highest (P< 0. 05) for BOTM and lowest (P< 0. 01) for NONE. All treatments underwent similar lactic-acid dominant fermentations. Incorporation of BP with grass increased silage DM concentration (P< 0. 001), in vitro DM digestibility (P< 0. 05) and water soluble carbohydrate (P< 0. 001) concentration and reduced acid detergent fibre (P< 0. 001) concentration. Aerobic stability was similar across treatments and aerobic deterioration at 192 h was higher (P< 0. 05) for LOWQ, 25 / 75, LAYR and BOTM than for NONE. In conclusion, the incorporation of BP increased silage DM digestibility but had relatively little effect on fermentation or aerobic stability. Placing BP in layers gave the largest and most sustained restriction in effluent output. peer-reviewedB. Cummins acknowledges receipt of a Walsh Fellowship provided by Teagasc.

Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture, 37 (11), 1083 - 1090. Two experiments {{examined the effects}} of defaunation on the ruminal metabolism of lactate. Three rumen-cannulated sheep given a diet of <b>molassed</b> sugar beet pulp and barley (80 : 20) were used to study the effects of defaunation (with manoxol-OT) on the metabolism of lactic acid produced endogenously from rumen fermentation. Defaunation increased mean ruminal concentrations of lactate from 3. 4 mmol litre? 1 to 8. 9 mmol litre? 1 but other rumen measurements remained virtually unchanged: pH, 6. 3 and 6. 3; molar proportions of acetic acid, 645 and 645 mmol mol? 1; propionic acid, 189 and 197 mmol mol? 1 and butyric acid 142 and 115 mmol mol? 1 for the faunated and defaunated states respectively. In a second experiment, two groups each of four rumen-cannulated sheep were used to study the effect of defaunation on the ruminal metabolism of added Na-D, L lactate. One group of four was defaunated using a rumen-washing technique whilst the other group of four remained faunated. The animals were given a diet of rolled barley and hay (60 : 40) and were given a series of intraruminal doses of Na-D, L lactate from 0 to 100 g day? 1, increasing by 20 g day? 1 every third day. Disappearance of added lactate was much more rapid in faunated animals: at the 100 g day? 1 dose rate, L-lactate concentrations had fallen from a peak of 6 g litre? 1 to > 1 g litre? 1 after 3 h whereas in defaunated sheep the peak of 6. 5 g litre? 1 was reduced to > 1 g litre? 1 only after 7 h. In faunated animals lactate addition caused an increase in the ruminal concentration of total volatile fatty acids (VFA) from 147 to 217 mmol litre? 1 between the zero and 100 g day? 1 dose rates, accompanied by an increase in the molar proportion of propionic acid from 190 to 320 mmol mol? 1. However, in defaunated animals there was only a small increase in total VFA concentrations from 94 to 106 mmol ml? 1 with no change in the molar proportion of propionic acid and a small increase in butryric acid from 140 to 180 mmol mol? 1.

40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} to estimate variation among laboratories and between manual and automated techniques of measuring pressure on the resulting gas production profiles (GPP). Eight feeds (<b>molassed</b> sugarbeet feed, grass silage, maize silage, soyabean hulls, maize gluten feed, whole crop wheat silage, wheat, glucose) were milled to pass a I mm screen and sent to three laboratories (ADAS Nutritional Sciences Research Unit, UK; Institute of Grassland and Environmental Research (IGER), UK; Wageningen University, The Netherlands). Each laboratory measured GPP over 144 h using standardised procedures with manual pressure transducers (MPT) and automated pressure systems (APS). The APS at ADAS used a pressure transducer and bottles in a shaking water bath, while the APS at Wageningen and IGER used a pressure sensor and bottles held in a stationary rack. Apparent dry matter degradability (ADDM) was estimated {{at the end of the}} incubation. GPP were fitted to a modified Michaelis-Menten model assuming a single phase of gas production, and GPP were described in terms of the asymptotic volume of gas produced (A), the time to half A (B), the time of maximum gas production rate (t(RM) (gas)) and maximum gas production rate (R-M (gas)). There were effects (P< 0. 001) of substrate on all parameters. However, MPT produced more (P< 0. 001) gas, but with longer (P< 0. 001) B and t(RM gas) (P< 0. 05) and lower (P< 0. 001) R-M gas compared to APS. There was no difference between apparatus in ADDM estimates. Interactions occurred between substrate and apparatus, substrate and laboratory, and laboratory and apparatus. However, when mean values for MPT were regressed from the individual laboratories, relationships were good (i. e., adjusted R- 2 = 0. 827 or higher). Good relationships were also observed with APS, although they were weaker than for MPT (i. e., adjusted R- 2 = 0. 723 or higher). The relationships between mean MPT and mean APS data were also good (i. e., adjusted R 2 = 0. 844 or higher). Data suggest that, although laboratory and method of measuring pressure are sources of variation in GPP estimation, it should be possible using appropriate mathematical models to standardise data among laboratories so that data from one laboratory could be extrapolated to others. This would allow development of a database of GPP data from many diverse feeds. (c) 2005 Published by Elsevier B. V...|$|E

Animal Science, 81 (2), 271 - 282 Twenty-four twin-bearing mature Mule ewes {{were used to}} evaluate the effects of feeding ensiled red clover (Trifolium pratense), lucerne (Medicago sativa) or perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne) during late pregnancy on subsequent ewe and lamb performance. Eight weeks prior to lambing the ewes were individually penned and offered one of the treatment forages ad libitum (no. = 8 per silage). All ewes were supplemented with <b>molassed</b> sugar-beet shreds to avoid dietary energy being a limiting factor and to ensure the responses were primarily attributable to the forage protein content. Individual intakes of the ewes were determined daily and weekly measurements of ewe live weight and body condition score were made. The ewes were also scanned weekly for depths of subcutaneous fat and longissimus dorsi (LD) muscle. Blood samples were taken at 6, 4, 2, and 1 week(s) before lambing, 24 h after lambing and at 3 weeks after lambing and were analysed for serum concentrations of total protein (TP), albumin, urea, beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) and plasma concentrations of glucose and non-esterified fatty acid (NEFA). After lambing all ewes and their lambs were turned out to graze together on a ryegrass sward. The lambs were weighed at birth and at weekly intervals thereafter until 12 weeks post partum. The lucerne silage offered had a higher dry matter (DM) content than the red clover and ryegrass silages (367, 305 and 314 g DM per kg fresh matter, respectively; P 0 ? 05). Silage treatment affected serum concentrations of TP, albumin, globulins and urea during the last 4 weeks of pregnancy (P < 0 ? 05). Lambs born from ewes offered lucerne and red clover silages prior to lambing had higher growth rates from birth to 3 weeks of age than those from ewes offered ryegrass silage (320, 323 and 282 g/day, respectively; P < 0 ? 05). Lamb live weight at 12 weeks of age was higher for lambs from ewes that had been offered the red clover silage, at 29 ? 1 kg compared with 26 ? 7 and 27 ? 1 kg for lambs from ewes previously offered lucerne and ryegrass silages (P < 0 ? 05).

Sponsorship: MLCMale Beulah speckled face lambs (initial live weight (LW) 28. 8 ? 0. 31 kg) were allocated to three dietary treatments {{to evaluate the}} performance of store lambs of a hill breed when offered ensiled lucerne (Medicago sativa), red clover (Trifolium pratense) or ryegrass. Second-cut silage bales (wilted and inoculated) were prepared from 3 -year old lucerne and red clover stands and a 1 -year old ryegrass sward. All the lambs were group-housed and offered ad libitum ryegrass silage during a 3 -week co-variate period. This {{was followed by a}} week of dietary changeover period, after which the lambs were housed individually and offered their treatment diet ad libitum. All the lambs received a flat rate supplement of pelleted <b>molassed</b> sugarbeet (250 g fresh weight/day). Individual intakes were determined daily, and weekly measurements of LW and body condition score (CS) were made. Additional measurements were taken by scanning the lambs for depth of Longissimus dorsi (LD) muscle and subcutaneous fat. Over an experimental period of 7 weeks, the lambs offered red clover silage had a higher voluntary silage dry matter (DM) intake, total DM intake and metabolisable energy (ME) intake (P < 0. 001) than lambs offered either lucerne or ryegrass silage. This resulted in a faster (P < 0. 001) growth rate and increase (P < 0. 001) in CS, with no difference between lucerne and ryegrass silages. The feed conversion efficiency (FCE) was 8. 0 ? 0. 61 kg feed/kg gain for lambs fed red clover silage, compared with 16. 6 ? 2. 82 and 10. 6 ? 1. 94 kg feed/kg gain for lucerne and ryegrass silage, respectively. The CP intake was higher (P < 0. 001) for lambs fed the lucerne and red clover silages than for the ryegrass silage treatment. The concentration of plasma total protein (TP) was higher (P < 0. 05) for lambs offered ryegrass silage versus lucerne and red clover silage.
