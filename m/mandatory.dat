5|$|A <b>mandatory</b> {{order is}} {{an order of}} the High Court which {{commands}} a public body to perform a public duty, and is usually employed to compel public bodies to exercise the powers given to them. It {{may be used in}} combination with another remedy, most commonly a quashing order. In such a case, the quashing order will set aside the unlawful decision, and the <b>mandatory</b> order will require the public body to reconsider the matter. A person who complies with a <b>mandatory</b> order cannot have legal proceedings taken against him or her for doing so.|$|E

5|$|However, the United Kingdom courts {{gradually}} {{adopted a}} single sufficient interest test for all prerogative orders. In R. v. Commissioners of Customs and Excise, ex parte Cook (1969), for example, the High Court used a sufficient interest test {{to determine whether}} an applicant had standing {{to apply for a}} <b>mandatory</b> order. Singapore followed the UK's move towards a uniform test for all prerogative orders. In Re Lim Chor Pee, ex parte Law Society of Singapore (1986), the Court of Appeal endorsed the sufficient interest test for <b>mandatory</b> orders. In that case, the Law Society of Singapore had applied for a mandamus (now known as a <b>mandatory</b> order) to ensure that the Disciplinary Committee heard and investigated all six charges levied against an advocate and solicitor. The Court, applying the decision of the House of Lords in R. v. Inland Revenue Commissioners, ex parte National Federation of Self-Employed and Small Businesses Ltd. (1981), held that the test for standing was whether the applicant had a sufficient interest in the subject matter, and not whether he or she had a specific legal right.|$|E
5|$|In 1970 the United States Congress {{repealed}} <b>mandatory</b> {{penalties for}} cannabis offenses and The Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act separated cannabis from other illicit narcotics and removed <b>mandatory</b> sentences {{for possession of}} small amounts of cannabis.

The Commission found that the constitutionality of cannabis prohibition was suspect and that the executive and legislative branches had a responsibility to obey the Constitution, {{even in the absence}} of a court ruling to do so. The Richard Nixon administration did not implement the study's recommendations.|$|E

5|$|A <b>mandatory</b> {{order is}} {{an order of}} the High Court {{commanding}} a public authority to perform a public duty, while a prohibiting order operates to prevent illegal action by an authority from occurring in the first place. A quashing order, the most commonly sought prerogative order, {{has the effect of}} invalidating an ultra vires decision made by an authority. Obtaining a <b>mandatory,</b> prohibiting or quashing order is a two-stage process, as an applicant must be granted leave by the Court to apply for the order. The Court must find the existence of a proper public law issue and available grounds of review. Leave will be granted provided that an arguable and prima facie case of reasonable suspicion that the authority has acted in breach of administrative law rules is established.|$|E
5|$|After the Unilateral Declaration of Independence (UDI), the British {{government}} {{petitioned the}} United Nations for sanctions against Rhodesia pending unsuccessful talks with Smith's administration in 1966 and 1968.
