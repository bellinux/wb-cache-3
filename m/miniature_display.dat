40|$|Current {{technology}} {{trends are}} focused on miniaturizing displays, although for specific applications {{such as the use}} of head-mounted displays (HMD) this limits the advancements for a wider field-of-view (FOV) and a negligible overall weight of the optics. Due to the advancements of electronics that benefit from smaller <b>miniature</b> <b>displays,</b> universities and companies {{are focused on}} developing this technology to meet the growing demand of this global market. Higher resolution displays with added brightness are being developed, but these displays are decreasing in their viewable area. HMDs can benefit from these higher resolution and brighter displays but they will undergo an increased optical weight to compensate for the smaller display size. To overcome this hindrance in HMDs, we demonstrate in this paper how to incorporate microlenslet arrays as an optical relay system to magnify <b>miniature</b> <b>displays.</b> Microlenslet arrays provide respectively shorter focal length which yields a smaller overall object to image distance and an incremental overall weight compared to an otherwise increased optical lens assembly. The contribution of this paper is a patented concept of magnifying/demagnifying <b>miniature</b> <b>displays</b> with microlenslet arrays that can be integrated in a spaced limited area...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. A <b>miniature</b> <b>display</b> device, {{recently}} available commercially, {{is aimed}} at providing a portable, inexpensive means of visual information communication. The display is head mounted {{in front of one}} eye with the other eye's view of the environment unobstructed. Various visual phenomena are associated with this design. The consequences of these phenomena for visual safety, comfort, and efficiency of the user were evaluated: (1) The monocular, partially occluded mode ofoperation interrupts binocular vision. Presenting disparate images to each eye results in binocular rivalry. Most observers can use the display comfortably in this rivalrous mode. In many cases, it is easier to use the display in a peripheral position, slightly above or below the line of sight, thus permitting normal binocular vision of the environment. (2) As a head-mounted device, the displayed image is perceived to move during head movements due to the response of the vestibulo-ocular reflex. These movements affect the visibility of small letters during active head rotations and sharp accelerations...|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION Full colour {{images have}} been {{demonstrated}} on a miniature binary display system utilising a Ferroelectric Liquid Crystal over VLSI (FLC/VLSI) technology. The reflective display or SLM (Spatial Light Modulator) is actively illuminated by three high intensity coloured Light Emitting Diodes (LED's) (RED (650 nm, 3 cd), GREEN (568 nm, 750 mcd) and BLUE (450 nm, 1 cd)). Due to their small size and light weight these displays have many potential applications including head mounted or other applications requiring high portability. THE <b>MINIATURE</b> <b>DISPLAY</b> The display used consists of a 176 x 176 array [1] of single transistor DRAM style pixels of 30 m pitch and is available from GEC-Marconi Research Centre[2]. The display has an overall active area size of 5. 28 mm x 5. 28 mm with a pixel flat factor of 81 % achieved by post processing planarization [3]. The device is filled with a surface stabilised FLC material (Smectic C, Merck-BDH) and appears t...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Over {{the past}} decade, we have {{developed}} an augmented reality system called the Sonic Flashlight (SF), which merges ultrasound with the operator’s vision using a half-silvered mirror and a <b>miniature</b> <b>display</b> attached to the ultrasound probe. We now add a small video camera and a structured laser light source so that computer vision algorithms can determine {{the location of the}} surface of the patient being scanned, to aid in analysis of the ultrasound data. In particular, we intend to determine the angle of the ultrasound probe relative to the surface to disambiguate Doppler information from arteries and veins running parallel to, and beneath, that surface. The initial demonstration presented here finds the orientation of a flat-surfaced ultrasound phantom. This is a first step towards integrating more sophisticated computer vision methods into automated ultrasound analysis, with the ultimate goal of creating a symbiotic human/machine system that shares both ultrasound and visual data...|$|E

40|$|Die Dissertation erscheint {{parallel}} im Verlag: Lehrstuhl für Mikrocharakterisierung, Friedrich-Alexander-Univ., Erlangen, ISBN 3 - 932392 - 38 - 8 The area of neuro-technology is {{an example}} of recent developments in medical technology in which technical progress in modern information technology - particularly within the field of micro system engineering - is to be used successfully for implants. Implants for the eye supposed to give back a certain vision to blind persons in future is a very demanding task. This includes eye disease patterns where the photoreceptors in the human retina are degenerating, thus losing their light receiving function. Meanwhile, work was performed on further ophthalmologic implants for blind persons whose cloudy corneae of the eye are opaque due to illness or accident. In this work the possibilities of opto-electronic technologies for the application in eye implants are analyzed. First, the advantages of opto-electronic procedures within the young and interdisciplinary research field of neuro-technology are pointed out. The concepts developed for the application in eye implants are presented and discussed. On this basis the technical feasibility is demonstrated by means of two examples. In detail the wireless - here optical - transfer of electrical power to a subretinally fixed retina implant (SUB-RET) is presented, as well as the pilot development of an LED based <b>miniature</b> <b>display</b> for the implantation within an artificial intraocular lens...|$|E
40|$|Medical {{ultrasound}} typically {{deals with}} {{the interior of the}} patient, with the exterior left to the original medical imaging modality, direct human vision. For the human operator scanning the patient, the view of the external anatomy is essential for correctly locating the ultrasound probe on the body and making sense of the resulting ultrasound images in their proper anatomical context. The operator, after all, is not expected to perform the scan with his eyes shut. Over the past decade, our laboratory has developed a method of fusing these two information streams {{in the mind of the}} operator, the Sonic Flashlight, which uses a half silvered mirror and <b>miniature</b> <b>display</b> mounted on an ultrasound probe to produce a virtual image within the patient at its proper location. We are now interested in developing a similar data fusion approach within the ultrasound machine itself, by, in effect, giving vision to the transducer. Our embodiment of this concept consists of an ultrasound probe with two small video cameras mounted on it, with software capable of locating the surface of an ultrasound phantom using stereo disparity between the two video images. We report its first successful operation, demonstrating a 3 D rendering of the phantom’s surface with the ultrasound data superimposed at its correct relative location. Eventually, automated analysis of these registered data sets may permit the scanner and its associated computational apparatus to interpret the ultrasound data within its anatomical context, much as the human operator does today...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} the number, function {{and size of}} principal military displays and establishes a basis to determine the opportunities for technology insertion {{in the immediate future}} and into the next millennium. Principal military displays are defined as those occupying appreciable crewstation real-estate and/or those without which the platform could not carry out its intended mission. DoD ÒofficeÓ applications are excluded from this study. The military displays market is specified by such parameters as active area and footprint size, and other characteristics such as luminance, gray scale, resolution, angle, color, video capability, and night vision imaging system compatibility. Funded, future acquisitions, planned and predicted crewstation modification kits, and form-fit upgrades are taken into account. This paper provides an overview of the DoD niche market, allowing both government and industry a necessary reference by which to meet DoD requirements for military displays in a timely and cost-effective manner. The aggregate DoD installed base for direct-view and large-area military displays is presently estimated to be in excess of 313, 000. <b>Miniature</b> <b>displays</b> are those which must be magnified to be viewed, involve a significantly different manufacturing paradigm and are used in helmet mounted displays and thermal weapon sight applications. Some 114, 000 <b>miniature</b> <b>displays</b> are presently included within future weapon system acquisition plans. For vendor production planning purposes it is noted that foreign military sales could substantially increase these quantities. The vanishing vendor syndrome (VVS) for older display technologies continues to be a growing, pervasive problem throughout DoD, which consequently must leverage the more modern, especially flat panel, display technologies being developed to replace older, especially cathode ray tube, technology for civil-commercial markets. Total DoD display needs (FPD, HMD) are some 427, 000. 1...|$|R
