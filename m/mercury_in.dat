5|$|In Virginia, some Carolina wrens populations show {{high levels}} of <b>mercury</b> <b>in</b> their blood and this is {{acquired}} from feeding all-year-round on spiders. Spiders being at a higher trophic levels contain a higher concentrations of mercury (through biomagnification) than herbivorous invertebrates. As these wrens are year-round residents, they are at a higher risk than other species to acquire <b>mercury</b> <b>in</b> its blood. Nest abandonment and failure to raise young were more common with higher mercury content. Exposure, and prolonged periods of cold, ice, and snow is thought to affect the wren nestling and adult populations, respectively. Wrens that outlast those winters reside in sheltered areas during the season.|$|E
5|$|In the European Union, the {{directive}} on the Restriction of the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment (see RoHS) bans mercury from certain electrical and electronic products, and limits {{the amount of}} <b>mercury</b> <b>in</b> other products to less than 1000 ppm. There are restrictions for mercury concentration in packaging (the limit is 100 ppm for sum of mercury, lead, hexavalent chromium and cadmium) and batteries (the limit is 5 ppm). In July 2007, the European Union also banned <b>mercury</b> <b>in</b> non-electrical measuring devices, such as thermometers and barometers. The ban applies to new devices only, and contains exemptions for the health care sector and a two-year grace period for manufacturers of barometers.|$|E

40|$|We {{conducted}} a survey of <b>mercury</b> contamination <b>in</b> largemouth bass Micropterus salmoides from Caddo Lake, Texas, and found that fish collected from forested wetland habitat had higher concentrations of mercury than those collected from open-water habitat. Habitat-specific differences in largemouth bass size, age, absolute growth rate, trophic position (based on d 15 N), and horizontal food web position (based on d 13 C), characteristics known to influence mercury accumulation, did not explain the observed differences <b>in</b> <b>mercury</b> contamination. Rather, habitat-related differences <b>in</b> <b>mercury</b> concentration <b>in</b> a primary consumer, Mississippi grass shrimp Palaemonetes kadiakensis, indicated that food webs in forested wetland habitat were more contaminated with <b>mercury</b> than those <b>in</b> open-water habitat. Spatial variation <b>in</b> <b>mercury</b> contamination within lakes and elevated <b>mercury</b> concentrations <b>in</b> forested wetlands should be of special concern not only to researchers but also to public and environmental health officials dealing with <b>mercury</b> contamination <b>in</b> aquatic environments and human health risks associated with consumption of fish contaminated with mercury.

40|$|Concerns {{with public}} health risks {{associated}} with mercury-contaminated fish have prompted a variety of proposals to cut or eliminate mercury emissions. As a step toward assessing how such reductions could affect fish contamination, we develop a cross-sectional epidemiological model of <b>mercury</b> levels <b>in</b> fish. Using data on stream characteristics, land use, the presence of point sources and both measured and modeled atmospheric deposition of mercury, we explain two-thirds of the variation <b>in</b> <b>mercury</b> levels <b>in</b> fish. We find that greater mercury deposition is not generally associated with higher <b>mercury</b> levels <b>in</b> fish. These results suggest that reductions in deposition (and emissions) may affect <b>mercury</b> levels <b>in</b> fish only slightly or with a significant delay. ...|$|R
40|$|Construction of {{hydroelectric}} reservoirs in {{a certain}} large watershed of China {{has led to a}} marked rise <b>in</b> <b>mercury</b> concentration <b>in</b> fish. Correlation analysis and stepwise regression of R values (ratio of <b>mercury</b> concentration <b>in</b> carp from 12 reservoirs and <b>mercury</b> concentration <b>in</b> carp from rivers which feed into the reservoirs) and various hydrologic parameters demonstrate that the ratio of catchment area and runoff is the crucial determining factor. Other determining factors are the ratio of flooding area of land and reservoir area of dead storage capacity, and the reciprocal of reservoir area. On this basis, the predictive models of <b>mercury</b> accumulation <b>in</b> carp after reservoir construction, with one and two parameter, respectively, were obtained.

5|$|It {{is thought}} that the vulcanoids would be very rich in {{elements}} with a high melting point, such as iron and nickel. They are unlikely to possess a regolith because such fragmented material heats and cools more rapidly, and is affected more strongly by the Yarkovsky effect, than solid rock. Vulcanoids are probably similar to <b>Mercury</b> <b>in</b> colour and albedo, and may contain material {{left over from the}} earliest stages of the Solar System's formation.|$|E
5|$|Mercury also {{enters into}} the {{environment}} through the improper disposal (e.g., land filling, incineration) of certain products. Products containing mercury include: auto parts, batteries, fluorescent bulbs, medical products, thermometers, and thermostats. Due to health concerns (see below), toxics use reduction efforts are cutting back or eliminating <b>mercury</b> <b>in</b> such products. For example, the amount of mercury sold in thermostats in the United States decreased from 14.5 tons in 2004 to 3.9 tons in 2007.|$|E
5|$|Mercury is used {{primarily}} for the manufacture of industrial chemicals or for electrical and electronic applications.

A current {{investigation of the}} <b>mercury</b> distribution <b>in</b> ambient air, soils, and plants suggests that mobile <b>mercury</b> species <b>in</b> soils created elevated <b>mercury</b> concentrations <b>in</b> ambient air and vegetation. Mercury concentrations of up to 600 [*]ng/m 3 in air over the contaminated area provided evidence of the mercury transformation to volatile Hg(0). Mercury analysis of soil and plant samples demonstrated that the <b>mercury</b> concentrations <b>in</b> soil with vaporized and plant-absorbable forms {{were higher in the}} southern area, which was closer to the factory.

40|$|Abstract. Biologists {{and policy}} makers {{continue}} to seek environmental correlates of <b>mercury</b> bioavail-ability <b>in</b> aquatic ecosystems. In this study, we assessed the effects of drainage basin, habitat type, size class, and sex on <b>mercury</b> concentrations <b>in</b> the northern crayfish, Orconectes virilis (Hagen). Drainage basin, habitat type, and size class had significant effects on <b>mercury</b> concentration <b>in</b> crayfish tail muscle even though animals from roughly half the sites examined had mean mercury values at or below expected background levels. The low observed <b>mercury</b> values <b>in</b> crayfish tail muscle indicate a low consumptive risk. Contrary to expectations, crayfish from brooks had higher mercury concentrations than animals from other habitat types, possibly {{as a result of}} point source contamination or varying diet compositions among habitats. We suggest that crayfish represent a good indicator of <b>mercury</b> bioavailability <b>in</b> aquatic eco-systems and provide a synthesis for lower food webs. Our understanding of <b>mercury</b> dynamics <b>in</b> lower food webs has been hindered by an under appreciation of the complexity in foraging habits of macroin-vertebrates. Further studies focusing on benthos with well-understood life histories and foraging behavior are essential to improve our understanding of mercury transfer and bioavailability through aquatic systems...|$|R

5|$|Gliese 876 b is in a 1:2:4 Laplace {{resonance}} {{with the}} inner planet Gliese 876 c {{and the outer}} planet Gliese 876 e: {{in the time it}} takes planet e to complete one orbit, planet b completes two and planet c completes four. This is the second known example of a Laplace resonance, the first being Jupiter's moons Io, Europa and Ganymede. As a result, the orbital elements of the planets change fairly rapidly as they dynamically interact with one another. The planet's orbit has a low eccentricity, similar to the planets in the Solar System. The semimajor axis of the orbit is only 0.208 AU, less than that of <b>Mercury</b> <b>in</b> the Solar System. However Gliese 876 is such a faint star that this puts it in the outer part of the habitable zone.|$|E
