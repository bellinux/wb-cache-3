40|$|The thesis {{intends to}} lay down {{innovative}} foundations for valuing contracts or portfolios of contracts under counterparty risk and {{in the presence of}} netting agreements. The approach departs from the usual methods for pricing contracts, and portfolios of contracts, with counterparty risk found in the literature. In effect, typically, these models, first, do not account for either systemic effects or 'at first default' contagion, second, postulate that the contract value at default equals either the default-free value or the pre-default value, and third, do not take <b>margin</b> <b>agreements</b> into account. Instead, we propose a general framework which allows for examining the bilateral counterparty risk of a contract, or a portfolio of contracts, in the presence of systemic and 'right or wrong way' risks, and under several settlement conventions, possibly with netting, and <b>margin</b> <b>agreements.</b> The methodology, which has been designed to cover a large class of financial instruments, is illustrated by means of numerous examples, such as an interest rate swap, a credit default swap, a collateralized debt obligation, and a credit index. In effect, suitable extensions of Kusuoka's models are constructed in order to present the approach as well as analyse the specifics of valuation and hedging under counterparty risk. The results are then leveraged so as to build an efficient and versatile model for pricing under counterparty risk, namely an affine Markov chain model which accounts for settlement convention, dependency of times of default, contagion effect at first default, right or wrong way risk, collateralization and systemic risk. Let us also emphasize that the pricing procedures are presented in detail, which should give readily implementable pricing algorithms for practitioners...|$|R

40|$|Even {{though for}} more than 15 years, deep {{integration}} in trade agreements has been a recurring topic for politicians, scholars, international institutions, non-governmental organizations, industry leaders and journalists; {{there is no consensus}} yet on what deep integration is, and how it can be assessed. There are continuous news reports about the efforts of political leaders to pursue deep integration, and constant mentions about the design of new treaties and mechanisms to achieve deep integration between countries. In general, the proliferation of trade agreements after the Second World War is widely acknowledged in international trade literature and is a trend that will continue in the near future. Along this trend, Latin American governments have established numerous trade agreements with developing and developed partners in all regions of the world. In addition, since the 1950 s and 1960 s, these governments have acknowledged trade integration as a mean to promote economic development, which makes it increasingly important to understand the wide differences in the nature and levels of deep integration in their trade agreements. Nevertheless, as in other regions, little {{attention has been paid to}} explain differences in the content of trade agreements. This research extends an endogenous trade theory framework, first to analyse limited liberalization; and second, to study a group of countries with particular characteristics of opacity and discretional decision-making. The framework adapts a categorization of deep integration, derives preferences of economic actors from economic trade theories, and extends aspects of veto player theory and access point theory to exploit further their potential as an integrated structure of analysis. Then, these three aspects are studied through a collective action framework. Finally, the insight of previous studies that have highlighted the importance of systemic and international variables in the formation and design of trade agreements is considered. The importance of systemic and international theories and variables is not contested; the domestic-level explanations are developed as a complement to the insight that theories of international relations have provided. Two main arguments are put forward The first one is that the underlying depth structure of the trade agreements studied fits a categorization of vertical and horizontal margins, which are qualitatively different: vertical policy benefits are broader and more excludable than horizontal ones. To test this argument, first, the complete texts of all dyadic trade agreements signed by Latin American countries from 1982 to 2010 (256 dyadic agreements) were manually coded to form a database of depth of provisions (a total of 28, 160 data points). To minimize error measurement, entries were compared with those of partially overlapping databases (publicly available or accessed by request). In the following areas, a total of 110 provisions per agreement were coded and measured: antidumping measures and countervailing duties, bargaining position, competition, decision power, dispute settlement mechanisms, environment, global and bilateral safeguards, government procurement, institutional capacities, investment, labour, legitimacy, permanency, number of members, rules of origin, services, technical barriers to trade, type of agreement, and support bodies and mechanisms. To the best of my knowledge, this is the most comprehensive and detailed database of the depth of provisions of trade agreements established by Latin American countries. Next, provisions were analytically assigned to each margin. At the horizontal <b>margin,</b> <b>agreements</b> vary in the extent of the areas covered, the barriers removed in each area, the limits placed to governments when domestic industries face injury, and the coverage and strength of the support and enforcement mechanisms in each area. At the vertical <b>margin,</b> <b>agreements</b> vary in type, legitimacy required for entry into force and for amendments, permanency, and scope of institutional capabilities. Finally, principal components analysis confirmed that each variable aligns in the component to which was analytically assigned. As expected, the analysis highlighted the existence of two main components, which corresponded to the vertical and horizontal margins. The second main argument in this research is that two main domestic aspects contribute to explain the wide variations in nature and levels of depth of the trade agreements established by Latin American countries after 1982. First, changes in the structure of concentration of the export sectors of Latin American countries. Second, the degree of political decisiveness and level of access of societal demands determined by the institutional settings of these countries. After most of the countries abandoned the economic model based in the substitution of imports, in the 1980 s, the structure of the export sectors of the countries changed. Two forces pulled in different directions: unilateral liberalization towards concentration and diversification towards deconcentration. On the one hand, agreements vary in the extent of barriers removed in diverse trade related regulatory activities, and in the inclusion of support and enforcement institutions and mechanisms. This research argues that these aspects have implications over the economic benefits that different types of exporters are able to appropriate, and therefore over their preferences over aspects of deep integration and over the intensities of said preferences. Resourceful exporters with scale economies and/or fragmented production increased their static and dynamic gains from trade through vertical and horizontal integration. In addition, this research argues that the different extents of the governments’ political decisiveness and access to societal demands have important implications over the lobbying costs of levels and forms of deep integration, and therefore over the possibilities of different types of exporters to shape trade agreements according to their preferences and priorities. Combining the veto players theory and the access points theory (extending the former to consider competition from rents from lobbying, and extending latter to include settings of imperfect competition), suggests that decreases in the costs of lobbying veto players increased the possibilities of resourceful exporters with increasing returns to scale and/or fragmented production to achieve vertical integration. However, decreases in the costs of lobbying access points without veto power reduced these types of exporters’ advantages of capturing said points, which reflected negatively in horizontal depth. In these cases, predictions about deep integration based on of veto player theory and on access point theory, became conditional on the concentration of the export sector. Cross-sectional regression analysis was performed to test these arguments. The main results and those of robustness tests tended to show direct and indirect support for the arguments put forward in this research...|$|R

40|$|New {{structural}} data, available seismicity data {{together with}} mechanical {{constraints on the}} Eurasian continental lithosphere and reconstruction of paleostress trajectories are combined in order to re-assess and discuss the dominant deformation mode (thin-skinned vs thick-skinned) in the Western fold-and-thrust belt of the active Taiwan collision zone. Serial balanced cross-sections and computed paleostress tensors suggest that structural styles and stress trajectories {{at the front of}} the Taiwan mountain belt may vary rapidly along-strike depending on the presence of pre-orogenic Paleogene troughs in the Chinese continental margin (Taihsi and Tainan basins) that are favourably oriented to be reactivated and in-verted. In localities of the western foreland, where basin inversion and thick-skinned basement-involved shortening predominate, the crustal seismic activity is important and characterized by strike-slip faulting. In these domains of the foldethrust belt, the stress deviations with respect to the regional transport direction are also important. By contrast, in domains of significant syn-orogenic subsidence, a thin-skinned style of deformation may be prominent due to the lack of available pre-existing features. The seismic activity is limited to few major faulted boundaries such as the active ChelungpueSani thrust, and the stress deviations are limited. The timing of deformation at the belt front seems to be inde-pendent of the structural styles, so that frontal folds are active since probably 0. 5 Ma. However, in inner parts of the Western Foothills of Taiwan, where superimposed thick-skinned and thin-skinned deformation are required, out-of-sequence thrusting occurs to maintain the topographic pro-file. Finally, we suggest that kinematics and structural styles of the western foldethrust belt are controlled by the mechanics of the Eurasian continental <b>margin</b> in <b>agreement</b> with a recent study. At the scale of the orogen, the limited shortening amounts across the WF and in the Central Range as well as the absence of continental HP-rocks better support a thick-skinned collision model for Taiwan...|$|R
40|$|According to {{previous}} paleomagnetic analyses, the northward latitudinal drift of Iran {{related to the}} closure of the Paleo-Tethys Ocean resulted in the Late Triassic collision of Iran with the Eurasian plate and Cimmerian orogeny. The post-Cimmerian paleogeographic and tectonic evolution of Iran is instead less well known. Here we present new paleomagnetic data from the Upper Jurassic Bidou Formation of Central Iran, which we used in conjunction with published paleomagnetic data to reconstruct the history of paleomagnetic rotations and latitudinal drift of Iran during the Mesozoic and Cenozoic. Paleomagnetic inclination values indicate that, during the Late Jurassic, the Central-East-Iranian Microcontinent (CEIM), consisting of the Yazd, Tabas, and Lut continental blocks, was located at low latitudes close to the Eurasian <b>margin,</b> in <b>agreement</b> with the position expected from apparent polar wander paths (APWP) incorporating the so-called Jurassic massive polar shift, a major event of plate motion occurring in the Late Jurassic from 160 Ma to 145 – 140 Ma. At these times, the CEIM was oriented WSW–ENE, with the Lut Block bordered to the south by the Neo-Tethys Ocean and to the southeast by the Neo-Sistan oceanic seaway. Subsequently, the CEIM underwent significant counter-clockwise (CCW) rotation during the Early Cretaceous. This rotation may have resulted from the northward propagation of the Sistan rifting- spreading axis during Late Jurassic–Early Cretaceous, or to the subsequent (late Early Cretaceous?) eastward subduction and closure of the Sistan oceanic seaway underneath the continental margin of the Afghan Block. No rotations of, or within, the CEIM occurred during the Late Cretaceous–Oligocene, whereas a second phase of CCW rotation occurred after the Middle-Late Miocene. Both the Late Jurassic–Early Cretaceous and post Miocene CCW rotations are confined to the CEIM and do not seem to extend to other tectonic regions of Iran.

40|$|Composition and {{succession}} of all major organism groups in microfilm in a flow channel {{in the river}} Rhine were examined in parallel {{over a period of}} 14 months. In addition, abiotic parameters were monitored (e. g. temperature, water level, chlorophyll content). Based on these data an additional laboratory experiments involving chromadorid nematodes and bdelloid rotatoria, the first model ever of matter flow in the biofilm of a large river could be developed, possibly representing an important contribution to the identification of relevant interactions in the biofilm system. It could be demonstrated that the matter flow in biofilm of the river Rhine was dominated by protozoans - mostly filtrating species - in the investigated model system; they contributed around 78 % to the mean annual metabolism. The most important representatives of heterotrophic flagellates were sessile choanoflagellates with abundances up to 100, 000 individuals/cm². Throughout the year, ciliates were mostly dominated by peritrichous ciliates. With respect to individual count, metazoans were dominated by bdelloid rotatoria and chromadorid nematodes, representing together more than 90 % of the metazoans during the study period. The densities of chromadorid nematodes were high, even up to 600 ind. /cm². Another important result of the current study was the proof of the strong benthic-pelagic coupling in the Rhine. It could be demonstrated that only approximately 2 % of the biomass metabolized in biofilm was autochthonously synthesized in the biofilm itself; 98 % were imported directly from the pelagial. This high import portion of planctonic organisms controls the benthic microbial metabolic cycling in the investigated system, i. e. biofilm in the Rhine, and therefore also represents an important structuring factor for the planctonic food web. Sampling of ice habitats in the Antarctic demonstrated that also the communities of heterotrophic flagellates in Antarctic were primarily composed of benthic species. Biofilm in slush was dominated by filtrating species (choanoflagellates and chrysomonads) at the floe <b>margins,</b> being in <b>agreement</b> with the biofilm samples of the Rhine. Compared to individual counts in the pelagial, the individual density of protozoans in ice-related biofilms was significantly higher. It is suggested that the accumulation of organisms in the biofilms of ice-related habitats also in Arctic habitats {{plays an important role in}} the control of nutrient cycling...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{provides}} a fresh {{assessment of the}} 1921 Railways Act by examining its origins, nature and significance, with special reference to the perspectives of railway officials and others directly involved after 1908, across a period encompassing the cataclysmic experience of the Great War. At a time of growing concern about domestic political stability and the British economy's international competitiveness, the railway industry entered a new phase. Its commercial outlook became increasingly uncertain. The network was mature and losing local traffic to flexible new transport technologies. Gross revenues continued to grow, but were outpaced by costs. Money markets demanded higher returns, making capital expenditure problematic. Inevitably, the industry's huge capital debt and parliament's perceived role in helping to generate it, along with the railway industry's commercial drives and management practices, came under intense scrutiny. Working within a rigid regulatory regime, last amended in 1894, and burdened by nineteenth century statutory obligations and perceptions, companies strove to maintain <b>margins</b> by cooperative <b>agreements</b> and other means {{that led to a}} deteriorating relationship with customers. Moreover, the railway industry's labour force, seeking equality with capital, became more militant, as evidenced by the 1911 national strike. Within this context, the Asquith Government finally accepted the shortcomings of the existing regulatory framework, and in 1913 established a Royal Commission, chaired by Lord Loreburn, to reappraise the industry's relationship with the state, even its nationalisation. However, the outbreak of war stopped the commission's work prematurely. The Great War brought the railway companies under government control for an unexpectedly long duration. By its end there was wide agreement that their condition, caused by wartime operations without concern for commercial considerations, prevented their immediate return to their proprietors. The resettlement process, between 1919 and 1921, created an opportunity for reform denied in 1914, and particularly for Sir Eric Geddes to influence the outcome through his 1920 White Paper, which relied on improving the industry's efficiency to validate its radical changes. The Act's dual intent, resettlement and reform, was highly constrained by the intractable nature of the industry's pre-war commercial weaknesses, and the economic circumstances and national mood of the post-war period...|$|R
40|$|Regional {{integration}} {{has been}} seen in Africa {{as a means of}} encouraging trade and securing economies of scale. This paper examines in detail the prospects and challenges for trade expansion in the two most prominent arrangements in eastern and southern Africa: the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) and the Southern African Development Community (SADC). It finds that possibilities of growth in intraregional trade may be limited, but that the two arrangements offer opportunities for member countries to gain policy credibility for trade reforms and tariff liberalization and to address structural weaknesses. In this regard, the negotiation of the Economic Partnership Agreements with the European Union can also have a significant impact.
