50|$|In the 1960s and {{the first}} half of the 1970s, McClure had the {{distinction}} of being the last place in Ohio with a <b>manual</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>system.</b> Since the installation of the first telephone system in the 1890s, by The Ohio Bell Telephone Co., residents used the same method to signal their town's operator; they turned a crank on their phone. The operator in most cases knew their voice or knew the person being called. They had phone numbers, such as 6, or 328, or 77, but as the operators knew everyone's name, numbers were rarely used.|$|E
50|$|In early 1960, the world's first {{electronic}} switching system was {{installed at the}} Morris central office. The system was a milestone in telephone switching history, an experiment whose planning started in the early 1950s, {{and led to the}} largest sustained research and development program toward a single goal in the Bell System. After conversion of the existing <b>manual</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>system</b> using telephone operators for completing telephone calls, with an automatic electromechanical crossbar switching system starting in ca. 1958, a few hundred subscribers received dial service from June 1960 through January 1962 from the first mostly electronic system, that used cold-cathode electron tubes, instead of mechanical relays and switches. For telephone subscribers, the most notable characteristic of what is usually called the Morris System was the use of electronic tone ringers which used up to eight different tones produced by a tweeter, rather than the traditional bell ringer.|$|E

50|$|Mobile radio <b>telephone</b> <b>systems</b> were <b>telephone</b> <b>systems</b> of {{wireless}} type {{that preceded the}} modern cellular mobile form of telephony technology. Since they were the predecessors {{of the first generation}} of cellular <b>telephones,</b> these <b>systems</b> are sometimes retroactively referred to as pre-cellular (or sometimes zero generation, that is, 0G) systems. Technologies used in pre-cellular systems included the Push to Talk (PTT or <b>manual),</b> Mobile <b>Telephone</b> <b>System</b> (MTS), Improved Mobile Telephone Service (IMTS), and Advanced Mobile <b>Telephone</b> <b>System</b> (AMTS) systems.These early mobile <b>telephone</b> <b>systems</b> can be distinguished from earlier closed radiotelephone systems in that they were available as a commercial service {{that was part of the}} public switched telephone network, with their own telephone numbers, rather than part of a closed network such as a police radio or taxi dispatch system.|$|R
5000|$|In earlier times, the {{available}} discarded data included printed manuals and design records. In a famous case, a student, Jerry Schneider, discovered some discarded <b>manuals</b> for a <b>telephone</b> <b>system</b> ordering / shipping system {{and was able}} to build a business selling 'surplus' gear ordered from the telephone company as though for an internal company department.|$|R

5000|$|Until 1798, post {{bound for}} Worthing was {{conveyed}} by coach to Steyning and left there for collection. From then, deliveries operated via Shoreham-by-Sea, but in 1807 Worthing's first post office opened {{and it became}} a post town. [...] The main post office—a Head Post Office between 1919 and 1985— has occupied eight different sites, but it moved to Chapel Road in 1878 and was rebuilt in Neo-Georgian style in 1930. [...] Public telegraph services began in 1880, although the railway had a system in place from 1859. Worthing's <b>telephone</b> <b>system</b> began in 1890; a <b>manual</b> <b>telephone</b> exchange, once the largest in England, was established in 1912 and was supplemented by a second in Goring-by-Sea in 1929.

50|$|In 1899, a {{post office}} was {{established}} in the present location of Oakbank and the village grew around it. In 1901, a Presbyterian church was moved to the community and a Baptist church built in 1908. In 1906, the Canadian Pacific Railway built a track that passed through the village; by 1927 the line was double-tracked. A train station existed until 1968. Electricity was supplied by the Winnipeg Electric Company starting in 1930. Rural electrification did not reach the surrounding area until 1949. In 1887, a telephone was installed in the home of the municipal secretary treasurer. Various private telephone companies, often with only a dozen subscribers, operated until they were all absorbed by Manitoba <b>Telephone</b> <b>System</b> in 1950. In 1964, local school divisions were consolidated and Oakbank became the local center for elementary, junior high and high school students, against many people's wishes. A local <b>manual</b> <b>telephone</b> exchange was in operation until 1966 when an automatic exchange was installed. A credit union was founded in the village in 1945 and continues to operate today. Another credit union opened for business in 2009.|$|R

5|$|The Ottoman Ministry of Post and Telegraph was {{established}} in 1840 and the first post office, the Imperial Post Office, opened near the courtyard of Yeni Mosque. By 1876, the first international mailing network between Istanbul and the lands beyond the Ottoman Empire had been established. Sultan Abdülmecid I issued Samuel Morse his first official honor for the telegraph in 1847, and construction of the first telegraph line—between Istanbul and Edirne—finished in time to announce {{the end of the}} Crimean War in 1856. A nascent <b>telephone</b> <b>system</b> began to emerge in Istanbul in 1881 and after the first <b>manual</b> <b>telephone</b> exchange became operational in Istanbul in 1909, the Ministry of Post and Telegraph became the Ministry of Post, Telegraph, and Telephone. GSM cellular networks arrived in Turkey in 1994, with Istanbul among the first cities to receive the service. Today, mobile and landline service is provided by private companies, after Türk Telekom, which split from the Ministry of Post, Telegraph, and Telephone in 1995, was privatized in 2005. Postal services remain under the purview of what is now the Post and Telegraph Organization (retaining the acronym PTT).|$|R

50|$|Subscriber Trunk Dialling (STD) was {{introduced}} in 1958 to allow a caller to call another telephone directly instead of via a <b>manual</b> <b>telephone</b> exchange operator.

50|$|Not all <b>manual</b> <b>telephone</b> exchanges were non-dialable points.
