40|$|The paperʼs main {{objective}} is to investigate the empirical link between the fiscal balance and the current account. The paper focuses on the EU <b>member</b> <b>states</b> and candidate <b>countries</b> which are according to their different (historical, political, economical and geographical) characteristics divided into two major groups, i. e. old EU <b>member</b> <b>states</b> (EU- 15) and new EU <b>member</b> <b>states</b> and candidate <b>countries</b> (EU 12 + 3) in the 1995 - 2008 period. The empirical results suggest that budget deficits in the EU <b>member</b> <b>states</b> and candidate <b>countries</b> have generally signaled relatively high level of substitutability between private and public savings, implying a relatively low correlation between fiscal and external imbalances. Finally, the paper provides evidence of a relatively higher level of capital mobility in the EU 12 + 3 region, particularly in the second sub-period (2004 - 2008) ...|$|R

A recent survey found that people in new <b>member</b> <b>state</b> <b>countries,</b> especially Latvia, agree that bribery is the easiest way of obtaining certain public services than those in the original EU states. [...] In 1998, a survey posed the following question to Latvian households: [...] "A system whereby people could anonymously report instances of corruption would not be successful because corruption is a natural part of our lives and helps solve many problems". [...] Only 37% of respondents disagreed with the statement. Additionally, Latvia has one of the lowest reporting rates for corruption in the EU, and most Latvians do not believe the government’s anti-corruption efforts are likely to be successful.|$|R
