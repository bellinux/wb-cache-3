5|$|Many {{crocodilians}} are {{hunted for}} their skins, {{but this is}} not the case with the Cuvier's dwarf caiman. This may be because the ventral skin in this species is too heavily armoured to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> tan. Some individuals are killed by indigenous peoples for food and others, particularly in Guyana, are collected for the pet trade; but there is no evidence that populations are dwindling as a result. There are some threats to this species from habitat destruction, including the mining of gold, but these are not thought to be of great significance. The estimated total population is over one million individuals.|$|E
5|$|Mathematically, tessellations can be {{extended}} to spaces other than the Euclidean plane. The Swiss geometer Ludwig Schläfli pioneered this by defining polyschemes, which mathematicians nowadays call polytopes. These are the analogues to polygons and polyhedra in spaces with more dimensions. He further defined the Schläfli symbol notation to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> describe polytopes. For example, the Schläfli symbol for an equilateral triangle is {3}, while that for a square is {4}. The Schläfli notation {{makes it possible to}} describe tilings compactly. For example, a tiling of regular hexagons has three six-sided polygons at each vertex, so its Schläfli symbol is {6,3}.|$|E
5|$|The {{cluster of}} keys {{at the bottom}} of the upper joint (protruding {{slightly}} beyond the cork of the joint) are known as the trill keys and are operated by the right hand. These give the player alternative fingerings that <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> play ornaments and trills. The entire weight of the smaller clarinets is supported by the right thumb behind the lower joint on what is called the thumb-rest. Basset horns and larger clarinets are supported with a neck strap or a floor peg.|$|E
50|$|Aspect-oriented {{programming}} (AOP): AOP <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> factor out technical concerns (such as security, transaction management, logging) from {{a domain}} model, {{and as such}} <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> design and implement domain models that focus purely on the business logic.|$|R
50|$|Proponents claim a {{particular}} language <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> express and understand concepts in one area, {{and more difficult}} in others. An example can be taken from the way various programming languages <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> write certain kinds of programs and harder to write others.|$|R
5000|$|Compared to environments {{where the}} {{programmer}} needs to avoid or work around hazards, {{use of a}} non-pipelined processor may <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> program and to train programmers. The non-pipelined processor also <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> predict the exact timing of a given sequence of instructions.|$|R
5|$|Perl's text-handling {{capabilities}} can be {{used for}} generating SQL queries; arrays, hashes, and automatic memory management <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> collect and process the returned data. For example, in Tim Bunce's Perl DBI application programming interface (API), the arguments to the API can be the text of SQL queries; thus it is possible to program in multiple languages at the same time (e.g., for generating a Web page using HTML, JavaScript, and SQL in a here document). The use of Perl variable interpolation to programmatically customize each of the SQL queries, and the specification of Perl arrays or hashes as the structures to programmatically hold the resulting data sets from each SQL query, allows a high-level mechanism for handling large amounts of data for post-processing by a Perl subprogram.|$|E

25|$|Many casual players use {{a tennis}} ball wrapped in layers of some type of {{adhesive}} tape (often electrical tape), which makes the relatively soft tennis ball harder and smoother. This is {{commonly referred to as}} a tape ball. A common variant is to tape only half the tennis ball, to provide two different sides and <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> bowl with prodigious amounts of swing.|$|E
25|$|Tigrinya has {{a fairly}} typical set of phonemes for an Ethiopian Semitic language. That is, {{there is a}} set of ejective consonants and the usual seven-vowel system. Unlike many of the modern Ethiopian Semitic languages, Tigrinya has {{preserved}} the two pharyngeal consonants. Along with , a velar or uvular ejective fricative, these phonological elements <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> distinguish spoken Tigrinya from closely related languages such as Amharic. However, it is harder to tell from Tigre, as this language has also maintained the pharyngeal consonants.|$|E

25|$|Additionally, {{national}} media {{focus on the}} MEPs/national parties of their own member state, neglecting the group's activities and poorly understanding their structure or even existence. Trans{{national media}} coverage of the groups per se is limited to those organs such as the Parliament itself, or those news media (e.g. EUObserver or theParliament.com) that specialise in the Parliament. These organs cover the groups in detail but with little overarching analysis. So although such organs <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> find out how a group acted on a specific vote, they provide little information on the voting patterns of a specific group.|$|E
25|$|Haya and Ybor {{boarded the}} next {{available}} steamship sailing for Tampa and arrived the next day. They agreed that Tampa {{was an excellent}} location for cigar production: it was near enough to Cuba that importing Cuban tobacco by sea would be quick and cheap; the climate was warm and humid, which would keep the tobacco leaves fresh and workable; and Plant’s new railroad line would <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> ship the finished cigars across the United States. However, Ybor continued negotiating with other cities while opening talks with Tampa’s Board of Trade to secure land and other enticements.|$|E

Over two hundred editions of them have appeared in that time, together with over 2,000 commentaries.

500|$|The name Aspirin {{was derived}} from the name of the {{chemical}} ASA—Acetylspirsäure in German. Spirsäure (salicylic acid) was named for the meadowsweet plant, Spirea ulmaria, from which it could be derived. Aspirin took a- for the acetylation, -spir- from Spirsäure, and added -in as a typical drug name ending to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> say. In the final round of naming proposals that circulated through Bayer, it came down to Aspirin and Euspirin; Aspirin, they feared, might remind customers of aspiration, but Arthur Eichengrün argued that Eu- (meaning [...] "good") was inappropriate because it usually indicated an improvement over an earlier version of a similar drug. Since the substance itself was already known, Bayer intended to use the new name to establish their drug as something new; in January 1899 they settled on Aspirin.|$|E
500|$|In January 1980, the {{producers}} and writers began plotting the culminating episodes for season 3. Executive producer Philip Capice says {{they decided to}} attempt {{to work in a}} ploy to hold interest over the summer. CBS ordered two extra episodes, which gave them a chance to weave many storylines into the scripts. He noted that [...] "J.R. had developed into a character we felt everyone out there wanted to see get his comeuppance. And we did need that sort of a cliffhanger to carry us over to the new season." [...] He said that there was consensus that a mystery with several suspects was optimal and that it should be a sudden event. Capice denied rumors that the shooting was a ploy to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> write Hagman out of the script if his contract negotiations became too difficult. Producer Leonard Katzman, executive story consultant Art Lewis and story editor Camille Marchetta decided the actual culprit in mid-March by process of logical elimination with the belief that the audience should not be surprised by someone who was not important to the show as the shooter.|$|E
