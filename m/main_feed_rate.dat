40|$|This {{research}} was to study effect of milling, which was affected on surface finish of Chromium-Molybdenum steel. Fifty-four pieces of JIS SCM 415 steel was used specimen. The experiment was done by CNC vertical milling machine and cutting tool was PVD coated tungsten carbide tool. The factorial design was applied and factors were consisted of three factors: cutting speed and <b>feed</b> <b>rate</b> and depth of cut that were set in three levels. The results revealed that surface finish was affected by two <b>main</b> factors of <b>feed</b> <b>rate</b> and depth of cut. On the other hand, cutting speed was not significantly main factor. However, interaction between cutting speed, <b>feed</b> <b>rate</b> and depth of cut were factors controlling surface finish.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to achieve the surface finish of 10 nm on a 40 mm {{diameter}} disc of chrome-molybdenum-vanadium alloyed steel (H 13) by using precision grinding process with electrolytic in-process dressing. The machine tool utilized was Tetraform-C, its unique tetrahedral frame offered higher structural stability. A cup grinding wheel with iron bonded CBN abrasive grit of 76 microns average size with 50 % concentration was used. The statistical methods were employed to determine the optimal combination of input parameters to achieve the required response. The <b>main</b> effect of <b>feed</b> <b>rate</b> {{was found to be}} more significant than the depth of cut and lower levels of these factors produced better surface finish.

40|$|We {{combined}} radiotelemetry techniques with {{an automatic}} nest balance system to obtain detailed, concurrent data on foraging activity, prey consumption and foraging performance in four pairs of Shags Phalacrocorax aristotelis during chick rearing on the Isle of May, Scotland. During the study period {{the location of the}} <b>main</b> <b>feeding</b> area changed abruptly from c. 10 km away from the colony (long-range trips, LRT) with return flight times from the feeding area to the colony of 7 - 14 min to c. 0. 8 km away (short-range trips (SRT), return flight times < 3 min). The two feeding areas differed in water depth (LRT dives shallower) and probably also in the size of prey taken. There were significant differences between trip types in almost every aspect of feeding activity recorded. LRT were characterised by high diving efficiency (the proportion of the dive cycle spent foraging) and low <b>feeding</b> <b>rates</b> (mass of prey caught per second foraging). In contrast, diving efficiency was lower and <b>feeding</b> <b>rates</b> were higher for SRT. The gross intake rate (the product of diving efficiency and <b>feeding</b> <b>rate)</b> was significantly higher in SRT than LRT. We suggest that the observed switch in preferred feeding area was caused by the sudden appearance of large numbers of small lesser sandeels Ammodytes marinus in the waters just off the Isle of May. The higher <b>feeding</b> <b>rates</b> attained by birds on SRT could have been due to higher concentrations of prey and/or reduced foraging costs associated with unsuitable habitat for sandeels in this area.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} a complete S-shape <b>feed</b> <b>rate</b> scheduling approach (CSFA) with confined jerk, acceleration and command <b>feed</b> <b>rate</b> for parametric tool path. For a Non-Uniform Rational B-Spline (NURBS) tool path, the critical {{points of the}} tool path where the radius of curvature reaches extreme values are found firstly. Then, the NURBS curve is split into several NURBS sub-curves or blocks by the critical points. A bidirectional scanning strategy with the limitations of chord error, normal/tangential acceleration/jerk and command <b>feed</b> <b>rate</b> is employed to make the <b>feed</b> <b>rate</b> at the junctions between different NURBS blocks continuous. To improve {{the efficiency of the}} <b>feed</b> <b>rate</b> scheduling, the NURBS block is classified into three types: short block, medium block and long block. The <b>feed</b> <b>rate</b> profile corresponding to each NURBS block is generated according to the start/end <b>feed</b> <b>rates</b> and the arc length of the block and the limitations of tangential acceleration/jerk. In addition, two compensation strategies are proposed to make the <b>feed</b> <b>rate</b> more continuous and the arc increment more precise. Once the <b>feed</b> <b>rate</b> profile is determined, a second-order Taylor׳s expansion interpolation method is applied to generate the position commands. Finally, experiments with two free-form NURBS curves are conducted to verify the applicability and accuracy of the proposed method...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to define optimal <b>feeding</b> <b>rates</b> for Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus). Four {{experiments}} were carried out to evaluate the effect of <b>feeding</b> <b>rate</b> on growth performance of larger and juvenile tilapia by means of estimating growth rates, apparent nutrient digestibilities, feed utilization, body compositions, and nutrient and energy retentions. One nutritionally balanced diet (crude protein 342, crude fat 67, ash 47, starch 251 (all values in g (kg dry matter) - 1)) was prepared by extrusion and used in all experiments. The experiments were carried out in a freshwater recirculation system. The temperature was maintained at 25 to 26 oC, pH at 6. 8 and oxygen above 5 mg l- 1. Duplicate tanks were used for each <b>feeding</b> <b>rate</b> treatment. The first experiment was carried out with duration at six weeks, and utilized adult tilapia (258 ± 0. 3 g, mean±SEM). Fishes were fed six times in 24 hr photoperiod at five <b>feeding</b> <b>rates</b> (55, 70, 85, 100 and 115 % where 2. 25 % body weight per day as 100 % satiation). Daily weight gain was predicted assuming that the feed conversion ratio (FCR) was 1. 1 g feed dry matter (DM) intake per g gain. Analysis of variance showed that 55 % <b>feeding</b> <b>rate</b> is like to be proficient for FCR at 1. 01. Energy content of tilapia was significantly higher at 100 - 115 % <b>feeding</b> <b>rate</b> and intermediate at 55 to 85 % <b>feeding</b> <b>rate.</b> Nitrogen retention was significantly higher at limited <b>feeding</b> <b>rate</b> (55 %). Apparent crude protein digestibility was found significantly higher at 100 % satiation and intermediate at 70, 85 and 115 % <b>feeding</b> <b>rate.</b> The estimated optimal <b>feeding</b> <b>rate</b> was at the 55 % level, corresponding to 1. 2 % a day. The second experiment was conducted over a 4 week period with juvenile tilapia (1. 1 ± 0. 02 g) fed 22 times in 24 hr photoperiod at five <b>feeding</b> <b>rates</b> (55, 70, 85, 100 and 115 % where 8 and 6 % body weight per day considered as 100 % satiation for 1 st and 2 nd two week, respectively). FCR was set at 0. 8 g DM intake per g gain. Growth rates were significantly higher at 85 - 115 % <b>feeding</b> <b>rate</b> while FCR (0. 66 to 0. 81) significantly lower at 55 - 85 % <b>feeding</b> <b>rate.</b> Whole-body dry matter, crude protein, crude fat, and energy contents were significantly elevated for the highest <b>feeding</b> <b>rates,</b> while ash was reduced. Nitrogen, phosphorus and energy retentions were significantly lowered at restricted feeding. The estimated optimal <b>feeding</b> <b>rate</b> based on growth rates was 6. 8 % a day for the first 2 weeks and 5. 1 % for the next two weeks. The third experiment was designed with 4 weeks feeding of juvenile tilapia (1. 1 ± 0. 02 g) in accordance with same frequency and photoperiod as same as second experiment. Fishes were fed at four declining and one fixed <b>feeding</b> <b>rate</b> 8 - 16 to 8 and 6 - 14 to 6 % body weight for 1 st and 2 nd two week respectively. Weight gain% and SGR were significantly higher at 10 - 8 and 8 - 6 to 16 - 8 and 14 - 6 % <b>feeding</b> <b>rate</b> while FCR (0. 66 to 0. 71) were significantly lower at 10 - 8 to 8 and 8 - 6 to 6 % <b>feeding</b> <b>rate.</b> Dry matter, crude protein, crude fat, ash and energy content were significantly affected by declining <b>feeding</b> <b>rate</b> and higher than initial body composition. Nitrogen and total phosphorus retentions were significantly higher at lesser feeding regime while energy retention was significantly higher at 12 - 8 and 10 - 6 % <b>feeding</b> <b>rate.</b> The estimated optimal <b>feeding</b> <b>rate</b> based on growth rates was to reduce feeding from 10 to 8 % a day for the first 2 weeks and from 8 to 6 % for the next two weeks. The fourth experiment was carried out at two week duration for larger tilapia (77. 9 ± 0. 03 g). Fishes were fed at five <b>feeding</b> <b>rate</b> (1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 % body weight a day) with same frequency and photoperiod as experiment 2 and 3. FCR was set at 0. 9 g DM intake per g gain. Growth rates were significantly higher at 3 to 5 % <b>feeding</b> <b>rate</b> while FCR (0. 86 to 0. 89) were significantly lower at 1 to 3 % <b>feeding</b> <b>rate.</b> Dry matter and energy content were significantly increased by <b>feeding</b> <b>rate</b> but ash content was significantly decreased as <b>feeding</b> <b>rate</b> increase. Nitrogen retention was significantly higher at 1 - 3 % <b>feeding</b> <b>rate</b> while energy retention at 3 % <b>feeding</b> <b>rate.</b> The estimated optimal <b>feeding</b> <b>rate</b> based on growth rates was 3 % a day.

The ternary mixtures belong to the common 1. 0 - 1 a and 1. 0 - 2 class ternary diagrams, each with two sub-cases depending on the univolatility line location. The column has three sections, rectifying, extractive and stripping. Differential equations are derived for each section composition, depending on operating parameters: distillate product purity and recovery, reflux ratio R and entrainer – <b>feed</b> flow <b>rate</b> ratio FE/F for the heavy case; bottom product purity and recovery, reboil ratio and entrainer – <b>feed</b> flow <b>rate</b> ratio for the light entrainer case. For the case with a heavy entrainer fed as a boiling liquid above the <b>main</b> <b>feed,</b> the feasible product and operating parameters R and FE/F ranges are assessed under infinite reflux ratio conditions by using the general feasibility criterion enounced by Rodriguez-Donis et al. (Ind. Eng. Chem. Res, 2009, 48 (7), 3544 – 3559). For the 1. 0 - 1 a class, there exists a minimum entrainer - <b>feed</b> flow <b>rate</b> ratio to recover the product, and also a minimum reflux ratio. The minimum entrainer - <b>feed</b> flow <b>rate</b> ratio is higher for the continuous process than for the batch because of the additional requirement in continuous mode that the stripping profile intersects with the extractive profile. For the 1. 0 - 2 class both A and B can be distillated. For one of them there exists a maximum entrainer - <b>feed</b> flow <b>rate</b> ratio. The continuous process also has a minimum entrainer - <b>feed</b> flow <b>rate</b> ratio limit for a given feasible reflux ratio. For the case with a light entrainer fed as saturated vapor below the <b>main</b> <b>feed,</b> the feasible product and operating parameters S and FE/F ranges are assessed under infinite reflux ratio conditions by using the general feasibility criterion enounced by Rodriguez-Donis et al.

In this work, the drilling was conducted using uncoated carbide tool with diameter of 4 ± 0. 01 mm with point angle of 135 ° and helix angle of 30 °. The drilling was done at different levels of spindle speed (18 and 30 mmin- 1) and <b>feed</b> <b>rate</b> (0. 03, 0. 045 and 0. 06 mmrev- 1). Austenitic stainless steel AISI 316 L was the workpiece material. Comparatives analysis was done on hole diameter, roundness, cylindricity, and surface roughness of the drilled holes by experimentation. From the result, the hole quality characteristics are mostly influenced by cutting speed and <b>feed</b> <b>rate.</b> An exception was for circularity error where a two tail t-test for circularity error indicates that cutting speed and <b>feed</b> <b>rate</b> give no significant influence on circularity error. As the cutting speed increases, the surface roughness decreases (1. 09 μm). Contrary, when the <b>feed</b> <b>rate</b> increases, the surface roughness value increases as well. For cylindricity error, lower cutting speed and lower <b>feed</b> <b>rate</b> will give better result. In terms of diameter error, <b>feed</b> <b>rate</b> influences more than cutting speed. Minimum diameter error was achieved when low cutting speed and low <b>feed</b> <b>rate</b> were employed...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to assess the effect of different levels of dietary intake and feeding frequencies on growth and survival of bigheadcarp, Aristichthys nobilis, fry. The <b>feeding</b> <b>rates</b> consisted of 10 %, 20 %, and 30 % of body weight while feeding frequencies were one, three, and five times daily. Results showed that final weight, final length, and specific growth rate (SGR) differed in relation to <b>feeding</b> <b>rate</b> but not to feeding frequency. Highest values were obtained for fish on the 30 % ration and fed once a day. A significant effect of higher <b>feeding</b> <b>rate</b> using lower <b>feeding</b> frequency on growth was manifested in final mean weight and SGR; increasing <b>feeding</b> <b>rate</b> resulted in increased growth. Feeding frequency significantly influenced fry survival with highest values observed when fry were fed once or three times per day. Highest survivals were achieved by fry on the 30 % ration fed once daily. At higher <b>feeding</b> <b>rates</b> using lesser <b>feeding</b> frequencies better survival was noted. Survival rate had an inverse relationship to feeding frequency, but no overall relationship existed between <b>feeding</b> <b>rate</b> and survival rate. Both ration and feeding frequency significantly influenced normalized biomass index (NBI). Highest values were again obtained on the 30 % ration and feeding once daily. Higher NBI values were observed with higher <b>feeding</b> <b>rates</b> at lower <b>feeding</b> frequencies. Increasing ration resulted in a corresponding increase in NBI...|$|R

30|$|It is also {{interesting}} to note that at 0.4  mm nose radius, when the <b>feed</b> <b>rate</b> increases from 0.16 to 0.32  mm/rev, the average of the surface roughness is decreased from 8.32 to 6.93  μm, while at other nose radii, there is no such complicated behavior. As a result, {{it can be said that}} the effect of the <b>feed</b> <b>rate</b> on the variations of the surface roughness, especially at high-level <b>feed</b> <b>rates,</b> strongly depends on the insert nose radius.|$|R
30|$|Results {{demonstrated}} that standardised food preparation and storage {{can reduce the}} variability of the <b>feeding</b> <b>rate</b> of G. pulex in laboratory studies (Figure  1, food quality) which would increase the potential for detecting stressor-related effects ex situ. Within this experiment, a maximal reduction of the variability in <b>feeding</b> <b>rate</b> by 38 % was found when data were distinguished by food quality. The higher the food quality and thus the <b>feeding</b> <b>rate,</b> the lower the variability (Figure  1, food quality).|$|R
50|$|Generally speaking, spindle {{speeds and}} <b>feed</b> <b>rates</b> are less {{critical}} in woodworking than metalworking.

5000|$|In woodworking, {{the ideal}} <b>feed</b> <b>rate</b> {{is one that}} is slow enough not to bog down the motor, yet fast enough to avoid burning the material. Certain woods, such as black cherry and maple are more prone to burning than others. The right <b>feed</b> <b>rate</b> is usually {{obtained}} by [...] "feel" [...] if the material is hand fed, or by trial and error if a power feeder is used. In thicknessers (planers), the wood is usually fed automatically through rubber or corrugated steel rollers. Some of these machines allow varying the <b>feed</b> <b>rate,</b> usually by changing pulleys. A slower <b>feed</b> <b>rate</b> usually results in a finer surface as more cuts are made for any length of wood.|$|R
