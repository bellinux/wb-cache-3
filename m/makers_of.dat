50|$|There is some {{confusion}} about Jacquard’s early work history. British economist Sir John Bowring met Jacquard, who told Bowring {{that at one}} time he had been a <b>maker</b> <b>of</b> straw hats. Eymard claimed that before becoming involved in the weaving of silk, Jacquard was a type-founder (a <b>maker</b> <b>of</b> printers’ type), a soldier, a bleacher (blanchisseur) of straw hats, and a lime burner (a <b>maker</b> <b>of</b> lime for mortar). Barlow claims that before marrying, Jacquard had worked for a bookbinder, a type-founder, and a <b>maker</b> <b>of</b> cutlery. After marrying, Jacquard tried cutlery making, type-founding, and weaving. However, Barlow does not cite any sources for that information. Ballot stated that Jacquard initially helped his father operate his loom, but the work proved too arduous, so Jacquard was placed first with a bookbinder and then with a <b>maker</b> <b>of</b> printers' type.|$|R

5|$|Also in {{the early}} 1980s, several studies {{suggested}} a link between children's consumption of aspirin and Reye's syndrome, a potentially fatal disease. By 1986, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration required warning labels on all aspirin, further suppressing sales. The <b>makers</b> <b>of</b> Tylenol also {{filed a lawsuit against}} Anacin aspirin maker American Home Products, claiming that the failure to add warning labels before 1986 had unfairly held back Tylenol sales, though this suit was eventually dismissed.|$|E
5|$|By 11,000 BC, the <b>makers</b> <b>of</b> {{the long}} blades had gone.
