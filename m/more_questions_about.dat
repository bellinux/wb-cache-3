5|$|In the meantime, Hari {{gets his}} son Sankarshan (Saksham Kulkarni) married. Once Hari finds Uma sitting outside {{the room of}} the newly married couple, {{listening}} to their playful banter. Disgusted by Uma's behaviour, Hari starts avoiding her. Upset by this behaviour, Uma tries to talk her heart out to Hari's friend Balwant (Sanjay Khapre) and requests him {{to find out the}} reason. Coincidentally, Hari overhears this and severs his relations with Balwant. Unaware of the reason for Hari's changed behaviour, Uma starts staying aloof, while her health starts degrading. Worried Sankarshan requests his sister Shanti (Manava Naik) to talk to Uma. Frustrated and unknowing of what loss she had throughout her life, Uma opens her heart but situation raises <b>more</b> <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> her relation with Hari.|$|E

25|$|To begin, affective {{emotions}} {{and the effect}} infidelity has on affective jealousy. Both {{men and women alike}} feel some kind of jealousy when they suspect their significant other is being unfaithful (Johnson, 2017). If some individual suspects {{that he or she is}} being cheated on they begin to question their partners actions and may possibly act in more frustrated ways towards them than they normally would. For example, they may ask <b>more</b> <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> the whereabouts of their partner or get upset more frequently and more often whenever they feel that their partner is lying or going out without them. Bursts of frustration without thinking it through or realizing why an individual is having those emotions can be an affective response in a difficult situation. The affective use of jealousy in a seemingly unfaithful relationship is caused by the accusing partner anticipating the infidelity from the other.|$|E
25|$|Although Goddard {{had brought}} {{his work in}} {{rocketry}} {{to the attention of}} the United States Army, between World Wars, he was rebuffed, since the Army largely failed to grasp the military application of large rockets and said there was no money for new experimental weapons. German military intelligence, by contrast, had paid attention to Goddard's work. The Goddards noticed that some mail had been opened, and some mailed reports had gone missing. An accredited military attaché to the US, Friedrich von Boetticher, sent a four-page report to the Abwehr in 1936, and the spy Gustav Guellich sent a mixture of facts and made-up information, claiming to have visited Roswell and witnessed a launch. The Abwehr was very interested and responded with <b>more</b> <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> Goddard's work. Guellich's reports did include information about fuel mixtures and the important concept of fuel-curtain cooling, but thereafter the Germans received very little information about Goddard.|$|E

After this, Tendulkar endured the longest spell {{of his career}} without a Test century: 17innings elapsed before he scored 101 against Bangladesh in May 2007. Tendulkar scored his 39th ODI hundred on 6 February 2006 in a match against Pakistan. He {{followed}} with a 42 in the second One-Day International against Pakistan on 11 February 2006, and then a 95 in hostile, seaming conditions on 13 February 2006 in Lahore, which set up an Indian victory. On 19 March 2006, after being dismissed for only one run against England in the first innings of the third Test in his home ground, Wankhede, Tendulkar was booed off the ground by {{a section of the}} crowd, {{the first time that he}} had ever faced such flak. Tendulkar ended the three-Test series without a half-century to his credit, and the need for a shoulder operation raised <b>more</b> <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> his longevity.|$|E

500|$|The Bill of Rights {{originally}} only {{restricted the}} federal government, {{and went through}} a long initial phase of [...] "judicial dormancy"; {{in the words of}} historian Gordon S. Wood, [...] "After ratification, most Americans promptly forgot about the first ten amendments to the Constitution." [...] Federal jurisdiction regarding criminal law was narrow until the late 19th century when the Interstate Commerce Act and Sherman Antitrust Act were passed. As federal criminal jurisdiction expanded to include other areas such as narcotics, <b>more</b> <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> the Fourth Amendment came to the Supreme Court. The U.S. Supreme Court responded to these questions by outlining the fundamental purpose of the amendment as guaranteeing [...] "the privacy, dignity and security of persons against certain arbitrary and invasive acts by officers of the Government, without regard to whether the government actor is investigating crime or performing another function." [...] In Mapp v. Ohio (1961), the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the Fourth Amendment applies to the states by way of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.|$|E
500|$|Paul Schrodt of Slant Magazine {{was more}} {{critical}} in his review, though {{he gave it}} a 2.5star (out of 4) rating. While he positively called Gaga's performances outrageous and [...] "occasionally fierce", he questioned Gaga's authenticity, both on stage and in the pre-concert scenes. Ultimately, he wrote, [...] "Unsurprisingly, HBO's Lady Gaga Presents the Monster Ball Tour: At Madison Square Garden raises <b>more</b> <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> Stefani Germanotta (Gaga's birth name) than it answers, which is probably as it should be." [...] Radio host Howard Stern also compared the black-and-white scenes of the special to Madonna: Truth or Dare, adding that when he darts a glance at Lady Gaga, she is occasionally registered in his brain as Madonna. On his show, Stern was also critical of inappropriateness and unreasonability of the numerous speeches Gaga gave between the songs in the special, calling them [...] "", [...] "drivel", and [...] "condescending". Dedicating over {{half an hour of}} his show on May 9 and 10, 2011, to express his criticism of the concert, Stern compared the manner of Gaga's speaking to professional wrestling due to echoing, Gaga's gasping between the words, and the audience's arguable inability to hear the words enough to understand them. In particular, Gaga claimed in the concert that her incentive to work is to [...] "set [...] free", not money. Stern attempted to debunk that claim by arguing that Gaga takes potentially psychiatric problems of her audience lightly by urging her fans to [...] "forget all of [...] insecurities" [...] overnight.|$|E

[...] The university stated that there were [...] "serious cultural issues and an environment conducive to sexual harassment within the Marching Band", and that the band director [...] "was aware or reasonably should have known about" [...] it. Waters has sued for reinstatement, accusing the university, Drake, and a provost of discriminating against him by disciplining him differently than a female employee and denying him due process. To date, Drake has stood by his decision to terminate Waters as marching band director.
