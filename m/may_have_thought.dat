5|$|The vessel's only passenger, Robert Stubbs, was {{a former}} captain of slave ships. In early 1780 he was {{appointed}} by the African Committee of the Royal African Company, as the governor of Anomabu, a British fortification near Cape Coast Castle in Ghana. This position made him also vice-president of the RAC Council of the Castle. Due to his ineptitude and enmity incurred with John Roberts, governor of the Castle, Stubbs was {{forced out of the}} governorship of Anomabu by the RAC Council after nine months. Witness statements gathered by the African Committee of the RAC, accused him of being a semi-literate drunkard who mismanaged the slave-trading activities of the fort. Stubbs was aboard to return to Britain; Collingwood <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>thought</b> his earlier experience on slave ships would be useful.|$|E
5|$|There {{are three}} reasons put forth {{as to why}} Dickinson and the Pennsylvania Council did not act. The Council's {{official}} reasoning {{was that they were}} unsure that the local militiamen would actually protect Congress from their fellow soldiers. Further, the council <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>thought</b> that the conflict was not as serious as Congress believed and that the mutiny could be resolved peacefully. The second theory put forth is that Dickinson, having been an officer in the militia, was sympathetic to the soldiers' grievances. The third theory is that the Council refused to allow Pennsylvania, a sovereign state, to be subjugated by the demands of a few members of Congress.|$|E
5|$|Maibaum <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>thought</b> the {{eventual}} oil-rig finale a poor substitute, {{but it was}} originally intended {{to be much more}} spectacular. Armed frogmen would jump from the helicopters into the sea and attach limpet mines to the rig's legs (this explains why frogmen appear on the movie's poster). Blofeld would have escaped in his BathoSub and Bond would have pursued him, hanging from a weather balloon. The chase would have continued across a salt mine, with the two mortal enemies scrambling over white hills of salt before Blofeld would fall to his death in a salt granulator. Permission was not granted by the owners of the salt mine. It also made the sequence too long. Further problems followed when the explosives set up for the finale were set off too early; fortunately, a handful of cameras were ready and able to capture the footage.|$|E

5|$|Stephen {{responded by}} {{promptly}} moving south, besieging Arundel and trapping Matilda inside the castle. Stephen then {{agreed to a}} truce proposed by his brother, Henry of Blois; the full details of the agreement are not known, but the results were that Matilda and her household of knights were released from the siege and escorted to the south-west of England, where they were reunited with Robert of Gloucester. The reasons for Matilda's release remain unclear. Stephen <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>thought</b> {{it was in his}} own best interests to release the Empress and concentrate instead on attacking Robert, seeing Robert, rather than Matilda, as his main opponent {{at this point in the}} conflict. Arundel Castle was also considered almost impregnable, and Stephen may have been worried that he risked tying down his army in the south whilst Robert roamed freely in the west. Another theory is that Stephen released Matilda out of a sense of chivalry; Stephen had a generous, courteous personality and women were not normally expected to be targeted in Anglo-Norman warfare.|$|E
5|$|Thi {{publicly}} disassociated {{himself from}} the Struggle Movement. However, he remained in I Corps and was still regarded as a significant political influence and motivating factor for the Struggle Movement. Regardless of what he <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>thought,</b> the discontent against Kỳ was by then {{too much for him}} to control even if he had wanted to. By June, ARVN loyalists, {{with the help of the}} American forces, prevailed. Their superior numbers convinced many in the Struggle Movement to back down and realign with the government, and those who refused were militarily defeated, often in bitter street-to-street fighting. While the Struggle Movement was finally ebbing away, Thi agreed to meet with Kỳ at an American air base in Chu Lai to reach a settlement, seeing as the junta was going to prevail in any case. Thi agreed to the original offers of subsidies and the cover story of a medical trip.|$|E

25|$|During the First Transjordan {{attack in}} April 1918, when Allenby {{employed}} infantry from the 60th (London) Division, the Anzac Mounted Division and the Imperial Camel Corps Brigade {{in an attack}} on Amman, the German, Austrian and Ottoman forces demonstrated they were still capable of winning battles. And during the five weeks {{between the first and}} second Transjordan operations they demonstrated a substantial measure of recovery at Tulkarem, offensive tendencies in the upper Jordan Valley, and had created a strong defensive position at Shunet Nimrin which withstood all attacks. This already formidable enemy force was further strengthened with reinforcements said to number twice that faced during the first Transjordan operations and had been put on the alert by the demonstration on 18 April. It is therefore hard to understand how Allenby concluded that Chauvel's force was strong enough to carry out its mission. Allenby <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>thought</b> German and Ottoman reinforcements would not, or could not in the time, transfer troops across the Jordan River; he <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>thought</b> that the better weather would enable his troops to move more rapidly which was indeed true, but German and Ottoman forces also benefited and it seems Allenby placed too much reliance on the Beni Sakhr.|$|E

25|$|Braies {{were usually}} {{fitted with a}} front flap that was buttoned or tied closed. This codpiece allowed men to urinate without having to remove the braies completely. Codpieces were also worn with hose when very short {{doublets}} – vest- (UK: waistcoat-) like garments tied together {{in the front and}} worn under other clothing – were in fashion, as early forms of hose were open at the crotch. Henry VIII of England began padding his codpiece, which caused a spiralling trend of larger and larger codpieces that only ended {{by the end of the}} 16th century. It has been speculated that the King may have had the sexually transmitted disease syphilis, and his large codpiece may have included a bandage soaked in medication to relieve its symptoms. Henry VIII also wanted a healthy son and <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>thought</b> that projecting himself in this way would portray fertility. Codpieces were sometimes used as a pocket for holding small items.|$|E
25|$|Once the Khazars {{emerged as}} a power, the Byzantines also began to form alliances with them, dynastic and military. In 695, the last Heraclian emperor, Justinian II, nicknamed the slit-nosed (ὁ ῥινότμητος) after he was {{mutilated}} and deposed, was exiled to Cherson in the Crimea, where a Khazar governor (tudun) presided. He escaped into Khazar territory in 704 or 705 and was given asylum by qağan Busir Glavan (Ἰβουζήρος Γλιαβάνος), who gave him his sister in marriage, perhaps {{in response to an}} offer by Justinian, who <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>thought</b> a dynastic marriage would seal by kinship a powerful tribal support for his attempts to regain the throne. The Khazarian spouse thereupon changed her name to Theodora. Busir was offered a bribe by the Byzantine usurper, Tiberius III, to kill Justinian. Warned by Theodora, Justinian escaped, murdering two Khazar officials in the process. He fled to Bulgaria, whose Khan Tervel helped him regain the throne. Upon his reinstalment, and despite Busir's treachery during his exile, he sent for Theodora; Busir complied, and she was crowned as Augusta, suggesting that both prized the alliance.|$|E

25|$|In 23 BC, Augustus (as Octavian {{now called}} himself) again {{attempted}} {{to reform the}} constitution, {{although it is not}} known why he chose to reform the constitution at this point. Four years had passed since his last reforms, and this may have given him the opportunity to discover the weaknesses in those reforms. In addition, he almost died in 23 BC, and thus he <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>thought</b> that his time left was short. To Augustus, one major weakness in his constitution was his status as Consul. While it is true that his prestige minimized the risk of obstruction {{at the hands of a}} co-Consul, this risk still existed. It was also unusual (and unprecedented) for an individual to be elected to the Consulship nine times in a row, as Augustus had been. In addition, tradition did subject the Consulship to certain restrictions, such as the traditional etiquette shown by the two Consuls towards each other. While Augustus did consider the possibility to making himself sole Consul, he realized that this was too radical of a departure from tradition. Therefore, as a 'concession', he gave up his Consulship, and modified both his Proconsular imperium and his Tribunician powers. It is not known exactly how Augustus modified his Proconsular imperium, but it is known that he was allowed to retain this imperium in the city of Rome. Normally, any magistrate had to surrender their imperium while they were inside the city. In addition, his Proconsular imperium was formally modified to give him both a status and an authority above even a Consul.|$|E

This charter is thought by some historians to be spurious, mainly because the witness list and wording of the charter are, {{in the words of}} Alex Woolf, [...] "suspiciously similar" [...] to those in a genuine charter of Domhnall's son Aonghus Mór. Presumably, the explanation is that the monks of Paisley Abbey at some later stage <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>thought</b> it in their interest to replicate Aonghus Mór's charter in order to add the authority of the founder of Clan Donald to their land rights.|$|E

On 9 June 1605, {{he was to be}} found in a room on Thames Street in London, with Robert Catesby. [...] In the midst of what Garnet later recalled was a seemingly casual conversation, Catesby asked the priest about the morality of [...] "killing innocents".
