5|$|Indigenous peoples {{living in}} northeastern North America {{were the first}} groups known to have {{produced}} maple syrup and maple sugar. According to aboriginal oral traditions, as well as archaeological evidence, <b>maple</b> <b>tree</b> sap was being processed into syrup long before Europeans arrived in the region. There are no authenticated accounts of how maple syrup production and consumption began, but various legends exist; {{one of the most}} popular involves maple sap being used in place of water to cook venison served to a chief. Other stories credit the development of maple syrup production to Nanabozho, Glooskap, or the squirrel. Aboriginal tribes developed rituals around sugar-making, celebrating the Sugar Moon (the first full moon of spring) with a Maple Dance. Many aboriginal dishes replaced the salt traditional in European cuisine with maple sugar or syrup.|$|E

500|$|The Canadian {{provinces of}} Manitoba and Saskatchewan produce maple syrup using the sap {{of the box}} elder or Manitoba maple (Acer negundo). [...] A Manitoba maple tree's yield is usually {{less than half that}} of a similar sugar <b>maple</b> <b>tree.</b> Manitoba maple syrup has a {{slightly}} different flavour from sugar-maple syrup, because it contains less sugar and the tree's sap flows more slowly.|$|E

500|$|... {{the only}} extant {{remnant of the}} bygone natives is a large <b>maple</b> <b>tree</b> called the [...] "Pow Wow Tree", which is listed as an Oregon Heritage Tree. The tree still stands at Clackamas Boulevard, and {{is said to have}} marked the place where the {{different}} native tribes, mainly Clackamas and Multnomahs, met to make trading agreements, settle community affairs, and conduct wedding ceremonies. In 1860, the Pow-Wow Tree was the location set for the first Clackamas County Fair. The following year, it was used as a parade ring for the first Oregon State Fair and marked the entrance. In 1937, the tree itself was celebrated with the Gladstone Pow-Wow Festival.|$|E
500|$|Alexander H. Smith related a {{story of}} how unique {{circumstances}} {{led to the development}} of a local superstition about the species:... the members of a family here in Ann Arbor were poisoned, some fatally, as the result of eating caps of a species of Amanita. The next year Volvaria bombycina fruited on a <b>maple</b> <b>tree</b> at the home of these people, and the story was circulated that some of the spores of the poisonous fungus, which caused the deaths the year before, had escaped from the house, lodged in the tree, germinated, grew and were now producing fruiting bodies. Consequently the carpophores of the Volvaria were held in great awe by the neighbors, and soon came to be referred to as the [...] "ghost mushroom". No one, of course, would consider eating them.|$|E
500|$|Maples {{are usually}} tapped {{beginning}} at 30 to 40 years of age. Each tree can support {{between one and}} three taps, depending on its trunk diameter. The average <b>maple</b> <b>tree</b> will produce [...] of sap per season, up to [...] per day. This is roughly equal to 7% of its total sap. Seasons last for four to eight weeks, depending on the weather. During the day, starch stored in the roots for the winter rises through the trunk as sugary sap, allowing it to be tapped. Sap is not tapped at night because the temperature drop inhibits sap flow, although taps are typically left in place overnight. Some producers also tap in autumn, though this practice is less common than spring tapping. Maples can continue to be tapped for sap until they are over 100 years old.|$|E

500|$|The tornado {{maintained}} EF2 intensity as {{it quickly}} tracked across the Mississippi [...] Tennessee state line and into southeastern portions of Memphis, where WREG tower cameras broadcast live {{footage of the}} tornado moving through the southeastern parts of Memphis, producing multiple bright blue power flashes along the way. By this point, the National Weather Service issued a Tornado Emergency (the first of five to be issued during the outbreak) {{for most of the}} Memphis metropolitan area. The tornado produced an extensive swath of damage as it moved through residential and commercial areas. Considerable damage was reported at Memphis International Airport, where a hangar lost its roof, the FedEx freight terminal's fire station suffered roof damage, airstair trucks were thrown 100yards (91m), and aircraft were moved around, including a Boeing 737 that was moved one foot. FedEx service was disrupted due to flight delays and closed roads, all because of the tornado damage in surrounding areas. The airport weather station's reporting equipment recorded a wind gust of 73knots (84mph, 135km/h). In the Clarke Road area, tractor trailers were tossed around, a power substation was severely damaged, and several warehouse structures sustained heavy damage. This included a DSC warehouse that was destroyed, killing three people inside. Numerous windows were shattered at the Willow Lake Business Park, and utility poles and trees were snapped in the area. Multiple homes along <b>Maple</b> <b>Tree</b> Drive and Pinbranch Court were damaged, five of which sustained major damage. The Hardy Bottling Company facility was also damaged, which released 120,000pounds (54,500kg) of anhydrous ammonia into the atmosphere, although no public health impacts were reported. Continuing northeast, the tornado weakened to EF1 strength and struck the Hickory Ridge Mall, resulting in total collapse of a large wall and much of the roof at the Sears department store. Damage surveyors noted very poor construction at this location, and six people in the mall were injured. Cars and semi-trailers near the mall were flipped and damaged as well. A Taco Bell and a few other businesses were damaged along Winchester Road before the tornado dissipated. Numerous trees and power poles were snapped along much of the tornado's path through Southaven and Memphis, and electricity supply to about 65,000 customers was briefly cut.|$|E
2500|$|One of the college's many traditions is [...] "sampling" [...] sap {{from the}} city of Goshen's {{official}} <b>Maple</b> <b>Tree,</b> located on campus, and [...] "testing" [...] how many more weeks of winter there will be.

In 2006, the <b>maple</b> <b>tree</b> was removed because of disease rotting the hardwood and was replaced by a new tree, now the official <b>maple</b> <b>tree</b> of Goshen. In 2007, new president Jim Brenneman replaced this tradition (which probably resulted in the early death of the maple) with [...] "Weather or Not Day"; a day celebrating Northern Indiana's fickle weather.|$|E

A spokesperson for the Bank of Canada stated that the design was [...] "a stylized blend of different Canadian maple species". The 2009 focus group report stated {{that the image of}} the train on the $10 banknote was attractive but uninspiring and outdated, and drew complaints from people in Atlantic Canada where many [...] "railway links have been decommissioned".|$|E

2500|$|While {{inspecting}} {{the roof of}} his clinic in 1940, Hayes slipped and fell, and died shortly thereafter. [...] His heirs sold the clinic and house to Charles and Alice Davis in 1940, and the Davises in turn sold the clinic (but not the house) to Stone in 1943. [...] Stone immediately began expanding the building. [...] He hired a brick-mason named Joe Chittum and mobilized idle nurses and relatives to mix mortar and aide in bricklaying. [...] By 1946, the building rose five stories at its highest point. [...] As the building continued to grow, Stone modified its design to fit around an old <b>Maple</b> <b>tree</b> growing on the lot, giving the building's northeast corner its awkward appearance. [...] The building's central six-story tower, completed in 1949, briefly served as a Civil Defense lookout for the nearby atomic energy installations at Oak Ridge.|$|E
