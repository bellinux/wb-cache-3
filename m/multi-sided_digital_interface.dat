The communication includes voice over internet protocol (VoIP), telephone conference, video conference or text-based chat. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for a device for protection of integrity and/or non-repudiability of a time-critical, <b>multi-sided,</b> <b>digital,</b> packet-based communication between two persons and/or machines. USE - Used for protection of integrity and/or non-repudiability of a time-critical, <b>multi-sided,</b> <b>digital,</b> packet-based communication e. g. voice over internal protocol, telephone conference, video conference and text-based chat, between two persons and/or machines in a package-based, digital voice communication field. ADVANTAGE - The method permits efficient and smooth integration into a secure Internet protocol (SIP) and real-time transport protocol (RTP), and efficient utilization of a main memory, band width, storage requirement and computing load...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to improve the low service {{efficiency}} and unsmooth human-computer interaction caused by currently irrational layouts of <b>digital</b> <b>interfaces</b> for complex systems. Also, three common layout structures for <b>digital</b> <b>interfaces</b> are to be presented and five layout types appropriate for multilevel <b>digital</b> <b>interfaces</b> are to be summarized. Based on the eye tracking technology, an assessment was conducted in advantages and disadvantages of different layout types through subjects’ search efficiency. Based on data and results, this study constructed a matching model which is appropriate for multilevel <b>digital</b> <b>interface</b> layout and verified the fact that the task element is a significant and important aspect of layout design. A scientific experimental model of research on <b>digital</b> <b>interfaces</b> for complex systems is provided. Both data and conclusions of the eye movement experiment provide a reference for layout designs of interfaces for complex systems with different task characteristics...|$|R

40|$|My thesis {{proposes a}} {{critical}} {{framework for understanding}} the <b>digital</b> <b>interface</b> in interactive new media installations. I aim at dispelling the instrumental, cybernetic, “action-reaction” myth that surrounds {{the functions of the}} interface and that constitutes one of the main limitations in its conceptualization today. I argue that a rethinking of the <b>digital</b> <b>interface</b> in terms of its aesthetic and cultural properties is essential if we are to take <b>digital</b> <b>interfaces</b> seriously as devices that inform or even, to some extent, structure our relationship with technology. Theorists who work in the interdisciplinary field of interface studies have historically been preoccupied with the technical and instrumental functions the interface performs – specifically with how it acts and reacts to pre-programmed information. To do this, they have predominantly drawn on computer science and engineering perspectives. Thus <b>digital</b> <b>interfaces</b> have commonly been understood as the symbolic software that enables humans to use computers. My thesis approaches the <b>digital</b> <b>interface</b> from a different direction, concentrating on the aesthetic and cultural aspects of the <b>digital</b> <b>interface,</b> and drawing on scholarship from the fields of art history and media studies. In particular, I focus on critically examining how various interfaces are defined within art environments and how they influence the way subjects, objects, and the relationships and processes that exist between them are understood in these disciplinary fields and practices. Throughout, I propose a more expansive definition of the <b>digital</b> <b>interface</b> in interactive new media installations, positioning it as a dynamic, hybrid, aesthetic and cultural process. I thus reformulate the problem of the <b>digital</b> <b>interface</b> as a problem of making the often invisible aspects of the device legible. Ultimately, I argue that the interface mediates, thus creates, to an extent, relationships between viewer/participants, artists and artworks as well as influences the movements and perceptions of those interacting with it. This reading enables me to conclude that the <b>digital</b> <b>interface</b> can be seen as an important actor in positioning and (re) shaping specific ways in which the self relates to technology, to artistic practice and to other human and nonhuman beings in the current media culture. At the heart of this thesis is the notion that the <b>digital</b> <b>interface</b> matters and that a critical exploration of it in aesthetic contexts can help us understand and possibly reconfigure our human relationship with technology...|$|R
