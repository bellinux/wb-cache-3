40|$|An {{important}} element of the <b>macro-prudential</b> <b>analysis</b> {{is the study of}} the link between business cycle fluctuations and banking sector profitability and how this link is affected by institutional and structural characteristics. This work estimates a set of equations for net interest income, non-interest income, operating costs, provisions, and profit before taxes, for banks in the main industrialized countries and evaluates the effects on banking profitability of shocks to both macroeconomic and financial factors. Distinguishing mainly the euro area from Anglo-Saxon countries, the analysis also identifies differences in the resilience of the respective banking systems and relates them to the characteristics of their financial structure.

40|$|Theoretically optimal {{responses}} of banks to various liquidity and solvency shocks are modelled. The proposed framework {{is based on}} a risk-adjusted return portfolio choice in multiple periods subject to the default risk related either to liquidity or solvency problems. Performance of the model and sensitivity of optimal balance sheet structures to some key parameters of the model are illustrated in a specific calibrated setup. The results of the simulations shed light on the effectiveness of the liquidity and solvency regulation. The flexible implementation of the model and its semi-analytical solvability allows for various easy applications of the framework for the <b>macro-prudential</b> policy <b>analysis...</b>|$|R
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} <b>macro-prudential</b> {{financial}} soundness <b>analysis</b> {{that can be}} used by most developing and transformation countries with or without crisis experience as well as by developed countries with limited data. The objective is to detect economic and financial sector vulnerability, design appropriate remedial policy responses and undertake preventing actions to address vulnerabilities. The paper also discusses a process for identifying and compiling a set of leading macro-prudential indicators. The system will be tested using a case study referring to Kazakhstan. The main novelty of the study lies in designing composite indicators for the real economy, the banking sector, the overall financial sector and finally the international economic environment of Kazakhstan and in studying the interaction of these composite indicators. An additional innovation is the relatively extensive use of qualitative business survey data to monitor vulnerability or crises; these surveys are data which until now have not been used much in this area of research. banking crisis, leading indicators, Kazakhstan...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{concerns}} <b>macro-prudential</b> <b>analysis.</b> It uses an unrestricted VAR {{model to}} empirically investigate transmission involving {{a set of}} macroeconomic variables describing {{the development of the}} Czech economy and the functioning of its credit channel in the past eleven years. Its novelty {{lies in the fact that}} it provides the first systematic assessment of the links between loan quality and macroeconomic shocks in the Czech context. The VAR methodology is applied to monthly data transformed into percentage change. The out-of-sample forecast indicates that the most likely outlook for the quality of the banking sector's loan portfolio is that up to the end of 2006 the share of non-performing loans in it will follow a slightly downward trend below double-digit rates. The impulse response is augmented by stress testing exercises that enable us to determine a macroeconomic early warning signal of any worsening in the quality of banks' loans. The paper suggests that the Czech banking sector has attained a considerable ability to withstand a credit risk shock and that the banking sector's stability is compatible both with price stability and with economic growth. Despite being devoted to empirical investigation, the paper pays great attention to methodological issues. At the same time it tries to present both the VAR model and its results transparently and to openly discuss their weak points, which to a large degree can be attributed to data constraints or to the evolutionary nature of an economy in transition.

40|$|This paper {{compares the}} effectiveness, {{efficiency}} and robustness of standard and non-standard monetary policy tools, {{such as the}} banks ’ refinancing interest rate, penalty interest rate on deposit facility holdings and minimum reserve requirements on attracted deposits. The assessment is performed {{on the basis of}} a numerically evaluated open economy general equilibrium model for <b>macro-prudential</b> <b>analysis</b> where optimal decisions by internationally linked banks are key determinants of international financial flows and wider economic outcomes. Banks differ in terms of balance sheet endowments and risk preferences, and take decisions rationally and competitively. Default risk, borrowing and lending are endogenous results of individual decisions of private agents (banks and households), as well as systemic outcomes of market interaction. JEL: Keywords...|$|E
40|$|This paper tests {{financial}} contagion due to interbank linkages. For identification we exploit an idiosyncratic, sudden shock {{caused by}} a large-bank failure in conjunction with detailed data on interbank exposures. First, we find robust evidence that higher interbank exposure to the failed bank leads to large deposit withdrawals. Second, the magnitude of contagion is higher for banks with weaker fundamentals. Third, interbank linkages among surviving banks further propagate the shock. Finally, we find results suggesting that there are real economic effects. These results suggest that interbank linkages act as an important channel of contagion and hold important policy implications.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{whether the}} governance of regulatory agencies – regulatory governance – is positively related to financial sector soundness. We model regulatory governance and financial stability as latent variables, using a structural equation modeling approach. We include {{a broad range of}} variables potentially relevant to financial stability, employing aggregate regulatory, banking and financial, macroeconomic and institutional environment data for a sample of 55 countries over a period from 2001 to 2005. Given the growing importance of <b>macro-prudential</b> <b>analysis,</b> we use the IMF’s financial soundness indicators, a relatively new body of economic statistics which focuses on the banking sector as a whole. Our empirical evidence indicates that regulatory governance has a beneficial influence on financial stability. Thus, our findings support the view that the improvement of regulatory governance arrangements should be a building block of financial reform...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the methodological and statistical framework for <b>macro-prudential</b> <b>analysis</b> {{of the financial}} condition of the EU banking sector that has been adopted by the European System of Central Banks (ESCB). The framework is also a central component of broader financial stability assessments {{carried out by the}} ECB in co-operation with national authorities. The framework has three main building blocks, which draw on a large number of macro-prudential indicators. The first block is designed for assessing the financial condition of the banking sector. The second building block provides a framework for analysing potential sources of risk and vulnerability to which banks are exposed and an assessment of the importance of related exposures. The final part of the analysis deals with the resilience of banks vis- 0 -vis these different sources of risk and vulnerability.

40|$|The European System of Central Banks (ESCB) and the Eurosystem 2 {{have already}} been {{carrying}} out <b>macro-prudential</b> <b>analysis,</b> in particular concerning {{the stability of the}} EU and euro area banks, for many years. This paper presents the work in progress to enhance ECB statistics required to undertake this analysis and future challenges, also in light of the forthcoming establishment of the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB). The focus is in particular on the enhancement of the Consolidated Banking Data (CBD), which are provided by the member organisations of the ESCB Banking Supervision Committee (BSC) and compiled by the ECB, and on the development of statistics on Large Banking and Insurance Groups (LBIGs), where, as a first step, the statistical definition of these groups, is discussed. Whereas these two work streams are crucial in order to define the backbone for a regular collection of statistical information for financial stability analysis, challenges go considerably beyond them.

40|$|The {{strengthening}} of the framework for macro-prudential supervision within Europe has been a key priority {{in response to the}} ongoing financial crisis. Taking up the recommendations of the De Larosière report, 5 one of the main initiatives is the creation of the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB), which will have responsibility for identifying, monitoring, assessing and responding to potential threats and risks to financial stability in the EU. Subject to the endorsement of the underlying legal acts, this new body will receive analytical, statistical, administrative and logistical support from the ECB. The establishment of the ESRB consequently has relevant implications for the statistical work of the ECB and the ESCB. The aim {{of this paper is to}} describe two key work streams that are being undertaken in order to prepare for the ESRB. These workstreams concern the enhancement of the Consolidated Banking Data (CBD) 6 and the development of a statistical definition of Large Banking and Insurance Groups (LBIGs). The statistical requirements for <b>macro-prudential</b> <b>analysis</b> to be potentially carried out by ESRB entail the following demanding aspects: i) an EU wide geographical scope (moving beyond the euro area focus applied to the ECB’s own financial stability analysis); ii) includin...|$|E
