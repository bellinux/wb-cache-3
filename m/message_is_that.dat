25|$|Many of the {{characters}} of the Fourth Expedition—Parkhill, Captain Wilder, and Hathaway—re-appear in later stories. This is the first story that focuses on a central motif of The Martian Chronicles: the colonization of the Western frontier in the United States. Like Spender, Bradbury's <b>message</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> some types of colonization are right and others are wrong. Trying to recreate Earth is viewed as wrong, but an approach that respects the fallen civilization that is being replaced is right.|$|E

25|$|A {{review of}} European and American {{research}} indicates that terrorist bombings cause Islamophobia and hate crimes to flare up but, in calmer times, they subside again, although to a relatively high level. Terrorist's most persuasive <b>message</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> of fear and fear, a primary and strong emotion, increases risk estimates and has distortive effects on the perception of ordinary Muslims. Widespread Islamophobic prejudice seems to contribute to anti-Muslim hate crimes, but indirectly: terrorist attacks and intensified Islamophobic prejudice serve as {{a window of opportunity}} for extremist groups and networks.|$|E
25|$|The {{novel is}} a social satire {{following}} French journalist Ulysse Mérou, who participates in a voyage to a distant planet where speechless, animalistic humans are hunted and enslaved by an advanced society of apes. Eventually Mérou discovers that humans once dominated the planet until their complacency allowed the more industrious apes to overthrow them. The novel's central <b>message</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> human intelligence is not a fixed quality and could atrophy if taken for granted. Boulle considered the novel one of his minor works, though {{it proved to be}} a hit. Xan Fielding translated it into English; it was published in the United Kingdom as Monkey Planet and in the United States as Planet of the Apes.|$|E
25|$|The Land of Oz as {{portrayed in}} the classic MGM musical movie of 1939, is quite {{different}} from that portrayed in Baum's books. The most notable difference is that in the film the entire land of Oz appears to be dreamed up by Dorothy Gale (thus making it a dream world), although, Dorothy earnestly corrects the adults at the end that she was indeed there, and an image of Dorothy's falling farmhouse returning to earth is presented. The apparent <b>message</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> one should appreciate one's home, no matter how dull it may look or uninteresting its surroundings may be, for having a home and a family is not something that should be taken for granted. This contrasts sharply with the books, in which Dorothy and her family are eventually invited to move to Oz due to a bank foreclosure on the farm, showing both that Oz is a real place, and that it is a utopia compared to the prairies of Kansas.|$|E

500|$|The lyrics, {{according}} to Brown are about relationships, {{and to be}} there for each other. That it does not matter to say merely that you love them, the only thing that they care is that their lover give his promise that he will be there for them whenever they need him. In [...] "Say You'll Be There", the group exuded a brash confidence that was attractive to their teenage and young adult fans. The Spice Girls decide to be friends, not lovers, the clear <b>message</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the relationship can be channelled and controlled by the girl, with an emphasis on stating where they come from and what they stand for.|$|E
500|$|The {{importance}} of hierarchy and leadership {{is also a}} significant element. The overarching hierarchy of race is informed by Victorian concepts, influenced by the new theories of evolution proposed by Darwin and others. In morals and culture, the natives are placed lower on the evolutionary ladder than are Europeans, as is evidenced in {{the battle over the}} native woman Avatea, which pits [...] "the forces of civilization versus the forces of cannibalism". Another hierarchy is seen in the organisation of the boys. Although Jack, Ralph and Peterkin each have a say in how they should organise themselves, ultimately the younger boys defer to Jack, [...] "a natural leader", particularly in a crisis, forming a natural hierarchy. The pirates also have a hierarchy, but one without democracy, and as a consequence are wiped out. The hierarchy of the natives is imposed by savagery. Ballantyne's <b>message</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> leaders should be respected by those they lead, and govern with their consent. This educational message is especially appropriate considering Ballantyne's adolescent audience, [...] "the future rulers of the world".|$|E
500|$|In {{his opening}} speech on 26 September 2001, Garnham said that race {{may have played}} a part in the case, {{due to the fact that}} a black child was murdered by her black carers, and the social worker and police officer most closely {{involved}} in the case were black. He said that the fear of being accused of racism may have led to the inaction. In the hearings, Arthurworrey, who is African-Caribbean, admitted that her assumptions about African–Caribbean families influenced her judgement, and that she had assumed Climbié's timidness in the presence of Kouao and Manning stemmed not from fear, but from the African–Caribbean culture of respect towards one's parents. Ratna Dutt, director of the Race Equality Unit (now the Race Equality Foundation), a charity that provides race-awareness training to social workers, later said, [...] "the implicit <b>message</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> it's acceptable for ethnic minorities to receive poor services under the guise of superficial cultural sensitivity. This is absolutely shameful, as it allows people to argue that good practice is compromised by anti-racism"; and, contrasting the outcomes of the white and black staff members involved, [...] "for a large number of black frontline staff if the finger of blame is pointed at them they don't end up in jobs in other local authorities. That's how institutional racism operates". Jacqui Smith, Home Secretary from 2007, said: [...] "I have not seen widespread evidence that social workers are not taking action", and, [...] "there are no cultures that condone child abuse. We are absolutely clear that social workers and social work departments have a responsibility to consider whether children are subjected to harm, and if they think they are, to take action".sic] correctness 'puts children at risk'"].

2500|$|Films may {{resort to}} the notion that romance is a {{solution}} to life's problems or is unchangeable, tapping into a [...] "love conquers all" [...] appeal; for example, in [...] "doomed" [...] romances where the underlying <b>message</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the love the couple shared endured even though their time together was cut short. A film supercouple can be a couple appearing with the same actors over the course of few or several films, making the actors the supercouples rather than the characters.|$|E

2500|$|Academics {{showed little}} {{interest}} in this topic until recently. This was not, however, the case with popular writers from non-conforming backgrounds, who interspersed the text of Revelation with the prophecy they thought was being promised. For example, an anonymous Scottish commentary of 1871 prefaces Revelation 4 with the Little Apocalypse of Mark 13, places Malachi 4:5 ("Behold I will send you Elijah the prophet before {{the coming of the}} great and dreadful day of the Lord") within Revelation 11 and writes Revelation 12:7 side-by-side with the role of [...] "the Satan" [...] in the Book of Job.

2500|$|In the DVD commentary, Verhoeven states his {{intentions}} clearly: the film's <b>message</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> [...] "War makes fascists of us all". He evoked Nazi Germany's fashion, iconography and propaganda {{because he saw}} it as a natural evolution of the post-World War II United States. [...] "I've heard this film nicknamed All Quiet On the Final Frontier", he says, [...] "which is actually not far from the truth." [...] Edward Neumeier (who had previously worked with Verhoeven on RoboCop) broadly concurs, although he sees a satire on human history rather than solely the United States. Verhoeven says his satirical use of irony and hyperbole is [...] "playing with fascism or fascist imagery to point out certain aspects of American society... of course, the movie is about 'Let's all go to war and let's all die.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|This {{classical}} sexual {{script is}} often popularized through television shows, popular films and pornography, which depict the man making a sexual advance {{and the woman}} initially resisting, but then finally positively responding by {{falling in love with}} him or experiencing orgasm (Cowen, Lee, Levy, and Snyder, 1988; Malamuth and Check, 1981; Smith, 1976; Waggett, 1989). The implied <b>message</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> men should persist beyond a woman's protest and women should say [...] "no" [...] even if they desire sex (Muehlenhard and McCoy, 1991). The more traditional the society, the closer the adherence to this sexual script. For this reason, many men do not believe that a woman means [...] "no" [...] when she says [...] "no", and continue to pressure the woman, and ultimately coerce or force her into sex; consent often becomes confused with submission.|$|E
2500|$|Structured {{programming}} is often regarded as [...] "goto-less programming". But as Bertrand Meyer notes, [...] "As {{the first book}} on the topic [...] shows, structured {{programming is}} about much more than control structures and the goto. Its principal <b>message</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> programming {{should be considered a}} scientific discipline based on mathematical rigor." [...] , structured programming – especially in the 1970s and 1980s – significantly influenced the birth of many modern programming languages such as Pascal, C, Modula-2, and Ada. The Fortran 77 version which incorporates the concepts of structured programming, was released in 1978. The C++ language was a considerably extended and enhanced version of the popular [...] C (see also: list of C-based programming languages). Since C++ was developed from a more traditional , it is a 'hybrid language', rather than a pure object-oriented programming language.|$|E

Altars were used for sacrifices to Pagan Gods in Ancient Rome. The Ara Pacis represented Augustus' goal to represent the era of peace that came {{with the end of the}} Republic and the beginning of the Empire.

The <b>message</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> Roman people <b>were</b> no longer starving, which was consistent with Augustus’ promise of “peace and fertility”, where he gave land to farmers to plant in the fall and harvest in the spring.

40|$|The motivational {{impact of}} {{messages}} {{about how to}} interpret experienced difficulty with schoolwork was tested in two studies. Students read that experienced difficulty with schoolwork is a signal either of the importance or of the impossibility of succeeding in school, rated how much they agreed, and completed a difficult task (Raven’s Progressive Matrices). In the absence of reactance (Study 1, N = 93), students’ performance reflected an assimilation of the interpretation of experienced difficulty message {{to which they were}} randomly assigned. In the presence of conditions conducive to reactance (Study 2, N = 181), the effect on performance was more complex, reflecting contrast with or assimilation to message content depending on message acceptance. Contrast (rejecting the message) bolstered performance if the <b>message</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> experienced difficulty implies <b>that</b> the task <b>is</b> impossible, whereas assimilation (accepting the message) bolstered performance if the <b>message</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> experienced difficulty implies <b>that</b> the task <b>is</b> important...|$|R
