It is shown that polyimide (up to 10 wt%) addition {{leads to a}} shifting of the initial autoacceleration and initial autoretardation conversions to lower conversion values than those for polymerization of plain methyl methacrylate. It is stated that polyimide macromolecules do not create additional initiation reaction centres, but may take part in chain transfer and/or termination reactions during methyl methacrylate polymerization. Besides polyimides some other aromatic polymers, namely polyesters, polyamides, poly(ether ether <b>ketone)</b> <b>s</b> and poly(phthalide) s, {{have been used in}} similar processes. The new copolymers obtained differ in properties (solubility, thermal resistance, etc) compared to corresponding polymer components. 1...|$|R
40|$|S) -beta-Bisabolene, (S) - 1, was synthetized by a {{synthetic}} route in which (S) - 4 -methyl- 3 -cyclohexene carboxylic acid, (S) - 10, {{which was the}} key intermediate, was prepared via a highly diastereoselective TiCl 4 -catalyzed Diels-Alder reaction between isoprene and the acrylate of commercial (R) -pantolactone, followed by hydrolysis. Compound (S) - 10 was then converted into <b>ketone</b> (<b>S)</b> - 13 using two different procedures, The best one of these, as regards the degree of stereospecificity, involved the reaction of (S) - 10 with 2 equiv of 4 -methyl- 3 -penten- 1 -yllithium, 14, {{in the presence of}} CeCl 3, and gave (S) - 13 having ca. 84 % ee. The Zr-promoted methylenation of this ketone afforded highly enantiomerically enriched (S) - 1...|$|R
40|$|The work {{described}} in this thesis {{is concerned with the}} synthesis, isolation and characterisation of macrocyclic oligomers ("cyclomers") found in semi-crystalline poly(aryl ether <b>ketone)</b> <b>s.</b> A wide range of cyclomers were obtained in good yield (up to 92 %) under pseudo-high dilution by nucleophilic condensation and their cyclic nature was confirmed by a range of analytical techniques. Selected macrocycles were used to produce polymers by ring-opening polymerisation in the melt. It was also shown that during a typical high-temperature synthesis of a poly(aryl ether ketone). such cyclic oligomers are incorporated into the polymer chain. Polymers with a high macrocyclic content were synthesised by high temperature polycondensation at low monomer concentration. These materials were used to assess the influence of macrocycles on polymer viscosity in the melt. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|Sulfonated poly(ether ether <b>ketone)</b> <b>s</b> (SPEEKs) with {{different}} sulfonation degrees (DS) were synthesized and characterized using FTIR and NMR for {{the preparation of}} blend nanofiltration (NF) membranes. Blends of polyethersulfone and SPEEK at various SPEEK concentrations and various DS were prepared by a simple dry-jet wet spinning technique. The changes in the morphological and electrical properties of the blend membranes were deduced by employing the combination of irreversible thermodynamic model, Steric-Hindrance Pore (SHP) model and Teorell-Meyer-Sievers (TMS) model and the modeling results have been analyzed and discussed in detail. The {{results showed that the}} membrane water flux, pore size and surface charge were dependent on the content and DS of SPEEK used. FESEM-EDX results also provided supporting evidence for the trends observed for the morphological and electrical studies...|$|R
