An optimization problem is first formulated to jointly maximize system spectral efficiency and minimize power consumption, {{taking into account}} advantages of UWB inherent properties (such as the capacities in supporting parallel transmissions and providing accurate positioning). For UWB networks with a stringent constraint on complexity, a margin-based power allocation scheme and an exclusive region-based scheduling scheme are then proposed. The margin-based power allocation scheme utilizes each node’s own position information, and the exclusive region-based scheduling scheme takes into consideration the interaction among simultaneous transmission links.

For {{embedded}} real-time systems, a correct timing behavior must be guaranteed {{as a result of}} the design. Therefore, an important part of the design process is the <b>allocation</b> and <b>scheduling</b> of software tasks onto the hardware architecture. However, the various application constraints typically found in embedded systems significantly complicates this task.

In particular, this work addresses two major problems that appear in the construction of <b>allocation</b> and <b>scheduling</b> algorithms for such systems.

The algorithm is fast and efficient,and so is suitable to be used in the inner loop of our hardware/software co-synthesis framework which must call the scheduling routine many times. 1. Instructions Hardware/software co-synthesis partitions an embedded system specification into hardware and software modules to meet performance, power and cost goals. A common model to describe the system specification is the task graph [1]. The task graph has a structure similar to a data flow graph, except that the tasks in a task graph represent larger units of functionality. <b>Allocation</b> and <b>scheduling</b> of a set of data-dependent tasks, which are described by task graphs, on a multiprocessor architecture has been intensively researched. But most previous work that used a task graph model that has no control dependency information can only capture data dependency in the system specification. Recently, some researchers in co-synthesis domain have tried to use conditional task graph to capture both data dependencies and control dependencies of the system specification [7][8].
