25|$|In June 1957, at {{the fourth}} session of the First National People's Congress, Ma {{presented}} his New Population Theory. Having examined trends of the early 1950s, he concluded that further population growth at such high rates would be detrimental to China's development. Therefore, he advocated government control of fertility. During the following three years, Ma's theory suffered two rounds of attacks, and he was dismissed from public life. The charges of the government were that the theory followed <b>Malthusianism,</b> attempted to discredit the superiority of socialism, and showed contempt for the people.|$|E
25|$|Darwin's freethinking brother Erasmus {{was part}} of this Whig circle and {{a close friend of}} the writer Harriet Martineau, who {{promoted}} the <b>Malthusianism</b> underlying the controversial Whig Poor Law reforms (1834) to stop welfare from causing overpopulation and more poverty, which were then being implemented piecemeal in the face of opposition to the new poorhouses. As a Unitarian, Martineau welcomed the radical implications of transmutation of species, which was promoted by Grant and some medical men but anathema to Darwin's Anglican friends who saw it {{as a threat to the}} social order. Transmutation threatened the essential distinction between man and beast, and implied progressive improvement with the implication that the lower orders could aspire to the privileges of their aristocratic overlords.|$|E
500|$|Early in March, Darwin {{moved to}} London {{to be near}} this work, joining Lyell's social circle of {{scientists}} and experts such as Charles Babbage,Darwin's Journal (...) backdated from August 1838 gives a date of 6 March 1837 who described God as a programmer of laws. Darwin stayed with his freethinking brother Erasmus, part of this Whig circle and {{a close friend of}} the writer Harriet Martineau, who promoted <b>Malthusianism</b> underlying the controversial Whig Poor Law reforms to stop welfare from causing overpopulation and more poverty. As a Unitarian, she welcomed the radical implications of transmutation of species, promoted by Grant and younger surgeons influenced by Geoffroy. Transmutation was anathema to Anglicans defending social order, but reputable scientists openly discussed the subject and there was wide interest in John Herschel's letter praising Lyell's approach as a way to find a natural cause of the origin of new species.|$|E
2500|$|Ronald Fisher commented sceptically on <b>Malthusianism</b> as a {{basis for}} a theory of natural selection. Fisher did not deny Malthus's basic premises, but {{emphasised}} the role of fecundity (reproductive rate), rather than assume actual conditions would not reduce future births. John Maynard Smith doubted that famine functioned as the great leveller, as portrayed by Malthus, but he also accepted the basic premises: ...|$|E
2500|$|Simpson held a {{contempt}} for <b>Malthusianism,</b> widely respected in its day for its conservative social dicta and regarded it as a superfluous attempt to justify social exploits and inequality. He {{viewed it as}} [...] "a singular infatuation prevailing among all modern writers on economy, that the scarcity of food among the laboring people is attributable to excess of population" [...] He maintained this notion to be a fallacy, easily refuted by simply observing the hoarding of resources by the very rich, a fact he believed was [...] "staring them in the face". Simpson maintained that nature was able to provide food and the means of comfort for all of society, and that this advent was hindered and dominated by a selfish few who misused and misappropriated nature's abundance, believing that the vices of man, and not the order of nature, were the cause of hunger, pauperism and social inequality. He believed that labor {{was the source of}} all wealth and that social inequality was the end result of private property, generally considered a radical idea in a land greatly given to farming and other free enterprise. Labor radicals like Stephen Simpson and contemporaries like Seth Luther took exception to [...] "'the enrichment of the wealthy {{on the backs of the}} poor", especially in areas where coerced child labor was involved.|$|E
60|$|I {{went over}} all the cases, and I found the key fitted so far. The fact that Swinburne was irritated at the {{unhappiness}} of Christians and yet more irritated at their happiness was easily explained. It {{was no longer a}} complication of diseases in Christianity, but a complication of diseases in Swinburne. The restraints of Christians saddened him simply because he was more hedonist than a healthy man should be. The faith of Christians angered him because he was more pessimist than a healthy man should be. In the same way the Malthusians by instinct attacked Christianity; not because there is anything especially anti-Malthusian about Christianity, but because there is something a little anti-human about <b>Malthusianism.</b>|$|E
6000|$|The {{question}} to be solved {{is not one of}} <b>Malthusianism,</b> [...] "projected efficiency," [...] nor ethics. It is a question of might. Whichever class is to win, will win by virtue of superior strength; for the workers are beginning to say, as they said to Mr. Cunniff, [...] "Malthus be damned." [...] In their own minds they find no sanction for continuing the individual struggle for the survival of the fittest. As Mr. Gompers has said, they want more, and more, and more. The ethical import of Mr. Kidd's plan of the present generation putting up with less in order that race efficiency may be projected into a remote future, has no bearing upon their actions. They refuse to be the [...] "glad perishers" [...] so glowingly described by Nietzsche.|$|E
60|$|What was {{the sketch}} that he thus {{committed}} to paper in 1844, and {{submitted to the}} judgment of his friend Hooker? It was the germ {{of the theory of}} natural selection. According to that theory, organic development is due to the survival of the fittest among innumerable variations, good, bad, and indifferent, from one or more parent stocks. Darwin's reading of Malthus had suggested to him (apparently as early as the date of publication of the 'Naturalist's Journal') the idea that every species of plant and animal must always be producing a far greater number of seeds, eggs, germs, or young offspring than could possibly be needed for the maintenance of the average number of the species. Of these young, by far the greater number must always perish from generation to generation, for want of space, of food, of air, of raw material. The survivors in each brood must be those naturally best adapted for survival. The many would be eaten, starved, overrun, or crowded out; the few that survive would be those that possessed any special means of defence against aggressors, any special advantage for escaping starvation, any special protection against overrunning or overcrowding foes. Animals and plants, Darwin found on inquiry and investigation, tended to vary under diverse circumstances from the parent or parents that originally produced them. These variations were usually infinitesimal in amount, but sometimes more considerable or even striking. If any particular variation tended in any way to preserve the life of the creatures that exhibited it, beyond the average of their like competitors, that variation would in the long run survive, and the individuals that possessed it, being thus favoured in the struggle for existence, would replace the less adapted form from which they sprang. Darwinism is <b>Malthusianism</b> on the large scale: it is the application of the calculus of population to the wide facts of universal life.|$|E
6000|$|His {{claim to}} affirm having been rejected, Bradlaugh next desired to swear. The ministerial whip {{reported}} that the feeling against him in the House was uncontrollable. The Speaker held a council in his library with Mr. Gladstone, the law officers, the whip, {{and two or three}} other persons of authority and sense. He told them that if Bradlaugh had in the first instance come to take the oath, he should have allowed no intervention, but that the case was altered by the claimant’s open declaration that an oath was not binding on his conscience. A hostile motion was expected when Bradlaugh came to the table to be sworn, and the Speaker suggested that it should be met by the previous question, to be moved by Mr. Gladstone. Then the whip broke in with the assurance that the usual supporters of the government could not be relied upon. The Speaker went upstairs to dress, and on his return found that they had agreed on moving another select committee. He told them that he thought this a weak course, but if the previous question would be defeated, perhaps a committee could not be helped. Bradlaugh came to the table, and the hostile motion was made. Mr. Gladstone proposed his committee, and carried it by a good majority against the motion that Bradlaugh, being without religious belief, could not take an oath. The debate was warm, and the attacks on Bradlaugh were often gross. The Speaker honourably pointed out that such attacks on an elected member whose absence was enforced by their own order, were unfair and unbecoming, but the feelings of the House were too strong for him and too strong for chivalry. The opposition turned affairs to ignoble party account, and were not ashamed in their prints and elsewhere to level the charge of “open patronage of unbelief and <b>Malthusianism,</b> Bradlaugh and Blasphemy,” against a government that contained Gladstone, Bright, and Selborne, three of the most conspicuously devout men to be found in all England. One expression of faith used by a leader in the attack on Bradlaugh lived in Mr. Gladstone’s memory {{to the end of his}} days. “You know, Mr. Speaker,” cried the champion of orthodox creeds, “we all of us believe in a God of some sort or another.” That a man should consent to clothe the naked human soul in this truly singular and scanty remnant of spiritual apparel, was held to be the unalterable condition of fitness for a seat in parliament and the company of decent people. Well might Mr. Gladstone point out how vast a disparagement of Christianity, and of orthodox theism also, was here involved:— ...|$|E
60|$|While I {{thus was}} far more obnoxious to the Tory interest, and to many Conservative Liberals than I had {{formerly}} been, the course I pursued in Parliament had by no means been such as to make Liberals generally at all enthusiastic in my support. It has already been mentioned, how large a proportion of my prominent appearances had been on questions on which I differed {{from most of the}} Liberal party, or about which they cared little, and how few occasions there had been on which the line I took was such as could lead them to attach any great value to me as an organ of their opinions. I had moreover done things which had excited, in many minds, a personal prejudice against me. Many were offended by what they called the persecution of Mr. Eyre: and still greater offence was taken at my sending a subscription to the election expenses of Mr. Bradlaugh. Having refused to be at any expense for my own election, and having had all its expenses defrayed by others, I felt under a peculiar obligation to subscribe in my turn where funds were deficient for candidates whose election was desirable. I accordingly sent subscriptions to nearly all the working class candidates, and among others to Mr. Bradlaugh. He had the support of the working classes; having heard him speak, I knew him to be a man of ability and he had proved that he was the reverse of a demagogue, by placing himself in strong opposition to the prevailing opinion of the democratic party on two such important subjects as <b>Malthusianism</b> and Personal Representation. Men of this sort, who, while sharing the democratic feelings of the working classes, judged political questions for themselves, and had courage to assert their individual convictions against popular opposition, were needed, as it seemed to me, in Parliament, and I did not think that Mr. Bradlaugh's anti-religious opinions (even though he had been intemperate in the expression of them) ought to exclude him. In subscribing, however, to his election, I did what would have been highly imprudent if I had been at liberty to consider only the interests of my own re-election; and, as might be expected, the utmost possible use, both fair and unfair, was made of this act of mine to stir up the electors of Westminster against me. To these various causes, combined with an unscrupulous use of the usual pecuniary and other influences on the side of my Tory competitor, while none were used on my side, it is to be ascribed that I failed at my second election after having succeeded at the first. No sooner {{was the result of the}} election known than I received three or four invitations to become a candidate for other constituencies, chiefly counties; but even if success could have been expected, and this without expense, I was not disposed to deny myself the relief of returning to private life. I had no cause to feel humiliated at my rejection by the electors; and if I had, the feeling would have been far outweighed by the numerous expressions of regret which I received from all sorts of persons and places, and in a most marked degree from those members of the liberal party in Parliament, with whom I had been accustomed to act.|$|E

50|$|Eco-Marxist scholar Allan Schnaiberg (below) argues against <b>Malthusianism</b> {{with the}} {{rationale}} that under larger capitalist economies, human degradation moved from localized, population-based degradation to organizationally caused degradation of capitalist political economies to blame. He gives {{the example of}} the organized degradation of rainforest areas which states and capitalists push people off the land before it is degraded by organizational means. Thus, many authors are critical of <b>Malthusianism,</b> from sociologists (Schnaiberg)to economists (Sen and Boserup), to political scientists (Ostrom), and all focus on how a country's social organization of its extraction can degrade the environment independent of abstract population.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Malthusianism</b> has {{attracted}} criticism from a {{diverse range of}} differing schools of thought, including Marxists and socialists, libertarians and free market enthusiasts, social conservatives, feminists and human rights advocates, characterising it as excessively pessimistic, misanthropic or inhuman. [...] Many critics believe <b>Malthusianism</b> has been discredited {{since the publication of}} Principle of Population, often citing advances in agricultural techniques and modern reductions in human fertility. Many modern proponents believe that the basic concept of population growth eventually outstripping resources is still fundamentally valid, and [...] "positive checks" [...] are still likely in humanity's future if there is no action to curb population growth.|$|E

50|$|Even {{though much}} of {{mainstream}} journalism considers <b>Malthusianism</b> the only view of environmentalism, most sociologists {{would disagree with}} <b>Malthusianism</b> since social organizational issues of environmental degradation are more demonstrated to cause environmental problems than abstract population or selfishness per se. For examples of this critique, Ostrom in her book Governing the Commons: The Evolution of Institutions for Collective Action (1990) argues that instead of self-interest always causing degradation, it can sometimes motivate people {{to take care of}} their common property resources. To do this they must change the basic organizational rules of resource use.

5000|$|One {{proponent of}} <b>Malthusianism</b> was the novelist Harriet Martineau whose circle of acquaintances {{included}} Charles Darwin, and {{the ideas of}} Malthus were a significant influence on the inception of Darwin's theory of evolution.

Proponents of <b>Malthusianism</b> were in turn influenced by Darwin's ideas, both schools coming to influence the field of eugenics.

5000|$|<b>Malthusianism</b> is {{the idea}} that {{population}} growth is potentially exponential while the growth of the food supply is arithmetical at best.
