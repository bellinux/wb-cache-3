50|$|The National History Bee <b>Middle</b> <b>School</b> Competition was {{launched}} across the USA {{in the fall}} of the 2011-2012 <b>school</b> year. The <b>Middle</b> <b>School</b> <b>level</b> differs from the high <b>school</b> <b>level</b> by containing an additional official competition stage, the Online Regional Qualifying Exam (ORQE). Typically, the top 4 students at a school (often determined by an intramural competition) are allowed to take the ORQE although students may also register individually for it. The top 120 students within a region (for the 2013-14 year, there are 37 of these) then qualify for the Regional Bees, where they are seeded according to their ORQE results. In contrast with the High School Regional Bees, the Regional Bees at the <b>Middle</b> <b>School</b> <b>level</b> are not held at the same dates and sites as the <b>Middle</b> <b>School</b> <b>level</b> Regional Bowls. Furthermore, while High <b>School</b> <b>level</b> students may compete at up to three different Regional Bees, with no geographic restrictions on participation, <b>Middle</b> <b>School</b> (and Elementary <b>School</b> <b>level</b> students) may only compete at one Regional Bee, and the site is determined by geographic proximity to their school or homeschool association (or home in the case of students who have signed up independently).|$|R
