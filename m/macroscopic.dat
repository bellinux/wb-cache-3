5|$|A lichen is a {{symbiosis}} of a <b>macroscopic</b> fungus with photosynthetic microbial algae or cyanobacteria.|$|E
5|$|Anatomy is a {{treatment}} of the <b>macroscopic</b> forms of such structures organs and organ systems.|$|E

5|$|The {{discipline}} of anatomy {{is divided into}} <b>macroscopic</b> and microscopic anatomy. <b>Macroscopic</b> anatomy, or gross anatomy, is the examination of an animal's body parts using unaided eyesight. Gross anatomy also includes the branch of superficial anatomy. Microscopic anatomy {{involves the use of}} optical instruments {{in the study of the}} tissues of various structures, known as histology, and also in the study of cells.|$|E
5|$|For certain {{physical}} scenarios, it {{is impossible}} to model forces as being due to gradient of potentials. This is often due to macrophysical considerations that yield forces as arising from a <b>macroscopic</b> statistical average of microstates. For example, friction is caused by the gradients of numerous electrostatic potentials between the atoms, but manifests as a force model that is independent of any macroscale position vector. Nonconservative forces other than friction include other contact forces, tension, compression, and drag. However, for any sufficiently detailed description, all these forces are the results of conservative ones since each of these <b>macroscopic</b> forces are the net results of the gradients of microscopic potentials.|$|E
5|$|The {{connection}} between <b>macroscopic</b> nonconservative forces and microscopic conservative forces {{is described by}} detailed treatment with statistical mechanics. In <b>macroscopic</b> closed systems, nonconservative forces act to change the internal energies of the system, and are often associated with the transfer of heat. According to the Second law of thermodynamics, nonconservative forces necessarily result in energy transformations within closed systems from ordered to more random conditions as entropy increases.|$|E
5|$|The {{ordering}} of liquid crystalline phases is extensive on the molecular scale. This order extends {{up to the}} entire domain size, which {{may be on the}} order of micrometers, but usually does not extend to the <b>macroscopic</b> scale as often occurs in classical crystalline solids. However some techniques, {{such as the use of}} boundaries or an applied electric field, can be used to enforce a single ordered domain in a <b>macroscopic</b> liquid crystal sample. The ordering in a liquid crystal might extend along only one dimension, with the material being essentially disordered in the other two directions.|$|E
5|$|Fermium is a {{synthetic}} element with symbol Fm and atomic number 100. It {{is a member}} of the actinide series. It is the heaviest element that can be formed by neutron bombardment of lighter elements, and hence the last element that can be prepared in <b>macroscopic</b> quantities, although pure fermium metal has not yet been prepared. A total of 19 isotopes are known, with 257Fm being the longest-lived with a half-life of 100.5 days.|$|E
5|$|If {{appropriate}} {{electrical contacts}} {{are attached to}} a nanotube, electron-hole pairs (excitons) can be generated by injecting electrons and holes from the contacts. Subsequent exciton recombination results in electroluminescence (EL). Electroluminescent devices have been produced from single nanotubes and their <b>macroscopic</b> assemblies. Recombination appears to proceed via triplet-triplet annihilation giving distinct peaks corresponding to E11 and E22 transitions.|$|E
5|$|The Scutellinia genus is {{currently}} {{placed in the}} Pyronemataceae family. However, genera of the Pyronemataceae lack unifying <b>macroscopic</b> or microscopic characteristics; this lack of uniting characters has led various authors to propose a variety of classification schemes. A 1996 study of British specimens of Scutellinia revealed that the species S.crinita, originally described as Peziza crinita in 1789 by French botanist Jean Baptiste François Pierre Bulliard, was synonymous with S.scutellata.|$|E
5|$|The apothecium—a {{specialized}} structure {{important in}} sexual reproduction in the ascomycetes—is a cup-shaped fruit {{body that is}} often <b>macroscopic</b> and holds the hymenium, a layer of tissue containing the spore-bearing cells. The fruit bodies of the basidiomycetes (basidiocarps) and some ascomycetes can sometimes grow very large, and many are well known as mushrooms.|$|E
5|$|The main {{technique}} Cage {{used for}} composition {{is that of}} nested proportions: an arbitrary sequence of numbers defines {{the structure of a}} piece on both the <b>macroscopic</b> and the microscopic level, so that the larger parts of each piece are in the same relation to the whole as the smaller parts are to a single unit of it. For instance, the proportion for Sonata III is 1, 1, 3¼, 3¼ (in whole notes), and a unit here is equal to 8½ bars (the end of a unit is marked with a double barline in the score, unless it coincides with the end of a section). The structure of this sonata is AABB. Section A consists of a single unit, composed according to the given proportion: correlation on the microscopic level. A is repeated, and AA forms {{the first part of the}} proportion on the <b>macroscopic</b> level: 1, 1. B consists of three units and an appendix of ¼ of a unit. B is also repeated, and BB gives the second half of the proportion: 3¼, 3¼. Therefore, AABB has proportions 1, 1, 3¼, 3¼: correlation on the <b>macroscopic</b> level. The musical phrases within each unit are also governed by the same proportion. See Example 2 for a graph of the structure of Sonata III.|$|E
5|$|These direct pain inputs, {{as well as}} {{indirect}} inputs, {{are thought}} to induce long-term pain avoidance behavior that results in chronic posture changes and consequently, in functional and anatomical remodeling of vestibular and proprioceptive nuclei. As a result, chronic neuropathic pain can induce <b>macroscopic</b> anatomical remodeling of the hindbrain, including the cerebellum. The magnitude of this remodeling and the induction of neuron progenitor markers suggest the contribution of adult neurogenesis to these changes.|$|E
5|$|A {{second type}} are the intraductal {{papillary}} mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs). These are <b>macroscopic</b> lesions, which {{are found in}} about 2% of all adults. This rate rises to ~10% by age 70. These lesions have about a 25% risk of developing into invasive cancer. They may have KRAS gene mutations (~40–65% of cases) and in the GNAS Gs alpha subunit and RNF43, affecting the Wnt signaling pathway. Even if removed surgically, there remains a considerably increased risk of pancreatic cancer developing subsequently.|$|E
5|$|Astatine is a {{radioactive}} {{chemical element}} with symbol At and atomic number 85. It is the rarest naturally occurring {{element in the}} Earth's crust, occurring only as the decay product of various heavier elements. All of astatine's isotopes are short-lived; the most stable is astatine-210, with a half-life of 8.1 hours. A sample of the pure element has never been assembled, because any <b>macroscopic</b> specimen would be immediately vaporized by the heat of its own radioactivity.|$|E
5|$|Compton {{was one of}} {{a handful}} of {{scientists}} and philosophers to propose a two-stage model of free will. Others include William James, Henri Poincaré, Karl Popper, Henry Margenau, and Daniel Dennett. In 1931, Compton championed the idea of human freedom based on quantum indeterminacy, and invented the notion of amplification of microscopic quantum events to bring chance into the <b>macroscopic</b> world. In his somewhat bizarre mechanism, he imagined sticks of dynamite attached to his amplifier, anticipating the Schrödinger's cat paradox, which was published in 1935.|$|E
5|$|Neutron {{interferometry}} {{has been}} used to investigate the Aharonov–Bohm effect, {{to examine the effects of}} gravity acting on an elementary particle, and to demonstrate a strange behavior of fermions that is at the basis of the Pauli exclusion principle: Unlike <b>macroscopic</b> objects, when fermions are rotated by 360° about any axis, they do not return to their original state, but develop a minus sign in their wave function. In other words, a fermion needs to be rotated 720° before returning to its original state.|$|E
5|$|Scientists and {{engineers}} {{are able to}} use liquid crystals {{in a variety of}} applications because external perturbation can cause significant changes in the <b>macroscopic</b> properties of the liquid crystal system. Both electric and magnetic fields can be used to induce these changes. The magnitude of the fields, as well as the speed at which the molecules align are important characteristics industry deals with. Special surface treatments can be used in liquid crystal devices to force specific orientations of the director.|$|E
5|$|The bulk {{properties}} of astatine {{are not known}} with any certainty. Research is limited by its short half-life, which prevents the creation of weighable quantities. A visible piece of astatine would immediately vaporize itself because of the heat generated by its intense radioactivity. It {{remains to be seen}} if, with sufficient cooling, a <b>macroscopic</b> quantity of astatine could be deposited as a thin film. Astatine is usually classified as either a nonmetal or a metalloid; metal formation has also been predicted.|$|E
5|$|The {{discipline}} of anatomy can be subdivided {{into a number}} of branches including gross or <b>macroscopic</b> anatomy and microscopic anatomy. Gross anatomy is the study of structures large enough to be seen with the naked eye, and also includes superficial anatomy or surface anatomy, the study by sight of the external body features. Microscopic anatomy is the study of structures on a microscopic scale, including histology (the study of tissues), and embryology (the study of an organism in its immature condition).|$|E
5|$|The first 94 {{elements}} occur naturally; {{the remaining}} 24, americium to oganesson (95–118) occur only when synthesized in laboratories. Of the 94 naturally occurring elements, 83 are primordial and 11 occur only in decay chains of primordial elements. No element heavier than einsteinium (element 99) {{has ever been}} observed in <b>macroscopic</b> quantities in its pure form, nor has astatine (element 85); francium (element 87) has been only photographed {{in the form of}} light emitted from microscopic quantities (300,000 atoms).|$|E
25|$|During {{formation}} of <b>macroscopic</b> objects, constituent atoms and ions usually combine to form structures composed of neutral ionic compounds electrically bound to neutral atoms. Thus <b>macroscopic</b> objects tend toward being neutral overall, but <b>macroscopic</b> objects are rarely perfectly net neutral.|$|E
25|$|If {{different}} <b>macroscopic</b> {{processes are}} sampled {{from the same}} elementary microscopic events then <b>macroscopic</b> detailed balance may be violated even when microscopic detailed balance holds.|$|E
25|$|In physics, {{emergence}} is used {{to describe}} a property, law, or phenomenon which occurs at <b>macroscopic</b> scales (in space or time) but not at microscopic scales, {{despite the fact that}} a <b>macroscopic</b> system {{can be viewed as a}} very large ensemble of microscopic systems.|$|E
25|$|Crystals are {{commonly}} recognized by their shape, consisting of flat faces with sharp angles. These shape characteristics are {{not necessary for}} a crystal—a crystal is scientifically defined by its microscopic atomic arrangement, not its <b>macroscopic</b> shape—but the characteristic <b>macroscopic</b> shape is often present and easy to see.|$|E
25|$|In practice, {{although}} {{the definition of}} <b>macroscopic</b> field used above is the commonest one, other (differently defined) types of <b>macroscopic</b> field and field enhancement factor {{are used in the}} literature, particularly in connection with the use of probes to investigate the i-V characteristics of individual emitters.|$|E
25|$|A {{significant}} part of the technological literature on large-area emitters fails to make clear distinctions between local and <b>macroscopic</b> current densities, or between notional emission area Ar and <b>macroscopic</b> area AM, and/or omits the parameter αr from cited equations. Care is necessary in order to avoid errors of interpretation.|$|E
25|$|This result {{applies to}} homogeneous, <b>macroscopic</b> systems, {{but not to}} all {{thermodynamic}} systems.|$|E
25|$|A <b>macroscopic</b> {{body that}} is {{stationary}} (i.e. a reference frame has been chosen to correspond to the body's center of momentum) may have various kinds of internal energy at the molecular or atomic level, which may be regarded as kinetic energy, due to molecular translation, rotation, and vibration, electron translation and spin, and nuclear spin. These all contribute to the body's mass, as provided by the special theory of relativity. When discussing movements of a <b>macroscopic</b> body, the kinetic energy referred to is usually that of the <b>macroscopic</b> movement only. However all internal energies of all types contribute to body's mass, inertia, and total energy.|$|E
25|$|Historically, {{there are}} several {{scientific}} approaches to the explanation of temperature: the classical thermodynamic description based on <b>macroscopic</b> empirical variables that {{can be measured in}} a laboratory; the kinetic theory of gases which relates the <b>macroscopic</b> description to the probability distribution of the energy of motion of gas particles; and a microscopic explanation based on statistical physics and quantum mechanics. In addition, rigorous and purely mathematical treatments have provided an axiomatic approach to classical thermodynamics and temperature. Statistical physics provides a deeper understanding by describing the atomic behavior of matter, and derives <b>macroscopic</b> properties from statistical averages of microscopic states, including both classical and quantum states. In the fundamental physical description, using natural units, temperature may be measured directly in units of energy. However, in the practical systems of measurement for science, technology, and commerce, such as the modern metric system of units, the <b>macroscopic</b> and the microscopic descriptions are interrelated by the Boltzmann constant, a proportionality factor that scales temperature to the microscopic mean kinetic energy.|$|E
25|$|The <b>macroscopic</b> {{elementary}} {{processes are}} microscopically distinguishable. That is, they represent disjoint sets of microscopic events.|$|E
25|$|All the <b>macroscopic</b> {{electronic}} and magnetic properties {{of a solid}} result from its microscopic electronic structure.|$|E
25|$|Kinetic theory {{provides}} {{insight into}} the <b>macroscopic</b> properties of gases by considering their molecular composition and motion. Starting with the definitions of momentum and kinetic energy, one can use the conservation of momentum and geometric relationships of a cube to relate <b>macroscopic</b> system properties of temperature and pressure to the microscopic property of kinetic energy per molecule. The theory provides averaged values for these two properties.|$|E
25|$|<b>Macroscopic</b> replicators are {{mentioned}} {{briefly in the}} fourth chapter of K. Eric Drexler's 1986 book Engines of Creation.|$|E
25|$|In the <b>macroscopic</b> {{world of}} orbital mechanics, the term spin-orbit {{coupling}} is sometimes {{used in the}} same sense as spin-orbital resonance.|$|E
25|$|Although <b>macroscopic</b> {{concepts}} {{are essential for}} understanding our world, much of fundamental physics {{has been devoted to}} the search for a `theory of everything', a set of equations that perfectly describe the behavior of all fundamental particles. The view that this is the goal of science rests in part on the rationale that such a theory would allow us to derive the behavior of all <b>macroscopic</b> concepts, at least in principle. The evidence we have presented suggests that this view may be overly optimistic. A `theory of everything' is one of many components necessary for complete understanding of the universe, but is not necessarily the only one. The development of <b>macroscopic</b> laws from first principles may involve more than just systematic logic, and could require conjectures suggested by experiments, simulations or insight.|$|E
