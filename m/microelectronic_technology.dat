40|$|During {{the last}} decade, many {{different}} approaches {{have been proposed}} to solve the multiple-level synthesis problem with different minimum functionally complete systems of primitive logic blocks. The most popular {{of them is the}} division-based approach. However, modem <b>microelectronic</b> <b>technology</b> provides a large variety of building blocks which considerably differ from those typically considered. The traditional methods are therefore not suitable for synthesis with many modem building blocks. Furthermore, they often fail to find global optima for complex designs and leave unconsidered some important design aspects.

The most important advantages of the general decomposition approach are its generality (any network of any building blocks can be considered) and totality (all important design aspects can be considered) as well as handling the incompletely specified functions in a natural way. In many cases, the general decomposition approach gives much better results than the traditional approaches...|$|E
