40|$|Alzheimer’s {{disease is}} a {{neurodegenerative}} disorder characterised by the accumulation, in the brain, of neurotoxic amyloid beta-(Aβ) peptides. These peptides are generated from the amyloid precursor protein (APP) via the amyloidogenic proteolytic pathway which also leads to the formation <b>of</b> soluble <b>APP</b> beta (sAPPβ). Alternatively, APP can be cleaved by the non-amyloidogenic pathway in which an α-secretase activity cleaves the protein within the Aβ region generating soluble APP alpha (sAPPα). APP itself binds to copper {{at a number of}} sites, including a recently identified E 2 copper binding domain (E 2 CuBD) within the extracellular region of the protein. The current project aims were to investigate how copper binding within the APP E 2 CuBD might influence the expression, proteolysis, cellular localisation and cytotoxicity <b>of</b> <b>APP.</b> In order to achieve this, a range of E 2 CuBD mutants were generated in which various metal-co-ordinating histidine residues were mutated to alanine. These constructs were expressed in HEK and SH-SY 5 Y cells and the effects of the mutations on the afore <b>mentioned</b> properties <b>of</b> <b>APP</b> were assessed. The results show that these mutations had little consistent effect on the expression, proteolysis or cellular localisation <b>of</b> <b>APP.</b> Furthermore, whilst wild-type APP accentuated copper-mediated cytotoxicity in HEK and SH-SY 5 Y cells, mutating the histidine residues in the E 2 domain of the protein had little effect on this phenomenon. Thus, it would appear that copper binding to the E 2 domain <b>of</b> <b>APP</b> is, most likely, not an important event in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease...|$|R
