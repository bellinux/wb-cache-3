25|$|As {{extension}} {{continued in}} the mid to late Jurassic, multiple pull-apart basins and oblique right-lateral strike-slip faulting in the eastern margin of the Exmouth Plateau continued to dominate. The simple shear stress of the Exmouth detachment fault between the base of the upper crust, and the lower crust had been reduced in the east plateau. This reduction in simple shear was in part caused by the deformation that developed series negative flower structures and half-graben systems in the west plateau. By this time, the lithospheric thinning that had been initiated in during the early Jurassic was now considerably thinner. At this period, a <b>magmatic</b> <b>intrusion</b> between the lower crystalline crest and the lithosphere been introduce, underplating this region.|$|E
25|$|In the begin of {{the late}} Triassic, high volumes of sediments {{accumulate}} off of the shoreline of western Australia to the northern extend of the Exmouth Plateau by the Mungaroo Deltas. The Carnian (237-228 Ma) to Norian (228-209 Ma) aged fluviodeltaic sediments deposited were siliciclastic claystones and sandstones, and detritus which would late make up the coals found in Mungaroo Formation. As extensional rifting between Greater Indian and the Australian continued, <b>magmatic</b> <b>intrusion</b> along the westernmost section of the Exmouth Plateau caused further rifting to the outer margins. By {{the end of the}} Late Triassic (209-201 Ma) tectonic activity had relatively slowed down and less deltaic sediments were deposited compared to the Carnian and Norian. More marine sedimentary deposit such as carbonates are found during this time period.|$|E
30|$|Seafloor {{magnetic}} {{data are}} often used as supporting information on <b>magmatic</b> <b>intrusions.</b> We checked the magnetic data recorded during the seismic experiments by using the shipboard magnetometer. However, no positive signals corresponding to the intrusions were found. This is probably because the magnetic data can be contaminated by the ship’s magnetization effect. In addition, the <b>magmatic</b> <b>intrusions</b> we imaged by the reflection data are too small (<[*] 1  km wide and[*]<[*] 100  m tall; Fig.  6) to be detected and thus more close-in observations using deep-towed magnetometers or submersibles are necessary.|$|R

2500|$|The {{early history}} of this region was {{dominated}} by volcanic activity, <b>magmatic</b> <b>intrusion</b> and deformation. The Eastern Pilbara Terrane is mostly volcanic in nature, and this volcanic activity occurred in relatively short, and repeated cycles These ultramafic-mafic-felsic cycles which last approximately 10–15 Myr each are accompanied by metamorphism/deformation, and followed by long pauses ( [...] 75 myr) and clastic sediment deposition. Some of the granitic intrusions {{in the region are}} subvolcanic, which can be determined through the comparative chemical analysis of the intrusion and associated greenstones. All of these cycles are interpreted {{to be the result of}} successive mantle plume events. These events resulted in the overall dome (granite) and syncline (greenstone) structure of the region, which can still be seen on modern geologic maps. The overall thickness of this succession during its formation and the geochemical analysis indicating that these rocks were mantle derived supports that this region was formed as a thick volcanic plateau.|$|E

30|$|Three Cenozoic {{episodes of}} {{volcanic}} activity accompanied by <b>magmatic</b> <b>intrusions</b> that caused brittle fracturing {{of the surrounding}} sandstones have been identified. Quartz and feldspar particles show cracking on their margins related to thermal expansion due to heating. Because of the high temperatures, and the CO 2 and SO 2 which were carried by the hydrothermal fluids associated with the <b>magmatic</b> <b>intrusions,</b> the host sandstones were subjected to thermal alteration, {{which led to the}} precipitation of an assemblage of hydrothermal minerals such as celestite, zircon, apatite, barite, and cerous phosphate. In addition, authigenic quartz and illite were formed due to the influence of hydrothermal fluids on the surrounding rocks.|$|R

To model such hydrothermal systems, we consider single, cylindrical intrusions of 4 km height 2 km below the surface. Our preliminary results of modeling hydrothermal systems associated with <b>magmatic</b> <b>intrusions</b> in the Martian environment suggest that such systems, if associated with intrusions of several 10 (exp 2) km(exp 3) or larger, in the presence of permeable, water-rich subsurface should be able to provide adequate discharges of water over the time periods needed to form fluvial valleys.

40|$|International audienceThe Cretaceous and Triassic {{argillaceous}} rocks {{from the}} passive margin of Greenland {{have been investigated}} in order to detect the thermal aureole of <b>magmatic</b> <b>intrusions,</b> ranging from metric dyke to kilometric syenite pluton. Rock-Eval data (Tmax generally 0. 3), all indicate a maximum of 5 km burial for the argillaceous rocks whatever the distance to an intrusion. The K-Ar dating of the clays < 2 μm fraction suggests that illites are mostly detrital, except near <b>magmatic</b> <b>intrusions</b> where younger ages are recorded. To get {{more information about the}} extent of the thermal aureole, rock magnetism data were determined. At distance away from the thermal aureole of the syenite intrusion, Triassic argillaceous rocks reveal a standard magnetic assemblage compatible with their burial (R₀ ∼ 0. 4 percent). It is constituted essentially by neoformed stoichiometric magnetite (Fe₃O₄. In contrast, within the thermal aureole of the <b>magmatic</b> <b>intrusions,</b> the Cretaceous argillaceous rocks contain micron-sized pyrrhotite (Fe₇S₈, firmly identified through the recognition of Besnus transition at 35 K. The thermal demagnetization of natural remanence carried by this pyrrhotite shows a diagnostic 'square shouldered' pattern, indicating a narrow grain size distribution of pyrrhotite. The extension of this diagnostic pyrrhotite maps a ∼ 10 -km-thick aureole around the syenitic pluton. Away from this aureole, the magnetic assemblage is diagnostic of those found in argillaceous rocks where organic matter is mature...|$|R
40|$|Organic and {{inorganic}} thermal indicators {{throughout the}} Late Paleozoic sedimentary fill of the Aragon-Bearn Basin {{in the western}} Pyrenees, integrated with stratigraphic and structural data, point to a two-stage tectonic evolution: (i) High heat flow values and widespread <b>magmatic</b> <b>intrusions</b> driven by deeply rooted strike-slip faults characterized the first stage. This regime accompanied the rapid and localized deposition of the lower sedimentary succession and ended with uplift and erosion. (ii) The second stage was characterized by lower heat flow values, shallower strike-slip faults active during the deposition of an upper transgressive sedimentary succession and minor <b>magmatic</b> <b>intrusions.</b> The upper portion of the succession (Unidad Roja Superior, mainly Upper Permian in age) records maximum temperatures between 100 - 110 and 150 degrees C as indicated by KI values between 0. 57 and 0. 94 420, illite content in mixed layer illite-smectite of 85 - 92 %, and fluid inclusions in host-rock quartz-calcite cements. Local thermal maturity anomalies affected selected portions of the Late Paleozoic sedimentary succession with organic matter and clay minerals reaching respectively Ro%: 4. 2 - 4. 7 % and KI up to 0. 32 420 in the lower sequence, and Ro% 2. 9 % in the upper sequence. These localized anomalies {{with respect to the}} basin thermal signature are the result of contact metamorphism related to the emplacement of <b>magmatic</b> <b>intrusions</b> across the sedimentary fill during two different magmatic events...|$|R
40|$|Many {{prospective}} sedimentary basins {{contain a}} variety of extrusive volcanic products that are ultimately sourced from volcanoes. However, seismic reflection-based studies of magmatic rift basins have {{tended to focus on}} the underlying magma plumbing system, meaning that the seismic characteristics of volcanoes are not well understood. Additionally, volcanoes have similar morphologies to hydrothermal vents, which are also linked to underlying <b>magmatic</b> <b>intrusions.</b> In this study, we use high resolution 3 D seismic and well data from the Bass Basin, offshore southern Australia, to document 34 cone- and crater-type vents of Miocene age. The vents overlie <b>magmatic</b> <b>intrusions</b> and have seismic properties indicative of a volcanic origin: their moderate–high amplitude upper reflections and zones of “wash-out” and velocity pull-up beneath. The internal reflections of the vents are similar to those found in lava deltas, suggesting they are composed of volcaniclastic material. This interpretation is corroborated by data from exploration wells which penetrated the flanks of several vents. We infer that the vents we describe are composed of hyaloclastite and pyroclasts produced during submarine volcanic eruptions. The morphology of the vents is typical of monogenetic volcanoes, consistent with the onshore record of volcanism on the southern Australian margin. Based on temporal, spatial and volumetric relationships, we propose that submarine volcanoes can evolve from maars to tuff cones as a result of varying magma-water interaction efficiency. The morphologies of the volcanoes and their links to the underlying feeder systems are superficially similar to hydrothermal vents. This highlights the need for careful seismic interpretation and characterization of vent structures linked to <b>magmatic</b> <b>intrusions</b> within sedimentary basins...|$|R

50|$|The Ceraunius Fossae are tectonic {{features}} indicating stresses in the planet's lithosphere.

Most of the tectonic {{features in the}} western hemisphere of Mars are explained by crustal deformation from the Tharsis bulge (a huge volcanic mass up to 7 km high that covers nearly a quarter of the planet’s surface). Among the processes proposed to explain the tectonic features associated with Tharsis are domal uplifting, <b>magmatic</b> <b>intrusion,</b> and volcanic loading (deformation due to the large, sagging weight of the volcanic mass).|$|E

50|$|A {{structure}} that plunges {{in all directions}} to form a circular or elongate structure is a dome. Domes may be created via diapirism from underlying <b>magmatic</b> <b>intrusions</b> or upwardly mobile, mechanically ductile material such as rock salt (salt dome) and shale (shale diapir) that cause deformations and uplift in the surface rock. The Richat Structure of the Sahara is considered a dome that has been laid bare by erosion.|$|R
40|$|A {{conceptual}} {{model of the}} Taupo Volcanic Zone (TVZ) is developed, {{to a depth of}} 25 km, formed from three constant density layers. The upper layer is formed from eruption products. A constant rate of eruption is assumed, which eventually implies a constant rate of extension, and a constant rate of volumetric creation in the middle and bottom layers. Tectonic extension creates volume which can accomodate <b>magmatic</b> <b>intrusions.</b> Spreading models assume this volume is distributed throughout the whole region, perhaps in vertical dykes, whereas rifting models assume the upper crust is thinned and the volume created lies under this upper crust. Bounds on the heat flow from such <b>magmatic</b> <b>intrusions</b> are calculated. Heat flow calculations are performed and some examples are provided which match the present total heat output from the TVZ of about 4200 MW, but these either have extension rates greater than the low values of about 8 ± 4 mm/a being reported from GPS measurements, or else consider extension rates in the TVZ to have varied over time...|$|R
50|$|Periodically, {{there have}} been {{fluctuations}} in the level and activity of the lake. In the 1870s it was deep; after a phreatic eruption nearby in 1880, the lake disappeared and formed a fountain of hot water and steam. Another phreatic eruption lowered the lake level by some 10 m from December 2004 to April 2005; later the lake level rose again, refilling the lake in just one day. The rapid draining and refilling of the lake implies that it is suspended above the local water table. A continuous flux of steam or gas generated by an underlying <b>magmatic</b> <b>intrusion</b> drives water up into the lake. A disturbance to the supply of gas can cause the lake to drain through the porous connection that normally allows steam to rise and heat the lake.|$|E
50|$|The Hornitos basin is the {{precursor}} of the caldera, and the Lavas de Sierra La Dichosa form a precaldera stage. During the Cretaceous-Paleocene {{a group of}} stratovolcanoes formed in the area. Their eruption products are basalt and trachybasalt containing olivine and pyroxene. <b>Magmatic</b> <b>intrusion</b> triggered the formation of ring faults which then allowed the eruption of pyroclastic flows during caldera collapse. After the collapse, dacitic lava flows in the central sector of the caldera form the first postcollapse volcanism. Reestablishment of the volcanic system {{was strong enough to}} form another sequence, 1100 m thick, of pumice and pyroclastics, possibly the consequence of another caldera collapse. The Cabeza de Vaca pluton formed within the caldera, using the western caldera rim and the annular fracture. Activity occurred in the Paleocene-Eocene, with the pluton dated 63-59.8 mya.

Rock falls often occur during periods of increased deformation and can be a sign of increased activity in absence of instrumental monitoring. Mud flows (lahars) are remobilized hydrated ash deposits from pyroclastic flows and ash fall deposits, moving downslope even at very shallow angles at high speed. Because of their high density they are capable of moving large objects such as loaded logging trucks, houses, bridges, and boulders. Their deposits usually form a second ring of debris fans around volcanic edifices, the inner fan being primary ash deposits. Downstream of the deposition of their finest load, lahars can still pose a sheet flood hazard from the residual water. Lahar deposits can take many months to dry out, until they can be walked on. The hazards derived from lahar activity can exist several years after a large explosive eruption.|$|E
30|$|Magmatism {{occurs in}} many {{sedimentary}} basins {{around the world}} and has {{a significant impact on the}} generation, migration, and accumulation of oil and gas as well as the formation of hydrocarbon reservoirs due to the two following mechanisms (Ye et al. 2005; Agusto et al. 2013). (1) Thermal baking caused by the <b>magmatic</b> <b>intrusion</b> heats the surrounding rocks and results in mineral transformations. The thermal baking effect on hydrocarbon source rocks accelerates the generation of alkanes, organic acids, and carbon dioxide (Guo 2002).
