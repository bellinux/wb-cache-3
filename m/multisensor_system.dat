The purpose of this research was evaluation of the capabilities of a <b>multisensor</b> <b>system</b> for instrumental assessment of the samples bitterness. 33 samples of medicinal plants were evaluated by tasters according to bitterness intensity from 0 to 6. Methodology of the analysis was developed and repeated measurements of the samples were performed by <b>multisensor</b> <b>system.</b> Tasters’ assessments were used as reference data while <b>multisensor</b> <b>system</b> calibrating. A regression model built according to these data displayed good correlation of the system response with bitterness perceived by people. The parameters of the regression model give the possibility for concluding that the <b>multisensor</b> <b>system</b> is capable to predict the bitterness of the medicinal plants preparations with average precision equal to ± 1 of the reference bitterness scale. Relative error of bitterness determination is 14 %, which is a good result for such type of measurements (typical error of the taster’s assessment is, as a rule, in the range of 15 - 30 %) ...|$|E

40|$|The rearing {{of poultry}} for meat {{production}} (broilers) is an agricultural food industry with high {{relevance to the}} economy and development of some countries. Periodic episodes of extreme climatic conditions during the summer season can cause high mortality among birds, resulting in economic losses. In this context, ventilation systems within poultry houses play a critical role to ensure appropriate indoor climatic conditions. The objective {{of this study was to}} develop a <b>multisensor</b> <b>system</b> to evaluate the design of the ventilation system in broiler houses. A measurement system equipped with three types of sensors: air velocity, temperature and differential pressure was designed and built. The system consisted in a laptop, a data acquisition card, a multiplexor module and a set of 24 air temperature, 24 air velocity and two differential pressure sensors. The system was able to acquire up to a maximum of 128 signals simultaneously at 5 second intervals. The <b>multisensor</b> <b>system</b> was calibrated under laboratory conditions and it was then tested in field tests. Field tests were conducted in a commercial broiler farm under four different pressure and ventilation scenarios in two sections within the building. The calibration curves obtained under laboratory conditions showed similar regression coefficients among temperature, air velocity and pressure sensors and a high goodness fit (R 2 = 0. 99) with the reference. Under field test conditions, the <b>multisensor</b> <b>system</b> showed a high number of input signals from different locations with minimum internal delay in acquiring signals. The variation among air velocity sensors was not significant. The developed <b>multisensor</b> <b>system</b> was able to integrate calibrated sensors of temperature, air velocity and differential pressure and operated succesfully under different conditions in a mechanically-ventilated broiler farm.

40|$|We {{describe}} an approach which facilitates and makes explicit {{the organization of}} the knowledge necessary to map multi-sensor system requirements onto an appropriate assembly of algorithms, processors, sensors, and actuators. We have previously introduced the <b>multisensor</b> kernel <b>system</b> and logi-cal sensor specifications as a means for high-level specifi-cation of <b>multisensor</b> <b>systems.</b> The main goals of such a characterization are to develop a coherent treatment of multi-sensor information, to allow system reconfiguration for both fault tolerance and dynamic response to environmental con-ditions, and to permit the explicit description of control. In this paper we show how logical sensors can be incorpo-rated into an object-based approach for the interpretation of 3 D structure. Considering the inherent difficulties in inter-preting general configurations of lines in space, and consider-ing the ubiquitousness of special line configurations in manu-factured environments and objects, we advocate the use of computational units tuned to the occurrence of special config-urations. The organized use of these units circumvents the inherent difficulties in interpreting general configurations of lines. After a brief examination of the problem of interpreting general configurations of lines in space, a number of compu-tational units are proposed which are naturally derived from angular relations. The process of propagation (which allows interpretation to spread over the image) is also advocated. Such computational units and processes, which are simple and efficient, can be conveniently organized in a rule-based framework where the occurrence of the various special config-urations can be tested. The <b>multisensor</b> knowledge <b>system</b> provides such a framework. 1...|$|R
