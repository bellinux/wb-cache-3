However, current {{studies suggest that the}} transition path relies on the employer`s side and behavioural aspects. Hence, the purpose of this thesis is to compare how the Youth Guarantee policy defines or understands (disadvantaged) young people's School-to-Work transition process in Austria and Finland. The research explores the linkage of Institutions and welfare production system that steer the transition process. The transition path is analysed using the data of Youth Guarantee Policy Paper while combining the theoretical framework of the Variety of Capitalism. The analysis shows three significant aspects of (disadvantaged) youngsters` transition path: There are 1) institutional co-operation and complementarities between the core actors, 2) system coordination with extensive networking, and 3) the reproduction of competency. The study demonstrated certain transitional similarities, dissimilarities and variations of both countries' coordinated <b>market</b> <b>economies</b> <b>systems.</b> However, the findings show that corporate and regulative governance society relies on different strategic interaction. Hence, these have led to uncertainty, challenges, and social exclusion faced by youngsters.
