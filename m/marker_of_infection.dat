Methodology/Principal Findings: We analysed data on the prevalence of ocular infection with Chlamydia trachomatis and of active trachoma disease among 4, 436 individuals from two communities in The Gambia (West Africa) and two communities in Tanzania (East Africa). An age- and household-structured mathematical model of transmission was fitted to these data using maximum likelihood. The presence of active inflammatory disease as a <b>marker</b> <b>of</b> <b>infection</b> in a household was, in general, significantly more sensitive (between 79 % [95 %CI: 60 %– 92 %] and 86 % [71 %– 95 %] across the four communities) than as a <b>marker</b> <b>of</b> <b>infection</b> in an individual (24 % [16 %– 33 %]– 66 % [56 %– 76 %]).

40|$|Early {{differentiation}} between infection and aseptic inflammation {{is difficult and}} is a challenge often faced in the rheumatology practice.

40|$|The use of {{serological}} screening assays {{is critical}} in ensuring the safety of transplantations for recipients in regards to transmission of infectious agents.

While {{there was a significant difference}} in the mean and variance of total protein concentration in cadaveric and control donors and a significant difference in the variance of albumin concentration in the two populations, no significant difference was found in the mean concentrations of IgG, IgM or albumin between these groups.
