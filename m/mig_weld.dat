50|$|Spiral welding is {{a process}} where a {{continuous}} full penetration <b>MIG</b> <b>weld</b> overlay is used to rebuild damage from wear, erosion, corrosion or cracking, or to increase the dimensions of a component to match an increased dimension on a mating part. Using the Spiral weld process eliminates the possible distortion of the component due to unbalanced stresses from normal welding processes. Spiral welding is a low energy input process, during which individual layers of weld and their associated heat affected zones are tempered and the grain structures refined by subsequent and overlapping temper beads.|$|E
5000|$|The re-installation of the {{repaired}} or renewed panels {{requires that}} the panels be trial fitted and aligned, to check their fit, that their shape 'flows' and the gaps between panels are correct. Consistent gaps {{are very important to}} a quality finish. Gapping gauges are available for this. The doors, hood, and trunk should open and close properly, and there should be no interference or rubbing. Steel or aluminium door skins and wing/fender edges can generally be adjusted with a hammer and dolly, in extreme cases a pulsed <b>MIG</b> <b>weld</b> bead on a panel edge, that is shaped with a grinder and file, can be good solution. At one time it was common practice to use lead loading to achieve tight panel gaps, especially in the coachbuilding business, but also on the production line. Lead loading is highly skilled, and requires safety precautions because ingested lead or fumes are toxic. The panels have to 'look right' together. This is a process of repeated adjustment, because the adjustment of one panel often affects the apparent fit of another. If there are multiple styling lines {{on the side of a}} car, it is generally best to align doors on the most prominent one. When the panels on the car are satisfactory, they should be primed and painted a correct historical color for the vehicle if the restoration is striving for historical accuracy. An owner might want to have the car painted to look like a particular specialty vehicle such as a police car, or a delivery van painted to look like it would have in grandfather's company colors, etc. Individual painting of the panels is generally the correct approach, as this will result in all parts of the panel being painted as opposed to partially re-assembling and then painting, leaving parts of the assembly that are touching or [...] "blind" [...] unpainted. It is useful to mark in some way, if possible, where the panels fit before removal for painting, to aid re-fitting. The separate painting approach should also result in no overspray on other parts of the since they will not be on the car at that point. It is important when re-assembling painted panels to be aware that the paint is at its thinnest, and most easily damaged on corners, edges, and raised styling lines, and to take extra care with them, such as temporarily taping with masking tape. This is also important when using ultra fine wet flatting paper before polishing, (or when using an electric polishing mop) for the best mirror like finish.|$|E

This paper presents the work conducted on the material characterizations of a TIG-MIG hybrid welded joint of type 304 austenitic stainless steel. The welding processes were conducted in three phases. The phases of welding employed are MIG welding using a current of 170 A, TIG welding using the current of 190 A, and a hybrid TIG-MIG welding with currents of 190 / 170 A respectively. The MIG, TIG, and hybrid TIG-MIG weldments were characterized with incomplete penetration, full penetration and excess penetration of weld.
