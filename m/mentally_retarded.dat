However, where Estes {{planned to use}} the network of conservative churches in the city, many members were discouraged from working with {{him because he was}} a Mormon. The tone of the advertising for the campaign was more dire than in Miami; ads claimed homosexuals were responsible for half the murders and suicides in major cities and half the cases of syphilis. Perhaps the most significant factor of the campaign was Estes' co-chair, a police officer named Dennis Falk.

The Landschulheim Herrlingen opened on 1 May 1926 as a private boarding school with 18 children ranging in age from 6 to 12.

25|$|Some of the {{scientists}} who worked with Genie, including Jay Shurley, concluded based on non-linguistic evidence {{that she had been}} <b>mentally</b> <b>retarded</b> from birth and that this rendered it impossible to be completely certain about the utility of studying her language acquisition. During his sleep studies Shurley had uncovered, among a few other persistent abnormalities in her sleep, a highly elevated number of sleep spindles, which are characteristic of people born with severe retardation. However, the linguists who studied Genie firmly believed that she possessed at least average intelligence at birth and argued that the abuse and isolation she suffered during her childhood had left her functionally retarded. Curtiss specifically noted that some of Genie's linguistic capabilities, such as her clear ability to distinguish gender in her speech, were very uncharacteristic of someone born <b>mentally</b> <b>retarded.</b> Other linguists analyzing Genie's case, including Steven Pinker, have concurred with Curtiss' position.|$|E

40|$|Self-actualization {{is sought}} by all people. Experience with mental difference, {{both as a}} patient and as a staff member in a mental {{hospital}} leads to {{a greater understanding of}} the meaning and nature of this difference. It arises from variations in biographical experience, social interactions, personal frame and self-choice. Providing the mentally different with the responsibility of at least limited choice empowers them while affirming their human dignity and worth. During the years 1975 – 1978, I lived through what I consider to be a unique experience. I became emotionally and mentally different from normal persons— first as an outpatient and later as an inpatient in a state mental hospital. This first episode was immediately followed by employment in a state institution for the chronically <b>mentally</b> ill/mentally <b>retarded,</b> initially as an orderly, then as an administrator and counselor. Thus, I experienced mental difference from "both sides"—as patient 1 and clinician. As a Ph. D. candidate in sociology at that time, I was able to reflect sociologically on events even as I experienced them. I would like to share this experience in order to perhaps convey some in-sight. Humanistic, existential, and symbolic interaction theoretical perspectives are used to explicate mental difference as self-negation or affirmation of personal meaning, self-labeling, institutionalization, treatment as violence, alienation, in-visibility, journey into self, restrained choice of self, and self-actualization...|$|R

40|$|An unusual {{case of the}} cri-du-chat {{syndrome}} is described in a 6 ½ year old boy, who, as well as attacks of stridor and choking, showed disorders of spatial perception and cerebellar signs {{in the form of}} nystagmus, clumsiness of the hands, and ataxia. Pyramidal signs were also present. He was only mildly <b>retarded</b> <b>mentally.</b> Psychological testing showed that he had a severe deficit for number processing, and also constructional apraxia. Surprisingly, his vocabulary was quite good, as was his reading capacity. Chromosome analysis showed a very small deletion of the short arm of the group B chromosome. In infancy this diagnosis may be suspected because of the high-pitched cry and attacks of stridor and choking. In late childhood, when the signs may be only of a neurological disorder, its recognition may be difficult without confirmation from chromosome studies.

40|$|The {{case for}} legal {{regulation}} of biomedical technology {{used to be}} easy to argue. A decade ago, it was clear that this technology had a dramatic impact on issues of far-reaching public significance, that many of these issues were not being systematically addressed by anyone, and that others were being considered only by physicians and biological scientists from a very narrow perspective. The argument for systematic law-making in the resolution of these issues was easy and, during the past few years, that argument seems in large part to have prevailed. Congres- sional establishment of the National Commission for Pro- tection of Human Subjects of Behavioral and Biomedical Research, with its wide-ranging statutory jurisdiction, is one indication of this trend. The California 2 ̆ 2 Natural Death Act 2 ̆ 2 is another. A third indication is the current willingness of judges to enter into previously sacrosanct medical territory, to proclaim principles of 2 ̆ 2 informed con- sent 2 ̆ 2 for doctor/patient relations or 2 ̆ 2 rights to treatment 2 ̆ 2 for institutionalized <b>mentally</b> ill or <b>retarded</b> persons...|$|R
5000|$|In his 1896 APA paper, cited to be {{the first}} {{instance}} of his use and explanation of the term [...] "Clinical Psychology," [...] Witmer outlined four main goals for his new discipline. Firstly, it was to focus on the investigation of mental and moral retardation by means of statistical and clinical methods. Secondly, clinical psychology as a discipline was to establish more psychological clinics and hospitals specifically for children suffering from retardation or physical defects that inhibit academic progress. The discipline was to focus on the creation of opportunities for those in other disciplines, such as teaching, medicine and social work to observe and work with retarded and normal children. Witmer's fourth goal was to train more psychologist to become expert in working with <b>mentally</b> and/or morally <b>retarded</b> clients. In this same paper, Witmer outlined the main concern of clinical psychology: that the discipline focus on active clinical intervention for the purpose of the restoration and treatment of mentally or morally disabled individuals. According to Witmer, for clinical psychology to actually be of any worth, it needed to help and improve clients' mental health and well-being.|$|R

When Genie was 14 months old, she came down with a fever and pneumonitis and her parents took her to a pediatrician who had not previously seen her.

50|$|The anti-death penalty {{movement}} slowly {{rose again}} {{after a brief}} moment of rest due to the reinstatement of capital punishment in many states. This time, however, the movement sprung {{in the form of}} a wide range of organizations rather than in the form of litigation and lawyers. Some of the most influential organizations who continue to work against capital punishment today include Amnesty International USA, the American Civil Liberties Union, the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund, and the National Coalition to Abolish the Death Penalty. The works of these organizations have brought about various restrictions on the use of capital punishment. Juveniles and the <b>mentally</b> ill or <b>retarded</b> can no longer be executed. In addition, the Supreme Court has made it more difficult to discriminate within the capital punishment process. Rather than possessing leaders and members who are possible beneficiaries of the movement’s success, the anti-death penalty movement is composed of “moral entrepreneurs” who speak up for those who are under threat of being executed. Membership is not as strong as those of mass movements because it is often composed of “paper membership,” which means members are with a group that represents other issues as well or members are involved in multiple other issue-oriented projects.|$|R
40|$|Shamanism’ is a {{problematic}} and contested concept. After Westerners {{first heard the}} term in Siberia {{at the end of}} the seventeenth century, it rapidly acquired a remarkable range of meanings in different contexts. Theologians saw shamans as sidekicks of the devil, enlightenment thinkers considered them as <b>mentally</b> ill or <b>retarded.</b> From the eighteenth century onwards, the Romantic image of the shaman as an artistically gifted mystic became fashionable, whereas nineteenth-century folklorists, in turn, used the term ‘shamanism’ in nationalist quests for the essence of the Volksgeist of their nation. Twentieth-century psychologists identified shamans both as schizophrenics and as primal therapists. During the 1960 s shamans came to be perceived as psychonauts who used hallucinogens to gain access to the divine essence of life. During the 1970 s an American anthropologist created workshops that, he claimed, were based on universal shamanic principles and practices. Through so-called archaic techniques his students could get in touch with the healing forces of nature. Contemporary forms of shamanism present themselves as countercultural, but a historical-sociological interpretation suggests that it is no coincidence that shamanism especially gained popularity at the time that neoliberal capitalism became dominant. Neoliberalisation disempowered people over their working lives and forced them to exert self-authority and make choices in their lives. Contemporary shamanic practices are also focused on self-authority, can be consumed in a free market and offer opportunities for empowerment. Instead of changing society, however, contemporary Western shamanism contributes to structure the structures it claims to resist. ...|$|R
