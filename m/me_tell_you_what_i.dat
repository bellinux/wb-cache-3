500|$|I'm {{proud of}} my service to this country. If you love your country, you serve her. During a time of war, {{during a time of}} {{economic}} hardship, when asked to serve your country in a sensitive position where you can actually bring a background to help your nation, I'm the kind of person who's going to stand up and do it, and I'll take that philosophy to my grave... In terms of the stimulus you talked about, it was failed. [...] And let <b>me</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> talked about with respect to the stimulus. I talked about the need for more tax cuts in the stimulus... We had done historic tax cuts. We created a flat tax in the state of Utah, exactly what needs to happen in this country. We got the economy moving. We became the number-one job creator in this nation and the best managed state. That's exactly what needs to happen in this nation. I am running on my record, and I am proud to run on my record.|$|E
2500|$|The {{impact of}} the bicycle on female {{emancipation}} should not be underestimated. The safety bicycle gave women unprecedented mobility, contributing to their larger participation {{in the lives of}} Western nations. As bicycles became safer and cheaper, more women had access to the personal freedom they embodied, and so the bicycle came to symbolise the New Woman of the late nineteenth century, especially in Britain and the United States. Feminists and suffragists recognised its transformative power. Susan B. Anthony said, [...] "Let <b>me</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> think of bicycling. I think it has done more to emancipate women than anything else in the world. It gives women a feeling of freedom and self-reliance. I stand and rejoice every time I see a woman ride by on a wheel...the picture of free, untrammeled womanhood." [...] In 1895 Frances Willard, the tightly laced president of the Women’s Christian Temperance Union, wrote a book called How I Learned to Ride the Bicycle (described in Bicycling magazine as [...] "the greatest book ever written on learning to ride"), in which she praised the bicycle she learned to ride late in life, and which she named [...] "Gladys", for its [...] "gladdening effect" [...] on her health and political optimism. Willard used a cycling metaphor to urge other suffragists to action, proclaiming, [...] "I would not waste my life in friction when it could be turned into momentum." [...] Elizabeth Robins Pennell started cycling in the 1870s in Philadelphia, and from the 1880s onwards brought out a series of travelogues about her cycling journeys around Europe, from A Canterbury Pilgrimage to Over the Alps on a Bicycle. In 1895 Annie Londonderry became the first woman to bicycle around the world.|$|E

6000|$|... "I think I am on {{the right}} track," [...] {{answered}} Tom. [...] "Let <b>me</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>what</b> I've done. In the first place, I visited the haunted house yesterday morning, and went through it from cellar to garret." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I know he is," [...] I returned. [...] "Let <b>me</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>what</b> {{evidence}} I {{have seen}} of it." [...] And I {{told him what}} I had not mentioned in my narrative, of that encounter with the other convict.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am sorry}} to annoy you," [...] he said, [...] "but I must insist that to me the {{situation}} {{does not appear to}} be without some encouraging features. Let <b>me</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>what</b> has happened to me since we parted." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, what I KNOW {{about myself}} isn't really worth telling," [...] said Anne eagerly. [...] "If you'll only let <b>me</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> IMAGINE about myself you'll think it ever {{so much more}} interesting." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank you," [...] I said to her, simply. [...] "I do {{not think}} that these papers are worth five thousand. Let <b>me</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> came here for. I am a {{messenger}} from the Duke of Rowchester." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Which {{of those}} two flowers are you like, and which is she like? Let <b>me</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> think. You are most like the rose, Mary--that is to me the sweetest and most {{beautiful}} of all flowers." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Give her up!' {{cried the}} old man. 'Come! Give {{her up to}} <b>me!</b> <b>Tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> have done with her. Quick! I have made no {{promises}} on that score. <b>Tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> have done with her.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Me don't like it, incos. <b>Me</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>what</b> we do. We keep over to left, {{and then}} when we get just through the bush we fire our guns. Then the Kaffirs very much {{surprised}} and all run that way, and you ride straight through." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have never}} hidden {{anything}} from you, Merton, only to-night I felt strongly inclined to conceal {{what was in}} my mind. Let <b>me</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>what</b> it is; and will you, Merton, on your part, be as open with me and show the same confidence in my love that I have in yours?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now let <b>me</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> found out," [...] said Dickory, [...] "you {{must know}} it. These men are wicked robbers. I slipped quietly among {{them to find}} out something, with my {{shilling}} in my hand, ready to ask somebody to change, if I was noticed." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Whoa, Mary! Back up! I {{said what}} I said because I meant it. I ain't thinkin' what Mary thinks. What I was thinkin'.... Let <b>me</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> was thinkin'. I said buryin' association, didn't I? Well, {{it was not}} {{with the idea of}} castin' gloom over this merry gatherin'. Far be it...." ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{could not}} help smiling at the earnest {{directness}} of her answer, {{though he did not}} like it. [...] "I am sorry," [...] he said, [...] "that you should have so poor an opinion of me. And, now, let <b>me</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> was going to say this morning, that my only object in finding your cousin was to know the man who had been engaged to Miss March." ...|$|E
5000|$|Now, if {{you want}} higher wages, let <b>me</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>what</b> to doYou {{got to talk to}} the workers in the shop with you You got to build you a union, got to make it strong But if you all stick together, boys, it won't be long You'll get shorter hours, better working conditions, {{vacations}} with pay ... take your kids to the seashore.|$|R
50|$|Shortly {{before you}} asked about “What is sufism?”. Kindly let <b>me</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>what</b> is Sufism {{with a couple}} of example from our history. The wife of Mahmut II, Bezm-i Âlem Valide Sultan is writing “Servants will not be scolded because of {{breaking}} goods, the heart of them will not broken.” to a corner of the charitable foundation founded in Damascus. That is exactly what is Sufism.|$|R
6000|$|... "What I {{said last}} night!" [...] {{repeated}} Bob, now thoroughly mystified. [...] "In mercy to <b>me</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> mean, and don't stand there mooning away like that." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Sure! You {{know what}} I was, Rachel. Let <b>me</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> am. I have lost every {{interest}} in life, but {{my interest in}} you. A transformation has come over me which I can't account for, myself. Would you believe it? My charitable business is an unendurable nuisance to me; and when I see a Ladies' Committee now, I wish myself at the uttermost ends of the earth!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Indeed," [...] {{he replied}} suspiciously. [...] "I {{should have thought}} the stone in it was worth more than that, although, of course, it may be nothing but glass. The engraving, too, is first-rate. Adams," [...] he added with severity, [...] "you are trying to hoax us, but let <b>me</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> thought you knew by this time--that you can't take in Ptolemy Higgs. This ring is a shameless swindle; but who did the Hebrew on it? He's a good scholar, anyway." ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{shook his}} head. [...] "So far as Christianity {{is defined by}} its creeds, I am not a Christian. If {{we are going to}} call any sort of {{religious}} feeling that has a respect for Jesus, Christianity, then no doubt I am a Christian. But so was Mohammed at that rate. Let <b>me</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> believe. I believe in God, I believe in the immediate presence of God in every human life, I believe that our lives have to serve the Kingdom of God...." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He's {{been there}} for the last fifteen years. Poor old fellow! He's awfully cut up about this Church Question. I shouldn't have thought he'd have taken {{anything}} so much to heart. There are worse fellows than Browborough, let <b>me</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you.</b> <b>What's</b> all this I hear about the Duke poisoning the foxes?" [...] But the crowd had begun to move, and Phineas was not called upon to answer the question.|$|R
6000|$|Then let <b>me</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>what</b> Mr. Russell said to me. 'Napoleon,' said he, 'has {{been too}} fin for the English Government. He made us {{acknowledge}} the Tuscan vote. Now he has strictly forbidden Piedmont to accept, and Piedmont must therefore refuse. The consequences {{of which will}} be that there must be another vote in Tuscany, by which Prince Napoleon will be elected; and we, having acknowledged the first vote, must acknowledge the second.' ...|$|R
5000|$|If {{you want}} higher wages, let <b>me</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>what</b> to do [...] The lyrics of [...] "Talking Union" [...] {{describe}} {{the process of}} starting a union, and common roadblocks and issues that an organizer faces with ways to get around them. The song is both informative and humorous. It {{was designed as a}} [...] "magnetic" [...] song, used to encourage people to join labor unions.Critics have described the lyrical themes of the song as broadly non-interventionist.|$|R
6000|$|... "They {{discovered}} me. They {{have killed}} me for it. But before I die let <b>me</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> know. A {{little more of}} that wine, please! Quick! Quick! I am very near the end. My strength is going. Listen to me! The powder is stored in the Mother Superior's room. The wall is pierced, {{and the end of}} the train is in Sister Angela's cell, next the chapel. All was ready two days ago. But they discovered a letter and they tortured me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Excellency," [...] I cried, [...] "since you met me {{you have}} hinted at {{something}} that I am hiding from you, at something touching which I {{could give you}} information did I choose. What it may be passes all thought of mine. But this I do assure you: no torture could make <b>me</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> do not know, nor is any torture needed to extract from me such information as I may be possessed of. I do but beg that you wilt frankly question me upon this matter, whatever it may be, and your Excellency shall be answered {{to the best of}} my knowledge." ...|$|E
60|$|MURRAY. And I meant it! This {{place is}} {{honestly}} like heaven to me--a lonely heaven till your arrival. (Eileen looks embarrassed.) And why wouldn't it be? I've no fear for my health--eventually. Just let <b>me</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> was getting away from---- (With a sudden laugh {{full of a}} weary bitterness.) Do {{you know what it}} means to work from seven at night till three in the morning as a reporter on a morning newspaper in a town of twenty thousand people--for ten years? No. You don't. You can't. No one could who hadn't been through the mill. But what it did to me--it made me happy--yes, happy!--to get out here--T.B. and all, notwithstanding.|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes, ma'am," [...] he {{said more}} decidedly {{than he had}} {{hitherto}} spoken. [...] "You can trust <b>me.</b> If <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> want, I will <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> straight whether I can do anything. If I don't like it, the matter shan't go beyond me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, certainly," [...] said Mr. Tolman. [...] "I have eyes, and I {{know all}} about it. Now let <b>me</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> think. When a thing is to be done, {{it ought to be}} done the first time there is a good chance. That's the way I do business. Now you might as well come around here to-morrow {{afternoon}} prepared to propose to Miss Edwards. She is due to-morrow, for she has been two days away. If she doesn't come, we will postpone the matter until the next day. But you should be ready to-morrow. I don't believe you can see her much when you don't meet her here, for that family is expected back very soon, and from what I infer from her account of her employers, you won't care to visit her at their house." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You are going,' she exclaimed, 'and I {{have said}} nothing, I have said nothing; and I shall never see you again. Let <b>me</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> mean. This fortune is yours; {{it must be}} yours. It is an arrow in my heart. Do not think I am {{speaking}} from a momentary impulse. I know myself. I have lived so much alone, I have had so little to deceive or to delude me, that I know myself. If you will not let me do justice you declare my doom. I cannot live if my existence {{is the cause of}} all your prospects being blasted, and the sweetest dreams of your life being defeated. When I die, these riches will be yours; that you cannot prevent. Refuse my present offer, and you seal the fate of that unhappy Flora whose fragile life has hung for years on the memory of your kindness.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Don't turn me away; do see me--do see me!' he said. 'I {{asked for}} Lady Davenant--they {{told me she}} was at home. But it was you I wanted, and I wanted her to help me. I was going away--but I couldn't. You look very ill--do listen to me! You don't understand--I will explain everything. Ah, how ill you look!' the young man cried, as the climax of this sudden, soft, distressed appeal. Laura, for all answer, tried to push past him, but the result of this {{movement}} was that she found herself enclosed in his arms. He stopped her, but she disengaged herself, she got her hand upon the door. He was leaning against it, so she couldn't open it, and as she stood there panting she shut her eyes, so as not to see him. 'If you would let <b>me</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> think--I would do anything in the world for you!' he went on.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{just sit}} down {{by the side of}} your {{daughter}} there and let <b>me</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> both <b>what</b> I think of <b>you</b> and <b>what</b> I'm going to do about it." ...|$|R

[...] He further added [...] "and guess what, I've changed the name and scrapped it; I'm done with Freeze Time; I'm over Freeze Time. The album is coming out which is done, finito, in a few months".|$|R
6000|$|... "MY OWN DEAREST,--I {{have reached}} Paris, and have found my first {{opportunity}} of {{writing to you}} since I left Browndown.
