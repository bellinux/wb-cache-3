While Halle 2 ̆ 019 s new part, Halle-Neustadt, saw a rapid growth of population during the 1960 s and 1970 s, the old city of Halle underwent population losses throughout the whole time of the GDR. During the 1980 s, both parts (at that time two different cities in administrative terms) were stagnating, the old parts of the city suffered from decay. Since 1990, Halle (including Halle-Neustadt) has seen a continuous and rapid process of population loss that hit the city after the systemic change and German reunification. Today, Halle still represents a shrinking city and expects further population losses for the decades to come.

30|$|Cloud-computing {{data centers}} may use VMs to {{consolidate}} workloads {{to reduce the}} number of active servers [9 - 12, 15 - 19]. To ensure that the service level agreement (SLA) is met, cloud-computing data centers may set up upper limits for resource utilization while placing VMs. This may lead to poor utilization of resources due to the dynamics of data center workloads. A scheme that uses dynamic thresholds was proposed considering the following policies for placing VMs: minimization of VM <b>migration,</b> <b>balancing</b> of resource utilization and SLA violation, and random selection [9]. This scheme achieves energy efficiency by allowing a level of SLA violations. Another approach introduces a power management scheme that implements multiple feedback controllers at the levels of racks, servers, and VMs to improve data center energy efficiency [11]. Although reducing the number of active servers in a data center may improve energy efficiency, over-consolidation may jeopardize the quality of the service (QoS) provided by the data center. Maintaining QoS whilst increasing energy efficiency is critical for the economical sustainability of a data center [10, 15 - 17]. Minimizing the number of virtual-machine migrations may be employed to maintain service guarantees and to reduce the energy consumption of cloud-computing data centers [16]. In a more direct approach, jobs may be mapped to the existing computing resources to ensure that the satisfaction of the required QoS of different applications [20]. However, these methods require global knowledge of the state of the data center and, in turn, a fast central controller to perform timely decisions for the dynamic data center networks.|$|R
40|$|OS REGISTROS administrativos dos vistos consulares de residência, mesmo quando disponibilizados, tanto pelos consulados estrangeiros no Brasil quanto por aqueles do país no exterior, não permitem {{calcular}} os fluxos de imigrantes e de emigrantes internacionais, em razão da alta proporção de migrantes clandestinos ou ilegais. Como conseqüência, não se pode saber, a partir dos registros, nem sequer se o Brasil tem tido saldos migratórios internacionais positivos ou negativos. Técnicas indiretas permitem estimar o saldo migratório internacional, a partir das populações enumeradas em dois censos consecutivos. Na data do segundo censo, são comparadas as populações observada (recenseada) e esperada (aquela que se teria, se porventura a população do país tivesse permanecido fechada entre os dois censos). A diferença entre elas corresponde, em princípio, ao saldo migratório internacional. Apesar das dificuldades técnicas, advindas principalmente da significativa variação de cobertura entre os Censos de 1991 e de 2000, concluiu-se que o Brasil teria tido, entre 1980 e 1990, um saldo migratório negativo de aproximadamente 1. 800 mil pessoas. O saldo, também negativo, teria caído significativamente, no decênio 1990 / 2000, para em torno de 550 mil pessoas. Esse declínio teria ocorrido em razão, quase que inteiramente, da diminuição da emigração brasileira. A imigração internacional aumentou muito pouco, como se pode constatar a partir dos dados censitários de 1991 e 2000. ADMINISTRATIVE {{records from}} consular representations in Brazil and abroad are not adequate to estimate international <b>migration</b> <b>balance</b> (the difference between inmigration and emigration) for two main reasons. First, such {{data are not}} always available. Second, even if available, these data are not reliable sources of internatonal migration flows due to underestimation of illegal migration. Thus, {{it is not possible}} to use these records to unveil the magnitude and direction of Brazil’s international <b>migration</b> <b>balance.</b> Indirect techniques allows estimating international <b>migration</b> <b>balance</b> from two consecutive censuses. These techniques involve comparing the population in the second census (the "observed population") and an "expected population", which is an estimation of the closed population in the second census (that is, the expected population in the second census assuming absence of international migration - emigration and inmigration - between the two censuses). The difference between the observed and the closed population is a proxy of the international <b>migration</b> <b>balance.</b> Even considering problems in these estmations, notably the variability in census coverage rates between 1980 and 1991, it can be inferred that Brazil had a negative migraton balance (or alternatively, a higher number of emigrants compared to inmigrants) of about 1. 8 million people. The balance, still negative, felt to about 550, 000 people between 1990 - 2000. This decline can be attributed almost entirely to the decline in Brazilian emigration. The 1991 and 2000 censuses reveal a very small increase in Brazilian international inmigration...|$|E

40|$|The nineteen-seventies {{marked a}} {{turnaround}} {{in the rural}} migration patterns {{and the beginning of}} counterurbanisation in the United States and many Western European countries. The destination area of the counterurban migrants is outside of the metropolitan areas and functional urban areas. Although the changing rural migration patterns can be partially explained with the new spatial division of labour, {{a large part of the}} movements are motivated by lifestyle strategies, pursuing natural amenities. In the countries of the Visegrád Group, because of their lagging development and the interventions of the socialist regimes, preceding stages of the urbanisation process dominated till the political and economic transition. After the transition, not counterurbanisation, but suburbanisation emerged as the most noticeable rural migration process. Moreover, remote rural areas not only became a possible destination for migrants seeking natural amenities but also for low-class people losing their livelihood in the urban areas after the economic transition. The aim of my research is to examine the extent of migration turnaround in the rural areas of the Visegrád countries, with a focus on the differences between central and peripheral areas. Firstly I selected the local administrative units (Lau- 2) of the Visegrád Group which can be considered rural. The overall <b>migration</b> <b>balance</b> of the distinguished rural units turned to positive after the economic transition. I used the temporal distance of large and middle-sized cities to describe the central or peripheral location of the rural municipalities.

The researches showed that distance from the urban centres still pay a key role in the ability of the rural settlements to attract and sustain population. In Hungary and Slovakia, the temporal distance of the capital showed the strongest correlation with the <b>migration</b> <b>balance.</b> In Poland the temporal distance of cities with more than 100000 inbabitants, while in the Czech Republic, the temporal distance from cities with more than 50000 inhabitants proved to be the most significant...|$|E
