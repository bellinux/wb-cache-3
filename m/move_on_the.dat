5|$|As Rosberg was {{comfortably in}} the lead, still 18 seconds ahead of Vettel, Verstappen took ninth place from Massa going into turn one on lap 46. Red Bull {{teammate}} Ricciardo also gained a place, at Hülkenberg's expense, {{at the same}} spot three laps later. With Räikkönen facing a five-second time penalty for crossing the pit exit line, Pérez behind him {{would not have to}} pass him to achieve third place as long as he stayed within five seconds of him. Pérez nevertheless made the <b>move</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> final lap to finish in the final podium position. Meanwhile, Nico Rosberg crossed the line to win the Grand Prix, more than 16 seconds ahead of Sebastian Vettel.|$|E

5|$|De Grasse had {{notified}} {{his counterpart}} in Newport, the Comte de Barras Saint-Laurent, of his intentions and his planned arrival date. Barras sailed from Newport on 27 August with 8 ships of the line, 4 frigates, and 18 transports carrying French armaments and siege equipment. He deliberately sailed via a circuitous route {{in order to}} minimize the possibility of an encounter with the British, should they sail from New York in pursuit.

5|$|For two days, the 34th Infantry {{fought the}} {{advancing}} North Koreans in bitter house-to-house fighting. North Korean soldiers continued to infiltrate the city, often disguised as farmers. The remaining {{elements of the}} 24th Infantry Division were pushed back block-by-block. Without radios, and unable {{to communicate with the}} remaining elements of the division, Dean joined the men on the front lines. At one point, he personally attacked a tank with a hand grenade, destroying it. Large columns of North Korean forces began marching on the city from the south roads, reinforcing those that had crossed the river. American forces pulled back after suffering heavy losses, allowing the North Korean 3rd and 4th divisions to <b>move</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> city freely from the north, south, and east roads. The 24th Infantry Division repeatedly attempted to establish its defensive lines, and was repeatedly pushed back by the numerically superior North Koreans.|$|E

5|$|Many {{of these}} species have adaptations to help in under-water locomotion. Water beetles and water bugs have legs adapted into paddle-like structures. Dragonfly naiads use jet propulsion, {{forcibly}} expelling water out of their rectal chamber. Some species like the water striders are capable of walking {{on the surface of}} water. They can do this because their claws are not at the tips of the legs as in most insects, but recessed in a special groove further up the leg; this prevents the claws from piercing the water's surface film. Other insects such as the Rove beetle Stenus are known to emit pygidial gland secretions that reduce surface tension making it possible for them to <b>move</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> surface of water by Marangoni propulsion (also known by the German term Entspannungsschwimmen).|$|E
5|$|On 29 January 2009, it was {{revealed}} that Newcastle had agreed a £4million fee with Bolton Wanderers, which was confirmed the next day, with Nolan travelling to Tyneside to discuss terms and undergo a medical. Nolan completed his <b>move</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> same day, signing a four and a half-year contract. On 22 February, Nolan received his first red card playing for Newcastle United in a home match against Everton for a two-footed foul on Victor Anichebe. At the end of the season, Newcastle were relegated to the English Championship. Nolan was noted as one of the more vocal Newcastle players over the summer, demanding an end to the off the field distractions at the club, and suggesting the club should be looking to acquire players for an immediate return to the Premier League.|$|E
5|$|Senate {{and house}} legislators who had favored Benton's renegotiated {{version of the}} Texas {{annexation}} bill had been assured that President Tyler would sign the joint house measure, but leave its implementation to the incoming Polk administration. But, during his last day in office, President Tyler, with the urging of his Secretary of State Calhoun, decided to act decisively to improve the odds for the immediate annexation of Texas. On March 3, 1845, with his cabinet's assent, he dispatched an offer of annexation to the Republic of Texas by courier, exclusively {{under the terms of}} the Brown–Foster option of the joint house measure. Secretary Calhoun apprised President-elect Polk of the action, who demurred without comment. Tyler justified his preemptive <b>move</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> grounds that Polk was likely to come under pressure to abandon immediate annexation and reopen negotiations under the Benton alternative.|$|E

5|$|Ten {{months before}} Conran made the movie with his actors, he shot it entirely with stand-ins in Los Angeles and then created the whole movie in {{animatics}} {{so that the}} actors had {{an idea of what}} the film would look like and where to <b>move</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> soundstage. To prepare for the film, Conran had his cast watch old movies, such as Lauren Bacall in To Have and Have Not (1944) for Paltrow's performance and The Thin Man (1934) for the relationship between Nick and Nora that was to be echoed in the one between Joe and Polly. Avnet constantly pushed for room in this meticulously designed movie for the kind of freedom the actors needed, like being able to move around on the soundstage.|$|E
5|$|The city {{immediately}} sued {{to prevent}} the <b>move,</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> basis that the lease of the stadium was active until 1998. Fans were in an uproar, staging protests, signing petitions, filing lawsuits and appealing to other NFL owners to block the relocation. Advertisers {{pulled out of the}} stadium, fearing fans' ire. Talks between the city, Modell and the NFL continued as the Browns finished the season with a 5–11 record. At the team's final home game against the Bengals, unruly fans in the Dawg Pound bleachers section rained debris, beer bottles and entire sections of seats onto the field, forcing officials to move play to the opposite end to ensure players' safety. Cleveland won the game, its only victory after the announcement of the move.|$|E
5|$|After their 2010 separation, Berry and Aubry became {{involved}} in a highly publicized custody battle, centered primarily on Berry's desire to move with their daughter from Los Angeles, where Berry and Aubry resided, to France, the home of French actor Olivier Martinez, whom Berry had started dating in 2010 after they met while filming Dark Tide in South Africa. Aubry objected to the <b>move</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> grounds that it would interfere with their joint custody arrangement. In November 2012, a judge denied Berry's request to move the couple's daughter to France in light of Aubry's objections. Less than two weeks later, on November 22, 2012, Aubry and Martinez were both treated at a hospital for injuries after engaging in a physical altercation at Berry's residence. Martinez performed a citizen's arrest on Aubry, {{and because it was}} considered a domestic violence incident, was granted a temporary emergency protective order preventing Aubry from coming within 100 yards of Berry, Martinez, the child with whom he shares custody with Berry, until November 29, 2012. In turn, Aubry obtained a temporary restraining order against Martinez on November 26, 2012, asserting that the fight began when Martinez threatened to kill Aubry if he did not allow the couple to move to France. Leaked court documents included photos showing significant injuries to Aubry's face, which were widely displayed in the media.|$|E

5|$|As the pit stops {{started on}} lap eleven, Massa, Nico Hülkenberg and Felipe Nasr {{were the first}} to come in for new tyres. Hamilton had managed to extend his {{advantage}} over Vettel to almost 8 seconds when Vettel made a pit stop– the first of the front runners to do so– on lap 14. The undercut-strategy worked, as Rosberg emerged from the pit lane behind the Ferrari when he made a pit stop one lap later. Hamilton changed tyres on the following lap, emerging close in front of the battling Rosberg and Vettel, with the Mercedes driver taking second position in a DRS-aided <b>move</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> inside of turn one. He was now close behind teammate Hamilton, but ultimately unable to attack him for the lead. Räikkönen was the last of the top four to pit, on lap 18 and applied a different strategy, as he used the harder medium tyres, while the Mercedes and Vettel were running their middle stint on the softer tyre compound. Even with the harder tyres, he was able to close to the top three.|$|E
5|$|At Royal Rumble on January 23, 2000, The Rock {{entered the}} Royal Rumble match {{and was one}} of the final two remaining, along with Big Show; Show {{seemingly}} intended to throw The Rock over the top rope in a running powerslam-like position, but Rock countered the <b>move</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ring apron, sending Big Show to the floor before re-entering the ring as the winner. However, The Rock's feet hit the floor first, although those watching the event on TV did not see that, until Big Show proved this with additional video footage, and claimed to be the rightful winner. Despite this proof, the original decision could not be reversed, so a number one contender's match for the WWF Championship was held at No Way Out, which Big Show won after Shane McMahon interfered and hit The Rock in the head with a steel chair as he attempted to execute a People's Elbow. The Rock defeated Big Show on March 13 episode of Raw Is War to regain the right to face the WWF Champion, Triple H, at WrestleMania 2000 in a fatal four-way elimination match, also including Big Show and Mick Foley. Each wrestler had a McMahon in his corner: Triple H had his wife, Stephanie, Foley had Linda, The Rock had Vince and Big Show had Shane. Triple H retained the title after Vince betrayed The Rock by hitting him with a chair.|$|E
5|$|At {{the second}} monument, the Tour of Flanders, BMC was noted to be {{bringing}} a strong squad, headed by Ballan and Hincapie. Burghardt and Van Avermaet {{went on the}} attack in the early portions of the race, only to be brought back after a short while. When Fabian Cancellara put in {{an attack on the}} Leberg, the day's fourteenth cobbled climb, and quickly took a sizable time gap, it was the BMC team which organized the chase to bring him back. They placed four riders into a seven-rider chase group and succeeded in bringing Cancellara back, something which has usually not happened to him in classics races. A further two riders had remained {{at the head of the}} peloton, giving them six riders at the front of the race when Cancellara was caught. Cancellara put in another <b>move</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Muur van Geraardsbergen and was followed only by Sylvain Chavanel and eventual race winner Nick Nuyens. Hincapie finished with the group 5 seconds back for sixth place on the day. Kristoff rode to seventh place in the sprinters' classic Scheldeprijs later in April, back of three-time winner Mark Cavendish.|$|E

5|$|The regular Football League {{returned}} {{in time for}} the 1946–47 season, during which Matthews played 23 league games and was a major contributor to 30 of the club's 41 league goals. Stoke matched their record finish of fourth in the league, finishing just two points shy of champions Liverpool after losing to Sheffield United {{on the final day of}} the season. However, in February Matthews was returning from a knee injury when manager McGrory told him he was not in the first XI for the game against Arsenal; the press reported this as a bust-up. Relations between McGrory, the Stoke City board, and Matthews had indeed always been sour – though once again a story that the players sided against Matthews were untrue. Recalled against Brentford, only after the game did he find out that this was only because he was a last-minute replacement for an injured Bert Mitchell. Matthews put in a second transfer request, which the Stoke board eventually accepted. He selected Blackpool as his next club as he still lived in the area following his service in the RAF; the Stoke board sanctioned the <b>move</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> condition that the deal was to remain a secret until the end of the season, so as to not disrupt the club's title bid. The secret was revealed in a matter of hours, as an unknown person informed the press.|$|E
