50|$|For {{attachment}} {{of electronic}} components to a PCB, proper selection {{and use of}} flux helps prevent oxidation during soldering; {{it is essential for}} good wetting and heat transfer. The soldering iron tip must be clean and pre-tinned with solder to ensure rapid heat transfer. Components which dissipate large amounts of heat during operation are sometimes elevated above the PCB to avoid PCB overheating. After inserting a through-hole mounted component, the excess lead is cut off, leaving a length of about the radius of the pad. Plastic or metal <b>mounting</b> <b>clips</b> or holders may be used with large devices to aid heat dissipation and reduce joint stresses.|$|E

40|$|Fused Deposition Modelling (FDM) {{is one of}} {{a number}} of {{additive}} manufacturing (AM) technologies that are being used for the production of end-use components due to the technologies ability for short production runs and as a method for producing geometrically complex parts. As it is a polymeric process, FDM in general is more flexible and can easily accommodate without significant expense, changes to a products design during the product development cycle (known as rapid prototyping) prior to fabricating end-use functional parts (known as rapid manufacturing (RM)). However, the quality and functional performance of FDM parts is dependent on a number of process parameters including layer thickness, build orientation, etc. Taking all of this into account, these parameters have to be optimised in order to obtain the ideal part, for fit and function testing as well as an end-use product. This paper seeks to depict the optimisation of the FDM process for optimum performance of ABS plastic parts in terms of tensile and shear effects, where the parameter of build orientation is observed. This research uses load bearing exhibition board <b>mounting</b> <b>clips</b> as the case study product. Series of experiments were conducted to attain the maximum load value of clips fabricated via FDM manufactured in different orientations. The orientations are in the y-axis with constraints in x and z-axis with the direction from y = 0 º to y = 180 º in increments of 10 º. The experimental setup for the physical study used a Kern Ch 15 K 20 load gauge to measure the load on the clips for each orientation. From the results, it is found that the build orientation significantly affects the strength performance of FDM parts. This contributes to further research into the development of RM design rules, specifically in design analysis and optimisation for validation of AM as a viable route for producing functional parts...|$|E

30|$|Two of the {{stopcock}} valves {{are used}} to reconfigure the internal fluid paths to perform cartridge trap and release, such as for the preparation of an incoming radioisotope, e.g., solvent exchange of [18 F]fluoride to recover [18 O]H 2 O. The upstream valve selects between incoming fluid from an external addition line (trapping) or the eluent addition position (release). The output of the first stopcock is connected via tubing to a cartridge. The output of the cartridge is connected to a second tube that feeds into a second stopcock valve that selects whether the fluid is directed to a built-in collection vial (trapping) or a line into the position where the reaction vessel is sealed for reagent addition (release). The third stopcock valve is used for cartridge purification of the crude product before transfer to the next reaction vessel. The purification cartridge is installed between the dip tube (for removal of crude product from the reaction vessel) and the tube leading to the stopcock. The outputs of the stopcock are connected to a built-in waste vial (trapping, washing) or an external output line (release) that can be plugged into the next cassette or the high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) injection valve. Cartridges can be <b>mounted</b> on <b>clips</b> {{near the front of}} the cassettes for convenience.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the role of}} cognitive, affective and relational components in online teaching to facilitate the learning and qualify the educational relationship that can be established to a virtual level. Components such as the positive emotional involvement may appropriately be increased through the education technologies (ICT), which enable to expand the personal ability to teach, providing a greater experience of interpersonal contact, something that {{more needs to be}} reinforced and promoted in training online. As part of an empirical investigation conducted to verify the effectiveness of audio-video systems in on-line learning, it has been made a movie by <b>mounting</b> various <b>clips</b> from the relevant film work, classic or newer, for a total of 30 minutes. It was evaluated the level of learning by counting the learning of the concepts learned and remembered after watching the instructional video by 160 university students of courses of pedagogical and psychological disciplines. In line with the working hypothesis, the results confirm the existence of a positive correlation between learning and positive emotional involvement. Learning is greatly favored by the ability to read their own and others’ emotions, being emotionally involved in the virtual interpersonal perception and to maintain a good emotional self-control. These results can be taken into account for setting up experiential laboratories to promote - through the development of positive emotional involvement and expressive sensitivity - better levels of learning in the use of materials and subject content offered in the curricula of secondary schools and higher university courses...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: CT {{angiography}} (CTA) {{has been}} used for the evaluation of intracranial aneurysms and recently has been applied to assess postoperative aneurysms treated with titanium-alloy clips. We investigated the clinical usefulness of subtraction CTA by using the orbital synchronized helical scan technique (OSHST) for evaluating intracranial aneurysms surgically treated with cobalt-alloy clips. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We scanned an agar gel phantom with a cobalt-alloy <b>clip</b> <b>mounted</b> in the center by using subtraction CT with and without OSHST. Eighteen patients (20 aneurysms) who underwent surgery with cobalt-alloy clips were postoperatively evaluated with subtraction CTA with OSHST, and the results were compared with those from digital subtraction angiography. Two neuro-radiologists independently evaluated the 3 D CTA images and source images with and without subtraction for the presence of residual flow in the aneurysm and stenotic change in parent or neighboring arteries. RESULTS: For the phantom study, significantly fewer artifacts from clips were noted on images obtained by using subtraction CT with OSHST than on those obtained without OSHST. For the clinical study, subtraction CTA with OSHST also showed fewer clip artifacts than did conventional CTA. Image quality was poor, and we were unable to diagnose residual neck for 5 % (1 / 20) with subtraction CT...|$|R
