The greylag-derived birds are large and fleshy and used for meat, while the Chinese geese have smaller frames and are mainly used for egg production. The fine down of both is valued for use in pillows and padded garments. They forage on grass and weeds, supplementing this with small invertebrates, {{and one of the}} attractions of rearing geese is their ability to grow and thrive on a grass-based system. They are very gregarious and have good memories and can be allowed to roam widely in the knowledge that they will return home by dusk. The Chinese goose is more aggressive and noisy than other geese and {{can be used as a}} guard animal to warn of intruders. The flesh of meat geese is dark-coloured and high in protein, but they deposit fat subcutaneously, although this fat contains mostly <b>monounsaturated</b> fatty acids.

Eggs of the decapod shrimps, Chorismus antarcticus, Nematocarcinus lanceopes and Notocrangon antarcticus {{were taken to}} analysetheir morphometric, lipid and fatty acid composition. Almost all females carried undifferentiated eggs (stage I). The average number of recentlyextruded eggs was lowest in C. antarcticus with 163 eggs, and highest in Nematocarcinus lanceopes with 1, 220 eggs, while Notocrangonantarcticus produced on average 350 eggs. The lipid content (% of dry mass) of the eggs was 18. 8 % for C. antarcticus, 14. 3 % for Notocrangonantarcticus and 18. 1 % for Nematocarcinus lanceopes. Dominant lipid classes in eggs of all species were phospholipids and triacylglycerols. Thestorage lipid, triacylglycerol, was slightly elevated in the eggs of Nematocarcinus lanceopes (mean of 52. 7 %) {{compared to the other}} two species. The fatty acid compositions of the decapod eggs were similar in the three species. Dominant fatty acids were 20 : 5 (n- 3), 18 : 1 (n- 9), 16 : 1 (n- 7), 16 : 0 and 18 : 1 (n- 7), comprising 75. 8 - 78. 4 % of total fatty acids.

40|$|Abstract: The Olive tree (Olea europaea L.), {{a native}} of the Mediterranean basin and parts of Asia, is now widely {{cultivated}} in many {{other parts of the world}} for production of olive oil and table olives. Olive is a rich source of valuable nutrients and bioactives of medicinal and therapeutic interest. Olive fruit contains appreciable concentration, 1 – 3 % of fresh pulp weight, of hydrophilic (phenolic acids, phenolic alchohols, flavonoids and secoiridoids) and lipophilic (cresols) phenolic compounds that are known to possess multiple biological activities such as antioxidant, anticarcinogenic, antiinflammatory, antimicrobial, antihypertensive, antidyslipidemic, cardiotonic, laxative, and antiplatelet. Other important compounds present in olive fruit are pectin, organic acids, and pigments. Virgin olive oil (VOO), extracted mechanically from the fruit, is also very popular for its nutritive and health-promoting potential, especially against cardiovascular disorders due to the presence of high levels of <b>monounsaturates</b> and other valuable minor components such as phenolics, phytosterols, tocopherols, carotenoids, chlorophyll and squalene.

Lipids were extracted from lyophilized cells. Free fatty acids were separated by column chromatography. Methyl esters of the free fatty acids and the fatty acids from the other lipids were characterized by gas-liquid chromatography. The lipid extract was separated into classes using thin-layer chromatography. The results show that this organism possesses a complete fatty acid spectrum ranging from C₁₀ to C₂₀ with the exception of C₁₉. The great majority of the fatty acids present are straight-chain saturates or straight-chain <b>monounsaturates.</b> The lipids include large amounts of free fatty acids and phospholipids...|$|R

40|$|The {{fatty acid}} {{composition}} of membrane lipids varies systematically among species {{in a manner}} that is consistent with their metabolic rate and longevity. Because the susceptibility of fatty acids to peroxidation relates directly to their extent of unsaturation, it is possible to calculate a peroxidation index (PI) for membranes through characterization of their specific fatty acid composition. Long-living mammals and birds have membrane lipids with a lower PI than shorter-living species. Bird and mammal species with the same maximum life span also have membrane lipids with essentially the same PI. Exceptionally long-living mammals and birds usually have membrane lipids high in <b>monounsaturates,</b> but low in polyunsaturates, with the consequence that the PI of their membrane lipids is as low as expected for their respective longevity. Longevity variation within species (whether due to calorie-restriction, extended longevity associated with specific strains, queen-worker differences in honey bees or inherited longevity differences among humans) is also associated with differences in membrane composition and PI. Membrane composition is specific for each species and PI appears to generally be resistant to dietary manipulation.

DESIGN: Multicentre, prospective cohort study. SETTING: Nine European countries (Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, United Kingdom). PARTICIPANTS: 74, 607 men and women, aged 60 or more, without coronary heart disease, stroke, or cancer at enrolment and with complete information about dietary intake and potentially confounding variables. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Extent of adherence to a modified Mediterranean diet using a scoring system on a 10 point scale, and death from any cause by time of occurrence, modelled through Cox regression. RESULTS: An increase in the modified Mediterranean diet score was associated with lower overall mortality, a two unit increment corresponding to a statistically significant reduction of 8 % (95 % confidence interval 3 % to 12 %). No statistically significant evidence of heterogeneity was found among countries in the association of the score with overall mortality even though the association was stronger in Greece and Spain.

However, actual evidence has shown that Inuit have a similar prevalence of coronary artery disease as non-Inuit populations and they have excessive mortality due to cerebrovascular strokes, with twice the risk to that of the North American population. Indeed, the cardiovascular risk of this diet is so severe that the addition of a more standard American diet has reduced the incidence of mortality in Inuit population.

Structural trends elucidated from both methods that improved oxidative stability included decreasing the number of double bonds, introduction of trans as opposed to cis unsaturation, location of unsaturation closer to the ester head group, and elimination of hydroxyl groups. Also noticed with EN 14112 was an improvement in oxidative stability when a larger ester head group was uti-lized. Methyl esters that contained ten or less carbons in the fatty acid backbone were unacceptable for analysis at 110 C (EN 14112) due to excessive sample evaporation.

40|$|An {{enhanced}} metabolic efficiency for {{accelerating the}} recovery of fat mass (or catch-up fat) is a characteristic feature of body weight regulation after weight loss or growth retardation and is the outcome of an "adipose-specific" suppression of thermogenesis, i. e., a feedback control system in which signals from the depleted adipose tissue fat stores exert a suppressive effect on thermogenesis. Using a previously described rat model of semistarvation-refeeding in which catch-up fat results from suppressed thermogenesis per se, we report here that the gene expression of stearoyl-coenzyme A desaturase 1 (SCD 1) is elevated in skeletal muscle after 2 wk of semistarvation and remains elevated in parallel to the phase of suppressed thermogenesis favoring catch-up fat during refeeding. These elevations in the SCD 1 transcript are skeletal muscle specific and are associated with elevations in microsomal Δ 9 desaturase enzyme activity, in the Δ 9 desaturation index, and in the relative content of SCD 1 -derived <b>monounsaturates</b> in several lipid fractions extracted from skeletal muscle.
