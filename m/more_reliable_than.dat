5|$|Turbines {{offered more}} power than {{reciprocating}} engines for the same volume of machinery. This, along with a guarantee on the new machinery from the inventor, Charles Parsons, persuaded the Royal Navy to use turbines in Dreadnought. It is often said that turbines had the additional benefits of being cleaner and <b>more</b> <b>reliable</b> <b>than</b> reciprocating engines. By 1905, new designs of reciprocating engine were available which were cleaner and <b>more</b> <b>reliable</b> <b>than</b> previous models.|$|E
5|$|The newer M5000 trams {{proved to}} be {{considerably}} <b>more</b> <b>reliable</b> <b>than</b> the T-68/A fleet; which averaged 5,000 miles between breakdowns, while the M5000's averaged 20,000 miles. This led to a decision in 2012 to withdraw the entire fleet from service {{and replace them with}} M5000's. All of the T-68 and T-68As were withdrawn between April 2012 and April 2014.|$|E

5|$|Although in {{operational}} theatres {{such as the}} Gulf War the Jaguar {{proved to}} be mechanically <b>more</b> <b>reliable</b> <b>than</b> the Panavia Tornado, the aircraft's avionics were a hindrance to conducting missions. Owing to the Jaguar A's shortcomings in navigation and target acquisition, French Jaguars had to be escorted by Dassault Mirage F1CR reconnaissance aircraft to act as guides. The Jaguar provided a valuable component of the campaign, the RAF detachment of 12 Jaguars flew 612 combat sorties, with no aircraft lost.|$|E
5|$|Buckingham and Wotton were <b>more</b> <b>reliable</b> <b>than</b> the Aveling and Porter engines. With modern {{locomotives}} on the Brill–Quainton Road route (the Kingswood branch generally remained {{worked by}} horses, and occasionally by the Aveling and Porter engines), traffic rose. The figure for milk traffic rose from 40,000gallons carried in 1875 to 58,000gallons (260,000l; 70,000USgal) in 1879, and in 1877 the Tramway carried 20,994tons (21,331t) of goods. In early 1877 it appeared on Bradshaw maps and from May 1882 Bradshaw listed the timetable.|$|E

These are <b>more</b> <b>reliable</b> <b>than</b> A-clamps because the O-ring is well protected, but many countries do not use DIN fittings widely on compressors, or cylinders which have DIN fittings, so a diver traveling abroad with a DIN system may need to take an adaptor, either for connecting the DIN regulator to a rented cylinder, or for connecting an A-clamp filler hose to a DIN cylinder valve.|$|E
5|$|In December 2006 and January 2007, {{during the}} off-season, both zero-G rolls {{were removed from}} the ride. The rolls were a problem due to {{concerns}} of occasional stalling caused by a failure of the tower's LIMs. The rolls were replaced by a slightly banked inclined S-curve. Batman's train had its shells painted red so Robin could be ready to open first before Batman. This was done because Robin was <b>more</b> <b>reliable</b> <b>than</b> Batman and the track replacement for Robin was completed first on March 13. It re-opened on April 7. Batman's track was replaced between April 16 and April 20, while the park was closed. However, Batman never re-opened.|$|E
5|$|López de Zúñiga, {{known as}} Stunica, {{one of the}} editors of Ximenes Complutensian Polyglot, reproached Erasmus that his text lacked part of the 1 John 5:7-8 (Comma Johanneum). Erasmus replied {{that he had not}} found it in any Greek manuscript. Stunica {{answered}} that Latin manuscripts are <b>more</b> <b>reliable</b> <b>than</b> Greek. In 1520 Edward Lee accused Erasmus of encouraging Arianism. Erasmus replied that he had not found any Greek manuscript that contained these words, he answered that this was a case not of omission, but simply of non-addition. He showed that even some Latin manuscripts did not contain these words.|$|E

Its quieter and cooler design was praised {{for making the}} console <b>more</b> <b>reliable</b> <b>than</b> its predecessor on-launch, but the console was generally criticized for running games at a technically lower graphical level than the PlayStation 4. Its original user interface was panned for being nonintuitive, although changes made to it {{and other aspects of}} the console's software post-launch received positive reception. Its Kinect received praise for its improved motion-tracking accuracy, its face recognition logins, and its voice commands.|$|E
5|$|Following a {{demonstration}} at Remington's offices in New York, the company contracted on March1, 1873, to manufacture 1,000machines, with {{the option to}} produce an additional 24,000. Although the agreement required Densmore to give Remington $10,000 and royalty rights, a marketing firm to be formed by Densmore and Yost was allowed {{to serve as the}} exclusive sales agent. Remington dedicated a wing of its factory to the typewriter, and spent several months retooling and re-engineering the device; production began in September and the machine entered the market on July1, 1874. Typewriter production was largely overseen by Jefferson Clough and William K. Jenne, manager of Remington's sewing machine division. The redesigned machine was sturdier and <b>more</b> <b>reliable</b> <b>than</b> Sholes' model, but it had taken on some of the characteristics of a sewing machine, including a japanned case with floral ornamentation and a stand with a treadle to operate the carriage return. The typewriter, however, had been rushed into production with insufficient testing, and early models were soon returned for adjustments and repair.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{two of the}} lithographic copies made in Egypt {{had reached}} the Institut de France in Paris in 1801. There, {{librarian}} and antiquarian Gabriel de La Porte du Theil set {{to work on a}} translation of the Greek, but he was dispatched elsewhere on Napoleon's orders almost immediately, and he left his unfinished work in the hands of colleague Hubert-Pascal Ameilhon. Ameilhon produced the first published translations of the Greek text in 1803, in both Latin and French to ensure that they would circulate widely. At Cambridge, Richard Porson worked on the missing lower right corner of the Greek text. He produced a skilful suggested reconstruction, which was soon being circulated by the Society of Antiquaries alongside its prints of the inscription. At almost the same moment, Christian Gottlob Heyne in Göttingen was making a new Latin translation of the Greek text that was <b>more</b> <b>reliable</b> <b>than</b> Ameilhon's, which was first published in 1803. It was reprinted by the Society of Antiquaries in a special issue of its journal Archaeologia in 1811, alongside Weston's previously unpublished English translation, Colonel Turner's narrative, and other documents.|$|E

5|$|Spotted hyena {{societies}} {{are more complex}} than those of other carnivorous mammals, and are remarkably {{similar to those of}} cercopithecine primates in respect to group size, structure, competition and cooperation. Like cercopithecine primates, spotted hyenas use multiple sensory modalities, recognise individual conspecifics, are conscious that some clan-mates may be <b>more</b> <b>reliable</b> <b>than</b> others, recognise third-party kin and rank relationships among clan-mates, and adaptively use this knowledge during social decision making. Also, like cercopithecine primates, dominance ranks in hyena {{societies are}} not correlated with size or aggression, but with ally networks. In this latter trait, the spotted hyena further show parallels with primates by acquiring rank through coalition. However, rank reversals and overthrows in spotted hyena clans are very rare. The social network dynamics of spotted hyenas are determined by multiple factors. Environmental factors include rainfall and prey abundance; individual factors include preference to bond with females and with kin; and topological effects include the tendency to close triads in the network. Female hyenas are more flexible than males in their social bonding preferences.|$|E
