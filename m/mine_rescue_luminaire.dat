40|$|Miners trapped {{underground}} {{at great}} depths can require long-lasting rescue missions of unknown dimensions. However, common tasks for today’s <b>mine</b> <b>rescue</b> teams mainly cover short-term fire-related incidents and first aid. Since European mining {{is going to}} greater depths than before, <b>mine</b> <b>rescue</b> needs innovative approaches for future challenges that will arise. Thus, this thesis develops a <b>Mine</b> <b>Rescue</b> Management (MRM) concept to increase preparedness for an efficient response to long-lasting entrapments. An analysis of current European <b>mine</b> <b>rescue</b> {{as well as a}} risk assessment regarding possible entrapment scenarios in modern mining operations give the scope of this thesis. A database of 56 major <b>mine</b> <b>rescue</b> missions has been compiled and a quantitative analysis proves the relevance of research. In the main part of this thesis, six single case studies are prepared with qualitative methods followed by a multiple case study analysis. Systematic lessons learned provide a first input for the MRM concept. Identified gaps and weaknesses in <b>mine</b> <b>rescue</b> are then met by a transfer of approved disaster management principles. Together, the two pillars – the case study results as well as the adapted disaster management principles – allow a definition of MRM. This management concept gives comprehensive instructions regarding planning, response, and learning. The tripartite MRM concept has the potential to improve the preparedness of today’s <b>mine</b> <b>rescue</b> for a complex mission to rescue miners trapped underground...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: The aim of {{the study}} was to assess health status of regular and {{part-time}} <b>mines</b> <b>rescue</b> brigadesmen. Material and Methods: A group of 685 <b>mines</b> <b>rescue</b> brigadesmen was examined within the preventive testing – a basic internal, biochemistry and anthropometric examination, physical fitness testing. Results: The average age of the subjects was 41. 96 ± 7. 18 years, the average exposure in mining was 20 ± 8. 1 years, out of that 11. 95 ± 7. 85 years as <b>mines</b> <b>rescue</b> brigadesmen. Elevated levels of total serum cholesterol (T-CH) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-CH) were found in over 1 / 2 of the subjects. Systolic hypertension (systolic blood pressure (SBP) ≥ 140 mm Hg) was confirmed in 34 %, overweight (body mass index (BMI) ≥ 25) in 62. 3 % and obesity (BMI ≥ 30) in 20. 4 % of the examined <b>mines</b> <b>rescue</b> brigadesmen. The metabolic syndrome was found in 15. 2 % of persons. The highest physical fitness was found in <b>mines</b> <b>rescue</b> brigadesmen and the lowest in mine officers. Limit values of maximum oxygen uptake (VO 2 max/kg) determined by the management of the <b>mine</b> <b>rescue</b> station were not reached by every 3 rd of all <b>mines</b> <b>rescue</b> brigadesmen. Compared with the control group of the Czech and Slovak population, the rescuers are taller, have greater BMI, higher percentage of body fat in all age categories and proportionally to that they achieve a higher maximum minute oxygen uptake; however, in relative values per kg of body weight their physical fitness is practically the same as that of the controls. Conclusions: The prevalence of risk factors of cardiovascular diseases and VO 2 max/kg in the group of the <b>mines</b> <b>rescue</b> brigadesmen is comparable with that in the general untrained Czech population...|$|R

Some of its duties were taken over by the newly created mining authorities (Montanbehörden). In addition the big <b>mine</b> <b>rescue</b> departments of the nationalized enterprises, which for decades had served nearby small businesses, but had gradually disappeared, were reformed.
