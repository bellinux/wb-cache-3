5000|$|Twist-on wire {{connectors}} {{are available in}} a variety of sizes and shapes. While their exterior covering is typically made from insulating plastic, their means of connection is a tapered coiled <b>metal</b> <b>insert,</b> which threads onto the wires and holds them securely. When such a connector is twisted onto the stripped and twisted-together ends of wires, the wires are drawn into the connector's <b>metal</b> <b>insert</b> and squeezed together inside it. Electrical continuity is maintained by both the direct twisted wire-to-wire contact and by contact with the <b>metal</b> <b>insert.</b>|$|E

30|$|After {{raising a}} mucoperiostal flap, the dental {{implants}} were placed using the virtual developed tooth-supported drilling templates using <b>metal</b> <b>inserts</b> (Fig.  5 c). It was checked whether no dehiscences of the implant surface were present.|$|R
40|$|Corrosion of <b>metal</b> <b>inserts</b> may be {{detrimental}} to the durability of masonry. The paper discusses corrosion of carbon steel, stainless steel and titanium embedded in aerial and hydraulic mortars simulating those of ancient walls. The effects of temperature (5 - 40 °C), moisture (65 - 95 % RH and water suction) and electrical resistivity of mortars on the corrosion of <b>metal</b> <b>inserts</b> are discussed. Results showed that the corrosion rate of embedded steel, regardless of the mortar composition, is negligible in mortars exposed to 65 - 80 % RH (even at 40 °C) and modest even at 95 % RH, while high values were obtained {{in the presence of}} water uptake...|$|R
50|$|As daisy wheel {{elements}} {{are made of}} plastic to keep mass and manufacturing costs low, using the period character for graphics would cause unacceptably rapid wear, so plastic {{elements are}} offered with a <b>metal</b> <b>insert</b> in this position that lasts much longer.|$|E
5000|$|These buttons were {{produced}} with a concave opening {{on the back}} side (which provided space to insert advertising), or with a closed back, filled with <b>metal</b> <b>insert</b> and fastener. These are called [...] "open back" [...] and [...] "closed back" [...] buttons.|$|E

Since sensor {{does not directly}} contact fluid, {{it does not have}} to be sterilized. It is compatible with disposable bottles, tubes, and hypodermic needles widely used in hospitals. Only modification necessary is in tube, which must contain two small <b>metal</b> <b>inserts,</b> spaced to fit in curved thermistor plates...|$|R
5000|$|Chenille letters come in many {{different}} forms and shapes. Some institutions use Old English or script style, two or three letter monogram, 3D shading, chenille bordered or the traditional straight block style. Students generally receive only one actual letter, but can win the distinction multiple times. These additional designations are shown by adding embroidered sport insignias, modeled <b>metal</b> <b>insert</b> pins, or bars that {{are attached to the}} letter. Some schools may embroider non-athletic letters with their award title, such as [...] "Academics" [...] or [...] "Arts”.|$|E
50|$|Magazines - The {{magazine}} well {{is extended}} {{to accommodate the}} 45 WinMag cartridge, and the magazines are similarly deeper front to back. Magazines for 10mm and 45ACP contain a sheet <b>metal</b> <b>insert</b> that reduces the effective cartridge length capacity of the magazine. Magazines intended to chamber the 10mm round have modified feed lips and longitudinal grooves reducing {{the width of the}} feed channel. The overall magazine dimensions are identical to the standard 45WM magazine. LAR Grizzly pistols modified to accept standard 10mm magazines exist, but this was not a factory modification.|$|E
50|$|A 45 rpm adapter (also 45 rpm record insert, 45 rpm spindle adapter, or 7 inch adapter, {{the common}} size of 45 RPM records) {{is a small}} plastic or <b>metal</b> <b>insert</b> that goes {{in the middle of}} a 45-rpm record so it can be played on the LP or 78 rpm size spindle of a turntable. The adapter could be a small solid circle that fits onto the bottom of the spindle (meaning only one 45 could be played at a time) or a larger adapter that fits over the entire spindle, {{permitting}} a stack of 45s to be played.|$|E
50|$|The main {{problems}} of using Fiber reinforced plastic for gear housings are low thermal conductivity and low hardness of the composite material. Because {{of the low}} hardness, the composite gear housing requires numerous <b>metal</b> <b>inserts</b> laminated into the composite exterior or installed with adhesive in the prefabricated composite housing. High strength epoxy adhesives are used in fabrication of carbon fiber composite drive shafts for cars.|$|R
50|$|In April 2015 the Fraunhofer {{group in}} {{collaboration}} with the high performance polymer division of Sumitomo Bakelite Co announced their development of a single cylinder research engine with a casing made of injection moulded glass fibre reinforced phenolic resin (55/45 respective composition). The engine weighs about 20% less than an equivalent of aluminium. Their design uses <b>metal</b> <b>inserts</b> in places of high thermal and mechanical stress, for example in the cylinder liner.|$|R
50|$|One {{specific}} type of plastic stone is called the Ing stone, manufactured by the Ing Chang-ki Wei-chi Education Foundation. These are the official stones of the Ing Foundation and have some extra weight to them due to <b>metal</b> <b>inserted</b> {{in the middle of}} the stone. They are 10 mm thick and sometimes come in an Ing Bowl, which is specially designed to count them (Ing rules require each player to start with exactly 180 stones).|$|R
5000|$|Finline {{is similar}} to ridge {{waveguide}} in that the metallisation of the substrate represents the ridge (the [...] "fin") and the finline represents the gap. Filters can be constructed in ridge waveguide by varying {{the height of the}} ridge in a pattern. A common way of manufacturing these is to take a thin sheet of metal with pieces cut out (typically, a series of rectangular holes) and insert this in the waveguide {{in much the same way}} as finline. However, a finline filter is able to implement patterns of arbitrary complexity whereas the <b>metal</b> <b>insert</b> filter is limited by the need for mechanical support and integrity.|$|E
5000|$|Only minor {{appearance}} changes {{highlighted the}} 1976 Camaro, most notably a brushed <b>metal</b> <b>insert</b> {{in the rear}} tail section on the LT model. The 250 cubic-inch six-cylinder remained the standard engine in the sport coupe and a new 140-horsepower 305 cubic-inch V8 became the standard engine in the LT and base V8 option in the sport coupe. The larger 350 cubic-inch V8 was now only available with a four-barrel carburetor and [...] Power brakes became standard on V8 models this year. The Camaro's popularity was soaring. Sales totals jumped significantly for 1976, the best year yet for the second generation, and were to improve even more dramatically as the decade progressed.|$|E

40|$|The {{hydrostatic}} tank system, {{using the}} concept of uniform pressure distribution at the stump/socket interface was used to produce sockets which were compared with standard Patellar Tendon Bearing (PTB) sockets. Sockets containing machined <b>metal</b> <b>inserts</b> were manufactured using standard laminating techniques. Patellar tendon (PT) transducer, Entran-based device, Normal/shear stress transducer and Electrohydraulic sensors were {{used to measure the}} stump/socket interface stresses. The results show that the interface pressure distribution of the hydrocast socket was more uniform compared to that of the PTB socket...|$|R
5000|$|In a later {{collaboration}} between Stella and Tyler, The Fountain ‘mural’ print (1992) exemplifies Tyler’s ability to offer mixed media prints {{on a grand}} scale. The Fountain measures over 2 metres x by 7 metres, and three woodblocks and 105 intaglio plates were employed to produce the sixty-seven coloured print Stella required in his original collage composition. Tyler once commented, [...] "My choice of wood-block was made based on the large size of the print. Both Frank and I {{knew we were going}} to use some of the existing metal plates from the Moby Dick prints series. It was determined that the black image would be printed from the woodblock and the colors would be from <b>metal</b> <b>insert</b> plates". [...] Very large triple ply washi (Kozo fibre) papers were created especially for this ambitious project, as was a custom-built printing press.|$|E
5000|$|Threaded inserts are {{commonly}} used in plastic casings, housing, and parts to create a metal thread (typically: Brass or Stainless Steel) to allow for screws {{to be used in}} the assembly of many consumer electronics and consumer products. These may be cast in place in injection molded parts or they may be added by thermal insertion. In the latter, the insert is heated and then pressed into a hollow in the plastic part. The heat causes local melting in the plastic. [...] Ultrasonic Insertion is the process used to apply vibration and pressure to install the threaded insert into a molded hollow boss (hole) of a plastic part. The ultrasonic vibrations melt the plastic where the <b>metal</b> <b>insert</b> is in contact, and pressure is applied to press it into position. The plastic material typically reforms around the knurled body of the threaded insert to ensure a good retention.|$|E
5000|$|The knobs {{fitted to}} {{cylinder}} valves and manifolds {{should be able}} to withstand a moderate impact without fracturing or bending the spindle and jamming. The approved valve knob is hard rubber or non-brittle plastic, which flexes to absorb much of the impact energy, with a <b>metal</b> <b>insert,</b> so the connection to the spindle is less likely to strip. Spring loading of the valve knob can also absorb impact loads, but only from some directions. Hard plastic and metal knobs are not approved. Hard plastic knobs may be brittle and break under impact, and metal knobs are more likely to transfer the full impact to the spindle, thus a greater risk of bending or shearing the spindle and rendering the valve inoperable. If the valve is rolled off (closed by friction against the environment) at the same time, the gas supply is isolated and unavailable to the diver. [...] Almost all knobs are currently (2017) made of hard rubber or non-brittle plastic.|$|E

50|$|Coignet {{was the son}} of {{industrialist}} François Coignet (1814-1888) {{and educated}} at the École Centrale des Arts et Manufactures (École Centrale Paris). He was the inventor of the agglomerated concrete to strengthen the cement with <b>metal</b> <b>inserts.</b> He permanently reoriented the family business to construction. In 1892 he applied his innovative construction methods on the aqueduct of Achères in Paris. Coignet was the first to use reinforced concrete piles and built with the architect Jacques Hermant some of the first Parisian buildings in this material.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a modular packaging system for logistics {{that can be}} reconfigured into internal outfitting for a lunar outpost, including desks, chairs, partitions, cabinets, and radiation shielding. Logistics include clothes, equipment, food, and other consumables needed to sustain the crew {{for the duration of}} the mission. A significant mass penalty is required for the packaging and handling of logistics for re-supply of short to long-term space missions that must be brought out of the gravity well on a launch vehicle. Once the supplies have been exhausted, the packaging material is typically of no further use and is discarded. If a scheme can be developed that reuses the logistics packaging, the mass penalty can be reduced. In this research, a modular packaging system has been devised as a kit-of-parts that can be used for both handling logistics supplies, and then reconfigured into desks, chairs, partitions, cabinets, and radiation shielding. The system is derived from a standard International Space Station (ISS) -type Cargo Transfer Bag (CTB), using soft, unfoldable box-like containers with stiff <b>metal</b> <b>inserts.</b> The empty hydrogen-impregnated CTBs can be used as-is for cabinets, opened up for use as partitions, or draped over the habitat as layers of radiation shielding. Stiff <b>metal</b> <b>inserts</b> can be reconfigured into desks and other useful outfitting...|$|R
