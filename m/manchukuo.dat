5|$|In late 1933-early 1934, a major strain {{was placed}} on German-Japanese {{relations}} when the German ambassador to Japan, when Ambassador Herbert von Dirksen appointed Ferdinand Heye, a Nazi Party member and a disreputable German businessman convicted by a Chinese court of opium smuggling in 1927 the Special German Trade Commissioner for <b>Manchukuo.</b> The Japanese attached much importance {{to the question of}} recognizing <b>Manchukuo,</b> which was seen as a litmus test for whatever one was a true friend of Japan or of China. Heye attempted with the support of Dirksen to have the Japanese give him a monopoly of exporting soybeans from <b>Manchukuo,</b> in exchange for which he promised to have Germany recognize <b>Manchukuo.</b> The ambitious Heye, having won the friendship of the Kwantung Army by promising that he would have the Reich recognize <b>Manchukuo,</b> then attempted to use his position as German Trade Commissioner to <b>Manchukuo</b> to secure a monopoly on all German investments in <b>Manchukuo.</b> The attempts of Heye and Dirksen to have Germany recognize <b>Manchukuo</b> involved them in a dispute with Neurath who preferred to keep Germany's special relationship it had established with the Kuomintang regime in China going, and who knew well that the Chinese would be extremely offended if Germany recognized <b>Manchukuo.</b> The Heye affair caused much bad feelings on both sides, and was ended in February 1935 with the victory of Neurath when Hitler disallowed Heye and his promises he made.|$|E
5|$|Asia Express-high-speed train started {{operation}} in 1933 in <b>Manchukuo.</b>|$|E
5|$|At its peak, {{the camp}} held 8,000American {{soldiers}} (along {{with a small}} number of soldiers and civilians from other nations including the United Kingdom, Norway, and the Netherlands), making it the largest POW camp in the Philippines. This number dropped significantly as able-bodied soldiers were shipped to other areas in the Philippines, Japan, Japanese-occupied Taiwan, and <b>Manchukuo</b> to work in slave labor camps. As Japan had not yet ratified the Geneva Convention, the POWs were transported out of the camp and forced to work in factories to build Japanese weaponry, unload ships, and repair airfields.|$|E
5|$|The Kuomintang (KMT) {{party in}} China {{launched}} a unification campaign against regional warlords and nominally unified China in the mid-1920s, but was soon {{embroiled in a}} civil war against its former Chinese Communist Party allies and new regional warlords. In 1931, an increasingly militaristic Empire of Japan, which had long sought influence in China as the first step of what its government saw as the country's right to rule Asia, used the Mukden Incident as a pretext to launch an invasion of Manchuria and establish the puppet state of <b>Manchukuo.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{flag was}} {{a tool of}} Japanese imperialism in the {{occupied}} Southeast Asian areas during Second World War: people {{had to use the}} flag, and schoolchildren sang Kimigayo in morning flag raising ceremonies. Local flags were allowed for some areas such as the Philippines, Indonesia, and <b>Manchukuo.</b> In Korea which was part of the Empire of Japan, the Hinomaru and other symbols were used to declare that the Koreans were subjects of the empire.|$|E
5|$|In February 1938, on {{the advice}} of his newly {{appointed}} foreign minister, the strongly pro-Japanese Joachim von Ribbentrop, Hitler ended the Sino-German alliance with the Republic of China to instead enter into an alliance with the more modern and powerful Empire of Japan. Hitler announced German recognition of <b>Manchukuo,</b> the Japanese-occupied state in Manchuria, and renounced German claims to their former colonies in the Pacific held by Japan. Hitler ordered an end to arms shipments to China and recalled all German officers working with the Chinese Army. In retaliation, Chinese General Chiang Kai-shek cancelled all Sino-German economic agreements, depriving the Germans of many Chinese raw materials.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-to-late 1930s, Japanese {{forces in}} <b>Manchukuo</b> had {{sporadic}} border clashes with the Soviet Union and the Mongolian People's Republic. The Japanese doctrine of Hokushin-ron, which emphasised Japan's expansion northward, was favoured by the Imperial Army during this time. With the Japanese defeat at Khalkin Gol in 1939, the ongoing Second Sino-Japanese War and ally Nazi Germany pursuing neutrality with the Soviets, this policy would prove difficult to maintain. Japan and the Soviet Union eventually signed a Neutrality Pact in April 1941, and Japan adopted {{the doctrine of}} Nanshin-ron, promoted by the Navy, which took its focus southward, eventually leading to its war with the United States and the Western Allies.|$|E
5|$|To this end, Stalin and Molotov {{strung out}} the {{negotiations}} with the Japanese, giving them false hope of a Soviet-mediated peace. At the same time, in their dealings with the United States and Britain, the Soviets insisted on strict adherence to the Cairo Declaration, re-affirmed at the Yalta Conference, that the Allies would not accept separate or conditional peace with Japan. The Japanese would have to surrender unconditionally to all the Allies. To prolong the war, the Soviets opposed any attempt to weaken this requirement. This would give the Soviets time to complete the transfer of their troops from the Western Front to the Far East, and conquer Manchuria (<b>Manchukuo),</b> Inner Mongolia (Mengjiang), Korea, South Sakhalin, the Kuriles, and possibly, Hokkaidō (starting with a landing at Rumoi).|$|E
5|$|Despite {{tentative}} {{plans for}} a joint German-Japanese approach against the USSR were hinted on in the 1936 Anti-Comintern Pact, the years 1938 and 1939 were already decisive for Japan's decision to not expand northward (i.e., against the USSR) but to the south. The Empire decisively lost two border fights against the Soviets, the Battles of Lake Khasan and Khalkin Gol, thereby convincing itself that the Imperial Japanese Army, lacking heavy tanks and the like, would be {{in no position to}} challenge the Red Army at that time. Nevertheless, Hitler's anti-Soviet sentiment soon led to further rapprochements with Japan, since he still believed that Japan would join Germany in a future war against the Soviet Union, either actively by invading southeast Siberia, or passively by binding large parts of the Red Army, which was fearing an attack of Japan's Kwantung Army in <b>Manchukuo,</b> numbering ca. 700,000 men as of the late 1930s.|$|E
5|$|In September 1931, Japanese army units {{invaded the}} Chinese {{province}} of Manchuria, transforming {{it into the}} puppet state of <b>Manchukuo.</b> In December 1932, Hiei was reassigned to the Imperial Japanese Navy's training squadron. On 25 February, the League of Nations ruled that Japan had violated Chinese sovereignty and international law in her invasion of Manchuria. Refusing to accept the League's judgment, the Empire of Japan withdrew from the League the same day. This also signaled its exit from the Washington and London Naval Treaties, which removed all restrictions on the Imperial Japanese Navy's construction of capital ships. From the end of May 1933 to 13 August, Hiei received upgrades that allowed her to perform regular duties for the Emperor, and she served as the Emperor's observation ship for the Imperial Naval Review three days later. From January to March 1934, her No. 4 turret and ammunition magazine were refitted. In November 1935, Hiei served as the Emperor's ship for his official visit to the Kagoshima and Miyazaki Prefectures.|$|E
5|$|Now {{that he was}} a reservist, Matsui {{had more}} time to pursue his pan-Asian project. Between October and December 1935 he toured the major cities of China and <b>Manchukuo</b> {{speaking}} to Chinese politicians and businessmen about pan-Asianism and setting up a new branch of the Greater Asia Association in Tianjin. Upon his return to Japan in December 1935 he became President of the Greater Asia Association. In February and March 1936, amid ongoing tension with China, Matsui made a second trip to China, this time on a government-sponsored goodwill tour. Matsui met personally with Chiang, and though he found little common ground with him, they at least were united in their anti-communism. Matsui came out of the meeting believing that joint anti-communism could be the basis for Sino-Japanese cooperation in the future. Then in December 1936, following the Xi'an Incident, Chiang agreed to join with the Communist Party of China to resist Japan, a move that Matsui viewed as a personal betrayal.|$|E
5|$|During this period, Ueshiba {{was invited}} to teach {{at a number of}} {{military}} institutes, due to his close personal relationships with key figures in the military (among them Sadao Araki, the Japanese Minister of War). He accepted an invitation from Admiral Sankichi Takahashi to be the martial arts instructor at the Imperial Japanese Naval Academy, and also taught at the Nakano Spy School, although aikido was later judged to be too technical for the students there and karate was adopted instead. He also became a visiting instructor at the Imperial Japanese Army Academy after being challenged by (and defeating) General Makoto Miura, another student of Takeda Sōkaku's Daitō-ryū. Takeda himself met Ueshiba for the last time around 1935, while Ueshiba was teaching at the Osaka headquarters of the Asahi Shimbun newspaper. Frustrated by the appearance of his teacher, who was openly critical of Ueshiba's martial arts and who appeared intent on taking over the classes there, Ueshiba left Osaka during the night, bowing to the residence in which Takeda was staying and thereafter avoiding all contact with him. Between 1940 and 1942 he made several visits to <b>Manchukuo</b> (Japanese occupied Manchuria) where he was the principal martial arts instructor at Kenkoku University. Whilst in Manchuria, he met and defeated the sumo wrestler Tenryū Saburō during a demonstration.|$|E
5|$|The {{division}} began re-forming from a {{cadre of}} rifle brigades on 22 November 1944 {{as part of the}} Far Eastern Front, commanded by Colonel Ivan Teplyakov. The division fought in the Sungari Offensive, part of the Soviet invasion of Manchuria, which began on 9 August following the Soviet declaration of war on Japan after the American Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The division advanced as part of the 5th Separate Rifle Corps (an independent unit reporting directly to the front command) on the left of the 15th Army, with the objective of taking the towns of Raohe, Baoqing, and Boli in eastern <b>Manchukuo,</b> a Japanese puppet state in Manchuria in northeast China. Attacking alongside the 172nd Tank Brigade, the division crossed the Amur River and captured Raohe and its fortified area from troops of the Japanese 135th Infantry Division on 10 August. The division and its parent corps then advanced southwest towards Baoqing, which was taken by the 172nd Brigade on 14 August. On 19 August, the corps linked up with troops of the 35th Army at Boli. After reaching Boli the corps' role in the fighting was effectively over, as Japanese resistance in Manchuria collapsed. The division was disbanded in late 1945 along with its corps in the Far Eastern Military District.|$|E
25|$|<b>Manchukuo</b> {{also had}} a {{national}} football team, and football was considered the country's de facto national sport; the Football Association of <b>Manchukuo</b> was formed around it.|$|E
25|$|<b>Manchukuo</b> was {{to compete}} in the 1932 Summer Olympic Games, but one of the athletes who {{intended}} to represent <b>Manchukuo,</b> Liu Changchun, refused to join the team and instead joined as the first Chinese representative in the Olympics. There were attempts by Japanese authorities to let <b>Manchukuo</b> join the 1936 games, but the Olympic Committee persisted in the policy of not allowing an unrecognized state to join the Olympics. <b>Manchukuo</b> had a chance to participate in the planned 1940 Helsinki Olympics, but the onset of World War II prevented the games from taking place.|$|E
25|$|<b>Manchukuo</b> issued {{postage stamps}} from 28 July 1932 until its {{dissolution}} following {{the surrender of}} the Empire of Japan in August 1945. The last issue of <b>Manchukuo</b> was on 2 May 1945.|$|E
25|$|Manchus {{formed a}} {{minority}} in <b>Manchukuo,</b> whose largest ethnic group were Han Chinese. The population of Koreans increased during the <b>Manchukuo</b> period, and there were also Japanese, Mongols, White Russians and other minorities. The Mongol regions of western <b>Manchukuo</b> were ruled under a slightly different system in acknowledgement of the Mongolian traditions there. The {{southern part of the}} Liaodong Peninsula was ruled by Japan as the Kwantung Leased Territory.|$|E
25|$|In this manner, Japan {{formally}} detached <b>Manchukuo</b> from China in {{the course}} of the 1930s. With Japanese investment and rich natural resources, the area became an industrial powerhouse. <b>Manchukuo</b> had its own issued banknotes and postage stamps. Several independent banks were founded as well.|$|E
25|$|Haruki Murakami's 1995 novel The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle deals greatly with <b>Manchukuo</b> {{through the}} {{character}} of Lieutenant Mamiya. Mamiya recalls, in person and in correspondence, his time as {{an officer in the}} Kwantung Army in <b>Manchukuo.</b> While the period covered in these recollections extends over many years, {{the focus is on the}} final year of the war and the Soviet invasion of Manchuria. Also, in his 2011 magical realist novel 1Q84, Murakami references the <b>Manchukuo</b> puppet state, Manchuria and the Trans-Siberian Railway in various character backstories.|$|E
25|$|The early <b>Manchukuo</b> Imperial Army {{organization}} is listed below. Unit troop strengths are in parenthesis. The total {{strength of the}} <b>Manchukuo</b> Imperial Army at its foundation was 111,044 men, {{as many of the}} former Nationalist troops that had surrendered were deemed to be too unreliable by the Japanese were demobilized.|$|E
25|$|In 1908, {{the number}} of {{residents}} was 15,834,000, which rose to 30,000,000 in 1931 and 43,000,000 for the <b>Manchukuo</b> state. The population balance remained 123 men to 100 women and the total number in 1941 was 50,000,000. Other statistics indicate that in <b>Manchukuo</b> the population rose by 18,000,000.|$|E
25|$|With {{the conquest}} and {{establishment}} of the puppet state <b>Manchukuo,</b> massive funds and efforts were invested into the master plan of {{the capital city of}} Hsinking. Many of buildings built during the colonial era still stand today, including those of the Eight Major Bureaus of <b>Manchukuo,</b> the Imperial Palace, the headquarters of the Kwantung Army and Datong Avenue.|$|E
25|$|After Puyi became Emperor of <b>Manchukuo,</b> Kawashima {{continued}} to play various roles and, for a time, was the mistress of Tada Hayao, the chief military advisor to Puyi. She formed an independent counter insurgency cavalry force in 1932 made up of 3,000-5,000 former bandits to hunt down anti-Japanese guerilla bands during the Pacification of <b>Manchukuo,</b> and was hailed in the Japanese newspapers as the Joan of Arc of <b>Manchukuo.</b> In 1933, she offered the unit to the Japanese Kwantung Army for Operation Nekka, but it was refused. The unit {{continued to}} exist under her command until sometime in the late 1930s.|$|E
25|$|Before World War II, the Japanese colonized <b>Manchukuo</b> {{and used}} it as a base from which to invade China. In the summer of 1939 a border dispute between <b>Manchukuo</b> and the Mongolian People's Republic {{resulted}} in the Battle of Khalkhin Gol. During this battle, a combined Soviet-Mongolian force defeated the Japanese Kwantung Army (Kantōgun) supported by limited Manchukuoan forces.|$|E
25|$|In 1935, <b>Manchukuo</b> {{bought the}} Chinese Eastern Railway from the Soviet Union.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Manchukuo</b> National Physical Education Association was {{established}} in 1932 to promote sport.|$|E
25|$|See List of {{administrative}} divisions of <b>Manchukuo</b> {{for a complete}} list of prefecture-level divisions.|$|E
25|$|The {{commanding}} officer of the Kwantung Army in <b>Manchukuo</b> was also the Japanese ambassador to <b>Manchukuo.</b> He functioned {{in a manner similar}} to that of a British resident officer in British overseas protectorates, with the power to veto decisions by the emperor. The Kwangtung Army leadership placed Japanese vice ministers in his cabinet, while all Chinese advisors gradually resigned or were dismissed.|$|E
25|$|Historians {{generally}} consider <b>Manchukuo</b> {{a puppet}} state of Imperial Japan {{because of the}} Japanese military's strong presence and strict {{control of the government}} administration. Chinese historians generally refer to the state as 'Wei Manzhouguo' ('false state of Manchuria'). Some historians see <b>Manchukuo</b> as an effort at building a glorified Japanese state in mainland Asia that deteriorated due to the pressures of war.|$|E
25|$|The {{other two}} branches, the <b>Manchukuo</b> Imperial Air Force and the <b>Manchukuo</b> Imperial Navy, {{were small and}} underdeveloped, largely {{existing}} as token forces to give legitimacy to the <b>Manchukuo</b> regime. An Air Force was established in February 1937 with 30 men selected from the <b>Manchukuo</b> Imperial Army who were trained at the Japanese Kwantung Army aircraft arsenal in Harbin (initially the Kwantung Army did not trust the Manchukuoans enough to train a native air force for them). The Imperial Air Force's predecessor was the <b>Manchukuo</b> Air Transport Company (later renamed the <b>Manchukuo</b> National Airways), a paramilitary airline formed in 1931, which undertook transport and reconnaissance missions for the Japanese military. The first air unit was based in Hsinking (Changchun) and equipped with just one Nieuport-Delage NiD 29 and was later expanded with Nakajima Army Type 91 Fighters and Kawasaki Type 88 light bombers. Two more air units were established, but they suffered a setback when one hundred pilots took their aircraft and defected to insurgents after murdering their Japanese instructors. Nonetheless three fighter squadrons were formed in 1942 from the first batch of cadets, being equipped with Nakajima Ki-27 fighters in addition to Tachikawa Ki-9s and Tachikawa Ki-55 trainers, along with some Mitsubishi Ki-57 transports. In 1945, because of American bombing raids, they were issued with Nakajima Ki-43 fighters {{to have a better}} chance of intercepting B-29 Superfortresses. Some pilots saw action against the American bombers and at least one Ki-27 pilot downed a B-29 by ramming his plane into it in a kamikaze attack. The air force practically ceased to exist by the Soviet invasion but there were isolated instances of Manchukuoan planes attacking Soviet forces. The Imperial Navy of <b>Manchukuo</b> existed mainly as a small river flotilla and consisted mainly of small gunboats and patrol boats, both captured Chinese ships and some Japanese additions. The elderly Japanese destroyer Kashi was lent to the Manchukuoan fleet from 1937 to 1942 as the Hai Wei before returning to the Imperial Japanese Navy. These ships were mostly crewed by Japanese.|$|E
25|$|The Changshan and the Qipao, both {{derived from}} {{traditional}} Manchu dress, were considered national dresses in <b>Manchukuo.</b>|$|E
25|$|Ki-84-I Ko - Manshu Type: Manufactured in <b>Manchukuo</b> for Manshūkoku Hikōki Seizo KK by Nakajima License.|$|E
25|$|Type 94 75mm {{mountain}} gun {{was used}} extensively in <b>Manchukuo</b> during the Pacification of <b>Manchukuo,</b> {{and during the}} Second Sino-Japanese War. It was also assigned to units in the Southern Expeditionary Army and was sited in defensive positions on islands throughout the Netherlands East Indies and the South Pacific Mandate. It {{was one of the}} most common weapons encountered by Allied forces towards the closing stages of the war.|$|E
25|$|China did not {{recognize}} <b>Manchukuo</b> but the two sides established official ties for trade, communications and transportation. In 1933, the League of Nations adopted the Lytton Report, declaring that Manchuria remained rightfully part of China, leading Japan to resign its membership. The <b>Manchukuo</b> case persuaded the United States to articulate the so-called Stimson Doctrine, under which international recognition was withheld from changes {{in the international system}} created by force of arms.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Manchukuo</b> Imperial Army was {{the ground}} {{component}} of the Empire of Manchukuo's armed forces and consisted {{of as many as}} 170,000 to 220,000 troops at its peak in 1945 by some estimates, having formally been established by the Army and Navy Act of 15 April 1932. The force included members of all the major ethnic groups of <b>Manchukuo,</b> which were trained and led by Japanese instructors and advisors. Despite the numerous attempts by the Japanese to improve the combat capability of the Imperial Army and instill a Manchukuoan patriotic spirit among its troops, the majority of its units were regarded as unreliable by Japanese officers. Their main role was to fight Nationalist and Communist insurgents that continued to resist the Japanese occupation of northeastern China, and occasionally the <b>Manchukuo</b> Imperial Army took part in operations against the Chinese National Revolutionary Army and the Soviet Red Army (usually in support of the Imperial Japanese Army). Initially its members were former soldiers of Marshal Zhang Xueliang's warlord army who had surrendered to Japan during the Japanese invasion of Manchuria. But since the Young Marshal's former troops were largely not loyal to the new regime and performed poorly against partisans, the new government of <b>Manchukuo</b> took efforts to recruit—and later draft—new soldiers. In 1934 a law was passed stating that only those that had been trained by the government of <b>Manchukuo</b> could serve as officers. The Military Supplies Requisition Law of 13 May 1937 allowed Japanese and <b>Manchukuo</b> authorities to draft forced laborers. The actual calling up of conscripts for the army did not begin until 1940, at which point all youths received a physical and 10% were to be selected for service. Between 1938 and 1940, several military academies were established to provide a new officer corps for the Imperial Army, including a specific school for ethnic Mongols.|$|E
25|$|On 8 August 1945, the Soviet Union {{declared}} war on Japan, {{in accordance with the}} agreement at the Yalta Conference, and invaded <b>Manchukuo</b> from outer Manchuria and Outer Mongolia. This was called Manchurian Strategic Offensive Operation. During the Soviet offensive the Army of <b>Manchukuo,</b> on paper a 200,000-man force, performed poorly and whole units surrendered to the Soviets without firing a single shot; there were even cases of armed riots and mutinies against the Japanese forces. Emperor Kangde (known by reign title Xuantong during the Qing Dynasty; his childhood name was Puyi) had hoped to escape to Japan to surrender to the Americans, but the Soviets captured him and eventually extradited him to the communist government in China, where the authorities had him imprisoned as a war criminal along with all other captured <b>Manchukuo</b> officials.|$|E
