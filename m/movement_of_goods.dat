5|$|After the Congress of Vienna {{there was}} a degree of {{commercial}} cooperation between the various German states resulting {{in the setting of}} the German Customs Union (Zollverein). There were however still many barriers to trade until Bavaria took the lead in establishing the General German Commercial Code in 1856. As part of the code the Zollverein introduce the Zollpfund (Customs Pound) which was defined to be exactly 500g and which could be split into 30'lot'. This unit was used for inter-state <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods,</b> but was not applied in all states for internal use.|$|E
5|$|European Union law (EU law) has {{prescribed}} {{the structure}} of and relationships between all European cattle herd books since 1977. However, {{it was not until}} 2007 that the French Limousin Herd Book began a process of restructuring to comply with relevant EU regulations, directives and decisions. EU law affecting stud cattle breeding in Europe derives principally from an EU objective to achieve free <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> between member countries, and to address farmer and consumer protectionist and interventionist actions that oppose the principles of the EU Common Agricultural Policy. Intervention by member countries in their agricultural sectors poses an obstacle to free trade in European countries, which EU legislation, among other things, attempts to address.|$|E
5|$|Under Protocol 3, Jersey {{is part of}} the European Union Customs Union of the European Community. The common customs tariff, levies {{and other}} {{agricultural}} import measures apply to trade between the island and non-Member States. There is free <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> and trade between the island and Member States. EU rules on freedom of movement for workers do not apply in Jersey. However, Article 4 of the Protocol requires the island's authorities to give the same treatment to all natural and legal persons of the Communities. In Pereira, the ECJ held that {{the scope of this article}} included any matter governed by the Treaties in a territory where the Treaties are fully applicable. The island is therefore within the scope of the Treaties to a limited extent, as a European Territory. To infer, as the French Ambassador and finance minister have attempted to argue, namely that the island is outside the European Union and Communities without qualification is therefore simplistic, in law false. The French blacklisting of the island had to be hastily revoked when this was pointed out. As a result, Jersey is not part of the single market in financial services. It is not required to implement EU Directives on such matters as movement of capital, company law or money laundering. However, the island's close proximity (135km south) and its close association with the financial sector of the U.K. has come under increasing scrutiny in recent years, with several mainline publications (e.g., The Wall Street Journal) labelling the island a tax haven.|$|E

25|$|Economic {{globalization}} {{refers to}} the free <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods,</b> capital, services, technology and information. It is the increasing economic integration and interdependence of national, regional, and local economies across the world through an intensification of cross-border <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods,</b> services, technologies and capital.
