In particular, in the path integral representation of a Euclidean quantum field theory, the path integral measure is closely related to the Boltzmann distribution of a statistical <b>mechanical</b> system in <b>equilibrium.</b> In this relation, Euclidean Green's functions become correlation functions in the statistical mechanical system. A statistical <b>mechanical</b> system in <b>equilibrium</b> can be modeled, via the ergodic hypothesis, as the stationary distribution of a stochastic process.

Aim {{of this study}} is the investigation of lower limbs biomechanics before and after meniscectomy. The focus is on gait and squatting exercises. Gait is chosen because of its daily life role while squatting implies high stress of knee joint structure. Both the movements show high statistical repeatability intra and inter subjects. Materials and methods. Ten volunteers candidate to partial medial meniscectomy for meniscal tear underwent motion analysis just before surgery, six months and one year after. Ten healthy volunteers acted as a control group. All the subjects perform three gait trials and three squatting movements. Data were acquired by means of Vicon motion analyser and AMTI forces platform. Results. In gait patterns investigation, joint kinematics does not show significant modifications before and after surgery, while dynamic analysis stresses alterations in knee sagittal moment. Before surgery, healthy and affected limbs show significant differences, also referring to control group, at first impact and late stance. After surgery, asymmetries between limbs are no more significant at first impact, while the behaviour in late stance shows a reduced knee extension moment in the affected limb not present before surgery. In squatting investigation, main focus was on repeatability, being the mean behaviour consistent before and after surgery. Before surgery high inter subjects variability affects knee joint angle, stating pain response; while after surgery high variability affects also hip and ankle, suggesting a new approach to <b>mechanical</b> <b>equilibriums.</b> Conclusions. After meniscectomy, gait and squatting patterns are still altered. Before surgery, the joint mechanical structure is not highly altered and modifications are mainly due to pain avoidance schemas; after partial meniscectomy, pain disappears and the new joint behaviours are probably caused by the new mechanical asset and/or proprioceptive mechanisms...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. We derive an {{approximate}} solution valid to all orders of h to the Bloch equation for quantum <b>mechanical</b> thermal <b>equilibrium</b> distribution functions via asymptotic analysis for high temperatures and small external potentials. This approximation {{can be used}} as initial data for transient solutions of the quantum Liouville equation, to derive quantum mechanical correction terms to the classical hydrodynamic model, or to construct an eective partition function in statistical mechanics. The validity of the asymptotic solution is investigated analytically and numerically and compared with Wigner’s O(h 2) solution. Since the asymptotic analysis results in replacing second derivatives of the potential in the correction to the stress tensor in the original O(h 2) quantum hydrodynamic model by second derivatives of a smoothed potential, this approach represents a de nite improvement for the technologically important case of piecewise continuous potentials in quantum semiconductor devices.
