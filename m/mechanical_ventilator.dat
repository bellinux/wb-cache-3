5|$|Additional {{signs and}} {{symptoms}} of cervical injuries include low heart rate, low blood pressure, problems regulating body temperature, and breathing dysfunction. If the injury is high enough in the neck to impair the muscles involved in breathing, the person {{may not be able to}} breathe without the help of an endotracheal tube and <b>mechanical</b> <b>ventilator.</b>|$|E
5|$|After the trachea {{has been}} intubated, a balloon cuff is {{typically}} inflated {{just above the}} far end of the tube to help secure it in place, to prevent leakage of respiratory gases, and to protect the tracheobronchial tree from receiving undesirable material such as stomach acid. The tube is then secured to the face or neck and connected to a T-piece, anesthesia breathing circuit, bag valve mask device, or a <b>mechanical</b> <b>ventilator.</b> Once there is no longer a need for ventilatory assistance and/or protection of the airway, the tracheal tube is removed; this is referred to as extubation of the trachea (or decannulation, in the case of a surgical airway such as a cricothyrotomy or a tracheotomy).|$|E
25|$|Drugs such as {{diazepam}} {{or other}} muscle relaxants {{can be given}} to control the muscle spasms. In extreme cases {{it may be necessary}} to paralyze the patient with curare-like drugs and use a <b>mechanical</b> <b>ventilator.</b>|$|E

25|$|For dead donors, {{the process}} begins with verifying {{that the person}} is hopelessly dead, {{determining}} whether any organs could be donated, and obtaining consent for the donation of any usable organs. Normally, nothing is done until the person has already died, although if death is inevitable, it is possible to check for consent and to do some simple medical tests shortly beforehand, to help find a matching recipient. The verification of death is normally done by a neurologist (a physician specializing in brain function) that is not involved in the previous attempts to save the patient's life. This physician {{has nothing to do with}} the transplantation process. Verification of death is often done multiple times, to prevent doctors from overlooking any remaining sign of life, however small. After death, the hospital may keep the body on a <b>mechanical</b> <b>ventilator</b> and use other methods to keep the organs in good condition. Donors and their families are not charged for any expenses related to the donation.|$|E
2500|$|Positive end expiratory {{pressure}} (PEEP) is pressure applied upon expiration. [...] PEEP is applied using either a valve that {{is connected to}} the expiratory port and set manually or a valve managed internally by a <b>mechanical</b> <b>ventilator.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The trigger is {{what causes}} a breath to be {{delivered}} by a <b>mechanical</b> <b>ventilator.</b> [...] Breaths may be triggered by a patient taking their own breath, a ventilator operator pressing a manual breath button, or by the ventilator based on the set breath rate and mode of ventilation.|$|E

2500|$|The {{cycle is}} what causes the breath to {{transition}} from the inspiratory phase to the exhalation phase. [...] Breaths may be cycled by a <b>mechanical</b> <b>ventilator</b> when a set time has been reached, or when a preset flow or percentage of the maximum flow delivered during a breath is reached depending on the breath type and the settings. Breaths can also be cycled when an alarm condition such as a high pressure limit has been reached, which is a primary strategy in pressure regulated volume control.|$|E
2500|$|The {{efficiency}} of artificial respiration can be greatly increased by the simultaneous use of oxygen therapy. [...] The amount of oxygen {{available to the}} patient in mouth-to-mouth is around 16%. [...] If this is done through a pocket mask with an oxygen flow, this increases to 40% oxygen. [...] If either a bag valve mask or a <b>mechanical</b> <b>ventilator</b> is used with an oxygen supply, this rises to 99% oxygen. [...] The greater the oxygen concentration, the more efficient the gaseous exchange {{will be in the}} lungs.|$|E
2500|$|Anesthesia is {{administered}} to prevent pain from an incision, tissue manipulation and suturing. [...] Based on the procedure, anesthesia may be provided locally or as general anesthesia. [...] Spinal anesthesia {{may be used}} when the surgical site is too large or deep for a local block, but general anesthesia may not be desirable. [...] With local and spinal anesthesia, the surgical site is anesthetized, but the patient can remain conscious or minimally sedated. [...] In contrast, general anesthesia renders the patient unconscious and paralyzed during surgery. [...] The patient is intubated and is placed on a <b>mechanical</b> <b>ventilator,</b> and anesthesia is produced {{by a combination of}} injected and inhaled agents.|$|E

50|$|Ventilators come in many {{different}} styles and method of giving a breath to sustain life.

40|$|Purpose: The {{purposes}} of this study were to identify the effect of music therapy on the physiologic index, anxiety and dyspnea of patients who are weaning from <b>mechanical</b> <b>ventilators,</b> and to compare the effects between western and Korean traditional music. Methods: The research format is repeated measures design. The subject group consisted of 21 patients being weaned from mechan-ical ventilators in a tertiary general hospital in Seoul. Each patient randomly received western music, rest, and Korean traditional mu-sic. Western and Korean traditional music were played on an MP 3 head phone for 30 minutes. Patients get 30 minutes of rest between the 2 music styles and the rest period. Physiological indices, anxiety and dyspnea were measured before and after patients listened to both styles of music and the rest period. Anxiety and dyspnea were measured with a visual analogue scale. Results: Respiratory rates (RR), rapid shallow breath indexes (RSBI), anxiety and dyspnea decreased, and tidal volume (TV) increased after listening to Western and Korean tradition music in patients weaning from <b>mechanical</b> <b>ventilators.</b> Compared to western music, Korean traditional music yielded significant decreases in RR, RSBI, anxiety and dyspnea, and an increase of TV.
