5|$|Cadmium {{occurs as}} a <b>minor</b> <b>component</b> in most zinc ores {{and is a}} {{byproduct}} of zinc production. Cadmium was used {{for a long time}} as a corrosion-resistant plating on steel, and cadmium compounds are used as red, orange and yellow pigments, to colour glass, and to stabilize plastic. Cadmium use is generally decreasing because it is toxic (it is specifically listed in the European Restriction of Hazardous Substances) and nickel-cadmium batteries have been replaced with nickel-metal hydride and lithium-ion batteries. One of its few new uses is cadmium telluride solar panels.|$|E
5|$|Cobalt in {{compound}} form {{occurs as}} a <b>minor</b> <b>component</b> of copper and nickel minerals. It {{is the major}} metallic component in combination with sulfur and arsenic in the sulfidic cobaltite (CoAsS), safflorite (CoAs2), glaucodot ((Co,Fe)AsS), and skutterudite (CoAs3) minerals. The mineral cattierite is similar to pyrite and occurs together with vaesite in the copper deposits of the Katanga Province. Upon contact with the atmosphere, weathering occurs and the sulfide minerals oxidize to form pink erythrite ("cobalt glance": Co3(AsO4)2·8H2O) and spherocobaltite (CoCO3).|$|E
5|$|Early Classic ceramic finds {{are scarce}} at Motul de San José {{and those that}} have been found were a <b>minor</b> <b>component</b> in mixed fill deposits. This {{suggests}} that Motul de San José was largely abandoned in the Early Classic. The best examples of Early Classic pottery come from outside of Motul de San José itself, with several complete ceramic vessels being recovered during the construction of a modern language school in Trinidad de Nosotros and some fragments of Early Classic pottery being retrieved from a looted chultun at Wakutal.|$|E
40|$|Effects of <b>minor</b> <b>components</b> (ice, {{serpentine}} and glass) on {{the strength}} of consolidated aggregates (peridotite powder, < 500 microns) are investigated by low-velocity impact experiments. The strength is represented by the critical impact velocity at which the largest fragment becomes a half of the original mass. Aggregates without <b>minor</b> <b>components</b> have the critical impact velocity of about 2 m/s. Addition of less than a few weight percent of <b>minor</b> <b>components</b> is insignificant. When aggregates are added with more than 5 wt% ice (at - 22 ℃), or with more than about 10 wt% soda glass powder (≤ 74 microns) and heated at 700 ℃ for 15 hours, the critical impact velocity increases to about 9 m/s, which {{is similar to that of}} pure ice. Addition of several weight percents of <b>minor</b> <b>components</b> significantly enhances consolidation, when mixtures are heated up to the glass transition temperature of amorphous <b>minor</b> <b>components</b> or the melting temperature of crystalline ones. Dehydration of hydrous minerals is not effective...|$|R
40|$|<b>Minor</b> <b>components</b> {{composition}} of {{some types of}} surface lipids of some Coniferae were investigated. Among <b>minor</b> <b>components</b> of surface lipids the terpenoids of pimarane and abietane classes, squalene and p-coumaric acid were found. Their function is, probably, in the maintenance of ordering the surface lipids fraction and in increasing the temperature of phase transition «crystal – amorphous» phases...|$|R
40|$|<b>Minor</b> <b>components</b> in a porous {{electrode}} of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) {{can affect the}} electrode performance. In this study, we focus on <b>minor</b> <b>components</b> derived from raw materials and production processes. Standard polycrystalline dense cathode samples of La 0. 6 Sr 0. 4 Co 0. 2 Fe 0. 8 O 3 -δ (LSCF) were prepared using high purity raw materials by Pechini method. To evaluate {{the effects of the}} <b>minor</b> <b>components</b> on LSCF performance, <b>minor</b> <b>components</b> such as Ba, Ca, Al and Si were added to the LSCF samples. Chemical diffusion coefficient (Dchem) and surface exchange coefficient (ktr) were obtained as cathode performance factors by the conductivity relaxation measurement. The results showed that Al and Si have mostly negative effects for oxygen reduction reaction on LSCF while Ba and Ca were inert or showed positive effects for the cathode performance. We also discussed the mechanism of positive effect of Ca (Dchem,STD < Dchem,Ca and ktr,STD < ktr,Ca) using XPS measurement...|$|R
5|$|Indium is a <b>minor</b> <b>component</b> in {{zinc sulfide}} ores and is {{produced}} as {{a byproduct of}} zinc refinement. It is most notably used in the semiconductor industry, in low-melting-point metal alloys such as solders, in soft-metal high-vacuum seals, and {{in the production of}} transparent conductive coatings of indium tin oxide (ITO) on glass. Indium has no biological role, though its compounds are somewhat toxic when injected into the bloodstream. Most occupational exposure is through ingestion, from which indium compounds are not absorbed well, and inhalation, from which they are moderately absorbed.|$|E
5|$|Ruthenium is a {{chemical}} element with symbol Ru and atomic number 44. It {{is a rare}} transition metal belonging to the platinum group of the periodic table. Like the other metals of the platinum group, ruthenium is inert to most other chemicals. The Baltic German scientist Karl Ernst Claus discovered the element in 1844 and named it after his homeland, Ruthenia. Ruthenium is usually found as a <b>minor</b> <b>component</b> of platinum ores; the annual production is about 20 tonnes. Most ruthenium produced is used in wear-resistant electrical contacts and thick-film resistors. A minor application for ruthenium is in platinum alloys and as a chemistry catalyst.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, NASA planned {{to launch a}} modular space station called Freedom as a {{counterpart}} to Mir, while the Soviets were planning to construct Mir-2 in the 1990s {{as a replacement for}} the station. Because of budget and design constraints, Freedom never progressed past mock-ups and <b>minor</b> <b>component</b> tests and, with the fall of the Soviet Union {{and the end of the}} Space Race, the project was nearly cancelled entirely by the United States House of Representatives. The post-Soviet economic chaos in Russia also led to the cancellation of Mir-2, though only after its base block, DOS-8, had been constructed. Similar budgetary difficulties were faced by other nations with space station projects, which prompted the US government to negotiate with European states, Russia, Japan, and Canada in the early 1990s to begin a collaborative project. In June 1992, American president George H. W. Bush and Russian president Boris Yeltsin agreed to cooperate on space exploration. The resulting Agreement between the United States of America and the Russian Federation Concerning Cooperation in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space for Peaceful Purposes called for a short joint space programme with one American astronaut deployed to the Russian space station Mir and two Russian cosmonauts deployed to a Space Shuttle.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Extracting {{multiple}} <b>minor</b> <b>components</b> {{from the}} in-put signal is quite useful for many practical applications. In this paper, a globally convergent MCA algorithm that can extract multiple <b>minor</b> <b>components</b> sequentially is proposed. Conver-gence of this MCA algorithm is analyzed via the deterministic discrete time (DDT) method. Sufficient conditions are obtained {{to guarantee the}} convergence of this MCA algorithm. Simula-tions are carried out to further illustrate the theoretical results achieved...|$|R
40|$|A Chinese {{family with}} {{hemoglobin}} H in the propositus has been reinvestigated. Although the original propositus is now deceased, a sister {{has the same}} hematological manifestations. Her hemoglobin, {{like that of the}} deceased sister, contains hemoglobins A, H, and Bart's. In addition, however, two <b>minor</b> <b>components</b> have been detected. These <b>minor</b> <b>components</b> appear to have abnormal α-chains and are also present in the maternal grandmother, the mother, a maternal aunt, and three other siblings but only in about one-tenth the amount. One of the <b>minor</b> <b>components</b> may be the same as Hb-Thai (25). The father has the characteristics of classical α-thalassemia. These results are discussed in relation to current concepts of α-thalassemia as they relate to “silent” and “classical” α-thalassemia and to possible multiple α-chain loci...|$|R

25|$|Lignin-based {{artificial}} vanilla flavoring {{is alleged}} to have a richer flavor profile than oil-based flavoring; the difference is due to the presence of acetovanillone, a <b>minor</b> <b>component</b> in the lignin-derived product that is not found in vanillin synthesized from guaiacol.|$|E
25|$|Most {{naphthalene}} {{is derived}} from coal tar. From the 1960s until the 1990s, significant amounts of naphthalene were also produced from heavy petroleum fractions during petroleum refining, but today petroleum-derived naphthalene represents only a <b>minor</b> <b>component</b> of naphthalene production.|$|E
40|$|Extreme Components Analysis (XCA) is a {{statistical}} method {{based on a}} single eigenvalue decomposition to recover the optimal combination of principal and <b>minor</b> <b>components</b> in the data. Unfortunately, <b>minor</b> <b>components</b> are notoriously sensitive to overfitting {{when the number of}} data items is small relative to the number of attributes. We present a Bayesian extension of XCA by introducing a conjugate prior for the parameters of the XCA model. This Bayesian-XCA is shown to outperform plain vanilla XCA as well as Bayesian-PCA and XCA based on a frequentist correction to the sample spectrum. Moreover, we show that <b>minor</b> <b>components</b> are only picked when they represent genuine constraints in the data, even for very small sample sizes. An extension to mixtures of Bayesian XCA models is also explored. ...|$|R

Two <b>minor</b> <b>components</b> were isolated {{in addition to the}} known A, B, and C components. These congeners were identified as paromamine and 6 -o-(3 -amino- 3 -deoxy-α-d-glucopyranosyl) - deoxystreptamine. The identification was based on degradation and mass spectral studies...|$|R
25|$|DDT is an {{endocrine}} disruptor. It {{is considered}} {{likely to be}} a human carcinogen although the majority of studies suggest it is not directly genotoxic. DDE acts as a weak androgen receptor antagonist, but not as an estrogen. p,p'-DDT, DDT's main component, has little or no androgenic or estrogenic activity. The <b>minor</b> <b>component</b> o,p'-DDT has weak estrogenic activity.|$|E
25|$|Eucalypts {{originated}} between 35 and 50 {{million years}} ago, {{not long after}} Australia-New Guinea separated from Gondwana, their rise coinciding {{with an increase in}} fossil charcoal deposits (suggesting that fire was a factor even then), but they remained a <b>minor</b> <b>component</b> of the Tertiary rainforest until about 20 million years ago, when the gradual drying of the continent and depletion of soil nutrients {{led to the development of}} a more open forest type, predominantly Casuarina and Acacia species.|$|E
25|$|An {{additional}} reason, noticed {{for example}} by Michael Hudson, {{is that in}} the rich countries, the stock of privately owned physical production capital used in industries is nowadays only a <b>minor</b> <b>component</b> of the total capital stock. If, therefore, the profit rate on privately owned physical industrial capital falls a percent or two, this cannot have a very large or immediate negative effect on the whole economy. To claim that it does have such a big effect, makes no mathematical or econometric sense whatever.|$|E

25|$|Given its size, {{the graceful}} shark is {{potentially}} dangerous to humans, though no attacks have been recorded. It is caught incidentally by commercial fisheries in Thailand, India, Sri Lanka, and probably elsewhere, using gillnets and longlines. It is a <b>minor</b> <b>component</b> of shark catches off northern Australia, comprising around 1.5% and 0.2% of all sharks caught in gillnets and on longlines, respectively, in the mid-1980s. Catches {{in the region}} have declined from historical highs in the 1970s and 1980s due to the departure of foreign fishing vessels following new gillnet regulations. The meat is sold fresh or dried and salted, the fins are shipped to East Asia for shark fin soup, and the liver is processed for vitamins. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed this species as Near Threatened, noting more biological and fishery information is needed.|$|E
25|$|Lunisolar {{precession}} {{is caused}} by the gravitational forces of the Moon and Sun on Earth's equatorial bulge, causing Earth's axis to move with respect to inertial space. Planetary precession (an advance) is due to the small angle between the gravitational force of the other planets on Earth and its orbital plane (the ecliptic), causing the plane of the ecliptic to shift slightly relative to inertial space. Lunisolar precession is about 500 times greater than planetary precession. In addition to the Moon and Sun, the other planets also cause a small movement of Earth's axis in inertial space, making the contrast in the terms lunisolar versus planetary misleading, so in 2006 the International Astronomical Union recommended that the dominant component be renamed, the precession of the equator, and the <b>minor</b> <b>component</b> be renamed, precession of the ecliptic, but their combination is still named general precession. Many references to the old terms exist in publications predating the change.|$|E
500|$|Commonly carbon-containing {{compounds}} {{which are}} associated with minerals or which do not contain hydrogen or fluorine, are treated separately from classical organic compounds; the definition is not rigid (see reference articles above).

[...] This was once the principal constituent of the paleoatmosphere, but is a <b>minor</b> <b>component</b> of the Earth's atmosphere today. Dissolved in water, it forms carbonic acid (...) , but as most compounds with multiple single-bonded oxygens on a single carbon it is unstable.

500|$|In 1848, Jones Quain {{described}} the nerve as the [...] "spinal nerve accessory to the vagus", recognizing that while a <b>minor</b> <b>component</b> of the nerve joins {{with the larger}} vagus nerve, the majority of accessory nerve fibres originate in the spinal cord. In 1893 it was recognised that the heretofore named nerve fibres [...] "accessory" [...] to the vagus originated from the same nucleus in the medulla oblongata, and it came to pass that these fibres were increasingly viewed {{as part of the}} vagus nerve itself. Consequently, the term [...] "accessory nerve" [...] was and is increasingly used to denote only fibres from the spinal cord; the fact that only the spinal portion could be tested clinically lent weight to this opinion.|$|E
500|$|Rubidium is a <b>minor</b> <b>component</b> in lepidolite. Kirchhoff and Bunsen {{processed}} 150kg of a lepidolite containing only 0.24% rubidium oxide (Rb2O). Both potassium and rubidium form insoluble salts with chloroplatinic acid, {{but those}} salts show a slight difference in solubility in hot water. Therefore, the less-soluble rubidium hexachloroplatinate (Rb2PtCl6) {{could be obtained}} by fractional crystallization. After reduction of the hexachloroplatinate with hydrogen, the process yielded 0.51grams of rubidium chloride for further studies. Bunsen and Kirchhoff began their first large-scale isolation of caesium and rubidium compounds with [...] of mineral water, which yielded 7.3grams of caesium chloride and 9.2grams of rubidium chloride. Rubidium was the second element, shortly after caesium, to be discovered by spectroscopy, just {{one year after the}} invention of the spectroscope by Bunsen and Kirchhoff.|$|E
