5|$|The Army {{decided that}} an {{individual}} <b>machine</b> <b>gun,</b> lighter than the M60, but with more firepower than the M16, would be advantageous; troops {{would no longer have}} to rely on rifles for automatic fire. Through the 1960s, the introduction of a <b>machine</b> <b>gun</b> into the infantry squad was examined in various studies. While there was a brief flirtation with the concept of a flechette- or dart-firing Universal <b>Machine</b> <b>Gun</b> during one study, most light <b>machine</b> <b>gun</b> experiments concentrated on the Stoner 63 light <b>machine</b> <b>gun,</b> a modular weapon that could be easily modified for different purposes. The Stoner63 LMG saw combat for a brief period in Vietnam with the Marine Corps, and later on a wider scale with the U.S. Navy SEALs.|$|E

5|$|T-26 model 1933: single turret version {{armed with}} 45mm 20K tank gun and DT tank <b>machine</b> <b>gun.</b> This version {{had a new}} {{cylindrical}} turret with a large rear niche. Some tanks were equipped with a 71-TK-1 radio station with a hand-rail antenna around the turret (so-called radio tanks). They were upgraded in 1935 with a welded hull and turret, and again in 1936 with a rear DT tank <b>machine</b> <b>gun</b> in the turret. In 1937, some tanks were equipped with an anti-aircraft <b>machine</b> <b>gun</b> and a searchlight. The model 1933 was the most numerous variant.|$|E
5|$|The 2/1st <b>Machine</b> <b>Gun</b> Battalion {{was formed}} on 14 December 1939, {{as part of}} the Second Australian Imperial Force (2nd AIF). It was raised {{following}} a reorganisation of the 6th Division's infantry battalions, which saw the removal of the <b>machine</b> <b>gun</b> platoons that had previously existed within each battalion and their centralisation in a single unit. Three other <b>machine</b> <b>gun</b> battalions were subsequently raised {{as part of the}} 2nd AIF during the war to support its four infantry divisions. Developed by the British Army, the concept within the Australian Army had its genesis during the Gallipoli Campaign in 1915, when the machine guns assigned to the infantry battalions– initially two and then, later, four– had been grouped together and co-ordinated at brigade level to help compensate for the lack of artillery support. Over {{the course of the war}} on the Western Front, the concept had evolved through the establishment of <b>machine</b> <b>gun</b> companies in 1916 to the establishment of <b>machine</b> <b>gun</b> battalions in 1918. Similar formations had also been established amongst the Australian Light Horse units serving in the Sinai and Palestine Campaign. During the inter-war years, the <b>machine</b> <b>gun</b> battalions had been deemed unnecessary. When the Army was reorganised in 1921, they were not re-raised, but in 1937, when the Army looked to expand as fears of war in Europe loomed, four such units were raised within the part-time Militia by converting light horse units and motorising them. When the Second World War broke out, the decision was made to raise several <b>machine</b> <b>gun</b> battalions within the 2nd AIF, one allocated to each division.|$|E

5|$|The 2/2nd <b>Machine</b> <b>Gun</b> Battalion {{was one of}} four <b>machine</b> <b>gun</b> battalions {{that were}} raised as part of the all-volunteer Second Australian Imperial Force (2nd AIF) for service {{overseas}} during the Second World War. Motorised infantry units, equipped with wheeled motor vehicles, motor cycles and sometimes tracked carriers, the <b>machine</b> <b>gun</b> battalions were formed to provide a greater level of support by fire than that which was organically available within ordinary infantry battalions.|$|E

Motorised infantry units, equipped with wheeled motor vehicles, motorcycles and sometimes tracked carriers, the <b>machine</b> <b>gun</b> battalions were formed to provide a greater level of support by fire than that which was organically available within ordinary infantry battalions. At its peak, the 2/3rd was equipped with 124 motor vehicles of various descriptions and 50 motorcycles.|$|E
5|$|The 2/4th <b>Machine</b> <b>Gun</b> Battalion {{was one of}} four <b>machine</b> <b>gun</b> battalions {{raised as}} part of the all {{volunteer}} Second Australian Imperial Force (2nd AIF) for service overseas during the Second World War.

Several other Militia <b>machine</b> <b>gun</b> battalions were also raised as new units later after the Second World War began. These were formed by consolidating the <b>machine</b> <b>gun</b> companies assigned to a number of infantry battalions, and other light horse units were also converted into the role for use as garrison forces. Within the 2nd AIF—Australia's overseas expeditionary force—the decision was made to raise four <b>machine</b> <b>gun</b> battalions as corps troops that were usually allocated at a rate of one per division; several of the Militia units were also later designated Australian Imperial Force units, after the majority of their personnel volunteered for overseas service. This meant that they could be deployed outside of Australian territory even though they were not 2nd AIF units.|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} {{interface}} on <b>machine</b> <b>guns</b> is a pistol grip and trigger. On earlier manual <b>machine</b> <b>guns,</b> {{the most common}} type was a hand crank. On externally powered <b>machine</b> <b>guns,</b> such as miniguns, an electronic button or trigger on a joystick is commonly used. Light <b>machine</b> <b>guns</b> often have a butt stock attached, while vehicle and tripod mounted <b>machine</b> <b>guns</b> usually have spade grips. In the late 20th century, scopes and other complex optics became more common as opposed to the more basic iron sights.|$|R

The M249 is manufactured in the United States by the local subsidiary FN Manufacturing LLC in South Carolina and is widely used in the U.S. Armed Forces. The weapon was introduced in 1984 after being judged the most effective {{of a number of}} candidate weapons to address the lack of automatic firepower in small units. The M249 provides infantry squads with the high rate of fire of a <b>machine</b> <b>gun</b> combined with accuracy and portability approaching that of a rifle.|$|E
5|$|The M9 {{used the}} same chassis and {{mechanical}} components as the M5. It was laid out to provide similar stowage, access to the radios from the inside, rear doors, and a pedestal <b>machine</b> <b>gun</b> mount as with the M2. The M9A1 variant of the M9 matched the improvements made to the M2, M3, and M5, changing to ring mount <b>machine</b> <b>gun</b> mount and three pintle <b>machine</b> <b>gun</b> mounts.|$|E
5|$|An autocannon is {{a cannon}} {{with a larger}} caliber than a <b>machine</b> <b>gun,</b> but smaller {{than that of a}} field gun. Autocannons have {{mechanisms}} to automatically load their ammunition, and therefore have a faster rate of fire than artillery, often approaching—and, in the case of Gatling guns, surpassing—that of a <b>machine</b> <b>gun.</b> The traditional minimum bore for autocannon—indeed, for all types of cannon, as autocannon are the lowest-caliber pieces—has remained 20mm, since World War II.|$|E
50|$|The 1960s and 70s saw the {{introduction}} of new families of automatic weapons using smaller cartridges than the full-power rifle caliber cartridges previously in use. These weapons were called Squad Automatic Weapons (SAW). They have taken roles away from the previous medium <b>machine</b> <b>guns,</b> as well as lighter <b>machine</b> <b>guns</b> of the same caliber. The medium <b>machine</b> <b>guns</b> continue to be used in many of their previous roles however, especially on tanks and vehicles.
