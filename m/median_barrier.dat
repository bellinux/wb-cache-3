40|$|Abstract: <b>Median</b> <b>barriers</b> {{are used}} in state {{highways}} to prevent cross-median crashes. However, installation of <b>median</b> <b>barriers</b> as a noise source in urban areas could make an increase in sound inconvenience. The aim {{of this paper is}} to investigate the noise performances of <b>median</b> <b>barriers</b> having different shapes. The 2 D dimensional boundary element method (BEM) is used to analyze the influence of the screens. Various <b>median</b> <b>barriers</b> are designed and results are presented demonstrating that the T-shape, A-shape, Y-shape and Z-shape barriers produce less noise pollution compared with a plain barrier as their A-weighted insertion loss in the source side is higher than that of a simple plain barrier. Comparisons between all tested screens indicate that the best efficiency of noise pollution reduction is found by tilted barriers compared with plain barrier by 1. 2 to 1. 6 dB (A). It is also found that, such performance is higher when the source side of the barrier is tilted outward by 10 degrees.

5|$|An {{expert panel}} of {{engineers}} {{released a report}} outlining concerns regarding the decreased loop ramp radii {{and a lack of}} protective guardrail at sharp curves, in addition to the lack of a concrete <b>median</b> <b>barrier</b> to separate the opposite directions of travel. However, it was also argued that the large grass median was sufficient to prevent cross-over collisions, given that Highway410 has a similar median.|$|E
5|$|Construction of an {{extension}} to Route 115 (Santa Clara Street, now SR 130) at 30th Street in San Jose began in 1939, and {{was completed by}} late 1940. As with the portion between Fourth and 13th Streets, it was not marked as a numbered route. The state legislature authorized {{an extension}} beyond San Jose back to El Camino Real near Ford Road in 1947, which was already under construction, and was completed that year. This was the first segment built with interchanges, and included a <b>median</b> <b>barrier.</b> Despite this, most crossings were at-grade; only the two ends at Route 115 (Santa Clara Street) and regular US 101 included bridges, the former a diamond interchange and the latter a simple split with additional access to Ford Road. It also crossed over Coyote Road, though with no access, {{just south of the}} Coyote Creek bridge. The original 1947 bridge over Coyote Road remains, though widened in 1990, {{and is one of the}} oldest road-road grade separations on the present freeway.|$|E
25|$|Construction {{has been}} ongoing as of 2009 {{to upgrade the}} bridge. Changes {{including}} a third supporting pier, {{the removal of the}} <b>median</b> <b>barrier,</b> the removal and replacement of the old roadway with a new superstructure, and demolition of the old supporting piers are being undertaken at a cost of $192.8 million.|$|E
50|$|<b>Median</b> <b>barriers</b> {{are used}} to prevent {{vehicles}} from crossing over a median and striking an oncoming vehicle in a head-on crash. Unlike roadside barriers, they must be designed to be struck from either side.|$|R
50|$|Some {{of these}} {{measures}} can also reduce the frequency and severity of head-on collisions. <b>Median</b> <b>barriers</b> are a form of guard rail that turn head-on crashes into fixed object crashes. Curve delineation and cross-section improvements can reduce loss-of-control incidents.|$|R
50|$|The South Eastern Freeway {{features}} 6 {{lanes of}} traffic, arrester beds and concrete <b>median</b> <b>barriers,</b> with street lighting between Glen Osmond and Crafers. The {{remainder of the}} length to the Swanport Bridge is dual carriageways with two lanes in each direction.|$|R
25|$|The movable <b>median</b> <b>barrier</b> {{between the}} lanes is moved several times daily {{to conform to}} traffic patterns. On weekday mornings, traffic flows mostly {{southbound}} into the city, so {{four of the six}} lanes run southbound. Conversely, on weekday afternoons, four lanes run northbound. During off-peak periods and weekends, traffic is split with three lanes in each direction.|$|E
25|$|The Auckland Harbour Bridge, {{opened in}} 1959, {{is the main}} {{connection}} between the North Shore {{and the rest of}} the Auckland metropolitan area. The bridge provides eight lanes of vehicle traffic and has a moveable <b>median</b> <b>barrier</b> for lane flexibility, but does not provide access for rail, pedestrians or cyclists. The Central Motorway Junction, also called 'Spaghetti Junction' for its complexity, is the intersection between the two major motorways of Auckland (State Highway 1 and State Highway 16).|$|E
25|$|The Taconic {{begins at}} Kensico Circle, {{just south of}} Kensico Dam, {{in the town of}} Mount Pleasant, also the {{northern}} terminus of the Bronx River Parkway, at that point a surface road. The roadway here is narrow, with two lanes in either direction divided by a metal box beam <b>median</b> <b>barrier.</b> It curves northwest to a traffic light at Cleveland Street in the hamlet of Valhalla. The Valhalla station on Metro-North Railroad's Harlem Line is on the west side, with the downtown area on the east. It is the only densely developed community the road goes through rather than near.|$|E
50|$|Besides signals, signs, and markings, {{other forms}} of traffic control are {{designed}} and built into the roadway. For instance, curbs and rumble strips {{can be used to}} keep traffic in a given lane and <b>median</b> <b>barriers</b> can prevent left turns and even U-turns.|$|R
50|$|There are recent {{upgrades}} to the highway. The interchange with Marine Way was reconstructed {{as part of}} a $211-million-dollar {{project to}} improve access to Lower Mainland border crossings. There are also <b>median</b> <b>barriers</b> on Highway 91A over the Queensborough Bridge, and the Howes Street intersection was upgraded to a full interchange.|$|R
40|$|Median-crossover crashes {{involve a}} vehicle departing the travel lane, {{traversing}} the median, and striking either a fixed object or an oncoming {{vehicle in the}} opposing direction of traffic. These types of crashes present the highest risk of fatal and severe injuries among all collision types on freeways. Median-crossover crashes are caused {{by a variety of}} factors, including driver distraction, impaired driving, mechanical failure, and loss of control. <b>Median</b> <b>barriers</b> are the primary countermeasure to reduce the opportunity for multi-vehicle cross-median crashes. Due to the lower installation costs, as compared to more rigid systems, high-tension <b>median</b> cable <b>barrier</b> has become a popular countermeasure for reducing such crashes. The Iowa Department of Transportation (Iowa DOT) began installing high-tension <b>median</b> cable <b>barriers</b> in 2003 and will have approximately 330 miles of such barrier installed on freeways statewide by the end of 2018. While anecdotal evidence suggests that cable barriers are functioning as desired, no in-depth analysis of performance or cost-effectiveness has been conducted to date. This project aims to determine the cost-effectiveness of <b>median</b> cable <b>barrier</b> systems based on crash cost savings resulting from reductions in fatal and injury crashes as compared to the costs associated with increased property-damage-only crashes, installation costs, and ongoing maintenance costs. An in-depth analysis of the frequency and severity of crashes occurring in the freeway median was conducted. This research identified general trends in crash frequency and severity between the pre- and post-installation periods. Following an extensive manual review of crash narratives, a before-and-after study design showed the overall impact of the <b>median</b> cable <b>barrier</b> program was a 51. 3 % reduction in fatal crashes. The barrier program also showed an 80. 4 % increase in total crashes, which was driven by an increase in property-damage-only crashes of 118. 1 %. Installation and maintenance repair costs on the barrier were investigated and discussed. The design life of the <b>median</b> cable <b>barrier</b> was recommended to be 20 years with a benefit-cost ratio of 9. 153. Geometric characteristics such as median width, shoulder width, and barrier offset were investigated, but no significant trends were identified. Future research as to the relationship between roadway geometric characteristics and <b>median</b> cable <b>barrier</b> effectiveness is recommended in order to plan for subsequent installations of <b>median</b> cable <b>barrier</b> in Iowa...|$|R
25|$|Petrović died in {{a traffic}} {{accident}} at approximately 17:20 on June 7, 1993, {{four and a half}} months before his 29th birthday. On the rain-drenched Autobahn 9, he was a passenger in a car that was cut off by a semi truck at Denkendorf, near Ingolstadt, in the German state of Bavaria. According to the report of the Ingolstadt police, that afternoon a truck broke through the Autobahn median; the truck driver was trying to avoid a collision with a personal vehicle in his own lane and lost control of the truck, crashing through the <b>median</b> <b>barrier</b> and finally coming to a stop blocking all three lanes of traffic in the opposite direction (Munich). Seconds later, the VW Golf carrying a sleeping Petrović in the passenger seat crashed into the truck, killing him and leaving the driver, Klara Szalantzy, a Hungarian model and basketball player with whom Petrović was romantically involved, and Hilal Edebal, a female Turkish basketball player, with grave injuries. It was established that visibility on the road was very poor and that Petrović was not buckled with a seatbelt.|$|E
25|$|The {{first major}} change {{was made in}} {{preparation}} for the North Freeway connection, when the directions of Calhoun Avenue and Jefferson Street were swapped so that they would alternate. A bridge, dated 1954, was built to carry traffic from Jefferson Street over traffic to Jefferson Street, and US 75 was moved to Calhoun Avenue northbound, soon crossing downtown on the one-way pair of Calhoun Avenue and Pierce Street to the new North Freeway. A <b>median</b> <b>barrier</b> was added in 1956 to prevent crossover accidents. Southeast of downtown Houston, the at-grade intersections proved dangerous, and only two had been replaced with interchanges by 1959, when the Texas Highway Department began a program to upgrade the road to full freeway standards. Frontage roads would be required along the entire highway, since the state had not purchased access rights, and so abutting property owners were able to build driveways to the road. To accomplish this, traffic was shifted to the newly built frontage roads so that the central main lanes could be reconstructed. This grade separation was completed from Houston to Almeda-Genoa Road (exit 34) in June 1959, Farm to Market Road 1959 (exit 30) in October 1964, Farm to Market Road 518 (exit 23) in December 1970, and Farm to Market Road 1764 (exit 15) in 1976. As the section beyond FM 1764 into Galveston had already been rebuilt, this marked the completion of the Gulf Freeway as an actual freeway.|$|E
500|$|A 390-year {{flood event}} {{took place on}} the night of August 30, 2003, at the Kansas Turnpike's {{crossing}} of Jacobs Creek, a tributary of the Cottonwood River [...] southwest of Emporia (turnpike milepost 116). A thunderstorm that evening dropped large amounts of rain in the area, with a gauge at Plymouth reporting [...] of rainfall in a 24-hour period. The culvert carrying Jacobs Creek under the turnpike quickly exceeded its capacity, and water rose onto the turnpike. A pool of water [...] deep formed on the northbound lanes; the concrete <b>median</b> <b>barrier</b> initially prevented most of the water from crossing to the southbound lanes. Seven cars, all headed northbound, stalled in the floodwater. The <b>median</b> <b>barrier</b> then gave way, sweeping the stalled cars across the southbound lanes and down the creek as far as [...] from the highway. Six people died in the flood.|$|E

500|$|When the skyway first opened, {{it carried}} five lanes; the center one was {{intended}} as a breakdown lane, but was used as a [...] "suicide lane" [...] for passing slower traffic. By the 1950s, the skyway was seeing over 400crashes per year; an aluminum <b>median</b> <b>barrier</b> was added in mid-1956, in addition to a new pavement coating designed to make the road less slippery.|$|E
500|$|While {{the median}} was built, a few {{problems}} {{needed to be}} resolved {{in order for the}} road to work both safely and in an environmentally friendly way. Emergency personnel needed to quickly access accidents and provide them easy transport to nearby hospitals. To alleviate this problem, Caltrans implemented electric gate technology, which would allow emergency vehicles to cut through certain parts of the median. The other problem was to both protect the plant life and the salt marsh harvest mice [...] residing around the highway. As a result, crews placed timbers and sheeting to protect foliage, and added holes into the <b>median</b> <b>barrier</b> to allow the mice to cross the highway.|$|E
500|$|The roadway's median, while {{initially}} {{thought to}} be wide enough, was considered too narrow by 1960. The turnpike commission installed median barriers at curves and high-accident areas starting in the 1950s. In 1960, it began to install [...] of <b>median</b> <b>barrier</b> along the turnpike. Work was completed in December 1965 {{at a cost of}} $5 million. In October 1963, work began on replacing the New Stanton interchange, which required left turns across traffic on the ramps and was frequently congested. The new, grade-separated interchange opened on November 12, 1964 and provided access to I-70 at the western end of the turnpike stretch of I-70/I-76. A new interchange serving I-283 and PA 283 opened at Harrisburg East in 1969. Due to the realignment of US 222 to a four-lane freeway, a new Reading interchange was proposed. This was opened on April 10, 1974.|$|E

500|$|On September 24, 2015, {{five people}} were killed and fifty were injured when an amphibious [...] "duck tour" [...] vehicle crashed into a charter bus on the bridge in an {{accident}} that also involved two smaller vehicles. According to a representative from the Chinese consulate, all of the students were foreign-born. The students all attended North Seattle College, and {{were on their way to}} Safeco Field for new student orientation. One witness reported that it appeared as though the duck boat veered into the oncoming bus, after crossing the center line. Some blame for the accident was placed on the narrowness of the [...] bridge deck, which has [...] lanes, and the lack of a <b>median</b> <b>barrier</b> to separate the two directions of traffic. There have also been some calls to reduce the number of lanes in order to widen lanes, although early reports indicated that a mechanical failure of the duck tour vehicles' front axle may have also been a major factor in the crash.|$|E
500|$|Although {{the highway}} was {{designed}} and built to what were, at the time, high standards, with a 100-foot (30 m) wide right-of-way in most places, it was accident-prone because it lacked a <b>median</b> <b>barrier.</b> One segment of the so-called [...] "Bloody Bayshore" [...] was [...] "Boneyard Hill", a steep grade through the Visitacion Valley near the San Francisco city line, running past a bone meal plant. Causes of the crashes included turning conflicts at intersections, and speeding drivers crossing the centerline to use the oncoming lanes as a passing lane. The roadway was entirely at-grade except for crossings of rail lines. It generally followed the present alignment of the Bayshore Freeway, but deviated in several places: Old Bayshore Highway in San Jose, Veterans Boulevard in Redwood City, Bayshore Highway in Burlingame, a destroyed section of road through San Francisco International Airport, and Airport and Bayshore Boulevards from South San Francisco through Brisbane into San Francisco.
