The properties of starch film {{can be improved}} by adding plasticizers and blending with the other biopolymers. Results <b>Cassava</b> <b>starch</b> (5 %w/v) based films plasticized with glycerol (30 g/ 100 g starch) were characterized {{with respect to the}} effect of carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) concentrations (0, 10, 20, 30 and 40 %w/w total solid) and relative humidity (34 and 54 %RH) on the mechanical properties of the films. Additionally, intermolecular interactions were determined by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), melting temperature by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and morphology by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Water solubility of the films was also determined. Increasing concentration of CMC increased tensile strength, reduced elongation at break, and decreased water solubility of the blended films. FT-IR spectra indicated intermolecular interactions between <b>cassava</b> <b>starch</b> and CMC in blended films by shifting of carboxyl (C = O) and OH groups. DSC thermograms and SEM micrographs confirmed homogeneity of cassava starch-CMC films.

The mixture was then sprayed with ethanol and heated using microwave power. The Degree of Substitution (DS), Reaction Efficiency (RE) and some physical properties of the acetylated starches were then analyzed. It was found that microwave assisted acetylation of <b>cassava</b> <b>starch</b> using chloroacetic acid can be done in a very short reaction time. The highest DS and RE obtained were 0. 045 and 0. 051 %, respectively. Acetylation of <b>cassava</b> <b>starch</b> reduced gel hardness during storage. Acetylation also inhibits the retrogradation of <b>starch</b> gel. <b>Cassava</b> <b>starch</b> acetylation changed starch molecular motion, resulting in a decrease in the glass transition temperature. Amylopectin retrogradation was not significantly reduced, indicating that the degrees of modification of the starches in this study were too low to cause enough steric hindrance to prevent retrogradation. The modifications were done on native starch granules; they took place preferentially on the amylose fraction, not the amylopectin fraction, thus leaving amylopectin retrogradation was mostly unaffected. It can be concluded that microwave heating can be applied in the acetylation of <b>cassava</b> <b>starch</b> to obtain significant changes of the properties of starch...|$|R

40|$|O polvilho é utilizado como ingrediente {{principal}} na fabricação de biscoitos e de pão de queijo. O polvilho azedo é um produto artesanal, sem padrão de qualidade estabelecido, com problemas de higiene em seu processamento e de oferta. Ainda não está padronizada a tecnologia de produção, assim como a caracterização ou tipificação desse produto. O trabalho teve como objetivo caracterizar produtos panificados contendo féculas de mandioca para uso culinário e modificadas e testar novas formulações, incluindo o subproduto da obtenção do extrato aquoso de soja - okara. Neste trabalho, pré-misturas de pão de queijo, biscoito de polvilho, chipa paraguaya e amostras de polvilhos doce, azedo e modificados foram comparadas físico-quimicamente. As características de qualidade de pão de queijo, biscoito de polvilho e pão de queijo suplementado com 5, 10 e 15 % de okara foram investigadas. As características do polvilho azedo que o difere do polvilho doce são: pH, acidez, grau de expansão, viscosidade, claridade de pasta, sinérese e poder redutor. Foram aplicados nos produtos panificados quatro tipos diferentes de fécula, sendo polvilho doce, azedo, fécula modificada com peróxido de hidrogênio e fécula modificada comercial ExpandexÒ 160003. Obtidos os produtos panificados, foi determinada a composição físico-química e observado que os tipos de féculas influenciaram nas características internas, externas e no sabor. Os pães de queijo suplementados com subproduto okara apresentaram uma elevação do teor de proteínas e de fibras alimentares. Os produtos panificados foram submetidos a análise sensorial de aceitabilidade utilizando-se a escala hedônica de nove pontos, com provadores não-treinados. As amostras de pão de queijo contendo polvilho azedo, fécula modificada oxidada com peróxido de hidrogênio e fécula modificada comercial ExpandexÒ 160003 obtiveram uma aceitação próxima. Para as amostras de biscoito de polvilho verificou-se que as com polvilho azedo e ExpandexÒ 160003 não diferiram estatisticamente. Pães de queijo com 5, 10 e 15 % de okara não foram consideradas diferentes significativamente em nível de 5 % e tiveram boa aceitação. <b>Cassava</b> <b>starch</b> {{is used as}} {{the main}} ingredient for making biscuits and cheese bread. Sour <b>cassava</b> <b>starch</b> is produced without an established standard of quality, with hygiene problems in processing, as well as product availability during the years. Still the production technology is not standardized, {{as well as the}} characterization of this product. This study has the objective of characterizing baked products with native and modified <b>cassava</b> <b>starches</b> for baked foods and tests a new formulation including the byproduct okara. In this work, commercial samples of cheese bread, <b>cassava</b> <b>starch</b> biscuits, chipa paraguaya as well as <b>cassava</b> <b>starch,</b> sour <b>cassava</b> <b>starch</b> and modified <b>cassava</b> <b>starches</b> were compared in terms of physicochemical properties. The quality characteristics of cheese bread, <b>cassava</b> <b>starch</b> biscuits and cheese bread supplemented with 5, 10 and 15 % of okara were investigated. The characteristics of sour starch that makes it different from <b>cassava</b> <b>starch</b> are pH, acidity, degree of expansion, viscosity, clarity of the starch paste, freeze-thaw stability and reducing power. Four different starches were applied in the production of the baked products: <b>cassava</b> <b>starch,</b> sour <b>cassava</b> <b>starch,</b> starch modified with hydrogen peroxide and the modified starch named ExpandexÒ 160003. The baked products were evaluated in order to establish their physicochemical properties and observe the influence of the different starches on sensory evaluation. The results showed that the cheese breads supplemented with the byproduct okara had an increase in the protein and dietary fiber contents. The baked foods were submitted to an acceptability sensory evaluation with a nine point hedonic scale, involving untrained panelists. For the cheese bread samples containing sour <b>starch</b> <b>cassava,</b> <b>starch</b> modified by oxidation with hydrogen peroxide and the commercial starch ExpandexÒ 160003 resulted in close acceptability. For the <b>cassava</b> <b>starch</b> biscuits it was possible to conclude that the sour <b>cassava</b> <b>starch</b> and ExpandexÒ 160003 did not differ statistically. The cheese breads made with 5, 10 and 15 % of okara were not statistically different at the level 5 % and had good acceptability...|$|R
