50|$|DVDVideoSoft {{project was}} {{launched}} in 2006. The founders distributed paid software as an affiliate at the beginning, later their own products appeared on the site. Free YouTube Download was the first successful program, then DVDVideoSoft created and launched several other 'Free YouTube' applications. Later on upon users' requests DVDVideoSoft started developing other kinds of applications including <b>media</b> <b>converters</b> etc. Today DVDVideoSoft offers 49 different multimedia programs.|$|R
50|$|Sercos III is {{designed}} {{in such a}} way that no additional network infrastructure (standard Ethernet switches, Hubs, etc.) is required to operate. In fact, no additional standard Ethernet (non-Sercos III capable) components may be placed within a Sercos III network, as their presence will adversely affect the timing and synchronization of the network. To guarantee synchronization in extended networks using <b>media</b> <b>converters</b> requires Cut-through switching. If ring redundancy shall be achieved, Link Loss Forwarding with appropriate reaction times is necessary.|$|R
50|$|A fiber <b>media</b> <b>converter</b> is {{a simple}} {{networking}} device {{that makes it possible}} to connect two dissimilar media types such as twisted pair with fiber optic cabling. They were introduced to the industry in the 1990s, and are important in interconnecting fiber optic cabling-based systems with existing copper-based, structured cabling systems. They are also used in metropolitan area network (MAN) access and data transport services to enterprise customers.|$|E
5000|$|The Fuze {{supports}} MP3, WMA, PCM WAV, and, {{since the}} 1.01.15 firmware revision, OGG Vorbis and FLAC audio codecs. The Fuze can display both pictures and videos, {{both of which}} must first be converted with the Sansa <b>Media</b> <b>Converter</b> software for Windows; this program converts images to BMP format and videos to DivX-AVI, with specific parameters that make the media compatible with the device. Alternatively, the open-source, platform-independent Video4Fuze application can be used. Video4Fuze offers more options {{and the ability to}} save the file to a computer instead of having the device plugged in every time one wants to convert a file. The Sansa Fuze supports media playlist types of [...]m3u and [...]wpl.|$|E
5000|$|The Sansa e200 {{series is}} a {{portable}} media player developed by SanDisk, and released on January 5, 2006. The device {{is available in}} four capacities of Flash memory: 2 GB (e250), 4 GB (e260), 6 GB (e270), and 8 GB (e280). All players have a 1.8-inch, TFT LCD display with a resolution of 176 by 220 pixels. Certain files, if not in a format accepted by the player, must first be converted with the Sansa <b>Media</b> <b>Converter</b> Windows software. This will convert images to bitmap format (.bmp) and videos to MJPEG (in a [...]mov container), for v1 models. On v2 players it will convert videos to DivX and simply resize images. It {{is not possible to}} simply copy videos to the device, even if they seem to be in the correct format; trying to access them displays an error message.|$|E
50|$|A {{multimedia}} {{framework is}} a software framework that handles media {{on a computer}} and through a network. A good multimedia framework offers an intuitive API and a modular architecture to easily add support for new audio, video and container formats and transmission protocols. It {{is meant to be}} used by applications such as media players and audio or video editors, but {{can also be used to}} build videoconferencing applications, <b>media</b> <b>converters</b> and other multimedia tools. Data is processed among modules automatically, it is unnecessary for app to pass buffers between connected modules one by one.|$|R
50|$|Horizontal cross-connects {{provide a}} {{point for the}} {{consolidation}} of all horizontal cabling, which extends in a star topology to individual work areas such as cubicles and offices. Under TIA/EIA-568-B, maximum allowable horizontal cable distance is 90m of installed cabling, whether fibre or twisted-pair, with 100m of maximum total length including patch cords. No patch cord should be longer than 5m. Optional consolidation points are allowable in horizontal cables, often appropriate for open-plan office layouts where consolidation points or <b>media</b> <b>converters</b> may connect cables to several desks or via partitions.|$|R
50|$|The {{most recent}} {{version of the}} codec itself is version 6.9.2, which is several years old. New version numbers on the {{packages}} now reflect updates to the <b>media</b> player, <b>converter,</b> etc.|$|R
