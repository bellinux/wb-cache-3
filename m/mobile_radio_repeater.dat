5000|$|After {{a massive}} 1975 Tornado that hit Omaha, damage {{assessment}} {{was taken by}} REACT members around the city. However, [...] "Class D" [...] CB radio communications proved unreliable due to radio skip. After enough donations were received, {{the decision was made}} to abandon Class D CB Radios and the team moved to [...] "Class A" [...] CB Radios, which eventually became the General <b>Mobile</b> <b>Radio</b> Service. A <b>repeater</b> was purchased and installed, which operated at the frequency 462.700 MHz. Because this frequency is an [...] "interstitial" [...] frequency, the public was able to listen directly to the organizations communications using FRS radios. In 2010, Heartland REACT began streaming a feed of its GMRS repeater to the internet for the public listening via the Radio Reference website, and several mobile phone applications. Though the repeater was later upgraded and replaced in the late 1970s, the frequency was never changed and was in use until March 2011 when it was repurposed as an amateur <b>radio</b> <b>repeater.</b>|$|R
50|$|Communications for Operation Jump Start was by VHF {{repeated}} radio {{similar to}} that of law enforcement agencies. Due to the lack of repeater towers and secure lines of communication the VHF radios were supplemented by long haul satellite radio. The <b>radio</b> equipment (<b>mobile,</b> land <b>mobile</b> <b>radio,</b> and Quantar <b>repeaters</b> were switched to an all digital with over the air rekeying and encryption) was updated from 2007-2008 for extended reach-back capability. The repeater tower team (part of Task-Force Diamondback) was a specialized group of National Guard members who had to undergo training and certifications in tower climbing, combat life saving, and welding. Some of the towers were remote enough that the crew and equipment had to be flown in UH-60 helicopters.|$|R
50|$|To avoid {{interference}} {{within the}} equipment at the station, the two frequencies used {{need to be}} separated, and ideally on different 'bands'. An unattended station working {{in this way is}} a <b>radio</b> <b>repeater.</b> It re-transmits the same information that it receives. This principle is used by telecommunications satellites and terrestrial <b>mobile</b> <b>radio</b> systems.|$|R
50|$|A <b>radio</b> <b>repeater</b> is a {{combination}} of a radio receiver and a radio transmitter that receives a signal and retransmits it, so that two-way radio signals can cover longer distances. A repeater sited at a high elevation can allow two mobile stations, otherwise out of line-of-sight propagation range of each other, to communicate. Repeaters are found in professional, commercial, and government <b>mobile</b> <b>radio</b> systems and also in amateur radio.|$|R

5000|$|An amateur <b>radio</b> <b>repeater</b> is an {{electronic}} device that receives a weak or low-level amateur radio signal and retransmits it {{at a higher}} level or higher power, so that the signal can cover longer distances without degradation. Many repeaters are located on hilltops or on tall buildings as the higher location increases their coverage area, sometimes referred to as the radio horizon, or [...] "footprint". Amateur <b>radio</b> <b>repeaters</b> are similar in concept to those used by public safety entities (police, fire department, etc.), businesses, government, military, and more. Amateur <b>radio</b> <b>repeaters</b> may even use commercially packaged repeater systems that have been adjusted to operate within amateur radio frequency bands, but more often amateur repeaters are assembled from receivers, transmitters, controllers, power supplies, antennas, and other components, from various sources.|$|R
40|$|In complex {{communication}} channel environments the radio-link coverage at microwave frequencies is mainly restricted by the exorbitant path-loss between communication nodes due to non-line-of-sight propagation and multi-path communication. <b>Radio</b> <b>repeaters</b> {{are commonly used}} to enhance the signal coverage, but the current systems are bulky and power hungry as the received signal is down-converted, amplified and retransmitted at a different frequency. This thesis deals with development of a low-power subwavelength <b>radio</b> <b>repeater</b> that can handle multiple channels simultaneously without requiring a specific communication protocol. First, a metamaterial-based electromagnetic band-gap isolator is introduced, which prohibits substrate mode propagation between two low-profile miniaturized antennas. This isolator achieves 24 dB of isolation improvement between the transmit and receive antennas that are a quarter-wavelength apart and allows for 32 dB of active amplifier gain between the antennas. Also using a novel near-field cancellation technique an electromagnetic null-plane between two antennas of a transmit array is created, which reduces the mutual coupling by - 86 dB. This <b>radio</b> <b>repeater</b> can achieve more than 50 dB of active amplification. Lastly, a dual-channel <b>radio</b> <b>repeater</b> with a radar cross section of more than 26 dBsm for both channels is developed...|$|R

[...] While the tower is still , it has been abandoned and is no longer safe to climb. In June 2010, the U.S. Forest Service planned to remove the tower as part of a project to construct a <b>radio</b> <b>repeater</b> on Barton Knob. The <b>radio</b> <b>repeater</b> was installed by May 2012 adjacent to the tower, which was not removed.|$|R
