40|$|This issue paper, titled 'Revisiting Regional Trade Agreements and Their Impact on Services Trade' {{written by}} <b>Mr.</b> <b>Mario</b> Marconini, is a {{contribution}} to that process. The paper exhaustively reviews services disciplines included in several Free Trade Agreements (FTA). The aim of the paper is to enable stakeholders to understand how rules and commitments regarding trade in services have been introduced in FTAs, and how those policies might impact sustainable development in developing countries. The paper starts by examining the main models used for agreements on services disciplines, namely the approaches deployed by the North American Free Trade Agreements (NAFTA), the WTO General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) and the EU in form of the Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs). Unlike already existing research, this analysis goes beyond {{a discussion of the}} different mechanisms for liberalization (i. e. the negative and positive approach) thus introducing new groundbreaking research on services provisions in FTAs. With reference to the 3 models for services disciplines, the paper continues with an in depth analysis of different provisions contained in the services chapters. Among others, the analysis addresses scope and coverage, Non-discrimination, market access, domestic regulation, mutual recognition and cooperation [...] ...|$|R

Istraživanja su provedena u okviru znanstvenog projekta HAZU, pod naslovom: Prethistorijska i antička naselja na sjevernom Jadranu. Projekt objedinjuje akademik A. Mohorovičić. a znanstveno-istraživački rad vodi dr Aleksandra Faber. U projektu, kao i terenskom istraživanju sudjelovali su dr. Claudia Chang sa Sweet Briar Collegea u Americi i dr. Perry A. Tourtellotte. Težište ovom radu je u analizi tradicijskog načina uzgoja ovaca na području Drage Baščanske. Premda je na Krku turizam vrlo razvijen te predstavlja glavnu granu privređivanja, paralelno uz njega egzistira jedan manje vidljiv način života a laj je uzgoj ovaca.

50|$|Akobo massacreIn 1983, {{in broad}} day light, {{in the very}} eye of the Government, the army and {{organized}} forces brutally massacred the Anywaa people in hundreds. Men, women, and children were killed indiscriminately. Children were ushered into the huts and set ablaze. Others were shot or speared to death. Others were hacked with pangas or stabbed with knives. Prominent Lou Nuer (MOR) officials were assigned the Task of executing the plan with support of the Nuer policemen, prison, and game warders, to direct and supervise the massacre. Look at how ruthlessly the Nuer can kill the nephews and neighbors including uncles of their children in cold blood. It was a disregard of the bond of intermarriages. The commissioner of Jonglei Province, <b>Mr.</b> Michael <b>Mario</b> (Nuer), pretended to rescue the situation by taking the survivors of Anywaa from Akobo town, including teachers and other government officials to Pibor town instead of controlling the situation. Actually, it {{was an attempt to}} vacate Akobo for the Nuer and to accelerate the occupation of the Ciro lands without the Anywaa intellectuals seeing what was taking place. The proper way was to bring the killers to justice or take them away to Lou if it was not a plan. The then South Sudan government did nothing. The influential Lou politicians were there. They were the ones who masterminded the whole thing in the first place. Akobo town completely remained without any single Anywaa except for those in far away villages hiding from the government killers.|$|R
50|$|At lunch {{the next}} day they all three sat and conversed until Peter began to cough and grow pale. Peter decided to stay in and rest next to a fire while Mario showed Oliver the sights. They decided to walk and talk rather than see the sights. Peter was {{dreading}} the walk down Castle Hill, but he didn't want to disappoint Mario so he decided he would dose himself with medicine before the trip. When the boys returned they got a visit from <b>Mr</b> Rawdon Smith, <b>Mario's</b> schoolmaster. They spoke of a multitude of things, but the most important topic was of Mario's staying at Eton. Mario wanted to stay there so he could see his mother on the holidays. As Mr Rawdon Smith continued to speak Peter slipped into a limp slumber in the arm chair, with his eyes closed. Mr Rawdon Smith went to shake him until he encountered Oliver's deliberately rough arm-nudge. Oliver knew that Peter had a chill and must have medicated himself with a sedative, and he also knew that the sedative had taken him over. Oliver coaxed Peter into assisting in moving him to the cab and the three of them went to a see a doctor that Mario knew.|$|R
40|$|Three {{main reasons}} {{convinced}} {{me of the}} need to write this book, and I am glad that my colleagues on the Attard Local Council were of the same mind and entrusted me with the task. My first immersion into Attard's history was provoked by the mistaken exclusion ofSant'Anton, the palace and gardens, from its historic confines, when local council boundaries were first drawn out by the central government authorities. That offended every acclimatised resident of Attard, as well as my own childhood memories, when going to Attard from Floriana meant a frolic and a picnic, feeding the swans and watching monkey acrobatics. Another hiccup had been the exclusion of a red quadrant from Attard's traditional coat-of-arms by a heraldic expert not conversant with the simmering strengths of local history. Both these inadvertant errors were later rectified, but not before or without a sustained engagement in battle, armed by the pen of course, not the sword. Another instigation to get started on at least a modest pioneering work of this kind came from the constant quizzing I was having to put up with about Attard from several new colleagues and friends at the Council of Europe as well as professional contacts I was beginning to make in other countries when on mission. Having headed Malta's Delegation to the Strasbourg-based Congress of Local and Regional Authorities of Europe since its inception in 1994, I became much involved in this sphere of activity nationally and internationally. But what the Council of Europe always recognises and emphasises above all is the local provenance and the electoral base of members of the European Congress. In participation lists, speeches and reports I therefore invariably carried behind me, like a tail, the tag: "Mayor of Attard". Those who hardly knew where Malta was knew still less about Attard, but even among those who had come to Malta they would mostly remember the seaside tourist resorts or the casino, Valletta or perhaps Mdina, rather than a place like Attard, unless they happened to have stayed at the Corinthia Palace Hotel or been stopped by their tour coach at Sant'Anton for a walk-about in the gardens. Almost without exception, there was never a profile of the place or its inhabitants in their memories of Malta. While I was often presented with books or booklets by other Mayors or Councillors about their respective municipalities, I was never in a position to reciprocate such a gesture, nor of course could any of my Council colleagues if faced by a similar situation. The third and perhaps gravest reason for this little book however was the difficulty which many residents have had to identify the areas which made up Attard or to know where many of the streets themselves were located or what they were called. Often enough, for example, they would be unaware of the different areas that made up the place, and altogether unfamiliar with the names of the streets. Naturally my own work commitment {{in the context of the}} Local Council was itself an enriching experience on a human, operational and indeed an historical level. I too was on a learning curve, so I felt increasingly obliged and propelled to share that growth with fellow residents and citizens, but also to help Attard get out of its shell and be better known and appreciated, as it well deserved to be. In compiling data for this book I have relied on the generous assistance of so many people, mostly Attard residents. Too many to mention here, but I must at least list alphabetically all those who have kindly agreed to submit written notes, articles or pamphlets, or respond to queries of one kind or another. These have included, among others, Ms Joyce Abela, Mr. Edward Agius, Mr. Franco Azzopardi, Mr. Nicholas Azzopardi, Fra Andrew Bertie, Mr. Roger Vella Bonavita, Or. Giovanni Bonello, Mr. Lino Bonnici, Mr. Joe Borg, Ms Mary Ooris Borg, Mr. Norman Borg, Or. Mario Buhagiar, Ms. Maria Carmela Camilleri, Mr. Charlie Camilleri, Or. Paul Cassar, Prof. J.

I am most grateful to all the elected members of the Attard Local Council for their support, and for agreeing that the Council pay the printing costs. I am specifically grateful, for their local knowledge and contacts, to the Deputy Mayor, Mr. Gerald Borg, and to Councillor Joseph Mifsud, both of whom were born and raised in Attard. In thanking all the Council's members of staff I must reserve a special thank you for another 'native child of the village', our clerk Ms Marica Mifsud, who also typed in many additions and corrections to my draft texts. I am much indebted to the members of the Editorial Board for their technical advice and constant encouragement, especially Mr. Lionel Cassola, Ms Tanya Muscat and Ms Christine Vella Borda who also did the setting, while the first of these also took most of the photographs appearing here. Others were taken by the photographers Mr. Tony Mangion and Mr. Gino Galea as well as by Mr. Joseph Stellini from the office, and myself. Finally I wish heartily to thank all those officials of Artard's constituted bodies and their assistants who responded to the call for lists of their respective club presidents so that these could be included as appendices in a comprehensive manner between two covers for the first time.
