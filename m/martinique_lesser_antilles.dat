40|$|The {{overall size}} {{structure}} of catches was {{studied in the}} multispecific, multigear, demersal fishery of <b>Martinique</b> (<b>Lesser</b> <b>Antilles).</b> The {{results show that the}} fishery is presently based not only on small-sized species, but also on small- or medium-sized individuals of these species. Most of the catch is made up of species able to withstand its selectivity and effort, with larger species having been eliminated through overfishing. An exponential decrease of lenght frequencies for aggregated catches or samples was observed in the 2 years sampled, and could be due to some inherent size structure of the fish community. Such integrated analyses are useful complements to single-species assessment approaches inadequate to describe the dynamics of highly multispecific resources such as reef fish communities.

40|$|Piston cores {{collected}} from IODP drilling platforms (and its predecessors) {{provide the best}} long-term geological and climatic record of marine sediments worldwide. Coring disturbances affecting the original sediment texture have been recognized {{since the early days}} of coring, and include deformation resulting from shear of sediment against the core barrel, basal flow-in due to partial stroke, loss of stratigraphy, fall-in, sediment loss through core catchers, and structures formed during core recovery and on-deck transport. The most severe disturbances occur in non-cohesive (sandy) facies, which are particularly common in volcanogenic environments and submarine fans. Although all of these types of coring disturbances have been recognized previously, our contribution is novel because it provides an easily accessible summary of methods for their identification. This contribution gives two specific examples on the importance of these coring disturbances. We show how suck-in of sediments during coring artificially created very thick volcaniclastic sand layers in cores offshore Montserrat and <b>Martinique</b> (<b>Lesser</b> <b>Antilles).</b> We then analyze very thick, structureless sand layers from the Escanaba Trough inferred to be a record of the Missoula mega-floods. These sand layers tend to coincide with the base of core sections, and their facies suggest coring disturbance by basal flow-in, destroying the original structure and texture of the beds.

40|$|Sea cruises were {{conducted}} for 57 days over 16 months to characterise pelagic fish aggregations around two moored fish aggregating devices (FADs) in <b>Martinique</b> (<b>Lesser</b> <b>Antilles).</b> Echosounder surveys {{run in a}} star pattern were {{used in conjunction with}} obliquely beamed sonar observations. An echo-integration-by-shoal algorithm was implemented to isolate pelagic fish shoals from sound scattering layers and to compute mean morphometric, positional and density parameters. Tree regressions were used to select and classify pelagic fish target strengths (TS), with reference to their spatial and temporal characteristics. The main type of pelagic fish aggregation was a large sub-surface aggregation. It was observed during all daytime periods within a radius of 400 m of the FAD. A smaller type of aggregation was observed closer to the surface and to the FAD in 65 % of daytime periods. Large scattered fish were observed in 16 % of daytime periods. At night, a medium-sized aggregation was detected in the sub-surface in 75 % of night-time periods. The sizes of the fish inside the aggregations (determined from TS values) were lower in the small near-surface aggregation than in the large sub-surface aggregation. Mean packing densities of sub-surface medium fish and near-surface small fish aggregations (determined from TS and shoal acoustic density) were respectively 0. 2 and 1. 3 fish per m(3).

40|$|International audienceA horseshoe-shaped {{structure}} already {{identified on}} the southwestern flank of Montagne Pelée (<b>Martinique,</b> <b>Lesser</b> <b>Antilles</b> arc) was previously interpreted as resulting of a flank collapse event, but no debris avalanche deposits were observed at the time. New offshore high-resolution bathymetry and geophysical data (Aguadomar cruise; December 1998 to January 1999; R/V L'Atalante) {{lead us to}} identify three debris avalanche deposits on the submarine western flank of Montagne Pelée extending down to the Grenada Basin. They display morphological fronts and hummocky morphology on bathymetric data, speckled pattern on backscatter data and hyperbolic facies on 3. 5 kHz and seismic profiles. New on-land geological studies lead us to identify two other horseshoe-shaped structures on the same flank of the volcano. The three submarine deposits have been {{traced back to the}} structures identified on land, which confirms the occurrence of repeated flank collapse events during the evolution of Montagne Pelée. The ages of the last two events are estimated at ∼ 9 ka and ∼ 25 ka on the basis of 14 C and 238 U/ 230 Th dates. Every flank collapse produced debris avalanches which flowed down to the Caribbean Sea. We propose that the repeated instabilities are due to the large asymmetry of the island with western aerial and submarine slopes steeper than the eastern slopes. The asymmetry results from progressive loading by accumulation of volcanic products on the western slopes of the volcano and development of long-term gravitational instabilities. Meteoric and hydrothermal fluid circulation {{on the floor of the}} second flank collapse structure also creates a weakened hydrothermalized area, which favors the recurrence of flank collapses...|$|E

40|$|International audienceResistivity imaging {{is a key}} {{parameter}} in most {{geothermal exploration}} programs, and particularly in volcanic environment. It is assumed that resistivity variations allow imaging the caprock, but also hydrothermal weathering or preferential water flow. The geothermal fluid is generally brine water which drastically decreases the electrical resistivity and the temperature increase also decreases resistivity. The resistivity signatures for several conceptual geothermal reservoirs {{can be found in}} the literature. Magneto-telluric (MT) is generally used to image resistivity variations down-to a relevant investigation depth of several kilometers. Based on natural source signal, MT prospection efficiency depends on the Sun activity during the survey but moreover depends on the noise conditions. In many cases, because industrial activities have been developed close to the geothermal resource, the noise conditions make it difficult to obtain reliable MT tensors and hence a good resistivity image. Generally, the only way to counter is recording longer time series, to apply robust noise filtering and combining with a remote filtering. The noise issue in MT prospection is even more drastic in Island context. We investigated the substitution of controlled-source EM instead of MT measurements close to urbanized area. The distance constraints to respect the far field conditions are so challenging that they are often logistically not possible. Indeed, when it is possible to measure the receiver stations far enough from the source, the distortion due to the controlled-source disappear. But when the conditions for applying standard processing of CSAMT are not fulfilled, it is necessary to consider the source effect to interpret properly the EM response. We have studied and performed EM imaging in the near field, using a pair of pre-existing boreholes to inject high current into the ground through metallic casings. Based on numerical modeling, we propose a methodology to obtain maps and section of apparent resistivity. The results obtained were confronted to previous geophysical campaign results performed in the 1980 's and recent shallow prospection. This measuring protocol was applied to prospect the Lamentin area (<b>Martinique,</b> <b>Lesser</b> <b>Antilles,</b> France).

At least 15 species (5. 5 %) were probably accidentally introduced to the island by human activities.

Sixty seven species (24. 8 %) are shared only with other islands of the <b>Lesser</b> <b>Antilles</b> (<b>Lesser</b> Antillean endemics), and 26 species (9. 6 %) are more widespread Antilles endemics.

Based on natural source signal, the quality of broad band MT data depends on the source activity (lightning strikes and sun) during the survey but also on the local noise conditions. In many cases, because industrial activities have been developed close to the geothermal resource, the noise conditions make it difficult to obtain reliable MT tensors and therefore a good resistivity distribution.

40|$|The biogeographic {{patterns}} in sexually reproducing animals in island archipelagos {{may be interpreted}} as reflecting the importance of allopatric speciation. However, as the forms are allopatric, their reproductive isolation is largely untestable. A historical perspective integrating geology and molecular phylogeny reveals specific cases where ancient precursor islands coalesce, which allows the application of population genetics to critically test genetic isolation. The Anolis populations on <b>Martinique</b> in the <b>Lesser</b> <b>Antilles</b> are one such case where species-level populations on ancient precursor islands (ca 6 – 8  Myr BP) have met relatively recently. The distribution of the mtDNA lineages is tightly linked to the precursor island, but the population genetic analysis of microsatellite variation in large samples shows no evidence of restricted genetic exchange between these forms in secondary contact. This tests, and rejects, the hypothesis of simple allopatric speciation in these forms. By contrast, Martinique has pronounced environmental zonation, to which anoles are known to adapt.

These islands are constituted of very porous pyroclastic deposits, andesitic or basaltic lava flows, allowing significant water infiltration. From hydrological budgets, we estimate that infiltration represents 10 % in Guadeloupe and 40 % in Martinique. Element fluxes transported by subsurface water to the ocean have been quantified by coupling the hydrological budget with the chemical composition of the sampled subsurface waters. This is the first estimate of chemical weathering rates from volcanic islands, which {{takes into account the}} high temperature weathering contribution to the chemical weathering rates. Subsurface waters are impacted by high-temperature water–rock interactions and present therefore higher concentrations (4 to 100 times) of major and trace elements compare to surface waters, representing thus respectively 90 %, 60 % and 75 % of the total (surface + subsurface) weathering dissolved flux to the ocean for Martinique, Guadeloupe and Reunion. This shows the importance of these fluxes, which until now were not estimated in the basalt weathering geochemical budgets. Chemical weathering rates from subsurface water are 2 to 5 time higher than the rates from surface waters. The total average chemical rates calculated are 290 t/km 2 /yr in Guadeloupe, 1080 t/km 2 /yr in Martinique and 270 t/km 2 /yr in Réunion. These values are among the highest worldwide. Extrapolating this budget to the surface of all volcanic islands world-wide, we estimate that these could contribute between 23 % and 31 % of the global flux of dissolved load transported to the oceans by major rivers draining silicate rocks whereas their surface area represent only 9 % of the silicate rock total surface are...|$|R

Ordered by neutral Portugal in {{accordance}} with international law to leave São Vicente within 24 hours of the declaration of war, Plutón {{and the rest of}} Cervera's squadron departed on 29 April 1898, bound for San Juan, Puerto Rico. Because of continuing engine trouble and low coal supplies, Plutón and her fellow destroyers were towed part of the way. Cervera's ships reached French-owned <b>Martinique</b> in the <b>Lesser</b> <b>Antilles</b> on 10 May 1898. While Plutón and the armored cruisers loitered in international waters, Furor and Terror went into Fort-de-France to ask for coal. France was neutral and would not supply coal, so the Spanish squadron—minus Terror, which stayed behind at Fort-de-France with engine trouble—departed on 12 May 1898 for Dutch-owned Curaçao, where Cervera expected to meet a collier. Cervera arrived at Willemstad on 14 May, but the Netherlands also was neutral, and strictly enforced its neutrality by allowing only Vizcaya and Infanta Maria Teresa to enter port and permitting them to load only 600 tons of coal. On 15 May, Cervera's ships departed, no longer bound for San Juan, which by now was under a U.S. Navy blockade, but for as-yet unblockaded Santiago de Cuba on the southeastern coast of Cuba, arriving there on 19 May 1898. Cervera hoped to refit his ships there before he could be trapped. His squadron was still in the harbor of Santiago de Cuba when an American squadron arrived on 27 May 1898 and began a blockade which would drag on for 37 days.|$|R
