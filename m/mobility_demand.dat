40|$|Increasing {{vehicular}} {{travel and}} environmental issues are trends increasing the pressure on urban transport systems. The new concept Mobility as a Service (MaaS) is one approach to tackle these challenges. The aim of MaaS {{is to reduce the}} need of the private car and increase the use of shared resources by providing one single application that integrates all transport modes, payment, and services. Several ongoing societal trends such as urbanization, technologic development, and sharing economy are examples of reasons for the emergence of MaaS. Young people are often leading the development and are early adopters of new technologies. The <b>mobility</b> <b>demands</b> of young people today and in the future will therefore {{play an important role in}} the implementations of MaaS. This qualitative study uses focus groups to explore <b>mobility</b> <b>demands</b> today and in the envisioned future of young people (aged 15 - 23) living in Stockholm. Our understanding of travel behaviour and <b>mobility</b> <b>demands</b> among young people is limited, and this study also aims to get deeper understanding of the underlying values and attitudes towards mobility that influence those demands and behaviours. This study aims to answer how young people’s <b>mobility</b> <b>demands</b> look like and if they correspond to the visions of MaaS as stated by developers and experts of the concept. Findings indicate that <b>mobility</b> <b>demands</b> and behaviour are strongly influenced by parents, and underlying values such as ‘Freedom’ and ‘Comfortable life’ affect mobility more than factors such as availability and travel time. There is little need for increased accessibility to transport today and in the envisioned future. Findings also indicate a relatively widespread environmental awareness, but an unwillingness to convert awareness to change of behaviour. The demands of young people correspond to some extent with the visions of MaaS, and the probability of young people to adopt MaaS and to choose environmentally friendly journey is high if demands for convenience and comfort are fulfilled...|$|R

In this paper, we enhance the capability of a MoD system by deploying robotic shared vehicles that can autonomously cruise the streets to be hailed by users.

This paper presents a novel decentralized data fusion and active sensing algorithm for realtime, fine-grained <b>mobility</b> <b>demand</b> sensing and prediction with a fleet of autonomous robotic vehicles in a MoD system. Our Gaussian process (GP) -based decentralized data fusion algorithm can achieve a fine balance between predictive power and time efficiency.

Usage scenarios prpopsed by <b>Mobility</b> on <b>Demand</b> systems must allow one-way rentals. However, one-way rentals bring significant challenges to fleet management because areas of high demand will tend to lose their inventory, whereas areas of low demand will tend to accumulate inventory. Dynamic incentives can be provided to encourage different usage patterns and alleviate the problem of demand asymmetry.

40|$|Energy used in {{transport}} is {{a particularly}} important focus for environment-development studies because it is increasing in both developed and developing countries and is largely carbon-intensive. This paper examines whether a systemic, mutually causal, cointegrated relationship exists among <b>mobility</b> <b>demand,</b> gasoline price, income, and vehicle ownership using US data from 1946 to 2006. We find that those variables co-evolve in a transport system; and thus, they cannot be easily disentangled in the short-run. However, estimating a long-run relationship for motor fuel use per capita was difficult because of {{the efficacy of the}} CAFE standards to influence fleet fuel economy. The analysis shows that the fuel standards program was effective in improving the fuel economy of the US vehicle fleet and in temporarily lessening the impact on fuel use of increased <b>mobility</b> <b>demand.</b> Among the policy implications are a role for efficiency standards, a limited impact for fuel tax, and the necessity of using a number of levers simultaneously to influence transport systems. ...|$|E

The Ile-de-France region centered on Paris has thus set the ambitious objective of 1 million electrified vehicles by 2030. The objective of this study is hence to investigate the technical and economic interaction between mobility needs and the electricity network for the Paris-Ile-de-France region. The central element discussed is the load curve impact of a large fleet of vehicle.

It is constrained by contextual elements such as batteries capacity limits, energy requirement to satisfy the <b>mobility</b> <b>demand,</b> charging infrastructure and preferences in charging behavior.
