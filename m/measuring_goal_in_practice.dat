50|$|As {{in regular}} logic programming, {{programs}} are queried about the provability of a goal, which may contain constraints {{in addition to}} literals. A proof for a goal is composed of clauses whose bodies are satisfiable constraints and literals that can in turn be proved using other clauses. Execution is performed by an interpreter, which starts from the goal and recursively scans the clauses trying to prove the goal. Constraints encountered during this scan are placed in a set called constraint store. If this set is found out to be unsatisfiable, the interpreter backtracks, trying to use other clauses for proving the <b>goal.</b> <b>In</b> <b>practice,</b> satisfiability of the constraint store may be checked using an incomplete algorithm, which does not always detect inconsistency.|$|R

Modeling and verification is achieved using the model checking tool PRISM. Based on the results, general specifications for modeling business processes using a probabilistic model checker are identified. Also, the difference between declarative and procedural business process modeling approaches is discussed. We propose to combine declarative and procedural techniques, thereby gaining increased expressiveness in modeling business processes, but still maintain verification feasibl...|$|R

However, surprisingly, {{there have been few}} theoretical or empirical results on optimal software pipelining of loops with control flows. In this paper, we present three new contributions for this under-investigated problem. First, we propose a necessary and sufficient condition for a loop with control flows to have an optimally software-pipelined program. We also present a decision procedure to compute the condition. Second, we present two software pipelining algorithms. The first algorithm computes an optimal solution for every loop satisfying the condition, but may run in exponential time. The second algorithm computes optimal solutions efficiently for most (but not all) loops satisfying the condition. Third, we present experimental results which strongly indicate that achieving the optimality in the software-pipelined programs is a viable <b>goal</b> <b>in</b> <b>practice</b> with realistic hardware support...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. For a genomic region {{containing}} a tandem gene cluster, a proper set of alignments needs to align only orthologous segments, i. e., those {{separated by a}} speciation event. Otherwise, methods for finding regions under evolutionary selection will not perform properly. Conversely, the alignments should indicate every orthologous pair of genes or genomic segments. Attaining this <b>goal</b> <b>in</b> <b>practice</b> requires a technique for avoiding a combinatorial explosion {{in the number of}} local alignments. To better understand this process, we model it as a graph problem of finding a minimum cardinality set of cliques that contain all edges. We provide an upper bound for an important class of graphs (the problem is NP-hard and very difficult to approximate in the general case), and use the bound and computer simulations to evaluate two heuristic solutions. An implementation of one of them is evaluated on mammalian sequences from the α-globin gene cluster. ...|$|R

METHODS: We studied 661 ambulatory adults with TG concentrations 3 ̆c or = 4. 52 mmol/l and no overt CAD. Fasting venous lipid panels were obtained.
