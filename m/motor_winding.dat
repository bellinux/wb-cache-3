50|$|LIMs provide {{traction}} through {{the interaction of}} magnetic fields generated on the vehicle and a fixed external conductor. The external conductor was normally made of plates of aluminium, chosen due to its high conductivity in relation to its price. The active portion of the motor consists of a conventional electric <b>motor</b> <b>winding</b> stretched out under the vehicle. When the motor windings are energised, an opposing magnetic field is induced in the nearby reaction plate, which causes the two to repel each other. By moving the fields down the windings, the motor pushes itself along the plate with the same force that is normally used to create rotation in a conventional motor. A LIM {{eliminates the need for}} strong physical contact with the track, requiring instead a strong reaction plate. It has no moving parts, a major advantage over conventional traction.|$|E
50|$|The stator of an {{induction}} motor consists of poles carrying supply current to induce {{a magnetic field}} that penetrates the rotor. To optimize {{the distribution of the}} magnetic field, windings are distributed in slots around the stator, with the magnetic field having the same number of north and south poles. Induction motors are most commonly run on single-phase or three-phase power, but two-phase motors exist; in theory, {{induction motor}}s can have any number of phases. Many single-phase motors having two windings can be viewed as two-phase motors, since a capacitor is used to generate a second power phase 90Â° from the single-phase supply and feeds it to the second <b>motor</b> <b>winding.</b> Single-phase motors require some mechanism to produce a rotating field on startup. Cage induction motor rotor's conductor bars are typically skewed to avoid magnetic locking.|$|E

50|$|Many {{strategies}} {{exist for}} safety in electrical installations. The simplest {{strategy is to}} minimize the amount of electrical equipment installed in a hazardous area, either by keeping the equipment {{out of the area}} altogether or by making the area less hazardous by process improvements or ventilation with clean air. Intrinsic safety, or non-incendive equipment and wiring methods, is a set of practices for apparatus designed with low power levels and low stored energy. Insufficient energy is available to produce an arc that can ignite the surrounding explosive mixture. Equipment enclosures can be pressurized with clean air or inert gas and designed with various controls to remove power or provide notification in case of supply or pressure loss of such gases. Arc-producing elements of the equipment can also be isolated from the surrounding atmosphere by encapsulation, immersion in oil, sand, etc. Heat producing elements such as <b>motor</b> <b>winding,</b> electrical heaters, including heat tracing and lighting fixtures are often designed to limit their maximum temperature below the autoignition temperature of the material involved. Both external and internal temperatures are taken into consideration.|$|E
50|$|The {{forward path}} begins with Î¸C, the desired {{position}} command. This is multiplied by KP {{which could be}} a constant or a function of frequency. KP incorporates the conversion gain of the DAC and any filtering on the DAC output. The output of KP is the velocity command VÏC which is multiplied by KV {{which can be a}} constant or a function of frequency. The output of KV is the current command, VIC which is multiplied by KC which can be a constant or a function of frequency. The output of KC is the amplifier output voltage, VA. The current, IM, though the <b>motor</b> <b>winding</b> is the integral of the voltage applied to the inductance. The motor produces a torque, T, proportional to IM. Permanent magnet motors tend to have a linear current to torque function. The conversion constant of current to torque is KM. The torque, T, divided by the load moment of inertia, M, is the acceleration, Î±, which is integrated to give the load velocity Ï which is integrated to produce the load position, Î¸LC.|$|E

5000|$|Ford {{issued a}} nonstandard starter, a {{direct-drive}} [...] "movable pole shoe" [...] design that provided cost reduction rather than electrical or mechanical benefits. This type of starter eliminated the solenoid, {{replacing it with}} a movable pole shoe and a separate starter relay. This starter operates as follows: The driver turns the key, activating the starter switch. A small electric current flows through the solenoid actuated starter relay, closing the contacts and sending large battery current to the starter motor. One of the pole shoes, hinged at the front, linked to the starter drive, and spring-loaded away from its normal operating position, is swung into position by the magnetic field created by electricity flowing through its field coil. This moves the starter drive forward to engage the flywheel ring gear, and simultaneously closes a pair of contacts supplying current {{to the rest of the}} starter <b>motor</b> <b>winding.</b> Once the engine starts and the driver releases the starter switch, a spring retracts the pole shoe, which pulls the starter drive out of engagement with the ring gear.|$|E
40|$|Abstract- Short circuit {{located at}} <b>motor</b> <b>winding</b> {{is one of}} the most {{frequent}} faults in induction motors. The fault does not often occur suddenly but gradually from small current and temporary short circuit to the higher ones. Early detection of such fault is very important to avoid severe damages. This paper presents the wavelet transform analysis for detection the temporary faults in induction <b>motor</b> <b>winding.</b> The proposed method is recognized more efficient to identify the very short duration and non periodic faults at <b>motor</b> <b>winding</b> than other metering and protection systems. The identification variable of this method is taken from the energy and magnitude of high frequency signal from the wavelet transform. To reach the objective, a single phase induction motor is used for the experiment where 20 cases of fault location and fault resistance are selected to be the input variables. The experimental results show that the majority of short circuit conditions can be satisfactorily identified using this method Index Terms- Temporary short circuit, wavelet transform, induction <b>motor</b> <b>winding.</b> I...|$|E
40|$|AbstractFuzzy {{systems have}} been used {{extensively}} and successfully in control systems {{over the past few}} decades, but have been applied much less often to filtering problems. This is somewhat surprising in view of the dual relationship between control and estimation. This paper discusses and demonstrates the application of fuzzy filtering to <b>motor</b> <b>winding</b> current estimation in permanent magnet synchronous motors. <b>Motor</b> <b>winding</b> current estimation is an important problem because in order to implement effective closed-loop control, a good estimation of the current is needed. <b>Motor</b> <b>winding</b> currents are notoriously noisy because of electrical noise in the motor drive. We use a fuzzy system with correlation-product inference and centroid defuzzification for <b>motor</b> <b>winding</b> current estimation. With the assumption that the membership functions are triangular (but not necessarily symmetric), we then optimize the membership functions using gradient descent. Next we use singular value decomposition to reduce the rule base for the fuzzy filter. Rule base reduction can be important for fuzzy systems in those cases where the fuzzy system needs to be implemented in real time. This is especially true with regard to fuzzy filtering in a real time motor controller. The methods discussed in this paper are demonstrated on real <b>motor</b> <b>winding</b> currents that were collected with a digital oscilloscope. It is demonstrated that fuzzy techniques provide a feasible approach to motor current estimation, that gradient descent optimization improves the performance of the filter, and that rule base reduction results in a relatively small degradation of filter performance...|$|E

40|$|A {{brief history}} of {{conductive}} <b>motor</b> <b>winding</b> materials is presented, comparing various metal <b>motor</b> <b>winding</b> materials and their properties in terms of conductivity, density and cost. The proposed use of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and composites incorporating CNTs is explored as a potential way to improve <b>motor</b> <b>winding</b> conductivity, density, and reduce motor size which are important to electric aircraft technology. The conductivity of pure Cu, a CNT yarn, and a dilute Cu-CNT composite was measured at room temperature and at several temperatures up to 340 C. The conductivity of the Cu-CNT composite was about 3 percent lower than pure copper's at all temperatures measured. The conductivity of the CNT yarn was about 200 times lower than copper's, however, the yarn's conductivity dropped less with increasing temperature compared to Cu. It is believed that the low conductivity of the yarn is due primarily to high interfacial resistances {{and the presence of}} CNTs with low, semiconductor like electrical properties (s-CNT). It is believed the conductivity of the CNT-Cu composite could be improved by not using s-CNT, and instead using only CNTs with high, metallic like electrical properties (m-CNT); and by increasing the vol% m-CNTs...|$|E
