5|$|The Sulu bleeding-heart {{is easily}} {{distinguished}} from most terrestrial doves found on Tawi-Tawi. The emerald dove {{is most likely}} {{to be confused with the}} bleeding-heart, but the emerald dove is distinguished by a larger and whiter shoulder patch, a white supercilium, and dark chestnut underparts. Two bleeding-hearts are kept as pets and may escape on Tawi-Tawi; the Sulu bleeding-heart differs from the Luzon bleeding-heart by not having the Luzon bleeding-heart's purple nape and back, and from the <b>Mindanao</b> <b>bleeding-heart</b> by lacking prominent gray wing-bars and an orange belly.|$|E
5|$|The Sulu bleeding-heart was {{originally}} described in 1894 as Phlogoenas menagei by Frank Swift Bourns and Dean Conant Worcester. The holotype, a male, was collected by {{them from the}} small island of Tataan {{off the coast of}} Tawi-Tawi in October 1891. The specific name, menagei, honors Louis F. Menage, a Minnesota real estate tycoon who funded the expedition. It {{is a member of the}} bleeding-heart superspecies, which includes Luzon bleeding-heart, <b>Mindanao</b> <b>bleeding-heart,</b> Mindoro bleeding-heart, and Negros bleeding-heart; these birds are so similar that some authors have considered them to be a single species. Some authors place the Sulu bleeding-heart, the other bleeding-hearts, and the cinnamon ground dove in their own subgenus, Gallicolumba. The Sulu bleeding-heart has no known subspecies. It is also called the Tawitawi bleeding-heart and the Tawitawi Puñalada.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Mindanao</b> <b>bleeding-heart</b> exists (or used to exist) on the Philippine Islands of Samar, Leyte, Basilan, Mindanao, Bohol, and Dinagat. It {{is one of}} {{the three}} bleeding-heart doves that are native to their own {{particular}} island or islands of the Philippines. It naturally occurs in both primary and secondary tropical lowland rainforests up to an elevation of 750 m.|$|E
25|$|Dragons in Danger also houses various Indonesian and Philippine {{rainforest}} birds, such as Palawan peacock-pheasants, pheasant pigeons, Montserrat orioles and Visayan tarictic hornbills. Recently added {{was a pair}} of Philippine mouse deer {{which have}} successfully bred. Also housed here are Ploughshare tortoises, collared iguanas and Montserrat Tarantulas which Chester bred in 2016 {{for the first time in}} captivity. Species formerly kept in the exhibit include Socorro doves, <b>Mindanao</b> <b>bleeding-hearts,</b> Papuan lorikeets and Saint Lucia parrots.|$|R
50|$|The Blackburn Pavilion is a rainforest-themed {{tropical}} bird aviary {{that opened}} in March 2008, as a refurishment of the zoo's out-of-date bird house. The building was originally constructed in 1883, as a reptile house. The pavilion houses fifty different species of exotic birds, including Socorro doves, <b>Mindanao</b> <b>bleeding-hearts,</b> scarlet ibis, toco toucans, splendid sunbirds, pied avocets and blue-winged kookaburras. Outside the entrance {{is one of the}} pavilion's prominent features, a large elaborate clock by Tim Hunkin. It gives a bird-themed display every thirty minutes throughout the day.|$|R
25|$|Aviaries and vivaria are {{arranged}} around {{the sides of}} the building; those on the upper level were originally designed for birds of paradise and the hornbill aviaries were originally made for gorillas. The aviaries currently house birds such as great Indian hornbills, rhinoceros hornbills, two pairs of tarictic hornbill (one pure-bred and one hybrid), writhed-billed hornbills, red-crested turacos, Palawan peacock-pheasants, Congo peafowl, Bali starlings, blue-crowned pigeons, fairy-bluebirds, white-rumped shama, white-crested turacos, snowy-crowned robin chats, <b>Mindanao</b> <b>bleeding-hearts</b> Green Aracari and Luzon Scops Owls. At the entrance is an aviary for Sumatran laughingthrushes and grey-winged blackbird.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Mindanao</b> <b>{{bleeding}}-heart</b> (Gallicolumba crinigera), {{also known}} as Bartlett's bleeding heart dove, Barlett's bleeding heart pigeon and the hair-breasted bleeding heart, is a species of bird in the pigeon family. It is endemic to the Philippines. It is so named because of a red blotch on its breast. The generic name derives from a fusion of the Latin gallus ("chicken") and columba ("pigeon").|$|E
50|$|The Pasonanca Natural Park {{provides}} a habitat to many threatened and restricted-range {{species of the}} Mindanao and Eastern Visayas Endemic Bird Area including the Zamboanga bulbul, <b>Mindanao</b> <b>bleeding-heart,</b> Philippine kingfisher, Philippine leafbird and little slaty flycatcher. It also supports the Philippine eagle, Mindanao broadbill, azure-breasted pitta, celestial monarch, southern silvery kingfisher, blue-capped kingfisher, spotted imperial pigeon, giant scops owl, Japanese night heron, Chinese egret, rufous-lored kingfisher, Philippine dwarf kingfisher and Philippine cockatoo.|$|E
50|$|The main {{threats to}} the <b>Mindanao</b> <b>bleeding-heart</b> are {{deforestation}} and overhunting for food and for the pet trade. The status of the species is not sufficiently known for a definite assessment. Initially listed as being of least concern in 1988, it was subsequently uplisted to vulnerable in 1994, and further to endangered in 2000. With its exact rate of decline still unresolved, it was downlisted to vulnerable in the 2007 IUCN Red List.|$|E
5|$|The Sulu bleeding-heart is {{considered}} to be critically endangered by the IUCN. The Sulu bleeding-heart has always been considered a rare bird, and only two specimens, both males, have ever been taken of the species. The specimens, collected in October 1891 on the small islet of Tataan, are the last time anyone has definitely seen the Sulu bleeding-heart alive. The bleeding-heart was searched for 22 days in December 1971 and briefly in September 1991 without success. Most of Tawi-Tawi's forests were cleared by August 1994, and the Sulu bleeding-heart may well be extirpated on the mainland. However, an ethnobiological survey in 1995 generated reports that the bleeding-heart survives and is regularly seen on the nearby islets of Tandubatu, Dundangan, and Baliungan. It was also reported that the species was quite common until the 1970s. Despite this, an expedition in 2009 failed to find any signs of the species or discover a new report of the species' continued existence. The islets it reportedly survives on may also be too small to support a viable population. Any surviving population of Sulu bleeding-hearts is likely to be small, possibly numbering fewer than 50 birds, and would be threatened by continued habitat destruction and uncontrolled hunting. As the <b>Mindanao</b> and Luzon <b>bleeding-hearts</b> are popular cagebirds, any bleeding-heart found on Tawi-Tawi could also be an escaped bleeding-heart instead of the indigenous Sulu bleeding-heart. There are no protected areas in the Sulu Archipelago, and other than two environmental education initiatives in the 1990s nothing has been done to protect any surviving population.|$|R
50|$|The Rajah Sikatuna Protected Landscape is an {{important}} bird area being home to over 120 bird species, {{many of which are}} endemic to the Philippines, which include the endangered streaked reed warbler and Philippine cockatoo, as well as the Philippine hawk-eagle, Visayan broadbill, Samar hornbill, <b>Mindanao</b> <b>bleeding-heart,</b> Philippine eagle-owl, Philippine oriole, Philippine frogmouth, azure-breasted pitta, rufous-tailed jungle flycatcher, rufous-lored kingfisher, southern silvery kingfisher, yellow-breasted tailorbird, yellow-bellied whistler, black-crowned babbler, Philippine hanging parrot, Philippine fairy-bluebird, Philippine trogon and Philippine leaf warbler.|$|E

50|$|The <b>Mindanao</b> <b>bleeding-heart</b> {{is about}} 29 cm {{in length and}} weighs 184-204 g. The forehead, crown, nape and mantle are {{metallic}} green, slightly duller on the forehead and sides of the head. The back to rump is a chocolate brown with fringes of green. The upper and central tail coverts are purplish brown, the chin and throat are white. Most striking is a blood red patch on the breast, hence the common name. The lower breast to the undertail is a rusty orange that is its darkest on the breast and flanks and palest on the belly. The underwing is chestnut brown and blackish on the edges. The wing shield is a dull brown with broad tips which make three distinct wing bars. The sexes are similar in appearance though {{there may be some}} dimorphism in iris colouration. Juveniles are dark chestnut or reddish brown with some metallic fringes on the mantle and scapular.|$|E
40|$|Oil {{palm trees}} {{have become the}} most {{expanding}} equatorial crops {{in the world and}} theirproduct, palm oil, is produced, traded and used more than any other vegetable oil worldwide. Theexpansion of oil palm cultivation, however, is frequently cited as a major factor causing deforestationthat may result in biodiversity losses in tropical countries. In this study, an assessment of the avifaunain oil palm plantations in Agusan del Sur and Compostela Valley, Mindanao, Philippines was done fromApril 2010 to July 2010. Sampling sites were categorized based on the age/growth of palm trees. Linetransect method, mist netting and birdwatching were used to gather data on avifauna. Eighty-eightspecies were recorded. Species richness, abundance, and number of endemic species were also recordedto be higher in mature plantations than in young plantations. A significant difference was noted in birdabundance found in the different age groups of oil palm plantations in Agusan del Sur. Thirty-oneendemic species were recorded, one of which is Mindanao endemic. Three vulnerable species, Gallicolumba criniger (<b>Mindanao</b> <b>bleeding-heart),</b> Alcedo argentata (silvery kingfisher) and Ficedulabasilanica (little slaty flycatcher) were recorded both in the young and mature plantations. The Aethopyga primigenius (grey-hooded sunbird), a near threatened species was recorded in matureplantations only. The presence of these vulnerable species in all study sites indicates the need to protectthe degraded secondary residual forest and forest patches along the plantation...|$|E
40|$|The type {{specimen}} of the <b>Mindanao</b> <b>Bleeding-heart</b> Gallicolumba crinigera was acquired on Jolo in the Sulu Archipelago, southern Philippines, but a presumption of biogeographic improbability {{led to the}} type locality being “corrected ” to Mindanao. Birds from Basilan, geographically interposed between Mindanao and Jolo, have been separated as G. c. bartletti chiefl y for their smaller size, but comparison {{with the type of}} crinigera is impossible owing to the latter’s lack of outer primaries and tail; in any case bartletti and Mindanao crinigera overlap strongly in size and differ in no diagnostic plumage feature so that bartletti is probably invalid. Given that a Gallicolumba was seen in the wild on Jolo in the nineteenth century, at least fi ve slightly different taxonomic arrangements are possible depending on viewpoint. Reversion of type locality to Jolo would be destabilising at this stage, but it is plausible that the type of crinigera did in fact derive from native birds on Jolo. Resolution of the issue might still be possible, as a local man recently reported that a bird resembling G. crinigera survives on the island. Gallicolumba crinigera in outline The erection of taxa based on small sample sizes, and the assignment of type locali-ties based on assumption, probability or even mere convenience, are sometimes neces-sary conditions of taxonomy, but inevitably occasionally create problems of interpreta...|$|E
