5|$|Four {{nonmetals}} are {{distinguished by}} polyatomic bonding in their standard states, in either discrete or extended molecular forms: carbon (C, as graphite sheets); phosphorus (as P4 molecules); sulfur (as S8 molecules); and selenium (Se, as helical chains). Consistent with their higher coordination numbers (2 or 3), the polyatomic nonmetals show more metallic character than the neighbouring diatomic nonmetals; {{they are all}} solid, mostly semi-lustrous semiconductors with electronegativity values that are intermediate to <b>moderately</b> <b>high</b> (2.19–2.58). Sulfur is the least metallic of the polyatomic nonmetals given its dull appearance, brittle comportment, and low conductivity—attributes common to all sulfur allotropes. It nevertheless shows some metallic character, either intrinsically or in its compounds with other nonmetals. Examples include the malleability of plastic sulfur and the lustrous-bronze appearance and metallic conductivity of polysulfur nitride (SNx).|$|E

25|$|Several low-albedo {{features}} {{are evident in}} Earth-based views of the Michelangelo quadrangle, but these features {{do not appear to}} correlate directly with any mapped terrain unit. Solitudo Promethei may correspond to a deposit of plains materials centered at –58°, 135°, and Solitudo Martis may correspond to similar materials at –30° to –40°, 90° to 100°. The color data (orange/ultraviolet) presented in Hapke and others (1980) likewise show no particular correlation with mapped terrain types. The “yellow” region (<b>moderately</b> <b>high</b> orange/ultraviolet) centered at –33°, 155° appears to correspond to a smooth plains deposit, but the region overlaps into adjacent cratered terrain.|$|E

25|$|The first Mosquito Squadron to be {{equipped}} with Oboe (navigation) was No. 109, based at RAF Wyton, after working as an experimental unit at RAF Boscombe Down. They used Oboe in anger {{for the first time}} on 31 December 1942/1 January 1943, target marking for a force of heavy bombers attacking Düsseldorf.. On the 1st. June, the two pioneering Squadrons joined 109 Squadron in the re-formed No. 8 Group RAF(Bomber Command). Initially they were engaged in <b>moderately</b> <b>high</b> level (about 10 000ft.) night bombing, with 67 trips during that summer, mainly to Berlin. Soon after, Nos. 105 and 139 Squadron bombers were widely used by the RAF Pathfinder Force, marking targets for the main night-time strategic bombing force.|$|E
25|$|Some {{studies have}} found the gains of the Flynn effect to be {{particularly}} concentrated {{at the lower end}} of the distribution. Teasdale and Owen (1989), for example, found the effect primarily reduced the number of low-end scores, resulting in an increased number of <b>moderately</b> <b>high</b> scores, with no increase in very high scores. In another study, two large samples of Spanish children were assessed with a 30-year gap. Comparison of the IQ distributions indicated that the mean IQ-scores on the test had increased by 9.7 points (the Flynn effect), the gains were concentrated in the lower half of the distribution and negligible in the top half, and the gains gradually decreased as the IQ of the individuals increased. Some {{studies have found}} a reverse Flynn effect with declining scores for those with high IQ.|$|E

25|$|Hawkins {{had told}} me aboard the ship that he would put his platoon of men up against any company of {{soldiers}} on earth and guarantee to win. He was slightly wounded by shrapnel as he came ashore in the first wave, but {{the furthest thing from}} his mind was to be evacuated. He led his platoon into the forest of coconut palms.

25|$|A 2007 study {{reported}} {{the impact of}} the antibiotic minocycline on clinical and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) outcomes and serum immune molecules in 40 MS patients over 24 months of open-label minocycline treatment. Despite a <b>moderately</b> <b>high</b> pretreatment relapse rate in the patient group prior to treatment (1.3/year pre-enrollment; 1.2/year during a three-month baseline period), no relapses occurred between months 6 and 24 on minocycline. Also, despite significant MRI disease-activity pretreatment (19/40 scans had gadolinium-enhancing activity during a three-month run-in), the only patient with gadolinium-enhancing lesions on MRI at 12 and 24 months was on half-dose minocycline. Levels of interleukin-12 (IL-12), which at high levels might antagonize the proinflammatory IL-12 receptor, were elevated over 18 months of treatment, as were levels of soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1). The activity of matrix metalloproteinase-9 was decreased by treatment. Clinical and MRI outcomes in this study were supported by systemic immunological changes and call for further investigation of minocycline in MS.|$|E
25|$|There {{is also a}} {{link between}} the hopping action and breathing: as the feet leave the ground, air is {{expelled}} from the lungs; bringing the feet forward ready for landing refills the lungs, providing further energy efficiency. Studies of kangaroos and wallabies have demonstrated, beyond the minimum energy expenditure required to hop at all, increased speed requires very little extra effort (much less than the same speed increase in, say, a horse, dog or human), and the extra energy is required to carry extra weight. For kangaroos, the key benefit of hopping is not speed to escape predators—the top speed of a kangaroo is no higher than that of a similarly sized quadruped, and the Australian native predators are in any case less fearsome than those of other countries—but economy: in an infertile country with highly variable weather patterns, the ability of a kangaroo to travel long distances at <b>moderately</b> <b>high</b> speed in search of food sources is crucial to survival.|$|E

40|$|This paper uses a new {{database}} {{to establish a}} key finding: high tariffs were associated with fast growth before World War II, while associated with slow growth thereafter. The paper offers some explanations for the sign switch by controlling for novel measures of the changing world economic environment. Rejecting alternative explanations based on changing export market growth or transportation cost declines, it shows how the oft-quoted Sachs-Warner result might be turned on its head in a world environment characterized by a <b>moderately</b> <b>higher</b> level of generalized tariff protection. We confirm the spirit of recent findings by Rodrik and Rodr¡guez that postwar tariffs need not be negatively correlated with growth in an unconditional fashion. Just a 4 % increase in average tariff rates among trading partners might suffice to reverse any negative relationship between an average country's tariffs and its growth. An increase in own tariffs after 1970 hurt or at least didn't help growth, {{but it would have}} helped growth in a world where average trading partners' tariffs were <b>moderately</b> <b>higher.</b> The world environment matters.
