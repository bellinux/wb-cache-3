5|$|For {{her fifth}} patrol, U-38 would again depart from Wilhelmshaven with Heinrich Liebe in command on 6 June 1940. She was {{to patrol the}} waters off {{southern}} Ireland. During this operation, Liebe would hit six ships, two of which were sailing in convoy at the time. On 14 June, U-38 sank the Greek steam freighter SS Mount Myrto. The next day, U-38 sank two ships, both sailing as part of Convoy HX-47, sailing from Halifax to England. First sunk was the Canadian steam freighter SS Erik Boye, followed by the Norwegian <b>motor</b> <b>tanker</b> MV Italia. Five days later, on 20 June, the Swedish steam freighter SS Tilia Gorthon was torpedoed and sunk. The Belgian steam freighter SS Luxembourg was destroyed on 21 June, followed by the Greek steam freighter SS Neion the following day. After three weeks at sea, U-38 returned to Wilhelmshaven on 2 July.|$|E
5|$|During {{her short}} career, U-104 sank one enemy vessel and damaged another {{on her first}} and only war patrol in the North Sea, off the {{northern}} coast of Ireland and Great Britain. She went to sea on her first and only war patrol on 12 November 1940. For a period of 17 days, she roamed the North Sea and eventually the northern coast of Scotland and Ireland in search of any Allied convoys heading to Great Britain. During that time she attacked two enemy vessels, sinking one and damaging the other. On 27 November 1940, U-104 torpedoed and sank the British merchant vessel Diplomat, a straggler of convoy HX 88, {{with the loss of}} 14 of her crew. The other merchant vessel was the British <b>motor</b> <b>tanker</b> Charles F. Meyer, of convoy HX 87, which survived the attack. The next day, U-104 went missing just north of neutral Ireland. She is presumed to have been sunk by a mine from the SN 44 minefield, which was laid on 8 November 1940, just 20 days prior to U-104s disappearance. All of her crew are presumed dead.|$|E

It extinguished itself within 25 minutes. 50 minutes later the submarine hit her with a third torpedo, which set the ship afire again.

5000|$|The whale {{factory vessels}} were {{actually}} tankers with the whale processing equipment added, {{so it was}} natural for Næss and his partners to venture into tankers. The first small step was in 1930 with two <b>motor</b> <b>tankers,</b> Nore, a [...] vessel and Norvinn , both considered large by then current standards. The vessels were to have traded in the spot market, but as the rates were low both were laid up. Næss was not discouraged by this and on 20 February 1936 established the company Viking Tanker Company Limited with capital raised in London. The administration was in Paris and the vessels were to sail under the Panama flag. It bought the two previous mentioned tankers from Rasmussen & Moe's Rederi A/S, and as the tanker market was good it ordered and bought several vessels. By 1938 the company had 5 vessels, Nore, Norvinn, Norvik, Norlys and Norbris, totalling [...] - a large tanker fleet for that period. The financial results were good with a net profit of £192,575 for the company's second year of operation.|$|R

Soil was collected from different locations involving traffic and vegetation. Soils from three locations around our university were collected every month, to investigate seasonal movement. PAHs were extracted from soil by soxhlet extraction with dichloromethane. They were then analyzed quantitatively by HPLC/UV. We classed PAHs by number of rings, and examined the concentration and seasonal movements. All content of 16 PAHs in soils increased in proportion to traffic volume. At the same locations of traffic volume, the gravitation at a location with plant with all content of 16 PAHs in soils was, furthermore, found to have a low concentration. There were different seasonal movements of the 2, 3 -ring and 4, 5, 6 -ring PAHs. 4, 5, 6 -ring PAHs have a strong correlation with each other (r 3 ̆e 0. 79), but there were no correlations between 2, 3 -ring and 4, 5, 6 -ring PAHs.
