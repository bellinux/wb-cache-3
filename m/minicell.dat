50|$|An early phase {{clinical}} trial using the platform of ‘Minicell’ nanoparticle for drug delivery {{have been tested}} on patients with advanced and untreatable cancer. Built from the membranes of mutant bacteria, the minicells were loaded with paclitaxel and coated with cetuximab, antibodies that bind the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) which is often overexpressed {{in a number of}} cancers, as a 'homing' device to the tumor cells. The tumor cells recognize the bacteria from which the minicells have been derived, regard it as invading microorganism and engulf it. Once inside, the payload of anti-cancer drug kills the tumor cells. Measured at 400 nanometers, the <b>minicell</b> is bigger than synthetic particles developed for drug delivery. The researchers indicated that this larger size gives the minicells a better profile in side-effects because the minicells will preferentially leak out of the porous blood vessels around the tumor cells and do not reach the liver, digestive system and skin. This Phase 1 {{clinical trial}} demonstrated that this treatment is well tolerated by the patients. As a platform technology, the <b>minicell</b> drug delivery system can be used to treat a number of different cancers with different anti-cancer drugs with the benefit of lower dose and less side-effects.|$|E
5000|$|After {{the control}} word comes the TDMoIP payload. For structure-agnostic {{transport}} (SAToP) {{this is simply}} a predetermined number of TDM octets, while for the structure-locked format the payload is an integer number of TDM frames. For structure-indication and structure-reassembly TDMoIP draws on proven adaptation mechanisms originally developed for ATM. A side benefit of this choice of payload types is simplified interworking with circuit emulation services carried over ATM networks. For statically allocated, constant bit-rate (CBR) TDM links, TDMoIP employs ATM adaptation layer 1 (AAL1). This mechanism, defined in ITU-T standard I.363.1 and ATM Forum specification atm-vtoa-0078, was developed for carrying CBR services over ATM. AAL1 operates by segmenting the continuous stream of TDM data into small 48-byte cells and inserting sequencing, timing, error recovery, and synchronization information into them. TDMoIP allows concatenation of any number of AAL1 cells into a packet (note that these are AAL1 cells and not ATM cells, i.e. they {{do not include the}} five-byte [...] "cell tax"). By allowing multiple cells per packet, TDMoIP facilitates flexible tradeoffs of buffering delay (which decreases with fewer cells per packet) for bandwidth efficiency (which increases with more cells per packet, due to the per packet overhead). For dynamically allocated TDM links, whether the information rate varies due to activation of time slots or due to voice activity detection, TDMoIP employs ATM adaptation layer 2 (AAL2). This mechanism, defined in ITU-T standard I.363.2, was developed for carrying variable bit rate (VBR) services over ATM. AAL2 operates by buffering each TDM time slot into short minicells, inserting the time slot identifier and length indication, sequencing, and then sending this <b>minicell</b> only if it carries valid information. TDMoIP concatenates the minicells from all active time slots into a single packet. For time slots carrying high-level data link control (HDLC) data, such as data for common channel signaling (CCS), TDMoIP has a special adaptation that encapsulates stretches of non-idle data.|$|E

The objective {{of this study was to}} assist in the preclinical development of using modified, non-living bacterially-derived <b>minicells</b> to deliver the potent chemotherapeutic doxorubicin via epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) targeting. Specifically, this study sought to evaluate the safety and efficacy of EGFR targeted, doxorubicin loaded <b>minicells</b> (designated EGFRminicellsDox) to deliver doxorubicin to spontaneous brain tumors in 17 companion dogs; a comparative oncology model of human brain cancers. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPLE FINDINGS: EGFRminicellsDox were administered weekly via intravenous injection to 17 dogs with late-stage brain cancers. Biodistribution was assessed using single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Anti-tumor response was determined using MRI, and blood samples were subject to toxicology (hematology, biochemistry) and inflammatory marker analysis. Targeted, doxorubicin-loaded <b>minicells</b> rapidly localized to the core of brain tumors. Complete resolution or marked tumor regression (> 90 % reduction in tumor volume) were observed in 23. 53 % of the cohort, with lasting anti-tumor responses characterized by remission in three dogs for more than two years. The median overall survival was 264 days (range 49 to 973). No adverse clinical, hematological or biochemical effects were observed with repeated administration of EGFRminicellsDox (30 to 98 doses administered in 10 of the 17 dogs).

Mutants with mutations at both of the <b>minicell</b> loci of B. subtilis, divIVA and divIVB, possess a <b>minicell</b> phenotype identical to that of the DivIVB- mutant. The DivIVA-mutants, but not the DivIVB- mutants, show a decrease in sporulation efficiency and a delay in the kinetics of endospore formation. The data support a model in which divIVA encodes the topological specificity subunit of the minCD system. The model suggests that DivIVA acts as a pilot protein, directing minCD to the polar septation sites. DivIVA also appears to be the interface between a sporulation component and MinCD, freeing up the polar septation sites for use during the asymmetric septation event of the sporulation process...|$|E

Structured and Mini-cell multiplexing methods were more efficient at low traffic loads. <b>Minicell</b> Multiplexing was the most efficient of the multiplexing methods.

40|$|The ftsZ (sulB) gene of Escherichia coli {{codes for}} a 40, 000 -dalton protein that carries out a key {{step in the}} cell {{division}} pathway. The presence of an ftsZ gene protein in other bacterial species was examined {{by a combination of}} Southern blot and Western blot analyses. Southern blot analysis of genomic restriction digests revealed that many bacteria, including species from six members of the family Enterobacteriaceae and from Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Agrobacterium tumefaciens, contained sequences which hybridized with an E. coli ftsZ probe. Genomic DNA from more distantly related bacteria, including Bacillus subtilis, Branhamella catarrhalis, Micrococcus luteus, and Staphylococcus aureus, did not hybridize under minimally stringent conditions. Western blot analysis, with anti-E. coli FtsZ antiserum, revealed that all bacterial species examined contained a major immunoreactive band. Several of the Enterobacteriaceae were transformed with a multicopy plasmid encoding the E. coli ftsZ gene. These transformed strains, Shigella sonnei, Salmonella typhimurium, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Enterobacter aerogenes, were shown to overproduce the FtsZ protein and to produce <b>minicells.</b> Analysis of [35 S]methionine-labeled <b>minicells</b> revealed that the plasmid-encoded gene products were the major labeled species. This demonstrated that the E. coli ftsZ gene could function in other bacterial species to induce <b>minicells</b> and that these <b>minicells</b> could be used to analyze plasmid-endoced gene products...|$|R
40|$|<b>Minicells</b> {{segregated}} from Escherichia coli ~ 9 2 5 {{carrying a}} drug-resistance plasmid were separated from nucleated cells by differential centrifugation and purified by rate-zonal centrifugation in sucrose gradients. <b>Minicells</b> purified {{in this way}} were capable of donating the plasmid to nucleated cells. They also incorporated thymidine, uridine and methionine into macromolecules. Methods are described for purification of plasmid-containing mini-cells on a scale large enough to allow isolation of DNA, DNA polymerase and RNA polymerase in sufficient quantities for studies of enzymes involved in replication and transcription of plasmid DNA...|$|R
40|$|Certain genetic, structural, and {{biochemical}} {{properties of}} a class 2 R-factor system consisting of the conjugally proficient transfer plasmid I and the naturally occurring non-conjugative tetracycline (Tc) resistance plasmid 219 are reported. I and 219 exist as separate plasmid deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) species in both Escherichia coli and Salmonella panama, having molecular weights of 42 × 106 and 5. 8 × 106, respectively. The buoyant densities of I and 219 are 1. 702 and 1. 710 g/cm 3, respectively, in neutral cesium chloride. Although the Tc resistance plasmid is not transmissible in a normal conjugal mating, it is mobilized in a three-component mating by plasmid I and by certain other conjugative plasmids of the fi+ or fi− phenotype. Mobilization {{does not appear to}} involve intermolecular recombination between plasmids, and no covalent linkage of resistance markers and fertility functions is observed. Transformation of CaCl 2 -treated E. coli by plasmid DNA is shown to be a useful procedure for studying the biological properties of different plasmid molecular species that have been fractionated in vitro, and for selectively inserting non-self-transmissible plasmids into specific bacterial strains. The effects of tetracycline on the rate of protein synthesis carried out by plasmid 219 were studied by using isolated E. coli <b>minicells</b> into which this plasmid had segregated. Consistent with the results of earlier investigations showing the inducibility of plasmid-mediated Tc resistance in E. coli, the antibiotic was observed to stimulate protein synthesis in <b>minicells</b> carrying the plasmid 219 and totally inhibit 3 H-leucine incorporation by <b>minicells</b> lacking the Tc resistance marker. Five discrete polypeptide species were synthesized by <b>minicells</b> carrying plasmid 219; exposure of <b>minicells</b> or parent bacteria to Tc resulted in specific and reproducible changes in polypeptide synthesis patterns...|$|R
