25|$|When {{looking for}} life on other planets like Earth, some {{simplifying}} assumptions are useful {{to reduce the size}} of the task of the astrobiologist. One is the informed assumption that the vast majority of life forms in our galaxy are based on carbon chemistries, as are all life forms on Earth. Carbon is well known for the unusually wide variety of molecules that can be formed around it. Carbon is the fourth most abundant element in the universe and the energy required to <b>make</b> <b>or</b> <b>break</b> <b>a</b> bond is at just the appropriate level for building molecules which are not only stable, but also reactive. The fact that carbon atoms bond readily to other carbon atoms allows for the building of extremely long and complex molecules.|$|E

Other objects like Ba gua mirrors are still regularly used to deflect evil spirits, and buildings often lack any floor number that has a 4 in it, due to its similarity to the word for [...] "die" [...] in Cantonese.

500|$|Kubrick spent {{extensive}} hours editing, often working {{seven days}} a week, and more hours a day as he got closer to deadlines. For Kubrick, written dialogue was one element {{to be put in}} balance with mise en scène (set arrangements), music, and especially, editing. Inspired by Pudovkin's treatise on film editing, Kubrick realized that one could create a performance in the editing room and often [...] "re-direct" [...] a film, and he remarked: [...] "I love editing. I think I like it more than any other phase of filmmaking... Editing is the only unique aspect of filmmaking which does not resemble any other art form—a point so important it cannot be overstressed... It can <b>make</b> <b>or</b> <b>break</b> <b>a</b> film". Biographer John Baxter stated that [...] "Instead of finding the intellectual spine of a film in the script before starting work, Kubrick felt his way towards the final version of a film by shooting each scene from many angles and demanding scores of takes on each line. Then over months... he arranged and rearranged {{the tens of thousands of}} scraps of film to fit a vision that really only began to emerge during editing".|$|E

Whereas Nintendo's offering featured a conservative design, true to the Mario tradition, Sonic showcased a new style of design made possible by a new generation of hardware. Sonic featured large stages that scrolled effortlessly in all directions, as well as all manner of uneven terrain, curved hills, and a complex physics system that allowed players to rush through its levels with well-placed jumps and rolls. Lastly, there was the game's eponymous main character. Sega decided to give Sonic a rebellious personality in order to appeal to older gamers, and super speed to help show off the Genesis hardware capabilities. The game proved to be a massive hit, was a successful pack-in with new systems, and cemented the view that platform games would <b>make</b> <b>or</b> <b>break</b> <b>a</b> console.|$|E
2500|$|Usually {{talent is}} {{secondary}} {{to the success of}} a Cantopop singer in Hong Kong. Most of the time, the image sells the albums, as {{it is one of the}} characteristic of mainstream music similarly mirrored in the United States and Japan. Publicity is vital to an idol's career, as one piece of news could <b>make</b> <b>or</b> <b>break</b> <b>a</b> future. [...] Almost all modern Cantopop stars go into the movie business regardless of their ability to act; however the reverse may also occur with actors releasing albums and embarking on concerts regardless of singing talent. They immediately expand to the Mandarin market once their fame is established, hence pure Cantopop stars are almost nonexistent. Outside of the music sales, their success can also be gauged by their income. For example, according to some reports, Sammi Cheng earned HK$46M (around US$6M) from advertisement and merchandise endorsements in one month alone. Many artists however begin with financial hardships. [...] For example, Yumiko Cheng owed her company thousands of dollars. [...] Others include Elanne Kong crying in public with only HK$58 left.|$|E

Ólafur's music was widely praised. Mike Hale, writing in The New York Times, called it [...] "a tasty icing of gloom and foreboding", and noted that the show leaned very heavily on the mood that the music created. Cast members were equally as impressed with the music. Actress Jodie Whittaker has said that [...] "hearing the music by Ólafur Arnalds just broke me every time." [...] Actor Andrew Buchan was equally effusive. [...] "The power of music can draw people in more than they realise. I had never heard {{a piece of music}} like it.

Indeed, designers must {{pay attention to}} the narratives in which an artifact appears as soon as it enters the conversations among stakeholders, bystanders, critics, and users, to the names that categorize the artifact as being of one kind or another, and to the adjectives that direct perception to particular qualities (is it a fast car? a clumsy cell phone? a high class dress?). Such characterizations can <b>make</b> <b>or</b> <b>break</b> <b>an</b> artifact and designers cannot ignore how people talk about them.
