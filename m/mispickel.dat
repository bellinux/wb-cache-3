5000|$|The old ferry {{crossings}} {{were later}} {{to develop into}} the busy river quays of {{the eighteenth and nineteenth}} centuries. In mediaeval times the transport of goods to supply the Benedictine abbey at Tavistock, four miles by track from the river port of Morwellham, was significant. Sea sand from the coast was imported to spread on farmland, until in the eighteenth century a dressing of lime was found to be more beneficial. Large quantities of limestone and coal were then imported to burn in the numerous limekilns on the river quays; the lime had to be made locally as it was not slaked before application and was too reactive for transport by water after burning. Later, street sweepings and other refuse from Plymouth and Devonport, together with bones for the newly discovered bone fertiliser, were carried inland to manure the fields. Other regular imports were timber from British Columbia and the Baltic, in large baulks for use as supports in the mines, and coal from Wales to supply the mine pumping engines.Tavistock was one of the three stannary towns of Devon and large quantities of refined tin ore were exported through Morwellham from twelfth century until 1838, when the requirement to pay duty on the metal at one of the specified towns was relaxed. The opening of the Tavistock Canal, between Tavistock and Morwellham, in 1817 facilitated traffic. Later, the East Cornwall Mineral Railway provided an outlet through the quays of Calstock from the Cornish side of the valley. [...] Other significant cargoes exported were quarried granite and, later, copper, lead and manganese ores, with their important by-product of arsenic. Arsenic was extracted from <b>mispickel,</b> once regarded as a waste product but later offering an important source of revenue as copper and tin extraction declined in profitability. The refined product was exported worldwide, in particular to the southern United States, where it was used as an insecticide in the cotton fields.|$|E
30|$|Volcanic or {{geothermal}} eruptions, loellingite (FeAs 2), sulfide minerals as orpiment (As 2 S 3), realgar (AsS), and <b>mispickel</b> (FeAsS) are {{the principal}} sources of environmental arsenic (Smedley and Kinniburgh 2002; Mandal and Suzuki 2002). The anthropogenic contributions of As results from industrial or agricultural activities: the smelting of arsenic bearing minerals, the burning of fossil fuels, the glass industry, arsenical pesticides, herbicides, and crop desiccants (Smedley and Kinniburgh 2002). The usual concentration of arsenic in groundwater varies between 1 and 10  μg/L (Bissen and Frimmel 2003; Sharma and Sohn 2009) and geochemical conditions of the aquifers that favor the mobilization and the accumulation of the anionic species of As {{are considered to be}} mainly responsible (Matin et al. 2004; Aloupi et al. 2009). Inorganic arsenic species are highly toxic, and various diseases, including lung cancer, liver cancer, renal cancer, and skin cancer or perturbations of the respiratory, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, nervous, and hematopoietic systems, were associated with drinking water that is high in arsenic (Smith et al. 2002; Ali and Aboul-Enein 2002; Ali 2012).|$|E
40|$|The {{external}} appearance somewhat {{resembles that of}} the fossil wood often found in the upper members of our Permo-Carboniferous series, {{but in this case}} the woody structure has not been silicified, and the attempts which I have had made to polish sections for closer examination have not been successful. There is much variety in the outer portions of exposed fragments. of the tree. Iron sulphides replacing the organic tissues and becoming subsequently oxidised seem to have been the petrifying agents, and there are traces here and there of white iron pyrites (marcasite), or arsenical pyrites (<b>mispickel)</b> still unaltered. The latter is very abundant in the coal measures of the Mersey district. Judging from the arrangement of the stumps of branches, the form of the tree must have resembled that of a pine, and faint indications of markings like the "pits" which are the distinguishing feature of coniferous wood may be seen here and there, but no definite conclusion can be come to under this head until after careful microscopical examination...|$|E
40|$|International audienceLate-Hercynian Intrusion-related gold deposits: an {{integrated}} model on the Tighza polymetallic district, central Morocco, African Earth Sciences (2015), doi: [URL] have been recently {{recognized in the}} Tighza (formerly Jebel Aouam) district, in the Hercynian belt of central Morocco. This district {{has long been known}} for its W mineralization, as well as major Pb-Ag-Zn, and minor Sb-Ba deposits, all geographically associated with late-Hercynian calc-alkaline magmatism. Gold mineralization in the district is mainly hosted by thick W-Au quartz veins located around the “Mine granite” small granitic plug. Within the veins, gold grade is highest (up to 70 g/t) close to the granite but rapidly decreases going outward from the granite, defining a perigranitic zoning. Anomalous gold grades have also been measured in hydrothermal skarn layers close to two other granitic plugs (Kaolin granite and <b>Mispickel</b> granite), associated with disseminated As-Fe sulfides. The paragenetic sequence for the W-Au quartz veins shows three stages: 1) an early oxidized stage with wolframite-scheelite associated with early quartz (Q 1), 2) an intermediate Bi-As-Te-Mo-Au sulfide stage with loellingite, bismuth minerals and native gold with a later quartz (Q 2), restricted to a narrow distance from the granite, and 3) a late lower temperature As-Cu-Zn–(Pb) stage with abundant massive pyrrhotite, arsenopyrite and sphalerite, locally forming independent veins (“pyrrhotite vein”). Both Q 1 hyaline and Q 2 saccharoidal gold-bearing quartz display aqua-carbonic fluids with minor H 2 S and Cu and an homogeneous composition (81 mole% H 2 O, 18 mole% CO 2 and about 1 mole% NaCl). The trapping pressure is estimated to 1. 5 to 2 kbar with temperature ranging from 300 ° to 350 °C. Q 1 inclusions have exploded indicating an uplift of the Tighza block, that lead to saccharoidal Q 2 quartz deposition with multiphase NaCl-saturated fluid inclusions. 40 Ar/ 39 Ar dating demonstrates that the “Mine granite”, tungsten skarnoid, scheelite-molybdenite veins, and very likely gold-bearing veins are coeval, emplaced at 286 ± 1 Ma. Multiple and widespread metal sources are indicated by radiogenic isotope studies. Nd and Sr isotope compositions of scheelite and granites suggest the participation of a juvenile component while lead isotopes demonstrate a major participation of the basement. Both gold mineralization and zoning suggest that the system developed {{at the end of the}} magmatic activity, accompanying a major transition in magmatic fluid composition. The morphology of the gold-bearing mineralization is dependent of the permeability and the reactivity of host-rocks: focus circulation of fluids through pre-existing tectonic corridors, reactivated by late-Hercynian intrusions favor the formation of large W-type gold veins, while infiltration of fluid within reactive stratigraphic layers gives rise to skarn mineralization. A 40 Ar/ 39 Ar date (W 1 north vein: 291. 8 ± 0. 3 Ma) indicates that hydrothermal circulation predates gold and tungsten deposition in open fractures as well as Mine granite emplacement. The W-Au mineralization preceded the onset of a large convective hydrothermal cell around the intrusion that led to the formation of the Pb-Ag-Zn mined veins. The Tighza polymetallic district displays numerous similarities with the R-IRG model that was defined in the American Cordillera, such as thermal and zonation patterns, carbonic hydrothermal fluids and chronology of intrusion and related deposits, but also provides new insight to the R-IRG model such as wide Au-quartz veins instead of sheeted Au-veins, oxidation state of the magma, and Sr-Nd isotopic data. These results establish a major magmatic contribution and discard a direct genetic relationship between gold mineralization and major neighboring Pb-Ag-Zn veins. A large number of classic Pb-Zn district of the Western Hercynides belong to the same clan...|$|E
