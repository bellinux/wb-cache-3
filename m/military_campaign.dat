5|$|Basiliscus' {{military}} career started under Leo I. The Emperor conferred upon his brother-in-law the dignities of dux, or commander-in-chief, in Thrace. In this country Basiliscus led a successful <b>military</b> <b>campaign</b> against the Bulgars in 463. He succeeded Rusticius as magister militum per Thracias (464), and had several successes against the Goths and Huns (466 or 467).|$|E
5|$|Bohemond came to Antioch {{in autumn}} 1126. He {{launched}} successful military campaigns against the nearby Moslem rulers, but his conflict with Joscelin I of Courtenay enabled Imad ad-Din Zengi to secure Mosul and Aleppo. Meanwhile, Roger II of Sicily occupied the Principality of Taranto in 1128.

5|$|Meanwhile, {{tensions}} in Jordan between an increasingly autonomous PLO and King Hussein's government had been simmering; following the Dawson's Field hijackings, a <b>military</b> <b>campaign</b> was launched to rout out PLO forces.

5|$|The Hittite {{archives}} of circa 1400 BCE, {{during the reign}} of Arnuwanda I, describe the <b>military</b> <b>campaign</b> of Attarsiya in southwest Anatolia, probably in the region of Lycia. The Achaean expedition in Anatolia is associated with increased Mycenaean findings in Milet during this period (early 14th century BCE), indicating that a number of Greek people moved from mainland Greece to this region.|$|E

5|$|The {{outcome of}} a {{successful}} <b>military</b> <b>campaign</b> could vary in {{its impact on the}} defeated polity. In some cases, entire cities were sacked, and never resettled, as at Aguateca. In other instances, the victors would seize the defeated rulers, their families, and patron gods. The captured nobles and their families could be imprisoned, or sacrificed. At the least severe end of the scale, the defeated polity would be obliged to pay tribute to the victor.|$|E

5|$|Their {{last major}} <b>military</b> <b>campaign</b> was the Franklin-Nashville Campaign of November and December 1864. Ross {{and his men}} led the Confederate advance into Tennessee.

Only 12 of Ross's men were killed, with 70 wounded and five captured.|$|E

5|$|According to the Hittite inscriptions, {{it appears}} that the Ahhiya were a {{powerful}} empire, at the same scale as contemporary Egypt, Assyria and the Hittite Empire. Moreover, {{based on the fact that}} Attarsiya launched a <b>military</b> <b>campaign</b> in Anatolia and fielded one hundred chariots, in addition to infantry, Dutch researcher Jorrit Kelder suggested that Ahhiya must have had the military capacity of at least three times the size of the Mycenaean kingdom of Pylos, based on the information recorded on the Linear B tablets unearthed from the specific palace. Based on this view, the Achaeans under Attarsiya may have formed some kind of alliance which included several Mycenaean kingdoms.|$|E
5|$|During the Byzantine millennium, {{hardly a}} year passed without a <b>military</b> <b>campaign.</b> Soldiers were {{a normal part}} of {{everyday}} life, much more so than in modern Western societies. While it is difficult to draw a distinction between Roman and Byzantine soldiers from an organizational aspect, it is easier to do so in terms of their social profile. The military handbooks known as the Taktika continued a Hellenistic and Roman tradition, and contain a wealth of information about the appearance, customs, habits, and life of the soldiers.|$|E

She later canceled the tour due to concerns that she would divert attention from Cindy Sheehan's activism.|$|E
