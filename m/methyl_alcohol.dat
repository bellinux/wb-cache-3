Sewage was also discharged into Muncy Creek in Hugesville. Additionally, in the early 1900s, the waters of Muncy Creek were contaminated with tannery waste products from Muncy Valley and also chemicals. For this reason, the creek was only used for power during this time. Additionally, a <b>methyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> plant, the Nordmont Chemical Works, discharged chemicals into the creek at Nordstown.

25|$|Methanol (also {{known as}} <b>methyl</b> <b>alcohol,</b> carbinol, wood alcohol, wood naphtha or wood spirits) is a {{chemical}} compound with chemical formula CH3OH. It is the simplest alcohol, {{and is a}} light, volatile, colorless, flammable, poisonous liquid with a distinctive odor that is somewhat milder and sweeter than ethanol (ethyl alcohol). At room temperature, it is a polar solvent and is used as an antifreeze, solvent, fuel, and as a denaturant for ethyl alcohol. It is not popular for machinery, but {{may be found in}} automotive windshield washer fluid, de-icers, and gasoline additives.|$|E
25|$|The simple phenols are not {{the only}} active element in wood-tar creosote. In solution, they {{coagulate}} albumin, which is a water-soluble protein found in meat; so they serve as a preserving agent, but also cause denaturation. Most of the phenols in the creosote are methoxy derivatives—they contain the methoxy group linked to the benzene nucleus (OCH3). The high level of methyl derivates created from the action of heat on wood (also apparent in the <b>methyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> produced through distillation) make wood-tar creosote substantially different from coal-tar creosote. Guaiacol is a methyl ether of pyrocatechin, while creosol is a methyl ether of methyl-pyrocatechin, the next homolog of pyrocatechin. Methyl ethers differ from simple phenols in being less hydrophilic, caustic and poisonous. This allows meat to successfully be preserved without tissue denaturation, and allows creosote {{to be used as a}} medical ointment.|$|E
25|$|Early {{engine coolant}} {{antifreeze}} was methanol (<b>methyl</b> <b>alcohol).</b> Methanol was {{widely used in}} windshield fluids, however, in Europe, due to new REACH legislation, the use of methanol in windshield fluids is limited to 5% and {{in the near future}} will be further reduced to 3%. As radiator caps were vented, not sealed, the methanol was lost to evaporation, requiring frequent replenishment to avoid freezing of the coolant. Methanol also accelerates corrosion of the metals, especially aluminum, used in the engine and cooling systems. Ethylene glycol was developed, and soon replaced methanol as an engine cooling system antifreeze. It has a very low volatility compared to methanol and to water. Before the 1950s, coolant systems were unpressurized and the engine was often cooler than modern automotive engines. By pressurizing the coolant system with a radiator cap, the boiling point of the fluid is increased, permitting higher engine temperatures and better fuel efficiency. Pressurized systems do not appreciably change the freezing point. Later propylene glycol was introduced due to its environmental credentials.|$|E

50|$|Pectin is the soluble {{polymeric}} {{material in the}} pulp of oranges, which contains 75% of carboxyl of arabinose and galactose.

Pectin methyl-esterase is the enzyme responsible for hydrolyzing carboxymethyl esters and liberating free carboxyl groups and <b>methyl</b> <b>alcohols.</b> The free carboxyl groups interact with cations to form insoluble pectic acid divalent metal ion complexes.
