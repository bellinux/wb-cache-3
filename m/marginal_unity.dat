40|$|A copula {{density is}} the joint {{probability}} density function (PDF) of a random vector with uniform marginals. An approach to bivariate copula density estimation is introduced {{that is based}} on a maximum penalized likelihood estimation (MPLE) with a total variation (TV) penalty term. The <b>marginal</b> <b>unity</b> and symmetry constraints for copula density are enforced by linear equality constraints. The TV-MPLE subject to linear equality constraints is solved by an augmented Lagrangian and operator-splitting algorithm. It offers an order of magnitude improvement in computational efficiency over another TV-MPLE method without constraints solved by log-barrier method for second order cone program. A data-driven selection of the regularization parameter is through K-fold cross-validation (CV). Simulation and real data application show the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The MATLAB code implementing the methodology is available online...|$|E
40|$|This article {{presents}} {{an estimate of}} Tobin's average q based on financial market expectations. When <b>marginal</b> q exceeds <b>unity</b> it is profitable to invest, however, only average q is observable. Due to uncertainty linked to demand constraints, average q can differ from marginal q; thus an investment equation based on average q requires a proxy for uncertainty. This type of specification explains the rate of investment in France quite well. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{estimates}} the optimal government size {{for the state}} governments in Mexico, investigating the role of public services in the production process. It is assumed that government services are optimally provided when their <b>marginal</b> product equals <b>unity</b> (the "Barro rule"). The empirical results suggest (1) government services are significantly productive; (2) they are overprovided in all state governments in Mexico; (3) the optimal government size for the average state {{of the country is}} 3. 1 % (± 2. 3 %), whereas for the average state of the north and south is 8. 3 % and 2. 5 %, respectively; finally it was found a negative relation between the government size and the productivity of the southern governments, whereas in the others states there was no evidence to approve the above mentioned relation. optimal government size, government expenditure productivity, Intergovernmental Relations...|$|R
40|$|This eleven-month ethnographic study puts {{critical}} {{discourse analysis}} {{in dialogue with}} postmodern conceptualizations of space and place to explore how eight educators talk about space and in the process, produce racialized spaces in Roche Bois, Mauritius. The macro-historical context of racialization of this urban marginalized community informs the discursive analysis of educators 2 ̆ 7 talk at school. Drawing on theories of race that call for the non-deterministic exploration of race relations as they occur in different contexts and times (Hall, 2000; Pandian 2 ̆ 6 Kosek, 2003; Essed 2 ̆ 6 Goldberg, 2000), I explore the spatial racialization of children in Roche Bois as a process specific to this township and its history. Engaging with Lefebvre 2 ̆ 7 s three-dimensional theorization of space (Lefebre, 1991) {{as well as the}} Discourse Historical Approach developed by Wodak and colleagues (Wodak 2 ̆ 6 Reisgl, 1999), I draw on the micro-macro concept of identity construction 2 ̆ 2 strategy 2 ̆ 2 to study 1) how meanings of race play out as an amalgam of various thematic dimensions of schooling, culture, bodies, and work that are spatialized; 2) how meanings of place perpetuate or transform long-standing historical constructions of Creole identity in Roche Bois. The findings show that repeated patterns of educators 2 ̆ 7 spatial racialization produce and reproduce conceived spaces (Lefebvre, 1991) and yet my research also highlights that banal moments of lived space (Lefebvre, 1991) also exist, as ordinary disruptions of the spatial order produced by patterns of conceived space. While educator discourse for the most part negatively emplaces and racializes the children, one educator 2 ̆ 7 s representations of place and race both assimilates and differentiates <b>marginal</b> identities, encourages <b>unity</b> and essentialism {{at the same time as}} promotes hybridity. The analysis therefore shows that discourses of place are not totalizing and that moments of interruption can be the basis for thinking of teacher education and practice as a politics of 2 ̆ 2 decolonization 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 reinhabitation 2 ̆ 2 (Gruenewald, 2003). Specifically, the findings indicate the importance of reinvesting critical historical meanings into pedagogies of the local. ...|$|R
