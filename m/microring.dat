5000|$|Due to {{the nature}} of the optical ring {{resonator}} and how it [...] "filters" [...] certain wavelengths of light passing through, it is possible to create high-order optical filters by cascading many optical ring resonators in series. This would allow for [...] "small size, low losses, and integrability into existing optical networks." [...] Additionally, since the resonance wavelengths can be changed by simply increasing or decreasing the radius of each ring, the filters can be considered tunable. This basic property can be used to create a sort of mechanical sensor. If an optical fiber experiences mechanical strain, the dimensions of the fiber will be altered, thus resulting in a change in the resonant wavelength of light emitted. This can be used to monitor fibers or waveguides for changes in their dimensions.The tuning process can be effected also by a change of refractive index using various means including thermo-optic, electro-optic [...] or all-optical [...] effects. Electro-optic and all-optical tuning is faster than thermal and mechanical means, and hence find various applications including in optical communication. Optical modulators with a high-Q <b>microring</b> are reported to yield outstandingly small power of modulation at a speed of > 50 Gbit/s at cost of a tuning power to match wavelength of the light source. A ring modulator placed in a Fabry-Perot laser cavity was reported to eliminate the tuning power by automatic matching of the laser wavelength with that of the ring modulator while maintaining high-speed ultralow-power modulation of a Si <b>microring</b> modulator.|$|E

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Scattered radiation exposure was measured using an ion chamber survey meter for 17 adult patients undergoing videofluoroscopy for swallowing study.

RESULTS: The scattered radiation exposure {{at a distance of}} 150 cm from the patient and the dose area product recorded were 149 +/- 78 <b>microR</b> (range 42 - 308 <b>microR)</b> and 842 +/- 544 cGy. cm(2) (range 258 - 2151 cGy. cm(2)), respectively, for a single study of 18 +/- 6 minutes.

50|$|In {{a typical}} optical link, data is first {{transferred}} from the electrical to the optical domain using an electro-optic modulator or a directly-modulated laser. An electro-optic modulator can vary the intensity and/or the phase of the optical carrier. In silicon photonics, a common technique to achieve modulation is to vary the density of free charge carriers. Variations of electron and hole densities change the real and the imaginary part of the refractive index of silicon as described by the empirical equations of Soref and Bennett. Modulators can consist of both forward-biased PIN diodes, which generally generate large phase-shifts but suffer of lower speeds, {{as well as of}} reverse-biased PN junctions. A prototype optical interconnect with <b>microring</b> modulators integrated with germanium detectors has been demonstrated.Non-resonant modulators, such as Mach-Zehnder interferometers, have typical dimensions in the millimeter range and are usually used in telecom or datacom applications.

Identification of new specific biomarkers could be helpful to detection of this malignancy. Altered plasma microRNA expression has been identified in many cancers, including colorectal cancer. Objectives: The main objective of this study was to identify the circulating microRNAs with the most expression changes in colorectal cancer patients compared with neoplasm free healthy individuals. Materials and Methods: MicroRNA expression profiling was performed on plasma samples of 37 colorectal cancer patients and 8 normal subjects using microRNA microarray. Quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction was used to validate the two selected altered <b>microR</b> NAs. Plasma samples from 61 colorectal cancer patients and 24 normal subjects were used in our validation study. Results: In profiling study we found a panel of six plasma microRNAs with significant downregulation.

Our results demonstrated that expression levels of plasma microRNA- 142 - 3 p and microRNA- 26 a- 5 p were significantly downregulated in patients with colorectal cancer when compared to control group. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that downregulation of plasma microRNA- 142 - 3 p and microRNA- 26 a- 5 p might serve as novel noninvasive biomarkers in the diagnosis of colorectal cancer, although more studies are needed to highlight the theoretical strengths. © 2015, Iranian Journal of Cancer Prevention...|$|R
