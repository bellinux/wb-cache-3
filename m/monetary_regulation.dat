50|$|The third {{component}} of the scheme of <b>monetary</b> <b>regulation</b> recommended by the committee and which marks an important departure from the prevailing Monetary Policy practice in India relates to significant relaxations in the prevailing system of administered rates of Interest. The committee {{does not support the}} idea of pricing Credit too low for both the government and the commercial borrowers in public or Private Sector. This is attributable to the fact that low rates of Interest, encourages too much monetisation of Government debt, leaves too little for the Reserve Bank of India's refinance of banks, discourages effective use of Credit by borrowers, discourages financial savings and reduces profitability of Banks and other Financial institutions.|$|E

The first, the Financial Entities Law, was enacted by the Central Bank on June 1, 1977, and introduced a sweeping deregulation of the nation's financial sector, including commercial banks, while prohibiting non-profit banking and imposing minimum capital requirements of US$10 million. New regulations shuttered numerous Argentine credit unions and community banks, which in a bid to survive, were granted a charter by Diz to form Credico-op Bank in 1979. Domestic credit was also stymied by the new policies, particularly the <b>Monetary</b> <b>Regulation</b> Account Law of 1977, which raised reserve requirements to 45% of deposits, thereby doubling borrowers' interest rates while eliminating yields on demand deposits; GDP, which had grown by 5% amid the improved business sentiment, fell by over 3% in the year after these policy changes as fixed investment plummeted.|$|E

However, annual inflation was 8%, 9% and 10% during the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s(1990-1995) respectively. The committee did not share the same view on Monetary Targeting as was practiced in countries around the world. It did not believe in setting rigid targets. Monetary targeting for them was more of an inflexible rule which had to be constantly changed depending on factors in the economy, such as growth etc. Optimally, the growth of money supply should be adapted to the expected growth in the Demand for money associated with the expected growth in Real income at stable prices.

40|$|The work {{presented}} here develops a distributed systems architecture and propose an implementation framework for conducting dependable Internet based on-line auctions, {{meeting the requirements}} of scalability and service integrity. Current auction services essentially rely on a central auction server. Given the increasing popularity and usage of electronic auctions, such a centralised approach is fundamentally restrictive with respect to scalability. Further, different national markets have different <b>monetary</b> <b>regulations</b> and may employ different procedures for payment settlements. Catering for local market autonomy means that decentralisation is an essential and practical requirement. With these design goals in mind, the paper develops an approach that permits an auction service to be mapped on to globally distributed auction servers. It then proposes a framework for a fault-tolerant implementation of the architecture. Faulttolerance is achieved through matured technologies: replication management and group paradigm.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} Léon Walras and Augustin Cournot {{views on}} <b>monetary</b> <b>regulation.</b> Important differences {{can be found}} in their views about the convenience of the issuing of paper money and fiat money in general. Whereas Walras is against bank notes, even if coming from a central bank, Cournot has a moderate position. He accepts the need for bank notes even without a strict adjustment to metal reserves. It can be ascertained that Cournot believes discretionary <b>monetary</b> <b>regulation</b> is convenient and acceptable, while Walras believes the only acceptable monetary system is one based exclusively on the stability of the value of money under a monetary rule following the strict equivalence between metallic reserves and a pure medium of exchange form of money. This paper shows Cournot´s ability to understand more clearly than Walras the evolution of the monetary system of his days. Whereas Walras is trying to guarantee the coherence of his pure theory with his applied theory, and he is then unable to accept the evolution toward a monetary system based on fiat money and he proposes very rigid and complex system of quasi-bimetallic circulation where banks are simple mediators between entrepreneurs and savings.

40|$|Monetary {{conditions}} index (MCI) is {{an indicator}} of the combined effect of short-term interest rates and the exchange rate on price stability and/or aggregate demand. The MCI enables monitoring of changes in the level of restrictiveness and/or expansiveness of monetary policy compared to the base period. It enables us to observe the impact of monetary conditions on the general level of prices and inflation process. Depending on the circumstances, MCI can be construed by calculating weights to account for the relative effect of the exchange rate and interest rates on either aggregate demand or prices. As inflation expectations in Serbia strengthened in the prior period, the authors agreed to construe the MCI so as to account for the relative effect of the exchange rate and interest rates on price levels. Empirical analysis of MCI movements shows that there was a relaxation in the monetary policy stance in late 2004 and early 2005. Indirect measures of <b>monetary</b> <b>regulation</b> are still ineffective in our country. Changes in reserve requirements, as the most frequently used monetary policy instrument in the prior period, did not always lead to the results expected.

This paper focuses on description and definition of foreign exchange intervention, methods of interventions {{with an emphasis on}} the goals of interventions under different currency regimes. Monetary authorities are intervening on foreign exchange market to achieve a variety of macroeconomic objectives like controlling inflation, maintaining competitiveness but mostly when changes of the domestic currency can be danger for stability of economy or danger for financial stability. Specific motives for intervention are like to change with the level of economic development and changes of currency regimes. Foreign exchange interventions are effective in short-run but they are not independent tool. Their effectiveness depends also on coordination of currency policy and macroeconomic policy. Foreign exchange interventions should be supported by other <b>monetary</b> <b>regulations</b> to influence exchange rate, dampen exchange rate volatility or supply liquidity to foreign exchange markets.

Furthermore, in this process, which was not sufficiently recognised by the practitioners, such trust relations were unable to cope with the impersonality of money. The nub of the question about a 'crisis of capitalism' is how nation-states can possibly control money - the most anarchic and global social relation in the world today. The article questions Keynesianism and economic liberalism alike, by asking if it is possible for states to force global banks to take the risks of lending for development. It argues that the real focus of attention needs to be the practices of complex international banking networks and the way 'banks march in step'. 10 page(s...|$|E
