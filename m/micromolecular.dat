5000|$|The {{collaboration}} between King Louis Philippe I and Jacques, both great lovers of plants, {{led to a}} number of new plant varieties, in particular several new rambling roses. These stemmed in part from Rosa sempervirens, introduced from 1826 onwards and its varieties still popular today because of an ability to climb over arches, trellises and walls, producing a profusion of nodding flowers. Two of Jacques’ roses have received The Royal Horticultural Society’s Award of Garden Merit. Other varieties which remained popular were the 1828 ‘Félicité-Perpétue’ - Perpetua and Felicity were two Christian women martyred for their faith in Carthage in AD203. Jacques was one of the founding members of the [...] "Horticultural Society of Paris", created 11 June 1827 which became, in 1885, the National Horticultural Society of France. The sempervirens hybrids were named mainly for members of the King's family - [...] "Adélaide d’Orléans" [...] (after his sister), [...] "Princesse Louise" [...] (after his eldest daughter, the later Queen of Belgium), [...] "Princesse Marie", (his second daughter).

In the present study a multi-column liquid chromatography (MC-LC) system was developed for the qualitative analysis of macromolecules and micromolecules in Cordyceps. The MC-LC system includes a size exclusion pre-column, a size exclusion column (SEC) and a reversed phase column (RP) which were controlled by column-switching valves. The sample was separated by the size exclusion pre-column into two fractions (macromolecules and micromolecules). These fractions were further separated on SEC and RP columns, respectively. A diode array detector (DAD) and a mass spectrometer (MS) were used to detect the components. This MC-LC method was utilized for analysis of Cordyceps samples. Two macromolecular peaks and 15 <b>micromolecular</b> peaks were found in Cordyceps, and 11 of the <b>micromolecular</b> peaks were identified as adenosine- 5 ′-monophosphate (AMP), phenylalanine, uridine, hypoxanthine, inosine, guanine, guanosine, deoxyadenosine- 5 ′-monophosphate (dAMP), adenosine, adenine and cordycepin (or its isomer).

40|$|The {{conductivity}} {{and high}} surface-to-volume ratio of carbon nanofibers (CNFs) composited with the medium-chain-length poly- 3 -hydroxyalkanoate (mcl-PHA) have {{attracted much attention}} as smart biomaterial. However, poor CNF dispersion leads to tactoid agglomerated composite with poor crystallite morphology resulting in inferior thermomechanical properties. We employed acoustic sonication to enhance the construction of exfoliated PHA/CNFs nanocomposites. The effects of CNF loading and the insonation variables (power intensity, frequency, and time) on the stability and microscopic morphology of the nanocomposites were studied. Sonication improved the dispersion of CNFs into the polymer matrix, thereby improving the physical morphology, crystallinity, and thermomechanical properties of the nanocomposites. For example, compositing the polymer with 10 %[*]w/w CNF resulted in 66 % increase in crystallite size, 46 % increase in <b>micromolecular</b> elastic strain, and 17 % increase in lattice strain.

The model makes the following assumptions: (i) that {{a small number of}} <b>micromolecular</b> substances were present at high concentration; (ii) that a random assembly mechanism combined these molecules into a variety of multimeric compounds comprising a wide repertoire of rudimentary catalytic activities; and (iii) that a lytic system capable of breaking down the assembled products existed. The model assumes further that catalysts supplied with substrates were significantly protected against breakdown. It is shown that, by granting these assumptions, an increasingly complex network of metabolic pathways would progressively be established. At the same time, the catalysts concerned would accumulate selectively to become choice substrates for elongation and other modifications that could enhance their efficiency, as well as their survival. Chemical evolution would thus proceed by a dual process of metabolic extension and catalytic innovation. Such a process should be largely deterministic and predictable from initial conditions...|$|E

Indeed, the activity of RAT parallels that of conventional macromolecular immunogens. In addition to the induction of delayed cutaneous sensitivity, it triggered the release of migration-inhibitory factor and a proliferative response by cells from sensitized animals, and it prepared guinea pigs for secondary anti-hapten responses (2, 3). An investigation of the structural requirements for immunogenicity of RAT revealed that other charged moieties could substitute for arsonate, including trimethylammonium which has an opposite charge. Modifications at the arsonate position yielded immunogens with distinctive specificities (3). Preliminary findings with compounds modified at the tyrosine position indicated that one, but not both, charged groups were essential for immunogenicity (3).

40|$|This paper {{presented}} a {{direct numerical simulation}} (DNS) study on the elasticity-induced irregular flow, passive mixing, and scalar evolution in the curvilinear microchannel. The mixing enhancement was achieved at vanishingly low-Reynolds-number chaotic flow raised by elastic instabilities. Along with the mixing process, the passive scalar transportation carried by the flow was greatly affected by the flow structure and the underlying interaction between microstructures of viscoelastic fluid and flow structure itself. The simulations are conducted {{for a wide range}} of viscoelasticity. As the elastic effect exceeds the critical value, the flow tends to a chaotic state, while the evolution of scalar gets strong and fast, showing excellent agreement with experimental results. For the temporal changing of scalar gradients, they vary rapidly in the form of isosurfaces, with the shape of “rolls” in the bulk and evolving into “threads” near the wall. That indicates that the flow fields should be related to the deformation of viscoelastic micromolecules. The probability distribution function analysis between <b>micromolecular</b> deformation and flow field deformation shows that the main direction of molecular stretching is perpendicular to the main direction of flow field deformation.

It appears that thermally induced cross-linking is readily recorded in what is known in the literature as the mechanical or network glass transition temperature, whereas the calorimetric Tg is not affected by the extent of polymeric associations in these mixtures.

Biomolecular Computation (BMC) is MC using biotechnology techniques, e. g. recombinant DNA operations.

In addition to NP search problems and database search problems, we enumerate a wide variety of further potential practical applications of BMC and QC. We observe that certain problems (e. g., NP search problems), if solved with polynomial time bounds, requires exponentially large volume for BMC, so BMC does not scale well to solve very large NP search problems.

Furthermore, {{recent studies have shown}} major differences in phenol moieties between two G. prisca-rich samples. Examination of five G. prisca-rich kerogens by electron microscopy and pyrolysis studies revealed (i) the occurrence of two markedly distinct 'morpho/chemical' types: a 'closed/phenol-rich' type (Baltic samples) and an 'open/phenol-poor' one (North American samples) and (ii) the selective preservation of the resistant <b>micromolecular</b> material building up the thick cell walls in the original organism. Comparison with extant Botryococcus braunii (a widespread green microalga) grown on media of increasing salinity suggests that G. prisca {{is likely to be a}} planktonic green microalga related to B. braunii, which can adapt to large salinity variations which, in turn, control its polymorphism. The large differences in colony morphology and in the content of phenol moieties observed in fossil G. prisca and the resulting occurrence of two 'morpho/chemical' types, should therefore reflect depositional environments with different salinities. The presence of thick, highly aliphatic, resistant walls in G. prisca selectively preserved during fossilization, accounts for the major contribution of this organism to Ordovician organic-rich sediments and for the resulting typical signature of Ordovician oils...|$|E

Small deformation dynamic oscillation in shear and modulated temperature {{differential scanning calorimetry}} enabled analysis of binary mixtures at the macro- and <b>micromolecular</b> level.

Environmental scanning electron microscopy provided tangible information on network morphology of polymeric constituents.

Two principal modes of action associated with BAs have been postulated: i) Anti-inflammatory properties, which are useful for containing edema formation, and ii) intrinsic antitumor cell properties, with a hitherto ill-defined mode of action. The present study assessed the effects of various BA derivatives on the viability and clonogenicity of a panel of nine long-term glioma cell lines and five glioma-initiating cell lines, studied cell cycle progression and the mode of cell death induction, and explored potential synergy with temozolomide (TMZ) or irradiation. BA induced the concentration-dependent loss of viability and clonogenicity that was independent of tumor protein 53 status and O 6 -methylguanine DNA methyltransferase expression. The treatment of glioma cells with BA resulted in cell death induction, prior to or upon S phase entry, and exhibited features of apoptotic cell death. Synergy with irradiation or TMZ was detected at certain concentrations; however, the inhibitory effects were mostly additive, and never antagonistic. While the intrinsic cytotoxic properties of BA at low <b>micromolecular</b> concentrations were confirmed and the potential synergy with irradiation and TMZ was identified, the proximate pharmacodynamic target of BA remains to be identified...|$|E

To find clues toward an answer via a coherent chemobiological language, struc-tural and functional information is taken into account. The functional information, given by ethnobotanical codes based on traditional knowledge (via number of useful dicotyledon species), is confronted with the structural information, given by metabolic codes based on <b>micromolecular</b> diversification (via number of occurrences in dicotyledons). The challenge to integrate these databases implies in the development of qualitative (via dahlgrenograms) and quantitative (via Sporne indices) models into an evolutionary framework. The follow-up of ethnobotanical qualifications reveals systematic and evolutionary patterns, susceptible to juxtaposition into a phytochemical background based on gallates (GAL) and caffeates (CAF), regulators of intermediate metabolism. Comparison of the two models of information suggests that the “spectral ” features of the GAL and CAF-models are coincident with the eth-nobotany-guided food- and medicine-plants respectively. Hence, the complementary nature of food and medicine species can be rationalized by oscillations between GAL/CAF.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{investigate}} the edema induced by leukotriene D 4 (LTD 4). Edema is the gross effect of increased blood flow and capillary permeability. Our objective was to elucidate the effect of LTD 4 on edema generation without the influence of the concomitantly increased blood flow induced by this potent vasodilator. A new method was outlined measuring the exudation through skin windows of a macromolecular tracer ([131 I]albumin) and a <b>micromolecular</b> tracer ([99 Tc]pertechnetat). Exudation of [131 I]albumin is a function of enhanced vascular permeability and interstitial transport and blood flow, whereas that of [99 Tc] pertechnetat is mainly a function of blood flow. Thus a ratio of the 2 exudate measurements gives a specific estimate of the changes in vascular permeability and interstitial transport. Histamine was employed to establish the method. A dose–response relation was found for histamine in the dose range of 10 - 4 to 10 - 7 M. The effect of 10 - 5 M LTD 4 on vascular permeability and interstitial transport of macromolecules was indistinguishable from that of histamine in the same concentration. This property together with their well-known vasodilatory capabilities indicate that the leukotrienes of the slow-reacting substance of anaphylaxis may play a role in the vascular changes in the allergic-inflammatory reaction...|$|E

40|$|Background: To manage {{chemical}} structures in small laboratories {{is one of}} the important daily tasks. Few solutions are available on the internet, {{and most of them are}} closed source applications. The open-source applications typically have limited capability and basic cheminformatics functionalities. In this article, we describe an open-source solution to manage chemicals in research groups based on open source and free components. It has a user-friendly interface with the functions of chemical handling and intensive searching. Results: MyMolDB is a <b>micromolecular</b> database solution that supports exact, substructure, similarity, and combined searching. This solution is mainly implemented using scripting language Python with a web-based interface for compound management and searching. Almost all the searches are in essence done with pure SQL on the database by using the high performance of the database engine. Thus, impressive searching speed has been archived in large data sets for no external Central Processing Unit (CPU) consuming languages were involved in the key procedure of the searching.

40|$|An {{analysis}} is presented of the catalytic factors {{responsible for the}} rate-enhancement that may be observed when a protein modification reaction is compared with a reaction of the same modifying agent with a model <b>micromolecular</b> compound exhibiting the same reactive group as the protein under study. It is seen that affinity-mediated rate-enhancement of protein modification is realized {{by the loss of}} activation entropy. On the assumption that attainment of maximal affinity-mediated rate-enhancement presents with an activation entropy of the protein modification reaction equal to zero, whereas the activation enthalpy of the reaction remains unchanged, it is shown that the value for maximal affinity-mediated rate-enhancement is equal to e-delta s++/R. Accordingly, protein modification reactions may be differentiated into (i) reactions the rate-enhancement of which (relative to the reaction of the same modifying agent with a model compound) is primarily entropy-controlled and (ii) reactions the rate-enhancement of which is primarily enthalpy-controlled. It is seen that modifying agents of low reactivity towards model compounds, but with a high, i. e. highly negative, activation entropy are better suited as prospective affinity-based protein-modifying agents, since the potential affinity-mediated rate-enhancement, and hence the selectivity, of these compounds is necessarily high. Kinetic and thermodynamic constants of the reaction of modifying agents with proteins, and with model compounds, and values of maximal affinity-mediated rate-enhancement, based on published data of the reaction of several modifying agents with model compounds, are presented and discussed...|$|E
40|$|Background: In people, hypercortisolism (HC) {{has been}} {{associated}} with acalculous cholecystitis and biliary dyskinesia, which may potentiate ascending biliary infections. In dogs, an association between HC and gallbladder disease recently has been documented, although the role of bacteria remains controversial. Furthermore, there is no information on the gallbladder bile microbial flora in healthy dogs. Objectives: To investigate the microbial flora in gallbladder bile in healthy dogs, the relationship between iatrogenic hyperadrenocorticism and bactibilia and possible changes in biliary microbial flora after cortisol withdrawal in dogs. Animals: Six control dogs and 6 dogs treated with hydrocortisone. Methods: Gallbladder bile obtained by percutaneous ultrasound-guided cholecystocentesis was cultured aerobically and anaerobically and examined cytologically before (d 0), during (d 28, d 56, d 84), and after (d 28 p, d 56 p, d 84 p) administration of hydrocortisone (8 mg/kg PO q 12 h). Results: In the control group, 2 / 42 bile cultures yielded bacterial growth (Enterococcus sp.; Escherichia coli on d 0) and 1 / 42 bile smears had cytological evidence of bacteria (d 28). In the HC group, 2 / 42 bile cultures yielded bacterial growth (Enterococcus sp. on d 28; Bacillus sp. on d 28 p) and 3 / 42 bile smears had cytological evidence of bacteria (d 84, d 84, d 28 p). All dogs remained healthy throughout the study period (168 d). Conclusions and Clinical Importance: Based on the results of conventional bacterial culture techniques, gallbladder bile of healthy dogs periodically may harbor bacteria, which {{do not appear to be}} clinically relevant. A 3 -month period of iatrogenic HC was not associated with bactibilia. A higher prevalence of bactibilia may be detected with <b>micromolecular</b> techniques...|$|E
30|$|In this work, a {{dithiocarbamate}} (DTC) resin {{prepared as}} a novel adsorbent {{for the removal}} of Co(II) from simulated wastewater was presented. DTC molecular group can strongly bind with various heavy metal ions and display high removal efficiency due to its strong tendency of sharing electrons between N, S elements and heavy metal ions (Bai et al. 2011). For example, Fan et al. (2014 a, b, c) prepared three different silica-supported ion-imprinted hybrid sorbents all functionalized with S, N-donor atoms for lead (II), cadmium (II) and lead (II) through the surface imprinting technique. The sorbents showed high adsorption for Pb(II) (54.9  mg g− 1), Cd(II) (29.1  mg g− 1) and Pb(II) (61.9  mg g− 1) within 30  min, respectively. In addition, Fan et al. (Fan et al. 2011) presented a Co(II)-imprinted silica gel sorbent with the same technique as mentioned above and the maximum adsorption capacities toward Co(II) was 35.2  mg g− 1 compared to 6.5  mg g− 1 which is the non-imprinted. Hence, <b>micromolecular</b> DTC is usually synthesized from carbon disulfide and amino compounds, including diethylenetriamine, triethylenetetramine, ethylenediamine, diethylamine, etc., under an alkaline environment (Stathi et al. 2010; Jones et al. 1980; Shaaban et al. 2013; Horvath and Barnes 1986). However, many limitations have also been found, such as being volatilizable, very expensive, not easily available, and toxic (Talebi et al. 2010; Ling et al. 2011). To tackle these problems, the DTC resin here was developed by grafting polyethyleneimine (PEI) onto chloromethylated polystyrene (CPS) beads (Gao et al. 2006) as the amino compound. To examine the adsorption capability, different simulated wastewater bodies with various Co(II) concentrations in the range of 40 – 320  mg L− 1 were tested. The maximum adsorption conditions of Co(II) have been identified {{and the nature of the}} adsorption process with respect to its kinetics and thermodynamic aspects were investigated.|$|E
