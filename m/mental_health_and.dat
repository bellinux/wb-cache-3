40|$|Research {{suggests}} that youth involved {{the juvenile justice}} system have trauma histories that are two times higher than the general youth population. Juvenile justice-involved youth also have high rates of <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> symptoms. Fewer studies have examined how trauma links to <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> symptoms among youth offenders, and even less research focuses on how <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> status <b>and</b> service delivery can impact their perceived likelihood for success. This study examines the effects of <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> screening <b>and</b> service delivery on perceived future criminal justice interactions— arrest and incarceration—among adjudicated youth (n= 7, 073) housed in correctional facilities. Secondary data were used to examine trauma histories, <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> needs, <b>and</b> <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> screening <b>and</b> service delivery. Significant relationships between traumatic events <b>and</b> <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> problems were found, along with relationships between <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> problems <b>and</b> <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> screening <b>and</b> service delivery. Most interestingly, results pointed to the strong inverse relationship between <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> service delivery <b>and</b> youth’s perceived likelihood for recidivism. These findings show the promise of juvenile justice systems appropriately responding to the <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> concerns of youth...|$|R

5|$|Among Wetherby's other accomplishments {{were the}} {{creation}} of a Department of <b>Mental</b> <b>Health</b> <b>and</b> the construction of fifteen hospitals and thirty health centers throughout the state. In 1952, he created the Youth Authority as a central point for the administration of services to delinquent children. He constructed new state prisons, modernized the probation and parole systems, and established a more orderly system of selecting grand and petit juries. He also oversaw some voting reform measures, including the provision of funds to purchase voting machines in areas where they were desired. He was not as successful in the area of government reform. He failed in his efforts to amend the state's constitution to allow the governor to succeed himself in office. He was also unable to win support for a plan to consolidate some of Kentucky's counties. In 1955, the state's voters approved a constitutional amendment granting suffrage to eighteen-year-olds over Wetherby's objections.|$|E

5|$|Since medical {{literature}} began to describe homosexuality, {{it has often}} been approached from a view that sought to find an inherent psychopathology as the root cause, influenced by the theories of Sigmund Freud. Although he considered bisexuality inherent in all people, and said that most have phases of homosexual attraction or experimentation, exclusive same-sex attraction he attributed to stunted development resulting from trauma or parental conflicts. Much literature on <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>and</b> lesbians centered on their depression, substance abuse, and suicide. Although these issues exist among lesbians, discussion about their causes shifted after homosexuality was removed from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual in 1973. Instead, social ostracism, legal discrimination, internalization of negative stereotypes, and limited support structures indicate factors homosexuals face in Western societies that often adversely affect their mental health.|$|E
5|$|The General Assembly was {{controlled}} by Democrats, but Nunn was able to pass most of his agenda. Despite a campaign promise not to raise taxes, when the outgoing Breathitt administration projected a shortfall of $24 million in the state budget, Nunn convinced the General Assembly to pass {{an increase in the}} motor vehicle license fee from $5.00 to $12.50 and raise the state sales tax from three percent to five percent. Nunn's budget focused on increased funding for education, <b>mental</b> <b>health,</b> <b>and</b> economic development. In the 1970 legislative session, the General Assembly enacted Nunn's proposals to eliminate taxes on prescription drugs and the use fee charged on vehicles transferred within families, but rejected his plans to reduce the income tax for low-income families and increase tax credits for the blind and the elderly.|$|E

Margaret Hodge, then children’s minister, had said that drug or alcohol use by parents, relatives and neighbours, together with other aspects of their behaviour, may be recorded. Government guidelines reveal that other information recorded may have included 'family routines', evidence of a 'disorgan-ised/chaotic lifestyle', 'ways in which the family’s income was used', signs of mental illness or alcohol misuse by relatives, and 'any serious difficulties in the parents’ relationship'.|$|E

5|$|Kirchner's health {{first became}} {{a topic of}} public concern in 2005 when Noticias {{magazine}} reported that she might suffer from bipolar disorder. Journalist Franco Lindner interviewed the psychiatrist who treated her without revealing his name. Journalist Nelson Castro investigated further and discovered that the psychiatrist was Alejandro Lagomarsino, who died in 2011. Lagomarsino was the leading specialist {{in the treatment of}} bipolar disorder in Argentina. Castro's investigation revealed that Kirchner was treated by Lagomarsino for a short period. He could not determine the length of her treatment or the medicine she received, or whether another psychiatrist continued treating her or not. Castro considers that some of her outlandish phrases or projects, and her frequent periods of hiding from public view, may be explained by the disorder's periods of mania and depression, as well as being a regular political strategy. Eduardo Duhalde said that Néstor Kirchner once confided in him that she had a bipolar disorder, while she was having a violent outburst. During the United States diplomatic cables leak it was revealed that Hillary Clinton questioned Kirchner's <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>and</b> asked the US embassy whether she was receiving treatment or not; she later apologized to Kirchner for those leaks.
