25|$|Naphthalene is {{the most}} {{abundant}} single component of coal tar. Although the composition of coal tar varies with the coal from which it is produced, typical coal tar is about 10% naphthalene by weight. In industrial practice, distillation of coal tar yields an oil containing about 50% naphthalene, along with twelve other aromatic compounds. This oil, after being washed with aqueous sodium hydroxide to remove acidic components (chiefly various phenols), and with sulfuric acid to remove basic components, undergoes fractional distillation to isolate naphthalene. The crude naphthalene resulting from this process is about 95% naphthalene by weight. The chief impurities are the sulfur-containing aromatic compound benzothiophene (<nbsp&2%), indane (0.2%), indene (<nbsp&2%), and <b>methylnaphthalene</b> (<nbsp&2%).

40|$|Three {{independent}} {{techniques were}} used to assess the biodegradation of monoaromatic hydrocarbons and low-molecular weight polyaromatic hydrocarbons in the alluvial aquifer at the site of a former cokery (Flémalle, Belgium). Firstly, a stable carbon isotope-based field method allowed quantifying biodegradation of monoaromatic compounds in situ and confirmed the degradation of naphthalene. No evidence could be deduced from stable isotope shifts for the intrinsic biodegradation of larger molecules such as <b>methylnaphthalenes</b> or acenaphthene. Secondly, using signature metabolite analysis, various intermediates of the anaerobic degradation of (poly-) aromatic and heterocyclic compounds were identified. The discovery of a novel metabolite of acenaphthene in groundwater samples permitted deeper insights into the anaerobic biodegradation of almost persistent environmental contaminants. A third method, microcosm incubations with 13 C-labeled compounds under in situ -like conditions, complemented techniques one and two by providing quantitative information on contaminant biodegradation independent of molecule size and sorption properties. Thanks to stable isotope labels, the sensitivity of this method was much higher compared to classical microcosm studies. The 13 C-microcosm approach allowed the determination of first-order rate constants for 13 C-labeled benzene, naphthalene, or acenaphthene even in cases when degradation activities were only small. The plausibility of the third method was checked by comparing 13 C-microcosm-derived rates to field-derived rates of the first approach. Further advantage of the use of 13 C-labels in microcosms is that novel metabolites can be linked more easily to specific mother compounds even in complex systems.

40|$|Designing {{automotive}} catalysts for {{the effective}} control of NOx, HC (Hydrocarbon) and CO (Carbon Monoxide) emissions under both lean and stoichiometric engine operation is a challenging task. The research {{presented in this}} thesis assesses the performance efficiency of a three-zone prototype catalytic converter in reducing exhaust emissions from a gasoline engine, operating in HCCI (Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition) and SI (Spark Ignition) mode under lean and stoichiometric conditions. The research was carried out using Jaguar V 6 engine operating in SI and HCCI mode using commercial unleaded gasoline fuel. The catalyst efficiency in reducing the three pollutant emissions {{is closely related to}} the exhaust gas conditions (e. g. temperature and space velocity), oxygen content and composition i. e.

The results show that hydrocarbon species formation in the combustion process and destruction over the catalyst is primarily dependent on the engine operation and combustion mode (i. e. HCCI or SI). Alkane concentrations were found to be higher in the HCCI mode, while alkene species were mainly found in the engine exhaust under SI mode.

The histidine residue of CYP 101 B 1 was mutated to phenylalanine {{with the aim of}} improving the activity of the enzyme for hydrophobic substrates. The H 85 F mutant lowered the binding affinity and activity of the enzyme for β-ionone and altered the oxidation selectivity. This variant also showed enhanced affinity and activity towards alkylbenzenes, styrenes and <b>methylnaphthalenes.</b> For example the rate of product formation for acenaphthene oxidation was improved sixfold to 245  nmol per nmol CYP per min. Certain disubstituted naphthalenes and substrates, such as phenylcyclohexane and biphenyls, were oxidised with lower activity by the H 85 F variant. Variants at H 85 (A and G) designed to introduce additional space into the active site so as to accommodate these larger substrates did not improve the oxidation activity.

We have introduced a new metric, the exposure relevant emission factor (EREF) that accounts for sorptive uptake and reemission to give the mass of individual ETS constituents available for exposure over a day in which smoking occurs. This paper describes month-long experiments to investigate sorption effects on EREFs and potential ETS exposures under habitual smoking conditions. Cigarettes were smoked in a 50 -m(3) furnished room over a 3 -h period 6 - 7 days per week, with continuous ventilation at 0. 3, 0. 6, or 2. 1 h(- 1). Organic gas concentrations were measured every few days over 4 -h "smoking", 10 -h "post-smoking" and 10 -h "background" periods. Concentration patterns of volatile ETS components including 1, 3 -butadiene, benzene and acrolein {{were similar to those}} calculated for a theoretical non-sorbing tracer, indicating limited sorption. Concentrations of ETS tracers, e. g. 3 -ethenylpyridine (3 -EP) and nicotine, and lower volatility toxic air contaminants including phenol, cresols, and naphthalene increased as experiments progressed, indicating mass accumulation on surfaces and higher desorption rates. Daily patterns stabilized after week 2, yielding a steady daily cycle of ETS concentrations associated with habitual smoking. EREFs for sorbing compounds were higher under steady cycle versus single-day smoking conditions by similar to 50 % for 3 -EP, and by 2 - 3 times for nicotine, phenol, cresols, naphthalene, and <b>methylnaphthalenes.</b> Our results provide relevant information about potential indirect exposures from residual ETS (non-smoker enters room shortly after smoker finishes) and from reemission, and their importance relative to direct exposures (non-smoker present during smoking).

Under those operating conditions, hydrogen transfer is not limiting and thermodynamics favours saturated products. The influence of sulphur present in the feed (200 to 1600 ppm S) was evaluated in the three major reactions involved in the hydroconversion process, i. e. hydrogenation, isomerisation and ring-opening reactions. Hydrogenation of 1 <b>methylnaphthalene</b> into methyltetralines is always rapid whatever the sulphur amount. Hydrogenation of methyltetralines into the corresponding methyldecalines becomes lower with increased sulphur content, whereas isomerization of methyltetralines into alkylindanes as well as ring-opening of methyltetralines into alkylbenzenes becomes favoured. A mechanism involving hydrogen spillover, as recently proposed in the literature, would also account for the present results...|$|E
40|$|During {{this time}} period, uptake {{experiments}} were performed at elevated temperatures up to 280 o C for the adsorptive diffusion of a coal asphaltene in 1 - <b>methylnaphthalene</b> onto alumina catalyst pellets. Model simulation {{results showed that}} a mathematical model incorporating diffusion and adsorption mechanisms satisfactorily fitted the adsorptive diffusion of coal asphaltenes onto the alumina catalyst in a fairly wide temperature range of 55 o C to 280 o C. The logarithm of the adsorption constant, obtained by simulating the experimental data with the model solution, {{was found to be}} linearly dependent on temperature. As temperature increased, the value of the adsorption constant decreased. On the other hand, the effective diffusivity of the asphaltene increased with temperature. These off-setting temperature dependencies resulting from the adsorption constant and the effective diffusivity compensated at least to some extent in the uptake process...|$|E
40|$|<b>Methylnaphthalene</b> <bived {{mesophase}} pitch was spun through Y- and cross- shaped nozzles {{of different}} lobe dimensions in temperature range of 280 to 295 °C by fixing the spinning rate to evaluate die-swelling phenomena which defonned cross-sectional shape and domain {{alignment of the}} carbon fiber. The higher temperature of spinning enhanced the refonnation through the lower viscosity. The thinner lobe emphasized the die-swelling through the larger shear rate, which reduces the viscosity, although the nozzles {{of the present study}} had the same cross-sectional area. Shape factors of the nozzle and fiber rescribe the extents of cause and results of die-swelling, respectively. Die-swelling is found to change the radial type alignment of the constituent domains to random order. The degrees of preferred orientation along the fiber axis were slightly influenced by die-swelling. The pressure in spinning and the nozzle shape were correlated to the reformation extent of the resultant fiber...|$|E
40|$|Closed {{landfills}} can be {{a source}} of VOC and odorous nuisances to their atmospheric surroundings. A self-designed cylindrical air flux chamber was used to measure VOC surface emissions in a closed industrial landfill located in Cerdanyola del Vallès, Catalonia, Spain. The two main objectives of the study were the evaluation of the performance of the chamber setup in typical measurement conditions and the determination of the emission rates of 60 different VOC from that industrial landfill, generating a valuable database that can be useful in future studies related to industrial landfill management. Triplicate samples were taken in five selected sampling points. VOC were sampled dynamically using multi-sorbent bed tubes (Carbotrap, Carbopack X, Carboxen 569) connected to SKC AirCheck 2000 pumps. The analysis was performed by automatic thermal desorption coupled with a capillary gas chromatograph/mass spectrometry detector. The emission rates of sixty VOC were calculated for each sampling point in an effort to characterize surface emissions. To calculate average, minimum and maximum emission values for each VOC, the results were analyzed by three different methods: Global, Kriging and Tributary area. Global and Tributary area methodologies presented similar values, with total VOC emissions of 237 ± 48 and 222 ± 46 g day− 1, respectively; however, Kriging values were lower, 77 ± 17 g day− 1. The main contributors to the total emission rate were aldehydes (nonanal and decanal), acetic acid, ketones (acetone), aromatic hydrocarbons and alcohols. Most aromatic hydrocarbon (except benzene, naphthalene and <b>methylnaphthalenes)</b> and aldehyde emission rates exhibited strong correlations with the rest of VOC of their family, indicating a possible common source of these compounds. B:T ratio obtained from the emission rates of the studied landfill suggested that the factors that regulate aromatic hydrocarbon distributions in the landfill emissions are different from the ones from urban areas. Environmental conditions (atmospheric pressure, temperature and relative humidity) did not alter the pollutant emission fluxesPeer ReviewedPostprint (published version...|$|R
40|$|Arthrobacter strain ATCC 33790, a {{pentachlorophenol}} (PCP) -metabolizer isolated by the author, {{has been}} recovered after 10 years of storage. The freeze-dried preparation grown on half-strength Trypticase Soy Broth adapted to utilize PCP within 1 week. Cultures grown on PCP-nutrient agar {{were found to}} utilize PCP in mineral salts medium within 2 - 3 days. The culture was prepared for continuous growth at pH 6. 5 by successive feeding of 100 - 110 mg solid aliquots of PCP to a 1 -l culture initially grown at pH 7. 4. Continuous culture growth at pH 6. 5 was possible on a mineral salts feed containing 1800 ppm PCP. Continuous cultures grown at pH 6. 7 on mineral salts feeds containing 500 and 340 mg PCP/l were especially efficient in removing PCP. Less than 4 mg PCP/l were detected in the effluent at dilution rates near washout. In batch culture studies at pH 6. 5 the PCP utilization kinetics {{were found to be}} similar at low PCP concentration to those at pH 7. 4 for the approximately same inoculum size. Utilization of 35 mg PCP/l was very slow at pH 6. 0. Growth rates at pH 6. 5 at controlled PCP concentration ranges of 5 - 35 and 75 - 115 mg/l were 0. 09 h- 1 and 0. 05 h- 1, respectively. The ability of strain ATCC 33790 to utilize PCP in mineral salts media containing naphthalene, <b>methylnaphthalenes,</b> and cresols was examined. Naphthalene, 1 -, and 2 -methylnaphthalenes at their solubility limit, and o- and m-cresols at 900 - 1000 mg/l prevented utilization of 80 - 90 mg PCP/l. PCP was rapidly removed from both commercial sand at 30 °C and from clay soil at room temperature. Estimated inoculum sizes of 6. 6 × 106, 6. 6 × 104, and 656 cells/g were found to be effective in removing approximately half the starting amount of PCP from sand in 3, 19, and 42 h, respectively. Nearly complete disappearance of extractable PCP was observed after 1 day in clay soil inoculated with 6 × 106 cells/g...|$|R
40|$|Laboratory {{smog chamber}} {{experiments}} {{have been carried}} out to investigate secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation from the photooxidation of naphthalene and its methyl analogs, 1 - and 2 -methylnaphthalene (1 -MN and 2 -MN, respectively). Laboratory smog chamber irradiations were conducted in a flow mode to ensure adequate collection of the aerosol at reasonably low reactant concentrations and in the presence and absence of nitrogen oxides. Phthalic acid and methyl analogs were identified following BSTFA derivatization of the aerosol extract. These compounds were examined to determine whether they could serve as reasonable molecular tracers to estimate the contributions of these precursors to ambient PM 2. 5. Measurements were also made to determine aerosol parameters from secondary organic aerosol from naphthalene, 1 -MN, and 2 -MN. A mass fraction approach was used to establish factors which could be applied to phthalic acid concentrations in ambient aerosols, assuming a negligible contribution from primary sources. Phthalic anhydride uptake (and hydrolysis) was tested and found to represent a moderate filter artifact in filter measurements with and without in-line denuders. This study provided the opportunity to examine differences using authentic standards for phthalic acid compared to surrogate standards. While the mass fraction based on a surrogate compounds was somewhat lower, the differences are largely unimportant. For naphthalene, mass fractions of 0. 0199 (recommended for ambient samples) and 0. 0206 were determined in the presence and absence of nitrogen oxides, respectively, based on phthalic acid standards. The mass fractions determined from the laboratory data were applied to ambient samples where phthalic acid was found and expressed "as naphthalene" since phthalic acid was found to be produced in the particle phase from other <b>methylnaphthalenes.</b> The mass fraction values were applied to samples taken during the 2005 SOAR Study in Riverside, CA and 2010 CalNex Study in Pasadena. In both studies an undetermined isomer of methylphthalic acid was detected in addition to phthalic acid. Laboratory experiment retention times and mass spectra suggest that the major precursor for this compound is 2 -MN. For the CalNex Study, SOC values for the 2 -ring precursor PAHs (as naphthalene) were found to range from below the detection limit to 20 ngC m − 3 which with the laboratory mass fraction data suggests an upper limit of approximately 1 μg m − 3 for SOA due to 2 -ring PAHs. Temporal data {{over the course of the}} one-month CalNex study suggest that primary sources of phthalic acid were probably negligible during this study period. However, the values must still be considered upper limits given a potential hydrolysis reaction or uptake of phthalic anhydride (subsequently hydrolyzed) onto the collection media...|$|R
