5000|$|Cell potency is a cell's {{ability to}} {{differentiate}} into other cell types.The more cell types a cell can differentiate into, the greater its potency.

5000|$|MSCs {{have a great}} {{capacity}} for self-renewal while maintaining their <b>multipotency.</b> Beyond that, there is little that can be definitively said. The standard test to confirm <b>multipotency</b> is differentiation of the cells into osteoblasts, adipocytes and chondrocytes as well as myocytes and neurons. MSCs have been seen to even differentiate into neuron-like cells, but there is lingering doubt whether the MSC-derived neurons are functional. The {{degree to which the}} culture will differentiate varies among individuals and how differentiation is induced, e.g., chemical vs. mechanical; and {{it is not clear whether}} this variation is due to a different amount of [...] "true" [...] progenitor cells in the culture or variable differentiation capacities of individuals' progenitors.

Proliferation of limbal stem cells maintains the cornea; for example, replacing cells that are lost via tears. Limbal stem cells also prevent the conjunctival epithelial cells from migrating onto the surface of the cornea.|$|E
5000|$|The largest NSC {{population}} in the brain {{is found in the}} SVZ. The SVZ is considered a micro-environment called a [...] "stem cell niche" [...] that retains the NSC's capacity of self-renewing and <b>multipotency.</b> Basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF2), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), Notch-1, sonic hedgehog (SHH), noggin, ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), and a soluble carbohydrate-binding protein, Galectin-1, are reported as factors that maintain such properties of NSC in stem cell niche. Like stem cells in SGZ, progenitor cells in SVZ also differentiate into neurons and form an intermediate cell called a transiently amplifying cell (TAC). A recent study revealed that beta-catenin signaling, Wnt β-catenin, regulates the differentiation of TAC.|$|E
5000|$|During {{the early}} {{development}} of a human, neural stem cells lie in the germinal layer of the developing brain, ventricular and subventricular zones. In brain development, multipotent stem cells (those that can generate different types of cells) are present in these regions, {{and all of these}} cells differentiate into neural cell forms, such as neurons, oligodendrocytes and astrocytes. A long-held belief states that the <b>multipotency</b> of neural stem cells would be lost in the adult human brain. However, it is only in vitro, using neurosphere and adherent monolayer cultures, stem cells that {{can be found in the}} adult mammalian brain that have shown mutipotent capacity, while the in vivo study is not convincing. Therefore, the term [...] "neural progenitor" [...] is used instead of [...] "stem cell" [...] to describe limited regeneration ability in the adult brain stem cell.|$|E
5000|$|Stem {{cells have}} always been a huge {{interest}} for scientists due to their unique properties that make them unlike any other cell in the body. Generally, the idea boils down to harnessing the power of plasticity and the ability to go from an unspecialized cell to a highly specialized differentiated cell. ESCs play an incredibly important role in establishing the vascular network that is vital for a functional circulatory system. Consequently, EPCs are under study to determine the potential for treatment of ischemic heart disease. [...] Scientists are still {{trying to find a way}} to definitely distinguish the stem cell from the progenitor. In the case of endothelial cells, it is even difficult to distinguish a mature EC from an EPC.

5000|$|... hTERT {{is often}} up-regulated in cells that divide rapidly, {{including}} both {{embryonic stem cells}} and adult stem cells. It elongates the telomeres of stem cells, which, as a consequence, increases the lifespan of the stem cells by allowing for indefinite division without shortening of telomeres. Therefore, it {{is responsible for the}} self-renewal properties of stem cells. Telomerase are found specifically to target shorter telomere over longer telomere, due to various regulatory mechanisms inside the cells that reduce the affinity of telomerase to longer telomeres. This preferential affinity maintains a balance within the cell such that the telomeres are of sufficient length for their function and yet, at the same time, not contribute to aberrant telomere elongation [...] High expression of hTERT is also often used as a landmark for pluripotency and <b>multipotency</b> state of embryonic and adult stem cells. Over-expression of hTERT was found to immortalize certain cell types as well as impart different interesting properties to different stem cells.|$|E
50|$|Neural {{stem cells}} (NSCs) {{in the brain}} must find a balance between {{maintaining}} their <b>multipotency</b> by self renewing and proliferating as opposed to differentiating and becoming quiescent. The PI3K/AKT pathway is crucial in this decision making process. NSCs are able to sense and respond {{to changes in the}} brain or throughout the organism. When glucose levels are high, insulin and therefore IGF is produced. This signaling activates the PI3K/AKT pathway which works to promote proliferation. In this way, when there is high glucose and abundant energy in the organism, the PI3K/AKT pathway is activated and NSCs tend to proliferate. When there are low amounts of available energy, the PI3K/AKT pathway is less active and cells adopt a quiescent state. This occurs, in part, when AKT phosphorylates FOXO, keeping FOXO in the cytoplasm. FOXO, when dephosphorylated, can enter the nucleus and work as a transcription factor to promote the expression of various tumor suppressors such as p27 and p21. These tumor suppressors push the NSC to enter quiescence. FOXO knockouts lose the ability for cells to enter a quiescent state as well as cells losing their neural stem cell character, possibly entering a cancer like state.|$|E

However, researchers utilize these cells to study the development of cancer cells {{in order to find}} more specific treatments. For developmental biologists, embryonal carcinoma, which is derived from teratocarcinoma, is a good object for developmental study. In 1982, McBurney and Rogers transplanted a 7.5 day mouse embryo into the testis to induce tumor growth. Cell cultures containing undifferentiatied stem cells were isolated from the primary tumor which have a euploid karyotype. These stem cells were named embryonal carcinoma P19 cells. These derived P19 cells grew rapidly without feeder cells and were easy to maintain. Moreover, the <b>multipotency</b> of P19 cells was then confirmed by injecting the cells into blastocysts of another mouse strain. The researchers found that there were tissues from all three germ layers growing in the recipient mouse. Based on their continuous studies, they further derived subtype cell lines from original P19 cells: P19S18, P19D3, P19RAC65 and P19C16. The difference between theses subtype cell lines is the ability to differentiate into neuronal cells or muscle cells in response to treatment with retinoic acid or DMSO, respectively.More recently, various studies generate cell lines that were initially derived from differentiated P19 cells. Due to the pluripotency of P19 cells, those new derived cell lines can be ectoderm, mesoderm and endoderm-like cells.|$|E
5000|$|Neural crest {{cells are}} a {{temporary}} group of cells unique to vertebrates {{that arise from}} the embryonic ectoderm cell layer, and in turn {{give rise to a}} diverse cell lineage—including melanocytes, craniofacial cartilage and bone, smooth muscle, peripheral and enteric neurons and glia. After gastrulation, neural crest cells are specified at the border of the neural plate and the non-neural ectoderm. During neurulation, the borders of the neural plate, also known as the neural folds, converge at the dorsal midline to form the neural tube. [...] Subsequently, neural crest cells from the roof plate of the neural tube undergo an epithelial to mesenchymal transition, delaminating from the neuroepithelium and migrating through the periphery where they differentiate into varied cell types. [...] The emergence of neural crest was important in vertebrate evolution because many of its structural derivatives are defining features of the vertebrate clade.

40|$|A {{fundamental}} question in stem cell biology concerns the regulatory strategies {{that control the}} choice between <b>multipotency</b> and differentiation. Drosophila blood progenitors or prohemocytes exhibit key stem cell characteristics, including <b>multipotency,</b> quiescence, and niche dependence. As a result, studies of Drosophila hematopoiesis have provided important insights into the molecular mechanisms that control these processes. Here, we show that E-cadherin is an important regulator of prohemocyte fate choice, maintaining prohemocyte <b>multipotency</b> and blocking differentiation. These functions are reminiscent {{of the role of}} E-cadherin in mammalian embryonic stem cells. We also show that mis-expression of E-cadherin in differentiating hemocytes disrupts the boundary between these cells and undifferentiated prohemocytes. Additionally, upregulation of E-cadherin in differentiating hemocytes increases the number of intermediate cell types expressing the prohemocyte marker, Patched. Furthermore, our studies indicate that the Drosophila GATA transcriptional co-factor, U-shaped, is required for E-cadherin expression. Consequently, E-cadherin is a downstream target of U-shaped in the maintenance of prohemocyte <b>multipotency.</b> In contrast, we showed that forced expression of the U-shaped GATA-binding partner, Serpent, repressed E-cadherin expression and promoted lamellocyte differentiation. Thus, U-shaped may maintain E-cadherin expression by blocking the inhibitory activity of Serpent. Collectively, these observations suggest that GATA:FOG complex formation regulates E-cadherin levels and, thereby, the choice between <b>multipotency</b> an...|$|E
40|$|In culture {{isolated}} {{bone marrow}} mesenchymal stem cells (more precisely termed skeletal stem cells, SSCs) spontaneously differentiate into fibroblasts, preventing {{the growth of}} large numbers of multipotent SSCs for use in regenerative medicine. However, the mechanisms that regulate the expansion of SSCs, while maintaining <b>multipotency</b> and preventing fibroblastic differentiation are poorly understood.

40|$|SummaryThe {{neural crest}} (NC) is an {{embryonic}} stem/progenitor cell population that generates a {{diverse array of}} cell lineages, including peripheral neurons, myelinating Schwann cells, and melanocytes, among others. However, there is a long-standing controversy as to whether this broad developmental perspective reflects in vivo <b>multipotency</b> of individual NC cells or whether the NC is comprised of a heterogeneous mixture of lineage-restricted progenitors. Here, we resolve this controversy by performing in vivo fate mapping of single trunk NC cells both at premigratory and migratory stages using the R 26 R-Confetti mouse model. By combining quantitative clonal analyses with definitive markers of differentiation, we demonstrate {{that the vast majority}} of individual NC cells are multipotent, with only few clones contributing to single derivatives.

40|$|The human {{placenta}} of different gestational ages is a readily available source for isolation of adult {{mesenchymal stem cell}} (MSC) for potential use in regenerative therapies. The chorionic villous region, the largest component of a placenta that interfaces with the maternal circulation, is {{a rich source of}} placental MSCs (PMSCs). To remain multipotent, PMSCs are best maintained in culture conditions that mimic the in vivo microenvironment. Insulin like growth factors (IGFs, IGF-I and -II) and oxygen tension are two of the most important microenvironmental factors in the placenta. They are of low concentration or tension respectively, at early gestation, and increase as pregnancy progresses. In this thesis, we investigated the role and cellular mechanisms by which IGFs and low oxygen tension determine PMSC fate. The main hypothesis is that the interaction between IGFs and oxygen tension determines PMSC fate towards self-renewal or differentiation. We used cell proliferation assay, immunoblotting, real-time PCR, and cell monolayer staining to evaluate the role of IGF and oxygen tension on PMSC <b>multipotency</b> and differentiation. We found that low oxygen tension was a major determinant of PMSCs proliferation and <b>multipotency,</b> and to delay differentiation. Also, PMSC response to IGF stimulation and low oxygen tension was gestational age dependent — preterm PMSCs being more multipotent and proliferative than term PMSCs. IGF-I and IGF-II promoted PMSC proliferation and <b>multipotency</b> via IGF-IR or IR, depending on oxygen tension. IGFs enhanced PMSC differentiation towards the osteogenic lineage which was transduced by ERK 1 / 2 and AKT signaling cascades. We conclude that IGFs and oxygen tension act synergistically or antagonistically, mimicking in vivo microenvironmental conditions, to determine PMSC fate towards <b>multipotency</b> or differentiation. The appropriate combination of IGFs and oxygen tension can be used to maintain stem cells in <b>multipotency,</b> or to be induced towards a specific progenitor cell lineage for successful use in tissue regeneration therapies...|$|E

Our earlier work demonstrated that Foxd 3 is required for maintenance of NC progenitors in the embryo. Here, we show that Foxd 3 mediates a fate restriction choice for multipotent NC progenitors with loss of Foxd 3 biasing NC toward a mesenchymal fate. Neural derivatives of NC were lost in Foxd 3 mutant mouse embryos, whereas abnormally fated NC-derived vascular smooth muscle cells were ectopically located in the aorta. Cranial NC defects were associated with precocious differentiation towards osteoblast and chondrocyte cell fates, and individual mutant NC from different anteroposterior regions underwent fate changes, losing neural and increasing myofibroblast potential.
