50|$|In {{recent years}} the concept of mission work has changed. This was due partly in the expense of sending a {{full-time}} missionary to a location, supporting them, and then returning them to the States. But, also {{we have found that}} the best people to teach a group is one of the group. So, the plan was to send a teacher to instruct the leaders in the polity and beliefs of the Seventh Day Baptists and allow them to pass the information along to the congregations. This worked very effectively. After a couple of visits to the country by the Executive Director of the Missionary Society an individual would visit them and take a couple of weeks to speak to them about the polity, beliefs, and structure of a Seventh Day Baptist conference. This leader would work with the leaders to formulate a <b>manual</b> <b>of</b> <b>procedure</b> for their conference. This manual would then be published and distributed to the churches so that the leaders could teach the congregation. The expense for this process is much lower and would enable one of the leaders within the country to do the teaching and leading of the conference {{to a better understanding of}} the work that is to be done.|$|E

40|$|Following the {{confirmation}} of Presbyterian government in the Church of Scotland in 1690, a number of {{attempts were made to}} codify the governance practices that were to be followed in the various ruling bodies of the church. A review of these attempts indicates a distinctive approach to governance based on detailed record keeping and the monitoring of activities based on these records. While the church never managed to agree on a complete <b>manual</b> <b>of</b> <b>procedure,</b> a review of responses to the proposals suggests substantial conformance with their main precepts. Not only did these precepts contribute to the consolidation of the Presbyterian settlement of 1690, they also provided a legalistic and systemic cast to organisational structures and practices. This then shaped a distinctive ‘culture of organisation’ which, in conjunction with other institutions such as education, provided to-hand resources for the widely noted Scottish competence in administration. A focus on administrative practices in their cultural and social context provides a basis for assessing claims to Scottish distinctiveness and influence...|$|E
