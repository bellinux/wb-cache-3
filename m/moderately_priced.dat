40|$|The {{economic}} fundamentals governing {{the development of}} the global economy {{over the next five years}} are likely to be more stable than in the eighties. The interest rate and the exchange rate of the dollar will be relatively low, mainly because of the weakness of the U. S. economy. Prices of raw materials, of crude oil in particular, are projected to rise only <b>moderately.</b> <b>Prices</b> in overall world trade will rise at a rate of about 3 percent from 1991 to 1996. The real interest rate for international debts will therefore not exceed 2 percent, a rate markedly lower than in the eighties. Under these conditions world-wide output could expand by 3 percent per year on average, world trade by 6 percent per year. The weakness of the international economy, recorded since the middle of 1991, constitutes a serious risk factor for the present forecast, however. If a world-wide stagnation or recession were to occur in 1992, medium-term growth would also be affected. Countries, which have contributed the most to overcoming international recessions, as for example the U. S., will no longer be in a position to play the role of a "locomotive".

25|$|Since the 1970s, {{the county}} has had in place a <b>Moderately</b> <b>Priced</b> Dwelling Unit (MPDU) zoning plan that {{requires}} developers to include affordable housing in any new residential developments that they construct in the county.

They conceived a plan to settle in Germany with Dorothy and Coleridge's wife, Sara, [...] "to pass the two ensuing years in order to acquire the German language, and to furnish ourselves with a tolerable stock of information in natural science". In September 1798, Wordsworth, Coleridge, and Dorothy travelled to Germany to explore proximate living arrangements, but this proved difficult. Although they lived together in Hamburg for a short time, the city was too expensive for their budgets. Coleridge soon found accommodations in the town of Ratzeburg in Schleswig-Holstein, which was less expensive but still socially vibrant. The impoverished Wordsworth, however, could neither afford to follow Coleridge nor provide for himself and his sister in Hamburg; the siblings instead moved to <b>moderately</b> <b>priced</b> accommodations in Goslar in Lower Saxony, Germany.|$|E

30|$|Based on {{the case}} of {{overseas}} Vietnamese who go back to their fatherland and use dental service, the current study investigates the effects of interaction quality between service providers and customers on different forms of service values, leading to positive WOM. The findings contribute to provide theoretical and empirical relations between service interaction and customer value in medical tourism, a less-researched topic in the literature of medical tourism. Particularly, the findings indicate that a high-quality interaction would strongly affect customer perception of quality value and social value and <b>moderately</b> affect <b>price</b> value. In turn, these three forms of value significantly affect positive WOM. By linking customer quality, social and price value with WOM, the present study suggests an effective way to promote this special form of medical service to immigrants living outside the country.|$|R

Levitt and Sons only built six models of house in Levittown, all single-family dwellings with lawns: the Levittowner, the Rancher, the Jubilee, the Pennsylvanian, the Colonial and the Country Clubber, with only modest exterior variations within each model. The homes were <b>moderately</b> <b>priced</b> and required only a low down payment. Construction of Levittown began in February 1952, soon after completion of Levittown, New York, located on Long Island. Levittown, Pennsylvania was the second [...] "Levittown" [...] built by William J. Levitt, who is often credited as {{the creator of the}} modern American suburb. To speed up construction, Levitt & Sons perfected a 26-step rationalized building method that was essentially an assembly line type of home building. The house remained stationary, while the construction workers moved from house to house. Each worker had one task such as pouring slabs, framing, installing electric sockets or installing washing machines. This highly regimented process enabled Levitt's workers to produce a finished house every 16 minutes. Construction of the homes commenced in 1952 and when completed in 1958, 17,311 homes were built.|$|E
2500|$|The Skycar I {{was first}} {{displayed}} at the spring 1931 Detroit Show. The aircraft was a two-seat high-wing monoplane, accommodating the occupants in tandem layout. It had an all-metal steel-tube frame covered with corrugated metal skin. Centre-line nose and tail-wheels plus a standard landing gear were fitted. The rear fuselage was constructed from an open framework carrying a single fin and rudder, inside which was located the rear pusher engine. The Sky Car was displayed with a Moorhouse engine (Alfred Moorhouse of Detroit, assignor to Packard Motor Car Company). Fuel was carried in two tanks in the leading portion of the central section of the engine housing, from where it was fed by gravity to the engine. At a later date the aircraft was fitted with twin booms carrying the single fin and rudder (see photo of preserved aircraft). The aircraft featured balanced pivoting outboard wingtips rather than ailerons. Stout attempted to design a simple aircraft that would have controls similar to early model Fords including the ignition switch and the starter button.

40|$|It {{is widely}} {{acknowledged}} that unmitigated risks provide a disincentive for otherwise optimal investments in modern farm inputs. Index insurance {{provides a means}} for managing risk without the burdens of asymmetric information and high transaction costs that plague traditional indemnity-based crop insurance programs. Yet many index insurance programs that have been piloted {{around the world have}} met with rather limited success, so the potential for insurance to foster more intensive agricultural production has yet to be realized. This study assesses both the demand for and the effectiveness of an innovative index insurance product designed to help smallholder farmers in Bangladesh manage risk to crop yields and the increased production costs associated with drought. Villages were randomized into either an insurance treatment or a comparison group, and discounts and rebates were randomly allocated across treatment villages to encourage insurance take-up and to allow for the estimation of the price elasticity of insurance demand. Among those offered insurance, we find insurance demand to be <b>moderately</b> <b>price</b> elastic, with discounts significantly more successful in stimulating demand than rebates. Farmers who are highly risk averse or sensitive to basis risk prefer a rebate to a discount, suggesting that the rebate may partially offset some of the implicit costs associated with insurance contract nonperformance. Having insurance yields both ex ante risk management effects and ex post income effects on agricultural input use. The risk management effects lead to increased expenditures on inputs during the aman rice-growing season, including expenditures for risky inputs such as fertilizers, as well as those for irrigation and pesticides. The income effects lead to increased seed expenditures during the boro rice-growing season, which may signal insured farmers’ higher rates of seed replacement, which broadens their access to technological improvements embodied in newer seeds as well as enhancing the genetic purity of cultivated seeds.
