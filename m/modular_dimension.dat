40|$|AbstractLet L be a lattice. A {{function}} f:L→R (usually called evaluation) is submodular if f(x∧y) +f(x∨y) ≤f(x) +f(y), supermodular if f(x∧y) +f(x∨y) ≥f(x) +f(y), and modular {{if it is}} both submodular and supermodular. Modular functions on {{a finite}} lattice form a finite dimensional vector space. For finite distributive lattices, we compute this (<b>modular)</b> <b>dimension.</b> This {{turns out to be}} another characterization of distributivity (Theorem  3. 9).

40|$|Let $G$ be a finitely {{generated}} pro-$p$ group, {{equipped with the}} $p$-power series. The associated metric and Hausdorff dimension function give rise to the Hausdorff spectrum, which consists of the Hausdorff dimensions of closed subgroups of $G$. In the case where $G$ is $p$-adic analytic, the Hausdorff dimension function is well understood; in particular, the Hausdorff spectrum consists of finitely many rational numbers {{closely linked to the}} analytic dimensions of subgroups of $G$. Conversely, it is a long-standing open question whether the finiteness of the Hausdorff spectrum implies that $G$ is p-adic analytic. We prove that the answer is yes, in a strong sense, under the extra condition that $G$ is soluble. Furthermore, we explore the problem and related questions also for other filtration series, such as the lower $p$-series, the Frattini series, the <b>modular</b> <b>dimension</b> subgroup series and quite general filtration series. For instance, we prove, for odd primes $p$, that every countably based pro-$p$ group $G$ with an open subgroup mapping onto 2 copies of the $p$-adic integers admits a filtration series such that the corresponding Hausdorff spectrum contains an infinite real interval.

40|$|Let K be a {{quadratic}} {{imaginary number}} field, let Kp^(infinity) {{the top of}} its p-class field tower for p an odd prime, and let G=Gal(Kp^(infinity) /K). It is known, due to a tremendous collection of work ranging from the principal results of class field theory to the famous Golod-Shafarevich inequality, that G is finite if the p-rank of the class group of K is 0 or 1, and is infinite if this rank is at least 3. This leaves the rank 2 case as the only remaining unsolved case. In this case, while finiteness is still a mystery, much is still known about G: It is a 2 -generated, 2 -related pro-p-group equipped with an involution that acts as the inverse modulo commutators, and is of one of three possible Zassenhaus types (defined in the paper). If such a group is finite, we will call it an interesting p-tower group. We further the knowledge on such groups by showing that one particular Zassenhaus type can occur as an interesting p-tower group only if the group has order at least p^ 24 (Proposition 8. 1), and by proving a succinct cohomological condition (Proposition 4. 7) for a p-tower group to be infinite. More generally, we prove a Golod-Shafarevich equality (Theorem 5. 2), refining the famous Golod-Shafarevich inequality, and obtaining as a corollary a strict strengthening of previous Golod-Shafarevich inequalities (Corollary 5. 5). Of interest is that this equality applies not only to finite p-groups but also to p-adic analytic pro-p-groups, a class of groups of particular relevance due to their prominent appearance in the Fontaine-Mazur conjecture. This refined version admits as a consequence that the sizes of the first few <b>modular</b> <b>dimension</b> subgroups of an interesting p-tower group G are completely determined by p and its Zassenhaus type, and we compute these sizes. As another application, we prove a new formula (Corollary 5. 3) for the Fp-dimensions of the successive quotients of dimension subgroups of free pro-p-groups...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{field of}} service modularity, unlike product modularity, is widely new {{area in the}} research. Therefore, {{there is not much}} {{knowledge}} about the modular service architecture. Therefore, this research tries to fill the research gap and find the key characteristics of the modular service architecture. The objective of the thesis is to create more understanding about the service modularity and the modular value chain structure. This research aims to describe the value chain structure {{from the perspective of the}} travel agency and link the roles and responsibilities of customer and suppliers to the modular value chain. To address the issue, comparative study with two companies with different level of modular service architecture is selected. The study is conducted as multiple-case study with semi-structured interviews and secondary data research. To analyze the data a theoretical framework is developed that helps to identify the <b>modular</b> service <b>dimensions</b> and the level of the service modularity. The findings suggest that the highly modular value chain has three important characteristics. The first one is the wide collaboration with customer and co-creation of service offerings. The second one is the long-term relationship with the suppliers. The final characteristic is the continuous two-way communication with its suppliers and customers that enables the responsive and flexible service structure. These findings are formulated as hypotheses that should be further tested with quantitative methods...|$|R

All strictly weakly integral (weakly integral but non-integral) modular categories of ranks $ 6 $ and $ 7 $ have dimension $ 4 m$, with $m$ an odd square free integer, so their classification is an application of our main result. The classification of rank $ 7 $ integral modular categories is facilitated by an analysis of two actions on modular categories: the Galois group of the field generated by the entries of the $S$-matrix and the group of isomorphism classes of invertible simple objects. The interplay of these two actions is of independent interest, and we derive some valuable arithmetic consequences from their actions.

Let A(W) = (A(W), V) be its associated hyperplane arrangement. In earlier work by the last two authors, we classified all supersolvable reflection arrangements. Extending this work, the aim of this note is to determine all supersolvable restrictions of reflection arrangements. It turns out that apart from the obvious restrictions of supersolvable reflection arrangements {{there are only a few}} additional instances. Moreover, in our previous work, we classified all inductively free restrictions A(W) ^X of reflection arrangements A(W). Since every supersolvable arrangement is inductively free, the supersolvable restrictions A(W) ^X of reflection arrangements A(W) form a natural subclass of the class of inductively free restrictions A(W) ^X. Finally, we characterize the irreducible supersolvable restrictions of reflection arrangements by the presence of <b>modular</b> elements of <b>dimension</b> 1 in their intersection lattice.

In Part II we provide a modular proof for an Apery-like integrality statement for solutions of Picard-Fuchs equations. We illustrate the theory on a worked example, giving explicit Fourier expansions of twisted modular forms and the equation of a Teichmueller curve in a Hilbert modular surface. In Part III we show that genus two Teichmueller curves are cut out in Hilbert modular surfaces by a product of theta derivatives. We rederive most of the known properties of those Teichmueller curves from this viewpoint, without using the theory of flat surfaces. As a consequence we give the modular embeddings for all genus two Teichmueller curves and prove that the Fourier developments of their twisted modular forms are algebraic up to one transcendental scaling constant. Moreover, we prove that Bainbridge's compactification of Hilbert modular surfaces is toroidal. The strategy to compactify can be expressed using continued fractions and resembles Hirzebruch's in form, but every detail is different.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{centered}} around {{the design of a}} grid-connected photovoltaic (PV) roof installation at a specific location in Oslo, Norway. The motivating factor in this study has been the growth of the solar industry globally, while there has been little to none larger PV investments in Norway. The objective is to investigate how much renewable PV energy that can be produced from the designed system, with an electrical focus. Factors such as the suns position during each day of the year, the shadings on modules, the electrical effect of shading and bypass diodes, and other factors influence the production of a PV installation. Due to the complexity of power production in a PV system, the simulation software PVsyst was used as support. A 3 D representation of the building and shading elements was constructed in the simulation program for shading calculation purposes. Meteorological data from local weather stations in Lier, &# 197;s and Blindern was compared with meteorological data provided by interpolation and satellite images. The distance between <b>modular</b> rows was <b>dimensioned</b> after a shading criterion so {{that there would be no}} shading from other modular rows during spring equinox (March 21 st). The modular tilt was adjusted (from the optimal tilt angle of 40 degrees) in order to reduce shading loss and improve the performance ratio of the system. The number of module and inverter types and manufacturers was limited to three different module types, and four different inverter series. The simulated production from the three best alternatives, based on performance ratio and production were compared with the energy consumption in the building. Simple economical evaluations of the three best alternatives have been performed using the simple payback method and life cycle costing. As a result of the limited area on the roof, the shading objects and the dimensioning criteria (maximize performance ratio and production of the system) it was found that the module tilt was 20 degrees. The modules in the system are directed towards geographical south, and there is a pitch distance of 2 meters between the module rows. The resulting three final alternatives were two polycrystalline alternatives and one monocrystalline alternative. The polycrystalline alternatives used the same REC modules and different inverters, one from Eltek and the other from SMA. The monocrystalline alternative was simulated with SunPower modules and SMA inverters. The installations have a simulated energy production of 22. 4, 22. 9 and 31. 0 MWh/year, which would cover the average energy consumption of a household in Norway (20. 4 MWh/year). However, the installation will only contribute to reduce the energy consumption in the six storey commercial building by approximately 1 % per year. Comparing the simulated productions and the consumption in 2011, it is found that the installation will not result in a surplus of energy which could have been injected into the grid. The installation will therefore not change the buildings customer status to a surplus customer (plusskunde). With the simplified economical evaluation it is found that the energy from the PV installation will cost more than the energy agreement of today and it is triple the yearly average market price of electricity the last three years. The polycrystalline alternative with SMA inverters was the least expensive alternative of the three and the polycrystalline alternative with highest production. The monocrystalline alternative gave best simulated production and performance ratio of the three alternatives, but was the most expensive alternative. </p...|$|R
