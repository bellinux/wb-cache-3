500|$|Introspection {{was also}} listed {{as one of}} the {{foundational}} themes prevalent on the album, along with [...] "genuine statements of personal and careerist reflection scattered among the posturing of 'Bitch I'm Madonna' and 'Unapologetic Bitch'" [...] according to Slant Magazines Sam C. Mac as well as her [...] "obsessive self-regard". Madonna explained to Jon Pareles of The New York Times that although she has never looked back at her past endeavors, reminiscing about it felt right for Rebel Heart. [...] "And it's bittersweet for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> that. It just seemed like a time where I wanted to stop and look back. It's kind of like survivor guilt. How did I make it and they didn't?" [...] During the album's development phase, she became comfortable expressing her ideas in front of a few people, comparing it to: [...] "writing your diary in front of somebody and reading it out loud... It was almost like an acting exercise, you know, just putting myself in a room and letting ideas flow even if I didn't feel so connected to the people".|$|E
2500|$|On June 15, 2008, Edwards {{stepped back}} from his initial {{outright}} denial {{of interest in the}} position of the Vice President, saying, [...] "I'd take anything he asks <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> seriously, but obviously this is something that I've done and it's not a job I'm seeking." [...] On June 20, 2008, The Associated Press reported that according to a member of the Congressional Black Caucus, the names of Edwards and Sam Nunn were on Obama's vice presidential shortlist. Ultimately, then-Senator Joe Biden of Delaware was tapped to become Obama's running mate.|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't be solemn, Rose. It fidgets <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> life-times, and respecting, and {{all those}} {{responsible}} things. I'm not used to it, and I don't {{know how to do}} it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There'll {{have to be}} a change," [...] he said. [...] "Dick's {{accounts}} {{have given}} <b>me</b> something <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about.</b> I believe I'm beginning to understand now how his money went." ...|$|R
60|$|HE. Go on. Go on quickly. Give <b>me</b> {{something}} <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about,</b> or I will--I will--[he suddenly snatches up her fan and {{it about}} to break it in his clenched fists].|$|R
6000|$|... "Some day I'll {{come back}} and be your pupil," [...] Julien promised. [...] "You're a good fellow, David. You've given <b>me</b> {{something}} <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about,</b> at any rate, something <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> besides my own misfortunes." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's no use {{blinking}} facts, Chris. I've lived a {{long time}} in the world; I've seen things pretty well as they are; and now there's not much left for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> but you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Could I ever be {{well enough}} again? Oh, don't tell <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> it! The one thing I asked for before I die {{has been given}} me, and now I know he is free, I will--will not set my mind on {{anything}} else.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Hopkins it was. I did {{not like}} telling him, I {{had a feeling that}} in some way it was against the rules to tell him, but I did. He was walking part of the way home with me; he was talkative, and if we had not talked about the enchanted garden we should have talked of {{something}} else, and it was intolerable to <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> any other subject. So I blabbed.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, {{we must go}} this morning," [...] said Mrs. Archibald, quickly. [...] "We must go. We really cannot {{wait until}} any of those people come here. It makes <b>me</b> nervous <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm quite ready, thanks," [...] I {{answered}} slowly, for {{his words}} and manner had given <b>me</b> something <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about.</b> [...] "If you don't mind, I should like to be getting away. It's a long way, you know." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'She {{could not}} know he did not deserve it,' said the young bride, ready to resent it for her husband, since his brother did not, then again excusing her mother. 'It was all her care for me, dear mamma! She told <b>me</b> not <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> it; but I could not help it! Indeed I could not!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But I can't {{make the}} effort. Indeed, I don't know why I should. It seems natural to <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> him, and I don't suppose {{it can be}} very wrong. When you have had so deep an {{interest}} in a person, you can't drop him all of a sudden." [...] Then there was again silence, and after a while Lily took up her novel. She made that effort of which her mother had spoken, but she made it altogether in vain. [...] "I declare, Bell," [...] she said, [...] "it's the greatest rubbish I ever attempted to read." [...] This was specially ungrateful, because Bell had recommended the book. [...] "All the books have got to be so stupid! I think I'll read Pilgrim's Progress again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't know, Frank, I {{have never}} {{thought much about}} it. I don't think I should choose {{anywhere}} near Weymouth, and I would rather go to a flatter country, and a better wooded one. If I bought land, I should like to have land that I could cultivate myself, so as to give me an interest in it, and I should like, after a time, {{to be on the}} bench, which would give one a good deal of occupation. I suppose I shall marry some day, and so would prefer to be within reach of a town. I should think, from what you say, the country round Canterbury must be pretty. There is a garrison there, Dover is within reach, and it is a good deal more handy for getting up to town than it is from here. However, as you say, there is plenty of time for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> that." ...|$|E
60|$|After thus {{drinking}} to his heart's content, {{and in his}} dainty fashion, condescending to take {{a little}} food, the winged horse began to caper to and fro, and dance as it were, out of mere idleness and sport. There never was a more playful creature made than this very Pegasus. So there he frisked, {{in a way that it}} delights <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about,</b> fluttering his great wings as lightly as ever did a linnet, and running little races, half on earth and half in air, and which I know not whether to call a flight or a gallop. When a creature is perfectly able to fly, he sometimes chooses to run, just for the pastime of the thing; and so did Pegasus, although it cost him some little trouble to keep his hoofs so near the ground. Bellerophon, meanwhile, holding the child's hand, peeped forth from the shrubbery, and thought that never was any sight so beautiful as this, nor ever a horse's eyes so wild and spirited as those of Pegasus. It seemed a sin to think of bridling him and riding on his back.|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps not," [...] she assented, [...] "yet I {{suppose that}} there is not one of us who knows as much of his neighbour's life as he imagines he does. Good afternoon, Mr. Hurd! My visit has given <b>me</b> {{something}} <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about.</b> I may send for you to come to the house before I go away." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Locker," [...] said Olive, {{speaking}} very pleasantly, [...] "if you {{had come}} <b>to</b> <b>me</b> to-day and {{had asked me}} for a decision based upon what you had already said <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> I <b>think</b> I might have settled the matter. But after what you have just told me, I can not answer you now. You give <b>me</b> things <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about,</b> and I must wait." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I see that,' said Lance; 'but as, by good luck, I'm No. 8, it can't do <b>me</b> much harm <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> it, and I don't see why {{the others}} should not.' ...|$|R
50|$|I {{never thought}} about that question. After Nebe {{told me that he}} had orders to kill the mental {{patients}} in his area, there was nothing for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about.</b> After all, mental patients were also killed in the Reich.|$|E
5000|$|As he matured as a scientist, {{he began}} to feel the {{increasing}} need for field experimentation. Jaggar wrote at this time, [...] "Whereas small scale experiments in the laboratory helped <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> the details of nature...there remained the need to measure nature itself." ...|$|E
5000|$|Author Toni Morrison, {{the first}} African-American {{woman to win}} the Nobel Prize for Literature (1993), worked for twenty years as {{a senior editor at}} the New York City Headquarters of Random House. Morrison said: [...] "My work {{requires}} <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> how free I can be as an African-American woman writer in my genderized, sexualized, wholly racialized world." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't know," [...] she said, looking down; [...] "he or {{his books}} made <b>me</b> afraid <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> it, and like {{to laugh at}} some things-—no, I never did before you. You hushed me on the very borders {{of that kind of}} flippancy, and so you don't guess how horrid I am, or have been, for you have made things true and real <b>to</b> <b>me</b> again." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It gave <b>me</b> {{something}} <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> and I have no' come to {{the bottom}} o' it yet. It's possible the insurance was effected some time ago, before Dick's weakness had developed. His parents were sound and it was long before we suspected there was anything wrong with him. However, I had {{an interview with the}} company's local agent and afterward with the Edinburgh manager." ...|$|R
3000|$|... “I {{think the}} regular {{behavior}} {{of people is}} not <b>to</b> <b>think</b> before doing something. Looks like the natural thing {{to do would be}} to start writing the code (even because of the internal pressure). (...) A few people think before starting. With TDD, you are obligated <b>to</b> <b>think,</b> TDD makes you stop and think, design. It is not natural for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> before <b>about</b> doing something, but TDD makes me do it.” [...]...|$|R
5000|$|... “To me, {{performance}} {{studies is}} a discipline that {{enables you to}} radically contextualize how {{we think about the}} production of culture and, as a black feminist scholar it enables <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> the body and the corporeal as being central to our understanding of cultural production. So, what is performance studies? It’s thinking about embodiment as somehow enriching our understanding of text”.|$|E
5000|$|Nacro {{has stated}} that her ideas {{surrounding}} the problems of extramarital affairs in Puk Nini came from her male colleagues at Institut d'Education Cinématographique de Ouagadougou (INAFEC). [...] "Because {{no matter what we}} say about African life today, there is a crisis among couples that is alarming. It is necessary, at least for <b>me,</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> the relationship between men and women." ...|$|E
50|$|The signs, whether {{free-standing}} or {{attached to}} walls, {{reminded me of}} inscriptions, and this led <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> the inscriptional origins of Roman caps and the everlasting problem of reconciling capitals with lowercase. For me, {{the moment when the}} first true synthesis occurred was in the type of De Aetna. This led me in turn to the Beinecke Library to pore over their copy of the book and its type—the archetype of Roman type for me.|$|E
40|$|Extract] The {{question}} of what lawyers wear is in the news again since the Family Court of Australia has announced that judges have new robes, it will dispense with wigs, {{and there is a}} new dress code for lawyers appearing before it. The Family Court changes caused <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> again <b>about</b> the reason behind court dress – and others too, as evidenced by an animated discussion on Twitter following the Court's announcement...|$|R
40|$|As all the {{graduates}} {{who have gone}} before me know from personal experience, {{it would be impossible}} to successfully navigate graduate school without the help and support of an army of people. In my case, I have many people to thank. I have been incredibly fortunate to have a committee comprised of people with enormous intellect, varied strengths, and good humor. My advisors, Christopher Federico and Eugene Borgida, have guided and supported me throughout my education. When it comes to my dissertation specifically, I have to thank Chris especially for challenging <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> carefully <b>about</b> my hypotheses, methodology and analyses. Every quantitative researcher should be so lucky as to have a stats genius for an advisor. His seemingly limitless knowledge awed me on countless occasions, and most certainly saved my experiment in chapter 4. I must thank Gene, in particular, for reminding <b>me</b> <b>to</b> always <b>think</b> <b>about</b> the big picture, including both the theoretical and real-world implications of all of my research. He has an impressive ability to cut through academic bureaucracy, which I benefited from numerous times. Marti Gonzales, although not my official advisor, served as an academic (and life) mentor throughou...|$|R

[...] And then Newman was silent a moment, hesitating, yet {{thinking}} rapidly; he wished to make his point, and yet to do so forced him to speak out {{in a way that was}} disagreeable to him. Nevertheless he continued, addressing himself to old Madame de Bellegarde, [...] "I will tell you my project; perhaps you can help <b>me.</b> I want <b>to</b> take a wife." ...|$|R
5000|$|Discussing her {{educational}} choices with Business Week in 2004, {{she said}} [...] "When I was at Simmons College, I had this great professor -- Margaret Hennig. She {{was the one}} who encouraged <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> business and apply to Harvard Business School. She and Ann Jardim wrote the first book on women in business, called The Managerial Woman, and founded the Simmons Graduate School of Business. I applied to Harvard Business School my senior year." ...|$|E
5000|$|Under Salman, Riyadh became [...] "one of {{the richest}} cities in the Middle East" [...] and an {{important}} place for trade and commerce. There were also infrastructural advances including schools, universities and sports stadiums. About the province, he said [...] "Every village or town in the Riyadh Region is dear to me, and holds {{a special place in}} my heart... I witnessed every step taken by the city of Riyadh, and for this reason it is difficult for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> being far away from Riyadh." ...|$|E
5000|$|During {{his junior}} year in college, he told his father he was quitting school and his father locked him naked, wrapped in a paper towel diaper, in the ranch office {{restroom}} for six hours. Zinn's father was giving his son a lesson about {{what it meant to}} cut short his education. [...] "He was saying, 'Well, if you're going to quit school, you're going out in the world the way you came in.' He wanted <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> living with decisions," [...] Zinn said. Ray Zinn changed his mind and finished college.|$|E
5000|$|Spribille credits Goward {{with having}} [...] "a huge {{influence}} on my thinking. essays gave <b>me</b> license <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> lichens in unorthodox way and freed <b>me</b> <b>to</b> see the patterns I {{worked out in}} Bryoria with my co-authors." [...] Even so, [...] "one {{of the most difficult}} things was allowing myself to have an open mind to the idea that 150 years of literature may have entirely missed the theoretical possibility that there would be more than one fungal partner in the lichen symbiosis." [...] Spribille says that academias emphasis on the canon of what others have established as important is inherently limiting.|$|R
40|$|Three years ago, Tami Miller {{challenged}} <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> formally <b>about</b> “the {{concept of}} space as creative grounds for enlivenment and immersion,” and today’s talk revisits {{part of the}} lecture I gave here in 2013. 3 The ideas presented then — as now — are grounded in my university training, research and teaching in the interrelated disciplines of geography, design studies, landscape architecture, community and regional planning, and sociology. While mostly skipping over the concept of “time” (that’s quite another discussion), I will review five spatial constructs and related ideas useful in our work as docents...|$|R
40|$|Someone {{once asked}} why I {{published}} so much. I {{did not consider}} myself a born writer, so it made <b>me</b> pause <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> it, especially because it took 27 iterations of my manuscript {{to be ready for}} my fi rst publication (Scogna & Smalley, 1979) (and that was in the days before computers when each version had to be completely retyped) ! I realized I wrote for my current and future pa-tients and because I wanted to improve cancer care. When I started my career as a cancer nurse more than 30 years ago, many of my patients died.
