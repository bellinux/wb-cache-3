40|$|Abstract: The {{objective}} {{of the study is}} to demonstrate an effect of <b>manual</b> <b>feeding</b> on the level of farmer’s exposure to airborne contaminants in the confinement nursery pig house. The levels of all the airborne contaminants besides respirable dust, total airborne fungi and ammonia were significantly higher in the treated nursery pig house with feeding than the control nursery pig house without feeding. Although there is no significant difference in respirable dust and total airborne fungi between the treatment and the control, their concentrations in the treated nursery pig house were also higher than the control nursery pig house. The result that the level of ammonia in the treated nursery pig house is lower than the control nursery pig house would be reasoned by the mechanism of ammonia generation in the pig house and adsorption property of ammonia to dust particles.

5000|$|Engine lathe is {{the name}} applied to a {{traditional}} late-19th-century or 20th-century lathe with automatic feed to the cutting tool, as opposed to early lathes which were used with hand-held tools, or lathes with <b>manual</b> <b>feed</b> only. The usage of [...] "engine" [...] here is in the mechanical-device sense, not the prime-mover sense, as in the steam engines which were the standard industrial power source for many years. The works would have one large steam engine which would provide power to all the machines via a line shaft system of belts. Therefore, early engine lathes were generally 'cone heads', in that the spindle usually had attached to it a multi-step pulley called a cone pulley designed to accept a flat belt. Different spindle speeds could be obtained by moving the flat belt to different steps on the cone pulley. Cone-head lathes usually had a countershaft (layshaft) {{on the back side}} of the cone which could be engaged to provide a lower set of speeds than was obtainable by direct belt drive. These gears were called back gears. Larger lathes sometimes had two-speed back gears which could be shifted to provide a still lower set of speeds.|$|E

40|$|Circular {{saw blades}} are used {{exclusively}} for cut-off work, ranging from small <b>manual</b> <b>feed</b> operations, up to very large power fed saws commonly used for sectioning stock {{as it comes}} from a rolling mill or other manufacturing processes for long products. The teeth profile, as well as the tooth configuration are of fundamental importance for the blade performances; through a combination of blade rigidity and grinding wheel condition a good quality surface finish is attained for tools of commercial standard. The materials used for the production of circular saw blades are ranging from high speed steel to cemented carbides. In particular, cemented carbides, being characterized by high hardness and strength, are used in applications where materials with high wear resistance and toughness are required. The main constituents of cemented carbides are tungsten carbide and cobalt. Tungsten carbide imparts the alloys the necessary strength and wear resistance, whereas cobalt contributes to the toughness and ductility of the alloys. The WC-Co alloys are tailored for specific applications by the proper choice of tungsten carbide grain size and the cobalt content. The grain size of the tungsten carbide in WC-Co varies from about 40 μm to around 0. 3 μm, the cobalt content from 3 to 30 wt%. The coarse grained hard metals are mainly used in mining applications, the smallest grain size being about 3 μm and the minimum cobalt content 6 wt%. The grain size of tungsten carbide in the metal cutting industry, as well as for universal applications lies in the range of 1 - 2 μm. However, with the advent of near net shape manufacturing and thin walled components, the use of submicron carbide is growing, since their high compressive strength and abrasive wear resistance can be used to produce tools with a sharp cutting edge and a large positive rake angle. In this paper, a general overview on the actual trends in the choice of the best material when cutting special alloys will be presented and discussed. Based on the recent and past literature some examples of their up-to-date application, such as circular saws used to cut stainless steels and some high strength alloys, are talk ove...|$|E

At the landing the wood has been differentiated in two types.

40|$|There is {{a global}} move from {{individual}} to group housing of gestating sows. In the European Union, individual gestating stalls will be banned by 2013. Just like in other industrialized regions, these stalls have been the standard housing system for intensively kept sows from the 1960 s onward in the Flemish region of Belgium. Because the socioeconomic consequences for the pig industry may be far-reaching and because farmer attitude may influence {{the realization of the}} hoped-for improvement in animal welfare in practice, we conducted a survey from 2003 until 2009 among representative samples of Flemish pig producers every 2 yr. The share of farms with group housing increased from 10. 5 % in 2003 to 29. 8 % in 2007, but then dropped to 24. 6 % in 2009. It appears that after 2005 users of old group housing systems in particular stopped farming. Because sow herd size increased more on farms with vs. without group housing and because the proportion of the herd that was group-housed also tended to increase between 2003 to 2009, the change to group housing took place faster when expressed {{at the level of the}} sow (from 9. 1 % in 2003 to 34. 1 % in 2009) instead of farm. The percentage of farmers planning to convert to group housing within 2 yr was 4. 1 % in 2003, and 6 to 7 % thereafter. These were typically young farmers (P = 0. 006) with a large sow herd (P < 0. 001) and with a likely successor (P = 0. 03). Free access stalls were the most common group housing system (31 % of farms, 37 % of sows). Their popularity is expected to increase further at the expense of electronic feeding stations, ad libitum feeding, and stalls/troughs with <b>manual</b> <b>feed</b> delivery. User satisfaction was generally high but depended on whether or not all gestating sows were kept in group (P < 0. 001), the provisioning of environmental enrichment (P = 0. 057), and the age (P = 0. 012) and type (P = 0. 016) of system. The main criteria for choosing a certain group housing system were the investment costs and sow health and welfare. The importance of economic reasons (P = 0. 007) and type of labor (P = 0. 043) decreased with the age of the system. In 2003 and 2005 the main reason for not having converted to group housing was that farmers would stop keeping sows by 2013. In 2007 and 2009 the reasons mainly concerned uncertainty about the future and maximally delaying the conversion.

Susuzlandırma aşamalarında kullanılan yüksek oranda flokülantın kömür yıkama maliyetleri üzerindeki etkisi oldukça önemlidir. Bu sebeple, özellikle su problemlerinin yaşandığı Çin, Avustralya ve donma probleminin olduğu Rusya gibi birçok önemli kömür üreticisi ülkede, son zamanlarda kuru kömür üretimi üzerine çalışmalar başlatılmıştır.

Minimum akışkanlaştırma hava hızı belirlendikten sonra, optimum akışkanlaştırma hava hızının tespiti için, zenginleştirme deneyleri gerçekleştirilmiştir. Akışkanlaştırma hava hızının nem oranına bağlı olarak değiştiği, nem oranı arttıkça akışkanlaştırma hava hızının da arttığı belirlenmiştir.

Coal {{enrichment}} processes or so-called coal washing are usually done in water medium. A {{vast majority of}} washing processes are wet using the separation medium of water; so {{the amount of water}} used in such processes is considerable. As a result, there are problems in dewatering of both produced clean coal and tailings in economic and environmental terms. Moreover, flocculation agents in high dosage used in dewatering processes increase the production costs. In the light of these facts, {{there is a tendency to}} processing of coal in dry basis and thus researchers have started on this issue especially in countries such as China and Australia, and in cold countries where there is icing problems like Russia; in all these countries water resource problems are acute. There is a great deal of work to make the dry beneficiation of coal competitive with conventional wet beneficiation processes. It is important to reveal the applicability of this method in the utilization of Turkish coals. Some technological measures and online data collection systems as well as an optimum process design for specific coal types are required to make this competition realistic as the physical properties of coal and its associated minerals play a major role on the separation efficiency especially in dry coal processing. Dry beneficiation techniques for coal processing such as hand picking, optical or X-Ray sorting, crushing size classification (accelerator) air jigs, air tables, FGX technologies, Akaflow aerodynamic separator, Tribo-electrostatic separator, air-dense medium fluidized bed, electrostatic separation and etc. have many advantages over wet processes in terms of economic and environmental concerns. Pneumatic beneficiations such as air jigs and air-dense medium fluidized bed have been commercialized and being applied in many countries. The efficiency of these processes basically depend on the difference in characteristics of coal and gang minerals such as density, particle size, shape factors, magnetic and electro static susceptibility. In gravity based dry processing, stratification of coal is achieved through fluidizing and pulsating air, vibration and an oscillating deck in gravity based dry separators. There are a number of studies that show successful use of gravity based dry processing for coal cleaning indicating that dry beneficiation techniques can be well adapted to coals with different characteristics. In addition to coal processing, these dry processing methods are also open to beneficiation of different minerals such as sand, ferrous minerals, etc. or coal-like materials such as leonardite. In some applications, gravity based dry processing methods were also developed with modified system using different dense media such as sand, magnetite, magnetite fly ash, magnetic pearl and paigeite in separation of both inorganics, pyrite, and Hg. It was also reported that for the optimal separation of these impurities, using air table or fluidized bed separators, the operational parameters such as vibration amplitude, pulsation frequency, air volume, superficial air velocity, transverse angle, longitudinal angle and also coal properties like size and shape factor should be controlled carefully. Among these operational  parameters, pulsation frequencies and superficial air velocity were the most important in  governing the density based stratification and separation of the coal particles. In a fluidized bed system, a pack of solids is converted into a ﬂuidized bed by lifting action of air passing through it. Thus, three stages can be identiﬁed in the process of ﬂuidizing a bed of solids based on the velocity of air ﬂow through it; (i) ﬁxed or static bed, where the particles are in direct contact with each other, supporting each other's weight, (ii) expanded/ﬂuidized bed or particulate ﬂuidization where the particles have a mean free distance between particles and the particles are supported by the drag force of the ﬂuid, and (iii) mobilized bed. In fixed bed conditions, the particles remain in stationary contact whereas they are in free motion in a fluidized bed. When the fluid is passed upward through an unrestrained bed of particles, the bed will initially expand slightly to take up a loose packed arrangement. If the flow is increased, the pressure drop across the bed increases. Eventually the pressure drop equals the force of gravity on the particles (weight of the particles) and the particles begin to move. During this period, the porosity increases and the pressure drop rise more slowly than before due to the net effect of increased porosity and velocity. The bed is in extremely loose condition with the particles still in contact. The bed is unstable, the particles begin to lose contact and then adjust their position to present as little resistance to the flow as possible. With further increase on air velocity, the particles are separated and true or complete fluidization begins. By the time this position is reached, all particles are in motion and beyond that stiuation, the bed continues to expand and the particles move in a more rapid and independent motion. The pressure drop across the particles bed reaches a threshold, referred to as the point of incipient fluidization or minimum fluidization velocity. At that sitiution, all of the particles have been entrained in the fluid and pneumatic conveying exists. Dry beneficiation of the tested coals was performed through a Lab scale Allair Jig. Allair jig facility consisits of feed, separation (jigging) and powder filtering units. The fresh run of mine (ROM) coals were fed into a <b>manual</b> <b>feed</b> chute associated with belt conveyor and accumulated in the second feed chute where the feed rate was controlled by the stargates. Following the stratification of the feed in jigging cell by the fluidizing air from the fluidizing and pulsed air production and distribution mechanism towards the bottom part, the lighter coal particles floated and discharged automatically from the channel while the discharge of the dense materials through separated channel is controlled by the stargates by varying the rotational speeds. During stratification, a limited amount of powder is ventilated by the filter unit through the ventilation pipe. During the stratification, the operational conditions are adjusted by the control panel. On separation, pressure drops, Δp, for both part of the jigging cells were measured based on the fluidizing air rate by U-tube manometer to determine the minimum fluidizing air velocities, Umf, Umfa, Umf-cohesive. In this study, coal samples from Soma region of Turkey were used in the experiments. Coal samples of - 15, - 15 + 4, and - 15 + 1 mm in size were subjected to Allair jigging process. Samples of various moisture contents were cleaned in different pulsation amplitudes and air speeds. The effect of air speed on bedding and layering (fixed/fluid bed) and the impact of pressure difference was investigated. For each pulsation amplitude, particle size, and coal moisture content a minimum fluidizing air speed is introduced. In Soma-Imbat coal samples, for applied pulsation amplitude of 120, 180, 240, and 300 rpm (2, 3, 4, and 5 s- 1) the pressure differences in bedding were measured. After finding minimum fluidizing air speed, coal cleaning experiments were done to determine the optimum air speed. The effect of air speed on bedding and layering (fixed/fluid bed) and the impact of pressure difference was investigated. For each pulsation amplitude, particle size, and coal moisture content a minimum fluidizing air speed was introduced. In Soma-Imbat coal samples, for applied pulsation amplitude of 120, 180, 240, and 300 rpm (2, 3, 4, and 5 s- 1) the pressure differences in bedding were measured. After finding minimum fluidizing air speed, coal cleaning experiments were done to determine the optimum air speed. The effect of controlling product discharging system speed on bedding was also investigated in this study. The results obtained in this thesis have revealed that the negative effects arising from coal and device parametres on the separation efficiency would be brought to the minimum levels if the fluidization air velocity is set based on the variable conditions. It is also found that a controlled  product discharge/drainage system would be a possible feature for such an application, with a careful implementation of both fluidization characteristics and separation performance.

In Foundry Elblag case there is found that in many processes manual handling are made by workers. For example wecan choose melting processes (additives <b>manual</b> <b>feeding,</b> mixing and pulling metallurgical slag, etc.) or fettling processes like grinding. Objective of that analysis was to define level of risk related to manual handling in work stand chosen and define activities impacted onrisk assessment result with biggest range. For risk reduction, technical and organizational solutions were shown (better ergonomically work stand, method of work and worker’s awareness about good practices). In this study methods related to manual handling risk assessment were described, focus on KIM method used in Foundry Elblag. Key Item Method allow to estimate the risk by simple calculation based on key indicators (time rating points, rating points of mass, posture or work condition). Points were chosen based on timekeeping, information from workers and foreman...|$|R

The farm animals {{will be able to use}} the same type of housing and are placed integrated with the fields. This is expected to achieve a better utilization of nutrients and a better survival rate for useful insects and micro organisms. The small fields are flexible and could fit to the variation in soil structure topography. This type of precision agriculture has the possibility of increasing biodiversity. The paper presents the concept of an autonomic feeding system for outdoor piglets. Initial results are presented using a remote controlled feeding unit (a prototype of the FeederAnt) to feed several pens with piglets. The FeederAnt drives into the grass paddocks twice a day and position itself in a new location for each feeding. This will help to distribute the manure from the animals evenly over the grass paddock to prevent point leaching of nutrients. The FeederAnt replaces many stationary feeding tables and reduce the amount of daily <b>manual</b> <b>feeding</b> routines. Further, it is expected that the problem with vermins will be solved since no feed residues will be left within the pens. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{combination}} of progenitor cells, cell-friendly scaffold, and a three-dimensional culture {{system has been}} investigated for the culture of cartilage tissue. We have assessed chondrogenesis of alginate-chitosan- encapsulated STRO- 1 -isolated human mesenchymal progenitor cells. In addition, ATDC- 5 cells and human articular chondrocytes were also evaluated. We have used a novel 3 D bioreactor system that enabled perfusion of the capsules with culture medium up to 28 days. Results from culturing all cell types indicated chondrogenesis, both in static and bioreactor culture. The expression of SOX- 9 and type II collagen was examined as a marker of differentiation. ATDC- 5 s expressed both SOX- 9 and type II collagen under perfused and static culture conditions. In monolayer cell culture, human articular chondrocytes did not express either SOX- 9 or type II collagen and STRO- 1 expressed alkaline phosphatase, indicating osteogenesis. However, when these cells were encapsulated in alginate-chitosan, both expressed SOX- 9 under static and perfused cultures, but type II collagen was only expressed under perfused culture conditions. We have {{also noted that the}} perfusion rates used were too low to ensure a significant advantage over static culture, but that use of the bioreactor eliminated the need for <b>manual</b> <b>feeding</b> and intervention of the cells over the 28 -day period...|$|R

We show that the spatial sampling rate, geometric linearity, point spread function, and photometric transfer function of off-the-shelf consumer cameras are acceptable for ballot imaging. However, scanner illumination is much more uniform than can be economically accomplished for variable size ballots. Therefore flat-field compensation must be designed into the image processing software. We illustrate the mechanical design of a prototype camera based ballot reader based on our comparative observations...|$|R
40|$|This Thesis {{addresses}} Factory Layout Problems, {{and reviews}} and evaluates the available layout techniques. Manufacturing {{as a system}} has been studied and reclassified for factory layout: space demands and spatial relationships have been considered as main principles of Factory Layout Planning. This forms {{a basis for the}} introduction of a new, more efficient Factory Layout Planning Methodology, denoted as SPACE MANAGEMENT. A new COMPUTER AIDED FACTORY LAYOUT PLANNING system is formulated as a tool for: - preparing 3 -D templates of Work Station Modules and Equipment Modules; - drawing a requested interior of an industrial hall/bay in 3 -D; - positioning any 'objects 1 (spaces), via manual interactive programs i n 3 -D; - automatic positioning of work stations and equipment in the bay, in 'technological' order (in 3 -D), using an automatic positioning program, with a facility for: collision course finding(with objects within the bay), manual override for corrections, and finding an optimum size (width) of the bay. The resulting layout scene can be observed from any required Position and distance. The system includes a set of auxiliary programs for <b>Manual</b> <b>Feeding</b> of lines of work stations in 'technological' order and for basic capacity calculations. CAFLAP also opens a new way of economic evaluation of Projects and alternatives. CAFLAP is implemented in FORTRAN 77 and uses the Computer Graphics System PICASO...|$|R
40|$|A {{quantitative}} feeding assay {{in adult}} Drosophila reveals rapid modulation of food ingestion by its nutritional value Wei Qi 1, 2 †, Zhe Yang 1, 2 †, Ziao Lin 1, 2, Jin-Yong Park 3, Greg S. B. Suh 3 and Liming Wang 1, 2 * Background: Food intake {{of the adult}} fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, an intermittent feeder, is attributed to several behavioral elements including foraging, feeding initiation and termination, and food ingestion. Despite the development of various feeding assays in fruit flies, how each of these behavioral elements, particularly food ingestion, is regulated remains largely uncharacterized. Results: To this end, we have developed a <b>manual</b> <b>feeding</b> (MAFE) assay that specifically measures food ingestion of an individual fly completely independent of the other behavioral elements. This assay reliably recapitulates the effects of known feeding modulators, and offers temporal resolution in the scale of seconds. Using this assay, we find that fruit flies can rapidly assess the nutritional value of sugars within 20 – 30 s, and increase the ingestion of nutritive sugars after prolonged periods of starvation. Two candidate nutrient sensors, SLC 5 A 11 and Gr 43 a, are required for discriminating the nutritive sugars, D-glucose and D-fructose, from their non-nutritive enantiomers, respectively. This suggests that differential sensing mechanisms {{play a key role}} in determining food nutritional value. Conclusions: Taken together, our MAFE assay offers a platform to specifically examine the regulation of food ingestion with excellent temporal resolution, and identifies a fast-acting neural mechanism that assesses food nutritional value and modulates food intake...|$|R
40|$|Background: Disease {{diagnosis}} is complicated since patients may demonstrate similar symptoms but physician may diagnose different diseases. There {{are a few}} number of investigations aimed to create a fuzzy expert system, as a computer aided system for disease diagnosis. Methods: In this research, a cross-sectional descriptive study conducted in a kidney clinic in Tehran, Iran in 2012. Medical diagnosis fuzzy rules applied, {{and a set of}} symptoms related to the set of considered diseases defined. The input case to be diagnosed defined by assigning a fuzzy value to each symptom and then three physicians asked about each suspected diseases. Then comments of those three physicians summarized for each disease. The fuzzy inference applied to obtain a decision fuzzy set for each disease, and crisp decision values attained to determine the certainty of existence for each disease. Results: Results: indicated that, in the diagnosis of seven cases of kidney disease by examining 21 indicators using fuzzy expert system, kidney stone disease with 63 % certainty was the most probable, renal tubular was at the lowest level with 15 %, and other kidney diseases were at the other levels. The most remarkable finding of this study was that results of kidney disease diagnosis (e. g., kidney stone) via fuzzy expert system were fully compatible with those of kidney physicians. Conclusion: The proposed fuzzy expert system is a valid, reliable, and flexible instrument to diagnose several typical input cases. The developed system decreases the effort of initial physical checking and <b>manual</b> <b>feeding</b> of input symptoms...|$|R
40|$|Automatic {{system has}} brought many {{revolutions}} {{in the existing}} technologies. One among the technologies, which has greater developments, is the solar powered automatic shrimp feeding system. For instance, the solar power which is a renewable energy can be an alternative solution to energy crisis and basically reducing man power by using it in an automatic manner. The researchers believe an automatic shrimp feeding system may help solve problems on <b>manual</b> <b>feeding</b> operations. The project study aimed to design and develop a solar powered automatic shrimp feeding system. It specifically sought to prepare the design specifications of the project, to determine the methods of fabrication and assembly, and to test the response time of the automatic shrimp feeding system. The researchers designed and developed an automatic system which utilizes a 10 hour timer to be set in intervals preferred by the user and will undergo a continuous process. The magnetic contactor acts as a switch connected to the 10 hour timer which controls the activation or termination of electrical loads and powered {{by means of a}} solar panel outputting electrical power, and a rechargeable battery in electrical communication with the solar panel for storing the power. By undergoing through series of testing, the components of the modified system were proven functional and were operating within the desired output. It was recommended that the timer to be used should be tested to avoid malfunction and achieve the fully automatic system and that the system may be improved to handle changes in scope of the project. ...|$|R
