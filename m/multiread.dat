40|$|Readability {{refers to}} {{the ease with which}} a reader can {{understand}} a text. Automatic readability assessment has been widely studied over the past 50 years. However, most of the studies focus on the development of tools that apply either to a single language, domain, or document type. This supposes duplicate efforts for both developers, who need to integrate multiple tools in their systems, and final users, who have to deal with incompatibilities among the readability scales of different tools. In this manuscript, we present <b>MultiRead,</b> a multipurpose readability assessment tool capable of predicting the reading difficulty of texts of varied type and length regardless of the language in which they are written. <b>MultiRead</b> bases its predictions on multiple indicators extracted from textual resources, including lexical, morphological, syntactical, semantic and social indicators. The latter are of particular interest given the recent adoption of social sites by users of different age and reading abilities. We gathered a leveled corpora comprised of textual resources in English, Spanish and Basque languages, with diverse length, source, domain and format. This corpora was used for assessing the effectiveness of <b>MultiRead,</b> and demonstrating that <b>MultiRead</b> outperforms other readability assessment systems, in terms of accuracy among all languages and document types evaluated...|$|E
40|$|The {{application}} of high-performance Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) technologies {{is widely used}} to characterize case-control comparison studies for RNA transcripts, such as mRNAs and small non-coding RNAs. The {{first step in the}} analy- sis strategies is mapping NGS reads against a reference database, and a critical issue is choosing how to deal with <b>multiread</b> problem. In this paper we present a novel ap- proach to represent and quantify read mapping ambiguities through the use of fuzzy sets and possibility theory. The aim of this work is to obtain a list of candidate differential expression events, ordered by significance, providing a description of the uncertainty of the results due to the <b>multiread</b> issue. A preliminary experiment on a case-control study of human endobronchial biopsies resulted in the identification of 9 genes with possible differential expression, four of them with an uncertain fold change. This result was con- firmed by FDR adjusted Fisher’s test, while the same data processed with DESeq 2 did not provide significant differences between case and control. High-performance Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) has become a widely used technology to characterize case-control comparison studies for RNA transcripts, such as mRNAs and small non-coding RNAs. The first step in the analysis strategies is mapping NGS reads against a reference database and a critical issue emerges in this phase: the problem of multireads. In this paper we present a novel approach to represent and quantify read mapping ambiguities through the use of fuzzy sets and possibility theory. The aim of this work is to obtain a list of candidate differential expression events, providing a description of the uncertainty of the results due to <b>multiread</b> presence. In a preliminary experiment on HeLa cells, the method correctly detected the possibility of false positiveness, while on a case-control study of human endobronchial biopsies, the method identified 11 genes with possible different expression, four of them with an uncertain fold change. This last result was confirmed by FDR adjusted Fisher’s test, while DESeq 2 did not provide significant differences between case and control...|$|E
40|$|Background: When the reads {{obtained}} from high-throughput RNA sequencing are mapped against a reference database, {{a significant proportion}} of them - known as multireads - can map to more than one reference sequence. These multireads originate from gene duplications, repetitive regions or overlapping genes. Removing the multireads from the mapping results, in RNA-Seq analyses, causes an underestimation of the read counts, while estimating the real read count can lead to false positives during the detection of differentially expressed sequences. Results: We present an innovative approach to deal with multireads and evaluate differential expression events, entirely based on fuzzy set theory. Since multireads cause uncertainty in the estimation of read counts during gene expression computation, they can also influence the reliability of differential expression analysis results, by producing false positives. Our method manages the uncertainty in gene expression estimation by defining the fuzzy read counts and evaluates the possibility of a gene to be differentially expressed with three fuzzy concepts: over-expression, same-expression and under-expression. The output of the method is a list of differentially expressed genes enriched with information about the uncertainty of the results due to the <b>multiread</b> presence. We have tested the method on RNA-Seq data designed for case-control studies and we have compared the obtained results with other existing tools for read count estimation and differential expression analysis. Conclusions: The management of multireads with the use of fuzzy sets allows to obtain a list of differential expression events which takes in account the uncertainty in the results caused by the presence of multireads. Such additional information can be used by the biologists when they have to select the most relevant differential expression events to validate with laboratory assays. Our method can be used to compute reliable differential expression events and to highlight possible false positives in the lists of differentially expressed genes computed with other tools...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background RNA {{sequencing}} (RNA-seq) measures {{gene expression}} levels and permits splicing analysis. Many existing aligners {{are capable of}} mapping millions of sequencing reads onto a reference genome. For reads that can be mapped to multiple positions along the reference genome (<b>multireads),</b> these aligners may either randomly assign them to a location, or discard them altogether. Either way could bias downstream analyses. Meanwhile, challenges remain in the alignment of reads spanning across splice junctions. Existing splicing-aware aligners that rely on the read-count method in identifying junction sites are inevitably affected by sequencing depths. Results The distance between aligned positions of paired-end (PE) reads or two parts of a spliced read {{is dependent on the}} experiment protocol and gene structures. We here proposed a new method that employs an empirical geometric-tail (GT) distribution of intron lengths to make a rational choice in <b>multireads</b> selection and splice-sites detection, according to the aligned distances from PE and sliced reads. Conclusions GT models that combine sequence similarity from alignment, and together with the probability of length distribution, could accurately determine the location of both <b>multireads</b> and spliced reads. </p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background RNA {{sequencing}} (RNA-seq) {{has become}} a major tool for biomedical research. A key step in analyzing RNA-seq data is to infer the origin of short reads in the source genome, and for this purpose, many read alignment/mapping software programs have been developed. Usually, the majority of mappable reads can be mapped to one unambiguous genomic location, and these reads are called unique reads. However, a considerable proportion of mappable reads can be aligned to more than one genomic location with the same or similar fidelities, and they are called "multireads". Allocating these <b>multireads</b> is challenging but critical for interpreting RNA-seq data. We recently developed a Bayesian stochastic model that allocates <b>multireads</b> more accurately than alternative methods (Ji et al. Biometrics 2011). Results In order to serve a greater biological community, we have implemented this method in a stand-alone, efficient, and user-friendly software package, BM-Map. BM-Map takes SAM (Sequence Alignment/Map), the most popular read alignment format, as the standard input; then based on the Bayesian model, it calculates mapping probabilities of <b>multireads</b> for competing genomic loci; and BM-Map generates the output by adding mapping probabilities to the original SAM file so that users can easily perform downstream analyses. The program is available in three common operating systems, Linux, Mac and PC. Moreover, we have built a dedicated website, [URL], which includes free downloads, detailed tutorials and illustration examples. Conclusions We have developed a stand-alone, efficient, and user-friendly software package for accurately allocating <b>multireads,</b> which is an important addition to our previous methodology paper. We believe that this bioinformatics tool will greatly help RNA-seq and related applications reach their full potential in life science research. </p...|$|R
40|$|DNA {{methylation}} is an epigenetic modification {{critical for}} normal development and diseases. The determination of genome-wide DNA methylation at single-nucleotide resolution {{is made possible}} by sequencing bisulfite treated DNA with next generation high-throughput sequencing. However, aligning bisulfite short reads to a reference genome remains challenging as only a limited proportion of them (around 50 - 70 %) can be aligned uniquely; a significant proportion, known as <b>multireads,</b> are mapped to multiple locations and thus discarded from downstream analyses, causing financial waste and biased methylation inference. To address this issue, we develop a Bayesian model that assigns <b>multireads</b> to their most likely locations based on the posterior probability derived from information hidden in uniquely aligned reads. Analyses of both simulated data and real hairpin bisulfite sequencing data show that our method can effectively assign approximately 70 % of the <b>multireads</b> to their best locations with up to 90 % accuracy, leading to {{a significant increase in}} the overall mapping efficiency. Moreover, the assignment model shows robust performance with low coverage depth, making it particularly attractive considering the prohibitive cost of bisulfite sequencing. Additionally, results show that longer reads help improve the performance of the assignment model. The assignment model is also robust to varying degrees of methylation and varying sequencing error rates. Finally, incorporating prior knowledge on mutation rate and context specific methylation level into the assignment model increases inference accuracy. The assignment model is implemented in the BAM-ABS package and freely available at [URL]...|$|R
40|$|In {{this work}} {{a program for}} {{detection}} of CNVs in sequencing data based on depth of coverage was implemented in C++ (copyDOC). Single steps in the pipeline, the acquisition of DOC signals in windows, the event calling and merging are implemented using generic programming techniques that enable the future integration of other algorithms in the pipeline. Furthermore, a testing environment was implemented, the copySim platform, which is very useful for testing and evaluation of different algorithms. CopyDOC was successfully applied to synthetic and real data using constant sized windows. Dynamic windows, that adapt according to the local mappability of the sequence, are implemented in the pipeline, but could not be tested in this work. They might be advantageous in datasets that contain uniquely mapped reads. However, CNVs {{have been shown to}} be overrepresented in segmental duplications (Nguyen et al. 2006; Cooper et al. 2007) and by a general exclusion of <b>multireads</b> those CNVs might be difficult to ascertain. In the application of copyDOC to a 1000 genomes dataset the overlap of predicted variants was considerable higer using <b>multireads</b> compared to uniquely mapped reads. Thus there is a requirement for tools that can handle <b>multireads.</b> Futher improvements of copyDOC might be done for the CNV calling algorithm and the merging step. For example the program workflow could be tested with a direct comparison of the DOC signals in two datasets via log ratios instead of appling a t-test on DOC signals in the two datasets. CopyDOC and copySim could be used as platform for the implementation and evaluation of futher CNV detection algorithms...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background RNA-Seq is a {{technique}} that uses Next Generation Sequencing to identify transcripts and estimate transcription levels. When applying this technique for quantification, one must contend with reads that align to multiple positions in the genome (<b>multireads).</b> Previous efforts to resolve <b>multireads</b> have shown that RNA-Seq expression estimation can be improved using probabilistic allocation of reads to genes. These methods use a probabilistic generative model for data generation and resolve ambiguity using likelihood-based approaches. In many instances, RNA-seq experiments are performed {{in the context of}} a population. The generative models of current methods do not take into account such population information, and it is an open question whether this information can improve quantification of the individual samples Results In order to explore the contribution of population level information in RNA-seq quantification, we apply a hierarchical probabilistic generative model, which assumes that expression levels of different individuals are sampled from a Dirichlet distribution with parameters specific to the population, and reads are sampled from the distribution of expression levels. We introduce an optimization procedure for the estimation of the model parameters, and use HapMap data and simulated data to demonstrate that the model yields a significant improvement in the accuracy of expression levels of paralogous genes. Conclusions We provide a proof of principal of the benefit of drawing on population commonalities to estimate expression. The results of our experiments demonstrate this approach can be beneficial, primarily for estimation at the gene level. </p...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY: Analysis of {{differential}} gene expression by RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) is frequently done using feature counts, i. e. {{the number of}} reads mapping to a gene. However, commonly used count algorithms (e. g. HTSeq) do not {{address the problem of}} reads aligning with multiple locations in the genome (<b>multireads)</b> or reads aligning with positions where two or more genes overlap (ambiguous reads). Rcount specifically addresses these issues. Furthermore, Rcount allows the user to assign priorities to certain feature types (e. g. higher priority for protein-coding genes compared to rRNA-coding genes) or to add flanking regions. Availability and implementation: Rcount provides a fast and easy-to-use graphical user interface requiring no command line or programming skills. It is implemented in C++ using the SeqAn (www. seqan. de) and the Qt libraries (qt-project. org). Source code and 64 bit binaries for (Ubuntu) Linux, Windows (7) and MacOSX are released under the GPLv 3 license and are freely available on github. com/MWSchmid/Rcount.

40|$|My {{dissertation}} mainly {{focuses on}} developing Bayesian models for high-throughput data and clinical trial design. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology generates millions of short reads, which provide valuable information for {{various aspects of}} cellular activities and biological functions. So far, NGS techniques have been applied in quantitatively measurement of diverse platforms, such as RNA expression, DNA copy number variation (CNV) and DNA methylation. Although NGS is powerful and largely expedite biomedical research in various fields, challenge still remains due to the high modality of disparate high-throughput data, high variability of data acquisition, high dimensionality of biomedical data, and high complexity of genomics and proteomics, e. g., how to extract useful information for the enormous data produced by NGS or how to effectively integrate the information from different platforms. Bayesian {{has the potential to}} fill in these gaps. In my dissertation, I will propose Bayesian-based approaches to address above challenges so that we can take full advantage of the NGS technology. It includes three specific topics: (1) proposing BM-Map: a Bayesian mapping of <b>multireads</b> for NGS data, (2) proposing a Bayesian graphical model for integrative analysis of TCGA data, and (3) proposing a non- parametric Bayesian Bi-clustering for next generation sequencing count data. For the clinical trial design, I will propose a latent Gaussian process model with application to monitoring clinical trials...|$|R
