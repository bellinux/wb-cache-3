40|$|Recently, {{sensitivity}} and uncertainty (S/U) techniques {{have been used}} to determine the area of applicability (AOA) of critical experiments used for code and data validation. These techniques require the computation of energy-dependent sensitivity coefficients for multiple reaction types for every nuclide in each system included in the validation. The sensitivity coefficients, as used for this application, predict the relative change in the system multiplication factor due to a relative change in a given cross-section data component or material number density. Thus, a sensitivity coefficient, S, for some <b>macroscopic</b> <b>cross</b> <b>section,</b> {Sigma}, is expressed as S = {Sigma}/k {partial_derivative}k/{partial_derivative}{Sigma}, where k is the effective neutron multiplication factor for the system. The sensitivity coefficient for the density of a material is equivalent to that of the total <b>macroscopic</b> <b>cross</b> <b>section.</b> Two distinct techniques have been employed in Monte Carlo radiation transport codes for the computation of sensitivity coefficients. The first, and most commonly employed, is the differential sampling technique. The second is the adjoint-based perturbation theory approach.

40|$|International audienceProton imaging is {{developed}} {{in order to}} improve the accuracy of chargedparticle therapy treatment planning. It makes it possible to directly map therelative stopping powers of the materials using the information on the energyloss of the protons.

As a consequence of individualproton detection, information on the transmission rate and scattering of theprotons is available.

40|$|High {{conversion}} water reactors (HCWR), {{such as the}} Resource-renewable Boiling Water Reactor (RBWR), {{are being}} designed with axial heterogeneity of alternating fissile and blanket zones to achieve a conversion ratio of greater than one and assure negative void coefficient of reactivity. This study assesses the generation of few-group <b>macroscopic</b> <b>cross</b> <b>sections</b> for neutron diffusion theory analyses {{of this type of}} reactor, in order to enable three-dimensional transient simulations. The goal is to minimize the number of energy groups in these simulations to reduce computational effort. A two-dimensional <b>cross</b> <b>section</b> generation methodology using the Monte Carlo code Serpent, similar to the traditional deterministic homogenization methodology, was used to analyze a single RBWR assembly. Results from two energy group and twelve energy group diffusion analyses showed an error in multiplication factor over 1000 pcm with errors in reaction rates between 10 and 60 %. Therefore, the traditional approach is not sufficiently accurate. Instead, a three-dimensional homogenization methodology using Serpent was developed to account for neighboring zones in the homogenization process. A Python wrapper, SerpentXS, was developed to perform branch case calculations with Serpent to parametrize few-group parameters as a function of reactor operating conditions and to create a database for interpolation with the nodal diffusion theory code, PARCS. Diffusion analyses using this methodology also showed an error in multiplication factor over 1000 pcm. The three-dimensional homogenization capability in Serpent allowed for the introduction of axial discontinuity factors in the diffusion theory analysis, needed to preserve Monte Carlo reaction rates and global multiplication factor. A one-dimensional finite-difference multigroup diffusion theory code, developed in MATLAB, was written to investigate the use of axial discontinuity factors for a single RBWR assembly. The application of discontinuity factors on either side of each axial interface preserved multiplication factor and reaction rate estimates between transport theory and diffusion theory analyses to within statistical uncertainty. Use of this three-dimensional assembly homogenization approach in generating few-group <b>macroscopic</b> <b>cross</b> <b>sections</b> and axial discontinuity factors as a function of operating conditions will help further research in transient diffusion theory simulations of axially heterogeneous reactors. by Bryan R.

The attenuation of the intensity of a beam of gamma rays in an absorber, sketched in Fig. 17. 1, follows a true exponential variation with the distance of penetration, which is unlike that of charged particles, Fig. 17. 1. Attenuation of a beam of gamma radiation through an absorber of thickness x. I(x) = I oe −µx (17. 1) The interaction is expressed through the linear attenuation coefficient µ which does not depend on x but does depend on the energy of the incident gamma. By attenuation we mean either scattering or absorption. Since either process will remove the gamma from the beam, the probability of penetrating a distance x {{is the same as the}} probability of traveling a distance x without any interaction, exp(- µ x).

40|$|Characteristics between {{commercial}} {{spent fuel}} waste packages (WP), Laboratory Critical Experiments (LCEs), and commercial reactor critical (CRC) evaluations are compared in this work. Emphasis is placed upon comparisons of CRC benchmark {{results and the}} relative neutron flux spectra in each system. Benchmark evaluations were performed for four different pressurized water reactors using four different sets of isotopes. As expected, {{as the number of}} fission products used to represent the burned fuel inventory approached reality, the closer to unity k{sub eff} became. Examination of material and geometry characteristics indicate several fundamental similarities between the WP and CRC systems. In addition, spectral evaluations were performed on a representative pressurized water reactor CRC, a 21 -assembly area of the core modeled in a potential WP configuration, and three LCEs considered applicable benchmarks for storage packages. Fission and absorption reaction spectra as well as relative neutron flux spectra are generated and compared for each system. The energy dependent reaction rates are the product of the neutron flux spectrum and the energy dependent total <b>macroscopic</b> <b>cross</b> <b>section.</b> With constant source distribution functions, and the total macroscopic cross sections for the fuel region in the CRCs and WP being composed of nearly the same isotopics, the resulting relative flux spectra in the CRCs and WP are very nearly the same.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} a tool called TXSAMC (Transport Cross Sections from Applied Monte Carlo) that produces shielded and homogenized multigroup cross sections for small fast reactor systems. The motivation for this tool {{comes from a}} desire to investigate reactor systems that are not characterized well by existing tools. Proper investigation usually {{requires the use of}} deterministic codes to characterize the timedependent reactor behavior and to link reactor neutronics codes with thermal-hydraulics and/or other physics codes. Deterministic codes require an accurate set of multigroup cross section libraries. The current process for generating these libraries is time consuming. TXSAMC offers a shorter route for generating these libraries. TXSAMC links three external codes together to create these libraries. The code creates an MCNP (Monte Carlo N-Particle) model of the reactor and calculates the zoneaveraged scalar flux in various tally regions and a core-averaged scalar flux tallied by energy bin. The core-averaged scalar flux provides a weighting function for NJOY. The zone-averaged scalar flux data is used in TRANSX for homogenization and shielding. The code runs NJOY to produce multigroup cross sections that are tabulated by nuclide, temperature and background cross section in MATXS (Material-wise cross section) format. This library is read by TRANSX which, in conjunction with the RZFLUX (Regular Zone-averaged Flux) files, shields the cross sections and homogenizes them. The result is a <b>macroscopic</b> <b>cross</b> <b>section</b> for the cell within the reactor from which the RZFLUX file was written. The cross sections produced by this process have been tested in five different sample problems and {{have been shown to be}} reasonably accurate. For reactor cells containing fuel pins, the typical error in the overall fission, nusigf, (n, 2 n), absorption and total RRD is only a few percent and is often less than one percent. It appears that the error is less for hexagonal lattices than for square lattices. A significant amount of error is associated with threshold reactions like (n, 2 n) in the sodium coolant. For the square lattice test problems, a reduction in error occurs when smaller tally regions are selected. This reduction was not observed for hexagonal lattice reactors. Overall, the cross sections produced by TXSAMC performed very well...|$|E
