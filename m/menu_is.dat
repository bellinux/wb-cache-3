5|$|Schwa's <b>menu</b> <b>is</b> {{known for}} unusual {{ingredients}} and innovative food combinations, such as Carlson's version of pad Thai made with jellyfish tentacles instead of noodles. The quail egg ravioli {{is considered the}} restaurant's signature dish.|$|E
5|$|Cracker Barrel's <b>menu</b> <b>is</b> {{based on}} {{traditional}} Southern cuisine, with appearance and decor designed to resemble an old-fashioned general store. Each restaurant features a front porch lined with wooden rocking chairs, a stone fireplace, and decorative {{artifacts from the}} local area. Cracker Barrel {{is known for its}} partnerships with country music performers. It has received attention for its charitable activities, such as its assistance of victims of Hurricane Katrina and injured war veterans.|$|E
5|$|Scrolling {{through a}} long list or <b>menu</b> <b>is</b> {{achieved}} by sliding a finger over the display from bottom to top, or vice versa to go back. In either case, the list moves {{as if it is}} pasted on the outer surface of a wheel, slowly decelerating as if affected by friction. In this way, the interface simulates the physics of a real object.|$|E

50|$|Braille <b>menus</b> <b>were</b> first {{introduced}} in 1979, and picture menus in 1988. In March 1992, combination Braille and picture <b>menus</b> <b>were</b> reintroduced to accommodate those with vision, speech, or hearing impairments.|$|R
5000|$|A {{common use}} of <b>menus</b> <b>is</b> to provide {{convenient}} access to various operations such as saving or opening a file, quitting a program, or manipulating data. Most widget toolkits provide {{some form of}} pull-down or pop-up <b>menu.</b> Pull-down <b>menus</b> <b>are</b> the type commonly used in menu bars (usually {{near the top of}} a window or screen), which are most often used for performing actions, whereas pop-up (or [...] "fly-out") <b>menus</b> <b>are</b> more likely to be used for setting a value, and might appear anywhere in a window.|$|R
5|$|At the Sci-Fi Dine-In, lunch guests {{stay for}} an average of fifty minutes and dinner guests {{for an average}} of just longer than an hour, with lunch and dinner guests being served their food on average five and ten minutes after {{ordering}} respectively. The restaurant participates in the Disney Dining Plan. Meals are served starting at 10:30a.m. on Sundays and Wednesdays, and starting at 11:00a.m. every other day of the week. The restaurant closes each day {{at the same time that}} the park does, which is in the late evening. The <b>menu</b> <b>is</b> the same all day, without a distinction between lunch and dinner. A full bar service is available, and there is also a limited wine selection.|$|E
5|$|Halo Wars is a {{real-time}} strategy (RTS) {{video game}} developed {{exclusively for the}} Xbox 360 console, in which players command armies from a bird's-eye view of the battlefield. The game focuses on military combat, but contains streamlined resource management and base construction elements. It was designed with the Xbox 360 controller in mind; for example, the A button is used for selecting units. A single tap of the button selects one unit, while a double tap selects all units of the same type. The d-pad navigates to current battles and cycles through bases, while the right analog stick adjusts the camera angle. A radial <b>menu</b> <b>is</b> used for base construction.|$|E
5|$|The {{in-flight}} food is catered by TajSATS Air Catering, another {{joint venture}} between Tata and a Singaporean company, headed by Chef Arun Batra, formerly the executive chef of the Taj Hotels group. Vistara offers four different meals for each cabin for different {{time of the day}} — breakfast, refreshment, lunch and dinner with options of one vegetarian and one non-vegetarian dish in economy class; two vegetarian dishes and one non-vegetarian dish in premium economy; and two vegetarian and two non-vegetarian dishes for business-class cabin. The <b>menu</b> <b>is</b> typically changed every seventh day and there are different menus for lunch and dinner. It also provides special meals upon request 24 hours before departure.|$|E
50|$|The KBFX Spinx Menu {{does not}} try to copy the WinXP Start <b>menu.</b> It <b>is</b> based on a {{different}} approach and concept.

50|$|In 1988, Wendy's was {{the first}} {{fast-food}} chain to create a single price-point value menu where all items listed on that <b>menu</b> <b>were</b> priced exclusively at 99¢. The <b>menu</b> <b>was</b> restructured in 2007 due to rising costs as the Super Value Menu with prices ranging from 99¢ to $2.00 USD.|$|R
5|$|The <b>menu</b> <b>is</b> {{created by}} Bosi. He has been {{described}} as an innovator and his work has been compared to that of Heston Blumenthal at The Fat Duck. One of the new dishes Bosi introduced following his move to London was a two-part pork dish. The first part was roasted suckling pig served with sea urchin, kohlrabi and a fondant of sweet potato. The second, inspired by his daughter, featured a sausage roll with a salad and a truffle dressing. Other dishes have included roast chicken with an onion fondue and licorice, and desserts include a chocolate tart served with basil ice cream.|$|E
5|$|The user {{interface}} and menus {{were created by}} Joe Kowalski, who had previously worked on similar game elements for Guitar Hero, Guitar Hero II, and the Rock Band series. Much of the game's interface elements used a medieval woodcut art style, and were designed to contrast well against the world's graphics. The introductory <b>menu</b> <b>is</b> presented as an interactive movie created from live action clips of Jack Black manipulating a prop gatefold vinyl record album, using Adobe After Effects to provide the on-screen text, controls handling, and stitching of separate scenes into a seamless movie.|$|E
5|$|Dining hall {{protocol}} was a scripted process, including a whistle system to indicate which block and tier of men would move {{into and out}} of the hall at any given time, who sat where, where to place hands, and when to start eating. Prisoners would be awakened at 6:30, and sent to breakfast at 6:55. A breakfast <b>menu</b> <b>is</b> still preserved on the hallway board, dated 21 March 1963. The breakfast menu included assorted dry cereals, steamed whole wheat, a scrambled egg, milk, stewed fruit, toast, bread, and butter. Lunch was served in the dining hall at 11:20, followed by a 30-minute rest in the cell, before returning to work until 16:15. Dinner was served at 16:25 and the prisoners would then retire to their cells at 16:50 to be locked in for the night. Inmates were permitted to eat as much as they liked within 20 minutes, provided they left no waste; waste would be reported and may make the prisoner subject to removal of privileges if they made a habit of it.|$|E
50|$|Pie <b>menus</b> <b>are</b> {{unavailable}} {{as standard}} graphical control element in common commercial toolkits. Video games often require custom widget development, so pie <b>menu</b> cost <b>is</b> lower {{in that particular}} scenario.|$|R
40|$|When {{some items}} in a <b>menu</b> <b>are</b> {{selected}} {{more frequently than}} others, {{as is often the}} case, designers or individual users may be able to speed performance and improve preference ratings by placing several high-frequency items {{at the top of the}} menu. Design guidelines for split <b>menus</b> <b>were</b> developed and applied. Split <b>menus</b> <b>were</b> implemented and tested in two in situ usability studies and a controlled experiment. In the usability studies performance times were reduced by 17 to 58 % depending on the site and menus. In the controlled experiment split <b>menus</b> <b>were</b> significantly faster than alphabetic menus and yielded significantly higher subjective preferences. A possible resolution to the continuing debate among cognitive theorists about predicting <b>menu</b> selection times <b>is</b> offered. We conjecture and offer evidence that, at least when selecting items from pull-down menus, a logarithmic model applies to familiar (high-frequency) items and a linear model applies to unfamiliar (low-frequency) ite [...] ...|$|R

5|$|Each {{character}} can use {{one type of}} weapon, in addition to magical spells. The effectiveness of spells depends on the magical ability of the character and the element of the spell {{in relation to the}} enemy. When in battle mode, attacking monsters fills a gauge that allows the player to use character-specific special attacks. Upon collecting enough experience points in battle, each {{character can}} increase in level to gain improved character statistics such as strength and evasion. Options such as changing equipment, casting spells, or checking status are performed by cycling through the game's Ring Commands—a circular menu which hovers over the controlled party member. The game is paused whenever the Ring Command <b>menu</b> <b>is</b> activated. Within the Ring, the player has nine slots for storing items; additional items can be placed into item storage, which is inaccessible in combat.|$|E
5|$|The {{player can}} {{navigate}} {{and interact with}} the game's environment, mainly carriages on the Orient Express, through use of a context-sensitive cursor. The cursor changes when it is placed over an item with which the player can interact, {{and can be used}} to talk to other characters, listen to other characters' conversations, look around the environment, and move. The player can walk to a location with a single click, and run to a location with a double-click. Double-clicking {{on the edge of the}} screen instantly takes the player to the next screen. There is a map of the train in the game's interface at the top of the screen, and once each carriage has been unlocked, the player can click on any part of the map and instantly be transported to that location, saving the player from having to travel through the train screen by screen. Another accessible feature is an objectives menu interface which states the general tasks the player should be attempting to complete. This <b>menu</b> <b>is</b> designed to guide players in the right direction without giving any explicit hints.|$|E
5|$|The game {{progresses}} linearly {{from one}} story event to the next, usually {{presented as a}} cutscene, though there are numerous side quests available that provide benefits to the characters. Players may also choose {{the order in which}} they tackle some areas. Most of the gameplay occurs on interconnected field maps where battles take place. Combat in Kingdom Hearts occurs in real time and involves pressing buttons to initiate attacks by the on-screen character. An action menu, similar to those found in Final Fantasy games, found at the bottom left of the screen provides other combat options such as using magic and items, although players can also assign selected magic spells that can be instantly used whilst holding the shoulder button. As players progress through the game, they can receive certain Disney characters as summons, such as Dumbo and Tinker Bell, each with their own unique abilities. There is also a context-sensitive option {{at the bottom of the}} menu, usually used for interacting with the environment or performing special attacks. This <b>menu</b> <b>is</b> manipulated by using the right analog stick or digital pad, while movement is controlled by the left analog stick, allowing the player to navigate the menu while avoiding or approaching enemies.|$|E

40|$|Abstract only availableThe {{subject of}} this {{research}} project {{was to determine if}} the menu position of an item influences the number of times it is ordered. In this particular study, one-page <b>menus</b> <b>were</b> examined. A new <b>menu</b> <b>was</b> designed where each <b>menu</b> item <b>was</b> rearranged within its category of starters, soups and salads, entrees/pastas, and desserts. Popularity of items ordered from the original <b>menu</b> <b>was</b> compared to popularity of items ordered from the redesigned menu {{to determine whether or not}} the position of the menu items makes a difference. A comparison of these two sets of data will be done to see if there is a statistically significant difference in the popularity of menu items based on their position on the menu. Recommendations on how to improve profitability through <b>menu</b> positioning will <b>be</b> made to restaurateurs based on these results. CAFNR On Campus Research Internshi...|$|R
50|$|From {{the user}} {{interface}} designer's perspective, {{an interaction technique is}} a well-defined {{solution to a}} specific user interface design problem. Interaction techniques as conceptual ideas can be refined, extended, modified and combined. For example, contextual <b>menus</b> <b>are</b> {{a solution to the problem}} of rapidly selecting commands. Pie <b>menus</b> <b>are</b> a radial variant of contextual menus. Marking menus combine pie menus with gesture recognition.|$|R

40|$|Existing work on menu {{techniques}} {{has shown}} linear <b>menus</b> to <b>be</b> less efficient and reliable for menuing tasks {{when compared to}} radial menus. With the rise in popularity of 3 D spatial interaction in console gaming, such as the Nintendo Wii, {{it is important to}} determine whether the existing findings still hold true when using a 3 D pointing device such as the Wii Controller. Linear <b>menus</b> <b>were</b> compared with two other menu techniques: radial menus and rotary <b>menus.</b> Effectiveness <b>was</b> measured through task completion time and the number of task errors. A subjective measure was also taken to determine participant preferences. Participants performed faster and made fewer errors when using the radial menu technique. Radial <b>menus</b> <b>were</b> also preferred by participants. These results indicate that radial <b>menus</b> <b>are</b> an effective <b>menu</b> technique when used with a 3 D pointing device. This appears to agree with previous work regarding radial menus and indicates that the usage of radial menus in gaming applications should be investigated further...|$|R
