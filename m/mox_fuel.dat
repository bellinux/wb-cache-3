5|$|<b>MOX</b> <b>fuel</b> {{has been}} in use since the 1980s, and is widely used in Europe. In September 2000, the United States and the Russian Federation signed a Plutonium Management and Disposition Agreement by which each agreed to dispose of 34tonnes of weapons-grade {{plutonium}}. The U.S. Department of Energy plans to dispose of 34tonnes of weapons-grade plutonium in the United States {{before the end of}} 2019 by converting the plutonium to a <b>MOX</b> <b>fuel</b> to be used in commercial nuclear power reactors.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} {{chemical}} process, PUREX (Plutonium–URanium EXtraction) reprocesses {{spent nuclear fuel}} to extract plutonium and uranium {{which can be used}} to form a mixed oxide (<b>MOX)</b> <b>fuel</b> for reuse in nuclear reactors. Weapons-grade plutonium can be added to the fuel mix. <b>MOX</b> <b>fuel</b> is used in light water reactors and consists of 60kg of plutonium per tonne of fuel; after four years, three-quarters of the plutonium is burned (turned into other elements). Breeder reactors are specifically designed to create more fissionable material than they consume.|$|E
5|$|<b>MOX</b> <b>fuel</b> {{improves}} total burnup. A {{fuel rod}} is reprocessed {{after three years}} of use to remove waste products, which by then account for 3% of the total weight of the rods. Any uranium or plutonium isotopes produced during those three years are left and the rod goes back into production. The presence of up to 1% gallium per mass in weapons-grade plutonium alloy has the potential to interfere with long-term operation of a light water reactor.|$|E
40|$|In 1967, {{a series}} of {{critical}} experiments were conducted at the Westinghouse Reactor Evaluation Center (WREC) using mixed-oxide (MOX) PuO{sub 2 }-UO{sub 2 } and/or UO{sub 2 } fuels in various lattices and configurations. These experiments were performed under the joint sponsorship of Empire State Atomic Development Associates (ESADA) plutonium program and Westinghouse. The purpose of these experiments was to develop experimental data useful in validating analytical methods used {{in the design of}} plutonium-bearing replacement fuel for water reactors. Three different fuel types were used during the experimental program: two <b>MOX</b> <b>fuels</b> and a low-enriched UO{sub 2 } <b>fuel.</b> The <b>MOX</b> <b>fuels</b> were distinguished by their {sup 240 }Pu content: 8 wt % {sup 240 }Pu and 24 wt % {sup 240 }Pu. Both <b>MOX</b> <b>fuels</b> contained 2. 0 wt % PuO{sub 2 } in natural UO{sub 2 }. The UO{sub 2 } fuel with 2. 72 wt % enrichment was used for comparison with the plutonium data and for use in multiregion experiments...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe have {{considered}} a fuel cycle scheme for multi-recycling of plutonium recovered from spent UO 2 fuels of LWRs. Plutonium {{is to be}} partially loaded into the next LWRs {{in the form of}} <b>MOX</b> <b>fuels</b> with UO 2 fuels made by re- enrichment of uranium recovered from spent fuels of LWRs. We consider to recycle plutonium in combination with uranium multi-recycling system previously reported, which can provide uranium fuels for not only fully UO 2 fueled PWRs but also partially <b>MOX</b> <b>fueled</b> PWRs. The results of the process system analysis suggest that the proposed scheme makes it possible to recycle plutonium in succession...|$|R
40|$|This {{presentation}} {{provides an}} overview of advances made in fast reactor fuel safety research in the last decades. <b>MOX</b> <b>fuels</b> were selected for many fast reactors. The need to minimise waste through partitioning and transmutation strategies has seen new fuel forms evolve, incluing fertile and non fertile targets to host the minor actinides. Despite the proven safety performance of <b>MOX</b> <b>fuels,</b> and the progress made in nitride and carbide driver fuels and also in minor actinide oxide fuel research programmes, improvements in knowledge and understanding of the safety performance of these fuels can be made. Above all, breakthroughs in simulation and modelling need to be harnessed to dedicated experiment, leading to even more reliable and robust engineering codes for the qualification of all fast reactor fuels.

5|$|All {{isotopes}} between 242Cm and 248Cm, {{as well as}} 250Cm, {{undergo a}} self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction and thus in principle {{can act as a}} nuclear fuel in a reactor. As in most transuranic elements, the nuclear fission cross section is especially high for the odd-mass curium isotopes 243Cm, 245Cm and 247Cm. These can be used in thermal-neutron reactors, whereas a mixture of curium isotopes is only suitable for fast breeder reactors since the even-mass isotopes are not fissile in a thermal reactor and accumulate as burn-up increases. The mixed-oxide (<b>MOX)</b> <b>fuel,</b> which is to be used in power reactors, should contain little or no curium because the neutron activation of 248Cm will create californium. This is strong neutron emitter, and would pollute the back end of the fuel cycle and increase the dose to reactor personnel. Hence, if the minor actinides are to be used as fuel in a thermal neutron reactor, the curium should be excluded from the fuel or placed in special fuel rods where it is the only actinide present.|$|E
5|$|Most {{synthesis}} routines yield {{a mixture}} of different actinide isotopes as oxides, from which a certain isotope of curium needs to be separated. An example procedure could be to dissolve spent reactor fuel (e.g. <b>MOX</b> <b>fuel)</b> in nitric acid, and remove {{the bulk of the}} uranium and plutonium using a PUREX (Plutonium – URanium EXtraction) type extraction with tributyl phosphate in a hydrocarbon. The lanthanides and the remaining actinides are then separated from the aqueous residue (raffinate) by a diamide-based extraction to give, after stripping, {{a mixture of}} trivalent actinides and lanthanides. A curium compound is then selectively extracted using multi-step chromatographic and centrifugation techniques with an appropriate reagent. Bis-triazinyl bipyridine complex has been recently proposed as such reagent which is highly selective to curium. Separation of curium from a very similar americium can also be achieved by treating a slurry of their hydroxides in aqueous sodium bicarbonate with ozone at elevated temperature. Both americium and curium are present in solutions mostly in the +3 valence state; whereas americium oxidizes to soluble Am(IV) complexes, curium remains unchanged and can thus be isolated by repeated centrifugation.|$|E
25|$|There was no <b>MOX</b> <b>fuel</b> {{in any of}} {{the cooling}} ponds {{at the time of the}} incident. The only <b>MOX</b> <b>fuel</b> was {{currently}} loaded in the Unit 3 reactor.|$|E
50|$|Also, {{the neutron}} {{irradiation}} of curium generates the higher actinides, such as californium, which increase the neutron dose {{associated with the}} used nuclear fuel; this {{has the potential to}} pollute the fuel cycle with strong neutron emitters. As a result, it is likely that curium will be excluded from most <b>MOX</b> <b>fuels.</b>|$|R
50|$|For instance, {{plutonium}} can be reprocessed into <b>MOX</b> <b>fuels</b> and transmuted {{in standard}} reactors. The heavier elements could be transmuted in fast reactors, but probably more effectively in a subcritical reactor which is sometimes {{known as an}} energy amplifier and which was devised by Carlo Rubbia. Fusion neutron sources have also been proposed as well suited.|$|R
