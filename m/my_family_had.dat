500|$|Satyajit Ray is a {{cultural}} icon in India and in Bengali communities worldwide. Following his death, the city of Calcutta came to a virtual standstill, as {{hundreds of thousands of}} people gathered around his house to pay their last respects. Satyajit Ray's influence has been widespread and deep in Bengali cinema; a number of Bengali directors, including Aparna Sen, Rituparno Ghosh and Gautam Ghose as well as Vishal Bhardwaj, Dibakar Banerjee, Shyam Benegal and Sujoy Ghosh from Hindi cinema in India, Tareq Masud and Tanvir Mokammel in Bangladesh, and Aneel Ahmad in England, have been influenced by his film craft. Across the spectrum, filmmakers such as Budhdhadeb Dasgupta, Mrinal Sen and Adoor Gopalakrishnan have acknowledged his seminal contribution to Indian cinema. Beyond India, filmmakers such as Martin Scorsese, Francis Ford Coppola, James Ivory, Abbas Kiarostami, Elia Kazan, François Truffaut, Carlos Saura, Isao Takahata, Wes Anderson, Danny Boyle and many other noted filmmakers from all over the world have been influenced by his cinematic style, with many others such as Akira Kurosawa praising his work. Gregory Nava's 1995 film <b>My</b> <b>Family</b> <b>had</b> a final scene that repeated that of Apur Sansar. Ira Sachs's 2005 work Forty Shades of Blue was a loose remake of Charulata. [...] Other references to Ray films are found, for example, in recent works such as Sacred Evil, the Elements trilogy of Deepa Mehta. According to Michael Sragow of The Atlantic Monthly, the [...] "youthful coming-of-age dramas that have flooded art houses since the mid-fifties owe a tremendous debt to the Apu trilogy". The trilogy also introduced the bounce lighting technique. Kanchenjungha (1962) introduced a narrative structure that resembles later hyperlink cinema. Pratidwandi (1972) helped pioneer photo-negative flashback and X-ray digression techniques.|$|E
2500|$|Portman {{graduated}} from Cincinnati Country Day School in 1974, {{where he had}} served as treasurer of his class, enjoyed playing baseball, and developed an interest in politics, later telling the National Review, [...] " [...] I wasn't a Democrat or a Republican. No one in <b>my</b> <b>family</b> <b>had</b> ever been in politics. My dad thought {{it was something that}} got in the way." [...] He went on to attend Dartmouth College, where he started leaning to the right, and majored in anthropology and earned a Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) in 1978. At Dartmouth, {{he was a member of}} the Ledyard Canoe Club, and went on several kayaking and canoeing expeditions around the world. He spent summers throughout college in the American West, on cattle farms and ranches, tending to livestock, riding horses, and assisting in related chores. In Cincinnati, Portman worked on Bill Gradison's Congressional campaign, and Gradison soon became a mentor to Portman. Portman next entered the University of Michigan Law School, earning his Juris Doctor (J.D.) degree in 1984 and serving as vice president of the student senate. During law school, Portman embarked on a kayaking and hiking trip across China, and, not long before, blind dated a young Democratic volunteer, Jane Dudley. Dudley's aunt and uncle lived in Cincinnati and were friends with Portman's parents. Dudley embarked on a hiking trip with her aunt in the Himalayas, and took part in the date with Portman following her aunt's advice. Dudley had become interested in politics by working for a family friend who was running for the state legislature in North Carolina. She majored in political science at Vanderbilt University, and wanted to work on Capitol Hill. She then worked in a U.S. Senate campaign in 1984 for Jim Hunt who was governor of North Carolina. After graduating from law school, Portman moved to Washington, D.C., where he worked for the law firm Patton Boggs. Portman next became an associate at Graydon Head & Ritchie law firm in Cincinnati.|$|E

He stepped forward, with more than usual stiffness in his air, which was never entirely free from self-consequence, and said to Lady Binks, [...] "May I request to know of your ladyship what particular respecting <b>my</b> <b>family</b> <b>had</b> the honour to engage {{the attention of the}} company?" ...|$|E

60|$|But at what a cost! I am {{not quite}} clear {{as to what}} a pariah is, but I was {{everything}} that it sounds like. I had no friends, no amusements, no enjoyment of life. The happiness of <b>my</b> <b>family</b> <b>had</b> been sacrificed. I was a bee, sucking sordid honey from life's fairest flowers, dreaded and shunned on account of my stingo.|$|E
60|$|My next {{bout with}} John Barleycorn {{occurred}} when I was seven. This time my imagination was at fault, and I was frightened into the encounter. Still farming, <b>my</b> <b>family</b> <b>had</b> {{moved to a}} ranch on the bleak sad coast of San Mateo County, south of San Francisco. It was a wild, primitive countryside in those days; and often I heard my mother pride herself that we were old American stock and not immigrant Irish and Italians like our neighbours. In all our section {{there was only one}} other old American family.|$|E
6000|$|... "I've {{been brought}} up in Texas.

60|$|And {{thus it was}} that, on a wild {{evening in}} the early spring of the year 1805, I, Louis de Laval, being in the twenty-first year of my age, returned, after an exile of {{thirteen}} years, to the country of which <b>my</b> <b>family</b> <b>had</b> for many centuries been the ornament and support. She had treated us badly, this country; she had repaid our services by insult, exile, and confiscation. But all that was forgotten as I, the only de Laval of the new generation, dropped upon my knees upon her sacred soil, and, with the strong smell of the seaweed in my nostrils, pressed my lips upon the wet and pringling gravel.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I {{have heard}} once or twice, 'tis true, that <b>my</b> <b>family</b> <b>had</b> {{seen better days}} afore they came to Blackmoor.

60|$|If <b>my</b> <b>family</b> <b>had</b> not {{abandoned}} me, I {{need not}} have thus left her to help herself. As it was, I had no choice. One consolation supported me at parting--she was in no danger of persecution from her father. A second letter from him had arrived at Crickgelly, and had been forwarded to the address I had left for it. It was dated Hamburg, and briefly told her to remain at Crickgelly, and expect fresh instructions, explanations, and a supply of money, {{as soon as he}} had settled the important business matters which had taken him abroad. His daughter answered the letter, telling him of her marriage, and giving him an address at a post-office to write to, if he chose to reply to her communication. There the matter rested.|$|E

6000|$|Yes! {{such was}} one {{of the effects of the}} pernicious {{opinions}} that had been so widely circulated in the land, during the profound moral mania that was working its ravages among us, with a fatality and danger that greatly exceed those which accompanied the cholera. A fellow, who was almost an inmate of <b>my</b> <b>family,</b> <b>had</b> not only conspired with others to rob me of my property, on a large scale, but he had actually carried his plot so far as to resort to the brand and the rifle, as two of the agents to be employed in carrying out his virtuous objects. Nor was this the result of the vulgar disposition to steal; it was purely a consequence of a widely-extended system, that is fast becoming incorporated with the politics of the land, and which men, relying on the efficacy of majorities, are bold enough to stand up, in legislative halls, to defend.[28] ...|$|E
60|$|True, on my side, {{to every}} detail of our arrangement, I arose, on the day in question, before the servants, packed a few {{necessaries}} in a bag, took with me the little money I possessed, and bade farewell for ever to the rectory. I walked with good spirits to a town some thirty miles from home, and was set down the next morning in this great city of London. As I walked from the coach-office to the hotel, I could not help exulting in the pleasant change that had befallen me; beholding, meanwhile, with innocent delight, the traffic of the streets, and depicting, in all the colours of fancy, the reception that awaited me from John. But alas! when I inquired for Mr. Fanshawe, the porter assured me {{there was no such}} gentleman among the guests. By what channel our secret had leaked out, or what pressure had been brought to bear on the too facile John, I could never fathom. Enough that <b>my</b> <b>family</b> <b>had</b> triumphed; that I found myself alone in London, tender in years, smarting under the most sensible mortification, and by every sentiment of pride and self-respect debarred for ever from my father’s house.|$|E
6000|$|... "Possibly," [...] {{our friend}} said, after a moment's muse, [...] "I am letting {{my sense of}} another {{incident}} color the general event too widely. But before I come to that I wish to allege some proofs of the national irony which I received on two occasions when landing in New York. On {{the first of these}} occasions the commissioner who came aboard the steamer, to take the sworn declaration of the passengers that they were not smugglers, recognized my name as that of a well-known financier who had been abroad for a much-needed rest, and personally welcomed me home in such terms that I felt sure of complete exemption from the duties levied on others. When we landed I found that this good friend had looked out for me to the extent of getting me the first inspector, and he had guarded my integrity to the extent of committing me to a statement in severalty of the things <b>my</b> <b>family</b> <b>had</b> bought abroad, so that I had to pay twenty-eight dollars on my daughter's excess of the hundred dollars allowed free, although my wife was bringing in only seventy-five dollars' value, and I less than fifty." ...|$|E

40|$|This {{collection}} {{of art is}} meant to visualize {{many of the things}} <b>my</b> <b>family</b> <b>has</b> passed down to me, and recent events in my life have given me the desire to put them on paper. The six large paintings as well as the smaller ones express my feelings and memories that I associate with each grandparent and family. Inspiration for the style of the paintings comes from my professor Marilynn Derwenskus, and when mixed with my own personal style, became a blend of abstraction and realism that creates a sense of space as well as a recognizable subject. These works have become a way for me to permanently record the role that <b>my</b> <b>family</b> <b>has</b> played in <b>my</b> life and no matter what the future holds, from now on, they will forever be remembered.

60|$|I, THE SIEUR LOUIS DE CONTE, {{was born}} in Neufchateau, on the 6th of January, 1410; that is to say, exactly two years before Joan of Arc {{was born in}} Domremy. <b>My</b> <b>family</b> <b>had</b> fled to those distant regions from the {{neighborhood}} of Paris {{in the first years}} of the century. In politics they were Armagnacspatriots; they were for our own French King, crazy and impotent as he was. The Burgundian party, who were for the English, had stripped them, and done it well. They took everything but my father's small nobility, and when he reached Neufchateau he reached it in poverty and with a broken spirit. But the political atmosphere there was the sort he liked, and that was something. He came to a region of comparative quiet; he left behind him a region peopled with furies, madmen, devils, where slaughter was a daily pastime and no man's life safe for a moment. In Paris, mobs roared through the streets nightly, sacking, burning, killing, unmolested, uninterrupted. The sun rose upon wrecked and smoking buildings, and upon mutilated corpses lying here, there, and yonder about the streets, just as they fell, and stripped naked by thieves, the unholy gleaners after the mob. None had the courage to gather these dead for burial; they were left there to rot and create plagues.|$|E
60|$|And then, as I {{sat there}} with the big sail humming like a shell above my head and the green water hissing beside me, I thought over all that I had heard of this uncle of mine. My father, the {{descendant}} {{of one of the}} proudest and oldest families in France, had chosen beauty and virtue rather than rank in his wife. Never for an hour had she given him cause to regret it; but this lawyer brother of hers had, as I understood, offended my father by his slavish obsequiousness in days of prosperity and his venomous enmity in the days of trouble. He had hounded on the peasants until <b>my</b> <b>family</b> <b>had</b> been compelled to fly from the country, and had afterwards aided Robespierre in his worst excesses, receiving as a reward the castle and estate of Grosbois, which was our own. At the fall of Robespierre he had succeeded in conciliating Barras, and through every successive change he still managed to gain a fresh tenure of the property. Now it appeared from his letter that the new Emperor of France had also taken his part, though why he should befriend a man with such a history, and what service my Republican uncle could possibly render to him, were matters upon which I could form no opinion.|$|E
6000|$|By {{the time}} I {{was ten years}} old, <b>my</b> <b>family</b> <b>had</b> {{abandoned}} ranching and gone {{to live in the}} city. And here, at ten, I began on the streets as a newsboy. One of the reasons for this was that we needed the money. Another reason was that I needed the exercise. I had found my way to the free public library, and was reading myself into nervous prostration. On the poor ranches on which I had lived there had been no books. In ways truly miraculous, I had been lent four books, marvellous books, and them I had devoured. One was the life of Garfield; the second, Paul du Chaillu's African travels; the third, a novel by Ouida with the last forty pages missing; and the fourth, Irving's [...] "Alhambra." [...] This last had been lent me by a school-teacher. I was not a forward child. Unlike Oliver Twist, I was incapable of asking for more. When I returned the [...] "Alhambra" [...] to the teacher I hoped she would lend me another book. And because she did not--most likely she deemed me unappreciative--I cried all the way home on the three-mile tramp from the school to the ranch. I waited and yearned for her to lend me another book. Scores of times I nerved myself {{almost to the point of}} asking her, but never quite reached the necessary pitch of effrontery.|$|E

60|$|I {{put my hand}} on his knee. I {{actually}} {{loved him}} again as I had loved and yearned for him as a child,--he was so human, so dependable. And why couldn't this feeling last? He disapproved--foolishly, I thought--of my professional career, and this was only one of his limitations. But I knew that he was loyal. Why hadn't I been able to breathe and be reasonably happy in that atmosphere of friendship and love in which I had been placed--or rather in which I had placed myself?... Before the summer was a day or two older I had grown accustomed to being alone, and enjoyed the liberty; and when Maude and the children returned in the autumn, similarly, it took me some days {{to get used to the}} restrictions imposed by a household. I run the risk of shocking those who read this by declaring that if <b>my</b> <b>family</b> <b>had</b> been taken permanently out of my life, I should not long have missed them. But on the whole, in those years my marriage relation might be called a negative one. There were moments, as I have described, when I warmed to Maude, moments when I felt something akin to a violent antagonism aroused by little mannerisms and tricks she had. The fact that we got along as well as we did was probably due to the orthodox teaching with which we had been inoculated,--to the effect that matrimony was a moral trial, a shaking-down process. But moral trials were ceasing to appeal to people, and more and more of them were refusing to be shaken down. We didn't cut the Gordian knot, but we managed to loosen it considerably.|$|E
60|$|My dearest Mrs. Martin,--Will {{you believe}} that I began a letter to you before I took this step, {{to give you the}} whole story of the impulses towards it, feeling {{strongly}} that I owed what I considered my justification to such dear friends as yourself and Mr. Martin, that you might not hastily conclude that you had thrown away upon one who was quite unworthy the regard of years? I had begun such a letter--when, by the plan of going to Little Bookham, my plans were all hurried forward--changed--driven prematurely into action, and the last hours of agitation and deep anguish--for it was the deepest of its kind, to leave Wimpole Street and those whom I tenderly loved--so would not admit of my writing or thinking: only I was able to think that my beloved sisters would send you some account of me when I was gone. And now I hear from them that your generosity has not waited for a letter from me to do its best for me, and that instead of being vexed, as you might well be, at my leaving England without a word sent to you, you have used kind offices in my behalf, you have been more than the generous and affectionate friend I always considered you. So my first words must be that I am deeply grateful to you, my very dear friend, and that to the last moment of my life I shall remember the claim you have on my gratitude. Generous people are inclined to acquit generously; but it has been very painful to me to observe that with all my mere friends I have found more sympathy and trust, than in those who are of my own household and who have been daily witnesses of my life. I do not say this for papa, who is peculiar and in a peculiar position; but it pained me that----, who knew all that passed last year--for instance, about Pisa--who knew that the alternative of making a single effort to secure my health during the winter was the severe displeasure I have incurred now, and that the fruit of yielding myself a prisoner was the sense of being of no use nor comfort to any soul; papa having given up coming to see me except for five minutes, a day; ==--, who said to me with his own lips, 'He does not love you--do not think it' (said and repeated it two months ago)--that ---- should now turn round and reproach me for want of affection towards my family, for not letting myself drop like a dead weight into the abyss, a sacrifice without an object and expiation--this did surprise me and pain me--pained me more than all papa's dreadful words. But the personal feeling is nearer with most of us than the tenderest feeling for another; and <b>my</b> <b>family</b> <b>had</b> been so accustomed to the idea of my living on and on in that room, that while my heart was eating itself, their love for me was consoled, and at last the evil grew scarcely perceptible. It was no want of love in them, and quite natural in itself: we all get used to the thought of a tomb; and I was buried, that was the whole. It was a little thing even for myself a short time ago, and really it would be a pneumatological curiosity if I could describe and let you see how perfectly for years together, after what broke my heart at Torquay, I lived on the outside of my own life, blindly and darkly from day to day, as completely dead to hope of any kind as if I had my face against a grave, never feeling a personal instinct, taking trains of thought to carry out as an occupation absolutely indifferent to the me which is in every human being. Nobody quite understood this of me, because I am not morally a coward, and have a hatred of all the forms of audible groaning. But God knows what is within, and how utterly I had abdicated myself and thought it not worth while to put out my finger to touch my share of life. Even my poetry, which suddenly grew an interest, was a thing on the outside of me, a thing to be done, and then done! What people said of it did not touch me. A thoroughly morbid and desolate state it was, which I look back now to with the sort of horror with which one would look to one's graveclothes, if one had been clothed in them by mistake during a trance.|$|E

40|$|It {{has been}} over a century since the {{maternal}} side of <b>my</b> <b>family</b> <b>has</b> resided in the natal land of our cultural heritage and religious proclivities – Punjab, India, where Sikhism was established. As an American I continue this extension of our roots from their source. Through the process of shifting location, cultural confluence, and passing time {{the experiences of the}} women in each successive generation of <b>my</b> <b>family</b> <b>have</b> altered significantly through our diasporic existence. However, even in the aftermath of colonization and immigration, the enduring responsibility of women is reliant upon their relation to family. This ideology is imbued through the words of the Sikh holy text, the Guru Granth Sahib, as well as broader Indian cultural norms regarding gender roles. Implicit in the religious tradition of locating family in female members lies the practice of making women emblematic of cultural survival. Thus, within their role of sustaining physical life women also sustain culture. This becomes increasingly important when culture is extracted from its source. Despite dispersion across the world, the women in <b>my</b> <b>family</b> <b>have</b> continued to fulfill the responsibility of the safekeeping of culture and traditions. My series of three portraits, Daughter, Wife, Mother, illustrates the primary familial ties that determine an Indian woman’s identity throughout her life, and evokes the duty of cultural preservation that is associated with each of them.
