5000|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Blame It on the Girls" [...] was {{directed}} by Nez Khammal. An unfinished version of the video premiered on 3 October 2009 in the United Kingdom on Channel 4. The video starts {{in black and white}} with Mika sitting on a chair, wearing a bowler hat and holding a cane whilst speaking a prologue to the song. As the music starts the video bursts into colour, showing three screens behind Mika, each showing him in alternate colours of pink and blue. The screen to the left and right break away as female dancers dressed in half a tuxedo and half an orange dress dance into shot. As the chorus ends, the dancers disappear and Mika is seen sitting in a large sofa, he then gets up and moves over to a maze of mirrors, and then the girls join him again once the second chorus begins. The video is set in a film studio dressed in pastel colours with Mika playing a pastel pink piano. The video ends with him jumping into the air and the picture being frozen. The video features the appearance of the famous [...] "one take video" [...] seen in videos like OK Go's [...] "Here it Goes Again," [...] but actually contains cuts hidden with the use of portals. Portal transition is when the cut takes place within a movement into a different but similar image giving the appearance of one smooth camera movement but in reality has been cut. For example, at 1:50 minutes into the video we see this portal transition happen using the image in the mirror. Another example of the hidden editing in this music video is seen at 1:10 into the video where we get a cross dissolve cut from one <b>moving</b> <b>shot</b> to another giving the appearance of a swift moving camera. Other [...] "hidden cuts" [...] are at 2:21, 2:32 and 3:09.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to clarify the three dimensional structure of an open channelflow in a complex cross section experimentally. Tracer method was used to visualize a flowin a cross section, a horizontal section and a vertical section. Neutral tracers were illuminatedby a laser light sheet which was obtained from a 5 mW He-Ne gas laser. A video cameraand a still camera were used in a <b>moving</b> <b>shot</b> and a fixed shot, and many attractivepictures were obtained. The structure and formation process of longitudinal eddies near theboundary between a main channel and a flood plain were investigated. Based on theseresults, the three dimensional model of those eddies is shown...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{configuration}} of new soccer balls has closely approached a perfect round shape by not only {{reducing the number}} of panels but also by eliminating roughness of the panel joints by utilizing thermal bonding process recently. Therefore, in a non-rotating or low-rotating <b>moving</b> <b>shot,</b> a soccer ball drops and curves, i. e. motion by the change of wake flow, which is called a knuckle ball effect. Factors of the knuckle ball effect on the new soccer balls were investigated in case of a non-rotating shot and a low-rotating one. A correlation between fluctuation of the wake and fluid forces was identified in a symmetric panel {{configuration of}} the ball. The asymmetric configuration of the ball panel was also investigated as a factor to bring unpredictable change of the ball flight path. The low-rotating ball changes its frontal area against the moving direction and it produces irregular lateral forces. Consequently, the factors which produced the knuckle ball effect were found to be different from the case of non-rotating shots and low rotating shots...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} provide {{sophisticated}} access methods to the contents of video servers, {{it is necessary to}} automatically process and represent each video through a number of visual indexes. We focus on two tasks, namely the hierarchical representation of a video as a sequence of uniform segments (shots), and the characterization of each shot by a vector describing the camera motion parameters. For the first task we use a Bayesian classification approach to detecting scene cuts by analyzing motion vectors. Adaptability to different compression qualities is achieved by learning different classification masks. For the second task, the optical flow is processed in order to distinguish between stationary and moving shots. A least-squares fitting procedure determines the pan/tilt/zoom camera parameters within shots that present regular motion. Each shot is then indexed by a vector representing the dominant motion components and the type of motion. In order to minimize processing speed, all techniques process and analyze directly MPEG- 1 motion vectors, without need for video decompression. An overall processing rate of 59 frames/s is achieved on software. The successful classification performance, evaluated on various news video clips for a total of 61, 023 frames, attains 97. 7 % for the shot segmentation, 88. 4 % for the stationary vs. <b>moving</b> <b>shot</b> classification, and 94. 7 % for the detailed camera motion characterization...|$|E

50|$|The {{cinematography}} of D’Est’ {{uses only}} available light and is executed through long, real-time shots, {{contributing to the}} genuine and unstaged nature of the film. Akerman uses two main filming approaches: the stationary fixed perspective, with figures flowing towards the camera, and the tracking shot, with the camera moving slowly along streets and paths. The film also includes examples of the panning shot, where the camera rotates around a central point. The <b>moving</b> <b>shots</b> {{convey a sense of}} anxiety and vertigo. The stalking nature of the shots reveals the inhumanity of the camera.|$|R
50|$|Two {{new cars}} had been {{introduced}} at the Geneva Motor Show in 1961, a Jaguar E-Type and the Volvo P1800. Jaguar was first offered the opportunity to provide an E-Type for the TV series but declined. Volvo accepted and offered a P1800, leading to increased sales. Initially, Volvo lent two cars for the series, one for static studio shots {{and the other for}} <b>moving</b> <b>shots.</b> When the P1800S came along, one of the earlier cars was cut up to allow better interior shots. When the series Return of the Saint was created in the 1970s, Jaguar offered the then-new XJ-S for the series.|$|R
50|$|An {{extensively}} used {{technique in}} The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring was an enhancement of this principle {{which could be}} used in <b>moving</b> <b>shots.</b> Portions of sets were mounted on movable platforms which would move precisely according to the movement of the camera, so that the optical illusion would be preserved at all times {{for the duration of the}} shot. The same techniques were used in the Harry Potter movies to make the character Hagrid look like a giant. Props around Harry and his friends are of normal size, while seemingly identical props placed around Hagrid are in fact smaller.|$|R

The money saved on camera equipment was {{used to pay for}} shooting locations and to pay extras. They used the FiLMIC Pro app, a video app (to control focus, aperture and color temperature, as well as capture video clips at higher bit-rates) and an anamorphic adapter from Moondog Labs (to capture widescreen).

5000|$|In cinematography, the dolly grip {{places and}} moves the dolly track where required, and then pushes {{and pulls the}} dolly along that track during filming. A dolly grip works closely with the camera crew to perfect these complex {{movements}} through rehearsals. For <b>moving</b> <b>shots,</b> dolly grips may also push the wheeled platform that holds the microphone and Boom Operator. The dolly is a cart that the tripod and camera (and occasionally the camera crew) rest on. It transports the camera without bumps and visual interruptions throughout a shot. It is commonly used to follow beside an actor to give the audience the sense of walking with the actor, or as the actor.|$|R

5000|$|Furthermore, at {{a showing}} of L'Enfant de Paris at the French Film Library in 1951, Georges Sadoul stated: [...] "Perret made {{brilliant}} use of every editing resource at his disposal: varied camera angles, backlighting, his cameraman Specht's beautiful photography… all while working from a rather ordinary script that borrowed heavily from the Deux orphelines. Mixing Ennery's melodrama {{with a few}} jingoistic episodes, Léonce Perret was able to render a graceful and lively story by using an extraordinarily refined cinematic repertoire: backlighting, low-angle <b>shots,</b> close-ups, <b>moving</b> <b>shots</b> and numerous other innovations, all of which Perret implemented with flair, {{in stark contrast to}} Louis Feuillade's minimalist style and the still somewhat primitive technique of David W. Griffith at that time." [...] Thus, Perret demonstrated that the French cinematic technique of that time transcended that of the Americans.|$|R
5000|$|Moving Camera - A dynamic {{rather than}} static camera {{is often used}} for the same effect as editing. Though not {{expressly}} a form of montage, since editing isn’t required, a moving camera can cover movement across space continuously. Dynamic action, in which characters or objects move across protracted distances, was the motivating factor in choosing to move the camera. Peter Dart identifies relatively few uses of a moving camera {{in his analysis of}} Pudovkin’s Mother (1926), The End of St. Petersburg (1928), Storm Over Asia (1928), and Eisenstein’s Battleship Potemkin (1925). In all of these films and scenes, the moving camera captures movement. One reason for so few <b>moving</b> <b>shots</b> was that it provided undue continuity and forfeited the discontinuity demanded by the dialectical method of montage. Moving camera and mise en scene culminates in what we call the [...] "Inner Montage".|$|R

[...] David Carter of the cult horror webzine Savage Cinema says that Deodato's methods added a first-person quality to the film team's footage, claiming, [...] "The viewer feels as if they are there with the crew, experiencing the horrors with them." [...] Deodato was proud of other aspects of the cinematography, namely the numerous <b>moving</b> <b>shots</b> using a standard, shoulder-mounted camera, foregoing the use of a steadicam.|$|R

5|$|Shots {{where the}} {{spacecraft}} had parts in motion or the perspective changed were shot by directly filming the model. For most shots {{the model was}} stationary and camera was driven along a track on a special mount, the motor of which was mechanically linked to the camera motor—making it possible to repeat camera moves and match speeds exactly. Elements of the scene were recorded on same piece of film in separate passes to combine the lit model, stars, planets, or other spacecraft in the same <b>shot.</b> In <b>moving</b> <b>shots</b> of the long Discovery One spacecraft, {{in order to keep}} the entire model in focus, multiple passes had to be made with the lighting on it blocked out section by section. In each pass the camera would be focused on the one lit section. Many matting techniques were tried to block out the stars behind the models, with film makers sometimes resorting to hand tracing frame by frame around the image of the spacecraft (rotoscoping) to create the matte.|$|R

5000|$|During firing, {{the chamber}} {{pressure}} rises from atmospheric pressure to, {{in a typical}} rifle cartridge, pressures of about [...] within microseconds.
