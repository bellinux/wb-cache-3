40|$|This thesis has the {{objective}} of developing an optimal strategy for hydropower unit renewal timing. The whole river system is considered with revenues from day-ahead, as well as intraday, balancing and frequency containment reserve markets. The problem is addressed in three steps: by determining the new optimal river run strategy in each failure, by assessing its <b>monetary</b> <b>consequence</b> and by applying this information to investment strategy. A top-down approach for modelling river systems and calculating outage losses is presented. Lost production due to spillage is the largest driver of losses, before effects on captured price. Revenues streams outside the day-ahead market are insignificant in investment decisions. Failures in single-unit plants have the largest consequences, whereas two simultaneous failures in a river are a particular concern only when they occur in the same plant. A substantial share of losses is often realized in plants {{that do not have}} the unit failure. Investment in pre-emptive renewal should be high in single-unit plants, whereas plants with a high share of revenues from non-core streams are at risk of overinvestment...|$|R
40|$|My thesis {{challenges}} {{the central bank}} independence literature by demonstrating that the delegation of regulatory authority to an independent central bank can lead to asset price inflation and the outbreak of banking crisis. I argue that the central bank independence hypothesis ignores the <b>monetary</b> and fiscal <b>consequences</b> of financial regulation and is therefore conceptually incomplete. I explain the spread of banking crisis among the developing economies {{in terms of a}} contractual negotiation between central bank regulators and bank managers over the distribution of the monetary and fiscal outputs of the banking system. My thesis argues that regulatory actions generate <b>monetary</b> and fiscal <b>consequences</b> that privilege some members of society and discriminate against others, and thus delegating regulatory authority to an independent central bank may not eliminate the conflict between the interests of bank managers, shareholders and taxpayers. The substantive chapters of my thesis consist of an empirical investigation of regulatory politics in Thailand and Taiwan. My research is based upon extensive interviews that I conducted at 4 Thai commercial banks, 10 Taiwanese commercial banks. As a result, my research not only offers a new explanation for financial system dynamics, but uses never before published information in order to reconstruct the decision-making environment of bank managers and financial regulators...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{advances}} {{the hypothesis}} that the transition from there-is-little-central-banks-can-do-to-control-inflation to inflation targeting occurred because central banks, especially the Federal Reserve, demonstrated that central banks can control inflation rather than a consequence of marked improvement in the professions understanding of how monetary policy controls inflation. As <b>consequence,</b> <b>monetary</b> theorists and central bankers have returned to a Phillips curve framework for formulating and evaluating the monetary policy.

As a <b>consequence,</b> <b>monetary</b> union enlargement {{may lead to}} a more aggressive fiscal stance in some member countries, depending on their relative economic and political weights, on their government’s spending target, and on the change in the degree of uncertainty that they experience with the enlargement. monetary union, fiscal policy, transparency of monetary policy, asymmetries...|$|R
50|$|General {{bankruptcy}} principles {{hold that}} executory contracts are avoidable in practice, because neither party has fulfilled {{its part of}} the bargain and thus breach by either party only gives rise to expectation damages. Damages awards after commencement of a bankruptcy filing results in claims that take after more senior creditors. They are relegated {{to the status of}} general creditors because while breach would occur after filing of the bankruptcy petition, the contract was entered into before the filing. If a creditor is a general unsecured creditor and there is not enough money, they usually are not paid; so as a matter of practical economics, if the downturn in a company's fortunes which resulted in bankruptcy makes the performance of an executory contract less valuable than its breach, the rational company would breach. There would be no negative <b>monetary</b> <b>consequences</b> of such breach because there would be no money left for the other contract party to take because in practice general unsecured creditors are left with nothing.|$|E

Working Paper No. Non-uniform wage-staggering: european evidence and monetary policy implications Michel Juillard (1) Hervé Le Bihan (2) and Stephen Millard (3) In many countries, wage changes tend to be clustered {{in the beginning of the}} year, with wages being set for xed durations of typically one year.

Motivated by this evidence we build a model of uneven wage staggering, embedded in a standard DSGE model of the euro area, and investigate the <b>monetary</b> policy <b>consequences</b> of non-synchronised wage setting. The model has the potential to generate responses to monetary policy shocks that differ according to the timing of the shock. Using a realistic calibration of the seasonality in wage-setting, based on a wide survey of European rms, the quantitative difference across quarters turns out however to be moderate. Relatedly, we obtain that the optimal monetary policy rule does not vary much across quarters. JEL classi cation: E 27 E 52 (1) Banque de France...|$|R

40|$|We study {{conditional}} cooperation {{based on}} a sequential two-person linear public good game in which a trusting first contributor can be exploited by a second contributor. After playing this game the first contributor is allowed to punish the second contributor. The consequences of sanctioning depend on the treatment: whereas punishment can reduce inequality in one treatment, it only creates another inequality in the other. To capture the effect of delay on punishment both treatments are run once with immediate and once with delayed punishment. Moreover, to investigate the effect of pure voice, all four treatments are also run in a virtual condition with no <b>monetary</b> <b>consequences</b> of punishment. Results show the emergence across all conditions of a strong norm of conditional cooperation. Punishment is generally low, it is higher when not delayed {{and it is not}} used to reduce inequality in payoffs.

Building on a representative, longitudinal sample of more than 12, 000 individuals from the German Socio-Economic Panel Study (SOEP), we apply fixed effects regressions and find a significantly positive effect of PA on job satisfaction, which is driven by appraisals that are linked to monetary outcomes. Furthermore, the moderating effects of personality traits (Big Five, locus of control) on the relationship between PA and job satisfaction are explored. We find a negative interaction term between PA without any <b>monetary</b> <b>consequences</b> and both employees scoring high on openness to experience and internal locus of control. This suggests that for these employees appraisals, which induce performance monitoring without any <b>monetary</b> <b>consequences,</b> have a detrimental effect on job satisfaction rates...|$|E

Such perception of losses also increases the attractiveness (perceived probabilities and estimated consequences) of the risky option. The results also confirm that the domain (professional versus private) of a decision is a factor influencing risk-taking behavior.

In Japan the call rate (the overnight cash rate analogous to the federal funds rate in the United States) has been within 50 basis points of zero since October 1995, and it has been essentially equal to zero {{for most of the past}} four years (figure 1). Thus the Bank of Japan has had little room to further reduce shortterm nominal interest rates in all that time. Meanwhile Japan’s growth has remained anemic, and prices have continued to fall, suggesting a need for monetary stimulus. Yet the usual remedy—lower short-term nominal interest rates—is plainly unavailable. Vigorous expansion of the monetary base has also seemed to do little to stimulate demand under these circumstances: as figure 1 also shows, the monetary base is now more than twice as large, relative to GDP, as it was in the early 1990 s...|$|R
