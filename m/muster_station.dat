40|$|Background and Aim: Human error often {{plays an}} {{important}} role in accident causation either through direct action or poor design. The focus of this work was on prediction of human error probabilities during the process of emergency musters in gas compressor stations. This paper aims to present a brief description of Human Error Probability Index (HEPI) for the gas compressor <b>station</b> <b>musters</b> process. Materials and Methods: Due to a lack of human error databases, and in particular human error data on gas compressor <b>station</b> <b>musters,</b> an expert judgment technique, the Success Likelihood Index Methodology (SLIM), was adopted as a means to predict human error probabilities Two muster scenarios of varying severity (gas release, fire and explosion) were studied in detail. A total of 34 reference graphs provided data for both the weighting and rating of six performance shaping factors and the data were subsequently processed by means of SLIM to calculate the probability of success for 16 muster actions ranging from point of muster initiator to the final actions in the temporary safe refuge (TSR). The actions were categorized into 4 phases, namely, awareness, evaluation, egress, and recovery phases. The six performance shaping factors considered in this work were stress, complexity, training, experience, event factors, and atmospheric factors. Results: Human error probabilities in the egress phase were highest, followed by those in the evaluation phase; the lowest were in the awareness phase. Conclusion: The HEPI can be applied to limit the chances of human error occurrence and mitigate the consequences of such errors through changes in training, design, safety systems, and procedures, resulting in a more error-tolerant design and operation...|$|R

2500|$|According to the French press, it {{was only}} after this {{official}} business had been completed that serious trouble began. [...] The Mayor of Tunis, Sadok Ghileb, arrived at the cemetery, and crowds pressed around him, demanding that he have the gates of the cemetery opened. [...] To reassure them, he did so and went inside with a number of them. The crowd was not calmed however, and began demanding the release of those who had been arrested earlier in the morning. Ghileb then sent for Espiau, who returned to the cemetery and gave the crowd assurances about the release of those being detained. The crowd however continued to grow larger and angrier, and Espiau decided to go and bring police reinforcements. [...] He made his way with difficulty through the mass of people, and as he headed off he was struck from behind by a number of stones. A scuffle began, with the police trying to get Espiau and Ghileb safely away from the cemetery, striking protesters with their batons while the crowd threw pieces of rubble at them. Brigadier François Franchi was killed, while two police inspectors and four or five other officers were injured. The French press reported that the police fired on the crowd, but did not report numbers of dead and injured among the protesters at the cemetery.

[...] The branch was dieselised in 1968, and at this stage, despite the relaxation of laws and removal of subsidies that had benefited rail, it was still necessary to run two trains daily. [...] In July 1975, a major storm severely damaged pine growth in the Balmoral State Forest, and the resulting timber that had to be transported resulted in a surge for the line. [...] Multiple trains were required to run daily, sometimes hauled by two locomotives, and this traffic lasted for two years. [...] When it finally ceased in late 1977, the line suddenly became uneconomic. No other traffic existed that was sufficient to justify the line's continued existence, and closure occurred on 15 January 1978.|$|R
60|$|The {{guns were}} cleared of their lumber and loosened. The {{bulkheads}} were knocked down, and the cabin relieved of its furniture; and the gun-deck exhibited one unbroken line of formidable cannon, arranged {{in all the}} order of a naval battery ready to engage. Arm-chests were thrown open, and the decks strewed with pikes, cutlasses, pistols, and all the various weapons for boarding. In short, the yards were slung, and every other arrangement was made with a readiness and dexterity that were actually wonderful, though all was performed amid an appearance of disorder and confusion that rendered the ship another Babel during the continuance of the preparations. In a very few minutes everything was completed, and even the voices of the men ceased to be heard answering to their names, as they were <b>mustered</b> at their <b>stations,</b> by their respective officers. Gradually the ship became as quiet as the grave; and when even Griffith or his commander found it necessary to speak, their voices were calmer, and their tones more mild than usual. The course of the vessel was changed to an oblique line from that in which their enemy was approaching, though the appearance of flight was to be studiously avoided to the last moment. When nothing further remained to be done, every eye became fixed on the enormous pile of swelling canvas that was rising, in cloud over cloud, far above the fog, and which was manifestly moving, like driving vapor, swiftly to the north. Presently the dull, smoky boundary of the mist which rested on the water was pushed aside in vast volumes, and the long taper spars that projected from the bowsprit of the strange ship issued from the obscurity, and were quickly followed by the whole of the enormous fabric to which they were merely light appendages. For a moment, streaks of reluctant vapor clung to the huge floating pile; but they were soon shaken off by the rapid vessel, and the whole of her black hull became distinct to the eye.|$|R
