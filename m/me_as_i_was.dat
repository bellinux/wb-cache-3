500|$|Cheney {{has said}} {{his time at}} the Pentagon was the most {{rewarding}} period of his public service career, calling it [...] "the one that stands out." [...] In 2014, Cheney recounted that when he met with President George H. W. Bush to accept the offer, he passed a painting in the private residence entitled The Peacemakers, which depicted President Lincoln, General Grant, and William Tecumseh Sherman. [...] "My great-grandfather had served under William Tecumseh Sherman throughout the war," [...] Cheney said, [...] "and it occurred to <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> in the room as I walked in {{to talk to the}} President about becoming Secretary of Defense, I wondered what he would have thought that his great-grandson would someday be in the White House with the President talking about taking over the reins of the U.S. military." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1970 Clyde Packer became joint {{managing}} director of Nine Network with his father, Frank. Clyde later recalled: [...] "t was a very equitable arrangement ... I had the responsibility {{and he had the}} authority". Late in the next year Clyde Packer launched A Current Affair on the Nine network, with Mike Willesee hosting. In 1972, Willesee organised for A Current Affair to have an on-air interview with then-union leader, Bob Hawke, during an industrial dispute. When Frank heard of the arrangement he vetoed the decision to allow Hawke on his network, undermining Clyde's authority. Willesee later declared: [...] "You can't run a current affairs program, as you couldn't run a serious newspaper, and have people tell you you can't have the leader of the Trade Union movement". Packer resigned his posts at the Nine Network and ACP, and later reflected on the split: [...] "I suspect my father was as glad to get rid of <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> to get rid of him".|$|E
2500|$|Jobs's {{biological}} mother Schieble became pregnant {{with him in}} 1954 when she and Jandali spent the summer {{with his family in}} Homs, Syria. Jandali has stated that he [...] "was very much in love with Joanne ... but sadly, her father was a tyrant, and forbade her to marry <b>me,</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> from Syria. And so she told me she wanted to give the baby up for adoption." [...] Jobs told his official biographer that Schieble's father was dying at the time, Schieble did not want to aggravate him, and both felt that at 23 they were too young to marry. In addition, as there was a strong stigma against bearing a child out of wedlock and raising it as a single mother, and as abortions were illegal and dangerous, adoption was the only option women had in the United States in 1954. According to Jandali, Schieble deliberately did not involve him in the process: [...] "without telling me, Joanne upped and left to move to San Francisco to have the baby without anyone knowing, including me ... {{she did not want to}} bring shame onto the family and thought this was the best for everyone." [...] Schieble put herself in the care of a [...] "doctor who sheltered unwed mothers, delivered their babies, and quietly arranged closed adoptions." ...|$|E
