In recent years, iron phosphate baits have emerged and are preferred over the more toxic metaldehyde, especially because domestic or wild animals may {{be exposed to the}} bait. The environmentally safer iron phosphate {{has been shown to be}} at least as effective as baits. <b>Methiocarb</b> baits are no longer widely used. Parasitic nematodes (Phasmarhabditis hermaphrodita) are a commercially available biological control method that are effective against a wide range of common slug species. The nematodes are applied in water and actively seek out slugs in the soil and infect them, leading to the death of the slug. This control method is suitable for use in organic growing systems. Other slug control methods are generally ineffective on a large scale, but can be somewhat useful in small gardens. These include beer traps, diatomaceous earth, crushed eggshells, coffee grounds, and copper. It is of scientific interest that salt kills slugs by causing water to leave the body owing to osmosis but this is not used for agricultural control as soil salinity is detrimental to crops.|$|E
50|$|Because <b>methiocarb</b> {{is widely}} used as an {{insecticide}} on crops, environmental risks were also studied to establish safety risks for human health. The metabolism of <b>methiocarb</b> in plants, soil and water have been proposed from radiolabeled 14Cmethiocarb studies. In plants the major metabolites were <b>methiocarb</b> sulfoxide and <b>methiocarb</b> sulfoxide phenol. Environmental fate in water and soil has been determined from the metabolites formed by (an)aerobic degradation, photolysis, adsorption and leaching of <b>methiocarb.</b> In soil the half life of <b>methiocarb</b> sulfone phenol is 20 days, <b>methiocarb</b> sulfoxide phenol is 2 days, <b>methiocarb</b> 1.5 days and <b>methiocarb</b> sulfoxide 6 days. <b>Methiocarb</b> is mainly metabolized to <b>methiocarb</b> phenol and minor to <b>methiocarb</b> sulfoxide and <b>methiocarb</b> sulfoxide phenol. Also after 217 days no <b>methiocarb</b> or metabolites are present anymore in the soil. This is {{because a lot of}} gets metabolized to CO2. In water no <b>methiocarb</b> was present already after 32 days. The half life of <b>methiocarb</b> in water is strongly pH dependent but at pH 7 the half life is about 28 days.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Methiocarb</b> is a {{carbamate}} pesticide {{which is}} used as a bird repellent, insecticide, acaricide and molluscicide [...] since the 1960s. Carbamates are widely used in agriculture as insecticides and herbicides. They are preferred instead of organochlorines because organochlorines are long lasting persistent in crops. <b>Methiocarb</b> has contact and stomach action on mites and neurotoxic effects on molluscs. Seeds treated with <b>methiocarb</b> also affects birds. Like the other carbamates, <b>methiocarb</b> inhibits reversibly acetylcholinesterase activity resulting in a cholinergic stimulation making <b>methiocarb</b> a potent neurotoxin. It can even cause acute toxicity in humans if exposed {{for long periods of time}} or a sufficient dose. It is not listed as a carcinogen. [...] <b>Methiocarb</b> is also a known poison to water organisms. Other names for <b>methiocarb</b> are mesurol and mercaptodimethur.|$|E
50|$|In {{one study}} <b>methiocarb</b> {{is shown to}} be not very {{effective}} against mice as an rodenticide. In the first field trial, snail pellets of <b>methiocarb</b> were spread across the land, and killed almost 23% of the initial mice population in one night, but the population did not decrease (probably because of reinvasion of the neighbouring land). There hasn't been searched for carcasses after that, but birds were seen scavenging on carcasses.In the second field trial, grain was covered in <b>methiocarb</b> and strychnine and it showed a mortality rate of 40% for <b>methiocarb</b> and 90% for strychnine. Although <b>methiocarb</b> seems to be effective at first. Mice develop an aversion for the <b>methiocarb,</b> which makes it not very effective as rodenticide.|$|E
50|$|In {{another study}} with quelea, it was {{investigated}} if <b>methiocarb</b> had an {{adverse effect on}} the food choice. It showed that when quelea ate seeds with <b>methiocarb,</b> {{the next time they}} would chose some other food. This shows that <b>methiocarb</b> can be effective as a bird repellent.|$|E
50|$|<b>Methiocarb</b> is a plant {{protection}} agent and while suicide with {{these type of}} toxins is rare, there is one case reported of a suicide with methiocarb.An 80-year-old woman in Germany killed herself by drinking a bottle of Mesurol. The red/pink fluid was on her cloths, face and hands (probably because of the vomiting) and in the gastrointestinal tract as in the respiratory tract. The toxicological examination showed that the <b>methiocarb</b> uptake wasn’t completed and the concentration of <b>methiocarb</b> and its metabolite in the urine was low. This {{is due to the}} short duration of exposure. Elevated concentration of <b>methiocarb</b> may be the result from post-mortem uptake, but it could also be the post-mortem redistribution of <b>methiocarb</b> and metabolites from the gastrointestinal tract.The conclusion of the toxicological examination was death by acute poisoning of <b>methiocarb.</b>|$|E
50|$|For the {{use as a}} {{molluscicide}} <b>methiocarb</b> is effective, but at a high dose. In {{a research}} with E. vermiculata, <b>methiocarb</b> showed {{to be the most}} effective as topical applicant (although DMSO was used as an solvent). The LD50 is 414 μg per snail and the LD99,99 is roughly estimated 1400 μg per snail for <b>methiocarb.</b> In comparison to methomyl which was more effective, with its LD50 was 90 μg per snail.

50|$|The {{amount of}} <b>methiocarb</b> {{in the stomach}} is {{calculated}} to compare it with the LD50 of rats. The amount of <b>methiocarb</b> is estimated to have been 6.1 gram (by a stomach volume of 1L). The weight of this woman was 53 kg. That would make 115 mg/kg bw. When compared to the LD50 for rats, which is 30 mg/kg, {{it is reasonable to}} say that this woman died of poisoning from methiocarb.Bear in mind that this is only the amount of <b>methiocarb</b> found in the stomach and that the rest was already <b>methiocarb</b> distributed through the body.|$|E
50|$|As snail bait <b>methiocarb</b> has {{the same}} {{effectiveness}} as methomyl for 1% (mass percent) and 2%. but the LC50 of <b>methiocarb</b> {{is higher than the}} one of methomyl. 0.93:0.31.They both reached an average mortality of 85%, by the use of 2% methiocarb/methomyl bait.|$|E
50|$|As an avian {{repelled}} {{to protect}} fruit, <b>methiocarb</b> {{was in one}} research not effective. The birds still damaged the figs.

In that manner these birds are very little or not exposed to the repellent.|$|E
50|$|In another {{comparison}} study (with M. obstructa) between <b>methiocarb</b> and methomyl. Methomyl showed {{again to}} be more effective.

50|$|When <b>methiocarb</b> is fed to rats at {{a dose of}} 50 ppm, {{it gives}} a {{reduction}} of brain cholinesterase by 14% and 5% in males and females respectively.When <b>methiocarb</b> is administered as an aerosol to rats, the highest concentration (96 mg/m3 in solvent) showed signs of involuntary muscle contraction (tremors). These signs weren’t observed in the other groups. The brain acetylcholine esterase is reduced {{in comparison to the}} solvent controls, to 61% and 74% for males and females respectively. There were no changes in organ weight. The NOAEL was determined to be 6 mg/m3 based on the reduction of brain acetylcholine esterase activity.|$|E

50|$|To {{determine}} {{the distribution of}} <b>methiocarb</b> through the body carbon-14 (14C) labeled <b>methiocarb</b> studies have been performed on rats. About 8 hours after IP injection of 14Cmethiocarb more than 20 {{is present in the}} kidneys, 14 in the lungs, 14 in the heart, 6 in the body fat and 26 in the red blood cells. All the numbers are a measure of the radioactivity in dpm x 103/g of dried tissue. 30 Minutes after treatment gave, for all tissues except bodyfat, much higher values indicating that elimination takes place shortly after injection. Also an increase in all tissues except the red blood cells has been observed between 2 and 4 hours after injection. This indicates that after two hours redistribution takes place shortly followed by elimination. This radioactivity study only measured the 14C so the compound could already be metabolized to different compounds with different toxicities, which is not indicated in this study.|$|E
50|$|In mice {{a one-year}} study of 50 males and 50 females was performed. The mice {{received}} diets containing <b>methiocarb</b> at doses of 0, 15, 43 and 130 mg/kg bw {{per day in}} males and 0, 20, 57, and 170 mg/kg bw per day in females. Food consumption, behaviour and mortality rate were not affected at any dose. At one month the decrease in plasma acetylcholinesterase activity was the highest and the smallest reductions were observed at 24 months. Brain acetylcholinesterase activity was also lowered, more in males than in females.In rats a two-year study of 60 rats was performed. The rats received diets containing 0, 3.3, 9.3 and 29 mg/kg bw per day for males and 0, 5, 14, and 42 mg/kg bw per day for females. Food consumption, behaviour and mortality rate were not affected at any dose. The total protein concentrations were raised at higher doses of <b>methiocarb.</b> The plasma acetylcholinesterase activity was lowered at the high dose at day one and from eight weeks onwards in males and at day one and 1, 2, 4 and 13 weeks in females. No brain acetylcholinesterase activity was observed.|$|E
50|$|<b>Methiocarb</b> can {{be taken}} up through {{different}} routes. The most common for humans is up take through the skin or as an aerosol, because of its use as a pesticide in agriculture. For insects and birds this would be by the oral route. The NOAEL’s of these routes have been determined as follows: For the oral route the NOAEL is set to 3.3 mg/kg per day for rats, based on a 2-year study. For absorption through the skin the NOAEL is set to 150 mg/kg per day for rabbits, based on the reduction of food consumption.|$|E
50|$|The {{product of}} the {{cleavage}} of the carbamate group of <b>methiocarb</b> is methylcarbamic acid which is bound to choline sterase after the reaction. The normal function of choline sterase is to cleave the acetyl-choline bond which results in the binding of acetic acid to choline sterase which is a fast reversible reaction. The carbamic acid also reversibly binds but the hydrolysis of the bond is slower and therefore the acid inhibits the function of choline sterase which results in elevated choline sterase levels. In comparison: organophosphates inhibit irriversibly and will therefore inhibit the acetylcholinesterase even more.|$|E
50|$|In rats the cholinesterase {{activity}} fell down to 50 {{percent of the}} control values in 27 days where the dose applied in their diet was 2 mg/ kg bw {{in the first three}} days and 4 mg/kg bw for the next 24 days. No abnormal clinical signs were observed. In rabbits <b>methiocarb</b> was applied to the skin to a group of ten at doses of 0, 60, 150 or 375 mg/kg bw per day for 6 h/day. Two out of ten rabbits with the low dose did not survive and with the high dose had a reduced food consumption. Cholinesterase activity was reduced in males with a high dose at 14 and 21 days of treatment. There were no intergroup differences observed in {{cholinesterase activity}} among females. The erythrocyte acetylcholinesterase activity is apparently not inhibited in a dose-related fashion. The duration of the study was 24 days.|$|E

40|$|The small African weaver finch {{commonly}} known as Quelea (Quelea quelea) has been reported (Crook and Ward, 1968) {{to be one of}} the most numerous and destructive birds in the world and is found extensively throughout Africa (DeGrazio, 1974). Quelea have been associated with damage to many agricultural crops including millet, grain sorghum, rice, and wheat. Because current population control programs in Africa have not reduced damage except in a few local areas (Crook and Ward, 1968), more effective damage control methods need to be Inves- tigated. One promising method, protection of the agricultural crop with a chemical repellent, <b>methiocarb,</b> has been demonstrated to be highly effective (Guarino, 1972). Small scale efficacy demonstrations in Tanzania (DeGrazio, 1974) with three pounds of <b>methiocarb</b> per acre to protect maturing rice and wheat have reduced Quelea damage by about 90 percent. <b>Methiocarb</b> is thought to produce a post-ingestional effect in the affected birds (Guarino, 1972). Rogers (1974) has presented some evidence that <b>methiocarb,</b> unlike a highly bitter-tasting compound (sucrose octaacetate), affects feeding activity of Red-winged Blackbirds (Ageliaus phoenlceus), but some time delay is required for affectation and subsequent feeding aversion. The development of the repellent (or aversion) response for <b>methiocarb</b> was similar to the aversive response shown to lithium chloride (LiCl), a salt that has been traditionally used to study conditioned aversion in rats (Nachman, 1963). This aversion effect is then thought to become quickly associated with the taste of <b>methiocarb</b> or treated food material (Crase and DeHaven, 1976). Schafer, Brunton, and Lockyer (1977) observed that most of the seven bird species they tested [Robins (Turdus migratorius), Brown-headed Cowbirds (Molothrus ater), White-crowned Sparrows (zonotrlchia leucophrys). House Sparrows (Passer domesticus), Starlings (sturnus vulgaris), Grackles (Quiscalus qaiscula), and Red-winged Blackbirds] displayed more food aversion and longer-lasting conditioning to <b>methiocarb</b> when compared with thiram (TMTD), a taste repellent. Both repellent materials were placed on food particles at levels slightly lower than the R- 50 for Red-winged Blackbirds (Schafer and Brunton, 1971). To more effectively predict field application rates for protecting cereal grains from Quelea damage in Africa, we felt it necessary to compare the sensitivity of Quelea to <b>methiocarb</b> with sensitivities reported for other bird species (Schafer and Brunton, 1971). In addition, we wanted to determine the relative importance of taste versus visual feeding cues that could become associated with <b>methiocarb</b> exposure in Quelea. Knowledge gained from these studies could lead to an improved application method that would enhance the long-term repellent action of <b>methiocarb</b> with low level <b>methiocarb</b> treatments in conjunction with other stimuli. Aversive cues could also be used to alter food-searching behavior (Crase and DeHaven, 1976) so that Quelea repelled from agricultural crops would more quickly seek alternate natural foods such as grass or weed seeds and Insects...|$|E
