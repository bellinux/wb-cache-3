40|$|Recently, {{there have}} been a few {{research}} efforts towards extending the capabilities of fieldbus networks to encompass wireless support. In previous works we have proposed a hybrid wired/wireless PROFIBUS network solution where the interconnection between the heterogeneous communication media was accomplished through bridge-like interconnecting devices. The resulting networking architecture embraced a Multiple Logical Ring (MLR) approach, thus with multiple independent tokens, where the communication between different domains was supported by the Inter-Domain Protocol (IDP). The proposed architecture also supports mobility of stations between different wireless cells. To that hybrid wired/wireless networking architecture we have proposed a worst-case response timing analysis of the IDP, without considering inter-cell mobility (or handoff) of stations. In this paper, we advance that previous work by proposing a worst-case timing analysis of the <b>mobility</b> <b>procedure...</b>|$|E

An Ultra Flat Architecture (UFA), based on SIP and designed with the primary goal of being scalable, has been introduced in a previous paper. In this paper, the limitations of current 3 GPP architectures are discussed and detailed explanations of UFA interest and procedures are provided. UFA is entirely controlled by the operator and integrates QoS in its establishment and mobility procedures. To prove its concept and assess the performance of its <b>mobility</b> <b>procedure,</b> UFA is implemented on a testbed.

30|$|The {{properties}} of ad hoc networks {{must also be}} covered in designing routing protocols for CRAHNs. Node mobility encourages spectrum utilization variation not only in time domain but also in space domain. For the mobile SUs, the spectrum availability at the new location has to be immediately sensed. The adaptation of spectrum sensing result in real-time manner could be very challenging. Thus, efficient spectrum <b>mobility</b> <b>procedure</b> should be considered when designing the routing protocols for CRAHNs. Another characteristic of ad hoc networks is self-configuration. With {{the absence of a}} centralized body, all nodes should exchange network-related information in distributed manners via a control channel, so they could organize their data transmissions on the shared wireless medium with minimum transmission failure. In the cognitive radio network environment, the set of available spectrum bands might be different from node to node and might be scarce from time to time. Thus, dedicating some channels to be the common control channels is a questionable implementation. Besides having to solve the control channel issue, routing protocols designed for CRAHNs should not assume bi-directional links. Unidirectional links occur because different nodes might have diverse transmission ranges.|$|E

40|$|Abstract The IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) is {{considered}} as the common platform for providing a unified session control {{on top of}} various access network technologies for multi-media applications. At the same time, we are witnessing how wireless technologies {{become an integral part}} of our daily life, due to an increasing number of mobile multi-interface devices and the proliferation of wireless access networks. In this context the availability of transparent mobility management mechanisms is a key element to enhance user’s quality of experience. On the other hand, context-awareness is a vital ingredient to allow mobile devices to make appropriate and timely mobility decisions. The benefits of using diverse context information (e. g., about the user, the service and the network) to manage mobility are twofold. First, the richer information is available, the more likely an intelligent decision can be taken. Second, it allows the network to assist the terminal to take mobility decisions, even up to the point of automatically initiating a <b>mobility</b> <b>procedure</b> if according to the context and user preferences this improves the user’s quality of experience. In this paper we propose CATMISS, a solution to support context-aware mobility in IMS services. The solution is based on SIP signalling and makes mobility transparent for communication peers of mobile terminals. Two types of mobility are supported: a terminal changing of access network and a multimedia session being transferred from one terminal to another. The paper also describes the implementation of the solution and its deployment in an experimental platform. Experiments in this platform, with IPTV and videoconference services, are used to validate the proposal...|$|E

Even the Personal Digital Assistants and Smartphones are being equipped with WLAN, leading such devices to operate in dual-mode with the WLAN and WAN (Wide Area Network) radios capable of supporting IP communication. This development enables applications such as VoIP to roam or handover freely across the two networks. Seamless handover of VoIP between such networks poses two challenges: the call must persist in spite of mobility across networks, and the LAN and WAN must support the delay and packet loss requirement bounds for VoIP calls.
