5|$|A {{well-known}} {{variant of}} the sun disc design is the sun disc with 16 red rays in a Siemens star formation, which was also historically used by Japan's military, particularly the Imperial Japanese Army and the Imperial Japanese Navy. The ensign, known in Japanese as the , was first adopted as the War flag on May 15, 1870, and was used {{until the end of}} World WarII in 1945. It was re-adopted on June 30, 1954, and is now used as the war flag and naval ensign of the Japan Ground Self-Defense Force (JGSDF) and the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force (JMSDF). In Korea and China, this flag still carries a negative connotation. The JMSDF also employs the use of a <b>masthead</b> pennant. First adopted in 1914 and readopted in 1965, the <b>masthead</b> pennant contains a simplified version of the naval ensign at the hoist end, {{with the rest of the}} pennant colored white. The ratio of the pennant is between 1:40 and 1:90.|$|E
5|$|The pole {{foremast}} {{was modified}} to a tripod after 1916. This {{was due to}} the increased weight of <b>masthead</b> fire-control equipment associated with director firing. In 1917 Lion and Princess Royal received searchlight towers on the aft funnel and mainmast while losing one four-inch gun each from the aft battery. In early 1918, both ships received flying-off platforms on 'Q' and 'X' turrets for Sopwith Pup and Sopwith 1½ Strutter aircraft, and Lion was fitted with a torpedo control station at the aft end of her aft superstructure.|$|E

5|$|The {{publisher}} was Galaxy Publishing Corporation, New York. The {{magazine was}} initially titled Beyond Fantasy Fiction, and this remained the title on the <b>masthead</b> throughout the ten-issue run. However, issue 9 changed the title to simply Beyond Fiction {{on the cover}}, spine, and table of contents. Issue 10 used the new, shorter title on the cover and spine, but reverted to Beyond Fantasy Fiction for the table of contents. As a result, the magazine is often listed as having changed its name {{for the last two}} issues.|$|E
5|$|Z39s sensor suite {{included}} a FuMO 21 radar, which {{was placed on}} the ship's bridge, and four FuMB4 Sumatra aerials on the foremast searchlights. She also had several other radars, including a FuMB 3 Bali and FuMO 81 Berlin-S on her <b>masthead,</b> and a FuMO 63 Hohentwei. She also had a degaussing cable which wrapped around the entire ship, but was covered by her spray deflector.|$|E
5|$|A naval ensign {{has been}} used by Lithuania {{starting}} in 1992. The ensign has a white background charged with a blue cross, with the national flag in the canton. The width of each cross is 1/7th of the total width of the ensign, with the ratio being 1:2. Historically, this flag was used as the ensign of the Kaunas Yacht Club, but with a different ratio of 2:3. The naval jack consists of a white field, charged with a blue anchor covered by the naval badge of Lithuania. The badge consists of the Columns of Gediminas in yellow on a red disc. A <b>masthead</b> pennant have been adopted by the Lithuanian Navy to use on their ships.|$|E

5|$|Aigle was {{in action}} again on 22 March 1808 against two large, French frigates; Italienne of 40 guns and the 38-gun Sirene. A {{squadron}} comprising Aigle, the 32-gun frigate , the two seventy-fours Impétueux and , {{and two or}} three smaller vessels were anchored between the Glénan islands, whilst being resupplied by a transport convoy. At 15:45, two French frigates to the south-east were simultaneously seen from Aigle's <b>masthead</b> and by the British schooner , which was stationed midway between the squadron and the island of Groix. Aigle immediately gave chase, and coming within hailing distance at 19:30, Wolfe directed Cuckoo to relay to Impétueux and Narcissus, now following two miles behind, his intention to cut off the French ships by sailing between Groix and the mainland.|$|E
5|$|Bibliographers do {{not always}} agree who should be listed as editor of any given issue of Amazing. For example, Gernsback was in control {{for the first three}} years, but Sloane {{performed}} all the editorial duties related to fiction, and he is sometimes described as the editor. Similarly, later editors were sometimes under the supervision of editorial directors. The table below, and the charts above, generally follow the mastheads in the magazines, with short notes added. More details are given in the publishing history section, above, which focuses on when the editors involved actually obtained control of the magazine contents, instead of when their names appeared on the <b>masthead.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1964, {{the largest}} {{earthquake}} ever {{recorded in the}} United States struck Anchorage and southern Alaska, cutting communications to the outside world. The quake was felt in Fairbanks, and it took 40 minutes for communications to be re-established with the Associated Press office in Seattle. When the connection was restored, the News-Miner sent the first reports of the earthquake to the outside world. The quake also destroyed {{the offices of the}} Anchorage Times, the leading newspaper in that city. The News-Miner offered its press facilities to the Times, and the two papers shared a <b>masthead</b> as Anchorage recovered from the tremor.|$|E

5|$|Shortly {{before the}} earthquake, the News-Miner placed {{an order for}} a modern offset {{printing}} press. To house the new press, which could not fit in the Lathrop Building, Snedden ordered {{the construction of a}} new printing facility and office—named the Aurora Building—north of the Chena River. The Alaska Railroad sold Snedden the land for the building, which was built at a cost of $1 million in 1965. Snedden ordered the foundation for the new building to be raised 22 inches above the 100-year flood line. This fact saved the News-Miner two years later, when a massive flood swept through Fairbanks. The water was three inches deep throughout the paper's offices and even deeper in the press and boiler rooms, which were slightly below that raised level. The flood halted production for a time, and the Anchorage Times reciprocated the post-earthquake favor by publishing the News-Miner's <b>masthead</b> on its editions and posting occasional stories from Fairbanks until electrical power was restored to the town.|$|E
5|$|The {{magazine}} {{began as}} a 160-page digest, priced at 35 cents. The price stayed the same throughout the run, but the page count was cut to 128 for the eighth issue, September 1954. The magazine was bimonthly, but issues 9 and 10 did not carry month and year dates, which has led different bibliographers to catalogue them in different ways. However, the <b>masthead</b> for these issues indicates that the magazine remained bimonthly, {{and so they are}} now usually catalogued as November 1954 and January 1955, respectively; the copyright dates on the last two issues correspond to these dates. The volume numbering was completely regular; volume 1 had six numbers, and volume 2 ceased with its fourth number. The stories were printed in the two-column format usual to digest magazines.|$|E
5|$|The new editor was Ejler Jakobsson, though Pohl {{continued}} to be listed as editor emeritus on the <b>masthead</b> until the July–August 1970 issue. Much of the editorial work was actually done by Judy-Lynn Benjamin, who was hired by Pohl in 1969 as an editorial assistant. The new regime failed to impress readers, and circulation dropped from over 67,000 for the year ending October 1968 to under 45,000 the following year, a drop of over 30%. If went bimonthly in May 1970, as Abramson attempted to juggle the frequency of publication of several of his titles to maximize profits; the page count and price were also adjusted more than once over the next year, again increasing profitability. Abramson also began a British distribution of If, reprinted with a separate cover, priced in British currency. Circulation figures of the time show an increase of about 6,000 copies, but if this includes sales in the UK is not clear.|$|E

5|$|After escaping, Cornfoot {{made her}} way to the village of Leuchars, eight miles from Pittenweem, where she was either {{discovered}} by the minister, George Gordon, or had approached him for help. For the reward of £10, he arranged an armed guard of two men to return her to Cowper's house on 30 January 1705. Cowper was not at home when they arrived so she was taken to one of the bailies. A mob of at least ten people forcibly removed her from the house, tied her up, beat her, then hauled her down to the harbour by her ankles, possibly with the intention of dunking her. A rope was run from the top of the <b>masthead</b> on a ship back to the shore and she was dangled from it while the crowd threw stones at her as she swung backwards and forwards. When they took her down, she was covered by a door that had heavy stones placed on top of it until she was crushed to death. A cart pulled by a horse was guided over her corpse more than once to ensure she was dead. The crowd took her body to the home of her co-accused, Nicolas Lawson, with the intention of torturing her in the same manner but decided they had sufficient sport for the day.|$|E
5|$|Howard Browne {{took over}} as editor of both Amazing Stories and Fantastic Adventures in 1950. Browne {{preferred}} fantasy to science fiction, and enjoyed editing Fantastic Adventures, but when his plans for taking Amazing upmarket were derailed by the Korean War, he lost interest in both magazines for a while. He let William Hamling take responsibility for both titles, and the quality declined. At the end of 1950, Ziff-Davis moved its offices from Chicago to New York; Browne relocated to New York, but Hamling decided to stay in Chicago, so Browne became more involved once again, and sf historians such as Brian Stableford and Mike Ashley consider the result {{to have been a}} definite improvement in quality. Browne's interest in fantasy led him to start a new digest-sized magazine, Fantastic, in the summer of 1952; it was an immediate success, and led Ziff-Davis to convert Amazing Stories to digest format as well. The move from the pulp format to digests was well under way in the early 1950s, and with Fantastics success there was little reason to keep Fantastic Adventures going. It was merged with Fantastic; the last issue was dated March 1953, and the MayJune issue of Fantastic added a mention of Fantastic Adventures to the <b>masthead,</b> though this disappeared with the following issue.|$|E
5|$|The {{first issue}} of If was dated March 1952, with Fairman as editor; it {{featured}} stories by Richard Shaver, Raymond Palmer, and Howard Browne, all writers who were regulars of the Ziff-Davis magazines. By the time the third issue reached the news stands, the disappointing sales figures for the first issue were in, and Quinn decided to let Fairman go. Quinn persevered with himself as editor. His first issue was dated July 1952, and he continued as editor on the <b>masthead</b> for some years. Quinn brought in Ed Valigursky as the art editor; he designed striking covers, including some wraparound artwork—an unusual feature—which helped improve circulation. Quinn began searching for a replacement editor: writer Lester del Rey turned down the job (a decision he {{is reported to have}} later regretted), but Quinn was able to engage Larry T. Shaw, an active science-fiction fan who had sold a few stories. Shaw joined in May 1953 as associate editor and soon began writing editorials (beginning with the September 1953 issue) and assisting with story selection. The magazine's quality quickly improved and soon Quinn felt able to switch to a monthly schedule, instead of bimonthly. Shaw left after only a year, and Quinn resumed full editorial responsibilities.|$|E

50|$|The list below, and {{the charts}} above, follow the <b>mastheads</b> in the magazines. However, because of Gold's poor health, Pohl was acting as editor {{for some time}} before he officially took over the role {{at the end of}} 1961.|$|R
