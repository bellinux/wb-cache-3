5|$|The Northeast Extension of the Pennsylvania Turnpike {{uses the}} ticket system method of tolling between the Mid-County and Wyoming Valley toll plazas {{along with the}} {{mainline}} Pennsylvania Turnpike. With the ticket system, a <b>motorist</b> receives a ticket upon entering the turnpike at an interchange and pays the fare and surrenders the ticket upon exiting. If a <b>motorist</b> loses the ticket, the turnpike charges the highest fare to the exit where the <b>motorist</b> leaves. Mainline toll plazas are also located at Keyser Avenue and Clarks Summit, charging a flat rate. There are no tolls on exit ramps between Wyoming Valley and Clarks Summit. E-ZPass is accepted at all toll plazas. As of 2017, it costs a passenger vehicle $12.10 to travel {{the length of the}} Northeast Extension between Mid-County and Wyoming Valley using cash and $8.54 using E-ZPass. The Keyser Avenue and Clarks Summit toll plazas cost $1.45 using cash and $0.81 using E-ZPass for passenger vehicles.|$|E

5|$|The Negro <b>Motorist</b> Green Book (at times styled The Negro <b>Motorist</b> Green-Book or titled The Negro Travelers' Green Book) was {{an annual}} guidebook for African-American roadtrippers, {{commonly}} referred to simply as the Green Book. It was originated and published by New York City mailman Victor Hugo Green from 1936 to 1966, during the era of Jim Crow laws, when open and often legally prescribed discrimination against non-whites was widespread. Although pervasive racial discrimination and poverty limited black car ownership, the emerging African-American middle class bought automobiles {{as soon as they}} could, but faced a variety of dangers and inconveniences along the road, from refusal of food and lodging to arbitrary arrest. In response, Green wrote his guide to services and places relatively friendly to African-Americans, eventually expanding its coverage from the New York area to much of North America, as well as founding a travel agency.|$|E
5|$|The tickets {{along the}} Northeast Extension of the Pennsylvania Turnpike were {{originally}} handed out by person. In 1987, machines started to replace humans in distributing tickets. In 1990, an {{electronic toll collection}} system was proposed for the Pennsylvania Turnpike, where a <b>motorist</b> would create an account and use an electronic device that would be read from an electronic tollbooth. The <b>motorist</b> would be billed later. The multi-state electronic tolling system, which was to be called E-ZPass, was planned to be implemented by 1998. The planned installation date was later pushed back to 2000. On December2, 2000, E-ZPass debuted along the Northeast Extension of the Pennsylvania Turnpike between Mid-County and Lehigh Valley. On December15, 2001, E-ZPass was extended to include {{the entire length of the}} Northeast Extension of the Pennsylvania Turnpike. Commercial vehicles were allowed to start using E-ZPass on December14, 2002.|$|E

5|$|Ottawa County is {{the final}} Oklahoma county that both US-60 and US-69 will pass through. The two routes first pass through the town of Afton. The first highway {{junction}} in the county is with US-59, which concurs {{with the other two}} highways. Less than a mile north of the US-59 junction, the three highways pass through a cloverleaf interchange; proceeding north through this interchange places a <b>motorist</b> on US-59/US-69 bound for Miami, heading west leads to the toll booth for I-44, and turning east puts the <b>motorist</b> on US-60 eastbound. US-60, now with no other highways concurrent with it, will parallel the BNSF rail line for the remainder of its time in Oklahoma. The next town the route passes through is Fairland; here, it has a brief concurrency with SH-125. US-60 crosses the Neosho River (also known as the Grand River) into Twin Bridges State Park. Within the park, the highway serves as the southern terminus of SH-137. US-60 crosses the Spring River to exit the park. Northeast of Wyandotte, US-60 has a brief concurrency with SH-10. As it approaches the state line, US-60 Business splits from US-60, serving Seneca, Missouri. US-60 then leaves Oklahoma, continuing into Newton County, Missouri.|$|E

40|$|There is a {{well-documented}} {{relationship between}} motorists speed and the number, respectively severity, of accidents in urban streets. Also, {{studies have shown}} that vehicle emissions can increase on streets where speed reducing measures are installed, if the driving pattern of the <b>motorists</b> becomes more jerky. Hence, to decrease vehicle emissions and improve traffic safety in built up areas, it is important to motivate or even enforce <b>motorists</b> to drive with a low and even speed. Since most <b>motorists</b> do not always follow the speed limits, different kinds of forcing measures, such as road humps, chicanes and chokers, are used to force <b>motorists</b> to drive slower. The most common of these measures is the road hump. To this date, not many studies, concerning how road humps affect the driving pattern of <b>motorists,</b> have been done. To be able to study the driving pattern of <b>motorists,</b> a method to measure speed continuously over segments of streets has been developed. With this method, speed profiles showing how mean and 85 th percentile speed vary along streets, before and after the streets were re-designed, have been produced. The analyses of these speed profiles reveal that previous studies in this area of interest, have underestimated how much <b>motorists</b> increase their speed between road humps. The analyses also show that <b>motorists</b> always increase their speed between road humps, even if the distance between the humps is only 20 metres. This leads to the conclusion that it is impossible, only using road humps, to make <b>motorists</b> drive with both low and even speed...|$|R

5|$|The {{government}} may not detain an individual even momentarily without reasonable and articulable suspicion, {{with a few}} exceptions. In Delaware v.

5|$|Barry dropped {{moderate}} to heavy rainfall across Florida, peaking at 6.99inches (178mm) at Palm Beach International Airport; several other locations reported over 3inches (75mm). The rainfall alleviated persistent drought conditions and assisted in combating severe wildfires across the state. In Brevard County, the rainfall closed {{a portion of}} Eau Gallie Boulevard after a large sinkhole developed. Several other roads across the area were flooded, and on Interstate 95 near Lake Worth, a sinkhole closed two lanes of traffic. Wet roads caused several traffic accidents across the state; in both Brevard and Volusia counties, a <b>motorist</b> was killed from an accident. On Interstate 4, a tractor trailer led to disruptions near Orlando after it crashed into a guardrail.|$|E

40|$|Law {{enforcement}} officers {{are allowed to}} exercise {{a significant amount of}} street-level discretion in a variety of ways. In this paper, we focus on a particular prominent kind of discretionary behavior by traffic officers when issuing speeding tickets, speed discounting. Officers partially forgive <b>motorists</b> by writing a lower speed level than the speed that officers observe. Verifying the level of speed discounting by different groups of officers and <b>motorists</b> and ascertaining the presence of racial disparities in this lenient policing are the main objectives of this paper. We find that minority officers, particularly African-Americans, are harsher on all <b>motorists</b> but even harsher on minority <b>motorists</b> regarding speed discounting. The minority-on-minority disparity appears to be stronger in situations involving Hispanic officers, infrequently ticketing officers, male <b>motorists,</b> those driving old vehicles, and minority neighborhoods. police discretion, disparate treatment, racial bias, speeding tickets...|$|R
