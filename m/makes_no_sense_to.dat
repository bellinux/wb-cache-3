500|$|The Nyaya school {{criticized the}} Jain {{doctrine}} of anekantavada, states Karl Potter, as [...] "wanting {{to say one}} thing at one time, the other at another", thereby ignoring the principle of non-contradiction. The Naiyayikas states that it <b>makes</b> <b>no</b> <b>sense</b> <b>to</b> simultaneously say, [...] "jiva and ajiva are not related" [...] and [...] "jiva and ajiva are related". Jains state that jiva attaches itself to karmic particles (ajiva) which means there is a relation between ajiva and jiva. The Jain theory of ascetic salvation teaches cleansing of karmic particles and destroying the bound ajiva to the jiva, yet, Jain scholars also deny that ajiva and jiva are related or at least interdependent, according to the Nyaya scholars. The Jain theory of anekantavada makes its theory of karma, asceticism and salvation incoherent, according to Nyaya Hindu texts.|$|E

2500|$|Although Wittgenstein {{certainly}} {{argues that}} the notion of private language is incoherent, because {{of the way in which}} the text is presented the exact nature of the argument is disputed. First, he argues that a private language is not really a language at all. [...] This point is intimately connected with a variety of other themes in his later works, especially his investigations of [...] "meaning". For Wittgenstein, there is no single, coherent [...] "sample" [...] or [...] "object" [...] that we can call [...] "meaning". Rather, the supposition that there are such things is the source of many philosophical confusions. Meaning is a complicated phenomenon that is woven into the fabric of our lives. A good first approximation of Wittgenstein's point is that meaning is a social event; meaning happens between language users. As a consequence, it <b>makes</b> <b>no</b> <b>sense</b> <b>to</b> talk about a private language, with words that mean something in the absence of other users of the language.|$|E

He suggested that the scientists either never read 2001: A Space Odyssey, or read it too much. Empire Online listed her as the 12th-best video game character of all time, describing her acts as [...] "HAL-like conduct". Writer Stephen Totilo alluded the final battle with GLaDOS to the scene of David from 2001 disabling HAL, with both scenes involving de-evolving the respective characters.|$|E

The show was hosted in a daytime chat show format {{in front of a}} live studio audience, although it featured a small proportion of pre-recorded location inserts. It was structured by the often strange obsessions of Richard Herring; examples include his rating of the milk of all creatures and attempting to popularise the acronym of the show (TMWRNJ) (in the style of Tiswas). The show featured (and acknowledged its use of) repetition, with regular and vigilant viewers being rewarded by jokes that would <b>make</b> <b>no</b> <b>sense</b> <b>to</b> casual viewers. The show seemed to oscillate between the intellectual and puerile. However, irony was often used, even though the citing of irony as an excuse was mocked by the show's stars in one of many self-referential jokes.|$|R
30|$|In this investigation, {{only one}} {{emission}} scenario (A 1 B) was considered. To establish {{a more comprehensive}} range of projections of the impacts of climate change, the study could have included other scenarios, particularly those that are more moderate compared to A 1 B as for instance B 1 and B 2. The results {{presented in this paper}} rely on a study which was conducted in the framework of the research program INKLIM-A founded by the federal state Hesse which brought together experts of several environmental sciences, including experts for climate modelling. Based on comprehensive knowledge represented in the research consortium, it was a unanimous decision that it would <b>make</b> <b>no</b> <b>sense</b> <b>to</b> consider the B 1 scenario since the assumptions made for this scenario are meanwhile outdated. However, a wide range of temperature variation was considered by applying the four climate models reflecting, both, more conservative and more extreme temperature developments.|$|R
2500|$|This {{rejection}} {{was actively}} advanced by some logicians, most notably W. V. Quine. [...] Quine advanced {{the view that}} in predicate-language sentences like Fx the [...] "x" [...] is {{to be thought of}} as a variable or name denoting an object and hence can be quantified over, as in [...] "For all things, it is the case that [...] [...] [...]" [...] but the [...] "F" [...] is {{to be thought of as}} an abbreviation for an incomplete sentence, not the name of an object (not even of an abstract object like a property). [...] For example, it might mean [...] " [...] [...] [...] is a dog." [...] But it <b>makes</b> <b>no</b> <b>sense</b> <b>to</b> think we can quantify over something like this.

2500|$|With the {{explosion}} of use and interest in SSRIs in the late 1980s and early 1990s, focused especially on Prozac, interest grew as well in discontinuation syndromes. In the late 1990s, some investigators thought that symptoms that emerged when antidepressants were discontinued, might mean that antidepressants were causing addiction, and some used the term [...] "withdrawal syndrome" [...] to describe the symptoms. Addictive substances cause physiological dependence, so that drug withdrawal causes suffering. These theories were abandoned, since addiction leads to drug-seeking behavior, and people taking antidepressants do not exhibit drug-seeking behavior. The term [...] "withdrawal syndrome" [...] is no longer used with respect to antidepressants, to avoid confusion with problems that arise from addiction. There are case reports of antidepressants being abused, but these are rare and are mostly limited to antidepressants with stimulant effects and to people who already had a substance use disorder. A 2012 comparison {{of the effects of}} stopping therapy with benzodiazepines and SSRIs argued that because the symptoms are similar, it <b>makes</b> <b>no</b> <b>sense</b> <b>to</b> say that benzodiazepines are addictive while SSRIs are not. Responses to that review noted that {{there is no evidence that}} people who stop taking SSRIs exhibit drug-seeking behavior while people who stop taking benzodiazepines do, and that the drug classes should be considered differently.|$|E

Recent {{results suggest that}} error control schemes using forward error correction (FEC) are good candidates for decreasing the impact of packet loss on audio quality. With FEC schemes, redundant information is transmitted along with the original information so that the lost original data can be recovered {{at least in part}} from the redundant information. Clearly, sending additional redundancy increases the probability of recovering lost packets, but it also increases the bandwidth requirements and thus the loss rate of the audio stream. This means that the FEC scheme must be coupled to a rate control scheme.

40|$|While the {{importance}} of patient autonomy is widely acknowledged and discussed in the bioethics literature, clinicians' autonomy, their ability {{to make the best}} choices about patients' care free from outside interference, is far less debated. This paper takes one form of external influence over clinical decisions - the cost of drugs - and applies it to a specific case, that of HER 2 positive breast cancer {{and the use of the}} drug Herceptin in the UK. Drawing on interviews with clinicians, researchers and policymakers, I explore the way financial decisions about Herceptin shape clinicians' autonomy, and how clinicians as individuals and as professional groups respond to these limits and seek to provide treatment to the highest number of the most deserving patients they can. The point of this paper is not to castigate bioethicists for misguidedly focusing on patient autonomy but point out that clinicians' autonomy may be so circumscribed by external factors that it may <b>make</b> <b>no</b> <b>sense</b> <b>to</b> speak of their actions as stemming from ethical decisions. At the same time, I suggest that financial constraints create areas at the margin of clinical practice which are deserving of bioethical consideration...|$|R
