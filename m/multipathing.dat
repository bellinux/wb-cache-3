In order {{to take account of}} these effects, a new method to analyse surface waves is developed. The method, which we call the membrane surface wave method, is an approximation to the Green's function method in a 3 -D medium and is valid for a laterally, smoothly varying media. We also present the formulae to invert the seismograms. As an example, we apply the method to a preliminary California model. Use of the method for the forward calculation shows that heterogeneity in the model is so severe that the wavefront due to the Whittier Narrows earthquake is split in two by the time it feaches the San Francisco Bay area. The kernels in the inverse formula to the six Berkeley stations show curved paths, <b>multipathings</b> and finite wavelength effects and visually demonstrate how waves sample the medium.

Two {{modes of operation}} are described, {{depending on whether the}} source Bridge is 802.1ad (QinQ) which is known as SPBV or 802.1ah (MACinMAC), which is known as SPBM. SPBV supports a VLAN using a VLAN Identifier (VID) per node to identify the shortest path tree (SPT) associated with that node. SPBM supports a VLAN by using one or more Backbone MAC addresses to identify each node and its associated SPT, and it can support multiple forwarding topologies for load sharing across equal cost trees using a single B-VID per forwarding topology. Both SPBV and SPBM use link state routing technology. SPBM by virtue of its MACinMAC encapsulation is more suitable for a large data centre than SPBV. 802.1aq defines 16 tunable multipath options as part of the base protocol, with an extensible <b>multipathing</b> mechanism to allow many more multipath variations in the future. 802.1aq supports the dynamic creation of virtual LAN's that interconnect all members with symmetric shortest path routes. The virtual LAN's can be deterministically assigned to the different multi paths providing a degree of traffic engineering in addition to <b>multipathing</b> and can grow or shrink with simple membership changes. 802.1aq is fully backward compatible with all 802.1 protocols. 802.1aq became an IEEE standard in April 2012.|$|E

50|$|In {{order to}} {{serialize}} accesses between data records on a loosely coupled system, a practice known as record locking must be used.

However, when the lock is obtained offboard of the TPF processor in the DASD control unit, an external process must be used. Historically, the record locking was accomplished in the DASD control unit via an RPQ known as LLF (Limited Locking Facility) and later ELLF (extended). LLF and ELLF were both replaced by the <b>Multipathing</b> Lock Facility (MPLF).

The magnitude and scale of velocity contrasts representative of features such as subducted slabs may be such that wave diffraction becomes an important process. In this case forward modeling methods based on high-frequency asymptotic approximations to the wave equation will not accurately describe the wavefield. A method is introduced to model the propagation of teleseismic P waves in a laterally heterogeneous upper mantle that accounts for distortion of the initial portion of the wavefield including the effects of <b>multipathing</b> and frequency-dependent diffraction. The method is based on a parabolic approxi-mation to the wave equation that is solved in the time domain on a finite-dif-ference grid which mimics the expected pattern of energy flow in a reference velocity field.

However, rugose salt bodies complicate wavefield propagation and lead to subsalt <b>multipathing,</b> illumination gaps and shadow zones which cannot be handled correctly by conventional traveltime-based migration velocity analysis. We overcome these limitations by the wave-equation migration velocity analysis technique introduced in a companion paper (Sava and Biondi, 2004) and demonstrate the methodology on a realistic synthetic dataset simulating a salt dome environment and a Gulf of Mexico dataset. We model subsalt propagation using wavepaths created by one-way wavefield extrapolation. Those wavepaths are much more accurate and robust than broadband rays, since they inherit the frequency dependence and <b>multipathing</b> of the underlying wavefield. We formulate an objective function for optimization in the image space by relating an image perturbation to a perturbation of the velocity model. The image perturbations are defined using linearized prestack residual migration, thus ensuring stability relative to the first-order Born approximation assumptions. Synthetic and real data examples demonstrate that wave-equation MVA is an effective tool for subsalt velocity analysis, even when shadows and illumination gaps are present. ...|$|E

However, structures in the deep mantle that are chemically dense with low Rayleigh numbers can develop enormous relief, perhaps with boundaries closer to vertical than to radial. Such features are hard to detect with present tomographic modeling techniques because the timing anomalies are based on long-period filtered waveforms with complexity removed. Here we develop a new tool for processing array data {{on the basis of}} a decomposition referred to as a multipath detector, which can be used to distinguish between horizontal structure (in-plane <b>multipathing)</b> and vertical (out-of-plane <b>multipathing)</b> directly from processing array waveforms. A lateral gradient coefficient based on this detector provides a direct constraint on the sharpness of the boundaries and material properties. We demonstrate the usefulness of this approach by processing samples of both P and S data from the Kaapvaal array in southern Africa, which are compared with synthetic predictions from a metastable dynamic model containing sharp edges. Both data and simulations produce timing gradients larger than 2 s/deg in azimuthal changes for S waves, where only minor effects are obtained for P waves.

In particular, wireless environments and datacenters are envisioned to become largely dependent {{on the power of}} <b>multipathing</b> for seamless handovers, virtual machine (VM) migration and in general, pooling less proficient resources together for achieving overall high proficiency. The transport layer, with its knowledge about end-to-end path characteristics, is well placed to enhance performance through better utilization of multiple paths. Realizing the importance of transport-layer multipath, this paper investigates the modernization of traditional connection establishment, flow control, sequence number splitting, acknowledgement, and flow scheduling mechanisms for use with multiple paths. Since congestion control defines a fundamental feature of the transport layer, we study the working of multipath rate control and analyze its stability and convergence. We also discuss how various multipath congestion control algorithms differ in their window increase and decrease functions, their TCP-friendliness, and responsiveness. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first in-depth survey paper that has chronicled the evolution of the transport layer of the Internet from the traditional single-path TCP to the recent development of the modern multipath TCP (MPTCP) protocol. Along with describing the history of this evolution, we also highlight in this paper the remaining challenges and research issues...|$|E
40|$|Seismic {{surface waves}} are usually {{composed}} of overlapping wave trains representing multipath propagation. A first {{task in the}} analysis of such waves is to identify and separate the various component wave trains so that each can be analyzed separately. Phase-matched filters are a class of linear filters in which the Fourier phase of the filter is made equal to that of a given signal. Herrin and Goforth (1977) described an iterative technique which can be used to find a phase-matched filter for a particular component of a seismic signal. Application of the filters to digital records of Rayleigh waves allowed multiple arrivals to be identified and removed, and allowed recovery of the complex spectrum of the primary wave train along with its apparent group-velocity dispersion curve. A comparable analysis of Love waves presents additional complications. Love waves are contaminated by both Love and Rayleigh <b>multipathing</b> and by primary off-axis Rayleigh energy. In the case of explosions, there is much less energy generated as Love waves than as Rayleigh waves. The applicability of phase-matched filtering to Love waves is demonstrated by its use on earthquakes occurring in the Norwegian Sea and near Iceland and on a nuclear explosion in Novaya Zemlya.

The possibilities to use dGPS (differential global positioning system) for forest mapping are analyzed. The efficiency of dGPS in forest condition is linked to canopy interference, which intercepts signals sent by some of the satellites or reflect them (<b>multipathing).</b> Two types of equipment have been tested: a Trimble Svee Six coupled with a RDS differential receiver and a Trimble SK 8 coupled with an OMNISTAR differential receiver. Recordings have been achieved according to two modes: static (recording on one spot during one minute) and cinematic (moving continuously along the stand limits). Two types of forest canopy were compared: light canopy made of young poplar plantation with few obstacles in the vicinity, and closed canopy of mature spruce stand edged with other mature stand. Cinematic mode efficiency is higher than static one (mean errors are respectively 3. 1 m and 9. 1 m). In the same way positioning is more accurate for the stand with light canopy than for the other one (mean errors are respectively 2. 9 m and 9. 4 m). Difference between recording modes are probably due to <b>multipathing</b> effect that filtering algorithm integrated in the GPS receivers are not able to remove in static mode.

40|$|Tomographic imaging of {{the crust}} and upper mantle beneath the western United States has greatly {{improved}} {{with the addition}} of USArray data. These models display many detailed images of both fast and slow blobs penetrating into the transition zone. To study such features, we apply a newly developed technique, called MultiPath Detector analysis, to the SH waveform data. The method simulates each observed body waveform by performing a decomposition; by [S(t) +C×S(t–Δ_ 9 LR)) ]/ 2, where S(t) is the synthetics for a reference model. Time separation Δ_ 9 LR) and amplitude ratio C are needed to obtain a high cross-correlation between a simulated waveform and data. The travel time of the composite waveform relative to the reference model synthetics is defined as Δ_T. A simulated annealing algorithm is used to determine the parameters Δ_(LR) and C. We also record the amplitude ratio (Amp) between the synthetics for the reference model relative to the data. Generally, large Δ_(LR) values are associated with low Amp's. Whereas the conventional tomography yields a travel time correction (Δ_T), our analysis yields an extra parameter (Δ_(LR)), which describes the waveform complexity. With the array, we can construct a mapping of the gradient of Δ_(LR) with complexity patterns. A horizontal structure introduces waveform complexity along the distance profile (in-plane <b>multipathing).</b> An azimuthally orientation Δ_(LR) pattern indicates a vertical structure with out-of-plane <b>multipathing.</b> Using such maps generated from artificial data, we can easily recognize features produced by dipping fast structures and slow structures (DSS). Many of these features display organized waveform complexity that are distinctly directional indicative of dipping sharp-edges. Here, we process the array data for events arriving from various azimuths and construct maps of <b>multipathing</b> patterns. The similarity between tomographic features and complexity maps is striking. When features are dipping such as the slab structures beneath the Cascade Range and Nevada, strong complexity is observed from Southeastern events arriving along these ray paths with split pulses separated up to 6 s for both. This requires extended slab segments to at least 600 / 300 km with a 4 / 8 per cent velocity jump along the edges. One of the most dramatic set of DSS observations is associated with a slow northwest dipping conduit beneath Yellowstone that extends into the transition zone.
