50|$|The numbers {{stamped on}} the head of the bolt are {{referred}} to the grade of the bolt used in certain application with the strength of a bolt. High-strength steel bolts usually have a hexagonal head with an ISO strength rating (called property class) stamped {{on the head}}. And the absence of marking/number indicates a lower grade bolt with low strength. The property classes most often used are 5.8, 8.8, and 10.9. The number before the point is the ultimate tensile strength in MPa divided by 100. The number after the point is the <b>multiplier</b> <b>ratio</b> of yield strength to ultimate tensile strength. For example, a property class 5.8 bolt has a nominal (minimum) ultimate tensile strength of 500 MPa, and a tensile yield strength of 0.8 times ultimate tensile strength or 0.8(500) = 400 MPa.|$|E
40|$|Effective air {{launching}} of a rocket is approached {{from a broad}} systems engineering viewpoint. The elementary reasons for why and how a rocket might be launched from a carrier aircraft are examined. From this, a carefully crafted set of guiding principles is presented. Rules are generated from a fundamental foundation, derived from NASA systems study analyses and from an academic vantage point. The Appendix includes the derivation of a revised Mass Multiplier Equation, useful in understanding the rocket equation {{as it applies to}} real vehicles, without the need of complicated weight and sizing programs. The rationale for air launching, being an enormously advantageous Earth-To-Orbit (ETO) methodology, is presented along with the realization that the appropriate air launch solution may lie in a very large class of carrier aircraft; the ‘pod-hauler’. Finally, a unique area of the system trade space is defined and branded ‘Crossbow’. Crossbow is not a specific hardware design for air launch, but represents a comprehensive vision for commercial, military and space transportation. This document serves {{as a starting point for}} future technical papers that evaluate the air launch hypotheses and assertions produced during the past several years of study on the subject.

40|$|Cetacean {{watching}} {{activity as}} a touristic activity is steady increasing; its economic benefit {{has been estimated}} over US 2. 1 billion per year globally, with over 13 million people undertaking the activity in 119 countries (IFAW, 2008). However, {{there have been few}} studies examining the real contribution that this sub sector can make to the economic well-being of local communities. This project examines the paths of expenditure in a local economy with a marine wildlife tourism attraction. New Quay is a Welsh village located in Cardigan Bay Special Area of Conservation, in the county of Ceredigion, West Wales, which shelters one of only two semi-resident populations of bottlenose dolphins in the UK. Due to the presence of this charismatic species, in recent years the dolphin-watching tourism industry has shown a significant increase, transforming this traditional family holiday destination. Using the methodology ?Local Multiplier 3 ? (LM 3) developed by New Economics Foundation (NEF), the project aims to work out a <b>multiplier</b> <b>ratio</b> which will explain how much this touristic activity contributes to economic development of the host community and its potential as economic motor for the region. This multiplier effect is calculated in three levels: the first one involves dolphin-watching tourists, asking them how and where they spent their holiday budget. Having identified the starting amounts and located the entry points into the local economy of New Quay, the second phase is addressed to the local businesses highlighted by tourists. The final stage is focused in the local spending habits of staff members of these businesses. From this grassroots approach to understanding the contribution of this tourism activity based on marine biodiversity, we can identify the mutual dependence between conservation goals and community livelihoods surrounding protected areas. Further, the project expects to contribute to promotion of a cross sectorial low carbon economy and also towards best practice in spatial planning, to ensure the most sustainable local economic outcomes.

For all-respiratory diseases and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) from April 2001 to 2010 we calculated age, country of birth and Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation (SIMD) adjusted risk ratios (RRs), by sex. We calculated hazard ratios (HRs) for death following hospitalization and for readmission. We <b>multiplied</b> <b>ratios</b> and confidence intervals (CIs) by 100, so the reference Scottish White population's RR/HR = 100.   RESULTS: RRs were comparatively low for all-respiratory diseases in Other White British and Chinese men and high in Pakistani men and women. For COPD, White Irish men and women and any Mixed Background men and women had high RRs, while Indian men and Chinese women had low RRs. In most non-White groups, mortality following hospitalization and readmission was similar or lower than the reference.   CONCLUSIONS: The pattern of ethnic variations in these respiratory disorders was complex and did not merely reflect smoking patterns.
