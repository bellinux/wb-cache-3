5|$|The fifth {{tropical}} cyclone {{of the season}} was first identified as a tropical storm several hundred <b>miles</b> <b>southeast</b> of Hawaii on September9. The storm quickly attained winds of 50mph (85km/h) before weakening. By September11, the system weakened to a tropical depression. Later that day, the system entered an area with no ships available for reporting. However, no ships reported a storm in the region for several days, signifying the depression's dissipation.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after its}} peak, Hurricane Hilary's motion became unsteady. After nearly stalling, the {{hurricane}} {{turned to the}} west on August22, only to become nearly stationary again the next day. Slowly executing a small counter-clockwise loop, Hilary underwent a Fujiwhara interaction with Tropical Storm Irwin which was several hundred <b>miles</b> <b>southeast.</b> Meanwhile, Hilary began to weaken, by early on August22, the eye became poorly defined and convection diminished. The eye dissipated within 12 hours, and the winds quickly diminished to 85mph (130km/h). Later that day, the thunderstorm activity became partially exposed from the center, and on August23, Hilary was downgraded to a tropical storm {{due to lack of}} organization.|$|E
5|$|The nomadic Karankawa Indians {{used the}} bay for hunting {{before the arrival}} of Europeans, but no major human {{settlements}} were ever established. The unincorporated community of Lamar on Live Oak Peninsula is the only substantial community that borders the bay. The cities of Rockport and Fulton on the main Aransas Bay are located only a few miles away, and the bay is usually considered a part of the collective Rockport-Fulton area. The bay is roughly 150 <b>miles</b> <b>southeast</b> of San Antonio and about 40 miles northeast of Corpus Christi.|$|E

5|$|A {{cold front}} stalled {{a couple hundred}} <b>miles</b> <b>{{southeast}}</b> of Bermuda on October 10. During that day, a strong upper-level trough moved southeastward off the southeast coast of the United States. Due to several factors, including upward motion and strong diffluence—the rate at which a fluid moves—the area became baroclinically unstable. This caused {{the interaction between the}} trough and the front to develop into an extratropical low about 345miles (555km) southeast of Bermuda on October 11. The low moved quickly northward, then northwestward, strengthening quickly due to the instability of the atmosphere. Late on October 11, the system slowed, and the upper-level circulation became aligned with the low-level circulation. The extratropical storm began to develop tropical characteristics late on October 11, including surface temperatures warmer than the surrounding environment, and vertical wind characteristics of a tropical cyclone. Based on its organization, the system developed into Subtropical Storm One early on October 12 while located about 35miles (55km) south of Bermuda.|$|E
5|$|Initial extrapolations placed Cooper's {{landing zone}} within an {{area on the}} southernmost {{outreach}} of Mount St. Helens, a few <b>miles</b> <b>southeast</b> of Ariel, Washington, near Lake Merwin, an artificial lake formed by a dam on the Lewis River. Search efforts focused on Clark and Cowlitz Counties, encompassing the terrain immediately south and north, respectively, of the Lewis River in southwest Washington. FBI agents and Sheriff's deputies from those counties searched {{large areas of the}} mountainous wilderness on foot and by helicopter. Door-to-door searches of local farmhouses were also carried out. Other search parties ran patrol boats along Lake Merwin and Yale Lake, the reservoir immediately to its east. No trace of Cooper, nor any of the equipment presumed to have left the aircraft with him, was found.|$|E
5|$|On August20, 2015, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) began {{monitoring}} {{a tropical}} wave over western Africa, near the Atlantic shore. The disorganized system emerged over the Atlantic Ocean several hundred <b>miles</b> <b>southeast</b> of the Cape Verde Islands the following day. Moving quickly west, the system bypassed the Cape Verde Islands {{to the south}} on August22, but remained largely disorganized. A sharp trough developed within expanding deep convection on August23, though a well-defined circulation did not consolidate. Organization of the low improved throughout the day as environmental conditions favored tropical cyclogenesis. The trough acquired gale-force winds the following day and finally developed a closed circulation by 18:00UTC. The formation of a closed low marked the transition into a tropical cyclone; accordingly, the system was classified as Tropical Storm Erika, the fifth named storm of the annual hurricane season. Upon its designation, Erika was situated roughly 1,035mi (1,665km) east of the Lesser Antilles. The storm maintained a brisk westward trajectory, steered by a subtropical ridge to the north.|$|E

5|$|On October6, 1974, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) began {{monitoring}} {{a tropical}} disturbance several hundred <b>miles</b> <b>southeast</b> of Guam. Tracking quickly westward to west-northwestward {{in response to}} a strong subtropical ridge to the north, the system gradually organized, passing near Ulithi atoll on October7. Accompanied by a broad monsoonal flow, the disturbance featured multiple centers of circulation. On October8, it developed into a tropical depression and soon into a tropical storm, at which time it was assigned the name Bess. Early on October9, an aircraft reconnaissance mission into Bess revealed that a new dominant center of circulation had developed {{to the north of the}} original low. The southern low soon dissipated as the northern one became a tropical storm. The northern system retained the name Bess and is considered the same storm by the JTWC.|$|E
5|$|The Tennessee Walking Horse National Celebration {{was founded}} in 1939. A Wartrace resident, Henry Davis, went to Winchester, Tennessee to buy hay and while there {{observed}} the Crimson Clover Festival being held. He felt that Wartrace should have a similar festival, and proposed the idea {{to a group of}} fellow horsemen, who accepted it. The first Celebration was held in 1939. It began with a parade and elaborate pageant that depicted the evolution of the Tennessee Walking Horse breed from its original use as a plow and utility horse, to its present use as a show horse. The first Celebration attracted over 40,000 people. The Celebration later moved to Shelbyville, which is located about 60 <b>miles</b> <b>southeast</b> of Nashville, due to space issues, as small Wartrace was unable to cope with the volume of visitors and horses the show attracted. Shelbyville is now known as the Walking Horse Capital of the World.|$|E
5|$|Word of {{the attack}} at Spafford's farm spread quickly to Fort Defiance, about five <b>miles</b> <b>southeast</b> of Mineral Point. A small {{volunteer}} force of 13 men was assembled at Fort Defiance and they set off to hunt down the band of Native Americans responsible for the massacre. The group reached Fort Hamilton at around midnight on June 15. On the morning of June 15, survivor Bennett Million guided the militia volunteers back {{to the site of}} the massacre. One of the volunteers was Alexander Higgenbotham, a survivor of the St. Vrain massacre. The bodies of the dead were badly mutilated and Spafford's corpse was headless. His head was found scalped and tossed into the grass along the river bank. The volunteers buried the mangled bodies of the fallen and searched in vain for Spencer, whom they also assumed dead.|$|E

5|$|On August 11, General Anthony Zinni of Central Command was {{instructed}} to plan attacks on bin Laden's Khost camps, where CIA intelligence indicated bin Laden and other militants would be meeting on August 20, purportedly to plan further attacks against the U.S. Clinton was informed of the plan on August 12 and 14. Participants in the meeting later disagreed {{whether or not the}} intelligence indicated bin Laden would attend the meeting; however, an objective of the attack remained to kill the al-Qaeda leader, and the NSC encouraged the strike regardless of whether bin Laden and his companions were known to be present at Khost. The administration aimed to prevent future al-Qaeda attacks discussed in intercepted communications. As Berger later testified, the operation also sought to damage bin Laden's infrastructure and show the administration's commitment to combating bin Laden. The Khost complex, which was 90 <b>miles</b> <b>southeast</b> of Kabul, also had ideological significance: Bin Laden had fought nearby during the Soviet–Afghan War, and he had given interviews and even held a press conference at the site.|$|E
5|$|The storm's effects {{north of}} Florida were minor. Rainfall {{reached up to}} nine inches (228mm) in extreme eastern South Carolina and four inches (101mm) in eastern North Carolina. Winds reached 50mph (60km/h) with gusts up to 66mph (101km/h) at the Oak Island Coast Guard Station near Cape Fear, North Carolina and 54mph (87km/h) with gusts of 77mph (123km/h) at the {{offshore}} tower at Frying Pan Shoals about forty <b>miles</b> <b>southeast</b> of Cape Fear on June 18 with 70mph winds (110km/h) the next day. A 68foot fishing trawler sunk {{off the coast of}} Cape Fear in North Carolina from the high waves; no one was killed as the sailors were rescued by the United States Coast Guard on June 19. Flooding was reported with tides of two to three feet in the Carolinas. Rainfall from the subtropical storm reached both states, reaching maximum peaks of up to five inches (127mm) on the Georgia coast and seven inches on the Georgia/South Carolina border. Rainfall totaled to about one inch (25mm) on the Virginian coast. A ship encountered winds of a minimum tropical storm with gusts as high as a maximum tropical storm. The ship also encountered a tidal surge of 15 to 20feet.|$|E
