40|$|A medium was {{developed}} to obtain maximum yields of extracellular amylase from Bacteroides amylophilus 70. Crude enzyme preparation, obtained by ammonium sulfate precipitation of cell-free broth, contained six amylolytic isoenzymes that were detected by isoelectric focusing and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. One of these amylases was purified by diethylaminoethyl-Sephadex A- 50 ion-exchange chromatography and Sephadex G- 200 gel filtration techniques. Some properties of the purified extracellular alpha-amylase were: optimum pH, 6. 3; optimum temperature, 43 degrees C: PH stability range, 5. 8 to 7. 5; isoelectric point, pH 4. 6; molecular weight, 92, 000 (by sodium dodecyl sulfatedisc gel electrophoresis); and sugars causing inhibition, cyclomaltoheptaose, cyclomaltohexaose, and alpha-d-phenylglucoside. In addition, Ca 2 + and Co 2 + were strong activators,and Hg 2 + was a strong inhibitior; all other cations were slightly stimulatory. Dialysis against 0. 01 M ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid caused a 58 % loss of activity that was restored to 92 % of the original {{by the addition of}} 0. 04 M Ca 2 +. The enzyme affected a blue-value-reducing-value curve characteristic of alpha-type amylases. The relative rates of hydrolysis of amylose, soluble starch, amylopectin, and dextrin were 100, 97, 92, and 60 %, respectively; Michaelis constants for these substrates were 18. 2, 18. 7, 18. 2, and 16. 7 mumol of d-glucosidic bond/liter, respectively.

40|$|Purpose: To {{optimize}} the process conditions and analyze in vitro digestibility of <b>corn</b> <b>starch</b> phosphodiester prepared by sodium trimetaphosphate (STMP). Methods: By using response surface method, {{the effects of}} STMP concentration, pH, esterification temperature, and urea addition on digestion resistance of <b>corn</b> <b>starch</b> phosphodiester were investigated and optimal conditions were determined. <b>Corn</b> <b>starch</b> phosphodiester was identified by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and an in vitro digestibility method was applied to investigate starch digestion performances of <b>corn</b> <b>starch</b> phosphodiester. Results: The optimum conditions for the preparation of <b>corn</b> <b>starch</b> phosphodiester were as follows: STMP, 3. 3 %; pH 9. 07; esterification temperature, 42 °C; and urea, 2. 3 %.

40|$|AbstractIn this study, three {{different}} modification methods (pregelatinization, acid-thinning and dextrinization) {{were used to}} produce the modified <b>corn</b> <b>starches.</b> Physicochemical and rheological properties of the native and modified <b>corn</b> <b>starch</b> were studied. In addition, the resultant modified <b>corn</b> <b>starches</b> were used at levels 5 %, 10 % and 15 % to replace wheat flour in noodle processing. The crude protein and lipid contents of modified <b>corn</b> <b>starches</b> significantly decreased compared to native ones. Water and oil binding capacity of <b>corn</b> <b>starch</b> increased up to 1. 49 and 2. 35 g/g, respectively, after modifying by the pregelatinization method. Results also showed that the maximum solubility was given by dextrinized <b>corn</b> <b>starch</b> after heat treatment at 90 °C being 44. 85 %, which means about 5. 9 -fold increase in solubility as compared to native starch. However, acid-thinning modified <b>corn</b> <b>starch</b> showed a significant decreased effect on the syneresis of its gel in comparison {{to those of other}} modified starches and the native one. The maximum viscosity decreased in pregelatinized starch followed by acid-thinned starch in comparison to native <b>corn</b> <b>starch.</b> The same trend was found in the viscosity after holding at 95 °C for 15 min. The highest noodle weight and volume increases were recorded for noodles containing 5 % and 10 % of native <b>corn</b> <b>starch</b> followed by 10 % of pregelatinized <b>corn</b> <b>starch,</b> as well as, the control. Replacing wheat flour with 5 %, 10 % and 15 % of native or pregelatinized <b>corn</b> <b>starch</b> did not cause any negative effects on sensory attributes of noodles in comparison to the control sample.

40|$|The {{hydrophilic}} flocculation of pyrite fines in aqueous suspensions with <b>corn</b> <b>starch</b> was {{studied by}} measuring particle size distribution, microscopy observation and micro-flotation. Furthermore, {{the interaction of}} <b>corn</b> <b>starch</b> with pyrite was investigated by determining the adsorption density and based on zeta potential measurements and X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS) analysis in this work.

The micro-flotation {{results suggest that the}} mechanical entrainment of pyrite fines in flotation can be effectively eliminated through the formation of large-size flocs.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to investigate the effect of replacement of 50 % cottonseed meal (CSM) nitrogen with various non protein nitrogen (NPN) sources i. e. urea (CU), biuret (CB) and diammonium phosphate (CD). The four energy sources were: wheat straw with no <b>corn</b> <b>starch</b> (WS), WS + 20 % <b>corn</b> <b>starch,</b> WS + 30 % <b>corn</b> <b>starch</b> and WS + 40 % <b>corn</b> <b>starch.</b> These substrates were fermented with rumen liquor to measure in vitro dry matter digestibility (DMD), bacterial count and ammonia nitrogen (NH 3 -N) concentrations. The protein sources provided 2 % nitrogen (12. 5 % CP). The control substrate contained CSM as the sole source of nitrogen and ground wheat straw as the sole sources of energy. The in vitro DMD increased to 49. 10, 40. 06 and 31. 52 % in substrates containing CB, CU and CD compared to 23. 10 % for CSM (P< 0. 01). Similarly, supplementation of straw with 20, 30 and 40 % <b>corn</b> <b>starch</b> gave 24. 31, 38. 03 and 45. 48 % DMD compared to 23. 10 % for control (P< 0. 01).

40|$|The {{rheological}} properties of <b>corn</b> and potato <b>starch</b> concentrated aqueous solutions were investigated at 25 ºC. The starches were previously dispersed {{in water and}} the solutions were obtained by heating of dispersions at 115 - 120 ºC for 20 minutes. The solutions of potato starch were transparent, while the <b>corn</b> <b>starch</b> solutions were opalescent. The results of dynamic mechanical measurements showed that the values of viscosity, h, storage modulus, G′, and loss modulus, G″, of the <b>corn</b> <b>starch</b> solutions increased with the storage time. This phenomenon was not observed for the potato starch solutions. It was assumed that the increase of h, G′ and G″ {{is the result of}} starch solutions retrogradation. The potato starch solutions retrogradation did not occur probably because of the phosphates presence. The viscosity of 2 mass % <b>corn</b> <b>starch</b> solution is less than the viscosity of 2 mass % potato starch solution. By increasing the concentration of <b>corn</b> <b>starch</b> solution the gel with elastic behavior was formed. The <b>corn</b> <b>starch</b> solutions formed gel as early as at 4 mass % concentration, while potato starch solutions achieved the gel state at the concentration of 5 mass %. The value of exponent m (G′ and G″ µ wm) during the transition of potato starch solutions to gel is 0. 414, which gives the fractal dimensions for <b>corn</b> <b>starch</b> of 2. 10. The obtained value of fractal dimension corresponds to slow aggregation. The <b>corn</b> <b>starch</b> solutions with the starch concentrations higher than 4 mass % form weak gels.
