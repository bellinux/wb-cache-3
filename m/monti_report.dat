40|$|In 2012, the European Single Market will {{celebrate}} its 20 th anniversary. Thanks to the May 2010 <b>Monti</b> <b>report</b> {{and the release}} of the European Commission's 'Towards a Single Market Act' six months later, renewed scrutiny is being given to the market's achievements and failings over the previous two decades. In this issue's Forum, our authors analyse this progress from diverse viewpoints and draw different conclusions as to the future path to be taken...|$|E
40|$|In this Commentary, CEPS Senior Fellow Jacques Pelkmans is mystified {{to explain}} why Mario Monti’s recent report, A new {{strategy}} for the single market, has not provoked much reaction, neither among stakeholders in the 'Brussels circuit' nor in the member states. In his view, the report should have stimulated lively debate on its highly strategic reflections and active discussions and positioning on the numerous concrete proposals. In the hope of sparking just such a debate, Pelkmans briefly sets out the main lines of the <b>Monti</b> <b>report</b> and calls attention to its most critical aspects...|$|E
40|$|The {{issue of}} further {{harmonisation}} of copyright at the EU level is currently at {{the centre of}} heated debates concerning its desirability and feasibility as such. In the course of 2010 alone, the Wittem Group published its European Copyright Code and the <b>Monti</b> <b>Report</b> addressed the role of copyright {{in the light of}} proposing a new strategy for the internal market. However, so far, no decisive legislative actions have been taken at the EU level to address the future of copyright. Despite this impasse, the Court of Justice has acted in a proactive way towards the actual harmonisation of copyright. The decision in Infopaq, as later followed in Bezpe% 24 cnostní softwarová asociace, has provided the harmonisation of a fundamental principle of copyright, i. e., the originality requirement. The impact of these judgments on the copyright laws of the Member States is likely to be relevant, as made clear (even if just in part) by the ruling of the High Court (England and Wales) in Meltwater, recently upheld by the Court of Appeal for England and Wales. However, the actual implications of CJEU's decisions have yet to be fully worked out: the Football Dataco reference stands as a demonstration of the doubts and ambiguities that Infopaq has cast on the overall architecture of EU copyright...|$|E
40|$|Islet {{transplantation}} can temporarily cure type 1 {{diabetes mellitus}} (T 1 DM) but requires simultaneous immunosuppression to avoid allograft rejection. In {{this issue of the}} JCI, <b>Monti</b> et al. <b>report</b> that immune conditioning via use of the Edmonton protocol - a treatment approach in which T 1 DM patients infused with pancreatic islets from multiple cadaveric donors simultaneously receive immunosuppressive drugs - results in lymphopenia that is associated with elevated serum levels of the homeostatic cytokines IL- 7 and IL- 15, which causes in vivo expansion of the autoreactive CD 8 (+) T cell population (see the related article beginning on page 1806). Reemergence of autoreactivity is likely the main culprit underlying long-term islet graft failure, and new strategies will need to be tested to circumvent this homeostatic expansion and recurrent autoreactivity. status: publishe...|$|R
