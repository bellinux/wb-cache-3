40|$|This thesis {{sets out}} to {{increase}} our understanding on how to conduct successful <b>military</b> <b>interventions</b> <b>in</b> internal wars, such as the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in Afghanistan. But, instead of investigating different variables which might contribute to success, {{the focus is on}} the practice of knowledge production. Numerous scholars have focused on how to conduct <b>military</b> <b>interventions</b> <b>in</b> internal wars successfully. However, research is conducted in different disciplines, such as Peace Studies and War Studies. According to interdisciplinary advocates, this might impede a rational advancement of knowledge. The aim of this thesis, therefore, is to scrutinise whether <b>military</b> <b>interventions</b> <b>in</b> internal wars are understood and approached differently in different disciplines, and to investigate whether these differences result in different knowledge about how to conduct successful <b>military</b> <b>interventions</b> <b>in</b> internal wars. The investigation has been conducted in two steps. In the first step – focusing on theory – research on peace operations and counterinsurgencies was compared, regarding underlying assumptions, independent and dependent variables, causal mechanisms and methodology. Several differences were identified. Not only are the underlying assumptions, theories, and variables different between the two research areas of peace operations and counterinsurgencies, there are also differences in methodological approaches, such as the unit of analysis. These differences could imply that disciplines frame the way we understand the object of study and how we conduct research. In the second step – focusing on practice – the ISAF mission in Afghanistan was interpreted from the two disciplinary perspectives. Several differences were identified here as well, suggesting that disciplinary approaches influence our knowledge of how to conduct successful <b>military</b> <b>interventions</b> <b>in</b> internal wars. Departing from the differences found between the two research areas in the first part of the thesis, different ways to overcome these differences are suggested. Following these suggestions, research on <b>military</b> <b>interventions</b> <b>in</b> internal wars might become more rational, potentially increasing our understanding of how to conduct these operations successfully...|$|R

5|$|Both the United States and Australia {{cited the}} {{alliance}} as justification for involvement in Vietnam.

Other countries, such as the UK and key nations in Asia, accepted the rationale. In 1962, {{as part of its}} commitment to SEATO, the Royal Australian Air Force deployed CAC Sabres of its No. 79 Squadron to Ubon Royal Thai Air Force Base, Thailand. The Sabres began {{to play a role in}} the Vietnam War in 1965, when their air defence responsibilities expanded to include protection of USAF aircraft using Ubon as a base for strikes against North Vietnam.|$|E

5|$|In 2011, Italian Harriers, {{operating}} from Giuseppe Garibaldi, worked alongside Italian Eurofighters and aircraft {{of other nations}} during Operation Unified Protector, part of the 2011 <b>military</b> <b>intervention</b> <b>in</b> Libya.

In total, Italian military aircraft delivered 710 guided bombs and missiles during sorties: Italian Air Force Tornados and AMX fighter bombers delivered 550 bombs and missiles, while the eight Italian Navy AV-8Bs flying from Giuseppe Garibaldi dropped 160 guided bombs during 1,221 flight hours.|$|E

40|$|The {{dissertation}} examines three <b>military</b> <b>interventions</b> <b>in</b> Sub-Saharan Africa {{which took}} place in the mid and late 1990 s in Rwanda, the DRC and Lesotho. These interventions took place despite high expectations of international and regional peace on the part of most analysts after the collapse of cold war in 1989. However, interstate and intrastate conflicts re-emerged with more intensity than ever before, and sub-Saharan Africa proved to be no exception. The study sets out to analyse the motives and/or causes of <b>military</b> <b>interventions</b> <b>in</b> Rwanda in 1990, the DRC in 1996 - 7, and the DRC military rebellion and the Lesotho <b>intervention</b> <b>in</b> 1998. <b>In</b> analysing these <b>interventions,</b> the study borrows extensively from the work of dominant security theorists of international relations, predominantly realists who conceptualise international relations as a struggle for power and survival in the anarchic world. The purpose of this analysis is fourfold; firstly, to determine the reasons for <b>military</b> <b>interventions</b> {{and the extent to which}} these interventions were conducted on humanitarian grounds; secondly, to investigate the degree to which or not intervening countries were spurred by their national interests; thirdly, to assess the roles of international organisations lik...|$|R
