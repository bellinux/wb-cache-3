5|$|By May, the Rangers were emplaced at Hill 258, on {{the front}} lines between the 31st RCT and the 7th Marine Regiment of the U.S. 1st Marine Division. They {{conducted}} frequent patrols along an outpost network, often encountering and engaging Chinese troops. They fortified the hill and surrounding areas, which served as an advance outpost to warn the 7th Infantry Division if the Chinese attacked. During this period, the fighting entered a lull, and troops resumed their rest and recuperation rotations. Allen, Pryor, and Freeman left on one such rotation with a number of men, leaving Queen and only 80 enlisted <b>men</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> hill.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} this period, the {{constant}} attempts at reorganisation had proved a mixed bag, particularly for the auxiliary forces. The Militia was heavily understrength and disorganised, whilst the number of recruits for the Volunteers was falling off and the financial situation of the units was becoming worrying. The system of central per-capita grants helped support the units, despite the worrying side-effect of causing an incentive to keep as many <b>men</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> books as possible regardless of fitness, but even so it was becoming apparent that many Volunteer Corps were headed towards financial collapse unless some action were taken.|$|E
