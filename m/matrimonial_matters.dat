40|$|The {{principle}} of open justice underlies public accessibility to courts and accountability {{of decision making}} through publicity and freedom of information. This is modified in family proceedings, especially where children are involved and we {{shy away from the}} idea of 'trial as a public spectacle'. In the leading early 20 th century case upholding the principle even in <b>matrimonial</b> disputes, <b>matters</b> affecting children were excepted as ?truly private affairs?. However, the law is {{now in the process of}} being reformed to bring family courts more into line with other types of courts in England and Wales. The consultation process that led to the changes included commitments to take the views and interests of children and young people into account. Not only do these commitments remain unmet, but the proposed changes pose a number of new challenges to children?s rights and welfare. In December 2008, the Secretary of State for Justice and Lord Chancellor, Jack Straw, announced to Parliament that court rules would be changed to allow representatives of the media to attend family court proceedings, as of right, which they had previously been unable to do. This announcement coincided with the publication of Family Justice in View: Ministry of Justice Response to Consultation. The decision on media attendance came as some surprise to observers, because it contradicted an earlier decision in June 2007 against allowing the media into any tier of family court as of right. In accordance with the revised policy in December 2008, court rules were subsequently amended, with effect from 27 April 2009, to allow journalists with press cards the right to attend family court hearings unless the court made a specific decision to exclude them. More far-reaching changes are to be included in a Bill to be introduced in the 2009 - 2010 Parliamentary session. This will allow the press and broadcasting media a right to publish details of the evidence given, although in anonymised form and still subject to potential veto by the court. The meaning of these changes will be explored in this article. Initially, the obvious question is: what happened between June 2007 and December 2008 to bring about this volte face? This article will argue that both the premise and the consultation process on these reforms have ignored and infringed a range of children?s rights. The background to the proposed reforms will first be explained, and the relationships between concepts of secrecy, privacy, transparency and openness. Drawing on the literature on moral and legal rights to privacy leads to a question as to whether children are or should be accorded a different level of privacy rights than adults. The development of the law that protects privacy in family courts will be set out, followed by the effects of the changes. Analysing the reform process, and the particular nature of cases heard in family courts, it is concluded that children?s rights have been overridden by adult interests...|$|R
40|$|For {{over half}} a century now section 2 (a) of the Arbitration Act 42 of 1965 has {{prohibited}} arbitration in respect of <b>matrimonial</b> and related <b>matters.</b> In this article, it will be illustrated that this prohibition is clearly incompatible with present-day demands. Today {{there is a strong}} tendency in public policy towards alternative dispute resolution processes such as arbitration. As any recommendations that arbitration should be applied to family law disputes must be anchored in an analysis of the specific character of the arbitral remedy, the article begins by giving a broad overview of the nature of arbitration. This is followed by a discussion of the present-day demand for family arbitration, which examines the problems experienced with the adversarial system of litigation in resolving family law disputes, party-autonomy, the development of alternative dispute resolution processes such as mediation and arbitration, the special synergy between mediation and arbitration, the success of arbitration in other fields of law and possible forerunners for family arbitration in South Africa. Inherent in the demand for family law arbitration are the many advantages of arbitration which are also touched upon. Thirdly, current trends in England, Australia, the United States of America, Canada and India are analysed so as to identify a suitable family law arbitration model for South Africa. Special attention is paid to the matters that should be referred to arbitration – for example, should it be confined to matrimonial property and financial disputes or extended to all matters incidental to divorce or family breakdown, including children’s issues? Other questions examined include whether family arbitration should comply with substantive law only, who should act as arbitrators, whether family arbitration should be voluntary or compulsory, what the court’s role in the family arbitration process should be, and whether family law arbitration should be regulated by the existing Arbitration Act or by a separate statute with specialised rules for family matters. Lastly, it is concluded that although family arbitration will not have universal appeal or common application, it should be encouraged and enforceable for those who choose this private alternative dispute settlement technique to resolve their family disputes.

50|$|Marali Mannige is a sad and {{touching}} tale, {{but it just}} looks like a long news story from the Sunday edition of a newspaper. It doesn’t grow above that and become an artistic product. Moreover, there is lot of focus given in narrating mundane actives of life like farming and maintaining roofs of houses etc., that become dragging and boring in the end. I enjoyed reading about the daily life of Parothi and Sarasothi in the initial chapters and I felt it as beautiful. I thought that they are just kind of making background for telling a story of greater depth and universality. But as the novel progresses, a considerable portion of it is still dedicated to describing the same things {{over and over again}} without providing any artistic experience to the reader. This just adds more to the journalistic nature of the novel. This journalistic nature becomes prominent especially in the last few chapters, and because of that, even Rama's and Nagaveni's love for sea and music I felt as hollow and artificially developed. Even in the last chapter, there are lots of discussions still going on regarding whether farming paddy is better than cashew nuts, and there are many paragraphs about cultivating and selling tobacco. It was funny that the main topic of the last chapter was <b>matrimonial</b> <b>matters</b> and how Rama's relatives try to convince him that marriage is very essential in life. The novel ends in a happy note with Rama about to get married. But I didn’t have any feeling of reading a great novel. I had liked Shivarama Karanth's other works that I read, and since Marali Mannige was a long village story covering many generations, I was expecting it to be a classic in the lines of Gana Devatha by Tharashankar Banerjee or Oru Deshathinte Katha by SK Pottekkatt.

40|$|The paper {{discusses}} {{jurisdiction of}} the Consistory in <b>matrimonial</b> <b>matters</b> in {{the central part of}} Poland between 1919 - 1939, where, pursuant to the matrimonial law of 1836, jurisdiction in matters such as separation, divorce and nullification of marriage was vested in certain church courts. Decisions issued by those churches were recognised as binding and effective decisions in civil law as well. The main considerations focus of the scope of civil jurisdiction of church courts, and, in particular, their jurisdiction as demarcated by the law. Under that law, <b>matrimonial</b> <b>matters</b> were submitted to a church court that was relevant for the religious faith of the spouses in question. Where spouses were of two different denominations, proper jurisdiction for them was determined by the interdenominational matrimonial law of 1836. However, adjudications of church courts other than RC church court were not always accepted by the dominant RC church. This led to frequent disputes regarding their recognition by civil courts. The key subject of the research is the denominational aspect of the jurisdiction of a church court. The paper also includes different interpretations of the interdenominational provisions formulated by leading theoreticians of the interwar period. As can be seen, the differences of their opinions as well as incoherent {{jurisdiction of the}} Supreme Court created many doubts with regards to the enforcement of a decision in a matrimonial matter issued by a church court with improper jurisdiction. And so, in its decision of 8 November 1926 the Supreme Court adjudicated that a state court was empowered to investigate the jurisdiction of a church court which has issued a decision in a matrimonial matter. At the same time, however, it took a stance that the provisions of the state interdenominational law should be absolutely binding. And yet, in some other cases it tended to marginalise the state law and allowed to base civil jurisdiction of a RC court entirely on canon law. These examples illustrate a tendency of the Supreme Court to favour broad construction of the principle laid down in Article 114 of the Constitution that the Roman Catholic Church in Poland should be governed by its own laws...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The Supreme Court of the Republic of Ghana {{has given}} value to gender roles of women (and men) in the home. For too long many courts had {{relied on the}} need to {{establish}} substantial contribution by spouses to joint property which many women could not prove, thereby being entitled to less than half of joint property. In <b>matrimonial</b> <b>matters</b> however, case law developed around the Matrimonial Causes Act 1971, (Act 367) acknowledge the weak financial contribution of a spouse to property acquisition.   The courts in their application of equitable principles require a spouse claiming a share in joint property to provide proof of substantial contribution. This principle of proving substantial contribution has for decades being to the disadvantage of many women who, in performing their gender roles as wives, do not keep records of contribution made to joint property. However, in the last decade, some courts began recognising the value of a wife’s contribution to matrimonial property even if the contribution was non-monetary. The Supreme Court case of Gladys Mensah v. Stephen Mensah now firmly establishes the principle of equality in property distribution. Keywords : Equality. Women matrimonial rights.

40|$|The Community {{legislator}} {{is carrying}} out an ambitious project {{with the aim}} of laying down a regulatory framework for international relations governed by private law in order to provide them with greater legal certainty, without relinquishing the particular characteristics of the different national legislations. Within this framework, several initiatives have been taken for the unification of conflict of law, both in property and family matters, which are at different processing stages (Regulations, Proposals for Regulations or Green Papers). This work consists of a serious and rigorous analysis of all these initiatives, proposing keys and principles to solve them in order to make them known. The first part analyses the initiatives of the Community legislator in the field of property law. This field is at a later processing stage and this allowed the analysis of the content of the already approved Regulation concerning non-contractual obligations –Regulation (EC) No 864 / 2007 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 July 2007 on the law applicable to non-contractual obligations (Rome II), as well as the proposal for a Regulation that is meant to replace very soon the Rome Convention of 19 June 1980 on the law applicable to contractual obligations (Rome I).
