Educate to Eradicate is a K- 12 {{curriculum}} project using termite {{biology and}} control {{as the basis}} for science education that has been implemented in over 350 Hawaii public school classrooms with more than 12, 530 students from 2001 to present. This study was initiated to (1) evaluate the efficacy of Educate to Eradicate curricula, and (2) identify factors that influence the adoption and continuation of pest management curricula in public school classrooms. A mixed methods approach, using surveys, focus groups, and work samples, was used to measure changes in teacher knowledge/ practice, student knowledge, behavior, and engagement. Additionally, effects of teacher and curricular characteristics on project adoption and continuation were assessed. Teachers demonstrated <b>mastery</b> <b>of</b> <b>project</b> content by accurately discussing content, describing their application of curriculum in detail, and sharing curricular modifications and investments. Teachers created original inquiry activities, procured non-fiction resource materials, and constructed lesson props. Early-adopting elementary teachers described additional focus on science to motivate students both before and after Educate to Eradicate adoption. Late-adopting elementary teachers reported at least doubling classroom time devoted to science during the Educate to Eradicate unit. Middle and high school partner teachers reported Educate to Eradicate as their only project-based unit. Teachers were impressed with students' unit-specific content retention. Teachers reported increased student motivation and interest in science. Additionally, teachers described how students applied unit knowledge and skills inside and outside of the classroom during structured and independent activities. Teachers identified the following keys to curricula adoption and continuation: (1) curricula should be tightly and explicitly linked to state standards, incorporate a range of current best-practice pedagogies (including inquiry), include interdisciplinary lessons, and be written/formatted for easy teacher use/adaptation. (2) Professional development should deepen teachers' content knowledge while minimizing additional time demands. Teachers suggested the creation of Educate to Eradicate videos that include science content and lesson modeling. (3) Project supports should excite entire grade levels/departments about curricula, provide technical support, and create user-friendly lessons that minimize teacher time inputs. Teachers need live termites and habitats to continue Educate to Eradicate curricula independently. The goal of this program is a self-sustaining curricula which requires limited institutional inputs, increases science literacy in Hawaii schools, and helps to protect current and future homeowners from incurring structural termite damage...|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 92 - 107). Managing {{an information}} systems (IS) {{project is a}} challenging undertaking because of {{the very nature of}} these projects. The IS project manager is challenged with increasing and changing requirements, the management of technical resources and business users, and the delivery of the project to meet the business need in time and on budget. The high failure rate of projects in general is a concern for organizations as this can have serious repercussions for the business in terms of loss in turnover or business opportunities. The abilities that are required of an IS project manager in order to manage IS projects efficiently and successfully are of interest to both organizations and the IS project managers themselves. The <b>mastery</b> <b>of</b> <b>project</b> management competencies was previously regarded as being sufficient for successful project management. However, with the high rate of project failure, it became evident that successful project managers have other "soft" skills or abilities over and above these competencies that enable them to be successful. The leadership style that the project manager employs during the project can affect the outcome of the project. A transformational leader motivates and inspires the team to improve themselves and become more effective. Emotional Intelligence is a soft skill that enhances the project manager's ability to practice transformational leadership. This study examined the relationship between emotional intelligence and transformational leadership of South African project managers practicing specifically in the IS field. The study further explored the effect of demographic factors such as age, gender and occupational background on emotional intelligence and transformational leadership, and {{the relationship between the two}} constructs. Data was collected from a sample of 49 IS project managers based in South Africa. The Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire was used to determine leadership and the Genas El Inventory was used to determine the emotional intelligence of the participants. The results of the data analysis show a strong positive and significant relationship between the transformational leadership and emotional intelligence of South African IS project managers. None of the demographic factors had an effect on the relationship between emotional intelligence and transformational leadership. IS project managers with a more technical background showed lower average scores for both emotional intelligence and transformational leadership than their peers. Female IS project managers showed slightly higher average scores for both transformational leadership and emotional intelligence than their male counterparts. The results suggest that an increase in emotional intelligence can assist an IS project manager to effectively improve their transformational leadership skills. Further research into the appropriate interventions that should be introduced in order to increase emotional intelligence In South African project managers is advisable. The perceived effect on the project team and the success of the IS project manager after introducing these interventions should be measured. This will be useful in motivating South African organizations to facilitate and encourage their IS project managers to develop their emotional intelligence and transformational leadership skills in order to be more effective and achieve better results with IS project implementation...|$|E

We illustrate these concerns by way of a real-world example where a deployed management information system required an invasive modification to make the system fit for future use. The chosen project is particularly suited for a complete treatise because of its size (just 90, 000 LOC), and the nature of the relevant architectural modification (namely, a form of data expansion).
