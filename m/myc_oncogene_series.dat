In situ nucleic acid hybridization was used to permit analysis not only of tumors but also of normal C-cells which form a tiny, scattered, minority of the thyroid epithelial cell population. N-myc expression was readily demonstrable in 6 of 21 tumor samples and c-myc in one case, whereas neither N- nor c-myc mRNA was ever detected in normal C-cells.

40|$|Non-Hodgkin {{lymphoma}} is {{a common}} feature of AIDS. Approximately 30 - 40 % of these tumors exhibit clinical features suggestive of endemic Burkitt lymphoma: they are aggressive malignancies that occur in association with Epstein-Barr virus infection, they arise {{in the setting of}} immunosuppression, and they carry t(8; 14) translocations without detectable rearrangement of the <b>MYC</b> <b>oncogene.</b> To understand the molecular basis of these parallels, we analyzed a case of Epstein-Barr-positive AIDS-associated undifferentiated lymphoma. Southern blots show that the tumor exhibits immunoglobulin joining segment rearrangement but no rearrangement of the <b>MYC</b> <b>oncogene.</b> Cloning of the rearranged joining segment allowed the isolation of recombinant clones encompassing the translocation breakpoint, and sequencing of the translocation junction disclosed that the breakpoint is situated 7 base pairs from the chromosome 14 site involved in a previously described endemic Burkitt lymphoma translocation. Furthermore, the breakpoint is situated far from MYC on chromosome 8, a constant finding in endemic Burkitt lymphomas. That the molecular architecture of the translocation in this case is strikingly similar to previously analyzed translocations from endemic Burkitt lymphomas strongly suggests that common molecular mechanisms must be operative in the pathogenesis of these tumors...|$|R

40|$|The MYC oncogenic {{transcription}} factor is overexpressed in most human cases of T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), often downstream of mutational NOTCH 1 activation. Genetic alterations in the PTEN-PI 3 K-AKT pathway are also common in T-ALL.

In prostate cancer, nucleolar enlargement and increased numbers {{are some of}} the earliest morphological changes associated with development of premalignant prostate intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) lesions and invasive adenocarcinomas. However, the molecular mechanisms that induce nucleolar alterations in PIN and prostate cancer remain largely unknown. We verify that activation of the <b>MYC</b> <b>oncogene,</b> which is overexpressed in most human PIN and prostatic adenocarcinomas, leads to formation of enlarged nucleoli and increased nucleolar number in prostate luminal epithelial cells in vivo. In prostate cancer cells in vitro, MYC expression is needed for maintenance of nucleolar number, and a nucleolar program of gene expression. To begin to decipher the functional relevance of this transcriptional program in prostate cancer, we examined FBL (encoding fibrillarin), a MYC target gene, and report that fibrillarin is required for proliferation, clonogenic survival, and proper ribosomal RNA accumulation/processing in human prostate cancer cells. Further, fibrillarin is overexpressed in PIN lesions induced by MYC overexpression in the mouse prostate, and in human clinical prostate adenocarcinoma and PIN lesions, where its expression correlates with MYC levels.

Our observations also suggest that a much wider range of cell types become targets for malignant transformation when the embryos are exposed to the myc and the ras oncogenes simultaneously than when exposed to the same oncogenes separately.

LC-FeLV infection in kittens may induce, but does not necessarily induce, thymic lymphosarcoma in viremic animals after a short latency. These observations suggest that infection with LC-FeLV {{is not sufficient to}} induce complete transformation and that another genetic event(s) is required. One possibility for such an event is that the integrating provirus acts as an insertional mutagen and thereby disrupts the structure or function of another proto-oncogene. Using a strategy of transposon tagging, this possibility was examined in eight feline T-cell lymphosarcomas, including four induced by experimental infection with LC-FeLV, three induced by natural infection with FeLV, and one FeLV-negative tumor. The analysis demonstrated one locus, termed flvi- 2, to be structurally altered in six of the tumors examined, including three induced by LC-FeLV and three in which no activated <b>myc</b> <b>oncogene</b> is apparent.
