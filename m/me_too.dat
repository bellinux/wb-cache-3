25|$|She chose {{a spiritual}} director, a Jesuit, Father Pichon. At their first meeting, 28 May 1888, {{she made a}} general {{confession}} going back over all her past sins. She came away from it profoundly relieved. The priest who had himself suffered from scruples, understood her and reassured her. A few months later, he left for Canada, and Thérèse would {{only be able to}} ask his advice by letter and his replies were rare. (On 4 July 1897, she confided to Pauline, 'Father Pichon treated <b>me</b> <b>too</b> much like a child; nonetheless he did me a lot of good too by saying that I never committed a mortal sin.') During her time as a postulant, Thérèse had to endure some bullying from other sisters because of her lack of aptitude for handicrafts and manual work. Sister St Vincent de Paul, the finest embroiderer in the community made her feel awkward and even called her 'the big nanny goat'. Thérèse was in fact the tallest in the family, 1.62 metres (approx. 5'3"). Pauline, the shortest, was no more than 1.54m tall (approx.5').|$|E

The brethren sent for Muhkam, the eldest son of Churaman, and made him head of the deceased’s zamindari and gave over to him all his goods. Zul karan, the second son of Churaman said to his brother, “ Give <b>me</b> <b>too</b> a share in those goods and admit me as partner.” A verbal dispute {{followed}} and Muhkam made ready to resist by force. Zul Karan determined to have the quarrel out, gathered men together, and attacked his brother. The elders of the place sent word to Churaman spoke to Muhkam. The son replied to his father in abusive language, and showed himself ready to fight his father {{as well as his}} brother. Churaman lost his temper, and from chagrin swallowed up a dose of deadly poison which he always carried with him and going to an orchard in that village lay down and gave up the ghost. After a long time had elapsed, men were sent to search for him and they found his dead body.|$|E

500|$|For the costumes, Madonna {{collaborated with}} {{designer}} Marlene Stewart. She expanded {{on the idea}} of bringing her popular video characters to life onstage, reworking scenes from [...] "True Blue", [...] "Open Your Heart", [...] "Papa Don't Preach" [...] and [...] "La Isla Bonita". For [...] "Open Your Heart", Madonna reused the Stewart designed black bustier worn by her in the video, complete with tassels, golden tips and ribbing with fishnets on leg. Stewart's other designs included a Flamenco style dress for [...] "La Isla Bonita" [...] and a gold lamé jacket for the [...] "White Heat" [...] sequence. On the medley sequence, Madonna used a dress that was visually amusing and, according to Madonna, was for [...] "anyone that takes <b>me</b> <b>too</b> seriously, or imagined and I take myself too seriously." [...] Inspired by Dame Edna Everage, the dress consisted of a hat strewn with fake fruits, flowers and feathers, jeweled batwing spectacles with heavy, black frames, a ruffled skirt and a bodice covered with objects such as watches and dolls and fishnets. The knickers were inscribed with the word [...] "Kiss". Continuing her tradition of message clothes, she spelt out the phrase [...] "You Can Dance" [...] on her jacket, using the letter U, a can of soup and the word [...] "dance" [...] at the back.|$|E
500|$|At 8:32a.m. {{local time}} {{the next day}} (18 May), an {{earthquake}} measuring magnitude 5.1 rocked the area, triggering the landslide that started the main eruption. In a matter of seconds, vibrations from the earthquake loosened [...] of rock on the mountain's north face and summit, creating a massive landslide. With {{the loss of the}} confining pressure of the overlying rock, Mount St. Helens began to rapidly emit steam and other volcanic gases. A few seconds later, it erupted laterally, sending swift pyroclastic flows down its flanks at near supersonic speeds. These flows were later joined by lahars. Before being struck by a series of flows that, at their fastest, would have taken less than a minute to reach his position, Johnston managed to radio his USGS co-workers with the message: [...] "Vancouver! Vancouver! This is it!" [...] Seconds later, the signal from the radio went silent, and all contact with the geologist was lost. Initially, there was some debate as to whether Johnston had survived; records soon showed a radio message from fellow eruption victim and amateur radio operator Gerry Martin, located near the Coldwater peak and farther north of Johnston's position, reporting his sighting of the eruption enveloping the ColdwaterII observation post. As the blast overwhelmed Johnston's post, Martin declared solemnly, [...] "Gentlemen, the uh... camper and the car sitting over to the south of me is covered. It's gonna get <b>me,</b> <b>too.</b> I can't get out of here..." [...] before his radio went silent.|$|E

500|$|Noting the song's [...] "hit potential", Leng {{views the}} {{cancellation}} as [...] "ne {{of the more}} anomalous features" [...] of Harrison's musical career. Leng has speculated that the single was withdrawn because of the similarity between [...] "Don't Let <b>Me</b> Wait <b>Too</b> Long" [...] and [...] "Give Me Love". Author Andrew Grant Jackson suggests {{that the reason for}} the cancellation was due to [...] "Don't Let <b>Me</b> Wait <b>Too</b> Long" [...] having a similar sound to [...] "When I'm Dead and Gone", a 1970 hit song by McGuinness Flint. Although Harrison did not enjoy success with [...] "Don't Let <b>Me</b> Wait <b>Too</b> Long" [...] as a single, Leng and Inglis comment that the song anticipated a number of radio-friendly singles by ELO during the 1970s, particularly their 1976 hit [...] "Livin' Thing".|$|R
500|$|Napoleon demanded, from {{a highly}} {{superior}} position, peace terms {{in what was}} to be called the Peace of Tilsit (1807). In the midst of these negotiations, the emperor agreed to keep half of Prussia intact. The men were joined by Queen Louise; Frederick William had sent for his wife, then pregnant with her daughter Princess Louise, to beg for a better settlement for Prussia, with Louise advising her husband, [...] "For God's sake no shameful peace... should at least not go down without honor." [...] As the king felt that her presence might put Napoleon in a [...] "more relaxed mood"; Louise reluctantly agreed to meet the emperor at Tilsit, but only to save [...] "her Prussia". Napoleon had previously attempted to destroy her reputation by questioning Louise's marital fidelity, but the queen met him anyway, attempting to use her beauty and charm to flatter him into more favorable terms. Formerly Louise had regularly referred to him as [...] "the Monster", but nevertheless made a request for a private interview with the emperor, whereon she threw herself at his feet; though he was impressed by her grace and determination, Napoleon refused to make any concessions, writing back to his wife Empress Joséphine that Louise [...] "is really charming and full of coquettishness toward me. But don't be jealous...it would cost <b>me</b> <b>too</b> dearly to play the gallant." [...] Napoleon's attempts to destroy Louise's reputation failed however, and they only made her more beloved in Prussia. Queen Louise's efforts to protect her adopted country from French aggression secured for her the admiration of future generations.|$|E
500|$|... "Lucky Day" [...] is a pop song {{featuring}} {{an upbeat}} rhythm and synths. The song has gathered comparisons to the Katy Perry song [...] "Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.)"

In the introduction Roberts sings [...] "Could it be my lucky day?"; the track continues with [...] "Just light the first spark, {{and watch the}} fireworks explode. Boom, Boom, Baby", {{in what has been}} described by Robert Copsey of Digital Spy as a [...] "60s-swing-meets-East-London vibe". Roberts' voice has been described by Katherine St Asaph of Pop Dust as a [...] "springy" [...] vibrato, with breathy background vocals featuring sounds effect including repeated kissing noises. Roberts sings about falling in love with someone, as she sings: [...] "Aah, say that you love me, say that you need <b>me</b> <b>too...</b> best you ever had. It could be so easy, for you to please me, baby. So how come you tease me?". Roberts discussed the track on her blog, commenting that its lyrical content alludes to a boy that initially does not share the same feelings as his partner, [...] "but in the end you win him over and it's your lucky day. You can take it however you want though, maybe you won on the scratch cards and so you had a lucky day, that kind of thing". Roberts described it as a [...] "romantic reference" [...] with a [...] "down-beat track underneath", and in contrast called the top-line of the track [...] "quite cute and girly". A remix of the song was producer by band White Lies, and debuted on The Guardian.
