40|$|The core {{research}} questions {{addressed in this}} paper are: what factors influence HR professionals in deciding whether to approve training proposals for older workers? What kind of training are they more likely to recommend for older employees and in which organizational contexts? We administered three factorial surveys to 66 HR professionals in Italy. Participants made specific training decisions based on profiles of hypothetical older workers. Multilevel analyses indicated that access to training decreases strongly with age, while highly-skilled older employees with low absenteeism rates {{are more likely to}} enjoy training opportunities. In addition, older workers displaying positive performance are more likely to receive training than older workers who perform poorly, suggesting that training late in working life may serve as a reward for good performance rather than as a means of enhancing productivity. The older the HR professional evaluating training proposals, the higher the probability that older workers will be recommended for training. keywords: training; older workers; HR professionals; factorial survey; <b>multilevel</b> <b>mode...</b>|$|E

40|$|Regulated {{activity}} of the retrograde molecular motor, cytoplasmic dynein, is crucial for multiple biological activities, and failure to regulate this activity can result in neuronal migration retardation or neuronal degeneration. The {{activity of}} dynein {{is controlled by the}} LIS 1 –Ndel 1 –Nde 1 protein complex that participates in intracellular transport, mitosis, and neuronal migration. These biological processes are subject to tight <b>multilevel</b> <b>modes</b> of regulation. Palmitoylation is a reversible posttranslational lipid modification, which can dynamically regulate protein trafficking. We found that both Ndel 1 and Nde 1 undergo palmitoylation in vivo and in transfected cells by specific palmitoylation enzymes. Unpalmitoylated Ndel 1 interacts better with dynein, whereas the interaction between Nde 1 and cytoplasmic dynein is unaffected by palmitoylation. Furthermore, palmitoylated Ndel 1 reduced cytoplasmic dynein activity as judged by Golgi distribution, VSVG and short microtubule trafficking, transport of endogenous Ndel 1 and LIS 1 from neurite tips to the cell body, retrograde trafficking of dynein puncta, and neuronal migration.

40|$|Abstract- Solid-state {{switch-mode}} rectification converters {{have reached}} a matured level for improving power quality in terms of power-factor correction (PFC), reduced total harmonic distortion at input ac mains and precisely regulated dc output in buck, boost, buck–boost and <b>multilevel</b> <b>modes</b> with unidirectional and bidirectional power flow. In this paper, an improved power quality converter employing conventional PI based & intelligence controlled (FLC) forward buck converter topology is used to feed a permanent magnet brushless DC motor (PMBLDCM) drive. Normally, the PMBLDCM drive consists of a three-phase voltage source inverter (VSI) and a PMBLDCM which is fed from single-phase AC mains through a diode bridge rectifier (DBR). In this proposed system a conventional pi and fuzzy logic controlled based forward buck DC-DC converter is used after the DBR and it performs power factor correction (PFC) at input AC mains and voltage control at DC link, in a single-stage. The proposed PMBLDCM drive is designed, modeled and its performance is evaluated in Matlab-Simulink environment for an air conditioner (Air-Con) load. The speed of the compressor is controlled for efficient operation of the Air-Con which results in controlling {{the temperature in the}} conditioned area at the set point, effectively. Obtained results are presented to demonstrate an improved power quality of PFC converter based PMBLDCM drive in wide range of the speed control...|$|R

40|$|Aims: General aim; to {{investigate}} whether tailored evidence-based drug information provided to general practitioners can be implemented more effectively than evidence-based drug information provided as usual. Specific aims; to describe general practitioners’ (GPs) thoughts on prescribing medication and evidence-based drug information: to explore GPs’ attitudes on drug information: {{to investigate}} whether tailored evidence-based drug information can influence these attitudes differently or the prescribing behaviour more effectively than drug information provided as usual. Methods: Focus-group interviews with a descriptive qualitative approach (I), a cross sectional survey using an attitude questionnaire analysed in a <b>multilevel</b> <b>mode</b> and by multiple logistic regression (II), and a randomised controlled study (RCTs, III and IV) were used. In the two latter medical information officers (MIOs) providing drug information to GPs were matched pair-wise and randomised into intervention or control groups. The GPs were cluster randomised by their MIOs. The intervention MIOs were trained to provide evidence-based drug information tailored with motivational interviewing and {{to focus on the}} benefit aspect. The control MIOs provided evidence-based drug information as usual. Data was collected by an attitude questionnaire (III), analysed by the Mann-Whitney test and intention-to-treat. Prescriptions for antihypertensive drugs were collected (IV). The change in proportion of ACE inhibitor prescriptions relative to the sum of ACE inhibitors and Angiotensin II receptor blockers, during 0 – 3 and 4 – 6 months after the intervention, was analysed with multiple linear regression, by intention-to-treat and per protocol. Results: GPs thoughts on prescribing medication and on evidence-based medicine dealt much with benefit. The core category ‘prompt and pragmatic benefit’ was the utmost benefit (I). A majority of the GPs perceived the information from the industry as too excessive; that the main task of the industry was to promote sales. The quality of public information was regarded as high and useful. Female GPs valued public information to a much greater extent than did male GPs (II). The changes in attitudes to drug information did not differ between the two groups (III). Information was given to 29 % of GPs in both groups (IV). The GPs’ average change in proportion of prescribed ACE inhibitors increased in both groups after the intervention. General conclusions and implications: GPs’ thoughts on evidence-based drug information and prescribing medication relates predominantly to ‘prompt and pragmatic benefit’; delivered immediately, useful and handy. Female GPs valued public drug information much more than male GPs did, which might be useful to know in future implementation. GPs’ attitudes on drug information did not differ between the groups after the intervention. Neither did the change in proportion of prescribed ACE inhibitors differ. This indicates no benefit in using tailored evidence-based drug information compared to drug information provided as usual...|$|E

40|$|A simple {{analytical}} {{model of the}} mass-transport during the initial stage of Ge wetting layer formation on Si(l 11) is developed. The model considers growth of the multilevel Ge islands observed in recent STM studies as evolution of pyramids with two bilayer thickness. The pyramid steps flow together and, as a result, the multilevel island forms if there exists an upward transport of adatoms from the substrate surface {{to the top of}} the pyramid. The necessary condition for this is that the step at the pyramid base is permeable for the adatoms (the adatoms with greater probability climb up the step than incorporate into it). The explicit expressions for the step permeability and incorporation coefficients are obtained. It is shown that decreasing step permeability is responsible for the transition from <b>multilevel</b> growth <b>mode</b> to the layer-by-layer formation of the wetting layer which has been observed under the increasing deposition rate or/and decreasing growth temperature.

40|$|The problem {{considered}} {{here is that}} {{of managing}} and controlling the industrial system to achieve efficient performance. Emphasis is placed on structuring the decision making and control functions, {{taking into account the}} fact that the production process runs continuously with no starting or end point, and undergoes major changes in product specifications, quality requirements, equipment characteristics, resource availability, and the like. Since all these changes are time functions, the time factor plays a very important role in decision making and control and in functional structuring. It is shown that the functional structure is a <b>multilevel</b> hierarchical <b>mode</b> with horizontal and vertical decomposition planes. The vertical planes represent temporal decomposition, reflecting the subordination of decision making and control for each time duration or time horizon. The horizontal planes form layers related to each time horizon and consist of the set of decomposed subproblems to be solved in coordinated mode.

An observer based on adaptive backstepping approach is used for capacitor voltages estimation. It is assumed that capacitance value of the DC-link capacitors are unknown. The state estimates are employed for a sliding mode controller to achieve not only the precise current control but also to obtain well behavior {{in the case of}} capacitor voltage balancing. In practical, it results attracting to evaluate the possibility of reducing the number of sensors, or even using these soft sensors as redundant for fault tolerant purposes. The nonlinear observer stability study based on the Lyapunov theory guarantees the stability and convergence of the estimated quantities.

The present research investigates the factors that affect the declared frequency of drink-riding among motorcyclists in Europe and explores regional differences. Data were collected from the SARTRE- 4 (Social Attitudes to Road Traffic Risk in Europe) survey, which was conducted in 19 countries. A total sample of 4483 motorcyclists was interviewed by using a face-to-face questionnaire. The data were analyzed by means of multilevel ordered logit models.

40|$|The paper {{intends to}} {{contribute}} to a more differentiated comparative analysis of the democratic problem in multilevel governance. Usually, the debate in this field is focussed on policy-making in negotiations. As to this, we should distinguish between multilateral negotiations among central and lower-level governments (joint decision-making) and governance in a series of bilateral negotiations. What has so far been ignored in the debates on democracy and <b>multilevel</b> governance are <b>modes</b> of governance by competition. Again, at least two types should be distinguished: One is the standard model of fiscal federalism, which assumes that coordination is achieved through competition among governments for mobile tax payers. According to the other model, lower-level governments compete for best policies in a framework of standards or criteria for evaluation defined by central institutions or intergovernmental agreements. These types of multilevel governance are compared as to how they meet normative criteria of democratic legitimacy. Particular emphasis is put on the interplay between multilevel governance and intragovernmental patterns of democratic government. Empirical evidence is drawn from research on Germany, Canada and the EU, although the paper does not present a systematic comparative study. The aim is to broaden the perspective on multilevel governance by considering variations in modes of democracy and governance.

40|$|Information and {{collaboration}} patterns embedded in social networks play key roles in <b>multilevel</b> and polycentric <b>modes</b> of governance. However, modeling the dynamics of such social networks in multilevel settings has been seldom addressed in the literature. Here we use an adaptive social network model to elaborate the interplay between a central {{and a local}} government in order to maintain a polycentric governance. More specifically, our analysis explores in what ways specific policy choices made by a central agent affect the features of an emerging social network composed of local organizations and local users. Using two types of stylized policies, adaptive co-management and adaptive one-level management, we focus {{on the benefits of}} multi-level adaptive cooperation for network management. Our analysis uses viability theory to explore and to quantify the ability of these policies to achieve specific network properties. Viability theory gives the family of policies that enables maintaining the polycentric governance unlike optimal control that gives a unique blueprint. We found that the viability of the policies can change dramatically depending on the goals and features of the social network. For some social networks, we also found a very large difference between the viability of the adaptive one-level management and adaptive co-management policies. However, results also show that adaptive co-management doesn’t always provide benefits. Hence, we argue that applying viability theory to governance networks can help policy design by analyzing the trade-off between the costs of adaptive co-management and the benefits associated with its ability to maintain desirable social network properties in a polycentric governance framework...|$|R
