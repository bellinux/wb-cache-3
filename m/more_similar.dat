5|$|A {{study on}} the fully aquatic Archegosaurus shows that it's heat balance, gas exchange, osmoregulation, and {{digestion}} were <b>more</b> <b>similar</b> to those of fish than those of modern aquatic amphibians like salamanders.|$|E
5|$|The three known {{species of}} vampire bats all seem <b>more</b> <b>similar</b> {{to one another}} than to any other species. That {{suggests}} that sanguivorous habits (feeding on blood) evolved only once, and the three species share a common ancestor.|$|E
5|$|The trends {{going down}} from {{scandium}} and yttrium to lanthanum {{tend to be}} <b>more</b> <b>similar</b> to those going down groups 1 and 2 in the periodic table, while those going down from scandium and yttrium to lutetium tend to be <b>more</b> <b>similar</b> {{to those in the}} early transition metals. Since Sc3+, Y3+, and La3+ still have a low enough charge for their compounds to be predominantly ionic, unlike Ti4+, Zr4+, and Hf4+, {{it has been argued that}} lanthanum and the rest of group 3 should be considered at best atypical transition metals, as their chemistry is focused on the predominantly ionic +3 state and they have a low ability to form coordination compounds or organometallic compounds. Indeed, lanthanum is a strongly electropositive metal, comparable to calcium in electropositivity. The rare earth metals in general are <b>more</b> <b>similar</b> in reactivity to the alkaline earth metals that immediately precede them than to the transition metals proper which follow them.|$|E

5|$|Woese {{used his}} new rRNA {{comparison}} method to categorize and contrast different organisms. He sequenced {{a variety of}} different species and happened upon a group of methanogens that had vastly different patterns than any known prokaryotes or eukaryotes. These methanogens were much <b>more</b> <b>similar</b> to each other than they were to other organisms sequenced, leading Woese to propose the new domain of Archaea. His experiments showed that the Archaea were <b>more</b> <b>similar</b> to eukaryotes than prokaryotes, even though they were <b>more</b> <b>similar</b> to prokaryotes in structure. This led to the conclusion that Archaea and Eukarya shared a more recent common ancestor than Eukarya and Bacteria in general. The development of the nucleus occurred after the split between Bacteria and this common ancestor. Although Archaea are prokaryotic, they are more closely related to Eukarya and thus cannot be placed within either the Bacteria or Eukarya domains.|$|E
5|$|Cricket is <b>more</b> <b>similar</b> to {{baseball}} {{than many other}} team sports in this regard: while the individual focus in cricket is mitigated by {{the importance of the}} batting partnership and the practicalities of tandem running, it is enhanced by the fact that a batsman may occupy the wicket for an hour or much more. There is no statistical equivalent in cricket for the fielding error and thus less emphasis on personal responsibility in this area of play.|$|E
5|$|Even <b>more</b> <b>similar</b> is {{the very}} rare Lactarius semisanguifluus. Its milk also discolours within 5 to 8minutes to maroon. The cap of older fruit bodies is nearly {{completely}} greenish. It is also common under pines. The most similar and also the most closely related fungus is Lactarius fennoscandicus, a boreal to subalpine species. Its cap is distinctly zoned and brown-orange. Sometimes the cap has purple-grey tones. The stem is pale to blunt orange-ochre.|$|E
50|$|It has a {{foldable}} {{design that}} allows the drone to be transported <b>more</b> easily, <b>similar</b> to the GoPro Karma.|$|R
50|$|The {{most common}} Anglican design can {{be similar to}} the Catholic zucchetto or, far <b>more</b> often, <b>similar</b> to the Jewish yarmulke.|$|R
50|$|It {{is often}} {{asserted}} that orthologs are <b>more</b> functionally <b>similar</b> than paralogs of similar divergence, but several papers have challenged this notion.|$|R
5|$|Immature {{insects that}} go through {{incomplete}} metamorphosis are called nymphs {{or in the}} case of dragonflies and damselflies, also naiads. Nymphs are similar in form to the adult except for the presence of wings, which are not developed until adulthood. With each molt, nymphs grow larger and become <b>more</b> <b>similar</b> in appearance to adult insects.|$|E
5|$|Immature red wattlebirds are {{generally}} less flamboyant. Juveniles have much less prominent wattles, brown irises, a pale crown {{and much less}} yellow on the belly. They moult into first immature plumage {{within a few months}} of leaving the nest. First immature birds are <b>more</b> <b>similar</b> to adults overall, having red irises with brown rings, wattles larger but still smaller than adults, and a greyish pink gape.|$|E
5|$|In 1976, it was {{suggested}} that the brolga, sarus crane (Antigone antigone) and white-naped crane (Antigone vipio) formed a natural group on the basis of similarities in their calls. This was further confirmed by molecular studies of their DNA. These also showed that the brolga is more closely related to the white-naped crane than it is to the morphologically <b>more</b> <b>similar</b> sarus crane.|$|E
50|$|The {{sound is}} similar to a glockenspiel, but with much <b>more</b> sustain, <b>similar</b> in this respect to a vibraphone but without the vibrato.|$|R

5|$|In a 2017 paper, Gwee {{and colleagues}} found that boobook populations on larger mountainous islands were more {{distinct}} from Australian stock, while those on flatter smaller islands were much <b>more</b> <b>similar,</b> suggesting that these locations were colonised much more recently after previous populations had become extinct.|$|E
5|$|In {{producing}} the English dub {{version of the}} series, Media Blasters chose Lex Lang as Sanosuke's voice actor. When writing Sanosuke's dialogue, Clark Cheng, the writer of the English dub script, noted that the character was smarter {{than he would have}} liked in the first few episodes, so Cheng tried slowly to change the character's dialogue to make Sanosuke seem less intelligent so he would be <b>more</b> <b>similar</b> to the equivalent in the Japanese version of the series.|$|E
5|$|It was {{determined}} that P. rebeli larvae use chemical mimicry to persuade the M. schencki ants that the P. rebeli {{are part of the}} ant brood. Furthermore, M. schencki ants cannot distinguish the physical differences between the P. rebeli larvae and other non-kin brood because the P. rebeli larvae are far <b>more</b> <b>similar</b> to the M. schencki larvae than to any other ant species larvae.|$|E

5|$|Many abelisaurid skull {{features}} are shared with carcharodontosaurids. These shared features, {{along with the}} fact that abelisaurids seem to have replaced carcharodontosaurids in South America, have led to suggestions that the two groups were related. However, no cladistic analysis has ever found such a relationship and, aside from the skull, abelisaurids and carcharodontosaurids are very different, <b>more</b> <b>similar</b> to ceratosaurs and allosauroids, respectively.|$|E
5|$|Neptunium {{is found}} {{in at least three}} allotropes. Some claims of a fourth allotrope have been made, but they are so far not proven. This {{multiplicity}} of allotropes is common among the actinides. The crystal structures of neptunium, protactinium, uranium, and plutonium do not have clear analogs among the lanthanides and are <b>more</b> <b>similar</b> to those of the 3dtransition metals.|$|E
5|$|Ninox boobook remigialis {{is found}} on the Kai Islands in the Lesser Sunda Islands. Stresemann {{described}} it in 1930 from a specimen collected in 1909. Poorly known, it has been recorded twice more in 1998 and 2010. It has a call <b>more</b> <b>similar</b> to the barking owl, and might be classified as a subspecies of it instead.|$|E

5|$|Tamazight is in {{the middle}} of a dialect {{continuum}} between Riff to its north-east and Shilha to its south-west. The basic lexicon of Tamazight differs markedly from Shilha, and its verbal system is <b>more</b> <b>similar</b> to Riff or Kabyle. Moreover, Tamazight has a greater amount of internal diversity than Shilha.|$|E
5|$|The {{alkali metals}} are <b>more</b> <b>similar</b> {{to each other}} than the {{elements}} in any other group are to each other. For instance, when moving down the table, all known alkali metals show increasing atomic radius, decreasing electronegativity, increasing reactivity, and decreasing melting and boiling points as well as heats of fusion and vaporisation. In general, their densities increase when moving down the table, with the exception that potassium is less dense than sodium.|$|E
5|$|The {{middle toe}} of the California condor's foot is greatly elongated, and the hind one is only {{slightly}} developed. The talons of all the toes are straight and blunt, and are thus more adapted to walking than gripping. This is <b>more</b> <b>similar</b> to their supposed relatives the storks than to birds of prey and Old World vultures, which use their feet as weapons or organs of prehension.|$|E
