5000|$|The term myeloid ( [...] + [...] ) is an {{adjective}} {{that in its}} broadest sense {{means either}} [...] "resembling bone marrow" [...] or [...] "pertaining to bone marrow", and the related adjective myelogenous (myelo- + [...] ) means [...] "arising from bone marrow". In hematopoiesis, both terms refer to blood cells that arise from a progenitor cell for granulocytes, monocytes, erythrocytes, or platelets (the common myeloid progenitor or CMP) and often even more specifically to the lineage of the myeloblast (the myelocytes, monocytes, and their daughter types); thus, although all blood cells, even lymphocytes, are born in the bone marrow, myeloid cells in the narrowest {{sense of the term}} can be distinguished from lymphoid cells, that is, lymphocytes, which come from common lymphoid progenitor cells (CLPs) that give rise to B cells and T cells. Those cells' differentiation (that is, lymphopoiesis) is not complete until they migrate to lymphatic organs such as the spleen and thymus for programming by antigen challenge. Thus, among leukocytes, the term myeloid is associated with the innate immune system, in contrast to lymphoid, which is associated with the adaptive immune system. Similarly, myelogenous usually refers to nonlymphocytic white blood cells, and erythroid can often be used to distinguish [...] "erythrocyte-related" [...] from that sense of myeloid and from lymphoid. The word <b>myelopoiesis</b> has several senses in a way that parallels those of myeloid, and <b>myelopoiesis</b> in the narrower sense is the regulated formation specifically of myeloid leukocytes (myelocytes), allowing that sense of <b>myelopoiesis</b> to be contradistinguished from erythropoiesis and lymphopoiesis (even though all blood cells are produced in the marrow).|$|E

This study aimed at investigating the genomic expression during myeloid differentiation through a computational approach that integrates gene expression profiles with functional information and genome organization. Results Gene expression data from 24 experiments for 8 different cell types of the human myelopoietic lineage were used to generate an integrated <b>myelopoiesis</b> dataset of 9, 425 genes, each reliably associated to a unique genomic position and chromosomal coordinate.

Then, the genomic distribution of <b>myelopoiesis</b> genes was investigated integrating transcriptional and functional characteristics of genes.

Here, we report the isolation of the earliest myeloid-restricted progenitors in acute infection with the rodent malaria parasite, Plasmodium chabaudi. The rapid disappearance of these infection-induced myeloid progenitors from the bone marrow (BM) equated with contraction of the functional myeloid potential in that organ. The loss of BM <b>myelopoiesis</b> was not affected by the complete genetic inactivation of toll-like receptor signaling. De-activation of IFN-γ signaling completely abrogated the contraction of BM myeloid progenitors. Radiation chimeras of Ifngr 1 -null and control BM revealed that IFN-γ signaling in an irradiation-resistant stromal compartment was crucial for the loss of early myeloid progenitors. Systemic IFN-γ triggered the secretion of C-C motif ligand chemokines CCL 2 and CCL 7 leading to the egress of early, myeloid-committed progenitors from the bone marrow mediated by their common receptor CCR 2. The mobilization of myeloid progenitors initiated extramedullary <b>myelopoiesis</b> in the spleen in a CCR 2 -dependent manner resulting in augmented <b>myelopoiesis</b> during acute malaria. Consistent with the lack of splenic <b>myelopoiesis</b> in the absence of CCR 2 we observed a significant persistence of parasitemia in malaria infected CCR 2 -deficient hosts.

Furthermore, LPS-induced emergency <b>myelopoiesis</b> is independent of intact IL- 1 RI signaling and, thus, does not require inflammasome activation.

By contrast, fucosylation-deficient myeloid progenitors are insensitive to the suppressive effects of Notch ligands on <b>myelopoiesis,</b> do not transcribe Notch 1 target genes when cocultured with Notch ligands, and have lost the wild-type Notch ligand-binding phenotype.
