40|$|Abstract. Electrochemical {{polishing}} (ECP) is {{a promising}} approach to finishing surface to achieve {{high quality of}} surface. However, it cannot satisfy requirements of <b>mirror</b> <b>finishing</b> yet. In this paper, a <b>mirror</b> <b>finishing</b> method for cold rolling rollers is proposed. The whole process of the surface finishing {{can be divided into}} two phases: electrochemical polishing and mechanical grinding. An anodic film is formed exception for anodic dissolution during ECP. A small amount of the anodic film and metal material are removed by abrasive paper in mechanical grinding. Activated metal surface is exposed again and dissolved in electrochemical reaction after mechanical grinding. Residual of anodic film protects rollers. It is a cyclic process of <b>mirror</b> <b>finishing.</b> Experimental results showed that a <b>mirror</b> <b>finishing</b> surface of up to Ra 0. 02 - 0. 05 µm can be obtained by using this method and that it is effective and efficient...|$|R

40|$|Concentrated {{solar power}} (CSP) is a fast {{forwarding}} technology {{in power generation}} sector because of its’ competitive price, abundance in nature {{and the most important}} fact is its’ energy storage capability. Among the four types of available CSP technology, central receiver has more potential concerning with high temperature, power block efficiency and levelized cost of energy (LCOE). Other than conventional type of receiver design, the concept of this work is very particular in a sense of its design novelty. National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) {{come up with a new}} concept of high temperature solar receiver called near black body (NBB) receiver. This receiver design requires high specular reflective surface in its’ front section at operating temperature 150 C. High specular reflective surface refers to <b>mirror</b> <b>finished</b> surface. However, this specular reflective surface application is for high temperature solar receiver, the surface needs to be durable from thermal cycling, oxidation and environmental effect. This <b>mirror</b> <b>finished</b> specular surface helps to penetrate the sunlight inside the hollow tube and hence increase receiver’s efficiency. But at such operating temperature and environmental condition, optical properties degradation rate is high. So to protect this mirror surface a thin layer of SiO 2 has been deposited by sol-gel method on top of electroplated silver coating. To obtain a rigid thin film structure, sol-gel procedure has been tested extensively by varying most dominant sol-gel parameters. Endurance test has been performed in the furnace at 150 C for 1000 hours. ...|$|E

These data yielded Nusselt number as a function of Grashof number or Rayleigh number. All of these were then compared with the data obtained by O'Connor [Ref. 3]. Experimental results are presented for the heat transfer from horizontal circular disks, with and without artificial cavities. The data from a <b>mirror</b> <b>finished</b> surface was compared to that of previous investigations and the agreement was good.

The test section was designed to insure a one dimensional heat flux. Measurements were taken with power inputs varying from 25 to 5 watts. Fluid depth had a definite effect on the heat transfer. An apparent maximum value existed at a ratio of enclosure radius to fluid depth of one. Comparison of the data with existing correlation however, was poor which led to the questioning of the validity of the assumed one dimensional heat flux. Use of a finite element computer program demonstrated that two dimensional effects were important. Subsequent modification of the hear transfer coefficient to account for this variation gave a correlation more in agreement with those existing in the literature.

Corrosion resistance of the anodized sample is comparable with that of the untreated samples...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. One of {{the major}} {{technological}} parameters in metal cutting is surface roughness. It is an unavoidable, and often, unwanted by-product of all machining operations, especially end milling. Surface roughness {{is directly related to}} product quality and performance, operation cost, machining accuracy, and chatter. Today’s stringent customer requirements demand machined parts with minimum (<b>mirror</b> <b>finished)</b> products. Hence, the prediction, modeling, and optimization of surface roughness is a quintessential concern in machining research and industrial endeavor. This research was undertaken in order to determine whether end milling of medium carbon steel performed using chosen ranges of cutting parameter and under magnetic field generated by permanent magnets could effectively improve surface roughness. A small central composite design with five levels and an alpha value of 1. 4142, in Response Surface Methodology, was used in developing the relationship between cutting speed, feed, and depth of cut, with surface roughness. Design-Expert 6. 0 software was utilized to develop the quadratic empirical mathematical model for surface roughness. The experiments were performed under two different conditions. The first condition was cutting under normal conditions, while the other one was cutting under the application of magnetic fields from two permanent magnets. Medium carbon steel was used as the work material. The resultant average surface roughness was found to be reduced by a maximum of 59 % due to magnet application...|$|E
40|$|Windows and facade systems {{combining}} {{solar control}} glazing with indoor Venetian blinds {{can be a}} very effective strategy to provide thermal and visual comfort. The solar factor of such systems strongly depends on the blind tilt angle and on the relative angular positions of the Sun in respect to the window. In the present paper a modified version of Tilmann E. Kuhn model for the complete angular determination of the solar factor is presented and discussed. The new version was developed {{in order to avoid the}} need for measured angular glazing properties and of calorimetric measurements of the solar factor for the window system, which were data required in the original version. This implementation has been carried out by means of a suitable extension of Arne Roos glazing angular variation model and by using the J. L. J. Roosenfeld's approach for complex systems. Moreover a three spectral band reformulation in place of broadband formulation has been introduced to improve the a ccuracy of the new version. An experimental angular characterisation of the solar factor has been carried out on a case study adopting <b>mirror</b> <b>finished</b> blinds. The analysis of the results shows that: in the new fully predictive approach the accuracy improvement of adopting a three-band formulation can be significant; the implemented version still ensures a good agreement with measured values, at least for this case study, with no need of angular data as input...|$|E

Heart rate variability (HRV) and heart rate were used as indicators of autonomic nervous activity. The high-frequency (HF) component of HRV, which reflects parasympathetic nervous activity, and the low-frequency (LF) /HF ratio, which reflects sympathetic nervous activity, were measured.
