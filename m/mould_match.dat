5000|$|Prussian blue {{is widely}} used by tool makers when the core and cavity of a <b>mould</b> is <b>matched</b> during final assembly. It is also used in other tooling applications—especially during assembly—such as {{stamping}} tools and pressure die casting tools. A thin coating of Prussian blue is applied (usually with a paint brush) on the [...] "insert"—regardless of the shape or contour—of the mould or tool before the matching is done with the mating part. If the Prussian blue (generally called as just [...] "blue") appears evenly on the mating area, it is considered—by the tool makers—as [...] "good matching" [...] and thus expecting a good final product from the tool. Usually no tool would be transferred to testing or production without [...] "blue matching", a term generally used by the tool makers in Asia. In other words, Prussian blue is considered {{as an integral part}} of precision tool making.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Sensors {{deployed}} in natural environments, such as rivers, beaches and glaciers, experience large forces and damaging environmental conditions. Sensors {{need to be}} robust, securely operate for extended time periods and be readily relocated and serviced. The sensors must be housed in materials that mimic natural conditions of size, density, shape and roughness. We have developed an encasement system for sensors required to measure large forces experienced by mobile river sediment grains. Sensors are housed within two discrete cases that are rigidly conjoined. The inner case exactly fits the sensor, radio components and power source. This case can be mounted within outer cases of any larger size and can be precisely <b>moulded</b> to <b>match</b> the shapes of natural sediment. Total grain mass can be controlled by packing the outer case with dense material. Case design uses Solid-WorksTM software, and shape-matching involved 3 D laser scanning of natural pebbles. The cases were printed using a HP DesignjetTM 3 D printer that generates high precision parts that lock rigidly in place. The casings are watertight and robust. Laboratory testing produces accurate results over {{a wider range of}} accelerations than previously reported...|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to infecting the skin, tzaraath {{is described by}} the priestly code as being able to infect historically common clothing fabrics, specifically wool, linen, and leather. The Biblical description of tzaraath in such fabrics is strikingly analogous to that of tzaraath in the skin, with, for example, spreading of the infection being tested for by isolating the fabric in question for first 7 days. The principal symptoms are described as being very green or very red spots, which spread within a week, or that don't change appearance at all after a fortnight, having been washed after the first week, or that return a week after having been torn out, if they also had faded with washing prior to being torn out. These descriptions are regarded by scholars as most probably indicative of certain <b>moulds,</b> and especially <b>matching</b> infections by Penicillium (the fungus that produces penicillin).|$|R
50|$|The {{plan of the}} two-storey part of {{the house}} is {{repeated}} on the two levels. A central, T-shaped hall provides access to the five main rooms and a decorative timber switch back stair with decorative turned balustrade and carved newel post finial provides vertical circulation. Generally, the interior walls are plaster with timber skirtings, timber architraves, and plaster cornices, all moulded. The floors and ceilings are timber boards. Internal doors are timber with four panels with bolection moulding and glazed horizontal-pivoting fanlights. The six fireplaces have moulded timber mantelpieces and metal fire surrounds and either a metal grate or stove. A timber partition of horizontal beaded boards divides the northern rooms on the upper level and this wall in the lower level contains large folding door with six panels with bolection <b>moulding</b> and <b>matching</b> timber panelling above the opening. The ceilings on the ground floor rooms are 4.2 m high with those of the first floor being 3.7 m high. The house contains cedar joinery throughout. The house contains much furniture and paintings brought into the house by the current owners. An octagonal side table and two framed paintings are in the dining room and may have been owned by the Aldridges. The Aldridge Collection is held by the Maryborough Military and Colonial Museum and contains domestic items donated to the museum {{by a member of the}} Aldridge family. It may give providence for the side table and paintings and also evidence of the domestic history of Baddow House.|$|R
40|$|A {{geometrical}} modelling {{scheme is}} presented to produce representative architectures for discontinuous fibre composites, enabling downstream modelling of mechanical properties. The model generates realistic random fibre architectures containing high filament count bundles (> 3 k) and high (~ 50 %) fibre volume fractions. Fibre bundles are modelled as thin shells using a multi-dimension modelling strategy, in which fibre bundles are distributed and compacted to simulate pressure being applied from a <b>matched</b> <b>mould</b> tool. FE simulations are performed to benchmark the in-plane mechanical properties obtained from the numerical model against experimental data, with a detailed study presented to evaluate the tensile properties at various fibre volume fractions and specimen thicknesses. Tensile modulus predictions are in close agreement (less than 5 % error) with experimental data at volume fractions below 45 %. Ultimate tensile strength predictions are within 4. 2 % of the experimental data at volume fractions between 40 %- 55 %. This is a significant improvement over existing 2 D modelling approaches, as the current model offers increased levels of fidelity, capturing dominant failure mechanisms {{and the influence of}} out-of-plane fibres...|$|R
500|$|Shakespeare uses {{a variety}} of poetic forms {{throughout}} the play. He begins with a 14-line prologue {{in the form of}} a Shakespearean sonnet, spoken by a Chorus. Most of Romeo and Juliet is, however, written in blank verse, and much of it in strict iambic pentameter, with less rhythmic variation than in most of Shakespeare's later plays. In choosing forms, Shakespeare matches the poetry to the character who uses it. Friar Laurence, for example, uses sermon and sententiae forms, and the Nurse uses a unique blank verse form that closely matches colloquial speech. Each of these forms is also <b>moulded</b> and <b>matched</b> to the emotion of the scene the character occupies. For example, when Romeo talks about Rosaline earlier in the play, he attempts to use the Petrarchan sonnet form. Petrarchan sonnets were often used by men to exaggerate the beauty of women who were impossible for them to attain, as in Romeo's situation with Rosaline. This sonnet form is used by Lady Capulet to describe Count Paris to Juliet as a handsome man. When Romeo and Juliet meet, the poetic form changes from the Petrarchan (which was becoming archaic in Shakespeare's day) to a then more contemporary sonnet form, using [...] "pilgrims" [...] and [...] "saints" [...] as metaphors. Finally, when the two meet on the balcony, Romeo attempts to use the sonnet form to pledge his love, but Juliet breaks it by saying [...] "Dost thou love me?" [...] By doing this, she searches for true expression, rather than a poetic exaggeration of their love. Juliet uses monosyllabic words with Romeo but uses formal language with Paris. Other forms in the play include an epithalamium by Juliet, a rhapsody in Mercutio's Queen Mab speech, and an elegy by Paris. Shakespeare saves his prose style most often for the common people in the play, though at times he uses it for other characters, such as Mercutio. Humour, also, is important: scholar Molly Mahood identifies at least 175 puns and wordplays in the text. Many of these jokes are sexual in nature, especially those involving Mercutio and the Nurse.|$|R
40|$|A numerical/experimental {{procedure}} is proposed for calculating the residual stress state during the cooling {{phase of the}} casting process of a superduplex stainless steel (ASTM A 890 Gr. 5 A). The experimental activity consisted of casting, tensile and creep tests. Casting tests were used to set (by acquiring temperature data at different points) and validate (by measuring displacements after releasing residual stresses by cutting) the Finite Element model. Tensile and creep tests {{were used to determine}} the material properties from room temperature to 1200 °C. A fully coupled thermo-mechanical analysis was conducted by neglecting the presence of the sand mould; instead, attention was focused on the material by modelling the creep behaviour using the Bailey-Norton formulation. Measurements of the of the displacements due to the stress release after EDM wire cuts revealed to be in good agreement with the numerical model and confirmed the key role played by viscosity during the cooling phase. Neglecting the viscous strain led to an overestimation (more than twofold) of the stress level in the cast part after the cooling phase in the sand <b>mould.</b> The good <b>matching</b> between experimental and numerical data indicated that a numerical model that incorporates the creep behaviour is able to accurately capture the investigated phenomenon, despite the simplification in the modelling of the casting process (sand mould replaced with virtual convection) which does not substantially affect its accuracy. The robustness of the methodology, which is characterized by small computational cost and good quality of results, was further proved simulating and comparing numerical and experimental results concerning a second casting geometry...|$|R
40|$|In {{recent years}} {{interest}} {{has grown in}} the use of composite components within the automotive industry. Fibre reinforced plastic (FRP) components are of particular interest to the industry, since lower tooling costs and part consolidation can be utilised, whilst lighter, stiffer components can be produced. Several methods are available to produce FRP components at high volumes, including compression moulding (using dough and sheet moulding compounds), reinforced reaction injection moulding (RRIM) and liquid moulding processes (resin transfer moulding (RTM) and structural reaction injection moulding (SRIM)). RTM is a closed mould process, which is widely used to produce components economically in low volumes using <b>matched</b> <b>moulds</b> to produce two good surfaces. The absence of a high volume manufacturing technology, however, has impeded the acceptance and advance of RTM within the automotive industry. A research programme was established at the University of Nottingham to address the problems {{associated with the use of}} RTM for high volume manufacture. This programme has considered the topics of process technology, processing characteristics of polyester resin systems and fibre preforms, fibre wet-out and interfacial bonding, mould design, microwave pre-heating of reactive resin systems and process modelling. This thesis concerns the research which was undertaken to identify the causes of void formation during the impregnation and polymerisation stages of RTM, and methods of reducing the final void content within the component. The impregnation phase of the RTM process was identified as being the stage where the majority of voids were formed. A study of oil impregnation (having a similar viscosity to that of resin) into reinforcement was undertaken to determine the reasons for uneven flow and air entrapment. The dry reinforcements were studied to assess the microstructure of the preforms in order to determine reasons for obstruction of the resin flow. Fabric stitching, thermoplastic binder and size deposits were identified as potential causes of flow impediment. Fibre orientation and preform stacking were also assumed to assist in the development of uneven flow, leading to air entrapment. A major factor determining the formation of microvoids within fibre bundles was identified as the transverse impregnation of resin into high Tex fibre bundles. The major moulding process variables of injection pressure, vent pressure, fibre volume fraction, mould temperature and resin pre-heating have been assessed, to determine their effect on the void content within unidirectional and CFRM reinforced polyester laminates. It was observed that vacuum assistance during impregnation reduced void formation, although higher exotherm pressures and the possibility of monomer boiling arise from its use. A simple impregnation model was developed to assess the microscopic impregnation rates between fibre bundles, in the capillary between fibres and transversely into fibre bundles. The results from this model were compared with actual moulding histories. The findings of the overall work are discussed and suggestions proposed for the reduction of void content in RTM automotive components...|$|R
