5|$|At these speeds, it was {{expected}} that the B-70 would be almost immune to interceptor aircraft, the only effective weapon against bomber aircraft at the time. The bomber would spend only a few minutes over a particular radar station, flying out of its range before the controllers could position their fighters in a suitable location for an interception. High speed also made the aircraft difficult to see on radar displays and its high-altitude flight could not be <b>matched</b> <b>by</b> any contemporary Soviet fighter.|$|E

5|$|In July and August, Carlsen won the Biel Grandmaster Tournament with a 6/10 {{record and}} a PR of 2753.

In the first round, Carlsen conceded a draw to his classmate Brede Hagen (rated 2034) after having a lost position at one point. A game which attracted some attention was his sixth-round win over his father, Henrik Carlsen.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to their British counterparts, the French Navy {{was in a}} state of confusion. Although the quality of the fleet's ships was high, the fleet hierarchy was riven by the same crises that had torn through France since the Revolution five years earlier. Consequently, the high standard of ships and ordnance was not <b>matched</b> <b>by</b> that of the available crews, which were largely untrained and inexperienced. With the Terror resulting in the death or dismissal of many senior French sailors and officers, political appointees and conscripts – many of whom had never been to sea at all, let alone in a fighting vessel – filled the Atlantic fleet.|$|E

5|$|The Barra estates of MacNeil (including all the Barra Isles) {{were sold}} to Colonel John Gordon of Cluny Aberdeenshire in 1840 whose lack of {{consideration}} for his tenants during the potato famines was <b>matched</b> <b>by</b> his zeal for evictions to create sheep farms. However, the Highland Clearances {{seemed to have the}} effect of increasing Mingulay’s population as families evicted from Barra sometimes chose to re-settle there rather than take the emigrant ships to Nova Scotia. In this regard Mingulay's remoteness was probably an advantage and rents were actually reduced from 1840–45. In 1878 Lady Gordon Cathcart inherited the estate and visited but once during her fifty-four year period of tenure.|$|E
