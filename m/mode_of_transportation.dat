5|$|Horse rings, {{often made}} of iron or brass, are {{remnants}} from the 1800s, when horses, and horse-drawn vehicles, provided the primary <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> <b>transportation.</b> In 1978, The Register-Guard {{suggested that the}} rings might only be {{as old as the}} early 1900s. The rings allowed residents to tether their horses to sidewalks.|$|E
5|$|Cagney, born in 1899 (prior to {{widespread}} use of automobiles), loved horses from childhood. As a child, he often sat on the horses of local deliverymen, and rode in horse-drawn streetcars with his mother. As an adult, well after horses were replaced by automobiles as the primary <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> <b>transportation,</b> Cagney raised horses on his farms, specializing in Morgans, a breed {{of which he was}} particularly fond.|$|E
5|$|Horse rings, {{remnants}} {{of a time when}} horses and horse-drawn vehicles provided the primary <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> <b>transportation,</b> can be found throughout Portland, Oregon. They were removed from curbs and sidewalks for safety purposes until the late 1970s, when one Portland resident complained about the rings disappearing. Today, the city of Portland helps to preserve the rings by requiring them to be replaced following sidewalk construction or repair.|$|E
40|$|Since most <b>modes</b> <b>of</b> <b>transportation</b> rely on liquid energy {{carriers}} like gasoline or diesel, {{the approaching}} {{end of the}} fossil fuel era poses a special challenge. One should {{bear in mind that}} nothing matches the energy density of liquid fuels. It is, therefore, important to consider the efficiency <b>of</b> various <b>modes</b> <b>of</b> <b>transportation</b> and explore alternative options for energy carriers. This includes a feasibility study of the use of solar energy in transportation. In this perspective various <b>modes</b> <b>of</b> <b>transportation</b> are briefly reviewed and the possible alternative energy carriers assessed...|$|R

5|$|The League of American Bicyclists has rated Colorado as {{the sixth}} most bicycle-friendly {{state in the}} nation for the year 2014. This is {{due in large part to}} Front Range cities like Boulder, Fort Collins and Denver placing an {{emphasis}} on legislation, programs and infrastructure developments that promote cycling as a <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> <b>transportation.</b> Walk score has rated Denver as the third most bicycle-friendly large city in the United States.|$|E
5|$|This <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> <b>transportation</b> links national, {{international}} and global economies, making it vital {{to many other}} industries. Newer trends of liberalization of trade have fostered routes among nations bound by agreements. One such example, the American Open Skies policy, led to greater openness in many international markets, but some international restrictions have survived even during the present times.|$|E
5|$|In this period, steamships on rivers {{such as the}} Ohio and Mississippi {{or large}} inland bodies of water such as the Great Lakes and the Chesapeake Bay offered a {{comfortable}} and relatively fast <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> <b>transportation.</b> The first steamboat to serve Baltimore was the locally built Chesapeake, constructed in 1813 to link Baltimore with Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Operated by the Union Line, the boat connected with a stagecoach for the overland portion of the journey. Two years later, the Briscoe-Partridge Line's Eagle was the first steamboat to sail the length of Chesapeake Bay.|$|E

5|$|There are daily express trains {{connecting}} {{major cities}} in Tamil Nadu like Chennai, Madurai, Trichy and Coimbatore. There are weekly express trains connecting Coimbatore, Varanasi and Bhubaneswar. Passenger trains ply from Rameswaram to Madurai and Trichy daily, making railways {{as the major}} <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> <b>transportation.</b> The Ramanathapuram â€“ Rameswaram National Highway is the main connecting link from Rameswaram to the mainland. Prior to the 1914 train service linking the mainland with Rameswaram, boats were the only mode of transport to Rameswaram island.|$|E
5|$|Today, {{the primary}} <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> <b>transportation</b> in Omaha is by automobile, with I-80, I-480, I-680, I-29, and U.S. Route 75 (JFK Freeway and North Freeway) {{providing}} freeway service across the metropolitan area. The expressway along West Dodge Road (U.S. Route 6 and Nebraska Link 28B) and U.S. Route 275 has been upgraded to freeway standards from I-680 to Fremont.

5|$|A {{railroad}} {{was being}} built {{and the population}} of Quorn hoped that it would go through the village {{on its way to}} Sioux City, Iowa. However, the railroad did not go through Quorn. One of the many ideas about why the railroad took a different route was due to a disagreement between the Chicago and North Western Transportation Company and the Close brothers. The actual reason is still unknown. Due to the railroad being the main <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> <b>transportation</b> of goods, the villagers {{had no choice but to}} relocate to a new area. Every business except for a mill was moved to a new area during 1883.|$|E

5|$|After {{a catastrophic}} flood in 1889, the Johnstown Inclined Plane was {{completed}} in 1891 {{to serve as an}} escape route for future floods, as well as a convenient <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> <b>transportation</b> for the residents of the new communities situated above the valley. It was operated by Cambria Iron Company and its successor Bethlehem Steel until 1935, when it was sold to the borough of Westmont. The incline was briefly shut down in 1962 when its supply of power from Bethlehem Steel was terminated. Twice in its history, the Johnstown Inclined Plane fulfilled its role as a means of evacuation from floodsonce in 1936 and again in 1977. The incline was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973 and was designated a Historic Mechanical Engineering Landmark in 1994. It had major renovations in 1962 and from 1983 to 1984.|$|E
5|$|Gummi Ships {{are another}} common {{element of the}} series, which serve as the main <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> <b>transportation</b> between worlds in the games. The {{gameplay}} for the Gummi Ship sections is more akin to a rail shooter. Because it received negative criticism in the first game, it was modified in the third title. Most games also feature a journal which is accessible from the main menu. This journal keeps track of information regarding the story, characters, enemies, and locations. In the first three games, the journal is kept by Jiminy Cricket, who was appointed by Queen Minnie as the royal chronicler. In 358/2 Days, Birth by Sleep and Dream Drop Distance, the main characters write their own journal entries.|$|E
5|$|The player's primary <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> <b>transportation</b> is a {{starship}} {{which serves}} as Shepard's base of operations. Aboard the ship, the player can interact with the squad members, customize the player's armor, travel to numerous planetary systems, and scan planets for mineral resources. These resources allow the player to research numerous in-game upgrades that {{are found in the}} missions, providing benefits such as increasing weapon damage, fortifying the player's health, or extending the ship's fuel capacity, among others. Scanning requires the player to move a reticle over a planet and launch a probe when an oscilloscope warns of near resources. Additional upgrades, equipment, and nonessential items such as magazines and decorations for the ship can be purchased from merchants in settlements.|$|E

5|$|Sea {{transportation}} {{is the primary}} <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> <b>transportation</b> linking Romblon with Luzon and islands in the Visayas. Inter-island ferries, RORO, and cargo ships from Manila, the southern Luzon ports of Batangas City, Lucena City in Quezon province, Roxas, Oriental Mindoro, and Roxas City in Capiz province are the primary modes of transportation linking the province {{to the rest of}} the country. Montenegro Lines, 2GO, and Romblon Shipping Lines all have ferry service from Manila to the main ports of entry of Odiongan and the capital town of Romblon and vice versa. From Romblon, Montenegro also serves Magdiwang in Sibuyan, while Romblon Shipping Lines also serves Cajidiocan. Pump boats and wooden launches also link the province to the towns of Buenavista, Marinduque and Pinamalayan, Oriental Mindoro. These pump boats are also used in going to barangays where there are no existing road networks or between municipalities in the province that do not have existing ferry service.|$|E
5|$|The Port Authority {{voted to}} proceed with the {{scaled-down}} system in 1996. A final environmental impact statement (FEIS) for the JFK people mover, conducted by the Port Authority and released in 1997, examined eight possible transport improvements that could be constructed in order to provide this direct connection. Ultimately, a light rail with the qualities of a people mover, tentatively called the JFK Light Rail System, was selected as the most feasible <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> <b>transportation</b> for the new system. It would replace the shuttle buses that traveled between the terminals as well as to and from Howard Beach. The FEIS determined that an automated system with frequent headways was the most optimal design. The light rail would run from the airport terminals to either Jamaica or Howard Beach. It had been almost 30 years between the first JFK rail link proposal and the approval of the light rail system; within that time period, there had been 21 proposals for direct rail links to New York-area airports, which were all canceled.|$|E
5|$|The bas-reliefs in Borobudur {{depicted}} many {{scenes of}} daily life in 8th-century ancient Java, from the courtly palace life, hermit in the forest, to those of commoners in the village. It also depicted temple, marketplace, various flora and fauna, and also native vernacular architecture. People depicted here are the images of king, queen, princes, noblemen, courtier, soldier, servant, commoners, priest and hermit. The reliefs also depicted mythical spiritual beings in Buddhist beliefs such as asuras, gods, bodhisattvas, kinnaras, gandharvas and apsaras. The images depicted on bas-relief often served as reference for historians to research for certain subjects, such as the study of architecture, weaponry, economy, fashion, and also <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> <b>transportation</b> of 8th-century Maritime Southeast Asia. One of the famous renderings of an 8th-century Southeast Asian double outrigger ship is Borobudur Ship. Today, the actual-size replica of Borobudur Ship that had sailed from Indonesia to Africa in 2004 is displayed in the Samudra Raksa Museum, located a few hundred meters north of Borobudur.|$|E

5|$|The player's primary <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> <b>transportation</b> is a {{starship}} {{which serves}} as Shepard's base of operations. Aboard the ship, the player can interact with the squad members, buy new equipment, and travel to numerous planetary systems. Although the game features {{a large number of}} planets for the player to examine, only a few of them can actually be landed on and explored. Some of them can also be surveyed to search for valuable resources and quest-relevant items. Upon landing on a planet, the player can traverse on-foot or by using an all-terrain infantry fighting vehicle called the M35 Mako. Most of the game's main quests are geared toward on-foot combat, but some segments may feature combat requiring the use of the M35 Mako. In contrast, secondary quests usually require the player to explore free-roam uncharted worlds with the vehicle. Equipment items, which include armor, weapon, and ammunition upgrades, can be found around the environment or purchased from merchants in settlements.|$|E
