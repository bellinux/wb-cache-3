Therefore the effect of orange juice on in vitro regeneration of sugarcane was investigated.

40|$|Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Four different computer-based <b>media</b> <b>combinations</b> - Text-only, Text + Diagrams, Spoken Text + Diagrams, and Text + Video material - have been created to instruct participants how {{to carry out the}} practical task of removing and installing both a video card and a CPU chip in a computer system. The four presentations are based upon identical teaching material. Tests were constructed to measure the amount of knowledge gained both in the theoretical and in the practical parts of the experiment. An interactive facility was provided which allowed participants to move forwards and backwards in the material so that the effects of interactivity (or lack of it) could be investigated in relation to the <b>media</b> <b>combinations</b> used. In addition, student learning style was measured and the effects of the four presentations on students with different learning styles were investigated. A practical domain was chosen because most previous work has mainly been on theoretical domains (such as statistics) or on animated examples of simple systems (such as braking systems). Two experiments have been designed and carried out. The first experiment was a pilot study which used 24 participants. Its results were used to improve the design of the second experiment by improving the material presented and the knowledge tests and adjusting the complexity of the questions used in the test. The second experiment was a more extensive one in which 80 participants took part. These results showed that text-only material was not as effective in delivering the teaching material to the participants compared with the other presentations. However, when interactivity was introduced, the text-only participants were able to improve their performance considerably by moving extensively between scenes. The addition of video material did not improve the learning performance in the completion of the practical tasks, in comparison with the other <b>media</b> <b>combinations</b> and this may have been due to a redundancy effect. Finally, learning style (regarding the sensing/intuitive learners) did result in significant learning performance differences, but these were not due to the <b>media</b> <b>combinations</b> used. An examination of performance of sensing and intuitive learners over the theoretical and practical aspects of the test suggested that the difference may be due to intuitors' preference for theoretical material and sensors' preference for practical material. Further research work is proposed to investigate further the effects observed...|$|R

Throughout these case histories (and the numerous films in which these pieces of music are heard), narrative congruence between the music and the associated visual image is demonstrated.

It was observed from this experiment that vegetative growth and plant biomass were positively affected when plants grown under all different media concentration than control. However, the comparative performance of all potting combination showed that T 8 (silt+leaf compost+perlite) and T 7 (silt+leaf compost+coconut compost) were approved to be most suitable mixture which significantly improve the overall growth and biomass of Caladium. Soilless potting substrates are commonly used for better seedling growth and quick germination in greenhouse bedding and potted plants (Baiyeri 2003; Younis et al. 2008). From this experiment, it was perceived that potting <b>media</b> with a <b>combination</b> of organic (leaf manure) and inorganic (perlite) with silt reduced the mean germination time and showed fast bulb growth compared to other <b>media</b> <b>combinations</b> and control treatment. It can be concluded that the combinations of the above growing media are best because different media are rich in different nutrients and multi-nutrient substrates are good for the soil chemical, physical and biological properties. In different plant species early sprouting depends upon the air, water content and temperature of the medium (Guerin et al. 2001). Similar findings were observed by Shah et al. (2006) where FYM, leaf compost and silt at 1 : 1 : 1 ratio as growing substrate for Ficus binnendijkii c.v. Amstel Queen gave highest sprouting percentage. Results are also {{in accordance with the}} outcomes of Riaz et al. (2008) who observed the early seedling germination in Zinnia elegans under influence of silt, compost, and leaf manure media. It is suggested to use balanced potting substrates for ornamental plants in order to get maximum plant height. All potting <b>media</b> <b>combinations</b> showed highly significant effect for this growth character. The highest stimulatory effect and the maximum enhancement in plant height was noticed in pots mixed with silt, perlite, and leaf manure in 1 : 1 : 1 ratio as a potting media (Table  1). This combination performed best because in this combination pH and amount of nitrogen was optimum, these finding are in relation with the findings of Grassoti et al. (2003), they found that Lilium as a cut flower give maximum plant height when different media were used as potting substrate. Results also showed that different <b>media</b> with different <b>combinations</b> have more effects on plant height.
