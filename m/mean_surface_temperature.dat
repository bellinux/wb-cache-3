25|$|A {{planet that}} is too small cannot hold much of an atmosphere. Hence the surface {{temperature}} becomes more variable and the average temperature drops. Substantial and long-lasting oceans become impossible. A small planet will also {{tend to have a}} rough surface, with large mountains and deep canyons. The core will cool faster, and plate tectonics will either not last as long as they would on a larger planet or may not occur at all.

We find that global <b>mean</b> <b>surface</b> <b>temperatures</b> above freezing can indeed be found for luminosities larger than about 0. 8 (corresponding to ~ 2. 9 Ga and nearly complete tropical cirrus coverage). For luminosities smaller than 0. 8, even though global <b>mean</b> <b>surface</b> <b>temperatures</b> are below freezing, tropical mean temperatures are still above freezing, indicating the possibility of a partially ice-free Earth for the Early Archean. We discuss possible mechanisms for the functioning of this negative feedback. While it is feasible for tropical cirrus to completely eliminate the paradox, it is similarly possible for tropical cirrus to reduce the amounts of other greenhouse gases needed for solving the paradox and therefore easing the constraints on CO 2 and CH 4 that appear to be in disagreement with geological evidence...|$|R

40|$|Early Mars {{may have}} had a warmer and denser {{atmosphere}} allowing for the presence of liquid water on the surface. However, climate model studies {{have not been able to}} reproduce these conditions even with a CO 2 atmosphere of several bars. Recent 3 D simulations of the early Mars climate show that <b>mean</b> <b>surface</b> <b>temperatures</b> only slightly below 273 K could be reached locally. We want to investigate the effect of increased partial pressures of N 2 on early Mars' <b>surface</b> <b>temperature</b> by including pressure broadening of absorption lines and collision-induced N 2 -N 2 absorption. A 1 D radiative-convective cloud-free atmospheric model was used to calculate <b>temperature</b> profiles and <b>surface</b> conditions. We performed a parameter study varying the N 2 partial pressures from 0 to 0. 5 bar at CO 2 partial pressures between 0. 02 bar and 3 bar. These values are consistent with existing estimates of the initial, pre-Noachian reservoir. Solar insolation was set to be consistent with the late Noachian. Our 1 D global mean simulations clearly show that enhanced N 2 content in the Martian atmosphere could have increased <b>surface</b> <b>temperatures.</b> An additional greenhouse warming of up to 13 K was found at a high N 2 partial pressure of 0. 5 bar. Still, even at this N 2 partial pressure, global <b>mean</b> <b>surface</b> <b>temperatures</b> remained below 273 K, i. e. the freezing point of water. However, given the magnitude of the N 2 -induced surface warming and the results of recent 3 D studies which show that local <b>mean</b> <b>surface</b> <b>temperatures</b> are not much lower than 273 K, our results imply that the presence of atmospheric N 2 could have led to almost continously habitable <b>mean</b> <b>surface</b> conditions in some regions. In addition, atmospheric water column amounts increased by up to a factor of 6 in response to the surface warming, indicating that precipitation might also increase upon increasing N 2 partial pressure.

40|$|Thirteen {{noble gas}} samples were {{collected}} from eleven wells and two mountain springs in the Treasure Valley, Idaho, USA to derive recharge temperatures using noble gas thermometry. One common assumption with noble gas thermometry is that recharge temperatures are roughly equal to the <b>mean</b> annual <b>surface</b> <b>temperature.</b> When water table depths are shallow or variable, or infiltration is seasonal recharge temperatures may be {{significantly different from the}} <b>mean</b> annual <b>surface</b> <b>temperature.</b> Water table depths throughout the study area were used to estimate recharge source temperatures using an infiltration-weighted recharge temperature model which takes into account a time-variable water table. This model was applied to six different seasonally-dependent recharge scenarios. The modeled recharge temperatures for all scenarios showed a strong dependence of recharge temperature on mean annual depth to water. Temperature results from the different recharge scenarios ranged from near the <b>mean</b> annual <b>surface</b> <b>temperature</b> to as much as 6 °C warmer. This compared well to noble gas derived recharge temperatures from the valley wells which ranged from 5 °C below to 7. 4 °C above the <b>mean</b> annual <b>surface</b> <b>temperature</b> of the valley.

2500|$|The Toba {{eruption}} apparently {{coincided with}} the onset of the last glacial period. Michael L. Rampino and Stephen Self argue that the eruption caused a [...] "brief, dramatic cooling or 'volcanic winter'", which resulted in a drop of the global <b>mean</b> <b>surface</b> <b>temperature</b> by 3–5°C and accelerated the transition from warm to cold temperatures of the last glacial cycle. Evidence from Greenland ice cores indicates a 1,000-year period of low δ18O and increased dust deposition immediately following the eruption. The eruption may have caused this 1,000-year period of cooler temperatures (stadial), two centuries of which could be accounted for by the persistence of the Toba stratospheric loading. Rampino and Self believe that global cooling was already underway {{at the time of the}} eruption, but that the process was slow; YTT [...] "may have provided the extra 'kick' that caused the climate system to switch from warm to cold states". Although Clive Oppenheimer rejects the hypothesis that the eruption triggered the last glaciation, he agrees that it may have been responsible for a millennium of cool climate prior to the 19th Dansgaard-Oeschger event.|$|E
