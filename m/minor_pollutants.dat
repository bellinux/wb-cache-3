40|$|International audienceGreen roofs recover {{green spaces}} {{in urban areas}} and benefit the public, farmers, and {{wildlife}} by providing many environmental, ecological, and economic advantages. Green roofs reduce stormwater runoff, mitigate urban heat island effects, absorb dust and smog, sequester carbon dioxide, produce oxygen, create space for food production, and provide natural habitat for animals and plants. Here, we studied {{the environmental impact of}} green roofs in terms of runoff quality and greenhouse gas CO 2 sequestration. We screened more than 650 scientific papers and we reviewed detailed findings from 52 publications. There are two major points: (1) Concerning pollution, the concentrations of <b>minor</b> <b>pollutants,</b> such as heavy metals, biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), total suspended solids (TSS), and turbidity, are small and thus do not pose an immediate threat to the environment. However, the concentrations of major pollutants, such as nitrogen of 0. 49 – 9. 01  mg/l and phosphorus of 0. 04 – 25  mg/l, vary highly for different green roofs and can adversely affect runoff quality. Nutrient leaching may be controllable through proper mitigation measures including better design and system management which require further research. According to both laboratory experiments and field monitoring data, the main factors affecting runoff quality are precipitation properties, growth media composition and depth, plant species, and maintenance protocols. Research gaps exist in quantifying how these factors affect leachate pollutant load. Systematic studies are needed for improving green roof designs to reduce adverse impacts. (2) Concerning CO 2 sequestration, studies reveal that green roofs directly sequester substantial amounts of carbon in plants and soils through photosynthesis. Green roofs reduce ambient CO 2 concentrations in the vicinities. Green roofs also indirectly reduce CO 2 releases from power plants and furnaces by reducing demand for heating and cooling, suggesting long-term economic and environmental benefits of green roofs...|$|E
30|$|During winter, the {{measured}} levels of Cd, Cr, Cu, Mn, and Pb in the sediments {{are found to}} be higher than the LEL values in 90 %, 97 %, 100 %, 10 %, and 7.0 % samples, respectively. It reveals moderate impact on the biota health. The observed values of Fe and Zn {{are found to be}} lower than the LEL values in 100 % sediment samples, indicating that these metals are not associated with adverse impact on the biota (Graney and Eriksen [2004]). The ERL and ERM SQGs manifest that Cd and Pb levels exceed the ERL values in 3.0 % and 7.0 % sediment samples, respectively, demonstrating that these metals are associated with occasional adverse health hazards to the surrounding biota (MacDonald et al. [2000]). The concentrations of Cr, Cu, and Zn are lower than the ERL values in 100 % sediment samples, demonstrating little or no undesirable health hazards. The potential acute toxicity study reveals that the average levels of TUs for heavy metals follow a decreasing order: Cd[*]>[*]Cr[*]>[*]Pb[*]>[*]Zn[*]>[*]Cu. It illustrates that Cd, Cr, and Pb are the major contributors to ∑TUs (i.e., 42 %, 25 %, and 12 %, respectively; Figure  4), while Cu (8.6 %) is a minor contributor (Pedersen et al. [1998]). The values of ∑TUs range from 0.54 to 3.29 with an average value of 3.29 in the sediments. Based on the USEPA sediments classification (Giesy and Hoke [1990]), Cd, Fe, and Pb may pose little or no pollution. Cr and Zn cause moderate contamination, and Cu and Mn exhibit heavy pollution in the sediments. Consequently, Cr, Cu, Mn, and Zn emerge as the major pollutants in the water reservoir during winter. Overall, the SQG results lead {{to the conclusion that the}} metals, such as Cd, Cr, Cu, Mn, and Pb are of concern during both seasons. Potential acute toxicity results demonstrate that Cd, Cr, and Pb are the major toxicants, while Zn and Cu are the <b>minor</b> <b>pollutants</b> during both seasons. However, relatively higher potential acute toxicity is observed during summer than during winter.|$|E
40|$|Concerns {{about climate}} change have {{encouraged}} significant interest in concepts for ultra-low or ''zero''-emissions power generation systems. In some proposed concepts, nitrogen {{is removed from the}} combustion air and replaced with another diluent such as carbon dioxide or steam. In this way, formation of nitrogen oxides is prevented, and the exhaust stream can be separated into concentrated CO{sub 2 } and steam or water streams. The concentrated CO{sub 2 } stream could then serve as input to a CO{sub 2 } sequestration process or utilized in some other way. Some of these concepts are illustrated in Figure 1. This project is an investigation of one approach to ''zero'' emission power generation. Oxy-fuel combustion is used with steam as diluent in a power cycle proposed by Clean Energy Systems, Inc. (CES) [1, 2]. In oxy-fuel combustion, air separation is used to produce nearly pure oxygen for combustion. In this particular concept, the combustion temperatures are moderated by steam as a diluent. An advantage of this technique is that water in the product stream can be condensed with relative ease, leaving a pure CO{sub 2 } stream suitable for sequestration. Because most of the atmospheric nitrogen has been separated from the oxidant, the potential to form any NOx pollutant is very small. Trace quantities of any <b>minor</b> <b>pollutants</b> species that do form are captured with the CO{sub 2 } or can be readily removed from the condensate. The result is a nearly zero-emission power plant. A sketch of the turbine system proposed by CES is shown in Figure 2. NETL is working with CES to develop a reheat combustor for this application. The reheat combustion application is unusual even among oxy-fuel combustion applications. Most often, oxy-fuel combustion is carried out with the intent of producing very high temperatures for heat transfer to a product. In the reheat case, incoming steam is mixed with the oxygen and natural gas fuel to control the temperature of the output stream to about 1480 K. A potential concern is the possibility of quenching non-equilibrium levels of CO or unburned fuel in the mixing process. Inadequate residence times in the combustor and/or slow kinetics could possibly result in unacceptably high emissions. Thus, the reheat combustor design must balance the need for minimal excess oxygen with the need to oxidize the CO. This paper will describe the progress made to date in the design, fabrication, and simulation of a reheat combustor for an advanced steam generator system, and discuss planned experimental testing to be conducted in conjunction with NASA Glenn Research Center-Plumb Brook Station...|$|E
40|$|This report {{describes}} the process modeling done {{in support of}} the Integrated Nonthermal Treatment System (INTS) study. This study was performed to supplement the Integrated Thermal Treatment System (ITTS) study and comprises five conceptual treatment systems that treat DOE contract-handled mixed low-level wastes (MLLW) at temperatures of less than 350 {degrees}F. ASPEN PLUS, a chemical process simulator, was used to model the systems. Nonthermal treatment systems were developed as part of the INTS study and include sufficient processing steps to treat the entire inventory of MLLW. The final result of the modeling is a process flowsheet with a detailed mass and energy balance. In contrast to the ITTS study, which modeled only the main treatment system, the INTS study modeled each of the various processing steps with ASPEN PLUS, release 9. 1 - 1. Trace constituents, such as radionuclides and <b>minor</b> <b>pollutant</b> species, {{were not included in the}} calculations...|$|R
40|$|The {{air quality}} in Province of Trieste has been {{considered}} in terms of <b>minor</b> <b>pollutant</b> species as nitrogen oxides and sulphur dioxide: these species are correlated to motor vehicle traffic and to heating system activities, and their distribution can provide information on both urban and industrial factors affecting the air quality. Air pollutant concentration trends {{make it possible to}} distinguish three types of areas: (i) the town-centre' areas display nitrogen oxide contents higher than sulphur dioxide; (ii) the industrial' areas have instead sulphur dioxide contents similar or higher than nitrogen oxides; (iii) the peripheral ones, less affected by urban traffic and industrial sources, display the lowest pollutant contents. Pollutant distribution is affected by winds. Industrial source-points of sulphur dioxide were detected. In town centre, sulphur dioxide has its minimum in summer, when home heating systems stop: this decrease is not observed in sites nearby industrial areas...|$|R
40|$|A {{study was}} {{performed}} {{that takes into}} account both turbulence and chemical kinetic effects in the numerical simulation of diesel engine combustion in order to better understand the importance of their respective roles at changing operating conditions. An approach was developed which combines the simplicity and low computational and storage requests of the laminar-and-turbulent characteristic-time model with a detailed combustion chemistry model based on well-known simplified mechanisms. Assuming appropriate simplifications such as steady state or equilibrium for most of the radicals and intermediate species, the kinetics of hydrocarbons can be described by means of three overall steps. This approach was integrated in the KIVA-II code. The concept was validated and applied to a single-cylinder, heavy-duty engine. The simulation covers a wide range of operating conditions. The turbulence seems to {{play a significant role in}} the predictions of the early stages of combustion and on the soot-NO x trade-off versus injection timing. The traces of calculated pressure and heat release for different operating conditions are in good agreement with the measured values. However, the model does not allow accurate prediction of some <b>minor</b> <b>pollutant</b> species as CO and unburned hydrocarbons, especially at light loads...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} are (i) to {{determine}} the yearly and monsoonal variations of the criteria pollutants in Kuala Terengganu, (ii) identify the influences of the meteorological factors and other <b>minor</b> criteria <b>pollutants</b> that impose on the concentration of the most significant criteria pollutant using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The hourly data for the criteria pollutants (PM 10, CO, O 3, NO 2, and SO 2) and meteorological factors (temperature, relative humidity, windspeed) for the duration of 10 years procured from the Department of Environment, Malaysia were analyzed. PM 10 is the only pollutant that frequently recorded concentrations exceeding the MAAQG in the length of the year 2001 to 2010 and the criteria pollutants reported differ significantly between the monsoon seasons. PCA showed that sources contributing to the most significant criteria pollutant (PM 10) are meteorological factor influences and industrial emissions...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} study we {{investigated}} Beijing tap water from urban and suburban areas as well as bottled water from Beijing supermarkets {{with a focus on}} selected anions (Cl-, NO 3 -, SO 42 -, F-), metals and trace elements (Al, As, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb, Se, V, Zn), in order to reveal the degree of anthropogenic pollution and the ability of both water types to serve as a safe drinking water source. In addition, we applied multiple stable isotope (delta-N- 15 (nitrate), delta O- 18 (nitrate), delta S- 34 (sulfate), delta O- 18 (sulfate), Delta S- 33 (sulfate)) analyses on Beijing tap water for the identification of specific pollution sources. 27 % of the analyzed tap water samples show one or more constituents above the national guideline limits. 9 % of the samples reveal concentrations above the NO 3 - limit, while 5 % exceed the standard value for As, which makes this tap water unsuitable for daily consumption due to a serious health risk, especially for children and babies. The median concentrations of most analyzed compounds are significantly higher in Beijing tap water compared to European countries. Concentration and isotope data for tap water indicate urban sewage as the major origin of anthropogenic pollutants probably released by leaking wastewater pipes to the local groundwater as the principal tap water source. The results suggest industrial emissions and As-rich alluvial deposits as further but <b>minor</b> <b>pollutant</b> sources. In contrast, bottled water exhibits exclusively concentrations below the standard values and clearly lower median values compared to Beijing tap water. Hence, bottled water can be recommended as a valuable alternative to Beijing tap water, especially in areas where the pollutant levels in tap water are high. Moreover, the results reveal the problematic groundwater situation in Beijing and demonstrate the advantages of a combined geochemical and multiple isotope approach in order to uncover complex pollution mechanisms in metropolitan areas.

30|$|In this study, {{sorption}} {{experiments with}} {{two types of}} microplastic particles (polyethylene and polystyrene) and 19 different contaminants (pesticides, pharmaceuticals, and personal care products) were performed at three different pH values. We could show that sorption to plastic particles is stronger for hydrophobic compounds and that neutral species usually contribute more to the overall sorption. Bulk partitioning coefficients {{were in the same}} order of magnitude for polyethylene and polystyrene. Furthermore, our results confirm that partition coefficients for polar compounds can only be accurately determined if the solid-to-liquid ratio in batch experiments is more than 6 – 7 orders of magnitude higher than any plastic concentration detected in the environment. Consequently, only a <b>minor</b> fraction of <b>pollutants</b> in water bodies is associated with microplastics.|$|R
40|$|The Mediterranean basin can be {{considered}} a hot spot {{not only in terms of}} climate change (CC) but also for air quality. Assessing the impact of CC and air pollution on ecosystem functions is a challenging task, and adequate monitoring techniques are needed. This paper summarizes the present knowledge on the use of reflectance spectroscopy for the evaluation of the effects of air pollution on plants. First, the history of this technique is outlined. Next, we describe the vegetation reflectance spectrum, how it can be scaled from leaf to landscape levels, what information it contains, and how it can be exploited to understand plant and ecosystem functions. Finally, we review the literature concerning this topic, with special attention to Mediterranean air pollutants, showing the increasing interest in this technique. The ability of spectroscopy to detect the influence of air pollution on plant function of all major and <b>minor</b> Mediterranean <b>pollutants</b> has been evaluated, and ozone and its interaction with other gases (carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and sulfur dioxide) have been the most studied. In the recent years, novel air pollutants, such as particulate matter, nitrogen deposition, and heavy metals, have drawn attention. Although various vegetation types have been studied, few of these species are representative of the Mediterranean environment. Thus, major emphasis should be placed on using vegetation spectroscopy for better understanding and monitoring the impact of air pollution on Mediterranean plants in the CC era...|$|R
500|$|The park {{contains}} a dozen large lakes and 700 smaller ones, but only 131 lakes have been named. Lake McDonald {{on the western}} side of the park is the longest at , the largest in area at , and the deepest at [...] Numerous smaller lakes, known as tarns, are located in cirques formed by glacial erosion. Some of these lakes, like Avalanche Lake and Cracker Lake, are colored an opaque turquoise by suspended glacial silt, which also causes a number of streams to run milky white. The lakes of Glacier National Park remain cold year round, with temperatures rarely above [...] at their surface. Cold water lakes such as these support little plankton growth, ensuring that the lake waters are remarkably clear. The lack of plankton, however, lowers the rate of pollution filtration, so pollutants have a tendency to linger longer. Consequently, the lakes are considered environmental bellwethers as they can be quickly affected by even <b>minor</b> increases in <b>pollutants.</b>|$|R
40|$|During four field campaigns (2001 - 2003), fumarolic gases {{from the}} two Nicaraguan volcanoes Mombacho and Momotombo were {{repeatedly}} sampled {{with the objective of}} gaining a better understanding of processes occurring within their volcano-magma-systems. Mombacho is a highly dissected stratocone volcano that is generally considered extinct. The combined chemical and isotopic composition of the gases provide evidence for high-temperature conditions in the shallow subsurface. This suggests that Mombacho volcano should not be considered extinct, and could re-awaken and erupt in the future. Momotombo is an active volcano in persistent state of fumarolic activity since its last eruption in 1905 and discharges gases at high temperatures. The chemistry, isotopic compositions and trace element contents of the gases have changed considerably over the last 20 years. These changes appear to be related to degassing of different magma batches and major changes in the interaction between the magmatic and hydrothermal systems. Flux estimates for some highly volatile and potentially harmful trace elements of magmatic origin (e. g. Tl, Bi, As, Se, Sb, Hg, Cd) show that Momotombo is only a <b>minor</b> source of <b>pollutants</b> in the atmosphere...|$|R
40|$|Detailed {{mechanisms}} describing ignition, {{flame propagation}} and pollutant formation typically involve several hundred species and elementary reactions, prohibiting {{their use in}} practical three-dimensional engine simulations. Conventionally reduced mechanisms often fail to predict <b>minor</b> radicals and <b>pollutant</b> precursors. The ILDM-method is an automatic reduction of a detailed mechanism, which assumes local equilibrium {{with respect to the}} fastest time scales identified by a local eigenvector analysis. In the reactive flow calculation, the species compositions are constrained to these manifolds. Conservation equations are solved for {{only a small number of}} reaction progress variables, thereby retaining the accuracy of detailed chemical mechanisms. This gives an effective way of coupling the details of complex chemistry with the time variations due to turbulence. A standard and RNG k-e model is used to model the turbulent flow field. Turbulence-chemistry interactions are taken into account by integrating the chemical source terms over a presumed probability density function (pdf). The standard KIVA III code along with the above models for chemistry and turbulence were used to simulate the flow in a single cylinder of a DI diesel engine. Since no equilibrium or partial-equilibrium approach is involved, accurate concentrations of O radicals and soot-precursors (C 2 H 2 & C 3 H 3) can be obtained from the ILDM...|$|R
