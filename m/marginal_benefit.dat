According to the Environment Agency, many companies in the UK have reduced their water loss to the economic level of leakage. This is the level at which, in the long-term, the marginal cost of leakage control {{is equal to the}} <b>marginal</b> <b>benefit</b> of the water saved. The rate of reduction in leakage has slowed for many companies because the most obvious causes of leakage have been detected and addressed, leaving only less apparent leakage problems. Models have been developed and fine-tuned to assess the economic level of leakage. A summary of the debate on these models {{can be found in a}} recent report by OFWAT.|$|E
2500|$|In December 2009, then {{transport}} minister Seiji Maehara {{proposed a}} bullet train link to Haneda Airport, using an existing spur {{that connects the}} Tōkaidō Shinkansen to a train depot. JR Central called the plan [...] "unrealistic" [...] due to tight train schedules on the existing line, but reports said that Maehara wished to continue discussions on the idea. The current minister has not indicated whether this proposal remains supported. While the plan may become more feasible after the opening the Chuo Shinkansen (sometimes {{referred to as a}} bypass to the Tokaido Shinkansen) frees up capacity, construction is already underway for other rail improvements between Haneda and Tokyo station expected to be completed prior to the opening of the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, so any potential Shinkansen service would likely offer only <b>marginal</b> <b>benefit</b> beyond that.|$|E

The list of offending interventions that are paid for [...] and widely used but either unproven or of <b>marginal</b> <b>benefit</b> to patients is vast – IMRT and proton beam for early prostate cancer, CT and MRI angiograms, Epogen for chemotherapy induced anemia, Erbitux and Avastin for colorectal cancer, and drug eluting stents for coronary artery disease. Stanford researchers recently showed that between 15 and 20 percent of prescriptions are written for indications {{for which there is}} absolutely no published data supporting their use. The Dartmouth study for variation in practices demonstrate that for many interventions, more services are not better. For instance, heart attack patients in Miami receive vastly more care than similar patients in Minnesota at 2.45 times the cost, yet have slightly worse outcomes.|$|E

The analysis assumes a two-stage game theoretical model. Conditions for self-enforcing sets of agreements and the resulting total emission abatement are determined.

We then analyze the effect of multiple coalitions for the case of increasing marginal costs of abatement {{as well as for}} decreasing <b>marginal</b> <b>benefits</b> of abatement more generally. The results are sensitive to the assumptions on the benefits from abatement. For constant <b>marginal</b> <b>benefits,</b> the possibility of multiple agreements increases the number of cooperating countries and total abatement (compared to the standard case with a single agreement).

40|$|In {{this paper}} we empirically {{estimate}} {{the contribution of}} the communications infrastructure to the growth of output and productivity at the dis-aggregate industry and at the aggregate economy levels. The estimated value of the <b>marginal</b> <b>benefits</b> or the shadow price of the communications infrastructure capital is positive in each of 34 industries representing the major industrial sectors of the U.

This effect captures network externality benefits and can be interpreted as a willingness to pay by each industry for communications infrastructure capital services over and above their direct payments for communications services. These results suggest that an increase in communications infrastructure capital services reduces cost in all the industries and as a consequence that of the entire economy. The relatively high value of estimated total <b>marginal</b> <b>benefits</b> for the aggregate economy indicates a high social rate of return to the investments in communications infrastructure. communications, infrastructure, network externality, <b>marginal</b> <b>benefits,</b> productivity, JEL Code D 2; D 24; LOO; L 86; L 96; 047,...|$|R
40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. December 2014. Major: Applied Economics. Advisor: Jay S. Coggins. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); viii, 152 pages. This dissertation examines {{the economics of}} air pollution in three essays. The first two essays consider {{the implications of the}} possibility of increasing <b>marginal</b> <b>benefits</b> to pollution abatement. The third essay integrates a new model of air dispersion with an economic model to estimate the marginal damage caused by criteria pollutants in the United States. In the first essay, the optimal abatement policy is derived for a scenario with increasing <b>marginal</b> <b>benefits</b> of abatement and uncertainty in the marginal cost of abatement. Pollution taxes are preferred over quantity restrictions when <b>marginal</b> <b>benefits</b> are increasing in abatement. The second essay uses simulations of fine particulate matter (PM 2. 5) dispersion and compares optimal source-specific pollution control policies with pollution concentration standards and uniform pollution taxes. Optimal policies for PM 2. 5 regulation yield substantial advantages over uniform policies that do not discriminate based on the location of emissions. The simulations also consider the shape of the concentration-response (C-R) relationship between PM 2. 5 pollution and mortality. With a log-log C-R, where <b>marginal</b> <b>benefits</b> of PM 2. 5 abatement are increasing, society should prefer fewer emissions and lower PM 2. 5 concentrations than if the C-R is log-linear, where <b>marginal</b> <b>benefits</b> of abatement are decreasing. The third essay estimates the marginal damages of criteria pollutant emissions for hundreds of the most heavily polluting sources in the U. S. Marginal damages vary substantially depending on the location of the emission source. The calculation of marginal damages is highly dependent on the choice of air dispersion modeling, the C-R relationship, and the value assigned to mortality caused by environmental risks...|$|R

The interest rate faced by the consumer is denoted by r. The marginal cost of health capital can be found by adding these variables: [...] The <b>marginal</b> <b>benefit</b> of health capital is the rate of return from this capital in both market and non-market sectors.

Age also decreases the <b>marginal</b> <b>benefit</b> of health stock. The optimal health stock will therefore decrease as one ages.|$|E

Consistent with the trade-off, firms diversify cautiously and stop diversifying before the <b>marginal</b> <b>benefits</b> are offset by the costs.

40|$|According to the {{conventional}} public finance literature any tax instrument other than the lump-sum tax is inherently distortionary because it alters relative prices. This paper revisits {{the case of the}} labor income tax and shows that its supposedly distortionary effects are the result of a stringent assumption about labor supply behavior. The conventional time allocation model generally assumes that taxpayers disregard the <b>marginal</b> <b>benefits</b> of taxation, received in the form of additional public goods, in their labor supply responses to the labor income tax. In line with previous literature stressing the importance of government spending for labor supply behavior, this paper generalizes the traditional model by describing the behavior of taxpayers that consider both the marginal costs and the <b>marginal</b> <b>benefits</b> of the labor income tax. Under these less stringent assumptions the paper derives an efficient (undistorted) solution to the public goods problem, where taxpayers contribute to the public goods in accordance to their individual <b>marginal</b> <b>benefits</b> while the relative value of leisure remains equal to the pre-tax wage rate. public goods, distortion, Lindahl price, labor tax, lump-sum tax, labor supply...|$|R

For example, in the case of pollution, the relative slopes of marginal costs and marginal damages must be examined (the <b>marginal</b> <b>benefits</b> are the avoidance of the marginal damages).

50|$|When an {{investment}} tax credit or equity-based deduction of profits is applied, the optimal pre-deduction and average effective rate of taxation is generally increased as the distortionary effect of a given level of taxation is diminished. If the tax rate prior {{to the adoption of}} these provisions was optimal, there is an assumption that the net <b>marginal</b> <b>benefit</b> of increased taxation is zero in the locality of the optimum rate (the marginal costs and benefits sum to zero). If the distortionary costs of capital taxation are then lowered by equity deductions or {{investment tax credit}}s, then it is clear that in the region of the previous optimal rate the net <b>marginal</b> <b>benefit</b> of increases in the rate will become positive, implying the tax rate should be raised upward from this level.|$|E
