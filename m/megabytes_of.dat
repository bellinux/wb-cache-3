5|$|Early A320s {{used the}} Intel 80186 and Motorola 68010. In 1988, the flight {{management}} computer contained six Intel 80286 CPUs, running in three logical pairs, with 2.5 <b>megabytes</b> <b>of</b> memory.|$|E
5|$|Though the Sega CD {{offers a}} faster processor, its main {{purpose is to}} expand {{the size of the}} games. Whereas ROM {{cartridges}} of the day typically contained 8 to 16 megabits of data, a CD-ROM disc can hold more than 640 <b>megabytes</b> <b>of</b> data, more than 320 times the storage of a Genesis cartridge. This allows the Sega CD to run games containing full motion video.|$|E
5|$|The main {{creative}} {{force behind}} the overall 3D presentation was Kazuyuki Hashimoto, the general supervisor for these sequences. Being experienced in the new technology the team had brought on board, he accepted the post at Square as the team aligned with his own creative spirit. One of the major events in development was when the real-time graphics were synchronized to computer-generated full motion video (FMV) cutscenes for some story sequences, notably an early sequence where a real-time model of Cloud jumps onto an FMV-rendered moving train. The backgrounds were created by overlaying two 2D graphic layers and changing the motion speed of each to simulate depth perception. While {{this was not a}} new technique, the increased power of the PlayStation enabled a more elaborate version of this effect. The biggest issue with the 3D graphics was the large memory storage gap between the development hardware and the console: while the early 3D tech demo had been developed on a machine with over 400 <b>megabytes</b> <b>of</b> total memory, the PlayStation only had two <b>megabytes</b> <b>of</b> system memory and 500 kilobytes for texture memory. The team needed {{to figure out how to}} shrink the amount of data while preserving the desired effects. This was aided with reluctant help from Sony, who had hoped to keep Square's direct involvement limited to a standard API package, but they eventually relented and allowed the team direct access to the hardware specifications.|$|E

5|$|The website of the UK {{law firm}} , which was {{associated}} with an anti-piracy client, was affected by the cyber-attack. In retaliation for the initial attacks being called only a minor nuisance, Anonymous launched more attacks, bringing the site down yet again. After coming back up, the front page accidentally revealed a backup file of the entire website, which contained over 300 <b>megabytes</b> <b>of</b> private company emails, which were leaked to several torrents and across several sites on the Internet.|$|E
5|$|The NeXT Computer {{was based}} on the new 25MHz Motorola 68030 central {{processing}} unit (CPU). The Motorola 88000 RISC chip was originally considered, but was not available in sufficient quantities. It included between 8 and 64 MB of random-access memory (RAM), a 256 MB magneto-optical (MO) drive, a 40 MB (swap-only), 330 MB, or 660 MB hard disk drive, 10BASE2 Ethernet, NuBus and a 17-inch MegaPixel grayscale display measuring 1120 by 832 pixels. In 1989 a typical new PC, Macintosh, or Amiga computer included a few <b>megabytes</b> <b>of</b> RAM, a 640×480 16-color or 320x240 4000-color display, a 10 to 20 megabyte hard drive and few networking capabilities.|$|E
5|$|The updates also {{contribute}} to the main story mode; the first added Sandman as its boss, while the fourth added Doctor Octopus, the sixth added Mysterio, and Venom was added in the August 2016 update. New characters are frequently added through the updates, and some of them, such as Spider-Gwen, Silk, Spider-Punk, and Aracnido Jr., made their first appearances in Spider-Man Unlimited. Other common update content includes thematic fights against specific villains, such as Jack O'Lantern, Hydro-Man, and Silver Sable. The sixth improved objective counters for events, while the seventh added short mission-style events. Some updates like the first and the sixth also included bug fixes, while the first adapted it to run on Windows Phone devices with 512 <b>megabytes</b> <b>of</b> RAM, and the sixth also made it compatible with the MFi Program.|$|E

5|$|In February 1996, Molyneux {{decided to}} focus on the project full-time. According to Carter, the creatures were made from bitmaps, and there was around 90 <b>megabytes</b> <b>of</b> {{graphics}} data on screen as of April 1996. In July 1996, Alex Peters joined the project and ported the game to Windows 95. Dungeon Keeper was shown at the European Computer Trade Show in September 1996, and was scheduled for release in December. It became evident that the deadline would be missed, and release was pushed back to March 1997. The final testing began in April 1997, and Dungeon Keeper was signed off in June. Dungeon Keeper was released by Electronic Arts in June 1997 for Windows 95 and MS-DOS. Sega Saturn and Sony PlayStation versions were in development and due for release in 1997, but cancelled. An internet version was in development, and would have supported up to 250 players.|$|E
5|$|The {{date was}} changed {{once more to}} August 3, before it was finally {{released}} in stores on August 24, 1995, {{the same day as}} the Microsoft's operating system Windows 95 version. Phantasmagoria came out first for Windows 95, Windows 3.1 and MS-DOS, then for Macintosh computers in November 1995. A hint book by Sierra came out {{at the same time as}} the game. Phantasmagoria was also ported to Sega Saturn and spanned eight discs exclusively in Japan, where it was fully translated and dubbed into Japanese, and released by Outrigger under the name Phantasm. In response to all the delays, Vince Broady, executive editor of the monthly publication Multimedia World, said Sierra may have been attempting to avoid the same mistakes from the previous year with Outpost, for which the company released many advertisements and reviews, but then over-promoted and released before it was finished. Sierra spokeswoman Kathy Gillmore admitted that mistakes were made in marketing Outpost and Sierra had tried to fix them. The minimum system requirements were an IBM compatible 486–25, 8 <b>megabytes</b> <b>of</b> RAM, 5 megabytes hard disk space, SVGA (256 colors) and a 2x CD-ROM. It supported Sound Blaster-compatible sound cards, and for MS-DOS the game worked with a megahertz chip. It sold for as much as $80 in some stores, but was typically sold for $69.95.|$|E
25|$|According to IGN, {{the game}} {{cartridge}} contains approximately four <b>megabytes</b> <b>of</b> speech data, sampled at 8kHz, compressed at {{a ratio of}} approximately 1:3 or 1:4.|$|E
5000|$|Typically, {{the first}} <b>megabyte</b> <b>of</b> each {{physical}} volume contains a mostly ASCII-encoded structure {{referred to as}} an [...] "LVM header" [...] or [...] "LVM head". Originally, the LVM head used to be written {{in the first and}} last <b>megabyte</b> <b>of</b> each PV for redundancy (in case of a partial hardware failure); however, this was later changed to only the first megabyte. Each PV's header is a complete copy of the entire volume group's layout, including the UUIDs of all other PVs and of LVs, and allocation map of PEs to LEs. This simplifies data recovery if a PV is lost.|$|R

25|$|Around 1991, Wang {{released}} the PC350-16 and PC350-40, which were Intel 80386 based, clocked at 16MHz and 40MHz respectively. They {{used the same}} VS compatible keyboard as the PC-240. They had a maximum of 4 <b>megabytes</b> <b>of</b> RAM and came with VGA screens as standard. They were generally supplied with MS-DOS, and Windows 3.0.|$|E
25|$|On the PlayStation 3, image {{processing}} for PlayStation Move is {{performed in the}} console's Cell microprocessor. According to Sony, use of the motion-tracking library entails some Synergistic Processing Unit (SPU) overhead as well an impact on memory, though the company states that the effects will be minimized. According to Move motion controller co-designer Anton Mikhailov, the library uses 1-2 <b>megabytes</b> <b>of</b> system memory.|$|E
50|$|At {{that time}} a typical desktop {{computer}} {{such as an}} early IBM Personal Computer might have 1/8 <b>of</b> a <b>megabyte</b> <b>of</b> memory (128K), 1/4 of a million pixels (640x400 monochrome display), and run at 0.33 million instructions per second (5Mhz 8088).|$|R
50|$|The MOS Technology 6509, an {{enhanced}} {{version of the}} popular 6502 microprocessor, was capable of addressing up to 1 <b>megabyte</b> <b>of</b> RAM via bank switching. While numerous 6502-based processors could do bank switching, they did this via separate logic. The 6509 had this logic on-chip.|$|R
50|$|NATINADS {{ability to}} handle data {{increased}} with faster clock rates. The H5118M computer had a staggering 1 <b>megabyte</b> <b>of</b> memory and could handle 1.2 million instructions per second while the former model had a memory of only 256 kilobytes and a clock speed of 150000 instructions per seconds.|$|R
25|$|The barrier {{was only}} {{overcome}} {{with the arrival}} of DOS extenders, which allowed DOS applications to run in extended memory, but these were not very widely used outside the computer game area. As games began to use digital sound and digital image textures, they performed better if these large data components could be preloaded into <b>megabytes</b> <b>of</b> memory before playing the game rather than constantly loading the data from external storage.|$|E
25|$|In {{terms of}} its random-access memory, or RAM, the Nintendo 64 {{is one of the}} first modern {{consoles}} to implement a unified memory subsystem, instead of having separate banks of memory for CPU, audio, and video, for example. The memory itself consists of 4 <b>megabytes</b> <b>of</b> RDRAM, made by Rambus. The RAM is expandable to 8MB with the Expansion Pak. Rambus was quite new at the time and offered Nintendo a way to provide a large amount of bandwidth for a relatively low cost.|$|E
25|$|In 1992, Wang marketed a PC-compatible {{based on}} the Intel 80386SX processor, which they called the Alliance 750CD. It was clocked at 25MHz and had a socket for an 80387 math coprocessor. It came with 2 <b>megabytes</b> <b>of</b> {{installed}} RAM, and was expandable to 16 megabytes using SIMM memory cards (a Wang invention that became an industry standard). It had a 1.44 megabyte floppy disk drive, an internal 80 megabyte hard disk, and a CD-ROM drive. Five expansion slots were built-in. It came with MS-DOS and Windows 3.1 operating systems.|$|E

25|$|The Qosmio series (dynabook Qosmio in Japan) was Toshiba's consumer-marketed line of high {{performance}} desktop replacement laptops. The laptop was first released on July 25, 2004 as the E15-AV101 with a 1.7GHz Intel Pentium M CPU, 512 <b>megabytes</b> <b>of</b> DDR SDRAM, and a 15inch XGA 1,024 by 768 screen. Toshiba's most powerful laptop has undergone many revisions, with focus shifting from high-end multimedia functionality to heavy gaming.

25|$|Windows 3.0, {{released}} in 1990, improved the design, {{mostly because of}} virtual memory and loadable virtual device drivers (VxDs) that allow Windows to share arbitrary devices between multi-tasked DOS applications. Windows 3.0 applications can run in protected mode, which gives them access to several <b>megabytes</b> <b>of</b> memory without the obligation {{to participate in the}} software virtual memory scheme. They run inside the same address space, where the segmented memory provides a degree of protection. Windows 3.0 also featured improvements to the user interface. Microsoft rewrote critical operations from C into assembly. Windows 3.0 is the first Microsoft Windows version to achieve broad commercial success, selling 2 million copies in the first six months.|$|E
25|$|The extra {{parameter}} this fourth-order transformation provides allowed Bring {{to decrease}} the degrees of the other parameters. This leads {{to a system of}} five equations in six unknowns, which then requires the solution of a cubic and a quadratic equation. This method was also discovered by Jerrard in 1852, but it is likely that he was unaware of Bring's previous work in this area. The full transformation may readily be accomplished using a computer algebra package such as Mathematica or Maple. As might be expected from the complexity of these transformations, the resulting expressions can be enormous, particularly when compared to the solutions in radicals for lower degree equations, taking many <b>megabytes</b> <b>of</b> storage for a general quintic with symbolic coefficients.|$|E
