5000|$|The {{satellites}} {{used for}} broadcasting television are {{usually in a}} geostationary orbit 37,000 km above the earth's equator. The advantage of this orbit is that the satellite's orbital period equals the rotation rate of the Earth, so the satellite appears at a fixed position in the sky. Thus the satellite dish antenna which receives the signal can be aimed permanently {{at the location of}} the satellite, and does not have to track a <b>moving</b> <b>satellite.</b> A few systems instead use a highly elliptical orbit with inclination of +/−63.4 degrees and orbital period of about twelve hours, known as a Molniya orbit.|$|E
5000|$|There {{are five}} major {{components}} in a satellite system: the programming source, the broadcast center, the satellite, the satellite dish, and the receiver. [...] "Direct broadcast" [...] satellites used for transmission of satellite television signals are generally in geostationary orbit 37,000 km above the earth's equator. [...] The reason for using this orbit {{is that the}} satellite circles the Earth {{at the same rate}} as the Earth rotates, so the satellite appears at a fixed point in the sky. Thus satellite dishes can be aimed permanently at that point, and don't need a tracking system to turn to follow a <b>moving</b> <b>satellite.</b> A few satellite TV systems use satellites in a Molniya orbit, a highly elliptical orbit with inclination of +/-63.4 degrees and orbital period of about twelve hours.|$|E

INTRODUCTION In third generation mobile communications systems hierarchical cell structures will be used. Hierarchical cell structures include cells at several levels, e. g., pico, micro, macro and umbrella cell level. Satellites are capable to serve large regions.

30|$|In this paper, the {{specific}} error formula for the inter-satellite motion on the two-way clock offset measurement is deduced in details {{based on the}} measuring principle of inter-satellite two-way clock offset. The specific influence of satellite motion on the inter-satellite two-way clock offset measurement is analyzed with the formula, and the calibration method eliminating the influence of satellite motion is proposed. The simulation result of inter-satellite clock offset measurement indicates that the least square one fitting {{is used in the}} calibration method to process the inter-satellite clock offset data. The precision of clock offset measurement is better than 1  ns when the time period for clock offset measurement is basically symmetric compared with the moment at the inter-satellite distance change rate of 0 and the influence of simulation error is contained. If the data processing method with higher precision is used in the actual inter-satellite clock offset measurement, the precision of clock offset measurement can be further improved to meet the high-precision demand on inter-satellite independent clock offset measurement for various <b>moving</b> <b>satellites.</b> The satellite clock offset prediction algorithm with higher precision will be used in the future to further improve the correction ability of the algorithm on the influence of satellite motion combined with the inter-satellite clock offset measured data processing algorithm.|$|R

40|$|Satellite {{measurements}} of field-aligned auroral electron precipitation have been analyzed using 16 months {{of data from}} the OGO 4 auroral particles experiment. As {{can be seen from}} the <b>moving</b> <b>satellite,</b> the anisotropies are of short duration and are most likely to occur when particle fluxes are high. Field-aligned 2. 3 -keV electron precipitation is found in an oval-shaped region primarily in the nighttime hours; maximum probability is at about 70 deg invariant latitude near midnight, congruent to and poleward of the auroral optical emissions in these hours. This precipitation is found to be associated with the high-latitude boundary of auroral electron precipitation during substorm expansion and is characterized by a slightly harder and considerably more intense energy spectrum than typical isotropic precipitation. ...|$|E
40|$|Since 1974, CNES, the French National Space Agency, {{has been}} {{involved}} in the geostationary launch and early operations phases (LEOP) of <b>moving</b> <b>satellites</b> from a transfer orbit delivered by a launcher to a geostationary point.

40|$|Gedankenexperiments have {{consistently}} {{played a major}} role in the development of quantum theory. A paradigmatic example is Wheeler's delayed-choice experiment, a wave-particle duality test that cannot be fully understood using only classical concepts. Here, we implement Wheeler's idea along a satellite-ground interferometer which extends for thousands of kilometers in Space. We exploit temporal and polarization degrees of freedom of photons reflected by a fast <b>moving</b> <b>satellite</b> equipped with retro-reflecting mirrors. We observed the complementary wave-like or particle-like behaviors at the ground station by choosing the measurement apparatus while the photons are propagating from the satellite to the ground. Our results confirm quantum mechanical predictions, demonstrating the need of the dual wave-particle interpretation, at this unprecedented scale. Our work paves the way for novel applications of quantum mechanics in Space links involving multiple photon degrees of freedom. Comment: 4 figure...|$|E
40|$|Quantum {{interference}} {{arising from}} the superposition of states is striking evidence {{of the validity of}} quantum mechanics, confirmed in many experiments and also exploited in applications. However, as for any scientific theory, quantum mechanics is valid within the limits in which it has been experimentally verified. In order to extend such limits, it is necessary to observe quantum interference in unexplored conditions such as moving terminals at large distances in space. Here, we experimentally demonstrate single photon interference at a ground station due to the coherent superposition of two temporal modes reflected by a rapidly <b>moving</b> <b>satellite</b> a thousand kilometers away. The relative speed of the satellite induces a varying modulation in the interference pattern. The measurement of the satellite distance in real time by laser ranging allows us to precisely predict the instantaneous value of the interference phase. We then observed the interference patterns with a visibility up to 67...|$|E
30|$|With this {{experiment}} we can test {{if the two}} parts of the photon wavefunction are delayed with respect to each other according to standard general relativity, and hence we compute the travel times and the time delay according to standard general relativity. As noted in [10], comparing the expected result with the actual outcome of the experiment would allow for discrimination between several possible couplings of the quantum mechanical energy operator with the gravitational potential. We note that in doing so while resorting to, for example, the Parameterized Post-Newtonian (PPN) formalism, one must take care to first remove any source of noise that could overshadow these small effects, such as planetary or lunar ephemeris, as noted in [14] and [15]. However since distinguishing between different gravitational theories is not the main objective of this study, rather than rederive the theoretical analysis therein, we simply generalise the time delay calculation reported in [10] to a more physically relevant case - in particular, that of a <b>moving</b> <b>satellite.</b>|$|E

40|$|The MIT Adaptive Reconnaissance Golay- 3 Optical Satellite (ARGOS) is a {{wide-angle}} Fizeau interferometer spacecraft testbed. Designing a space-based interferometer, {{which requires}} such high tolerances on pointing and alignment for its apertures, presents unique multidisciplinary {{challenges in the}} areas of structural dynamics, controls and multi-aperture phasing active optics. In meeting these challenges, emphasis is placed on modularity in spacecraft subsystems and optics as a means of allowing expandability and upgradeability. For the interferometer to function properly, unique methods of coherent wave front sensing are developed and used for error detection in control of the Fast Steering Mirrors (FSMs). The space environment is simulated by floating ARGOS on a frictionless air-bearing that allows it to track fast <b>moving</b> <b>satellites</b> such as the International Space Station (ISS), planets or point stars. A System Identification is performed on ARGOS to determine its dynamic properties and to design optimal controllers for the Attitude Control System (ACS).

40|$|On-orbit {{servicing}} {{missions are}} {{a new class of}} space missions where a servicer is launched in the orbit of another spacecraft, the client. The servicer navigates to the client with the intention of manipulating it using a robotic arm. The function is to repair, refuelling, de-orbiting or grasping the client that could be a satellite or a space debris left in orbit by previous missions and growing in recent years. Both approach and docking of the two spacecrafts in orbit lead to various challenges in the area of space flight dynamics. This work intends to analyze some phases of the German on-orbit servicing mission DEOS, like the motion of the free client satellite, where particular motions are shown, and its grasping by a servicer in an experimental way using two Light Weight Robot provided by DLR.

40|$|The {{theory of}} special {{relativity}} {{is used to}} analyze some of the physical phenomena associated with space-based coherent Doppler lidars aimed at Earth and the atmosphere. Two important cases of diffuse scattering and retroreflection by lidar targets are treated. For the case of diffuse scattering, we show that for a coaligned transmitter and receiver on the <b>moving</b> <b>satellite,</b> there is no angle between transmitted and returned radiation. However, the ray that enters the receiver does not correspond to a retroreflected ray by the target. For the retroreflection case there is misalignment between the transmitted ray and the received ray. In addition, the Doppler shift in the frequency {{and the amount of}} tip for the receiver aperture when needed are calculated, The error in estimating wind because of the Doppler shift in the frequency due to special relativity effects is examined. The results are then applied to a proposed space-based pulsed coherent Doppler lidar at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center for wind and aerosol backscatter measurements. The lidar uses an orbiting spacecraft with a pulsed laser source and measures the Doppler shift between the transmitted and the received frequencies to determine the atmospheric wind velocities. We show that the special relativity effects are small for the proposed system...|$|E
30|$|Same {{with the}} satellite-ground two-way time synchronization, {{we take the}} {{different}} deviation occurs at each simulation experimental result during the simulation period of inter-satellite two-way clock offset measurement for the influence of satellite motion direction and Sagnac effect on the correction method out of consideration [14]. The satellite motion directions {{at the same time}} length and different time period as well as different time length and different time period are different when simulating and calculating the clock offset data, and the influence on the clock offset fit polynomial error is also different. Especially, the deviation between the clock offset after the correction and actual clock offset is the maximum when the time period for clock offset measurement is asymmetric compared with the moment at the inter-satellite distance change rate of 0. At the actual application of the correction method, the simulation influence on the correction method is reduced for the influence of satellite motion direction and Sagnac effect on the algorithm is contained in the measuring value of T 1 and T 2 [15]. If the high-precision time difference measuring method is used for the <b>moving</b> <b>satellite</b> and the data processing method with higher fitting precision is used, the precision of correction method can be improved further, and the actual clock offset measurement precision will be higher than the result obtained from the simulation.|$|E
40|$|A programmable, real-time, {{digital signal}} {{processing}} (DSP), least-mean-squares (LMS) interference canceler was developed and demonstrated as a successful method of excising the GLONASS satellite L-band downlink signals from the 100 m Green Bank Telescope (GBT). This canceler {{has the potential for}} aiding the observation of redshifted OH lines near 1600 MHz in the presence of GLONASS signals. Our canceler approach is similar to experiments reported by Barnbaum and Bradley, Baan et al., and Kesteven et al. for mitigating ground-based radio frequency interference (RFI), but we add the new features of a tracking dish antenna to follow the satellite for improved cancellation performance, complex adaptive filter coefficients that reduce the required filter length, and a programmable delay line for bulk time delay correction. An analysis of LMS tracking performance for <b>moving</b> <b>satellites</b> is presented, and effective use of a reference antenna distantly located from the telescope is demonstrated. As is expected from the known properties of LMS cancelers, larger filter orders are shown to yield more reliable cancellation and are less sensitive to data time misalignment. GLONASS interference seen by the GBT was suppressed below the noise floor without corrupting a signal that simulated an astronomical source, even with rapid orbital transits and long integration times...|$|R
40|$|The GPS {{satellite}} constellation is dynamic. Earth gravitational forces cause orbits to vary, and solar and lunar gravitational forces produce out-of-plane perturbations. Launch dispersions often result in orbits {{that are not}} nominal. Even the number of satellites in the constellation can vary over time given anticipated and actual satellite failures and routine maintenance. The GPS {{satellite constellation}} is operationally managed to sustain the global-averaged availability of 3 Dnavigation coverage by routinely <b>moving</b> <b>satellites</b> within the constellation. Long-term planners and builders of GPS augmentation systems often use fixed "orbital planes and slots" as defined in various GPS specifications. These reference orbits were meant to inform contractors that build GPS satellites, not users of the GPS, of what is needed {{in the way of}} satellite capability. These documents were not intended to convey that actual GPS satellites are in fixed orbits. In this paper, we discuss the technical balance between operational flexibility and the demands of long-term planners. We show the sensitivity of positioning dilution of precision to perturbations in right ascension of ascending node, mean anomaly and inclination. Lastly, we give examples of how a flexible constellation structure can be adjusted to preserve and manage GPS coverage in a dynamic environment...|$|R

40|$|A {{system for}} {{continuous}} data assimilation is presented and discussed. To simulate the dynamical development a channel {{version of a}} balanced barotropic model is used and geopotential (height) data are assimilated into the models computations as data become available. In the first experiment the updating is performed every 24 th, 12 th and 6 th hours with a given network. The stations are distributed at random in 4 groups in order to simulate 4 areas with different density of stations. Optimum interpolation is performed for {{the difference between the}} forecast and the valid observations. The RMS-error of the analyses is reduced in time, and the error being smaller the more frequent the updating is performed. The updating every 6 th hour yields an error in the analysis less than the RMS-error of the observation. In a second experiment the updating is performed by data from a <b>moving</b> <b>satellite</b> with a side-scan capability of about 15 °. If the satellite data are analysed at every time step before they are introduced into the system the error of the analysis is reduced to a value below the RMS-error of the observation already after 24 hours and yields as a whole a better result than updating from a fixed network. If the satellite data are introduced without any modification the error of the analysis is reduced much slower and it takes about 4 days to reach a comparable result to the one where the data have been analysed...|$|E
40|$|Type I von Willebrand's disease (vWd) is {{characterized}} by a concomitant decrease in plasma of von Willebrand factor antigen (vWf:Ag) and vWf ristocetin cofactor activity (vWf:RCoF), associated with the presence of all-size multimers. As a rule, {{there is no evidence of}} intrinsic abnormality in vWf. We describe a family with type I vWd with an abnormal plasma vWf multimer pattern. Analysis of plasma vWf multimeric structure by short-SDS-agarose gel electrophoresis showed an abnormal banding pattern for each vWf oligomer, which was organized as a doublet instead of the normal triplet. The electrophoretic mobility of each component appeared to be normal. Multimeric analysis on a long gel showed all the bands that were detectable in normal subjects, but unlike normals the fast <b>moving</b> <b>satellite</b> stained as the major component. The platelet vWf multimer pattern was normal. The infusion of DDAVP normalized vWf:Ag, vWf:RCoF and VIII:C, but not the abnormal multimer pattern observed on both short- and long-gel electrophoresis. The return of factor VIII/vWf complex to the baseline condition was more rapid than that observed in normal subjects or classic type I vWd patients. Analysis of the subunit fragments in the patients' plasma vWf demonstrated a relatively greater proportion, compared to the normal counterpart, of a 115 (140) -kD fragment, which derives from the aminoterminal region of the mature molecule; in contrast, no intact subunit was detectable. These findings indicate a new, previously unreported, variant of type I vWd, which {{is characterized}} by plasma vWf oligomers organized as doublets, instead of triplets. The reduced post-DDAVP half-life, and the abnormal subunit fragments of vWf, suggest a molecule characterized by an increased susceptibility to proteolytic degradation. As a result, the decrease in circulating vWf levels may be due to an instability of the abnormal vWf, rather than, or in addition to, a decrease in its synthesis...|$|E
