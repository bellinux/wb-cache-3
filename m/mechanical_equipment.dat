The recorded vibration signals were first divided into multi-segments.

Consequently, we can monitor the work conditions and fault diagnosis for the <b>mechanical</b> <b>equipments</b> by the compared analysis of the corresponding histogram maps of equipments with normal and abnormal work conditions. The results show that present method exhibits a very strong sensitivity to the changes of vibration signal, leading to the fine detection of the minor changes form the equipment work conditions.

40|$|AbstractMechanical {{equipments}} {{are widely}} used in various industrial applications. Generally working in severe conditions, <b>mechanical</b> <b>equipments</b> are subjected to progressive deterioration of their state. The mechanical failures {{account for more than}} 60 % of breakdowns of the system. Therefore, the identification of impending mechanical fault is crucial to prevent the system from malfunction. This paper discusses the most recent progress in the mechanical condition monitoring and fault diagnosis. Excellent work is introduced from the aspects of the fault mechanism research, signal processing and feature extraction, fault reasoning research and equipment development. An overview of some of the existing methods for signal processing and feature extraction is presented. The advantages and disadvantages of these techniques are discussed.

5|$|The main design {{differences}} with the Nclass included the cab front, exhaust arrangements, {{and the addition of}} an extra (inside) cylinder between the frames to drive the centre driving axle. Clayton had revised the layout of the cab front spectacle plates (small windows {{on the front of the}} cab) to improve forward visibility. This incorporated two large single panes of glass either side of the boiler instead of the four smaller windows used on the Nclass. The inside cylinder was to be actuated by Holcroft's design of conjugated valve gear, which consisted of mechanical links fitted to both sets of outside Walschaerts gear, eliminating the need for a separate set of valve gear between the frames to operate the inside cylinder. The result would be a reduction in weight and the amount of <b>mechanical</b> <b>equipment</b> located in this inaccessible part of the locomotive.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, it {{had been}} known since 1748 that it was {{possible}} to artificially chill water with <b>mechanical</b> <b>equipment</b> and attempts were made in the late 1850s to produce artificial ice on a commercial scale. Various methods had been invented to do this, including Jacob Perkins's diethyl ether vapor-compression refrigeration engine, invented in 1834; engines that used pre-compressed air; John Gorrie's air cycle engines; and ammonia-based approaches such as those championed by Ferdinand Carré and Charles Tellier. The resulting product was variously called plant or artificial ice, but there were numerous obstacles to manufacturing it commercially. Producing plant ice required large amounts of fuel, in the form of coal, and capital for machinery, so producing ice at a competitive price was challenging. The early technology was unreliable and for many decades ice plants faced the risk of explosions and consequent damage to the surrounding buildings. Ammonia based approaches potentially left hazardous ammonia in the ice from where it had leaked through the joints of machinery. For most of the 19th century, plant ice was not as clear as much natural ice, sometimes left white residue when it melted and was generally regarded as less suitable for human consumption than the natural product.|$|E
