5|$|The {{final stage}} {{occurs when a}} massive star begins {{producing}} iron. Since iron nuclei are <b>more</b> <b>tightly</b> bound than any heavier nuclei, any fusion beyond iron does not produce a net release of energy. To a very limited degree such a process proceeds, but it consumes energy. Likewise, since they are <b>more</b> <b>tightly</b> bound than all lighter nuclei, such energy cannot be released by fission.|$|E
5|$|In {{front of}} {{the upper part of}} the cervix lies the bladder, {{separated}} from it by cellular connective tissue known as parametrium, which also extends over the sides of the cervix. To the rear, the supravaginal cervix is covered by peritoneum, which runs onto the back of the vaginal wall and then turns upwards and onto the rectum, forming the recto-uterine pouch. The cervix is <b>more</b> <b>tightly</b> connected to surrounding structures than the rest of the uterus.|$|E

He even {{took it to the}} point where he had to operate his landing flaps as not to fall down, because, of course he had to fly his curve (turns) <b>more</b> <b>tightly</b> than the upper defensive circle. He and his fighter were one unit, and he was in command of that aircraft like no-one else.|$|E

5000|$|Lyssacinosa (also {{known as}} Lyssacinosida) is {{an order of}} glass sponges {{belonging}} to the subclass Hexasterophora.

5|$|Slow-tight {{inhibition}} {{occurs when}} the initial enzyme–inhibitor complex EI undergoes isomerisation to a second <b>more</b> <b>tightly</b> held complex, EI*, but the overall inhibition process is reversible. This manifests itself as slowly increasing enzyme inhibition. Under these conditions, traditional Michaelis–Menten kinetics give a false value for Ki, which is time–dependent. The true value of Ki can be obtained through more complex analysis of the on (kon) and off (koff) rate constants for inhibitor association. See irreversible inhibition below for more information.|$|E
5|$|A random {{assemblage}} of fish merely using some localised resource {{such as food}} or nesting sites is known simply as an aggregation. When fish come together in an interactive, social grouping, then they may be forming either a shoal or a school depending {{on the degree of}} organisation. A shoal is a loosely organised group where each fish swims and forages independently but is attracted to other members of the group and adjusts its behaviour, such as swimming speed, so that it remains close to {{the other members of the}} group. Schools of fish are much <b>more</b> <b>tightly</b> organised, synchronising their swimming so that all fish move at the same speed and in the same direction. Shoaling and schooling behaviour is believed to provide a variety of advantages.|$|E
5|$|Binary stars form a {{significant}} portion of the total population of stellar systems, with up to half of all stars occurring in binary systems. Numerical simulations of globular clusters have demonstrated that binaries can hinder and even reverse the process of core collapse in globular clusters. When a star in a cluster has a gravitational encounter with a binary system, a possible result is that the binary becomes <b>more</b> <b>tightly</b> bound and kinetic energy is added to the solitary star. When the massive stars in the cluster are sped up by this process, it reduces the contraction at the core and limits core collapse.|$|E
30|$|These {{observations}} lead us {{to conclude}} that there are substantial structural differences in the fundamental patterns of social connectivity among politically left- and right-leaning Twitter users, a finding supported by the seminal work of Adamic and Glance [34] on the connectivity patterns of high-profile partisan bloggers. Specifically, the right-leaning community is much more densely interconnected, with <b>more</b> users <b>tightly</b> integrated into the right-leaning social network. In contrast, the network of follower/followee relations among left-leaning users exhibits a much more decentralized, loosely-interconnected structure, with far fewer mutually-affirmed social connections.|$|R

5|$|Elements in {{the same}} period show trends in atomic radius, {{ionization}} energy, electron affinity, and electronegativity. Moving left to right across a period, atomic radius usually decreases. This occurs because each successive element has an added proton and electron, which causes the electron to be drawn closer to the nucleus. This decrease in atomic radius also causes the ionization energy to increase when moving from left to right across a period. The <b>more</b> <b>tightly</b> bound an element is, the more energy is required to remove an electron. Electronegativity increases {{in the same}} manner as ionization energy because of the pull exerted on the electrons by the nucleus. Electron affinity also shows a slight trend across a period. Metals (left side of a period) generally have a lower electron affinity than nonmetals (right side of a period), with the exception of the noble gases.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to playing the game, Adams {{was involved in}} the production of early baseball equipment. He personally manufactured baseballs for a period of time, supplying many New York City-based clubs. Adams found that when the ball was <b>more</b> <b>tightly</b> stitched, it traveled further when batted or thrown. According to author Peter Morris, Adams' ball-manufacturing efforts helped to keep the Knickerbockers in operation during their first few years, as they would otherwise have had difficulty finding balls. In later years Adams gathered rubber from old galoshes for the insides of baseballs. A tanner then used horsehide to create the balls. As late as 1863, Adams was one of the three most prominent makers of baseballs in New York, continuing to produce them by hand. Adams also played a role in producing baseball bats, choosing which wood to use and overseeing the manufacturing process.|$|E
5|$|Most {{stars are}} {{observed}} {{to be members}} of binary star systems, and the properties of those binaries are the result of the conditions in which they formed. A gas cloud must lose its angular momentum in order to collapse and form a star. The fragmentation of the cloud into multiple stars distributes some of that angular momentum. The primordial binaries transfer some angular momentum by gravitational interactions during close encounters with other stars in young stellar clusters. These interactions tend to split apart more widely separated (soft) binaries while causing hard binaries to become <b>more</b> <b>tightly</b> bound. This produces the separation of binaries into their two observed populations distributions.|$|E

25|$|Acetylated histones, octameric {{proteins}} that organize chromatin into nucleosomes and ultimately higher order structures, represent {{a type of}} epigenetic marker within chromatin. Acetylation removes the positive charge on the histones, thereby decreasing {{the interaction of the}} N termini of histones with the negatively charged phosphate groups of DNA. As a consequence, the condensed chromatin is transformed into a more relaxed structure that is associated with greater levels of gene transcription. This relaxation can be reversed by HDAC activity. Relaxed, transcriptionally active DNA is referred to as euchromatin. <b>More</b> condensed (<b>tightly</b> packed) DNA is referred to as heterochromatin. Condensation can be brought about by processes including deacetylation and methylation; the action of methylation is indirect and has no effect upon charge.|$|R
5|$|Some {{very large}} events known as fests (short for festival) have {{hundreds}} or thousands of participants who are usually split into competing character factions camped separately around a large venue. There are relatively few fests in the world, all based in Europe and Canada; however, their size means that they have a significant influence on local LARP culture and design. At {{the other end of the}} size scale, some small events known as linear or line-course LARPs feature a small group of PCs facing a series of challenges from NPCs and are often <b>more</b> <b>tightly</b> planned and controlled by GMs than other styles of LARP.|$|E
5|$|Henry's {{itinerant}} royal court comprised various parts. At {{the heart}} was Henry's domestic household, called the domus; a wider grouping was termed the familia regis, and formal gatherings {{of the court}} were termed curia. The domus was divided into several parts. The chapel, headed by the chancellor, looked after the royal documents, the chamber dealt with financial affairs and the master-marshal was responsible for travel and accommodation. The familia regis included Henry's mounted household troops, up to several hundred strong, who came from {{a wider range of}} social backgrounds, and could be deployed across England and Normandy as required. Initially Henry continued his father's practice of regular crown-wearing ceremonies at his curia, but they became less frequent as the years passed. Henry's court was grand and ostentatious, financing the construction of large new buildings and castles with a range of precious gifts on display, including the King's private menagerie of exotic animals, which he kept at Woodstock Palace. Despite being a lively community, Henry's court was <b>more</b> <b>tightly</b> controlled than those of previous kings. Strict rules controlled personal behaviour and prohibited members of the court from pillaging neighbouring villages, as had been the norm under William Rufus.|$|E
5|$|In {{the seventeenth}} century the pursuit of {{witchcraft}} was largely {{taken over by the}} kirk sessions and was often used to attack superstitious and Catholic practices in Scottish society. Most of the accused, some 75 per cent, were women, with over 1,500 executed, and the witch hunt in Scotland has been seen as a means of controlling women. The most intense witch hunt was in 1661–62, which involved some 664 named witches in four counties. From this point prosecutions began to decline as trials were <b>more</b> <b>tightly</b> controlled by the judiciary and government, torture was more sparingly used and standards of evidence were raised. B. P. Levack suggests that there may also have been a growing scepticism and with relative peace and stability the economic and social tensions that contributed to accusation may have reduced. There were occasional local outbreaks like that in East Lothian in 1678 and 1697 at Paisley. The last recorded executions were in 1706 and the last trial in 1727. The British parliament repealed the 1563 Act in 1736.|$|E

At the outset they emphazise that {{the way in which}} leaders and elites affect each other is a knotty problem in political analysis. If a shift toward more forceful leaders is occurring in liberal democracies then a comparable shift in elites must also be occurring. From the essential principles underlying Vilfredo Pareto’s, Max Weber’s and other well-known elite theories, the authors intend to explore the thesis that this is a time of increasingly forceful leaders embedded in <b>more</b> aggressive, <b>tightly</b> organized, and mutually antagonistic elites in at least some liberal democracies. Upon this basis the researchers examine elite and leadership changes that appear to be impelled by extraordinary conditions during the past twenty-five years...|$|R
5|$|Prosecutions {{began to}} decline as trials were <b>more</b> <b>tightly</b> {{controlled}} by the judiciary and government, torture was more sparingly used and standards of evidence were raised. The exposure of prickers as frauds in 1662 removed a major form of evidence. The Lord Advocate George Mackenzie made efforts to make prosecutions ineffective. There {{may also have been}} a growing popular scepticism, and, with relative peace and stability, the economic and social tensions that may have contributed to accusations were reduced, although there were occasional local outbreaks, like those in East Lothian in 1678 and in Paisley in 1697. The last executions in the records of the central courts were in 1706. The last trial was held in the court of a sheriff-depute at Dornoch in 1727, and was of questionable legality. The British parliament repealed the 1563 Act in 1736, making the legal pursuit of witches impossible. Nevertheless, basic magical beliefs persisted, particularly in the Highlands and Islands.|$|E
5|$|Caesar then {{increased}} the number of magistrates who were elected each year, which created a large pool of experienced magistrates, and allowed Caesar to reward his supporters. Caesar even took steps to transform Italy into a province, and to <b>more</b> <b>tightly</b> link the other provinces of the empire into a single, cohesive unit. This process, of ossifying the entire Roman Empire into a single unit, rather than maintaining it as a network of unequal principalities, would ultimately be completed by Caesar's successor, the emperor Augustus. When Caesar returned to Rome in 47 BC, he raised the senate's membership to 900. While the Roman assemblies continued to meet, Caesar submitted all candidates to the assemblies for election, and all bills to the assemblies for enactment, which caused the assemblies to become powerless and unable to oppose him. To minimize the risk that another general might attempt to challenge him, Caesar passed a law which subjected governors to term limits. Near the end of his life, Caesar began to prepare for a war against the Parthian Empire. Since his absence from Rome might limit his ability to install his own Consuls, he passed a law which allowed him to appoint all magistrates in 43 BC, and all Consuls and Tribunes in 42 BC. This, in effect, transformed the magistrates from being representatives of the people to being representatives of the Dictator, and robbed the popular assemblies of much of their remaining influence.|$|E
