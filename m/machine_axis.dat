50|$|Most {{wrapping}} machine designs carry a single drum of cable {{on one side}} of the machine and therefore require a counterweight on the opposite side to provide lateral stability. As a minimum, the counterweight is adjustable at each pole or tower to reflect the reduced weight of the payload at the end of each span. The more sophisticated designs of {{wrapping machine}}s have automatically adjusting counterweights that maintain balance throughout the span as the cable drum becomes progressively lighter. This is normally achieved by arranging for the counterweight move inwards towards the <b>machine</b> <b>axis</b> as the machine travels forward. Such devices are essential for span lengths greater than 250 - 300m. Ideally, the centre of gravity of the rotating part of the wrapping machine should lie on the axis of the host conductor at all times. The centre of gravity of the complete wrapping machine will always be below the axis of the host conductor.|$|E

Following this, the influence of different jerk values on surface topography and roughness has been investigated {{with a set of}} experiments. Secondly, the demands on the design of machine tool frames for the realisation of high jerk values are discussed and a new concept for micro milling machine tool frames is proposed. The concept is based on a mechanical structure as the frame, which is of a stiff design in the direction perpendicular to the respective <b>machine</b> tool <b>axis</b> and of a compliant design {{in the direction of the}} respective <b>machine</b> tool <b>axis.</b> The compliancy allows for compensation of the dynamic dislocation by use of correction movements of the machine tool axes. An open control system is used capable of integrating complex models of the mechanical structure. These models and additional sensors are evaluated simultaneously during machine tool run time so that they become part of the machine tool control.

50|$|The {{turning moment}} arises because the {{wrapping}} machine passes a heavy drum of cable around the <b>machine</b> <b>axis</b> {{so as to}} wrap the fibre optic cable onto the host conductor. This motion is achieved {{by means of a}} gearbox that converts the linear travel of the wrapping machine along the conductor into a rotating movement of the drum carrier. The force of moving the drum in one direction (say clockwise around the conductor) causes a resultant force to act on the machine in the opposite direction, making the wrapping machine spin on its own axis (counter-clockwise in this example). Frictional effects from the machine’s grip on the conductor can be used to counter this to some degree, but in practice it is insufficient and the required stability can only be achieved by having a relatively large weight suspended rigidly below the conductor from the non-rotating part of the wrapping machine. The motor unit is heavy, has a good grip on the conductor and so is often used to provide the necessary stability. For rope-pulled machines with no motor unit, a separate ‘keel weight’ is used to achieve the same effect.|$|E

The determination of the accuracy of such five <b>axis</b> <b>machine</b> however is often difficult or problematic. A significant increase {{is seen in the}} certification efforts involved for this industry sector. To assess the accuracy of a five <b>axis</b> <b>machine</b> within one minute a dedicated Rotary Inspector system has been developed by IBS Precision Engineering. With this measurement system a 3 D measuring head is used in combination with a masterball while the machine executes a certain cycle using multiple machine axes simultaneously. Typical tests are specified in ISO 10791 - 6 (e. g. AK 1, BK 4, CK 4) and these are used in this paper to determine the machine's accuracy first, representing normal (milling) machine use. Usually test work pieces are made on a machine and its geometrical deviations are checked on a CMM for certification. The relation between these geometrical test work piece deviations and the measured ISO machine error parameters of the rotary axes is addressed in this paper. In this way the need of milling (many) test work pieces can be reduced significantly for certification purposes...|$|R
