The area surrounding Nuka-World includes: Bradberton, a town built to house park employees, the defunct Nuka-World power plant, Grandchester, a haunted mansion and tourist attraction, and the Nuka-World scrapyard containing a UFO-themed carnival ride which the Hubologists are convinced is a genuine spaceship.|$|E

Other defined VMCs include minimum control speed on the ground (VMCG) and minimum control speed during approach and landing (VMCL).

2500|$|A Marine {{operator}} may shoot {{as many as}} 80,000 rounds {{from this}} pistol during a training-cycle and subsequent deployment. However, it is more common for a Marine to return the pistol to the PWS at Quantico for a rebuild after 10,000 rounds have been fired.

[...] The V3X seats up to 9 people, and has various body styles to accommodate different military missions, including a ballistic protection encasing. For ease of use and transport, the vehicle is air lift rated for a CH47, UH60 and other aircraft. [...] Engineered with 80% COTS parts, the V3X makes any in-field repairs streamlined and reliable.|$|E

2500|$|In 1963 Fairchild's analog IC lineup, {{designed}} to <b>military</b> <b>specifications,</b> {{consisted of three}} amplifier circuits. Fairchild engineers before Widlar designed analog ICs like conventional circuits built with discrete devices. They had already realized the severe limitations of early planar process, which made this approach impractical, but had not proposed working alternatives (active loads and active current sources {{had yet to be}} invented). When the original schematic required resistor values that were too low or too high for planar process, the designers employed external nichrome thin film resistors. The resulting hybrid ICs performed poorly and were prohibitively expensive. Fairchild's R chief Gordon Moore directed the company to favor digital integrated circuits, which were relatively robust and promised high production volumes. Widlar opposed this strategy and held digital electronics in low esteem: [...] "every idiot can count to one". Talbert shared Widlar's belief and became his closest ally in the company.|$|E
