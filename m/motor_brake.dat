25|$|All {{units were}} formed of four cars. When {{originally}} built, units were numbered {{in the range}} 01s-32s, and were composed of two outer driving trailers, an intermediate trailer composite (i.e. with some first-class seating), and an intermediate <b>motor</b> <b>brake.</b> The units were constructed to operate off the 1,500 V direct current (DC) overhead power system used on Eastern Region suburban lines. However, in the late 1950s and early 1960s, these lines were converted to the 6.25 kV/25 kV alternating current (AC) overhead system, which was adopted as standard, and coincided {{with the introduction of}} new Class 302 (AM2) units. Therefore, from 1960-1962 the entire AM7 fleet was extensively rebuilt at Eastleigh Works to allow units to operate from the new voltage system. The work including moving the guard's compartment from the motor coach to one of the driving trailers. At the same time, units were renumbered into the range 101-132.|$|E
2500|$|... 194 {{standard}} four-car {{units were}} built between 1967 and 1974, numbered 7701-7894. They were subsequently renumbered in the 1980s into the 30xx and 31xx series, {{in order to}} make numbers TOPS compliant. Between 1988 and 1990 the units were internally facelifted. The work involved fitting fluorescent lighting and public address equipment, and also rebuilding the MBS (<b>motor</b> <b>brake</b> second) vehicles with an additional two bays of seating in space formerly used for luggage. On refurbishment only the first 20 units were renumbered in order, in the 34xx series. All other units were renumbered from 3421 onwards, in the order they were refurbished. All units ended up swapping motor vehicles on refurbishment - the additional work on these cars made the work take longer than that carried out on trailer vehicles.|$|E

40|$|Traditional {{friction}} <b>braking</b> {{torque and}} <b>motor</b> <b>braking</b> torque {{can be used}} in braking for electric vehicles (EVs). A sliding mode controller (SMC) based on the exponential reaching law for the anti-lock braking system (ABS) is developed to maintain the optimal slip value. Parameter optimizing is applied to the reaching law by fuzzy logic control (FLC). A regenerative braking algorithm, in which the motor torque is taken full advantage of, is adopted to distribute the braking force between the <b>motor</b> <b>braking</b> and the hydraulic braking. Simulations were carried out with Matlab/Simulink. By comparing with a conventional Bang-bang ABS controller, braking stability and passenger comfort is improved with the proposed SMC controller, and the chatting phenomenon is reduced effectively with the parameter optimizing by FLC. With the increasing proportion of the <b>motor</b> <b>braking</b> torque, the tracking of the slip ratio is more rapid and accurate. Furthermore, the braking distance is shortened and the conversion energy is enhanced...|$|R

5000|$|Power off brakes stop or hold a load when {{electrical}} power is either accidentally lost or intentionally disconnected. In the past, {{some companies have}} referred to these as [...] "fail safe" [...] brakes. These brakes are typically used on or near an electric motor. Typical applications include robotics, holding brakes for Z axis ball screws and servo <b>motor</b> <b>brakes.</b> Brakes are available in multiple voltages and can have either standard backlash or zero backlash hubs. Multiple disks {{can also be used}} to increase brake torque, without increasing brake diameter. There are 2 main types of holding brakes. The first is spring applied brakes. The second is permanent magnet brakes.|$|R
50|$|Each {{unit was}} formed of a Driving <b>Motor</b> <b>Brake</b> Third (seating 52); a Trailer Composite (seating 24 first class and 38 third class passengers); and a Driving Trailer Third (seating 60). Third class was redesignated Second {{across the whole}} of BR on 3 June 1956, while the first class seating of these units was declassified to second in early 1960.|$|E
50|$|The DMBT (Driving <b>Motor</b> <b>Brake</b> Third) had a full-width cab with a guard's {{compartment}} behind, {{and seven}} third class compartments seating 70. The TC (Trailer Composite) had five first-class and four third-class compartments seating 40 in each class. The TCL (Trailer Composite with Lavatory) had five first-class and three third-class compartments seating 30 and 24, respectively, with a toilet at each end.|$|E
50|$|Coach numbers 11001 and 11002 were {{prototype}} driving <b>motor</b> <b>brake</b> {{vehicles for}} the mainline stock {{that was being}} developed for the London to Brighton electrification.

50|$|The first fifteen {{units were}} {{delivered}} to Longsight Depot, Manchester from April 1960 as four-car sets, and were originally numbered 001-015. Built by British Rail's Wolverton Works, these units were an aesthetic {{improvement over the}} AM2 (Class 302) units previously built at York and Doncaster; they featured a new design cab end with a raked back upper area, following a Design Panel recommendation, and emerged in Multiple Unit Green livery, lined out with yellow. The units followed the two-car 1,200V DC Class 504 units off the production line at Wolverton, a class which shared many design features with the first AM4 units. The units were arranged into four-car sets, consisting of: a Driving Trailer Brake Open vehicle with 82 second class seats (saloon) and a Guard's compartment; a Trailer Composite with 19 first class seats (compartment) and 60 second class seats (saloon), and two toilets; a <b>Motor</b> <b>Brake</b> with 96 second class seats (compartment) and a Guard's compartment; a Driving Trailer with 82 second class seats (saloon), two toilets, and battery equipment. One result of the <b>Motor</b> <b>Brake</b> vehicle having a compartment design was that the window layout on all vehicles was designed to suit, having a narrow window either side of each door. The units were tested on the Styal line {{prior to the start}} of electric services between Crewe and Manchester.|$|E
50|$|Both lines operate {{independently}} in shuttle mode with a {{total capacity}} of up to 2,180 pphpd.

50|$|A normal {{formation}} {{was three}} vehicles- a Driving <b>Motor</b> <b>Brake</b> Second (DMBS) which had two BUT engines (Later fitted with Leyland), a driving compartment(cab), 65 second class seats, guards accommodation and luggage/parcels space, a Trailer Composite Lavatory (TCL) {{which had no}} engines or driving compartment, but had 22 first class seats, 48 second class seats and a lavatory, and a Driving Motor Second (DMS), which like the DMBS had two engines and a driver's cab, and contained 89 second class seats. Having the 'blue square' multiple working system allowed them to run in formations containing up to 12 cars with most of BR's other DMUs.|$|E
50|$|The {{first batch}} of thirty-six units were {{built on the}} {{reclaimed}} underframes of older 2 NOL units, to the old SR-style Bulleid design and numbered in the range 5601-5636. These units had the formation Driving <b>Motor</b> <b>Brake</b> Open Second (DMBSO) + Driving Trailer Composite with lavatory (DTCK). In 1969, the first class seating in 12 units was downgraded in the DTCKL, becoming DTSK. The units were then reclassified as 2-SAP. First class was restored in 1970 and they regained their former identities. All were withdrawn by 1982, with the DMBSO getting refurbished and integrated into the class 415 refurbishment programme. The DTSKs were scrapped.|$|E
5000|$|From 1913 an {{experimental}} electric service operated between Bury and Holcombe Brook. The equipment {{was provided by}} Dick, Kerr & Co. of Preston, which was developing its products for overseas sales. It used was 3.5 kV DC overhead, and four cars, two driving <b>motor</b> <b>brake</b> thirds and two driving trailer thirds, were built at the LYR's Newton Heath works. The motor cars had two motors, one [...] and the other , and seated 75 passengers. The trailers seated 85 passengers. In 1918 the line was converted to the 1200 V DC system chosen for the Bury line and the cars stored before being converted into {{an experimental}} 4-car diesel-electric unit in 1927.|$|E
50|$|If {{the motors}} are {{attached}} to the vehicle body, flexible couplings are required but not if the traction motors are integrated into the wheels. One disadvantage is that the unsprung mass increases and suspension responsiveness decreases, which impacts ride and potentially safety. However the impact should be minimal as electric motors in wheel hubs such as Hi-Pa Drive, may be very small and light having exceptionally high power-to-weight ratios and braking mechanisms can be lighter as the wheel <b>motors</b> <b>brake</b> the vehicle.|$|R
