50|$|Explosive atmospheres have {{different}} chemical properties {{that affect the}} likelihood and severity of an explosion. Such properties include flame temperature, minimum ignition energy, upper and lower explosive limits, and molecular weight. Empirical testing is done to determine parameters such as the maximum experimental safe gap (MESG), <b>minimum</b> <b>igniting</b> current (MIC) ratio, explosion pressure and time to peak pressure, spontaneous ignition temperature, and maximum rate of pressure rise. Every substance has a differing combination of properties but {{it is found that}} they can be ranked into similar ranges, simplifying the selection of equipment for hazardous areas.|$|R
5000|$|Pas Yisroel or Pat Yisrael (פת ישראל lit:"Bread of an Israelite") {{products}} are grain-products that were cooked or baked {{with the participation}} of an observant Jew. The observant Jew must, at <b>minimum,</b> <b>ignite</b> the flame used to prepare, cook, or bake the grain product. In classical Rabbinic Judaism, this requirement is considered restricted to the five classical grains of Judaism - wheat, barley, oats, spelt, and rye. In the modern food-production industry, commercial bakeries may accomplish a status of Pas Yisroel {{by the use of}} something called the [...] "Shain system", (named for the inventor, Rabbi Yehuda Shain) whereby an entire apparatus can be ignited remotely by an observant Jew.|$|R
40|$|Different scale {{tests to}} explore the {{influence}} of fiberglass mesh on the fire behaviour of EPS (expanded polystyrene) have been conducted. Micro-scale Combustion Calorimeter (MCC) to measure the heat release rate per unit mass, heat release capacity and the total heat release of EPS and as well as the fiberglass for milligram specimen mass has been used. Cone colorimeter bench scale burning tests with the EPS specimens and EPS-fiberglass compound specimens have been carried out. The heat release rate per unit area, ignition times, and the derived <b>minimum</b> <b>igniting</b> heat fluxes were determined. Comparative burning tests on the fire spread tendency of EPS and EPS-fiberglass compound specimens have been carried out. It was established that the fiberglass mesh stabilizes the EPS fire as a wick fire due to the adherence of the melting polystyrene adheres to the fiberglass mesh and this causes an upwards fire spread...|$|R
40|$|The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, Pittsburgh Research Laboratory {{conducted}} a study of laser safety in potentially flammable environments. Researchers measured threshold igniting powers {{as a function of}} beam diameter for butane and propane-air mixtures by laser-heating targets placed on optical fiber tips using a 1064 nm laser. The <b>minimum</b> <b>igniting</b> powers for propane-air and butane-air were about 250 and 300 mW, respectively. Threshold igniting powers for propane-air were approximately proportional to beam diameter for beam diameters from 0. 1 to 2. 0 mm. Results suggest that relatively powerful beams may be used in these atmospheres without causing ignition, provided the beam diameter is controlled. Threshold ignition delay times using 91125 and 62. 51 125 pm fibers were approximately proportional to the inverse square of the laser power. Ignition delays were about 45 ms or longer for laser powers up to 800 mW. Preproduction samples of a commercial optical fuse prevented ignitions under selected test conditions. A self-healing effect was observed for one sample. Comparisons are made with the results of other researchers. O 2006 Laser Institute of America.

40|$|Fiber optic {{systems are}} being {{deployed}} in locations where {{explosive gas atmospheres}} are normally present or are present under fault conditions. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, Pittsburgh Research Laboratory (NIOSH, PRL) conducted a study of laser safety in potentially flammable environments. Researchers conducted experiments to estimate the {{mean and standard deviation}} of laser powers needed to ignite 6 % methane-air atmospheres using single mode optical fiber tips covered by two types of iron oxide (Fe 304 and (FeMn) 203) mixed with a ceramic adhesive. The iron oxides, heated by a 1064 nm continuous wave laser, ignited the methane-air mixtures,at similar powers. The <b>minimum</b> <b>igniting</b> power and maximum non-igniting power (10 tests) were 407 and 350 mW, respectively, using a 62. 5 pm fiber. Laser beams guided by 125 and 80 pm diameter cladding single mode fibers produced similar methane-air igniting powers. Ignition was not observed using coal particles at powers that produced ignition with the iron oxides. Threshold ignition delays using the single mode fiber were approxinlately proportional to the inverse square of the igniting power. Ignition delays were significantly longer than the reported activation time for a comnlercial fiber optic power limiter. Comparisons are made with the results of other researchers.

40|$|Emerging laser {{technologies}} are quickly gaining acceptance {{in the industrial}} workplace. Besides the risk of human exposure, one safety concern with the more intense lasers {{is the potential for}} ignition of flammable gases, vapors, dusts, fibers, or flyings often found in hazardous (classified) industrial settings. In underground coal mines, lasers are being considered for remote measurement of explosive methane gas. Current federal safety regulations for underground mines contain no specific guidance for evaluating the safety of optoelectronic components such as diode lasers. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health is conducting research to help provide a scientific basis for developing appropriate safety guidelines for optical equipment in the presence of flammable methane gas and/or coal dust. One phase of the study is an experimental evaluation of methane-air ignition by laser heated small particles. <b>Minimum</b> observed <b>igniting</b> powers for laser energy delivered by 200 -, 400 -, and 800 -um core diameter fiber optic cables and directed onto selected targets in methane-air atmospheres were 0. 6, L l, and 2. 2 W, respectively. Comparisons are made with other ignition phenomena, including heated wires...|$|R
40|$|Optical {{technologies}} have progressed {{rapidly in the}} past 15 years. One application of laser technology in underground coal mines currently under evaluation is the remote measurement of explosive methane gas. Federal regulations require that atmospheric monitoring systems used in gassy underground mines where permissible equipment is required shall be intrinsically safe. Mine Safety and Health Administration criteria for the evaluation and testing of intrinsically safe apparatus and associated apparatus contain no specific guidance for optoelectronic components such as diode lasers. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health is conducting a study to help provide a scientific basis for developing appropriate safety guidelines for optical equipment in under- ground coal mines. Results of experiments involving ignition of methane-air mixtures by collections of small heated particles of Pittsburgh seam coal and black iron oxide are reported. The inert but more strongly absorbing iron oxide targets consistently ignited methane-air mixtures at lower powers than the coal targets. <b>Minimum</b> observed <b>igniting</b> powers for laser energy delivered by 200, 400 and 800 pm core fiber optic cables and directed onto iron oxide targets in methane-air atmospheres were 0. 6, 1. 1, and 2. 2 W, respectively.

40|$|A {{model is}} {{presented}} for the chemical {{evolution of the}} solar neighbourhood which takes into account three families of galactic objects, according to their condensation states: stars, refuses and gas. Stars are defined as every condensed objects with masses {{greater than or equal}} to the <b>minimum</b> mass which <b>ignites</b> hydrogen and which will give rise to an evolutionary track on the HR diagram to the left of Hayashi's limit; refuses include the remnants, which are compact objects resulting from stellar deaths, and the residues, which have masses not large enough to ignite hydrogen; gas is defined as the mass which can be condensed to form stars and/or residues. We have developed equations for the mass evolution of each family, and have studied the gas metallicity distribution within the framework of the instantaneous recycling approximation, adopting different initial conditions. In order to constrain the model parameters we have also used preliminary evaluations of comet cloud masses to investigate the role of the residues as sinks of heavy elements in the Galaxy.
