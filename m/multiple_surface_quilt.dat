40|$|A laser {{ultrasonic}} {{system is a}} non-contact inspection device with a long stand-off distance and it is applicable to hard-to-access locations such as in a nuclear power plant. In this paper, <b>multiple</b> <b>surface</b> waves generated by line-shaped multiple pulse laser beams are adopted to precisely detect a surface-breaking crack with its depth information. When a surface crack is positioned {{at the center of}} multiple pulse laser beams, acquired surface waves are composed of two parts, a reference part and a data part. The reference part is the front part of the acquired <b>multiple</b> <b>surface</b> waves and the data part is the rear part of the surface waves. Detail crack depth information can be extracted from the normalized <b>multiple</b> <b>surface</b> waves by using the reference part. The crack depth information is extracted by acquiring the difference between two peak frequencies of the reference and the data signal. Also, during a scanning test, we can elucidate a crack advent by observing the amplitude variation and frequency spectrum variation of the <b>multiple</b> <b>surface</b> waves when the crack is positioned in the range of the multiple pulse laser beams...|$|R

A fatigue crack growth algorithm for assessing <b>multiple</b> <b>surface</b> crack growth, coalescence and propagation life was initially validated with previously report crack growth data for a fillet shoulder specimen. A new parametric study for single, double, and triple SESCs located along the weld toe line of a fillet weld was investigated with three starting crack depth sizes (a= 0. 1 mm, a= 0. 5 mm, a= 1. 0 mm) coupled with three different crack aspect ratios (a/c= 1. 0, a/c= 0. 5 and 0. 25) giving a total of 27 cases studied.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the problem of}} finite-time cooperative tracking for <b>multiple</b> <b>surface</b> vessels {{in the presence of}} external disturbances. A robust finite-time cooperative tracking algorithm based on terminal sliding-mode control is proposed for <b>multiple</b> <b>surface</b> vessels. In light of the leader-follower strategy, a virtual leader vessel is defined to provide reference point for other surface vessels to form the desired formation. Specifically, the proposed algorithm only requires the communication topology among the surface vessels to be a directed graph with a directed spanning tree. The robustness is achieved by compensating the upper bound of external disturbance in the control input, and the global finite-time stability is proved by Lyapunov stability theory. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed finite-time cooperative tracking control algorithm is demonstrated by simulation results...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} method for the {{incorporation}} of regional image information in a 3 -D graph-theoretic approach for optimal <b>multiple</b> <b>surface</b> segmentation. By transforming the <b>multiple</b> <b>surface</b> segmentation task into finding a minimum-cost closed set in a vertex-weighted graph, the optimal set of feasible surfaces with respect to an objective function can be found. In the past, this family of graph search applications only used objective functions which incorporated “on-surface” costs. Here, novel “in-region” costs are incorporated. Our new approach {{is applied to the}} segmentation of seven intraretinal layer surfaces of 24 3 -D macular optical coherence tomography images from 12 subjects.

40|$|<b>Multiple</b> <b>surface</b> searching {{with only}} image {{intensity}} information {{is a difficult}} job {{in the presence of}} high noise and weak edges. We present in this paper a novel method for globally optimal multi-surface searching with a shape prior represented by convex pairwise energies. A 3 -D graphtheoretic framework is employed. An arc-weighted graph is constructed based on a shape model built from training datasets. A wide spectrum of constraints is then incorporated. The shape prior term penalizes the local topological change from the original shape model. The globally optimal solution for <b>multiple</b> <b>surfaces</b> can be obtained by computing a maximum flow in low-order polynomial time. Compared with other graph-based methods, our approach provides more local and flexible control of the shape. We also prove that our algorithm can handle the detection of <b>multiple</b> crossing <b>surfaces</b> with no shared voxels. Our method was applied to several application problems, including medical image segmentation, scenic image segmentation, and image resizing. Compared with results without using shape prior information, our improvement was quite impressive, demonstrating the promise of our method. 1...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{addresses}} the computational {{role that the}} construction of a complete surface representation may play in the recovery of 3 -D structure from motion. We first discuss the need to integrate surface reconstruction with the structure-from-motion process, both on computational and perceptual grounds. We then present a model that combines a feature-based structure-from-motion algorithm with a smooth surface interpolation mechanism. This model allows <b>multiple</b> <b>surfaces</b> to be represented in a given viewing direction, incorporates constraints on surface structure from object boundaries, and segregates image features onto <b>multiple</b> <b>surfaces</b> {{on the basis of their}} 2 -D image motion. We present the results of computer simulations that relate the qualitative behavior of this model to psychophysical observations. In a companion paper, we discuss further perceptual observations regarding the possible role of surface reconstruction in the human recovery of 3 -D structure from motion...|$|R
40|$|Despite many {{successful}} {{applications of}} robust statistics, {{they have yet}} to be completely adapted to many computer vision problems. Range reconstruction, particularly in unstructured environments, requires a robust estimator that not only tolerates a large outlier percentage but also tolerates several discontinuities, extracting <b>multiple</b> <b>surfaces</b> in an image region. Observing that random outliers and/or points from across discontinuities increase a hypothesized fit's scale estimate (standard deviation of the noise), our new operator, called MUSE (Minimum Unbiased Scale Estimator), evaluates a hypothesized fit over potential inlier sets via an objective function of unbiased scale estimates. MUSE extracts the single best fit from the data by minimizing its objective function over a set of hypothesized fits and can sequentially extract <b>multiple</b> <b>surfaces</b> from an image region. We show MUSE to be effective on synthetic data modelling small scale discontinuities and in preliminary experiments [...] ...|$|R
