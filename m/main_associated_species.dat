Sin embargo, en 1984, en la cima de la Cordillera de Nahuelbuta se encontraron dos poblaciones enanas. En este trabajo se caracterizó la estructura, composición y edades de ambas poblaciones de A. araucana y Nothofagus dombeyi como especie asociada más importante, así como las características físicas y químicas de los suelos donde crecen. El enanismo se manifestó en ambas especies. En A. araucana los individuos raramente sobrepasaron 10 m de altura con una alta relación diámetro/altura respecto a la de árboles normales de edad similar. El crecimiento {{diametral}} anual fue Araucaria araucana (araucaria or pehuén) can normally reach > 20 m {{in height}} in most sites where it grows. However, two dwarf populations of A. Araucana {{were found at}} the top of the Nahuelbuta coastal range. This study had the goal of characterizing the structure, composition, ages and chemical and physical soil properties of both populations. These populations are dominated by A. araucana, with Nothofagus dombeyi as the <b>main</b> <b>associated</b> <b>species.</b> Dwarfism is clear in both species. Individuals of A. araucana rarely exceeded 10 m in height with a high diameter/height relationship compared with similarly-aged normal trees. The diameter annual growth is lower than 0. 12 cm for trees 300 years in age and basal diameters of 36 cm. The presence of short stems and extended and fine branches, like spider legs, confirms the dwarf features of the A. araucana trees. In N. dombeyi 36 to 37 years in age the diameter annual growth is between 0. 26 and 0. 27 cm, where most individuals (60 - 75 %) present basal diameters lower than 15 cm and heights between 1 and 6. 5 m. The location of these populations {{at the top of}} the Nahuelbuta coastal range over 1, 000 m and openly exposed to the Pacific ocean results from extreme weather conditions that combined with poor and thin soils determine the low tree growth, reduced size and tortuous shapes of trees...|$|E

Here is described a new real-time PCR assay that allows specific detection of atypical Chlamydiaceae from pigeons. The assay has been used to assess the dissemination of these strains in field samples collected from Parisian pigeon populations in 2009. The results suggest a limited dissemination compared to the usually higher prevalence of Chlamydia psittaci that is the <b>main</b> <b>species</b> <b>associated</b> with avian chlamydiosis...|$|R
30|$|The <b>main</b> tree <b>species</b> <b>associated</b> with {{livestock}} rearing are chestnuts, poplars, hard wood plantations, Mediterranean oaks, pines and fruit plantations. These form either native or planted stands, with chestnut forests in mountain areas, poplars and hard wood plantations (including especially cherry, walnut, oaks of temperate climates) in the plains, Mediterranean oaks in the plains and low hills, pines in mountains or {{near to the}} coasts according to the different species, fruit plantations of various species (including olives and vines, especially Citrus and hazelnut in the south) are common in flat, hilly and mountainous areas (fruits of temperate climates). The Mediterranean maquis becomes part of agro-silvo-pastoral systems over large areas (Talamucci and Chaulet 1989), though a few exotic species have been planted in flat or mountain areas.|$|R

In this study, we identified the main species that occur in strawberry fields in the states of Paraná and Rio Grande do Sul, Brasil. We also compared the effectiveness of different sampling methods and studied the population dynamics of aphid species during two strawberry crop cycles in the municipality of Pinhais, state of Paraná, Brasil. Chaetosiphon fragaefolii (Cockerell) and Aphis forbesi Weed were the <b>main</b> <b>species</b> <b>associated</b> with strawberry. The method of hit plant and the Möericke trap showed equal effectiveness to capture wingless and winged insects. The peak population of aphids {{in the state of}} Paraná occurred from September to November. This information can help producers to implement strategies to monitor and control the major aphid species that occur in strawberry culture. 201...|$|R
40|$|Species of Botryosphaeriaceae have a {{cosmopolitan}} distribution and {{are known to}} cause serious diseases with dramatic economic implications in both agricultural and forestry ecosystems. In recent years, epidemic attacks of Diplodia and Neofusicoccum species have gradually increased in Sardinia on different hosts such as holm oak, cork oak and Juniper. Considering the plurivorous nature of many Botryosphaeriaceae species and the little information available on their geographic distribution, host range and genetic variability in Sardinia, it was considered appropriate in this PhD thesis to expand knowledge on five patho-systems by studying taxonomy, morphology, phylogeny and pathogenicity of the <b>main</b> <b>species</b> <b>associated</b> with plant cankers and dieback. Results obtained highlight that more than twenty Botryosphaeriaceae species occur on declining plants in both agricultural and forestry ecosystems. Among these, three species Diplodia subglobosa, Lasiodiplodia exigua and Lasiodiplodia mediterranea, morphologically and phylogenetically (ITS and EF 1 -&# 945; sequences data) distinct from all other known species, are described and illustrated herein. Finally, {{this study showed that}} species belonging to the Botryosphaeriaceae family currently represent a serious threat to the biodiversity of Sardinian natural ecosystems and can strongly affect {{the quality and quantity of}} the produce yielded...|$|R

40|$|Cryptosporidium spp. and Cystoisospora belli are monoxenic {{protozoa}} {{that have}} been recognized as the causative agents of chronic diarrhea in immunocompromised individuals, especially HIV-infected subjects. The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate the frequency of these intestinal protozoa in HIV-positive patients in the Tri&# 226;ngulo Mineiro region of Brazil and to correlate the presence of these infections with clinical, epidemiological and laboratory data of the patients. Oocysts were detected in stool samples of 10 (16. 9 %) of the 59 patients studied, while Cryptosporidium spp. were present in 10. 1 % (6 / 59) and C. belli in 6. 7 % (4 / 59). The frequency of these parasites was higher among patients with diarrheic syndrome and CD 4 + T lymphocyte counts < 200 cells/mm 						 3 					, demonstrating the opportunistic characteristic of these infections. A significant association was observed between the lack of adherence to antiretroviral therapy and the presence of Cryptosporidium spp. and/or C. belli. Parasitism with Cryptosporidium spp. was more frequent in February and April, the months following the period of high rainfall. The same was not observed for C. belli.

40|$|Aim Predictive species {{distribution}} modelling {{is a useful}} tool for extracting the maximum amount of information from biological collections and floristic inventories. However, in many tropical regions records are only available from a small number of sites. This can limit the application of predictive modelling, particularly in the case of rare and endangered species. We aim to address this problem by developing a methodology for defining and mapping <b>species</b> pools <b>associated</b> with climatic variables in order to investigate potential species turnover and regional species loss under climate change scenarios combined with anthropogenic disturbance. Location The study covered an area of 6800 km(2) in the highlands of Chiapas, southern Mexico. Methods We derived climatically <b>associated</b> <b>species</b> pools from floristic inventory data using multivariate analysis combined with spatially explicit discriminant analysis. We then produced predictive maps of the distribution of tree species pools using data derived from 451 inventory plots. After validating the predictive power of potential distributions against an independent historical data set consisting of 3105 botanical collections, we investigated potential changes in the distribution of tree species resulting from forest disturbance and climate change. Results Two <b>species</b> pools, <b>associated</b> with moist and cool climatic conditions, were identified as being particularly threatened by both climate change and ongoing anthropogenic disturbance. A change in climate consistent with low-emission scenarios of general circulation models was shown to be sufficient to cause major changes in equilibrium forest composition within 50 years. The same species pools were also found to be suffering the fastest current rates of deforestation and internal forest disturbance. Disturbance and deforestation, in combination with climate change, threaten the regional distributions of five tree species listed as endangered by the IUCN. These include the endemic species Magnolia sharpii Miranda and Wimmeria montana Lundell. Eleven vulnerable species and 34 species requiring late successional conditions for their regeneration could also be threatened. <b>Main</b> conclusions Climatically <b>associated</b> <b>species</b> pools can be derived from floristic inventory data available for tropical regions using methods based on multivariate analysis even when data limitations prevent effective application of individual species modelling. Potential consequences of climate change and anthropogenic disturbance on the species diversity of montane tropical forests in our study region are clearly demonstrated by the method...|$|R

40|$|SUMMARY Objective: To {{identify}} the <b>main</b> bacterial <b>species</b> <b>associated</b> with community-acquired {{urinary tract infection}} (UTI) and to assess the pattern of ciprofloxacin susceptibility among bacteria isolated from urine cultures. Methods: We conducted a retrospective study in all the patients with community-acquired UTI seen in Santa Helena Laboratory, Camaçari, Bahia, Brazil during five years (2010 - 2014). All individuals who had a positive urine culture result were included in this study. Results: A total of 1, 641 individuals met the inclusion criteria. Despite the fact that participants were female, we observed {{a higher rate of}} resistance to ciprofloxacin in males. The most frequent pathogens identified in urine samples were Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Staphylococcus saprophyticus. Antimicrobial resistance has been observed mainly for ampicillin, sulfamethoxazole + trimethoprim and ciprofloxacin. Moreover, E. coli has shown the highest rate of ciprofloxacin resistance, reaching 36 % of ciprofloxacin resistant strains in 2014. Conclusion: The rate of bacterial resistance to ciprofloxacin observed in the studied population is much higher than expected, prompting the need for rational use of this antibiotic, especially in infections caused by E. coli. Prevention of bacterial resistance can be performed through control measures to limit the spread of resistant microorganisms and a rational use of antimicrobial policy...|$|R

40|$|The {{viscosity}} model {{recently developed}} for fully liquid pure oxides and binary systems is extended {{to describe the}} viscosity of multicomponent systems, based on the thermodynamic modified <b>associate</b> <b>species</b> model. In the model the viscosity {{is linked to the}} distribution of <b>associate</b> <b>species</b> as well as the connectivity of <b>associate</b> <b>species.</b> To describe the viscosity for multicomponent systems, the ternary <b>associate</b> <b>species</b> are introduced. The focus of the present paper is to describe the viscosity of the system SiO 2 –Al 2 O 3 –CaO–MgO–Na 2 O–K 2 O and its ternary or higher order subsystems. The model shows a good performance in describing the viscosity using only one set of model parameters, which all have a clear physico-chemical meaning. The viscosity behavior when substituting one network modifier for another at constant SiO 2 contents is well described. The Al 2 O 3 -induced viscosity maximum is also well described, in which the position and magnitude of the viscosity maximum as a function of composition and temperature (charge compensation effect) are properly predicted. Another viscosity maximum when replacing Al 2 O 3 with SiO 2 for constant contents of the network modifiers is well presented. Moreover, the current model is self-consistent, in which the extension of viscosities from lower order systems to higher order systems works well, and vice versa...|$|R
