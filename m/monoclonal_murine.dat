40|$|Induction of {{an immune}} {{response}} is strongly {{dependent on the}} phylogenetic distance between antigen and recipient. In general, antibodies will not be raised against self-antigens nor against highly conserved domains. In the present study we describe the production and characterization of <b>murine</b> <b>monoclonal</b> "auto-antibodies" against <b>murine</b> tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) raised in "knock-out" mice, homozygously deficient of the functional gene. 203 stable hybridomas were obtained producing <b>murine</b> <b>monoclonal</b> antibodies against <b>murine</b> t-PA. Analysis of the species reactivity revealed that 182 cross-reacted with one or more (t-) PAs originating from other species including rat t-PA, human t-PA, and vampire bat-PA. 121 reacted with epitopes conserved among murine, rat, and human t-PA. In addition, 31 of the monoclonal antibodies were directed against domains present in all four species. Epitope mapping indicated a high frequency of specificity toward diverse epitopes that are highly conserved across species. Comparative analysis of their influence on the enzymatic activity of t-PA and their species cross-reactivity clearly demonstrated that the domains required for the biological activity of plasminogen activators are more conserved (p < 0. 02) than non-functional domains. The availability of such unique antibodies against a wide variety of conserved epitopes may facilitate studies on the structural homologies between (t-) PAs isolated from various species. The present approach should also apply to various other classes of proteins, allowing the generation of monoclonal antibodies, against conserved epitopes, which could not be raised in wild-type animals because of their "self-antigen" nature. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Aim. To perform immune {{mapping of}} the {{peripheral}} part of visual analyzer and optic nerve {{in order to}} identify potential antigenic targets of autoimmune attack. Methods. Eyes enucleated for terminal painful glaucoma (n = 30) were studied. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed on paraffin-embedded sections of isolated retina and optic nerve using a broad panel of antibodies, i. e., <b>monoclonal</b> <b>murine</b> anti-MBP (myelin basic protein) antibodies, polyclonal rabbit anti-alpha fodrin antibodies, <b>monoclonal</b> <b>murine</b> anti-NSE 2 (neuron-specific enolase) antibodies, monoclonal murine anti-GFAP (glial fibrillary acidic protein), and polyclonal rabbit anti-S 100 antibodies. IHC reaction was visualized using Mouse and Rabbit Specific HRP / AEC Detection IHC Kit. IHC reaction without primary antibodies included was a negative control. IHC reaction was considered as follows: negative — no specific cellular staining or less than 10 % of cells are stained; mild — 10 ‑ 30 % of cells are stained (+); moderate — 30 ‑ 75 % of cells are stained (++); marked — more than 75 % of cells are stained (+++); overexpression — 100 % of cells intensively express markers. Additionally, staining intensity was considered as mild (+ 1), moderate (+ 2), strong (+ 3) and intense (+ 4). Results. Immune mapping with a broad panel of monoclonal antibodies identified ocular structures which were stained with IHC markers. Retina was stained with almost all markers of neural differentiation (i. e., antibodies against NSE, GFAP, S 100, and α-fodrin) excepting anti-MBP autoantibodies.  IHC reaction intensity in retinal layers and structures varied and depended on markers. Moderate (2 +) staining with antibodies against MBP, NSE, GFAP, and S 100 and marked (3 +) staining with antibodies against alpha-fodrin was detected in the cytoplasm of optic nerve glia. Conclusion. Complete labelling of retina structures was performed. As a result, IHC profiles of retinal neurons, optic nerve axons, interneurons, and microglial cells were described.

In order to develop a specific treatment for HCC, a <b>murine</b> anti-human HCC <b>monoclonal</b> antibody was raised in 1991. However, <b>murine</b> <b>monoclonal</b> antibodies will cause HAMA (Human Anti-Murine Antibody) reaction when injected into human body, hence they are not ideal for use in human cancer therapy.

40|$|ABSTRACT Desmosomal plaque {{proteins}} {{have been}} identified in immunoblotting and immunolocalization experiments {{on a wide range of}} cell types from several species, using a panel of <b>monoclonal</b> <b>murine</b> antibodies to desmoplakins I and II and a guinea pig antiserum to desmosomal band 5 protein. Specifically, we have taken advantage of the fact that certain antibodies react with both desmoplakins I and II, whereas others react only with desmoplakin I, indicating that desmoplakin I contains unique regions not present on the closely related desmoplakin II. While some of these antibodies recognize epitopes conserved between chick and man, others display a narrow species specificity. The results show that proteins whose size, charge, and biochemical behavior are very similar to those of desmoplakin I and band 5 protein of cow snout epidermis are present in all desmosomes examined. These include examples of simple and pseudostratified epithelia and myocardial tissue, in addition to those of stratified epithelia. In contrast, in immunoblotting experiments, we have detected desmoplakin II only among cells of stratified and pseudostratified epithelial tissues. This suggests that the desmosomal plaque structure varies in its complement of polypeptides in a cell-type specific manner. We conclude that the obligatory desmosomal plaque proteins, desmoplaki...|$|E

BackgroundAntineutrophil cytoplasm antibodies (ANCAs) are implicated in the pathogenesis of systemic vasculitis. We asked whether ANCA could induce nitric oxide (NO) release from human neutrophils and, if so, whether this NO production was dependent on NO synthase (NOS) activity. MethodsNeutrophil NO production was measured using a chemiluminescence assay, and NOS activity {{was determined by the}} conversion of [14 C] L-arginine to [14 C] L-citrulline and NOS mRNA expression by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). ResultsHuman neutrophils isolated from healthy donors were incubated at 37 °C with human ANCA, normal human IgG, <b>murine</b> <b>monoclonal</b> myeloperoxidase ANCA, <b>murine</b> proteinase- 3 ANCA, or their respective isotypic controls for 6 to 12 hours in RPMI. Both human and monoclonal ANCA led to a dose-dependent increase of NO compared with control IgG. Neutrophils, either freshly isolated or incubated for seven hours with <b>murine</b> <b>monoclonal</b> myeloperoxidase ANCA, proteinase- 3 ANCA, or a mixture of interleukin- 1 ßbgr;, tumor necrosis factor-α, interferon-γ plus lipopolysaccharide showed no NOS activity with low conversion rates of [14 C] L-arginine to [14 C] L-citrulline, which could not be inhibited by NG-monomethyl-L-arginine (NOS inhibitor). To detect NOS mRNA expression, RT-PCR was performed using oligonucleotide primers derived from mRNA sequences of either human constitutive endothelial NOS (eNOS), constitutive neuroneal NOS (nNOS), or human hepatocyte inducible NOS (iNOS). There was no expression of either eNOS, nNOS, or iNOS in untreated, human and <b>murine</b> <b>monoclonal</b> ANCA-treated, or cytokine-treated neutrophils. ConclusionThese data suggest that human neutrophils produce NO in response to ANCA but in a NOS-independent way. NO can be generated from a nonenzymatic interaction between hydrogen peroxide and arginine. We postulate that this is the predominant pathway of NO synthesis in neutrophils, since ANCAs are capable of inducing reactive oxygen species production from neutrophils...|$|R
