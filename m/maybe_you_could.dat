It's lovely to live on a raft. We had the sky up there, all speckled with stars, and we used to lay on our backs and look up at them, and discuss about whether they was made or only just happened. Jim he allowed they was made, but I allowed they happened; I judged it would have took too long to MAKE so many. Jim said the moon could a LAID them; well, that looked kind of reasonable, so I didn't say nothing against it, because I've seen a frog lay most as many, so of course it could be done. We used to watch the stars that fell, too, and see them streak down. Jim allowed they'd got spoiled and was hove out of the nest.|$|E

"If {{the time}} should come, Harry, when the fortune of war may compel the king {{to retire from}} Oxford--which I trust may never be--I would then grant your request, for after your {{encounter}} with the officer who commanded the Roundheads here, {{it would not be}} safe for you to remain behind. But although you are too young {{to take part in the}} war, I may find you employment. After a council that was held yesterday at Oxford, I learned, from one in the king's secrets, that it was designed to send a messenger to London with papers of importance, and to keep up the communication with the king's friends in that city. There was some debate as to who should be chosen. In London, at the present time, all strangers are closely scrutinized. Every man is suspicious of his neighbor, and it is difficult to find one of sufficient trust whose person is unknown. Then I have thought that <b>maybe</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> well fulfill this important mission. A boy would be unsuspected, where a man's every movement would be watched. There is, of course, some danger attending the mission, and sharpness and readiness will be needed. You have shown that you possess these, by the manner in which you made your escape from London, and methinks that, did you offer, your services would be accepted. You would have, of course, to go in disguise, and to accept any situation which might appear conformable to your character and add to your safety." ...|$|E

5000|$|After {{the initial}} NSA ANT catalog leak, which was {{published}} by Der Spiegel in 2013, Michael Ossman, the founder of Great Scott Gadgets, gave a shout out to other security researchers to start working on the tools mentioned in the catalog and to recreate them.

Not Jeffrie and Tyler-Moore as they do the obvious {{and a whole lot}} less, such as making Edward out to be a lost soul with an empty diary, having William as a square-jawed {{helicopter}} hero and Pippa enjoying people constantly gazing at her 'fantastic arse'. And most incredibly of all, the Duke of Edinburgh is, wait for it, a little bit racist. It's certainly gratifying to see some upcoming Fringe comedy acts landing parts, such as Ellie White and Celeste Dring as the all-too predictably shallow Beatrice and Eugenie while Katy Wix has a blast as their tragically pitiable mum.

5000|$|The Nemuri Kyoshirō {{series of}} films, {{which began in}} 1963 and are known as Sleepy Eyes of Death in the west, are {{considered}} to be the representative work of Raizō's later years. According to Tokuzō Tanaka, playing the part of the protagonist, Kyoshirō, was an extreme challenge for Raizō. Speaking of the first film in the series, Sappōchō, even Raizō himself said that [...] "the characteristic 'hollowness' of Kyoshirō simply didn't come out at all" [...] and deemed the film a failure. It wasn't until the fourth film, Joyōken, that Raizō succeeded in bringing the hollowness, dandyism and nihilism of the character to life. The actor Shintarō Katsu described Raizō's performance in the Nemuri Kyoshirō films, saying [...] "When he was playing Kyoshirō he had a real animal magnetism about him, didn't he. <b>Maybe</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> say it came from this sense of the shadow of death hanging over him. It really is the face people make when they die, that expression." [...] “When he’d walk by, Rai-chan would cut you with his face. Not with a sword, with his face,” he reminisced, “Rai-chan didn’t become Kyoshirō through his fight scenes or the delivery of his lines, he did it through his face; that’s my opinion, anyway.” Kazuo Ikehiro said, “without speaking, without any kind of facial expression, simply by the way he walked around as though he were carrying his past on his back” Akira Inoue, director of the seventh film in the series, Tajōken, said that there were other actors who played Kyoshirō, but none of them could compare to Raizō when it came to portraying Kyoshirō’s soul. Raizō went on to hold the starring role in 12 films in the series, which represents a majority of the starring roles for which Raizō was cast.|$|E
