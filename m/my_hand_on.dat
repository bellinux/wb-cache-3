500|$|The {{win in the}} Kentucky Derby marked Secretariat's third win in {{the four}} races he had run as a three-year old. After the race, jockey Ron Turcotte stated, in {{response}} to Secretariat's last place start, he [...] "just dropped <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> him and let him run his own race." [...] With Secretariat's victory, trainer Lucien Laurin had his second consecutive win in the Derby, as Riva Ridge won in 1972. Turcotte accomplished a similar feat as he had ridden Riva Ridge, marking the third time a jockey had won in the Derby in consecutive years.|$|E
500|$|Peter Doyle may be {{the most}} likely {{candidate}} for the love of Whitman's life. Doyle was a bus conductor whom Whitman met around 1866, and the two were inseparable for several years. Interviewed in 1895, Doyle said: [...] "We were familiar at once—I put <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> his knee—we understood. He did not get {{out at the end of}} the trip—in fact went all the way back with me." [...] In his notebooks, Whitman disguised Doyle's initials using the code [...] "16.4" [...] (P.D. being the 16th and 4th letters of the alphabet). Oscar Wilde met Whitman in America in 1882 and told the homosexual-rights activist George Cecil Ives that Whitman's sexual orientation was beyond question —"I have the kiss of Walt Whitman still on my lips." [...] The only explicit description of Whitman's sexual activities is secondhand. In 1924, Edward Carpenter told Gavin Arthur of a sexual encounter in his youth with Whitman, the details of which Arthur recorded in his journal. Late in his life, when Whitman was asked outright whether his [...] "Calamus" [...] poems were homosexual, he chose not to respond. The manuscript of his love poem [...] "Once I Pass'd Through A Populous City", written when Whitman was 29, indicates it was originally about a man.|$|E
2500|$|Hellman shot {{almost the}} entire script as written. The first cut of the film was three-and-a-half hours long. He was his own editor: [...] "I can't look over someone's shoulder. I need <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> the brake". He had control of the final cut, but was contractually obliged to deliver a film no longer than two hours. The final version ran 105 minutes. In their April 1971 cover story, Esquire {{magazine}} proclaimed Two-Lane Blacktop, [...] "film of the year". Hellman initially thought that the Esquire article would be good publicity for the film, but in hindsight was not, because [...] "I think it raised people's expectations. They couldn't accept the movie for what it was". There {{was a lot of}} advance buzz about the film, but Lew Wasserman, head of the studio saw the film and hated it. He refused to promote it and when it opened in New York City on the Fourth of July weekend, there were no newspaper ads promoting it.|$|E

2500|$|On 23 February 2010, Tebbit was {{alleged to}} have {{attacked}} a ceremonial Chinese dragon during a Chinese New Year parade. He {{is said to have}} been unaware it was Chinese New Year and to have [...] "kicked the rear of a child who was dressed in the traditional costume of a dragon". Tebbit later said: [...] "I don't think my reaction was extreme at all. I placed <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> the drum so I could diminish the noise and asked the drummer what was going on and got a rap on the knuckles for my pain. I was then barged by the dragon. I barged it back and might have done something like kick it. I wasn't sure how to deal with it. I've never been barged by a dragon before". A local Conservative town councillor, Mr Chung, visited Tebbit the day after the incident and received an apology. Chung said: [...] "I said his actions were upsetting. He apologised. He only then understood what he had done".|$|E
2500|$|The Better Boston Group is a {{political}} group that split from the Boston Bypass Independents in October 2007 under the leadership Cllr Anne Dorrian. She had unsuccessfully stood for leadership of the BBI group after their landslide victory in April 2007. It has four councillors on Boston Borough Council. Cllr Brian Rush, the other unsuccessful candidate for Party leadership in April 2007, of the group said of the Boston Bypass Independents that [...] "We came in on a typhoon and we {{are nothing more than}} a gentle breeze now. It appears to me that we haven't done anything yet. There is nothing that I can put <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> and say the BBI have thought of that, the inspiration was there and they have carried it through." [...] The group criticised the record of the BBI, including their approval of the Lincolnshire County Council Transport Strategy for Boston. A deal with the county council was struck to aid the BBI with the bypass proposal if they agreed not to stand in the next county council elections, prompting two councillors to resign. The chairman of the Boston Bypass Pressure Group also called on Cllr Austin and his deputy, Cllr Peter Jordan to resign over the deal with Lincolnshire Council. Both Cllrs Austin and Jordan vigorously denied any such deal and there were four BBI candidates in the subsequent County Council elections in 2009.|$|E
2500|$|In October 1934 Abe {{was arrested}} in a police raid on the {{unlicensed}} brothel at which she {{was working at the}} time. Kinnosuke Kasahara, a well-connected friend of the brothel owner, arranged for her release. He was attracted to Abe, finding that she had no debts, and with Abe's agreement, made her his mistress. Kasahara set up a house for Abe on December 20, 1934, and also provided her with an income. In his deposition to the police, he remembered, [...] "She was really strong, a real powerful one. Even though I am pretty jaded, she was enough to astound me. She wasn't satisfied unless we did it two, three, or four times a night. To her, it was unacceptable unless I had <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> her private parts all night long... At first it was great, but after a couple of weeks I got a little exhausted." [...] When Abe suggested that Kasahara leave his wife to marry her, he refused. She then asked Kasahara to allow her to take another lover, which he also refused to do. Afterwards, their relationship ended, and to escape him Abe left for Nagoya. Kasahara ended his testimony with an angry remark about Abe, [...] "She is a slut and a whore. And as what she has done makes clear, she is a woman whom men should fear." [...] Likewise, Abe remembered Kasahara in less than flattering terms, saying, [...] "He didn't love me and treated me like an animal. He was the kind of scum who would then plead with me when I said that we should break up." ...|$|E

He used these words to {{describe}} his years of instruction: [...] " [...] The maister of the scholl, was a lerned, honest, kynd man, whom also for thankfulness I name, Mr. Andro Miln. I never got a stroke of his hand; howbeit, I committed twa stupid faults, as it were with fire and sword :—Having the candle in <b>my</b> <b>hand,</b> <b>on</b> a winter night, before six o'clock, in the school, sitting in the class, bairnly and negligently playing with the bent, with which the floor was strewed, it kindled, so that we had much ado to put it out with our feet. The other was being molested by a condisciple, who cut the strings of my pen and ink-horn with his pen-knife I aiming with my pen-knife to his legs to fley him he feared, and lifting now a leg and now the other, rushed on his leg upon my knife, and struck himself a deep wound in the shin of the leg, which waa a quarter of a year in curing. In the time of the trying of the matter, he saw me so humble, so feared, so grieved, yield so many tears, and by fasting and mourning at the school all day, that he said he could not find in his heart to punish me farther. But my righteous God let me not slip that fault, but gave me a warning, and remembrance what it was to be denied with blood, although negligently; for within a short space, after I had caused a cutler, newly come to the town, to polish and sharp the same pen-knife, and had bought a pennyworth of apples, and cutting and eating the same in the links, as I put the slice in my mouth, I began to lope up upon a little sand brae, having the pen.knife in my right hand, I fell, and struck myself, missing my belly, an inch deep in the inward side of the left knee, even to the bean, whereby the equity of God's judgment, and my conscience struck me so, that I was the more wary of knives all my days." ...|$|E
