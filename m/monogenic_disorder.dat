40|$|International audienceThe {{molecular}} genetic {{cause of}} over 3000 <b>monogenic</b> <b>disorders</b> is currently unknown. This review discusses how novel genomic techniques like Next-Generation-DNA-Sequencing (NGS) and genotyping arrays open new avenues in the elucidation of genetic defects causing <b>monogenic</b> <b>disorders.</b> They {{will not only}} speed up disease gene identification but {{will enable us to}} systematically tackle previously intractable <b>monogenic</b> <b>disorders.</b> These are mainly disorders not amenable to classic linkage analysis e. g. due to insufficient family size. Most monogenic diseases are caused by exonic mutations or splice-site-mutations changing the amino acid sequence of the affected gene. These mutations can be identified by sequencing of all exons in the human genome (exome sequencing) rendering whole genome sequencing unnecessary in most cases. Genotyping-arrays containing 105 - 2 x 106 single-nucleotide-polymorphisms (SNP) and non-polymorphic markers allow highly accurate mapping of genomic deletions and duplications not detectable by exome sequencing which are the second most common cause of <b>monogenic</b> <b>disorders.</b> However, several hundred rare, previously unknown sequence variants affecting the amino acid sequence of the encoded protein are found in the exome of every human individual.

50|$|The {{symptoms}} of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis {{are caused by}} degeneration of motor nerve cells (motor neurons) in the spinal cord, brainstem, and motor cortex. The exact cause of this degeneration is unknown but {{it is thought that}} environmental exposures and genetic factors play a role in susceptibility to the disease. In 5-10% of patients the family history is positive for ALS. However, it is not always possible to establish the mode of inheritance in each pedigree and not all familial cases may suffer from a genuine Mendelian or <b>monogenic</b> <b>disorder.</b> Autosomal-dominant mutations in the C9orf72 and the SOD1 gene are found in a substantial number of familial ALS cases. Mutations in other genes (such as VAPB 2, ANG, TARDBP and FUS) have been reported, but are found at a much lower frequency and with variable penetrance, suggesting the involvement of other genes.|$|E
50|$|A {{team from}} the National Institute of Nutrition, Hyderabad {{conducted}} research in the affected regions {{and found out that}} the disease was confined to a dalit colony. They also found out that the disease was affecting people of all age groups and it was non-contagious and non-infectious. This research was further followed by research conducted over four years (1984-88) by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). Study groups involving experts from different medical fields were formed and these groups visited the affected places to conduct experiments. They were also helped by the Health Department of Karnataka who also provided a team to assist them. Despite undertaking extensive research, the team could not come into any conclusion on the cause of the disease. The team wound up in 1988 and this was the first phase of their research. The second phase of the research by ICMR was started in the year 2001 under the leadership of S. S. Agarwal of the Sanjay Gandhi Post-graduate centre in Lucknow. Some of the activities in the second phase were to x-ray the patients and also study their family history to see if the disease was related to genetics. The study reported that Handigodu syndrome is a syndrome of familial spondyloepi(meta)physeal dysplasia. It is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait. All the presentations of the varied manifestation of the disease could be explained as being caused by defective development of bones as a result of <b>monogenic</b> <b>disorder.</b>|$|E
50|$|Hajdu-Cheney {{syndrome}} is a <b>monogenic</b> <b>disorder.</b> The disorder is inherited {{and controlled by}} {{a single pair of}} genes. A single copy of the mutant gene on an autosome causes HCS. HCS is an autosomal dominant disorder, only one parent with the defective gene is needed to pass the disorder to the offspring.Mutations within the last coding exon of NOTCH2 that remove the PEST domain and escape the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay {{have been shown to be}} the main cause of Hajdu-Cheney syndrome. The NOTCH2 gene plays a very important role in skeletogenesis. Mutations of NOTCH2 that seem to cause HCS occur in the last coding exon of the gene (exon 34). These mutations remove PEST domains, which mediate proteosomal destruction of the protein. These PEST domains are removed due to the premature stop codon in the amino acid sequence. All HCS alleles are observed to have premature protein destruction before the PEST sequence is fully translated. The result is a mature NOTCH2 gene with a partially completed PEST sequence. In some cases, no PEST sequence at all is seen. This leads to the no proteosomal destruction of the protein.The NOTCH2 gene is ubiquitously expressed in all embryonic tissue. When researching HCS in mice, the homozygous deletion of NOTCH2 leads to death. This observation is important because it explains how the HCS phenotype is not isolated to only one system of the body. NOTCH2 is also shown to regulate RANK-L osteoclastogenesis, which is the production of functional osteoclasts. Osteoclasts are the component that breaks bone down. This is why bone loss is observed in HCS patients, due to the overactivation of RANK-L.|$|E
40|$|Multiple {{inquiries}} {{into the}} genetic etiology of human traits indicated an overlap between genes underlying <b>monogenic</b> <b>disorders</b> (eg, skeletal growth defects) and those affecting continuous variability of related quantitative traits (eg, height). Extending {{the idea of}} a shared genetic basis between a Mendelian disorder and a classic polygenic trait, we performed an association study to examine the effect of 43 genes implicated in autosomal recessive cognitive disorders on intelligence in an unselected Dutch population (N= 1316). Using both single- nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) - and gene-based association testing, we detected an association between intelligence and the genes of interest, with genes ELP 2, TMEM 135, PRMT 10, and RGS 7 showing the strongest associations. This is a demonstration of the relevance of genes implicated in <b>monogenic</b> <b>disorders</b> of intelligence to normal-range intelligence, and a corroboration of the utility of employing knowledge on <b>monogenic</b> <b>disorders</b> in identifying the genetic variability underlying complex traits...|$|R

[...] X-linked SCID is a <b>monogenic</b> <b>disorder,</b> the IL2RG gene is mutated, so gene therapy will replace this mutated gene with a normal one. [...] This {{will result in a}} normal functioning gamma chain protein of the interleukin receptor. [...] In order to transfer a functional gene into the target cell, viral or non-viral vectors can be employed. [...] Viral vectors, such as the retrovirus, that incorporate the gene into the genome result in long-term effects. [...] This, coupled with the bone marrow stem cells, has been successful in treating individuals with X-SCID. In one particular trial by Cavazzana-Calvo et al., ten children were treated with gene therapy at infancy for X-SCID. [...] Nine of the ten were cured of X-SCID. [...] However, about three years after treatment, two of the children developed T-cell leukemia due to insertion of the IL2RG gene near the LMO2 gene and thereby activating the LMO2 gene (a known oncogene). A third child developed leukemia within two years of that study being published, likely {{as a direct result of}} the therapy. This condition is known as insertional mutagenesis, where the random insertion of a gene interferes with the tumor suppressor gene or stimulates an oncogene. [...] There is currently no approved gene therapy on the market, but there are many clinical trials into which X-SCID patients may enroll. Therefore, research in the field of gene therapy today and in the future is needed to avoid the occurrence of leukemia. [...] In particular, research into the use of insulator and suicide genes is warranted as this may prevent cancer from developing. [...] The insulator gene inhibits the activation of adjacent genes. On the other hand, the suicide gene is stimulated when a tumour begins to form, and this will result in the deactivation of the therapeutic gene. [...] Moreover, the use of restriction enzymes such as the zinc-finger nuclease (ZFN) is being studied. [...] The ZFN allows the researcher to choose the site of gene integration. [...] Vector safety is important in the field of gene therapy, hence vectors that self-inactivate the promoter and enhancer (SIN) and adenoviruses that creates no immune response are prominent areas of research for vector biologists.|$|E

40|$|Polar body {{diagnosis}} (PBD) {{is currently}} the only legal option to perform a preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) in Germany. The results of PBD for monogenic disorders performed at our center in Regensburg since 2001 are reported. Our data show that PBD can be safely performed on first and second polar bodies within the tight timeframe provided by the German Embryo Protection Act. It requires extensive interdisciplinary counseling of the couple, good and close cooperation between the IVF center and the genetics laboratory as well as meticulous development, validation, and performance of the individual genetic assay. Provided that these prerequisites are met, PBD can today be an acceptable option for German couples {{at high risk for}} a particular <b>monogenic</b> <b>disorder</b> in their offspring. Main arguments pro PBD usually include a decline of both conventional prenatal diagnosis and subsequently induced abortion of an affected offspring as well as the birth of an affected child. Major disadvantages of PBD in this situation include the requirement of assisted reproduction for couples {{in the absence of any}} obvious fertility problems with their immanent obstacles like pregnancy rate, remaining recurrence risk for the particular <b>monogenic</b> <b>disorder,</b> costs etc. Furthermore, PBD can only be offered for mutations, which are passed on by the female partner with her nuclear DNA (autosomal dominant, X-chromosomal as well as autosomal recessive traits). For heterozygous female mutation carriers of autosomal recessive or X-chromosomal inherited disorders PBD requires discarding all oocytes carrying the mutation, although they may result in healthy offspring if the sperm does not carry the mutation or the Y chromosome, respectively. Finally, both PBD as well as PGD can substantially reduce the recurrence risk for a particular <b>monogenic</b> <b>disorder</b> but not diminish it entirely.

40|$|Preimplantation genetic {{diagnosis}} (PGD) for monogenic disorders has the drawback {{of time and}} cost associated with tailoring a specific test for each couple, disorder, or both.

The first clinical use of a novel approach ('karyomapping') was designed to circumvent this problem. In this example, karyomapping was used to confirm the results of an existing PGD case detecting both chromosomal abnormalities and a <b>monogenic</b> <b>disorder</b> (Smith-Lemli-Opitz [SLO] syndrome) simultaneously. The family underwent IVF, ICSI and PGD, and both polar body and cleavage stage biopsy were carried out. Following whole genome amplification, array comparative genomic hybridisation of the polar bodies and minisequencing and STR analysis of single blastomeres were used to diagnose maternal aneuploidies and SLO status, respectively. This was confirmed, by karyomapping. Unlike standard PGD, karyomapping required no a-priori test development. A singleton pregnancy and live birth, unaffected with SLO syndrome and with no chromosome abnormality, ensued. Karyomapping is potentially capable of detecting a wide spectrum of monogenic and chromosome disorders and, in this context, can be considered a comprehensive approach to PGD...|$|E
