The more conservative process industries with their longer plant life cycles have been slower to adopt and analogue-based <b>measurement</b> <b>and</b> <b>control</b> still dominates. The growing use of Industrial Ethernet {{on the factory}} floor is pushing these trends still further, enabling {{manufacturing plants}} to be integrated more tightly within the enterprise, via the internet if necessary. Global competition has also increased demand for Reconfigurable Manufacturing Systems.|$|E
25|$|The {{scope of}} {{application}} for DC capacitors is similarly diverse. Smoothing capacitors are used to reduce the AC component of fluctuating DC voltage (such as in power supplies for radio and television transmitters), and for high voltage testing equipment, DC controllers, <b>measurement</b> <b>and</b> <b>control</b> technology and cascaded circuits for generation of high DC voltage. Supporting capacitors, DC-filter or buffer circuit capacitors are used for energy storage in intermediate DC circuits, such as in frequency converters for poly-phase drives, and transistor and thyristor power converters. They {{must be able to}} absorb and release very high currents within short periods, the peak values of currents being substantially greater than the RMS values.|$|E
