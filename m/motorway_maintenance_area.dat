25|$|Twelve school {{children}} and a teacher died when their minibus crashed into a parked <b>motorway</b> <b>maintenance</b> vehicle just after midnight on 18 November 1993. The inquest recorded a verdict of accidental death {{for all of the}} victims but noted that none of the children were wearing seatbelts and that the side-facing bench seating was dangerous. Seatbelts were subsequently made compulsory equipment on all coaches and minibuses, more than 20 years after they had been compulsory on cars. It has been compulsory for passengers to wear seatbelts on coaches and minibuses since 2006.|$|R
