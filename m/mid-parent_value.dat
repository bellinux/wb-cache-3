40|$|Inheritance {{of grain}} protein content, grain yield and {{components}} of grain yield {{was investigated in}} crosses of four wheat cultivars or lines. Three high-protein wheat cultivars, Lancota Sel., 77 Y 10442 and 77 Y 10456, and one low protein cultivar, Bennett, were selected for this study. Two sets of crosses were made between 77 Y 10442 /Bennett (Experiment I) and Lancota Sel. / 77 Y 10456 (Experiment II). Parents, F(, 1), F(, 2) and backcrosses of each cross were planted as separate experiments in the greenhouse {{as well as in}} the field, Lincoln, NE, 1981. ^ Grain protein % of 77 Y 10442 was significantly higher than that of Bennett at both locations. In Experiment II (high by high) 77 Y 10456 was significantly different from Lancota Sel. for grain protein content only in the field results. In Experiment I (high by low) the F(, 2) mean for grain protein content was near the mid-parent in the greenhouse, but in the field the F(, 2) mean was above the <b>mid-parent</b> <b>value.</b> In Experiment II (high by high) the F(, 2) mean for grain protein content was near the <b>mid-parent</b> <b>value</b> under field conditions. ^ The means, variances and frequency distributions of the F(, 2) generations for grain protein content, yield, 100 -kernel weight, grains per spike, grains per plant and spikes per plant indicated that the traits mentioned above were inherited in a quantitative manner in these experiments. ^ Grain protein content was negatively correlated with yield and components of yield in both experiments. The negative associations between protein and grain yield in the F(, 2) generation did not exceed -. 51. ^ Grain yield and components of yield were positively correlated. Spikes per plant and grains per plant were found to be the most important components of yield in this material. ^ Heritability estimates were inconsistent between locations for both experiments. The contribution of additive gene effects was most prominent in the inheritance of grain protein content and 100 -kernel weight. Dominant gene effects were found for grains per spike under greenhouse conditions for Experiments I and II. Epistatic effects were found for grains per spike in Experiment I in the greenhouse and for grains per plant in Experiment II in the field. ...|$|E
40|$|The present paper {{summarizes}} {{the data of}} field and laboratory trials conducted at the Plant Research International in Wageningen, the Netherlands during the period 1999 - 2000. In this study, differences in nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) between populations of perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) are determined under limited level of nitrogen (N) availability. Each of 93 segregating entries was individually evaluated in a greenhouse in a hydroponics system aiming at 2. 7 - 3. 5 % N in herbage dry matter (DM). The population was examined for root and shoot regrowth, tillering, leaf extension and width in order to screen the genotypes with the most vigorous leaf area regrowth after defoliation. All the entries were also subject to a field study to assess their total N content. Five selections outperformed the corresponding mid-parent values of their source materials by 63 - 124 % in leaf area increase (LAI) and its components: leaf length (8 - 28 %), leaf width (8 - 16 %) and tiller number (16 - 72 %). Tiller number per plant was the most variable (cv = 29. 8 %) component of the LAI index and had a stronger impact (r = 0. 88) upon the DM productivity than did leaf length and width (r = 0. 50 and 0. 48, respectively). Leaf weight ratio of the selections was 3 % lower to 13 % higher than that as a mean of two parents. Harvestable DM yield of the selections was by 70 - 122 % higher relative to the <b>mid-parent</b> <b>value,</b> indicating a selection potential within the heterozygous original material. The selections revealed their superiority in reduced N contents (2. 19 - 2. 27 % in DM) that was reduced by 13 % {{in terms of the}} <b>mid-parent</b> <b>value.</b> Inverse relation (r = - 0. 26) established between the plant N concentration and harvestable DM yield suggests that improvement in nitrogen use efficiency under simulated grazing is mainly the result of better metabolic efficiency arising from more efficient use of proteins for leaf growth. Through plant breeding, perennial ryegrass cultivars can be created capable of higher growth rates at sub-optimum levels of available N...|$|E
40|$|Heterosis {{is defined}} as the {{increased}} vigour of hybrids in comparison to their parents. We investigated 24 F 1 hybrid lines of Arabidopsis thaliana generated by reciprocally crossing either C 24 or Col with six other parental accessions (Can, Co, Cvi, Ler, Rsch, Te) that differ widely in their freezing tolerance. The crosses differed in the degree of heterosis for freezing tolerance, both in the non-acclimated state and after a 14 d cold acclimation period. Crosses with C 24 showed more heterosis than crosses with Col, and heterosis was stronger in acclimated than in non-acclimated plants. Leaf content of soluble sugars and proline showed more deviation from <b>mid-parent</b> <b>values</b> in crosses involving C 24 than in those involving Col, and deviations were larger in acclimated than in non-acclimated plants. There were significant correlations between the content of different sugars and leaf freezing tolerance, as well as between heterosis effects in freezing tolerance and sugar content. Flavonoid content and composition varied between accessions, and between non-acclimated and acclimated plants. In the crosses, large deviations from the <b>mid-parent</b> <b>values</b> in the contents of different flavonols occurred, and there were strikingly strong correlations between both flavonol content and freezing tolerance, and between heterosis effects in freezing tolerance and flavonol content...|$|R

We {{determined}} the relative contributions of genetic {{and environmental factors}} to variation in plasma PAF-AH activity in 240 individuals from 60 nuclear families. Regression of mean-offspring PAF-AH activity on the <b>mid-parent</b> <b>value</b> indicated that 62 % {{of the variation in}} plasma PAF-AH activity was heritable. Spousal values were weakly negatively correlated, indicating that familial aggregation of PAF-AH activity is due to genetic rather than to environmental factors. Among normolipidemic individuals, plasma PAF-AH activity was strongly correlated with the plasma concentration of low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and treatment with lovastatin resulted in proportional decreases in plasma PAF-AH activity and LDL-C concentrations. To further elucidate the relationship between PAF-AH and plasma concentrations of LDL, plasma PAF-AH activity was measured in families with well-defined, monogenic disorders of LDL metabolism. Plasma PAF-AH activity cosegregated with plasma LDL-C concentrations in familial hypercholesterolemia, but not in familial hypobetalipoproteinemia. We speculate that the rate of removal of LDL from the circulation may determine the clearance rate of PAF-AH, thereby modulating the activity of PAF-AH in blood...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigated}} body-size inheritance in interspecific sterile hybrids by {{crossing a}} Drosophila simulans strain with 13 strains of Drosophila melanogaster, which were of various origins and chosen for their {{broad range of}} genetic variation. A highly significant parent-offspring correlation was observed, showing that the D. melanogaster genes for size are still expressed in a hybrid background. Superimposed on to this additive inheritance, the size of hybrids was always less than the <b>mid-parent</b> <b>value.</b> This phenomenon, which at first sight {{might be described as}} dominance or overdominance, is more precisely interpreted as a consequence of a hybrid breakdown, that is, a dysfunction of the parental genes for size when put to work together. This interpretation is enforced by the fact that phenotypic variability was much more prevalent in hybrids than in parents. We also analysed body pigmentation inheritance in the same crosses and got a very different picture. There was no increase in the phenotypic variance of F(1) hybrids and only a low parent-offspring correlation. Apparent overdominance could be observed but in opposite directions, with no evidence of hybrid breakdown. Our data point to the possibility of analysing a diversity of quantitative traits in interspecific hybrids, and indicate that breakdown might be restricted to some traits only...|$|E

(anamorph: Zymoseptoria tritici Desm.), {{is the major}} foliar disease of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) in Tunisia causing {{frequent}} epidemics on T. turgidum L. var. durum (Desf.) Bowden, and important yield and grain quality losses. To determine the inheritance of resistance to septoria, a cross was made using resistant ('Salim') and susceptible ('Karim') cultivars. Parents, and the 149 derived recombinant lines, were tested for resistance to septoria under field conditions during the 2009 and 2010 crop seasons. The inheritance of resistance to septoria was quantitative where a continuous and normal distribution (W = 0. 93) was shown among segregate progenies. During 2009 and 2010 crop seasons, the mean disease severities of recombinant inbred lines (RILs) ranged from 29. 1 % to 41. 8 %, respectively, and 53 % of RILs were associated with lower disease severity than the <b>mid-parent</b> <b>value.</b> The severity was significantly affected by Genotype x Year interaction (p < 0. 01). Broad sense heritability was 0. 55 suggesting a quantitative inheritance of resistance to M. graminicola.

Iron (Fe) and zinc (Zn) deficiencies {{have been reported to}} be a food-related primary health problem affecting nearly two billion people worldwide. Improving Fe and Zn densities of staple crops by breeding offers a cost-effective and sustainable solution to reducing micronutrient malnutrition in resource poor communities. An understanding of the genetics of these micronutrients can help to accelerate the breeding process, but {{little is known about the}} genetics and heterosis pattern of Fe and Zn densities in pearl millet. In the present study, ten inbred lines and their full diallel crosses were used to study the nature of gene action and heterosis for these micronutrients. The general combining ability (GCA) effects of parents and specific combining ability (SCA) effects of hybrids showed significant differences for both of the micronutrients. However, the predictability ratio (2 σ 2 gca/(2 σ 2 gca + σ 2 sca)) was around unity both for Fe and Zn densities, implying preponderance of additive gene action. Further, highly significant positive correlation between <b>mid-parent</b> <b>values</b> and hybrid performance, and no correlation between <b>mid-parent</b> <b>values</b> and <b>mid-parent</b> heterosis confirmed again the predominant role of additive gene action for these micronutrients. Barring a few exceptions with one parent, hybrids did not outperform the parents having high Fe and Zn levels. This showed that there would be little opportunity, if any, to exploit heterosis for these mineral micronutrients in pearl millet.

40|$|With 6 tables Abstract The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to evaluate the importance of heterosis for agronomic and quality traits in shrunken (sh 2) sweet corn, assess the usefulness of combining ability to predict the value of parents and their crosses for further genetic improvement and examine whether genetic divergence can predict heterosis or F 1 performance. Ten genetically diverse shrunken (sh 2) sweet corn inbred lines were used to generate 45 F 1 s. F 1 s and parents were evaluated for agronomic and quality traits across environments. Heterosis was more important for yield-related traits than it was for ear aspects and eating quality. Heterosis for most traits was mostly dependent on dominance genetic effects of parental lines. Parents and F 1 per se performance were highly correlated with general combining ability effects and <b>mid-parent</b> <b>values,</b> respectively, for most traits.

To investigate hybrid performance {{at different levels}} of drought stress, 12 single-cross hybrids of grain sorghum and their 24 parent lines were grown in eight site-season combinations in a semi-arid area of Kenya. In addition, a subset of 20 genotypes was evaluated at the seedling stage under polyethylene glycol (PEG) -induced drought stress. Environmental means for grain yield ranged from 47 to 584 g/m 2 reflecting the following situations: two non-stress, one moderate pre-flowering, four moderate terminal and one extreme drought stress. Mean hybrid superiority over <b>mid-parent</b> <b>values</b> was 54 % for grain yield and 35 % for above-ground biomass. Across environments, hybrids out-yielded two local varieties by 12 %. Differences in yield potential contributed to grain yield differences in all stress environments. Early anthesis was most important for specific adaptation to extreme drought. Field performance was not related to growth reduction and osmotic adjustment under PEG-induced drought stress.

Although {{the roles of}} miRNAs and siRNAs have been extensively studied, their expression diversity and evolution in closely related species and interspecific hybrids are poorly understood. Here, we show comprehensive analyses of miRNA expression and siRNA distributions in two closely related species Arabidopsis thaliana and Arabidopsis arenosa, a natural allotetraploid Arabidopsis suecica, and two resynthesized allotetraploid lines (F 1 and F 7) derived from A. thaliana and A. arenosa. We found that repeat- and transposon-associated siRNAs were highly divergent between A. thaliana and A. arenosa. A. thaliana siRNA populations underwent rapid changes in F 1 but were stably maintained in F 7 and A. suecica. The correlation between siRNAs and nonadditive gene expression in allopolyploids is insignificant. In contrast, miRNA and tasiRNA sequences were conserved between species, but their expression patterns were highly variable between the allotetraploids and their progenitors. Many miRNAs tested were nonadditively expressed (deviating from the <b>mid-parent</b> <b>value,</b> MPV) in the allotetraploids and triggered unequal degradation of A. thaliana or A. arenosa targets. The data suggest that small RNAs produced during interspecific hybridization or polyploidization serve as a buffer against the genomic shock in interspecific hybrids and allopolyploids: Stable inheritance of repeat-associated siRNAs maintains chromatin and genome stability, whereas expression variation of miRNAs leads to changes in gene expression, growth vigor, and adaptation...|$|E
40|$|Genome-wide {{analysis}} has documented differential gene expression between {{closely related species}} in plants and animals and nonadditive gene expression in hybrids and allopolyploids compared to the parents. In Arabidopsis, 15 - 43 % of genes are expressed differently between the related species, Arabidopsis thaliana and Arabidopsis arenosa, the majority of which are nonadditively expressed (differently from <b>mid-parent</b> <b>value)</b> in allotetraploids. Nonadditive gene expression {{can be caused by}} transcriptional regulation through chromatin modifications, but the role of posttranscriptional regulation in nonadditive gene expression is largely unknown. Here we reported genome-wide analysis of mRNA decay in resynthesized Arabidopsis allotetraploids. Among ∼ 26, 000 annotated genes, over 1 % of gene transcripts showed rapid decay with an estimated half-life of less than 60 minutes, and they are called allotetraploid genes with unstable transcripts (AlloGUTs). Remarkably, 30 % of alloGUTs matched the nonadditively expressed genes, and their expression levels were negatively correlated with the decay rate. Compared to all genes, these nonadditively expressed alloGUTs were overrepresented 2 - 6 -fold in the Gene Ontology (GOSlim) classifications in response to abiotic and biotic stresses, signal transduction, and transcription. Interestingly, the AlloGUTs include transcription factor genes that are highly inducible under stress conditions and circadian clock regulators that regulate growth in A. thaliana. These data suggest a role of mRNA stability in homoeologous gene expression in Arabidopsis allopolyploids. The enrichment of nonadditively expressed genes in stress-related pathways were commonly observed in Arabidopsis and other allopolyploids such as wheat and cotton, which may suggest a role for stress-mediated growth vigor in hybrids and allopolyploids...|$|E

The results showed significant deviation from zero for values of A, B and C for all studied traits, indicating the in adequacy of the additive dominance model {{and the presence of}} non-allelic gene interaction. The additive and dominance gene effects and the types of epistasis, i. e., additive x additive, additive x dominance and dominance x dominance were important in the genetic system controlling for all studied traits in the two crosses. Dominance gene action (h) was the main types of gene effects for all studied traits in both crosses. The additive gene effects were found to be significant positive for days to flowering, number of pods/plant in the (cross 1), weight seeds/plant (g), total seed yield/kg feddan in the (cross 2), suggesting the potential for obtaining further improvements of these traits by using pedigree selection program. Duplicate epistasis was found for all studied traits in the two crosses.

40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{involving the}} testing {{of a number of}} soya bean varieties under a range of different photoperiods showed that all varieties were capable of flowering under all photoperiods tested, and appeared to be facultative short-day genotypes. Differential varietal responses were not obtained for flowering time at photoperiods of less than 12 hr per day, but the tropical varieties Mamloxi and Avoyelles differed markedly from the temperate variety Bienville in the flowering pattern under longer photoperiods. Other plant characters responded similarly to flowering time. Possible relationships of such responses to latitude of introduction, field adaptation in south-eastern Queensland, and screening of varietal accessions are discussed. Uniform frequency distributions of an F 2 population were obtained for most characters and photoperiods, which indicated a relatively complex form of inheritance. Skewness of some distributions, particularly in the longer photoperiods, suggested that the spectrum of action of genes determining these traits varied with photoperiod. Deviations from <b>mid-parent</b> <b>values</b> indicated dominance of low number of days to flowering, short node length, and high node number. Plant height approached that of the low parent in short photoperiods and the high parent in longer photoperiods. Transgressive segregation occurred for most traits, particularly in the longer photo-periods, and evidence of substantial genetic control of differences in photoperiodic response between varieties was found...|$|R
30|$|Generally, japonica {{varieties}} {{have higher}} BRRs than indica varieties. Wide variations of BRR {{are evident in}} rice germplasms, and most modern elite rice varieties show higher BRR than particular landraces (Luo and Yang 1998). Zhang and Peng (2012) reported {{that there was no}} significantly difference in the BRR, milled rice rate and head rice rate between reciprocal crosses. Although the factors determining the BRR have been studied for decades, no consensus has been reached. Chen et al.

These results are in accordance with the additive-dominance model, and indicate that high BRR shows complete dominance or partial dominance over low BRR. However, cytoplasm effect is not significant. Besides, BRR is controlled by nuclear genes but not by maternal effects and cytoplasm effects. However, little attention is focused on the genetic basis of BRR in previous studies. It is reported that hybrid BRR, head rice rate, as well as the male parent and <b>mid-parent</b> <b>values</b> have significantly positive correlations (Tan et al., 2000; Luo et al., 2014).

The complexity of the "yellow mouse syndrome" makes attainment of this objective dependent on the separation of those pleiotropic enzyme differences which are secondary, and depend on the background genome, from those which are primary, and depend primarily on the agouti locus genotype. —Four of nine hepatic enzyme activities assayed simultaneously differed between eight-week-old yellow (Ay/-, Avy/-) and non-yellow (A/-, a/a) male inbred and F 1 hybrid mice. Among these four, only cytoplasmic malic enzyme activity was elevated in all yellow mice, as compared with the non-yellow sibs, regardless of background genome. Glucokinase, serine dehydratase, and tyrosine α-ketoglutarate transaminase activities were also changed in yellow mice, but these alterations depended on the background genome. —The ratio of malic enzyme activity to citrate-cleavage enzyme activity, possibly related to the altered fat metabolism of yellow mice, was influenced by background genome {{as well as by the}} yellow genotype. ——Significant deviations of enzyme activities from <b>mid-parent</b> <b>values</b> among F 1 hybrids were associated with particular background genomes; the number of such deviations was larger among yellow mice than among non-yellows and this difference was greater among C 3 H F 1 hybrids than among C 57 BL/ 6 F 1 hybrids...|$|R

Combining ability was analyzed in 25 combinations made by 5 CMS lines and 5 restorer lines (North Carolina II mating design). The seed dormancy index of F 1 was positively and highly significantly correlated with those of their parents and <b>mid-parent</b> <b>value.</b> Out of the 109 combinations, 82 combinations showed mid-parent heterosis, and 43 heterobeltiosis. Seed dormancy indices of F 1 s and their parents declined dramatically in dehulled seeds compared with hulled seeds, indicating that the hull {{played an important role}} in seed dormancy. However, the trends were similar in hulled seeds and dehulled seeds in terms of relationships between the seed dormancy indicices in F 1 and their parents. The influence of hull on seed dormancy mainly depended on F 1 genotype, not on the hull from maternal parent. The variances of general combining ability (GCA) in female and male parents occupied 59. 2 % and 31. 1 % of total variance, respectively. The variance of specific combining ability (SCA) in combinations occupied 9. 7 % of total variance, indicating that gene additive effects were principal. Among the 5 CMS lines, II 112 A had the highest GCA effect for seed dormancy, followed by D 62 A. Among the 5 restorer lines, IR 112 had the highest GCA effect for seed dormancy, followed by 2786.

40|$|Allopolyploids {{are formed}} by the {{combination}} of evolutionarily-diverged genomes, the union of which leads to dynamic changes in gene expression and genome organization. Expression patterns of orthologous genes are rapidly and stochastically established in newly created allotetraploids, where gene silencing is maintained by microRNAs, DNA methylation, and other chromatin modifications. Among them, DNA methylation has been known as an important mechanism of epigenetic regulation of gene expression and chromatin structure. However, {{it is unclear how}} DNA methylation affects genome-wide expression of homoeologous genes in the natural polyploid Arabidopsis suecica that contains genome of both A. thaliana and A. arenosa. To understand the role that DNA methylation plays in the polyploidization process, a comparative analysis was performed comparing up- or down-regulated genes in met 1 -RNAi A. suecica lines with the non-additively expressed genes in the synthetic allotetraploids, i. e., different from the <b>mid-parent</b> <b>value.</b> The previous studies indicated that decreased DNA methylation in A. suecica induces A. arenosa-specific demethylation in centromere regions and differentially alters expression of > 200 genes encoding many transposons, unknown proteins and some other functional proteins that are located along chromosomes, whereas > 1, 300 non-additively expressed genes in the synthetic allotetraploids are distributed randomly along the chromosomes and encode various proteins in metabolism, energy, cellular biogenesis, cell defense and aging, and hormonal regulation. The origins of the progenitors of the genes whose expressions are altered in both met 1 -RNAi A. suecica and resynthesized allotetraploid were analyzed with single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis. Reactivated genes in met 1 -RNAi A. suecica lines were predominately derived from the A. thaliana genome in euchromatic regions, whereas the suppressed genes were mainly derived from the A.

There are many contradictive reports about the best parent selection criterion {{for the development of}} promising crosses. For the clarification of this problem field experiments were conducted for four consecutive years to compare the effectiveness of six criteria for the prediction of the most promising F- 3 populations in durum wheat (Triticum durum L.) : the <b>mid-parent</b> <b>value,</b> the F- 1, the F- 2, the (F- 1 + F- 2) / 2, and the genetic distance among the parents as it is calculated using the SSR and RAPD molecular markers. During the first growing season (2003 - 2004) nine commercial cultivars of durum wheat and four landraces were crossed. The following growing season (2004 - 2005), 17 crosses (F- 1 generation) were evaluated under low plant density (1. 15 plants m(- 2)) in a replicated (R- 21) honeycomb design. During the third growing season (2005 - 2006), the four highest yielding crosses, one cross with an intermediate yield, and the three crosses with the lowest yield (172 generation) were evaluated under low plant density in a R- 9 honeycomb design. Finally, in the fourth growing season (2006 - 2007) progeny of the aforementioned eight crosses (173 generation) and the ten parents were evaluated in a randomized complete block design in two locations. Furthermore, the genetic distance among the parents was determined using the SSR and RAPD molecular markers. It was observed that the three F- 3 populations with the lowest yielding ability were the ones with the lowest mid-parental value. In addition, one of the two top F- 3 populations was second in the rank according to the mid-parental value. Furthermore, the two top F- 3 populations were also the highest yielding in the F- 1 and F- 2 generations. On the contrary, none of these crosses were predicted by the genetic distance as it was calculated using the SSR and RAPID molecular markers. It was concluded that parental pairs with high mid-parental value and high combined yield (F- 1 + F- 2) / 2 obtained after evaluation of their F- 1 and F- 2 at low plant density was {{the most effective way to}} predict promising F 3 populations.

To estimate quantitative-genetic parameters for sorghum under variable stress conditions, {{three sets of}} factorial crosses between four by four lines each were grown with parents and a local cultivar in eight macro-environments in semi-arid areas of Kenya. Fourteen traits were recorded including grain yield, above-ground drymatter, harvest index, days to anthesis, leaf rolling score, and stay-green. Environmental means for grain yield ranged from 167 to 595 g m- 2. Mean hybrid superiority over <b>mid-parent</b> <b>values</b> was 47, 31, and 9 % for grain yield, above-ground drymatter, and harvest index, respectively. Differences among both lines and hybrids were highly significant for all traits. Genotype × environment interaction variances were larger than genotypic variances for grain yield, above-ground drymatter, and harvest index. Corresponding heritabilities ranged between 0. 72 and 0. 84. Variation among hybrids was determined by GCA and SCA effects for most characters.

40|$|Hybrid weakness, a {{phenomenon}} opposite to heterosis, refers to inferior {{growth and development}} in a hybrid relative to its pure-line parents. Little {{attention has been paid}} to the phenomenological or mechanistic aspect of hybrid weakness, probably due to its rare occurrence. Here, using a set of interspecific triploid F 1 hybrids between Oryza sativa, ssp. japonica (genome AA) and a tetraploid wild rice species, O. alta (genome, CCDD), we investigated the phenotypic and physiological differences between the F 1 hybrids and their parents under normal and nitrogen-limiting conditions. We quantified the expression levels of 21 key genes involved in three important pathways pertinent to the assayed phenotypic and physiological traits by real-time qRT-PCR. Further, we assayed expression partitioning of parental alleles for eight genes in the F 1 hybrids relative to the in silico "hybrids" (parental cDNA mixture) under both normal and N-limiting conditions by using locus-specific cDNA pyrosequencing. We report that the F 1 hybrids showed weakness in several phenotypic traits at the final seedling-stage compared with their corresponding <b>mid-parent</b> <b>values</b> (MPVs). Nine of the 21 studied genes showed contrasted expression levels between hybrids and parents (MPVs) under normal vs. N-limiting conditions. Interestingly, under N-limiting conditions, the overtly enhanced partitioning of maternal allele expression in the hybrids for eight assayed genes echo their attenuated hybrid weakness in phenotypes, an observation further bolstered by more resemblance of hybrids to the maternal parent under N-limiting conditions compared to normal conditions in a suite of measured physiological traits. Our observations suggest that both overall expression level and differential partitioning of parental alleles of critical genes contribute to condition-specific hybrid weakness...|$|R
40|$|Variability in {{the colour}} of {{lepidopteran}} larvae {{has been recorded}} in {{a broad range of}} species, yet little is known of its evolutionary significance, or whether it has a genetic basis. I assess the role of genes and environment in determining the degree of larval melanization in the moth, Mamestra brassicae, and examine functional aspects of larval pigmentation. In particular, whether melanization is of importance in thermoregulation, and whether larvae differing in melanization exhibit concurrent differences in size, rate of development, and fecundity. In the fourth and fifth instars, larval M. brassicae exhibit a continuous range of colour from pale green to black: a classification scheme is described to quantify this variation. Heritability (h 2) was measured using regression of brood means against <b>mid-parent</b> <b>values</b> for 36 broods (2339 offspring), and was estimated to be 0. 237 0. 07 (SD) for fourth instar larvae and 0. 421 0. 10 (SD) for fifth instar larvae. However, environmental factors mediated development of larval colour: larvae were darker when reared at low temperature (12 °C) compared to high (24 °C). Direct measurement of larval temperatures using thermocouples inserted into the alimentary canal indicated that dark larvae absorbed more radiant heat, and thus under illumination consistently maintained a higher body temperature than pale larvae. Hence dark larvae are presumed to be at a selective advantage at low ambient temperatures, and increased melanization of larvae reared at low temperatures may be adaptive. I suggest that variation within natural populations may be maintained by fluctuating weather conditions. Dark larvae were found to be smaller, but developed more quickly than light larvae so that weight at pupation, time to pupation, and fecundity (measured by the number of fertile eggs produced) did not differ according to colour. Further studies are suggested to examine the influence of larval colour on thermoregulation, growth rates and predation in the fie...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Allopolyploidy is a preeminent {{process in}} plant {{evolution}} {{that results from}} the merger of distinct genomes in a common nucleus via inter-specific hybridization. Allopolyploid formation is usually related to genome-wide structural and functional changes though the underlying mechanisms operating during this "genomic shock" still remain poorly known. The aim {{of the present study}} was to investigate the modifications occurring at the proteomic level following an allopolyploidization event and to determine whether these changes are related to functional properties of the proteins. In a previous report, we applied comparative proteomics to synthetic amphiploids of Brassica napus and to its diploid progenitors B. rapa and B. oleracea. Although several hundred polypeptides displayed additivity (i. e. mid-parent values) in the amphiploids, many of them showed non-additivity. Here, we report the in silico functional characterization of the "non-additive" proteins (the ones with a non-additive pattern of regulation) in synthetic B. napus. Results The complete set of non-additive proteins (335 in the stem and 205 in the root), as well as a subset of additive polypeptides (200 per organ), was identified by mass spectrometry. Several protein isoforms were found, and most of them (~ 55 %) displayed "different" or "opposite" patterns of regulation in the amphiploids, i. e. isoforms of the same protein showing both up-regulation and down-regulation in the synthetic B. napus compared to the <b>mid-parent</b> <b>value.</b> Components of protein complexes were identified of which ~ 50 % also displayed "different" or "opposite" patterns of regulation in the allotetraploids. In silico functional categorization of the identified proteins was carried out, and showed that neither functional category nor metabolic pathway were systematically affected by non-additivity in the synthetic amphiploids. In addition, no subcellular compartment was found to be over- or under-represented among the proteins displaying non-additive values in the allopolyploids. Conclusion Protein identification showed that functionally related polypeptides (isoforms and complex subunits) could be differentially regulated in synthetic B. napus in comparison to its diploid progenitors while such proteins are usually expected to display co-regulation. The genetic redundancy within an allopolyploid could explain why functionally related proteins could display imbalanced levels of expression. No functional category, no metabolic pathway and no subcellular localization was found to be over- or under-represented within non-additive polypeptides, suggesting that the differential regulation of gene products was not related to functional properties of the proteins. Thus, at the protein level, there is no evidence for the "genomic shock" expected in neo-polyploids and the overall topology of protein networks and metabolic pathways is conserved in synthetic allotetraploids of B. napus in comparison to its diploid progenitors B. rapa and B. oleracea. </p...|$|E
40|$|Pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum (L.) R. Br.) is an {{important}} staple crop for millions of poor rural households in the semi-arid tropics of Asia and Africa. Owing to its importance for addressing micronutrient malnutrition problem, especially iron (Fe) and zinc (Zn) concentration, considerable global efforts {{are under way to}} improve its Fe and Zn levels through genetic enhancement. Hence, this dissertation was aimed at investigating some of the factors that have direct bearing on breeding efficiency. These includes gene action, combining ability and heterosis for Fe and Zn, intra-population variance, efficiency of single plant selection, association of grain Fe and Zn concentration with grain yield and key agronomic traits (1000 -grain mass and flowering), and response to recurrent selection. In two sets of line x tester studies, parents were observed having a wide range of genetic variability for both grain Fe (34 - 102 mg kg- 1) and Zn (34 - 84 mg kg- 1) concentration and this was also reflected in both sets of hybrids. over two season, ICMB 93222, ICMB 98222, 863 B, ICMB 95333, ICMB 96333 among seed parents (lines) and IPC 774, IPC 616, IPC 1650, IPC 1178, IPC 536 and IPC 735 amongst pollen parents (testers) were found to have > 60 mg kg- 1 Fe and > 55 mg kg- 1 Zn concentration. All these inbreds are designated seed/pollinator parents in elite genetic backgrounds, indicating good scope for their effective use in hybrid and hybrid parents breeding. The predictability ratio was around unity for all traits, revealing the predominance of GCA (additive) variance controlling these traits in both the sets. Highly significant positive correlation between <b>mid-parent</b> <b>value</b> and per se performance of hybrids further confirmed the predominant role of additive gene action for these traits. using both parameters (per se performance and positive significant gca effect), ICMB 93222, ICMB 98222, 863 b, ICMB 91222, IPC 1650, IPC 843, IPC 774, IPC 1178, IPC 689 and IPC 735 were identified as good general combiners for grain Fe and Zn in hybrid breeding. similarly, 863 B x IPC 404 and ICMB 95333 x IPC 404 for both grain Fe and Zn, while ICMB 94111 x IPC 1178 and ICMB 89111 x IPC 843 for grain Zn had positive significant sca effects. Low level of heterosis over mid-parent for grain Fe and Zn, no hybrid with significant heterosis over better-parent, and largely additive genetic variances would imply that there would be little opportunity, to exploit heterosis for these traits. In fact, to breed hybrids with high Fe and Zn levels, these micronutrients will have to be incorporated in both parental lines. Higher degree of positive and highly significant correlation between S 0 plants and their respective S 1 progenies both for grain Fe and Zn in all four populations indicated that individual plant performance for these micronutrients can be as effectively used for selection as the S 1 progeny performance. Highly significant positive correlation between Fe and Zn revealed good prospects of concurrent genetic improvement for both micronutrients. Recurrent selection for high grain Fe and Zn in two populations increased Fe concentration by 2. 4...|$|E
40|$|Tail {{length in}} {{laboratory}} Peromyscus maniculatus X P- polionotus hybrids was intermediate in all crosses, but hind foot and other size characters {{were subject to}} pronounced maternal effect. Most tail growth occurred postnatally at a nearly linear rate and attained <b>mid-parent</b> <b>values</b> before five weeks of age. Size characters showing more exponential growth rates failed to overcome maternal growth inhibition during postnatal growth. Body-tail allometry was not maintained in the Fx hybrids. Tail length of rodents is useful for study of genetic and environ-mental effects during growth and development, {{as demonstrated by the}} investigations of Sumner (1915), Harrison et al. (1959), Barnett (1965), Hosier (1969) and others. Growth of the tail is comparatively labile, and may be influenced strongly by factors such as temperature. There is also considerable genetic variation in number of caudal verte-brae among inbred strains of rats and mice. Since certain Peromyscus species hybrids exhibit an interesting opposite heterotic maternal effect for size factors, observations on tail growth in these hybrids should be informative. An unusual pattern of size inheritance was previously reported (Dawson, 1965) among species hybrids of the deermouse (P. manicu-latus) and the oldfield mouse (P. polionotus). Ft hybrids born to P. maniculatus females (MPFj) are distinctly smaller than either of the parent species, while reciprocal hybrids (PMFi) are larger. The larger parent female (P. maniculatus) bears the smaller hybrid and vice versa. These generalizations are true for body weight and length from birth until adulthood. It is even more accentuated in average placental weight, with a nearly six-fold difference between reciprocal hybrids (Rogers and Dawson, 1970). The objective {{of this study was to}} compare Peromyscus hybrid tail growth with other aspects of growth, particularly hind foot, since this 35...|$|R

When the hybrids were evaluated individually, {{it was determined that}} the traits other than protein content exhibited positive or negative heterosis, whereas for protein content, heterosis was always positive.

40|$|The {{influence}} of male body {{weight on the}} aggressive and mating behaviour of male Gryllus integer was studied under laboratory conditions. The relationship between adult age and weight was first determined; female weight increased and male weight decreased with age. Virgin males that had been isolated since the adult molt were paired for similar age and a difference in weight of greater than 200 mg. Paired males and a virgin female were observed in a glass arena for 24 {{minutes or until a}} mating occurred. Larger males mated significantly more often than smaller males. Larger males attacked more often, were more successful in aggressive encounters and had more contact with the female. Males that did not mate had lower rates of courtship and mounts than males that mated. Females in trials that did not result in a mating were signifcantly heavier than females in trials that resulted in a mating. Larger males that mated were significantly closer in weight to the weight of the female than larger males in trials that did not result in a mating. Larger males in trials that did not result in a mating had higher rates of aggressive stridulation than larger males that mated. Male weight is therefore important in mating success; fitness traits should theoretically show low genetic variability. However, significant heritability values were found for live weight, dry weight, head width, pronotum width and length, hind femur length and forewing length when estimated from the regression of offspring on <b>mid-parent</b> <b>values,</b> offspring and female and male values separately and full-sib correlations. The heritability of hind femur width was significant when estimated from the regression of offspring on male parent and from full-sib correlations. Heritability estimates of forewing length were significantly higher when estimated from the regression of offspring on female parent than when estimated from the regression of offspring on male parent. High phenotypic, genetic and environmental correlations were found between all pairs of traits. Data on male mating success and the heritability of fitness traits were discussed in terms of the maintenance of genetic variability...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Alteration in gene {{expression}} resulting from allopolyploidization is a prominent feature in plants, but its spectrum and extent {{are not fully}} known. Common wheat (Triticum aestivum) was formed via allohexaploidization about 10, 000 years ago, and became the most important crop plant. To gain further insights into the genome-wide transcriptional dynamics associated {{with the onset of}} common wheat formation, we conducted microarray-based genome-wide {{gene expression}} analysis on two newly synthesized allohexaploid wheat lines with chromosomal stability and a genome constitution analogous to that of the present-day common wheat. Results Multi-color GISH (genomic in situ hybridization) was used to identify individual plants from two nascent allohexaploid wheat lines between Triticum turgidum (2 n = 4 x = 28; genome BBAA) and Aegilops tauschii (2 n = 2 x = 14; genome DD), which had a stable chromosomal constitution analogous to that of common wheat (2 n = 6 x = 42; genome BBAADD). Genome-wide analysis of gene expression was performed for these allohexaploid lines along with their parental plants from T. turgidum and Ae. tauschii, using the Affymetrix Gene Chip Wheat Genome-Array. Comparison with the parental plants coupled with inclusion of empirical <b>mid-parent</b> <b>values</b> (MPVs) revealed that whereas the great majority of genes showed the expected parental additivity, two major patterns of alteration in gene expression in the allohexaploid lines were identified: parental dominance expression and non-additive expression. Genes involved in each of the two altered expression patterns could be classified into three distinct groups, stochastic, heritable and persistent, based on their transgenerational heritability and inter-line conservation. Strikingly, whereas both altered patterns of gene expression showed a propensity of inheritance, identity of the involved genes was highly stochastic, consistent with the involvement of diverse Gene Ontology (GO) terms. Nonetheless, those genes showing non-additive expression exhibited a significant enrichment for vesicle-function. Conclusions Our results show that two patterns of global alteration in gene expression are conditioned by allohexaploidization in wheat, that is, parental dominance expression and non-additive expression. Both altered patterns of gene expression but not the identity of the genes involved are likely to play functional roles in stabilization and establishment of the newly formed allohexaploid plants, and hence, relevant to speciation and evolution of T. aestivum. </p...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1999 Best scan {{available}} for pages with "screen shots". Originals are dark. Heritability {{in the narrow}} sense and in the broad sense, variance components and correlation coefficients are important genetic parameters in a breeding program. The estimates of these parameters can provide important information for a breeder {{in the selection of}} parents, the most efficient design for evaluation of seedlings and advanced selections and the choice of selection strategy to improve many target traits simultaneously. In addition, histograms showing the distributions of the traits in offspring may provide additional information about parent combinations for the improvement of target traits. The Oregon State University hazelnut breeding program is developing improved varieties for the kernel market. Estimates of genetic parameters for most traits of interest are not available. Seventy seven trees representing 41 genotypes and 35 progenies were used to investigate midparent values and progeny means for 17 traits, including 13 kernel and nut traits, and 4 phenological traits, for three years. Estimates for heritability in the narrow sense are all high, ranging from 0. 56 for amount of kernel fiber, and 0. 58 for date of opening of female flowers to 0. 87 for percent kernel, 0. 88 for nut compression index and 0. 89 for nut depth. Therefore, progeny means can be predicted from <b>mid-parent</b> <b>values</b> and response to selection is expected to be rapid for the improvement of all traits. The analysis of variance components revealed that genotypic variance accounted for most of the phenotypic variance. Although significant, the genotype X year interaction only accounted for a very small part of the phenotypic variance. It suggested one year's evaluation of genotypes for all traits should be sufficient except for nut weight, kernel weight, number of nuts per cluster, fiber amount, nut maturity, time of catkin elongation, and time of opening of female flowers. Genetic and phenotypic correlation coeficients were large and positive for nut size traits (nut length, width, depth, nut weight and kernel weight). Phenological traits (date of opening of female flowers, time of catkin elongation and time of leafing out) were also highly and positively correlated. But most other traits were uncorrelated with each other. Therefore, selection of parents with round nuts of medium size, high...|$|R

This study investigated the genetic variability and inheritance for test weight, as well as the associations between test weight and other agronomic traits, for matings among elite inbred oat lines. Populations or segregates, each consisting of 50 random F 2 : 3 lines, were developed from 13 biparental matings for experiment I (Exp. I). For experiment II (Exp. II), a Design II mating plan with six sets was utilized to intermate 24 inbred oat lines. Evaluations of oat lines in Exps. I and II were conducted in 1987 and 1988, respectively, in randomized complete block designs with four replications at each of three locations in Iowa;The phenotypic distributions of segregates from matings in Exp. I were normal for test weight, and offspring means for test weight were similar to <b>mid-parent</b> <b>values.</b> Transgressive segregation occurred in most matings, but low-test-weight transgressive segregates were more frequent than high transgressive lines. Genotypic variances for test weight were significant (P ≤ 0. 01) for all oat matings, and heritabilities for test weight, calculated on an entry mean basis, ranged from 63 to 91 %;Both general and specific combining ability effects (GCA and SCA) were significant (P ≤ 0. 01) for all traits in Exp. II, but GCA effects accounted for 75, 85, 82, 72, and 85 % of the variability among crosses for test weight, grain yield, harvest index, date of heading, and plant height, respectively. Contrasts of parent versus offspring means were significant only for date of heading, indicating that heterosis was small for the other traits. Because the variance of SCA effects among F 2 : 3 lines equals 1 / 4 [sigma][superscript] 2 D + 1 / 2 [sigma][superscript] 2 AA, and because [sigma][superscript] 2 D seemed to be small for these traits, additive x additive epistasis may have been the primary gene action causing significant non-additive variance;For most of the matings in Exps. I and II, test weight was positively associated with grain yield, groat percent, and 200 -seed weight, and negatively associated with date of heading. These correlations were generally small, however, and factor analyses showed that test weight was largely independent (37 to 70 % communality) from other traits.

Knowledge on the genetic bases of popping ability is relevant for common bean improvement. Progenies derived from two nuña bean crosses were used in a generation mean based mating design to determine the inheritance and gene action for five popping related traits: length of popped seeds (PSL), popping dimension index (PDI), percentage of un-popped seeds (PUS), popping percentage average (PPA) and expansion coefficient (EC). Significant additive gene effects were found for all traits, and was {{the only source of}} the observed variation for PSL, while dominance and higher-order interactions among loci contributed to the genetic divergence for the other traits. The dominance of the cultivated over nuña alleles for PDI, PPA, EC and PUS, was confirmed by high <b>mid-parent</b> heterosis <b>values</b> and generation mean comparisons. The [d] and [dd] gene effects were in opposite direction for PPA and EC, indicating duplicate epistasis. Therefore, epistasis is likely to be an important explanation for the heterosis in both traits. For PDI and PUS, the opposite signs for [aa] and [dd] gene effects indicated that the genes for increasing popping are dispersed between the parents. Generation means and variances of BC 1 P 2 indicated advantages of the backcross breeding procedure to improve the adaptation of the exotic germplasm and at the same time, transfer part of the desired donor genes to cultivated common bean.

40|$|The unique {{topography}} of New Zealand creates a wide variation in rainfall and temperature between {{and within the}} two islands of the country. As a result, successful use of perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.), the backbone of New Zealand’s agricultural economy, has been restricted to only the higher rainfall and cooler areas of the country. However, there has been only limited analysis of drought resistance in forage grasses at the trait level. This PhD study was conducted on a perennial ryegrass cultivar “Medea” developed in Adelaide in the 1960 ’s from reportedly drought resistant and summer dormant germplasm of North African origin. The main objectives {{of the study were}} to compare Medea with a high yielding but drought susceptible current New Zealand cultivar, Grasslands Samson for their drought resistance potential and to evaluate Medea for its suitability for introgression with Grasslands Samson, in a plant improvement programme. Drought resistance strategies of Tolosa, Matrix and Ceres One 50 were also evaluated. In total six glasshouse experiments were conducted. Experiment 1 (April – September 2008) compared winter vegetative growth of potted plants of Grasslands Samson and Medea. Yield of Medea was < 50 % that of Grasslands Samson, but glasshouse temperature at times exceeded 25 °C, so it is possible that this temperature was high enough to partially trigger summer dormancy in Medea. In Experiment 2 (summer 2008 – 2009) techniques for assessing drought resistance were developed, and in Experiment 2 and Experiment 5 (summer 2009 – 2010) drought resistance strategies exhibited by individual cultivars were evaluated. Experiment 2 included Medea, Grasslands Samson, an unreleased tetraploid breeding line developed from Grasslands Samson and Tolosa. Experiment 5 evaluated Matrix and Ceres One 50, in addition to Grasslands Samson and Medea. Drought resistance strategies observed in Medea included deep rootedness and high leaf proline contents, but there was some evidence for lack of transpiration reduction in water deficit stress. Medea had prolific flowering. Grasslands Samson and its tetraploid were more productive than Medea in these experiments. However, Tolosa produced the same shoot DW as Grasslands Samson with greater retention of soil moisture, indicating higher water use efficiency. Experiment 3 (March 2009 – February 2010) compared five family groups, each comprising a Grasslands Samson and a Medea parent, and three of their F 1 progeny. In this experiment plants were 11 months old when root traits were evaluated and for these older plants, Grasslands Samson had a higher root to shoot ratio and deep rootedness than Medea. Medea plants had similar shoot DW to Grasslands Samson plants during winter, but 46 % lower shoot DW in summer. The F 1 progeny showed positive mid-parent heterosis for deep rootedness, but negative mid-parent heterosis for shoot DW, and tended to reflect the prolific flowering of the Medea parent. Experiment 4 (December 2009 – June 2010) compared six family groups of F 2 progeny for traits related to drought resistance. Although plant numbers were small compared with a commercial breeding programme, it was evident some family groups combined both drought resistance and productivity traits. Experiment 6 (September 2011 – February 2012) evaluated Grasslands Samson, Medea, and F 1 and F 2 progeny for drought resistance traits. Some useful traits expressed strongly in the F 1 generation reverted to <b>mid-parent</b> <b>values</b> in the F 2 generation. Some genotypes of Grasslands Samson exhibited higher water use efficiency (reduced soil moisture extraction with high shoot DW) and this warrants further research. It is concluded that some desirable genes for traits contributing to drought resistance, such as deep rootedness and osmotic adjustment might be obtained from Medea. However, the drought resistance strategy of Medea involving reduction in plant size in summer, deep rooting and comparatively high transpiration would have pros and cons for New Zealand farmers as a trait combination. Reduced depletion of soil moisture under water deficit might assist survival of companion plants such as white clover; but high transpiration would decrease water use efficiency. Therefore, improving the water use efficiency of Grasslands Samson or use of material such as Tolosa, which has a comparatively low soil water use per unit of dry matter produced among the cultivars tested, would appear to be a preferred breeding strategy for future breeding programmes in New Zealand...|$|R
