5|$|The Rosetta Stone was {{originally}} displayed at a slight angle from the horizontal, and rested within a <b>metal</b> <b>cradle</b> {{that was made}} for it, which involved shaving off very small portions of its sides {{to ensure that the}} cradle fitted securely. It originally had no protective covering, and it was found necessary by 1847 to place it in a protective frame, despite the presence of attendants to ensure that it was not touched by visitors. Since 2004, the conserved stone has been on display in a specially built case in the centre of the Egyptian Sculpture Gallery. A replica of the Rosetta Stone is now available in the King's Library of the British Museum, without a case and free to touch, as it would have appeared to early 19th-century visitors.|$|E
5000|$|Demonic Resurrection {{describe}} their music as blackened death metal, {{though it can}} also be called symphonic black <b>metal.</b> <b>Cradle</b> of Filth, Dimmu Borgir, Emperor, Depresy, Cannibal Corpse are some of the bands that have influenced the band from the earliest albums.Use of signature black and death metal motifs like growling vocals, shrieked vocals, highly distorted guitars played with tremolo picking, blast beats and double bass drumming along with ambient keyboards and clean vocal passages often serving as a bridge between two heavy parts is prevalent. All through the [...] "Darkness" [...] trilogy, Demonic Resurrection have stayed clear of the purist tags and their latest release sees their music as a mixture of black and death metal with elements of power metal easily visible, most notably attributed to acts like Blind Guardian and Angra. The clean passages in songs like [...] "Lords of Pestilence" [...] along with the ambient keyboards give it a very progressive feel not unlike bands like Opeth. Also not distinct is the fact that Demonic Resurrection have chosen a very polished and sophisticated production, style as opposed to the raw production usually seen on black and death metal records.|$|E
