25|$|On May 23, 1994, in {{an overall}} deal in which News Corporation also {{acquired}} a 20% equity {{interest in the}} company, New World Communications signed a long-term affiliation agreement with Fox, {{as part of the}} network's strategy to strengthen its affiliate portfolio (then composed mostly of UHF outlets with limited to no prior history as major network affiliates) after the National Football League (NFL) awarded it the television rights to the National Football Conference (NFC), a four-year contract that began with the 1994 NFL season, on December 18, 1993. One of the twelve television stations affiliated with either CBS, ABC or NBC that were involved in the deal was KDFW, which had been affiliated with CBS since it signed on in December 1949 and—along with CBS affiliate KTBC in Austin and ABC affiliate KTVI in St. Louis—was added to the agreement as a byproduct of New World's $717 million purchase of four stations owned by Argyle Television Holdings on May 26. With thirteen months left until CBS's contract with KDFW—which, {{as a result of the}} agreement with New World, would replace existing owned-and-operated station KDAF (channel 33, now a CW affiliate) as the market's Fox station, resulting in Fox Television Stations selling KDAF to Renaissance Broadcasting—was set to expire on July 1, 1995, KXAS was the first station that the network had approached to become its new Dallas-Fort Worth affiliate. LIN Broadcasting turned down the offer; however as WFAA was already under contract with ABC through a <b>multi-station</b> agreement with Belo, this later prompted CBS to sign a deal with KTVT through an agreement it signed with Gaylord Broadcasting on September 14, 1994, in exchange for also switching its sister independent station in Tacoma, Washington, KSTW (now a CW owned-and-operated station), to the network.|$|E

40|$|Observing meteors {{from the}} {{stratosphere}} improves detection efficiency thanks to much lower extinction. Previous airborne missions have already monitored meteor outbursts. However {{due to their}} cost these missions are not suitable for annual meteor shower maxima. Thus meteor video detection with low-light cameras on-board weather balloons is a good approach to observe meteors in such ideal conditions [2]. The SPanish Meteor Network (SPMN) has 25 video and CCD observing stations currently operational [3 - 5]. The recording of <b>multi-stations</b> meteors and fireballs each night is only jeopardised by bad weather conditions. However the addition of balloon observations can improve observational results with bad weather during meteor maxima. During the Geminids 2012 activity peak the Fireball and Meteor group of the Universidad Complutense de Madrid[6] launched a balloon in collaboration with Proyecto Daedalus [1]. During that night the sky was unfortunately covered in several SPMN stations of central Spain. However the camera on-board our balloon detected several Geminids from the troposphere and the stratosphere, allowing double-station detection with stations with clear skies located over more distant SPMN stations in the Iberian Peninsula...|$|R
40|$|Unlike in {{the open}} sea, the use of wind {{information}} for forecasting waves may encounter more ambiguous uncertainties in the coastal or harbor area due {{to the influence of}} complicated geometric configurations. Thus this paper attempts to forecast the waves based on learning the characteristics of observed waves, rather than the use of the wind information. This is reported in this paper by the application of the artificial neural network (ANN), in which the back-propagation algorithm is employed in the learning process for obtaining the desired results. This model evaluated the interconnection weights among <b>multi-stations</b> based on the previous short-term data, from which a time series of waves at a station can be generated for forecasting or data supplement based on using the neighbor stations data. Field data are used for testing the applicability of the ANN model. The results show that the ANN model performs well for both wave forecasting and data supplement when using a short-term observed wave data. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Taiwan is tectonically {{situated}} in a terrain resulting from the oblique collision between the Philippine Sea plate and the continental margin of the Asiatic plate, with a continuous stress causing the density of strong-moderate earthquakes and regional active faults. The continuous time series of soil radon for earthquake studies have been recorded and some significant variations associated with strong earthquakes have been observed. Earthquake prediction is not still operative but these correlations should {{be added to the}} literature about seismo-geochemical transients associated to strong earthquakes. Rain-pore pressure related variations, crustal weakness at the studied faults system is consistent with the simultaneous radon anomalies observed. During the observations, a significant increase of soil radon concentrations was observed at Chunglun-T 1 (CL-T 1), Hsinhua (HH), Pingtung (PT), and Chihshan (CS) stations approximately two weeks before the Meinong earthquake (ML = 6. 6, 6 February 2016) in Southern Taiwan.

2500|$|One of the {{interesting}} problems in Schumann resonances studies is determining the lightning source characteristics (the [...] "inverse problem"). Temporally resolving each individual flash is impossible because the mean rate of excitation by lightning, ~50 lightning events per second globally, mixes up the individual contributions together. [...] However, occasionally extremely large lightning flashes occur which produce distinctive signatures that {{stand out from the}} background signals. Called [...] "Q-bursts", they are produced by intense lightning strikes that transfer large amounts of charge from clouds to the ground and often carry high peak current. Q-bursts can exceed the amplitude of the background signal level by a factor of 10 or more and appear with intervals of ~10 s, which allows to consider them as isolated events and determine the source lightning location. The source location is determined with either <b>multi-station</b> or single-station techniques and requires assuming a model for the Earth–ionosphere cavity. The <b>multi-station</b> techniques are more accurate, but require more complicated and expensive facilities.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} {{accompany}} the increasing variety of costumers' demands, manufacturers tend to produce different models of the same product on an assembly line by introducing group assembly (GA) design concepts that improve the flexibility of assembly systems. Generally, when the demand {{for a set of}} similar products is relatively low and the set-up time is significant, the beneficial effects of the task repeatability of the straight line configuration are difficult to achieve. As a consequence, the fixed-point assembly philosophy is often preferred. This paper addresses the application of a mixed-model assembly balancing problem to an assembly-to-order environment in the case of low production rates and large number of tasks. The aim of this work is to propose an alternative design procedure for the balancing of semi-automated and mixed-model assembly systems under low product demand effects by the application of multi-turn circular transfers, such as a <b>multi-stations</b> rotating table. This layout configuration permits a job enlargement for human operators and, at the same time, provides an increment in task repeatability through the work-pieces assembling by increasing the number of the turns of the transfer. Finally, the developed heuristic procedure is tested on a simple rotating table assembly cell, a partial representation of a complete assembly system of domestic air compressors...|$|R
40|$|International audienceTEC data, {{obtained}} from over 60 GPS stations, {{were used to}} study the ionospheric effects of the 12 ? 16 September 1999 magnetic storm over Europe. The spatial and temporal changes of the ionosphere were analysed as a time series of TEC maps, which present 15 min averages of TEC. The data set consisting of GPS observations, collected by a dense network of European stations, with sampling rate of 30 s, enable the creation of TEC maps with high spatial and temporal resolution. The storm included the positive {{as well as the}} negative phase. The positive phase took place during the first storm day of 12 September 1999. The short-lived daytime TEC enhancement was observed at all latitudes. The maximal enhancement reached a factor of 1. 3 ? 1. 5. On the second and third days, the negative phase of the storm developed. The TEC decrease was registered regardless of time of the day. The TEC depression exceeded 70 % relative to quiet days. On the following days (15 and 16 September), a significant daytime enhancement of TEC was observed once again. The complex occurrence of the ionospheric storm was probably related to the features of development of the magnetic storm. We found out that during the storm the large and medium-scale irregularities developed in the high-latitude ionosphere. The <b>multi-stations</b> technique, employed to create TEC maps, was particularly successful while studying the mid-latitude ionospheric trough.
