5|$|The war-time economy {{provided}} a boom to Indiana's industry and agriculture, {{which led to}} more urbanization throughout the 1920s. By 1925, <b>more</b> <b>workers</b> were employed in industry than in agriculture in Indiana. Indiana's greatest industries were steel production, iron, automobiles, and railroad cars.|$|E
5|$|The CMLL World Heavyweight Championship (Campeonato Mundial Completo de CMLL in Spanish) is a singles {{professional}} wrestling championship {{promoted by}} Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL). The Championship {{has been in}} existence since 1991. Unlike other heavyweight titles such as the WWE Championship or the IWGP Heavyweight Championship, {{it is not the}} main championship in the promotion because CMLL has emphasized the lower weight levels since there are <b>more</b> <b>workers</b> in the lower levels. The title was the first to be created after Empresa Mexicana de la Lucha Libre changed its name to Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre in the early 1990s.|$|E
5|$|The CPS men served without {{wages and}} minimal {{support from the}} federal government. The cost of {{maintaining}} the CPS camps and providing {{for the needs of}} the men was the responsibility of their congregations and families. CPS men served longer than regular draftees and were not released until well {{after the end of the}} war. Initially skeptical of the program, government agencies learned to appreciate the men's service and requested <b>more</b> <b>workers</b> from the program. CPS made significant contributions to forest fire prevention, erosion and flood control, medical science and reform of the mental health system.|$|E

50|$|The {{execution}} units, called tasks, are executed concurrently {{on one or}} <b>more</b> <b>worker</b> nodes using multiprocessing, eventlet or gevent. Tasks can execute asynchronously (in the background) or synchronously (wait until ready). Celery is used {{in production}} systems, for instance Instagram, to process millions of tasks every day.|$|R
40|$|Minimum hourly wages were {{randomly}} imposed on firms posting job openings {{in an online}} labor market. A higher minimum wage raised the wages of hired workers substantially. However, there was some reduction in hiring and large reductions in hours-worked. Treated firms hired <b>more</b> productive <b>workers,</b> which can explain, in part, the reduction in hours-worked: with <b>more</b> productive <b>workers,</b> projects were completed in less time. At {{the conclusion of the}} experiment, the platform imposed a market-wide minimum wage. A difference-in-differences analysis shows that, in equilibrium, firms still substitute towards <b>more</b> productive <b>workers,</b> adversely affecting less productive workers...|$|R

25|$|Growth is a {{function}} of the worker to larvae ratio. The <b>more</b> <b>workers</b> there are, the more opportunities there are for larvae to be fed. In B. petiolata, this ratio increased during November and December. This is the time period when gynes were being reared, indicating that there are <b>more</b> <b>workers</b> available to give food to the young that will become a part of the highest caste and need the most nutrition. The amount of food given to larvae influences caste.|$|E
25|$|In 2011, the Israeli {{government}} offered Intel $290 {{million to}} expand in the country. As a condition, Intel would employ 1,500 <b>more</b> <b>workers</b> in Kiryat Gat and between 600–1000 workers in the north.|$|E

Iometer performs Asynchronous I/O - accessing files or block devices (later one allowing to bypass the file system buffers).|$|R
25|$|The {{opportunity}} to lay {{eggs in a}} colony is determined by dominance ranking. The queen is the most dominant individual and has the only power to mate and lay eggs. Female workers remain in the nest and do not mate with males. Ovary development in workers is suppressed by dominance interactions from the queen, as well as dominance interactions from the <b>more</b> dominant <b>workers</b> to the <b>more</b> subordinate <b>workers.</b> This results with <b>more</b> dominant <b>workers</b> having <b>more</b> developed ovaries, but still less developed than the queen’s. If the queen dies or is removed, then the most dominant worker will take her place as the new reproductive.|$|R
25|$|<b>More</b> <b>workers</b> and new {{immigrants}} encouraged a nascent {{trade union movement}} among skilled craftsmen. Hamilton unionists and other working-class people gave birth in 1872 the Nine Hour Movement, urging the government to limit working hours to nine per day.|$|E
25|$|The Lattimer {{massacre}} was {{the violent}} deaths of 19 unarmed striking immigrant anthracite coal miners at the Lattimer mine near Hazleton, Pennsylvania, on September 10, 1897. The miners, mostly of Polish, Slovak, Lithuanian and German ethnicity, were {{shot and killed}} by a Luzerne County sheriff's posse. Scores <b>more</b> <b>workers</b> were wounded.|$|E
25|$|The {{legislature}} amended Romney's plan, {{adding a}} Medicaid expansion {{for children and}} imposing an assessment on firms with 11 or <b>more</b> <b>workers</b> who do not offer health coverage. The assessment is intended to equalize the contributions to the free care pool from employers that offer and do not offer coverage. The General Court also rejected Romney's provision allowing high-deductible health plans.|$|E
40|$|Are {{migrants}} <b>more</b> productive <b>workers</b> than nonmigrants? Such {{a comparison}} concerns both observed and unobservable productivity factors. This paper {{focuses on the}} correlation between unobservable factors at places of origin and destination. A human capital model of migration demonstrates that <b>more</b> productive <b>workers</b> at the origin would migrate only if the correlation between origin and destination factors is strongly positive. Longitudinal data from the Ivory Cost suggest that, indeed, the <b>more</b> productive <b>workers</b> do migrate. Furthermore, people migrate generally towards cities. Therefore, rural areas lose their productive workers; urban areas may gain in productivity from the geographical shifts in population.

50|$|The {{rulers of}} Belgian Congo created a Bourse du travail at Katanga in 1910 {{as a state}} {{controlled}} hiring hall, {{in an attempt to}} lure labor to areas of planned industrial (mostly mining) concentration. Attempts by local officials to recast this cynically created employment agency into a <b>more</b> <b>worker</b> run operation suggest that the idea of a Bourse du travail never lost its syndicalist connotations.|$|R
25|$|A 2016 {{report by}} the U.S. {{government}} report identifies the current challenges facing the education system, including the high dropout rate among high school students. The country needs even <b>more</b> <b>workers</b> who are fluent in English and languages such as Portuguese, Mandarin and French. It would also benefit from more graduates in Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) programs, according to the report.|$|E
25|$|Classical {{models of}} {{unemployment}} occurs when wages {{are too high}} for employers {{to be willing to}} hire <b>more</b> <b>workers.</b> Wages may be too high because of minimum wage laws or union activity. Consistent with classical unemployment, frictional unemployment occurs when appropriate job vacancies exist for a worker, but the length of time needed to search for and find the job leads to a period of unemployment.|$|E
25|$|The day {{begins with}} Shukhov waking up sick. For waking late, he {{is forced to}} clean the guardhouse, but this is minor {{punishment}} compared with others mentioned in the book. When Shukhov is finally able to leave the guardhouse, {{he goes to the}} dispensary to report his illness. It is relatively late in the morning by this time, however, so the orderly is unable to exempt any <b>more</b> <b>workers</b> and Shukhov must work.|$|E
40|$|Although legal {{restrictions}} {{limiting the}} workers? liability {{are made to}} increase their welfare, we show that they {{may lead to a}} perverse effect when <b>more</b> productive <b>workers</b> cross subsidize less productive workers. A generalized agency model is analyzed and used to show that exonerating a wealthy agent from liability for damages caused during the execution of the contract decreases the <b>more</b> productive <b>workers?</b> expected utility in the pooling equilibrium of the combined model. ...|$|R

25|$|On 28 March, some 450 crane {{operators}} and stevedores {{went on strike}} inside the Kwai Tsing Container Terminal, for better pay and conditions. They demanded a $1.60 per hour raise. <b>More</b> <b>workers</b> joined the action, but they were forced outside the port after the local court granted HIT a temporary injunction on 1 April banning unionists and their supporters from entering {{any of the four}} Kwai Tsing container terminals.|$|E
25|$|In 1833 the childless Dyers had a {{boy named}} Samuel. About this same time some in the Chinese {{community}} requested a school. During this period Samuel was {{hard at work on}} a revision of the translation of Matthew's Gospel in Chinese. The amount of work that still was left to be done prompted him to write to England in the following year, appealing for <b>more</b> <b>workers</b> to be sent out. Robert Morrison died at Guangzhou in 1834.|$|E
50|$|The last wave {{of worker}} centers began in 2000 to the present. Many worker centers are {{expanding}} {{not only in}} the city, but into the suburbs, rural regions, and southern states where there is a large concentration of Mexican and Central immigrants working in the poultry, service, agriculture, and meat-packing sectors. Not only that, <b>more</b> <b>worker</b> centers are emerging among Korean, Filipino, South Asian and African immigrants, and they have a higher connection to faith-based organizations and unions.|$|R

25|$|In {{addition}} {{to the lack of}} employment for many of those arriving at the Durst Ranch, living conditions for the temporary field hands were particularly abysmal. Workers lived in tents in the hot summer sun on a barren hillside, paying Durst 75 cents per week for the privilege as a rental fee. <b>More</b> <b>workers</b> were on hand than could be accommodated in these tents, however, forcing some to make do in the elements under crude structures constructed from poles and burlap sacks.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1840s, {{after several years}} of failed crops and as food became scarce, much of the canton found itself deep in poverty. With <b>more</b> <b>workers</b> than {{available}} jobs, emigration to the United States of America was seen as a solution. The Glarus Emigration Society was established in 1844, which offered loans to help residents purchase land in the New World. Many of the resulting emigrants went to the state of Wisconsin, where they founded the town of New Glarus.|$|E
