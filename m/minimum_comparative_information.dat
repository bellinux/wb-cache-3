40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to analize the {{combined}} effects of the two agrarian reforms 1969 and 1980 on a peasant group in the Chicama valley - Peru. Until now Magdalena de Cao, a peasant group in Chicama valley had not been examined in light of the recent agrarian reforms and their effects on this peasant group. The data were collected mainly through informal interviews with <b>minimum</b> participant observation. <b>Comparative</b> <b>information</b> on lifestyles among the people representing all types of agrarian constituents were obtained as part of the data. Some questions, if not hypotheses, have been generated and raised. A census of 177 families or 870 individuals was obtained by this researcher alone. Magdalena de Cao, as a peasant group, provides an empirical case of independent peasants and their adaptive strategies to confront the challenge of social development. Their strife is not only relevant to Chicama valley, but also in the broader national picture. Department of AnthropologyThesis (M. A. ...|$|R

40|$|People {{often do}} not walk the talk {{when it comes to}} pro-environmental behaviour. From a Norm Focus theory {{perspective}} what may be happening is that people are experiencing conflicting norms, that is, although pro-environmental behaviour is approved of (i. e., positive injunctive norms), a majority of people are not engaging in pro-environmental behaviour (negative descriptive norms). People therefore perceive inconsistencies in norms and this undermines motivation to engage in pro-environmental actions. The current study aims to investigate whether providing <b>comparative</b> outgroup <b>information</b> (i. e., positive injunctive and descriptive norms) can help overcome the demotivating effect of this type of norm conflict. The logic is that status threat is induced when ingroup members perceive that the outgroup is acting more positively than the ingroup. As such, ingroup members will align their behaviour with the injunctive norm in order to improve group status. To investigate this idea 106 first year psychology students took part in 2 (Norm: Norms aligned, norm conflict) x 2 (Comparative outgroup information: Presented, not presented) experiment and their pro-environmental intentions and energy conservation behaviour were measured following the manipulations. Consistent with hypotheses, results showed that <b>comparative</b> <b>information</b> and norm conflict increased engagement in energy conservation behaviour. The same effect was not found on pro-environmental intentions, however, pro-environmental attitudes was found to moderate the effect of norm conflict and <b>comparative</b> <b>information</b> such that participants with less positive environmental attitudes had higher intentions when faced with norm conflict and <b>comparative</b> <b>information...</b>|$|R

Partly because of its complexity, the use of this information has been limited. The objective {{of this study was to}} examine how the amount of presented information influences the comprehension and use of <b>comparative</b> healthcare <b>information</b> when important consumer characteristics and skills are taken into account. Methods In this randomized controlled experiment, <b>comparative</b> <b>information</b> on total hip or knee surgery was used as a test case. An online survey was distributed among 800 members of the NIVEL Insurants Panel and 76 hip- or knee surgery patients. Participants were assigned to one of four subgroups, who were shown 3, 7, 11 or 15 quality aspects of three hospitals. We conducted Kruskall-Wallis tests, Chi-square tests and hierarchical multiple linear regression analyses to examine relationships between the amount of information and consumer characteristics and skills (literacy, numeracy, active choice behaviour) on one hand, and outcome measures related to effectively using information (comprehension, perceived usefulness of information, hospital choice, ease of making a choice) on the other hand. Results 414 people (47 %) participated. Regression analysis showed that the amount of information slightly influenced the comprehension and the perceived usefulness of <b>comparative</b> healthcare <b>information.</b> It did not affect consumers’ hospital choice and ease of making this choice. Consumer characteristics (especially age) and skills (especially literacy) were the most important factors affecting the comprehension of information and the ease of making a hospital choice. For the perceived usefulness of <b>comparative</b> <b>information,</b> active choice behaviour was the most influencing factor. Conclusion The effects of the amount of information were not unambiguous. It remains unclear what the ideal amount of quality information to be presented would be. Reducing the amount of information will probably not automatically result in more effective use of <b>comparative</b> healthcare <b>information</b> by consumers.

40|$|With {{respect to}} {{conveying}} useful <b>comparative</b> <b>information,</b> current biological classifications are seriously flawed because {{they fail to}} (i) standardize criteria for taxonomic ranking and (ii) equilibrate assignments of taxonomic rank across disparate kinds of organisms. In principle, these problems could be rectified by adopting a universal taxonomic yardstick based on absolute dates of the nodes in evolutionary trees. By using procedures of temporal banding described herein, a simple philosophy of biological classification is proposed that would retain a manageable number of categorical ranks yet apply them in standardized fashion to time-dated phylogenies. The phylogenetic knowledge required for a time-standardized nomenclature arguably may emerge {{in the foreseeable future}} from vast increases in multilocus DNA sequence information (coupled with continued attention to phylogeny estimation from traditional systematic data). By someday encapsulating time-dated phylogenies in a familiar yet modified hierarchical ranking scheme, a temporal-banding approach would improve the <b>comparative</b> <b>information</b> content of biological classifications...|$|R
40|$|The Choquet {{expected}} {{utility model}} deals with nonadditive probabilities (or capacities). Their {{dependence on the}} information the decision-maker has {{about the possibility of}} the events is taken into account. Two kinds of information are examined: interval information (for instance, the percentage of white balls in an urn is between 60 % and 100 %) and <b>comparative</b> <b>information</b> (for instance, the information that there are more white balls than black ones). Some implications are shown with regard to the core of the capacity and to two additive measures which can be derived from capacities: the Shapley value and the nucleolus. Interval information bounds prove to be satisfied by all probabilities in the core, but they are not necessarily satisfied by the nucleolus (when the core is empty) and the Shapley value. We must introduce the constrained nucleolus in order for these bounds to be satisfied, while the Shapley value {{does not seem to be}} adjustable. On the contrary, <b>comparative</b> <b>information</b> inequalities prove to be not necessarily satisfied by all probabilities in the core and we must introduce the constrained core in order for these inequalities be satisfied. However, both the nucleolus and the Shapley value satisfy the <b>comparative</b> <b>information</b> inequalities, and the Shapley value does it more strictly than the nucleolus.

40|$|Background: On {{more and}} more websites, {{consumers}} are provided with public reports about health care. This move toward provision of more <b>comparative</b> <b>information</b> has resulted in different information types being published that often contain contradictory information. Objective: The objective {{was to assess the}} current state of the art in the presentation of online <b>comparative</b> health care <b>information</b> and to compare how the integration of different information types is dealt with on websites. The content analysis was performed in order to provide website managers and Internet researchers with a resource of knowledge about presentation formats being applied internationally. Methods: A Web search was used to identify websites that contained <b>comparative</b> health care <b>information.</b> The websites were systematically examined to assess how three different types of information (provider characteristics and services, performance indicators, and health care user experience) were presented to consumers. Furthermore, a short survey was disseminated to the reviewed websites to assess how the presentation formats were selected. Results: We reviewed 42 websites from the following countries: Australia, Canada, Denmark, Germany, Ireland, the netherlands, Norway, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Sweden. We found the most common ways to integrate different information types were the two extreme options: no integration at all (on 36 % of the websites) and high levels of integration in single tables on 41 % of the websites). Nearly 70 % of the websites offered drill down paths to more detailed information. Diverse presentation approaches were used to display <b>comparative</b> health care <b>information</b> on the Internet. Numbers were used on the majority of websites (88 %) to display <b>comparative</b> <b>information.</b> Conclusions: Currently, approaches to the presentation of <b>comparative</b> health care <b>information</b> do not seem to be systematically selected. It seems important, however, that website managers become aware of the complexities inherent in <b>comparative</b> <b>information</b> when they release information on the Web. Important complexities to pay attention to are the use of numbers, the display of contradictory information, and the extent of variation among attributes and attribute levels. As for the integration of different information types, it remains unclear which presentation approaches are preferable. Our study provides a good starting point for Internet research to further address the question of how different types of information can be more effectively presented to consumers. (aut. ref. ...|$|R
