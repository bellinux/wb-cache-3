30|$|These two {{concepts}} {{seem to be}} {{two sides of the}} same coin. Personalised medicine (and personalised radiology) works at a physical and biological level; patient-centred medicine pays attention to the psychological, behavioural and relational aspects of <b>medical</b> (and <b>radiological)</b> work. Both are essential elements for good outcomes in <b>medical</b> (and <b>radiological)</b> practice.|$|R
40|$|The {{continuously}} {{increasing number}} of <b>medical</b> investigations using <b>radiological</b> methods imposes the strong necessity of informing patients about benefits and risks regarding radiation absorbed doses. Tracking the radiation doses absorbed by patients must be a future challenge of any medical system. The effective doses received by patients in many types of medical investigations must be calculated, transformed, recorded and cumulated. Doctors and patients must be very responsible in prescribing or demanding new <b>radiological</b> <b>medical</b> investigations. <b>Radiological</b> standards, legislation, guidelines, programmers and practice supervised by international commissions on radiology protection must include new specific measures for patients’ cumulated doses. A pilot Romanian project had tried to accomplish some of these tasks...|$|R

The program seeks to develop prophylactic and therapeutic drugs, such as Ex-Rad, that prevent and treat radiation injuries and to develop rapid high-precision analytical methods that assess radiation exposure doses from clinical samples and thus aid in the triage and medical management of radiological casualties. New drug candidates and biological dose assessment technologies are developed up to and through preclinical testing and evaluation.|$|E

30|$|As {{laid down}} in the revised European BSS Directive (21), Member States shall ensure that {{clinical}} audits are carried out in accordance with national procedures. Clinical audit {{is a relatively new}} concept in radiation protection. It seeks to improve the quality and outcome of patient care through structured review of <b>medical</b> <b>radiological</b> practices, procedures and results, whereby these are examined against agreed standards for good <b>medical</b> <b>radiological</b> procedures, with modification of practices, where appropriate, and the application of new standards if necessary.|$|E
30|$|In our population, peritoneal metastases {{prevalence}} resulted even 0.7  % (22 / 3096), {{and thus}} just little lower than brain metastasis prevalence. Considering the late onset of peritoneal recurrence in our population, their prevalence {{may be the}} result of an increased survival of breast cancer women affected by other sites metastasis thanks to the progressive improvement of <b>medical</b> and <b>radiological</b> therapies, who consequently gain enough time to develop peritoneal metastases. And actually, the most cases of peritoneal involvement by breast cancer (81.8  %) were associated with metastases in other sites.|$|R

30|$|Clinical audit in the {{document}} {{is defined as a}} ‘systematic examination or review of <b>medical</b> <b>radiological</b> procedures. It seeks to improve the quality and outcome of patient care through structured review whereby radiological practices, procedures and results are examined against agreed standards for good <b>medical</b> <b>radiological</b> procedures. Modifications of practices are implemented where indicated and new standards applied if necessary’. It emphasises that clinical audit is not research, quality system audit, accreditation or a regulatory activity, but a multi-professional activity that is both scheduled and systematic, carried out by auditors with knowledge of the procedures, combining internal assessment of performance with external review and identifying areas for future improvement. All those involved in audit should respect the confidentiality of patient data, staff discussions, audit reports and other performance data. Much emphasis is placed on the difference between clinical audit and other quality systems and regulatory inspections, there being clear differences in the purpose, focus, scope, methods and consequences {{of the results of the}} observations, their impact and use. Regulatory bodies should neither carry out clinical audits directly not exclusively set up the criteria for the audits.|$|E
