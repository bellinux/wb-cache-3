50|$|<b>Mosapramine</b> (Cremin) is an {{atypical}} antipsychotic used in Japan. It is {{a potent}} dopamine antagonist with high affinity to the D2, D3, and D4 receptors, and with moderate affinity for the 5-HT2 receptors.|$|E
50|$|Has {{a higher}} {{incidence}} of extrapyramidal side effects than the other atypical antipsychotics, but still less than that seen with typical antipsychotics. A trend was observed in a clinical trial comparing <b>mosapramine</b> with perospirone that favoured perospirone for producing less prominent extrapyramidal side effects than <b>mosapramine</b> although statistical significant was not reached. It may produce less QT interval prolongation than zotepine, as in one patient who had previously been on zotepine switching to perospirone corrected their prolonged QT interval. It also tended to produce less severe extrapyramidal side effects than haloperidol in a clinical trial comparing the two (although statistical significance was not reached).|$|E
50|$|In a {{clinical}} trial that compared it to haloperidol {{in the treatment of}} schizophrenia it was found to produce significantly superior overall symptom control. In another clinical trial perospirone was compared with <b>mosapramine</b> and produced a similar reduction in total PANSS score, except with respect to the blunted affect part of the PANSS negative score, in which perospirone produced a significantly greater improvement. In an open-label clinical trial comparing aripiprazole with perospirone {{there was no significant difference}} between the two treatments discovered in terms of both efficacy and tolerability. In 2009 {{a clinical}} trial found that perospirone produced a similar reduction of PANSS score than risperidone and the extrapyramidal side effects was similar in both frequency and severity between groups.|$|E

Methods: We searched data that had been published in PubMed, the Cochrane Library databases, PsycINFO, CiNii, and the Japan Medical Abstracts Society up to August 29, 2014. Randomized controlled trials that compared iminodibenzyl antipsychotics with other antipsychotics in patients with schizophrenia were included. Odds ratios and standardized mean differences were evaluated. Results: We included four randomized controlled trials on carpipramine (number of patients [n]= 290), six on clocapramine (n= 1, 048), and five on <b>mosapramine</b> (n= 986) in the meta-analysis. There {{were no significant differences}} in the response rates or in the discontinuation rates either between carpipramine and the other pooled antipsychotics or between clocapramine and the other pooled antipsychotics. On the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, mosapramine’s positive subscale scores were superior to those of the other pooled antipsychotics (standard mean of difference =− 0. 22); however, on that same scale, there {{were no significant differences in}} total scores, negative scores, general subscale scores, response rates, or the discontinuation rates between <b>mosapramine</b> and the other pooled antipsychotics. Furthermore, the incidences of extrapyramidal symptoms and of hyperprolactinemia were significantly greater with <b>mosapramine</b> than with the other pooled antipsychotics. Conclusion: The pharmacological profiles of carpipramine and clocapramine, which are classified as SGAs, were similar to those of first-generation antipsychotics because there were no significant differences in efficacy and safety outcomes. However, <b>mosapramine</b> was associated with a greater risk of extrapyramidal symptoms and hyperprolactinemia than the other SGAs were, although it may be beneficial for the improvement of positive symptoms.

Methods: We performed a literature search of data published in PubMed®, the Cochrane Library database, the Japan Medical Abstracts Society, and PsycINFO® up to January 5, 2014. The odds ratio (OR), number-needed-to-harm (NNH), and standardized mean difference (SMD) {{based on a}} random effects model were calculated. Results: We identified five relevant studies (seven comparisons, n= 684; one comparison each for haloperidol [n= 243], <b>mosapramine</b> [n= 238], olanzapine [n= 39], quetiapine [n= 42], perospirone [n= 100], and two comparisons for risperidone [n= 66]). There {{were no significant differences}} in the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total, negative, and general scores (SMD= 0. 10, SMD=- 0. 09, SMD= 0. 10, respectively); discontinuation rate associated with all causes (OR= 1. 35); or side effects (OR= 1. 03) between aripiprazole and the pooled antipsychotics. Aripiprazole was inferior to the pooled antipsychotics in PANSS positive subscale scores (SMD= 0. 17) and discontinuation because of inefficacy (OR= 2. 21, NNH= 11). However, aripiprazole had fewer side effects compared with the pooled antipsychotics (OR= 0. 21, NNH= 20 for one or more side effects), including fatigue (OR= 0. 22, NNH= 8), hyperprolactinemia (OR= 0. 00, NNH= 1), extrapyramidal symptoms (OR= 0. 46, NNH= 6), and weight gain (OR= 0. 36, NNH= 7). Moreover, aripiprazole was associated with lower total cholesterol (SMD=- 0. 20) and triglyceride (SMD=- 0. 17) levels and body weight (SMD=- 0. 20) compared with the pooled antipsychotics. Conclusion: Although the discontinuation rate associated with inefficacy was higher with aripiprazole than with the pooled antipsychotics, aripiprazole was associated with a lower risk of hyperprolactinemia and metabolic and extrapyramidal symptoms compared with the pooled antipsychotics.

This study aimed {{to examine whether}} previous findings could be replicated in a genetically distinct and homogenous group (ie, Japanese patients with schizophrenia) and whether previous findings could be extended to {{a broader range of}} antipsychotics with previously unclear relative efficacy and tolerability. Methods: Bayesian network meta-analysis was performed in which randomized trials comparing any of the following interventions were included: second-generation antipsychotics, haloperidol, or placebo. The primary outcomes for efficacy and acceptability were the response rate and all-cause discontinuation. The secondary outcomes included the improvement of Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale scores, discontinuation because of adverse events, and individual adverse events. Results: Eighteen relevant studies were identified (total n= 3, 446; aripiprazole = 267, blonanserin = 285, clozapine = 47, clocapramine = 295, haloperidol = 857, <b>mosapramine</b> = 493, olanzapine = 179, paliperidone = 136, perospirone = 146, placebo = 138, quetiapine = 212, and risperidone = 338; mean study duration = 8. 33 ± 1. 41 weeks). In primary outcomes, olanzapine and paliperidone showed efficacy than placebo, and olanzapine and paliperidone showed superior acceptability compared with placebo. There were differences in the incidences of individual adverse events (the best antipsychotic: extrapyramidal symptoms = olanzapine, hyperprolactinemia-related symptoms = quetiapine, sedation = paliperidone, and weight change = blonanserin) among antipsychotics. Conclusion: Although the current analysis exclusively included Japanese patients with schizophrenia, no remarkable differences were observed in efficacy and safety compared with previous meta-analyses. Diverse hierarchies in safety outcomes also support the implication that individual risk expectations for adverse events can guide clinical decisions. However, the sample size was relatively limited. Additional efficacy and safety data are required to fully obtain a conclusive understanding. Keywords: antipsychotics, Japanese schizophrenia, network meta-analysis, efficacy, safet...|$|E
