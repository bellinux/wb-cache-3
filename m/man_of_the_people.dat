5|$|The {{standard}} Achebean ending {{results in}} the destruction of an individual and, by synecdoche, the downfall of the community. Odili's descent into the luxury of corruption and hedonism in A <b>Man</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>People,</b> for example, is symbolic of the post-colonial crisis in Nigeria and elsewhere. Even with the emphasis on colonialism, however, Achebe's tragic endings embody the traditional confluence of fate, individual and society, as represented by Sophocles and Shakespeare.|$|E
5|$|In June 1935 Calleia was {{announced}} to star as Joaquin Murrieta in I Am Joaquin (later titled Robin Hood of El Dorado), a film {{for which he}} had written the screenplay. MGM replaced him with Warner Baxter, ostensibly because Calleia was too old, although Baxter was six years older. Calleia did receive a notable starring role in <b>Man</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>People</b> (1937), a political drama about a young lawyer fighting corporate racketeers.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} six-string guitar {{was created}} by the Neapolitan Gaetano Vinaccia in 1779; the instrument is now referred to as the romantic guitar. The Vinaccia family also developed the mandolin. Influenced by the Spanish, Neapolitans became pioneers of classical guitar music, with Ferdinando Carulli and Mauro Giuliani being prominent exponents. Giuliani, who was actually from Apulia but lived and worked in Naples, is widely considered {{to be one of the}} greatest guitar players and composers of the 19th century, along with his Catalan contemporary Fernando Sor. Another Neapolitan musician of note was opera singer Enrico Caruso, one of the most prominent opera tenors of all time: he was considered a <b>man</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> in Naples, hailing from a working-class background.|$|E

25|$|The 1912 Oregon ballot for United State Senate was cluttered. In {{addition}} to the Democrat Harry Lane and Bob Selling, candidate of the conservative wing of the Republican Party, progressive Republicans had other electoral alternatives, including candidates of the Progressive Party and the Popular Government Party. Meanwhile, Floyd Ramp stood for the Socialists and yet another candidate was nominee of the Prohibition Party. Astoundingly, each of these six candidates took more than 5% of the vote — a fact which enabled the Democrat Lane to win election with a plurality {{of the vote in}} solidly Republican Oregon. Intent on proving himself a <b>man</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>people,</b> Harry Lane set what might be a record for campaign frugality in his victorious effort, with his entire race run for the princely sum of $75 plus travel expenses.|$|E
25|$|As a {{solution}} to the panic, he supported an Independent Treasury system, which was designed to hold the money balances of the government in the form of gold or silver and would be restricted from printing paper money so as to prevent further inflation. However, a coalition of conservative Democrats and Whigs opposed the bill, and it was not passed until 1840. During the delay, no effective remedy had been implemented for the depression. Van Buren grew deeply unpopular. A unified Whig Party nominated popular war hero William Henry Harrison and former Jacksonian John Tyler in the 1840 presidential election. The Whigs' campaign style in many ways mimicked that of the Democrats during Jackson's campaigns. They depicted Van Buren as an aristocrat who did not care for the concerns of ordinary Americans, while glorifying Harrison's military record and portraying him as a <b>man</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>people.</b> Jackson campaigned heavily for Van Buren in Tennessee. He favored the nomination of James K. Polk of Tennessee for vice president at the 1840 Democratic National Convention over unpopular incumbent Richard Mentor Johnson. However, no nominee was chosen, and the party chose to leave the decision up to individual state electors.|$|E
500|$|A <b>Man</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>People</b> was {{published}} in 1966. A bleak satire set in an unnamed African state which has just attained independence, the novel follows a teacher named Odili Samalu {{from the village of}} Anata who opposes a corrupt Minister of Culture named Nanga for his Parliament seat. Upon reading an advance copy of the novel, Achebe's friend John Pepper Clark declared: [...] "Chinua, I know you are a prophet. Everything in this book has happened except a military coup!" ...|$|E

500|$|Another {{hallmark}} of Achebe's style {{is the use}} of proverbs, which often illustrate the values of the rural Igbo tradition. He sprinkles them throughout the narratives, repeating points made in conversation. Critic Anjali Gera notes that the use of proverbs in Arrow of God [...] "serves to create through an echo effect the judgement of a community upon an individual violation." [...] The use of such repetition in Achebe's urban novels, No Longer at Ease and A <b>Man</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>People,</b> is less pronounced.|$|E
500|$|The {{elections}} that followed {{were marked by}} violence and charges of fraud. Asked whether he thought Nigerian politics had changed since A <b>Man</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>People,</b> Achebe replied: [...] "I think, if anything, the Nigerian politician has deteriorated." [...] After the elections, he engaged in a heated argument– which almost became a fistfight– with Bakin Zuwo, the newly elected governor of Kano State. He left the PRP and afterwards kept his distance from political parties, expressing his sadness at the dishonesty and weakness of the people involved.|$|E
500|$|During the war, {{relations}} between writers in Nigeria and Biafra were strained. Achebe and John Pepper Clark had a tense confrontation in London over their respective support for opposing {{sides of the}} conflict. Achebe demanded that the publisher withdraw the dedication of A <b>Man</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>People</b> he had given to Clark. Years later, their friendship healed and the dedication was restored. Meanwhile, their contemporary Wole Soyinka was imprisoned for meeting with Biafran officials, and {{spent two years in}} jail. Speaking in 1968, Achebe said: [...] "I find the Nigerian situation untenable. If I had been a Nigerian, I think I {{would have been in the}} same situation as Wole Soyinka is– in prison." ...|$|E

500|$|During the Presidential {{campaign}} of 1952, Pat Nixon's attitude toward politics changed {{when her husband}} was accused of accepting illegal campaign contributions. Pat encouraged him to fight the charges, and he did so by delivering the famed [...] "Checkers speech", so-called for the family's dog, a Cocker Spaniel given to them by a political supporter. This was Pat's first national television appearance, and she, her daughters, and the dog were featured prominently. Defending himself as a <b>man</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>people,</b> Nixon stressed his wife's abilities as a stenographer, then said, [...] "I should say this, that Pat doesn't have a mink coat.

500|$|George III {{was dubbed}} [...] "Farmer George" [...] by satirists, {{at first to}} mock his {{interest}} in mundane matters rather than politics, but later to contrast his homely thrift with his son's grandiosity and to portray him as a <b>man</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>people.</b> Under George III, the British Agricultural Revolution reached its peak and great advances were made in fields such as science and industry. There was unprecedented growth in the rural population, which in turn provided much of the workforce for the concurrent Industrial Revolution. George's collection of mathematical and scientific instruments is now housed in the Science Museum, London. He had the King's Observatory built in Richmond-upon-Thames for his own observations of the 1769 transit of Venus. When William Herschel discovered Uranus in 1781, he at first named it Georgium Sidus (George's Star) after the King, who later funded the construction and maintenance of Herschel's 1785 40-foot telescope, which was the biggest ever built at the time.|$|E
500|$|Raised by {{his parents}} in the Igbo town of Ogidi in South-Eastern Nigeria, Achebe excelled at school and won a {{scholarship}} to study medicine, but changed his studies to English literature at University College (now the University of Ibadan). He became fascinated with world religions and traditional African cultures, and began writing stories as a university student. After graduation, {{he worked for the}} Nigerian Broadcasting Service (NBS) and soon moved to the metropolis of Lagos. He gained worldwide attention for his novel, Things Fall Apart in the late 1950s; his later novels include No Longer at Ease (1960), Arrow of God (1964), A <b>Man</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>People</b> (1966), and Anthills of the Savannah (1987). Achebe wrote his novels in English and defended the use of English, a [...] "language of colonisers", in African literature. In 1975, his lecture [...] featured a famous criticism of Joseph Conrad as [...] "a thoroughgoing racist"; it was later published in The Massachusetts Review amid some controversy.|$|E

500|$|Shafer saw Harrison's {{log cabin}} {{campaign}} as [...] "the first image advertising {{campaign for a}} presidential candidate, establishing forever a basic tactic of political campaigns. It is called lying... The rollicking run of Tippecanoe and Tyler Too changed presidential campaigns forever". K. R. Constantine Gutzman, who penned the American National Biography piece on Harrison, concurred: [...] "The Whig campaign of 1840, in which Benjamin Harrison's son was portrayed as the occupant of a log cabin and a <b>man</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>people,</b> is remembered derisively by historians (as it was derided by Democrats at the time) as the 'Log Cabin and Hard Cider' campaign. 'Tippecanoe and Tyler, Too' (the slogan that converted a controversial battle into a rousing victory in American popular memory) {{is supposed to have}} swayed a drunken electorate. In fact, as Henry Clay lamented, it was a Whig election cycle, and virtually anyone nominated as a Whig would probably have defeated Van Buren." ...|$|E
500|$|Briggs was {{nominated}} {{to run for}} the governorship on the Whig ticket against the incumbent Democrat Marcus Morton in 1843. [...] Former Governor John Davis had been nominated first, but refused the nomination, possibly because Daniel Webster promised him party support for a future vice presidential bid. [...] Briggs was apparently recommended as a compromise candidate acceptable to different factions within the party (one controlled by Webster, the other by Abbott Lawrence). [...] He was also probably chosen to appeal more directly to the state's rural voters, a constituency that normally supported Morton. [...] The abolitionist Liberty Party also fielded a candidate, with the result that none of the candidates won the needed majority. [...] The legislature decided the election in those cases; with a Whig majority there, Briggs' election was assured. [...] Briggs was reelected annually until 1850 against a succession of Democratic opponents. [...] He won popular majorities until the 1849 election, even though third parties (including the Liberty Party and its successor, the Free Soil Party) were often involved. [...] Although Whigs had a reputation for aristocratic bearing, Briggs was much more a <b>man</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> than the preceding Whig governors, John Davis and Edward Everett.|$|E
500|$|In April, the Whigs {{used the}} House of Representatives {{for an attack}} on President Van Buren. Charles Ogle of Pennsylvania, a law student and {{political}} disciple of Thaddeus Stevens, utilized a debate on White House renovations to spend three days accusing Van Buren of living in luxury at considerable public expense, asking, [...] "If he is vain enough to spend his money in the purchase of rubies for his neck, diamond rings for his fingers, Brussels lace for his breast, filet gloves for his hands, and fabrique de broderies de bougram à Nancy handkerchiefs for his pocket—if he chooses to lay out hundreds of dollars in supplying his toilet with 'Double Extract of Queen Victoria', Eau de Cologne, Corinthian Oil of Cream ... if, I say, Mr. Van Buren sees fit to spend his cash in buying these and other perfumes and cosmetics for his toilet, it can constitute no valid reason for charging the farmers, laborers and mechanics of this country with bills for HEMMING HIS DISH RAGS, FOR HIS LARDING NEEDLES, LIQUOR STANDS, AND FOREIGN CUT WINE COOLERS". Democrats called Ogle's address the [...] "Omnibus of Lies"; Whigs called it the [...] "Gold Spoons speech" [...] and reprinted it in large numbers, attempting to paint Van Buren, who was in fact of far more humble birth than Harrison, as an aristocratic dandy being challenged by a <b>man</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>people.</b>|$|E

500|$|McKinley {{was elected}} {{governor}} in November 1891, and the Republicans took {{a two-thirds majority}} in the legislature. [...] During the campaign, supporters of both Foraker and Sherman had sought pledges from candidates, and {{in the aftermath of}} the legislative elections, both men expressed confidence. Sherman was handicapped by his age (68), unpopularity, and a cold personality; according to Horner, [...] "Foraker was simply more of a <b>man</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> than Sherman could ever hope to be." [...] Sherman's aide, Jacob C. Donaldson, later wrote, [...] "the situation was bad, almost desperate". [...] Hanna had made significant campaign contributions to legislative candidates, and was outraged when legislators believed to favor Sherman instead announced that they would vote for Foraker; according to his biographer, Herbert Croly, [...] "The situation looked desperate; but it was saved, so Mr. Sherman himself stated to his friends, by Mr. Hanna's energy, enthusiasm and ability to bend other men to his will. Three of the Cleveland representatives, who had gone into hiding, were unearthed and forced into line." [...] Donaldson noted, [...] "Several of them were ruined by their perfidy." [...] Foraker was defeated narrowly in the Republican caucus, first on a vote to hold a secret ballot (which would have benefited him), and then on the endorsement vote, which supported Sherman, who was subsequently elected by the legislature. [...] According to Horner, [...] "It is difficult to know which mattered more to Hanna—making sure his old friend Sherman kept his job or making sure that Foraker did not get it." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite {{assuming}} the external form of traditional literature, Ion Creangă's interests and creative interventions, Călinescu noted, separated {{him from his}} roots: [...] "peasants do not have [...] entirely cultured gifts.... Too much 'atmosphere', too much dialogic 'humor', too much polychromy {{at the expense of}} linear epic movements. The peasant wants the bare epic and desires the unreal." [...] The commentator passed a similar judgment on the author's use of ancient sayings, concluding that, instead of crystallizing and validating local folklore, the accounts appeal to cultured tastes, having as the generation of comedy and volubility as their main purpose. According to Vianu's assessment Creangă was [...] "a supreme artist" [...] whose use of [...] "typical sayings" [...] attests [...] "a <b>man</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>people,</b> but not an anonymous and impersonal sample." [...] These verdicts, directly contradicting Junimist theories, were mirrored by several other 20th century exegetes belonging to distinct schools of thought: Pompiliu Constantinescu, Benjamin Fondane and Ion Negoițescu. Writing {{during the second half of}} the century, critic Nicolae Manolescu passed a similar judgment, believing that Creangă was motivated by a [...] "strictly intellectual sensuousness" [...] and the notion that [...] "pleasure arises from gratuitousness", while Manolescu's colleague Mircea Braga referred to [...] "the great secret of the man who has managed to transfer unaltered the code of popular creativity into the immanence of the cultured one." [...] In Braga's assessment, this synthesis managed [...] "the impossible", but the difficulty of repeating it with each story also resulted in mediocre writings: [...] "from among his few texts, even fewer are located on the relatively highest level of the relative aesthetic hierarchy".|$|E
