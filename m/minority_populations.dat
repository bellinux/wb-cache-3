5|$|Chinese, Indian and Comorian {{minorities}} {{are present in}} Madagascar, {{as well as a}} small European (primarily French) populace. Emigration in the late 20th century has reduced these <b>minority</b> <b>populations,</b> occasionally in abrupt waves, such as the exodus of Comorans in 1976, following anti-Comoran riots in Mahajanga. By comparison, there has been no significant emigration of Malagasy peoples. The number of Europeans has declined since independence, reduced from 68,430 in 1958 to 17,000 three decades later. There were an estimated 25,000Comorans, 18,000Indians, and 9,000Chinese living in Madagascar in the mid-1980s.|$|E

30|$|The “Hu Line” and its {{demographic}} implications {{have attracted}} world-wide attention since {{the line was}} developed 80  years. Using GIS, this paper conducts a statistical analysis and systematic investigation on the stability and spatial of China’s <b>minority</b> <b>population</b> growth {{on both sides of}} “Hu Line” by constructing the spatial database of China’s census data from 1953 to 2010 and initiating a new method for identifying the spatial patterns of population growth. Major findings are as follows: (1) Spatial distribution of the <b>minority</b> <b>population</b> in China is not balanced, showing a significant spatial clustering; (2) The <b>minority</b> <b>population</b> is widely distributed across China, spreading to East China and all over the country; (3) The distribution pattern of China’s <b>minority</b> <b>population</b> is characterized by extraordinary stability, with the ratio of south-east half to north-west half standing roughly at 75 : 25 from 1953 to 2010. We can thus say that the “Hu Line” is also a mutant line of China’s <b>minority</b> <b>population.</b>|$|R
5|$|Feminism was {{challenged}} by various minority groups for not entirely addressing {{the needs of}} <b>minority</b> <b>populations.</b> It was suggested that 'mainstream' feminism was upper caste and Hindu in its orientation and did not address the concerns of minority women. This {{led to the formation of}} the Awaaz-e-Niswaan (The Voice of Women) in 1987 in Mumbai in largely Muslim part of the city. The Muslim community has personal laws that often were considered harmful to the rights of Muslim women. The Muslim personal law allows Polygamy but not Polyandry.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{geographical}} name changes {{occurred in the}} eastern provinces {{of the country and}} on the coast of the eastern Black Sea, where <b>minority</b> <b>populations</b> tend to live.

The official statistics of The Special Commission for Name Change (Ad Degistirme Ihtisas Komisyonu) claim that the total number of villages, towns, cities, and settlements renamed is 12,211.

30|$|In {{terms of}} {{population}} changes, during 1953 – 2010, {{the proportion of}} major <b>minority</b> <b>population</b> groups continued to increase moderately in the southeast and fall slightly in the northwest. Different from the overall trend of <b>minority</b> <b>population,</b> the major <b>minority</b> <b>population</b> groups, except the Hui ethic group, maintained a modest growth in their traditional territories. There was a light increase in the proportions of Uyghur and Tibetan populations in the northwest and the Mongolian and Zhuang population in the southeast. The proportion of the Hui population changed significantly on both sides due to strong mobility. It climbed from 48.44 to 57.02 % in the southeast during 1953 – 2010, making a total increase of 8.58 percentage points. It is evident that the imbalance and ultra-stability of <b>minority</b> <b>population</b> distribution are also profoundly manifested in the major ethnic minorities.|$|R
