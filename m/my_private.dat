500|$|SF writer Alfred Bester, {{an editor}} of Holiday Magazine and a {{sophisticated}} Manhattanite, recounted at some length his [...] "one demented meeting" [...] with Campbell, a man he imagined from afar to be [...] "a combination of Bertrand Russell and Ernest Rutherford." [...] The first thing Campbell said to him was that Freud was dead, destroyed by the new discovery of Dianetics, which, he predicted, would win L. Ron Hubbard the Nobel Peace Prize. Campbell ordered the bemused Bester to [...] "think back. Clear yourself. Remember! You can remember when your mother tried to abort you with a button hook. You've never stopped hating her for it." [...] Bester commented: [...] "It reinforced <b>my</b> <b>private</b> opinion {{that a majority of}} the science-fiction crowd, despite their brilliance, were missing their marbles." ...|$|E
500|$|McCain {{had been}} uncomfortable and largely silent during the 1998 Lewinsky scandal, partly because his own {{personal}} life had not been without blemishes, and partly because his upcoming presidential nomination run restricted his political options. [...] During the early 1999 Impeachment of Bill Clinton, McCain voted to convict the president on both the perjury {{and obstruction of justice}} counts. [...] In his remarks on the Senate floor, McCain said: [...] "Although I may admit to failures in <b>my</b> <b>private</b> life, I have [...] kept faith with every oath I have ever sworn to this country. I have known some men who kept that faith at the cost of their lives. I cannot—not in deference to public opinion, or for political considerations, or for the sake of comity and friendship—I cannot agree to expect less from the President." ...|$|E

His lawyer stated that all of the articles' [...] "allegations and factual assertions are false." [...] Grant said, in a written statement, that he took the action because: [...] "I was tired of the Daily Mail and Mail on Sunday papers publishing almost entirely fictional articles about <b>my</b> <b>private</b> life for their own financial gain." [...] He went on to take the opportunity to stress, [...] "I'm also hoping that this statement in court might remind people that the so-called 'close friends' or 'close sources' on which these stories claim to be based almost never exist." ...|$|E

500|$|Hańska {{lived with}} Balzac's mother {{for a time}} after his death, in the house he had {{spent so much time}} and expense furnishing. The elder Mme. Balzac moved in with a friend after several months, and Hańska {{approached}} the remains of her late husband's writing. Several works had been left incomplete, and publishers inquired about releasing a final edition of his grand collection La Comédie humaine. Hańska sponsored new editions of his works and was involved in editing some of them, even adding occasional content. Balzac's debt, meanwhile, still exceeded 200,000 francs, which Hańska paid while also providing for his mother's living expenses. One of her letters at the time gives voice to her frustrations: [...] "In nursing my husband's incurable malady I ruined my health, just as I have ruined <b>my</b> <b>private</b> fortune in accepting the inheritance of debts and embarrassments which he left me." [...] Anna and Jerzy moved into a nearby house in Paris.|$|E
500|$|In October 1925 Rougier {{was sent}} {{to work in the}} Caucasus Mountains, partly because he had learned Russian as a child. Heyer {{remained}} at home and continued to write. In 1926, she released These Old Shades, in which the Duke of Avon courts his own ward. Unlike her first novel, These Old Shades focused more on personal relationships than on adventure. The book appeared {{in the midst of the}} 1926 United Kingdom general strike; as a result, the novel received no newspaper coverage, reviews, or advertising. Nevertheless, the book sold 190,000copies. Because the lack of publicity had not harmed the novel's sales, Heyer refused for the rest of her life to promote her books, even though her publishers often asked her to give interviews. She once wrote to a friend that [...] "as for being photographed at Work or in my Old World Garden, that is the type of publicity which I find nauseating and quite unnecessary. <b>My</b> <b>private</b> life concerns no one but myself and my family." ...|$|E
500|$|In October and November 1997, Channel 4 {{presented}} the novel sequence in four television films, with a screenplay by Hugh Whitemore, produced by Peter Amsorge. Widmerpool was played by Simon Russell Beale; in a generally critical {{review of the}} first film of the series, Thomas Sutcliffe in The Independent refers to Beale's performance as particularly good, bearing in mind the [...] "thin ledges of characterisation" [...] the script provides to the cast. The journalist David Aaronovitch thought Beale's interpretation of the character definitive: [...] "...the Widmerpool who insinuated his podgy bulk into <b>my</b> <b>private</b> space was... Simon Russell Beale's Widmerpool, who has come to stay". Reviewing the reissue of the films in DVD in 2012, Stuart Jeffries in The Guardian describes Widmerpool as [...] "one of fiction's most intriguing monsters" [...] and likens Beale's portrayal to that of [...] "a kind of grown-up Billy Bunter with the charm sucked out". Christopher Hitchens, writing in the New York Review of Books, criticised the production (though not Beale's performance), for depicting Widmerpool as [...] "a hapless rather than a hateful figure".|$|E

500|$|In his written {{confession}} {{released by}} Peruvian police, Van der Sloot recounted that he briefly left {{the hotel to}} get some coffee and bread, and returned to find Flores using his laptop computer without his permission. A police source stated {{that she may have}} found information linking him to the disappearance of Holloway. An altercation allegedly began, and she attempted to escape. According to the aforementioned written confession released by Peruvian authorities, Van der Sloot stated, [...] "I did not want to do it. The girl intruded into <b>my</b> <b>private</b> life [...] [...] [...] she didn't have any right. I went to her and I hit her. She was scared, we argued and she tried to escape. I grabbed her by the neck and hit her." [...] Van der Sloot reportedly stated that he was stoned on marijuana at the time. A detective linked to the case said that Van der Sloot considered getting rid of the body in a suitcase, but decided against it because he would have been stopped at the front desk. He then reportedly drank espresso and took amphetamines to counter fatigue before fleeing.|$|E
500|$|Due to the Palm Beach media {{attention}} and the Thomas hearings, Kennedy's public image suffered. A Gallup Poll gave Kennedy {{a very low}} 22percent national approval rating. A Boston Herald/WCVB-TV poll found that 62 percent of Massachusetts citizens thought Kennedy should not run for re-election, by a 2-to-1 margin thought Kennedy had misled authorities in the Palm Beach investigation, and had Kennedy losing a hypothetical Senate race to Governor William Weld by 25points. Meanwhile, at a June 17, 1991, dinner party, Kennedy saw Victoria Anne Reggie, a Washington lawyer at Keck, Mahin & Cate, a divorced mother of two, and {{the daughter of an}} old Kennedy family ally, Louisiana judge Edmund Reggie. They began dating and by September were in a serious relationship. In a late October speech at the John F. Kennedy School of Government, Kennedy sought to begin a political recovery, saying: [...] "I am painfully aware that the criticism directed at me in recent months involves far more than disagreements with my positions ... involves the disappointment of friends and many others who rely on me to fight the good fight. To them I say, I recognize my own shortcomings– the faults in the conduct of <b>my</b> <b>private</b> life. I realize that I alone am responsible for them, and I am the one who must confront them." [...] In December 1991, the William Kennedy Smith rape trial was held; it was nationally televised and the most watched until the O. J. Simpson murder case three years later. Kennedy's testimony at the trial seemed relaxed, confident, and forthcoming, and helped convince the public that his involvement had been peripheral and unintended. Smith was acquitted.|$|E
500|$|American pop {{rock band}} Train has {{released}} ten studio albums, two live albums, one video album, four extended plays, 30 singles, four promotional singles, and 26 music videos.
