5000|$|One of {{the most}} {{interesting}} problems is that of star formation. It is known that stars form out of the Interstellar Medium and that this mostly occurs in Giant Molecular Clouds such as the Rosette Nebula for example. It has been {{known for a long time}} that an interstellar cloud can collapse due to its self-gravity if it is large enough, but in the ordinary interstellar medium, this can only happen if the cloud has a mass of several thousand solar masses - much larger than that of any star. There must therefore be some process that fragments the cloud into smaller high density clouds whose masses are in the same range as that of stars. Self-gravity cannot do this, but it turns out that there are processes that do this if the magnetic pressure is much larger than the thermal pressure, as it is in Giant Molecular Clouds. These processes rely on the interaction of magnetohydrodynamic waves with a thermal instability. A <b>magnetohydrodynamic</b> <b>wave</b> in a medium in which the magnetic pressure is much larger than the thermal pressure can produce dense regions, but they cannot by themselves make the density high enough for self-gravity to act. However, the gas in star forming regions is heated by cosmic rays and is cooled by radiative processes. The net result is that gas in a thermal equilibrium state in which heating balances cooling can exist in three different phases at the same pressure: a warm phase with a low density, an unstable phase with intermediate density and a cold phase at low temperature. An increase in pressure, due to a supernova or a spiral density wave can flip the gas from the warm phase into the unstable phase and a <b>Magnetohydrodynamic</b> <b>wave</b> can then produce dense fragments in the cold phase whose self-gravity is strong enough for them to collapse to form stars [...]|$|E

40|$|The {{discovery}} of <b>magnetohydrodynamic</b> <b>waves</b> {{was a major}} breakthrough in plasma physics and its applications to space physics and fusion research. The waves were discovered by Hannes Alfve´n and are therefore also called Alfve´n Waves. The discovery was typical of Alfve´n’s outstanding ability to derive results of great generality from analysis of specific problems—in this case, the sunspots and the sunspot cycle. It was also typical of his electrodynamic approach to astrophysical problems. It {{took a long time}} before his discovery was generally accepted, partly because of the contemporary lack of means to verify the waves experimentally. The experimental verification of the <b>magnetohydrodynamic</b> <b>waves</b> came gradually many years later, beginning with experiments in liquid metals.

40|$|Aims. Recent ground- and space-based {{observations}} {{reveal the}} presence of small-scale motions between convection cells in the solar photosphere. In these regions small-scale magnetic flux tubes are generated due to the interaction of granulation motion and background magnetic field. This paper aims to {{study the effects of}} these motions, in regions of enhanced magnetic field, on <b>magnetohydrodynamic</b> <b>wave</b> excitation, propagation and energy flux from the solar photosphere up towards the solar corona. Methods. Numerical experiments of <b>magnetohydrodynamic</b> <b>wave</b> propagation in a realistic gravitationally stratified solar atmosphere from five different modelled photospheric drivers are performed. Horizontal and vertical drivers to mimic granular buffeting and solar global oscillations, a uniform torsional driver, an Archimedean spiral and a logarithmic spiral to mimic observed torsional motions in the solar photosphere are investigated. The numerical results are analysed using a novel method for extracting the parallel, perpendicular and azimuthal components of the perturbations, which can cater for linear and non-linear perturbations.

The energy flux balance is calculated for each wave mode excited by each of the simulated drivers.

We detect oscillations in the electron density, using the CHIANTI atomic database to perform spectroscopy. From the time-dependent wave signals from multiple spectral lines the relationship between relative density and temperature perturbations is determined, which allows in turn to measure the effective adiabatic index to be gamma(eff) = 1. 10 +/- 0. 02. This confirms that the thermal conduction along the magnetic field is very efficient in the solar corona. The thermal conduction coefficient is measured from the phase lag between the temperature and density, and is shown to be compatible with Spitzer conductivity. status: publishe...|$|E
