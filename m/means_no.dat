5|$|In the Roman Senate, Cato the Younger {{moves that}} Caesar be {{stripped}} of his command and recalled to Rome to answer charges of misusing his office and illegal warmongering. Pompey, as sole Consul present, vetoes the motion, insisting in trusting Caesar. At the theater that night, Scipio introduces his daughter Cornelia Metella to Pompey as a prospective wife, while Cato warns him that he must ally against Caesar {{before it is too}} late. Pompey again asserts that Caesar <b>means</b> <b>no</b> harm, although privately, he is troubled by Caesar's rising prestige and power and gives orders to one of his slaves who is leaving on a trip to Gaul. At night in the encampment of the 13th Legion, the Aquila (Eagle Standard) is stolen by brigands. To avoid a potentially disastrous drop in morale, Mark Antony orders Vorenus to retrieve it. As Vorenus feels the mission is doomed to failure, he has the condemned Pullo released from the stockade to assist him.|$|E

25|$|The CPU recognizes seven {{interrupt}} levels. Levels 1 through 5 {{are strictly}} prioritized. That is, a higher-numbered interrupt can always interrupt a lower-numbered interrupt. In the status register, a privileged instruction {{allows one to}} set the current minimum interrupt level, blocking lower or equal priority interrupts. For example, if the interrupt level in the status register is set to 3, higher levels from 4 to 7 can cause an exception. Level 7 is a level triggered Non-maskable interrupt (NMI). Level 1 can be interrupted by any higher level. Level 0 <b>means</b> <b>no</b> interrupt. The level is stored in the status register, and is visible to user-level programs.|$|E

25|$|The Yucatan is an extensive, {{limestone}} rich plains {{region that}} {{is dominated by}} karst topography and geology. Being karst landscape is significant, as no surface water is present. This <b>means</b> <b>no</b> major river systems and hardly any lakes {{are present in the}} northern Yucatan as the limestone lithology drains subterraneously. Any surface water that is retained is unsuitable for consumption and occurs in very small amounts. The underground drainage results in the northern Yucatan being covered in caves and sinkholes called Cenotes, which are subsequently used by the inhabitants to access drinkable ground water. Any relief in the Puuc region is due to unequal dissolution rates within the limestone bedrock, and never reaches 400 meters above sea level.|$|E

25|$|The Supreme Witch, known more colloquially as the Supreme, is a {{worldwide}} recognized status among the witches descending from the Salem witch trials. While most witches possess {{only a handful}} of gifts, the Supreme is said to embody multiple, if not all, gifts. Historically, there is said to be only one Supreme per generation (approximately 30–50 years). Part of being a Supreme <b>means</b> <b>no</b> ailments or diseases would harm them. The Supreme role comes with the responsibility of the entire Coven as a leader of the new generation. One of the most important tasks of the Supreme is to identify her successor, a task that wasn't accomplished by former Supreme Fiona Goode, and, as a consequence, multiple girls were tested and one of them died trying to perform the Seven Wonders.|$|E

25|$|Each team {{must have}} eight {{players in the}} scrum, unless for some reason (i.e. a sending-off or injury) they cannot field 15 players. Specialised front-row players (i.e. props and hookers) {{must be part of}} the scrum for safety reasons under the law. If a {{specialised}} player is not available, the scrum must have 'no weight', which <b>means</b> <b>no</b> player is allowed to push forward once the scrum commences. In cases where a front-row player is off the field due to a yellow card (compulsory 10 minutes off the field) or a red card (no longer allowed to participate in the game), a temporary substitution of another player is mandatory to ensure specialist front-row players participate in the scrum. If a team cannot field eight in the scrum, generally it drops the flankers or the number eight, but the props, hooker and locks must be maintained.|$|E
25|$|In the ASEAN region, Indonesia is {{the second}} largest market for Japanese food, after Thailand. Japanese cuisine has been {{increasingly}} popular as {{the growth of the}} Indonesians middle-class expecting higher quality foods. This is also contributed to the fact that Indonesia has large numbers of Japanese expatriates. The main concern is the halal issue. As a Muslim majority country, Indonesians expected that Japanese food served there are halal according to Islamic dietary law, which <b>means</b> <b>no</b> pork and alcohol allowed. Japanese restaurant in Indonesia often offer set menu which include rice served with array of Japanese favourite in a single setting. A set menu might include a choice of yakiniku or sukiyaki, including sample of sushi, tempura, gyoza and miso soup. Quite authenthic Japanese style izakaya and ramen shops can be found in Little Tokyo (Melawai) area in Blok M, South Jakarta, serving both Japanese expats and locals clientele. Today, Japanese restaurants can be found in most of Indonesian major cities, with high concentration in Greater Jakarta area, Bandung, Surabaya and Bali.|$|E
25|$|As {{the snail}}s can {{reproduce}} both sexually and asexually, the snail {{has been used}} as a model organism for studying the costs and benefits of sexual reproduction. Asexual reproduction allows all members of a population to produce offspring and avoids the costs involved in finding mates. However, asexual offspring are clonal, so lack variation. This makes them susceptible to parasites, as the entire clonal population has the same resistance mechanisms. Once a strain of parasite has overcome these mechanisms, it is able to infect any member of the population. Sexual reproduction mixes up resistance genes through crossing over and the random assortment of gametes in meiosis, meaning the members of a sexual population will all have subtly different combinations of resistance genes. This variation in resistance genes <b>means</b> <b>no</b> one parasite strain is able to sweep through the whole population. New Zealand mudsnails are commonly infected with trematode parasites, which are particularly abundant in shallow water, but scarce in deeper water. As predicted, sexual reproduction dominates in shallow water, due to its advantages in parasite resistance. Asexual reproduction is dominant in the deeper water of lakes, as the scarcity of parasites means that the advantages of resistance are outweighed by the costs of sexual reproduction.|$|E

40|$|Cyclic {{variability}} of spark ignition engines {{is recognized as}} a scatter in the combustion parameter recordings during actual operation in steady state conditions. Combustion variability may occur due to fluctuations in both early flame kernel development and in turbulent flame propagation with an impact on fuel consumption and emissions. In this study, a detailed chemistry model for the prediction of NO formation in homogeneous engine conditions is presented. The Wiebe parameterization {{is used for the}} prediction of heat release; then the calculated thermodynamic data are fed into the chemistry model to predict NO evolution at each degree of crank angle. Experimental data obtained from literature studies were used to validate the <b>mean</b> <b>NO</b> levels calculated. Then the model was applied to predict the impact of cyclic variability on <b>mean</b> <b>NO</b> and the amplitude of its variation. The cyclic variability was simulated by introducing random perturbations, which followed a normal distribution, to the Wiebe function parameters. The results of this approach show that the model proposed better predicts <b>mean</b> <b>NO</b> formation than earlier methods. Also, it shows that to the non linear formation rate of NO with temperature, cycle-to-cycle variation leads to higher <b>mean</b> <b>NO</b> emission levels than what one would predict without taking cyclic variation into account...|$|R
