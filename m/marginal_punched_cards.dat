50|$|One of the {{earliest}} text entry interfaces was the <b>punched</b> <b>card</b> input. A <b>punched</b> <b>card</b> input is a computer input device used to read executable computer programs, source code, and data from <b>punched</b> <b>cards.</b> Most early computers used <b>punched</b> <b>cards</b> as their main input device. Along with a <b>card</b> <b>punch,</b> <b>punched</b> <b>card</b> readers were an earlier method of entering data and running programs before {{the current generation of}} input devices existed. A <b>card</b> <b>punch</b> is an output device that <b>punches</b> holes in <b>cards</b> under computer control. Sometimes card readers were combined with <b>card</b> <b>punches</b> and, later, other devices to form multifunction machines.|$|R

50|$|<b>Punched</b> <b>cards</b> {{had been}} in use since the 1890s; their {{technology}} was mature and reliable. <b>Card</b> readers and <b>punches</b> developed for <b>punched</b> <b>card</b> machines were readily adaptable for computer use. Businesses were familiar with storing data on <b>punched</b> <b>cards</b> and keypunch machines were widely employed. <b>Punched</b> <b>cards</b> were a better fit than other 1950s technologies, such as magnetic tape, for some computer applications as individual cards could easily be updated without having to access a computer.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} machine-readable medium {{used for}} data (as opposed to control) was <b>punch</b> <b>card</b> used for {{records in the}} 1890 United States Census: each <b>punch</b> <b>card</b> was a single record. Compare the journal entry from 1880 and the <b>punch</b> <b>card</b> from 1895. Records were well established {{in the first half}} of the 20th century, when most data processing was done using <b>punched</b> <b>cards.</b> Typically each record of a data file would be recorded in one <b>punched</b> <b>card,</b> with specific columns assigned to specific fields. Generally, a record was the smallest unit that could be read in from external storage (e.g. card reader, tape or disk).|$|R

40|$|Background: Multidrug <b>punch</b> <b>cards</b> are frame {{cards with}} 28 plastic {{cavities}} {{filled with a}} patient’s oral solid medication. They are used in primary care to facilitate medication management and to enhance adherence. Main criticism concerned handling difficulties and fading knowledge about medication of patients using them. This study aimed at exploring daily use, preferences and adherence of primary care patients using multidrug <b>punch</b> <b>cards.</b> Methods: Community pharmacies in Switzerland recruited primary care patients using multidrug <b>punch</b> <b>cards.</b> A mixed methods approach was applied with quantitative interviews performed by telephone and qualitative interviews face-to-face. Results: Of 149 eligible patients from 21 community pharmacies, 22 participated 2011 in the quantitative and 11 participated 2013 / 14 in the qualitative interview. Patients were very satisfied with the multidrug <b>punch</b> <b>cards</b> and stated increased medication safety. All considered adherence as very important. Self-reported adherence was 10 (median) on a visual analogue scale (0 = no intake, 10 = perfect adherence). The absence of package inserts and predefined handling difficulties e. g., tablets spiking at removal were not perceived as problems. Conclusions: Patients are satisfied with the multidrug <b>punch</b> <b>cards,</b> feel safe, mostly have no handling problems and adhere to their treatment. Trust in health-care professionals and patients’ experiences emerged as key variables for initiating multidrug <b>punch</b> <b>card</b> use and for medication adherence. This mixed methods study invalidates previous concerns about disadvantages of multidrug <b>punch</b> <b>cards.</b> Health-care professionals should actively recommend them for primary care patients with polypharmacy and poor adherence...|$|R
