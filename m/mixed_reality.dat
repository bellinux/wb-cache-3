25|$|Composition on the Table (1998/99) {{comprises}} {{four white}} tables bearing physical interface components: switches, dials, and turntables. Computer graphics images are projected onto the tables from ceiling-mounted video projectors, and loudspeakers are present.

The objective of this work was to create a <b>mixed</b> <b>reality</b> environment where multiple participants could create visuals and music together.

Those in this limbo can eat, feel pain, and can even die again, only to awaken later with no injuries. Objects not originally present in this world can be created from dirt depending on the familiarity of it when alive. In the case of weapons, this can range from simple melee weapons to more complex firearms and explosives. In addition, computer programs can be used to create a <b>mixed</b> <b>reality,</b> as when Kanade creates her supernatural powers via a program called Angel Player.|$|E

[...] The report dismissed as [...] "mentally disturbed" [...] a Bosnian Serb soldier who had admitted participating in the killings, and claimed that the survivors' stories were a product of their imaginations: [...] "To walk for almost 20 days in an area that might be full of landmines, without any food and water, under the fear of being shot from any direction was such a trauma that soldiers sometimes <b>mixed</b> <b>reality</b> with illusions.

2500|$|In Shadowrun, Fourth Edition, the Matrix {{rules have}} changed, {{thanks to the}} setting's {{constant}} evolution and a drive to match real world technological developments. After the second Matrix crash in 2064, Matrix technology was {{moved away from the}} wired network and led into a wireless technology. The most noticeable difference between the Matrix in the 2070s and the earlier editions is that wireless technology has become completely ubiquitous. Communications and Matrix access is provided through Wi-Fi nodes placed throughout the infrastructure of just about every city on Earth, fulfilling a service similar to contemporary cell sites—but as these nodes are as numerous as telephone poles, only a tiny percentage of their range is necessary. The nodes of all electronic devices a person carries are connected in a similar manner, creating a Personal Area Network (PAN). People access their PAN with their Commlink, a combination personal computer/cell phone/PDA/wireless device available either as a brain implant or a head-mounted display. This access can be the total sensory immersion common to cyberpunk fiction, or a sensory enhancement by which the virtual features of one's physical surroundings can be perceived and manipulated. The Matrix of the 2070s is thus not only a virtual reality, but an augmented or <b>mixed</b> <b>reality.</b> Cyberdecks are obsolete, so [...] "deckers" [...] have once again become [...] "hackers". In turn, the otaku of previous versions (deckers who did not need decks to access the Matrix) have been reworked into technomancers, who possess an innate connection to the Matrix that permits them to access the wireless network without hardware.|$|E

The next day, [...] "during a counterattack, the enemy having {{advanced}} to within 300 meters of the first aid station, he immediately entered the engagement and though wounded refused to be evacuated until the Germans were thrown back". As {{a result of his}} actions, March received the French Croix de Guerre with Palm and the Army Distinguished Service Cross for valor (the Distinguished Service Cross is the second highest Army decoration, next only to the Medal of Honor). A curious detail emerges from the account of his war experiences that would find its way into his fiction: though it appears he was never gassed badly enough to be hospitalized for it, upon his return from the war he told people that he was and that he only had a short time to live; a number of characters in Company K suffer and die after mustard gas attacks. Roy Simmonds, March's biographer, locates what he calls the [...] "two worlds of William March" [...] (the title of his biography) in this period: throughout his life, March appears to have <b>mixed</b> <b>reality</b> with imagined memory, telling supposedly historical anecdotes that may not have been true.
