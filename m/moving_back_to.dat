Although he had developed his interest in prehistory through an examination of stone tools, he came to focus his attention on barrows, recognising that these were among the least well understood prehistoric monuments in the British landscape {{and one of the}} few that could be studied from the position of an amateur. At the time, a number of antiquarians were still active in southern England, with Grinsell being encouraged in his interests by prominent figures in this milieu such as Eliot Curwen and Hadrian Allcroft.|$|E

5|$|Mary {{wished to}} retire to Castile {{and live with}} her {{recently}} widowed sister Eleanor, near Charles, who had retired.

In the end, she {{decided to move to}} Castile, while retaining the possibility of <b>moving</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the Netherlands in case she could not adjust to the Castilian customs.

5|$|One-thousand years ago, the nomadic Timbisha (formerly called Shoshone {{and also}} known as Panamint or Koso) moved into the area and hunted game and {{gathered}} mesquite beans along with pinyon pine nuts. Because of the wide altitude differential between the valley bottom and the mountain ridges, especially on the west, the Timbisha practiced a vertical migration pattern. Their winter camps were located near water sources in the valley bottoms. As {{the spring and summer}} progressed and the weather warmed, grasses and other plant food sources ripened at progressively higher altitudes. November found them {{at the very top of}} the mountain ridges where they harvested pine nuts before <b>moving</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the valley bottom for winter.|$|E
5|$|Realising {{that they}} were being {{monitored}} by the Bavarian police, Lenin and the newspaper's other editors agreed to relocate Iskra to London, Britain, with Lenin and his wife arriving in the city in April 1902, there renting a flat in St. Pancras. Although despising English cuisine, Lenin liked London, spending much time in the Reading Room of the British Museum. He lived in close proximity to the other editors, but disliked their communal mode of living, instead becoming good friends with Trotsky, who had arrived in the city. While in London, Lenin fell ill with erysipelas and was unable to take such a leading role on the Iskra editorial board; in his absence the board approved a measure that he disagreed with, that of <b>moving</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Switzerland. Before relocating, Lenin holidayed in Brittany, France with his mother and sister.|$|E
5|$|The Foundation Stone of the Monument to the Early Founders of Singapore, {{usually called}} the Early Founders Memorial Stone is a {{national}} memorial that {{is dedicated to the}} early founders ("Unknown Immigrants") of Singapore.

The foundation stone was initially erected along Collyer Quay Street outside the Fullerton Hotel in 1970. After a series of setbacks and delays, the project was finally scrapped after no worthy design was accepted, which resulted the foundation stone becoming the memorial afterwards. In 2000, the memorial was relocated to the National Archives of Singapore at Canning Rise before <b>moving</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the grounds of The Fullerton Hotel in 2010.|$|E
