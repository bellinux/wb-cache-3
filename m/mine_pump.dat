The importance of coal mining drainage launched out mine pumpers exclusively and the Goyne Steam Pump Company invented, engineered, manufactured, and sold over 250 different mining pump designs and sizes, ranging from single pump up to the largest compound condensing duplex machines practicable for mining purposes throughout the anthracite and bituminous coal regions of Pennsylvania, and the United States. The Goyne Steam Pump Company changed the name to Goyne Pump Company in 1955, and the company was purchased in 1979 by Goulds Pumps.|$|E

40|$|A {{specification}} and top-level {{refinement of}} a simple <b>mine</b> <b>pump</b> control system, {{as well as a}} proof of correctness of the refinement, are presented {{as an example of the}} application of a formal method for the development of time-based systems. The overall approach makes use of a refinement calculus for timed systems similar to the refinement calculi for sequential programs. The specification makes use of topologically continuous functions of time to describe both analog and discrete properties of both the system and its refinements. The basic building block of specifications is a specification statement, similar to Morgan’s specification statement for sequential programs. It gives a clear separation between the specification of the assumptions that the system may make about the environment in which it is to be placed, and the effect the system is guaranteed to achieve if placed in such an environment. The top-level refinement of the system is developed by application of refinement laws that allow design decisions to be made, local state to be introduced, and the decomposition of systems into pipe-lined and/or parallel processes...|$|E
40|$|Formal {{specifications}} {{are one of}} {{the design}} choices in reactive and/or real-time systems as a number of notations exist to formally define parts of the system. However, defining the system formally is not enough to guarantee correctness thus the specifications are used as execution monitors over the system. A number of projects are around that provides a framework to define execution monitors in Interval Temporal Logic (ITL), such as Temporal-Rover [3], EAGLE Flier [1], and D 3 CA [2] framework. This paper briefly describes the D 3 CA framework, consist-ing in the adaptation of Quantified Discrete-Time Duration Calculus [7] to monitoring assertions. The D 3 CA framework uses the synchronous data-flow programming language Lus-tre as a generic platform for defining the notation. Addi-tionally, Lustre endows the framework with the ability to predetermine the space and time requirements of the mon-itoring system.

40|$|Safety-critical {{system is}} a class of systems whose failure may cause severe {{consequences}} as such systems have absolute demands regarding correctness of functional as well as timing behavior of the system. Our proposed CAGILY framework introduces a formal framework for identifying a set of test cases from a well-specified system to validate critical functionalities of the system. This framework incorporates the concept of component identification and specification, and defines contracts/morphisms by adapting the theories of constraint cross-product in category theory to generate sets of comprehensive test suites. The formalization {{of the system is}} provided by specifying the system composition using the specification and verification tool called Specware. Further, we have developed and implemented Sampuma tool, which generates a set of test cases depending on the constraints imposed on the system. We illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach by applying it to a case study of <b>mine</b> <b>pump</b> problem.

40|$|Water {{percolating}} into a mine {{is collected}} in a sump to be pumped out of the mine (see Figure 1). The water level sensors D and E detect when water is above a high and a low level respectively. A pump controller switches the pump on when the water reaches the high water level and off when it goes below the low water level. If, due to {{a failure of the}} pump, the water cannot be pumped out, the mine must be evacuated within one hour. The mine has other sensors (A, B, C) to monitor the carbon monoxide, methane and airflow levels. An alarm must be raised and the operator informed within one second of any of these levels becoming critical so that the mine can be evacuated within one hour. To avoid the risk of explosion, the pump must be operated only when the methane level is below a critical level. Human operators can also control the operation of the pump, but within limits. An operator can switch the pump on or off if the water is between the low and high water levels. A special operator, the supervisor, can switch the pump on or off without this restriction. In all cases, the methane level must be below its critical level if the pump is to be operated. Readings from all sensors, and a record of the operation of the pump, must be logged for later analysis. Safety requirements From the informal description of the <b>mine</b> <b>pump</b> and its operations we obtain the fol-lowing safety requirements: 1. The pump must not be operated if the methane level is critical. 2. The mine must be evacuated within one hour of the pump failing. 3.

40|$|Abstract Mining in Chingola Zambia started {{underground}} in 1931 and was catastrophically flooded and closed. The present Nchanga Underground Mine NUG {{started in}} 1937. The Nchanga Open Pit NOP mine started in 1955 situated {{to the west}} of NUG and partially overlying it. Open pit water control safety operations in the Nchanga-Chingola area have successfully enabled the safe extraction of millions of tonnes of copper ore annually over the past 60 years from NUG mining as well as the NOP. At the start Nchanga mining license surface already had NUG and many watershed divides with the Nchanga and Chingola streams being the main streams feeding into Zambias second largest river Kafue river and 42 of the year was characterised by heavy rains ranging between 800 mm to 1300 mm per annum. In this paper the presence of very significant amounts of seasonal rain and subsurface water in the mining area was identified as both a curse and a blessing. An excess in seasonal rain and subsurface water would disrupt both open pit and underground mining operations. In order for NOP to be operated successfully stable and free from flooding coping water management tactics were adopted from 1955 to 2015 including 1. Underground <b>mine</b> <b>pump</b> chamber pumping system 2. Piezometer instrumented boreholes 3. Underground mine 1500 -ft sub-haulage east borehole dewatering beneath the open pit 4.

Application of grout curtains along the Vistula River Poland was noted as a possibility in the right circumstances although it had never been used at Nchanga Open Pit.

40|$|Thesis (M. Ing. (Mechanical Engineering)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2005. The {{purpose of}} this study was to do an energy cost {{optimisation}} on a specific complex <b>mine</b> <b>pumping</b> system by means of load shift. A Real-Time Energy Management System (REMS) was installed on the <b>mine</b> and the <b>pumps</b> were controlled according to certain constraints. The results that were obtained were very satisfactory. This project was undertaken on Elandsrand Mine and was a part of Eskom's Demand Side Management (DSM) initiative. Eskom fully finances these load shifting projects to encourage Energy Savings Companies (ESCOs) to undertake load shift projects in order to reduce the national peak demand profile. The project entailed doing a detailed investigation of the <b>mine's</b> <b>pumping</b> system. The pumping system was analysed and simulated according to specific constraints that were specified by the mine. After the simulation was completed, an optimisation on this simulation was done and the pumping system was fully automated to react to the changing electricity tariff. This automation led to a successful load-shifting project. Load shift means that the demand, during peak periods, is decreased. This is done by moving the energy requirement to another time of day when the demand and therefore the cost is less. However, the total energy used for the day remains the same. Load shift decreases the energy demand during the peak periods and at the same time generate savings for the relevant energy user. The average load shift that was obtained for the 5 months (June -November 2004) was 3. 66 MW. This load shift has resulted in an average monthly cost saving for the mine of R 60 000. This project showed that with the necessary historical data and expertise, a load shifting project, and therefore a cost optimisation project, can be successfully implemented on a <b>mine's</b> <b>pumping</b> system. This method can also be successfully applied to other electrical components on the mineMaster...|$|R
