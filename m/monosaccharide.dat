5|$|Lactose, maltose, and sucrose are all {{compound}} sugars, disaccharides, {{with the}} general formula C12H22O11. They are formed by the combination of two <b>monosaccharide</b> molecules with the exclusion of a molecule of water.|$|E
5|$|Selenium may be {{measured}} in blood, plasma, serum, or urine to monitor excessive environmental or occupational exposure, to confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in hospitalized victims, or investigate a suspected case of fatal overdose. Some analytical techniques are capable of distinguishing organic from inorganic forms of the element. Both organic and inorganic forms of selenium are largely converted to <b>monosaccharide</b> conjugates (selenosugars) in the body prior elimination in the urine. Cancer patients receiving daily oral doses of selenothionine may achieve very high plasma and urine selenium concentrations.|$|E
5|$|Saccharolipids {{describe}} {{compounds in}} which fatty acids are linked {{directly to a}} sugar backbone, forming structures that are compatible with membrane bilayers. In the saccharolipids, a <b>monosaccharide</b> substitutes for the glycerol backbone present in glycerolipids and glycerophospholipids. The most familiar saccharolipids are the acylated glucosamine precursors of the LipidA component of the lipopolysaccharides in Gram-negative bacteria. Typical lipidA molecules are disaccharides of glucosamine, which are derivatized {{with as many as}} seven fatty-acyl chains. The minimal lipopolysaccharide required for growth in E. coli is Kdo2-Lipid A, a hexa-acylated disaccharide of glucosamine that is glycosylated with two 3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonic acid (Kdo) residues.|$|E
50|$|Carbohydrates {{are another}} {{important}} biomolecule. These are polymers, called polysaccharides, {{which are made}} up of chains of simple sugars connected via glycosidic bonds. These <b>monosaccharides</b> consist of a five to six carbon ring that contains carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen - typically in a 1:2:1 ratio, respectively. Common <b>monosaccharides</b> are glucose, fructose, and ribose. When linked together <b>monosaccharides</b> can form disaccharides, oligosaccharides, and polysaccharides: the nomenclature is dependent on the number of <b>monosaccharides</b> linked together. Common dissacharides, two <b>monosaccharides</b> joined together, are sucrose, maltose, and lactose. Important polysaccharides, links of many <b>monosaccharides,</b> are cellulose, starch, and chitin.|$|R
5000|$|All <b>monosaccharides</b> are {{reducing}} sugars because all <b>monosaccharides</b> have an aldehyde group (if they are aldoses) or can tautomerize in solution {{to form an}} aldehyde group (if they are ketoses). This includes common <b>monosaccharides</b> like galactose, glucose, glyceraldehyde, fructose, ribose, and xylose.|$|R
50|$|The {{dehydration}} {{reaction that}} bonds <b>monosaccharides</b> into disaccharides (and also bonds <b>monosaccharides</b> into more complex polysaccharides) forms {{what are called}} glycosidic bonds.|$|R
5|$|Topiramate, a {{derivative}} of the naturally occurring sugar <b>monosaccharide</b> D-fructose, {{has been found}} effective in helping alcoholics quit or {{cut back on the}} amount they drink. Evidence suggests that topiramate antagonizes excitatory glutamate receptors, inhibits dopamine release, and enhances inhibitory gamma-aminobutyric acid function. A 2008 review of the effectiveness of topiramate concluded that the results of published trials are promising, however, as of 2008, data was insufficient to support using topiramate in conjunction with brief weekly compliance counseling as a first-line agent for alcohol dependence. A 2010 review found that topiramate may be superior to existing alcohol pharmacotherapeutic options. Topiramate effectively reduces craving and alcohol withdrawal severity as well as improving quality-of-life-ratings.|$|E
5|$|Manufacturers aim for a {{moisture}} content of 50-to-52 percent and a fat-in-dry-matter content of 35-to-40 percent. A {{study published in}} the International Journal of Food & Science Technology found that a 12.5:87.5 blend of vetch milk and bovine milk improved stretchiness and melting characteristics. Vetch is a legume that has seeds which are similar to lentils. An experiment published in the International Journal of Dairy Technology suggested that the level of galactose, a <b>monosaccharide</b> sugar that is less sweet than glucose and fructose, can be reduced using different culture techniques. An article in the International Journal of Food Engineering found that trisodium citrate, a food additive used to preserve and add flavor to foods, slightly improved the preferred qualities of pizza cheese. Research published in Dairy Industries International suggested that denatured whey proteins increased moisture retention, but that the improvements were very slight and not economically worthwhile relative to the minor improvements.|$|E
25|$|In glycolysis, oligo/polysaccharides are cleaved {{first to}} smaller monosaccharides by enzymes called {{glycoside}} hydrolases. The <b>monosaccharide</b> units can then enter into <b>monosaccharide</b> catabolism. In some cases, as with humans, not all carbohydrate types are usable as the digestive and metabolic enzymes necessary are not present.|$|E
40|$|The {{spectral}} {{characteristics of}} solutions of eighteen representative <b>monosaccharides</b> in 79 per cent sulfuric acid have been determined for solutions maintained for 2 hours at 25 ° and 15 minutes at 100 °. The {{use of these}} data for the identification of ketohexoses and 6 -desoxyaldohexoses has been pointed out, as has their application to the quantitative determination of certain <b>monosaccharides</b> when present singly or in admixture with other <b>monosaccharides,</b> either as the <b>monosaccharides</b> or as components of oligosaccharides and polysaccharides...|$|R
50|$|Fehling's {{test can}} be used as a generic test for <b>monosaccharides</b> and other {{reducing}} sugars (e.g., maltose). It will give a positive result for aldose <b>monosaccharides</b> (due to the oxidisable aldehyde group) but also for ketose <b>monosaccharides,</b> as they are converted to aldoses by the base in the reagent, and then give a positive result.|$|R
30|$|However, the {{possibilities}} of NF separations for <b>monosaccharides</b> with similar molecular weights have seldom been studied, and the transport mechanisms for <b>monosaccharides</b> are not fully understood. From the traditional point of view, membrane filtration would require a tenfold difference in molar mass or threefold difference in hydrodynamic radius for separation of components from each other (Sjoman et al. 2007). Simultaneously, many mathematical models have been proposed to describe and predict the process of NF. Generally, the filtration mechanisms involve mainly steric hindrance (Bowen et al. 1997), Donnan exclusion (Schaep et al. 2001), and dielectric exclusion effects (Yaroshchuk 2001). Nevertheless, the NF separation mechanisms for mixed <b>monosaccharides</b> with similar molecular weights were seldom studied {{and many of them}} focused on the study of neutral <b>monosaccharides,</b> such as xylose and glucose (Sjoman et al. 2007). Different from neutral <b>monosaccharides,</b> GAH is one kind of the cationic <b>monosaccharides</b> and the molecular weights of GAH and NAG are similar.|$|R
25|$|Two joined monosaccharides {{are called}} a {{disaccharide}} {{and these are}} the simplest polysaccharides. Examples include sucrose and lactose. They are composed of two <b>monosaccharide</b> units bound together by a covalent bond known as a glycosidic linkage formed via a dehydration reaction, resulting in the loss of a hydrogen atom from one <b>monosaccharide</b> and a hydroxyl group from the other. The formula of unmodified disaccharides is C12H22O11. Although there are numerous kinds of disaccharides, a handful of disaccharides are particularly notable.|$|E
25|$|Catabolism is the {{metabolic}} reaction which cells undergo to extract energy. There {{are two major}} metabolic pathways of <b>monosaccharide</b> catabolism: glycolysis and the citric acid cycle.|$|E
25|$|The open-chain {{form of a}} <b>monosaccharide</b> often coexists with {{a closed}} ring form where the aldehyde/ketone {{carbonyl}} group carbon (C=O) and hydroxyl group (–OH) react forming a hemiacetal with a new C–O–C bridge.|$|E
30|$|<b>Monosaccharides</b> are {{difficult}} to analyze because they have analogous physical and chemical characteristics (Medeiros and Simoneit 2007; Medlicott and Thompson 1985; Masuko et al. 2005). In addition, {{the lack of an}} appropriate chromophore makes the detection of <b>monosaccharides</b> via conventional UV-based instruments challenging (Dürr et al. 2004; Cheng and Her 2002). Several HPLC methods using various detection strategies were developed to assist the detection and analysis of <b>monosaccharides</b> (Castellari et al. 2000; Rogatsky et al. 2005). Nonetheless, low sensitivity and inapplicability to gradient elution hindered rapid and accurate determination of <b>monosaccharides</b> using these approaches (Ko et al. 2005).|$|R
50|$|Glycals {{have many}} uses in {{synthetic}} carbohydrate chemistry. They {{are commonly used}} as glycosylation donors, meaning that they can react with other <b>monosaccharides</b> to form a longer chain of <b>monosaccharides</b> called an oligosaccharide.|$|R
50|$|Natural saccharides are {{generally}} of simple carbohydrates called <b>monosaccharides</b> with general formula (CH2O)n where n is three or more. Examples of <b>monosaccharides</b> are glucose, fructose, and glyceraldehyde. Polysaccharides, meanwhile, {{have a general}} formula of Cx(H2O)y where x is usually a large number between 200 and 2500. When the repeating units in the polymer backbone are six-carbon <b>monosaccharides,</b> {{as is often the}} case, the general formula simplifies to (C6H10O5)n, where typically 40≤n≤3000.|$|R
25|$|Ribose is a {{carbohydrate}} {{with the}} formula C5H10O5; specifically, it is a pentose <b>monosaccharide</b> (simple sugar) with linear form H−(C=O)−(CHOH)4−H, which {{has all the}} hydroxyl groups {{on the same side}} in the Fischer projection.|$|E
25|$|One {{method of}} {{reducing}} the volume of flatus produced is dietary modification, {{reducing the amount of}} fermentable carbohydrates. This is the theory behind diets such as the low FODMAP diet (low fermentable oligosaccharide, dissacharide, <b>monosaccharide</b> and polyols).|$|E
25|$|Monosaccharides are {{classified}} according to three different characteristics: {{the placement of}} its carbonyl group, the number of carbon atoms it contains, and its chiral handedness. If the carbonyl group is an aldehyde, the <b>monosaccharide</b> is an aldose; if the carbonyl group is a ketone, the <b>monosaccharide</b> is a ketose. Monosaccharides with three carbon atoms are called trioses, those with four are called tetroses, five are called pentoses, six are hexoses, and so on. These two systems of classification are often combined. For example, glucose is an aldohexose (a six-carbon aldehyde), ribose is an aldopentose (a five-carbon aldehyde), and fructose is a ketohexose (a six-carbon ketone).|$|E
40|$|We have {{determined}} {{the contents of}} <b>monosaccharides</b> in the hydrolysates of some yogurt and orange juice products by derivatizing <b>monosaccharides</b> with p-aminobenzoic acid ethyl ester (ABEE). The separation of the ABEE-derivatized <b>monosaccharides</b> was efficiently carried out by HPLC using a microcolumn packed with the Alltima C 18 stationary phase. The concentrations of <b>monosaccharides</b> were determined {{based on the measured}} peak area/height counts. ABEE derivatization of fructose and its detection have never been successfully carried out before this work. In this study, two peaks were observed in a fixed ratio for ABEE-fructose, and the ratio was maintained over a wide range of fructose concentration. In order to prove the validity of the above method, we compared the concentrations of glucose, galactose and fructose determined by ABEE derivatization and UVD (ultraviolet detector) chromatography with those determined by RID (refractive index detector) chromatography without derivatization. The determined concentrations of <b>monosaccharides</b> obtained from the two chromatographic methods were found close to each other within acceptable error ranges.

50|$|A {{disaccharide}} (also {{called a}} double sugar or biose) is the sugar formed when two <b>monosaccharides</b> (simple sugars) {{are joined by}} glycosidic linkage. Like <b>monosaccharides,</b> disaccharides are soluble in water. Three common examples are sucrose, lactose, and maltose.|$|R
40|$|The {{relationships}} of antioxidant properties (AOPs), measured by four conventional in vitro methods, with <b>monosaccharides</b> and glycosyl linkages in the polysaccharide, were evaluated using {{multiple linear regression}} analysis with minor modifications. Polysaccharides extracted from culture broth filtrates of Lentinula edodes were used as model samples for evaluation. Results indicate that the composition of <b>monosaccharides</b> {{and the type of}} glycosyl linkage modulates the AOPs of the polysaccharides. The AOPs of the polysaccharides were dependent on the ratios of different <b>monosaccharides</b> in the composition. Among the <b>monosaccharides,</b> rhamnose was the most significant determinant factor associated with AOPs. The glycosyl linkages of the <b>monosaccharides</b> also affected the anti-oxidation characteristics of the polysaccharides. Specifically, the arabinose 1 -> 4 and mannose 1 -> 2 linkages of the side-chain were significantly related to the reducing power, whereas the glucose 1 -> 6 linkage and arabinose 1 -> 4 linkages were related to the scavenging on DPPH(-) radicals.

25|$|Sucrose {{is formed}} by plants and {{cyanobacteria}} {{but not by}} other organisms. Sucrose is found naturally in many food plants along with the <b>monosaccharide</b> fructose. In many fruits, such as pineapple and apricot, sucrose is the main sugar. In others, such as grapes and pears, fructose is the main sugar.|$|E
25|$|The {{aldehyde}} or ketone {{group of}} a straight-chain <b>monosaccharide</b> will react reversibly with a hydroxyl group {{on a different}} carbon atom to form a hemiacetal or hemiketal, forming a heterocyclic ring with an oxygen bridge between two carbon atoms. Rings with five and six atoms are called furanose and pyranose forms, respectively, and exist in equilibrium with the straight-chain form.|$|E
25|$|Monosaccharides can {{be linked}} {{together}} into what are called polysaccharides (or oligosaccharides) in a large variety of ways. Many carbohydrates contain one or more modified <b>monosaccharide</b> units that have had one or more groups replaced or removed. For example, deoxyribose, a component of DNA, is {{a modified version of}} ribose; chitin is composed of repeating units of N-acetyl glucosamine, a nitrogen-containing form of glucose.|$|E
50|$|Dehydration {{reactions}} and dehydration synthesis {{have the same}} meaning, and are often used interchangeably. Two <b>monosaccharides,</b> such as glucose and fructose, can be joined together (to form sucrose) using dehydration synthesis. The new molecule, consisting of two <b>monosaccharides,</b> is called a disaccharide.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Monosaccharides</b> can {{be linked}} {{together}} by glycosidic bonds, which can be cleaved by hydrolysis. Two, three, several or many <b>monosaccharides</b> thus linked form disaccharides, trisaccharides, oligosaccharides or polysaccharides, respectively. Enzymes that hydrolyse glycosidic bonds are called [...] "glycoside hydrolases" [...] or [...] "glycosidases".|$|R
50|$|Digestion {{involves}} breakdown to the <b>monosaccharides.</b>|$|R
25|$|Ribose is an {{aldopentose}} (a <b>monosaccharide</b> containing five carbon atoms) that, in its open chain form, has an aldehyde {{functional group}} at one end. In the conventional numbering scheme for monosaccharides, the carbon atoms are numbered from C1' (in the aldehyde group) to C5'. The deoxyribose derivative found in DNA differs from ribose {{by having a}} hydrogen atom {{in place of the}} hydroxyl group at C2'. This hydroxyl group performs a function in RNA splicing.|$|E
25|$|This is well {{illustrated}} by the <b>monosaccharide</b> uptake system in Amanita muscaria. Carbon uptake requires a transporter, AmMST1, that is only expressed when the fungus is cultured at low glucose levels in multiple mycorrhizal associations. This expression, and increased import of monosaccharides by the fungus, is met {{with an increase in}} the supply of photoassimilates from the plant host. In the reverse direction, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC) moderates the assimilation of ammonium and the transport of amino acids from fungus to plant.|$|E
25|$|Carbohydrates perform {{numerous}} {{roles in}} living organisms. Polysaccharides serve for {{the storage of}} energy (e.g. starch and glycogen) and as structural components (e.g. cellulose in plants and chitin in arthropods). The 5-carbon <b>monosaccharide</b> ribose {{is an important component}} of coenzymes (e.g. ATP, FAD and NAD) and the backbone of the genetic molecule known as RNA. The related deoxyribose is a component of DNA. Saccharides and their derivatives include many other important biomolecules that play key roles in the immune system, fertilization, preventing pathogenesis, blood clotting, and development.|$|E
50|$|Individual {{saccharide}} residues are termed <b>monosaccharides.</b>|$|R
40|$|<b>Monosaccharides</b> were derivatized using methylboronic {{acid and}} N,O-bis(trimethylsilyl) trifluoroacetamide (BSTFA), and the 13 C values of these {{derivatives}} measured by gas chromatography/combustion/isotope-ratio-monitoring mass spectrometry {{to determine the}} original 13 C-content of the <b>monosaccharides.</b> Comparison with the measured off-line 13 values of the <b>monosaccharides</b> shows that no fractionation in 13 C takes place during derivatization. The methylboronic derivatization method {{has proven to be}} a new method for natural abundance isotopic analysis of intact <b>monosaccharides</b> (arabinose, xylose, fucose, fructose and glucose). The method is rapid, does not involve isotopic fractionation during derivatization, and gives more precise 13 C values than other methods reported. The method was successfully applied to determine the 13 C value of glucose of the freshwater alga Scenedesmus communi...|$|R
5000|$|A {{reducing}} sugar is any sugar that {{is capable of}} acting as a reducing agent because it has a free aldehyde group or a free ketone group. All <b>monosaccharides</b> are {{reducing sugar}}s, along with some disaccharides, oligosaccharides, and polysaccharides. The <b>monosaccharides</b> can be divided into two groups: the aldoses, which have an aldehyde group, and the ketoses, which have a ketone group. Ketoses must first tautomerize to aldoses before they can act as reducing sugars. The common dietary <b>monosaccharides</b> galactose, glucose and fructose are all reducing sugars.|$|R
