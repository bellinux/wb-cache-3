25|$|FitzGerald's {{government}} {{lasted until}} January 1982 when it collapsed {{due to a}} controversial budget which proposed the application of Value Added Tax to children's shoes, previously exempt. FitzGerald, no longer having {{a majority in the}} Dáil, went to Áras an Uachtaráin to advise President Hillery to dissolve the Dáil and call a general election. However, the night the government collapsed the Fianna Fáil Front Bench issued a statement encouraging the President not to grant the dissolution and to allow Fianna Fáil to form a government. Phone calls were also made to the President by Brian Lenihan. Haughey, on attempting to contact his former colleague the President, and on failing to be put through to him, was reported to have threatened the President's aide de camp by telling him that he would be Taoiseach one day and when that happened, I intend to roast your fucking arse if you don't put <b>me</b> <b>through</b> immediately. Hillery considered such pressure to be gross misconduct, and granted the dissolution.|$|E

"Battle of the Bastards" [...] {{was also}} the last episode for {{recurring}} character Rickon Stark (Art Parkinson), who had appeared since the series premiere episode [...] "Winter Is Coming". In an IGN interview, Parkinson {{said that he was}} tipped off about his character's death: [...] "Whenever I was told that I was coming back for Season 6, before they sent <b>me</b> <b>through</b> the scripts and stuff, they sent <b>me</b> <b>through</b> a ring just to say, 'Listen, so that you don't get a shock whenever you read the scripts, just know that you die this season. He continued, [...] "Whenever I came back, I was excited to come back, and the scenes all seemed pretty amazing. I was so happy to re-embrace the character." [...] According to Parkinson, he was sorry that Rickon would die but his manner of death was a compensation: [...] "It was a cool death, and it was {{always going to be a}} good death, so at the same time, I was pretty happy." ...|$|E

That {{has to be very}} believable ... I think the hardest part is doing the actual stunts, the stunt-fighting. That's a whole other thing. I'm not really punching out the stunt guy, nor are they hitting me, so it's learning this dance, really, within the fight. It's how to pull back, how to take a hit and make it look real.|$|E
500|$|Thompson {{spent five}} years writing and {{revising}} the screenplay, both during and between shooting other films.

[...] She observed that in a screenwriting process, a first draft often had [...] "a lot of good stuff in it" [...] but needed to be edited, and second drafts would [...] "almost certainly be rubbish... because {{you get into a}} panic." [...] Thompson credits Doran for [...] "help me, nourish me and mentor <b>me</b> <b>through</b> that process... I learned about screenwriting at her feet." ...|$|E

Tournament fans were extremely hostile towards the Thunder, and after it was eliminated in the semi-finals Fleury accused them of racism and threatened to return his 2002 Olympic gold medal: [...] "The one thing that's really bothered <b>me</b> <b>through</b> {{this whole thing is}} the prejudice, still, in this country when it comes to native people. I've seen it first-hand in every building we go into, how these people are treated, and it's absolutely embarrassing to be a Canadian and know that stuff is still going on." ...|$|E

500|$|... 'I {{wrote it}} because it was {{necessary}} for me to write it,' Mariah said of her most personal, and angriest, song to date. Fans might be surprised at her references to 'the hell that we built' and the 'violent times,' but Mariah thinks this song is for 'anyone who’s been in an abusive relationship.' 'You know what? I’ve been through too much at this point,' she said. 'I want happiness and I want pure and real love, but the side effects of what other relationships have put <b>me</b> <b>through</b> cause me to be kind of on the defensive a lot of the time. And if somebody isn’t mature or caring and loving and open-hearted enough to understand that, then it’s tough, but this is a song for people who need that.' Mariah hopes that this song helps people feel 'a little bit stronger.' ...|$|E
500|$|Before the fight, sports writers {{considered}} Gomez a tough opponent for Khan, {{with his}} [...] "knockout punch" [...] and his success against Alex Arthur in similar circumstances, despite having lost {{three of his}} last six fights.

500|$|Amy Sciarretto for Popcrush {{noted that}} Lewis {{appeared}} to be restraining her vocals on the song, writing [...] "Lewis exercising incredible restraint, as she doesn’t let her remarkable, room-filling, enviable voice soar like we are used to." [...] Sciarretto continued to note that {{towards the end of}} the song, the singer does not show any restraint, and that it is a common device used in song production as it allows the singer to build tension. Lyrically, [...] "Collide" [...] is a love song, in which Lewis sings [...] "I'll pick you up when you're down / Be there when no one's around / I'm in tune with how you feel / Everything 'bout this is real / When you're in unfamiliar places / Count on <b>me</b> <b>through</b> life's changes." [...] Sciarretto also noted that it is when Lewis performs the lyric [...] "Crash into me / At full speed," [...] that she allows herself to not hold back in her vocal performance, and delivers it with [...] "power and breadth".|$|E
500|$|In the Underworld, Proserpina, Queen of Hades, who {{has been}} deeply {{affected}} by Orfeo's singing, petitions King Plutone, her husband, for Euridice's release. Moved by her pleas, Plutone agrees on the condition that, as he leads Euridice towards the world, Orfeo must not look back. If he does, [...] "a single glance will condemn him to eternal loss". Orfeo enters, leading Euridice and singing confidently that on that day he will rest on his wife's white bosom. But as he sings a note of doubt creeps in: [...] "Who will assure me that she is following?". Perhaps, he thinks, Plutone, driven by envy, has imposed the condition through spite? Suddenly distracted by an off-stage commotion, Orfeo looks round; immediately, the image of Euridice begins to fade. She sings, despairingly: [...] "Losest thou <b>me</b> <b>through</b> too much love?" [...] and disappears. Orfeo attempts to follow her but is drawn away by an unseen force. The chorus of spirits sings that Orfeo, having overcome Hades, was in turn overcome by his passions.|$|E
