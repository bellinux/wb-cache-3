30|$|<b>Collective</b> <b>bargaining</b> {{and many}} of its {{underpinning}} laws and institutions are the product of major crises, not least the Great Depression of the 1930 s, which became the inspiration for multi-employer bargaining and the rules that for half a century and longer ensured wide-ranging coverage of wage agreements. In the United States these were the founding years of industrial unions organizing across firms in mass production industries. In post-war Western Europe multi-employer bargaining at national and sectoral levels became the cornerstone not only of wage setting but also of labour market regulation more generally. After 1989 the labour laws in post-communist Europe made explicitly room for <b>multi-employer</b> <b>bargaining.</b> Although <b>collective</b> <b>bargaining</b> changed in many ways both in content and structure, the multi-employer nature of bargaining remained remarkably stable, at least in continental Western Europe and until the Great Recession.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT ■ <b>Collective</b> <b>bargaining</b> in most European {{countries}} {{takes the}} form of <b>multi-employer</b> <b>collective</b> agreements. In the three Scandinavian countries, a two-tier model of bargaining has developed in many sectors: sectoral agreements prescribe national standards and nationally agreed wage increases, but they also give procedural and economic guidelines or frameworks for local or firm-level pay arrangement. Dispute resolution procedures at local level are the crucial link between levels, and a variety of such procedures are discussed. Similar examples of two-tier models can be found in other European countries, but they seem to be more fully developed in the Scandinavian countries. Possible explanations are considered, together with a discussion of the different forms of variation in wages opened up by two-tier models...|$|R
40|$|The article makes {{four main}} arguments. First, {{collective}} bargaining {{has the capacity}} to mitigate the negative effects arising from market volatility, and the process of marketization, by establishing arrangements which provide substantive and procedural certainty for both workers and employers, and greater security for workers. Second, multi-employer bargaining arrangements are better equipped to fulfil this function than single-employer ones. Third, there are institutional differences amongst multi-employer bargaining arrangements concerning governance of bargaining at the company level which considerably influence their capacity to promote certainty and security.

40|$|Change in {{employment}} {{practice in the}} European construction industry is reviewed with {{particular attention to the}} effects of flexible working on established arrangements for national <b>collective</b> <b>bargaining.</b> Data derive from European survey research coordinated by Cranfield School of Management in 1995 and from interviews with trade union and employers association representatives in the same period. Membership and support for trade unions and employers associations has weakened, although there are significant differences between countries. The most significant changes {{in employment}} practice in construction are found in the increased use of temporary, short term and fixed term contracts; in subcontracting, and in the use of overtime. These changing working practices tend to fragment the workforce and to undermine established systems of institutional interest representation. The distinctive commitment of UK employers to temporary or casual work and to subcontracting is confirmed. The changes contribute to pressure on arrangements established through multi-employer bargaining, although employers and trade union representatives remained committed, at the time of our research, to <b>multi-employer</b> <b>collective</b> agreements. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Various factors {{influence}} {{the development of}} collective bargaining structures. Based on cross-sectional and pooled cross-sectional data from the British Workplace Employment Relations Survey series, this article discusses and empirically analyses the establishment-level determinants of collective bargaining centralization, i. e. whether an establishment is covered by single-employer collective bargaining or <b>multi-employer</b> <b>collective</b> <b>bargaining.</b> It argues that the employers ’ and trade unions ’ preferences for a particular bargaining structure depend {{on the outcome of}} cost–benefit analyses of different available institutional alternatives. The actual choice of a collective bargaining structure then reflects the interaction of the actors ’ preferences, moderated by an institutionally determined decision-making process. Estimation of a probit model with pooled cross-sectional data shows that the number of unions present at the establishment, membership of an employers ’ association, and public sector affiliation are positively associated with collective bargaining centralization. In contrast to this, establishment size, trade union density, foreign ownership and control, and international product markets are negatively associated with centralization. Neither establishment age nor foreign ownership appeared to be significant...|$|E
40|$|The Thatcher and Reagan administrations led a {{shift towards}} more market {{oriented}} regulation of {{economies in the}} Anglo-American countries, including efforts to reduce the power of organized labor. In this paper, we examine the development of employment and labor law in six Anglo-American countries (the U. S., Canada, the U. K., Ireland, Australia, and New Zealand) from the Thatcher/Reagan era to the present. At {{the outset of the}} Thatcher/Reagan era, the employment and labor law systems in these countries could be divided into three pairings: the Wagner Act model based industrial relations systems of the United States and Canada; the voluntarist system of collective bargaining and strong unions in the United Kingdom and Ireland; and the highly centralized, legalistic Award systems of Australia and New Zealand. Indeed, such a historical perspective contradicts the idea {{that there has been a}} longstanding Anglo-American model of liberal market economic ordering as has sometimes been suggested, e. g. in the varieties of capitalism literature. However, looking at the current state of the employment relations systems in these six countries, we argue that there has been growing convergence in two major areas. There has been a convergence in the area of labour rights toward private ordering of employment relations and away from the idea of work and employment being a matter subject to public ordering. By private ordering, we mean the idea that work and employment terms and conditions are primarily determined at the level of the individual organization, whether through collective bargaining between unions and employers at the organizational level, through individual negotiations, or through unilateral employer establishment of the terms and conditions of employment. The shift away from public ordering of work and employment is most dramatic in the cases of Australia and New Zealand, where the publicly established system of centralized Awards has given way to organizational level ordering of employment relations through workplace or individual level agreements. In the United Kingdom, the shift to greater private ordering is most evident in the breakdown of <b>multi-employer</b> <b>collective</b> <b>bargaining,</b> the weakening of industry wide standards enforced by strong unions, and the growth of nonunion representation at the enterprise level. By contrast, the much lesser degree of change in the labour rights area in North America reflects the historical situation that the Wagner Act model was from the outset a model built around the idea of private ordering. When we turn to the area of employment rights, we also see a convergence across the six Anglo-American countries toward a model in which the role of employment law is to establish a basket of minimum standards that are built into the employment relationship, which can then be improved upon by the parties. Within these general trends, we do see some variation in the degree of convergence on these models of labour and employment rights regulation across the Anglo-American countries. The strongest degree of similarity in adoption of the private ordering in labour rights and the minimum standards basket in employment rights is found in four of the countries: Canada, the United Kingdom, New Zealand and, with recent legislative changes, Australia. Each of these countries has adopted labour laws that favour organizational level economic ordering, but with reasonably substantial protections of trade union organizing and bargaining rights, and a set of minimum employment standards that includes similar sets of minimum wage, basic leave entitlements and unfair dismissal protections. The first outlier in this study is Ireland. The Irish employment relations system stands out as the only one that has continued to have a significant degree of central coordination and public ordering of employment relations. Although there is substantial coordination at the central level, at the organizational level, the Irish system resembles the other Anglo-American countries much more closely, suggesting that it has the potential to evolve in a similar direction. The other outlier is the United States. Structurally its system is similar to the other Anglo-American countries in emphasizing private ordering in labour law and the role of employment law as being to establish a minimum basket of basic standards. However, where the United States diverges from the other countries is that its system has involved a general favouring of the interests of employers over those of employees and organized labour in the implementation of the model...|$|E
