40|$|Backgrounds and Objectives: Improvement {{of water}} quality {{standards}} and inability of mono layer filters in producing such quality caused researchers attended to multi layer filters. Due to specific characteristics of anthracite and leca can improve removal of organic materials and Surface over flow rate. The {{aim of this}} research was evaluation performance of dual <b>media</b> <b>filters</b> (anthracite/leca) in removing of organic materials and turbidity from Ahvaz Water treatment plant. Materials and Methods: In this study two pilots built for investigation of mono layer <b>filter</b> and dual <b>media</b> <b>filter</b> performance. The researcher used sand in structures media of mono layer filter and composition of anthracite, sand and leca in structures media of dual <b>media</b> <b>filter,</b> respectively. In this study single and dual layer filter pilot examined in term of organic matter and turbidity removal efficiency. Results: Results indicated that removal of organic matter by single layer <b>filter</b> (sand), dual <b>media</b> <b>filter</b> (anthracite and sand), dual <b>media</b> <b>filter</b> (leca and sand) was 7 %, 12 %, 4 / 2 % respectively. And also Turbidity removal by single layer filter(sand), dual <b>media</b> <b>filter</b> (anthracite and sand), dual <b>media</b> <b>filter</b> (leca and sand) was also 69 %, 80 %, 74 % respectively. Conclusion: Results of this study showed that upgrading of Single layer to dual layer with anthracite and leca media can‘t show a significant affect in TOC removal...|$|R

Inspection/Maintenance Considerations <b>Media</b> <b>filters</b> may exhibit decreased effectiveness after a few years of operation, depending on the activities occurring in the drainage area. <b>Media</b> <b>filters</b> clog easily when subjected to high sediment loads. Sediment reducing pretreatment practices, such as vegetated buffer strips or vegetated swales, placed upstream of the filter should be maintained properly to reduce sediment loads into <b>filter.</b> <b>Media</b> <b>filters</b> can become a nuisance due to mosquito or midge breeding if not properly designed and maintained. Installations should dewater completely (recommended 72 hour or less residence time) to prevent creating mosquito and other vector habitats. Maintenance efforts will need to focus on basic housekeeping practices such as removal of debris accumulations and vegetation management (in <b>filter</b> <b>media)</b> to prevent clogs and/or pods of standing water.

40|$|A {{filtration}} system consisting of coarse <b>media</b> <b>filters</b> {{in series with}} standard dual <b>media</b> <b>filters</b> was proposed and evaluated as an alternative for direct filtration of high turbidity waters. The coarse <b>media</b> <b>filters</b> utilized a 3. 08 mm uniform sand with a media depth of 1. 32 m;The study was divided into three phases. The first phase involved the use of jar tests to determine optimum coagulants and approximate dosages for direct filtration. The jar test results {{were used in the}} second phase of study which involved laboratory pilot filter studies. The optimum alum dosage in the pilot plant studies was less than that determined in the jar test. Successful filter runs were possible with influent solids concentrations of 100 mg/l of kaolin or less. Headloss development (3 m maximum) limited the filter run lengths at kaolin concentrations of 25 and 50 mg/l. With 100 mg/l of kaolin, filter runs were terminated due to turbidity breakthrough. The third phase of the study involved a pilot plant field investigation using Des Moines river water as the raw water source. The chemical coagulants used in the laboratory did not produce acceptable results during the field study. The difference in chemical requirements was attributed {{to the nature of the}} raw water turbidity. The turbidity in the Des Moines river water was attributed mainly to the presence of diatoms;Particle deposition in the coarse <b>media</b> <b>filters</b> was recorded photographically during the laboratory filter runs.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to discover a new <b>filtering</b> <b>media,</b> specifically for pathogenic microorganism removal for the water treatment industry to produce safe drinking water. Granular bed filtration was used in this study as a healthy, simple and economical method to prevent the penetration of bacterial contamination. Alternative <b>filter</b> <b>media</b> from local source namely the burnt oil palm shell (BOPS) was also introduced. In order to determine the BOPS performance, the experimental programme and research approach used in this study were the design and construction of filtration unit, preparation of <b>filter</b> <b>media,</b> determination distribution size, morphology, porosity and specific gravity of <b>filter</b> <b>media</b> and also physical and biological analysis of filtrate water. In addition, total coliform and Escherichia coli tests of filtrate water in single-, dual- and tri-media filter were also investigated. Physical properties of BOPS were found to be equivalent or superior to those commercialized available granular <b>filter</b> <b>media</b> with ball-pan hardness of 97. 30 %. Granular <b>media</b> <b>filter</b> with mix <b>media</b> classes (which is a dual-media filtration) is also found to be a reliable surrogate for physical removal and biological barrier during filtration studies. Dual-media filtration BOPS/sand ES 1. 0 / 0. 5 mm is operating optimum condition of removing 80. 77 % of turbidity, 76. 23 % of suspended solid, 59. 45 % of colour and for bacteriological 0. 63 log and 0. 46 log of removal for total coliform and Escherichia coli. There was statistically significance difference between types of <b>media</b> <b>filter</b> to the removal of physical variable at 0. 05 level as determined by one-way anova for the turbidity % removal (p = 0. 000), suspended solid % removal (p = 0. 000) and colour % removal (p = 0. 000). Under one-factor analysis, there was a statistically significant difference for dual-media filtration for Escherichia coli removal (p = 0. 001), but not significant for single- and tri-media filter.
