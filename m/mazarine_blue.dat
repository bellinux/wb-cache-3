25|$|The area of {{the site}} is , and {{comprises}} {{a significant amount of}} heath; the northern and western parts are primarily of the dry heath Calluna vulgaris and Erica cinerea, while the low-lying parts of the south-east are mostly the damp or humid heath Erica tetralix and Molinia caerulea. Rare heathland species include the sand lizard (Lacerta agilis), smooth snake (Coronella austriaca), heath grasshopper (Chorthippus vagansand) and the Dartford warbler (Sylvia undata). Parley Common has an abundance of spider fauna—at least 147 species—which includes the very rare Ero aphana, Xysticus robustus—otherwise found in only a few places in the New Forest—and Gnaphosa lugubris. The site holds claim to a number of firsts: the smooth snake was first recorded in Britain in Parley Common in 1853; the <b>Mazarine</b> <b>blue</b> (Cyaniris semiargus)—now extinct in Britain—was first discovered here in the late nineteenth century; the moth Pachythelia villosella and the ringed carpet moth (Cleora cinctaria) were also first discovered here.|$|E

50|$|Recently, the <b>Mazarine</b> <b>blue's</b> {{numbers have}} been declining in its European range (particularly Scandinavia) and the reason remains unclear.|$|R

5000|$|A deep blue-purple colour {{has been}} called [...] "mazarine blue" [...] in {{commemoration}} of Cardinal Mazarin since the eighteenth century. There is a <b>Mazarine</b> <b>blue</b> butterfly, Cyaniris semiargus.|$|E
50|$|This {{species is}} rather similar to Cupido minimus, {{but in the}} {{underside}} hindwings of the <b>Mazarine</b> <b>blue</b> the black spot in space 6 and the two spots next to it form an obtuse angle, while in C. minimus they create an acute angle.|$|E
50|$|Under side: Breast, abdomen, {{and legs}} shining <b>mazarine</b> <b>blue,</b> inclining to green; {{on the former}} is a small red spot, close to the {{shoulders}} of the superior wings. The hinder legs have one joint white. Wings of the same colour as on the upper side.|$|E
50|$|These {{butterflies}} {{present a}} sexual dimorphism. The male Mazarine blue's wings are a deep blue {{with a heavy}} venation and are slightly larger in diameter than the female's. The upperside of the wings shows black borders and white fringes. The female <b>Mazarine</b> <b>blue</b> is brown. The underside of the wings is greyish or ocher, {{with a series of}} black spots surrounded by white and a blue scaling in the basal area.|$|E
50|$|Upper side: {{antennae}} {{black and}} pectinated. Tongue orange-coloured, and spiral. Head, thorax, and abdomen fine <b>mazarine</b> <b>blue.</b> Anterior wings dark mazarine, having a single white bar {{running from the}} middle of the anterior edge to the lower corner. A small part of the cilia at the tips is white, the rest being of the same colour as the wings. Posterior wings of the same colour as the superior, and immaculate, except the cilia, which is entirely white.|$|E
50|$|The Mazarine blue's {{population}} is distributed throughout continental Europe, even {{reaching into the}} Arctic Circle, temperate Asia, Mongolia, Morocco, the Middle East, and Morocco. There was a large native population in Britain {{in the early part}} of the 19th century, but it disappeared before the 20th century, though single vagrants have been spotted, and some estimates of British resident extinction are as late as 1906. In 2009, UNESCO was researching a possible British reintroduction of the <b>Mazarine</b> <b>blue</b> to Britain.|$|E
50|$|Underglaze {{painting}} requires {{considerably more}} skill than overglaze, since defects {{in the painting}} will often become visible only after the firing.During firing even refractory paints change color in the great heat. A light violet may turn into a dark blue, and a pale pink into a brown-crimson. The artist must anticipate these changes.With <b>mazarine</b> <b>blue</b> underglazing the decoration is typically fairly simple, using outline extensively and broad shading.The Japanese were known for their skill in depicting flowers, plants and birds in underglaze paintings that used the fewest possible brushstrokes.|$|E
