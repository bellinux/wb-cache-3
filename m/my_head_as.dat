500|$|When {{asked about}} how the film was developing, Rosenberg stated, [...] "It's incredible. Sometimes it's like seeing {{exactly what was going}} through my head when I first had that spark in <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>as</b> a kid. Jon Favreau's {{bringing}} his own talent and vision with the adaptation, {{but at the same time}} it remains true to what I was really trying to get at in the original story." ...|$|E
500|$|Howard Blake recalls: [...] "I {{went to a}} {{viewing and}} saw that the film was very profound, with a serious anti-war theme, but a certain amount of 'found' choral music had already been laid in by the editors...I {{explained}} that I loved the film and I thought the choral/orchestral music worked brilliantly but it was very big and rich and I felt a score would have to emerge from it and be very pure and expressive and quite small — and that I could only hear this in <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>as</b> done by strings only." ...|$|E
500|$|The title {{refers to}} the rabbits' destination, Watership Down, a hill {{in the north of}} Hampshire, England, near the area where Adams grew up. The story began as tales that Richard Adams told his young daughters Juliet and Rosamond during long car journeys. As he {{explained}} in 2007, he [...] "began telling the story of the rabbits... improvised off the top of <b>my</b> <b>head,</b> <b>as</b> we were driving along." [...] The daughters insisted he write it down—"they were very, very persistent". After some delay he began writing in the evenings and completed it 18 months later. The book is dedicated to the two girls.|$|E
6000|$|... "But indeed I do, my good sir," [...] says she; [...] "for between ourselves, <b>my</b> <b>head's</b> <b>as</b> bare as a cannon-ball--ask Fanny if it isn't. Such a fright as {{the poor}} thing got {{when she was a}} babby, and came upon me {{suddenly}} in my dressing-room without my wig!" ...|$|R
6000|$|They {{looked at}} him in astonishment and he smiled. [...] "The cache is there--somewhere about the neck you told him of--though I guess he'll have had it put where we won't find it easily. Anyhow, {{it will have to be}} found and, when it comes to bush work, <b>my</b> <b>head's</b> <b>as</b> good as Mappin's." ...|$|R

500|$|Beyoncé first {{considered}} {{the idea of}} creating a [...] "visual album" [...] in June 2013, when only three or four songs had been completed. Explaining her motivation, she said she would often connect images, childhood memories, emotions and fantasies to songs she {{was in the midst of}} composing, and that she [...] "wanted people to hear the songs with the story that's in <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>as</b> that's what makes it mine". She highlighted the [...] "immersive experience" [...] of Michael Jackson's Thriller (1982) as the principal influence for creating a body work that would mean [...] "people would hear things differently and [...] actually be able to see the whole vision of the album".|$|E
2500|$|Director Christopher Nolan said {{influences}} on Interstellar included the [...] "key touchstones" [...] {{of science fiction}} cinema: Metropolis (1927), [...] (1968), and Blade Runner (1982). About 2001, Nolan said: [...] "The movies you grow up with, the culture you absorb through the decades, become part of your expectations while watching a film. So you can't make any film in a vacuum. We're making a science-fiction film... You can't pretend 2001 doesn't exist when you're making Interstellar." [...] He also said that Star Wars (1977) and Alien (1979) influenced Interstellars production design: [...] "Those always stuck in <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>as</b> being how you need to approach science-fiction. It has to feel used—as used and as real as {{the world we live}} in." [...] Andrei Tarkovsky's The Mirror (1975) influenced [...] "elemental things in the story to do with wind and dust and water". Both films end with parents and children being reunited with seemingly impossible age differences.|$|E
2500|$|Prior to {{the role}} of Edward being cast for the 2008 Twilight film, Meyer opined that, {{although}} Edward was [...] "Indisputably the most difficult character to cast, [...] is also the one that I'm most passionately decided upon. The only actor I've ever seen who I think could come close to pulling off Edward Cullen is....(drumroll)....Henry Cavill." [...] When the film was optioned by Summit Entertainment in July 2007, Meyer stated that; [...] "The most disappointing thing for me is losing my perfect Edward", as Cavill was by then 24 years old, and thus too old to realistically fill the role. Meyer reported on her website that the four most popular fan suggestions for actors to play Edward were Hayden Christensen, Robert Pattinson, Orlando Bloom and Gerard Way. On 11 December 2007, it was announced that Pattinson, known for his portrayal of Cedric Diggory in the Harry Potter films, had been cast in the role. Erik Feig, Summit Entertainment’s President of Production, stated: [...] "It is always a challenge to find the right actor for a part that has lived so vividly in the imaginations of readers but we took the responsibility seriously and are confident, with Rob Pattinson, that we have found the perfect Edward for our Bella in Twilight." [...] Meyer stated that; [...] "I am ecstatic with Summit's choice for Edward. There are very few actors who can look both dangerous and beautiful at the same time, and even fewer who I can picture in <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>as</b> Edward. Robert Pattinson is going to be amazing." ...|$|E

60|$|I {{clutched}} it at last {{with both}} my hands, and threw back <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>as</b> {{a signal to}} Kea that all was right, and she might begin pulling.|$|E

6000|$|The wailing of an infant, and the gruff {{complaining}} of the nurse, were the next sounds that reached Farnaby in his hiding place. The nurse was grumbling to herself over the grievance {{of having been}} awakened from her sleep. [...] "After being up all night, a person wants rest. There's no rest for anybody in this house. <b>My</b> <b>head's</b> <b>as</b> heavy as lead, and every bone in me has got an ache in it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Those rascals {{attacked}} me!" [...] he muttered. [...] "They {{struck me}} over the head! I remember now! Oh, how <b>my</b> <b>head</b> spins,--just <b>as</b> if I was in a merry-go-round! I wonder----" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's all right," [...] {{said the}} Scarecrow. [...] "You are quite welcome to take <b>my</b> <b>head</b> off, <b>as</b> {{long as it}} will be a better one when you put it on again." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, I don't like it myself,' said Undy; 'but {{what the}} deuce am I to do? I {{might as well}} go to Tillietudlem without <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>as</b> without money.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Ah, {{he thought}} you could see <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>as</b> soon as he did. The closeter you be to the turf the more you see things. You look warm-like,'said Mr Dudeney.|$|E
60|$|His sensitiveness--that peculiar, apprehensive, detective {{faculty of}} his--felt {{in a moment}} the unspoken complaint--the scarce-thought reproach. He asked quietly if I was offended. I shook <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>as</b> {{implying}} a negative.|$|E
6000|$|He tenderly raised <b>my</b> <b>head,</b> and <b>as</b> I {{clung to}} him, kissed {{me in his}} old fatherly way again and again. What a light, now, on the {{protecting}} manner I had thought about! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "By no means, but {{it brought}} {{a world of}} notions into <b>my</b> <b>head,</b> such <b>as</b> I could not but set down. Now, Ethel, do oblige me, do write another, as we used in old times." ...|$|R

60|$|I {{approached}} the grave. I crossed {{once more the}} low stone stile, and bared <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>as</b> I touched the sacred ground. Sacred to gentleness and goodness, sacred to reverence and grief.|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] I said, {{and shook}} <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>as</b> though the dead eyes could note. [...] "Whatever it is, I don't {{understand}} yet. Perhaps I shall later--if you'll {{let me come}} again." ...|$|E
6000|$|Duncan's rage knew no bounds. He was mad {{enough to}} [...] "chew me up," [...] {{and with a}} loud exclamation he sprang after me, aiming a blow at <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>as</b> he did so.|$|E
6000|$|He laughed, {{but very}} softly, {{not in his}} usual terrific fashion, repeating the word [...] "murderer" [...] two or three times. Then with his great hand he lifted <b>my</b> <b>head</b> gently <b>as</b> a woman might, saying-- ...|$|R

60|$|This {{certainly}} had not a profitable appearance, and I shook <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>as</b> if I would imply {{that it would}} be difficult to lay by much accumulative capital from such a source of income.|$|E
60|$|How were we to communicate? Did he by {{any chance}} suppose that I had learnt the finger alphabet? I touched my fingers and shook <b>my</b> <b>head,</b> <b>as</b> a means of dissipating his delusion, if it existed.|$|E

6000|$|... 'I {{never meant}} you to {{discover}} it {{while they were}} here, nor would you, if you were not so careful of your complexion. Come, throw it at <b>my</b> <b>head</b> now, <b>as</b> you would have done naturally, and we shall have fair weather again!' ...|$|R
60|$|HARRY. I don't know. You've just {{knocked me}} off my feet. Like it? You're wonderful. In my wildest dreams I never saw you like that. You've brought all the East {{into the room}} with you. <b>My</b> <b>head</b> reels <b>as</b> though I were drunk.|$|R
