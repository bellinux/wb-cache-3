40|$|ObjectiveTo {{evaluate}} whether major levator ani muscle defects {{were associated with}} differences in postoperative vaginal support after primary surgery for pelvic organ prolapse (POP). MethodsA retrospective chart review of a subgroup of patients in the Organ Prolapse and Levator (OPAL) study. Of the 247 women recruited into OPAL, 107 underwent surgery for prolapse and were the cohort for the present analysis. <b>Major</b> levator ani <b>defects</b> were diagnosed when more than 50 % of the pubovisceral muscle was missing on MRI. Postoperative vaginal support was assessed via POPâ quantification system. Postoperative anatomic outcome was analyzed according to levator ani defect status, as determined by MRI. ResultsSupport of the anterior vaginal wall 2 cm above the hymen occurred among 62 % of women with normal levator ani muscles/minor defects and 35 % of those with <b>major</b> <b>defects.</b> Support of the anterior wall 1 cm above the hymen occurred among 32 % women with normal muscles /minor defects and 59 % of those with <b>major</b> <b>defects.</b> Levator ani defects were not associated with differences in postoperative apical/posterior vaginal support. ConclusionSix weeks after primary surgery for prolapse, women with normal levator ani muscles/minor defects had better anterior vaginal support than those with <b>major</b> levator <b>defects...</b>|$|R

40|$|The primary {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to study the effects of breed, age, season, and their interactions on semen morphological characteristics. The study was done on 329 bulls (271 Friesland and 58 Jersey) aged 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 84, 96 and> 96 months. The collection of semen was carried out using the artificial vagina method in all four seasons of the year. Spermatozoa were screened for the percentages normal sperm, percentage and total <b>major</b> <b>defects</b> such as knobbed acrosome, pyriform, abnormal lose head, dag defects, nuclear vacuole, degenerative heads, mid-piece reflexes, percentages and total minor defects such as normal lose heads, distal droplets, curled end-piece, lose acrosome. Statistical analyses of the data were done using the general linear model (GLM) procedure of the Statistical Analyses System (SAS, 1999). The results of the study indicate that breed did not significantly affected the percentage normal sperm and percentage <b>major</b> sperm <b>defects,</b> but significantly affected the percentage minor defects (P = 0. 01). The Least square means (LSM±SE) for the percentage normal sperm, <b>major</b> <b>defects</b> and minor defects in Friesland and Jersey bulls were 80. 6 ± 1. 06 %; versus 78. 9 ± 2. 31 %; 14. 8 ± 0. 90 % versus 15. 0 ± 2. 62 %, 5. 1 ± 0. 43 % versus 7. 6 ± 0. 94 %, respectively. The results obtained show that the prevalence of sperm defects that differed significantly between breeds was higher in Jersey bulls compared to Friesland bulls. The results of the study indicated the percentage of normal sperm to differ (P = 0. 01) with season. The percentage of normal sperm during the summer, autumn, winter and spring, were 72. 8 ± 1. 6 %, 79. 4 ± 2. 2 %, 82. 5 ± 2. 4 % and 84. 4 ± 2. 4 % respectively. Season also affected the percentage of <b>major</b> <b>defects</b> (P = 0. 01) and percentage of minor defects (P = 0. 03). The results demonstrate that even though there was a higher variation in sperm morphology with season, better sperm morphology was recorded in spring and winter than summer and autumn. Results also indicate the percentage of normal sperm (P = 0. 05) and <b>major</b> <b>defects</b> (P = 0. 01) to be affected significantly by age. On the other hand, the percentage of minor defects did not differ significantly with age. Bulls of 36 - 48 months of age showed better semen quality than bulls older than 72 months and bulls younger than 36 months. The percentage of <b>major</b> <b>defects,</b> particularly the incidence of <b>major</b> <b>defects</b> such as knobbed acrosomes, pyriforms, dag defects and broken flagella were significantly affected by the interaction between age and breed (P = 0. 05) and age and season (P = 0. 05). There was an increase in the susceptibility to these sperm defects in Jersey bulls with an increase in age, while no variation was observed in Friesland bulls. With age and season combined, young bulls recorded poor semen morphology during winter, while old bulls showed poor morphology during summer. In conclusion, the study suggested that breed, age and season and their interactions are important sources of variation in sperm morphology. For a successful AI programme, semen collection should be done at the age of 36 - 48 months for both breeds. It is therefore recommended that age, breed and season should be given urgent attention in any bull management system employed in South Africa in order to obtain the best semen quality.

40|$|NedTrain is the Netherlands Railway's {{subsidiary}} {{responsible for}} rolling stock maintenance. Train sets are {{brought in for}} short-term routine maintenance after set intervals of some 75 to 120 days. When a <b>major</b> <b>defect</b> occurs, train sets are allocated {{to one of the}} three maintenance depots and are diagnosed and repaired. Removal from active service causes large amounts of withdrawal of trains. In the traditional production concept, <b>major</b> <b>defects</b> could not be repaired on spot by the service organization. A lack of knowledge and equipment forced the National Fleet Control Centre to send the trains to the maintenance depots. This led to the insight that an upgrade of the service process could lead to a substantial improvement of the availability of the fleet. NedTrain re-modelled the traditional production concept and decided to invest 25 million euros in 4 additional Technical Centres, strategically placed on major nodes in the train service operations. In these new Centres, <b>major</b> <b>defects</b> are repaired during the night. Also, the routing of empty trains to the depots is prevented. The Utrecht Technical Centre was opened in Spring 2014; the other Centres will start operations shortly. This investment will lead to an improvement of the fleet availability by over thirty cars (worth 60 million euros), savings that can be cashed in the next round of ordering rolling stock. This paper describes both the preparation of the service processes and the first results, measured in the Utrecht-case...|$|R
40|$|Background It is {{not known}} whether infants {{conceived}} with use of intracytoplasmic sperm injection or in vitro fertilization have {{a higher risk of}} birth defects than infants conceived naturally. Methods We obtained data from three registries in Western Australia on births, births after assisted conception, and <b>major</b> birth <b>defects</b> in infants born between 1993 and 1997. We assessed the prevalence of <b>major</b> birth <b>defects</b> diagnosed by one year of age in infants conceived naturally or with use of intracytoplasmic sperm injection or in vitro fertilization. Results Twenty-six of the 301 infants conceived with intracytoplasmic sperm injection (8. 6 percent) and 75 of the 837 infants conceived with in vitro fertilization (9. 0 percent) had a <b>major</b> birth <b>defect</b> diagnosed by one year of age, as compared with 168 of the 4000 naturally conceived infants (4. 2 percent; P< 0. 001 for the comparison between either type of technology and natural conception). As compared with natural conception, the odds ratio for a <b>major</b> birth <b>defect</b> by one year of age, after adjustment for maternal age and parity, the sex of the infant, and correlation between siblings, was 2. 0 (95 percent confidence interval, 1. 3 to 3. 2) with intracytoplasmic sperm injection, and 2. 0 (95 percent confidence interval, 1. 5 to 2. 9) with in vitro fertilization. Infants conceived with use of assisted reproductive technology were more likely than naturally conceived infants to have multiple <b>major</b> <b>defects</b> and to have chromosomal and musculoskeletal defects. Conclusions Infants conceived with use of intracytoplasmic sperm injection or in vitro fertilization have twice as high a risk of a <b>major</b> birth <b>defect</b> as naturally conceived infants.
