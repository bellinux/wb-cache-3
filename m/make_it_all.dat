25|$|In the 2002 election, {{incumbent}} Republican Governor John Engler was term-limited and {{not able}} to run for re-election to a fourth term in office. The Republicans unified around Engler's Lieutenant Governor, Dick Posthumus. Meanwhile, Granholm faced a competitive primary against former U.S. Ambassador to Canada and former Governor James Blanchard and U.S. Representative and former House Minority Whip David E. Bonior. Blanchard had been defeated for re-election by Engler in 1990 and Bonior had resigned as Democratic Whip to run for Governor, his House seat having been completely redrawn in redistricting to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> but unwinnable for him.|$|E
25|$|On June 12, 1942, as {{district}} court judge Fee began presiding over the trial of Minoru Yasui, a native Oregonian of Japanese descent who was on trial for breaking curfew. The curfew had been imposed by the United States Army's General John L. DeWitt {{under the authority of}} President Franklin Roosevelt’s Executive Order 9066 that began the Japanese American internment after the bombing of Pearl Harbor. The curfew only applied to those of Japanese heritage, with Yasui being the first person to be arrested for violating the curfew. This case would <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> the way to the United States Supreme Court. The decision to take this trial to the Supreme Court made national news.|$|E

25|$|The Knicks {{were able}} to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> {{the way to the}} NBA finals during the 1969-70 NBA playoffs thanks to the great play of both Walt Frazier and star {{teammate}} Willis Reed. However, in game 5, Reed got a horrific leg injury, making him unable to walk for the next few days. With Reed out, chances of the Knicks winning the championship were slim. However, Reed somehow returned to the series, playing the first two minutes of game seven and scores the first two points of the game. Reed was simply in too much pain to continue to play for the last 46 minutes of the game, meaning that it was up to Frazier to lead New York to the victory. Frazier scored 36 points, had 19 assists, 7 rebounds, and 6 steals that game. His astounding performance is arguably the greatest game in NBA playoff history, as it was the only reason why New York was able to defeat the Lakers and win the championship. ESPN {{is one of the many}} websites to call Frazier’s incredible game the greatest game 7 performance ever.|$|E
25|$|The Colts {{once again}} began the 1998–99 season with Bert Templeton behind the bench. Daniel Tkaczuk once again led his team {{on and off}} the ice, Michael Henrich and first-year player Denis Shvidki added some scoring punch. Midway through the season the Colts decided to make some moves and bring in players that would {{hopefully}} put them {{at the top of the}} league. In a trade with the Toronto St. Michael's Majors, the Colts' management brought in one of the league's top scorers in Sheldon Keefe, along with Mike Jefferson, and Ryan Barnes. After that, the Colts had a young group of players that could possibly <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> the way to the Memorial Cup finals. At the end of the year the Colts had a 49–12–6–1 record for 105 points, and possessed two of the top scorers in the league. After defeating the Kingston Frontenacs 4 games to 1 in the conference quarter-finals, the Colts lost in seven games to the fourth-place Oshawa Generals, who had finished the season twenty points behind the Colts. Barrie goalie Brian Finley won the OHL Goaltender of the Year award as well as the Wayne Gretzky 99 Award as playoff MVP, and high-scoring forward Sheldon Keefe won the Emms Family Award as rookie of the year.|$|E

Babcock was recruited in Sydenham, Ontario and joined the 146th Battalion of the Canadian Expeditionary Force. He was then sent to Valcartier, Quebec. There Babcock underwent a physical, where it was discovered that he was underage. He was designated status A-4: physically fit, but underage. At the time, the minimum age for combat was eighteen.

However, according to Maxtone-Graham, the writing staff decided to cut it because [...] "it just never played anything but sad." [...] He added that the writers [...] "really wanted to address how [...] would feel" [...] but they [...] "could never pull it off without it just being sad."

500|$|As {{the player}} {{progresses}} through the game, the perspective changes from Will's, to Sarah's, to Mary's {{and finally to}} Harry's. Players passively select whether they see Sarah's or Mary's story first through a hidden choice (which room they walk into first early in the game). It becomes apparent that the story is not only based on Will's life, but also those of other characters and how they cope with his death. During Sarah's portrayal she says [...] "Let me set the scene..." [...] and during {{this part of the}} game the player clicks on objects that slowly turn the setting into a pub. After a few pieces of dialogue, the player clicks again to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> disappear. During Harry's section, the player clicks on objects that remind Harry of Will. In some parts of the game, the player clicks on other characters to make them move forward, suggesting the idea of snapshots based on their memories. Once the player has clicked on enough objects, a meter becomes full and that triggers the next part of the game.|$|E

Benioff concluded, [...] "If you're one of the lords of Westeros or one of her potential opponents in the wars to come and you get word of what happened here in Meereen, you have to be pretty nervous because this is an unprecedented threat. You've got a woman who has somehow formed an alliance where she has a Dothraki horde, a legion of Unsullied, she's got the mercenary army of the Second Sons, and she has three dragons who are now pretty close to full grown.

500|$|Reactions to {{the merger}} were widespread. Amid {{descriptions}} of the team as a [...] "super-team" [...] from at least one analyst were [...] manager Bjarne Riis' claims that he simply looked forward to defeating them. Cervélo co-founder and former [...] manager Gerard Vroomen saw the merger on a strictly business level, with neither side having sufficient resources to field a team at the level they would like, while cooperatively they would. Trek had been bike supplier for both teams in 2011, and funneling money they would normally spend on two teams into one, coupled with an expected reduction in support from the electronics company RadioShack, would <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> the simpler for them to back a top-level team. The merger also drew criticism, as the two sides' initial press releases describing it {{did not make it}} seem that they were in agreement over their perception of the merger and the newly combined entity. The fact that neither ridership nor lower-level management nor ousted sponsors seemed to know about the move at all ahead of time also drew criticism.|$|E

[...] Christie also thought that [...] "Connery has lost none of his charm and, if anything, is more appealing than ever as the stylish resolute hero." [...] David Robinson, writing in The Times also concentrated on Connery, saying that: [...] "Connery... is back, looking hardly a day older or thicker, and still outclassing every other exponent of the role, in the goodnatured throwaway with which he parries all the sex and violence on the way". For Robinson, the presence of Connery and Klaus Maria Brandauer as Maximillian Largo [...] "very nearly <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> worthwhile." [...] The reviewer for Time Out summed up Never Say Never Again saying [...] "The action's good, the photography excellent, the sets decent; but the real clincher {{is the fact that}} Bond is once more played by a man with the right stuff." ...|$|E
