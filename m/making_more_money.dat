Castellano became increasingly detached from family members, conducting all family business at his mansion. Castellano's announcement about Gambino and Bilotti further enraged the Dellacroce partisans.|$|E

If the two similar investments are not at face value offering the same interest rate return, the difference should conceptually be made up by changes in the exchange rate {{over the life of}} the investment. IRP basically provides the math to calculate a projected or implied forward rate of exchange. This calculated rate is not and cannot be considered a prediction or forecast, but rather is the arbitrage-free calculation for what the exchange rate is implied to be in order for it to be impossible to make a free profit by converting money to one currency, investing it for a period, then converting back and <b>making</b> <b>more</b> <b>money</b> than if a person had invested in the same opportunity in the original currency.|$|E

But instead of losing a vital source of income, former apple farmers downhill have switched to the production of highly profitable vegetables, supplying domestic markets far and wide. In fact, they're now <b>making</b> even <b>more</b> <b>money</b> then when they grew apples. Farmers uphill who now grow apples are enjoying the benefits of switching from subsistence crops, with significant improvements in living standards.

Carter deduces that when the police were unable to receive kickbacks from blackmail and the theft of negotiable bonds (facilitated by pressuring gay Wall Street customers), they decided to close the Stonewall Inn permanently. Two undercover policewomen and two undercover policemen had entered the bar earlier that evening to gather visual evidence, as the Public Morals Squad waited outside for the signal. Once inside, they called for backup from the Sixth Precinct using the bar's pay telephone. The music was turned off and the main lights were turned on.

500|$|The {{day after}} the election, Romney {{returned}} to Bain Capital, but the loss had a lasting effect; he told his brother, [...] "I never want to run for something again unless I can win." [...] When his father died in 1995, Mitt donated his inheritance to BYU's George W. Romney Institute of Public Management. He also became vice-chair of the Board of the Points of Light Foundation, which had embraced his father's National Volunteer Center. Romney felt restless as the decade neared a close; the goal of simply <b>making</b> <b>more</b> <b>money</b> held little attraction for him. Although no longer in a local leadership position in his church, he still taught Sunday School. During the long and controversial approval and construction process for the $30million Mormon temple in Belmont, he feared that, as a political figure who had opposed Kennedy, he would become {{a focal point for}} opposition to the structure. He thus kept to a limited, behind-the-scenes role in attempts to ease tensions between the church and local residents.|$|E
500|$|It {{was this}} concept which {{intrigued}} Madonna, {{while she was}} developing her third studio album True Blue (1986). She said, [...] "I hate it when people do master mixes of my records. I don't want to hear my songs changed like that. I don't know that I like it, people screwing with my records. The jury is out on it for me. But the fans like it, and really, this one was for the fans, for {{the kids in the}} clubs who wanted to hear these songs in a fresh new way." [...] She went to Warner with the idea of releasing her songs by remixing them in a complete dance tune. From Warner's point of view, the rise of remix was a commercial boon, because it meant <b>making</b> <b>more</b> <b>money</b> out of the same piece of music. Instead of paying Madonna to go to studio and record different tracks, they found that allowing her to record the same tracks in different formats was much less costly. Hence they decided to release the album, but gave full freedom to Madonna to choose the producers with whom she wanted to develop the remixes.|$|E

500|$|The case {{initially}} {{appeared to}} be going badly for Marshall-Hall. An inept cross-examination on his part weakened his argument, and an illness made him irritable and short-tempered. On {{the advice of his}} clerk, he asked Birkett to make the closing address before the court, which turned the mood of the courtroom completely and an initially hostile jury decided to disregard the agreement of Mr. Dennistoun to pay ancillary relief to his former wife. Birkett's performance made the front pages of many evening newspapers, including The Daily Mail which described Birkett as [...] "the greatest legal discovery of the year" [...] and called his speech [...] "a brilliant piece of advocacy". His work for this case and the newspaper coverage of it brought him to the attention of many London solicitors, and led to him earning £8,000 in the first seven months of 1925. In that year he made £12,000 overall, an amount which rose to £16,500 in 1926 and peaked in 1929 when he earned £33,500.

40|$|This study empirically {{examines}} the popularized influence of underwater stock options on employee job search behavior. In a multi-industry sample of executives {{we find a}} positive relationship between the percentage of employee stock options that are underwater and job search frequency. In addition, we find that this relationship is moderated by important situational and individual difference variables. In particular, symbolic attributions toward money moderated participant’s sensitivity to underwater options. Participants <b>making</b> <b>more</b> positive <b>money</b> attributions (e. g., money represents achievement, status, and strong work ethic) were {{more likely to engage in}} search when facing underwater options. Conversely, we found no moderating effect for perceived financial independence.
