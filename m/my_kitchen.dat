500|$|Although MacFarlane enjoyed {{working at}} Hanna-Barbera, {{he felt his}} real calling was for prime-time animation, which would allow a much edgier style of humor. He first pitched Family Guy to Fox during his tenure at Hanna-Barbera. A {{development}} executive for Hanna-Barbera, {{who was trying to}} get back into the prime-time business at the time, introduced MacFarlane to Leslie Kolins and Mike Darnell, heads of the alternative comedy department at Fox. After the success of King of the Hill in 1997, MacFarlane called Kolins once more to ask about a possible second pitch for the series. The company offered the young writer a strange deal: Fox gave him a budget of US$50,000 to produce a pilot that could lead to a series (most episodes of animated prime-time productions cost at least US$1 million). Recalling the experience in an interview with The New York Times, MacFarlane stated, [...] "I spent about six months with no sleep and no life, just drawing like crazy in <b>my</b> <b>kitchen</b> and doing this pilot".|$|E
500|$|For {{the first}} time in any of his works {{involving}} amateurs, Britten envisaged a large complement of child performers among his orchestral forces, led by what Graham described as [...] "the professional stiffening" [...] of a piano duet, string quintet (two violins, viola, cello and bass), recorder and a timpanist. The young musicians play a variety of instruments, including a full string ensemble with each section led {{by a member of the}} professional string quintet. The violins are further divided into parts of different levels of difficulty, from the simplest (mostly playing open strings) to those able to play in third position. The recorders should be led by an accomplished soloist able to flutter-tongue; bugles, played in the original production by boys from a local school band, are played as the children representing animals march into the ark, and at the climax of the opera. The child percussionists, led by a professional timpanist, play various exotic and invented percussion instruments: the score itself specifies sandpaper ("two pieces of sandpaper attached to blocks of wood and rubbed together"), and [...] "Slung Mugs", the latter used to represent the first drops of rain. Britten originally had the idea of striking teacups with a spoon, but having failed to make this work, he sought Imogen Holst's advice. She recalled that [...] "by great good fortune I had once had to teach Women's Institute percussion groups during a wartime 'social half hour', so I was able to take him into <b>my</b> <b>kitchen</b> and show him how a row of china mugs hanging on a length of string could be hit with a large wooden spoon.|$|E
