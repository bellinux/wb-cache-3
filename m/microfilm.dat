40|$|This paper aims {{to analyze}} the process of {{documents}} <b>microfilming</b> and its applicability in the Federal University of Santa Catarina. We aimed to identify the differences and similarities {{between theory and practice}} required during the <b>microfilming</b> process. This is a qualitative research, as we use a case study as the main method of investigation, which focuses on elucidating the occasional actions in complex everyday situations for treatment through experiments or data collection. Through a questionnaire we found the need for a Disposal Agreement and also a File System. We also presented the procedures adopted during the <b>microfilming</b> process, from the selection of documents to be <b>microfilmed</b> to storage, also standing out the comparison between the hybrid system and <b>microfilming</b> exposing the legality of the two systems, their advantages and disadvantages. However, we concluded that only with the implementation of a file system the management of all files will be possible...|$|R

In 2010 a ten-year programme of digitisation of the newspaper archives with commercial partner DC Thomson subsidiary Brightsolid began, and the British Newspaper Archive was launched in November 2011. A dedicated newspaper reading room opened at St Pancras in April 2014, including facilities for consulting microfilmed and digital materials, and, where no surrogate exists, hard-copy material retrieved from Boston Spa.|$|E
5|$|Designed {{and built}} by the Public Works Department, the new red-bricked {{building}} was officially opened and christened as the National Library on 12 November 1960 by the President of Singapore, Yusof bin Ishak. The architecture was said to reflect the red-brick epoch of British architecture in the 1950s. Hedwig Anuar was appointed the first Singaporean Director of the National Library in April 1960 and served until June 1961. Aside from its extensive English collection, the library also made Chinese, Malay and Tamil books available for loan. Occupying a total floor area of 10,242 square metres, the library included reading sections for adults and children, a <b>microfilm</b> unit and a lecture hall.|$|E
40|$|After {{researching the}} current applications, problems, and {{evaluation}} techniques of planetary <b>microfilming</b> systems, the authors designed and constructed a standard Planetary <b>Microfilming</b> camera Target Array (PMTA) that essentially satisfied three criteria, i. e. 1) inexpensive to produce, 2) simple to use, and 3) satisfies testing criteria for both <b>microfilming</b> equipment manufacture and user. Ten evaluation parameters were incorporated in two targets PMTA-I and PMTA-II. PMTA-I includes tests for 1) resolution, 2) readability of printed matter, 3) reduction ratio, 4) exposure and processing, 5) full field visual distortion, and finally 6) corner visual distortion. PMTA-II {{was designed to}} evaluate, 7) quatitative distortion, 8) continous tone, 9) evenness of illumination, and 10) alignment of <b>microfilming</b> system...|$|R

5|$|In {{her book}} In the Land of Lady White Blood: Southern Thailand and the Meaning of History, Lorraine Gesick {{discussed}} a manuscript from Wat Pha Kho in Sathing Phra. The manuscript (which in Gesick's opinion {{dates from the}} late 17th century) consists mainly of an illustrated map about ten metres long that depicts Sultan Sulaiman's forts at Khao Daeng. A <b>microfilm</b> of this manuscript, made by American historian David Wyatt, is kept at the Cornell University Library.|$|E
5|$|Snake {{continues}} his mission, destroying the facility and the Shagohod tank, while engaging Volgin, who is {{killed by a}} bolt of lightning during the battle. Snake and EVA travel to a lake, where a WIG ground effect vehicle is hidden. Before they use it to escape the region, Snake confronts his old mentor, The Boss, whom he must assassinate to complete his mission. After an emotional battle, The Boss gives Snake the <b>microfilm</b> containing the location of the Philosopher's Legacy, and requests Snake to kill her. Soon after, Snake overcomes his feelings and kills The Boss, emerging victorious. He and EVA escape to Alaska, and spend the night together as they make love. During the night, EVA disappears with the <b>microfilm,</b> and leaves behind a tape revealing herself to be a Chinese spy sent to steal the Philosopher's Legacy for China. The tape continues, and EVA reveals that The Boss did not defect to the Soviet Union; rather, she was under orders to pretend to defect so she could infiltrate Volgin's ranks and find the location of the Legacy, which could be brought back to America. The final part of her mission was to sacrifice her honor and die at the hands of Snake, under the guise of a traitor, to prove the U.S.'s innocence in Volgin's nuclear attack during the Virtuous Mission.|$|E
5|$|When Häyhänen {{announced}} {{himself at}} the embassy on 4 May, he appeared drunk. The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) officials at the Paris embassy did not find Häyhänen's story credible. They weren't convinced he might actually be a Russian spy until he produced a hollow Finnish 5-mark coin. Upon opening the coin a square of <b>microfilm</b> was revealed. On May 11, the CIA returned him to the United States and handed {{him over to the}} FBI. As a member of a Soviet spy ring operating on American soil, Häyhänen came under the FBI's jurisdiction and they began verifying his story.|$|E

5|$|After {{the credits}} roll, Ocelot is heard {{talking to the}} KGB Chief Director over the telephone. After {{suggesting}} that the KGB use the knowledge of both the Virtuous Mission and Operation Snake Eater to blackmail the United States during future negotiations, he then calls another, unidentified man. Ocelot informs him that the <b>microfilm</b> stolen by EVA was a fake and {{that half of the}} Philosopher's Legacy is now in America's hands, with the other half held by the KGB. It transpires that Ocelot has been triple-crossing everyone from the very beginning. He then reveals that he is in fact ADAM, that he is talking to the director of the CIA, and that he has been working for the said agency all this time.|$|E

On {{the way to}} his briefing, Bond escapes an ambush by Soviet agents in Austria, killing their leader during a downhill ski chase. The plans for a highly advanced submarine tracking system are being offered in Egypt. There, he encounters Major Anya Amasova—KGB agent Triple X—his rival to recover the <b>microfilm</b> plans. They travel across Egypt together, encountering Jaws – a tall assassin with razor sharp steel teeth – along the way. Bond and Amasova reluctantly join forces after a truce is agreed by their respective British and Soviet superiors. They identify the person responsible for the thefts as the shipping tycoon and scientist Karl Stromberg.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to giving the originals of his diaries to USU, Arrington had given <b>microfilm</b> of his diary from his boyhood until 1982 to the Church Archives, {{but with the}} condition that his diaries not be read until 25 years after his death. Shortly after Arrington's death, a general authority asked Arrington's daughter, Susan Madsen, to excise 40 parts of her father's diary. By making this request, the LDS Church representatives revealed that they read Arrington's journals without proper permission. George Daines, the Arrington family attorney, explained that the family had grounds to take legal action against the LDS Church and the negotiations were quickly over. Arrington's family agreed to give the LDS Church some of the materials, including minutes to meetings with the Twelve Apostles and materials related to the temple ceremony.|$|E

Leamus, expecting the request, hands over a redacted <b>microfilm</b> for Haley to see. Scully discovers that the biological weapon was engineered by the U.S. government, and concludes that someone purposely sent Mulder on a suicide mission.

Meanwhile, Mulder joins the New Spartans as they infiltrate the bank and spray the money with the pathogen.|$|E
5|$|The Library {{holds an}} almost {{complete}} collection of British and Irish newspapers since 1840. This {{is partly because}} of the legal deposit legislation of 1869, which required newspapers to supply a copy of each edition of a newspaper to the library. London editions of national daily and Sunday newspapers are complete back to 1801. In total the collection consists of 660,000 bound volumes and 370,000 reels of <b>microfilm</b> containing tens of millions of newspapers with 52,000 titles on 45km of shelves. From earlier dates, the collections include the Thomason Tracts, comprising 7,200 17th-century newspapers, and the Burney Collection, featuring nearly 1 million pages of newspapers from the late 18th and early 19th centuries. The section also holds extensive collections of non-British newspapers, in numerous languages.|$|E
5|$|He {{is always}} there, he knows everything. He is infallible but always failing. When the boys rescue him, he is {{typically}} emaciated, dehydrated, semi-conscious, delirious; they must succor him with candy bars and water. He {{can take on}} any shape, but reveals his identity within moments of doing so. He never discusses a case except the one he's working on in a given novel, so that his legendary close-mouthedness turns to garrulousness when a Hardy Boys novel begins, which is of course {{the only time we}} ever get to see him. All the same, he only discusses the case in enough detail to mislead his sons and put them in mortal danger. He has systems of information and data-gathering that put the FBI to shame, yet he is always losing his case notes, his ciphers, his <b>microfilm,</b> or some other valuable clue, usually by leaving it in his extra pair of pants, meaning that the Boys have to drive to Canada or Florida or somewhere to retrieve it. I suppose he isn't mysterious at all; he simply embodies what many think of their own fathers: utterly powerful, contemptibly inept.|$|E
