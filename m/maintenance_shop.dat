50|$|Portions of {{the rail}} bed can still be seen running east-west at the {{southern}} end of the town of Penney Farms, Florida, which was a project of J. C. Penney. It is assumed that the railroad made a stop in Penney Farms because the tracks ran adjacent to a series of buildings that became the <b>maintenance</b> <b>shops</b> of Foremost Dairy of Jacksonville, which purchased much of Penney's timber and farm lands. The <b>maintenance</b> <b>shops</b> have since been removed. Michael M. Maguire, 8-28-10.|$|R

2500|$|TriMet's light-rail {{maintenance}} shops feature additional equipment, as TriMet's railcar fleet is {{many times}} larger, so streetcars were operated along the MAX tracks to the light-rail workshops at Ruby Junction (near the Ruby Junction/East 197th Avenue {{station on the}} Blue Line) for maintenance work on their trucks, a few times. However, because the streetcar has a limited top speed of about [...] (compared with [...] for MAX trains) and because of differences in the signalling systems, streetcar movements to the Ruby Junction facility had to take place very late at night, a time when TriMet schedules maintenance on the MAX line. Portland Streetcar managers therefore decided, early on, simply to remove streetcar components needing repair at a TriMet facility and transport them there by road, avoiding the need to schedule time on the MAX line to move a streetcar. Ultimately, {{as part of the}} eastside expansion, the necessary equipment is planned to be purchased and installed at the streetcar <b>maintenance</b> <b>shop,</b> eliminating the need to send any streetcar components to Ruby Junction or to Elmonica (another MAX maintenance facility) for repair.|$|E
