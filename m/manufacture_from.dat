5|$|Until {{the late}} nineteenth century, sugar was {{purchased}} in loaves, {{which had to be}} cut using implements called sugar nips. In later years, granulated sugar was more usually sold in bags. Sugar cubes were produced in the nineteenth century. The first inventor of a process to make sugar in cube form was the Moravian Jakub Kryštof Rad, director of a sugar company in Dačice. He began sugar cube production after being granted a five-year patent for the process on January 23, 1843. Henry Tate of Tate & Lyle was another early manufacturer of sugar cubes at his refineries in Liverpool and London. Tate purchased a patent for sugar cube <b>manufacture</b> <b>from</b> German Eugen Langen, who in 1872 had invented a different method of processing of sugar cubes.|$|E

Halifax is known for Mackintosh's chocolate and toffee products including Rolo and Quality Street. The Halifax Bank was also founded and still headquartered in Halifax.

2500|$|The {{history of}} {{glassware}} {{dates back to}} the Phoenicians who fused obsidian together in campfires making the first glassware. [...] Glassware evolved as other ancient civilizations including the Syrians, Egyptians, and Romans refined the art glassmaking. [...] The art of glassmaking in 16th century Venice was refined to the point intricate shapes could be made. [...] Some time {{before the turn of the}} 19th century laboratory glass <b>manufacture</b> <b>from</b> soda lime started in Germany. [...] Most laboratory glassware was manufactured in Germany up until the start of World War I. [...] During World War I, the supply of laboratory glassware to the United States was cut off.|$|E

2500|$|Between 1504 and 1507, Portuguese traders {{imported}} 287,813 manillas from Portugal into Guinea via {{the trading}} station of São Jorge da Mina.

Trader and traveler accounts are both plentiful and specific as to names and relative values, but no drawings or detailed descriptions seem to have survived which could link these accounts to specific manilla types found today. The metals preferred were originally copper, then brass at {{about the end of the}} 15th century and finally bronze in about 1630.|$|E

[...] But [...] "Additional cars having similar performance capabilities and fitting in with the overall concept of the class will be considered for inclusion in the TA3 class". Unlike TA4 cars, the current rules allow them to [...] "...compete at a higher level of preparation." [...] Standard body appearance must be maintained, including the OEM grille and badge. As with TA4, Tube frames are not allowed, and roll cages are mandatory. Some engines are required to have restrictor plates, for the purpose of equalizing performance. Minimum Vehicle Base Weights may be changed for the same purpose.|$|E
2500|$|Even craft-based {{military}} technologies {{were not}} generally produced by military funding. [...] Instead, craftsmen and inventors developed weapons and military tools independently and actively sought {{the interest of}} military patrons afterward. [...] Following the rise of engineering as a profession in the 18th century, governments and military leaders did try to harness the methods of both science and engineering for more specific ends, but frequently without success. [...] In the decades {{leading up to the}} French Revolution, French artillery officers were often trained as engineers, and military leaders from this mathematical tradition attempted to transform the process of weapons <b>manufacture</b> <b>from</b> a craft-based enterprise to an organized and standardized system based on engineering principles and interchangeable parts (pre-dating the work of Eli Whitney in the U.S.). [...] During the Revolution, even natural scientists participated directly, attempting to create “weapons more powerful than any we possess” to aid the cause of the new French Republic, though there were no means for the revolutionary army to fund such work. [...] Each of these efforts, however, was ultimately unsuccessful in producing militarily useful results. [...] A slightly different outcome came from the longitude prize of the 18th century, offered by the British government for an accurate method of determining a ship’s longitude at sea (essential for the safe navigation of the powerful British navy): intended to promote—and financially reward—a scientific solution, it was instead won by a scientific outsider, the clockmaker John Harrison. [...] However, the naval utility of astronomy did help increase the number of capable astronomers and focus research on developing more powerful and versatile instruments.|$|E

60|$|He {{spends a}} vast deal of time[82] in an {{endeavor}} {{to prove that}} Ireland is able to bear greater impositions. He is of opinion, that the poverty of the lower class of people there is, in a great measure, owing to a want of judicious taxes; that a land-tax will enrich her tenants; that taxes are paid in England which are not paid there; that the colony trade is increased above 100,000l. since the peace; that she ought to have further indulgence in that trade; and ought to have further privileges in the woollen <b>manufacture.</b> <b>From</b> these premises, of what she has, what she has not, and what she ought to have, he infers that Ireland will contribute 100,000l. towards the extraordinaries of the American establishment.|$|E
60|$|There they were, sure enough, a {{party of}} some sixteen or {{eighteen}} of the real aborigines.

60|$|He seated {{himself in}} {{the stern of the}} boat with a paddle. There was no {{occasion}} to steer, for it mattered in no way whether the boat drove down the river bow or stern first; but at present it was an amusement to keep her straight with an occasional stroke with the paddle. Luka sat on the floorboards {{at the bottom of the}} boat, and set himself to work to <b>manufacture</b> <b>from</b> the squirrels' skins two fur caps of the same pattern as those worn by the Ostjaks. Godfrey had asked him to do so in order that they might be taken for members of that tribe by anyone looking at them from the villages on the banks. As to the dress it did not signify, as many of the more settled Ostjaks had adopted the Russian costume. Godfrey intended to fish as they drifted along, but they had at present at least as much fish on board as they could consume while it was good. Luka, as he worked, sang a lugubrious native ditty, while with his knife he trimmed the skins into shape. Having done this he proceeded to sew them together with great skill.|$|E
