25|$|As {{a result}} of the {{implementation}} of the CDTA in accordance with KPCS, in 2012 Census reported only $462.1million worth of rough diamonds, a 28.5% decrease from the 2011 report of $646.7 million. The Census Bureau in 2012 reported that the United States received rough diamond imports from approximately 24 KP participants including Liberia, Mexico, Democratic Republic of Congo, India, Israel, and Japan. Within the data reports of imports from countries such as these the carat weight and value of the diamonds are also included. To continue to provide the most accurate data the Census compares and checks its <b>monthly</b> <b>data</b> with data it receives from USKPA to ensure that there are no discrepancies between imports and exports.|$|E
25|$|In {{most parts}} of the world, {{medication}} is dispensed in blister packaging. It is relatively simple to equip blister packages with printed conductive trace grids. These grids are then connected to an electronic module. The electronic monitor records the time a trace has been broken and can then transmit this information to an NFC smart phone or even be GSM enabled to transmit the information immediately if a suitable data network is available. A more reasonable solution at the moment would be to connect the package to a hub, handheld device, tablet or smart watch via low power Bluetooth. In this case the package data would be sent whenever the medication blister is in close proximity to the bluetooth receiver. It avoids the huge effort required to equip every single blister with a SIM module and expensive <b>monthly</b> <b>data</b> subscription.|$|E

We find that the use of <b>monthly</b> holdings <b>data</b> rather than quarterly holdings data or, in the case of tournament behavior, holdings <b>data</b> rather than <b>monthly</b> return <b>data,</b> change, and in some cases reverse, previous results.
