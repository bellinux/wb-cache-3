40|$|We {{employed}} {{frequency domain}} interferometry (FDI) {{for use as}} a <b>medical</b> <b>acoustic</b> imager to detect multiple targets with high range resolution. The phase of each frequency component of an echo varies with the frequency, and target intervals can be estimated from the phase variance. This processing technique is generally used in radar imaging. When the interference within a range gate is coherent, the cross correlation between the desired signal and the coherent interference signal is nonzero. The Capon method works under the guiding principle that output power minimization cancels the desired signal with a coherent interference signal. Therefore, we utilize frequency averaging to suppress the correlation of the coherent interference. The results of computational simulations using a pseudoecho signal show that the Capon method with adaptive frequency averaging (AFA) provides a higher range resolution than a conventional method. These techniques were experimentally investigated and we confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed method of processing by FDI...|$|R

In a FDA 510 (k) non-inferiority study, the Lung Flute was compared to a FDA cleared OPEP device (Acapella®) in a eight-week, randomized, controlled, two arm open-label parallel study in 40 COPD patients with chronic bronchitis. Both devices improved COPD symptoms and disease specific health status, with trends favoring the Lung Flute (Data on file, <b>Medical</b> <b>Acoustics).</b> We wanted to confirm and explore further the therapeutic use of the Lung Flute in COPD in a longer trial and compare it to usual care. This report describes the results of such a 26 week study where patients were randomized to the Lung Flute or usual care.

Briefly, after blowing nose and rinsing mouth to minimize contamination of squamous cells from postnasal drip and saliva, the participants placed lips around mouthpiece. They blew out fast and hard through Lung Flute. After taking a quick breath, the participants blew out again, and then coughed up sputum into a sterile container. The samples were processed on ice in four volumes of 0.1 % dithiothreitol (Sigma-Aldrich Corporation, Saint Louis, MO), and the mixture was vortexed for 15  min. A double volume of a phosphate-buffered saline solution was then added, and the mixture was briefly vortexed. After filtration through two layers of a sterile gauze to remove mucous and debris, sputum was centrifuged for 10  min at 800  g. The cell pellet was resuspended in a phosphate-buffered saline solution. A differential cell count was performed using slides stained with the May-Grünwald-Giemsa method. The sputum specimens were of low respiratory origin {{as indicated by the}} presence of less than 4 % oral squamous cells.

30|$|Mucus {{hypersecretion}} and impaired mucociliary clearance is {{prevalent in}} many patients with COPD, and contributes {{significantly to the}} morbidity and mortality of this disease [1],[2]. In spite {{of the need for}} efficacious, convenient and safe treatment for mucus hypersecretion, current choices are few with limited data to support their efficacy in COPD [3],[4]. The Lung Flute is a new small self-powered audio device that has been classified by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to the family of Oscillatory Positive Expiratory Pressure (OPEP) devices, which includes the Flutter® and the Acapella® [5],[6]. However, unlike traditional OPEP devices that use oscillatory back pressure, the Lung Flute has a unique mechanism of action based on acoustic energy. When blown in to with an exhalation vigorous enough to make the reed oscillate, the Lung Flute generates a sound wave of 16 to 22 Hz with an output of 110 to 115 dB using 2.5 cms H 2 O of pressure. This sound wave has the ability to travel down the tracheobronchial tree and vibrate tracheobronchial secretions. This vibration enhances mucociliary clearance of the lower respiratory tract thereby resulting in the induction of sputum. This functionality of the Lung Flute has been applied to sputum induction for diagnostic testing and for the enhancement of mucus clearance from the lower airways (Data on file, <b>Medical</b> <b>Acoustics)</b> [7],[8]. The Lung Flute is currently FDA approved and available for patient use by a health care provider prescription for both these purposes.|$|E

40|$|Finite element {{models for}} the {{solution}} of underwater acoustics problems Abstract Acoustic waves are used in SONAR systems for the detection and classification of objects which may be swimming in the water column, proud on the seafloor, or buried below the sediment. In some applications, such as low frequency detection and classification of struc-turally complex objects immersed in a fluid, signal pro-cessing techniques must be aided by a-priori model based knowledge of the target echo. Because objects of inter-est in practical applications have a complex geometry and a detailed internal structure, consisting of elastic ma-terials and fluid partitions, mathematical techniques ca-pable of dealing with generic 3 -D geometries, and ca-pable of coupling different physical domains (i. e. the solid and the fluid domains) must be used. For these rea-sons, the Finite Element (FE) Method is the technique of choice for many researchers in the field. A FEMlab ap-plication for computing the scattering from undersea tar-gets is presented, and guidelines for the discretization of the computational domain {{in the presence of}} structure-borne guided elastic waves are given. It is found that the guided elastic waves impose strict requirements on the meshing of the elastic structure and of the surround-ing water volume. The presented results are relevant also to other areas of acoustics, where one is interested in modeling scattering or radiation from elastic structures and within elastic structures. Such areas include non de-structive testing, vehicle noise prediction and control, acoustic transducer design, MEMS, architectural acous-tics, and <b>medical</b> <b>acoustics...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{ability of}} the Lorentz force to link a {{mechanical}} displacement to an electrical current presents a strong interest for <b>medical</b> <b>acoustics,</b> and three applications were studied in this thesis. In {{the first part of}} this work, a hydrophone was developed for mapping the particle velocity of an acoustic field. This hydrophone was constructed using a thin copper wire and an external magnetic field. A model was elaborated to determine the relationship between the acoustic pressure and the measured electrical current, which is induced by Lorentz force when the wire vibrates in the acoustic field of an ultrasound transducer. The built prototype was characterized and its spatial resolution, frequency response, sensitivity, robustness and directivity response were investigated. An imaging method called Lorentz Force Electrical Impedance Tomography was also studied. In this method, a biological tissue is vibrated by ultrasound in a magnetic field, which induces an electrical current by Lorentz force. The electrical impedance of the tissue can be deduced from the measurement of the current. This technique was applied for imaging a gelatin phantom, a beef muscle sample, and a thermal lesion in a chicken breast sample. This showed the method may be useful for providing additional contrast to conventional ultrasound imaging. Finally, this thesis demonstrated that shear waves can be generated in soft tissues using Lorentz force. This work was performed by applying an electrical current with two electrodes in a soft solid placed in a magnetic field. Shear waves were observed in gelatin phantom and liver sample. The speed of the shear waves were used to compute elasticity and their source to map the electrical conductivity of the samples. Comment: PhD thesis, in Frenc...|$|E

40|$|A {{computational}} method is presented which efficiently segments digital grayscale images by directly applying the Q-state Ising (or Potts) model. Since the Potts model was first proposed in 1952, physicists have studied lattice models to gain deep insights into magnetism and other disordered systems. For some time, researchers {{have realized that}} digital images may be modeled {{in much the same}} way as these physical systems (i. e., as a square lattice of numerical values). A major drawback in using Potts model methods for image segmentation is that, with conventional methods, it processes in exponential time. Advances have been made via certain approximations to reduce the segmentation process to power-law time. However, in many applications (such as for sonar imagery), real-time processing requires much greater efficiency. This article contains a description of an energy minimization technique that applies four Potts (Q-Ising) models directly to the image and processes in linear time. The result is analogous to partitioning the system into regions of four classes of magnetism.

Introduction: To date, there are few in vivo investigations in humans on the exact positioning of injectable hyaluronic acid fillers, and severe complications such as hematoma and thromboembolism are rarely addressed. Materials and methods: There were nine female patients investigated in this pilot study. All of them were periorally injected with hyaluronic acid. The exact product, amount, and locations, {{as well as the}} injection techniques, were recorded and compared. Before, immediately after, and 18 days after injection, photo documentation as well as high-resolution ultrasonography and optical coherence tomography of the lip surface were performed. Results: Minor bruising occurred, which resolved within 7 to 9 days. On day 18, no more hemorrhage could be detected. Injected material distributed well in the tissue, and no embolism or thrombosis occurred. However, the injected material came close (up to 1 mm) to important structures such as blood vessels. Lip wrinkles improved, and the lip surface was smoother and more even. Conclusion: Hyaluronic acid injections can improve aesthetics and reduce fine wrinkles of the lips. In the patients investigated in this study, compression of structures such as vessels and nerve fibers did not occur, nor did any severe complications result from injection. However, one must be aware of serious complications (eg, hematoma, thromboembolism) and the important anatomic structures (eg, orbicularis oris muscle, vessels, and nerves), and injecting physicians should always have hyaluronidase as a rescue medication at hand. Summary: Hyaluronic acid is a suitable tool for lip augmentation and reduction of fine lines; however, one must be aware of anatomic structures when injecting filler material into the lips and perioral area, and be familiar with the injection techniques.

Several decades numerous innovations made predominantly over chestpiece some had drawbacks. Dr Littman introduced teaching stethoscope with two headset and researcher utilized as prior art. Experimental research method {{used and the}} study aimed to determine accuracy and measurement of speed of the device in terms of systolic and diastolic blood pressure and acceptability of user. The subjects were 19 clients and 27 nursing students, government /private registered nurses. The device are comparable to single binaural stethoscope in accuracy performance; speed of sound, former is slightly higher than the latter but still considered as normal; the device are acceptable to users; the utility model have {{no significant difference in}} accuracy performance and speed measurements of systolic and diastolic. The utility model may be tried in any acoustic activities and may be pilot tested to the Universities animal science courses, veterinary medicine other Colleges of Nursing and all health allied courses...|$|R
40|$|In {{medical field}} any disease can be {{primarily}} accessed using an <b>acoustic</b> <b>medical</b> device {{that is a}} Stethoscope. The wireless electronic stethoscope can be designed by using microcontroller and data is transferred through wireless transmission using zigbee module. In this {{to pick up the}} input signals from body of patient a microphone is used as a sensor. After receiving signals, these signals are further processed, amplified to increase their strength. These heart sounds are transferred wirelessly using zigbee module due to this multiple doctors can do auscultation. PC connectivity is provided to store these audio and video files for further analysis. These saved files can be made available using LANs and internet so another doctor can use them in their case, research. Here Heart beat signals are sensed, sent, displayed, monitored, stored, reviewed, and analyzed with ease. In this zigbee communication is used because it is low of cost, requires less energy, supports large number of nodes, reliable and can be used globally. Zigbee is developed by Zigbee alliance. Zigbee was standardized in 2003. The zigbee has IEEE standard as 802. 15. 4. Zigbee operates in the ISM radio bands 868 MHz in Europe, 915 MHz in U. S. A. & Australia and 2. 4 GHz in most jurisdictions worldwide. Data transmission rate varies from 20 kbps in 868 MHz frequency band and to 250 kbps in 2. 4 GHz. Hence by using wireless stethoscope doctors can hear cardiac sounds clearly and multiple doctor can hear the cardiac sounds because of zigbee module, this will increase accuracy of diagnosis.

40|$|Wearable {{technology}} {{has the potential}} to revolutionize the way humans interact with one another, with information, and with the electronic systems that surround them. This change can already be seen in the dramatic increase in the availability and use of wearable health and activity monitors. These devices continuously monitor the wearer using on-body sensors and wireless communication. They provide feedback {{that can be used to}} improve physical health and performance. Smart watches and head mounted displays are also receiving a great deal of commercial attention, providing immediate access to information via graphical displays, as well as additional sensing features. For the purposes of the Wearable Technology CLUSTER, wearable technology is broadly defined as any electronic sensing, human interfaces, computing, or communication that is mounted on the body. Current commercially available wearable devices primarily house electronics in rigid packaging to provide protection from flexing, moisture, and other contaminants. NASA mentors are interested in this approach, but are also interested in direct integration of electronics into clothing to enable more comfortable systems. For human spaceflight, wearable technology holds a great deal of promise for significantly improving safety, efficiency, autonomy, and research capacity for the crew in space and support personnel on the ground. Specific capabilities of interest include: Continuous biomedical monitoring for research and detection of health problems. Environmental monitoring for individual exposure assessments and alarms. Activity monitoring for responsive robotics and environments. Multi-modal caution and warning using tactile, auditory, and visual alarms. Wireless, hands-free, on-demand voice communication. Mobile, on-demand access to space vehicle and robotic displays and controls. Many technical challenges must be overcome to realize these wearable technology applications. For example, to make a wearable device that is both functional and comfortable for long duration wear, developers must strive to reduce electronic mass and volume while also addressing constraints imposed by the body attachment method. Depending on the application, the device must be placed in a location that the user can see and reach, and that provides the appropriate access to air and the wearer's skin. Limited power is available from body-worn batteries and heat must be managed to prevent discomfort. If the clothing is to be washed, there are additional durability and washability hurdles that traditional electronics are not designed to address. Finally, each specific capability has unique technical challenges that will likely require unique solutions. In addition to the technical challenges, development of wearable devices is made more difficult by the diversity of skills required and the historic lack of collaboration across domains. Wearable technology development requires expertise in textiles engineering, apparel design, software and computer engineering, electronic design and manufacturing, human factors engineering, and application-specific fields such as <b>acoustics,</b> <b>medical</b> devices, and sensing. Knowledge from each of these domains must be integrated to create functional and comfortable devices. For this reason, the diversity of knowledge and experience represented in the Wearable Technology is critical to overcoming the fundamental challenges in the field...|$|R
