5|$|Diverse life exists {{within the}} range, {{including}} endangered species like Larch Mountain Salamanders and spotted owls. Amphibians like salamanders and frogs are common, as are birds. Mammals {{in the area}} consist of elk, <b>mountain</b> <b>lions,</b> deer, and black bears. Eastern Cascades fish include Lost River suckers and short suckers, which are both endemic species.|$|E
5|$|Most desert {{animals are}} nocturnal, or mainly active at night. Nocturnal {{behavior}} is an adaptation to both predation and hot summer daytime temperatures. Nocturnal animals at Craters of the Moon include woodrats (also called packrats), skunks, foxes, bobcats, <b>mountain</b> <b>lions,</b> bats, nighthawks, owls, {{and most other}} small desert rodents.|$|E
5|$|Black Hills mammals include deer, elk (wapiti), bighorn sheep, {{mountain}} goats, and <b>mountain</b> <b>lions,</b> {{while the}} streams and lakes contain {{several species of}} trout. Cottontail rabbits and wood rabbits live throughout the Hills, as do squirrels, raccoons, chipmunks, and porcupines. Wild burro and bobcat can be found, as well as bison in limited quantity. Woodpecker, robin, sparrow, jay, bobwhite, and wren are Black Hills birds.|$|E
25|$|There {{has also}} been an {{increase}} in the <b>mountain</b> <b>lion</b> population in the larger region and one should know how to respond if these animals are encountered. Please see the <b>mountain</b> <b>lion</b> safety tips in the <b>Mountain</b> <b>lion</b> article.|$|R

2500|$|MG Siegler of TechCrunch {{said that}} the {{difference}} between <b>Lion</b> and <b>Mountain</b> <b>Lion</b> was not comparable to the difference between Leopard and Snow Leopard because <b>Mountain</b> <b>Lion</b> adds many new features that were not available in Lion. He also praised the application compatibility and {{said that the}} only updates needed were to add Notification Center features to applications. Jim Dalrymple of The Loop commented [...] "there will be tens of thousands of words published on Wednesday when <b>Mountain</b> <b>Lion</b> hits the Mac App Store, but let's face it, what {{you really want to know}} is whether <b>Mountain</b> <b>Lion</b> is worth the upgrade. Let's get that out of the way now — yes, it is definitely worth it," [...] and said that at $19.99, <b>Mountain</b> <b>Lion</b> was a [...] "bargain". David Pogue of The New York Times said [...] "Over all, then, <b>Mountain</b> <b>Lion</b> is a gentle, thoughtful upgrade. All 200 new features? No, not really. But 10 that you'll use every day? For $20? Yes." ...|$|R
5|$|Due to {{a higher}} {{elevation}} and level of precipitation, the Black Hills ecology differs significantly from the plains. The mountains are thickly blanketed by various types of pines, including ponderosa and lodgepole pines, as well as spruces. Black Hills mammals include deer, elk (wapiti), bighorn sheep, mountain goats, pine marten, and <b>mountain</b> <b>lions,</b> while the streams and lakes contain several species of trout.|$|E
5|$|A {{grove of}} {{enormous}} incense cedars exists near Diamond Lake, {{and there is}} a forest of ponderosa pine at the nearby Emile Big Tree Trail. The Umpqua National Forest features swordferns and Douglas firs. Rocky Mountain elks, pronghorns, and mule deer, bobcats, black bears, and <b>mountain</b> <b>lions</b> live in the Fremont–Winema National Forest. The forest's rivers support populations of trout, and the lakes contain fish such as the largemouth bass. The forest is inhabited by avian species such as mallards, American bald eagles, Canada geese, and whistling swans. Peregrine falcons and Warner suckers also infrequently enter its boundaries.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the surface}} of the Mono Craters is barren but its slopes are covered by Jeffrey pine forest and partial greenery. Pumice Valley, {{directly}} to the west, is covered by sagebrush scrubland. The soil consists primarily of deep pumice, which does not hold water well. Mycorrhizal fungi in the soil invade the roots of Jeffrey pine trees in a symbiotic relationship that helps the pine absorb water and provides nutrients to the fungi. Jeffrey pine forests also surround the Inyo Craters and Mammoth Mountain. Mule deer, coyotes, black bears, yellow-bellied marmots, raccoons and <b>mountain</b> <b>lions</b> all have ranges that are coincident with forests that cover parts of the Mono–Inyo craters.|$|E

5|$|The Laguna Canyon area {{supports}} {{a variety of}} native Southern California wildlife, including large mammals such as <b>mountain</b> <b>lions,</b> bobcats, coyotes and mule deer. Like Aliso and Wood Canyons Regional Park to the south, the canyon supports over one hundred species of birds. Some of its endangered species include California gnatcatcher, cactus wren, and orange-throated whiptail. Except for the Laguna Lakes, the canyon has no fish habitat, and riparian habitat is sparse because the local creeks have only seasonal flow.|$|E
5|$|The state holds {{populations of}} white-tailed deer, mule deer, antelope, coyotes, <b>mountain</b> <b>lions,</b> bobcats, elk, and birds such as quail, doves, cardinals, bald eagles, red-tailed hawks, and pheasants. In prairie ecosystems, American bison, greater prairie chickens, badgers, and {{armadillo}} are common, {{and some of}} the nation's largest prairie dog towns inhabit shortgrass prairie in the state's panhandle. The Cross Timbers, a region transitioning from prairie to woodlands in Central Oklahoma, harbors 351 vertebrate species. The Ouachita Mountains are home to black bear, red fox, grey fox, and river otter populations, which coexist with 328 vertebrate species in southeastern Oklahoma. Also, in southeastern Oklahoma lives the American alligator.|$|E
5|$|Timber wolves are top predators {{that were}} reintroduced amidst {{controversy}} to central Idaho {{in the mid-1990s}} to restore ecosystem stability. The wolves have since expanded their range and established packs in most of Boise National Forest. Wolves and <b>mountain</b> <b>lions</b> are the forest's top large mammal predators and have no predators of their own except humans. Most of the forest's native mammal species {{are present in the}} forest, with the exception of grizzly bears, which have become locally extinct, and plans for their reintroduction to central Idaho have been proposed since the 1990s but have not progressed.|$|E
50|$|The city of Pé de Serra is {{situated}} {{on the slopes of}} the <b>mountain</b> <b>Lion.</b> The city lies between the two main <b>mountains,</b> <b>Lion</b> and Bugi. The city has several towns which serve as urban centres in addition to the city centre itself.|$|R

50|$|The range {{contains}} important {{breeding ground}} for <b>mountain</b> <b>lion</b> and the southern portion is important for <b>mountain</b> <b>lion</b> connectivity. The Nature Conservancy identified the Datils as a key conservation area in New Mexico due to the range’s ecological diversity and species richness.|$|R
5|$|A diverse {{collection}} of birds {{sustained by the}} water life, such as the black skimmer, brown pelican, great blue heron, egret, laughing gull, roseate spoonbill, tern, and the white ibis, {{can be found in}} the bay, especially near the mouth of Rincon Bayou. Local efforts by the Coastal Bend Bays and Estuaries program have benefited bird populations by adding crushed oyster shells to the bay's small islands for improved nesting conditions, and the restoration of marsh near the Nueces Bay Causeway to increase fish populations to satisfy the birds' dietary requirements. At the nearby Nueces Delta Preserve, countless birds have been observed, as well as bobcats, coyotes, feral hogs, <b>mountain</b> <b>lions,</b> rattlesnakes, Texas spiny lizards, western diamondbacks and white-tailed deer.|$|E
5|$|The Iroquois {{signed the}} Fort Stanwix Treaty of 1768, ceding the lands {{south of the}} Ohio to the British. European {{expansion}} into the upper Ohio valley increased. An estimated 4,000 to 5,000 families settled in western Pennsylvania between 1768 and 1770. Of these settlers, about a third were English, a third were Scotch-Irish, and the rest were Welsh, German and others. These groups tended to settle together in small farming communities, but often their households were not within hailing distance. The life of a settler family was one of relentless hard work: clearing the forest, stumping the fields, building cabins and barns, planting, weeding, and harvesting. In addition, almost everything was manufactured by hand, including furniture, tools, candles, buttons, and needles. Settlers {{had to deal with}} harsh winters, and with snakes, black bears, <b>mountain</b> <b>lions,</b> and timber wolves. Because of the fear of raids by Native Americans, the settlers often built their cabins near, or even on top of, springs, to ensure access to water. They also built blockhouses, where neighbors would rally during conflicts.|$|E
5|$|The pair {{defends the}} chosen nest site against other peregrines, and often against ravens, herons, and gulls, and if ground-nesting, also such mammals as foxes, wolverines, felids, bears, wolves, and <b>mountain</b> <b>lions.</b> Both nests and (less frequently) adults are predated by larger-bodied {{raptorial}} birds like eagles, large owls, or gyrfalcons. The most serious predators of peregrine nests in North America and Europe are the {{great horned owl}} and the Eurasian eagle owl. When reintroductions have been attempted for peregrines, the most serious impediments were these two owls routinely picking off nestlings, fledglings and adults by night. Peregrines defending their nests have managed to kill raptors as large as golden eagles and bald eagles (both of which they normally avoid as potential predators) that have come {{too close to the}} nest by ambushing them in a full stoop. In one instance, when a snowy owl killed a newly fledged peregrine, the larger owl was in turn killed by a stooping peregrine parent.|$|E
25|$|Messages, {{an instant}} {{messaging}} software application, is added in <b>Mountain</b> <b>Lion.</b> It was announced on February 16, 2012, {{as part of}} the OS X <b>Mountain</b> <b>Lion</b> developer preview. Starting with this release, Messages replaced iChat as the default OS X instant-messaging client.
