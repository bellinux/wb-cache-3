40|$|Chlorine nitrate has two low-lying {{vibrational}} modes {{that lead}} {{to a series of}} Fermi resonances in the 9 υ 97 υ 7 family of levels that include the 92 ⇔ 71 and 93 ⇔ 7191 dyads and the 94 ⇔ 9271 ⇔ 72 and 95 ⇔ 9371 ⇔ 9172 triads. These states, along with the ground and 91 vibrational states, have been previously analyzed with millimeter and submillimeter wave spectroscopy and provide a substantial body of data for the investigation of these resonances and their impact on calculated spectroscopic constants and structural parameters. Due to fitting indeterminacies, these previous analyses did not include the main Fermi resonance interaction term. Consequently, the fitted rotational constants are linear combinations of the unmixed rotational constants of the basis vibrational states. In this paper, we have calculated the contributions of the Fermi resonances to the observed rotational constants in a model that determines the vibrational–rotational constants, the Fermi term and the mixing between interacting vibrational states, the cubic potential constant (φ 997) that connects interacting levels through a Fermi resonance, and the inertial defects.

5000|$|QTAIM {{is applied}} to the {{description}} of certain organic crystals with unusually short distances between neighboring molecules as observed by X-ray diffraction. For example, in the crystal structure of <b>molecular</b> <b>chlorine</b> the experimental Cl...Cl distance between two molecules is 327 picometres which is less than the sum of the van der Waals radii of 350 picometres. In one QTAIM result 12 bond paths start from each chlorine atom to other chlorine atoms including the other chlorine atom in the molecule. The theory also aims to explain the metallic properties of metallic hydrogen in much the same way. The theory is also applied to so-called hydrogen-hydrogen bonds [...] as they occur in molecules such as phenanthrene and chrysene. In these compounds the distance between two ortho hydrogen atoms again is shorter than their van der Waals radii and according to in silico experiments based on this theory, a bond path is identified between them. Both hydrogen atoms have identical electron density and are closed shell and therefore they are very different from the so-called dihydrogen bonds which are postulated for compounds such as (CH3)2NHBH3 and also different from so-called agostic interactions. In mainstream chemistry close proximity of two nonbonding atoms leads to destabilizing steric repulsion but in QTAIM the observed hydrogen hydrogen interactions are in fact stabilizing. It is well known that both kinked phenanthrene and chrysene are around 6 kcal/mol (25 kJ/mol) more stable than their linear isomers anthracene and tetracene. One traditional explanation is given by Clar's rule. QTAIM shows that a calculated stabilization for phenanthrene by 8 kcal/mol (33 kJ/mol) is the result of destabilization of the compound by 8 kcal/mol (33 kJ/mol) originating from electron transfer from carbon to hydrogen, offset by 12.1 kcal (51 kJ/mol) of stabilization due to a H..H bond path. The electron density at the critical point between the two hydrogen atoms is low, 0.012 e for phenanthrene. Another property of the bond path is its curvature. Another molecule studied in QTAIM is biphenyl. Its two phenyl rings are oriented at a 38° angle with respect to each other with the planar molecular geometry (encountered in a rotation around the central C-C bond) destabilized by 2.1 kcal/mol (8.8 kJ/mol) and the perpendicular one destabilized by 2.5 kcal/mol (10.5 kJ/mol). The classic explanations for this rotation barrier are steric repulsion between the ortho-hydrogen atoms (planar) and breaking of delocalization of pi density over both rings (perpendicular).|$|E

40|$|In {{this thesis}} the {{experimental}} results on ultrafast excitation of <b>molecular</b> structures (<b>chlorine</b> dioxide, sulfur hexafluoride) are presented. The core {{component of the}} setup is a 1 kHz 32 fs Ti:Sapphire based laser with 2. 5 mJ energy based on chirped pulse amplification technique. 15 fs pulses are stretched {{by a factor of}} 10000 and energy enhanced by a chain of regenative and multipass amplification. Compression is done by a simple grating pair. The necessity of dispersion control of at least third order is discussed. The optimization of the System is carried out with the calculations of a ray-tracing program. For the experiments the pulse duration from the amplifier chain is not short enough. The next step is the spectral broadening of the pulses in dielectric hollow waveguides due to selfphasemodulation in an atomic gases. After compression with prisms and chirped mirrors, the duration of the pulses at 800 nm is 9 fs with more than 0. 5 mJ energy. For the first time the compression at 400 nm with the same technique is presented. The duration of these pulses is 8 fs with 0. 015 mJ energy. The problems of compression at 400 nm are discussed. Pump-probe experiments of chlorin dioxide in different solutions is presented. The molecule is pumped and probed with 400 nm, 50 fs pulses. The different behaviour in water, acetonitrile and cyclohexane shows the influence of the caging effect. The appearance of oscillations with 102 fs is in contradiction with gas-phase results. The difference to gas-phase experiments is discussed. The last chapter reports the impulsive excitation of raman active sulfur hexafuoride in the gas phase. The pulse duration (20 fs) is shorter then the molecular vibration mode (43 fs). The molecule acts as a single-mode raman oscillator without rotational modes. The established theoretical model predicts the generation of lower frequency components in the spectrum of the incident pulse due to impulsive raman excitation of the molecular vibration which is observed experimentally. The compression of the new wavelenghts shows a new method of generating tunable pulses with durations up to 16 fs over a wide range of the laser spectrum, since this process is independent from the incident wavelength. </p...|$|R
40|$|Faced {{with the}} problem of underdetermined kinetic {{equations}} in analyzing momenta and kinetic energies of three body decay fragments, we followed two conceptually different paths in order to shed light on the dynamics of the process. One is based on the evaluation of the observed kinematic quantities after introduction of physically meaningful parameters for each type of decay: sequential, synchronously concerted, and asynchronously concerted mechanism. The other one is based on an information theoretic approach, maximizing the entropy of the joint probability matrix containing the probabilities for coincidently realizing accessible sets of product states. The results obtained in both cases match remarkably well: No significant contribution of a <b>molecular</b> channel, producing <b>chlorine</b> molecules, was found. Likewise, the generation of a stable chloroformyl radical had been ruled out in previous studies, so that every dissociation process upon irradiation around 230 nm yields three fragments: two chlorine atoms and a carbon monoxide molecule. For this three body decay, the asynchronously concerted mechanism is the dominant dissociation channel, accounting for over 80 % of the products. The chlorine fragments move preferentially in the same direction, resulting in forward scattering of the carbon monoxide. A less abundant decay channel is the synchronously concerted mechanism, in which the two bonds cleave in unison, and that accounts for the remaining products. The geometry of the decaying parent resembles the ground state equilibrium geometry with significant excitations of the COCl 2 bending modes. For both mechanisms the CO fragments are generated with high internal excitation. I...|$|R

Although carbon materials enable to reach the current regulation in terms of dioxins and furans emissions, they exhibit a potential auto ignition risk when present in hot flue gases. Here, the adsorption potential of carbon based products is compared to the one of some inorganic materials. Chlorobenzene was chosen as a reference molecule to compare the removal performance of the different adsorbents.

In {{the first part of this}} study, five inorganic materials were selected according to their chlorobenzene adsorption performance compared to those of carbon based products currently used to remove micropollutants from MSWI flue gases. In the second part of the study, the influence of the inlet concentration of adsorbate on the adsorption potential of sorbents is investigated.

40|$|The {{adsorption}} of <b>molecular</b> and atomic <b>chlorine</b> on perfect Ag(111) surface {{has been}} studied and characterized by means of extensive density-functional-theory calculations. For the molecular adsorption, {{we find that the}} dissociation of Cl(2) proceeds with an almost vanishing barrier. As for the adsorption of atomic Cl, on-surface, subsurface, and substitutional adsorptions are considered {{as a function of the}} coverage. At coverage lower than 1 / 2 ML, the on-surface adsorption displays the most exothermic chemisorption energies, whereas the mixed on-surface+subsurface and on-surface+substitutional adsorption modes become competitive with pure on-surface adsorption at about 1 / 2 ML of coverage and at higher coverages even preferred. The analysis of the adsorption free energy as a function of chlorine chemical potential reveals that the on-surface (root 3 x root 3) R 30 degrees adsorption phase is thermodynamically the most stable over a very broad range of Cl chemical potential. The mixed adsorption modes become thermodynamically more stable at high coverage for values of the Cl chemical potential that are substantially larger than those needed to form silver chloride. This finding seems to indicate that the formation of mixed adsorption phases, if they would ever occur, cannot be due to thermodynamic equilibrium but can only result from kinetic effects. We also find that the presence of open surface steps does not stabilize the subsurface Cl adsorption at low coverage. However due to the stronger Cl-surface interaction near steps, the mixed on-surface+subsurface adsorption on Ag(210) at high coverage becomes thermodynamically the most stable phase at Cl chemical potential close to that needed for the formation of bulk AgCl...|$|R
