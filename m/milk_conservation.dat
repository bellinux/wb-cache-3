He designed the items required for production, and is credited for being the founder of industrial <b>milk</b> <b>conservation</b> in Norway. The product [...] "Viking Milk" [...] was patented and introduced by him in 1891.

40|$|Coconut milk is {{a liquid}} {{produced}} from squeezed coconut scraper combined with water. Coconut milk contained saturated acid-fat and un-saturated acid-fat, but saturated acid-fat in coconut milk is saturated acid-fat with middle chain which {{easy to be}} absorbed. Mid-saturated acid-fat has anti-microbe character so that it increased body immune and easy to be changed into energy. Coconut milk is easy to be broken {{if it was not}} processed since the micro-organism in coconut milk grew faster in tropical area with 30 - 400 C temperature. The problem is there is so many way to do conservation process, like canning process, but there still another alternative to conserve coconut milk, that was by fermentation with acid-lactate bacterial into yoghurt and it still be rare to do. Coconut <b>milk</b> <b>conservation</b> has been done, but the writer didn’t use sucrose in fermentation process. That’s why the writer try to add sucrose in fermentation process of coconut milk in miyoghurt process. General aim from the research is to find out the influence of sucrose concentration different in coconut milk yoghurt production (miyoghurt) also to find out the exact concentration resulted the best miyoghurt. The hypothesis was there was different in sucrose concentration in miyoghurt process and 5...|$|E
40|$|The {{collection}} of milk {{is not well}} developed in West Africa. According to the World Bank, more than 5 million litres are lost annually because milk cannot be kept during transport. One solution for farmers in isolated areas is the LPS system, {{which is based on}} the enzyme lactoperoxidase (LPS). Accordingly, farmers need to add a small sachet of thiocyanate and a sachet of hydrogen peroxide in each milk canister. These two substances occur naturally in milk, but in insufficient quantities to totally stop the growth of bacteria. By strengthening the natural process, milk can be kept three to five hours longer, which is often time enough for farmers to bring it to a refrigeration collection point. This method of conserving milk has been approved by the FAO technical committee for milk and dairy products standards, and it allows farmers to sell to markets further away. FAO is also launching a worldwide programme over three years to test and promote LPS <b>milk</b> <b>conservation</b> in 85 countries.

40|$|For {{decades the}} loss of {{biodiversity}} in cultivated landscapes has been extremely high. Now the question arises how to combine profitable farming practices with the conservation of species-rich grassland (SRG. The aim {{of the study was}} to analyse the relation between grassland biodiversity, cultivation method (organic or conventional), cultivation intensity (low-input or intensive), profitability and type of farms (beef or dairy farm). For this study grassland biodiversity recordings of 12 organic and 12 conventional farms were analysed in a pairwise comparison. These results were then applied to the economic factors of the farms. Significant differences in biodiversity were found within cultivations methods and type of farms. Organic farms had a higher proportion of SRG and also a higher proportion of biotopes, which were conserved through cultivation. Furthermore the conservation of SRG was more profitable because of the higher prices for organic <b>milk.</b> Therefore the <b>conservation</b> of biodiversity and the profitability of the farms could be combined more easily...|$|R
40|$|Camel milk is {{recognised}} {{to furnish}} important components including vitamin C, niacin and riboflavin. It {{is also known}} to provide health protective functions such as anti-diabetic, anti-infectious, anti-stress and its effects against stomach-ache to name a few. However, its valorisation is still very limited. The particular composition of this <b>milk</b> makes its <b>conservation</b> and transformation very difficult. Investigation on the conservation possibilities of camel milk, thus, its transformation into derived products such as cheese so as the population gets the full benefits from its nutritional and therapeutic virtues, is hereby undertaken. However, previous reports showed its weak coagulation propriety, which {{is the key to}} its transformation into derived products. In order to remedy this obstacle, a variety of techniques have been proposed including the use of dromedary gastric enzymes. The data showed that the GEC from the older camels gave the best results significantly (p≤ 0. 05) for both milk clotting activity and flocculation time of both bovine and camel milk compared with the other tested enzyme preparations. The optimum flocculation time was obtained at pH 5. 8 and 42 °C for the camel milk and at pH 6. 0 and 37 °C for bovine milk...|$|R
40|$|Foram avaliados diferentes períodos (0, 3 e 6 dias) e 2 temperaturas (4 ° e 10 °C) no armazenamento do leite de cabra cru e sua influência sobre a qualidade e vida útil do produto pasteurizado. Nos períodos descritos de armazenamento, procedeu-se à pasteurização lenta do leite (65 °C/ 30 min), sendo o produto processado armazenado a 10 °C por mais 6 dias. As amostras do leite cru foram caracterizadas imediatamente após a ordenha e após o 3 ° e 6 ° dias de armazenagem. O leite pasteurizado foi caracterizado imediatamente após a pasteurização e após o 3 º e 6 º dias de armazenagem a 10 °C. Foram {{realizadas}} as seguintes análises: contagens de microrganismos mesófilos, psicrotróficos totais, lipolíticos e proteolíticos, coliformes totais e fecais e físico-químicas: acidez, gordura e ácidos graxos livres (AGL). As populações de microrganismos no leite cru tiveram maior desenvolvimento na temperatura de 10 °C do que a 4 °C. A acidez manteve-se dentro do aceitável na armazenagem a 4 °C por 6 dias, mas não a 10 °C. Foi observado decréscimo significativo (p Different periods (0, 3 and 6 days) and 2 temperatures (4 °C and 10 °C) of raw goat's milk {{storage and}} its impact on pasteurized product quality and shelf life were evaluated. In the described periods, slow pasteurization (65 °C/ 30 min) was carried out and the pasteurized product was stored at 10 °C for 6 days. Raw milk samples were characterized after milk handling and after 3 and 6 days of storage. Pasteurized milk was evaluated immediately after heat treatment and after 3 and 6 days of storage at 10 °C. The counting of mesophiles, total, lipolytic and proteolytic psichotrophic bacteria, total and fecal coliforms, acidity, fat and free fatty acid (FFA) contents were determined. The microorganisms' populations had a higher growth at 10 °C than 4 °C. Acidity remained in acceptable levels during storage at 4 °C for 6 days, but not at 10 °C. There was a significant decrease (p < 0. 05) in raw milk fat content during storage in both temperatures and a gradual increase of free fatty acids (FFA). Pasteurization was efficient in the reduction of bacteria populations and the lipolytic and proteolytic psichrotrophic microorganisms were non-detectable after heat treatment. However, alterations during raw milk storage affected physical-chemical characteristics of pasteurized milk. During storage, values of pasteurized milk acidity and fat content remained stable, while the amount of FFA increased significantly. It was concluded that raw goat's milk can be stored for up to 3 days at 4 °C before heat treatment. This condition promotes 6 days of shelf-life after pasteurization. In addition, 10 °C is not a suitable temperature for raw <b>milk</b> <b>conservation...</b>|$|E
