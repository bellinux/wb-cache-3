The Fisher government made another attempt, holding a referendum in 1913 which asked for greater federal powers over trade and commerce, corporations, industrial matters, trusts, <b>monopolies,</b> and railway disputes.

The Modernists argued that state <b>monopolies</b> provided abundant raw materials, good working conditions, and high quality iron; the Reformists countered that state-owned ironworks produced large and impractical implements designed to meet quotas rather than to be of practical use, were of inferior quality, and were too expensive for commoners to purchase. In 44 BC, the Reformists had both the salt and iron <b>monopolies</b> abolished, but the <b>monopolies</b> were reinstated in 41 BC after their abrupt closure resulted in significant losses of revenue for the government and disruption of the private economy.|$|E

5|$|To {{pay for his}} {{military}} campaigns and colonial expansion, Emperor Wu nationalized several private industries. He created central government <b>monopolies</b> administered largely by former merchants. These <b>monopolies</b> included salt, iron, and liquor production, as well as bronze-coin currency. The liquor monopoly lasted only from 98 to 81 BC, and the salt and iron <b>monopolies</b> were eventually abolished in early Eastern Han. The issuing of coinage remained a central government monopoly {{throughout the rest of}} the Han dynasty. The government <b>monopolies</b> were eventually repealed when a political faction known as the Reformists gained greater influence in the court. The Reformists opposed the Modernist faction that had dominated court politics in Emperor Wu's reign and during the subsequent regency of Huo Guang (d.68 BC). The Modernists argued for an aggressive and expansionary foreign policy supported by revenues from heavy government intervention in the private economy. The Reformists, however, overturned these policies, favoring a cautious, non-expansionary approach to foreign policy, frugal budget reform, and lower tax-rates imposed on private entrepreneurs.|$|E

To eliminate the influence of such private entrepreneurs, Emperor Wu nationalized the salt and iron industries in 117 BC and allowed many of the former industrialists to become officials administering the <b>monopolies.</b> By Eastern Han times, the central government <b>monopolies</b> were repealed in favor of production by commandery and county administrations, as well as private businessmen.|$|E

A <b>monopoly</b> firm {{should be considered a}} natural <b>monopoly</b> if and only if its production economies dominate those offered by alternative market structures. The <b>monopoly’s</b> production economies are dominant if breaking up the <b>monopoly</b> increases overall production costs for the economy. The natural <b>monopoly</b> must have strict and global cost subadditivity as shown by William J. Baumol (1977), {{but this is not a}} sufficient condition. Also, the natural <b>monopoly</b> may not represent the lowest-cost means of producing its products if breaking up the <b>monopoly</b> increases production costs for products that the <b>monopoly</b> does not produce. The other-party costs (such as regulatory costs) or cost savings (such as one-stop shopping) that are not reflected market transactions should be subtracted from or added to the <b>monopoly’s</b> economies of joint production when examining the efficiency of the <b>monopoly</b> market structure...|$|R

5|$|A key {{criticism}} of the Act {{at the time as}} well as more recently is that the NIRA endorsed <b>monopolies,</b> with the attendant economic problems associated with that type of market failure. Even the National Recovery Review Board, established by President Roosevelt in March 1934 to review the performance of the NRA, concluded that the Act hindered economic growth by promoting cartels and <b>monopolies.</b> One of the economic effects of monopoly and cartels is higher prices—this was seen as necessary because the severe deflation of 1929–33 had depressed prices 20% and more. There is anecdotal evidence that these higher prices led to some stability in industry, but a number of scholars maintain that these prices were so high that economic recovery was inhibited. But other economists disagree, pointing to far more important monetary, budgetary, and tax policies as contributors to the continuation of the Great Depression. Others point out that the cartels created by the Act were inherently unstable (as all cartels are), and that the effect on prices was minimal because the codes collapsed so quickly.|$|E

40|$|Fifty-eight years ago, Harberger (1954) {{estimated}} {{that the costs of}} <b>monopoly,</b> which resulted from misallocation of resources across industries, were trivial. Others showed the same was true for tariffs. This research soon led to the consensus that <b>monopoly</b> costs are of little significance–a consensus that persists to this day. This paper reports on a new literature that takes a different approach to the costs of <b>monopoly.</b> It examines the costs of <b>monopoly</b> and tariffs within industries. In particular, it examines the histories of industries in which a <b>monopoly</b> is destroyed (or tariffs greatly reduced) and the industry transitions quickly from <b>monopoly</b> to competition. If there are costs to <b>monopoly</b> and high tariffs within industries, {{we should be able to}} see these costs whittled away as the <b>monopoly</b> is destroyed. In contrast to the prevailing consensus, this new research has identified significant costs of <b>monopoly.</b> <b>Monopoly</b> (and high tariffs) is shown to significantly lower productivity within establishments. It also leads to misallocation within industry: resources are transferred from high to low productivity establishments. From these histories a common theme (or theory) emerges as to why <b>monopoly</b> is costly. When a <b>monopoly</b> is created, “rents ” are created. Conflict emerges among shareholders, managers, and employees of the <b>monopoly</b> as they negotiate how to divide these rents. Mechanisms are set up to split the rents. These mechanisms are often means to reduce competition among members of the <b>monopoly.</b> Although the mechanisms divide rents, they also destroy them (by leading to low productivity and misallocation) ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} price-setting {{problem of a}} <b>monopoly</b> that in each time period has the option of failing to deliver its good after {{receiving}} payment. The <b>monopoly</b> may be induced to deliver the good if consumers expect that the <b>monopoly</b> will not deliver {{in the future if}} it does not deliver today. If the good is non-durable and consumers are anonymous, the <b>monopoly's</b> optimal strategy is to set price equal to the static <b>monopoly</b> price each period if the discount factor is high enough, and otherwise to set the lowest price at which it can credibly promise to deliver the good. If the good is durable, we derive an intuitive lower bound on the <b>monopoly's</b> optimal profit for any discount factor and show that it converges to the optimal static <b>monopoly</b> profit as the discount factor converges to one, in contrast to the Coase conjecture. We also show that rationing the good is never optimal for the <b>monopoly</b> if there is an efficient resale market and that the best equilibrium in which the <b>monopoly</b> always delivers involves a strictly decreasing price path that asymptotes to a level weakly above the ratio of the <b>monopoly's</b> marginal cost to the discount factor.

5|$|After the {{collapse}} of public enterprises during the late 1980s, privatisation became strongly popular. Menem privatised almost everything the state owned, except {{for a couple of}} banks. In terms of service there were indisputable improvements. For example, before the telephone privatisation, to get a new line it was not unusual to wait more than ten years, and apartments with telephone lines carried a big premium in the market. After privatisation the wait was reduced to less than a week. Productivity increased as investment modernised farms, factories and ports. However, in all cases, there were large outlays of employees. In addition, the process of privatisation was suspected of corruption in many cases. Ultimately, the privatised enterprises became private (rather than public) <b>monopolies.</b> Their tariffs on long-term contracts were raised in line with American inflation, even though prices in Argentina were falling.|$|E
40|$|This paper gives {{a revised}} theory of <b>monopoly,</b> on the {{assumption}} that the monopolist receives political favours in exchange for extending political support. In one case, the <b>monopoly</b> profit just equals the value of the <b>monopoly's</b> contribution to the government's support. <b>Monopoly</b> output may be higher or lower than the output associated with marginal-cost pricing, and higher or lower than this sector would supply in a reference economy operating under all-around perfect competition. The monopolist may also use more labour and/or capital, even if its output is lower. In general, the <b>monopoly</b> does not minimize the cost of its output, and it may waste resources in production, as well as in rent-seeking. A shift of product demand away from the <b>monopoly</b> does not necessarily cause the monopolist to release resources that it is wasting. On a more positive note, there are conditions under which the economy with one <b>monopoly</b> and one competitive sector will reach a second-best solution, or an optimum taking the level of <b>monopoly</b> profit as given, but these conditions are severe and the cost of <b>monopoly</b> may still be high. political capture, <b>monopoly,</b> competition...|$|R
