5|$|There are {{concerns}} raised about possible contribution from urban heat islands to global warming. Research on China indicates that urban heat island effect contributes to climate warming by about 30%. On the other hand, one 1999 comparison between {{urban and rural}} areas proposed that the urban heat island effects have little influence on global <b>mean</b> <b>temperature</b> trends. Many studies reveal increases in the severity of the effect with the progress of climate change.|$|E
40|$|Malaria {{transmission}} is {{strongly influenced by}} environmental temperature, but the biological drivers remain poorly quantified. Most studies analyzing malaria–temperature relations, including those investigating malaria risk and the possible impacts of climate change, are based solely on <b>mean</b> <b>temperatures</b> and extrapolate from functions determined under unrealistic laboratory conditions. Here, we present empirical evidence to show that, in addition to <b>mean</b> <b>temperatures,</b> daily fluctuations in temperature affect parasite infection, the rate of parasite development, and the essential elements of mosquito biology that combine to determine malaria transmission intensity. In general, we find that, compared with rates at equivalent constant <b>mean</b> <b>temperatures,</b> temperature fluctuation around low <b>mean</b> <b>temperatures</b> acts to speed up rate processes, whereas fluctuation around high <b>mean</b> <b>temperatures</b> acts to slow processes down. At the extremes (conditions representative of the fringes of malaria transmission, where range expansions or contractions will occur), fluctuation makes transmission possible at lower <b>mean</b> <b>temperatures</b> than currently predicted and can potentially block transmission at higher <b>mean</b> <b>temperatures.</b> If we are to optimize control efforts and develop appropriate adaptation or mitigation strategies for future climates, we need to incorporate into predictive models the effects of daily temperature variation and how that variation is altered by climate change...|$|R

5|$|However, an {{analysis}} of the distribution of megalodon over time suggests that climate change did not {{play a major role in}} its extinction.

5|$|On average, {{the light}} that Gliese 581d {{receives}} from its star has about 30% of the intensity of light the Earth receives from the Sun. By comparison, sunlight on Mars has about 40% of the intensity of that on Earth. That might {{seem to suggest that}} Gliese 581d is too cold to support liquid water and hence is inhospitable to life. However, an atmospheric greenhouse effect can significantly raise planetary temperatures. For example, Earth's own <b>mean</b> <b>temperature</b> would be about −18°C without any greenhouse gases, ranging from around 100°C on the day side to −150°C at night, much like that found on the Moon. If the atmosphere of Gliese 581d produces a sufficiently large greenhouse effect, and the planet's geophysics stabilize the CO2 levels (as Earth's does via plate tectonics), then the surface temperature might permit a liquid water cycle, conceivably allowing the planet to support life. Calculations by Barnes et al. suggest, however, that tidal heating is too low to keep plate tectonics active on the planet, unless radiogenic heating is somewhat higher than expected.|$|E
5|$|The European Winter of 1941-1942 was {{the coldest}} {{of the twentieth}} century. On 30 November, von Bock {{reported}} to Berlin that the temperature was –45 °C (–49 °F). General Erhard Raus, commander of the 6th Panzer Division, kept track of the daily <b>mean</b> <b>temperature</b> in his war diary.

Zhukov said that November's freezing weather stayed around –7 to –10°C (+19 to +14°F) Official Soviet Meteorological Service records show the lowest December temperature reached –28.8°C (–20°F). These numbers indicated severely cold conditions, and German troops were freezing with no winter clothing, using equipment that was not designed for such low temperatures. More than 130,000 cases of frostbite were reported among German soldiers. Frozen grease {{had to be removed}} from every loaded shell and vehicles had to be heated for hours before use.
