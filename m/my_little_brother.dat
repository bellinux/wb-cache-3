25|$|I {{actually}} {{never met}} the Three Kings—it didn't matter how hard <b>my</b> <b>little</b> <b>brother</b> and I tried to keep awake at night {{to catch a glimpse}} of the Three Royal Visitors, we would always fall asleep just before they arrived. But I do remember hearing them. I remember the weird cadence of their song in the dark distance; I remember the brittle sound of the camel's hooves crushing the frozen snow; and I remember the mysterious tinkling of their silver bridles.|$|E

Although initially admiring them, he became disappointed when he learnt how much the films had been changed retroactively; he argued that replacing the original effects with re-composited digital effects was [...] "an act of cultural vandalism". A fan of the original trilogy, he had written his undergraduate thesis on their cultural impact. After seeing a trailer for Adywan's cut of The Empire Strikes Back, Harmáček was inspired to create a version of the film that [...] "undid" [...] the post-1977 changes and restored the theatrical releases in high-definition. He described his motivation as: [...] "I {{wanted to be able to}} show people who haven't seen Star Wars yet, like <b>my</b> <b>little</b> <b>brother</b> or my girlfriend, the original, Oscar-winning version, but I didn't want to have to show it to them in bad quality." [...] Harmáček's edits were the first to recreate the theatrical releases in HD.|$|E

When later asked what inspired her to be an actress, Martin said, [...] "The best {{time in my life}} was when I was about four. Doree and I had to go live with my aunt in Ponca City, Oklahoma. My mother got sick and Daddy had to go to work every day, so we couldn't stay here. I didn't want to come back. I cried and cried. That was when I decided, if I had to come back, I'd be an actress. I started getting parts immediately and <b>my</b> <b>little</b> <b>brother</b> was signed by the same agent, but he lacked my interest in acting. I just loved it." ...|$|E

2500|$|Vaughan owed {{his guitar}} {{technique}} {{in large part}} to Lonnie Mack. Vaughan said, [...] "I got a lot of my fast stuff from Lonnie" [...] and observed in live performance that Mack was [...] "ahead of his time". In 1987, Vaughan listed Mack first among the guitarists he listened to, both as a youngster and as an adult. Mack recalled his first meeting with Vaughan in 1978: [...] "We was in Texas looking for pickers, and we went out to see the Thunderbirds. Jimmie was saying, 'Man, you gotta hear <b>my</b> <b>little</b> <b>brother.</b> He plays all your [...]' He was playing a little place called the Rome Inn, and we went over there and checked him out. As it would be, when I walked in the door, he was playing 'Wham!' And I said, 'Dadgum.' He was playing it right. I'd been playing it wrong {{for a long time and}} needed to go back and listen to my original record. That was in '78, I believe." [...] Vaughan owed part of his enduring style—especially his use of tremolo picking and vibrato—to Mack. He acknowledged that Mack taught him to [...] "play guitar from the heart". Vaughan's relationship with another Texas blues legend, Johnny Winter, was a little more complex. Although they met several times, and often played sessions with the same musicians or even performed the same material, as in the case of Boot Hill, Vaughan always refrained from acknowledging Winter in any form. In his biography, [...] "Raisin' Cain", Winter says that he was unnerved after reading Vaughan stating in an interview that he never met or knew Johnny Winter. [...] "We even played together over at Tommy Shannon's house one time." [...] Vaughan settled the issue in 1988 on the occasion of a Blues Festival in Europe where both he and Winter were on the bill, explaining that he has been misquoted and that [...] "Every musician in Texas knows Johnny and has learned something from him". [...] Asked to compare their playing styles in an interview in 2010, Winter admitted that [...] "mine's a little bit rawer, I think." ...|$|E

60|$|I {{knew that}} Peggotty {{would come to}} me in my room. The Sabbath stillness of the time (the day was so like Sunday! I have {{forgotten}} that) was suited to us both. She sat down by my side upon my little bed; and holding my hand, and sometimes putting it to her lips, and sometimes smoothing it with hers, as she might have comforted <b>my</b> <b>little</b> <b>brother,</b> told me, in her way, all that she had to tell concerning what had happened.|$|E
60|$|Once <b>my</b> <b>little</b> <b>brother</b> and I, belated in {{our search}} for the cows, were far away on the hills when night {{suddenly}} came upon us. I {{could not have been}} more than eight years old and Frank was five. This incident reveals the fearless use our father made of us. True, we were hardly a mile from the house, but there were many serpents on the hillsides and wildcats in the cliffs, and eight is pretty young for such a task.|$|E
6000|$|I {{know all}} now. After sitting {{for a quarter}} of an hour with the Doctor, who {{attributed}} his guest's uneasiness no doubt to his desire to see Miss Rosa Birch, Davison started up and said he wanted to see Miss Raby. [...] "You remember, sir, how kind she was to <b>my</b> <b>little</b> <b>brother,</b> sir?" [...] he said. Whereupon the Doctor, with a look of surprise, that anybody should want to see Miss Raby, said she was in the little school-room; whither the Captain went, knowing the way from old times.|$|E

No cards shall be left! I kiss the hand of my venerable uncle-in-law. You shall say to him that we fly to the South wilderness as the combined evangelical missionary to the heathen! Miss Boston herself say this. Ta-ta! How are you now? ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'No,' I said. 'It's the mother's.' Er--'My {{mother is}} very well. My father came home yesterday--on leave. He is delighted with his son, <b>my</b> <b>little</b> <b>brother,</b> and wishes {{to have him}} named after you, because you were so good to us all in that terrible time, which I shall never forget.
