A new multicast virtual path (VP) called “Multidrop VP ” which is particularly suitable for SONET/ATM rings is proposed.

50|$|In {{contrast}} to RS-422, {{which has a}} single driver circuit which cannot be switched off, RS-485 drivers use three-state logic allowing individual transmitters to be deactivated. This allows RS-485 to implement linear bus topologies using only two wires. The equipment located along a set of RS-485 wires are interchangeably called nodes, stations or devices. The recommended arrangement of the wires is as a connected series of point-to-point (<b>multidropped)</b> nodes, i.e. a line or bus, not a star, ring, or multiply connected network. Star and ring topologies are not recommended because of signal reflections or excessively low or high termination impedance. If a star configuration is unavoidable, special RS-485 star/hub repeaters are available which bidirectionally listen for data on each span and then retransmit the data onto all other spans.|$|R
40|$|Ink-jet {{processes}} {{using either}} a drop-on-demand or a dosing system {{have been applied}} to the deposition of single lenses and large arrays of high optical property refractive microlenses. The lenses are made of a silica based inorganic-organic material which can be densified either thermally or by UV irradiation at low temperature. Microlense diameter d and height h made with a single drop can be varied between approximately d= 50 µm and 2 mm, and h= 6. 25 and 150 µm, respectively, conferring a focal distance varying between 100 µm and approximately 10 mm, respectively. Large arrays of lenses have been realized with a minimum separation between the lenses as small as 5 % of their diameter. Single lenses and arrays of lenses made with <b>multidrops</b> were also obtained. Microdrops (1000) with d= 50 µm allow us to obtain lenses with diameter 800 µm, height 56 µm and focal distance of 2. 9 mm. All the components have a high optical transparency (92 %) within the wavelength range 300 nm- 2. 7 µm, are highly homogeneous and have very low stress and astigmatism. The index of refraction can be tailored by modifying the sol composition. The lens average surface roughness is Ra≈ 40 nm. Their shape measured by profilometry and their focusing properties, determined in and near the focal plane, are reported...|$|R

5000|$|SAS {{allows a}} higher {{transfer}} speed (3, 6 or 12 Gbit/s) than most parallel SCSI standards. SAS achieves these speeds on each initiator-target connection, hence getting higher throughput, whereas parallel SCSI shares the speed {{across the entire}} <b>multidrop</b> bus.|$|E
50|$|A <b>multidrop</b> bus (MDB) is a {{computer}} bus in which all components {{are connected to the}} electrical circuit. A process of arbitration determines which device sends information at any point. The other devices listen for the data they are intended to receive.|$|E

50|$|In a <b>multidrop</b> line {{arrangement}} (a central {{computer and}} different terminals {{in which the}} terminals share a single communication line {{to and from the}} computer), the system uses a master/slave polling arrangement whereby the central computer sends message (called polling message) to a specific terminal on the outgoing line. All terminals listen to the outgoing line, but only the terminal that is polled replies by sending any information that it has ready for transmission on the incoming line.|$|E
50|$|Fully Buffered DIMM (or FB-DIMM) is {{a memory}} {{technology}} {{that can be}} used to increase reliability and density of memory systems. Conventionally, data lines from the memory controller have to be connected to data lines in every DRAM module, i.e. via <b>multidrop</b> buses. As the memory width increases together with the access speed, the signal degrades at the interface between the bus and the device. This limits the speed and memory density, so FB-DIMMs take a different approach to solve the problem.|$|E
50|$|In star networks, which, in its {{simplest}} form, {{consists of}} one central switch, hub, or computer {{that acts as}} a conduit to transmit messages, polling is not required to avoid chaos on the lines, but it is often used to allow the master to acquire input in an orderly fashion.

5000|$|RS-485 {{supports}} inexpensive local {{networks and}} <b>multidrop</b> communications links, {{using the same}} differential balanced line over twisted pair as RS-422. It is generally accepted that RS-485 {{can be used with}} data rates up to 10 Mbit/s and distances up to 1200 m, but not at the same time. [...] A rule of thumb is that the speed in bit/s multiplied by the length in metres should not exceed 108. Thus a 50 meter cable should not signal faster than 2 Mbit/s.Under some conditions it can be used up to data transmission speeds of 64 Mbit/s.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>multidrop</b> bus used by {{vending machine}} {{controllers}} {{to communicate with}} the vending machine's components, such as a currency detector, is also called MDB (for MultiDropBus). In use since the 1980s, it is now an open standard of the National Automatic Merchandising Association, or NAMA. The devices communicate in a single-master, multiple-slave configuration using the MDB protocol, which is based on a Motorola 9-bit UART implemented as an 8-bit data value with an additional mode bit. The mode bit differentiates between ADDRESS and DATA bytes. The master sends messages containing one address byte and a variable number of data bytes. The bus [...] "slave devices" [...] listen for an address, and if it matches their address that slave device will process the message and respond to the master. [...] Though 9-bit compliant UARTs are not popular in PCs, they can be found in many microcontrollers.|$|E
50|$|Buses can be {{parallel}} buses, which carry data {{words in}} parallel on multiple wires, or serial buses, which carry data in bit-serial form. The addition of extra {{power and control}} connections, differential drivers, and data connections in each direction usually means that most serial buses have more conductors than the minimum of one used in 1-Wire and UNI/O. As data rates increase, the problems of timing skew, power consumption, electromagnetic interference and crosstalk across parallel buses {{become more and more}} difficult to circumvent. One partial solution to this problem has been to double pump the bus. Often, a serial bus can be operated at higher overall data rates than a parallel bus, despite having fewer electrical connections, because a serial bus inherently has no timing skew or crosstalk. USB, FireWire, and Serial ATA are examples of this. <b>Multidrop</b> connections do not work well for fast serial buses, so most modern serial buses use daisy-chain or hub designs.|$|E
50|$|An RS-232 {{serial port}} {{was once a}} {{standard}} feature of a personal computer, used for connections to modems, printers, mice, data storage, uninterruptible power supplies, and other peripheral devices. However, RS-232, {{when compared to other}} serial interfaces such as RS-422, RS-485 and Ethernet, is hampered by low transmission speed, short maximum cable length, large voltage swing, large standard connectors, no multipoint capability and limited <b>multidrop</b> capability. In modern personal computers, USB has displaced RS-232 from most of its peripheral interface roles. Many computers no longer come equipped with RS-232 ports (although some motherboards come equipped with a COM port header that allows the user to install a bracket with a DE-9 port) and must use either an external USB-to-RS-232 converter or an internal expansion card with one or more serial ports to connect to RS-232 peripherals. Nevertheless, thanks to their simplicity and past ubiquity, RS-232 interfaces are still used—particularly in industrial machines, networking equipment, and scientific instruments where a short-range, point-to-point, low-speed wired data connection is adequate.|$|E
40|$|Digital Communication {{can send}} signals of several devices on one wire. This reduces {{the costs of}} wiring immensely. DIA and AíD {{converters}} are superfluous for digital communicatioQ because controllers are mostly digital and the mfonnation is already digital now. So this also reduces the costs.
