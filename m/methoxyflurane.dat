5|$|Similar to its {{induction}} pharmacokinetics, <b>methoxyflurane</b> {{has very}} slow and somewhat unpredictable emergence characteristics. During initial clinical studies in 1961, {{the average time}} to emergence after discontinuation of <b>methoxyflurane</b> was 59minutes after administration of <b>methoxyflurane</b> for an average duration of 87minutes. The longest time to emergence was 285minutes, after 165minutes of <b>methoxyflurane</b> administration.|$|E
5|$|The {{biodegradation}} of <b>methoxyflurane</b> begins {{immediately after}} the onset of exposure. The kidney and liver toxicity observed after anesthetic doses is attributable {{to one or more}} metabolites produced by O-demethylation of <b>methoxyflurane.</b> Significant products of this catabolic process include methoxyfluoroacetic acid (MFAA), dichloroacetic acid (DCAA), and inorganic fluoride. <b>Methoxyflurane</b> nephrotoxicity is dose dependent and irreversible, resulting from O-demethylation of <b>methoxyflurane</b> to fluoride and DCAA. This effect is so predictable and reproducible that <b>methoxyflurane</b> now serves as a pharmacologic model of fluoride-related nephrotoxicity, one with which newer drugs are compared. It is not entirely clear whether the fluoride itself is toxic—it may simply be a surrogate measure for some other toxic metabolite. The concurrent formation of inorganic fluoride and DCAA is unique to <b>methoxyflurane</b> biotransformation compared with other volatile anesthetics, and this combination is more toxic than fluoride alone. This may explain why fluoride formation from <b>methoxyflurane</b> is associated with nephrotoxicity, while fluoride formation from other volatile anesthetics (such as enflurane and sevoflurane) is not. Furthermore, the concurrent use of tetracyclines and <b>methoxyflurane</b> has been reported to result in fatal renal toxicity.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the high}} blood {{solubility}} of <b>methoxyflurane</b> is often undesirable, this property makes it useful in certain situations—it persists in the lipid compartment {{of the body}} for a long time, providing sedation and analgesia well into the postoperative period. There is substantial data to indicate that <b>methoxyflurane</b> is an effective analgesic and sedative agent at subanesthetic doses. Supervised self-administration of <b>methoxyflurane</b> in children and adults can briefly lead to deep sedation, {{and it has been}} used as a patient controlled analgesic for painful procedures in children in hospital emergency departments. During childbirth, administration of <b>methoxyflurane</b> produces significantly better analgesia, less psychomotor agitation, and only slightly more somnolence than trichloroethylene.|$|E
5|$|With {{a minimum}} {{alveolar}} concentration (MAC) of 0.16%, <b>methoxyflurane</b> {{is an extremely}} potent anesthetic agent. It is a powerful analgesic agent at well below full anesthetic concentrations. Because of its low volatility and very high boiling point (104.8°C at 1atmosphere), <b>methoxyflurane</b> has a low vapor pressure at ambient temperature and atmospheric pressure. It is therefore quite difficult to vaporize <b>methoxyflurane</b> using conventional anesthetic vaporizers.|$|E

5|$|The {{biodegradation}} of <b>methoxyflurane</b> produces {{inorganic fluoride}} and dichloroacetic acid (DCAA). The combined {{effects of these}} two compounds {{may be responsible for}} the toxicity of <b>methoxyflurane</b> to some of the major organs of the human body. <b>Methoxyflurane</b> was determined to be nephrotoxic (damaging to the kidneys) in a dose-dependent response and hepatotoxic (damaging to the liver) at anesthetic doses in 1973, and the drug was abandoned as a general anesthetic in the late 1970s. In 1999, the manufacturer discontinued distribution of <b>methoxyflurane</b> in the United States and Canada, and on September 6, 2005, the Food and Drug Administration determined that it should be withdrawn from the market for safety concerns. It is however still used in Australia as an emergency analgesic for the initial management of pain due to acute trauma, as well as for brief painful procedures such as changing of wound dressings or for transport of injured people.|$|E
5|$|The {{effects of}} <b>methoxyflurane</b> on the circulatory system {{resemble}} those of diethyl ether. In dogs, <b>methoxyflurane</b> anesthesia causes a moderate decrease in blood pressure with minimal changes in heart rate, and no significant effect on blood sugar, epinephrine, or norepinephrine. Bleeding and increased arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) both induce further decreases in blood pressure, as well as increases in blood glucose, epinephrine and norepinephrine. In humans, <b>methoxyflurane</b> produces some decrease in blood pressure, but cardiac output, stroke volume, and total peripheral resistance are only minimally depressed. Its effect on the pulmonary circulation is negligible, {{and it does not}} predispose the heart to cardiac dysrhythmias.|$|E
5|$|Unlike diethyl ether, <b>methoxyflurane</b> is a {{significant}} respiratory depressant. In dogs, <b>methoxyflurane</b> causes a dose-dependent decrease in respiratory rate and a marked decrease in respiratory minute volume, with a relatively mild decrease in tidal volume. In humans, <b>methoxyflurane</b> causes a dose-dependent decrease in tidal volume and minute volume, with respiratory rate relatively constant. The net effect of these changes is profound respiratory depression, as evidenced by CO2 retention with a concomitant decrease in arterial pH (this {{is referred to as}} a respiratory acidosis) when anesthetized subjects are allowed to breathe spontaneously for any length of time.|$|E
5|$|Based on the {{findings}} of these and other studies in the early 1970s, the current consensus is that the use of <b>methoxyflurane</b> should be restricted only to healthy individuals, in situations where it offers specific advantages and even then, only at dosages less than 2.5MAC hours. Partly because of these warnings, but also because of the development of newer volatile anesthetics such as enflurane, isoflurane, desflurane and sevoflurane, the clinical use of <b>methoxyflurane</b> as a general anesthetic in humans was largely abandoned in the mid-1970s.|$|E
5|$|In 1968, Robert Wexler of Abbott Laboratories {{developed}} the Analgizer, a disposable inhaler {{that allowed the}} self-administration of <b>methoxyflurane</b> vapor in air for analgesia. The Analgizer consisted of a polyethylene cylinder 5inches long and 1inch in diameter with a 1inch long mouthpiece. The device contained a rolled wick of polypropylene felt which held 15milliliters of <b>methoxyflurane.</b> Because of {{the simplicity of the}} Analgizer and the pharmacological characteristics of <b>methoxyflurane,</b> it was easy for patients to self-administer the drug and rapidly achieve a level of conscious analgesia which could be maintained and adjusted as necessary {{over a period of time}} lasting from a few minutes to several hours. The 15milliliter supply of <b>methoxyflurane</b> would typically last for two to three hours, during which time the user would often be partly amnesic to the sense of pain; the device could be refilled if necessary. The Analgizer was found to be safe, effective, and simple to administer in obstetric patients during childbirth, as well as for patients with bone fractures and joint dislocations, and for dressing changes on burn patients. When used for labor analgesia, the Analgizer allows labor to progress normally and with no apparent adverse effect on Apgar scores. All vital signs remain normal in obstetric patients, newborns, and injured patients. The Analgizer was widely utilized for analgesia and sedation until the early 1970s, in a manner that foreshadowed the patient-controlled analgesia infusion pumps of today. The Analgizer inhaler was withdrawn in 1974, but use of <b>methoxyflurane</b> as a sedative and analgesic continues in Australia and New Zealand in the form of the Penthrox inhaler. Trials of <b>methoxyflurane</b> as an analgesic in emergency medicine are going on in the UK.|$|E

5|$|<b>Methoxyflurane</b> has a {{very high}} lipid {{solubility}} (oil:gas partition coefficient of around 950), which gives it very slow pharmacokinetics (induction and emergence characteristics); this being undesirable for routine application in the clinical setting. Initial studies performed in 1961 revealed that in unpremedicated healthy individuals, induction of general anesthesia with methoxyflurane-oxygen alone or with nitrous oxide was difficult or even impossible using the vaporizers available at that time. It {{was found to be}} necessary to administer an intravenous anesthetic agent such as sodium thiopental to ensure a smooth and rapid induction. It was further found that after thiopental induction, it was necessary to administer nitrous oxide for at least ten minutes before a sufficient amount of <b>methoxyflurane</b> could accumulate in the bloodstream to ensure an adequate level of anesthesia. This was despite using high flow (liters/minute) of nitrous oxide and oxygen, and with the vaporizers delivering the maximum possible concentration of <b>methoxyflurane.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>Methoxyflurane</b> is an {{extremely}} potent and highly lipid-soluble anesthetic agent, characterized by very slow induction (onset of action) and emergence (offset or dissipation) times.

It is, however, a significant respiratory depressant. <b>Methoxyflurane</b> has powerful analgesic (pain-relieving) properties at well below full anesthetic doses. It was utilized in self-administration devices for obstetric analgesia, in a manner that foreshadowed the patient-controlled analgesia infusion pumps of today.|$|E

5|$|Reports {{of severe}} and even fatal {{hepatotoxicity}} {{related to the}} use of <b>methoxyflurane</b> began to appear in 1966. These reports prompted anesthesiologists to subject this agent to intense and systematic scrutiny. A study published in 1973 by Cousins and Mazze demonstrated that compared with halothane, <b>methoxyflurane</b> produces dose-dependent and deleterious abnormalities in renal function. The authors showed that subclinical nephrotoxicity occurred following <b>methoxyflurane</b> at minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) for 2.5 to 3hours (2.5 to 3MAC hours), while overt toxicity was present in all patients at dosages greater than five MAC hours. This landmark study provided a model that would be used for the assessment of the nephrotoxicity of volatile anesthetics for the next two decades.|$|E
5|$|The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health {{maintains}} a recommended exposure limit for <b>methoxyflurane</b> as waste anesthetic gas of 2 ppm (13.5mg/m3) over 60 minutes.|$|E
5|$|Charles Suckling {{synthesized}} halothane in 1951. Halothane was {{the first}} organofluorine anesthetic agent to be introduced into clinical practice in 1956.

5|$|In {{a series}} of 500 {{consecutive}} obstetric patients, Boisvert and Hudon observed vomiting in 12 (4.8%) patients during or after administration of <b>methoxyflurane</b> anesthesia. These findings compared favorably with those reported for cyclopropane (42%), trichloroethylene (28%) and halothane (4.6%). In another study of 645 obstetric patients, Romagnoli and Korman observed 8 cases (1.2%) of postoperative vomiting, {{one of whom was}} retching before the administration of the anesthetic.|$|E
5|$|<b>Methoxyflurane</b> (INN), {{formerly}} {{marketed as}} Penthrane by Abbott Laboratories, is a halogenated ether {{that was in}} clinical use as a volatile inhalational anesthetic from its introduction by Joseph F. Artusio et al in 1960 until the late 1970s. It was first synthesized in the late 1940s by William T. Miller {{and his team of}} chemists following their involvement in the Manhattan Project.|$|E
5|$|With a {{molecular}} formula of C3H4Cl2F2O and a condensed structural formula of CHCl2CF2OCH3, the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) name for <b>methoxyflurane</b> is 2,2-dichloro-1,1-difluoro-1-methoxyethane. It is a halogenated ether {{in form of}} a clear, colorless liquid, and its vapor has a strong fruity aroma. It is miscible with ethanol, acetone, chloroform, diethyl ether, and fixed oils. It is soluble in rubber.|$|E
5|$|Each 3milliliter dose lasts {{approximately}} 30minutes. Pain relief begins after 6–8 breaths {{and continues}} {{for several minutes}} after stopping inhalation. The maximum recommended dose is 6milliliters per day or 15milliliters per week {{because of the risk}} of cumulative dose-related nephrotoxicity, and it should not be used on consecutive days. Despite the potential for renal impairment when used at anesthetic doses, no significant adverse effects {{have been reported in the}} literature when it is used at the lower doses (up to 6milliliters) used for producing analgesia and sedation. Due to the risk of organ (especially renal) toxicity, <b>methoxyflurane</b> is contraindicated in patients with pre-existing kidney disease or diabetes mellitus, and is not recommended to be administered in conjunction with tetracyclines or other potentially nephrotoxic or enzyme-inducing drugs.|$|E
5|$|The {{first report}} of {{nephrotoxicity}} appeared in 1964, when Paddock and colleagues reported three cases of acute renal insufficiency, {{two of whom}} {{were found to have}} calcium oxalate crystals in the renal tubules at autopsy. In 1966, Crandell and colleagues reported a series in which 17/95 (18%) of patients developed an unusual type of nephropathy after operations in which <b>methoxyflurane</b> was used as a general anesthetic. This particular type of renal insufficiency was characterized by vasopressin-resistant high-output renal failure (production of large volumes of poorly concentrated urine) with a negative fluid balance, pronounced weight loss, elevation of serum sodium, chloride, osmolality and blood urea nitrogen. The urine of these patients was of a relatively fixed specific gravity and an osmolality very {{similar to that of the}} serum. Furthermore, the high urine output persisted a challenge test of fluid deprivation. Most cases resolved within 2–3 weeks, but evidence of renal dysfunction persisted for more than one year in 3 of these 17 cases (18%), and more than two years in one case (6%).|$|E

The beneficial effects arise because the C-F bond is relatively unreactive. Fluorine-substituted ethers are volatile anesthetics, including the commercial products <b>methoxyflurane,</b> enflurane, isoflurane, sevoflurane and desflurane. Fluorocarbon anesthetics reduce the hazard of flammability with diethyl ether and cyclopropane. Perfluorinated alkanes are used as blood substitutes.|$|E
500|$|<b>Methoxyflurane</b> {{has been}} {{extensively}} used since the 1970s in Australia as an emergency analgesic for short-term use, mostly by the Australian and New Zealand Defence Forces, and the Australian ambulance services.

It is self-administered to children and adults using the Penthrox inhaler, a hand-held inhaler device, known as [...] "the green whistle". A non-opioid alternative to morphine, it is also easier to use than nitrous oxide. As of 2010, <b>methoxyflurane</b> was listed under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme for the initial management of pain due to acute trauma, {{as well as for}} brief painful procedures such as changing of wound dressings or for patient transport. A portable, disposable, single-use inhaler device (the Penthrox inhaler), along with a single 3milliliter brown glass vial of <b>methoxyflurane</b> is provided in doctor's kits that allows conscious hemodynamically stable patients (including children over the age of 5years) to self-administer the drug, under supervision.|$|E
