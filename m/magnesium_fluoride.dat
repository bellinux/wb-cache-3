5|$|The {{alkali metals}} {{are among the}} most {{electropositive}} elements on the periodic table and thus tend to bond ionically to the most electronegative elements on the periodic table, the halogens (fluorine, chlorine, bromine, iodine, and astatine), forming salts known as the alkali metal halides. The reaction is very vigorous and can sometimes result in explosions. All twenty stable alkali metal halides are known; the unstable ones are not known, with the exception of sodium astatide, because of the great instability and rarity of astatine and francium. The most well-known of the twenty is certainly sodium chloride, otherwise known as common salt. All of the stable alkali metal halides have the formula MX where M is an alkali metal and X is a halogen. They are all white ionic crystalline solids that have high melting points. All the alkali metal halides are soluble in water except for lithium fluoride (LiF), which is insoluble in water due to its very high lattice enthalpy. The high lattice enthalpy of lithium fluoride is due to the small sizes of the Li+ and F− ions, causing the electrostatic interactions between them to be strong: a similar effect occurs for <b>magnesium</b> <b>fluoride,</b> consistent with the diagonal relationship between lithium and magnesium.|$|E

The high specific surface areas of the materials are ideal for their study, either by FTIR spectroscopy using various probe molecules that have different basicity and steric requirements or by carrying out probe reactions that are catalysed by acidic surfaces. Context {{for some of the}} recent work is provided by a summary of the commercial Catalyst, fluorinated chromia and the related, fluorinated aluminas; a particular emphasis in these sections is their catalysis of reactions that involve carbon-halogen species. For the high surface area metal fluorides and their derivatives, room temperature dehydrochlorination of tert-butyl chloride, employing chlorine- 36 labelling to detect surface adsorbed species, enables comparative studies of surface acidity to be undertaken. ...|$|R

It utilizes the fact that both signals, used for the quantification by FTIR, are caused by the same deformation vibration mode of pyridine. Comparison of quantitative FTIR experiments and quantification by NMR shows that concentrations of acidic sites determined by FTIR spectroscopy have to be interpreted with caution. Furthermore, it is shown that the transfer of molar extinction coefficients from one catalyst to another may lead to wrong results. Molar extinction coefficients and concentrations of acidic sites determined by FTIR spectroscopy are affected by grinding and probably the particle size of the sample. High temperature during FTIR experiments has further impact on the quantification results. Peer Reviewe...|$|R

40|$|The {{utilisation}} of <b>magnesium</b> and aluminium <b>fluoride</b> nanoparticles in {{the preparation}} of transparent composites leading to materials with superior properties was investigated. Nanoscopic <b>magnesium</b> and aluminium <b>fluoride</b> has been prepared by the fluorolytic sol-gel route from the alkoxides and was surface modified by the reaction with trifluoroacetic acid or perfluorobutyric acid. IR spectroscopic experiments of the xerogels and crystal structure analysis of a trinuclear [Mg- 3 (mu F- 3) (mu-TFA) (6) (OCH 3) (2) (py) ](3 -) luster unit indicate that the carboxylate group is bound to the particle surface in a monodentate or bidentate bridging fashion.

25|$|In modern times, more {{sophisticated}} surface coatings have been developed; these include violet-blue dyes and vacuum-sputtered films resembling the <b>magnesium</b> <b>fluoride</b> coating on camera lenses. These coatings effectively whiten the apparent {{color of a}} yellow-tinted diamond, because the two colors are complementary and act to cancel each other out. Usually only applied to the pavilion or girdle region of a diamond, these coatings are among the hardest treatments to detect—while the dyes may be removed in hot water or alcohol with ease, the vacuum-sputtered films require a dip in sulfuric acid to remove.

25|$|The {{windows of}} the photomultipliers act as {{wavelength}} filters; this may be irrelevant if the cutoff wavelengths are outside of the application range or outside of the photocathode sensitivity range, but special care {{has to be taken}} for uncommon wavelengths. Borosilicate glass is commonly used for near-infrared to about 300nm. High borate borosilicate glasses exist also in high UV transmission versions with high transmission also at 254 nm. Glass with very low content of potassium can be used with bialkali photocathodes to lower the background radiation from the potassium-40 isotope. Ultraviolet glass transmits visible and ultraviolet down to 185nm. Used in spectroscopy. Synthetic silica transmits down to 160nm, absorbs less UV than fused silica. Different thermal expansion than kovar (and than borosilicate glass that's expansion-matched to kovar), a graded seal needed between the window {{and the rest of the}} tube.

25|$|The {{most common}} type of optical glass is crown glass, which has an index of {{refraction}} of about 1.52. An optimal single-layer coating would have to be made of a material with an index of about 1.23. Unfortunately, there are no solid materials with such a low refractive index. The closest materials with good physical properties for a coating are <b>magnesium</b> <b>fluoride,</b> MgF2 (with an index of 1.38), and fluoropolymers (which can have indices as low as 1.30, but are more difficult to apply). MgF2 on a crown glass surface gives a reflectance of about 1%, compared to 4% for bare glass. MgF2 coatings perform much better on higher-index glasses, especially those with index of refraction close to 1.9. MgF2 coatings are commonly used because they are cheap, and when they are designed for a wavelength {{in the middle of the}} visible band, they give reasonably good anti-reflection over the entire band. Researchers have produced films of mesoporous silica nanoparticles with refractive indices as low as 1.12, which function as antireflection coatings.|$|E

500|$|Construction of the Perkin-Elmer mirror {{began in}} 1979, {{starting}} with a blank manufactured by Corning from their ultra-low expansion glass. To keep the mirror's weight to a minimum it consisted of top and bottom plates, each one inch (25.4mm) thick, sandwiching a honeycomb lattice. Perkin-Elmer simulated microgravity by supporting the mirror from the back with 130 rods that exerted varying amounts of force. This ensured that the mirror's final shape would be correct and to specification when finally deployed. Mirror polishing continued until May 1981. NASA reports at the time questioned Perkin-Elmer's managerial structure, and the polishing began to slip behind schedule and over budget. To save money, NASA halted work on the back-up mirror and put the launch date of the telescope back to October 1984.
