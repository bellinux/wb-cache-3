25|$|Chemical {{coloring}} {{of metals}} {{is an art}} involving craftsmanship and experience. Coloring techniques depend upon time, temperature, surface preparation, humidity and other variables. Pre-patinated copper sheets are produced by fabricators under controlled environments using patented chemical processes. Green patina finishes are primarily developed using acid chloride or acid sulfate. Treatments with ammonium chloride (sal ammoniac), cuprous chloride/hydrochloric acid, and ammonium sulfate are somewhat successful. Statuary finishes can be produced in light, medium, and dark brown, depending on the concentration and number of coloring applications. One advantage is that the treatment disguises surface markings on bright <b>mill</b> <b>finish</b> copper and can advance the natural patination process.|$|E

50|$|<b>Mill</b> <b>finish</b> {{refers to}} the surface texture (or finish) of metal after it exits a rolling mill, {{extrusion}} die, or drawing processes, including sheet, bar, plate, or structural shapes.

Most <b>mill</b> <b>finish</b> surfaces are machined or treated with polishing, industrial etching, or some other surface finishing process before they are considered complete.|$|E

50|$|Surface {{finishing}} is a {{broad range}} of industrial processes that alter the surface of a manufactured item to achieve a certain property. Finishing processes may be employed to: improve appearance, adhesion or wettability, solderability, corrosion resistance, tarnish resistance, chemical resistance, wear resistance, hardness, modify electrical conductivity, remove burrs and other surface flaws, and control the surface friction. In limited cases some of these techniques can be used to restore original dimensions to salvage or repair an item. An unfinished surface is often called <b>mill</b> <b>finish.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Benjamin Obdyke Incorporated {{was started}} in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 1868 by Benjamin P. Obdyke after he {{returned}} from serving the Union Army in the American Civil War. [...] Obdyke invented and patented the round corrugated downspout, beginning {{a long tradition of}} manufacturing innovative quality building products. The company and product line grew over the years to include a variety of rain carrying equipment, roof edging and trims. The manufacturing process included roll formers and various stamping dies. The products were manufactured from Galvanized steel, copper and later aluminum (both pre painted and <b>mill</b> <b>finish).</b> By 1997 the company was operating 26 roll formers in a 200,000 sq. ft. manufacturing and distribution facility located in Warminster, Pennsylvania. In 1988 BOI acquired the patent for a rolled ridge vent, which began a new era of innovative products such as Roll Vent, Rapid Ridge, Cedar Breather, and eventually Home Slicker. In the late nineties the company was approached by another old line gutter manufacturer, Berger Brothers located in Feasterville, Pennsylvania with interest to acquire the metal manufacturing portion of the business. Based on the growth of the newer innovative products, the company decided to sell the metal business to Berger and did so in December 1997. Today, the company actively markets its ridge ventilation and moisture management products under the Benjamin Obdyke brand to professional contractors all over North America through their diverse network of wholesale distributors.|$|E
40|$|Aluminium alloys {{are being}} {{increasingly}} {{used in the}} automotive industry {{as a means of}} light-weighting the vehicle body to reduce emissions. The forming characteristics of aluminium alloys, however, differ from those of conventional deep-drawing quality materials, and the drive to reduce vehicle development times has led to reliance on simulation of forming operations to establish feasibility in the early design stages. It is known that friction has a major influence on the forming characteristics of a material and changes as the material plastically deforms and surface roughness increases, causing a transition from hydrodynamic to a mixed friction regime where metal to metal contact is increased. In the simulation environment however, friction is usually assumed to be constant. The development of higher strength alloys requiring higher forming forces suggest that a constant friction value may not always be a valid assumption. In this paper the friction behaviour of three commercially available automotive aluminium grades are compared, at different levels of strain, using a strip draw test. The results show that for a material with a standard <b>mill</b> <b>finish</b> friction is anisotropic, remaining so even at relatively high strains and the anisotropy is independent of the direction of strain. The friction coefficient increases with the level of strain but the use of solid wax lubricants helps to overcome this maintaining a uniform friction at strains up to 10 %. For aluminium with an EDT finish the roughening effects due to plastic strain are completely overcome and again a constant friction value is valid. In some alloys the formation of stretcher strains also help to reduce the metal to metal contact promoting hydrodynamic friction and a constant friction coefficient at lower strains...|$|E

Also on the property are two small, square brick structures with pyramidal roofs covered with pressed metal shingles. The mill produced damask which was shipped to New England for finishing.
