40|$|The aim of our {{experiments}} was {{to develop}} protocols {{that can be used}} to contain and eradicate spot infestations of P. cinnamomi that, if untreated, are likely to threaten extensive areas of native vegetation or areas of high conservation value. Treatment regimes were guided by two assumptions: 1) within the selected sites, transmission of the pathogen is by root-to-root contact, and 2) the pathogen is a weakly competitive saprotroph. In Western Australia (WA), treatment and control plots were set-up along an active disease front within scrub-heath vegetation dominated by Banksia spp. Treatments, applied sequentially and in combination, included: 1) destruction of the largest plants within disease free vegetation forward of the disease front; 2) destruction of all plants to create a ‘dead zone’; 3) installation of physical root barriers and subsurface irrigation for the application of fungicide/s; 4) surface applications of fungicides selective against oomycetes (triadiazole and metalaxyl-M), and 5) surface injection and deep (± 1 m) treatments with <b>Metham-sodium.</b> In a separate experiment in Tasmania (TAS), combined treatments including vegetation removal, Ridomil and <b>Metham-sodium</b> and root barriers, or Ridomil and root barriers alone, were applied to experimental plots within active disease centres in Eucalyptus-Banksia woodland. In the WA experiment, P. cinnamomi was not recovered (by soil baiting) from plots after treatment with Ridomil and <b>metham-sodium.</b> In the TAS experiment, similar results were achieved with combined treatments (vegetation removal + Ridomil + metham sodium) but in plots treated with Ridomil alone, recoveries of P. cinnamomi increased after initially showing a significant reduction in recoveries...|$|E

40|$|In 1984 - 85 <b>metham-sodium</b> and the {{combination}} of 1, 3 -dichloropropene plus aldicarb decreased (P = 0. 05) soil population densities of Pratylenchus penetrans at planting, midseason, and at harvest relative to the untreated control. These treatments increased (P = 0. 05) marketable potato tuber yield from 27 % to 46 % in 1984 and from 23 % to 37 % in 1985, {{as compared with the}} control. In 1984 oxamyl (10 % granular and 24 % liquid) applied immediately after planting increased (P = 0. 05) only the total yield; oxamyl applied 2 weeks after planting failed to control P. penetrans and to increase total or marketable yields. Oxamyl (10 G) applied 2 weeks after planting decreased (P = 0. 05) Pf. In 1985 oxamyl (10 G) reduced (P = 0. 05) P. penetrans population densities at midseason and harvest, whereas oxamyl (24 L) reduced only harvest population densities.

40|$|Sodium {{salicylate}} (1, 000 μg/ml) {{was delivered}} through a drip irrigation system to agricultural field soils planted to tomato and infested with Pseudomonas putida PpG 7, {{the host of}} the salicylate catabolic plasmid NAH 7. In nonfumigated soils infested with approximately 103 CFU of PpG 7 per g in the top 30 cm, population densities were increased up to 112 -fold within 14 days of the initial application of salicylate compared with the densities in the respective nonamended soils. Mean season-long population densities of PpG 7 in the top 30 cm of soil were significantly increased (P < 0. 01) from 216 CFU/g in nonamended soils to 1, 370 CFU/g in salicylate-amended soils. In the respective rhizosphere soils, mean population densities of PpG 7 were significantly increased (P < 0. 01) from 92 to 2, 066 CFU/cm of root. Soil fumigation interacted (P < 0. 01) with salicylate amendment and further increased the mean population densities of PpG 7 in nonrhizosphere soil by an additional 5, 689 CFU/g of soil. This fumigation effect was not detected in rhizosphere soils. The effect of salicylate in increasing population densities of PpG 7 in soil also was affected by inoculum level, field site, and soil depth. Proportionate differences were greater in soils infested with approximately 103 CFU of PpG 7 per g than in comparable soils infested with 105 CFU/g. In low-inoculum soils, increases from salicylate amendments were 26 - and 29 -fold in rhizosphere and nonrhizosphere soils, respectively, and in high-inoculum soils, the respective increases were 5. 6 - and 5 -fold. No increases of fungi able to utilize salicylate were detected in soils amended with salicylate. However, soil fumigation with <b>metham-sodium</b> significantly reduced (P < 0. 01) population densities of fungal salicylate utilizers in rhizosphere and nonrhizosphere soils...|$|E
