40|$|Yttrium monosilicate and {{disilicate}} {{are important}} materials for environmental barrier coatings. The two silicates were synthesized by sol-gel route and their phase selection upon calcination and thermal exposure was studied. First products of crystallization were the monosilicate and yttria. Amorphous silica precipitated out at 1300 degrees C as apatite phase. During prolonged high temperature treatment, up to 100 h at 1400 degrees C, the apatite disappeared and the disilicate appeared, only to disappear {{itself as the}} system approached equilibrium. Thermodynamic calculations performed using Thermo-Calc software show {{the presence of a}} metastable <b>miscibility</b> <b>gaps</b> in the amorphous (liquid) phase field. As a consequence, phase separation in the amorphous phase prior to crystallization is responsible for the formation of yttria-rich and silica-rich phases during crystallization. Multiple phase formation during both, yttrium monosilicate and disilicate synthesis is consistent with the presence of the amorphous phase <b>miscibility</b> <b>gaps</b> around the silicate compositions.

40|$|The complex {{interdigitated}} phases {{have greatly}} frustrated attempts {{to document the}} basic features of the superconductivity in the alkali metal intercalated iron chalcogenides. Here, using elastic neutron scattering, energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy, and resistivity measurements, we elucidate the relations of these phases in Rb_ 1 -δFe_ySe_ 2 -zS_z. We find: i) the iron content is crucial in stabilizing the stripe antiferromagnetic (AF) phase with rhombic iron vacancy order (y≈ 1. 5), the block AF phase with √(5) ×√(5) iron vacancy order (y≈ 1. 6), and the iron vacancy-free phase (y≈ 2); ii) the superconducting phase (z= 0) evolves into a metallic phase (z> 1. 5) with sulfur substitution due to the progressive decrease of the electronic correlation strength. Both the stripe AF phase and the block AF phase are Mott insulators. Our data {{suggest that there are}} <b>miscibility</b> <b>gaps</b> between these three phases.

Thermoresponsive polymers belong to the class of stimuli-responsive materials, in contrast to temperature-sensitive (for short, thermosensitive) materials, which change their properties continuously with environmental conditions.In a stricter sense, thermoresponsive polymers display a <b>miscibility</b> <b>gap</b> in their temperature-composition diagram. Depending on whether the <b>miscibility</b> <b>gap</b> is found at high or low temperatures, an upper or lower critical solution temperature exists, respectively (abbreviated UCST or LCST).Research mainly focuses on polymers that show thermoresponsivity in aqueous solution.

50|$|A {{consequence}} of the Flory-Huggins theory is, for instance, that the UCST (if it exists) increases and shifts into the solvent-rich region when the molar mass of the polymer increases.

It has to be noted that the interaction parameter not only comprises enthalpic contributions but also the non-ideal entropy of mixing, which again consists of many individual contributions (e.g., the strong hydrophobic effect in aqueous solutions).
