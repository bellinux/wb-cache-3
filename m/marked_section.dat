5000|$|Like its predecessors, Gears of War 3 is a third-person shooter that {{emphasizes}} the use of cover and squad tactics {{in order to survive}} combat situations. The player's character can carry four weapons: one pistol, one set of grenades, and two primary weapons. Firearms can be swapped with other weapons dropped by fallen foes or at stockpiles throughout the game, along with ammunition. When the player reloads a weapons ammunition, they have an opportunity for an [...] "active reload", shown by a small cursor moving over a line with a <b>marked</b> <b>section</b> on the player's heads-up display (HUD). If the player hits a control button when the cursor is in the <b>marked</b> <b>section,</b> they will reload faster with the resulting reload being slightly more powerful than normal bullets, causing more damage to opponents. If they press the button outside this section, this temporarily jams the weapon, leaving the player vulnerable and taking longer to reload. Alternatively, the player can opt to not try for the active reload, reloading the weapon at normal speed, but with no added damage.|$|E

50|$|The Mount Kembla Ring Track {{follows a}} course around the {{mountain}} {{starting from the}} Kembla Lookout carpark on Cordeaux Road. It goes down some stone steps into a gully that flows down into Dapto Creek and then goes along the southern {{side of the mountain}} through palm and fern growth before turning at a junction. At this junction there is one of two pit pony watering holes {{on the east side of}} the mountain. The right turnoff goes into private property on Farmborough Road, but the left goes north to the second watering hole and a mine entrance. Another deviation on this side goes to another mine entrance, both are closed due to tunnel collapse risk. From here it goes through more open canopied Sclerophyll growth before coming out at Cordeaux Road near private property, though the track is legal for walking as long as within this <b>marked</b> <b>section</b> one does not deviate from the track itself. To complete the walk one must go up the road back to the lookout. This is generally done as described in an anti-clockwise fashion.

Measurements on the MK 13 - 1, 13 - 2. and 13 - 2 A Torpedoes", file <b>marked</b> <b>Section</b> No 6. 1 -sr 207 - 1643, and dated June 23, 1944. It {{is a part of}} the program of investigation requested and authorized by Dr. E. H. Colpitts, Chief of Section 6. 1 of the National Defense Research Committee, in a letter dated October 8 1943. The preceding report, referred to hereafter as Report 1643, included measurements of the pressure distribution about the bare hull and about the hull with fins but without shroud ring tail. The tests reported herein cover pressure distribution measurements on the torpedo with fins and shroud ring tail. The main objective of these investigations was to determine whether or not the depth control mechanism is actuated by true hydrostatic pressure. This is of interest because the immersion mechanism can keep the torpedo at set depth only if it is actuated by true hydrostatic pressure of the water at the running depth, and if this pressure is unaffected by variations in speed and in yaw or pitch angles...|$|E

40|$|The High Speed Water Tunnel is {{operated}} by the California Institute of Technology under Contract OEMsr- 207 {{with the office of}} Scientific Research and Development and is sponsored by Division 6, Section 6. 1 of the National Defense Research Committee. This report covers a series of preliminary water tunnel tests of a model of the Mk 13 - 1, 13 - 2, and 13 - 2 A torpedoes with shroud ring tails added, and is a supplement to a previous report of this laboratory, entitled "Water Tunnel Tests of the Mk 1. 3 - 1, Mk 13 - 2, and Mk 13 - 2 A Torpedoes," file <b>marked</b> <b>Section</b> No. 6. 1 -sr- 207 - 936, and dated November 9, 1943. In the course of the investigation covered by the latter report, {{it was found that the}} torpedoes of this series are highly unstable and that they are controllable only within an extremely narrow range of angles of attack. The tests reported herein were, therefore, suggested by this laboratory, and were authorized by Dr. W. V. Houston, Director, Special Studies Group, Columbia University, Division of War Research. The objects of these tests were to investigate the possibilities for improving the stability and controllability of these torpedoes by the use of shroud ring tails, and to discover the trends of variation of these characteristics with variations of the several design factors of the shroud rings. Nine different shroud rings were tested with the torpedo model. It was found that marked improvement of the stability and control angle of these torpedoes may be obtained, without appreciable detriment to other characteristics, by the addition of shroud ring tails. The trends of variation of the stability, control angle, rudder effect, and drag of the torpedo with variations of the shroud ring design were clearly brought out. The results of these tests are shown in Figures 11 to 19, 21 and 22, and are summarized on pages 9 and 10 of this report...|$|E

40|$|The use {{of trade}} marks in keyword {{advertising}} {{has been one}} of the ‘hottest’ issues in intellectual property law for several years. This entirely new way of using trade marks as a targeting tool has provoked a discussion concerning the core concepts of trade mark law. This chapter discusses the issues of ‘trade <b>mark</b> use’ (<b>section</b> 5), the likelihood of confusion test (section 6), the protected functions of a trade <b>mark</b> (<b>section</b> 7), the protection of reputable <b>marks</b> (<b>section</b> 8), and the limitations to trade <b>mark</b> rights (<b>section</b> 9) in the context of keyword advertising. First, this paper will illuminate the functioning of keyword advertising and the various interests at stake (section 2). Thereafter, the structure of Art 5 TMD, as well as the underlying rationales and policy concerns of trade mark law will be addressed (sections 3 and 4). In addition to trade mark law, unfair competition law issues will briefly be pointed out (section 10). Furthermore, a number of national court decisions applying the guidance provided by the ECJ will be analyzed (section 11). The chapter concludes by arguing an approach towards the use of trade marks in keyword advertising which takes into account the freedoms of information and competition and which focuses on the prevention of consumer confusion (section 12) ...|$|R

40|$|Since 1940 {{the study}} of phage opened not only the {{beginning}} of co-operate study for physicists and chemists, but also the phage came to be clearified its character as the Bacterio Virus gradually. Then {{the study of}} phage made not a few contributions {{to the development of the}} study of Virus as model material of its kind. Now, these results are due to the endeavors of such scholars as Delbrück, Anderson, Cohen, Putznam, Doermann, Wyckoff and their co-operators mainly. Then, Charles. C. Shepard found out the characteristics of a distinctive nature in paperstrips in the course of investigations for the adsorptive behavior of Viruses. I tried some experiments in the paperchromatograph and capillarglass-chromatograph about the conditions that the phagef of coli-strains being adsorbed and recovered by paper and capillarglass. 1. The solvent employed here was 0. 1 % bovine serum albumin in 0. 1 M sodium chloride. 2. The solution employed was colibacteriophage diluted appropriately in the same solvent. 3. The adsorbent employed was Toyo-filterpaper and capillarglass which were treated previously by 0. 01 M hydrochloric acid and then washed by glasswather. 4. The experiments were carried out in an ice-box. At the beginning of an experiment a paperstrip was placed in the test tube so that it might not touch the sides, but touch the 20 ml. of solvent placed beforehand in the bottom of the tube. When the water front passed the second 1. 25 cm section, 0. 002 ml. of phage diluted in the same solvent appropriately as was placed in the bottom of the tube was quickly placed in the center of the second section and. the paper returned to the position in the tube. When the water front passed the last <b>marked</b> <b>section,</b> the paper was removed from the tube and ten marked sections were quickly cut off into their respective ten test tubes each containing of a culture of E. coli-strains. For a period of not more than 10 minutes, the ten sections of paper were stirred occasionally and pressed against the sides of the tubes. At the end of it, 0. 5 ml. were taken out and added it to 3. 0 ml. of 0. 7 % agar; the resultant 3. 5 ml. were mixed up and poured on a 1 %, agarplate. There was recovered viable phage in a considerable degree. 5. It seems to me that this recoveries of phage has been carried out due to the presence of bovine serum albumin. The chromatograph conducted here would seem to involbe the mixture of elution and displacement in the Terminology of Tiselius...|$|E
