5000|$|The aft storage bay, {{behind the}} crew couches. This housed the 70 mm camera equipment, the astronaut’s garments, tool sets, storage bags, a fire extinguisher, CO2 absorbers, sleep {{restraint}} ropes, spacesuit <b>maintenance</b> <b>kits,</b> 16mm camera equipment, and the contingency lunar sample container.|$|R
5000|$|The {{sighting}} line {{consists of}} a ∧-type post or an inverted [...] "V" [...] height adjustable front sight on a folding post and a leaf rear sight with an open V notch sliding on a ramp, graduated from 200 to 2,000 m. There is an antiaircraft rear peep sight hinged on the open rear sight base. An auxiliary anti-aircraft ring sight is kept in the <b>maintenance</b> <b>kit,</b> and fitting on the barrel jacket {{to be used in}} conjunction with the folding antiaircraft rear peep sight attached to the rear sight base.|$|E

50|$|Accessories {{supplied}} with the rifle include a 6H4 or 6H5 type bayonet, a quick-loading device, three spare magazines, four 15-round stripper clips, <b>maintenance</b> <b>kit,</b> cleaning rod and sling. The bayonet is installed by slipping the muzzle {{ring around the}} flash hider and latching the handle down on the bayonet lug under the front sight base. The 6H5 AK-74 bayonet introduced in 1983 represents a further refinement of the 6H4 AKM bayonet. It introduced a radical blade cross-section, that has a flat milled on one side near the edge and a corresponding flat milled {{on the opposite side}} near the false edge. The blade has a new spear point and an improved one-piece molded plastic grip making it a more effective fighting knife. It also has saw-teeth on the false edge and the usual hole for use as a wire-cutter.|$|E

50|$|The {{separation}} saw a large {{reduction in}} types, numbers and bases. In 1994, 3rd Corps of Tactical Aviation was created. The newest fighter in the Czechoslovak Air Force arsenal was the MiG-29 (Izdelie 9.12). As {{there was only}} one general <b>maintenance</b> <b>kit,</b> which was given to newly created Slovak Republic, and all the material was split 1:1 with Slovakia, maintenance costs for the Czech Fulcrums would be too high. Along with the unreasonably high costs, speculative costs for spare parts imported from Russia, which were realised through third-party companies (Mil Mi-24 rotor blades acquisitions were over-priced by 400%), led to exchange of 10 MiG-29s with Poland for PZL W-3A Sokół rescue helicopters with avionics and ground support. Therefore, 10 air superiority fighters were exchanged for 11 light helicopters and this acquisition became a strongly discussed affair around a half of 90s. The burden of readiness squadron passed to the MiG-23s. Those participated in air exercises with western air forces, where MiG-23MLs were capable of outperforming Mirage III, F1C, and 2000 and F-4F in vertical manoeuvering and acceleration and Mirage III, F1C and Phantom even in horizontal manoeuvering, while being outperformed by F-16A in all aspects and by Mirage 2000 in horizontal manoeuvering.|$|E
40|$|It is {{now widely}} {{accepted}} that the fine balance between {{hematopoietic stem cell}} (HSC) self-renewal and differentiation is required for blood cell homeostasis and is evidently orchestrated by the dynamic interplay between environmental cues and intrinsic genetic setup. Nevertheless, how the niche signal-initiated intracellular signaling cascades are regulated in HSCs is less understood. The Stem cell factor (SCF) /Kit system {{has served as a}} classical model in deciphering molecular signaling events in the hematopoietic compartment. It has long been known that the microenvironment, or the so- called niche, of Sl/Sl mouse (steel-Dickie mice) that harbors a mutation in membrane-bound SCF or Kit-ligand, is not capable of supporting normal HSC functions. Study of various white spotting (W) mutant mice revealed an essential role of SCF-Kit signaling in HSC survival and quiescence <b>maintenance.</b> <b>Kit</b> is now a most frequently used marker for HSCs and progenitors. However, it remains to be elucidated how Kit expression is regulated in HSCs. In this dissertation, we report that a cytoplasmic tyrosine phosphatase Shp 2, acting downstream of Kit, promotes Kit gene expression, constituting a Kit-Shp 2 -Kit signaling loop. Inducible ablation of none-receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase number 11 (PTPN 11 /Shp 2) in adult hematopoietic compartment led to severe cytopenia in bone marrow, spleen and peripheral blood in mice. Shp 2 removal resulted in elevated HSC death and loss of HSC quiescence, causing suppression of the functional HSCs/progenitors pool. Shp 2 - deficient HSCs failed to reconstitute lethally irradiated recipients in a cell autonomous manner due to combined defects in homing, self-renewal and survival. We show that Shp 2 regulates coordinately multiple signals, including AKT, MAPK and STAT 3 pathways, to promote Kit expression via the transcriptional factor Gata 2. Therefore, this study reveals a novel signaling mechanism of kinase- phosphatase-kinase cascade in HSCs/progenitors in adult mammal...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{wrestles with}} the on-orbit {{operational}} challenges {{introduced by the}} proposed Space Construction, Repair, and <b>Maintenance</b> (SCRAM) tool <b>kit</b> for Extra-Vehicular Activity (EVA). SCRAM undertakes a new challenging series of on-orbit tasks {{in support of the}} near-term Hubble Space Telescope, Extended Duration Orbiter, Long Duration Orbiter, Space Station Freedom, other orbital platforms, and even the future manned Lunar/Mars missions. These new EVA tasks involve welding, brazing, cutting, coating, heat-treating, and cleaning operations. Anticipated near-term EVA-SCRAM applications include construction of fluid lines and structural members, repair of punctures by orbital debris, refurbishment of surfaces eroded by atomic oxygen, and cleaning of optical, solar panel, and high emissivity radiator surfaces which have been degraded by contaminants. Future EVA-SCRAM applications are also examined, involving mass production tasks automated with robotics and artificial intelligence, for construction of large truss, aerobrake, and reactor shadow shield structures. Realistically achieving EVA-SCRAM is examined by addressing manual, teleoperated, semi-automated, and fully-automated operation modes. The operational challenges posed by EVA-SCRAM tasks are reviewed with respect to capabilities of existing and upcoming EVA systems, such as the Extravehicular Mobility Unit, the Shuttle Remote Manipulating System, the Dexterous End Effector, and the Servicing Aid Tool...|$|R
