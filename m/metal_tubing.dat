Fred's sister-in-law, Christine, would later recollect Rena was both depressed and extremely anxious as to her children's welfare. Being provided with Fred's Midland Road address, Rena sought to confront him—likely to discuss or demand custody of her daughters. This was the final time Rena was seen alive. She is believed to have been murdered by strangulation, possibly in the back seat of Fred's Ford Popular and likely while intoxicated. When her body was discovered, a short length of <b>metal</b> <b>tubing</b> was found with her remains, leaving an equal possibility she had been restrained and subjected to a sexual assault prior to her murder.

2500|$|A {{more complex}} {{version of a}} Tesla coil, termed a [...] "magnifier" [...] by Tesla, uses a more tightly coupled air-core {{resonance}} [...] "driver" [...] transformer (or [...] "master oscillator") and a smaller, remotely located output coil (called the [...] "extra coil" [...] or simply the resonator) that has {{a large number of}} turns on a relatively small coil form. The bottom of the driver's secondary winding is connected to ground. The opposite end is connected {{to the bottom of the}} extra coil through an insulated conductor that is sometimes called the transmission line. Since the transmission line operates at relatively high RF voltages, it is typically made of 1" [...] diameter <b>metal</b> <b>tubing</b> to reduce corona losses. Since the third coil is located some distance away from the driver, it is not magnetically coupled to it. RF energy is instead directly coupled from the output of the driver into the bottom of the third coil, causing it to [...] "ring up" [...] to very high voltages. The combination of the two-coil driver and third coil resonator adds another degree of freedom to the system, making tuning considerably more complex than that of a 2-coil system. The transient response for multiple resonance networks (of which the Tesla magnifier is a sub-set) has only recently been solved. It is now known that a variety of useful tuning [...] "modes" [...] are available, and in most operating modes the extra coil will ring at a different frequency than the master oscillator.|$|E

2500|$|Hoop {{earrings}} are circular or semi-circular in design, {{and look}} {{very similar to}} a ring. Hoop earrings generally {{come in the form}} of a hoop of metal that can be opened to pass through the ear piercing. They are often constructed of <b>metal</b> <b>tubing,</b> with a thin wire attachment penetrating the ear. [...] The hollow tubing is permanently attached to the wire at the front of the ear, and slips into the tube at the back. [...] The entire device is held together by tension between the wire and the tube. [...] Other hoop designs do not complete the circle, but penetrate through the ear in a post, using the same attachment techniques that apply to stud earrings. [...] A variation is the continuous hoop earring. [...] In this design, the earring is constructed of a continuous piece of solid metal, which penetrates through the ear and can be rotated almost 360°. [...] One of the ends is permanently attached to a small piece of metallic tubing or a hollow metallic bead. [...] The other end is inserted into the tubing or bead, and is held in place by tension. [...] One special type of hoop earring is the sleeper earring, a circular wire normally made of gold, with a diameter of approximately one centimeter. Hinged sleepers, which were common in Britain in the 1960s and 1970s, comprise two semi-circular gold wires connected via a tiny hinge at one end, and fastened via a small clasp at the other, to form a continuous hoop whose fastening mechanism is effectively invisible to the naked eye. Because their small size makes them unobtrusive and comfortable, and because they are normally otherwise unadorned, sleepers are so-called because they were intended to be worn at night to keep a pierced ear from closing, and were often the choice for the first set of earrings immediately following the ear piercing in the decades before ear-piercing guns using studs became commonplace, but are often a fashion choice in themselves because of their attractive simplicity and because they subtly call attention to the fact that the ear is pierced.|$|E

40|$|AbstractObjective to {{investigate}} the effect of clopidogrel combined with aspirin or aspirin alone on fibromyointimal hyperplasia (FIMH) in a bypass model with native vein grafts (NVG) and biocompound grafts (BCG). Design twelve Beagle dogs were randomised into two equal groups. In each animal NVG and a BCG were interposed in the common carotid arteries. Postoperatively, Group 1 received clopidogrel (200 mg/d) and aspirin (100 mg/d) and Group 2 received aspirin (100 mg/d) alone. Methods the BCG was constructed by sheathing the ipsilateral jugular vein with highly flexible <b>metal</b> mesh <b>tubing.</b> After 30 days the grafts were harvested and pressure fixed. FIMH was determined by morphometry. Results the average wall thickness of the BCG was significantly {{lower than that of}} the NVG in both groups (0. 26 (SD) 0. 02 mm vs 0. 47 (SD) 0. 15 mm, p = 0. 04 and 0. 28 (SD) 0. 05 mm vs 0. 70 (SD) 0. 29 mm, p = 0. 01, respectively). For BCG treated with aspirin, the wall cross section area was lower (5. 0 (SD) 0. 6 mm 2 vs 9. 1 (SD) 3. 3 mm 2, p = 0. 02) and the lumen larger (25. 2 (SD) 5. 9 mm 2 vs 9. 7 (SD) 3. 4 mm 2, p < 0. 01) than for the NVG. There was also a difference in the lumen cross section area of the NVG, which was larger after combined therapy with clopidogrel and aspirin (17. 9 (SD) 7. 8 mm 2 vs 9. 7 (SD) 3. 4 mm 2, p = 0. 04). Conclusions in this dog model the sheathing of vein grafts effectively prevents FIMH following bypass surgery. Clopidogrel is effective in NVG...|$|R

40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. December 2013. Major: Mechanical Engineering. Advisor: Ephraim M. Sparrow. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); vi, 138 pages. The research {{is motivated by}} the need to explore the inputs and mechanisms responsible for the creation of beneficial tribological coatings on medical grade silicone rubber tubing and how to quantify them. Despite the fact that biomedical conduits are routinely made lubricious by a host of different methods, there is an insufficiency in the present state of knowledge with regard to how to precisely quantify conduit bore lubricity. Test methods, newly invented, to characterize tubing bore lubricity are described in detail with greater emphasis on the extraction of coefficients of friction relative to historical testing methods. A new invention for characterizing the lubricity of biomedical conduits makes use of a pressure cuff or air-bladder to compress a plasma-treated silicone tubing sample onto a friction element. The instrument setup is a <b>metal</b> sliding-friction-element/silicone- <b>tubing</b> system. The tubing is stationary while the friction element that has been inserted into the tubing bore is pulled. The tubing is held in place with a known and regulated pressure, which allows the normal force pressing on the sliding component to be known. The pull force (tangential force) is registered and recorded using a commercial pull-test frame. Knowing the normal and tangential forces means that the coefficient of friction for the system can be extracted using this instrument. The running-in behavior observed during biomedical conduit friction assessment is quantified and a hypothesis regarding its source is set forth. The theme of the hypothesis is that material related to the constituents of silicone rubber is taken up by the friction element (coil, in this case) over several test cycles and thereby alters the system until it stabilizes. Subsequently, the coil becomes equilibrated with the chemical makeup of its environment, and this is why the resistance force stabilizes. The results of extensive experimentation showed that pristine coils displayed markedly more running-in phenomenon when compared to either an exercised coil or a stored-in-silicone tubing coil. The outcome of the thesis is a thorough understanding of tubing bore lubricity quantification...|$|R
40|$|When {{working in}} a laboratory, there are many {{apparatus}} configurations and procedures that {{require the use of}} a vacuum or the generation of a reduced pressure system. Weak points in the system can create implosion or explosion hazards. To ensure safe working conditions, use the universal work practices outlined below. Use Appropriate Tubing and Equipment Always use <b>tubing</b> (<b>metal,</b> thick walled rubber, etc.) that is rated for the appropriate pressure or vacuum conditions you will be using. Use tubing that is in good condition and free of cracks, holes, corrosion or other signs of degradation. Don’t use glassware that is thin, scratched or star-cracked. Avoid using round bottom flasks over 1000 mL in volume or glassware/equipment that is not approved for vacuum work. Check Your Connections Connections (ball joint, ground glass, etc.) between tubing and apparatus require clamping (keck, hose, pinch, etc.) to ensure system integrity. Make sure all connections are properly greased, lubricated or sealed. Vacuum trap with connections clamped (arrows). Trap inserted into dewar flask (with polyethylene netting) with lid covered (towel). Secure Traps Make sure to properly secure all traps and dewar flasks to avoid unnecessary movement that can cause glass breakage. Use Appropriate Sized Traps Always use appropriate sized traps when evaporating substances. Don’t use a small volume trap if the displaced material is of large volume. Use Iced Traps As Appropriate Always properly use iced traps to at least- 60 o C when operating a vacuum system. Cooling systems can be electrically refrigerated systems, liquid Nitrogen (see WARNING below) or traditional dry ice with isopropanol (- 78 o C). Dewar flasks (after trap insertion) must be full or more with coolant. When in use, dewar flasks should always be covered with foam, glass wool, towel, foil, etc. to minimize the evaporation of coolant...|$|R
