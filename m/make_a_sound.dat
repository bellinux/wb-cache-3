5|$|A noisy species, {{the female}} has the deep quack stereotypically {{associated}} with ducks. Male mallards <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>sound</b> phonetically {{similar to that}} of the female, a typical quack, but it is a deep and raspy and can also sound like breeeeze. When incubating a nest, or when offspring are present, females vocalise differently, making a call that sounds like a truncated version of the usual quack. They hiss if the nest or offspring are threatened or interfered with. When taking off, the wings of a mallard produce a characteristic faint whistling noise.|$|E

25|$|The Belgian UFO wave {{began in}} November 1989. The events of 29 November were {{documented}} by over thirty {{different groups of}} witnesses, and three separate groups of police officers. All of the reports related a large object flying at low altitude. The craft was of a flat, triangular shape, with lights underneath. This giant craft did not <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>sound</b> as it slowly moved across the landscape of Belgium. There was free sharing of information as the Belgian populace tracked this craft as it moved {{from the town of}} Liege to the border of the Netherlands and Germany.|$|E

500|$|At {{some time}} during the night of 24/25 November 1974, Nick Drake died at his home ("Far Leys") in Tanworth-in-Arden, from an {{overdose}} of amitriptyline, a type of antidepressant. He {{had gone to bed}} early after spending the afternoon visiting a friend. His mother said that around dawn he left his room for the kitchen. His family was used to hearing him do this many times before but, during this instance, he did not <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>sound.</b> They presumed he was eating a bowl of cereal. He returned to his room a short while later, and took some pills [...] "to help him sleep".|$|E

500|$|Crash {{confirmed}} rumours {{that the}} game was similar to Atic Atac, but declared Sabre Wulf the better and predicted {{that they would have}} similar legacies. The magazine wrote that their inability to intuit Sabreman's current inventory or resistance to damage added to the game's mystique, and that Ultimate was particularly skilled at not giving hints but leaving sufficient clues through the game's design. Personal Computer Games found one such tip: that the indigenous enemies <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>sound</b> when aligned with an amulet piece. In a similar experience, Popular Computing Weekly slowly learned to use rather than avoid the orchids. CVG described the game's instructions as [...] "cryptic". Crash later reflected that comparisons to Atic Atac at its launch were unfair, similar to calling any two text adventures identical.|$|E
500|$|Wolfenstein: The New Order {{makes use}} of an {{original}} score that reflects the alternative universe depicted in the game. [...] "We wanted to identify with different sounds that were kind of iconic, 1960s sounds, and then do our own twist on them to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>sound</b> authentic enough that it felt realistic," [...] said Hines. The team placed a high importance on the game's music. During the game's development, composer Mick Gordon traveled to Sweden {{to meet with the}} team, and he spotted the game over three days, partly collaborating with both Fredrik Thordendal and Richard Devine. Gordon expressed the difference in composing the soundtrack for Wolfenstein: The New Order compared to other games: [...] "Usually you sign onto a project and then you're given a list of 150 battle cues to do." ...|$|E
500|$|Pop {{music critic}} Robert Hilburn {{described}} [...] "Speechless", and another song from Invincible ("Butterflies"), as being [...] "as woefully generic as their titles". Ben Rayner of the Toronto Star contested that the acappellas in [...] "Speechless" [...] {{were enough to}} make a person wish that Jackson actually was unable to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>sound.</b> Michigan Daily writer Dustin J. Seibert wrote that the song was a [...] "shining [...] of what happens when The Gloved One gets beside himself and writes smarmy crap that should be reserved for a CD changer somewhere in a preschool". The Fort Worth Star-Telegram said that [...] "Speechless" [...] was one of the weaker tracks from Invincible. Elliot Sylvester of The Independent felt that the song was [...] "pure Jackson– almost to a formulaic fault". The Dallas Morning News Thor Christensen said that [...] "Speechless" [...] was [...] "produced by Mr. Jackson in bombastic style à la Celine Dion". He added that as the track ended with an emotional Jackson, it drew a parallel with the singer's 1972 ode to a rat, [...] "Ben".|$|E

500|$|According to Neil Finn, [...] "It (Time on Earth) doesn't {{sound like}} any one {{particular}} Crowded House album, {{but it has}} elements of Crowded House... {{in as much as}} Nick and I <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>sound</b> together when we play and always did. I think there's a lot of heart and spirit in the album which is connected with the loss of our dear friend Paul but also an attempt to try and make sense of it and move forward. And as such, it seemed the most obvious and {{best way to do that}} was to be playing music again with each other, Nick and I. I want to be in a band and what other band could it be." [...] Crowded House's leader, Neil Finn has indicated that, as the album began life as a solo project, its sound is generally different from Crowded House, though similar in parts, indicating that no one album by the group sounds like this one. As the album is dedicated to Hester and attends to his death, much of the album has a mournful tone, however this has been received well by critics, with some indicating that [...] "fortunately, Finn is a master at expressing ambiguity, (both) lyrically and musically". Finn has said of the song [...] "People Are Like Suns", that [...] "Part of it is the idea that people burn brightly and then they fade out. Also, when I wrote it, I was reading Ian McEwan's novel Saturday, which begins with a man on his balcony watching his plane go down, so the first lines borrow something from that image." ...|$|E
500|$|In some species, for example, either remiges or rectrices <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>sound</b> during flight. [...] These {{sounds are}} most often {{associated}} with courtship or territorial displays. The outer primaries of male broad-tailed hummingbirds produce a distinctive high-pitched trill, both in direct flight and in power-dives during courtship displays; this trill is diminished when the outer primaries are worn, and absent when those feathers have been moulted. [...] During the northern lapwing's zigzagging display flight, the bird's outer primaries produce a humming sound. [...] The outer primaries of the male American woodcock are shorter and slightly narrower {{than those of the}} female, and are likely the source of the whistling and twittering sounds made during his courtship display flights. [...] Male club-winged manakins use modified secondaries to make a clear trilling courtship call. [...] A curve-tipped secondary on each wing is dragged against an adjacent ridged secondary at high speeds (as many as 110 times per second—slightly faster than a hummingbird's wingbeat) to create a stridulation much like that produced by some insects. Both Wilson's and common snipe have modified outer tail feathers which make noise when they are spread during the birds' roller coaster display flights; as the bird dives, wind flows through the modified feathers and creates a series of rising and falling notes, which is known as [...] "winnowing". [...] Differences between the sounds produced by these two former conspecific subspecies—and the fact that the outer two pairs of rectrices in Wilson's snipe are modified, while only the single outermost pair are modified in common snipe—were among the characteristics used to justify their splitting into two distinct and separate species.|$|E
500|$|One {{to three}} eggs, {{normally}} two, are laid, {{with the second}} egg being laid between 24 and 48hours after the first. The eggs are variable in coloration and can be a light yellow-brown with dark brown blotches, creamy white with dark brown or grey blotches, or pale grey with brown mottling. The eggs weigh about [...] and have an average size of [...] by [...] The rockfowl begins to incubate after both eggs are laid. The time the rockfowl spends incubating varies greatly, though it is mostly for {{less than five minutes}} at a time with nearly two hours between sessions. Both the male and female rockfowl incubate. When the incubating bird's mate comes, it gives a brief call that causes the incubating bird to leave the nest. In the two days prior to hatching, the adult rockfowl prods at the eggs, sometimes with food in its beak. Incubation lasts for 21 to 24 days. When the infants hatch, they hatch about a day apart. The adult rockfowl quickly remove the eggshell fragments from the nest. The newborn weighs only [...] after hatching, but it quickly gains weight. The eyes open and the tail begins to grow on the fifth day. During the first couple of days, food is brought to the nestlings three to six times an hour, peaking in the evening. Begging nestlings expose their beak and gape to their parent, though they do not <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>sound.</b> The second-hatched nestling often fails to gain weight and dies, and there is evidence suggesting that the adults cannibalize the remains. For the first ten days after hatching, one adult rockfowl stays and guards the nestlings while the other collects food; despite this, nests have been destroyed by chimpanzees and drills. The chicks leave the nest after 24 days. Infanticide has been recorded in this species, with rockfowl killing other rockfowl's young. In one case, a second pair of rockfowl moved onto a nest after killing the first pair's nestlings.|$|E
