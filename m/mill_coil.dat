50|$|Hot Strip Mill-The {{facilities}} of the 1.44 MT {{per annum}} mill has :Two new walking beam type reheating furnace (225 TPH) Roughing/sizing stand RoVo with automationAutomated coil boxQuick roll change system in Roughing Stand-1 and finishing <b>mills</b> <b>Coil</b> marking, sampling and conveying systems.|$|R
50|$|The metal {{substrate}} (steel or aluminum) {{is delivered}} in coil form from the rolling <b>mills.</b> <b>Coil</b> weights vary from 5-6 tons for aluminum {{and up to}} about 25 tons for steel. The coil is positioned {{at the beginning of}} the line, then unwound at a constant speed, passing through the various pre-treatment and coating processes before being recoiled. Two strip accumulators at the beginning and the end of the line enable the work to be continuous, allowing new coils to be added (and finished coils removed) by a metal stitching process without having to slow down or stop the line.|$|R
5000|$|CRGO {{is usually}} {{supplied}} by the producing <b>mills</b> in <b>coil</b> form {{and has to be}} cut into [...] "laminations", which are then used to form a transformer core, which {{is an integral part of}} any transformer. Grain-oriented steel is used in large power and distribution transformers and in certain audio output transformers.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. A {{numerical}} simulation of phase transformation for hot-rolled strip on run-out-table are {{introduced in the}} present work combined with experiment. Continuous-cooling-transformation (CCT) diagram are used to regress the transformation model of Q 345 B. Temperature field coupled with phase transformation is analyzed on run-out-table. Evolution of temperature and organization during cooling are analyzed for the hot-rolled strip between the last stand of finishing <b>mill</b> and <b>coiling.</b> It is concluded that the transverse temperature has {{significant effect on the}} uniformity of phase transformation...|$|R
50|$|Slabs are {{the feed}} {{material}} for hot strip mills or plate mills and blooms are rolled to billets in a billet mill or large sections in a structural mill. The output from a strip <b>mill</b> is <b>coiled</b> and, subsequently, used as the feed for a cold rolling mill or used directly by fabricators. Billets, for re-rolling, are subsequently rolled in either a merchant, bar or rod mill. Merchant or bar mills produce a variety of shaped products such as angles, channels, beams, rounds (long or coiled) and hexagons.|$|R
50|$|Stainless steel’s {{resistance}} to corrosion and staining, low maintenance, and familiar lustre make it an ideal material for many applications. The alloy is <b>milled</b> into <b>coils,</b> sheets, plates, bars, wire, and tubing {{to be used in}} cookware, cutlery, household hardware, surgical instruments, major appliances, industrial equipment (for example, in sugar refineries) and as an automotive and aerospace structural alloy and construction material in large buildings. Storage tanks and tankers used to transport orange juice and other food are often made of stainless steel, because of its corrosion resistance. This also influences its use in commercial kitchens and food processing plants, as it can be steam-cleaned and sterilized and does not need paint or other surface finishes.|$|R
50|$|The {{station is}} divided into two parts: the {{passenger}} station and the adjacent freight yard to its south. Here, regional freight traffic from Haiger and Dillenburg stations is consolidated and linked to the national transport network via the Wetzlar and Kreuztal freight yards. Dillenburg freight yard is also of great importance for the supply of the local ThyssenKrupp Nirosta steel <b>mill</b> with steel <b>coils,</b> delivered every day except Thursday in a single train from the Ruhr area (especially Bochum).|$|R
50|$|The {{first stage}} of {{redevelopment}} was completed in 1957 {{at a cost of}} c. 400 million Deutschmarks, giving a capacity of c.600,000 tons steel pa. Facilities included three open hearth steelmaking furnaces, a hot rolling <b>mill</b> for <b>coil</b> and sheets, and a tinplate plant. In 1960 the board at Klockner authorised a second phase (200 million Deutschmarks) to increase capacity to 1 million tons. In 1960 the ultimate aim was to develop the site as a full steel mill with a production capacity of 4 to 5 million tons steel pa. By the 1960s the workforce had risen to 6,000, manly of the new workers were immigrants, predominately from Turkey. Second and third blast furnaces were complete in the mid-1960s and early-1970s respectively; Linz-Donawitz process steelmaking converters were added in 1968 at a cost of 92 million Deutschmarks.|$|R
50|$|Coil tubing {{has also}} {{been used as a}} cheaper version of work-over operations. It is used to perform open hole {{drilling}} and <b>milling</b> operations. Common <b>coiled</b> tubing steels have yield strengths ranging from 55,000 PSI to 120,000 PSI so it {{can also be used to}} fracture the reservoir, a process where fluid is pressurised to thousands of psi on a specific point in a well to break the rock apart and allow the flow of product. Coil tubing can perform almost any operation for oil well operations if used correctly.|$|R
50|$|MSC’s {{iron ore}} (raw material) comes from mines in Golgohar and Chadermaloo (Kerman and Yazd provinces) and are {{converted}} to pellets in the pelletizing plant (diameters: 8-10 mm). After being reduced in the direct reduction (DR) plant and removed of oxygen, pellets are converted to (sponge iron). Sponge iron and iron scrap is melted in electric arc furnaces, after which liquid steel is purified in secondary purification units. The steel’s chemical compound is designed by customer demand. Then, it is transported to casting machines for slab production. After cooling, slab is rolled at the hot rolling <b>mill,</b> creating hot <b>coils</b> (thickness: 1.5-16 mm). Some are sold; others {{go to the}} hot finishing mill for complementary work and hot sheet transformation or the cold rolling mill to lower strip thickness to 0.18 mm. Cold rolled coils are also dedicated for the tinning, galvanizing, and prepainting lines.|$|R
