When Kennedy asked if Nhu would blame the US for any resulting military deterioration, Phillips replied that the ARVN would revolt, because the ARVN officers who were on Viet Cong hit lists would not allow the communists to run loose. Phillips said that if Nhu tried to divert military aid away from the troops to prop up his personal schemes, the Americans could deliver the money straight to the countryside in suitcases.|$|E

Shannon refuses to leave with Boone. He realizes that Shannon lied to him to get the money, and she has done this all the other times he had to pay off her boyfriends. Bryan says that Boone's mother stole <b>money</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> her, and she is getting what is {{rightfully}} hers. After a brief fight with Bryan in which he is beaten, Boone leaves. That night, a drunk Shannon comes to Boone's hotel room and tells him that Bryan stole the money. She tells Boone that she knows he loves her and, although he first tries to refuse her advances, they sleep together. Later, Shannon persuades Boone not to tell their parents.|$|E

A high level of official corruption siphoning <b>money</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> civil servants, soldiers and infrastructure projects causes further instability.|$|E

25|$|The MRAP {{program has}} been criticized for its high, nearly $50billion cost, the {{potential}} logistical difficulties due to high fuel consumption and varied designs, a greater disconnection between troops and the local population due to MRAPs' massive size and menacing appearance conflicting with current counter-insurgency (COIN) strategy, and unclear disposal. In 2007, it was unknown what the U.S. military would do with MRAPs following its withdrawal from Iraq, since they are expensive to transport and operate. MRAP funding has pulled <b>money</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> other tactical vehicle programs, most noticeably the Humvee replacement, the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle, which has been delayed by two years.|$|E
25|$|Coin {{certification}} {{has greatly}} {{reduced the number}} of counterfeits and grossly overgraded coins, and improved buyer confidence. Certification services can sometimes be controversial because grading is subjective; coins may be graded differently by different services or even upon resubmission to the same service. The numeric grade alone does not represent all of a coin's characteristics, such as toning, strike, brightness, color, luster, and attractiveness. Due to potentially large differences in value over slight differences in a coin's condition, some submitters will repeatedly resubmit a coin to a grading service in the hope of receiving a higher grade. Because fees are charged for certification, submitters must funnel <b>money</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> purchasing additional coins.|$|E
500|$|Van Buren, {{faced with}} the {{economic}} Panic of 1837, caused in part by {{lack of confidence in}} private bank note issues after Jackson had instructed the government to only accept gold or silver, called a special session of Congress. [...] Government money had been held in so-called [...] "pet banks" [...] since Jackson had withdrawn it from the Second Bank; Van Buren proposed to place funds in sub-treasuries, government depositories that would not lend money. Believing that government funds should be lent to develop the country, Fillmore felt this would lock the nation's limited supply of gold <b>money</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> commerce. Van Buren's sub-treasury and other economic proposals passed, but as hard times continued, the Whigs saw an increased vote in the 1837 elections, and captured the New York Assembly. This set up a fight for the 1838 gubernatorial nomination. Fillmore supported the leading Whig vice presidential candidate from 1836, Francis Granger; Weed preferred Seward. Fillmore was embittered when Weed got the nomination for Seward, but campaigned loyally; Seward was elected, while Fillmore won another term in the House.|$|E

500|$|In May 2002, {{the club}} was rebranded York City Soccer Club as part of Batchelor's plan to market it in the United States. Persimmon, which had bought 10% of the shares in BCH, {{submitted}} planning applications for 93 homes {{on the site of}} Bootham Crescent, and Batchelor spoke of building York a new stadium at Clifton Moor. The club entered a creditors' voluntary agreement in November 2002, and the York Evening Press said York had been [...] "plunged into the darkest, coldest days of its history". The club went into administration in December 2002, and was given five weeks to find a buyer or face bankruptcy. The ST donated £92,000 to give the club a temporary reprieve. The ST took control over the club in March 2003 after the Inland Revenue accepted an offer of £100,000 as payment for £160,000 owed in tax. Steve Beck became the new chairman. Batchelor had diverted almost all of the £400,000 Persimmon sponsorship <b>money</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> York to his racing team, and his promise of having ST members on the board never materialised. He left the club with a profit of £120,000 and admitted to asset stripping during his time as owner. Despite the off-field problems, York pushed for promotion in 2002–03 and were in an automatic promotion place by late March 2003. They won none of their last six matches and finished the season in 10th place.|$|E

[...] The Institute's strategy is to move, relentlessly, from standards battles, to curriculum writing, to textbook adoption, and back again doing whatever it takes to undermine the central position of evolution in biology.

Chavous dismissed the outcome, calling the vote [...] "a sham". As the primary approached on September 14, the Post called the election the closest since Chavous defeated Crawford in 1992. Voter sentiment seemed to focus on the 2003–2004 Board of Education reform debate, with voters blaming Chavous for the long debate—which, many said, discouraged the two leading candidates for superintendent to drop out. Gray also hammered Chavous on his support for the federal voucher program, which he claimed took <b>money</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> public schools. Chavous argued that he had helped improve the delivery and amount of city services, was critical in winning construction of two new public schools in Ward 7, and that he had brought economic development to the area by shepherding the redevelopment of the Skyland shopping mall.

Mona was the only musician’s friend or spouse to travel with the band. She was a trusted confidant who was known for her discretion, and she quickly became a valuable resource for the musicians. [...] When the band was crossing the country doing a series of one-nighters, Mona was instrumental in arranging lodging and food for the musicians. [...] She would often go to the African-American section of town and find several women {{who were willing to}} cook for the band. [...] She would pay for the food, organize the cooks, and have the food packed and delivered to the performance venue in time for intermission. [...] Since this was the height of the Jim Crow era, and since many of the towns were too small to have hotels that allowed African-Americans, Mona would frequently make arrangements for band members to sleep in local homes. She also helped musicians in the band manage their money, often insisting that they open savings accounts. [...] As she put it, “I was like the den mother.

50|$|Because of the {{multiplier}} effect, it {{is possible}} to change aggregate demand (Y) keeping a balanced budget.

Since only part of the <b>money</b> taken <b>away</b> <b>from</b> households would have actually been used in the economy, the change in consumption expenditure will be smaller than the change in taxes. Therefore, the money which would have been saved by households is instead injected into the economy, itself becoming part of the multiplier process.

Grade was also determined to end the dated and inept BBC1 scheduling which was hampering the network and which was holding back good programmes. Grade stated [...] "When I took over BBC1, I discovered there were wonderful things, it was just a case of where to put them." [...] Wogan had been scheduled for a 10pm slot, but Grade moved it to a 7pm slot as he believed the show had potential.

Further improvement come about when the corporation strengthened its drama output costing £30 million, with eight new series, including Howards' Way, All Creatures Great and Small, Hold the Back Page, and Bluebill, along with the return of Bergerac and Big Deal. The increase in the drama department was achieved by switching the <b>money</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the administrative service over a three-year period, after BBC1 was criticised, for failing in matching ITV's output in drama.
