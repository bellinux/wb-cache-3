500|$|Roughly {{twenty-four hours}} {{after the death of}} Francisco Rafael, the Mexican federal police arrested Manuel Aguirre Galindo (alias [...] "El Caballo" [...] – [...] "The Horse"), a founder of the Tijuana Cartel and a {{high-ranking}} leader and money launderer who had been a fugitive for more than 20 years, in Mexico City. It is unknown who notified the authorities of his whereabouts but they allege that they were either notified by a rival gang or by members of the Arellano Félix clan. Among the hypotheses presented by Zeta, a Tijuana-based magazine known for its investigative reports on the Tijuana Cartel, are as followed: (1) shortly after the murder of Francisco Rafael, the police interrogated his family and several of the party invitees, who may have proportionated information that led to Aguirre Galindo's arrest, given that the drug lord was allegedly responsible for providing security to Francisco Rafael; (2) the other hypothesis is that Aguirre Galindo's location was tipped by members of the Tijuana Cartel who were <b>mad</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> for failing to protect Francisco Rafael.|$|E

On he went until he'd finished a small leg o' pork, two wild-ducks, six plover, eight mugs o' tea, an' fifteen hard-boiled eggs. But {{there was no sign}} o' bu'stin'. Glutton was as slim to look at as before he began. At this pint Samson got up an' went out o' the hut. In a minute or so he came back with a bark basket quite shallow, but about fourteen inches square, an' full of all kinds of eggs--for the wild-birds was breedin' at the time. `What's that for?' says we. `For Glutton, when he's ready for 'em,' says he. `There's six dozen here, an' if that don't do it, I've got another basket ready outside.' With that he sets the basket down in front o' the Injin, who just gave a glance at it over a goose drumstick he was tearin' away at. Well, Samson turned round to sit down in his place again, when somethin' or other caught hold of his foot tripped him up, an' down he sat squash! into the basket of eggs. You niver did see sich a mess! There was sich a lot, an' Samson was so heavy, that the yolks squirted up all round him, an' a lot of it went slap into some of our faces. For one moment we sat glarin', we was so took by surprise, and Glutton was so tickled that he gave a great roar of laughter, an' swayed himself from side to side, an' fore an' aft like a Dutchman in a cross sea. Of course we joined him. We couldn't help it, but we was brought up in the middle by Samson sayin', while he scraped himself, `Well, boys, I've won.' `Won!' says I, `how so? He ain't bu'sted yet.' `Hasn't he?' cried Samson. `Hasn't he gone on eatin' till he bu'sted out larfin?' We was real <b>mad</b> <b>at</b> <b>'im,</b> for a' course that wasn't the kind o' bu'stin we meant; and the end of it was, that we spent the most o' that night disputin' the pint whether Samson had lost or won. We continued the dispute every night for a month, an' sometimes had a free fight over it by way of a change, but I don't think it was ever settled. Leastways it wasn't up to the time when I left the country." ...|$|R
