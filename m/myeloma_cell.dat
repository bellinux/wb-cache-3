40|$|Introduction: Multiple myeloma is a {{plasma cell}} {{malignancy}} that causes extensive osteolytic bone disease. Present treatments target end stage disease but understanding how bone lesions are initiated may offer {{new approaches to}} prevent/suppress colonization. It is clear that <b>myeloma</b> <b>cells</b> form specific interactions with the bone microenvironment, where they can remain dormant and protected from current therapy to eventually proliferate and cause disease progression. N-cadherin is an adhesion molecule that has been implicated in the localization of haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) to ‘niches’ containing osteoblasts on endosteal bone surfaces. In this study, we have tested the hypothesis that <b>myeloma</b> <b>cells</b> utilise N-cadherin to adhere to osteoblasts in vitro and in vivo during the colonization into the bone. Findings: N-cadherin mRNA and protein were expressed by osteoblasts and <b>myeloma</b> <b>cells.</b> We showed focal expression of N-cadherin in <b>myeloma</b> <b>cells,</b> whereas expression was observed contiguously on the membranes of adjacent osteoblasts. N-cadherin expression significantly increased during osteoblastogenesis. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated staining of N-cadherin when <b>myeloma</b> <b>cells</b> were in contact with osteoblasts in vitro and in vivo. Blocking N-cadherin mediated interactions, using specific antibodies against N-cadherin, significantly reduced adherence of <b>myeloma</b> <b>cells</b> to osteoblasts in vitro. Attempts were made to block the adhesion of <b>myeloma</b> <b>cells</b> to bone cells in calvarial bones in vivo. These studies were in conclusion suggested {{that there may be}} a role of N-cadherin in these interactions. Conclusion: These studies provide evidence that adherence of <b>myeloma</b> <b>cells</b> to osteoblasts is mediated by N-cadherin in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that <b>myeloma</b> <b>cells</b> may occupy a niche similar to that used by HSCs in bone...|$|R

50|$|Pomalidomide {{directly}} inhibits angiogenesis and <b>myeloma</b> <b>cell</b> growth.

40|$|Autologous {{stem cell}} {{transplantation}} and novel therapies have improved overall survival {{of patients with}} multiple myeloma; however, most patients relapse and eventually succumb to their disease. Evidence indicates that residual cancer cells contaminate autologous grafts and may contribute to early relapses after autologous stem cell transplantation. Here, we demonstrate that ex vivo treatment with an oncolytic poxvirus called myxoma virus results in specific elimination of human <b>myeloma</b> <b>cells</b> by inducing rapid cellular apoptosis while fully sparing normal hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. The specificity of this elimination is based on strong binding of the virus to <b>myeloma</b> <b>cells</b> coupled with an inability of the virus to bind or infect CD 34 + hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. These 2 features allow myxoma to readily identify and distinguish even low levels of <b>myeloma</b> <b>cells</b> in complex mixtures. This ex vivo rabbit-specific oncolytic poxvirus called myxoma virus treatment also effectively inhibits systemic in vivo engraftment of human <b>myeloma</b> <b>cells</b> into immunodeficient mice and results in efficient elimination of primary CD 138 + <b>myeloma</b> <b>cells</b> contaminating patient hematopoietic cell products.

The present studies demonstrate that peptide inhibitors of MUC 1 -C oligomerization block growth of human multiple <b>myeloma</b> <b>cells</b> in vitro. Inhibition of MUC 1 -C function also blocked the interaction between MUC 1 -C and NF-κB p 65 and activation of the NF-κB pathway. In addition, inhibition of MUC 1 -C in multiple <b>myeloma</b> <b>cells</b> was associated with activation of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway and induction of late apoptosis/necrosis.

5000|$|Laboratory animals (mammals, e.g. mice) {{are first}} {{exposed to the}} antigen that an {{antibody}} is to be generated against. Usually this is done {{by a series of}} injections of the antigen in question, {{over the course of several}} weeks. These injections are typically followed by the use of in vivo electroporation, which significantly enhances the immune response. Once splenocytes are isolated from the mammal's spleen, the B cells are fused with immortalised <b>myeloma</b> <b>cells.</b> The fusion of the B <b>cells</b> with <b>myeloma</b> <b>cells</b> can be done using electrofusion. Electrofusion causes the B <b>cells</b> and <b>myeloma</b> <b>cells</b> to align and fuse with the application of an electric field.

5000|$|Hybridoma {{technology}} is a method for producing large numbers of identical antibodies (also called monoclonal antibodies). This process starts by injecting a mouse (or other mammal) with an antigen that provokes an immune response. A type of white blood cell, the B cell that produces antibodies that bind to the antigen are then harvested from the mouse. These isolated B cells are in turn fused with immortal B cell cancer cells, a myeloma, to produce a hybrid cell line called a hybridoma, which has both the antibody-producing ability of the B-cell and the exaggerated longevity and reproductivity of the myeloma. The hybridomas can be grown in culture, each culture starting with one viable hybridoma cell, producing cultures each of which consists of genetically identical hybridomas which produce one antibody per culture (monoclonal) rather than mixtures of different antibodies (polyclonal). The <b>myeloma</b> <b>cell</b> line that is used in this process is selected {{for its ability to}} grow in tissue culture and for an absence of antibody synthesis.

40|$|Interactions between <b>myeloma</b> <b>cells</b> and {{cells of}} the bone marrow {{microenvironment}} lead to osteoclast activation and osteoblast inhibition (uncoupling), resulting in lytic bone lesions. We could show that <b>myeloma</b> <b>cells</b> express RANKL, a potent stimulator of osteoclast activity, and that the expression of RANKL correlates with osteolytic bone disease. In addition, <b>myeloma</b> <b>cells</b> induce RANKL expression by stromal cells and lead to degradation and reduced expression of the RANKL antagonist OPG. Furthermore, we could show that <b>myeloma</b> <b>cells</b> produce DKK- 1, an inhibitor of Wnt/ ß catenin signalling pathway, which is crucial for osteoblast differentiation, and that serum DKK- 1 is elevated in myeloma patients and correlates with the extend of bone disease.

The proteasome inhibitor bortezomib is another drug that could influence bone metabolism in myeloma patients.

40|$|AbstractThe {{proteasome}} inhibitor bortezomib is clinically {{approved for}} the treatment of multiple myeloma. However, long-term remissions are difficult to achieve, and <b>myeloma</b> <b>cells</b> often develop secondary resistance to proteasome inhibitors. We recently demonstrated that the extraordinary sensitivity of <b>myeloma</b> <b>cells</b> toward bortezomib is dependent on their extensive immunoglobulin synthesis, thereby triggering the terminal unfolded protein response (UPR). Here, we investigated whether verapamil, an inhibitor of the multidrug resistance (MDR) gene product, can enhance the cytotoxicity of bortezomib. The combination of bortezomib and verapamil synergistically decreased the viability of <b>myeloma</b> <b>cells</b> by inducing cell death. Importantly, bortezomib-mediated activation of major UPR components was enhanced byverapamil. The combination of bortezomib and verapamil resulted in caspase activation followed by poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage, whereas nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) activity declined in <b>myeloma</b> <b>cells.</b> Also, we found reduced immunoglobulin G secretion along with increased amounts of ubiquitinylated proteins within insoluble fractions of <b>myeloma</b> <b>cells</b> when using the combination treatment. Verapamil markedly induced reactive oxygen species production and autophagiclike processes. Furthermore, verapamil decreased MDR 1 expression. We conclude that verapamil increased the antimyeloma effect of bortezomib by enhancing ER stress signals along with NF-κB inhibition, leading to cell death. Thus, the combination of bortezomib with verapamil may improve the efficacy of proteasome inhibitory therapy...|$|R
