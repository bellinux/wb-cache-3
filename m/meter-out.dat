40|$|To {{decrease}} throttling {{losses in}} mobile hydraulic systems {{a number of}} new system architectures have been introduced in recent years. The concept of independent metering (IM), developed in the seventies, shows a lot of promise [1]. By allowing the meter-in as well as <b>meter-out</b> edges to be controlled separately, additional operating modes are created allowing a more efficient adaptation of system pressure to load pressure [2, 3]. Despite these advantages IM circuits have yet to find their way into industrial applications. This is mainly due to the related increase in component costs and more demanding control strategies. Additionally, the effect of mode switching on actuator motion and operator comfort is still unclear and considered to be a challenge. The STEAM mobile hydraulic system currently being developed in Aachen, Germany uses {{a number of new}} features to improve total machine efficiency [4]. Among others is the use of a new independent metering circuit called single edge <b>meter-out</b> control.

40|$|The lack of {{position}} or velocity feedback {{is a very}} common problem particularly on construction equipment such as excavators and backhoes. The extra cost of adding position/velocity sensors is prohibitive {{as well as the}} high likelihood of sensor failure in such a harsh environment. These factors make the possibility of improving control performance with limited sensory feedback very attractive. This paper studies the velocity control of a single-rod double actuating hydraulic cylinder utilizing a programmable valve with only cylinder pressure feedback. The boom motion control of a scaled-down model of an industrial backhoe loader arm is used as a case study.

The <b>meter-out</b> port {{of such a}} valve arrangement interconnects to the ERS that consists of a rotary hydraulic machine controlling the port pressure. The emphasis is on reducing the losses in overrunning load conditions and parallel actuation of multiple loads. In such load cases, the pressure drop across the valve is relocated to the hydraulic machine within the ERS.

First of all, the energy consumption of a traditional load sensing architecture, which uses a single electronically controlled spool valve, is analyzed. For this kind of circuit, {{the position of the}} spool generally determines, at the same time, pressure drops both at the inlet and at the outlet section. The consequence is that in the majority of the situations both the meter-in and the <b>meter-out</b> configuration is not optimized in terms of energy consumption. An alternative architecture, with an independent metering configuration, based on a pressure based control strategy is analyzed and modelled.

40|$|Abstract — In the {{pneumatic}} synchronization {{system based}} on separate control of meter-in and <b>meter-out,</b> both motion trajectory and pressure trajectory could be tracked in a single pneumatic cylinder and then the cylinder could be controlled completely without internal dynamics. In this paper, an adaptive robust pressure controller is used to keep the pressure level in chamber of cylinder {{on an even keel}} when the pneumatic cylinder is moving, which will result in small variation of cylinder’s friction force and facilitate the precise modeling of friction force, and an adaptive robust motion controller is designed to improve the motion tracking accuracy of pneumatic cylinder, and on-line parameter estimation of the flow coefficient is utilized to have improved model compensation, and moreover a synchronization controller is added to further reduce the synchronization error. Experimental results demonstrate that this synchronization strategy could not only make two cylinders synchronized moving accurately, but also obtain very smooth control inputs which indicate the effectiveness of model compensation.

40|$|When the {{difference}} of pressures between inlet cylinder chamber and exhaust one is small and also the sliding velocity of piston becomes considerably small, the stick-slip motion is generated. Under some assumptions, the approximated practical equations of motion of pneumatic cylinder is obtained. The period of stick-slip motion and the displacement of piston during one period of stick-slip motion are also obtained by approximated equations. Analytical {{results show that the}} period of stick-slip motion and the displacement of piston are affected by the position of piston, orifice area of speed controller, pressure of air supply and so on. For example, in the case of <b>meter-out</b> circuit, the period of stick-slip motion and the displacement of stick-slip motion increase as the volume of exhaust cylinder increases. On the contrary, in meter-in circuit, both period and displacement decrease as the volume of exhaust cylinder increases. In either case, the period and the displacement decrease as the pressure of air supply increases. But the influences of load on the period and the displacement are quite small. These results are shown in various diagrams. The theoretical results agree well with the experimental studies...|$|E
40|$|The two {{position}} {{solenoid operated}} cartridge valve {{is widely used}} in the applications, such as process control systems, pavers, agricultural machinery, where response and installed costs {{are more important than}} precise control through electronic position feedback. In recent years, the combination of multiple cartridge valves, so called 'smart valve ' or 'programmable valve', which is able to break the mechanical linkage between the meter-in and <b>meter-out</b> orifices and enables high precision control as well as optimal usage of energy, is gaining engineering interests. But the control of such combination is far from trivial. It demands good knowledge of the valve dynamics and nonlinear flow properties. Unlike servo valve or proportional directional control valve, a mathematic model of solenoid operated cartridge valve, or even a thorough understanding of the dynamics and nonlinear performance, are not available. This paper presents an EASY 5 model for the two position solenoid operated cartridge valve. The model, which includes the solenoid force, spring force, damping force, flow force and nonlinear mass flow rate, can be used to analyze cartridge valve as well as simulate system or controller performance.

40|$|Abstract. Conventional {{electro-hydraulic}} precision {{motion control}} systems {{are controlled by}} either servo valves or proportional directional control valves. Neither of the valves are {{able to control the}} pressures at the two cylinder chambers independently or to use the regeneration flow. The result is that while precision motion control is possible, significant energy saving is not. In order to save energy while maintaining excellent motion performance, the independent control of the pressures at the two cylinder chambers and the accurate use of the regeneration flow are two key factors. The programmable valves, a combination of five independently controlled poppet-type cartridge valves, break the mechanical linkage between the meter-in and <b>meter-out</b> orifices, maintain the full functionality of conventional four-way valves and enable the accurate control of the regeneration flow via the true cross port valve. Therefore, the programmable valves are capable of both precision motion control and significant energy saving. This paper introduces the configuration of the programmable valves as well as how to control the programmable valves to achieve the dual objectives of precision motion control and energy saving.

40|$|The {{energy-saving}} programmable valve, {{a unique}} combination of five independent cartridge valves, not only decouples {{the control of}} meter-in and <b>meter-out</b> flows but also provides the ability of precisely controlling cross-port flows for energysaving purpose. Our previous works have already shown that the tremendous control flexibility gained by the proposed hardware re-configuration enables one not only to achieve precision control of the cylinder motion but also to decrease the energy usage significantly through actively utilizing the potential and kinetic energy of the load in accomplishing certain tasks such as smooth stopping. However, the control of such an essentially multi-input valve system to achieve the above objectives is far from trivial. In our previous works, a constant off-side pressure was assumed in the controller design for simplicity. This assumption may not be realistic in certain circumstances where the off-side pressure may vary from the assumed constant pressure significantly, especially right after the change of working mode. As a result, though the controller design is simplified, larger tracking error results during the transients. This paper presents an improved way to coordinately control the five independent valves by incorporating the off-side pressure dynamics into the controller design. The Adaptive Robust Control technique is applied to guarantee the stability and tracking performance {{in the presence of}} large system parameter variations and disturbances.

40|$|This work {{deals with}} {{innovative}} energy efficient fluid power systems for mobile applications. The subjects taken up concern {{to what extent}} and how energy losses can be reduced in mobile working hydraulics systems. Various measures are available for increasing energy efficiency {{in these kinds of}} systems. Examples include: Flow controlled systems The pump controller is switched from a load sensing toa displacement controlled one. The displacement is controlled in an open loopfashion directly from the operator’s demand signals. This reduces energy consumptionat the same time as dynamic issues that are attached to LS systemscan be avoided. Individual metering valve systems Flexibility is increased by removing the mechanicalcoupling between the meter-in and <b>meter-out</b> orifices in directionalvalves. An overview of this kind of system is given in the thesis. A designproposal that has been implemented is also presented. Initial test results areshown. Patents for this particular system have been applied for. Displacement control Metering losses are reduced by removing the directional valves. One pump is used for each load in such systems. This hardware layout involvesconsiderable changes compared to conventional systems. Displacementcontrolled systems are not studied in this work. In mobile applications, overall efficiency is often poor and losses are substantial. The measures listed above can help improve this significantly in such applications. A flow dividing system can decrease energy consumption by about 10 % and an individual metering system by about 20 %. Losses in pump controlled systems are difficult to give a figure for; the losses are rather attached to the pumps and motors and not to the system layout. However, the losses for these systems are presumably even lower than for individual metering systems. The main focus in this work is on individual metering systems but questions about which components and so on are also treated. For example, the Valvistor valve concept has been studied as part of this work. ...|$|E
40|$|As the {{applications}} of electro-hydraulic systems become increasingly widespread, {{the demand for}} low cost, high-level control performance and significant energy saving schemes gets stronger and stronger. The thesis proposes an intelligent mechatronics approach [...] -the integration of advanced control techniques with novel hardware reconfiguration and/or re-design [...] -to meet these industrial needs. The Purdue programmable valves; a unique configuration of five independently controlled poppet type cartridge valves, enable not only the decoupled meter-in and <b>meter-out</b> flow controls but also the precise control of the cross-port regeneration flow. When properly controlled, the increased hardware flexibility and controllability lead to significant energy-saving, due to the reduced working pressures and the full use of free regeneration flows. ^ However, the increased hardware flexibility also results in increased complexity in controlling such a multi-input-dual-objective system. A two-level coordinated control scheme is proposed in the thesis: the task-level configures the valve usage for maximal energy saving, and the valve-level utilizes Adaptive Robust Control (ARC) technique to guarantee the closed-loop system stability and performance under various model uncertainties and disturbances. Comparative experimental results were obtained to show the high-level control performance and significant energy saving achieved with the proposed low cost programmable valves. Relevant control issues, such as using the manufacturer supplied flow mappings and the deadband problem of electro-hydraulic systems, are discussed in detail in the thesis as well. ^ Lack of suitable mathematical model has limited the cartridge valve to low cost applications where precision motion control was not of major concern. The thesis proposes an on-board modeling approach to decompose and approximate the unknown valve flow mapping with some localized orthogonal basis functions. The weighting parameters of the basis functions {{as well as the}} unknown system parameters were then estimated simultaneously based on the pressure dynamics of the cylinder for regions where sufficient on-board measurement data were available. Experimental studies have been obtained to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed method and the improvement of control performance with the estimated flow mappings. ...|$|E
40|$|In {{the sector}} of mobile hydraulics, valve {{controlled}} systems are predominant. In these systems the load force and speed are adjusted by control valves. In machines where multiple drives {{are used in}} parallel at extremely varying loads the energy efficiency of such systems is often compromised over large working regions. Most valve controlled systems also lack the possibility to recuperate potential energy. A different category of hydraulic systems, called displacement controlled hydraulics {{are based on the}} manipulation of the hydraulic flow using the relative displacement of the hydraulic machines as the final control element. This type of hydrostatic power transfer, yields a resistance free velocity control, ideally leading to lossless load actuation. This thesis concerns the introduction of a new type of displacement controlled hydraulic system, adapted for construction machinery. The system decouples the hydraulic functions using one dedicated hydraulic machine for each drive. These machines are of open circuit type, capable of over center operation which enables energy recuperation. The system also comprises four separate valves that by means of switching allow the cylinder to be controlled over all four load quadrants. Depending on the selected valve hardware, the system may also include features available in a conventional valve controlled system, such as <b>meter-out</b> flow control. The system supports both symmetrical and asymmetrical cylinders. However, using the asymmetrical type the load may be controlled in two distinct states of operation. This yields an increased region of operation, which is otherwise generally stated as a drawback in displacement controlled systems. It also allows the selection between different control modes, where one of the modes is always more efficient than another. In this research both theoretical studies and a practical implementation demonstrate the energy related benefits of the new concept. The target application of this study is a medium-size wheel loader. Measurement results using the wheel loader in a short truck loading cycle show a 10 % percent reduction in fuel consumption. According to the theoretical investigation, this corresponds to a 20 % reduction in energy consumption for the hydraulicsystem itself...|$|E
40|$|In this dissertation, energy {{efficient}} hydraulic systems are studied. The {{research focuses on}} solutions for linear actuators in mobile applications, with emphasis on construction machines. Alongside the aspect of energy efficiency, the thesis deals with competing aspects in hydraulic system design found {{in the development of}} construction machines. Simulation models and controls for different concepts are developed, taking the whole machine into account. In line with this work, several proof of concept demonstrators are developed. First, pump controlled systems are studied and a novel concept based on an open-circuit pump configuration is conceived. Special consideration is paid to multi-mode capabilities that allow for a broadened operating range and potential downsizing of components. Simulation models and controls are developed and the system is experimentally validated in a wheel loader application. Second, the possibility for energy recuperation in valve controlled systems is investigated. In such solutions, a hydraulic motor, added to the <b>meter-out</b> port, is used for energy recovery during load lowering and in multi-function operation. Recuperated energy is either be used momentarily or is stored in a hydraulic accumulator. The proposed solution means an incremental improvement to conventional systems, which is sometimes attractive to machine manufacturers due to fewer uncertainties in reliability, safety and development cost. The energy recovery system is studied on a conceptual level where several alternative systems are proposed and a concept based on a two-machine hydraulic pressure transformer is selected for a deeper control study followed by experimental validation. Third, so-called `common pressure rail' systems are suggested. This technique is well established for rotary drives, at least for the industrial sector. However, in applying this technique to mobile hydraulics, feasible solutions for linear actuators are needed. In this dissertation, two approaches to this problem are presented. The first one is the hydraulic pressure transformer, studied in simulation as the key-component of a `series hybrid' topology for wheel loaders. In the second approach variable displacement linear actuators (VDLA) based on a 4 -chamber cylinder and multi-mode control is applied. In a theoretical study a model predictive control approach is suggested and new insights to the trade-off between controllability and energy efficiency of a multi-chamber cylinder are presented. Finally, a fullscale hydraulic hybrid system based on secondary controlled hydraulic motors and VDLAs is designed and experimentally validated on a large excavator...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a solution enabling lower losses in hydraulic actuator systems. A mobile fluid power system often contains several different actuators supplied {{with a single}} load sensing pump. One of the main advantages is the need of only one system pump. This makes the fluid power system compact and cost-effective. A hydraulic load often consists of two ports, e. g. motors and cylinders. Such loads have traditionally been controlled by a valve that controls these ports by one single control signal, namely {{the position of the}} spool in a control valve. In this kind of valve, the inlet (meter-in) and outlet (<b>meter-out)</b> orifices are mechanically connected. The mechanical connection makes the system robust and easy to control, {{at the same time as}} the system lacks flexibility. Some of the main drawbacks are The fixed relation between the inlet and outlet orifices in most applications produce too much throttling at the outlet orifice under most operating conditions. This makes the system inefficient. The flow directions are fixed for a given spool position; therefore, no energy recuperation and/or regeneration ability is available. In this thesis a novel system idea enabling, for example, recuperation and regeneration is presented. Recuperation is when flow is taken from a tank, pressurized by external loads, and then fed back into the pump line. Regeneration is when either cylinder chambers (or motor ports) are connected to the pump line. Only one system pump is needed. Pressure compensated (load independent), bidirectional, poppet valves are proposed and utilized. The novel system presented in this thesis needs only a position sensor on each compensator spool. This simple sensor is also suitable for identification of mode switches, e. g. between normal, differential and regenerative modes. Patent pending. The balance of where to put the functionality (hardware and/or software) makes it possible to manoeuvre the system with maintained speed control in the case of sensor failure. The main reason is that the novel system does not need pressure transducers for flow determination. Some features of the novel system: Mode switches The mode switches are accomplished without knowledge about the pressures in the system Throttle losses With the new system approach, choice of control and measure signals, the throttle losses at the control valves are reduced Smooth mode switches The system will switch to regenerative mode automatically in a smooth manner when possible Use energy stored in the loads The load, e. g. a cylinder, is able to be used as a motor when possible, enabling the system to recuperate overrun loads The system and its components are described together with the control algorithms that enable energy efficient operation. Measurements from a real application are also presented in the thesis...|$|E
