50|$|Nolina nelsonii (Blue Nolina or Nelson's Bear Grass), often misspelled Nolina nelsoni, is a {{flowering}} {{plant in the}} genus Nolina. The species was first described in 1906; in its genus, it is morphologically most similar to Nolina parryi. This extremely drought-tolerant plant is native to the deserts and montane regions in the State of Tamaulipas in northern/northeastern Mexico. It {{is known to be}} cold-hardy to at least -12 °C. It develops a trunk <b>mesuring</b> from one to several meters high, making it an arborescent member of its genus. The bluish-green leaves, with finely toothed margins, are borne in dense rosettes, each with up to several hundred stiff linear (narrow) leaves up to 70 centimeters long. It is dioecious; upon reaching sexual maturity, its white-flowered inflorescence appears in Spring. The fruit capsules are around 80 mm in length, containing light-brown, spherical to oblong seeds 2-3 mm in diameter. After blooming, the plant's main trunk dies and multiple lateral trunks emerge to take its place.|$|E

40|$|In the {{production}} of particleboard, different properties of the board have to be measured {{in order to keep}} the board quality within required limits. Non-destructive methods for this purpose include ultra-sonic testing and eigen frequency testing. These methods have been proposed for <b>mesuring</b> of the strength of the board after pressing, for process control purposes. The ultra sound velocity and eigen frequency methods have been proved to be good instruments for doing this. The results show that Young's modulus and bending strength can be predicted with high accuracy with these methods. Internal bond can only be predicted with poor to fair accuracy with normal regression models. The use of multivariate models most often give better and more reliable models for Young's modulus and bending strength and gives much better predictions of the internal bond. Multivariate models are best suited for complex predictions and if the prediction variables are weak. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|E
