In this study we aim to verify the importance of temperamental traits not only in choosing the military career as a profession, but also in passing or failing the entrance examinations. METHODS: We compared the affective temperaments (evaluated by TEMPS-A[P]) of those applying to become a cadet officer in the Italian Navy, divided into various subgroups depending on whether they passed or failed the entrance examination at various levels (high school final test, medical (physical and psychiatric), <b>mathematical</b> examination and <b>aptitude</b> test). We also tested for correlations between grades received and temperamental scores. RESULTS: Higher scores for those with a hyperthymic and lower scores for those with a depressive, cyclothymic or irritable temperament characterized applicants taking medical exams and aptitude tests. Higher scores {{on the high school}} final test correlated with lower hyperthymic, cyclothymic and irritable temperament scores. No correlations were found between temperamental traits and mathematical examinations. Multivariate analysis stressed the negative impact of a cyclothymic temperament and the poor discriminant power of temperaments regarding medical and <b>mathematical</b> examinations, and <b>aptitude</b> tests. Conversely, temperaments showed good discriminant power as far as psychiatric examinations are concerned. CONCLUSIONS: Hyperthymic temperamental traits appear to be important not only in choosing a profession, but also in passing entrance examinations. Even so, affective temperaments (strong hyperthymic and weak cyclothymic, depressive and irritable traits) are the only successfully predictors of the outcome of psychiatric examinations and, to a lesser extent, medical examinations and aptitude tests. Achieving high school graduation and passing mathematical exams are independent of temperamental traits...|$|R

40|$|CONTEXT Students enter {{undergraduate}} engineering {{degree programs}} {{with a wide}} range of <b>mathematical</b> knowledge, skills, <b>aptitudes</b> and abilities. A significant proportion of engineering undergraduates struggle with course mathematics requirements. Student pass / fail rates in engineering maths show that QUT’s BEng students are no exception. QUT provides out-of-class support to students needing extra assistance with their maths (at point-of-need) via our STIMulate program. Difficulty dealing with the mathematics requirement of engineering courses is known both anecdotally and via a body of published research, to be a major contributor to students failing to complete their degree. PURPOSE QUT’s STIMulate program philosophy of support-for-learning embraces a social justice framework, student leadership, student-academic partnerships, peer assistance and facilitated learning. The STIMulate program has developed a series of complementary approaches to support academic success. The success of the program can be attributed in part to this combination of approaches and to a deliberate move away from the deficit model so often associated with learning support. The program has proven to be of value to large numbers of students with a range of <b>mathematical</b> knowledge, skills, <b>aptitudes</b> and abilities. APPROACH Since 2013 STIMulate has supported student learning in maths, science and IT at QUT. It is a service founded on sound pedagogical practice. QUT’s STIMulate program offers a multi-faceted approach of support to all coursework students (both undergraduate and postgraduate). It aims to enhance student learning, to increase capabilities and confidence in mathematical and scientific concepts, as well as to expand information technology skills and competencies. A well-developed consultation framework enables our STIMulate service to integrate with, complement and support QUT’s curriculum. STIMulate uses sophisticated planning techniques that accurately predict levels of student demand at different stages of the upcoming semester. RESULTS Evidence of the positive impact of STIMulate can be found in student grades, retention (attrition), lecturer feedback, client attendance figures and student client feedback (both anecdotal and via planned survey responses). On all measures for 2015 and 2016 (GPA, academic success, retention, attrition) students who attended STIMulate achieved better outcomes than those who did not. It is particularly pleasing to see a significant proportion of students from target equity cohorts taking advantage of our STIMulate service. CONCLUSIONS QUT’s STIMulate program offers a model of how to optimally organise and deliver support for mathematics learning. It demonstrates how academics and students can effectively partner to deliver a quality service...|$|R
40|$|Learning {{to program}} is difficult. The skill {{requires}} one to model {{a real problem}} in abstract form and expressing it in a logical structure and detail programming language. Teaching programming to student is also a challenging task to instructors. In Universiti Utara Malaysia, introductory programming course is a compulsory for various program such as Bachelor in Information Technology, Bachelor in Multimedia, Bachelor in Decision Science and Bachelor in Education specializing in Information Technology. The unique characteristic of the students taking this course is that they may come from either the science or non-science background. This is in contrast with previous studies related to predicting student's potential in first programming course that usually involved computer science undergraduate students. The current student's achievement in programming courses is not very encouraging and this could add with the current problem of high unemployment statistics of IT graduates who are lacking in the technical and communication skill besides business knowledge. This study is an initial step in identifying the possible factors that influence a student's success in programming. This knowledge will assist teaching instructor in designing the appropriate pedagogical approach that is suitable for the students that we anticipate {{not be able to}} perform well. Respondents for this study were selected using systematic sampling based on list of students who has taken introductory programming given by Academic Affairs Department. The instruments were distributed to the respondents. As for the data analysis, data mining process is used to help identify the possible factors based on the data selected. Classification technique is used to obtain the predictive model and clustering technique for the descriptive model. SAS Enterprise Miner was used to assist in the data analysis. Based on the findings, <b>mathematical</b> and <b>aptitude</b> test score is a strong explanatory variable for student's success in programming. In terms of personality, Investigative is a dominant type among students who are good in programming. Teaching instructor need to use alternative approach for other students in order to improve their understanding and skill in the subject...|$|R
50|$|In 1994, E. Joel Love, {{a student}} of the ALW Cipher (who was both a {{colleague}} of Greenfield and Coutu), {{and a member of the}} Hermetic Alchemical Order of the QBLH, proposed another English cipher that he would call 'Cipher X'. Love possessed a high <b>mathematical</b> <b>aptitude</b> and formal training in Cryptography in the U.S Coast Guard. A lifelong Thelemite, Love considered the ALW cipher to be incomplete to the task of answering many of the cosmological and deep structure questions proposed by Gillis' system. Both Gillis and Stratton-Kent met with Joel Love in 2004 and were mutually surprised to find that both Love's and Gillis' work contained many striking parallels. Love considered the ALW cipher to be representative of an authentic epistle, and interpreted verses in Liber XXVII to hint at a process of inversion. By taking the obvious base three trigrams system of Liber XXVII, and by comparing them to the cipher key of ALW, these inversions resulted in 'Cipher X' which, technically speaking, is the base three inversion of the ALW Cipher. Love always maintained that Cipher X was a compliment to ALW, and himself being an advanced user of LEXICON, was a vocal proponent of comparing the results of many ciphers, a study he called 'cross cipher correlation'. Love would become a fountainhead of Qaballistic research for many years and quietly compiled over 20 years of notes and research. Love had several students, the first of which was longtime friend and colleague H. Thomas Chaudoin. Chaudoin maintains that he was present during the years that the bulk of this research was 'transmitted' to Love. Chaudoin would go on to found the NOT (New Order of Thelema), using many of Love's innovations as a foundation. Love was also a colleague and acquaintance of the late Robert Anton Wilson and a close friend of the late Kerry Wendell Thornley, co-founder of Discordianism. Love passed in June 2015.|$|E

More specifically, it utilized standardized verbal and nonverbal tests and compared these with the presently used Scholastic Aptitude Tests as predictors of success in industrial education. The data for this study were collected from tests administered to a sample population by the writer during regularly scheduled class periods in the Fall semester, 1971, and from the Scholastic Aptitude Test records in the Office of the Registrar at Norfolk State College. The variables included in the study were: Scholastic Aptitude Test - Verbal scores, Scholastic <b>Aptitude</b> Test - <b>Mathematical</b> scores, Scholastic <b>Aptitude</b> Test - Total scores, Bennett Mechanical Comprehension Test, and the Raven Progressive Matrices. The criteria of success were the final semester grades in the following courses: Basic Woodworking, Introduction to Technical Drafting, Introduction to Industrial Education, Basic Electronics, and Automobile Engines. In order to show the relationship between the variables studied, the data were analyzed and statistics were computed throw a program developed by the Health Sciences Computing Facility at University of California at Los Angeles. This program incorporated a step-wise regression and rendered a correlation matrix, an analysis of variance, a multiple r and a standard error of estimate. All statistics utilized in this study were computed by the Ball State University Computer Center. The results of this study indicated that the variable that offered the best information of predicting academic success in industrial education at Norfolk State College was the Raven Progressive Matrices. The combinations of variables which were statistically significant were the SAT Mathematical and the Bennett MeoY~anioal Comprehension Test correlated to final grades in Electronics, and the SAT Mathematical, Raven Progressive Matrices, Bennett Mechanical Comprehension Test, and SAT Verbal correlated to final grades in Drafting. The results of the study seem to justify the following conclusions: 1. The SAT scores are not valid predictors of academic success in several of the technical areas of industrial education and probably should not be used as such. 2. The Raven Progressive Matrices showed evidence of contributing significantly to prediction of academic success in industrial education at Norfolk State College. 3. The Bennett Mechanical Comprehension Test showed a high correlation with final grades in Drafting but probably should not be used as a predictor in other areas. 4. Neither verbal or nonverbal tests used without benefit of other devices should be used as predictors of academic success in industrial education at Norfolk State College. As a result of the present investigation, it is recommended that: 1. A follow-up study of the students in this research study be conducted to ascertain their success as students and later as teachers in the field of industrial education. 2. An investigation employing individual rather than group testing as predictive devices be conducted. 3. Further study of the use of the Raven Progressive Matrices be made with larger samples and other criteria of success. Thesis (Ed. S. ...|$|R

Our main findings are that Tertiary Entrance Rank (TER), <b>mathematical</b> <b>aptitude,</b> being female and attendance in tutorials are all good predictors of success but amongst these factors only attendance is significant in discriminating between students who fail and those who discontinue. Also, there are differences across degree programs and, in particular, students in Combined Law are very likely to pass but, if they are at risk, they {{are much more likely to}} discontinue than to fail.

40|$|There {{has been}} a {{considerable}} expansion in the uses and definitions of giftedness constructs since 1958, when constructs were typically defined in very narrow cognitive terms (such as intelligence test scores). Currently, gifted constructs have {{a wide variety of}} definitions which reflect closely-linked processes used for identifying and selecting (and subsequently labelling) gifted pupils and for making decisions about program goals and procedures. The breadth of such constructs range from definitions involving a single characteristic (such as creativity or <b>mathematical</b> <b>aptitude)</b> to those which include a broad range of cognitive and noncognitive characteristics. Other dimensions in the variability of gifted constructs include content, level of exceptionality, a static or dynamic focus, and precision of the construct's definition. Another issue of importance concerns the sources of definitions for constructs; these include_derivations from theory, derivations from selection_instruments, and empirical derivations. To be accurate and meaningful, each gifted construct should have four conditions: explicit definition; a theory-value base; deri 7 ation of the selection model from the construct; and empirical validation.

40|$|Recent {{research}} has questioned socialization explanations for {{sex differences in}} mathematics performance. In particular, the hypothesis that differences {{in the details of}} males ' and females ' high school programs are responsible for the sizable average difference between the sexes in quantitative Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) performance has been challenged in a recent study by Benbow and Stanley (1980). This research, however, considered sex-linked coursework differences only indirectly and was based on the experiences of an unusual sample of gifted youth. Using a more broadly representative sample, we provide a direct test of the hypothesis that the sex difference in quantitative SAT performance may be due to differences in the pattern of quantitative coursework taken by males and females in high school. We find that the male-female gap in SAT-M performance shrinks considerably when sex differences in quantitative high school course-work are controlled. These findings suggest that increasing females' rates of enrollment in high level mathematics courses would greatly reduce the sex difference in quantitative SATperformance and that it is premature to reject socialization and experiential explanations for the male-female gap in levels of quantitative performance. It is well-established {{that by the end of}} high school there are large sex differences in <b>mathematical</b> <b>aptitude</b> and achievement (Armstrong, 1979...|$|E
40|$|For {{a sample}} of 300 high school {{students}} who had completed two semesters of algebra and two semesters of plane geometry the valid-ity coefficients of each of 21 cognitive measures, three personality factor scales, seven attitude and/or interest measures, two indicators of previous musical experience, and five demographic characteristics were determined with respect to each of five criterion measures. Three stepwise multiple regression analyses were completed, and one-way analyses of variance were carried out on each of the 31 predictor measures to determine whether significant differences were present in mean scores of three subgroups representing distinctly different levels of achievement and teacher-rated aptitude. In gen-eral, highest validity coefficients were registered for cognitive meas-ures, although some affective variables contributed significant pro-portions of variance to the coefficients of multiple determination. Statistically reliable differences among the means of the three sub-groups were present for all except one of the cognitive measures but absent for every one of the affective and demographic variables. Language and verbal-oriented tasks appeared to be substantially more prognostic of success in geometry than of success in algebra. Implications for the definition of <b>mathematical</b> <b>aptitude</b> are dis-cussed.
