40|$|The near-future {{penetration}} of plug-in electric vehicles (PEV) {{is expected to}} be large enough to {{have a significant impact on}} the power grid. If PEVs were allowed to charge simultaneously at the <b>maximum</b> <b>power</b> <b>rate,</b> the distribution grid would face serious problems of stability. Therefore, mechanisms are needed to coordinate the charging processes of PEVs. In this paper, we propose an allocation policy inspired by lottery scheduling that aims at balancing fairness and selfishness, providing preferential treatment to the PEVs that have a high valuation of the electricity, while guaranteeing a non-zero share of the available power to all the PEVs to ensure fairness...|$|E
30|$|The {{inertial}} response {{performance of}} a WPP is typically dependent on the wind power penetration level, the number of WTGs capable of providing inertial response, the initial operation mode of individual WTGs (under full load or partial load) as well as WTGs’ physical characteristics. Relevant characteristics include upper and lower limits for rotor speed, over-loading capability of power converters, auxiliary frequency controller parameters and <b>maximum</b> <b>power</b> <b>rate</b> limit (dP/dt)max [4, 31, 32, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42]. To alleviate mechanical stresses on the drive train and extend a WT’s lifetime, the (dP/dt)max should not exceed 0.45 p.u./s according to several manufacturers’ datasheets [38]. Under medium and high wind conditions where WTGs are normally controlled to operate at MPP conditions, adequate kinetic energy is available to provide a useful inertial response. Under high wind speed conditions when rotor speed is constrained at the rated value, additional power provision can be fulfilled through pitch angle control to emulate an inertial response if temporary over-loading is allowed.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an optimized design of 12 kW 2 L-FB inverter for small-scale wind turbine, {{taking into account}} some specific behavioral features of SiC power MOSFETs.

Still, traditional thermal management design of power modules has to refer to maximum load conditions.

Thermaland power-delivery issues are becoming especially critical for high-performance computing systems.

With{{the increasing}} usage of clock gating techniques, the average power dissipation typically seen by common applications isbecoming much less than the chip's <b>rated</b> <b>maximum</b> <b>power</b> dissipation. However, system designers still must designthermal heat sinks to withstand the worst-case scenario. We define and investigate the major components of anydynamic thermal management scheme. Specifically we explore the tradeoffs between several mechanisms for re-sponding to periods of thermal trauma and we consider the effects of hardware and software implementations. With ap-propriate dynamic thermal management, the CPU can be designed for a much lower <b>maximum</b> <b>power</b> <b>rating,</b> withminimal performance impact for typical applications. ...|$|R

2500|$|Eyewear {{is rated}} for optical density (OD), {{which is the}} base-10 {{logarithm}} of the attenuation factor by which the optical filter reduces beam power. [...] For example, eyewear with OD3 will reduce the beam power in the specified wavelength range {{by a factor of}} 1000. In addition to an optical density sufficient to reduce beam power to below the maximum permissible exposure (see above), laser eyewear used where direct beam exposure is possible should be able to withstand a direct hit from the laser beam without breaking. The protective specifications (wavelengths and optical densities) are usually printed on the goggles, generally {{near the top of the}} unit.

50|$|For AC-operated devices (e.g. coaxial cable, loudspeakers), {{there may}} be even be two <b>power</b> ratings, a <b>maximum</b> (peak) <b>power</b> <b>rating</b> and an average <b>power</b> <b>rating.</b> For such devices, the peak <b>power</b> <b>rating</b> usually {{specifies}} the low frequency or pulse energy, while the average <b>power</b> <b>rating</b> limits high-frequency operation.

40|$|Abstract — By the {{generalized}} multi-carrier (GMC) principle a unified framework to describe various multi-carrier {{as well as}} single carrier approaches is established. In this paper 1 the GMC principle is extended to pilot design and channel estimation, so that a unified description of pilot aided channel estimation (PACE) by interpolation in time and frequency is established. This applies to frequency domain pilots which are embedded in the GMC signal, as well as pilots sequences time multiplexed with data-bearing GMC blocks. A comparative performance evaluation of the two different GMC variants OFDM and single carrier with various pilot allocation schemes is carried out, also taking into account practical constraints such as the peak to average power ratio (PAPR) and required power amplifier back-off. It is found that a serial modem with time or frequency multiplexed pilots could be designed with a power amplifier with about 2 dB lower <b>maximum</b> <b>power</b> <b>rating</b> {{than that of a}} corresponding OFDM modem.
