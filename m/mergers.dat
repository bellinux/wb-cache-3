5|$|The {{amount of}} gas a super-Earth that formed in situ acquires {{may depend on}} when the {{planetary}} embryos merged due to giant impacts relative to the dissipation of the gas disk. If the <b>mergers</b> happen after the gas disk dissipates terrestrial planets can form, if in a transition disk a super-Earth with a gas envelope containing a few percent of its mass may form. If the <b>mergers</b> happen too early runaway gas accretion may occur leading {{to the formation of}} a gas giant. The <b>mergers</b> begin when the dynamical friction due to the gas disk becomes insufficient to prevent collisions, a process that will begin earlier in a higher metalicity disk. Alternatively gas accretion may be limited due to the envelopes not being in hydrostatic equilibrium, instead gas may flow through the envelope slowing its growth and delaying the onset of runaway gas accretion until the mass of the core reaches 15 Earth masses.|$|E

If one of the merging galaxies is much more massive than the other merging galaxy then the result is known as cannibalism.

3000|$|One {{interesting}} question {{raised by a}} referee is {{which would be the}} reaction in the industry after a former <b>merger.</b> In addressing this question we consider that after each type of <b>merger,</b> outsiders might propose a same type <b>merger</b> or a different one. Therefore, three different market structures are analyzed. The first one is the sequential horizontal <b>merger,</b> denoted by HH, the second is the sequential vertical <b>merger,</b> denoted by VV, and finally a mixed situation with one horizontal and one vertical <b>merger,</b> denoted by HV. Regarding the HH, consider that the firm producing component A_ 3 decides to propose a horizontal <b>merger.</b> It has two options, either to merge with the already formed <b>merger</b> with firms producing components A_ 1 and [...] A_ 2 [...] or to form an alternative <b>merger</b> with other single component producer, say A_ 4. We show that the proposer would prefer to merge with the initial <b>merger</b> rather than forming an alternative one. 21 This occurs for any n and the firms involved will be better off by forming the <b>merger.</b> The effect of such an extended <b>merger</b> in the market as compared to the situation with one horizontal <b>merger</b> is that outsiders of the same type are better off, while outsiders producing a component of a different type are worse off. Outsiders aggregate profits decrease. However, the effect on total profits including the <b>merger</b> is that the extended <b>merger</b> increase them only if the ratio γ/β is large enough, noting that the condition is relaxed as the number of firms increase.|$|R
