500|$|The video {{has been}} {{described}} as [...] "psychedelic" [...] and as an anthem to Marijuana, rather than one about drunkenness. Brad Wete for Entertainment Weekly explained that Mars was [...] "ready to drown his sorrows in a tall glass of alcohol" [...] and tipped [...] "find out what concoction Mars and Marley are whipping up" [...] by watching the clip. Prefix Magazine s Andrew Winistorfer gave the video a harsh critic, he wrote that the smoke was not the only featured in the video as anyone [...] "get to see Damian Marley sell out in real time". He furthered that Damian, [...] "might as well be in McDonald's commercials. I guess this song is supposed to make you THINK about stuff [...] but mostly it makes <b>me</b> <b>try</b> to find someone to blame for this".|$|E
500|$|He {{frequently}} {{tells the}} press that [...] "My music is not Christian, Lecrae is." [...] He told Miami New Timess Crossfade that [...] "I think Christian is a wonderful noun, but a terrible adjective. Are there Christian shoes, Christian clothes, Christian plumbers, Christian pipes? I think if you're going to, you should label it hip-hop... hip-hop is a particular poetic style. Labeling it with the faith assumes that the song {{is going to be}} some kind of sermon, but there's a lot of social and political things that I don't think make it gospel or Christian music." [...] He also stated, [...] "I like to wrap my mind around a total situation. I'm a social anthropologist. If I never been homeless, let <b>me</b> <b>try</b> to be homeless for a week and soak up that information. More like a method actor. So for me it's spending time with people and talking about things from their perspective." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{story was}} commended by several critics. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times wrote, [...] "I've {{never met anyone}} like Forrest Gump in a movie before, {{and for that matter}} I've never seen a movie quite like 'Forrest Gump.' Any attempt to {{describe}} him will risk making the movie seem more conventional than it is, but let <b>me</b> <b>try.</b> It's a comedy, I guess. Or maybe a drama. Or a dream. The screenplay by Eric Roth has the complexity of modern fiction...The performance is a breathtaking balancing act between comedy and sadness, in a story rich in big laughs and quiet truths...What a magical movie." [...] Todd McCarthy of Variety wrote that the film [...] "has been very well worked out on all levels, and manages the difficult feat of being an intimate, even delicate tale played with an appealingly light touch against an epic backdrop." [...] The film did receive notable pans from several major reviewers. Anthony Lane of The New Yorker called the film [...] "Warm, wise, and wearisome as hell." [...] Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly said that the film [...] "reduces the tumult of the last few decades to a virtual-reality theme park: a baby-boomer version of Disney's America." ...|$|E

500|$|Rowland's {{voice is}} {{classified}} as a three-octave lyric mezzo-soprano, and her music includes various styles of musical genres such as contemporary R, pop, hip hop, soul, rock and dance. Her debut solo album Simply Deep (2002) followed an adult-alternative rock sound, while her second album Ms. Kelly (2007) featured an urban sound. In an interview with The Independent, Rowland admitted that with her first two albums she struggled to find her sound. [...] "I was in a stage with the first two records where I was searching and I was like, let <b>me</b> <b>try</b> a rock-dance approach, the label [...] wanted me to try it and I did it...And then after that came a more urban approach with Ms. Kelly in 2007." [...] Her third album Here I Am (2011) consisted of a pop and R sound, with subtle influences of dance. Rowland stated that meeting David Guetta had influenced her to record dance music. During production of the album, Rowland stated {{that part of the}} reason for the new sound on Here I Am was wanting to do something different, saying [...] "I knew I couldn't be afraid of this direction, and I wasn't going to let the thoughts and opinions of others make me afraid to go in this direction".|$|E
500|$|The main cast was put {{together}} {{through a process of}} auditions and readings. Actors often did not know whether Chase liked their performances or not. Michael Imperioli, who beat out several actors for the part of Christopher Moltisanti, recalls [...] "He's got a poker face, so I thought he wasn't into me, and he kept giving me notes and having <b>me</b> <b>try</b> it again, which often is a sign that you're not doing it right. I thought, I'm not getting this. So he said, 'Thank you,' and I left. I didn't expect to hear back. And then they called." [...] Chase also said he wanted Imperioli because he had been in Goodfellas. James Gandolfini was invited to audition for the part of Tony Soprano after casting director Susan Fitzgerald saw a short clip of his performance in the 1993 film True Romance. Lorraine Bracco, who had played the role of mob wife Karen Hill in Goodfellas, was originally asked {{to play the role of}} Carmela Soprano. She took the role of Dr. Jennifer Melfi instead because she wanted to try something different and felt the part of the highly educated Dr. Melfi would be more of a challenge for her. Tony Sirico, who has a criminal background, signed on to play Paulie Walnuts as long as his character was not to be a [...] "rat".|$|E
500|$|When {{production}} first started, Clement and {{his crew}} would spend six hours applying Haley's make-up; eventually, the crew was able to streamline their process. According to Haley, the make-up crew would apply individual prosthetics to him, from his head {{all the way down}} his back, which were glued to his body. The appliances were then blended together to create a seamless appearance. Haley spent approximately three hours and twenty minutes in the make-up chair to apply the prosthetics, each day; on occasion, it would take almost four and a half hours when the crew needed to apply the prosthetic skull cap, which Haley did not need to worry about most days as he was able to wear the fedora hat on top of his head. Haley also had to wear contact lenses, one that was bloody and another that was cloudy, with the latter one making it difficult for the actor to see out of. Haley also had to work on developing Freddy's [...] "voice" [...] for the film. According to Haley, the process of coming up with the perfect voice for Freddy is [...] "this organic process of embodying the character", and not about just [...] "sitting around the table and going, 'Let <b>me</b> <b>try</b> this voice and this voice'". Haley and Bayer admitted that some of the voice would be digitally enhanced in the end to give it a [...] "supernatural quality" [...] and get it away from the voice Haley used as Rorschach in Watchmen.|$|E

500|$|The same year, Holmes was {{approached}} by Martin Delany, an African-American man {{who had worked with}} Frederick Douglass. The 38-year-old requested admission to Harvard after having been previously rejected by four schools despite impressive credentials. In a controversial move, Holmes admitted Delany and two other black men to the Medical School. Their admission sparked a student statement, which read: [...] "Resolved That we have no objection to the education and evaluation of blacks but do decidedly remonstrate against their presence in College with us." [...] Sixty students signed the resolution, although 48 students signed another resolution which noted it would be [...] "a far greater evil, if, in the present state of public feeling, a medical college in Boston could refuse to this unfortunate class any privileges of education, which it is {{in the power of the}} profession to bestow". In response, Holmes told the black students they would not be able to continue after that semester. A faculty meeting directed Holmes to write that [...] "the intermixing of races is distasteful to a large portion of the class, & injurious to the interests of the school". Despite his support of education for blacks, he was not an abolitionist; against what he considered the abolitionists' habit of using [...] "every form of language calculated to inflame", he felt that the movement was going too far. This lack of support dismayed friends like James Russell Lowell, who once told Holmes he should be more outspoken against slavery. Holmes calmly responded, [...] "Let <b>me</b> <b>try</b> to improve and please my fellowmen after my own fashion at present." [...] Nonetheless, Holmes believed that slavery could be ended peacefully and legally.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the opinion}} of George Martin, [...] "At that stage 'Please Please Me' was a very dreary song. It was like a Roy Orbison number, very slow, bluesy vocals. It was {{obvious to me that}} it badly needed pepping up. I told them to bring it in next time and we'd have another go at it." [...] He asked the Beatles to {{consider}} making major changes to it, including increasing its tempo. By the time it was brought back into the studio on 26 November 1962, its arrangement had been radically altered, and it took 18 takes to record what George Martin immediately predicted would be their first major hit. Paul McCartney in Anthology stated: [...] "We sang it and George Martin said, 'Can we change the tempo?' We said, 'What's that?' He said, 'Make it a bit faster. Let <b>me</b> <b>try</b> it.' And he did. We thought, 'Oh, that's all right, yes.' Actually, we were a bit embarrassed that he had found a better tempo than we had." ...|$|E

And then after that came a more urban approach with Ms. Kelly in 2007." [...] She further described the songs on her previous albums as sounding very much the same, which {{led her to the}} realisation that she [...] "needed refreshing". She told Entertainment Focus that meeting French DJ David Guetta [...] "changed her perspective and helped to inspire the new sound". She then spent more time in Europe in 2009, something which she said had influenced her. [...] "It's different being over here in Europe and just being able to look at different magazines and fashion shows and things like that. And just thinking about the look and working with different stylists as well. I wanted {{to make sure it was}} a look that was all me, you know?." [...] She noted that seeing people's reactions to dance music made her feel [...] "completely intoxicated!." [...] In July 2010, Rowland said during {{an interview}} with Alex Catarinella of Paper magazine that [...] "I spent about a year of my life in Europe really listening to a whole bunch of European DJs and hearing dance music a lot on the radio and really loving it. 'When Love Takes Over' was my first introduction to dance music [...] it was a whole other monster. It's really a culture and I love it." ...|$|E
