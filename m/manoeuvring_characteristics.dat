Whilst this showed the considerable potency of a ram, it also demonstrated the inadequate <b>manoeuvring</b> <b>characteristics</b> of many of the ships equipped with them. The ram was designed to be removable to avoid damage during accidental collisions, but although other ships customarily carried theirs detached, Inflexible seems to have kept hers in place.

Since, {{the operation of}} pusher-barge mainly concentrates on confined waters, {{there is a need}} to predict and analyze the manoeuvring characteristic of the system for a safe and acceptable performance. A time domain simulation programme was developed for this purpose. A series of model experiments were carried out to determine the hydrodynamic coefficients using a planar motion mechanism (PMM). The time domain simulation shows the manoeuvring characteristic in the form of turning circle trajectories and zig-zag manoeuvre based on the hydrodynamic coefficients, which were derived based on experimental results. The <b>manoeuvring</b> <b>characteristics</b> in shallow and deep water conditions were compared through the simulation results.

40|$|Abstract: Inertial Navigation System (INS) and Global Positioning System (GPS) {{technologies}} {{have been widely}} used in a variety of positioning and navigation applications. Both systems have their unique features and shortcomings. Therefore, the integration of GPS with INS is now critical to overcome each of their drawbacks and to maximize each of their benefits. The integration of GPS with INS can be implemented using a Kalman filter in such modes as loosely, tightly and ultra-tightly coupled. In all these integration modes the INS error states, together with any navigation state (position, velocity, attitude) and other unknown parameters of interest, are estimated using GPS measurements. In a high performance system it is expected that all these unknown states will be precisely estimated. Although it has been noted that both the quality of the GPS measurements and the trajectory and/or <b>manoeuvre</b> <b>characteristics</b> of the problem will have impacts on system performance, a systematic sensitivity analysis is still lacking. This paper will address this issue through real data analyses. The performance analysis results are very relevant to system design and platform trajectory and/or manoeuvre optimisation...|$|R

A unified mathematical model, which brings together both aspects of ship manoeuvring in a seaway, has been proposed by Bailey, 1999 [9] and a time simulation has been developed on this basis. This study summarises the principles of the unified mathematical model and the verification of software, in which preliminary results for a Mariner vessel are presented. Then it extends the use of the model for another ship, the British Bombardier tanker, in order to further the validation process. The influence of parameters of the model, such as the mesh or the viscous ramp used at low frequencies, is investigated. Then, the predictions of circle manoeuvres and zigzag manoeuvres are compared with full-scale trials results. The comparisons are detailed and it shows that, although non linear effects have to be considered, the software predicts good tendencies in the evolution of ship <b>manoeuvring</b> <b>characteristics,</b> when some parameters such as rudder angle change.

40|$|The {{prediction}} of a ship’s wake field and self-propulsion capabilities {{has traditionally been}} centered on experiments; however with the advancement in modern computing power, this can be achieved {{through the use of}} computational methods. An advantage with the use of CFD is its ability to provide insight into flow characteristics close to the wall, which are difficult to obtain through experiments. The most interesting and challenging aspect of using CFD in this analysis, is the influence of the propeller action and the unsteady hydrodynamic of the rudder working in the propeller wake. One approach to address the problem is to discretize the ship, propulsor and the rudder using unsteady RANS computations (Carrica et al., 2011). Due to the small time steps and high computational cost involved, simulations are often performed using representative propeller models or body force method. The level of complexities in the body force propeller approach varies from prescribing the body forces, Badoe et al., (2012), Phillips et al., (2010), through to coupling a more complex propeller performance code which accounts for the non-uniform inflow at the propeller plane, Phillips et al., (2009). There are several self-propulsion computations using body force propeller models reported in the literature. Banks et al., (2010) performed a RANS simulation of multiphase flow around the KCS hull form using a propeller model with force distribution based on the Hough and Ordway thrust and torque distribution (Hough and Ordway, 1965). Simonsen and Stern, (2003) coupled a body force propeller model based on potential theory formulation in which the propeller was represented by bound vortex sheets on the propeller disk and free vortices shed from the downstream of the propeller to a RANS code to simulate the <b>manoeuvring</b> <b>characteristic</b> of the Esso Osaka with a rudder.

40|$|A {{comprehensive}} approach to simulate {{the interaction between the}} ship propulsion system and manoeuvrability, during transients and off design conditions, is presented. The increasing attention on the manoeuvring features of the vessel has forced designers to consider this aspect already in the preliminary stages of the project.

However, differences between model tests and full scale trials exist. From the hydrodynamic point of view, some disagreements are due to the scale effects but also the effect of the propulsion control system, highly non-linear, may provide a considerable contribution to such differences.

For these reasons, the ship dynamic behaviour is evaluated by time domain simulators, developed by the authors, which include the ship dynamics, the propulsion plant dynamics and the propulsion control system logics.

The main goal of the work is to find the control strategies for different actuators coordination of the vehicle (brakes, rear and front steering systems and suspensions) with the purpose of their cooperation to enhance the heavy vehicles safety and to get control over the vehicle dynamics. In order to achieve the fixed goal we begin by the brief but relevant study of the accident statistics, which justify the choice of three <b>characteristic</b> <b>manoeuvres,</b> causes of an important part of dangerous situations leading to accidents. These manoeuvres (a double lane change, a tight curve negotiating and a roundabout negotiating) are also representative of heavy vehicles actual manoeuvres in an urban context. The computer simulations of the driver-vehicle system subjected to the above-listed manoeuvres are performed using a non-linear 24 DOF single unit heavy vehicle model. In order to perform comparison between different GCC, a relatively simple PID-corrector based driver model is introduced, acting only on steering angle. The models were correlated with actual test data, ensuring that the driver control acts as a given driver. In order to evaluate vehicle performances, some criteria assigned to estimate the effectiveness, the lateral stability and the easiness of driving are established. Next, the vehicle dynamics controllers will be proposed and synthesized. Then, the vehicle behaviour will be tested and compared in different configurations: vehicle without any VDC-type controller and vehicle equipped by controllers coordinating the actions of different actuators installed on the vehicle. In that way, the effect of the progressive integration of actuators in the Global Chassis Control is studied. The results of this study will allow us to justify the use of one or another actuator and their combinations for vehicle dynamics control.

Experiments were performed {{in a group of}} 20 healthy volunteers undergoing controlled intermittent Mueller <b>Manoeuvres</b> (the key <b>characteristic</b> of the procedure is that a studied person is subjected to a controlled, increased inspiratory resistance which results in marked potentiation of the intrathoracic negative pressure). BP and heart rate (HR) were measured using continuous finger-pulse photoplethysmography; oxyhaemoglobin saturation with an ear-clip sensor; end-tidal CO 2 with a gas analyser; cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFV), pulsatility and resistive indices with Doppler ultrasound. Changes in SAS were recorded with a new method i. e. near-infrared transillumination/backscattering sounding. Wavelet transform analysis was used to assess the BP and SAS oscillations coupling. Initiating Mueller manoeuvres evoked cardiac SAS component decline (- 17. 8 %, P< 0. 001), systolic BP, diastolic BP and HR increase (+ 6. 3 %, P< 0. 001; 6. 7 %, P< 0. 001 and + 2. 3 %, P< 0. 05, respectively). By the end of Mueller manoeuvres, cardiac SAS component and HR did not change (+ 2. 3 % and 0. 0 %, respectively; both not statistically significant), but systolic and diastolic BP was elevated (+ 12. 6 % and + 8. 9 %, respectively; both P< 0. 001).

The differences between these two approaches are considered and the force expressions are found for both cases. This work gives rise to a discrepancy between the lift force expressions (sometimes referred to as the normal or side force) for the two approaches which leads to some interesting comparisons and conclusions.

40|$|Coastal development, such as land {{reclamation}} or dredging, usually changes {{the characteristics of}} the coastal waterway. A common phenomena due to restricted waterway is increase in ship resistance and reduction in manoeuvrability. The restricted water inflow under the vessel, result in increased water velocity under the hull. The increase of the inflow velocity at the rudder may result in the increase of the rudder normal force or create partial vacuum in the region near propeller and rudder. Consequently, manoeuvring of ships may become erratic in this condition. Standard for ship maneuvrabiity have been developed by International Maritime Organization (IMO) to ensure safe navigation/ship handling operation of ships. The standards provide criteria on the ship turning ability, yaw checking ability, course keeping ability and stopping ability. Where there is uncertainty in the behavior of the vessel especially in restricted waters, the use of numerical simulation for evaluating navigational risks is highly depended upon. In this paper, firstly, the effects on water depths and currents due to coastal development will be described. Secondly, using time domain simulation approach, the <b>manoeuvring</b> <b>characteristics</b> of vessel in two scenarios, i. e. deep and shallow water are discussed. Thirdly, actual simulations demonstrating the risks involved in navigating in a restricted waterway will be demonstrate...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In {{the field}} of {{aircraft}} landing analysis, {{the use of a}} multibody code such as ADAMS has enormous potential: it allows the designer to create as complex a model as desired, with the possibility of integrating subsystems and of accounting, for example, for aerodynamics and structural flexibility. In this paper, an approach to the application of ADAMS in the analysis of landing gear behaviour and ground <b>manoeuvring</b> <b>characteristics</b> of a trainer aircraft is presented. The models developed are to be used during the design phase for the evaluation of the loads transferred to the fuselage. The first step taken towards the implementation of the aircraft model was that of separately re-creating the behaviour of the auxiliary and main landing gear during drop-testing. In this phase, a rigid-body model was examined, along with built-in ADAMS tire models and external, user-written tire models. System components such as shock absorbers, for example, were modelled using the know-how previously acquired with a dedicated code. After having validated the ADAMS model using the results obtained in a parallel study conducted with the dedicated code, the auxiliary and main landing gear were assembled and a complete aircraft rigid-body model was built. The model was then used to simulate the behaviour of the landing system during ground manoeuvring, using linear aerodynamics. The model is planned to evolve, integrating flight mechanics for the approach and touch-down phase, and modelling the hydraulic subsystem...|$|E
40|$|The dynamic course {{stability}} of modern, fast, deep-V monohulls is still difficult to evaluate {{by means of}} purely theoretical methods and model tests with the specific design are generally necessary for new hull designs. There is not enough experimental data available concerning hydrodynamic derivatives and/or <b>manoeuvring</b> <b>characteristics</b> {{of these kinds of}} hulls to make it possible to assess even the elementary linear criteria of dynamic {{course stability}}. Moreover there does not yet seem to be any reliable theoretically method to calculate the hydrodynamic forces acting on a hull moving rectilinearly with a drift angle or moving around a circular path. Such theoretical methods should also include the contributions of waterjet inlets and other appendages and their interactions with the hull. As a part of the design activity of Fincantieri in the field of fast monohull ferries, an extensive investigation on optimisation of the course keeping ability of such of hulls has been conducted, by combining theory and experimental analysis (PMM tests). Alternative configurations, including minor hull modifications and various fixed and movable appendage configurations, have been evaluated from the course keeping and resistance points of view, resulting in the definition of the best options, which were applied to new designs and have been verified in full-scale trials. The various solutions will be presented and critically discussed in the paper, which also describes the simple theoretical approaches used to account for the 'fin effect' of waterjet inlets and various fin/hull and fin/waterjet interactions...|$|E
40|$|The {{trajectory}} of the inland waterway ship is important and useful in analysing {{the features of the}} ship behaviour and simulating traffic flows. In the proposed research, a method is designed to restore the {{trajectory of}} an inland waterway ship based on the Automatic Identification System (AIS) data. Firstly, three rules are developed to identify and remove the inaccurate data, based on the reception range of the received AIS data and the <b>manoeuvring</b> <b>characteristics</b> of the inland waterway ship. Secondly, the method of restoring the full trajectory incorporating navigational features of the inland waterway ship is proposed to model the ship trajectory. The trajectory is characterised by three types (line, curve and arc) and five steps (line, curve, arc, curve and line) during the turning section. In order to validate the proposed method, the AIS data of two inland waterway ships collected from three AIS-base-stations is selected for the analysis, all inaccurate AIS data is identified and removed by the use of three cleansing rules. The results show that the three developed rules can effectively identify the inaccurate AIS data. The AIS data collected by an AIS-shipboard-unit is then used to: (1) restore the ship trajectory, and (2) validate the proposed method by comparing the reconstituted trajectories with the actual trajectory. This actual trajectory is determined from intermediate higher frequency Global Positioning System (GPS) data and collected from the AIS-shipboard-unit. The residual errors are calculated as the differences between the estimated latitude values of the restored trajectory functions and the real latitude values of the GPS data. Three alternative methods of trajectory restoring are also evaluated. The results show that the proposed method can be used to restore the full trajectory in an effective manner by using AIS data...|$|E
