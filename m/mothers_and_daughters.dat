5|$|The {{first of}} Ravel's two operas, the one-act comedy L'heure espagnole was premiered in 1911. The {{work had been}} {{completed}} in 1907, but {{the manager of the}} Opéra-Comique, Albert Carré, repeatedly deferred its presentation. He was concerned that its plot – a bedroom farce – would be badly received by the ultra-respectable <b>mothers</b> <b>and</b> <b>daughters</b> who were {{an important part of the}} Opéra-Comique's audience. The piece was only modestly successful at its first production, and it was not until the 1920s that it became popular.|$|E

The researchers ultimately found, “R. marginata queens mate with 1–3 different males and the average relatedness among their daughters thus drops from the theoretically expected 0.75 to about 0.50, thus entirely negating the advantage of haplodiploidy for social evolution, as predicted by Hamilton” (851). Gadagkar “found no evidence for intra-colony kin recognition” (851).|$|E
25|$|Yeshivish is {{primarily}} a male spoken dialect. Fathers and sons, particularly of teenage years and above, might speak Yeshivish, while <b>mothers</b> <b>and</b> <b>daughters</b> generally do not, or they speak a milder variety of it. This can be explained {{as much of the}} Yeshivish lexicon is learned in Yeshivot where the studying takes place using a specialist nomenclature. Familiarity with these terms develops and they are then re-applied to other situations. There is a higher incidence of Yeshivish being spoken amongst Orthodox Jews that are regularly involved in Torah study, or belong to a community that promotes its study.|$|E
25|$|However, {{she does}} not believe that Islam is the root cause of gender {{inequality}} in the Muslim World because it is implemented differently in different countries, the status of women in the Muslim World is varied, and numerous other factors (state ideology, economic development, urbanization, etc.) affect gender equality. She points at that certain views which are considered by critics of Islam to be indicative of a gender-biased theology are present in other religions. Viewing women as <b>mothers</b> <b>and</b> <b>daughters</b> first and foremost, for example, is also a common belief among Orthodox Jews according to Moghadam.|$|E

25|$|With {{the firm}} {{guidance}} of 'ulema', the diverse native traditions were transformed to a uniform mold that crossed borders and customs. The original diverse traditions were consistently {{shaped to conform}} to specific norms embedded in the Islamic law. One notable exception in the Turco-Persian tradition was the attitude to the women. The original attitude of respect to the mothers, and protection of the sisters and daughters overcame the tenets imposed by the new religion, and survived as an inherent component of the learned new society. The idea of slaughtering <b>mothers</b> <b>and</b> <b>daughters,</b> incessantly proclaimed from the pulpits, remained a call for action, but not the action in the majority sphere of the Turco-Persian tradition. While {{the best of the}} Turco-Persian literature is venerated and admired, the respect for the women and the old traditions of equality generally survived to the present times, except for the areas where the Arab Islamic tradition managed to entirely replace the original native traditions. The early Turkish Muslims accepted and embraced the pre-Islamic traditions and combined them with their own in a form of Sufi mysticism. Less prominent were the strict Islamic law (Sharia) and concept of waging violent external jihad against nonbelievers. Instead, as Islam was diffused into the Turkic world through Persian Sufi influences, it sought to establish a commonality of belief with the indigenous religious practices. Despite a myriad of attempts to curb it, Sufism has survived in the Turkic zone as an underlying institution of revival and alternative thinking throughout the centuries.|$|E

500|$|In 1980, {{poet and}} essayist Adrienne Rich {{expanded}} upon the political meaning of lesbian by proposing {{a continuum of}} lesbian existence based on [...] "woman-identified experience". All relationships between women, Rich proposed, have some lesbian element, regardless if they claim a lesbian identity: <b>mothers</b> <b>and</b> <b>daughters,</b> women who work together, and women who nurse each other, for example. Such a perception of women relating to each other connects them through time and across cultures, and Rich considered heterosexuality a condition forced upon women by men. Several years earlier, DOB founders Del Martin and Phyllis Lyon similarly relegated sexual acts as unnecessary in determining what a lesbian is, by providing their definition: [...] "a woman whose primary erotic, psychological, emotional and social interest is in a member of her own sex, even though that interest may not be overtly expressed".|$|E

500|$|Studying the {{interaction}} {{of male and female}} hippopotamuses has long been complicated because hippos are not sexually dimorphic; thus females and young males are almost indistinguishable in the field. Although hippos lie close to each other, they do not seem to form social bonds except between <b>mothers</b> <b>and</b> <b>daughters,</b> and they are not social animals. The reason they huddle close together is unknown. Hippopotamuses are territorial only in water, where a bull presides over a small stretch of river, on average [...] in length, and containing 10 females. The largest pods can contain over 100 hippos. Younger bachelors are allowed in a bull's stretch, as long as they behave submissively toward the bull. The territories of hippos exist to establish mating rights. Within the pods, the hippos tend to segregate by gender. Bachelors lounge near other bachelors, females with other females, and the bull on his own. When hippos emerge from the water to graze, they do so individually.|$|E
