With six <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>team</b> that played in the last Test in 1926 having retired, Australia would field and young and inexperienced team.

When told that the two African-American <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>team</b> {{would not be allowed to}} play because of segregation, the team elected to refuse the bowl bid.

Kiryienka commented that the squad at the Giro hoped to get a further stage win (as Francisco Ventoso's win had come before Tondó's death) to honor him, while other <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>team</b> grieved with Tondó's family.
