2500|$|Former Bulgarian Foreign Minister and Atlantic Club of Bulgaria {{founding}} president Solomon Passy owned a Trabant {{which was}} blessed by Pope John Paul II in 2002 {{and which he}} took NATO Secretaries General Manfred Wörner, George Robertson, and Jaap de Hoop Scheffer for rides. In 2005, Passy donated the vehicle (which had become symbolic of Bulgaria's NATO accession) to the National Historical Museum of Bulgaria. In 1997 the Trabant was celebrated for passing the <b>moose</b> <b>test</b> without rolling over, as the Mercedes-Benz W168 had; a Thuringian newspaper's headline read, [...] "Come and get us, moose! Trabi passes A-Class killer test".|$|E
2500|$|During a <b>moose</b> <b>test</b> (swerving {{to avoid}} an obstacle), which became famous in Germany as [...] "the elk test", the Swedish {{journalist}} Robert Collin of Teknikens Värld (World of Technology) in October 1997 rolled a Mercedes A-Class (without ESC) at 78km/h. Because Mercedes-Benz promotes a reputation for safety, they recalled and retrofitted 130,000 A-Class cars with ESC. This produced {{a significant reduction in}} crashes and the number of vehicles with ESC rose. Today, virtually all premium brands have made ESC standard on all vehicles, and the number of models with ESC continues to increase. The availability of ESC in small cars like the A-Class ignited a market trend thus ESC became available for all models at least as an option. Consequently, the European Union decided in 2009 to make ESC mandatory. [...] Since November 1, 2011, EU Type Approval is only granted to models equipped with ESC. By November 1, 2014, ESC is required on all newly registered cars in the EU.|$|E

25|$|Since 2010, the Vermont Department of Health {{has worked}} with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to conduct blood serum surveys of the state's deer and <b>moose</b> populations. <b>Tests</b> for eastern equine {{encephalitis}} virus antibodies were positive in moose or deer in each of Vermont's counties. In 2012, 12% of deer and 2.4% of <b>moose</b> <b>tested</b> positive.|$|R
40|$|A {{serological}} {{survey for}} Brucella abortus antibodies in mature cow moose (Alces alces) {{was made in}} an area of northcentral British Columbia which recently had been heavily infected with bovine brucellosis and in which there was considerable intermixing of moose and range cattle. No evidence of Brucella infection was found in the <b>moose</b> <b>tested</b> and it was concluded that they were probably not of great significance in the epidemiology of bovine brucellosis in the study area and were therefore unlikely to have hindered attempts to eradicate brucellosis from the cattle in that area...|$|R
5000|$|The Swedish National Road and Transport Research Institute has {{developed}} a <b>moose</b> crash <b>test</b> dummy called [...] "Mooses". The dummy (which is made with similar weight, centre of gravity and dimensions to a live moose) is used to recreate realistic moose collisions.|$|R
50|$|On the {{occasion}} of being interviewed for {{an article in the}} Süddeutsche Zeitung, Collin tried to explain this test by the example of an evasive maneuver for a moose on the road. It was soon called Elchtest (<b>moose</b> <b>test).</b>|$|E
50|$|The evasive {{maneuver}} test (Swedish: Undanmanöverprov), {{more commonly}} known as the <b>moose</b> <b>test</b> or elk test (Swedish: Älgtest, German: Elchtest), is performed to determine how well a certain vehicle evades a suddenly appearing obstacle. This test has been standardized in ISO 3888-2.|$|E
5000|$|Mercedes-Benz A-Class - a tall {{car with}} a high center of gravity; early models showed {{excessive}} body roll during sharp swerving manoeuvres and rolled over, most particularly during the Swedish <b>moose</b> <b>test.</b> This was later corrected using Electronic Stability Control and retrofitted at great expense to earlier cars.|$|E
40|$|The {{database}} of the Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory, University of Minnesota, was searched over a ten year period (2001 - 2010) {{to determine the}} seroprevalence of Borrelia burgdorferi (B. burgdorferi) in elk (Cervus elaphus) and moose (Alces americanus) in Minnesota, A total of 597 serum samples (62 from elk and 535 from <b>moose)</b> were <b>tested</b> for antibodies against B. burgdorferi using an indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) test. Samples with titers of > 1 : 320 were considered positive. Out of 597 sera tested, 135 (27 %) were positive with IFA titers ranging between 1 : 320 and 1 : 1280. The rate of sero-prevalence was 52 in elk and 19 % in moose. These results indicate exposure of both species of cervidae to B. burgdorferi in Minnesot...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. S.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2001 Winter {{browsing}} {{of birch}} leads to chemical changes in {{leaves of the}} following growing season, potentially generating differences {{in the quality of}} leachates derived from leaf litter and in leachate use by stream microorganisms. The effects of <b>moose</b> browsing were <b>tested</b> on leachates from leaves collected from browsed and unbrowsed trees and inoculated with microbial communities. Respiration and bacterial abundance were used to assess qualitative differences in leachates. Microbes cultured in leachates derived from leaves of browsed trees had significantly higher rates of oxygen uptake. There {{were no significant differences in}} bacterial abundance between treatments. The basis for the qualitative difference in leachates is likely due to an 89 % greater concentration of amino acides in leachates derived from leaves of previously browsed trees. This study provides evidence that winter herbivory of birch can influence the use of leaf leachates by stream microbes, demonstrating coupling between riparian zones and stream ecosystems...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Moose (Alces alces) are colonizing {{previously}} unoccupied habitat {{along the}} tributaries {{of the lower}} Kuskokwim River within the Yukon Delta National Wildlife Refuge (YDNWR) of wes-tern Alaska. We delineated a new survey area to encompass these narrow (0. 7 – 4. 3 km) riparian corri-dors that are bounded by open tundra and routinely experience winter conditions that limit snow cover and depth necessary for traditional <b>moose</b> surveys. We <b>tested</b> a line-transect distance sampling approach {{as an alternative to}} estimate moose abundance in this region. Additionally, we compared standard semi-parametric detection functions available in the program Distance to a nonparametric kernel-based estimator not previously used for moose distance data. A double-observer technique was used to verify that the probability of detection at the minimum sighting distance was 1. 0 (standard assumption). Average moose group size was 2. 03 and not correlated with distance from the transect line. The top semi-parametric model in the program Distance was a hazard-rate key function with no expansion terms. This model estimated average probability of detection as 0. 70 with an estimated abundance of 352 moose (95 % CI = 237 – 540). The CV for the semi-parametric model was 20 % and had an estimated bias of 1. 4 %. The nonparametric kernel-based model had an average probability of detection of 0. 73 and an estimated abundance of 340 (95 % CI = 238 – 472) moose. The CV fo...|$|R
50|$|The {{magazine}} {{is known for}} their thorough automobile tests and gained worldwide attention in 1997 when the Mercedes-Benz A-Class overturned in their <b>moose</b> <b>test.</b> It primarily features automotive news, reviews and test drives of passenger cars from various segments. Books are also published under the name, e.g. annual new and used cars guides.|$|E
50|$|NHTSA has {{conducted}} numerous high-profile investigations of automotive safety issues, including the Audi 5000/60 Minutes affair, the Ford Explorer rollover {{problem and the}} Toyota: Sticky accelerator pedal problem. The agency has introduced a proposal to mandate Electronic Stability Control on all passenger vehicles by the 2012 model year. This technology was first brought to public attention in 1997, with the Swedish <b>moose</b> <b>test.</b>|$|E
50|$|On October 21, 1997, the {{journalist}} Robert Collin from the motor magazine Teknikens Värld overturned the new Mercedes-Benz A-Class in the <b>moose</b> <b>test,</b> while a Trabant —a much older, and widely mocked {{car from the}} former East Germany— later managed it perfectly. In July 2005, the Dacia Logan appeared initially to fail the test, but a later investigation concluded that excessive testing had worn the car's tires to failure.|$|E
50|$|The {{ability of}} a vehicle to handle sudden changes in {{direction}} at high speeds without sliding or rolling over is assessed through the so-called <b>moose</b> <b>test.</b> This scenario occurs when the driver is trying to avoid an obstacle (ostensibly a moose, or any other large animal that may appear on the road) {{in his or her}} lane and then returning to the lane to avoid oncoming traffic. The succession of sharp turns in opposite directions combined with lifting off the throttle is exactly how the Scandinavian flick is performed. Since the technique is used at race speeds, it's not normal for a vehicle to start a slide while driving at road speeds.|$|E
50|$|An {{important}} {{event in the}} show's history was when a Škoda failed miserably in a road test, flipping over while turning in 30 km/h. History repeated itself in 1997, when Trafikmagasinet together with the car magazine Teknikens Värld overturned the new Mercedes-Benz A-Class during testing. Mercedes-Benz initially claimed that the car had been manipulated and threatened to sue the journalists, but finally {{had to admit that}} the car was unsafe during sharp turns at high speed. The A-Class was re-released with Electronic Stability Control, and the episode gave some fame to the expression <b>moose</b> <b>test</b> - this due to Mercedes-Benz' initial attempt to ridicule the failed test and claim that it was only of interest to Swedes.|$|E
5000|$|Swedish {{automotive}} magazine Teknikens Värld tests [...] "hundreds of cars every year" [...] {{with the}} <b>moose</b> <b>test.</b> It publishes results from {{many years of}} moose testing on their web site It shows many cars and the speed they had on the moose testing track. The Citroën Xantia Activa V6 is the fastest car, by a significant margin, ever tested by the magazine and holds the record since 1999. This means the Xantia Activa V6 - a high-end large family car - is faster than cars like the track-oriented 2008 Porsche 911 GT3 RS or the 2017 Mclaren 675LT supercar. A Toyota Prius is substantially quicker than a Saab 9-3 in the same test.|$|E
50|$|Wim Ouboter, born in 1960 {{invented the}} kickscooter out of laziness. He states, {{that the way}} from his apartement to his {{favorite}} restaurant was too far to go by foot and yet too close to use a bike. He then invented a foldable, two-wheeled Scooter for those kind of distances that could easily be folded anytime {{and placed in a}} backpack. He pitched his idea to Smart and they were willing to put one Scooter in every single car. Ouboter then tried to find a manufacturer for his innovation, but soon realized that Europe simply was too expensive. In Taiwan he could convince the owner of a factory to produce the Scooter, also because he had proof that Smart liked his idea. Just before the production could start Smart failed the <b>moose</b> <b>test</b> and so the project was put on hold, since Smart had to solve that problem.|$|E
