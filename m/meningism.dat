25|$|Bonnet–Dechaume–Blanc syndrome, {{also known}} as Wyburn-Mason syndrome, is a rare congential {{arteriovenous}} malformation of the brain, retina or facial nevi. The syndrome {{has a number of}} possible symptoms and can affect the skin, bones, kidneys, muscles, and gastrointestinal tract. When the syndrome affects the brain, people can experience severe headaches, seizures, acute stroke, <b>meningism</b> and progressive neurological deficits due to acute or chronic ischaemia caused by arteriovenous shunting.|$|E
25|$|The {{extent of}} {{the central nervous system}} (CNS) features/symptoms of Bonnet–Dechaume–Blanc {{syndrome}} is highly dependent of the location of the cerebral AVMs and the {{extent of the}} malformation. The most common symptom affecting the CNS is an intracranial hemangioma in the midbrain. Along with hemangiomas, the malformations result in severe headaches, cerebral hemorrhages, vomiting, <b>meningism,</b> seizures, acute strokes or progressive neurological deficits due to acute or chronic ischaemia caused by arteriovenous shunting.|$|E
25|$|Central nervous system: Frequently {{occurring}} {{side effects}} are dizziness, headache, and malaise. Drowsiness, somnolence, fatigue, and vertigo {{have also been}} seen. Almost all patients with cerebral cysticercosis experience CNS side effects related to the cell-death of the parasites (headache, worsening of pre-existing neurological problems, seizures, arachnoiditis, and <b>meningism).</b> These side effects may be life-threatening and can be reduced by coadministration of corticosteroids. It is strongly recommended that all patients with cerebral cysticercosis are hospitalized during treatment.|$|E
500|$|The classic {{symptom of}} subarachnoid {{hemorrhage}} is thunderclap headache (a headache described as [...] "like being {{kicked in the}} head", or the [...] "worst ever", developing over seconds to minutes). This headache often pulsates towards the occiput (the back of the head). About one-third of people have no symptoms apart from the characteristic headache, and about one in ten people who seek medical care with this symptom are later diagnosed with a subarachnoid hemorrhage. Vomiting may be present, and 1 in 14 have seizures. Confusion, decreased level of consciousness or coma may be present, as may neck stiffness and other signs of <b>meningism.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Meningism,</b> {{also called}} meningismus or pseudomeningitis, {{is a set}} of {{symptoms}} similar to those of meningitis but not caused by meningitis. Whereas meningitis is inflammation of the meninges (membranes that cover the central nervous system), <b>meningism</b> is caused by nonmeningitic irritation of the meninges, usually associated with acute febrile illness, especially in children and adolescents. <b>Meningism</b> involves the triad (3-symptom syndrome) of nuchal rigidity (neck stiffness), photophobia (intolerance of bright light), and headache. It therefore requires differentiating from other CNS problems with similar symptoms, including meningitis and some types of intracranial hemorrhage. Related clinical signs include Kernig's sign and three signs all named Brudzinski's sign.|$|E
50|$|Other {{problems}} can produce symptoms {{similar to those}} above, but from non-meningitic causes. This is called <b>meningism</b> or pseudomeningitis.|$|E
50|$|Fever and {{headache}} are {{the cardinal}} features, confusion is a late feature and coma bears a poor prognosis. <b>Meningism</b> is absent in {{a fifth of}} patients with TB meningitis. Patients may also have focal neurological deficits.|$|E
50|$|The main {{clinical}} signs that indicate <b>meningism</b> are nuchal rigidity, Kernig's sign and Brudzinski's signs. None {{of the signs}} are particularly sensitive; in adults with meningitis, nuchal rigidity was present in 30% and Kernig's or Brudzinski's sign only in 5%.|$|E
50|$|In subarachnoid {{hemorrhage}}, {{there may}} be syncope (transient loss of consciousness), seizures, <b>meningism</b> (neck pain and stiffness), visual symptoms, and vomiting. 50-70% of people with subarachnoid hemorrhage have an isolated headache without decreased level of consciousness. The headache typically persists for several days.|$|E
5000|$|Brudziński's sign or a Brudziński sign is any {{of three}} medical signs, {{all of which}} may occur in {{meningitis}} or <b>meningism.</b> All three are named after Józef Brudziński.

5000|$|Some {{suggest that}} Hippocrates may have {{realized}} {{the existence of}} meningitis, {{and it seems that}} <b>meningism</b> was known to pre-Renaissance physicians such as Avicenna. The description of tuberculous meningitis, then called [...] "dropsy in the brain", is often attributed to Edinburgh physician Sir Robert Whytt in a posthumous report that appeared in 1768, although the link with tuberculosis and its pathogen was not made until the next century.|$|E

5000|$|Kemerovo tickborne viral fever is an aparalytic febrile illness {{accompanied}} by <b>meningism</b> following tick-bite. [...] The causative agent is a zoonotic Orbivirus first described in 1963 in western Siberia by Mikhail Chumakov and coworkers. [...] The virus has some 23 serotypes, and {{can occur in}} coinfections with other Orbiviruses and tick-transmitted encephalitis viruses, complicating the course of illness. [...] Rodents and birds are the primary vertebrate hosts of the virus; Ixodes persulcatus ticks are a vector of the virus. [...] Kemerovo and related viruses may be translocated distances in the environment by migratory birds.|$|E

50|$|Viliuisk Encephalomyelitis (VE) is a fatal {{progressive}} {{neurological disorder}} {{found only in}} the Sakha (Iakut/Yakut) population of central Siberia. About 15 new cases are reported each year. VE is a very rare disease and {{little research has been}} conducted. The causative agents, origin of the disease, and involved candidate genes are currently unknown, but much research has been done in pursuit of the answers.Those inflicted with the disease survive for a period of only a few months to several years. VE follows three main courses of infection: an acute form, a sub-acute form subsiding into a progressive form, and a chronic form. Initially, the infected patients experience symptoms such as: severe headaches, delirium, lethargy, <b>meningism,</b> bradykinesia, and incoordination. A small percentage of patients die during the acute phase as result of a severe coma. In all cases the disease is fatal.|$|E
40|$|A case of spinal subarachnoid {{haemorrhage}} with progressive spinal cord compression {{and without any}} evidence of <b>meningism</b> is described. Spinal block was demonstrated by myelography and computerized tomography and surgical decompression of the subarachnoid blood clot resulted in almost complete recovery.

30|$|The {{second most}} {{frequent}} symptom is the visual deficit, ranging from 50 to 82  % of cases [5, 13, 20 – 25], followed by nausea, vomiting, ocular palsy and <b>meningism</b> (25 – 50  %).|$|E
40|$|Background. Although routine lumbar {{puncture}} (LP) is often recommended {{as part of}} the assessment of fever-associated seizures in children, accumulating evidence questions its value and reveals a decrease in its frequency. Our primary hypothesis was that children who present with a single seizure but with no clinical signs of <b>meningism</b> or coma do not require LP as part of initial diagnostic assessment. Methods. We prospectively followed up 377 children aged 2 months through 10 years who presented with at least 1 fever-associated seizure to Modilon Hospital, Madang, Papua New Guinea, from November 2007 through July 2009. Clinical management was performed by hospital staff according to national pediatric guidelines. Results. Of 188 children with a single seizure and 189 children with multiple seizures, 139 (73. 9 %) and 154 (81. 5 %), respectively, underwent a LP {{as part of the}}ir initial assessment. Of the 130 children with a single seizure but no evidence of <b>meningism</b> (ie, neck stiffness, positive Kernig’s or Brudzinski’s sign, and bulging fontanelle) or coma (Blantyre Coma Score 2), none (95 % confidence interval, 0 %– 3. 6 %) had proven or probable acute bacterial meningitis, and only 1 patient had viral encephalitis (subacute sclerosing panencephalitis). Eighty-one of these children (62. 3 %) had a final diagnosis of a simple febrile seizure. Proven or probable acute bacterial meningitis was more common in children with a single seizure and <b>meningism</b> or coma (10; 17. 2 %) and in those with multiple seizures without or with <b>meningism</b> or coma (2 [2. 0 %] and 30 [33. 7 %], respectively) ...|$|E
40|$|The authors {{report on}} a patient {{presenting}} with subarachnoid hemorrhage that {{was caused by a}} rupture of an spinal combined arteriovenous malformation at cervicothoracic junction. The patient was a 30 -year-old female, who had exhibited an abrupt onset of severe low neck and occipital pain with radiation into shoulders and vomiting. Neurological examination revealed severe <b>meningism</b> without motor or sensory deficit. Digital subtraction angiography did not demonstrate any intracranial source of bleeding, whereas spinal angiography revealed a spinal arteriovenous malformation at cervicothoracic junction. Endovascular treatment of the malformation was considered for this patient. Occipital and neck pain with radiation into shoulders and severe <b>meningism</b> are clues pointing to a spinal origin of the haemorrhage...|$|E
40|$|A {{girl with}} {{chickenpox}} is presented. She developed arthritis, pericarditis with pericardial effusion and <b>meningism</b> {{during the course}} of her illness.

30|$|CNS {{involvement}} {{is thought to}} occur by several mechanisms: intracranial vasculitis; involvement of the skull base or nearby structures via direct spread from the paranasal sinuses; or independent granulomatous inflammation of the meninges or brain, without direct spread from the respiratory tract [104]. Clinical presentation is typically with seizures, <b>meningism,</b> cranial nerve palsy or ischaemic phenomena due to intracranial vasculitis. Treatment is aimed at reducing inflammation with immunosuppressive agents such as glucocorticoids and cyclophosphamide.|$|E
40|$|Several {{biochemical}} markers in the {{cerebrospinal fluid}} (CSF) of 120 patients with serous meningoencephalitis (SM) of viral origin {{were compared with}} those of 74 patients with viral or bacterial infections accompanied by neck stiffness but no CSF abnormality (i. e., <b>meningism).</b> CSF adenylate kinase was higher (P less than 0. 025) in SM and correlated with lactate concentration (r = 0. 37; P less than 0. 01). CSF hypoxanthine was lower (P less than 0. 001) in SM, whereas CSF xanthine was similar in the two conditions. The xanthine/hypoxathine ratio correlated with the CSF leukocyte count (r = 0. 32; P less than 0. 01), and especially with the mononuclear cell count (r = 0. 45; P less than 0. 001). CSF adenylate kinase correlated with fever in SM (r = 0. 28; P less than 0. 01). CSF urate and protein displayed a mutual correlation in both conditions (r = 0. 26 and P less than 0. 05 for SM; r = 0. 55 and P less than 0. 001 for <b>meningism).</b> These results support the hypothesis of impaired brain cell metabolism, probably of ischemic nature, in viral meningoencephalitis, causing leakage of adenylate kinase into the CSF, where hypoxanthine may be reutilized by mononuclear leukocytes...|$|E

Chills and rigors associated with myalgias and arthralgias followed. Two days later she developed right-sided headaches, which got worse {{over the next few}} days. Vital signs were normal on presentation. Physical examination did not reveal any signs of <b>meningism,</b> respiratory, abdominal or urogenital infection. Her past medical history was significant for a lumbar laminectomy, depression, gastroesophageal reflux disease, hysterectomy and bladder suspen-sion. Her medications included rabeprazole and paroxetine. She did not smoke or drink and denie...|$|E
30|$|Meningovascular {{neurosyphilis}} develops {{several years}} after T. pallidum infection. It typically manifests as <b>meningism,</b> intracranial hypertension, and cerebral infarction. Patients often have restlessness, emotional instability, personality changes, and other neuropsychiatric symptoms (Dourmishev and Dourmishev 2005). The most frequent clinical presentation of meningovascular syphilis is stroke (Feng et al. 2009), but in this case, there were no episodes of stroke. Histologically, the inflammation is mononuclear, specifically lymphoplasmacytic, as {{in the present case}} (Feng et al. 2009). Neurosyphilis also causes Heubner arteritis, which is characterized by thickening and lymphocytic infiltration of the intima, which can induce a stroke syndrome (Brown and Gray 2008; Sakai et al. 2014). However, {{there was no evidence of}} Heubner arteritis in the present case.|$|E
40|$|An eleven {{year old}} girl was {{admitted}} to the paediatric ward with a twenty four hour history of fever, headache, vomiting and, latterly, convulsions. On examination she was febrile and unrousable with a Blantyre coma score of zero l, but with no <b>meningism</b> or neurological signs. The most obvious abnormality was that the left eye, entirely normal six hours previously, was completely opaque and appeared to be filled with thick white material. A lumbar puncture was performed, yielding cloudy CSF and, based on the microscopy and Gram stain appearance, a diagno-sis of meningococcal meningitis was made. She was commenced on intravenous Benzylpenicillin and Chloramphenicol as well as anticonvulsant medication. An ophthalmological opinion was obtained. Exami...|$|E
40|$|The results {{found and}} the {{laboratory}} methods {{used for the}} isolation of viruses and β haemolytic streptococci in two MRC/PHLS surveys of respiratory disease in patients in hospital and general practice are described. 717 viruses and 82 β haemolytic streptococci were isolated from 2418 children in hospital and 835 viruses and 435 strains of β haemolytic streptococci from patients seen in general practice. Virus isolation rates in the two surveys were 28 · 9 % and 21 · 0 % respectively.
