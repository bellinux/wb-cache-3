25|$|Development in Dandenong had stagnated {{since the}} opening of the Dandenong Plaza {{shopping}} centre which resulted in the closure of many shops in the central business district. Under the Melbourne 2030 policy, Dandenong was classified as a <b>major</b> <b>activity</b> <b>centre</b> due to its central location with regard to its access to transport. These projects can be considered to be transit-oriented development, where population density is intended to be higher compared to other areas with poorer access to transport.|$|E

50|$|Laverton's runway was {{decommissioned}} September 1996. In early 2007 the Victorian State Government gave {{approval for}} the land that was formally the Laverton airfield and runway to be developed into the new suburb of Williams Landing. Three areas totalling 55 ha were set aside for conservation. More than 100 ha of nationally significant native grassland outside the reserves was permitted to be cleared by the state- and federal governments. Williams Landing is being developed into a transit-oriented development, <b>major</b> <b>activity</b> <b>centre</b> and employment node. As well as being a <b>major</b> <b>activity</b> <b>centre</b> and employment node, {{there will also be}} four residential neighbourhoods each with their own distinctive character. Construction of Williams Landing commenced in late 2007 and is due for completion by 2025.|$|E

The latest focus advocates a polycentric city with new six subcentres {{in addition to the}} CBD areas, called Central Activity Districts, such as Box Hill, Broadmeadows, Footscray, Frankston and Ringwood [7]. In contrast, Riyadh’s land use and transport polices have adopted a polycentric model, identifying six subcentres with traditional centres in the future master plan 2030 [8].|$|R
50|$|Cheltenham {{is one of}} 82 {{higher order}} Major Activity Centres {{identified}} by the Melbourne 2030 growth planning policy.

50|$|Burnside Heights, {{although}} a young suburb, is well established, with nearby schools, medical centres, a kindergarten, a gymnasium and an AFL & cricket oval. Burnside Heights has several large shopping centres in close proximity, including Watergardens and Brimbank Central. Its major draw card is its close proximity (500 meters) to Caroline Springs CBD {{which is a}} <b>major</b> <b>activity</b> <b>centre</b> for the area. In December 2010 the Watervale Shopping Centre was established within the suburb.|$|E
50|$|The network {{originally}} operated along bus trunk routes {{through the}} inner suburbs, but {{passed through the}} CBD rather than terminating there. This reduced overcrowding on the trunk routes without needing to layover extra buses in the CBD. This concept was later diluted with the network's expansion to include long distance routes servicing <b>major</b> <b>activity</b> <b>centres</b> in outer suburbs.|$|R

In 2010, Kingston City Council proposed a major redevelopment of the station environs, including a new station forecourt with a terraced plaza, giving more prominence to the heritage listed buildings at the station, and a new taxi rank, similar to that at Mentone. The proposal had not been implemented. More recently, in October 2015, the station toilets were refurbished.|$|E

50|$|Brunswick East {{is an area}} in transition. Lygon Street {{and parts}} of Nicholson Street are its main {{activity}} centres, {{with a mix of}} commercial, retail, community and light industrial in the former, and a bias towards light industrial and residential in the latter. Rises in land values due to gentrification, have resulted in many of the industrial uses vacating their buildings, which have become attractive to developers of medium and higher-density residential projects, often with a small commercial or retail component. Many of these projects have been contentious among the local community, the most notable being a proposal for a 16-storey tower immediately to the north of a Maternal and Child Health Centre. Local groups such as the Brunswick Progress Association have been active in anti-development campaigns, along with the local branch of Save Our Suburbs, Brunswick Residents Against Inappropriate Development. In 2006, Moreland City Council commenced a consultative process to develop a Structure Plan for the Brunswick <b>Major</b> <b>Activity</b> <b>Centre,</b> whose study area incorporates Lygon Street, Nicholson Street and much of the adjoining suburb of Brunswick.|$|E

40|$|Continued {{population}} growth in Melbourne {{over the past decade}} has {{led to the development of}} a range of strategies and policies by State and Local levels of government to set an agenda for a more sustainable form of urban development. As the Victorian State government moves towards the development of 2 ̆ 7 Plan Melbourne 2 ̆ 7, a new metropolitan planning strategy currently being prepared to take Melbourne forward to 2050, the following paper addresses the issue of how new residential built form will impact on and be accommodated in existing Inner Melbourne <b>activity</b> <b>centres.</b> Working with the prospect of establishing a more compact city in order to meet an inner city target of 90, 000 new dwellings (Inner Metropolitan Action Plan - IMAP Strategy 5), the paper presents a 2 ̆ 7 Housing Variance Model 2 ̆ 7 based on household structure and dwelling type. As capacity is progressively altered through a range of built form permutations, the research attempts to assess the impact on the urban morphology of a case study of four <b>Major</b> <b>Activity</b> <b>Centres</b> in the municipality of Port Phillip...|$|R

40|$|This {{study is}} {{concerned}} with current and emerging transportation problems in Nigeria’s Federal Capital Territory. The major objective is to identify and characterize the main challenges confronting mobility in the capital territory and propose a viable institutional framework for effective transportation management in FCT. The study is based on information arising from field auditing and evaluation of Abuja Master Plan. Information on extent of implementation of the transportation plan, level of distortion to and deviations from the plan, observable anomalies in traffic management and bottlenecks to traffic flow, provision and conditions of transport furniture  and other relevant information from FCDA published materials provided the required data for the study. The study identifies the current challenges to include non-development of transit ways to <b>major</b> <b>activity</b> <b>centres,</b> emergence of illegal bus stations, poor parking facilities, absence of pedestrian walkways, widespread use of low-occupancy vehicles for public transport, city-wide traffic congestion, growth of squatter and shanty settlements, safety and administrative challenges. The study notes that the challenges are due to the inefficiency of the present institutional mechanism for managing transport in the city. Based on this premise, the study recommends the establishment of Abuja Area Transportation Authority as a sustainable transportation management strategy for FCT...|$|R
40|$|The {{construction}} of a high speed rail project may both contribute to strategic transport policy goals, {{and at the same}} time it may result in negative impacts. Among them, this paper addresses the issue of the conflict between efficiency (economic) vs. equity (social) effects of high speed rail projects. If the only objective was the maximization of economic growth, the best solution would attempt to improve rail connections between <b>major</b> <b>activity</b> <b>centres.</b> However, this strategy would have a negative impact on equity, as it would lead to more polarized spatial development patterns. Current transport assessment methodologies lack a common procedure to deal with this trade-off. In this context, the paper develops a spatial analysis procedure, based in the use of accessibility measures, to address these conflicting effects. On the one hand, efficiency effects are measured in terms of accessibility improvements. On the other hand, changes in the distribution of regional accessibility values are used to assess equity implications, via the calculation of a set of inequality indices. The proposed procedure is intended to support transport planners when confronted with the task to optimize efficiency and equity objectives. The validity of the methodology is tested with its application to alternative corridor developments of the Spanish high speed network based on the 2020 scenario included in the Spanish Strategic Transport and Infrastructure Plan 2005 - 2020 (PEIT) ...|$|R
