40|$|Solvents used {{to clean}} oxygen system {{components}} must be assessed for oxygen compatibility, as incompatible residue or fluid inadvertently left behind within an oxygen system can pose a flammability risk. The most recent approach focused on solvent ignition susceptibility {{to assess the}} flammability risk associated with these materials. Previous evaluations included Ambient Pressure Liquid Oxygen (LOX) <b>Mechanical</b> <b>Impact</b> <b>Testing</b> (ASTM G 86) and Autogenous Ignition Temperature (AIT) Testing (ASTM G 72). The goal in this approach was to identify a solvent material that was not flammable in oxygen. As environmental policies restrict the available options of acceptable solvents, it has proven difficult to identify one that is not flammable in oxygen. A more rigorous oxygen compatibility approach is needed {{in an effort to}} select a new solvent for NASA applications. NASA White Sands Test Facility proposed an approach that acknowledges oxygen flammability, yet selects solvent materials based on their relative oxygen compatibility ranking, similar to that described in ASTM G 63 - 99. Solvents are selected based on their ranking with respect to minimal ignition susceptibility, damage and propagation potential, as well as their relative ranking when compared with other solvent materials that are successfully used in oxygen systems. Test methods used in this approach included ASTM G 86 (Ambient Pressure LOX <b>Mechanical</b> <b>Impact</b> <b>Testing</b> and Pressurized Gaseous Oxygen (GOX) <b>Mechanical</b> <b>Impact</b> <b>Testing),</b> ASTM G 72 (AIT Testing), and ASTM D 240 (Heat of Combustion (HOC) Testing). Only four solvents were tested through the full battery of tests for evaluation of oxygen compatibility: AK- 225 G as a baseline comparison, Solstice PF, L- 14780, and Vertrel MCA. Baseline solvent AK- 225 G exhibited the lowest HOC and highest AIT of solvents tested. Nonetheless, Solstice PF, L- 14780, and Vertrel MCA HOCs all fell well within the range of properties that are associated with proven oxygen system materials. Tested AITs for these solvents fell only slightly lower than the AIT for the proven AK- 225 G solvent. Based on these comparisons in which solvents exhibited properties within those ranges seen with proven oxygen system materials, it is believed that Solstice PF, L- 14780, and Vertrel MCA would perform well with respect to oxygen compatibility...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} whether certain ground reaction force parameters such as impact force (F 1), second maximum force (F 2), loading rate, stance time and average vertical ground reaction force (Fzavg) differ when 11 - 13 year old children run in a neutral shoe (Nike Air Pegasus+ 25) that is either a child or adult style. Shoes were impact tested in an impact test instrument to determine any performance differences between the two shoes. Next, 10 healthy female subjects aged 12. 03 ± 1. 14 years with a height of 154. 6 ± 4. 90 cm and a mass of 46. 18 ± 14. 33 kg with a shoe size between 3. 5 and 7 youth were recruited from the Las Vegas area to run 9 meters, a maximum of 40 times in the two shoes over a force platform. Loading rate was calculated using two methods: (1) rate of change in force between ground contact and F 1, and (2) rate of change of force within 10 ms bin between ground contact and 50 ms. In addition to recording biomechanical parameters, after each condition subjects filled out a survey to determine personal comfort for each shoe. Dependent variables (shoe impact data, F 1, F 2, Fzavg, stance time and loading rate) were analyzed using paired t-tests. Loading rate bins were analyzed using a 2 (shoe) x 5 (bin) repeated measures ANOVA. Survey data were analyzed using a paired t-test. From the <b>mechanical</b> <b>impact</b> <b>test</b> analysis, it was determined that there were significant differences in force, peak acceleration and percent energy between shoes (p 3 ̆c. 001). From the running test, it was determined that, loading rate was different (p=. 009) between shoe conditions whereas F 1, F 2, stance time, or average vertical ground reaction force were not different between shoes (p 3 ̆e. 01). It was also determined that there was no difference in loading rate between bins (p 3 ̆e. 05). From the survey data, it was determined that heel cushioning was the only parameter that was different (p=. 004) between shoes. In order to prevent overuse injuries, it has been reported that a lower loading rate can prevent possible overuse injuries. Because a larger loading rate was observed while running in the children 2 ̆ 7 s shoes it is concluded that the lower loading rate for the subject wearing the adult shoe may reduce overuse injury and is the better shoe choice for girls aged 11 - 13 years old (Nigg, 1997) ...|$|E

In this work, the application of SHCC for producing cover plates for light switches and power sockets is presented. For design and decorative industry, cement based materials are appealing and look more natural compared to variety of plastics usually used. However, their inherent brittleness makes it difficult to be produced as very thin products, mainly due to issues with demoulding. With the addition of fibres, thin elements could be successfully demoulded. They were further subjected to standard mechanical and durability tests for this type of product. These tests included exposure to high temperatures (70 °C and 95 °C), varying RH (from 95 % to 50 %), and <b>mechanical</b> <b>impact</b> hardness <b>tests.</b> After these tests, samples were tested in four point bending in order to check how different exposure conditions and mechanical preloading influence the strain hardening capacity. Two different mixtures were designed, with a plate thickness of 3 mm and 5 mm. Slender samples cast in thinner moulds resulted in enhanced ductility due to preferential fibre orientation in plane. Samples that were exposed to high temperatures exhibited lower ductility compared to samples cured at room temperature.

In order to improve the interfacial adhesion between hydrophobic and nonpolar thermoplastics and hydrophilic and polar wood flour different additives {{have been used as}} compatibilizers in composites systems. The interaction between a wood filler and thermoplastic matrix, with and without compatibilizers, has been studied using conventional <b>mechanical</b> <b>testing,</b> <b>impact</b> <b>testing,</b> dynamic <b>mechanical</b> thermal analysis (DMTA), electron microscopes and infrared spectroscopy. Tests of mechanical properties, such as maximum tensile strength, tensile modulus and impact strength have shown that maleic anhydride grafted styrene-ethylene/butylene-styrene triblock copolymer (SEBS-MA) acts as a compatibilizer in the composite system. The SEBS-MA improves the stress transfer from the matrix to the wood particles and forming an flexible interphase around the wood particle and therefore improves the impact properties. The DMTA measurements indicated that there is an interaction between the wood surfaces and the maleic anhydride part of the SEBS-MA copolymer, and also between PS and wood. Morphological studies with SEM and TEM showed that the addition of SEBS-MA improved the adhesion between the wood particles and polymer matrix and that the compatibilizer is located at the interphase region between them.

Sautés are a two-legged dance jump used {{as a foundation for}} more complex jumps. The aims of this thesis were to explore the impact attenuation properties of jazz shoes and their effect on sauté height, landing and takeoff technique, and impact attenuation. A systematic review of the literature was undertaken to examine the impact attenuation effect of conventional shoes compared to barefoot during weight-bearing activities (Chapter 2). Few studies investigated the effect of shoes on jump landings, with no studies investigating dance shoes. <b>Mechanical</b> <b>impact</b> <b>testing</b> of four different jazz shoe designs was performed to determine their impact attenuation properties. The newest jazz sneaker design was the most impact attenuating jazz shoe despite another design having a thicker sole. 3 D motion analysis of dancers performing a series of eight sautés in the different shoes with and without music was undertaken. Jump height was reduced in the high-heeled shoes compared to all other shoe conditions with a subsequent increase in stance time to synchronise with the music (Chapter 3). Knee flexion was greater in high-heeled shoes, and ankle flexion was greater in all jazz shoes than barefoot. Conversely, midfoot and MPJ motion was reduced by all jazz shoe designs (Chapter 4). Knee joint stiffness was reduced in high heeled shoes and both sneaker designs compared to barefoot (Chapter 5). The jazz shoes reduced midfoot joint velocity thus restricting midfoot joint power, with the opposite effect at the ankle during both landing and propulsive phases (Chapter 6). The jazz shoes tested in this thesis altered lower limb motion, with larger kinematic and kinetic changes displayed in the Chorus shoes resulting in a subsequent decrease in jump height.

40|$|Multilayer {{films of}} a {{conventional}} linear low-density poly(ethylene/α-octene) (LLDPE) and a metallocene linear low-density poly(ethylene/α-hexene) (mLLDPE) copolymers were produced by cast co-extrusion process. Coextruded films were obtained by varying the position and the relative thicknesses of the two polymers. <b>Mechanical</b> (tensile and <b>impact)</b> <b>tests,</b> permeability, haze and hot tack measurements were carried out on the produced films in order to verify the effect of layer composition and position on the performances of the coextruded samples. Thermal and atomic force microscopy characterizations of the three-layer structures were also performed to correlate the resulting morphology with the film properties. The experiments demonstrated that, at fixed composition, the structures having the mLLDPE copolymer as external layers exhibit generally better mechanical performances and a widening in the sealability temperature window due to a lowering of 5 °C in the seal-initiation temperature, with only a small increase (max 3. 5 %) in the film haze percentages.

40|$|In this research, a {{new method}} for the {{production}} of the blend consists of polyester resin as a matrix-binder at fixed weigh and different weighs of epoxy resin {{that can be used to}} coat wood is developed. Several experiments are performed under different conditions to identify the most favorable operating conditions for the preparation of blend (polyester/epoxy) resins. Optimum conditions, namely, mixing speed, mixing time, heating temperature and heating time are investigated and found experimentally as 500 rpm, 5 min, 75 0 C and 6 hr respectively. In addition, solid palms wastes (lignin) as reinforcement fibers is employed in order to improve the <b>mechanical</b> properties: <b>impact</b> strength, bending deflection and bending distortion of coated wood. The optimum ratio of prepared blend is characterized by the <b>mechanical</b> (<b>impact</b> and bending) <b>tests</b> of the untreated samples occurred at a ratio of polyester/epoxy resins of 0. 91 w/w. It showed the best bonding force and physical interaction between two resins. The impact strength of the treated samples with one and two layers of prepared lignin fibers are higher than that of the untreated sample, while the bending distortion and bending deflection of treated samples are lower than that of the untreated sample. Experimental results showed that the treated sample with biofibers (lignin) led to enhancement in the mechanical properties of coated wood. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{product of}} {{incomplete}} reaction of monomethylhydrazine (MMH) and nitrogen tetroxide (NTO) propellants, or fuel-oxidizer reaction product (FORP), has been hypothesized as a contributory cause of an anomaly which {{occurred in the}} chamber pressure (PC) transducer tube on the Reaction Control Subsystem (RCS) aft thruster 467 on flight STS- 51. A small hole {{was found in the}} titanium-alloy PC tube at the first bend below the pressure transducer. It was surmised that the hole may have been caused by heat and pressure resulting from ignition of FORP. The NASA Johnson Space Center (JSC) White Sands Test Facility (WSTF) was requested to define the chemical characteristics of FORP, characterize its reactivity, and simulate the events in a controlled environment which may have lead to the Pc-tube failure. Samples of FORP were obtained from the gas-phase reaction of MMH with NTO under laboratory conditions, the pulsed firings of RCS thrusters with modified PC tubes using varied oxidizer or fuel lead times, and the nominal RCS thruster firings at WSTF and Kaiser-Marquardt. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), accelerating rate calorimetry (ARC), ion chromatography (IC), inductively coupled plasma (ICP) spectrometry, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) coupled to FTIR (TGA/FTIR), and <b>mechanical</b> <b>impact</b> <b>testing</b> were used to qualitatively and quantitatively characterize the chemical, thermal, and ignition properties of FORP. These studies showed that the composition of FORP is variable but falls within a limited range of compositions that depends on the fuel loxidizer ratio at the time of formation, composition of the post-formation atmosphere (reducing or oxidizing), and reaction or postreaction temperature. A typical composition contains methylhydrazinium nitrate (MMHN), ammonium nitrate (AN), methylammonium nitrate (MAN), and trace amounts of hydrazinium nitrate and 1, 1 -dimethylhydrazinium nitrate. The thermal decomposition reactions of FORP compositions used in this study were unremarkable, Neither the various compositions of FORP, the pure major components of FORP, nor mixtures of FORP with propellant-system corrosion products showed any unusual thermal activity when decomposed under laboratory conditions. Off-limit thruster operations were simulated by rapid mixing of liquid MMH and liquid NTO in a confined space. The test hardware was constructed with pressure- and temperature-measurement devices to determine if the expected fuel oxidizer reaction would result in increased energy release when FORP, FORP constituents, or propellant-system corrosion products were present. These tests demonstrated that FORP, MMHN, AN, or Inconel corrosion products can induce a mixture of MMH and NTO to produce component-damaging energies. The simulation-test program was not extensive enough to provide statistical probabilities for these events but did show that such events can occur. Damaging events required FORP or metal salts to be present at the initial mixing of MMH and NTO. Based on the results of these studies, it is suggested that removal or mitigation of a buildup of these materials may decrease the incidence of these high-energy, potentially damaging events...|$|R

40|$|Today’s Aerospace {{vehicles}} utilise numerous pyrotechnic {{devices to}} separate structural subsystems, deploy appendages and activate on-board operational subsystems. The firing of these pyrotechnical charges generates severe impulsive loads (so-called pyroshocks) {{that can cause}} failures in electronic components. There {{is a lack of}} computational techniques to predict the dynamic behaviour of complex structures when subjected to high frequency shock waves as well as a lack of damage and failure criteria for electronic equipment and so the projects must rely on testing to validate the design. Alcatel ETCA has developed a pyroshock test facility dedicated to the testing of electronic units. The facility utilises a resonant test fixture assembly that is excited by a detonating charge or a <b>mechanical</b> <b>impact.</b> The <b>test</b> fixture assembly can be a simple plate, a beam, a double plate assembly or a more complex structure. The test item attached to the fixture is subjected to the direct shock wave and to the resonant response of the test fixture, which simulates the desired pyroshock. The test set up is checked and tuned versus the test specification by using a dummy of the test item. When the desired pyroshock is achieved, the nominal tests are performed on the test item. Part I of this presentation describes the main characteristics of the test facility: test fixtures, excitation techniques, data acquisition, and data processing. Part II presents some test results and details the effects of variables upon the induced shock response spectra. The main variables are related to the design of the test fixture (type, size, material) and the characteristics of the excitation (amount of explosive, location of explosive, and so on) ...|$|R
