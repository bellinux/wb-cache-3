500|$|Before {{the last}} game of the World Series had been played, rumors spread that Detroit (which had amassed an all-star lineup with a {{commensurate}} payroll) was in negotiations to unload Dunlap's high salary by selling him to Pittsburgh. Dunlap announced in November 1887 {{that he would not}} consent unless the Detroit club paid him half of the sum it was to receive from Pittsburgh to secure his release. He said at the time, [...] "I am sick and tired of being sold without gaining anything by it, and it is about time that <b>my</b> <b>bank</b> account was benefited by these transfers." [...] He told a reporter for The New York Times that he was not penniless and would refuse to play unless his demands were met. He told the reporter that the Detroit club had three choices -- [...] "give me half of the money secured for my release, allow me to go where I please, or fulfill the contract made with me last year." ...|$|E

2500|$|When I write two £100 cheques for a {{total of}} £200, the balance in <b>my</b> <b>bank</b> account is reduced by £200. Based on the law of accounting, a {{decrease}} in my cash asset is a credit. The total credit for my asset balance is greater than the total debit. Thus, in my records, my [...] "Bank" [...] ledger account has an asset credit balance, which is reduced by the credit for £200. [...] Amounts in my records for the two creditors are liabilities, which are reduced by the two debits totaling £200.|$|E
2500|$|I later learned, {{a copy of}} my {{personal}} credit report– with detailed information about <b>my</b> <b>bank</b> accounts, home mortgage, credit-card payments, home address and Social Security number– had been illegally retrieved from a national credit bureau called Trans Union. The sham company that received it, [...] "Educational Funding Services" [...] of Los Angeles, gave as its address a mail drop {{a few blocks from}} Scientology's headquarters. The owner of the mail drop is a private eye named Fred Wolfson, who admits that an Ingram associate retained him to retrieve credit reports on several individuals. Wolfson says he was told that Scientology's attorneys [...] "had judgments against these people and were trying to collect on them." [...] He says now, [...] "These are vicious people. These are vipers." [...] Ingram, through a lawyer, denies any involvement in the scam. … [...] After that, however, an attorney subpoenaed me, while another falsely suggested that I might own shares in a company I was reporting about that had been taken over by Scientologists (he also threatened to contact the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission). [...] A close friend in Los Angeles received a disturbing telephone call from a Scientology staff member seeking data about me– an indication that the cult may have illegally obtained {{my personal}} phone records. [...] Two detectives contacted me, posing as a friend and a relative of a so-called cult victim, to elicit negative statements from me about Scientology. Some of my conversations with them were taped, transcribed and presented by the church in affidavits to TIME's lawyers as [...] "proof" [...] of my bias against Scientology.|$|E
