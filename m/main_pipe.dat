25|$|From the {{inception}} of the design, priority was given to easy access to the powerplant, fuselage weapons and other systems while the aircraft was operating from forward airfields. To this end, the entire engine cowling was made up of large, easily removable panels which were secured by large toggle latches. A large panel under the wing centre section could be removed {{to gain access to the}} L-shaped main fuel tank, which was sited partly under the cockpit floor and partly behind the rear cockpit bulkhead. Other, smaller panels gave easy access to the cooling system and electrical equipment. The engine was held in two large, forged, Elektron magnesium alloy Y-shaped legs, one per side straddling the engine block, which were cantilevered from the firewall. Each of the legs was secured by two quick-release screw fittings on the firewall. All of the <b>main</b> <b>pipe</b> connections were colour-coded and grouped in one place, where possible, and electrical equipment plugged into junction boxes mounted on the firewall. The entire powerplant could be removed or replaced as a unit in a matter of minutes, a potential step to the eventual adoption of the unitized-powerplant Kraftei engine mounting concept used by many German combat aircraft designs, later in the war years.|$|E

50|$|A third {{method of}} {{thermoplastic}} welding is called sidewall fusion, or saddle fusion. Sidewall fusion is, like butt fusion and socket fusion, another process based on hot plate welding. Sidewall fusion differs from either socket, or butt fusion methods by performing fusion {{into the side}} of the pipe wall in a transverse orientation to the <b>main</b> <b>pipe,</b> rather than in line with the pipe. Sidewall fusion is typically employed in conjunction with either socket or butt fusion methods as a complementary process and many fusion machines designed for butt fusion are also equipped for sidewall fusion.

40|$|Abstract. We can {{calculate}} various pump lifts utilizing {{the method of}} solving the pressure balance loop equations in the distributed power system. For the system pumps are set at heat (cold) source and on each branch, {{if the number of}} independent loops is less than the pumps, the equations of the pump lift have multiple solutions. When considering the constraint conditions, if we determine the pump lift of the first branch, others can be determined. For the system pumps are set on the <b>main</b> <b>pipes,</b> if we install pumps at heat (cold) source and on each main water supply and backwater pipes, and the pumps of a corresponding pair of main water supply and backwater pipes are the same, when the number of independent loops is equal to the pump lifts, the equations can have solutions.
