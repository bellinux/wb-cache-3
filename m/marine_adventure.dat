60|$|The {{remuneration}} {{of capital}} in different employments, {{much more than}} the remuneration of labor, varies according to the circumstances which render one employment more attractive or more repulsive than another. The profits, for example, of retail trade, in proportion to the capital employed, exceed those of wholesale dealers or manufacturers, for this reason among others, that there is less consideration attached to the employment. The greatest, however, of these differences, is that caused by difference of risk. The profits of a gunpowder-manufacturer must be considerably greater than the average, {{to make up for the}} peculiar risks to which he and his property are constantly exposed. When, however, as in the case of <b>marine</b> <b>adventure,</b> the peculiar risks are capable of being, and commonly are, commuted for a fixed payment, the premium of insurance takes its regular place among the charges of production, and the compensation which the owner of the ship or cargo receives for that payment does not appear in the estimate of his profits, but is included in the replacement of his capital.|$|E

5000|$|The {{heavy rains}} of 1691 flooded {{the fields and}} {{threatened}} to flood the city; the wheat crop was devastated by a disease. Sigüenza used a precursor of the microscope {{to discover that the}} cause of this disease in wheat was the Chiahuiztli, an insect like the flea. As a result of this disaster, the following year there was a severe shortage of food which caused large-scale rioting. Mobs looted Spaniards' shops and caused numerous fires in government buildings. Sigüenza managed to salvage the city library from the fire, avoiding a great loss. Sigüenza estimated that about ten thousand people took part in the riot. As the royal cosmographer of New Spain he drew hydrologic maps of the Valley of Mexico. In 1693 he was sent by the viceroy as a companion of Andrés de Pez in an exploration trip {{to the north of the}} Gulf of Mexico and in particular the peninsula of Florida, where he drew maps of Pensacola Bay and the mouth of the Mississippi River. This experience may have inspired him to write about <b>marine</b> <b>adventure</b> in the [...] "Misfortunes of Alonso Ramirez".|$|E

40|$|Delay in <b>marine</b> <b>adventure</b> is an {{important}} and frequent phenomenon of maritime transport and it affects various parties and their interests under several types of marine insurance policies, including {{but not limited to}} hull and machinery, cargo, freight and loss of hire. Losses arising from delay are almost always excluded under the standard forms of these policies and under the Marine Insurance Act 1906 (MIA). This thesis traces back the common law origins of the exclusion, identifies the motivations behind the exclusion and submits that the risk of delay and some types of losses arising therefrom were not always excluded under the common law. By introducing distinctions among the types of delay, the work argues that the judgments in favour of the exclusion of delay losses shall be interpreted according to the type of delay and shall not be authority for all types of delay. The findings of the work accordingly clarify and considerably restrict the scope of the exclusion. The thesis also tackles the MIA provisions pertaining to the impact of delay on voyage policies. It argues that the relevant provisions are not clear and do not entirely reflect their common law background. On the ground that they have not been litigated since the enactment of the MIA, the research assesses whether they are obsolete and proposes that the provisions should be retained subject to reforms...|$|E
40|$|The Master is the Leader in the <b>Marine</b> <b>Adventure,</b> {{with the}} Flag State’s {{responsibility}} {{for the safety of}} life at sea and the protection of the marine environment. But they are also the Company’s Representative whose purpose is to make the voyage a commercial success. They have always been accountable for their risks; the difference now is that they are being criminalised for what previously had been activity that, at worst, merited nothing more than a civil claim in negligence. As a result, a maritime casualty that results in collision, death and personal injury has become the basis for establishing crime and punishment without having to rely on the burden of proving the criminal element in a maritime context – and the target of that blame is the seafarer, who has to do their job in conditions far removed from the landward contexts for which the criminal law was originally intended. In this paper, we shall discuss some of the essential features which define the phenomenon of criminalisation from the global perspective, so that we have a common understanding of what criminalisation means. Then we can apply {{it in the context of}} the seafarer’s accountability for the risks which accompany their professional judgement. Upon that foundation we must then build a clear understanding of where the seafarer stands in the prosecution of the criminal law. By comparing cases such as the Kota Nebula and Dongfang zhi Xing with the Pride of Bilbao and the Zim Mexico III, we can develop a strategy for a future maritime policy in criminal accountability that balances Justice for the seafarer with the demands which meet the cultural priorities of Chinese society – which, ultimately, must drive maritime policy. We are entering a new generation in which the jurisdiction of Chinese maritime criminal law must reach out to other peoples in the initiative of ‘One Belt, One Road’; in this paper we are opening a debate that will shape maritime policy for fairer accountability of the seafarer. ...|$|E
40|$|When a ship {{gets into}} difficulties, {{one of the}} main options of an owner or master is to seek to put into {{sheltered}} waters where the difficulties can be remedied or minimised before proceeding on the voyage. This place is referred to as a ‘Place of Refuge’. Since 1999, there have been three major incidents involving ships, laden with crude oil and other hazardous cargoes, requesting and being refused access to places of refuge. In two of these cases, involving the Erika and the Prestige, the ships subsequently sank and caused severe pollution damage. In the third, involving the Castor, a disaster was narrowly avoided. The primary aims of this thesis are to address the issues that arose from the three incidents, to analyse the two proposals to deal with these issues, namely, voluntary Guidelines issued by the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) and the proposal by the Comite Maritime International (CMI) for a discrete convention on places of refuge and assess their adequacy to deal with future incidents. In doing so, the thesis assesses {{the manner in which the}} problem of places of refuge is treated, first, under international law; second, on the international level, by international bodies such as IMO, CMI and shipping industry bodies; third, at the national level, by Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom; and fourth, at the regional level, by the European Union and regional arrangements for the North Sea and the Baltic Sea. Any proposal for reform in the area of places of refuge must inevitably encounter and attempt to balance two firmly entrenched and largely incompatible positions. Shipping interests involved in the success of the <b>marine</b> <b>adventure</b> have a strong interest in preserving the vessel through timely intervention in a place of refuge. Coastal States have an equally strong interest in preserving their national waters and territory from pollution damage and their populations from danger from hazardous cargoes. To date, the task of trying to balance these varying interests, either through existing laws and institutions or through the solutions proposed by the IMO and CMI, has proved to be difficult. Additionally, there are a number of factors which could influence the way in which coastal States respond to requests for access. These include the age and condition of the world fleet; the failure of flag State control, port State control and classification societies to detect substandard shipping; and the failure of current international conventions to cover all aspects of possible damage to places of refuge. The conclusion of the thesis is that there is, currently, no complete answer to the problem of places of refuge since the necessary balance of interests is absent in the current proposed solutions. This balance must be found and factors influencing the decision of coastal States to grant access must be addressed. The problem of places of refuge is likely to persist until this occurs...|$|E

60|$|The {{first of}} the Passion {{pictures}} illustrated Revenge. A corpse, in fancy costume, lay {{on the bank of}} a foaming river, under the shade of a giant tree. An infuriated man, also in fancy costume, stood astride over the dead body, with his sword lifted to the lowering sky, and watched, with a horrid expression of delight, the blood of the man whom he had just killed dripping slowly in a procession of big red drops down the broad blade of his weapon. The next picture illustrated Cruelty, in many compartments. In one I saw a disemboweled horse savagely spurred on by his rider at a bull-fight. In another, an aged philosopher was dissecting a living cat, and gloating over his work. In a third, two pagans politely congratulated each other on the torture of two saints: one saint was roasting on a grid-iron; the other, hung up to a tree by his heels, had been just skinned, and was not quite dead yet. Feeling no great desire, after these specimens, to look at any more of the illustrated Passions, I turned to the opposite wall to be instructed in the career of the Wandering Jew. Here a second inscription informed me that the painter considered the Flying Dutchman to be no other than the Wandering Jew, pursuing his interminable Journey by sea. The <b>marine</b> <b>adventures</b> of this mysterious personage were the adventures chosen for representation by Dexter's brush. The first picture showed me a harbor on a rocky coast. A vessel was at anchor, with the helmsman singing on the deck. The sea in the offing was black and rolling; thunder-clouds lay low on the horizon, split by broad flashes of lightning. In the glare of the lightning, heaving and pitching, appeared the misty form of the Phantom Ship approaching the shore. In this work, badly as it was painted, there were really signs of a powerful imagination, and even of a poetical feeling for the supernatural. The next picture showed the Phantom Ship, moored (to the horror and astonishment of the helmsman) behind the earthly vessel in the harbor. The Jew had stepped on shore. His boat was on the beach. His crew--little men with stony, white faces, dressed in funeral black--sat in silent rows on the seats of the boat, with their oars in their lean, long hands. The Jew, also a black, stood with his eyes and hands raised imploringly to the thunderous heaven. The wild creatures of land and sea--the tiger, the rhinoceros, the crocodile, the sea-serpent, the shark, and the devil-fish--surrounded the accursed Wanderer in a mystic circle, daunted and fascinated at the sight of him. The lightning was gone. The sky and sea had darkened to a great black blank. A faint and lurid light lighted the scene, falling downward from a torch, brandished by an avenging Spirit that hovered over the Jew on outspread vulture wings. Wild as the picture might be in its conception, there was a suggestive power in it which I confess strongly impressed me. The mysterious silence in the house, and my strange position at the moment, no doubt had their effect on my mind. While I was still looking at the ghastly composition before me, the shrill trilling sound of the whistle upstairs burst on the stillness. For the moment my nerves were so completely upset that I started with a cry of alarm. I felt a momentary impulse to open the door and run out. The idea of trusting myself alone with the man who had painted those frightful pictures actually terrified me; I was obliged to sit down on one of the hall chairs. Some minutes passed before my mind recovered its balance, and I began to feel like my own ordinary self again. The whistle sounded impatiently for the second time. I rose and ascended the broad flight of stairs which led to the first story. To draw back at the point which I had now reached would have utterly degraded me in my own estimation. Still, my heart did certainly beat faster than usual as I approached the door of the circular anteroom; and I honestly acknowledge that I saw my own imprudence, just then, in a singularly vivid light.|$|R
