40|$|The {{topic of}} this paper is the notion of {{technical}} (as opposed to biological) <b>malfunction.</b> It is shown how to form the property being a <b>malfunctioning</b> F from the property F and the property modifier <b>malfunctioning</b> (a mapping taking a property to a property). We present two interpretations of <b>malfunctioning.</b> Both interpretations agree that a <b>malfunctioning</b> F lacks the dispositional property of functioning as an F. However, its subsective interpretation entails that <b>malfunctioning</b> Fs are Fs, whereas its privative interpretation entails that <b>malfunctioning</b> Fs are not Fs. We chart various of their respective logical consequences and discuss some of the philosophical implications of both interpretations...|$|R
40|$|Aim of {{the paper}} is to present a new logic of {{technical}} <b>malfunction.</b> The need for this logic is motivated by a simple-sounding philosophical question: Is a <b>malfunctioning</b> corkscrew, which fails to uncork bottles, nonetheless a corkscrew? Or in general terms, is a <b>malfunctioning</b> F, which fails to do what Fs do, nonetheless an F? We argue that ‘malfunctioning’ denotes the modifier <b>Malfunctioning</b> rather than a property, and that the answer depends on whether <b>Malfunctioning</b> is subsective or privative. If subsective, a <b>malfunctioning</b> F is an F; if privative, a <b>malfunctioning</b> F is not an F. An intensional logic is required to raise and answer the question, because modifiers operate directly on properties and not on sets or individuals. This new logic provides the formal tools to reason about technical <b>malfunction</b> {{by means of a}} logical analysis of the sentence “a is a <b>malfunctioning</b> F”.

5|$|Since June 2009, {{when two}} Red Line trains {{collided}} and killed nine people {{due in part}} to <b>malfunctions</b> in the ATC system, all Metro trains have been manually operated.

Metro originally planned to have all trains be automated again by 2017, but those plans were shelved in early 2017 in order to focus on more pressing safety and infrastructure issues.|$|E

40|$|Mitochondrial <b>malfunction</b> {{appears to}} be intimately {{associated}} with age and age-related complex disorders but the precise pathological relevance of such <b>malfunction</b> remains unclear. Mitochondrial, and more specifically bioenergetic, <b>malfunction</b> is commonly encountered in cancer, degenerative disorders and aging. The identification of a mitochondrial–nuclear retrograde signaling pathway in yeast has facilitated {{the study of the}} corresponding retrograde signaling mechanisms induced in response to mitochondrial <b>malfunction</b> in mammals including human. Mitochondrial–nuclear crosstalk is critical for the maintenance of cellular homeostasis, and some mitochondrial DNA mutations may perturb crosstalk signaling. However, ascertaining whether mitochondrial <b>malfunction</b> is a cause or a consequence of disease development will be key to determining whether or not impaired crosstalk signaling is of direct pathological and hence therapeutic relevance. Here, we review what is known about the nuclear adaptive compensatory mechanisms induced in response to mitochondrial <b>malfunction.</b> We discuss the role of mitochondrial DNA variants in modulating the penetrance of human inherited disease caused by mutations in the nuclear genome and explore the underlying mechanisms by which they influence the retrograde response. We conclude that mitochondrial DNA variants have the potential to induce molecular signals through the mitochondrial–nuclear crosstalk mechanism, thereby promoting nuclear compensation in response to mitochondrial <b>malfunction.</b> The implications for the development of genetic or pharmaceutical interventions for the treatment of mitochondrial <b>malfunction</b> in complex disease are also explored...|$|R

5|$|Although the MP 40 was {{generally}} reliable, a major weakness was its 32-round magazine. Unlike the double-column, dual-feed magazine insert {{found on the}} Thompson M1921-28 variants, the MP 40 used a double-column, single-feed insert. The single-feed insert resulted in increased friction against the remaining cartridges moving upwards towards the feed lips, occasionally resulting in feed failures; this problem was exacerbated {{by the presence of}} dirt or other debris. Another problem was that the magazine was also sometimes misused as a handhold. This could cause the weapon to malfunction when hand pressure on the magazine body caused the magazine lips {{to move out of the}} line of feed, since the magazine well did not keep the magazine firmly locked. German soldiers were trained to grasp either the handhold on the underside of the weapon or the magazine housing with the supporting hand to avoid feed <b>malfunctions.</b>|$|E
