25|$|Coherent {{microwave}} amplifiers operating above 1,000 watts microwave output, like {{travelling wave}} tubes and klystrons, require liquid coolant. The electron beam must contain 5 to 10 times {{more power than}} the microwave output, which can produce enough heat to generate plasma. This plasma flows from the collector toward the cathode. The same <b>magnetic</b> <b>focusing</b> that guides the electron beam forces the plasma {{into the path of}} the electron beam but flowing in the opposite direction. This introduces FM modulation which degrades Doppler performance. To prevent this, liquid coolant with minimum pressure and flow rate is required, and deionized water is normally used in most high power surface radar systems that utilize Doppler processing.|$|E

40|$|The Plastiras Lake is an {{artificial}} reservoir, constructed for hydroelectric use and noticed for its beautiful scenery. The landscape {{is dominated by}} the presence of water, which constitutes a pleasant aesthetic target that attracts the observer and can therefore be determined as a <b>magnetic</b> <b>focus</b> point. The lake is a typical surrounded landscape, with high mountains at a small distance from the water, {{as a result of the}} steep riparian contours. This is a common characteristic of mountain artificial lakes, where the scenery is usually considered to be superior to that of natural lakes. The landscape morphology also affects the observation of the <b>magnetic</b> <b>focus</b> point, which differs in the northern and the southern side of the Plastiras Lake. In the north, the slopes are smooth and the <b>magnetic</b> <b>focus</b> is weak, whereas in the south the landscape elements are clearly distinguishable and apprehensible. For the same reasons the axes composing the landscape in the southern part are more intense than in the northern part. As a matter of fact, on each side of the lake, the landscape relief plays a different role in assisting the revelation of the <b>magnetic</b> <b>focus</b> point to the observer. The observation gravity circles are a tool that can be used in order to obtain a qualitative assessment of the intensity of revelation of the <b>magnetic</b> <b>focus</b> point. The circle size is relative to the distance from the subject and is also greatly affected by the relief. It must be taken into account however, that aesthetic elements such as the revelation of the <b>magnetic</b> <b>focus</b> can not be quantified...|$|R

A dc <b>magnetic</b> field <b>focuses</b> electrons in the beam already inside the cavity as they leave the photocathode.

50|$|For proper {{functioning}} of the electron gun, {{it is necessary that}} the beam be perfectly adjusted with respect to the optical axes of the accelerating electrical lens and the <b>magnetic</b> <b>focusing</b> lens.

50|$|In {{order to}} achieve high {{collection}} efficiency splashing of the droplet on the collector surface has to be minimized. It was determined that droplet collector with an incidence angle of 35 degrees can prevent a uniform droplet stream with droplet diameter 250 µm and a velocity of 16 m/s from splashing under microgravity condition.Another solution {{is to have a}} liquid film formed on the inner surface of the collector. When the droplet streams are absorbed in this liquid film, no splashes should be formed. A miscapture rate of incoming droplets was required to be less than 10−6. The droplet diameter was determined to be less than 300 µm and the droplet speed less than 20 m/s.If a ferrofluid is used a <b>magnetic</b> <b>focusing</b> means can effectively suppress splashing.|$|E
50|$|The {{magnetic}}ally focused LDR {{employs a}} magnetic field to focus streams of droplets directed from the generator toward the collector, thereby assuring that essentially all of the droplets captured, {{even though some of}} the streams may be misdirected as they leave the generator. The <b>magnetic</b> <b>focusing</b> means is also effective to suppress splashing of liquid when the droplets impinge on the collector. The magnetically focused LDR was investigated and patented by the Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) under a grant by the Department of Energy (Contract DE-AC02-76CH00016). The magnetic means can be achieved with a toroidal shaped electro-magnet or permanent magnets. As only one side of the droplet sheet would be focused by a single permanent magnet, an even number has to be placed across each other adjacent to the collector. A permanent dipole magnet has limited field strength, hence limits radiator size. Electromagnets or (cryogenic cooled) superconducting magnets offer higher field strengths, but may have mass tradeoff. A major conclusion drawn from calculations is that a spacecraft can be maneuvered at accelerations less than 10−3 g. Higher accelerations require numerous smaller LDRs which will be more massive in the sum, but would to be more likely to survive.|$|E

40|$|A fully {{three-dimensional}} (3 D) {{model of}} an electron beam focused by a periodic permanent magnet (PPM) stack has been developed. First, the simulation code MAFIA {{was used to}} model a PPM stack using the magnetostatic solver. The exact geometry of the <b>magnetic</b> <b>focusing</b> structure was modeled; thus, no approximations were made regarding the off-axis fields. The fields from the static solver were loaded into the 3 D particle-in-cell (PIC) solver of MAFIA where fully 3 D behavior of the beam was simulated in the <b>magnetic</b> <b>focusing</b> field. The PIC solver computes the time-integration of electromagnetic fields simultaneously with the time integration of the equations of motion of charged particles that move {{under the influence of}} those fields. Fields caused by those moving charges are also taken into account; thus, effects like space charge and magnetic forces between particles are fully simulated. The electron beam is simulated by a number of macro-particles. These macro-particles represent a given charge Q amounting to that of several million electrons in order to conserve computational time and memory. Particle motion is unrestricted, so particle trajectories can cross paths and move in three dimensions under the influence of 3 D electric and magnetic fields. Correspondingly, there is no limit on the initial current density distribution of the electron beam, nor its density distribution {{at any time during the}} simulation. Simulation results including beam current density, percent ripple and percent transmission will be presented, and the effects current, <b>magnetic</b> <b>focusing</b> strength and thermal velocities have on beam behavior will be demonstrated using 3 D movies showing the evolution of beam characteristics in time and space.
