The burbot lineage separated 10 Myr BP from the other Lotinae, while the genetic variation within burbot appeared to be approximately I Myr old.

While Nearctic burbot survived climatic oscillations and diverged in several refugia, the Eurasian form became extinct or was reduced to a very small population.

The deep water stations of the Rockall Trough and the north and west stations off the Rockall and Hatton Banks were characterized by a low number of species and high numbers of individuals of mesopelagic species such as Maurolicus muelleri and Benthosema glaciale. Results from multivariate statistical analysis confirmed that species compositions varied significantly at different sites and were related to environmental conditions, whereby sites of similar temperature, salinity and bottom depth harboured similar species assemblages. Generalized additive mixed modelling was used to model the relationship between species richness and environmental variables and confirmed that there was a significant negative relationship between species richness and bottom depth indicating that the offshore banks and the slope stations present favourable habitats for a large number of species. peer-reviewe...|$|R
40|$|The {{longline}} fisheries for ling (<b>Molva</b> <b>molva)</b> <b>and</b> tusk (Brosme brosme) {{have long}} traditions in Norway. Blue ling (Molva dipterygia) {{was always a}} by-catch in Norwegian slope waters but about 15 years ago this species became {{the target of a}} deep-water gill-net fishery. In recent years 5 - 10 % of the firsthand value of Norwegian landings was attributed to these species. This report provides an overview of the fisheries and population biology of the three species, with emphasis on aspects of relevance to future stock assessments, based on results from Norwegian investigations in 1993 - 95 and literature reviews. The Norwegian fleets which target ling, tusk and blue ling are the high-seas autoline vessels which operate in waters to the west and north of the British Isles, in the North Sea and at the Faroes and Iceland, and longline and gill-net vessels of various sizes fishing in home waters along the Norwegian slope. Exploitation occurs {{in all parts of the}} distribution area of the species. It is still unclear whether separate stocks occur in different sub-areas. Spawning areas are wide-spread, also the distribution of eggs and larvae. Very little is known about migrations. The age and size structure of the catches in various fishing areas show only minor variation. New studies by electrophoresis of tissue enzymes and hemoglobins indicate that tusk from all areas sampled in the northeastern Atlantic belong to the same gene pool, where the results for ling and blue ling are inconclusive. Estimates of mortality show that exploitation rates are high, and catch per unit of effort (CPUE) analyses of ling and tusk based on both private and official logbooks from the longliners indicate a considerable decline in the population sizes since the 1970 s. The catch per unit of effort may have declined by about 70 %. Strategies and requirements for future monitoring by improved CPUE measures and age-based assessement models are discussed.

In 1992, Iceland, the Faroes and Norway initiated a three-year project which should provide improved knowledge of the biology of the three species (Bergstad and Hareide 1996; Magnusson et al. 1997). In that project it was focused specifically on age determination methods which could form a basis for future stock assessments and further studies of biology. For all the three species {{there was a need}} for reconsidering the ageing methods applied in earlier studies, and on that basis, perform further technical development and inter-calibration of age readings.

The manual illustrates the agreed practices which should provide reasonably precise age estimates. Data from several inter-calibration exercises carried out during the nordic project were presented by Bergstad et al. (1997). The only structure useful for determining the age of ling and tusk are the sagittal otoliths, and the otoliths are extracted by the same procedures as used for other gadoids (e. g.

40|$|The {{biological}} {{effects of}} an offshore oil platform on local fish populations were assessed {{as part of the}} Water Column Monitoring (WCM) programme for 2014. The Njord A platform was chosen as the study location, which was not in operation and had no current discharge of produced water. Demersal fish species were targeted since they were believed to be less likely to migrate away from the platform than pelagic fish. By targeting organisms deeper in the water column and selecting a platform currently not in operation, the impact of drill cuttings and other sediment sources including leakages from well deposits were the main sources of contamination. Wild fish including ling (<b>Molva</b> <b>molva),</b> tusk (Brosme brosme), redfish (Sebastes sp.) and saithe (Pollachius virens) were caught with baited rod and line from within the 500 m safety zone of the Njord A platform during the summer of 2014. Reference fish were caught on a separate research cruise by trawling from a region of the Norwegian Sea less impacted by oil and gas activities. Limited numbers of reference ling were obtained and the reference data for ling collected from the North Sea as part of the WCM 2013 programme were used for comparison of the biomarker responses. Contaminant body burden and a suite of biological effects endpoints were measured in all fish groups and included DNA adducts, DNA strand breaks by comet assay, acetylcholine esterase (AChE) inhibition, ethoxyresorufin 0 -deethylase (EROD), vitellogenin (VTG), lysosomal membrane stability (LMS), liver and gill histopathology, PAH metabolites, and PAH body burden. The biomarker data were integrated using the integrated biological response index (IBR/n). Despite low and/or undetected concentrations of PAH and PAH metabolites in fish fillet and bile respectively significant responses in AChE, comet and DNA adducts were found. The biomarker responses indicated exposure to both neurotoxic and genotoxic chemicals in fish inhabiting the lower water column with influence from sediment sources around the Njord A platform. Integration of the biomarker responses (IBR/n) found that all four fish species that were caught from around the platform had markedly higher IBR/n values than their respective reference population.

The mobile agent technology has notable advantages over the traditional client/server technology. However, its advantages make it more vulnerable to threats. We use ISO 17799, an international standard for Information security management, as our guide to approach the security problems in this e-hospital. We reach the security objectives for this e-hospital by risk assessments of the current system, compliance with the patients' privacy protection regulations and the consideration of end users' requirements.

40|$|Software agents, as {{the main}} body of agent-oriented E-commerce systems, have a great {{potential}} for E-commerce applications. Agents can dynamically discover and compose E-services and mediate interactions, which can serve as delegates in order to handle routine tasks, monitor activities, set up contracts, execute business processes, and find the best services [Gri 01, GK 94, Nwa 96]. However, agents are vulnerable to several attacks from the running environment, such as, insecure network, malicious users and malicious hosts, etc. Therefore, the success or failureof this paradigm is connected to the issues whether the mechanisms in agents can protect their security and privacy. Policy-based cryptography, which consists of two cryptographic primitives: policy-based encryption and policy-based signature,was firstly proposed by Bagga <b>and</b> <b>Molva</b> [BM 06, BM 05]. It has the advantage of addressing the security problems of software agents. We are motivated by the concept of policy-based cryptography [BM 06, BM 05] and use cryptographic primitives mentioned above to provide security and privacy for agents systems. There are several kinds of software agents, such as mobile agents, multi-agents,intelligent agents and distributed agents. In this thesis, we focus on mobile agents and multi-agents. Mobile agents have the ability of migrating across different execution environments. Due to this property, the security and privacy of mobile agents can be easily compromised when they are traveling on a hostile environment. Therefore, security and privacy are critical to mobile agents applied in E-commerce. There exist several solutions for mobile agent security [ST 98 b, KBC 00, LKK 01, ZMZ 09], among which the proxy-based model is believed to be a sound solution to provide authentication, where the visiting host of an agent acts as a proxy signer who can sign an offer. However, any host (including a malicious host) could act as the signer to forge valid signatures. To solve this problem, a secure policy-based mobile agent scheme is introduced in this thesis, that is, only the hosts who satisfy the designated policies can generate a valid signature. A security model and a rigorous security proof related to scheme are provided as well. Multi-agent systems are different from mobile agents systems {{in the way that they}} do not have the property of mobility. In most of current multi-agent systems, the identity authentication and privacy issues have not drawn adequate attentions. Without the protection mechanism, the secure information exchange channel cannot be provided in multi-agent systems. Policy-based schemes can solve the problem of multi-agents identity authentication and privacy protection. Bagga and Molva[BM 06] firstly proposed a concrete policy-based encryption (PBE) scheme. PBE allows entitiesd to encrypt a message with respect to a credential-based policy so that only the entities who are compliant with policy can successfully decrypt the ciphertext. However, the size of ciphertext in [BM 06] will increase linearly if the policy set is growing larger. This is a significant issue in a resource limited communication channel. In this thesis, we propose a new policy-based encryption scheme with much smaller ciphertext size and less computational cost. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time PBE is applied to the multi-agent system, which allows policy-based authenticated communications and provides privacy protection to agents. We define a rigorous security model for multi-agent transaction, which captures the most powerful attacks including adaptive chosen message attacks. The security of our scheme is based on the hardness of ((p, g, F) -GDDHE) problem inthe random oracle model...|$|R
