50|$|Arriflex 416 is {{a motion}} picture camera product line created by Arri in 2006. This camera line was {{introduced}} {{in large part to}} accommodate new lenses of larger diameter which physically interfered with the Arri 16 SR 3 viewfinder. The 416 camera series is designed for 16mm filmmaking in the Super 16 format. The 416 series has some features that are derived from Arri's 35mm cameras. The 416 series is compatible with some 35mm camera accessories, such as PL-mount lenses, base plates, <b>matte</b> <b>boxes,</b> follow focus units, etc.|$|R
5000|$|Letts' first {{involvement}} with Doctor Who was in 1967 when he directed the Patrick Troughton serial The Enemy of the World. This was a complex serial to direct as Troughton played both the Doctor and the Mexican dictator [...] "Salamander" [...] {{in the same}} story and sometimes in the same scenes - a rare and demanding directorial requirement for the 1960s. However, in his memoir Who and Me, Letts related how he naively used <b>matte</b> <b>boxes</b> to allow Troughton to act {{face to face with}} himself, when in fact optical printing was already available and the same could have been accomplished in post-production.|$|R
50|$|A <b>matte</b> <b>box</b> {{may have}} a bellows, a rigid {{sunshade}} or both, where the bellows is positioned within the rigid sunshade, having a mask which may be adjusted forward or back to suit the angle {{of view of the}} camera system.|$|E
50|$|A smaller variant with an {{articulated}} arm, colloquially {{known as}} a French flag, is occasionally attached to the movie camera {{at the discretion of}} the focus puller solely for the purpose of blocking light flares which the <b>matte</b> <b>box</b> and its accessories cannot reach.|$|E
50|$|Panavision and Sony {{created a}} new viewfinder, which is entirely {{redesigned}} from the old film camera setup, to allow easier controls while filming. The changes were made {{in order to produce}} a film friendly system that utilizes many standard camera accessories, such as the follow focus, <b>matte</b> <b>box,</b> heads, etc.|$|E
50|$|During production, 1st ACs {{are also}} {{responsible}} for the maintenance and upkeep of all camera equipment and accessories, including; lenses, filters, batteries, film magazines/recording media, <b>matte</b> <b>boxes,</b> etc., as well as configuring the camera and its accessories in multiple ways for different setups. 1st ACs arrive on set before the director, director of photography (DoP) and camera operator, and ensures the camera and all required lenses are prepared for the day's shoot. During filming, the 1st AC is responsible for moving the camera to each setup as directed by the Director of Photography. On larger budget productions, the camera is usually mounted on a dolly {{for most of the}} day, which is operated by the Dolly Grip. At the end of each shooting day, 1st ACs clean the equipment and pack it up in preparation for the next day. If {{there is a problem with}} the rushes (such as a scratch on the film), the focus puller communicates with the film lab to fix any faults with the camera or film stock.|$|R
5000|$|Rare Cult is {{a limited}} edition, six-CD box set from British rock band The Cult {{released}} in November 2000. The chronologically-organized set contains 90 tracks (48 previously unreleased) of studio b-sides, radio sessions, 12" [...] mixes, alternate mixes, demos and the complete 'Peace' album (aka the [...] "Manor Sessions"). The set is packaged in a <b>matte</b> black <b>box</b> with gold lettering, containing three 2-disc gatefold digipaks and an extensive 80-page booklet of liner notes and photos. Only 15,000 copies were produced, with the first 5,000 copies including a bonus seventh disc of remixes. The Rare Cult box set is complemented by the single-disc compilation The Best of Rare Cult and the 2002 5-CD release Rare Cult: The Demo Sessions.|$|R
5000|$|A Season in Hell Part One is a bootleg CD box set {{manufactured}} in Italy and released by Banzai in 1994. The collection {{is housed in}} a <b>matte</b> finish, square <b>box</b> that also includes a 7"x7" [...] booklet with 24 pages of photographs and information on the recordings featured in the set. Spanning the three disc, 66-track collection are two shows from 1990, several demos, some rare live material, various b-sides and compilation tracks. This {{is one of only}} two bootleg CD releases to feature the Off Ramp Café performance, and the only to feature the Town Pump show. A portion of the box set would later be officially released on With the Lights Out. In 1996, the inferior A Season In Hell Part Two was released by Razor's Edge, containing the 1994 Le Zénith show and an array of miscellaneous material, most of which was lifted from the Outcesticide series and official releases.|$|R
5000|$|Field is {{currently}} marketing his professional 35mm film camera invention for cinema and television. The camera considerably improves image quality by using unperforated 35mm film (which allows much wider exposed images), (...) [...] The camera {{could be used}} with Field's camera light screening unit (<b>matte</b> <b>box)</b> which been manufactured for many years by the Chrosziel Filmtechnik company in Germany. (...) [...]|$|E
50|$|Another {{purpose of}} a <b>matte</b> <b>box</b> is to hold glass or plastic filters in place {{in front of the}} lens. Today, matte boxes are made for DV cameras and HD cameras for the same reasons as for film cameras. Some are {{supported}} by two rods that run the length of the camera, while others are supported by the lens itself.|$|E
50|$|In still {{photography}} and video, a <b>matte</b> <b>box</b> is a device {{used on the}} end of a lens to block the sun or other light source in order to prevent glare and lens flare. It performs essentially the same function as a lens hood and also mounts in front of the lens, but usually includes adjustable fins called French flags.|$|E
50|$|Keaton's {{portrayal}} of nine {{members of a}} minstrel show required {{the use of a}} special <b>matte</b> <b>box</b> {{in front of the camera}} lens. It had nine exactingly-machined strips of metal which could be moved up and down independently of each other. Elgin Lessley, Keaton's cameraman, shot the far-left Keaton with the first shutter up, and the others down. He then rewound the film, opened the second segment, and re-filmed the next Keaton in sequence. This procedure was repeated seven more times. The camera was hand-wound, so Lessley's hand had to be absolutely steady to avoid any variation in speed. Keaton relied on a metronome to guide him, not a problem in a silent film. It was decades before Keaton, who masterminded this, revealed his technique to other filmmakers.|$|E
50|$|Much {{like the}} First Doctor serial The Massacre of St Bartholomew's Eve, this serial was {{influenced}} by the lead actor's desire to play roles other than the Doctor. Initially, it was planned that Troughton's two characters would meet more than once, but due to the technical complexity, there was eventually only the one confrontation scene, at the story's climax (utilising editing and a split-screen technique). Barry Letts planned six split-screen shots. He called for a <b>matte</b> <b>box</b> to mask half of the camera lens, having read about the technique used for old Hollywood films. The film was rewound after the first take and Troughton was then filmed in his other costume. However, after the first such shot, the camera jammed, and no more split-screen takes were filmed. Later, Letts mentioned this to Derek Martinus, director of the preceding story, who brought Letts up to date with the contemporary technology of filming normally then using an optical printer to combine the material.|$|E
5000|$|Mitchell Standard {{35mm camera}} - The {{original}} Mitchell rackover pin-registered studio camera, introduced in 1920 as a hand-cranked silent film camera. (The rackover device allowed the camera portion with its side-mounted viewfinder to be [...] "racked over" [...] upon its base, either {{left or right}} of the taking lens by turning {{a handle on the}} rear of the camera base. By racking to the right, the operator would focus the lens upon a ground glass element seen through the viewfinder. By racking back to the left, the camera with its film would be brought into position to record the view of the now focused lens). This standard model came with a 4-lens turret, a <b>matte</b> <b>box</b> on rails mounted {{to the front of the}} camera, and options included a veeder film footage counter, behind the lens iris, 4-way adjustable frame mattes, automatic or hand dissolve, internal matte disk with 9 pre-cut mattes including 1/2 frame, circles, keyhole, binocular, and oval. Various improvements and available options on this model took place over subsequent years, including a frames-per-second film speed meter, addition of a side-view parallax finder with upright view, various electric motors including variable speed, constant speed, and synchronized motors. The talking pictures introduced in 1926 soon required this somewhat noisy camera to run quieter with the so-called [...] "silent" [...] film movements, and soon thereafter a higher-speed [...] "silent" [...] movement and follow-focus devices were made available.|$|E
