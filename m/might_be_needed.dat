5|$|Agnew's pride {{had been}} stung by the {{negative}} {{news coverage of}} him during the campaign, and he sought to bolster his reputation by assiduous performance of his duties. It had become usual {{for the vice president}} to preside over the Senate only if he <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>needed</b> to break a tie, but Agnew opened every session for the first two months of his term, and spent more time presiding, in his first year, than any vice president since Alben Barkley, who held that role under Harry S. Truman. The first postwar vice president not to have been a senator, he took lessons in Senate procedures from the parliamentarian and from a Republican committee staffer. He lunched with small groups of senators, and was initially successful in building good relations. Although silenced on foreign policy matters, he attended White House staff meetings and spoke on urban affairs; when Nixon was present, he often presented the perspective of the governors. Agnew earned praise from the other members when he presided over a meeting of the White House Domestic Council in Nixon's absence but, like Nixon during Eisenhower's illnesses, did not sit in the president's chair. Nevertheless, many of the commission assignments Nixon gave Agnew were sinecures, with the vice president only formally the head.|$|E
5|$|Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) asks Dunder Mifflin CEO David Wallace (Andy Buckley) if he {{can work}} {{part-time}} so he can go to Philadelphia to help with his sports marketing job. David Wallace says that he <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>needed</b> in the office {{if there is a}} crisis with one of his clients, to which he responds that Stanley Hudson (Leslie David Baker) and Phyllis Vance (Phyllis Smith) have agreed to cover for him, though he in fact has not asked them yet. Stanley and Phyllis respond with their usual disinterest in helping others, so Jim offers to treat them to lunch. Stanley and Phyllis order extra side dishes and help themselves to an excess of wine, annoying Jim with drunken behavior and silencing him whenever he brings up the subject of their covering for him. When they arrive back at the office, a drunk Stanley and Phyllis are seemingly passed out in the backseat of Jim's car. When Jim puts his coat on them to keep them warm, Phyllis and Stanley say they will cover for him as they care for Jim and his family, laughing as they reveal they were only pranking him. Jim gives both of them a hug.|$|E

25|$|A wheellock firearm had the {{advantage}} {{that it can be}} instantly readied and fired even with one hand, in contrast to the then-common matchlock firearms, which must have a burning cord of slow match ready if the gun <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>needed</b> and demanded the operator's full attention and two hands to operate. On the other hand, wheellock mechanisms were complex to make, making them relatively costly.|$|E

Therefore, they must constitute holistic offerings, providing suitable and sustainable {{solutions to the}} consumer at all stages of the lifecycle (including extraction of raw materials that <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>need</b> to make the service possible in the first place, transportation, manufacturing, distribution, use and post-use). This closed-loop approach contains the principle of reusing and recycling products in order to manufacture new products while skipping a new extraction of (limited) raw materials {{and the need for}} transportation.|$|R
40|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{investigated}} the reasons behind refactoring operations performed by developers, and proposed methods and tools to recommend refactorings based on quality metric profiles, or {{on the presence of}} poor design and implementation choices, i. e., code smells. Nevertheless, the existing literature lacks observations about the relations between metrics/code smells and refactoring activities performed by developers. In other words, the characteristics of code components increasing/decreasing their chances of being object of refactoring operations are still unknown. This paper aims at bridging this gap. Specifically, we mined the evolution history of three Java open source projects to investigate whether refactoring activities occur on code components for which certain indicators—such as quality metrics or the presence of smells as detected by tools—suggest there <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>need</b> for refactoring operations. Results indicate that, more often than not, quality metrics do not show a clear relationship with refactoring. In other words, refactoring operations are generally focused on code components for which quality metrics do not suggest there <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>need</b> for refactoring operations. Finally, 42 % of refactoring operations are performed on code entities affected by code smells. However, only 7 % of the performed operations actually remove the code smells from the affected class...|$|R
25|$|The {{accuracy}} of an analog computer {{is limited by}} its computing elements as well as quality of the internal power and electrical interconnections. The precision of the analog computer readout was limited chiefly by the precision of the readout equipment used, generally three or four significant figures. The precision of a digital computer {{is limited by the}} word size; arbitrary-precision arithmetic, while relatively slow, provides any practical degree of precision that <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>needed.</b>|$|E
25|$|In addition, general {{relativity}} {{is inconsistent with}} quantum mechanics, the physical theory that describes the wave–particle duality of matter, and quantum mechanics does not currently describe gravitational attraction at relevant (microscopic) scales. There {{is a great deal}} of speculation in the physics community as to the modifications that <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>needed</b> to both {{general relativity}} and quantum mechanics in order to unite them consistently. The speculative theory that unites general relativity and quantum mechanics is usually called quantum gravity, prominent examples of which include String Theory and Loop Quantum Gravity.|$|E
25|$|Use of the {{empirical}} CFE equation (42), and {{the measurement of}} κ, may be of particular use for non-metals. Strictly, Fowler-Nordheim-type equations apply only to emission from the conduction band of bulk crystalline solids. However, empirical equations of form (42) should apply to all materials (though, conceivably, modification <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>needed</b> for very sharp emitters). It seems very likely that {{one way in which}} CFE equations for newer materials may differ from Fowler-Nordheim-type equations is that these CFE equations may have a different power of F (or V) in their pre-exponentials. Measurements of κ might provide some experimental indication of this.|$|E

30|$|Data {{buffering}} in CRN: The {{possibility of}} delay in data transmission has seldom been factored into the RA problems of CRN. Almost all works reviewed have equally neglected this concept in their problem definition. In reality, for heterogeneous CRN particularly, delay tolerance of different users might differ significantly, and there <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>need</b> for queue considerations. To analyse RA models that capture such possibilities, {{the use of}} queueing theory could help in addressing the delay issues. Hence, RA problems in CRN that factor this into their designs, especially when heterogeneous considerations are also involved, {{would be a good}} research focus.|$|R

25|$|As is {{the case}} when moving APL {{programs}} from one vendor's APL interpreter to another, APL programs invariably will require changes to their content. Depending on the compiler, variable declarations <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>needed,</b> certain language features {{would need to be}} removed or avoided, or the APL programs would need to be cleaned up in some way. Some features of the language, such as the execute function (an expression evaluator) and the various reflection and introspection functions from APL, such as the ability to return a function's text or to materialize a new function from text, are simply not practical to implement in machine code compilation.|$|E
25|$|Phase I {{clinical}} trials began in April 1984, {{and the decision}} to start Phase II trials was made a year later. These larger trials needed more bark and collection of a further 12,000 pounds was commissioned, which enabled some phase II trials to begin {{by the end of}} 1986. But by then it was recognized that the demand for taxol might be substantial and that more than 60,000 pounds of bark <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>needed</b> as a minimum. This unprecedentedly large amount brought ecological concerns about the impact on yew populations into focus for the first time, as local politicians and foresters expressed unease at the program.|$|E
25|$|By mid-1742, the War of the Austrian Succession {{had broken}} out in Europe. Principally fought by Prussia and Austria over {{possession}} of Silesia, the war soon engulfed {{most of the major}} powers of Europe, who joined two competing alliances. The scale of this new war dwarfed any of the fighting in the Americas, and drew Britain and Spain's attention back to operations on the European continent. The return of Vernon's fleet in 1742 marked the end of major offensive operations in the War of Jenkins' Ear. France entered the war in 1744, emphasizing the European theatre and planning an ambitious invasion of Britain. While it ultimately failed, the threat persuaded British policymakers of the dangers of sending significant forces to the Americas which <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>needed</b> at home.|$|E

500|$|Montcalm had {{organized}} the French forces into three brigades and a reserve. He commanded the Royal Roussillon and Berry battalions {{in the center}} of the entrenchments, while Lévis commanded the Béarn, Guyenne, and la Reine battalions on the right, and Bourlamaque led the La Sarre and Languedoc battalions on the left. Each battalion was given roughly [...] of the entrenchment to defend. Redoubts with cannon protected the flanks of the entrenchments, although the one on the right had not been completed. The low ground between the left flank and the La Chute River was guarded by militia and marines, who had also constructed abatis to help protect their position. Reserve forces were either in the fort itself, or on the grounds between the fort and the entrenchments on Mount Hope. Portions of each battalion were also held in reserve, to assist in areas where they <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>needed.</b>|$|E
500|$|In the summer, {{water would}} be used to sluice and pan the dirt, {{separating}} out the heavier gold from gravel. This required miners to construct sluices, which were sequences of wooden boxes [...] long, through which the dirt would be washed; up to 20 of these <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>needed</b> for each mining operation. The sluices in turn required lots of water, usually produced by creating a dam and ditches or crude pipes. [...] "Bench gold" [...] mining on the hill sides could not use sluice lines because water could not be pumped that high up. Instead, these mines used rockers, boxes that moved {{back and forth like a}} cradle, to create the motion needed for separation. Finally, the resulting gold dust could be exported out of the Klondike; exchanged for paper money at the rate of $16 ($430) per troy ounce (ozt) through one of the major banks that opened in Dawson City, or simply used as money when dealing with local traders.|$|E

500|$|The Ombla HPP is {{proposed}} {{to be built}} as an underground power plant utilizing headwaters of the Ombla River through a planned underground reservoir, which would hold the water behind a grout curtain and a concrete block extending from [...] below sea level to [...] a.s.l.

The proposed power plant is planned to have productive capacity of 68megawatts. The project is to be financed in part through a European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) loan in the amount of 123.2million Euros, approved on 22 November 2011. Total project cost is estimated at 152.4million Euros. Pursuant to the European Union Habitats Directive, an additional assessment and a biodiversity management plan are required before the EBRD actually provides the approved funds. The documents should define any mitigating or compensating activities that <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>needed.</b>|$|E
500|$|The designs Pick {{commissioned}} from Holden (1931–33) {{established a}} new standard for the Underground, with the prototype station at Sudbury Town being described by architectural historian Nikolaus Pevsner as a [...] "landmark" [...] {{and the start of}} [...] "the 'classic' phase of Underground architecture". To ensure that the new stations achieved the complete and coherent design that he wanted, Pick instructed the engineering departments to provide Holden with full details of all equipment needed for the stations. After late equipment changes by the engineers at the first few new stations compromised the integrated design, Pick took personal charge of the coordination of the architectural and engineering elements. In the mid-1930s when the introduction of trolleybuses to replace trams required the installation of new street poles to support overhead wiring, Pick was keenly interested that the design of the poles was coordinated to accommodate all of the possible equipment and signage that <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>needed.</b> He also oversaw the designs of the new bus stops and bus shelters that were installed when specified stopping points were introduced for bus services.|$|E
500|$|In May 1941, Representative Edith Nourse Rogers of Massachusetts {{introduced}} {{a bill in the}} U.S. Congress to establish a Women's Auxiliary Army Corps (WAAC). [...] "As the word auxiliary suggests, women would serve not in the Army, but with it." [...] As such, women were deprived of full military status and denied the benefits of their male counterparts. Opposition delayed the passage of the bill until May 1942. At the same time, the U.S. Navy's Bureau of Aeronautics believed the Navy would eventually need women in uniform, and had asked the Bureau of Naval Personnel, headed by Rear Admiral Chester W. Nimitz, to propose legislation, as it had done during World War I, authorizing women to serve in the Navy. [...] Nimitz was not considered an advocate for bringing women into the Navy, nor was he about to change course. [...] Soon, the Navy Department began receiving inquires whether WAAC legislation for the Navy might be imminent. In response, the head of the U.S. Naval Reserve expressed the view that the Civil Service would be able to supply any extra personnel that <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>needed.</b>|$|E
