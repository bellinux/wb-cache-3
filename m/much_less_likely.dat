5|$|Although {{the group}} of people at risk for SAH is younger than the {{population}} usually affected by stroke, the risk still increases with age. Young people are <b>much</b> <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> than middle-age people (risk ratio 0.1, or 10 percent) to have a subarachnoid hemorrhage. The risk continues to rise with age and is 60 percent higher in the very elderly (over 85) than in those between 45 and 55. Risk of SAH is about 25 percent higher in women over 55 compared to men the same age, probably reflecting the hormonal changes that result from the menopause, such as a decrease in estrogen levels.|$|E
5|$|Historians {{have varied}} interpretations of Marshall's vice presidency. Claire Suddath rated Marshall {{as one of}} the worst vice presidents in American history in a 2008 Time {{magazine}} article. Samuel Eliot Morison wrote that had Marshall carried out his constitutional duties, assumed the presidency, and made the concessions necessary for the passage of the League of Nations treaty in late 1920, the United States would have been much more involved in European affairs and could have helped prevent the rise of Adolf Hitler, which began in the following year. Morison {{and a number of other}} historians claim that Marshall's decision was an indirect cause of the Second World War. Charles Thomas, one of Marshall's biographers, wrote that although Marshall's assumption of the presidency would have made World War II <b>much</b> <b>less</b> <b>likely,</b> modern hypothetical speculation on the subject was unfair to Marshall, who made the correct decision in not forcibly removing Wilson from office, even temporarily.|$|E

5|$|Mammalian prey {{includes}} rabbits, hares, ground squirrels, raccoons (Procyon lotor), muskrats (Ondatra zibethicus), beavers (Castor canadensis), {{and deer}} fawns. Newborn, dead, sickly or already injured mammals are often targeted. However, more formidable prey such as adult raccoons and subadult beavers are sometimes attacked. In the Chesapeake Bay area, bald eagles are reportedly the main natural predators of raccoons. Where available, seal colonies can provide much food. On Protection Island, Washington, they commonly feed on harbor seal (Phoca vitulina) afterbirths, still-borns and sickly seal pups. On San Juan Island in Washington, introduced European rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus), mainly those killed by auto accidents, comprise nearly 60% of the dietary intake of eagles. In landlocked areas of North America, wintering bald eagles may become habitual predators of medium-sized mammals {{that occur in}} colonies or local concentrations, such as prairie dogs (Cynomys) and jackrabbits (Lepus). Together with the golden eagle, bald eagles are occasionally accused of preying on livestock, especially sheep (Ovis aries). There {{are a handful of}} proven cases of lamb predation, some of specimens weighing up to , by bald eagles but they are <b>much</b> <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> to attack a healthy lamb than a golden eagle and both species prefer native, wild prey and are unlikely to cause any extensive detriment to human livelihoods. There is one case of a bald eagle killing and feeding on an adult, pregnant ewe (then joined in eating the kill by at least 3 other eagles), which, weighing on average over , is much larger than any other known prey taken by this species.|$|E

50|$|Shingles {{are less}} durable than shakes, {{particularly}} in wet climates; shakes are {{finished with a}} drawknife or similar tool which leaves a smooth surface that resists water penetration, and this in turn slows the softening of wood by microorganisms.

5000|$|The fungal {{inoculum}} infects {{the growing}} cones of W. mirabilis early during their development, {{and a sharp}} increase in infection occurs when the pollination drops appear; through those drops the fungal spores may gain access to the interior of the developing seed. [...] Seeds in the wild may therefore be obliterated through fungal action even before they are fully developed. Seeds from botanical gardens or other cultivated sources are <b>much</b> cleaner and <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> to rot. The fungicide tebuconazole may be useful in controlling limited A. niger seed infection.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we provide}} {{evidence}} that reconciles the co-existence of high income mobility among people on low income and patterns of high persistence on income support among people whose income from government payments is low â€“ both phenomena have been founded in different Australian studies. We find that these phenomena are evident in data from the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) survey, but that they reflect the experiences of different groups of individuals. These groups of individuals are around the same size. While there is considerable mobility in income from the lowest two deciles of household equivalised income, this mobility is greater for those not reliant on welfare {{for the majority of}} their income than for those who are. The non-welfare reliant individuals appear to have substantially different characteristics compared with those in the (more disadvantaged) welfare reliant group, being <b>much</b> younger, <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> to suffer from a long-term health condition, more likely to be full-time students and <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> to have been divorced than the welfare reliant group. welfare reliance, income mobility, public transfers...|$|R

Future episodes, however, would be <b>much</b> <b>less</b> subtle (most <b>likely</b> due to extraordinary popularity of the first three episodes, which were aired as [...] "demos" [...] several months before the show was fully contracted).

40|$|A noncontacting {{ultrasonic}} sensor system {{is being developed}} for online inspection of thick section welds made by a robotic {{gas metal arc welding}} (GMAW) system. The sensor system consists of a pulsed laser for generating the ultrasound and an electromagnetic-acoustic transducer (EMAT) for receiving it. The sensor will follow closely behind the weld head and inspect the solidified weld bead for flaws. The main advantage of this technique is that flaws can be found and repaired before they are covered by subsequent welding passes. This is expected to be <b>much</b> simpler and <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> to induce further flaws than current practice since a large amount of otherwise good weld metal need not be removed to reach and repair a flaw.

40|$|This article {{examines}} {{what we know}} about how low-income fathers matter for children. The authors first provide a theoretical background about how parents generally (and fathers more specifically) are expected to influence childrenâ€™s development and well-being. The authors note the importance of considering differ-ences across childrenâ€™s age, gender, and race/ethnicity; and they identify key methodological challenges in this area. Then, they summarize the literature on residen-tial fathers and child well-being, finding that greater involvement has been linked to better outcomes for children; however, much of this research has been con-ducted on more socioeconomically advantaged sam-ples. For fathers who live away from their children, child support payments appear to improve childrenâ€™s outcomes, but the benefits of father-child interaction are <b>much</b> <b>less</b> clear and <b>likely</b> depend {{on the quality of the}} interaction and the characteristics of fathers. Overall, the authors conclude that low-income fathers can have a positive influence on childrenâ€™s well-being, but the evidence about the population overall is rather weak...|$|R
