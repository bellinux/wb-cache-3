500|$|Coyotes have {{occasionally}} mated with dogs, sometimes producing crosses colloquially {{known as}} [...] "coydogs". Such matings are {{rare in the}} wild, as the <b>mating</b> <b>cycles</b> of dogs and coyotes do not coincide, and coyotes are usually antagonistic towards dogs. Hybridization usually only occurs when coyotes are expanding into areas where conspecifics are few, and dogs are the only alternatives. Even then, pup survival rates are lower than normal, as dogs do not form pair bonds with coyotes, thus making the rearing of pups more difficult. In captivity, F1 hybrids (first generation) {{tend to be more}} mischievous and less manageable as pups than dogs, and are less trustworthy on maturity than wolf-dog hybrids. Hybrids vary in appearance, but generally retain the coyote's usual characteristics. F1 hybrids tend to be intermediate in form between dogs and coyotes, while F2 hybrids (second generation) are more varied. Both F1 and F2 hybrids resemble their coyote parents in terms of shyness and intrasexual aggression. Hybrids are fertile and can be successfully bred through four generations. Melanistic coyotes owe their black pelts to a mutation that first arose in domestic dogs. A population of nonalbino white coyotes in Newfoundland owe their coloration to a melanocortin 1 receptor mutation inherited from Golden Retrievers.|$|E

40|$|The {{harvest mouse}} (Micromys minutus) is Britain’s {{smallest}} rodent, {{and one of}} its least‐studied mammals. Mounting concerns over the status of its British populations highlights the paucity of information about this species, not least about different aspects of its behaviour. I study the mating behaviour of the harvest mouse, focusing on female mate choice, and specifically on the effect familiarity with the male has on the female’s mating preference. In order to isolate the role of familiarity on female mate choice, I conducted a controlled choice experiment, in which the female had a choice between two tethered males ‐ one familiar and one unfamiliar to her. The results support the prediction that female harvest mice prefer familiar males over unfamiliar ones when they are in oestrus. Results also reveal that females spend more time in proximity to unfamiliar males when they are not in oestrus, and that the difference in the body weight of the males affects the strength of their response. A more naturalistic experiment was also set up, in which a female and two males ‐ again one familiar and one unfamiliar – were allowed to interact unhindered. This setup allowed the recording of full <b>mating</b> <b>cycles,</b> including copulations. These experiments provide descriptive information about both inter‐ and intra‐sexual interactions surrounding mating. Dominance relations between the two males were very clear cut and the female mated with the dominant male, and only with him. Familiarity did not seem to affect the female’s mating preference. In summary this study shows that female harvest mice prefer familiar males over unfamiliar ones and that male familiarity and dominance interact to influence female mate choice. The study also provides background information about the harvest mouse’s mating behaviour and intra‐male interactions with potential significance for the understanding of other aspects of the natural history of this poorly studied species. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{dissertation}} work {{discussed here}} {{focuses on the}} behavioral and physiological aspects of visual sexual signaling in the blue crab, Callinectes sapidus. The blue crab has a pair of apposition compound eyes that are relatively acute (1. 5 ° resolution) for an arthropod. The eyes have two photopigments sensitive to blue (λ max = 440 nm) and green (λ max = 500 nm) light, allowing for simple color vision. Visual cues and signals are used during antagonistic and sexual communication and primarily involve claw-waving motions. A primary feature of the blue crab morphology is its sexually dimorphic claw coloration; males have blue and white claws and females have red claws. However, despite the potential for interesting color signaling, visual cues have typically been considered non-important, particularly in sexual communication where chemical cues have dominated blue crab signaling studies. In a series of experiments designed to simultaneously test the role of visual cues in mating behavior and blue crab color vision, I tested males' responses to photographs of females with differently colored claws. I found that photographs of females elicited male courting behaviors. I also found that males preferred females with red claws over those with white or isoluminant (i. e. matched brightness) gray claws. The discrimination of red from isoluminant grey showed the use of color vision in male mate choice. In natural populations, the claws of sexually mature females vary from light orange to deep red. To determine males' abilities discriminate between similar colors, I tested male color preferences for red against several shades of orange varying in brightness. Overall, males showed an innate preference for red-clawed females over those with variations of orange claws. However, in tests between red and orange shades similar in both brightness and hue, male blue crabs did not show a distinct preference, suggesting that males are either not able or not motivated to discriminate between these shades. Further, my results suggest that male blue crabs may use a mixture of chromatic and achromatic cues to discriminate between long-wavelength colors. After confirming the use of color in mate choice, I focused {{on the role of}} claw color in intraspecific communication. To quantify claw coloration, I measured spectral reflectance of claws of a blue crab population in North Carolina. In both sexes, the color of the claw varied with reproductive maturity and may act as a cue of reproductive readiness. Additionally, there was individual variation in claw color which could indicate individual quality. I have modeled the appearance of claw coloration to the blue crab eye and found that these color differences are visible to the blue crab eye and potentially signal gender, reproductive readiness, and/or individual quality. After investigating male mate choice, I began investigating visual aspects of female mating behavior. In the blue crab, like many crustaceans, courtship occurs during the female molting cycle and copulation takes place after the female has shed her exoskeleton. In crustaceans and other arthropods with compound eyes, the corneal lens of each facet is part of the exoskeleton and thus shed during molting. I used optomotor assays to evaluate the impact of molting on visual acuity (as measured by the minimum resolvable angle &alpha min) in the female blue crab. I found that visual acuity decreases substantially in the days prior to molting and is gradually recovered after molting. Prior to molting, &alpha min was 1. 8 °, a value approximating the best possible acuity in this species. In the 24 hours before molting, &alpha min increased to a median of 15. 0 ° (N= 12), an eight-fold drop in visual acuity. Six days after molting, &alpha min returned to the pre-molting value. Micrographs of C. sapidus eyes showed that a gap between the corneal lens and the crystalline cone appeared approximately five days prior to shedding and increased in width the process progressed. This separation was likely responsible for the loss of visual acuity observed in behavioral tests. Since mating is limited to the female's pubertal molt, a reduction in acuity during this time may {{have an effect on the}} sensory cues used in female mate choice. These results may be broadly applicable to all arthropods that molt and have particular importance for crustaceans that molt multiple times in their lifetime or have <b>mating</b> <b>cycles</b> paired with molting.

40|$|A {{series of}} grazing {{experiments}} was conducted, in the summer/autumn of 2001, 2002 and 2003, {{to investigate the}} effects of poplar (Populus spp.) and/or willow (Salix spp.) supplementation, during mating, on ewe production and reproduction when grazing drought pasture. Each experiment involved a rotational grazing system with 300 mixed-age Romney ewes, divided into three groups of 100 ewes each. In each year, all ewes were offered low quality simulated drought pasture, containing more than 60 % dead matter, at an allowance sufficient to provide a potential desired intake of 0. 70 kg dry matter (DM) /day, for periods of 9 to 12 weeks, including two <b>mating</b> <b>cycles.</b> Mean pre-and post-grazing pasture masses averaged over the three years were 1100 and 600 kg DM/ha. The pasture consumed in all years was typical of pasture available to grazing livestock in a drought; it was high in neutral detergent fibre (NDF; approximately 600 g/kg DM), low in organic matter digestibility (OMD, approximately 0. 52) and metabolisable energy (ME; approximately 7. 5 MJ/kg DM) and contained approximately 20 g nitrogen (N) /kg DM. The supplementary poplar and willow diets were always superior to drought pasture consumed by the ewes, being higher in OMD (approximately 0. 67), ME (approximately 10 MJ/kg DM) and total N (approximately 26 g/kg DM) and lower in NDF (approximately 383 g/kg DM). Tree fodder diets also contained substantial concentrations of the secondary compounds condensed tannin (CT; range 7 to 52 g/kg DM), salicin (approximately 2 g/kg DM) and other phenolic glycosides (approximately 21 g/kg DM), with willow (27 to 52 g/kg DM) containing greater concentrations of CT compared with poplar (7 to 19 g/kg DM). Mean diameter of the tree fodder stem consumed during the series of experiments was approximately 7 mm for poplar and 4 mm for willow with the diameter increasing over the experimental periods in four cases out of live (P< 0. 05). After the supplementation period, the three groups were joined together and grazed on perennial ryegrass/white clover pasture until the conclusion of each experiment at weaning. In all years, the effect of poplar and/or willow supplementation on ewe live weight (LW) and body condition score (BCS) change; the proportion of lambs (reproductive rate) at pregnancy scanning, lambing, docking and weaning; and wool production and staple length from ewe fleeces with approximately 11 months growth, were measured. Experiment 1 was designed {{to determine how much}} poplar fodder needed to be fed to increase ewe production and reproduction over a 71 -day supplementation period. The experiment involved a high supplementation group, offered 1. 5 kg fresh poplar/ewe/day; a low supplementation group, offered 0. 75 kg fresh poplar/ewe/day; and a control group that was offered no tree fodder. Ewes in the high and low treatments lost less LW (- 67 and - 71 vs. - 82 g/day; P< 0. 05) and BCS (- 0. 78 and - 1. 27 vs. - 1. 31 units; P< 0. 05) compared with unsupplemented ewes. Reproductive rate was relatively low in the control group (121 lambs born/ 100 ewes mated), with poplar supplementation increasing ewe reproductive rate by approximately 20 % units (P< 0. 05) and 30 % units (P< 0. 001) for the low and high treatment groups, respectively, at scanning, lambing, docking and weaning. The increase in reproductive rate in supplemented ewes was due to increases in both conception rate (number of ewes pregnant/ 100 ewes mated) and fecundity (number of lambs born/ 100 ewes mated). Experiment 2 was designed to determine if production and reproduction varied between ewes fed poplar versus willow at the same rate of supplementation, 1. 4 kg fresh forage/ewe/day, for 87 days. Again, reproductive rate was relatively low in the control group (133 lambs born/ 100 ewes mated), with willow supplementation reducing L. W loss (- 86 g/day vs. - 103 g/day; P< 0. 01) and increasing reproductive rate by 15 %, 17 % 21 % and 20 % units at ultrasound scanning (P= 0. 097), lambing (P= 0. 087), docking (P< 0. 05) and weaning (P= 0. 058), respectively. The increase in reproductive rate was due to an increase in fecundity; supplementation did not affect conception rate in this experiment. Unlike the previous experiment, poplar supplementation showed no effect on reproductive rate, despite the increase in DM intake and the apparent reduction in LW loss of 9 g/day (P- 0. 11). It is likely that severe contamination of the poplar fodder with Melampsora larici-populina, or poplar leaf rust, confounded the results. Building on the results of the first two grazing trials, {{the next step was to}} determine the period (days) of tree fodder supplementation necessary to achieve a response in reproductive rate. Experiment 3 involved ewes fed 1. 3 kg fresh willow/ewe/day for a 'long' period, 63 days including 6 weeks of mating, and a 'short' period, 31 days including 3 weeks of mating. The mating period commenced on the same day for all groups and lasted for 6 weeks. Willow supplementation for 63 days reduced ewe LW loss (- 96 g/day vs. - 147 g/day; P< 0. 05) and BCS (- 0. 79 VS. - 1. 09; P< 0. 05) loss, compared with unsupplemented ewes; however, it did not increase reproductive rate at scanning and lambing. The lack of response in willow-supplemented ewes was likely to be due to toxic concentrations of zearalenone (1. 5 mg/kg DM), an oestrogenic mycotoxin, in the drought pasture during mating, which confounded the results by negating any potential benefits due to increased nutrient intakes. Willow supplementation for 63 days did increase reproductive rate at weaning by 13 % units, due to a 9 % unit (P< 0. 05) reduction in post-natal lamb mortality, from 17. 1 to 8. 4 %. Supplementation for 31 days did not appear to influence ewe reproduction and production parameters. Overall, the rate of LW loss was greater in Experiment 3 compared with the first two experiments. Seven indoor in vivo digestibility experiments were conducted at the following times; early April 2001 (poplar), February, March and April 2002 (all poplar), and December, March and April 2003 (all willow). Each 14 -day trial involved 6 male cryptorchid lambs, individually fed in metabolism cages. The experiments showed that the digestibility of poplar and willow tree fodder declined from late spring to autumn (P< 0. 05), but that the decline was much smaller than the decline in digestibility of grass-based pastures in New Zealand over the same time period. The experiments also showed that mean ME and digestibilities were generally higher for willow than for poplar. The seven in vivo digestibility coefficients were then used to develop a standard curve for in vitro prediction of in vivo digestibility, this standard was used to analyse all unknown tree fodder samples from the three grazing experiments. Results from the three grazing experiments showed that supplementing ewes grazing drought pasture during mating with poplar and willow tree fodder consistently increased DM intake by 0. 25 to 0. 33 kg DM/ewe/day for ewes offered 1. 3 to 1. 5 kg fresh willow or poplar each day and increased calculated total DM intakes from 0. 67 to 1. 03 kg DM/ewe/day in Experiment 1, from 0. 59 to 0. 86 kg DM/ewe/day in Experiment 2 and from 0. 47 to 0. 75 kg DM/ewe/day in Experiment 3. Supplementation also consistently reduced LW loss and loss in BCS and substantially increased lambing rate through increased conception rate and fecundity and reduced post-natal lamb mortality. The effects on LW and BCS gradually declined in the post-treatment period and were no longer evident by commencement of lambing. There was no effect of supplementation on wool production or staple length in any of the experiments. One of the unexpected results of the experiments was an average 34 % reduction in post-natal lamb mortality over three years, due to willow/poplar supplementation of ewes during mating. Initial results showed that despite significant increases in fecundity in supplemented ewes in 2001 and 2002, post-natal lamb mortality was not increased. This result, combined with a statistically significant reduction in lamb mortality in Experiment 3 (P< 0. 05), in the absence of any differences in fecundity between the groups, suggested that tree fodder supplementation during mating may have reduced lamb mortality in all three years, but that the effect was masked by the increase in reproductive rate in the first two experiments. Therefore, data from the three field trials were combined and analysed by adjusting all mortality data to equal birth rank and sex; this showed a significant reduction due to supplementation (P< 0. 05) with no treatment-year interaction. The increase in ewe production and reproduction in supplemented ewes was likely due to increases in nutrient intake, through increased DM, ME and CP intakes, prior to and during mating and to increased outputs of undegradable dietary protein and microbial protein from the rumen, per unit of crude protein consumed, thus increasing amino acid absorption. An increase in ovulation rate of 1. 5 % units/MJ of digestible energy consumed (Smith 1985) should result in increases in ovulation rate due to tree fodder supplementation of only 5 and 4 % units in 2001 and 2002, respectively; however, the increases in scanning rate were substantially greater at 41 and 16 % units. Therefore, it is possible that the majority of the increase in reproductive rate was due to increased essential amino acid absorption, which is consistent with increases found in ewes mated on CT-containing forages such as Lotus corniculatus (Birdsfoot trefoil). Gross margin analyses using actual data from unsupplemented ewes in each of the three grazing trials compared with Riverside Farm's commercial ewes from the same years showed that drought reduced scanning rates by an average of 22. 4 % and wool production by 20 % and that this reduction decreases sheep production income by approximately $ 14 /ewe. Further analysis showed that almost half the cost ($ 6 /ewe) could be recovered by supplementing ewes with tree fodder in a drought. On a whole farm basis this represents $ 58 /hectare cost benefit due to tree fodder supplementation. Fungal contamination was a significant factor in the results obtained in Experiments 2 and 3. In all years, simulated drought pasture contained metabolites of zearalenone and the trichothecenes nivalenol and deoxy-nivalenol, produced by Fusarium fungi, while in Experiment 2 the poplar was severely contaminated with Melampsora larici-populina, or poplar leaf rust. Zearalenone concentrations in pasture were at their greatest in Experiment 3 and increased to over 2 mg/kg DM during the mating period. This may explain the lack of increase in reproductive rate expected in willow-supplemented ewes in Experiment 3, which was a feature of previous experiments; however, it did not explain the much greater loss in ewe LW in Experiment 3. Nivalenol (NIV) and deoxy-nivalenol (DON) are common trichothecene toxins found in New Zealand pasture and were found in pasture samples from all three experiments, however, the concentration in Experiment 3 was three- to four-fold greater than in previous experiments. Reports have suggested that trichothecenes may be partly responsible for the reduced growth of otherwise healthy livestock grazing dry autumn pasture, often referred to as 'ill thrift'. However, based on evidence from dosing experiments, it is unlikely that the quantities of NIV and DON present in pasture in Experiment 3 accounted for all of the greater LW loss seen in this experiment. This suggests that these toxins are likely to be indicators of other more potent fungal toxins, which have a much bigger impact on livestock health and production. It is likely that fungal toxins contribute more to reduced reproduction in breeding ewes and to ill thrift in young stock grazing dry autumn pastures in East Coast regions than is currently acknowledge...|$|E

We chose logit link function and binomial distribution and we used log-likelihood-ratio (LL) and Wald tests (X(2) Wald) to test the mean values. The factors of variation included in the model were the year, the stallion, {{the age of the}} mare at mating, the sire and the category of the mare. Logistic regression results showed that age and sire affected both the overall conception rate and the first-cycle conception rate of the mares whilst category and stallion influenced only the overall conception rate. To our knowledge, this is the first study showing that the sire of the mare can affect both the first-cycle conception rate and the overall conception rate of the mares...|$|R
50|$|In {{response}} to Voyagers {{exposure to the}} swarm, Kes (Jennifer Lien) begins eating abnormally, including insects and soil. In sickbay, she has a fever, a dangerously elevated pulse and blood pressure, and a tumorous growth on her back. She resists the Doctor’s (Robert Picardo) treatment and locks herself in his office, finally relenting only to explain to Captain Janeway that she's undergoing the elogium: the Ocampa <b>mating</b> <b>cycle.</b> This process only happens once and usually affects Ocampa between four and five years old—but Kes is not even two. Neelix (Ethan Phillips) and Kes agonize over whether to have children and the ramifications of becoming parents. After discussing children and family with Lieutenant Tuvok (Tim Russ), Neelix decides he's ready to be a father, while Kes has instead decided against it. Ultimately, because the Doctor believes the elogium was artificially induced by the creatures' proximity to the ship, it may come upon her again later in her life when she is ready.|$|R
5000|$|In Bayou St. John, the cichlid {{threatens to}} {{overwhelm}} native species and ruin {{the efforts of}} the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries to restore the historical fishery of Bayou St. John. Because the fish competes with native fish for shallow mating sites, it reduces the chances of the diverse fishery ever being fully recovered. The fish has already eliminated several smaller fish in this bayou, including killifish and sheepshead minnows. In fact, if the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries did not routinely re-stock several midsized species, {{it is likely that the}} cichlid would have eliminated these fish too. Because of this, there is even a competition at the City Park Big Bass Fishing Rodeo & Fishtival to catch the most cichlids. According to a fisherman Joe Adams, who participates in the competition, [...] "They will eat just about anything...I know one guy who catches them with French fries...pieces of a hot dog and pieces of canned corn." [...] Despite these efforts, there is practically no chance or eradicating this fish from New Orleans' waters mainly because of its quick <b>mating</b> <b>cycle.</b>|$|R
