In contrast, South Vietnamese forces within the vicinity of Đồng Xoài were severely depleted, and did not have sufficient strength to defeat the Viet Cong. Furthermore, there was only one remaining battalion in South Vietnam’s strategic reserve, and it <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>enough</b> to drive the Communist out from the area if it was committed.|$|E

25|$|Cryptanalysis of symmetric-key ciphers {{typically}} involves {{looking for}} {{attacks against the}} block ciphers or stream ciphers that are more efficient than any attack that could be against a perfect cipher. For example, a simple brute force attack against DES requires one known plaintext and 255 decryptions, trying {{approximately half of the}} possible keys, to reach a point at which chances are better than even that the key sought will have been found. But this <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>enough</b> assurance; a linear cryptanalysis attack against DES requires 243 known plaintexts and approximately 243 DES operations. This is a considerable improvement on brute force attacks.|$|E
25|$|When an {{inductive}} circuit is opened, the current through the inductance collapses quickly, creating a large voltage {{across the open}} circuit of the switch or relay. If the inductance is large enough, the energy may generate a spark, causing the contact points to oxidize, deteriorate, or sometimes weld together, or destroying a solid-state switch. A snubber capacitor across the newly opened circuit creates a path for this impulse to bypass the contact points, thereby preserving their life; these were commonly found in contact breaker ignition systems, for instance. Similarly, in smaller scale circuits, the spark <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>enough</b> to damage the switch but may still radiate undesirable radio frequency interference (RFI), which a filter capacitor absorbs. Snubber capacitors are usually employed with a low-value resistor in series, to dissipate energy and minimize RFI. Such resistor-capacitor combinations are available in a single package.|$|E

25|$|HTML5 is {{the latest}} version of Hypertext Markup Language specification. HTML defines how user agents, such as web browsers, are to present {{websites}} based upon their underlying code. This new web standard changes the way that users are affected by the internet and their privacy on the internet. HTML5 expands the number of methods given to a website to store information locally on a client as well as the amount of data that can be stored. As such, privacy risks are increased. For instance, merely erasing cookies <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>enough</b> to remove potential tracking methods since data could be mirrored in web storage, another means of keeping information in a user's web browser. There are so many sources of data storage that it is challenging for web browsers to present sensible privacy settings. As the power of web standards increases, so do potential misuses.|$|E

500|$|Mark Sutherland from Billboard {{gave the}} album a {{favourable}} review.

[...] Sutherland said that [...] "The end result <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>enough</b> to convince America it's missing out, but expect this album to bring the already-converted back onboard in droves." [...] Dave Karger from Entertainment Weekly gave it a B+ rating. Karger felt that, although the album [...] "contains fewer knockout potential hits than past efforts", it does feature [...] "the two strongest soul-flecked tracks of Williams' career", in [...] "You Know Me" [...] and [...] "Won't Do That", and that the singer [...] "simply sounds fantastic with a horn section".|$|E
500|$|It was renewed for a {{third season}} on March 6, 2010. As part of a {{reorganization}} of its 2010 midseason line up to capture more market for American Idol, the Fox network shifted Fringe to 9:00p.m. on Fridays. [...] This timeslot, commonly considered the [...] "Friday night death slot" [...] for several previous Fox shows due to cancellation shortly following the move to that slot, left critics considering the show's fate. [...] While The X-Files originally premiered during this slot and {{would continue to be}} a highly successful series, critics were unsure if Fringe could duplicate this performance. [...] In this slot, the show competed with Supernatural, a series that attracts similar types of viewers. Fox's Entertainment President Kevin Reilly, in response to these concerns, stated that 45% of Fringes viewership is from time shifting recording through digital video receivers, and does not expect the viewership numbers to change significantly with the change to Friday. Reilly further postulated that [...] "If it does anywhere near what it did on Thursdays, we can glue that show to the schedule because it can be a big win for us". Further promoted by the critical reaction to the rescheduling, the Fox network created a self-deprecating promotional advertisement acknowledging the reputation of the time slot, including quotes from other media outlets concerned about the move, but asserted that the move would [...] "re-animate" [...] the show. The network also created a music video, set to [...] "Echoes" [...] by the band Klaxons as a means of summarizing the third season to date prior to the first Friday broadcast. Joshua Jackson, who plays Peter Bishop on the show, cautioned that time-shifted viewership <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>enough</b> to save the show: [...] "It's not that not enough people are watching Fringe, it's that not enough people are watching Fringe during the hour that it's on the air, which is key for the network." ...|$|E
