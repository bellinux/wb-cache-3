40|$|Magnetoencephalography is a {{technique}} that can noninvasively measure the brain signal. There are many advantages of using this technique rather than similar procedures such as the EEG {{for the evaluation of}} medical diseases. However, one of its main problems is its high sensitivity to sources causing <b>metallic</b> <b>distortion</b> of the signal, and the removal of this type of artifacts remains unsolved. In this study {{a technique}} for reducing metallic interference was presented. This algorithm was based on AMUSE, a second order blind source separation method, and a procedure for choosing the artifactual independent components was also presented. The results showed that the elimination of these artifacts would be possible by means of the application of this AMUSE-based interference reduction procedurePeer ReviewedPostprint (published version...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} use of {{electromagnetics}} for both steering and tracking of medical instruments in minimally invasive surgeries. The end application is virtual navigation of the lung for biopsy of early stage cancer nodules. Navigation to the peripheral regions of the lung is difficult due to physical dimensions of the bronchi and current methods have low successes rates for accurate diagnosis. Firstly, the potential use of DC magnetic fields for the actuation of catheter devices with permanently magnetised distal attachments is investigated. Catheter models formed from various materials and magnetic tip formations are {{used to examine the}} usefulness of relatively low power and compact electromagnets. The force and torque that can be exerted on a small permanent magnet is shown to be extremely limited. Hence, after this initial investigation we turn our attention to electromagnetic tracking, {{in the development of a}} novel, low-cost implementation of a GPS-like system for navigating within a patient. A planar magnetic transmitter, formed on a printed circuit board for a low-profile and low cost manufacture, is used to generate a low frequency magnetic field distribution which is detected by a small induction coil sensor. The field transmitter is controlled by a novel closed-loop system that ensures a highly stable magnetic field with reduced interference from one transmitter coil to another. Efficient demodulation schemes are presented which utilise synchronous detection of each magnetic field component experienced by the sensor. The overall tracking accuracy of the system is shown to be less than 2 mm with an orientation error less than 1 °. A novel demodulation implementation using a unique undersampling approach allows {{the use of}} reduced sample rates to sample the signals of interest without loss of tracking accuracy. This is advantageous for embedded microcontroller implementations of EM tracking systems. The EM tracking system is demonstrated in the pre-clinical environment of a breathing lung phantom. The airways of the phantom are successfully navigated using the system in combination with a 3 D computer model rendered from CT data. Registration is achieved using both a landmark rigid registration method and a hybrid fiducial-free approach. The design of a planar magnetic shield structure for blocking the effects of <b>metallic</b> <b>distortion</b> from below the transmitter is presented which successfully blocks the impact of large ferromagnetic objects such as operating tables. A variety of shielding material are analysed with MuMetal and ferrite both providing excellent shieling performance and an increased signal to noise ratio. Finally, the effect of conductive materials and human tissue on magnetic field measurements is presented. Error due to induced eddy currents and capacitive coupling is shown to severely affect EM tracking accuracy at higher frequencies...|$|E

40|$|One of {{the many}} {{advantages}} of low pressure carburizing (LPC) {{is that it can}} be combined with high-pressure gas quenching. This makes it possible to achieve workpieces with pure <b>metallic</b> surfaces, less <b>distortion</b> hardening, and, above all, it allows a more reliable and repeatable treatment than conventional oil quenching. This article presents a study of the distortion rate of workpieces carburized at low pressure then quenched in nitrogen at 1. 4 MPa. By comparing the distortion which takes place during the carburizing stage only and the carburizing combined with post-carburizing heat treatment {{it will be possible to}} assess the distortion rate and its causes at the different stages of the heat treatment process...|$|R
40|$|AbstractComputer-Integrated Surgery and intra-operative {{navigation}} {{opened a}} new era in interventional medicine. With the use of surgical navigation systems it has become possible to track tools and visualize the patient's preoperative records in real-time in the desired region, or overlay patient information and critical data. Navigation, as an enabling technology, has facilitated surgical simulation and training of medical students. In the future, we expect the rise of the concept of “ubiquitous tracking”, where all major parts of the medical working environment are tracked and modeled real-time in a virtual environment according to their physical state and position. One of the emerging modalities, electromagnetic tracking's (EMT) main advantage {{is that it does not}} required the continuous line-of-sight between the marker and the receiver, while this remains a serious limitation for optical tracking. EMT makes it possible to assist complex interventions, such as bronchoscopy, radiosurgery, heart ablation and beyond 0. In the future, tracking technology should get embedded in the entire operating theater through the combination of EMT sensors and RF ID tags. A fully sensorized operating room (OR) would allow for the better understanding of the procedures, the motion of the tools and the devices, track every movement of the patient, or the posture and the gestures of the surgeon—all without constraining the intervention. This will lead to an enormous improvement in interventional simulation and workflow analysis, and will result in the dramatic improvement of assistive surgical technologies. However, current EMT systems are highly susceptible to the presence of other electronic devices and <b>metallic</b> <b>distortions</b> 0. Ferromagnetic items, such as the surgical tool and instruments (laparoscopic forceps, cutlery, trays, etc.) alter the EM field, therefore the tracking accuracy is highly reduced, and measurements become less reliable. Due to recent advancement in system design, certain materials (e. g., titanium) do not cause significant error any more, but there is still no general solution for metallic sensitivity 0. Further weakness is lower accuracy compared to optical modality and the working volume being significantly limited. In the near future, the research community will be able to overcome most of the technical difficulties, given the right approach and methodology. A few years from now, the primary issues will be solved, including static error correction and susceptibility reduction. Our group is currently focusing on the development of a unified method—a quick calibration protocol—that can assess EM distortions in a given workspace rapidly, and based on what compensation for static distortions of the EM field becomes possible. Next, dynamic distortions have to be measured, modeled and simulated, enabling device-specific tracking in the medical environment 0. Furthermore, all active and passive devices in the OR should be modeled and tracked to support the concept of ubiquitous tracking. Reliable simulation programs will be available for modeling the field and the distortion caused by the individual instruments. The further development of systems will include the support of multi-sensor applications, significant extension of the work space and innovative types of sensors. Within a few decades, we will have accurate soft tissue models available, beyond the current model of the surgical tools. Therefore it will be possible to immediately determine how the magnetic field was affected by the surgical tools. The compensation will be feasible in real time, thus the position of sensors will be highly trusted, and all environmental variables fully tracked and followed. Ultimately, wireless power transmission technologies will overcome cabled ones in these applications 0. The sensors will also be used to transmit and receive power for their functioning; however it will severely influence the EM field, requiring dynamic compensation for distortions. This would leave more space for the physicians, while allowing complete tracking and control of the operating theater. Our paper presents the concept of “ubiquitous tracking” in the medical environment. We enlist the advantages and hinder falls of the technology that will enable complete EMT in the OR. We began to work on the currently most pressing issue, the susceptibility of the EMT systems to the environmental effects. Thorough measurements within the entire workspace have been taken, and we started to develop a model for error assessment and a compact tool for rapid calibration. This shall be a plexiglass calibration bracket that was designed to best measure the possible distortions in a given field. CT breeds and MR fiducials will be incorporated allowing a gold standard calibration to the CAD model. Eventually, the field is advancing towards the concept of fully controlled operating room, where the optical and electromagnetic tracking-based interventions can be done with reasonably high accuracy. Compensating the electromagnetic fields distortions in real-time, tracking can be used to improve minimally invasive procedures and serve as an enabling technology for various medical procedures...|$|R
40|$|An {{ion engine}} is a plasma {{thruster}} which produces thrust by extracting ions from the plasma and accelerating them to high velocity with an electrostatic field. The ions are then neutralized {{and leave the}} engine as high velocity neutral particles. The advantages of ion engines are high specific impulse and efficiency {{and their ability to}} operate over a wide range of input powers. In comparison with other electric thrusters, the ion engine has higher efficiency and specific impulse than thermal electric devices such as the arcjet, microwave, radio frequency, and laser heated thrusters and can operate at much lower current levels than the MPD thruster. However, the thrust level for an ion engine may be lower than a thermal electric thruster of the same operating power, consistent with its higher specific impulse, and therefore ion engines are best suited for missions which can tolerate longer duration propulsive phases. The critical issue for the ion engine is lifetime, since the prospective missions may require operation for several thousands of hours. The critical components of the ion engine, with respect to engine lifetime, are the screen and accelerating grid structures. Typically, these are large metal screens that must support a large voltage difference and maintain a small gap between them. <b>Metallic</b> whisker growth, <b>distortion,</b> and vibration can lead to arcing, and {{over a long period of}} time ion sputtering will erode the grid structures and change their geometry. In order to study the effects of long time operation of the grid structure, we are developing computer codes based on the particle-in-cell (PIC) technique and laser induced fluorescence (LIF) diagnostic techniques to study the physical processes which control the performance and lifetime of the grid structures...|$|R
