40|$|The {{guinea-pig}} intestine {{was investigated}} {{to determine which}} neurones are excited via NK 1 receptors. The specific NK 1 receptor agonists [Sar 9, Met(O 2) 11]-SP and septide contracted the circular muscle of all regions via a tetrodotoxin (TTX) -insensitive mechanism. In the proximal colon, they also evoked a TTX-sensitive relaxation; in the distal colon, the contractions were larger when nerve impulses were blocked with TTX, indicating that the agonists excited inhibitory <b>motor</b> <b>neurones.</b> In the duodenum and ileum, TTX reduced agonist-evoked contractions indicating that excitatory <b>motor</b> <b>neurones</b> were activated. In the presence of indomethacin, TTX enhanced contractions of ileal circular muscle evoked by these agonists suggesting that NK 1 receptors were on inhibitory <b>motor</b> <b>neurones.</b> Blockade of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) enhanced NK 1 receptor agonist evoked contractions of duodenal circular muscle, indicating that the agonists excite inhibitory <b>motor</b> <b>neurones</b> in duodenum. Neurones immunoreactive for NK 1 receptors were studied in the duodenum and distal colon. As reported previously for the ileum, 1 some neurones were immunoreactive for NOS and had Dogiel type I morphology; features characteristic of inhibitory <b>motor</b> <b>neurones.</b> In conclusion, there are functional NK 1 receptors on excitatory and inhibitory <b>motor</b> <b>neurones</b> in the guinea-pig small intestine and on inhibitory <b>motor</b> <b>neurones</b> in the colon...|$|R

40|$|The {{crayfish}} abdomen contains separate {{slow and}} fast neuromuscular systems that mediate posture and escape tailflips (Kennedy & Takeda, 1965 a, b). It was recently demonstrated that impulses in the medial and lateral giant axons, which trigger escape responses, also inhibit both spontaneous and evoked {{activity in the}} tonic, or slow, flexor <b>motor</b> <b>neurones</b> (Kuwada & Wine, 1979). The evidence for inhibition was based exclusively on extracellular recordings of the spontaneously active tonic flexor <b>motor</b> <b>neurones.</b> We have now used intracellular recordings from the somata and neuropilar processes of the tonic flexor <b>motor</b> <b>neurones</b> to clarify the nature of inhibi-tion. Our main findings are that synaptic potentials (from unknown sources) appear to underlie the spontaneous activity of the tonic flexor <b>motor</b> <b>neurones,</b> and that im-pulses in the giant axons cause large-amplitude, hyperpolarizing IPSPs in the tonic flexor <b>motor</b> <b>neurones</b> and EPSPs or spikes in the peripheral inhibitor.

40|$|A rampwise {{stretch of}} the femoral chordotonal organ is known often to elicit a {{response}} in the active decerebrate stick insect that is termed an 'active reaction', and which can be considered to represent part of the step cycle. During {{the first part of}} the response, the flexor <b>motor</b> <b>neurones</b> are excited and the excitatory extensor <b>motor</b> <b>neurones</b> are inhibited, forming a positive feedback loop. When the chordotonal organ reaches a position corresponding to a flexed femur-tibia joint, the flexor <b>motor</b> <b>neurones</b> are inhibited and the extensor <b>motor</b> <b>neurones</b> are excited. In this study, extracellular and intracellular recordings showed that, during an active reaction, the excitation of the retractor unguis <b>motor</b> <b>neurones</b> usually paralleled that of the flexor <b>motor</b> <b>neurones,</b> whereas the protractor coxae <b>motor</b> <b>neurones</b> were less strongly coupled to this system. The first part of the active reaction occurred only at low stimulus velocities. At high stimulus velocities negative feedback was present. The first part therefore represents some kind of velocity-control-system for active flexions. Electrical stimulation of the nerve containing the axons of trochanteral campaniform sensilla and of the hairfield trHP decreased the likelihood that concurrent chordotonal organ stimulation would elicit an active reaction. Further-more, most of the active reactions that occurred under these stimulus conditions involved only the flexor tibiae muscle. The results indicate that: the walking pattern generator is composed of subunits that are only loosely coupled centrally; it probably does not include a central pattern generator; and generation of an active reaction is a two-step process...|$|R

40|$|Whether sensory {{information}} from the inferior alveolar nerve is mediated by different types of interneurones in the supratrigeminal area (Su 5) and whether different types of these interneurones have different inhibitory actions on jaw-closing <b>motor</b> <b>neurones</b> of the trigeminal motor nucleus was investigated. The intracellular responses of periodontal afferents in the mesencephalic trigeminal nucleus, Su 5 interneurones and jaw-closing <b>motor</b> <b>neurones</b> were studied in response to graded, single-shock stimulation of the ipsilateral inferior alveolar nerve. It {{was found that the}} inhibitory action of afferent inflow from the inferior alveolar nerve to jaw-closing <b>motor</b> <b>neurones</b> is possibly mediated by two types of Su 5 interneurones (T-I and T-II). These Su 5 neurones were discriminated {{on the basis of their}} firing characteristics. The findings also indicated that: (1) T-I neurones are responsible for short-latency, low-threshold inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs) observed in the trigeminal motor nucleus neurones; (2) T-II interneurones mainly contribute to the amplitude of these IPSPs at higher stimulus strengths; (3) the late part of plateau IPSPs in the jaw-closing <b>motor</b> <b>neurones</b> is induced by a characteristic firing of T-II neurones. It was also shown that afferent inflow from the inferior alveolar nerve, probably mediated by collaterals of T-I and T-II interneurones, also evokes IPSPs in neurones of the intermediate subnucleus of the facial motor nucleus. The characteristics of these IPSPs resemble those of the IPSPs recorded in the jaw-closing <b>motor</b> <b>neurones...</b>|$|R

40|$|Behavioural and neurophysiological {{techniques}} {{were used to}} study the neuronal control of shell turning during egg-laying in the pond snail Lymnaea stagnalis. Egg-laying consists of three phases: resting, turning and oviposition, and is triggered by an electrical discharge {{in a group of}} neuroendocrine cells, the caudodorsal cells. During the discharge, several peptides encoded on two CDCH genes are known to be released. Behavioural experiments in which different combinations of nerves were lesioned indicated that the inferior cervical nerves are necessary for turning behaviour to occur. The right inferior cervical nerve innervates the right dorsal longitudinal muscle and contains axons of neurones that are active just prior to, and during, shell movements in freely behaving animals. These axons are probably the axons of <b>motor</b> <b>neurones.</b> The <b>motor</b> <b>neurones</b> of the dorsal longitudinal muscle were identified in the cerebral A and pedal N clusters. We have demonstrated that there is a correlation between the state of excitability of the caudodorsal cells and the electrical activity of the pedal N <b>motor</b> <b>neurones.</b> Our results indicate that the pedal N <b>motor</b> <b>neurones</b> are involved in executing the turning phase during egg-laying...|$|R

40|$|Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is characterised by motor {{neuronal}} degeneration leading to muscular wasting and eventually death. 5 % of ALS cases are familial (F ALS) and 20 % {{of these are}} due to mutations in the gene encoding for copperlzinc superoxide dismutase-l (SOD 1). Mice overexpressing human mutant SODl develop a neurodegenerative condition closely resembling ALS. Beyond increasing age, male gender and family history of ALS, {{there are no other}} validated risk factors. However, recently, association between intense physical activity and ALS has been proposed by epidemiological studies. In {{the first part of this}} thesis, the response of <b>motor</b> <b>neurones</b> to the stress caused by the presence of the mutant human SOD 1 in the mouse model of F ALS was investigated. In the second part, the genes and pathways involved in the physiological response to the stress caused by voluntary exercise in <b>motor</b> <b>neurones</b> were identified. The final section of this thesis investigated whether single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in key genes involved in the response to exercise were associated with the pathophysiology of ALS. Microarray analysis of <b>motor</b> <b>neurones</b> isolated using laser capture microdissection from the lumbar spinal cord of G 93 A-SOD 1 mice and their littermates at different stages of disease has identified several potential targets for drug therapy, especially at the presymptomatic stage. Applying the same techniques, the transcription profile of <b>motor</b> <b>neurones</b> isolated from the lumbar spinal cord of exercised and sedentary mice was analysed as well as gastrocnemius muscles. <b>Motor</b> <b>neurones</b> showed transcriptional changes involved in neurotrophic factor signalling, electrophysiological changes and synaptic reorganization, while gastrocnemius muscle revealed mcreases in transcripts responsible for neovascularisation and myogenesis. The comparison between the two studies reveals that, although the pathways activated in <b>motor</b> <b>neurones</b> in response to the two stresses are different, the physiological response to exercise requires production of neurotrophic factors and activation of pathways that have been shown to be implicated in the pathology of ALS. In particular, VEGF receptor 2 (KDR) was upregulated in response to exercise. In order to investigate the hypothesis that genetic susceptibility could be implicated in a failure to mount the physiological response to exercise, non-synonymous SNPs in KDR were screened in sporadic ALS cases and controls. Although the screening did not reveal any positive associations, the present study provides additional candidate genes that might confer a genetic susceptibility to ALS in response to intense physical activity.

40|$|Loss {{of nuclear}} TDP- 43 characterizes {{sporadic}} and most familial forms of {{amyotrophic lateral sclerosis}} (ALS). TDP- 43 (encoded by TARDBP) has multiple roles in RNA processing. We aimed to determine whether (1) RNA splicing dysregulation is present in lower <b>motor</b> <b>neurones</b> in ALS and in a motor neurone-like cell model; and (2) TARDBP mutations (mtTARDBP) are associated with aberrant RNA splicing using patient-derived fibroblasts. Affymetrix exon arrays were used to study mRNA expression and splicing in lower <b>motor</b> <b>neurones</b> obtained by laser capture microdissection of autopsy tissue from individuals with sporadic ALS and TDP- 43 proteinopathy. Findings were confirmed by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and in NSC 34 motor neuronal cells following shRNA-mediated TDP- 43 depletion. Exon arrays and immunohistochemistry were used to study mRNA splicing and TDP- 43 expression in fibroblasts from patients with mtTARDBP-associated, sporadic and mutant SOD 1 -associated ALS. We found altered expression of spliceosome components in <b>motor</b> <b>neurones</b> and widespread aberrations of mRNA splicing that specifically affected genes involved in ribonucleotide binding. This was confirmed in TDP- 43 -depleted NSC 34 cells. Fibroblasts with mtTARDBP showed loss of nuclear TDP- 43 protein and demonstrated similar changes in splicing and gene expression, which were not present in fibroblasts from patients with sporadic or SOD 1 -related ALS. Loss of nuclear TDP- 43 is associated with RNA processing abnormalities in ALS <b>motor</b> <b>neurones,</b> patient-derived cells with mtTARDBP, and following artificial TDP- 43 depletion, suggesting that splicing dysregulation directly contributes to disease pathogenesis.

40|$|The {{elimination}} of polyneuronal innervation from neonatal rat soleus muscle was studied {{by comparing the}} extent of synapse loss by <b>motor</b> <b>neurones</b> emerging through {{each of the two}} spinal nerves (L 4 and L 5) supplying the muscle. The fraction of muscle fibres receiving innervation from the L 4 spinal nerve declined from an average of 75 % in 6 -day-old animals (when all fibres are polyneuronally innervated) to 18 % in animals older than 16 days (when almost all muscle fibres are singly innervated). By comparison innervation by the L 5 spinal nerve declined from 99 % of the fibres at 6 days to 83 % of the fibres after 16 days. As a result of synapse elimination there is a greater reduction in the innervation of the muscle by the L 4 nerve. The difference in loss of muscle fibres innervated by L 4 vs. L 5 was not, however, due to a greater degree of synapse {{elimination of}} L 4 motor nerve terminals. As shown by measurements of the sizes of motor units, both L 4 and L 5 have units which on average are about four to five times larger at 6 days than at the conclusion of synapse elimination. Thus L 4 and L 5 <b>motor</b> <b>neurones</b> undergo approximately the same degree of size reduction. The apparently disproportionate loss of muscle innervation by the L 4 nerve is {{explained by the fact that}} L 4 usually contains only a small portion of the total of soleus <b>motor</b> <b>neurones.</b> I therefore conclude that there is no selective loss of synapses based on spinal origin of <b>motor</b> <b>neurones...</b>|$|R
