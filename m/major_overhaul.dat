5|$|Schwalbe {{spent the}} {{majority}} of her career overseas. She served in German East Africa from 1889 to 1893, and during this period she assisted in {{the suppression of the}} Abushiri Revolt.

She initially returned to German East Africa, where she patrolled South African waters to protect German shipping during the Second Boer War. The outbreak of the Boxer Rebellion in China in 1900 prompted the Kaiserliche Marine to send Schwalbe to join the European forces battling the Boxers. Schwalbe spent 1901 and 1902 in Chinese waters, blockading the mouth of the Yangtze and suppressing local unrest. The ship returned to Germany in 1903 for another <b>major</b> <b>overhaul</b> and another stint in reserve. She ended her career as a barracks ship during World War I, and as a target ship in 1918.

5|$|During the mid 1990s, Ramiz Sadiku was docked for a <b>major</b> <b>overhaul</b> and reconstruction.

The boat's superstructure, propulsion, sensors and weapon systems were dismantled, after which the new owner moved the boat to an underground naval dock on the Luštica peninsula. The boat remained there for several years, before its deteriorating condition caused it to sink inside the dock.

Kerrigan's fingers are stated to now contain extendible claws.
