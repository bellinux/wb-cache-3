25|$|Power {{handling}} {{is related}} to the heat resistance of the wire insulation, adhesive, and bobbin material, and may be influenced by the coil's position within the <b>magnetic</b> <b>gap.</b> The majority of loudspeakers use 'overhung' voice coils, with windings that are taller than the height of the <b>magnetic</b> <b>gap.</b> In this topology, a portion of the coil remains within the gap at all times. The power handling is limited by the amount of heat that can be tolerated, and the amount that can be removed from the voice coil. Some magnet designs include aluminium heat-sink rings above and below the magnet gap, to improve conduction cooling, significantly improving power handling. If all other conditions remain constant, the area of the voice coil windings is proportional to the power handling of the coil. Thus a 100mm diameter voice coil, with a 12mm winding height has similar power handling to a 50mm diameter voice coil with a 24mm winding height.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} type of driver, {{commonly}} called a dynamic loudspeaker, uses a lightweight diaphragm, or cone, connected to a rigid basket, or frame, via a flexible suspension, commonly called a spider, that constrains a voice coil to move axially through a cylindrical <b>magnetic</b> <b>gap.</b> When an electrical signal is applied to the voice coil, a magnetic field is created by the electric current in the voice coil, making it a variable electromagnet. The coil and the driver's magnetic system interact, generating a mechanical force that causes the coil (and thus, the attached cone) to move back and forth, accelerating and reproducing sound {{under the control of the}} applied electrical signal coming from the amplifier. The following is a description of the individual components of this type of loudspeaker.|$|E
25|$|Because {{the moving}} parts of the speaker must be of low mass (to {{accurately}} reproduce high-frequency sounds without being damped too much by inertia), voice coils are usually made as light weight as possible, making them delicate. Passing too much power through the coil can cause it to overheat (see ohmic heating). Voice coils wound with flattened wire, called ribbon-wire, provide a higher packing density in the <b>magnetic</b> <b>gap</b> than coils with round wire. Some coils are made with surface-sealed bobbin and collar materials so they may be immersed in a ferrofluid which assists in cooling the coil, by conducting heat away from the coil and into the magnet structure. Excessive input power at low frequencies can cause the coil to move beyond its normal limits, causing knocking and distortion.|$|E

25|$|The image above shows {{two ways}} in which the voice coil is {{immersed}} in the magnetic field. The most common method is the overhung design where the height of the voice coil is greater than the <b>magnetic</b> <b>gap's</b> height. The underhung design which is used mostly in high-end speakers has the coil's height smaller than the gap's. The differences, advantages and disadvantages of both methods are listed below.|$|R

2500|$|In 'underhung' {{voice coil}} designs (see below), the coil is {{shorter than the}} <b>magnetic</b> <b>gap,</b> a {{topology}} that provides consistent electromotive force over a limited range of motion, known as Xmax. If the coil is overdriven it may leave the gap, generating significant distortion and losing the heat-sinking benefit of the steel, heating rapidly.|$|E
2500|$|The {{suspension}} system keeps the coil {{centered in the}} gap and provides a restoring (centering) force that returns the cone to a neutral position after moving. A typical {{suspension system}} consists of two parts: the spider, which connects the diaphragm or voice coil to the frame and provides {{the majority of the}} restoring force, and the surround, which helps center the coil/cone assembly and allows free pistonic motion aligned with the <b>magnetic</b> <b>gap.</b> The spider is usually made of a corrugated fabric disk, impregnated with a stiffening resin. The name comes from the shape of early suspensions, which were two concentric rings of Bakelite material, joined by six or eight curved [...] "legs." [...] Variations of this topology included the addition of a felt disc to provide a barrier to particles that might otherwise cause the voice coil to rub. The German firm Rulik still offers drivers with uncommon spiders made of wood.|$|E
2500|$|The wire in a {{voice coil}} is usually made of copper, though aluminum—and, rarely, silver—may be used. [...] The {{advantage}} of aluminum is its light weight, which reduces the moving mass compared to copper. [...] This raises the resonant frequency of the speaker and increases its efficiency. [...] A disadvantage of aluminum {{is that it is}} not easily soldered, and so connections are instead often crimped together and sealed. [...] These connections must be made well or they may fail in an intense environment of mechanical vibration. [...] Voice-coil wire cross sections can be circular, rectangular, or hexagonal, giving varying amounts of wire volume coverage in the <b>magnetic</b> <b>gap</b> space. The coil is oriented co-axially inside the gap; it moves back and forth within a small circular volume (a hole, slot, or groove) in the magnetic structure. The gap establishes a concentrated magnetic field between the two poles of a permanent magnet; the outside of the gap being one pole, and the center post (called the pole piece) being the other. The pole piece and backplate are often a single piece, called the poleplate or yoke.|$|E

2500|$|Aluminium {{was widely}} used in the speaker {{industry}} due to its low cost, ease of bonding, and structural strength. When higher power amplifiers emerged, especially in professional sound, the limitations of aluminium were exposed. It rather efficiently but inconveniently transfers heat from the voice coil into the adhesive bonds of the loudspeaker, thermally degrading or even burning them. [...] Motion of the aluminium bobbin in the <b>magnetic</b> <b>gap</b> creates eddy currents within the material, which further increase the temperature, hindering long-term survival. In 1955 DuPont developed Kapton, a polyimide plastic film which did not suffer from aluminium's deficiencies, so Kapton, and later Kaneka Apical were widely adopted for voice coils. As successful as these dark brown plastic films were for most hi-fi voice coils, they also had some less attractive properties, principally their cost, and an unfortunate tendency to soften when hot. Hisco P450, developed in 1992 to address the softening issue in professional speakers, is a thermoset composite of thin glassfibre cloth, impregnated with polyimide resin, combining the best characteristics of polyimide with the temperature resistance and stiffness of glassfibre. It withstands brutal physical stresses and operating temperatures up to 300°C, while its stiffness helps maintain the speaker's 'cold' frequency response.|$|E
50|$|In a loudspeaker, a {{diaphragm}} (generally, but not exclusively cone shaped) is the thin, semi-rigid membrane {{attached to the}} voice coil, which moves in a <b>magnetic</b> <b>gap,</b> vibrating the diaphragm, and producing sound.

50|$|Ferrofluid is a {{suspension}} of very small (typically 10 nm) iron oxide magnetic particles {{in a very}} low volatility liquid, typically a synthetic oil.

The fluid is typically injected into the <b>magnetic</b> <b>gap</b> and is {{held in place by}} the strong magnetic field. If a tweeter has been subjected to elevated power levels, some thickening of the ferrofluid occurs, as a portion of the carrier liquid evaporates. In extreme cases, this can degrade the sound quality and output level of a tweeter, and the fluid must be removed and new fluid installed.|$|E

The magnetic field pierces the system through the patterned holes only, so that the coupling with the electrons is purely quantum mechanical. The model takes implicitly into account the coupling between the different Bloch bands. The flux-dependent energy structure exhibits a Hofstadter butterfly-type spectrum. Such a structure is repeated indefinitely without distortion with a period of one magnetic flux quantum through a lattice hole. Rectangular deviations from the square lattice are also studied.

40|$|Two strong {{arguments}} {{in favor of}} magnetically driven unconventional superconductivity arise from the coexistence and closeness of superconducting and magnetically ordered phases on the one hand, and from the emergence of magnetic spin-resonance modes at the superconducting transition on the other hand. Combining these two arguments one may ask about the nature of superconducting spin-resonance modes occurring in an antiferromagnetic state. This problem can be studied in underdoped BaFe 2 As 2, for which the local coexistence of large moment antiferromagnetism and superconductivity is well established by local probes. However, polarized neutron scattering experiments are required to identify the nature of the resonance modes. In the normal state of Co underdoped BaFe 2 As 2 the antiferromagnetic order results in broad <b>magnetic</b> <b>gaps</b> opening in all three spin directions that are reminiscent of the magnetic response in the parent compound. In the superconducting state two distinct anisotropic resonance excitations emerge, but in contrast to numerous studies on optimum and over-doped BaFe 2 As 2 there is no isotropic resonance excitation.

50|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 1950s, when work on controlled fusion reactions had just started at Kurchatov, solving the problem of charge exchange for the confinement of a plasma in a magnetic system was crucial.

50|$|In operation, {{a signal}} is {{delivered}} to the voice coil by means of electrical wires, from the amplifier through speaker cable, then through flexible tinsel wire to the moving coil.

However, if the heads are mounted at slightly different angles (such as ±7 degrees in VHS), destructive interference will occur at high frequencies when reading data recorded in the cross-talking channel but not in the channel that is intended to be read. At low frequencies relative to the maximum allowed by the head gap, however, this technique is ineffective.
