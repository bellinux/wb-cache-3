5|$|In 1927, Canadian Davidson Black {{identified}} two fossilized teeth {{he had found}} in Zhoukoudian near Beijing as belonging to an ancient human, and named his specimen Sinanthropus pekinensis, now better known as Peking Man. In December 1929, {{the first of several}} skullcaps was found on the same site, and it appeared similar but slightly larger than Java Man. Franz Weidenreich, who replaced Black in China after the latter's death in 1933, argued that Sinanthropus was also a transitional fossil between apes and humans, and was in fact so similar to Java's Pithecanthropus that they should both belong to the family Hominidae. Eug√®ne Dubois categorically refused to entertain this possibility, dismissing Peking <b>Man</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> kind of Neanderthal, closer to humans than the Pithecanthropus, and insisting that Pithecanthropus belonged to its own family, the Pithecanthropoidae.|$|E
5|$|My {{philosophy}} {{about race}} relations is that I'm {{the man and}} I'll set my own patterns in life. I don't rely on anyone else's opinions.

Some people feel that because you are black {{you will never be}} treated fairly, and that you should voice your opinions, be militant about them. I don't feel this way. You can't convince a fool against his will...If a man doesn't like me because I'm black, that's fine. I'll just go elsewhere, but I'm not going to let him change my life.|$|E

5|$|A folk tale from Barra {{tells of}} a lonely kelpie that {{transforms}} itself into a handsome young man to woo a pretty young girl it was determined to take for its wife. But the girl recognises the young <b>man</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> kelpie and removes his silver necklace (his bridle) while he sleeps. The kelpie immediately reverts to its equine form, and the girl takes it home to her father's farm, where it is put {{to work for a}} year. At the end of that time the girl rides the kelpie to consult a wise man, who tells her to return the silver necklace. Once again transformed into the handsome young man she had first met the wise man asks the kelpie whether if given the choice it would choose to be a kelpie or a mortal. The kelpie in turn asks the girl whether, if he were a man, she would agree to be his wife. She confirms that she would, after which the kelpie chooses to become a mortal man, and the pair are married.|$|E
5|$|After {{spending}} {{two months}} in Batna with Ehnni, the French ordered her to leave North Africa without explanation; as an immigrant, {{she had no choice}} but to comply. Ehnni requested permission from his military superiors to marry Eberhardt (which would have enabled her to stay), but his request was denied. She traveled to France in early May 1901, staying with Augustin and his wife and daughter in Marseille. In mid-June she was summoned back to Constantine to give evidence at the trial of her attacker, who maintained his statement that God had ordered him to kill Eberhardt, though expressed remorse towards her. Eberhardt said that she bore no grudge against Abdallah, forgave him, and hoped that he would not be punished. Abdallah received life imprisonment although the prosecutor had asked for the death penalty. When the trial ended, Eberhardt was again ordered to leave the country. She returned to live with Augustin, working with him (disguised as a <b>man)</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> dock labourer. Eberhardt and Augustin's family lived in appalling poverty. Eberhardt's health deteriorated, and she repeatedly suffered from fevers. She attempted suicide while in Marseille, one of several unsuccessful attempts she would make over the course of her life. Eberhardt continued to write during this time, working on several projects including her novel Trimardeur.|$|E

5|$|In 1707, Zahir was {{involved}} in a brawl in Tiberias in which he killed a <b>man.</b> <b>As</b> <b>a</b> result, Sa'd opted to move the family to Arraba after being offered safe haven there by the Bani Saqr tribe. In Arraba, Zahir received a degree of formal education from a certain Muslim scholar, Abd al-Qadir al-Hifnawi. During his youth, Zahir also learned how to hunt and fight. When the village of Bi'ina was attacked by forces dispatched by the governor of Sidon Eyalet sometime between 1713 and 1718, Zahir {{played an important role in}} defending the village and managed to evade the governor's troops. According to chroniclers of the time, this event, along with Zahir's moderation, turned Zahir into a folk hero in the area. His martial talents gained him further respect among the local peasantry throughout the 1720s.|$|E

Smythe remained in Europe after the war, found the gold {{with the help of a}} mountain guide, and killed him in order to keep it for himself.

Fire engine companies responded, but some firefighters were sympathetic to the rioters because they had also been drafted on Saturday. Later in the afternoon, authorities shot and killed a <b>man</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> crowd attacked the armory at Second Avenue and 21st Street.

5|$|Stone and Blackwell {{developed}} a private agreement aimed at preserving and protecting Stone‚Äôs financial independence and personal liberty. In monetary matters, {{they agreed that}} the marriage be like a business partnership, with the partners being ‚Äújoint proprietors of everything except the results of previous labors.‚Äù Neither would have claim to lands belonging to the other, nor any obligation for the other‚Äôs costs of holding them. While married and living together they would share earnings, but if they should separate, they would relinquish claim to the other‚Äôs subsequent earnings. Each would {{have the right to}} will their property to whomever they pleased unless they had children. Over Blackwell‚Äôs objections, Stone refused to be supported and insisted on paying half of their mutual expenses. In addition to financial independence, Stone and Blackwell agreed that each would enjoy personal independence and autonomy: ‚ÄúNeither partner shall attempt to fix the residence, employment, or habits of the other, nor shall either partner feel bound to live together any longer than is agreeable to both.‚Äù During their discussion of marriage, Stone had given Blackwell a copy of Henry C. Wright‚Äôs book Marriage and Parentage; Or, The Reproductive Element in <b>Man,</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> Means to His Elevation and Happiness, and asked him to accept its principles as what she considered the relationship between husband and wife should be. Wright proposed that because women bore the results of sexual intercourse, wives should govern a couple‚Äôs marital relations. In accordance with that view, Blackwell agreed that Stone would choose ‚Äúwhen, where and how often‚Äù she would ‚Äúbecome a mother.‚Äù In addition to this private agreement, Blackwell drew up a protest of laws, rules, and customs that conferred superior rights on husbands and, as part of the wedding ceremony, pledged never to avail himself of those laws.|$|E
