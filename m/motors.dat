Some types of single-phase <b>motors</b> or synchronous <b>motors</b> advantageous in some situations can be used, but three-phase induction <b>motors</b> are generally preferred as the most economical motor choice. <b>Motors</b> that are designed for fixed-speed operation are often used.

40|$|Objective. To {{investigate}} {{the relationship between}} changes of cortical hand <b>motor</b> representation and <b>motor</b> recovery of the affected hand in subacute stroke. Methods. 17 patients with <b>motor</b> impairment of the affected hand were enrolled in an in-patient neurological rehabilitation program. Hand <b>motor</b> function tests (Wolf <b>Motor</b> Function Test, Action Research Arm Test) and neurophysiological evaluations (resting <b>motor</b> threshold, <b>motor</b> evoked potentials, <b>motor</b> map area size, <b>motor</b> map area volume, and <b>motor</b> map area location) were obtained from both hands and hemispheres at baseline and two, four, and six weeks of in-patient rehabilitation. Results. There was {{a wide spectrum of}} hand <b>motor</b> impairment at baseline and hand <b>motor</b> recovery over time. Hand <b>motor</b> function and recovery correlated significantly with (i) reduction of cortical excitability, (ii) reduction in size and volume of cortical hand <b>motor</b> representation, and (iii) a medial and anterior shift of the center of gravity of cortical hand <b>motor</b> representation within the contralesional hemisphere. Conclusion. Recovery of <b>motor</b> function of the affected hand after stroke is accompanied by definite changes in excitability, size, volume, and location of hand <b>motor</b> representation over the contralesional primary <b>motor</b> cortex. These measures may serve as surrogate markers for the outcome of hand <b>motor</b> rehabilitation after stroke...|$|R

30|$|<b>Motor</b> {{primitives}} {{are very}} important, {{given that the}} UAVs fly by selecting and performing <b>motor</b> primitives repeatedly. <b>Motor</b> primitives decide {{the quality of the}} UAVs. Therefore, the way to define <b>motor</b> primitives is very important. Traditionally, <b>motor</b> primitives are defined by setting the values of <b>motor</b> primitives linearly, which means that UAVs only fly according to the predefined path. However, because of dynamic environments, {{it is very hard to}} perform selected <b>motor</b> primitives completely. The <b>motor</b> primitives that reflect dynamic environments are demanded. In this paper, <b>motor</b> primitives are expressed by graph, which means that graph-based <b>motor</b> primitives are performed completely more than linear <b>motor</b> primitives.

40|$|One {{physiological}} {{method for}} estimating the <b>motor</b> unit number in a muscle depends on dividing into the maximum compound muscle action potential, the potential {{average of the}} first few <b>motor</b> unit potentials excited by a <b>motor</b> nerve stimulus above <b>motor</b> threshold.

The present study has shown that there are single <b>motor</b> units in healthy and abnormal, thenar, and EDB <b>motor</b> unit populations, many times larger than any <b>motor</b> unit excited close to the <b>motor</b> threshold. This finding suggests that previously reported <b>motor</b> unit estimates may not only be an overestimate of the true <b>motor</b> unit population number, but have excluded much larger <b>motor</b> units with higher thresholds. Low <b>motor</b> unit estimates in neuropathies may result from a change in the order of activation of <b>motor</b> units with the appearance of larger <b>motor</b> units, normally of higher threshold among the first few just above the <b>motor</b> threshold...|$|R

50|$|Muscle {{spindles}} {{consist of}} both sensory neurons and <b>motor</b> neurons {{in order to}} provide proprioception and make the appropriate movements via firing of <b>motor</b> neurons. There are three types of lower <b>motor</b> neurons involved in muscle contraction: alpha <b>motor</b> neurons, gamma <b>motor</b> neurons, and beta <b>motor</b> neurons. Alpha <b>motor</b> neurons, the most abundant type, are used in the actual force for muscle contraction and therefore innervate extrafusal muscle fibers (muscle fibers outside of the muscle spindle). Gamma <b>motor</b> neurons, on the other hand, innervate only intrafusal muscle fibers (within the muscle spindle), whereas beta <b>motor</b> neurons, which are present in very low amounts, innervate both intrafusal and extrafusal muscle cells. Beta <b>motor</b> neurons have a conduction velocity greater than that of both other types of lower <b>motor</b> neurons, but there is little currently known about beta <b>motor</b> neurons.

40|$|SummaryThe {{specification}} of spinal interneuron and <b>motor</b> neuron identities initiates within progenitor cells, while <b>motor</b> neuron subtype diversification is regulated by hierarchical transcriptional programs implemented postmitotically. Here {{we find that}} mice lacking GDE 2, a six-transmembrane protein that triggers <b>motor</b> neuron generation, exhibit selective losses of distinct <b>motor</b> neuron subtypes, specifically in defined subsets of limb-innervating <b>motor</b> pools that correlate {{with the loss of}} force-generating alpha <b>motor</b> neurons. Mechanistically, GDE 2 is expressed by postmitotic <b>motor</b> neurons but utilizes extracellular glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterase activity to induce <b>motor</b> neuron generation by inhibiting Notch signaling in neighboring <b>motor</b> neuron progenitors. Thus, neuronal GDE 2 controls <b>motor</b> neuron subtype diversity through a non-cell-autonomous feedback mechanism that directly regulates progenitor cell differentiation, implying that subtype specification initiates within <b>motor</b> neuron progenitor populations prior to their differentiation into postmitotic <b>motor</b> neurons...|$|R
