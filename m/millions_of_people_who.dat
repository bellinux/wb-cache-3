Moreover, the regulation narrowly focuses on the Government's substantial interest in maintaining the parks {{in the heart of the}} Capital in an attractive and intact condition, readily available to the <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> wish to see and enjoy them by their presence.
