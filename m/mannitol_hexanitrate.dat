50|$|<b>Mannitol</b> <b>hexanitrate</b> is a {{secondary}} explosive {{formed by the}} nitration of mannitol, a sugar alcohol. The product is used in medicine as a vasodilator and as an explosive in blasting caps. Its sensitivity is high, particularly at high temperatures (> 75 °C) where it is slightly more sensitive than nitroglycerine.|$|E
50|$|<b>Mannitol</b> <b>hexanitrate</b> is a {{powerful}} explosive. Physically, it is a powdery solid at normal temperature ranges, with density of 1.73 g/cm3. The chemical name is hexanitromannitol {{and it is also}} known as nitromannite, MHN, and nitromannitol, and by the trademarks Nitranitol and Mannitrin. It is more stable than nitroglycerin, and it is used in detonators.|$|E
5000|$|Home Workshop Explosives details how the {{underground}} chemist can easily manufacture explosives. It describes manufacture of nitroglycerin {{as well as}} syntheses for RDX, ammonium nitrate, acetone peroxide blasting caps, nitroglycol, <b>mannitol</b> <b>hexanitrate</b> or nitromannitol, and PETN. It also has {{information on how to}} purify glycerin, how to synthesize nitric acid with minimal equipment, and how to make a fuel-air explosive (commonly known as an FAE). One reviewer of Home Workshop Explosives (David Harber, author of Guerrilla's Arsenal) notes that although the chemistry is solid, the chapter on detonation systems [...] "borders on insanity." ...|$|E
40|$|Various nitrate esters, such as {{glycerol}} trinitrate, erythritol tetranitrate, and <b>mannitol</b> <b>hexanitrate,</b> {{have for}} many years {{been used in the}} treatment of hyper-tension, but the exact mechanism of their action has not been well defined. Leech (1) believed that the nitrite ion found in the blood after ingestion of or-ganic nitrates was responsible for the pharmacological response. The basic action of the nitrite ion in the body is the lowering of tone and the relaxation of arterial muscles, producing a prompt fall in blood pressure. Crandall et al. (2) observed that glycerol trinitrate disappears from the blood very rapidly following intravenous administration to dogs, and that nitrite could be detected qualita-tively. Hay (3) called attention to the similarity in action between glycerol trinitrate and sodium nitrite. He demonstrated that alkali converted about two-thirds of the nitrogen of glycerol trinitrate to inorganic nitrite, and that a faint trace of nitrite appears after the incubation of glycerol trinitrate with blood. The work of Herrman et a!. (4) showed a striking parallelism between the rate of alkalin...|$|E
40|$|The {{biotransformation}} of glycerol thnitrate (Gm), isosorbide dm 1 -trate (ISD), {{pentaerythritol tetranitrate}} (PETN), erythrftol tetranftrate (Em), and <b>mannitol</b> <b>hexanitrate</b> (MHN) by extracts from human liver, small Intestine mucosa, kidney, and blood serum was investigated. The glutathione-dependent organic nitrate ester reductase activfty of the Intestinal mucosa was 21, 4, 4, and 2 {{times higher than}} the liver activity for ISO, PETh, GTh, and ETh, respectively. The liver enzymatic activity for MHN was 35 % higherthan the intestinal activity and 56 % higher than kidney enzyme activity. The order of increasing enzymatic rates was: ISO = PETh < GTh < ETh < MHN in the Intestinal mucosa; ISO < PETN < GTh < ETh < MHN in the Iiver and ISO < PETh = GTh < ETN < MHN in the kidney. Human serum also metabolized these organic nitrates at lower rates than the studied organs. Thus, the serum specific activities were for MHN, /o for ETh, /o for GIN, #{ 188 }. for ISO, and ‘/ooo for PETN of the activity presen...|$|E
40|$|The more {{numerous}} the remedies for a disease {{the less likely}} that any will prove consistently helpful. Of the many drugs recommended for hyperpiesia (essential hypertension) {{there is no agreement}} on the best to employ, and none has gained any outstanding reputation. There seems to be no authoritative statement on the comparative value of these remedies, and individual drugs have been praised without controlled clinical observations. The urge for trying new remedies in hyperpiesia is prompted by the common incidence of a con-dition which produces bizarre symptoms and determines many complications. Although for this reason treatment is a matter of great concern, it {{is not likely to be}} very successful while the cause remains unknown. This paper deals primarily with the effects of certain drugs on the blood pressure in patients with hyperpiesia, and also records our observations on the influence of changes in the blood pressure on the subjective symptoms. We are not concerned here with the advisability of reducing blood pressure in hyperpiesia, but our findings during short periods of a lowered pressure have convinced us that the presence of symptoms has little or no relation to the level of the blood pressure. The opportunity, however, of observing the results of a greatly lowered blood pressure in hyperpiesia over a long period has only been gained through the onset of cardiac infarction or heart failure, when the appearance of newer symptoms might mask the direct effects of the lowered pressure. METHOD OF OBSERVATION We submitted the following preparations to clinical trial: sodium nitrite, glyceryl trinitrate, erythrol tetranitrate, <b>mannitol</b> <b>hexanitrate,</b> bismuth sub-nitrate, potassium iodide, iodine, potassium bromide, sodium luminal, chloral hydrate, papaverine sulphate, euphyllin, diuretin, theominal, doryl, pacyl, hypotan, calcium chloride, atropine, potassium thiocyanate, benzyl benzoate...|$|E
