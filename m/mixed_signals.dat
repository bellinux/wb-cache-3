5|$|Drnovšek's {{announcement}} {{that he would}} not run for president again led to expectations that the Social Democrats (SD) would nominate their leader Borut Pahor and indeed Pahor confirmed that he was ready to run for the office. The Social Democrats had become the most popular party in opinion polls and were considered the likely winners at the next general election in 2008; opinion polls indicated that Pahor would easily win the presidential election. However, after months of <b>mixed</b> <b>signals,</b> Pahor finally announced that he would instead concentrate on the general election and would not run for the mostly ceremonial office of the president.|$|E
5|$|In {{terms of}} the visual dimension, {{distinction}} between aggressive mimicry and camouflage is not always clear. Authors such as Wickler have emphasized {{the significance of the}} signal to its receiver as delineating mimicry from camouflage. However, {{it is not easy to}} assess how 'significant' a signal may be for the dupe, and the distinction between the two can thus be rather fuzzy. <b>Mixed</b> <b>signals</b> may also be employed. Aggressive mimics often have a specific part of the body sending a deceptive signal, with the rest being hidden or camouflaged.|$|E
5|$|Anjaana Anjaani {{film was}} {{initially}} slated to release on 24 September 2010. It was postponed by one week, {{just four days}} before the expected date because this would coincide with the controversial Ayodhya dispute verdict, which many anticipated would be disputed and cause chaos in the country. Trade experts were against postponing the film, and questioned Nadiadwala's decision, as the government had already taken precautionary measures with the Commonwealth Games around the corner. They also felt that the postponement would send <b>mixed</b> <b>signals</b> and confuse viewers as the promotional campaign centred around the 25 September release. Additionally, the film would lose the advantage of being the only new release. Changing the release date would mean Anjaana Anjaani would clash with the science fiction film Enthiran, which might affect the film's box-office performance. Still, the film was postponed to 1 October 2010. Later, the Ayodhya verdict was itself postponed to three days before the film's new release date. Industry insiders started speculating again about the film's release being postponed by another week, causing rumours to spread in the media. However, Sajid Nadiadwla confirmed that the news was false and the film was releasing on 1 October 2010.|$|E

40|$|Abstract- <b>Mix</b> <b>signal</b> {{processing}} {{application is}} becoming increasingly important today. In order to make undergraduate students familiar with <b>mix</b> <b>signal</b> processor, we developed a series hands-on <b>mixed</b> <b>signal</b> processing courses with MSP 430 series processor of Texas Instrument (TI). The course first introduce programming skills of mixed-signal processing of microprocessors. The self-developed MSP 430 teaching kits and integrated development tools cooperates with the presented courses to enable the students {{to be familiar with}} the operations of MSP 430 processor. Then a project-oriented course is required to make students have hands-on capability. Finally, the activities and results show that the presented course is feasible and goal to students.

40|$|Mixed-signal {{designs are}} {{becoming}} more and more complex every day. In order to adapt to the new market requirements, a formal process for design and verification of <b>mixed</b> <b>signal</b> systems i. e. top-down design and bottom-up verification methodology is required. This methodology has already been established for digital design. The goal of this research is to propose a new design methodology for <b>mixed</b> <b>signal</b> systems. In the first two chapters of this thesis, the need for a <b>mixed</b> <b>signal</b> design flow based on top-down design methodology will be discussed. The proposed design flow is based on behavioral modeling of the <b>mixed</b> <b>signal</b> system using one of the <b>mixed</b> <b>signal</b> behavioral modeling languages. These models can be used for design and verification through different steps of the design from system level modeling to final physical design. The other advantage of the proposed flow is analog and digital co-design. In the remaining chapters of this thesis, the proposed design flow was verified by designing an 800 MHz <b>mixed</b> <b>signal</b> PLL. The PLL uses a charge pump phase frequency detector, a single capacitor loop filter, and a feed forward error correction architecture using an active damping control circuit instead of passive resistor in loop filter. The design was done in 0. 18 - µ m CMOS process technology...|$|R

Miller turned to the Stanley H. Ruttenberg Company for negotiating advice and assistance at the bargaining table. This caused confusion among UMWA negotiators as to strategy, tactics and the content of proposals, and caused <b>mixed</b> <b>signals</b> to be sent by the bargaining committee, Miller and other UMWA officers. The lack of organizational competence and flow of mixed messages helped prolong the labor dispute.|$|E
25|$|Radio {{transmitters}} work {{by mixing}} a radio frequency (RF) signal {{of a specific}} frequency, the carrier wave, with the signal to be broadcast. The result {{is a set of}} frequencies with a strong peak signal at the carrier frequency, and smaller signals from the carrier frequency plus the maximum frequency of the signal, and the carrier frequency minus the maximum frequency of the signal. That is, the resulting signal has a spectrum with twice the bandwidth of the original input signal. In conventional AM radio, this signal is then sent to the radio frequency amplifier, and then to the broadcast antenna. Due {{to the nature of the}} amplification process, the quality of the resulting signal can be defined by the difference between the maximum and minimum signal energy. Normally the maximum signal energy will be the carrier itself, perhaps twice as powerful as the <b>mixed</b> <b>signals.</b>|$|E
