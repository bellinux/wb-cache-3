5|$|Fibonacci {{search is}} a method similar to binary search that {{successively}} shortens the interval in which the <b>maximum</b> of a unimodal function lies. Given a finite interval, a unimodal function, and the <b>maximum</b> length of the resulting interval, Fibonacci search finds a Fibonacci number such that if the interval is divided equally into that many subintervals, the subintervals would be shorter than the <b>maximum</b> length. After dividing the interval, it eliminates the subintervals in which the <b>maximum</b> cannot lie until one or more contiguous subintervals remain.|$|E

40|$|This {{investigation}} seeks {{a better}} understanding of the assorted mechanisms controlling the global distribution of precipitation diurnal variability based on the use of Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) microwave radiometer and radar data. The horizontal distributions of precipitation's diurnal cycle are derived from eight years of TRMM Microwave Imager (TMI) and Precipitation Radar (PR) measurements involving three TRMM standard rain rate retrieval algorithms [...] the resultant distributions analyzed at various spatiotemporal scales. The results reveal the prominent and expected late-evening to early-morning (LE-EM) precipitation <b>maxima</b> over oceans and the counterpart prominent and expected mid- to late-afternoon (MLA) <b>maxima</b> over continents. Moreover, and not generally recognized, the results reveal a widespread distribution of secondary <b>maxima</b> occurring over both oceans and continents [...] <b>maxima</b> which generally mirror their counterpart regime's behavior. That is, many ocean regions exhibit clearcut secondary MLA precipitation <b>maxima</b> while many continental regions exhibit just as evident secondary LE-EM <b>maxima.</b> This investigation is the first comprehensive study of these globally prevalent secondary <b>maxima</b> and their widespread nature, a type of study only made possible when the analysis procedure is applied to a high-quality global-scale precipitation dataset. The characteristics of the secondary <b>maxima</b> are mapped and described on global grids using an innovative clock-face format, while a current study to be published at a later date provides physically-based explanations of the seasonal-regional distributions of the secondary <b>maxima.</b> In addition to an "explicit" <b>maxima</b> identification scheme, a "Fourier decomposition" <b>maxima</b> identification scheme is used to examine the amplitude and phase properties of the primary and secondary <b>maxima</b> [...] as well as tertiary and quaternary <b>maxima.</b> Accordingly, the advantages, ambiguities, and pitfalls resulting from use of Fourier harmonic analysis are explained...|$|R
