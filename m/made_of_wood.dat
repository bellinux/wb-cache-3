5|$|In 1873, John Evans, then {{a former}} {{governor}} of the Colorado Territory, constructed a toll road from Evergreen to Morrison via Bear Creek canyon. The early road offered access to various mining and logging resources along the creek. This road had over twenty bridges over Bear Creek, {{most of which were}} <b>made</b> <b>of</b> <b>wood</b> from the surrounding region. By the late 1870s, toll roads were no longer common, and the path's maintenance responsibilities were passed to Jefferson County.|$|E
5|$|In the Period II, the finds {{excavated}} {{revealed that}} people had moved out from pit dwelling to structures built at the ground level.

5|$|Polish {{headquarters}} {{decided to}} man the outer line of defences, the furthest from the densely populated areas.

In case the enemy broke through all three lines of defences, the city centre was also fortified with 30 barricades, embrasures cut through the walls of several buildings and mines hidden beneath major street crossings.|$|E

5|$|After the {{establishment}} of the Jesuit mission in Bohol, Father Juan de Torres, SJ, moved to the community along the Loboc River in late 1596 to establish a second mission station. The first church, <b>made</b> <b>of</b> <b>wood,</b> was built by the people of the area on a site called Calvario, Sawang, near the location of the present-day church. It was dedicated under the patronage of Saint Michael the Archangel. Loboc officially became a Catholic parish in 1602. Due to pirate attacks on Baclayon and the strategic position of Loboc, the Jesuits chose Loboc to become the center of their mission. The Jesuit superior of Bohol later resided in Loboc until the Jesuits' expulsion in 1768. A boarding school for boys, the Seminario de los Indios, was established at Loboc in 1605.|$|E
5|$|Blaise Pascal {{invented the}} {{mechanical}} calculator in 1642; {{it was the}} first operational adding machine. It made use of a gravity-assisted carry mechanism. It was the only operational mechanical calculator in the 17thcentury and the earliest automatic, digital computer. Pascal's calculator was limited by its carry mechanism, which forced its wheels to only turn one way so it could add. To subtract, the operator had to use the Pascal's calculator's complement, which required as many steps as an addition. Giovanni Poleni followed Pascal, building the second functional mechanical calculator in 1709, a calculating clock <b>made</b> <b>of</b> <b>wood</b> that, once setup, could multiply two numbers automatically.|$|E

5|$|Generally, in {{cabinets}} or {{display cases}} that are entirely or partially <b>made</b> <b>of</b> <b>wood,</b> the hydrolysis of acetyl groups in the wood hemicelluloses creates acetic acid. The {{rate at which the}} acetic acid is produced is proportional to the concentration of esters in the wood, the humidity, the temperature, and the overall acidity of the environment. Acidic fumes can also be released from formaldehyde which can occur in wood as a degradation product of lignin. Acidic fumes can also be given off from ubiquitous formaldehyde resins (commonly urea-formaldehyde resins).|$|E
