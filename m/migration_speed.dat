50|$|The {{concentration}} of the gel determines the pore size of the gel which affect the migration of DNA. The resolution of the DNA changes with the percentage {{concentration of}} the gel. Increasing the agarose concentration of a gel reduces the <b>migration</b> <b>speed</b> and improves separation of smaller DNA molecules, while lowering gel concentration permits large DNA molecules to be separated. For a standard agarose gel electrophoresis, a 0.7% gives good separation or resolution of large 5-10kb DNA fragments, while 2% gel gives good resolution for small 0.2-1kb fragments. Up to 3% {{can be used for}} separating very tiny fragments but a vertical polyacrylamide gel would be more appropriate for resolving small fragments. High concentrations gel however requires longer run times (sometimes days) and high percentage gels are often brittle and may not set evenly. High percentage agarose gels should be run with PFGE or FIGE. Low percentage gels (0.1−0.2%) are fragile and may break. 1% gels are common for many applications.|$|E
5000|$|Most protein separations are {{performed}} using a [...] "discontinuous" [...] (or DISC) buffer system that significantly enhances {{the sharpness of}} the bands within the gel. During electrophoresis in a discontinuous gel system, an ion gradient is formed in the early stage of electrophoresis that causes all of the proteins to focus into a single sharp band. The formation of the ion gradient is achieved by choosing a pH value at which the ions of the buffer are only moderately charged compared to the SDS-coated proteins. These conditions provide {{an environment in which}} Kohlrausch's reactions determine the molar conductivity. As a result, SDS-coated proteins are concentrated to several fold in a thin zone of the order of 19 μm within a few minutes. At this stage all proteins migrate at the same <b>migration</b> <b>speed</b> by isotachophoresis. This occurs in a region of the gel that has larger pores so that the gel matrix does not retard the migration during the focusing or [...] "stacking" [...] event. Separation of the proteins by size is achieved in the lower, [...] "resolving" [...] region of the gel. The resolving gel typically has a much smaller pore size, which leads to a sieving effect that now determines the electrophoretic mobility of the proteins. At the same time, the separating part of the gel also has a pH value in which the buffer ions on average carry a greater charge, causing them to [...] "outrun" [...] the SDS-covered proteins and eliminate the ion gradient and thereby the stacking effect.|$|E

5000|$|The SAC {{monitors}} {{the interaction between}} improperly connected kinetochores and spindle microtubules, and is maintained until kinetochores are properly attached to the spindle. During prometaphase, CDC20 and the SAC proteins concentrate at the kinetochores before attachment to the spindle assembly. These proteins keep the SAC activated until they are removed and the correct kinetochore-microtubule attachment is made. Even a single unattached kinetochore can maintain the spindle checkpoint. After attachment of microtubule plus-ends and formation of kinetochore microtubules, MAD1 and MAD2 are depleted from the kinetochore assembly. Another regulator of checkpoint activation is kinetochore tension. When sister kinetochores are properly attached to opposite spindle poles, forces in the mitotic spindle generate tension at the kinetochores. Bi-oriented sister kinetochores stabilize the kinetochore-microtubule assembly whereas weak tension has a destabilizing effect. In response to incorrect kinetochore attachments such as syntelic attachment, where both kinetochores becomes attached to one spindle pole, the weak tension generated destabilizes the incorrect attachment and allows the kinetochore to reattach correctly to the spindle body. During this process, kinetochores that {{are attached to the}} mitotic spindle but that are not under tension trigger the spindle checkpoint. Aurora-B/Ipl1 kinase of the chromosomal passenger complex functions as the tensions sensor in improper kinetochore attachments. It detects and destabilizes incorrect attachments through control of the microtubule-severing KINI kinesin MCAK, the DASH complex, and the Ndc80/Hec1 complex [...] at the microtubule-kinetochore interface. The Aurora-B/Ipl1 kinase is also critical in correcting merotelic attachments, where one kinetochore is simultaneously attached to both spindle poles. Merotelic attachments generate sufficient tension and are not detected by the SAC, and without correction, may result in chromosome mis-segregation due to slow chromatid <b>migration</b> <b>speed.</b> While microtubule attachment is independently required for SAC activation, it is unclear whether tension is an independent regulator of SAC, although it is clear that differing regulatory behaviors arise with tension.|$|E

Light-emitting diode-generated 633 -nm red light (LED-RL) is part of the visible light spectrum that is not known to cause DNA damage and is considered a safe, non-invasive, inexpensive, and portable potential alternative to ultraviolet phototherapy that may change the treatment paradigm of fibrotic skin disease. The goal of our study was to investigate the how reactive oxygen species (ROS) free radicals generated by high fluence LED-RL inhibit the migration of skin fibroblasts, the main cell type involved in skin fibrosis. Fibroblast <b>migration</b> <b>speed</b> is increased in skin fibrosis, and we studied cellular <b>migration</b> <b>speed</b> of cultured human skin fibroblasts as a surrogate measure of high fluence LED-RL effect on fibroblast function. To ascertain the inhibitory role of LED-RL generated ROS on <b>migration</b> <b>speed,</b> we hypothesized that resveratrol, a potent antioxidant, could prevent the photoinhibitory effects of high fluence LED-RL on fibroblast <b>migration</b> <b>speed.</b> High fluence LED-RL generated ROS were measured by flow cytometry analysis using dihydrorhodamine (DHR). For purposes of comparison, we assessed the effects of ROS generated by hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) on fibroblast <b>migration</b> <b>speed</b> and the ability of resveratrol, a well known antioxidant, to prevent LED-RL and H 2 O 2 generated ROS-associated changes in fibroblast <b>migration</b> <b>speed.</b> To determine whether resveratrol could prevent the high fluence LED-RL ROS-mediated photoinhibition of human skin fibroblast migration, treated cells were incubated with resveratrol at concentrations of 0. 0001 % and 0. 001 % for 24 hours, irradiated with high fluences LED-RL of 480, 640, and 800 J/cm 2. High fluence LED-RL increases intracellular fibroblast ROS and decreases fibroblast <b>migration</b> <b>speed.</b> LED-RL at 480, 640 and 800 J/cm 2 increased ROS levels to 132. 8 %, 151. 0 %, and 158. 4 % relative to matched controls, respectively. These LED-RL associated increases in ROS were prevented by pretreating cells with 0. 0001 % or 0. 001 % resveratrol. Next, we quantified the effect of hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) -associated ROS on fibroblast <b>migration</b> <b>speed,</b> and found that while H 2 O 2 -associated ROS significantly decreased relative fibroblast <b>migration</b> <b>speed,</b> pretreatment with 0. 0001 % or 0. 001 % resveratrol significantly prevented the decreases in <b>migration</b> <b>speed.</b> Furthermore, we found that LED-RL at 480, 640 and 800 J/cm 2 decreased fibroblast <b>migration</b> <b>speed</b> to 83. 0 %, 74. 4 %, and 68. 6 % relative to matched controls, respectively. We hypothesized that these decreases in fibroblast <b>migration</b> <b>speed</b> were due to associated increases in ROS generation. Pretreatment with 0. 0001 % and 0. 001 % resveratrol prevented the LED-RL associated decreases in <b>migration</b> <b>speed.</b> High fluence LED-RL increases ROS and is associated with decreased fibroblast <b>migration</b> <b>speed.</b> We provide mechanistic support that the decreased <b>migration</b> <b>speed</b> associated with high fluence LED-RL is mediated by ROS, by demonstrating that resveratrol prevents high fluence LED-RL associated <b>migration</b> <b>speed</b> change.

Upregulation of Mena, {{a member of}} the evolutionarily conserved Ena/VASP family of actin cytoskeletal regulators, promotes metastasis and invasive motility of breast cancer cells in vivo. To complement in vitro studies of Ena/VASP function in fibroblasts, we manipulated levels of Ena, the Drosophila homologue of Mena, in migrating embryonic macrophages (haemocytes). Consistent with data from fibroblasts in vitro, Ena localises to regions of actin dynamics within migrating haemocytes, stimulates lamellipodial dynamics and positively regulates the number and length of filopodia.

40|$|Many {{migrating}} birds divide their journeys into nocturnal flights interspersed by stopovers {{where they}} build up energy reserves (fuel) for subsequent flights. Given {{the difficulty in}} monitoring fuel loads of individual migrants over long distances, theoretical models are often used to interpret observed relations between departure fuel loads (DFLs) and fuel deposition rates (FDRs) {{in the context of}} time-minimised migration. Models applicable to nocturnal migration have hitherto considered only the departure decision, i. e. ignored interim stopover possibilities before fuel loads are depleted. This results in ‘risk-prone’ migratory schedules in terms of choice of stopover. In this study we assess ‘risk-averse’ behaviour, whereby nocturnal migrants minimise migration time by adjusting not only DFLs to experienced and expected FDRs, but also stopping fuel loads (SFLs), below which they stop to refuel at high-quality sites. We developed analytical formulae to solve for maximal risk-prone and risk-averse <b>migration</b> <b>speeds</b> in modelled environments comprised of two stopover qualities (high- and low-quality), and a constant probability of encountering a high-quality site (encounter probability). Risk-aversion was beneficial to <b>migration</b> <b>speeds</b> in over 99 % of the modelled environments, with median ratios of risk-averse to risk-prone <b>migration</b> <b>speeds</b> ranging from 1. 5 to 2. 8. Among modelled environments, this benefit increased with increasing FDRs at high-quality sites, and was highest with low probabilities of encountering high-quality sites. Time-minimising risk-averse DFLs at low-quality sites were minimal in nearly all modelled environments, and whenever encounter probabilities were low, risk-averse SFLs typically indicated that migrants should stop immediately on encountering high-quality sites. Modelled fuel loads in environments with high and low encounter probabilities resembled observed fuel loads of migratory populations with ubiquitous and scarce food availability, respectively. This study demonstrates the benefits of risk-averse exploitation of variable resources, presents a new approach to model time-minimised migration in heterogeneous environments and emphasises the importance of premium stopover sites to nocturnally migrating birds...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{development}} {{and testing of}} a discrete model describing the dynamic process of tissue growth in three-dimensional scaffolds is presented. The model considers populations of cells that execute persistent random walks on the computational grid, collide, and proliferate until they reach confluence. To isolate the effect of population dynamics on tissue growth, the model assumes that nutrient and growth factor concentrations remain constant in space and time. Simulations start either by distributing the seed cells uniformly and randomly throughout the scaffold, or from an initial condition designed to simulate the migration and cell proliferation phase of wound healing. Simulations with uniform seeding show that cell migration enhances tissue growth by counterbalancing the adverse effects of contact inhibition. This beneficial effect, however, diminishes and disappears completely for large <b>migration</b> <b>speeds.</b> By contrast, simulations with the “wound” seeding mode show a continual enhancement of tissue regeneration rates with increasing cell <b>migration</b> <b>speeds.</b> We conclude that cell locomotory parameters and the spatial distribution of seed cells can have profound effects on {{the dynamics of the}} process and, consequently, on the pattern and rates of tissue growth.

40|$|AbstractThe {{migration}} of vascular endothelial cells in vivo {{occurs in a}} fluid dynamic environment due to blood flow, but the role of hemodynamic forces in cell migration is not yet completely understood. Here we investigated the effect of shear stress, the frictional drag of blood flowing over the cell surface, on the <b>migration</b> <b>speed</b> of individual endothelial cells on fibronectin-coated surfaces, {{as well as the}} biochemical and biophysical bases underlying this shear effect. Under static conditions, cell <b>migration</b> <b>speed</b> had a bell-shaped relationship with fibronectin concentration. Shear stress significantly increased the <b>migration</b> <b>speed</b> at all fibronectin concentrations tested and shifted the bell-shaped curve upwards. Shear stress also induced the activation of Rho GTPase and increased the traction force exerted by endothelial cells on the underlying substrate, both at the leading edge and the rear, suggesting that shear stress enhances both the frontal forward-pulling force and tail retraction. The inhibition of a Rho-associated kinase, p 160 ROCK, decreased the traction force and <b>migration</b> <b>speed</b> under both static and shear conditions and eliminated the shear-enhancement of <b>migration</b> <b>speed.</b> Our results indicate that shear stress enhances the <b>migration</b> <b>speed</b> of endothelial cells by modulating the biophysical force of tractions through the biochemical pathway of Rho-p 160 ROCK...|$|E

It is applied to glass eel (Anguilla anguilla) in the Gironde basin (France). <b>Migration</b> <b>speed</b> is estimated using 2 methods: a rough method based on the analysis of seasonal abundance peaks for two métiers and a more precise method of cross-correlation, which compares speeds between several fishing areas. The methods are coherent and lead to mean <b>migration</b> <b>speed</b> ranging from 3 to 4 km/day. We define an index of efficiency of migration using selective tidal stream transport (STST efficiency index) as {{the ratio of the}} observed <b>migration</b> <b>speed</b> to the potential speed (flood tide current speed and swimming speed). For the glass eel in the Gironde basin this index ranges between 0. 15 and 0. 19. The glass eel behavior, which can explain this low value, is reviewed.

40|$|Overall <b>migration</b> <b>speed</b> {{is likely}} to be a trait under {{selection}} pressure in animals migrating annually between habitats for reproduction and survival. A general expression was used for <b>migration</b> <b>speed</b> (V-migr), accounting for energy accumulation and transport, and derive how V-migr scales with body mass for three types of migratory locomotion: running, swimming and flying (powered and soaring flight). <b>Migration</b> <b>speed</b> is predicted to increase with increasing body mass in animals that run (proportional tom(1 / 11)), swim (proportional tom(1 / 24)) and fly by soaring (proportional tom(0. 22)), whereas in animals migrating by powered flight it decreases (proportional tom(- 1 / 4)). How the relative duration of fuel accumulation to that of migratory locomotion scales with body mass is also derived. This proportion should increase in animals that run and fly, but should remain unaffected by body size in swimmers.

From previous simulation studies, the <b>migration</b> <b>speed</b> of post-seismic slip is inversely proportional to dc (Ariyoshi, 2006). If this relation is applicable to VLF, the adequate value of dc for VLF could be roughly estimated by [dc 2 × (simulated ÷ observed migration speed; km/day) = (0.43 × 10 − 3) × (1 ∼ 3 / 2 ∼ 20) ≒ 0.6 ∼ 0.02 × 10 − 3 m]. On the other hand, lower effective normal stress causes drastically faster migration of postseismic slip (Ariyoshi et al., 2007 a). Since the application of κ = 0.1 in this study as described in Section 2 is a rough estimation (Wang and Suyehiro, 1999; Ariyoshi et al., 2007 a), a little lower effective normal stress may also explain the <b>migration</b> <b>speed</b> quantitatively.|$|E

This study, {{the first to use}} small aperture seismic arrays to track tremor, deployed three small aperture seismic arrays along the Cascadia subduction zone during a tremor and slow slip episode in July 2004. The tremor was active during virtually all (up to 99 %) minutes of the analyzed tremor episode using 5 min sample windows. Individual wave phases were tracked across the arrays and used to derive slowness vectors. These were compared with slowness vectors computed from a standard layered Earth model to derive tremor locations. Locations were stable within a volume roughly 250 km 2 in epicenter and 20 km in depth for hours to days before moving to a new volume.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Many avian species soar and glide over land. Evidence {{from large}} birds (m(b) > 0. 9 kg) {{suggests}} that soaring-gliding is considerably cheaper {{in terms of}} energy than flapping flight, and costs about {{two to three times}} the basal metabolic rate (BMR). Yet, soaring-gliding is considered unfavorable for small birds because <b>migration</b> <b>speed</b> in small birds during soaring-gliding is believed to be lower than that of flapping flight. Nevertheless, several small bird species routinely soar and glide. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: To estimate the energetic cost of soaring-gliding flight in small birds, we measured heart beat frequencies of free-ranging migrating European bee-eaters (Merops apiaster, m(b) ∼ 55 g) using radio telemetry, and established the relationship between heart beat frequency and metabolic rate (by indirect calorimetry) in the laboratory. Heart beat frequency during sustained soaring-gliding was 2. 2 to 2. 5 times lower than during flapping flight, but similar to, and not significantly different from, that measured in resting birds. We estimated that soaring-gliding metabolic rate of European bee-eaters is about twice their basal metabolic rate (BMR), which is similar to the value estimated in the black-browed albatross Thalassarche (previously Diomedea) melanophrys, m(b) ∼ 4 kg). We found that soaring-gliding <b>migration</b> <b>speed</b> is not significantly different from flapping <b>migration</b> <b>speed.</b> CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: We found no evidence that soaring-gliding speed is slower than flapping flight in bee-eaters, contradicting earlier estimates that implied a <b>migration</b> <b>speed</b> penalty for using soaring-gliding rather than flapping flight. Moreover, we suggest that small birds soar and glide during migration, breeding, dispersal, and other stages in their annual cycle because it may entail a low energy cost of transport. We propose that the energy cost of soaring-gliding may be proportional to BMR regardless of bird size, as theoretically deduced by earlier studies...|$|E
40|$|Ebb-tidal deltas {{are part}} of tidal inlet systems, and it is {{important}} to understand sediment transport processes and pathways that take place there. Sediment is transported along ebb-tidal deltas as both suspended load and bedload, and bedform migration is one of the processes by which bedload transport can take place. Saw-tooth bars are bedforms that are found regularly on ebb-tidal deltas, but they have not been studied thoroughly yet. The present study shows the characteristics of these bars, like bar height and length. Spatial correlation was used to find their <b>migration</b> <b>speed.</b> It was found that saw-tooth bars are approximately 2 m high and have a wavelength of 500 - 1000 m. Both bar height and <b>migration</b> <b>speed</b> appear to change in a cyclic way. The saw-tooth bars contribute substantially to the total sediment transport on the ebb-tidal delta...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine how integrin adhesion interact with both cytoskeletal elements and ligands to determine cell <b>migration</b> <b>speed.</b> An understanding of these parameters will aid in developing methods to control cell migration to treat diseases such as cancer, to aid wound healing, or to design tissue engineering matrices. A Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell system was constructed to allow us to vary integrin-ligand binding by altering extracellular matrix (ECM) concentration, integrin expression level, and integrin-ligand binding. As these parameters change, cell <b>migration</b> <b>speed</b> remains a constant, biphasic function of cell-substratum adhesiveness. We can regulate cell speed by varying the number and nature of cell-substratum bonds. The mechanism of cell-substratum detachment is also different as cell adhesiveness varies. At low adhesiveness integrin-ECM bonds preferentially dissociate while at high adhesiveness integrin-cytoskeletal linkages fracture and rear retractio...|$|E
40|$|We {{have studied}} the nocturnal flight {{behaviour}} of the common swift (Apus apus L.), {{by the use of}} a tracking radar. Birds were tracked from Lund University in southern Sweden during spring migration, summer roosting flights and autumn <b>migration.</b> Flight <b>speeds</b> were compared with predictions from flight mechanical and optimal migration theories. During spring, flight speeds were predicted to be higher than during both summer and autumn due to time restriction. In such cases, birds fly at a flight speed that maximizes the overall <b>speed</b> of <b>migration.</b> For summer roosting flights, speeds were predicted to be lower than during both spring and autumn since the predicted flight speed is the minimum power speed that involves the lowest energy consumption per unit time. During autumn, we expected flight speeds to be higher than during summer but lower than during spring since the expected flight speed is the maximum range speed, which involves the lowest energy consumption per unit distance. Flight speeds during spring were indeed higher than during both summer and autumn, which indicates time-selected spring <b>migration.</b> <b>Speeds</b> during autumn <b>migration</b> were very similar to those recorded during summer roosting flights. The general result shows that swifts change their flight speed between different flight behaviours to a smaller extent than expected. Furthermore, the difference between flight <b>speeds</b> during <b>migration</b> and roosting among swifts was found to be less pronounced than previously recorded...|$|R
40|$|Dynamic {{computation}} {{migration is}} the runtime choice between computation and data migration. Dynamic computation <b>migration</b> <b>speeds</b> up access to concurrent data structures with unpredictable read/write patterns. This paper describes the design, implementation, {{and evaluation of}} dynamic computation migration in a multithreaded distributed shared-memory system, MCRL. Two policies are studied, STATIC and REPEAT. Both migrate computation for writes. STATIC migrates data for reads, while REPEAT maintains a limited history of accesses and sometimes migrates computation for reads. On a concurrent, distributed B-tree with 50 % lookups and 50 % inserts, STATIC improves performance by about 17 % on both Alewife and the CM- 5. REPEAT generally performs better than STATIC. With 80 % lookups and 20 % inserts, REPEATimproves performance by 23 % on Alewife, and by 46 % on the CM- 5. Keywords: computation migration, data migration, replication, coherence 1 Introduction Dynamic computation migration is the dyn [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Significant {{progress}} has been achieved toward elucidating the molecular mechanisms that underlie breast cancer progression; yet, much less {{is known about the}} associated cellular biophysical traits. To this end, we use time-lapsed confocal microscopy to investigate the interplay among cell motility, three-dimensional (3 D) matrix stiffness, matrix architecture, and transforming potential in a mammary epithelial cell (MEC) cancer progression series. We use a well characterized breast cancer progression model where human-derived MCF 10 A MECs overexpress either ErbB 2, 14 - 3 - 3 f, or both ErbB 2 and 14 - 3 - 3 f, with empty vector as a control. Cell motility assays showed that MECs overexpressing ErbB 2 alone exhibited notably high <b>migration</b> <b>speeds</b> when cultured atop two-dimensional (2 D) matrices, while overexpression of 14 - 3 - 3 f alone most suppressed migration atop 2 D matrices (as compared to non-transformed MECs). Our results also sugges...|$|R
