500|$|In Buddhist texts {{further details}} {{are given in}} what way {{and to what extent}} a meritorious deed will bring results: this depends on the spiritual quality of the recipient, the spiritual {{attitude}} of the giver, the manner in which one gives and the object given. If the recipient is a human, the gift yields more fruits than if the recipient is an animal, but a gift to a [...] (a young monk), a monk, many monks, and the Buddha yield even more fruits, in ascending order. If the giver is motivated by greed or other defilements of the mind, the merit gained will be much less than if the giver is motivated by loving-kindness or other noble intentions. Even the intention of going to heaven, though in itself not considered wrong, is not seen as lofty as the intention to want to develop and purify the mind. If the recipient is spiritually [...] "not worthy of the gift", the gift will still be meritorious provided the giver's intention is good, and this is also valid the other way around. Good thoughts must also be maintained after the good deed is done, as regretting the gift will also decrease the merit. Whether the giver pronounces a certain wish or intention also affects the meritorious deed, as the power of the merits can be channeled toward a certain purpose. The manner in which people give is also important: whether someone gives respectfully or not, and whether by giving someone is harming anyone. With regard {{to the size of the}} gift, a larger gift is usually more meritorious than a smaller one, but purity of mind affects merit more than the gift's size. It is therefore recommended to give as <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> afford, no more and no less. Such care in choosing who to give to and how to give, is called being 'skilled in merit' (...) [...]|$|E
2500|$|The school motto Quantum Potes Tantum Aude ("Dare All You Can, for God and Man") was {{introduced}} by the rector-headmaster, Fr Thomas Gartlan SJ, in 1906. Quantum Potes Tantum Aude is now formally translated from Latin as [...] "As <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> do, so much dare to do", seen to best reflect the Latin, replacing the former [...] "Dare to do your Best". The motto is taken from a song of Saint Thomas Aquinas (12271274) entitled Lauda Sion Salvatorem ('Praise, O Sion, Praise Thy Saviour'). The next line after Quantum Potes Tantum Aude is Quia Maior Omni Laude, which, together, translates to [...] "As <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> do, so much dare to do, because He is above all praise".|$|E
