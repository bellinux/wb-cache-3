Moreover, <b>market</b> <b>input</b> prices include a mark-up that arises from the bargaining between the firm and the independent supplier. Transfer prices set at market values following the arm's length principle thus systematically exceed multinationals' marginal costs, leading to a reduction of tax payments for each unit sold.

40|$|Ethiopia has {{the largest}} {{livestock}} population in Africa. Yet, Livestock productivity is among {{the lowest in the}} region. Several factors contribute to the low productivity, including inefficient <b>input</b> and output <b>markets,</b> diseases and traditional management practices. Improving the efficiency of livestock <b>input</b> <b>markets</b> is essential to raise productivity. High transaction costs reduce market efficiency and thereby the volume of exchange. Transaction costs are conditioned by the institutional environment in which exchange takes place. This study is conducted on 1200 households in 10 districts in 4 regions of Ethiopia to analyse household specific transaction cost factors in livestock <b>input</b> <b>markets</b> (feed, veterinary service and drugs, and artificial insemination (AI)), and the determinants of household participation in the <b>input</b> <b>markets.</b> Highest <b>input</b> <b>market</b> participation is observed for veterinary services and drugs, followed by roughages and agro-byproducts. Household market participation in concentrates and AI is very low. Household wealth appears to be an important determinant of participation in livestock <b>input</b> <b>markets.</b> Households perceive high degree of cheating on quality and weight of inputs by traders. Similarly, households are concerned about information asymmetry when inputs are bought from traders, as opposed to farmers. Our results show that transaction costs are of high concern for farmers when inputs are bought from the private sector. The involvement of the private sector in livestock <b>input</b> <b>markets</b> must be encouraged in Ethiopia. However, our results imply that policies and strategies to promote the involvement of the private sector in livestock <b>input</b> <b>markets</b> need to be accompanied by appropriate regulatory system to mitigate the effect of transaction costs.

40|$|We {{make use}} of data from the 2005 Albania Living Standard Measurement Survey to {{investigate}} the factors affecting household agriculture efficiency and land market development. To assess the functioning of land rental markets and explore efficiency- and equity impacts of land rental, we use a model of producers who differ in endowments and skills and who face imperfect labor markets and transaction costs. The empirical evidence, of a stochastic frontier estimate, shows that productivity is low and most farms are inefficiently utilized. The average level of agriculture efficiency among rural household is very less than 30 % but household that rent in land are more efficient. However, results from a probit regression on rental market participation shows that rental market helps to transfer land to more efficient producers. However, several constraints in credit <b>market,</b> <b>input,</b> labor, {{and the lack of}} irrigation are outweighing the productivity advantage of the tenants. In addition to that, land market development is delayed by remaining restrictions and high transaction cost. To overcome these limitations as well as inadequate system of land title registration, household are using informal land transactions, such as inheritance, in order to increase farming efficiency.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to study optimal {{congestion}} taxes in a time allocation framework. This makes it possible to distinguish taxes on inputs in the production of car trips and taxes on transport as an activity. Moreover, the model allows us to consider the implications of treating transport as a demand, derived from other activities. We extend several well known tax rules from the public finance literature and carefully interpret the implications for the optimal tax treatment of passenger transport services. The main findings of the paper are the following. First, if governments are limited to taxing <b>market</b> <b>inputs</b> into transport trip production, the time allocation framework (i) provides an argument for taxing congestion below marginal external cost, (ii) implies a favourable tax treatment for time-saving devices such as GPS, and (iii) provides a previously unnoticed argument for public transport subsidies. Second, if the government has access to perfect road pricing that directly taxes transport as an activity, all previous results disappear. Third, in the absence of perfect road pricing, the activity-specific congestion attracted by employment centres, by shopping centres or by large sports and cultural events should be corrected via higher taxes on <b>market</b> <b>inputs</b> in these activities (e. g., entry tickets, parking fees, etc.).

The logic behind the promotion of this form of farming is to encourage private investment in agriculture and to reduce price risks as well as post-harvest losses, especially risk oriented fruits, vegetables and high value crops. The private sector {{may play a role}} in providing a range of services to small holders from input supply to crop assembly and marketing. In this context, the present paper explores at what extent contract farming would remove the constraints faced by small holders in Indian agriculture and help them to move out from poverty trap. It was observed that contract farming cannot be seen as a panacea for all the problems afflicting the Indian agriculture while it has the potential to address the problems relating to access to <b>market</b> (<b>input</b> and output), new technology and price stability, it generates the problems like degradation of traditional knowledge, soil quality and bias towards large farmers.

40|$|This study {{analyzes}} productivity differentials {{between men}} and women in the peasant agriculture in Nepal. Both Cobb-Douglas and translog production functions are estimated using data from the Nepal Living Standard Survey 2003 / 04. Evidence is found for higher value of marginal product of adult family male than adult female, while marginal products of other inputs are found to be relatively higher than the prevailing market wages and prices, implying that these inputs have become gradually a binding constraint in production. Male managed farms produce more output per hectare with higher command in <b>market</b> <b>input</b> use, obtaining credit, and receiving agricultural extension services than female managed farms. In contrast, the result does not clearly support the hypothesis of separability or aggregation of male and female labour, but there is little justification of weak separability. Moreover, head’s sex as proxy for farm manager does not show any difference between male and female managed farms. However, the coefficients of location and household characteristics show significant variations in farm output among ethnic and caste groups residing in different ecological belts of Nepal. Overall, adult male labour is found to contribute more in production process than adult female labour. ...|$|E
