5|$|In December 2007, the United States {{entered the}} longest post–World War II recession, which {{included}} a housing market correction, a subprime mortgage crisis, soaring oil prices, and a declining dollar value. In February, 63,000 jobs were lost, a five-year record. To aid with the situation, Bush signed a $170billion economic stimulus package which was intended to improve the economic situation by sending tax rebate checks to many Americans and providing tax breaks for struggling businesses. The Bush administration pushed for significantly increased regulation of Fannie <b>Mae</b> <b>and</b> Freddie Mac in 2003, and after two years, the regulations passed the House but died in the Senate. Many Republican senators, as well as influential members of the Bush Administration, feared that the agency created by these regulations would merely be mimicking the private sector's risky practices. In September 2008, the crisis became much more serious beginning with the government takeover of Fannie <b>Mae</b> <b>and</b> Freddie Mac followed {{by the collapse of}} Lehman Brothers and a federal bailout of American International Group for $85billion.|$|E

5|$|In February 2014, Politico {{reported}} that in October 2008, Bevin had signed a report for his investment fund that praised the federal Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) and the government takeover of Fannie <b>Mae</b> <b>and</b> Freddie Mac. During the campaign, Bevin criticized McConnell for voting in favor of those actions as a senator. When Beck asked Bevin about the issue during an interview, Bevin said {{the content of the}} report had been written by the fund's chief investment officer, and that he had only signed it because he was legally required to do so as president of the fund. Later, Bevin added that he had not physically signed the letter, but that his signature was added to the document digitally. Lawyers interviewed by the Lexington Herald-Leader said it would have been legal for Bevin to change the content of the letter, but not the accompanying facts and financial data. The Herald-Leader further noted that Bevin had not signed some previous investor letters. His campaign offered no explanation for the inconsistency.|$|E

50|$|For example, a {{metamorphic}} {{rock in the}} Neil Bay area of northern Saskatchewan underwent high grade (high P/T) metamorphism followed by exhumation (uplift). Porphyroblast garnet is formed during high grade metamorphism while porphyroblast cordierite is formed during exhumation afterwards. Both porphyroblasts contain monazite inclusions which dated 1910 <b>Ma</b> <b>and</b> 1840 <b>Ma</b> respectively. <b>And</b> matrix monazite is dated 1800 Ma. Thus, it is interpreted that high grade metamorphism occurred after 1910 <b>Ma</b> <b>and</b> before 1840 <b>Ma,</b> while exhumation after 1840 <b>Ma,</b> <b>and</b> the final annealing (cooling and coarsening of minerals) at 1800 Ma.|$|R
