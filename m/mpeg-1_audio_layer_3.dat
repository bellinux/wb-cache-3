50|$|<b>MPEG-1</b> <b>Audio</b> <b>Layer</b> II or MPEG-2 <b>Audio</b> <b>Layer</b> II (MP2, {{sometimes}} incorrectly called Musicam or MUSICAM) is a lossy {{audio compression}} format defined by ISO/IEC 11172-3 alongside <b>MPEG-1</b> <b>Audio</b> <b>Layer</b> I and <b>MPEG-1</b> <b>Audio</b> <b>Layer</b> III (MP3).

50|$|Part 7 (ISO/IEC 13818-7) of the MPEG-2 {{standard}} specifies {{a rather}} different, non-backwards-compatible audio format (also known as MPEG-2 NBC). Part 7 {{is referred to}} as MPEG-2 AAC.

50|$|A {{player of}} generic MPEG-2 files can usually play unencrypted VOB files, which contain <b>MPEG-1</b> <b>Audio</b> <b>Layer</b> II <b>audio.</b> Other audio {{compression}} formats such as AC-3 or DTS are less widely supported.|$|R
50|$|Variable {{bit rate}} encoding, while not {{supported}} by the <b>MPEG-1</b> <b>Audio</b> <b>Layer</b> II standard, is part of the SVCD specification. However, variable bit rate audio is not consistently supported by standalone players, and thus the format is rarely used.|$|R
50|$|Digital Audio Broadcasting (DAB), {{also known}} as Eureka 147, has been under {{development}} since the early eighties, has been adopted by around 20 countries worldwide. It {{is based on the}} <b>MPEG-1</b> <b>Audio</b> <b>Layer</b> II <b>audio</b> coding format and this has been co-ordinated by the WorldDMB.|$|R
50|$|The Eureka Project 147 {{resulted}} in the publication of European Standard, ETS 300 401 in 1995, for DAB which now has worldwide acceptance. The DAB standard uses the <b>MPEG-1</b> <b>Audio</b> <b>Layer</b> II (ISO/IEC 11172-3) for 48 kHz sampling frequency and the MPEG-2 <b>Audio</b> <b>Layer</b> II (ISO/IEC 13818-3) for 24 kHz sampling frequency.|$|R
50|$|Beginning in {{the late}} 1980s, a {{standardization}} body called the Motion Picture Experts Group (MPEG) developed generic standards for coding of both audio and video. Subband coding resides {{at the heart of}} the popular MP3 format (more properly known as <b>MPEG-1</b> <b>Audio</b> <b>Layer</b> III), for example.|$|R
50|$|<b>MPEG-1</b> <b>Audio</b> <b>Layer</b> III HD more {{commonly}} known and advertised by its abbreviation mp3HD is an audio compression codec developed by Technicolor {{formerly known as}} Thomson. It achieves lossless data compression, and is backwards compatible with the MP3 format by storing two data streams in one file.|$|R
50|$|For {{the audio}} codec, usual DTMB set-top boxes would support <b>MPEG-1</b> <b>Audio</b> <b>Layer</b> II (MP2) for stereo audio tracks, and Dolby AC-3 for {{surround}} sound audio tracks. The official specification defines standard-definition broadcasting as 576i at 25 frame/s and high-definition broadcasting in 720p at 50Hz or 1080i at 25Hz.|$|R
50|$|The older {{version of}} DAB {{that is being}} used in Denmark*, Ireland*, Norway*, Switzerland* and the UK, uses the <b>MPEG-1</b> <b>Audio</b> <b>Layer</b> 2 <b>audio</b> codec, which is also known as MP2 due to {{computer}} files using those characters for their file extension. All five countries also use DAB+.|$|R
50|$|The MPEG-2 Audio section, {{defined in}} Part 3 (ISO/IEC 13818-3) of the standard, enhances <b>MPEG-1's</b> <b>audio</b> by {{allowing}} the coding of audio programs with more than two channels, up to 5.1 multichannel. This method is backwards-compatible (also known as MPEG-2 BC), allowing <b>MPEG-1</b> <b>audio</b> decoders to decode the two main stereo components of the presentation. MPEG-2 part 3 also defined additional bit rates and sample rates for <b>MPEG-1</b> <b>Audio</b> <b>Layer</b> I, II and III.|$|R
50|$|PQF {{filters are}} used in <b>MPEG-1</b> <b>Audio</b> <b>Layer</b> I and II, Musepack (which was based on MPEG-1 layer II), in MPEG-1 Layer III with anadditional MDCT, in MPEG-4 AAC-SSR for the 4 band PQF bank, in MPEG-4 V3 SBRfor the {{analysis}} of the upper spectral replicated band, and in DTS.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>MPEG-1</b> <b>Audio</b> {{standard}} {{was based on}} the existing MUSICAM and ASPEC <b>audio</b> formats.The <b>MPEG-1</b> <b>Audio</b> standard included the three audio [...] "layers" [...] (encoding techniques) now known as Layer I (MP1), Layer II (MP2) and Layer III (MP3).All algorithms for <b>MPEG-1</b> <b>Audio</b> <b>Layer</b> I, II and III were approved in 1991 as the committee draft of ISO-11172 and finalized in 1992 as part of MPEG-1, the first standard suite by MPEG, which resulted in the international standard ISO/IEC 11172-3 (a.k.a. <b>MPEG-1</b> <b>Audio</b> or <b>MPEG-1</b> Part 3), published in 1993. Further work on MPEG audio was finalized in 1994 as part of the second suite of MPEG standards, MPEG-2, more formally known as international standard ISO/IEC 13818-3 (a.k.a. MPEG-2 Part 3 or backward compatible MPEG-2 Audio or MPEG-2 Audio BC), originally published in 1995. MPEG-2 Part 3 (ISO/IEC 13818-3) defined additional bit rates and sample rates for <b>MPEG-1</b> <b>Audio</b> <b>Layer</b> I, II and III. The new sampling rates are exactly half that of those originally defined for <b>MPEG-1</b> <b>Audio.</b> MPEG-2 Part 3 also enhanced <b>MPEG-1's</b> <b>audio</b> by allowing the coding of audio programs with more than two channels, up to 5.1 multichannel.|$|R
5000|$|The term MP2 and {{filename}} extension [...]mp2 usually refer <b>MPEG-1</b> <b>Audio</b> <b>Layer</b> II data, {{but can also}} refer to MPEG-2 <b>Audio</b> <b>Layer</b> II, a mostly backward compatible extension which adds support for multichannel audio, variable bit rate encoding, and additional sampling rates, defined in ISO/IEC 13818-3. The abbreviation MP2 is also sometimes erroneously applied to MPEG-2 video or MPEG-2 AAC audio.|$|R
