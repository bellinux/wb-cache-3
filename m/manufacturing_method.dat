5|$|Prior to {{the commercialization}} of the Monsanto process, most acetic acid was {{produced}} by oxidation of acetaldehyde. This remains the second-most-important <b>manufacturing</b> <b>method,</b> although it is usually not competitive with the carbonylation of methanol. The acetaldehyde can be produced by hydration of acetylene. This was the dominant technology in the early 1900s.|$|E
25|$|A common {{practice}} in that period was also to melt gold into copper molds for convenience, derived from the sycee <b>manufacturing</b> <b>method.</b> These were called Bundōkin (分銅金), of which there were two types, the small Kobundō (小分銅), and the large Ōbundō (大分銅). A Kobundō would represent about 373g in gold.|$|E
25|$|A later <b>manufacturing</b> <b>method</b> used wooden molds {{to speed}} up the float-making process. Glass floats were blown into a mold to more easily achieve a uniform size and shape. Seams on the outside of floats are a result of this process. Sometimes knife {{markings}} where the wooden molds were carved are also visible {{on the surface of the}} glass.|$|E
40|$|Laser {{assisted}} <b>manufacturing</b> <b>methods,</b> such {{as direct}} metal deposition (DMD) and {{laser beam welding}} (LBW), are promising methods because of their higher precision and greater productivity when compared to traditional <b>manufacturing</b> <b>methods.</b> Because these methods are relatively new, the mechanical properties of samples produced by laser assisted manufacturing are not well understood. In this study the mechanical properties of samples produced by laser assisted <b>manufacturing</b> <b>methods</b> are analyzed and compared with data obtained from traditional <b>manufacturing</b> <b>methods.</b> The DMD process used Fe-TiC and Ti-TiC metal matrix composites, while LBW used AISI 304 stainless steel. The results vary widely with the materials and processes used. Although their use is highly dependent upon the individual applications and their needs, laser assisted <b>manufacturing</b> <b>methods</b> present an alternative to conventional techniques. This study {{can serve as a}} guide to comparing the results of various <b>manufacturing</b> <b>methods</b> and choosing the appropriate technique for the desired results...|$|R

In collaboration with Lockheed Martin Aeronautics, the Directorate helped develop a new laser-based ultrasonic scanner to inspect composite parts also for use on the F-22. The Directorate also developed an advanced thermoplastic composite material {{for use in the}} landing gear doors on the F-22.

25|$|In {{ammunition}} manufacture, swaged bullets are bullets {{manufactured by}} compressing metal {{at room temperature}} into a die to form it {{into the shape of}} a bullet. The other common <b>manufacturing</b> <b>method</b> is casting, which uses molten metals poured into a mold. Since metals expand when heated and contract when cooled, cast bullets must be cast with a mold slightly larger than the desired finish size, so that as the molten metal cools, it will harden at just the right point to shrink to the desired size. In contrast, swaged bullets, since they are formed at the temperature at which they will be used, can be formed in molds of the exact desired size. This means that swaged bullets are generally more precise than cast bullets. The swaging process also leads to fewer imperfections, since voids commonly found in casting would be pressed out in the swaging process. The swaging process in reference to cold flow of metals into bullets is the process not of squeezing the metals into smaller forms but rather pressing smaller thinner items to form into shorter and slightly wider shapes.|$|E
500|$|Antonov {{proposed}} a [...] "westernised" [...] {{version of the}} An-70, the An-7X. The German government tasked DaimlerChrysler Aerospace (DASA) with the responsibility of evaluating the An-70 and assessing whether it would fulfill the ESR for a common tactical airlifter. Airbus provided data of the aircraft to DASA, who confirmed the data with its own wind-tunnel tests. According to the DASA study from 1999, the An-70 fulfilled the ESR, and that westernisation is possible, but work in key areas would have been necessary and risks existed. Areas identified include the introduction of full authority digital engine control, a [...] completely new cockpit, a new flight-control system computer, the addition of in-flight refuelling capability, as well as modifications to allow paratroopers to be dropped from the rear cargo door. DASA recommended {{a change in the}} <b>manufacturing</b> <b>method</b> of the carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer components. Also the fuselage manufacturing-method was considered uneconomical.

Massachusetts-based 1366 Technologies will develop a new cell architecture for low-cost, multi-crystalline silicon cells, which will enhance cell performance through improved light-trapping texturing and grooves for self-aligned metallization fingers. California's Innovalight will use ink-jet printing to transfer their [...] "siliconink" [...] onto thin-crystalline silicon wafers to produce high-efficiency, low-cost solar cells and modules. Skyline Solar, also in California, will develop an integrated, lightweight, single-axis tracked system that reflects and concentrates sunlight over 10times onto silicon cells. Solasta, in Massachusetts, is working on a novel cell design that increases currents and lowers the materials cost. Solexel, another California-based company, will commercialize a disruptive, 3Dhigh-efficiency mono-crystalline silicon cell technology that dramatically reduces manufacturing cost per watt. Finally, Spire Semiconductor in New Hampshire will develop three-junction tandem solar cells that better optimize the optical properties of their device layers; the company is targeting cell efficiencies over 42% using a low-cost <b>manufacturing</b> <b>method.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Starting in 1844, Rodman {{began running}} {{experiments}} {{to overcome the}} size limitations of cast iron cannon due {{to the way they}} were made. Up to that time, all cannon barrels made of iron were cast solid and then cooled only on their outside, resulting in uneven cooling when the metal contracted toward the barrel's outer surface. This process also [...] "created internal strains and structural irregularities," [...] and these problems were even more prevalent in large bore castings, especially on any actual openings in the cannon that were designed. Made in this way, the cannons could crack during the cooling process, break apart during shipment, or worse burst as they were fired. Although it took him years, Rodman developed a way to solve these drawbacks. He found that if he cast the iron around a hollow core and then applied a steady stream of water within the barrel for cooling, a much more reliable and stronger product was made. His method, and the result, has been described as: [...] "Water circulating through the tube cooled the bore while coals were piled against the mold to keep the outer surface hot. Rodman's <b>manufacturing</b> <b>method,</b> now known as the 'wet chill process', forced the impurities outward while the outer metal shrank against the hardened interior." [...] Doing this forced the thickest material {{toward the center of the}} barrel, and Rodman would then patent this invention.|$|E
