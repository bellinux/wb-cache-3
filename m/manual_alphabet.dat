25|$|Until the 19th century, {{most of what}} we {{know about}} {{historical}} sign languages is limited to the manual alphabets (fingerspelling systems) that were invented to facilitate transfer of words from a spoken language to a sign language, rather than documentation of the language itself.

25|$|Fingerspelling (or dactylology) is the {{representation}} of the letters of a writing system, and sometimes numeral systems, using only the hands. These <b>manual</b> <b>alphabets</b> (also known as finger alphabets or hand alphabets), have often been used in deaf education, and have subsequently been adopted as a distinct part of a number of sign languages; there are about forty <b>manual</b> <b>alphabets</b> around the world.

5000|$|In {{seventh century}} England, Bede, a Benedictine monk, {{proposed}} {{a system for}} representing {{the letters of the}} Latin script on the fingers. Monastic sign languages used throughout medieval Europe used <b>manual</b> <b>alphabets</b> as well as signs, and were capable of representing a written language, if one had enough patience. Aside from the commonly understood rationale of observing [...] "vows of silence", they also served as mnemonics (memory aids) for preachers. These <b>manual</b> <b>alphabets</b> began to be used to teach the deaf children of royalty in 17th century Spain, and {{can be seen as a}} kind of proto-manually coded language. Such alphabets are in widespread use today by signing deaf communities for representing words or phrases of the oral language used in their part of the world.|$|R
25|$|By 1720, the British <b>manual</b> <b>{{alphabet}}</b> {{had found}} {{more or less}} its present form.

25|$|Frenchman Charles-Michel de l'Épée {{published}} his <b>manual</b> <b>alphabet</b> in the 18th century, which has survived basically unchanged in France and North America until the present time. In 1755, Abbé de l'Épée founded the first school for deaf children in Paris; Laurent Clerc was arguably its most famous graduate. Clerc {{went to the}} United States with Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet to found the American School for the Deaf in Hartford, Connecticut, in 1817. Gallaudet's son, Edward Miner Gallaudet, founded a school for the deaf in 1857 in Washington, D.C., which in 1864 became the National Deaf-Mute College. Now called Gallaudet University, {{it is still the}} only liberal arts university for deaf people in the world.|$|E
25|$|A two-handed <b>manual</b> <b>alphabet,</b> {{identical}} to the one used in British Sign Language and New Zealand Sign Language, is integral to Auslan. This alphabet is used for fingerspelling proper nouns such as personal or place names, common nouns for everyday objects, and English words, especially technical terms, {{for which there is no}} widely used sign. Fingerspelling can also be used for emphasis, clarification, or, sometimes extensively, by English-speaking learners of Auslan. The amount of fingerspelling varies with the context and the age of the signer. A recent small-scale study puts fingerspelled words in Auslan conversations at about 10% of all lexical items, roughly equal to ASL and higher than many other sign languages, such as New Zealand Sign Language. The proportion is higher in older signers, suggesting that the use of fingerspelling has diminished over time.|$|E
25|$|Two-handed <b>manual</b> <b>{{alphabet}}s</b> {{are used}} {{by a number of}} deaf communities; one such alphabet is shared by users of British Sign Language, Auslan and New Zealand Sign Language (collectively known as the BANZSL language family), while another is used in Turkish Sign Language. Some of the letters are represented by iconic shapes, and in the BANZSL languages the vowels are represented by pointing to the fingertips.|$|R

25|$|Changes {{to a new}} writing medium {{sometimes}} {{caused a}} break in graphical form, or make the relationship difficult to trace. It is not immediately obvious that the cuneiform Ugaritic alphabet derives from a prototypical Semitic abjad, for example, although {{this appears to be}} the case. And while manual alphabets are a direct continuation of the local written alphabet (both the British two-handed and the French/American one-handed alphabets retain the forms of the Latin alphabet, as the Indian <b>manual</b> <b>alphabet</b> does Devanagari, and the Korean does Hangul), Braille, semaphore, maritime signal flags, and the Morse codes are essentially arbitrary geometric forms. The shapes of the English Braille and semaphore letters, for example, are derived from the alphabetic order of the Latin alphabet, but not from the graphic forms of the letters themselves. Most modern forms of shorthand are also unrelated to the alphabet, generally transcribing sounds instead of letters.|$|E
25|$|There are two {{families}} of manual alphabets used for representing the Latin alphabet {{in the modern}} world. The more common of the two is mostly produced on one hand, and {{can be traced back}} to alphabetic signs used in Europe from at least the early 15th century. The alphabet, first described completely by Spanish monks, was adopted by the Abbé de l'Épée's deaf school in Paris in the 18th century, and was then spread to deaf communities around the world in the 19th and 20th centuries via educators who had learned it in Paris. Over time, variations have emerged, brought about by natural phonetic changes that occur over time, adaptions for local written forms with special characters or diacritics (which are sometimes represented with the other hand), and avoidance of handshapes that are considered obscene in some cultures. The most widely used modern descendant is the American <b>manual</b> <b>alphabet.</b>|$|E
500|$|ASL {{possesses}} {{a set of}} 26 signs known as the American <b>manual</b> <b>alphabet,</b> {{which can be used}} to spell out words from the English language. These signs make use of the 19 handshapes of ASL. [...] For example, the signs for 'p' and 'k' use the same handshape but different orientations. A common misconception is that ASL consists only of fingerspelling; although such a method (Rochester Method) has been used, it is not ASL.|$|E

Many sign languages have developed independently throughout the world, and no first sign language can be identified. Both signed systems and <b>manual</b> <b>alphabets</b> were found worldwide, and, though most recorded instances of sign languages seem to occur in Europe in the 17th century, it is possible that popular European ideals have overshadowed much of the attention earlier signed systems may have otherwise received. It was commonly accepted, for instance, that “the deaf” could not be educated; when John of Beverley, Archbishop of York, taught a deaf person to speak in 685 AD, it was deemed a miracle, and he was later canonized [...] Generally, philosophies linking (spoken) language and intelligence persisted well into the Enlightenment. Such hegemonic ideas may have prevented the recognition of histories of certain groups for whom sign languages were integral. Earlier than the 17th century, however, groups of Deaf people may have already lived together in communities, where even in small numbers they may have communicated through basic signing systems.|$|R

40|$|AbstractHand {{gestures}} play {{an important}} role in communication between people during their daily lives. But the extensive use of hand gestures as a mean of communication can be found in sign languages. Sign language is the basic communication method between deaf people. A translator is usually needed when an ordinary person wants to communicate with a deaf one. The work presented in this paper aims at developing a system for automatic translation of gestures of the <b>manual</b> <b>alphabets</b> in the Arabic sign language. In doing so, we have designed a collection of ANFIS networks, each of which is trained to recognize one gesture. Our system does not rely on using any gloves or visual markings to accomplish the recognition job. Instead, it deals with images of bare hands, which allows the user to interact with the system in a natural way. An image of the hand gesture is processed and converted into a set of features that comprises of the lengths of some vectors which are selected to span the fingertips' region. The extracted features are rotation, scale, and translation invariat, which makes the system more flexible. The subtractive clustering algorithm and the least-squares estimator are used to identify the fuzzy inference system, and the training is achieved using the hybrid learning algorithm. Experiments revealed that our system was able to recognize the 30 Arabic <b>manual</b> <b>alphabets</b> with an accuracy of 93. 55 %...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: In this paper, {{we present}} the results of both {{classroom}} lessons and Web-based learning for Japanese <b>manual</b> <b>alphabets</b> (YUBIMOJI) to ordinary elementary school children. So far, we have developed an easy-to-use edutainment system: Practice! YUBIMOJI AIUEO (PYA). The objectives of PYA are to promote basic expressions of Kana characters (AIUEO) of Japanese <b>manual</b> <b>alphabets,</b> and to give the experience of communication with deaf people to ordinary children at elementary school age. In our previous work, we have shown that PYA is an effective educational material to increase the awareness of school children concerning the universal design. Extending the results, we develop a new framework for a classroom design. For the purpose, we have improved PYA to PYA-WEB. In this paper, we have carried out series of intensive experiments at classrooms of Sumiyoshi Elementary School and Web-learning (7 or 8 years old; 59 subjects). The results are summarized as follows: 1) The greediness for learning at starting point is important to motivate learning and practice in order to let the students feel accomplished; 2) PYA-WEB is effective to increase the capability of YUBIMOJI reading; 3) PYA-WEB users with the higher motivation keep the learning effect the longer and they get a YUBIMOJI skill the more, {{in proportion to the}} access time; and 4) After the children mastered YUBIMOJI, the communication lessons with deaf people are successful. These results have suggested that PYA-WEB has encouraged children's self learning and enhanced the communication skill. The YUBIMOJI lessons with the proposed classroom design and PYA-WEB would be useful to construct a barrier-free society...|$|R

5000|$|Chirologia {{is often}} cited as Bulwer’s link to later Deaf studies because it focuses on hand {{gestures}} [...] which {{have come to be}} seen as the domain of deaf communication. In fact the book only mentions the deaf in passing. He believed it was Natures recompense that deaf people should communicate through gesture, [...] "that wonder of necessity that Nature worketh in men that are born deafe and dumb; who can argue and dispute rhetorically by signes" [...] (page 5). The handshapes described in Chirologia are still used in British Sign Language. Bulwer does mention fingerspelling describing how [...] "the ancients did...order an alphabet upon the joints of their fingers...showing those letters by a distinct and grammatical succession" [...] , in addition to their use as mnemonic devices Bulwer suggest that <b>manual</b> <b>alphabets</b> could be [...] "ordered to serve for privy ciphers for any secret intimation" [...] (Chironomia, p149).

2500|$|In Britain, manual alphabets {{were also}} in use {{for a number of}} purposes, such as secret {{communication}}, public speaking, or communication by deaf people.

2500|$|Manual alphabets {{based on}} the Arabic alphabet, the Ethiopian Ge'ez script and the Korean Hangul script use handshapes that {{are more or less}} iconic {{representations}} of the characters in the writing system. Some manual representations of non-Roman scripts such as Chinese, Japanese, Devanagari (e.g. the Nepali <b>manual</b> <b>alphabet),</b> Hebrew, Greek, Thai and Russian alphabets are based to some extent on the one-handed Latin alphabet described above. In some cases however, the [...] "basis" [...] is more theory than practice. Thus, for example, in the Japanese manual syllabary only the five vowels (ア /a/,　イ /i/,　ウ /u/,　エ /e/,　オ /o/) and the Ca (consonant plus [...] "a' vowel) letters (カ /ka/, サ /sa/, ナ /na/, ハ /ha/, マ /ma/, ヤ /ya/, ラ /ra/, ワ /wa/, but notably NOT タ /ta/ which would resemble a somewhat rude gesture) derive from the American <b>manual</b> <b>alphabet.</b> In the Nepali Sign Language it is only four [...] "letters" [...] which derive from the American manual alphabet: अ /a/, ब /b/, म /m/, and र /r/).|$|E

40|$|Sign {{language}} is a natural language that uses different means of expression for communication in everyday life.

This paper presents an Automatic translation system for gesture of <b>manual</b> <b>alphabets</b> in Marathi sign language.

System provides an opportunity for deaf persons to communicate with normal people without the need of an interpreter. We are going to build a systems and methods for the automatic recognition of Marathi sign language. The first step of this system is to create a database of Marathi Sign Language. Hand segmentation is the most crucial step in every hand gesture recognition system since if we get better segmented output, better recognition rates can be achieved. The proposed system also includes efficient and robust hand segmentation and tracking algorithm to achieve better recognition rates. A large set of samples has been used to recognize 43 isolated words from the Standard Marathi sign language.

The framework for handling both gesture types is a novel approach, and the evaluation shows promising results at 91. 77 % average correct classification using all 26 American Sign Language (ASL) <b>manual</b> <b>alphabets</b> as the examples. The system also achieves real-time performance at an average of 25 FPS. Other novel approaches in this study include the use of adaptive background model with the combination of elliptical skin-color model, K-mean clustering, and local region Gaussian mixture to detect hand under complex background.

In the early years, AAC was primarily used with laryngectomy and glossectomy cases, and later with individuals with cerebral palsy and aphasia. It was typically only employed after traditional speech therapy had failed, as many felt hesitant to provide non-speech intervention to those who might be able to learn to speak. Individuals with intellectual impairment were not provided with AAC support because it was believed that they did not possess the prerequisite skills for AAC. The main systems used were manual signs, communication boards and Morse code, though in the early 1960s, an electric communication device in the form of a sip-and-puff typewriter controller named the Patient Operated Selector Mechanism (POSM or POSSUM) was developed in the United Kingdom.|$|R
