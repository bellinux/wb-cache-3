40|$|The vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser (VCSEL) is a novel, {{low-cost}} {{light source}} with many attractive performance characteristics, such as low operating current, circular output beam, and high modulation bandwidth at low currents. This together with its easy integration into two-dimensional arrays {{has made it}} an established transmitter in short-distance single and parallel &# 64257;ber-optical links, and new applications are continuously arising. One example is new network architectures where the advantages of free-space optical interconnects are utilized, which include interference-free cross connections in multi-dimensional topologies. Other examples are gas sensing, laser printing, optical storage, and longer distance &# 64257;beroptical communication. Many of these applications require a single frequency light source with an output power of several milliwatts, often with a stable polarization state. Unfortunately, the VCSEL {{has a tendency to}} lase at several wavelengths, referred to as multimode operation, due to its relatively large transverse dimensions. In addition, it has frequently an unpredictable polarization state due to symmetry in the device geometry, and isotropic material properties. The aim of this work was &# 64257;rst to pin-point the performance differences between single and multimode VCSELs, with focus on the high-speed modulation characteristics, and secondly to develop a <b>monolithic</b> <b>technique</b> to achieve single mode and polarization stable operation in VCSELs. In the &# 64257;rst part, high-speed single and multimode VCSELs were designed, fabricated and characterized. Both digital and analog modulation characteristics were analyzed from eye diagram, bit-error rate, and harmonic and intermodulation distortion measurements, and compared to numerical simulations. In the second part, a shallow surface structure was incorporated in the VCSEL to control the mode and polarization behavior. By using a disk-shaped surface relief a record-high single mode output power of 6. 5 mW was achieved, and by further adding a surface grating to break the symmetry the polarization state was successfully pinned. No signi&# 64257;cant degradation of other important laser characteristics was observed due to the two surface structures...|$|E

Of particular interest are polycrystalline silicon (poly-Si) thin-film photovoltaic devices on foreign supporting superstrates such as glass, because they combine the best features of wafer-based modules (long-term stability, vast manufacturing experience) with the best features of thin-film modules (lower materials cost, and <b>monolithic</b> construction <b>techniques).</b> Since polycrystalline silicon thin-film solar cells on glass superstrates are a relatively recent development in photovoltaics, there remains much scope for the investigation and implementation of novel metallisation and interconnection schemes. This thesis is concerned with the invention and development of metallisation and interconnection schemes for this new photovoltaic material, poly-Si on glass. In this thesis, several new metallisation and interconnection schemes for poly-Si solar cells on glass superstrates were invented and investigated: - The sequential metallisation and interconnection scheme, which is based on cells with interdigitated n-type and p-type contacts, and subsequent inter-connection of individual cells. - The metal-free interconnection scheme, which relies on laser-doping of regions of the silicon film to interconnect adjacent cells, and does not require metal contacts. - The spanning-gap interconnection scheme, which involves laser-scribing of the silicon film, and overdoping one sidewall of each laser scribe, then connecting adjacent cells by filling the laser scribe with metal. - The wrap-over interconnection scheme, which employs laser scribing and insulating and conductive laser-scribe sidewalls, and a metal layer which interconnects adjacent cells.

This specific modulator group is particularly promising within the context of softwaredefined radios. However, due to the nonlinear sampling element within a closed-loop sdomain system, the high level of analytical complexity makes current CT BP CA modulators difficult to implement. Specific problems addressed in this research were the fundamental principles of the CA modulation process, analytical and design methodology, loop delay compensation <b>techniques,</b> <b>monolithic</b> implementation and possible application areas.

40|$|A power {{amplifier}} (PA) {{is a key}} part of the RF front-end in transmitters for a local broadband network. Today, commercial PAs are made of III-V HEMT and HBT technology with excellent results. An integrated system-on-chip {{power amplifier}} circuit using CMOS technology for cost-effective and spectrum-efficient high-speed wireless communication presents major challenges because power amplifiers have been the limiting components in RF CMOS transmitter integrated circuits (ICs). At high frequencies, the distributed effect and power device-scaling issues put other constraints on PA design such as the trade-off between output power (Pout) and power added efficiency (PAE). Recently, CMOS has become attractive for low-cost and high-level integration due to the advancement of NMOS performance with ft and fmax > 100 GHz and is available from commercial CMOS foundries. However, the foundry-provided BSIM-RF model is unable to accurately predict the I-V characteristics and RF behaviors (ft and fmax) of power devices with widths of several hundred microns. Therefore, an advanced large-signal model which is able to predict distributed nonlinear effects is crucial for the successful design of high-frequency PAs. The microwave lumped and distributed layout parasitic effect in the 130 nm (BSIM 3 v 3 -RF) and 90 nm (BSIM 4 -RF) models to accurately predict gain, output power, and harmonic distortions of power MOSFETs at millimeter wave frequencies. The proposed power device model is verified for single devices as well as for the integrated power amplifier circuits in S-band and W-band applications. For S-band WiMAX application, we have developed an accurate modeling with layout parasitic of power CMOS devices and designed lossless matching networks to achieve single-end PA performance of 31 dB gain, 21. 4 dBm output power, and 14. 5 % PAE at the 1 dB compression point.

40|$|Textile based piezoresistive {{transducers}} are {{an innovative}} category of devices that use yarns made of conductive and elastic fibers or screen printed conductive rubber coatings to sense strain. They usually satisfy wearability requirements {{and are used}} in real-time information gathering systems, being comfortable, ubiquitous and available for long term monitoring. They include knitted fiber transducers (KFTs), sewed fiber transducers (SFTs) and smeared redundant elastomer (SRETs) transducers. In the latter category, SRETs constituted by Conductive Elastomers (CEs) have been commonly employed as strain sensors networks to detect human posture and gesture. Elastic interconnection wiring is also easily realized leading to <b>monolithic</b> fabrication <b>techniques</b> which avoid the presence of metal wires and multiple solderings. Despite this, {{there is a strong}} dependence of the system performance by the body structure garment fitting. Moreover, the non-linear dynamical behaviour of SRETs requires identification algorithms, functions which relate joint angles to electrical values presented by the sensor network. The construction of these functions is quite complex and time of computation dramatically increases with the number of degrees of freedom and with the accuracy required to the system to be resolved. Recent development of CEs sensor modeling overcomed some of their main limitations and introduced new fields of operability in SRETs networks. In particular, in strain applications, a useful data processing technique is presented for treating the non-linear dynamical response, considering the different behaviour in sensor elongation and relaxation: actually, when the sensor in stretched, the breakdown of carbon black agglomerates produces an increase in resistance. Inversely, when the sensor is relaxed, the cross-link readjustment lead to different electrically conductive paths in respect to the previous states. This technique has found its implementation in multisensory systems, leading to encouraging results in biomechanical reconstruction. Furthermore, a novel approach in CEs sensing is described, relating the global curvature of a layer to its electrical resistance value variation and exploring under which conditions the resistance can be considered uncorrelated with its particular local bending profile. These devices are called Smeared Conductive Elastomer Electrogoniometers (SCEEGs) and under particular configuration they can be employed as on-body electrogoniometers. The integration of SRET arrays and SCEEGs is definitely a powerful tool for human body posture and gesture reconstruction through efficient and fast algorithms. Moreover In this study we introduce a particular realization of CE strain sensors deposed on an adhesive taping, obtaining a very low skin artifact device (VLSA). We present an electrogoniometric system in which the inextensible insulating layer has been replaced by an elastic layer, allowing the system to be employed both as strain sensor and as electrogoniometer. Finally, we present a biomechanical application in lumbar spine posture monitorization. As a matter of fact, it is known from literature that in the sagittal balance there is a strong correlation with the torso angle and geometrical parameters of lumbar vertebraes, such as the angle between subsequent upper endplates.

40|$|High-resolution {{simulation}} of fluid-structure interaction (FSI) problems on supercomputers has many applications including our targeting application in hemodynamics, but most existing methods and software {{do not scale}} to {{a large number of}} processor cores (more than O(104)) when the computational domain is complex and highly unstructured meshes have to be employed. In this thesis, we develop a highly scalable parallel nonlinear solver for fluid-structure interaction problems on unstructured meshes with complex geometry in 3 D. The proposed approach consists of several ingredients: a <b>monolithic</b> coupling <b>technique</b> for the fluid and the solid equations, a fully implicit nonlinear solver, and a highly scalable multilevel overlapping Schwarz preconditioner based on isogeometric coarse spaces. In the monolithic coupling approach, the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations for the fluid is formulated in an arbitrary Lagrangian-Euler framework in which an additional partial differential equation is used to describe the motion of the fluid domain. For the solid, a linear or nonlinear elasticity equation is described in the Lagrangian configuration, and the coupling conditions between the fluid and the solid are implicitly enforced on the wet interface. The fluid system is discretized by a finite element method together with SUPG stabilization, and the fluid domain motion and the solid equations are discretized by a finite element method. The semi-discretized system is further discretized in time by implicit schemes such as the backward Euler and the second-order backward difference formula. The coupled FSI system of equations is highly nonlinear and consists of hyperbolic, elliptic, parabolic components in a single system. We develop an inexact Newton-Krylov-Schwarz (NKS) method for solving the coupled FSI system of equations. The focus is on the scalability and the robustness of the algorithms with respect to different physics parameters on 3 D unstructured meshes with complex geometry and on supercomputers with a large number of processor cores. The parallel scalability of the NKS method depends almost completely on how the Jacobian system is solved and how a preconditioner is constructed. The main contribution of the thesis is a scalable preconditioner based on new non-standard coarse spaces. The new approach is developed based on the observation that the geometry of the fine mesh, including the fluid mesh and the solid mesh, is vital for the fast convergence of the linear solver. Therefore, a geometry preserving coarsening algorithm is introduced to generate isogeometric coarse meshes that share the same geometry as the fine mesh. The basic idea of the new coarsening algorithm is to retain all the vertices on the boundaries and the wet interface for preserving the geometry of the fine mesh and to coarsen the interior of the fine mesh as much as possible for saving the compute time on coarse levels. The quality of isogeometric coarse meshes is bad in the traditional sense but it is acceptable {{to be part of the}} multilevel Schwarz preconditioner. The overall algorithm equipped with isogeometric coarse spaces is scalable. Note that the overall solution accuracy is not affected by the quality of the coarse meshes, instead, it is determined completely by the fine mesh. We show numerically that the proposed algorithm and implementation are highly scalable in terms of the numbers of linear and nonlinear iterations and the total compute time on a supercomputer with more than 10, 000 processor cores for several problems with hundreds of millions of unknowns...|$|R
40|$|Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) varactors {{have the}} {{potential}} to replace conventional varactor diodes, due to their high loss and non-linearity, in many applications such as phase shifters, oscillators, and tunable filters. The objective of this thesis is to develop novel MEMS varactors to improve the capacitance tuning ratio, linearity, and quality factor. Several novel varactor configurations are developed, analyzed, fabricated and tested. They are built by using standard MEMS fabrication processes, as well as <b>monolithic</b> integration <b>techniques</b> in CMOS technology. The first capacitor consists of two movable plates, loaded with a nitride layer that exhibits an analog continuous capacitance tuning ratio. To decrease the the parasitic capacitance, a trench in the silicon substrate under the capacitor is adopted. The use of an insulation dielectric layer on the bottom plate of the MEMS capacitor increases the capacitors’ tuning ratio. Experimental and theoretical results are presented for two versions of the proposed capacitor with different capacitance values. The measured capacitance tuning ratio is 280 % at 1 GHz. The proposed MEMS vararctor is built using the MetalMUMPs process. The second, third, and fourth capacitors have additional beams that are called carrier beams. The use of the carrier beams makes it possible to obtain an equivalent nonlinear spring constant, which increases the capacitors’ analog continuous tuning ratio. A lumped element model and a continuous model of the proposed variable capacitors are developed. The continuous model is simulated by commercial software. A detailed analysis for the steady state of the capacitors is presented. The measured capacitance tuning ratios of these three capacitors are 410 %, 400 % and 470 %, respectively at 1 GHz. Also, the selfresonance frequency is measured and found to exceed 11 GHz. The proposed MEMS variable capacitors are built by the PolyMUMPs process. The fifth novel parallel-plate MEMS varactor has thin-film vertical comb actuators as its driver. Such an actuator can vertically displace both plates of the parallel-plate capacitor. By making use of the fringing field, this actuator exhibits linear displacement behavior, caused by the induced electrostatic force of the actuator’s electrodes. The proposed capacitor has a low parasitic capacitance and linear deflection due to the mechanically connected and electrically isolated actuators to the capacitor’s parallel-plates. The measured tuning capacitance ratio is 7 : 1 (600 %) at 1 GHz. The fabricated MEMS varactor exhibits a self resonance frequency of 9 GHz and built by MetalMUMPs process. The sixth parallel-plate MEMS varactor exhibits a linear response and high tuning capacitance ratio. The capacitor employs the residual stress of the chosen bi-layer, and the non-linear spring constants from the suspended cantilevers to obtain a non-linear restoring force that compensates for the nonlinear electrostatic force induced between the top and bottom plates. Two existing techniques are used to widen the tuning range of the proposed capacitor. The first technique is to decrease the parasitic capacitance by etching the lossy substrate under the capacitor’s plates. The second technique is employed to increase the capacitance density, where the areas between the top and bottom plates overlap, by applying a thin film of dielectric material, deposited by the atomic layer deposition (ALD) technique. The measured linear continuous tuning ratio for the proposed capacitor, built in the PolyMUMPs process, is 5 : 1 (400 %). The seventh and eighth MEMS variable capacitors have plates that curl up. These capacitors are built in 0. 35 μm CMOS technology from the interconnect metallization layers. The plates of the presented capacitors are intentionally curled upward to control the tuning performance. A newly developed maskless post-processing technique that is appropriate for MEMS/CMOS circuits is proposed. it consists of dry and wet etching steps, developed to integrate the proposed MEMS varactors in CMOS technology. Mechanically, the capacitors are simulated by the finite element method in ANSYS, and the results are compared with the measured results. The seventh capacitor is a tri-state structure that exhibits a measured tuning range of 460 % at 1 GHz with a flat capacitance response that is superior to that of conventional digital capacitors. The proposed capacitor is simulated in HFSS and the extracted capacitance is compared with the measured capacitance over a frequency range of 1 GHz to 5 GHz. The eighth capacitor is an analog continuous structure that demonstrates a measured continuous tuning range of 115 % at 1 GHz with no pull-in. The measured quality factor for both CMOSbased capacitors is more than 300 at 1. 5 GHz. The proposed curled-plate capacitors have a small area and can be realized to build a System-on-Chip (SoC). Finally, a tunable band pass filter that utilizes the MEMS variable capacitors in 0. 18 μm CMOS technology from TSMC is designed, modeled and fabricated...|$|R
40|$|In 1964 {{the first}} metal oxide {{semiconductor}} (MOS) integrated circuit (IC) became available. Shortly after in 1965 Gordon Moore predicted {{the pace of the}} device density increase in ICs. His prediction became a self-fulfilling prophecy, which taking advantage of the formal device scaling rules introduced by Robert Dennard in 1974, drove the evolution of the integrated electronic industry. In conventional two dimensional ICs, devices are integrated into a single layer of silicon in what is called the front end of line (FEOL) fabrication. Additional layers on top of the devices serve as inter-dielectric isolating layer and metal interconnects and are fabricated in the back end of line (BEOL) process. Scaling the dimension of devices allows for an increase in device density, improvement on device switching speed and reduction of the cost per device. The conjunction of these benefits drove the industry thus far. Over the past decade further scaling the devices while achieving also an increase in performance and cost benefits became extremely difficult. As the dimensional scaling of complementary MOS (CMOS) devices reaches its limits, three dimensional ICs (3 DICs) are increasingly being considered as a path to achieve higher device densities. 3 DICs offer a way to increase density by using multiple device layers on the same die, reducing the interconnect distance and allowing for a decrease in signal delay. Among different fabrication <b>techniques,</b> <b>monolithic</b> 3 D integration is potentially more cost effective but requires high performance devices, a process compatible with transistor integration in the BEOL stack and needs to deliver a high device density and uniformity in order to be adopted by the very large scale integration (VLSI) industry. This work focuses on a particular laser crystallization <b>technique</b> to achieve <b>monolithic</b> device integration. The technique, called Excimer Laser Crystallization (ELC), makes use of an excimer laser to achieve a large grain polycrystalline thin-film starting from an amorphous layer, allowing integration of high quality thin-film transistors (TFTs). Thus far, the ELC technique has been studied on thin-films typically deposited on top of quartz substrate or Si/SiO₂ wafers. On the other hand state of the art VLSI integration uses more advance BEOL stacks with low-κ material as interlayer dielectrics (ILDs) to passivate the copper (Cu) interconnect lines. This thesis focuses on three different key aspect to enable laser crystallization in the BEOL for device integration: 1. Excimer laser crystallization of amorphous silicon on low-κ dielectric; 2. Excimer laser crystallization of amorphous silicon on BEOL processed wafer; 3. VLSI of TFTs on excimer laser crystallized silicon. The ELC of amorphous silicon on low-κ dielectric is first explored through one dimension (1 D) finite element method (FEM) simulation of the temperature evolution during the laser exposure in two different systems: 1. amorphous silicon deposited on top of SiO₂ dielectric; 2. amorphous silicon deposited on top of low-κ dielectric. Simulations predict that is necessary a lower laser energy for crystallizing the silicon on the low-κ material. Experimental observations confirm the predicted behavior yielding a 35 % lower energy for crystallization of thin-film silicon on top of a low-κ dielectric. Material characterization through defect enhanced SEM micrograph, Raman spectroscopy and XRD analysis shows an equivalent material morphology for the two system with a preferential (111) crystal orientation for the SiO₂ system. Silicon crystallization on BEOL processed wafer is studied through a combination of 1 D FEM simulation and experimental observation on a silicon layer deposited on top of a SiO₂dielectric protecting the underlying damascene Cu structure. 1 D FEM show that during the silicon laser exposure, because of the short pulse width of the laser (30 ns), the heat is retained in the amorphous silicon layer allowing its melting while keeping the temperature of the Cu lines below 320 °C which is a favorable condition for monolithic integration in the BEOL. Further experimental evidences show the ability of crystallizing a-Si on such structure while preserving the physical and electrical properties of the Cu lines. The feasibility of monolithic VLSI 3 D integration is demonstrated through integration of TFTs devices on 200 mm silicon wafers. The integration process and performance of the TFTs device are modeled through technology computer aided design (TCAD) simulations which are used to define the process flow and the fabrication parameters. Characterization of the TFTs over multiple die yield good device performance and uniformity. TFTs characterized with 1. 5 V of supply voltage have a sub-threshold slope down to 79 mV/decade, current density up to 26. 3 μA/μm, a threshold voltage of 0. 23 V, current On/Off ratio above 10 ⁵ and device field effect mobility up to 19. 8 cm²/(V s) for LPCVD-sourced silicon. Furthermore, the Levinson method allows characterization of the trap density in the thin-film polysilicon devices yielding a mean value 8. 13 × 10 ¹² cm². This work present an integration scheme which proves to be compatible with VLSI in the BEOL of wafers. It paves the way to further development which could lead to an high performance, cost effective, monolithic 3 D integration approach useful in application such as reconfigurable logic, display, heterogeneous integration and on chip optical communications...|$|R
