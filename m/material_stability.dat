40|$|A {{theoretical}} {{investigation on}} <b>material</b> <b>stability</b> characterisation for incrementally non-linear solids at finite strains is developed. <b>Material</b> <b>stability</b> {{may be defined}} by means of static and dynamic approaches leading to different conditions. In the framework of static <b>material</b> <b>stability</b> conditions, the opportunity of defining an infinitesimal stable material behaviour as the positiveness of the scalar product of the Biot strain-rate and the conjugate stress-rate, is taken into consideration.

The main objective of the present work is to investigate the interrelations between different <b>material</b> <b>stability</b> criteria.

40|$|The {{stability}} and failure mechanism of a structure at the 				nanometer scale {{are important for}} understanding the mechanical 				behavior of nanoscale materials and structures. This thesis 				focuses on the <b>material</b> <b>stability</b> of atomic structures. First, 				the <b>material</b> <b>stability</b> of pristine carbon nanotubes is 				investigated at the continuum level by using the crystal 				elasticity theory. A homogenized continuum model is adopted. The 				strong ellipticity condition is employed to capture the 				localized failure of carbon nanotubes. The critical strain and 				strength predicted are reasonably comparable with experimental 				estimations. An atomic <b>material</b> <b>stability</b> theory is developed as the atomistic 				counterpart of the continuum <b>material</b> <b>stability</b> theory in 				nonlinear elasticity. A local instability indicator named 				"atomic acoustic tensor 2 ̆ 72 ̆ 7 is derived and utilized to detect 				material failure at the atomic scale. The stability criterion is 				based directly on the local energetic responses of an atomic 				site, and resorts to neither the continuum theory nor the 				pristine lattice. Thus, it is applicable to inhomogeneous atomic 				systems provided that the site energy can be reasonably defined. The atomic stability theory is combined with atomistic simulation 				to gain understanding on crack propagation and fracture as 				instabilities of bond structures. The atomic acoustic tensor is 				used as the indicator to detect the local instability at the 				crack tip, and then to decide bond breaking. Quasi-static crack 				growth till fracture is simulated by the atomistic finite 				element method, which is proposed according to the form of bond 				potential and lattice topology. An Eshelby-type approximate method is presented for calculating 				the formation energy of Stone-Wales defects. A formula is 				derived {{to show that the}} energy variation consists of the change 				of local atomic potential due to bond reconfiguration in the 				defective region and a higher order correction that represents 				the influence of the remaining system. The method is utilized to 				investigate the formation energy distribution in non-uniformly 				deformed nanotubes and to study the energetic interaction 				between multiple defects...|$|E

Therefore, numerical methods that {{are intended for}} failure simulation need to reproduce the onset of material instabilities with reasonable fidelity. Here the effectiveness of particle discretizations in reproducing of the onset of material instabilities is analyzed in two dimensions. For this purpose, a simplified hyperelastic law and a Blatz–Ko material are used. It is shown that the Eulerian kernels used in smooth particle hydrodynamics severely distort the domain of <b>material</b> <b>stability,</b> so that material instabilities can occur in stress states that should be stable. In particular, for the uniaxial case, material instabilities occur at much lower stresses, which is often called the tensile instability.

40|$|In this discussion, {{the notion}} of <b>material</b> <b>stability</b> is {{examined}} {{in the context of}} active muscle tissue modeling, where the nonlinear constitutive law is dependent on both the physiologically-driven muscle contraction and the finite mechanical deformation. First, the governing equations and constitutive laws for a general active-elastic material are linearized about a homogeneous underlying configuration. In order to obtain mathematical restrictions analogous to those found in elastic materials, stability conditions are derived based on the propagation of homogeneous plane waves with real wave speeds, and the generalized acoustic tensor is obtained. Focusing on 2 D motions, and considering a simplified, decoupled transversely isotropic energy function, the restriction on the active acoustic tensor is recast in terms of a generally applicable constitutive law, with specific attention paid to the fiber contribution. The implication of the <b>material</b> <b>stability</b> conditions on material parameters, active contraction, and elastic stretch is investigated for prototype material models of muscle tissue...|$|E
