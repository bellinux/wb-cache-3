25|$|Conservatives {{reject the}} {{assertion}} that different laws prescribed {{for men and women}} imply that men are more valuable than women. Ali ibn Musa Al-reza reasoned {{that at the time of}} marriage a <b>man</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> pay something to his prospective bride, and that men are responsible for both their wives' and their own expenses but women have no such responsibility.|$|E
25|$|A {{central theme}} {{in most of}} these tales is the {{difficulties}} of handling the new tolerance, open-mindedness and democratisation which are introduced by both the transition of society and by literature. Another theme is the conflict between the introverted and closed male nature and the vitality of the woman. Behind all this lies the classic naturalist theme of heritage and milieu against which <b>man</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> rebel without quite denying their existence. In his later works he sometimes seems to become a mixture of a castigator of society and a prophet of doom.|$|E
25|$|Fundamentalist {{scholars}} {{justify the}} different religious laws {{for men and}} women by referring to the biological and sociological differences between men and women. For example, regarding the inheritance law which states that women’s share of inheritance is half that of men, Ayatollah Makarim Shirazi quotes the Imam Ali ibn Musa Al-reza who reasons {{that at the time of}} marriage <b>man</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> pay something to woman and woman receives something, and that men are responsible for both their wives' and their own expenses but women have no responsibility thereof. Women, however, make up 27% of the Iranian labor force, and the percentage of all Iranian women who are economically active has more than doubled from 6.1% in 1986 to 13.7% in 2000.|$|E

[...] Russell himself in 2009 wrote his paternal grandfather's motto, passed down to his father and thence to him is: [...] "A <b>man</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> draw a line inside himself that he won't allow any man to cross"; Russell was [...] "proud of my Grandfather's heroic dignity against forces more powerful than him... he would not allow himself to be oppressed or intimidated by anyone"; he wrote these words after recounting how that grandfather {{stood up to the}} Ku Klux Klan and whites who attempted to thwart his efforts to build a schoolhouse for black children (Jake Russell was the first person in Bill Russell's patrilineal line born free in North America, and was himself illiterate). Thus Bill Russell's motto became [...] "If you disrespect that line, you disrespect me." ...|$|E
500|$|Referring to the {{incidents}} in the pub, Madonna explained her view on relationships where a <b>man</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> travel with his wife, while giving an example of her friend, actress Gwyneth Paltrow. She {{said that it was}} easier for Paltrow to tour with her then-husband Chris Martin, who is the lead singer of the alternative rock band, Coldplay. Madonna also recalled her troubled relationship with her father and how he had e-mailed the singer with his approval, after watching the documentary. Kabbalah featured prominently towards the end and the singer wanted to embark on a spiritual pilgrimage to Israel. However, ultra-orthodox Jews protested her trip, saying that Madonna disgraced Judaism with her portrayal of wearing phylacteries over her arm—a Jewish custom usually reserved for men—in the music video of her 2002 single [...] "Die Another Day", before escaping from an electric chair on which Hebrew letters spell out one of the 72 sacred names of God. Although Israeli securities had advised the singer against the trip, she nevertheless visited graves of Jewish sages in northern Israel as well as shrines such as Rachel's Tomb on the edge of Bethlehem, traditional burial place of the biblical matriarch Rachel.|$|E

In August 2006, she told the Anchorage Daily News that [...] "no woman should have to choose between her career, {{education}} and her child." [...] In an interview with Katie Couric on September 30, 2008, Palin said, [...] "I'm a feminist who believes in equal rights and I believe that women certainly today have every opportunity that a <b>man</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> succeed, and to try to do it all, anyway.

2500|$|At {{the same}} time Adorno struck up {{relationships}} with contemporary German-language poets such as Paul Celan and Ingeborg Bachmann. Adorno's 1949 dictum—"To write poetry after Auschwitz is barbaric"—posed {{the question of what}} German culture could mean after Auschwitz; his own continual revision of this dictum—in Negative Dialectics, for example, he wrote that [...] "Perennial suffering has as much right to expression as a tortured <b>man</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> scream"; [...] while in [...] "Commitment," [...] he wrote in 1962 that the dictum [...] "expresses in negative form the impulse which inspires committed literature"—was part of post-war Germany's struggle with history and culture. Adorno additionally befriended the writer and poet Hans Magnus Enzensberger as well as the film-maker Alexander Kluge.|$|E
2500|$|During a 2012 Christmas speech, the Pope made {{remarks about}} the present-day {{interpretation}} {{of the notion of}} [...] "gender". He stated that [...] "sex is no longer a given element of nature, that <b>man</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> accept and personally make sense of: it is a social role that we choose for ourselves", and [...] "The words of the creation account: “male and female he created them” (Gen 1:27) no longer apply". Although he didn't mention the topic, his words were interpreted by news media as denunciations of same-sex marriage, with some sources adding that Benedict would have called it a threat to world peace similar to abortion and euthanasia. In March 2012, he stated that heterosexual marriages should be defended from [...] "every possible misrepresentation of their true nature".|$|E

2500|$|Raymond v. Raymond mirrors Usher's 2004 Confessions, as a self-confessional album, {{with several}} {{recordings}} from the album inferring to Usher's marriage. Jive Records urban music president and album executive producer Mark Pitts also conceived the album as {{a return to}} the themes of the latter album; [...] "based on what happened with Confessions", Pitts wanted to reproduce its success. Pitts told The New York Times that [...] "Usher had a rough couple years", elaborating: [...] "The scrutiny of everything going on, he was worrying too much about what people were thinking. We felt like we had to get his swagger back. Dust off the bed and get it popping and young again." [...] Pitts noted that it was important Raymond v. Raymond addressed the rumors that circulated around Usher's marriage. The latter reiterated that the album is not specifically about his marriage, and that it is [...] "about the tug-of-war between man and woman, and the honesty a <b>man</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> have." ...|$|E
