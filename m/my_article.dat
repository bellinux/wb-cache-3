2500|$|I had the {{pleasure}} of meeting Raven Grimassi during the summer of 2001, unfortunately after the final draft of <b>my</b> <b>article</b> had already been submitted to The Pom. [...] He was very gracious and helpful to me. From information he revealed during our interview, I can say with reasonable certainty that I believe him to have been initiated into a domestic tradition of folk magic and healing such as I describe in <b>my</b> <b>article.</b>|$|E
2500|$|If {{you have}} seen <b>my</b> <b>article</b> in the Fortnightly, I would feel obliged by your noticing it in your letter this week. The cynical Saturday Review noticed it fairly enough, but I have seen no notice of it in any Irish paper." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Daily Mail then {{removed all}} {{advertising}} from the online {{version of the}} article. The publication also attempted to alter the original article but this succeeded only in provoking the public further. Moir responded to the controversy by criticising what she claimed was [...] "clearly a heavily orchestrated internet campaign" [...] {{and said it was}} [...] "mischievous in the extreme to suggest that <b>my</b> <b>article</b> has homophobic and bigoted undertones".|$|E

2500|$|Hempel {{rejected}} this as {{a solution}} to the paradox, insisting that the proposition 'c is a raven and is black' must be considered [...] "by itself and without reference to any other information", and pointing out that it [...] "... was emphasized in section 5.2(b) of <b>my</b> <b>article</b> in Mind ... that the very appearance of paradoxicality in cases like that of the white shoe results in part from a failure to observe this maxim." ...|$|E
2500|$|As far as I can {{see there}} is no {{difference}} between a firing squad, an electric chair, a gas chamber, or hanging. Death is death and I would interpret the shedding of man's blood in legal executions as a figurative expression which means the taking of life. There {{seems to me to be}} no present significance as to whether an execution is by a firing squad or in some other way. I, of course, deleted <b>my</b> <b>article</b> on [...] "hanging" [...] from the Second Edition of Mormon Doctrine because of the reasoning here mentioned.|$|E
2500|$|His {{suspension}} {{came at a}} {{time when}} the electoral body, the IIEC, was is in an uproar and unsettled by anonymously authored complaints which the commissioners characterise as a hate campaign but which raise troubling questions on corruption and nepotism. Later Miguna, after suspension, issued a statement that said he [...] "was instructed to write <b>my</b> <b>article</b> on the IIEC chairman and the position he had taken with respect to the party's decision to kick out rebellious MPs and Councillors." [...] He later denied, according to the Nairobi Star.|$|E

60|$|The {{contents}} of the present collection have all been in print before, either in the Nineteenth Century and Fortnightly Review, or in some other shape. I have to thank the proprietors of the two periodicals named for sanctioning the reproduction of <b>my</b> <b>articles</b> here.|$|R
2500|$|Did Amichai want {{to become}} a {{national}} poet?... his poetry embodied a silent but piercing revolution against the social and political institutions that enslave the life and happiness of the individual for their need – He should bother so much to build for himself the mythology of a national poet? All the things that Gold thinks he was hiding were not in any contrast to the unique [...] "nationality" [...] embodied in his poetry. I did not find in Gold's book an explanation to the concept 'national poet' but in the first place, this concept appears in her book she is pointing to <b>my</b> <b>article</b> (1997) that says: [...] "of all the poets who began to at the time of Amichai, or in later years, since Alterman there was not a poet more popular than Amichai. In this he is unique. He is probably the only canonic poet read by so many, also by people that do not belong to the Literary Community. In this matter he has no rivals. From this aspect, at least, he may be considered a national poet, a title that does not suite him from any other point of view..." [...] Gold's use of that title is not clear and not responsible." ...|$|E

60|$|He did {{the next}} best thing, however: he took a place in a sailing dahabeeah; and as we steamed up slowly, {{stopping}} often on the way, to give me time to write <b>my</b> <b>articles,</b> he managed to arrive almost always at every town or ruin exactly when we did.|$|R
6000|$|... "Never mind that. I shall {{write to}} the Warden {{pleading}} urgent private business.

6000|$|... "I am sixteen," [...] he answered, [...] "and I {{know what}} I am about. Mother is no help to you. She doesn't {{understand}} how to look after you. I wish now that I {{was not going to}} Australia at all. I have a great mind to chuck the whole thing up. I would, if <b>my</b> <b>articles</b> hadn't been signed." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I have no grudge {{whatever}} {{against my}} party," [...] Julien said. [...] "You {{seem to have}} been misinformed upon that subject. Besides, I am an Englishman and a patriot.

6000|$|... "It is {{the truth}} and easily proved," [...] Tallente retorted. [...] "When peace came, however, Miller's party altered their tactics and the hatchet {{was to have been}} buried. <b>My</b> <b>article</b> was {{directed}} against the trades unions as they were at that time, not as they are to-day, and I still claim that if public opinion had not driven them into an arrangement with the Government, <b>my</b> <b>article</b> would have been published and would have done good. To publish it now could answer no useful purpose. Its application is gone and the conditions which prompted its tone disappeared." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I shan't spend money," [...] said Griffenbottom; [...] "it's {{out of the}} question. They can't touch me. I've {{spent my}} money, and got <b>my</b> <b>article.</b> If others want the article, they must spend theirs." ...|$|E
60|$|On Saturday I was {{not only}} {{surprised}} and delighted {{by the sight of}} <b>my</b> <b>article</b> in large type {{at the head of the}} literary page, I was fluttered by the word which Mr. Clement had sent to me.|$|E
60|$|Lathyrus grandiflorus (Leguminosae).--Is in {{this country}} more or less sterile.

40|$|Multivectors are scalars, vectors, {{and fully}} antisymmetric tensors. Represen-tation of space-time multivectors in Cliord algebra or by hypercomplex num-bers gives useful tool for {{theoretical}} and mathematical physics. In particular, this representation permits {{to consider the}} linear and nonlinear electrodynamics in coordinate-free space-time invariant form (see <b>my</b> <b>articles</b> [1, 2] and references contained therein). Generators of rotation group in Cliord algebra formalism for space-time multivectors are presented. Corresponding multivector spherical functions are obtained...|$|R
