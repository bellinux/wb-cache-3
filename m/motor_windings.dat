25|$|Electrolytic-tough pitch (ETP) copper, a high-purity copper that {{contains}} oxygen as an alloying agent, represents {{the bulk of}} electrical conductor applications because of its high electrical conductivity and improved annealability. ETP copper is used for power transmission, power distribution, and telecommunications. Common applications include building wire, <b>motor</b> <b>windings,</b> electrical cables, and busbars. Oxygen-free coppers are used to resist hydrogen embrittlement when extensive amounts of cold work is needed, and for applications requiring higher ductility (e.g., telecommunications cable). When hydrogen embrittlement is a concern and low electrical resistivity is not required, phosphorus may be added to copper.|$|E
500|$|The carrier-frequency pulsed {{output voltage}} of a PWM VFD causes rapid rise times in these pulses, the {{transmission}} line effects of which must be considered. Since the transmission-line impedance of the cable and motor are different, pulses tend to reflect back from the motor terminals into the cable. The resulting voltages can produce overvoltages equal to twice the DC bus voltage or up to 3.1times the rated line voltage for long cable runs, putting high stress on the cable and <b>motor</b> <b>windings,</b> and eventual insulation failure. [...] Insulation [...] standards for three-phase motors rated 230V or less adequately protect against such long-lead overvoltages. [...] On 460V or 575V systems and inverters with 3rd-generation 0.1-microsecond-rise-time IGBTs, the maximum recommended cable distance between VFD and motor is about 50m or 150feet. Solutions to overvoltages caused by long lead lengths include minimizing cable distance, lowering carrier frequency, installing dV/dt filters, using inverter-duty-rated motors (that are rated 600V to withstand pulse trains with rise time {{less than or equal}} to 0.1microsecond, of 1,600V peak magnitude), and installing LCR low-pass sine wave filters. Regarding lowering of carrier frequency, note that audible noise is noticeably increased for carrier frequencies less than about 6kHz and is most noticeable at about 3kHz. Selection of optimum PWM carrier frequency for ACdrives involves balancing noise, heat, motor insulation stress, common-mode voltage-induced motor bearing current damage, smooth motor operation, and other factors. Further harmonics attenuation can be obtained by using an LCR low-pass sine wave filter or dV/dtfilter.|$|E

50|$|To {{extend a}} DC motor’s service life, {{protective}} devices and motor controllers {{are used to}} protect it from mechanical damage, excessive moisture, high dielectric stress and high temperature or thermal overloading. These protective devices sense motor fault conditions and either annunciate an alarm to notify the operator or automatically de-energize the motor when a faulty condition occurs. For overloaded conditions, motors are protected with thermal overload relays. Bi-metal thermal overload protectors are embedded in the <b>motor's</b> <b>windings</b> and made from two dissimilar metals. They are designed such that the bimetallic strips will bend in opposite directions when a temperature set point is reached to open the control circuit and de-energize the motor. Heaters are external thermal overload protectors connected in series with the <b>motor’s</b> <b>windings</b> and mounted in the motor contactor. Solder pot heaters melt in an overload condition, which cause the motor control circuit to de-energize the motor. Bimetallic heaters function the same way as embedded bimetallic protectors. Fuses and circuit breakers are overcurrent or short circuit protectors. Ground fault relays also provide overcurrent protection. They monitor the electric current between the <b>motor’s</b> <b>windings</b> and earth system ground. In motor-generators, reverse current relays prevent the battery from discharging and motorizing the generator. Since D.C. motor field loss can cause a hazardous runaway or overspeed condition, loss of field relays are connected in parallel with the motor’s field to sense field current. When the field current decreases below a set point, the relay will deenergize the motor’s armature. A locked rotor condition prevents a motor from accelerating after its starting sequence has been initiated. Distance relays protect motors from locked-rotor faults. Undervoltage motor protection is typically incorporated into motor controllers or starters. In addition, motors can be protected from overvoltages or surges with isolation transformers, power conditioning equipment, MOVs, arresters and harmonic filters. Environmental conditions, such as dust, explosive vapors, water, and high ambient temperatures, can adversely affect the operation of a DC motor. To protect a motor from these environmental conditions, the National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA) and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) have standardized motor enclosure designs based upon the environmental protection they provide from contaminants. Modern software can also be used in the design stage, such as Motor-CAD, to help increase the thermal efficiency of a motor.|$|R

2500|$|At standstill, main {{generator}} output is initially low voltage/high current, often {{in excess of}} 1000 amperes per motor at full power. [...] When the locomotive is at or near standstill, current flow will be limited only by the DC resistance of the <b>motor</b> <b>windings</b> and interconnecting circuitry, {{as well as the}} capacity of the {{main generator}} itself. [...] Torque in a series-wound motor is approximately proportional to the square of the current. Hence, the traction motors will produce their highest torque, causing the locomotive to develop maximum tractive effort, enabling it to overcome the inertia of the train. This effect is analogous to what happens in an automobile automatic transmission at start-up, where it is in first gear and thus producing maximum torque multiplication.|$|E

5000|$|Torsional {{vibrations}} of {{drive systems}} usually {{result in a}} significant fluctuation of the rotational speed of the rotor of the driving electric motor. Such oscillations of the angular speed superimposed on the average rotor rotational speed cause more or less severe perturbation of the electromagnetic flux and thus additional oscillations of the electric currents in the <b>motor</b> <b>windings.</b> Then, the generated electromagnetic torque is also characterized by additional variable in time components which induce torsional vibrations of the drive system. According to the above, mechanical vibrations of the drive system become coupled with the electrical vibrations of currents in the <b>motor</b> <b>windings.</b> Such a coupling is often complicated in character and thus computationally troublesome. Because of this reason, till present majority of authors used to simplify the matter regarding mechanical vibrations of drive systems and electric current vibrations in the <b>motor</b> <b>windings</b> as mutually uncoupled. Then, the mechanical engineers applied the electromagnetic torques generated by the electric motors as ‘a priori‘ assumed excitation functions of time or of the rotor-to-stator slip, e.g. in paper [...] usually basing on numerous experimental measurements carried out for the given electric motor dynamic behaviours. For this purpose, by means of measurement results, proper approximate formulas have been developed, which describe respective electromagnetic external excitations produced by the electric motor,. However, the electricians thoroughly modelled electric current flows in the electric <b>motor</b> <b>windings,</b> but they usually reduced the mechanical drive system to one or seldom to at most a few rotating rigid bodies, as e.g. in [...] In many cases, such simplifications yield sufficiently useful results for engineering applications, but very often they can lead to remarkable inaccuracies, since many qualitative dynamic properties of the mechanical systems, e.g. their mass distribution, torsional flexibility and damping effects, are being neglected. Thus, an influence of drive system vibratory behaviour on the electric machine rotor angular speed fluctuation, {{and in this way}} on the electric current oscillations in the rotor and stator windings, can not be investigated with a satisfactory precision.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} an {{optimized}} five-level inverter topology is proposed for a four pole induction motor drive. This topology has developed {{by using the}} advantage of two identical voltage profile winding coils per phase in a four pole induction motor. The identical voltage profile winding coils are disconnected and {{each part of the}} winding is fed with two two-level inverters from both sides. Thereby four two-level inverters are used to generate five voltage levels on induction <b>motor</b> phase <b>windings.</b> All two-level inverters are fed with single DC link with the magnitude V dc over 4 (where V dc is the dc-bus voltage required for a conventional NPC five-level inverter).

40|$|A dual {{two-level}} inverter fed induction <b>motor</b> with open-end <b>windings</b> {{is capable}} of generating a three-level output voltage. Several, sine-triangle and space vector pulse width modulation (PWM) switching strategies are presented for the dual-inverter scheme either using space-vector or carrier-based implementation. In this paper, a hybrid PWM switching strategy for the dual-inverter scheme is proposed employing sine-triangle PWM (SPWM) and space vector PWM (SVPWM) for the individual inverters. SPWM is theoretically analyzed and space vector based implementation of SPWM is presented using a simple offset-time concept. This is exploited to implement the hybrid PWM switching strategy for the dual two-level inverter. The implementation of the hybrid PWM switching strategy proposed in this paper do not require any look-up tables, the switching is totally automatic obviating the time-consuming task of sector identification. The implementation of the hybrid PWM scheme requires only the three instantaneous phase reference voltages corresponding to the reference space vector. The third harmonic component in the voltage appearing across the <b>motor</b> phase <b>windings</b> in the induction motor is significantly reduced (by 50 %) {{with the use of}} the proposed hybrid PWM scheme as compared to the use of the PWM scheme presented earlier.
