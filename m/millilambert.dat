40|$|The {{sun-fish}} Lepomis {{responds to}} a moving system of stripes by a motion of its body. By changing {{the velocity of}} motion of the stripe system different flicker frequencies can be produced and thus the relation of flicker frequency to critical intensity of illumination can be studied. Threshold illumination varies with flicker frequency {{in such a way}} that with increasing flicker frequency the intensity of illumination must be increased to produce a threshold response in the fish. The curve of critical illumination as a function of frequency is made up of two distinct parts. For an intensity range below 0. 04 <b>millilambert</b> and flicker frequencies below 10 per second, the rods are in function. For higher intensities and flicker frequencies above 10, the cones come into play. The maximum frequency of flicker which can be perceived by the fish's eye is slightly above 50 per second. The flicker curve for the eye of Lepomis can easily be compared with that for the human eye. The extent of the curve for the fish is greater at low illuminations, the fish being capable of distinguishing flicker at illuminations lower than can the human eye. The transition of rod vision to cone vision occurs for the fish and for the human eye at the same intensity and flicker frequency. The maximum frequency of flicker which can be perceived is for both about the same...|$|E
5000|$|In a widely-admired paper {{published}} in 1948, Wallach explored the stimulus {{conditions for the}} perception of neutral colors - that is, colors that vary in lightness but have no hue, thus ranging from white to gray to black. Wallach projected round patches of light (“disks”) of various brightnesses on a white screen {{in a dark room}} and found that, when presented alone, the disks always appeared to be luminous - i.e. they seemed to be emitting light, just as the moon appears when it is high in a dark sky. However, when a surrounding ring of a different brightness was added to such a projected disk, the disk ceased to appear luminous and looked like a patch of smooth paper whose color depended on the relative brightnesses of the central disk and the surrounding ring [...]If the surround was less bright than the disk in the center, the disk appeared white. If the surround was brighter than the center, the central disk appeared to be a shade of gray. The shade of gray depended on the brightness ratio of the center to the surround, regardless of the absolute luminance levels of the two elements in the display. Thus, for example, a disk with a physical luminance of 50 <b>millilamberts</b> (mL) surrounded by a ring of 200 mL would seem to be the same shade of gray as a disk of 500 mL surrounded by a ring of 2000 mL.|$|R
