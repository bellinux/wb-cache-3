40|$|Abstract Nowadays, {{three-dimensional}} computer added design(3 D CAD) tool {{are widely}} and actively used for design of mechanical machine. Because using the tool {{is more effective}} to understand design concept and to collaborate with other operation than using two-dimensional design tool. In this study, the 3 D CAD tool which is called I-DEAS was applied for three-dimensional modeling of main parts and assembling of modeled parts for identification the entire shape of a injection molding machine. In addition, a study was also performed regarding reduction for the weight of <b>main</b> <b>plates</b> for saving production cost and energy in the machine. A finite element method(FEM) program in I-DEAS tool {{was used for the}} improvement study. First, the current <b>main</b> <b>plates</b> were structural analysed and then the plate deformations, weak regions and stress distributions were graped. By the FEM results, the 2 nd improved designing of the plates was conducted such as reinforcement or slimming of the plate wall thickness. The 2 nd structural FEM was performed for verification of the redesigned plates and then the FEM results were compared with the 1 st FEM’s result. The weight of the <b>main</b> <b>plates</b> were averagely reduced approximately 3 - 7 %. By these results, it was seemed that the improved plates have...|$|R

If these deformations have over limit range, life of the press itself can be reduced {{and it will be}} exerted on a bad effect for quality of the semiconductor. In this research, the <b>main</b> <b>plates</b> and links of a press are analyzed in relation to the structural deformations caused by pressure excluding thermal deformations. After modifying the modeling, the analysis is performed again to determine optimal design of the press, and this design is introduced to ensure that most of the stresses on the <b>main</b> <b>plates</b> are within safe allowable limits. As a result, an optimal design method for the structure is investigated to produce the desired pressure even when the size of the main structure is minimized...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the effects of}} specifications of a fuel supply unit with a new fuel supply concept for a dry low NOx gas turbine combustor. From experiments made with a plane model, most of the specifications of the fuel supply elements strongly affected the fuel distribution ratio between the main and pilot regions, which could affect combustion performance. However, the distribution ratio was hardly changed by the <b>main</b> <b>plates</b> attached at the exit of fuel passage holes, though the fuel distribution in the main region was greatly changed by the plates. From the pressurized combustion test, the <b>main</b> <b>plates</b> decreased NOx emissions at high loads, not affecting any harmful influence on combustion efficiency, BOT, and the pattern factor at high loads. It was estimated {{that the cause of}} low NOx could be the uniformity of the equivalence ratio in the main region in the circumferential direction...|$|R
