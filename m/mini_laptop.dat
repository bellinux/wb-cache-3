40|$|During {{the last}} decade, {{increasingly}} more {{public and private}} actors, in both developed or developing countries, have supported initiatives 1 : 1 in education (a computer for each student). This initiatives represent a qualitative leap from the prior educative experiences with the {{information and communication technologies}} (TIC), because each child has access to a personal device, normally portable, <b>mini</b> <b>laptops</b> or mobile devices. The document tries to systematize the most outstanding evidence about such initiatives from the official web sites, program valuations and academic meta-evaluations. Includes information about the expectations of these policies, the designs of the programs and the challenges for an effective implementation of the model 1 : 1. Due to the limited evidence available, the document emphasizes some doubts, without response,about effectiveness-cost and educational impacts that these programs have in education...|$|R
40|$|Nowadays {{people seem}} to be more {{dependent}} on smart phones rather than any other electronic devices. Smart phones act like <b>mini</b> <b>laptops</b> with the mobilecommunication facility. Moreover, people possess more than one SIM card/Smart phone for many purposes. So non-ambiguity between various roles performed by them is crucial. For an example, person can have smart phone for his personal use at the residence and another phone for his official use. Consider a scenario: person at the residence urgently needs the official contact information available on the phone at his office (remote place). This application plays major dual role by acting as Server (official Smart phone) and Client (personal Smart phone). Irrespective of geographic area, the server smart phone (SSP) provides various services based on the request received from the client smart phone (CSP). The CSP send various requests through the SMS communication. Various requests can be fetching information from SSP such as log for unread messages and missed calls, unread message content, contact numbers, SIM and IMEI numbers. When the SSP is on silent mode and got misplaced, the CSP can be used to change the sound profile of SSP from silent to ringing mode by sending a request through SMS. If the SSP is in audible distance, then a phone call to it will help us to find the misplaced phone. Besides, the CSP can delete secret data available in the SSP’s memory. This application is different from other applications because it provides User Interface having options to send request through SMS and web database login through internet connectivity for phone’s data backup to provide unlimited memory. Upload any information such as contacts and messages from the smart phone into web database and save phone’s memory space. This application will upload the information in encoded format over the internet, which can be decoded using the application’s login password for security purpose...|$|R
