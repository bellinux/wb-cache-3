In the present study, <b>multilayered</b> <b>tablets</b> of pioglitazone hydrochloride 15 [*]mg and metformin hydrochloride 500 [*]mg were prepared in an attempt for combination therapy for {{the treatment of}} type 2 diabetes mellitus. Pioglitazone HCl was formulated as immediate release layer to show immediate action by direct compression method using combination of superdisintegrants, namely, crospovidone and avicel PH 102. Crospovidone at 20 % concentration showed good drug release profile at 2 [*]hrs. Metformin HCl was formulated as controlled release layer to prolong the drug action by incorporating hydrophilic polymers such as HPMC K 4 M by direct compression method and guar gum by wet granulation method in order to sustain the drug release from the tablets and maintain its integrity so as to provide a suitable formulation. The <b>multilayered</b> <b>tablets</b> were prepared after carrying out the optimization of immediate release layer and were evaluated for various precompression and postcompression parameters. Formulation F 13 showed 99. 97 % of pioglitazone release at 2 [*]hrs in 0. 1 [*]N HCl and metformin showed 98. 81 % drug release at 10 [*]hrs of dissolution in 6. 8 [*]pH phosphate buffer. The developed formulation is equivalent to innovator product in view of in vitro drug release profile. The results of all these evaluation tests are within the standards. The procedure followed for the formulation of these tablets was found to be reproducible and all the formulations were stable after accelerated stability studies.

Buccal devices were evaluated by different parameters such as weight uniformity, content uniformity, thickness, hardness, surface pH, swelling index, ex vivo mucoadhesive strength, ex vivo mucoadhesion time, in vitro drug release, and in vitro drug permeation. As compared with bilayered <b>tablets,</b> <b>multilayered</b> <b>tablets</b> showed slow release rate of drug with improved ex vivo bioadhesive strength and enhanced ex vivo mucoadhesion time. The mechanism of drug release was found to be non-Fickian diffusion (value of n between 0. 5 and 1. 0) for both the buccal devices. The stability of drug in both the optimized buccal devices was tested for 6 hours in natural human saliva; both the buccal devices were found to be stable in natural human saliva.

The time-domain reflection signal of coherent pulsed light in the far infrared was used to investigate film-coated <b>tablets,</b> sugar-coated <b>tablets,</b> <b>multilayered</b> controlled release <b>tablets,</b> and soft gelatin capsules. It is possible to determine the spatial and statistical distribution of coating thickness in single andmultiple coatedproductsusing 3 DTPI.

40|$|Purpose: The {{objective}} of the present investigation is to develop colon targeted drug delivery system by using combination of natural polymers as a carriers for 5 -Flourouracil (5 -FU). Site‐specific delivery of 5 ‐FU to the colon overcomes the side effects associated with the parenteral delivery of the drug, which include gastrointestinal toxicity, hematological and neural disorders and cardiac manifestations. Methods: Matrix tablets containing various proportions of Pectin and Xanthan gum were prepared by direct compression technique. <b>Multilayer</b> <b>tablets</b> were formulated using pectin as release controlling layers, {{on either side of}} 5 - Flourouracil matrix tablets. The matrix tablets were evaluated by different In Process Quality Control tests, content uniformity and in vitro drug release study. Comparison of pectin <b>multilayer</b> <b>tablets</b> collected at the end of test performed in {{the presence or absence of}} pectinolytic enzymes made it possible to visibly appreciate theeffect of enzymatic activity on the the aspect of the residual matrix. Results and Conclusion: The FTIR spectra’s study revealed that there were no interaction between polymers and drug. The tablets passed all the pharmacopoeial tests. The matrix tablets containing various proportions of Pectin and xanthan gum failed to control drug release in the physiological environment of the stomach and small intestine. On the other hand, multilayer formulations were able to protect the tablet cores from premature drug release. The multilayer tabletsin the presence of pectinolytic enzymes, undergoes a faster erosion process which resulted in marked increase inthe drug release rate...|$|R

40|$|The oral drug {{delivery}} system using bilayer (or <b>multilayer)</b> <b>tablets</b> has become more commonly used in therapeutic strategies. However, {{one of the most}} common problems associated with bilayer tablets is the insufficient interfacial strength between layers, which leads to product failure during manufacturing. Therefore, it is important to better understand the interfacial strength of bilayer pharmaceutical tablets. For this purpose, in this study, the interfacial strength of bilayer tablets made of microcrystalline cellulose (MCC PH 102) at various manufacturing conditions was systematically examined. Three cases were considered: (1) the effect of interfacial curvature on the interfacial strength, for which the interfaces between two layers with different curvatures were produced using flat, convex and concave punches. (2) The effect of water content on the interfacial strength, for which the powder was conditioned at various relative humidity before being used to produce bilayer tablets. (3) The effect of the particle size of the powder used in first layer on the interfacial strength, for which the feed powder was sieved to obtain powders with specific particle sizes that were then used to produce the first layer of the bilayer tablets. For all cases considered, direct tensile tests were performed to measure the tablet interfacial strength. It is found that the interfacial curvature, the water content and the particle size in the first layer affected the interfacial strength significantly. It is also shown that the tablet interfacial strength was increased when larger particles were used in the first layer, or when curved punches (i. e. either convex or concave punches) were used to produce curved interfaces with increased interfacial areas. In addition, a higher interfacial strength can also be achieved by properly controlling water content in the powder...|$|R

40|$|Patient {{compliance}} is a {{major factor}} in achieving optimal therapeutic outcomes. Pill burden, due to multiple drug therapies, has a great detrimental impact on compliance of the patient. Dose-dependent side-effects, associated with peak-trough plasma fluctuations of drugs, also {{have a negative impact on}} patient compliance with drug therapy. It is under these circumstances that zero-order drug release kinetics proves to be ideal. This is due to the lack of peak-trough fluctuations that occur with zero-order drug release, thereby minimizing the side-effects of drug therapy. Furthermore, a drug delivery system that may deliver more than one drug at a time may be beneficial to alleviate the pill burden associated with chronic diseases or specific health conditions. Novel drug delivery systems have been developed that offer zero-order or linear drug release. Amongst such systems are <b>multilayered</b> <b>tablets.</b> However these systems generally offer the delivery of just one drug. The development of a delivery system that is able to deliver up to three drugs in a zero-order manner may prove to be significantly beneficial to greatly increase patient compliance and in turn therapeutic efficacy. The purpose of this study was to design a novel triple-layered tablet (TLT) matrix targeted at achieving stratified zero-order drug release. The central factor for the establishment of the TLT was the selection of ideal and novel polymers that are capable of acting as superior drug release matrices. Modified polyamide 6, 10 (PA 6, 10) and salted-out poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) were employed as the outer drug-carrier matrices whereas poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) was used as the middle layer drug matrix. Specialized granulation techniques and direct compression were employed to prepare the TLT matrices. Diphenhydramine HCl, ranitidine HCl and promethazine were chosen as model drugs for the study due to their similar high aqueous solubilities (100 mg/mL). Matrix hardness, gel strength, swelling/erosion characteristics, Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy, Differential Scanning Calorimetry and in vitro drug release analysis employing High Performance Liquid Chromatography were performed on the TLT matrices in order to determine the physicomechanical and physicochemical nature of the TLT matrices. Computational molecular modeling (CMM) was employed to characterize the formation and dissolution of the TLT matrices. A box-Behnken experimental design was employed that resulted in the generation of 17 design formulations for ultimate optimization. In vivo animal studies were performed in the Large White Pig model to assess drug release behavior of the TLT. Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography was employed for plasma sample analysis.

The MLMDT was designed to achieve two pulses of drug release separated by a lag phase. The polymer disk comprised hydroxyethylcellulose (HEC) and ethylcellulose (EC) granulated using an aqueous dispersion of EC. The polymeric barrier layers constituted a combination of pectin/Avicel (PBL) (1 st barrier layer) and hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (HPMC) (HBL 1 and HBL 2) as the 2 nd and 3 rd barrier layers, respectively. Sodium bicarbonate was incorporated into the diltiazem-containing formulation for delayed drug release.

40|$|Abstract—Terahertz pulsed imaging (TPI) was {{evaluated}} for nondestructively characterizing the 3 -D internal structures of pharmaceutical tablets. The structural information of a pharma-ceutical tablet, such as coating thickness and interface uniformity, was obtained {{directly from the}} analysis of the time-domain tera-hertz waveform. The chemical map of a sample was obtained by using frequency-domain terahertz spectra, together with spectral matching techniques such as cosine correlation mapping. The axial spatial resolution achieved was 30 µm, limited by the confinement of terahertz pulses in time (pulse width); and the lateral spatial resolution was determined to be 150 µm at 90 cm− 1 (2. 7 THz), limited by the confinement of terahertz pulses in space (focus size, which is diffraction limited and thus frequency dependent). In addition, the buried structure within a tablet was mapped using the TPI, and its chemical composition was successfully identified through spectral-time analysis of the recorded terahertz waveform. We also present a rigorous electromagnetic theory for simulating the terahertz propagation in a multilayered sample, to facilitate terahertz data analysis and interpretation. In conclusion, the TPI is a powerful tool for assaying the tablet coating layer thickness and interface uniformity, and for identifying polymorphs.
