25|$|Constructed of {{light-gauge}} painted sheet steel, Joroleman designed his mailbox with an arched, tunnel-shape roof, which prevented excessive {{accumulation of}} rainwater or snow while resisting deformation. The tunnel top also simplified {{the process of}} mass production by {{eliminating the need for}} precise sheet metal bends. Stamped and formed <b>metal</b> <b>straps</b> riveted to the arched opening and the mailbox door served as a door latching mechanism, while a rotating red semaphore flag mounted on a shaft attached {{to the side of the}} mailbox served to signal the approaching mailman if there was outgoing mail inside. Fitted with a crimped or braze-on rear steel panel and a false floor to keep its contents dry in inclement or humid weather, the Joroleman mailbox required only two rivets, three axle bolts, and four screws and nuts for completion. Durable and inexpensive, the popularity of the Joroleman mailbox was further enhanced by a decision not to patent the design, but to make its specifications known to all potential manufacturers for competitive sale. Adopted across the United States, it has remained the top-selling mailbox since its introduction, and was also widely used in Canada prior to that country's decision to eliminate individual curbside delivery to rural residents.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode is}} one of many to feature Mulder as a Christ-like figure. These {{comparisons}} were first purposely inserted during the seventh season episode [...] "", in which Mulder is placed on a cross-like table, symbolic of the wooden cross that Jesus was nailed to. Michelle Bush, in her book Myth-X notes that Mulder's torture scenes in [...] "Within" [...] bear a resemblance to the Crucifixion of Jesus. She argues that the metal bars piercing his wrists and ankles are similar to the nails that held Jesus, the <b>metal</b> <b>straps</b> imbedded in his head are similar to the Crown of Thorns, and that his vivisection is reminiscent of the wound made by the Holy Lance. Furthermore, Bush parallels Jesus' [...] "horrific death in order to rise again" [...] to Mulder's abduction, death, and resurrection later on in [...] "Deadalive", which would further make allusions to the Christ-like nature of Mulder.|$|E

500|$|The Roller Coaster Corporation of America {{discussed}} {{the idea of}} a building the world's first wooden hypercoaster with Kings Island in 1997. The park announced plans to build Son of Beast on May 11, 1999. As part of a marketing campaign for the ride before its debut, a box was placed next to a footpath in the park. Beastly growling and snarling noises came from inside the box as it shook violently. During the announcement, the box was revealed to the audience along with a model of the roller coaster and a list of seven world records that would be broken when it came into operation. The sign at the ride's entrance featured a large wooden box covered with chains, rope, and <b>metal</b> <b>straps.</b> The front was ripped open with the name [...] "Son of Beast" [...] centered inside the box. Problems plagued the ride from the start and as a result, Paramount Parks, the park's then-owner, fired RCCA before construction was completed. The park had to make several design corrections during Son of Beast's initial year.|$|E
500|$|The {{head and}} arm {{had been built}} with {{assistance}} from Viollet-le-Duc, who fell ill in 1879. He soon died, leaving no indication of how he intended to transition from the copper skin to his proposed masonry pier. The following year, Bartholdi was able to obtain the services of the innovative designer and builder Gustave Eiffel. Eiffel and his structural engineer, Maurice Koechlin, decided to abandon the pier and instead build an iron truss tower. Eiffel opted not to use a completely rigid structure, which would force stresses to accumulate in the skin and lead eventually to cracking. A secondary skeleton {{was attached to the}} center pylon, then, to enable the statue to move slightly in the winds of New York Harbor and as the metal expanded on hot summer days, he loosely connected the support structure to the skin using flat iron bars which culminated in a mesh of <b>metal</b> <b>straps,</b> known as [...] "saddles", that were riveted to the skin, providing firm support. In a labor-intensive process, each saddle had to be crafted individually. To prevent galvanic corrosion between the copper skin and the iron support structure, Eiffel insulated the skin with asbestos impregnated with shellac.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the western}} United States, {{much of what}} is seen as masonry is {{actually}} brick or stone veneer. Current construction rules dictate the amount of tie–back required, which consist of <b>metal</b> <b>straps</b> secured to vertical structural elements. These straps extend into mortar courses, securing the veneer to the primary structure. Older structures may not secure this sufficiently for seismic safety. A weakly secured veneer in a house interior (sometimes used to face a fireplace from floor to ceiling) can be especially dangerous to occupants. Older masonry chimneys are also dangerous if they have substantial vertical extension above the roof. These are prone to breakage at the roofline and may fall into the house in a single large piece. For retrofit, additional supports may be added; [...] however, it is extremely expensive to strengthen an existing masonry chimney to conform with contemporary design standards. [...] It is best to simply remove the extension and replace it with lighter materials, with special metal flue replacing the flue tile and a wood structure replacing the masonry. This may be matched against existing brickwork by using very thin veneer (similar to a tile, but with the appearance of a brick).|$|E
50|$|Originally rubber {{bags were}} used to brace pallets inside trucks. They evolved into kraft paper bags with a plastic-bag interior.

50|$|For standees, {{the cars}} {{featured}} four poles by each side door and small handles {{on the ends}} of transverse seats. Due to higher than anticipated ridership, <b>metal</b> <b>straps</b> were added above longitudinal seats to improve standee accommodations in 1919-1920. All orders of Standards delivered later (cars 2600-2899, 4000-4049) came with <b>metal</b> <b>straps</b> already in place. During the late 1930s, many (but not all) of the cars saw the <b>metal</b> <b>straps</b> replaced with horizontal steel bars. These accommodated even more riders than the straps had, further improving the cars. With the earlier ACF built cars, all but around 93 of these cars underwent this conversion; of the later Pressed Steel cars, just under half were converted.|$|E

5000|$|Invented in {{the early}} 19th century, the tramp chair was a cage made of bent and riveted <b>metal</b> <b>strapping</b> {{into the shape of}} a chair. An {{individual}} could be placed inside the chair and locked up securely, the chair thus acting as a jail cell, particularly in towns too small to build a jail. It was sometimes placed on a wheeled platform so it could be moved around easily.|$|R
50|$|In 1999 {{a scheme}} was {{proposed}} for a housing estate on the site, with the chimney {{a feature of}} planned parkland.

50|$|In the {{electron}} gun, the free electrons are gained by thermo-emission from a hot <b>metal</b> <b>strap</b> (or wire). They are then accelerated and formed {{into a narrow}} convergent beam by an electric field produced by three electrodes: {{the electron}} emitting strap, the cathode connected to the negative pole of the high (accelerating) voltage power supply (30 - 200 kV) and the positive high voltage electrode, the anode. There is a third electrode charged negatively {{with respect to the}} cathode, called the Wehnelt or control electrode. Its negative potential controls the portion of emitted electrons entering into the accelerating field, i.e., the electron-beam current.|$|R
5000|$|Although {{the line}} {{had been planned}} to have double tracks, only one was ever built. As done on other early roads, strap rail {{construction}} was utilized. While this secured significant capital economies, it inevitably incurred greater operational risks, including the notorious [...] "snakehead", in which the <b>metal</b> <b>strap</b> upon which the rolling stock rode would come loose from its wood support and be projected up through the car floor by the first wheel to snag the strap's end. There was, prior to 1848, no legal obligation to report accidents; company records show only a single snakehead incident, occurring in June 1848.|$|R
5000|$|In the mid-1950s, further {{continental}} influences {{brought a}} more elegant image to light, lower-cut slip-ons, which moved from purely casual use to being paired with suits in the 1960s (but still only in America). [...] In 1966, Italian designer Gucci made the further step of adding a <b>metal</b> <b>strap</b> {{across the front}} {{in the shape of}} a horse's snaffle bit. These Gucci loafers (now a general term referring to shoes of this style by any manufacturer) also spread over the Atlantic and were worn by 1970s businessmen, becoming almost a Wall Street uniform, reaching widespread use by the 1980s.|$|R
