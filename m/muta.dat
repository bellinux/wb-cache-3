In September and October 2002, she wrestled several matches for the promotion. After losing to Masahiro Chono on October 14, 2002, Laurer performed her final match on October 26, teaming with a fake Great <b>Muta</b> played by Troy Enders in a loss to Hiroshi Tanahashi and Kenzo Suzuki.|$|E
25|$|The sixth {{match was}} between The Great <b>Muta</b> and Sting. The match started {{back and forth}} until The Great <b>Muta</b> {{performed}} an eye rake, and applied the bridging grounded double chickenwing. The Great <b>Muta</b> kept the advantage, and attempted a moonsault. Sting avoided it, but The Great <b>Muta</b> landed on his feet, and performed a spin kick. The Great <b>Muta</b> climbed the turnbuckles, but Sting performed a dropkick and a superplex. Sting then pinned The Great <b>Muta</b> to win the match.|$|E
40|$|M. Tech. Haemostasis {{refers to}} the {{prevention}} of spontaneous bleeding and control of traumatic haemorrhage. The haemostatic mechanism consists essentially of two proteolytic reactions. The first is the clotting mechanism, the end product of which is thrombin. The second is the fibrinolytic mechanism, the end product of which is plasmin. Snake venoms are rich sources of enzymes, which induce {{a wide range of}} pharmacological activities, including anticoagulant and haemorrhagic effects. It, has been established that Lachesis <b>mutas,</b> a remedy prepared from the venom of a pit viper snake of South-Arnerica, has an effect on the haemostatic mechanism. Lachesis <b>mutas</b> is used extensively in homoeopathy as a blood coagulator. The toxicologic symptoms of Lachesis <b>mutas</b> occur from the disorganisation of the blood. This in-vitro study aimed to determine the effect of homoeopathically prepared Lachesis <b>mutas</b> 6 CH, 9 CH, 12 CH on the coagulation of blood. Twenty volunteers, fulfilling specified criteria were recruited. Twenty millilitres of blood was drawn from each volunteer. The blood was then centrifuged and the plasma separated into five tubes. Tube one seined as the plasma control. The second tube contained saline, the third tube Lachesis <b>mutas</b> 6 CH, the fourth tube Lachesis <b>mutas</b> 9 CH, and Lachesis <b>mutas</b> 12 CH was added into the last tube. After an incubation period of one hour at room temperature, using the Automated Coagulation Laboratory (ACL) analyzer, the following tests were run on each tube: Prothrombin Time (PT) and Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (APTT). Statistical analysis revealed that the different homoeopathic potencies of Lachesis <b>mutas</b> did not {{have an effect on the}} coagulation of blood when tested in-vitro, specifically regarding the PT and APTT tests. This study did not yield substantial results. Further in-vitro, as well as in-vivo, studies need to be conducted to determine the potential therapeutic use of homoeopathic remedies on blood coagulation...|$|R

25|$|The fourth {{match was}} between The Great <b>Muta</b> and Ric Flair (accompanied by Ole and Arn Anderson). The Great <b>Muta</b> was being heralded as unpinned {{at this point}} in his WCW career. The match started with The Great <b>Muta</b> having the advantage. After a handspring back elbow from The Great <b>Muta,</b> Flair fought back, and applied an atomic drop and the figure four leglock. Buzz Sawyer and The Dragonmaster came down to help The Great <b>Muta,</b> but the Andersons fought them off. The {{distraction}} allowed The Great <b>Muta</b> to gain the advantage, and he attempted a moonsault, but Flair raised his knees. Flair then pinned The Great <b>Muta</b> with an inside cradle to win the match.|$|E
25|$|The sixth {{match was}} a {{standard}} {{match for the}} NWA World Television Championship. Sting defended the title against The Great <b>Muta.</b> Sting started the ring by flying over the ropes onto <b>Muta</b> in the second ring. Muta's manager Gary Hart distracted Sting, allowing <b>Muta</b> to deliver a Judo Chop. <b>Muta</b> tried to deliver a Moonsault for the victory but Sting {{moved out of the}} way. <b>Muta</b> started dominating the match but Sting delivered a Clothesline to gain advantage. Sting dropkicked <b>Muta</b> down and the two continued to exchange momentum and moves. The match started to change when <b>Muta</b> tried to deliver a Red Mist to Sting but Sting moved out and the referee Nick Patrick was hit with it. Sting attacked <b>Muta</b> and tried to deliver a Stinger Splash but <b>Muta</b> avoided it and delivered a Moonsault. Tommy Young replaced Nick Patrick as the referee and entered the ring to count the pinfall for <b>Muta</b> but Sting kicked out at 2 and became the first wrestler to kick out of Moonsault. <b>Muta</b> tried to deliver a Spin Kick but Sting countered it and delivered him a Belly To Back Suplex to win the match and retain the title. However, controversy surrounded the match as both men had their shoulders up at two count. The referees argued over it and <b>Muta</b> stole the title belt.|$|E
25|$|The tenth {{match was}} between The Great <b>Muta</b> and Lex Luger. The Great <b>Muta</b> had the early {{advantage}} by targeting Luger's injured left leg, applying the single leg Boston crab and the <b>Muta</b> Lock.

25|$|The third quarterfinal {{was between}} The Royal Family (Rip Morgan and Jack Victory) (New Zealand) {{and the team}} of Mr. Saito and The Great <b>Muta</b> (Japan). The match started with The Great <b>Muta</b> and Saito having the advantage. Morgan fought back with a belly to back suplex to Saito, and threw him outside, where Victory {{attacked}} him. After The Great <b>Muta</b> and Victory tagged in, The Great <b>Muta</b> performed a handspring back elbow, and all four came in. Morgan accidentally performed a clothesline to Victory, and The Great <b>Muta</b> pinned Victory with a bridging German suplex.|$|E
25|$|Another {{secondary}} rivalry {{heading into}} the event was between Sting and The Great <b>Muta</b> for the NWA World Television Championship. At WrestleWar, Sting retained the Television Championship against The Iron Sheik and <b>Muta</b> defeated Doug Gilbert. On May 13 edition of World Championship Wrestling, <b>Muta</b> and his manager Gary Hart challenged Sting to a Dragon Shi match. On May 20 edition of World Championship Wrestling, Sting challenged <b>Muta</b> to an immediate match but Hart claimed that he and <b>Muta</b> were not ready. On May 27 edition of World Championship Wrestling, {{it was announced that}} Eddie Gilbert had accepted Muta's open challenge for a Dragon Shi match. On June 14 edition of Clash of the Champions, an in-ring presentation of Dragon Shi was held, during which Gilbert accidentally struck a fireball into Trent Knight's face.

5000|$|In Roman mythology, Dea Tacita ("the silent goddess") was {{a goddess}} of the dead. Ovid's Fasti {{includes}} a passage describing a rite propitiating Dea Tacita {{in order to}} [...] "seal up hostile mouths / and unfriendly tongue" [...] at Feralia on 21 February. In later times, she was equated with the naiad Larunda. In this guise, Dea Tacita was worshipped at a festival called Larentalia on 23 December. Goddesses <b>Mutae</b> Tacitae were invoked to destroy a hated person: in an inscription from Cambodunum in Raetia, someone asks [...] "ut mutus sit Quartus" [...] and [...] "erret fugiens ut mus". These silent goddesses are the personification of terror of obscurity. Plutarch, who describes Tacita as a Muse, states that Numa Pompilius credited Tacita for his oracular insight and taught the Romans to worship her.|$|R

25|$|The thirteenth {{match was}} {{the final of the}} tournament between the team of Mr. Saito and The Great <b>Muta</b> and the Steiner Brothers. The match started back and forth until The Great <b>Muta</b> threw Rick outside the ring, and Saito and The Great <b>Muta</b> {{attacked}} him with the ringbell and ringpost. They had the advantage until Rick avoided a kick from The Great <b>Muta,</b> and performed a Steiner-Line. Scott tagged in, and performed a double underhook powerbomb. Saito tagged in, and performed a Saito suplex and an aided piledriver with The Great <b>Muta.</b> Saito dominated Scott until Rick tagged in, undetected by Saito.

25|$|In February 1988, Sting {{was given}} a push to main event status by placing him in a feud with Ric Flair and Four Horsemen. This {{continued}} until October 1988, when Sting began a feud with The Road Warriors. Throughout 1989, Flair had notable feuds with Ricky Steamboat and Terry Funk over the NWA World Heavyweight Championship while Sting feuded with The Great <b>Muta</b> over the NWA World Television Championship. At The Great American Bash in July, the alliance between Flair and Sting began. After Flair defeated Funk in the main event, he was attacked by The Great <b>Muta,</b> and Sting came out to help Flair. Sting and Flair feuded with The Great <b>Muta</b> and Funk afterwards, and the feud continued until Halloween Havoc in October, when they defeated The Great <b>Muta</b> and Funk in a Thunderdome match.|$|E
50|$|The lodge's {{structure}} {{made it a}} stronghold. The lodge, {{named after}} nearby Mount Asama, was a three-story wood and concrete edifice built {{into the side of}} the hill atop an exposed base of steel-reinforced concrete. The upper floor was slightly larger than the two below, giving the lodge a mushroom appearance. The building towered over the steep, snow-covered slopes below and the lodge's windows had heavy outer storm shutters. The building's maze-like floor plan and narrow staircases made it easy for the defenders to block off movement inside the building. The radicals would spend most of their time on the uppermost floor, which contained a kitchen, dining room, tatami-mat sleeping room, and a commanding view of the surrounding valley and hills. The radicals placed large pieces of furniture and futon bedding around the doors and windows and secured them in place with wire. When <b>Muta's</b> husband returned and saw the barricades he realized what had happened and quickly notified police. The police immediately set up roadblocks and surrounded the lodge to cut off any avenues of escape for the radicals inside.|$|R

Saito and Zangiev tagged in, and Saito performed a clothesline. Saito then pinned Zangiev after a Saito suplex to win the match.|$|E
25|$|Sting {{returned}} to singles matches in 1989, starting the year off by wrestling Flair to a one-hour draw in Atlanta's Omni on New Year's Day. He {{would also have}} his first experience in Japan with a brief tour in All Japan Pro Wrestling, with his most notable match in AJPW against Dan Spivey on January 25. After a long push, Sting won his first title in the NWA when he defeated Rotundo for the NWA Television Championship at a live event in March. Sting defended the Television title actively but tended to face sub-par challengers such as The Iron Sheik. In mid-1989, The Great <b>Muta</b> challenged Sting at The Great American Bash. The match was booked with a classic, controversial Dusty finish even though Rhodes (the namesake of the technique) had been fired months earlier. Sting got the three-count and was announced as the winner, but a replay showed Muta's shoulder was up at the count of two. The NWA decided to declare the title vacant. Sting and <b>Muta</b> battled in many rematches for the vacant Television title, but they always ended in disqualification, giving neither man the championship. Eventually, <b>Muta</b> won a No Disqualification match against Sting at a live event in September by using a blackjack to get the win and the title.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Previous {{work has}} {{indicated}} that PEP mutase catalyzes the rearrangement of phosphoenolpyruvate to phosphonopyruvate by a dissociative mechanism. The crystal structure of the mutase with Mg(II) and sulfopyruvate (a phosphonopyruvate analogue) bound showed that the substrate is anchored to the active site by the Mg(II), and shielded from solvent by a large loop (residues 115 - 133). Here, the crystal structures of wild-type and D 58 A mutases, in the apo state and in complex with Mg(II), are reported. In both unbound and Mg(II) -bound states, the active site is accessible to the solvent. The loop (residues 115 - 133), which in the enzyme-inhibitor complexes covers the active site cavity, is partially disordered or adopts a conformation that allows access to the cavity. In the apo state, the residues associated with Mg(II) binding are poised to accept the metal ion. When Mg(II) binds, the coordination {{is the same as}} that previously observed in the enzyme-Mg(II) sulfopyruvate complex, except that the coordination positions occupied by two ligand oxygen atoms are occupied by two water molecules. When the loop opens, three key active site residues are displaced from the active site, Lys 120, Asn 122, and Leu 124. Lys 120 mediates Mg(II) coordination. Asn 122 and Leu 124 surround the transferring phosphoryl group, and thus prevent substrate hydrolysis. Amino acid replacement of any one of these three loop residues results in a significant loss of catalytic activity. It is hypothesized that the loop serves to gate the <b>mutas...</b>|$|R

60|$|As {{regards the}} acting, {{the two things}} the Greeks valued most in actors were grace of gesture and music of voice. Indeed, to gain these virtues their actors used to subject {{themselves}} to a regular course of gymnastics and a particular regime of diet, health being to the Greeks not merely a quality of art, but a condition of its production. Whether or not our English actors hold the same view may be doubted; but Mr. Vezin certainly has always recognised {{the importance of a}} physical as well as of an intellectual training for the stage, and his performance of King Priam was distinguished by stately dignity and most musical enunciation. With Mr. Vezin, grace of gesture is an unconscious result--not a conscious effort. It has become nature, because it was once art. Mr. Beerbohm Tree also is deserving of very high praise for his Paris. Ease and elegance characterised every movement he made, and his voice was extremely effective. Mr. Tree is the perfect Proteus of actors. He can wear the dress of any century and the appearance of any age, and has a marvellous capacity of absorbing his personality into the character he is creating. To have method without mannerism is given only to a few, but among the few is Mr. Tree. Miss Alma Murray does not possess the physique requisite for our conception of Helen, but the beauty of her movements and the extremely sympathetic quality of her voice gave an indefinable charm to her performance. Mrs. Jopling looked like a poem from the Pantheon, and indeed the personae <b>mutae</b> were not the least effective figures in the play. Hecuba was hardly a success. In acting, the impression of sincerity is conveyed by tone, not by mere volume of voice, and whatever influence emotion has on utterance it is certainly not in the direction of false emphasis. Mrs. Beerbohm Tree's OEnone was much better, and had some fine moments of passion; but the harsh realistic shriek with which the nymph flung herself from the battlements, however effective it might have been in a comedy of Sardou, or in one of Mr. Burnand's farces, was quite out of place in the representation of a Greek tragedy. The classical drama is an imaginative, poetic art, which requires the grand style for its interpretation, and produces its effects by the most ideal means. It is in the operas of Wagner, not in popular melodrama, that any approximation to the Greek method can be found. Better to wear mask and buskin than to mar by any modernity of expression the calm majesty of Melpomene.|$|R
