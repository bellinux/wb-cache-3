40|$|Presented {{here is a}} robot {{friendly}} {{coupling device}} for an orbital replacement unit (ORU). The invention will provide a coupling that is detached and attached remotely by a robot. The design of the coupling must allow for slight misalignments, over-torque protection, and precision placement. This is accomplished {{by means of a}} triangular interface comprising three components. A base <b>plate</b> <b>assembly</b> is located on an attachment surface, such as a satellite. The base <b>plate</b> <b>assembly</b> has a cup member, a slotted member, and a post member. The ORU that the robot attaches to the base <b>plate</b> <b>assembly</b> has an ORU <b>plate</b> <b>assembly</b> with two cone members and a post member which mate to the base <b>plate</b> <b>assembly.</b> As the two plates approach one another, one cone member of the ORU <b>plate</b> <b>assembly</b> has to be placed accurately enough to fall into the cup member of the base <b>plate</b> <b>assembly.</b> The cup member forces alignment until a second cone falls into a slotted member which provides final alignment. A single bolt is used to attach the two plates. Two deflecting plates are attached to the backs of the plates. When pressure is applied {{to the center of the}} deflecting plates, the force is distributed preventing the ORU and base plates from deflecting. This accounts for precision in the placement of the article. The novelty is believed to reside in using deflecting plates in conjunction with kinematic mounts to provide distributed forces to the two members...|$|R

40|$|A Helmholtz {{resonator}} with a uniform, flexible {{end plate}} is studied in this work. This work {{shows that the}} flexible <b>plate</b> modifies the <b>frequency</b> response characteristics of the resonator, providing multiple distinct resonant frequencies instead of a single resonant frequency. Therefore, acoustical transmission loss will increase {{at each of the}} multiple resonant frequencies of the resonator and <b>plate</b> <b>assembly</b> versus at a single frequency for the unmodified Helmholtz resonator. By using receptance coupling as the modeling approach, the receptance of the Helmholtz resonator and flexible <b>plate</b> <b>assembly</b> is predicted by coupling receptance models of an unmodified Helmholtz resonator and a clamped plate. Finally, the predicted receptance of the Helmholtz resonator and flexible <b>plate</b> <b>assembly</b> is compared against experimental results...|$|R

40|$|New {{buckling}} interaction {{results are}} presented for skew <b>plates</b> and prismatic <b>assemblies</b> of <b>plates,</b> which illustrate the influence of continuity over supports {{for a range of}} aspect-ratio and loading combinations. The work follows from initial comparisons (York and Williams, 1995) with those in the literature for isolated plates and stiffened benchmark panels, consisting of prismatic <b>assemblies</b> of <b>plates.</b> The analysis method, which is an enhancement to the existing computer program VICONOPT, is based on an ‘exact’ analytical solution using Classical Plate Theory. This accounts for an infinitely long prismatic <b>plate</b> <b>assembly</b> supported at regular intervals over supports with general skew angle, alpha, forming a series of skew <b>plates</b> or <b>plate</b> <b>assemblies</b> joined end to end. This modelling can be described as exhibiting uni-axial continuity. The enhancement relates to a recent modification of the recurrence equations, which now accounts for infinitely wide skew <b>plate</b> <b>assemblies</b> supported at regular transverse intervals. This modelling possesses bi-axial continuity...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} determining the stiffness and strength of steel storage rack base <b>plate</b> <b>assemblies.</b> Base <b>plate</b> <b>assemblies</b> are usually bolted to an upright and to a concrete floor, and {{they are used to}} provide resistance against the flexural buckling of the upright and/or the overall down-aisle buckling of the frame. The semi-rigid stiffness is usually determined by means of a test of two pre-loaded uprights connected to a concrete block in a dual-actuator set-up. Guidance for conducting the test is provided in the European Standard EN 15512. However, several aspects of the test need clarification, notably the test set-up and the transducer arrangement for measuring the rotations of the base plate. This paper provides recommendations for how best to conduct the test, and proposes an alternative test method to that given in the EN 15512 Specification. The paper also identifies the contributions to the deformations of base <b>plate</b> <b>assemblies,</b> including the deformations of the supporting floor, the base <b>plate</b> <b>assembly</b> itself and the upright, and proposes simple expressions for calculating the stiffness associated with each contributing deformation where applicable. Furthermore, the paper proposes a deformation criterion for determining the ultimate design moment for base plate tests which do not attain a peak moment.

40|$|The dual-plate {{composite}} {{shear wall}} concept {{was introduced to}} reduce the construction time of tall buildings. A dual-plate composite shear wall is a concrete-filled steel <b>plate</b> <b>assembly.</b> The steel <b>plate</b> <b>assembly</b> is composed of two steel plates connected with steel rods spaced uniformly in orthogonal directions. The objective {{of this research was}} to develop details to be used in dual-plate composite shear walls and to investigate the behavior and adequacy of those details. ^ A 3 / 8 -scale dual-plate composite shear wall was constructed and tested as part of the experimental evaluation conducted during this research effort. First, foundation details and the connection between the specimen and foundation were designed and investigated. Next, details of the shear wall were selected using available standard design provisions. The behavior of dual-plate composite shear walls was investigated through four distinct experimental tests to study the following features: (a) stability of <b>plate</b> <b>assemblies</b> for resisting vertical construction loads, (b) strain compatibility between steel plates and concrete - to determine whether the steel plates and concrete act together for the selected details used in the <b>plate</b> <b>assembly,</b> (c) shear strength of horizontal splice connections between adjacent <b>plate</b> <b>assemblies,</b> and (d) behavior of dual-plate composite shear walls under cyclic load - to determine whether composite shear walls have sufficient strength and ductility to resist earthquake and wind loads. ^ From the experimental and analytical investigation of the stability behavior of a 3 / 8 -scale two-story dual-plate assembly, it was determined that the <b>plate</b> <b>assembly</b> was able to resist a maximum load of 18 times the maximum expected construction load. Behavior of the composite shear wall under cyclic lateral loading was investigated using a 3 / 8 -scale 5 - 1 / 2 story 30 -ft tall T-shaped shear wall specimen. It was determined from the test that if buckling of the plate could be prevented, then the design approach used for the test specimen can be used to design the structural components for dual-plate composite shear walls to resist cyclic lateral loads up to at least 2 % drift. ...|$|R

Charcoal treatment inhibited complementation only when no preformed tail plates were present in the extracts, and the inhibition was reversed by the addition of 9 × 10 − 6 m chemically synthesized pteroyl hexaglutamate. The stimulation is apparently due to a requirement for the pteroyl hexaglutamate for tail <b>plate</b> <b>assembly...</b>|$|R
