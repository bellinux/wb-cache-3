40|$|This paper aims {{to examine}} the {{dynamics}} of land transactions, machine investments, {{and the demand for}} <b>machine</b> <b>services</b> using farm panel data from China. Recently, China's agriculture has experienced a large expansion of machine rentals and <b>machine</b> <b>services</b> provided by specialized agents, which has contributed to mechanization of agricultural production. On the other hand, the empirical results show that an increase in non-agricultural wage rates leads to expansion of self-cultivated land size. A rise in the proportion of non-agricultural income or the migration rate also increases the size of self-cultivated land. Interestingly, however, relatively educated farm households decrease the size of self-cultivated land, which suggests that relatively less educated farmers tend to specialize in farming. The demand for <b>machine</b> <b>services</b> has also increased if agricultural wage and migration rate increased over time, especially among relatively large farms.

50|$|Reid Tool Supply {{was started}} in 1948 by Mr. Liberty Reid. As an office manager and {{purchasing}} agent in a local tool supply and die shop, he discovered {{that there were many}} tools/parts which were not readily available. This inspired him to start Reid Tool Supply in his home, {{with the help of his}} wife, Gloria. Mr. Reid stocked those hard-to-get tools and parts in inventory for immediate delivery. Great customer service was one of the founding principles of Reid Tool Supply. In about 4 years, Reid Tool Supply moved from Mr. Reid's house and into a newly constructed warehouse. By 2005, Reid Tool Supply was offering a wider range of industrial tools and parts, and changed its name to Reid Supply Company to reflect its expanded offerings.Reid Supply Company (global industrial parts distributor), United SignGraphics (signage, custom and large format printing), Reid Safety (outerwear, workwear, safety products), Total Quality Machining (<b>machining</b> <b>services</b> and customization of Reid Supply stock products) and Professional Parts Warehouse (snow plow parts and accessories) encompass the collection of Reid companies or Reid Entities. In August, 2014 it was announced that Filtrona PLC has purchased Reid Supply Company for $32 million USD.|$|E
40|$|In this work, an {{underactuated}} robot gripper {{was designed}} to meet specifications for strength, cost, and ease of manufacturing with Open-Source distribution in mind. The specifications emerged from a need for inexpensive grippers {{that can be used}} on robots that help people brace and balance. The structure and transmission of the gripper is designed to bear 150 lbs-force of static tensile and compressive loads. Gripping forces that exceed the static actuator force output are achieved by a novel method of clamping the main drive tendon by detecting dynamic overshoot and applying a self-helping cable brake, relieving the main drive actuator. The geometry, stiffness, and behavior of the gripper was designed using mathematical models and tools developed in prior art for the optimal design of underactuated hands. Apart from the actuators and waterjet <b>machining</b> <b>services,</b> the materials for the gripper can be purchased in one McMaster-Carr order. The entire structure can be cut from a single sheet of 1 / 16 " 2024 aluminum and requires one operation on a waterjet machine, which can be found in many machine shops or through online <b>machining</b> <b>services.</b> It is the intention of the author to release the design files as Open-Source in order to allow robot researchers, engineers, and enthusiasts to use this gripper in their own work. by Daniel Jesus Gonzalez.

40|$|Agricultural {{machines}} spend {{a significant}} part of their time on non-productive operations such as maneuvering near the boundaries of the field and loading or offloading of inputs or outputs (here referred to as servicing). This paper integrates existing methods for route optimization so as to minimize the time spent on turns and <b>machine</b> <b>servicing</b> on fields cultivated in straight rows. The following variables are optimized: (1) the orientation (angle) of the tracks, (2) the order of tracks, and (3) the types of turns between tracks. The angle of the tracks relative to field boundaries influences the number and lengths of the machine tracks, the number of turns and the positions where the <b>machine</b> can be <b>serviced.</b> Track order and the type of turns are selected to achieve overall efficiency. The algorithm was tested by computing routes for a set of fields of different sizes and assuming different operations. On small fields that do not require servicing, optimizing the turns between tracks resulted in a reduction of up to 50 % in turning time compared to the prevailing practice of navigation between adjacent tracks. A comparison of two sprayers in terms of servicing efficiency suggested that the algorithm can help selecting machinery for given field geometries. In some cases requiring <b>machine</b> <b>servicing,</b> the track orientation giving the shortest turning time did not produce the least servicing time. This illustrates that <b>machine</b> <b>servicing</b> should be taken into consideration for global optimization of machine traffic...|$|R
