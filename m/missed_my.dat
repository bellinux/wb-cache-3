I've always been a huge fan and was honored to sample one of her songs. She touched many generations and will be sadly <b>missed.</b> <b>My</b> love goes out to her family during this difficult time.

2500|$|On 30 July 1987, a {{day after}} Gandhi went to Sri Lanka and signed the Indo-Sri Lanka Accord, an honour guard named Vijitha Rohana hit him on his {{shoulder}} with his rifle; Gandhi's quick reflexes saved him from injury. The guard was then dragged by his security personnel. The guard said his intention was to kill Gandhi because of [...] "the damage he had caused" [...] to Sri Lanka. Wijemuni was imprisoned for two-and-a-half years for the assault Gandhi later said about the incident: When I was inspecting the guard of honour and as I walked past one person, I saw through {{the corner of my}} eye some movement. I ducked down a little bit in a reflex action. By my ducking, he <b>missed</b> <b>my</b> head and the brunt of the blow came on my shoulder below the left ear.|$|E
