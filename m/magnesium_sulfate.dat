5|$|The use {{of calcium}} channel blockers, {{thought to be}} able to prevent the spasm of blood vessels by {{preventing}} calcium from entering smooth muscle cells, has been proposed for prevention. The calcium channel blocker nimodipine when taken by mouth improves outcome if given between the fourth and twenty-first day after the bleeding, even if it does not reduce the amount of vasospasm detected on angiography. In traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage, nimodipine does not affect long-term outcome, and is not recommended. Other calcium channel blockers and <b>magnesium</b> <b>sulfate</b> have been studied, but are not presently recommended; neither is there any evidence that shows benefit if nimodipine is given intravenously.|$|E
5|$|Ganymede's surface has an albedo {{of about}} 43%. Water ice {{seems to be}} {{ubiquitous}} on its surface, with a mass fraction of 50–90 %, significantly more than in Ganymede as a whole. Near-infrared spectroscopy has revealed the presence of strong water ice absorption bands at wavelengths of 1.04, 1.25, 1.5, 2.0 and 3.0 μm. The grooved terrain is brighter and has a more icy composition than the dark terrain. The analysis of high-resolution, near-infrared and UV spectra obtained by the Galileo spacecraft and from Earth observations has revealed various non-water materials: carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide and, possibly, cyanogen, hydrogen sulfate and various organic compounds. Galileo results have also shown <b>magnesium</b> <b>sulfate</b> (MgSO4) and, possibly, sodium sulfate (Na2SO4) on Ganymede's surface. These salts may originate from the subsurface ocean.|$|E
5|$|Optimum {{growth of}} E. coli occurs at 37°C (98.6°F), but some {{laboratory}} strains can multiply at temperatures up to 49°C (120°F). E. coli {{grows in a}} variety of defined laboratory media, such as lysogeny broth, or any medium that contains glucose, ammonium phosphate, monobasic, sodium chloride, <b>magnesium</b> <b>sulfate,</b> potassium phosphate, dibasic, and water. Growth can be driven by aerobic or anaerobic respiration, using a large variety of redox pairs, including the oxidation of pyruvic acid, formic acid, hydrogen, and amino acids, and the reduction of substrates such as oxygen, nitrate, fumarate, dimethyl sulfoxide, and trimethylamine N-oxide. E. coli is classified as a facultative anaerobe. It uses oxygen when it is present and available. It can, however, continue to grow in the absence of oxygen using fermentation or anaerobic respiration. The ability to continue growing in the absence of oxygen is an advantage to bacteria because their survival is increased in environments where water predominates.|$|E
50|$|<b>Magnesium</b> <b>sulfates</b> {{are common}} {{minerals}} in geological environments. Their occurrence is mostly connected with supergene processes. Some {{of them are}} also important constituents of evaporitic potassium-magnesium (K-Mg) salts deposits.|$|R

30|$|According to {{literature}} data, single salts or mixtures {{of only a}} few salts were commonly utilized in the past for wood conservation [5]. The complex composition of the salt formulation applied to the Aspaas House is therefore an intriguing exception. Certainly, this intricate formulation was intended to provide effective protection against both fire and biological degradation. The preservative mixture applied to the material in Tronshart House, which is of a less architectural importance, consisted only of ammonium and <b>magnesium</b> <b>sulfates,</b> probably for economy reasons.|$|R
25|$|Because {{magnesium}} is {{a mobile}} nutrient, magnesium chloride can be effectively {{used as a}} substitute for <b>magnesium</b> <b>sulfate</b> (Epsom salt) to help correct magnesium deficiency in plants via foliar feeding. It is advisable to use a smaller dose when using magnesium chloride compared to the recommended dose of <b>magnesium</b> <b>sulfate</b> (20 g/L). This is due primarily to the chlorine present in magnesium chloride, which can easily reach toxic levels if over-applied and/or applied too often.|$|E
25|$|Magnesium chloride, <b>magnesium</b> <b>sulfate</b> {{and other}} mineral salts {{are present in}} the Upper Permian Basin and in the {{underlying}} playas of the High Plains.|$|E
25|$|For example, when barium {{chloride}} (BaCl2) and <b>magnesium</b> <b>sulfate</b> (MgSO4) react, the SO42− anion switches places with the 2Cl− anion, giving the compounds BaSO4 and MgCl2.|$|E
40|$|Cement {{is widely}} used {{everywhere}} for construction purposes and quality comparison of different ordinary Portland cements is very important. Five different brands of cement were tested for their chemical constituents such as silica, alumina, iron, calcium, <b>magnesium,</b> <b>sulfates,</b> insoluble residue, free lime and loss on ignition with American standards for testing and materials (ASTM). Results for five locally produced Portland cements revealed that the chemical compositions of most cement as determined by standard methods lie within standard limits. But the difference in constituents of various brands of cements is due to quality control setup differences of different cement plants...|$|R

25|$|Magnesium {{toxicity}} from magnesium salts is rare {{in healthy}} individuals with a normal diet, because excess magnesium is readily excreted in urine by the kidneys. A few cases of oral magnesium toxicity have been described in persons with normal renal function ingesting large amounts of magnesium salts, but it is rare. If {{a large amount of}} magnesium chloride is eaten, it will have effects similar to <b>magnesium</b> <b>sulfate,</b> causing diarrhea, although the sulfate also contributes to the laxative effect in <b>magnesium</b> <b>sulfate,</b> so the effect from the chloride is not as severe.|$|E

40|$|Calcium, {{magnesium}} and {{ferric iron}} sulfates {{have been detected}} by the instrument suites on the Mars rovers. A subset of the <b>magnesium</b> <b>sulfates</b> show clear associations with nickel. These associations indicate Ni(2 +) co-precipitation with or substitution for Mg(2 +) from sulfate-saturated solutions. Nickel is ex-tracted from primary rocks almost exclusively at pH values less than 6, constraining the formation of these Mg-Ni sulfates to mildly to strongly acidic conditions. There is clear evidence for aqueous alteration at the rim of Endeavour Crater (Meridiani Planum), in the Murray formation mudstone (Gale Crater), and near Home Plate (Gusev Crater). The discovery of Mg-Ni sulfates at these locations indicates a history of fluid-rock interactions at low pH...|$|R
25|$|Barium chloride, {{along with}} other {{water-soluble}} barium salts, is highly toxic. Sodium sulfate and <b>magnesium</b> <b>sulfate</b> are potential antidotes because they form the insoluble solid barium sulfate BaSO4, which is relatively non-toxic because of its insolubility.|$|E

25|$|In 1867 {{the company}} {{incurred}} financial losses {{from a bad}} investment in the United Kingdom and declining demand for its products. In the same year Julius Vorster Jr., {{the son of the}} founder Julius Vorster, became involved in the management of the company. On his recommendation the company began to produce <b>magnesium</b> <b>sulfate</b> {{in order to reduce the}} losses. <b>Magnesium</b> <b>sulfate</b> was primarily intended for the export to the United Kingdom, where it was used as a drying agent in the textile industry. The new product and an improving market for potassium nitrate helped the company to overcome the financial crisis in 1870. In 1871 the potassium chloride factory in Staßfurt was closed. On October 1, 1875 the second son of Vorster, the chemist Fritz Vorster joined the company as technical director. After the death of the founder Julius Vorster on October 10, 1876, the new owners converted the company into a limited partnership (Kommanditgesellschaft).|$|E
25|$|Another {{important}} source of chloride ions is sea water. Sea water contains by weight approximately 3.5wt.% salts. These salts include sodium chloride, <b>magnesium</b> <b>sulfate,</b> calcium sulfate, and bicarbonates. In water these salts dissociate in free ions (Na+, Mg2+, Cl−, SO42−, HCO3−) and migrate with the water into the capillaries of the concrete.
