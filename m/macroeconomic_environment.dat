5|$|In December 1999, President Fernando de la Rúa took office, seeking {{assistance}} from the IMF shortly thereafter. In March 2000, the IMF agreed to a three-year $7.2 billion stand-by arrangement with Argentina, conditioned on a strict fiscal adjustment and the assumption of 3.5% GDP growth in 2000 (actual growth was 0.5%). In late 2000, Argentina began to experience severely diminished access to capital markets, as reflected in a sharp and sustained rise in spreads on Argentine bonds over U.S. Treasuries. In December, The de la Rua government announced a $40 billion multilateral assistance package organized by IMF. The uneven implementation of fiscal adjustments and reforms, a worsening global <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>environment,</b> and political instability led to {{the complete loss of}} market access and intensified capital flight by the second quarter of 2001. Argentine debt, held mostly in bonds, was massively sold short and the government found itself unable to borrow or meet debt payments.|$|E

50|$|The ANC's chief aim in {{developing}} and implementing the Reconstruction and Development Programme, was to address the immense socioeconomic problems {{brought about by the}} consequences of the struggle against its predecessors under the Apartheid regime. Specifically, it set its sights on alleviating poverty and addressing the massive shortfalls in social services across the country—something that the document acknowledged would rely upon a stronger <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>environment.</b> Achieving poverty alleviation and a stronger economy were thus seen as deeply interrelated and mutually supporting objectives—development without growth would be financially unsustainable, while growth without development would fail to bring about the necessary structural transformation within South Africa's deeply inequitable and largely impoverished population. Hence the RDP attempted to combine measures to boost the economy such as contained fiscal spending, sustained or lowered taxes, reduction of government debt and trade liberalisation with socially minded social service provisions and infrastructural projects. In this way, the policy took on both socialist and neo-liberal elements—but could not be easily categorised wholly in either camp.|$|E

50|$|Lucas then {{introduced}} {{variation in}} the price level. This can occur through changes in the local price level of individual islands due to increased or decreased demand (i.e. asymmetric preferences, z) or through stochastic processes (randomness) that cannot be predicted (e). However, the island dweller only observes the nominal price change, not the component price changes. Essentially, all prices can be rising, {{in which case the}} islander wants to produce the same, as his real income is the same, which is shown by (e). Or the price of his product is rising and others are not, which is z, in which case he wants to increase supply due to a higher price. The islander wishes to respond to z but not to e, but since he can only see the total price change p (p = z + e), he makes errors. Due to this, if the money supply is expanded, causing general inflation, he will increase production even though he is not receiving as high of a price as he thinks (he confuses some of the price as an increase in z). This exhibits a Phillips curve relationship, as inflation is positively related with output (i.e. inflation is negatively related with unemployment). However, and this is the point, the existence of a short-run Phillips curve does not make the central bank capable of exploiting this relationship in a systematic way. Although economic agents are expected to respond to changes in the price level, the central bank is not able to control the real economy. Since erratic changes may occur in the <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>environment</b> (interpreted as white noises) and agents are assumed to be fully rational, controlling the real economy (unemployment and production) is possible only through surprises (or, in other words, unexpected monetary policy actions) which, however, cannot be systematic.|$|E
