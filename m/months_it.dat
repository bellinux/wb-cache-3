5|$|Active-swimming predators, {{groups of}} leopard sharks often follow the tide onto {{intertidal}} mudflats to forage for food, mainly clams, spoon worms, crabs, shrimp, bony fish, and fish eggs. Most leopard sharks tend to remain {{within a particular}} area rather than undertaking long movements elsewhere, {{which has led to}} genetic divergence between populations of sharks living in different regions. This species is aplacental viviparous, meaning that the young hatch inside the uterus and are nourished by yolk. From March to June, the female gives birth to as many as 37 young after a gestation period of 10–12 <b>months.</b> <b>It</b> is relatively slow-growing and takes many years to mature.|$|E
5|$|Aestheticism was {{sufficiently}} in vogue to be caricatured by Gilbert and Sullivan in Patience (1881). Richard D'Oyly Carte, an English impresario, invited Wilde {{to make a}} lecture tour of North America, simultaneously priming the pump for the US tour of Patience and selling this most charming aesthete to the American public. Wilde journeyed on the SS Arizona, arriving 2 January 1882, and disembarking the following day. Originally planned to last four <b>months,</b> <b>it</b> continued {{for almost a year}} due to the commercial success. Wilde sought to transpose the beauty he saw in art into daily life. This was a practical as well as philosophical project: in Oxford he had surrounded himself with blue china and lilies, and now one of his lectures was on interior design.|$|E
5|$|Banksia prionotes {{was first}} {{described}} in 1840 by English botanist John Lindley, probably from material collected by James Drummond the previous year. There are no recognised varieties, {{although it has}} been known to hybridise with Banksia hookeriana. Widely distributed in south-west Western Australia, B.prionotes is found from Shark Bay (25° S) in the north, south as far as Kojonup (33°50′S). It grows exclusively in sandy soils, and is usually the dominant plant in scrubland or low woodland. Pollinated by birds, it provides food for a wide array of vertebrate and invertebrate animals in the autumn and winter <b>months.</b> <b>It</b> is an important source of food for honeyeaters (Meliphagidae), and is critical to their survival in the Avon Wheatbelt region, where it is the only nectar-producing plant in flower at some times of the year.|$|E

The brothers designed the game as a touchscreen adaptation to classic game Snake and worked on the game for over six <b>months.</b> <b>It</b> was released in December 2013 for iPad, and was later released for other iOS devices and Android.|$|E
5|$|Caracciola and {{his wife}} Alice {{returned}} to their home in Lugano. For {{the duration of the}} war he was unable to drive; the rationing of petrol meant motor racing was unfeasible. The pain in his leg grew worse, and they went back to the clinic in Bologna to consult a specialist. Surgery was recommended, but Caracciola decided against that option, deterred by the minimum three <b>months</b> <b>it</b> would take to recover from the operation. He spent much of {{the last part of the}} war—from 1941 onwards—attempting to gain possession of the two W165s used at the 1939 Tripoli Grand Prix, with a view to maintaining them for the duration of the hostilities. When they finally arrived in Switzerland in early 1945, they were confiscated as German property by the Swiss authorities.|$|E
