The fire retardants are selected {{according to their}} physical properties and their thermostabilities. A criterion for selecting a more stable fire retardant is established. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) are used to determine thermostabilities. Results show that the fire retardant formulations are more thermally stable than the acrylic <b>ink</b> <b>control.</b> It is determined that an ink formulation containing a brominated phenol and carboxy-terminated butadiene acrylonitrile which has been modified with a brominated polymeric additive (BPA), yields the highest limiting oxygen index (LOI) of all the compounds tested.

40|$|Fingerprint is a {{very vital}} index {{in the field of}} security. Series of Automatic Fingerprint Identification Systems (AFIS) have been {{developed}} for human identification. These systems compare each of the features of a template fingerprint image with each of the features in the feature sets in the reference database to determine whether the template and each of the reference images are from the same source. Comparison is done on the basis of preset parameters such as feature type, location, orientation and so on. Getting the features used {{for the construction of a}} reference database from the images involve the implementation of a sound fingerprint feature detection, validation and extraction algorithm. In this paper, the process of detecting and extracting true and false feature points in a fingerprint image is discussed.

Some of the existing fingerprint feature extraction and validation algorithms were firstly modified and the resulting algorithms were implemented.

40|$|The flow {{characteristics}} of the ink on the ink fountain roller of offset printing machine {{is very important for}} the <b>ink</b> amount <b>control</b> and the <b>ink</b> amount <b>control</b> can determine the color quality of printing products. This study simulates first the ink flow of only one ink area using CFX fluid simulation software, then two situations are simulated to analyze how the ink area is affected by its adjacent ink areas on each side. In the first situation, the adjacent sides of the middle ink area have the same ink key opening size that is larger than that of the middle area. In the second situation, the adjacent sides of the middle ink area have different ink key opening size and each is smaller than that of the middle area. From the analysis it can be seen that, in the printing process, the pressure and speed and ink layer thickness of ink on the ink fountain roller are affected by the interaction between adjacent ink areas. Compared with previous work that is limited to analyze the ink {{flow characteristics}} of only one ink area, the study aims to analyze the ink flow characteristics under the interactional effect of adjacent ink areas.

In this case a good contrast was obtained, but the pattern was found to be susceptible to defects (cracks) in the barrier layer. Local stamp surface oxidation and subsequent modification with 1 H, 1 H, 2 H, 2 H-perfluorodecyltrichlorosilane, for use as a barrier in the transfer of n-octadecanethiol, 16 -mercaptohexadecanoic acid, and octanethiol, resulted in remarkably good contrast and stable patterns.

50|$|The ink {{fountain}} holds {{a pool of}} <b>ink</b> and <b>controls</b> the amount of ink that enters the inking system. The {{most common type of}} fountain consists of a metal blade that is held in place near the fountain roller. The gap between the blade and the {{ink fountain}} roller can be controlled by adjusting screw keys to vary the amount of ink on the fountain roller. The printer adjusts the keys in or out as the ink fountain roller turns to obtain the desired quantity of ink. In simple presses, the printer must turn these screws by hand. In modern presses, the adjusting screws are moved by servomotors which are controlled by the printer at a press console. Thus the printer can make ink adjustments electronically. If the printer needs to increase or decrease ink in an area of the plate (print), he need only adjust the needed keys to allow more or less ink flow through the blade. The ink flow can also be controlled by the rotation velocity of the ink fountain roller.|$|R

40|$|Several {{studies have}} {{indicated}} {{the important role of}} thymic environment, in which T cells differentiate and mature, in imposing the H- 2 restriction on T cells (1). These findings were incorporated by Katz et al. (2) into the framework of his "adaptive differentiation " hypothesis. The H- 2 restriction of maturing T cells was investigated primarily in experiments using bone marrow radiation chimeras with or without thymic grafts, both in T cell-mediated cytotoxicity (3, 4) and in T helper celldependent antibody responses (2, 5 - 11). Thymic environment during T cell maturation also affected immune response (Ir) 1 gene function (10, 11). In studies set up in parallel in the same systems or in other systems, tolerance induced by neonatal tolerization, in contrast to bone marrow chimeras, was not usually found to unveil a T cell repertoire specific for antigen in association with the tolerated allogeneic H- 2 antigens (7, 12), although exceptions were observed (13).

The dissection of the immune response in terms of Ir-gene control and determinant selection may well be best achieved by studying small protein antigens whose amino acid sequences and three-dimensional structures are known.

All behavior is related to surface tension, so this property has been experimentally determined for all concentrations of surfactant using the capillary method. A commercial grade ink was used as a baseline against which to judge different surfactant concentration droplet behavior. Surfactants having too low of a surface tension showed problems with ingestion (air bubbles in the exit nozzles) and droplet geometry, while those surfactants with excessively high surface tension had difficulty firing at all.

In this study, we developed a murine model of MCL-like lymphoma by crossing Cdk 4 (R 24 C) mice with Myc- 3 'RR transgenic mice. The Cdk 4 (R 24 C) mouse is a knockin strain that expresses a Cdk 4 protein that is resistant to inhibition by p 16 (INK 4 a) {{as well as other}} INK 4 family members.

This was interpreted to mean that high responder T cells had cooperated with low responder B cells across a histocompatibility difference barrier in the environment of the allophenic mice. However, Press and McDevitt (10) have recently reported that additional and more accurate analyses of these allophenic mouse sera failed to detect any anti-(T,G) -A-L antibody of the low responder allotype. Moreover, in an experiment using bone marrow chimeras, there was no low responder allotype antibody produced in response to (T,G) -A- L(10). The present study was undertaken to test the immune response of allophonic mice to an antigen, DNP-bovine gamma globulin (DNP(56) BGG), known to be controlled by genes both inside and outside the H- 2 complex (11, 12). (1) When high and low responder cells to DNP(56) BGG are present in allophenic mice, only antibody of the high responder allotype is produced. The results suggest that cell cooperation in allophenic mice cannot occur across a histocompatibility difference barrier in response to an antigen whose genetic control is at least partially within the H- 2 complex...|$|R
40|$|In the {{newspaper}} printing industry, offset is the dominating printing method {{and the use}} of multicolour printing has increased rapidly in newspapers during the last decade. The offset printing process relies on the assumption that an uniform film of ink of right thickness is transferred onto the printing areas. The quality of reproduction of colour images in offset printing is dependent on a number of parameters in a chain of steps and in the end it is the amount and the distribution of ink deposited on the substrate that create the sensation and thus the perceived colours. We identify three control points in the offset printing process and present methods for assessing the printing process quality in two of these points: • Methods for determining if the printing plates carry the correct image • Methods for determining the amount of ink deposited onto the newsprint A new concept of colour impression is introduced as a measure of the amount of ink deposited on the newsprint. Two factors contribute to values of the colour impression, the halftone dot-size and ink density. Colour impression values are determined on gray-bars using a CCD-camera based system. Colour impression values can also be determined in an area containing an arbitrary combination of cyan magenta and yellow inks. The correct amount of ink is known either from a reference print or from prepress information. Thus, the deviation of the amount of ink can be determined that can be used as control value by a press operator or as input to a control system. How a closed loop controller can be designed based on the colour impression values is also shown. It is demonstrated that the methods developed can be used for off-line print quality monitoring and <b>ink</b> feed <b>control,</b> or preferably in an online system in a newspaper printing press.
