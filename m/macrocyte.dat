40|$|Twenty {{patients}} with renal failure and severe anemia (hemoglobin range 6. 6 - 8. 7 g/dl) on thrice-weekly maintenance hemodialysis {{were treated with}} recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO). After three months of intravenous (iv) therapy the hemoglobin increase averaged 2 g/dl, and was steadily maintained even after two months of subcutaneous (sc) therapy. The significant increase of <b>macrocyte</b> counts, determined by an automated red blood cell counter after both steps of therapy, suggested the release of young red cells (large cells) into blood circulation. This assumption may be supported by the significant increase of the red cell creatine contents. 2, 3 -diphosphoglycerate (2, 3 -DPG) levels of the erythrocytes did not significantly change after rHuEPO administration...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY. A {{longitudinal}} {{investigation of}} changes in red blood cell (RBC) size distribution and zinc protoporphyrin/haemoglobin (ZPP/Hb) ratio was performed. In {{the course of the}} first few weeks after birth RBC size distribution histograms show a loss of macrocytic RBCs demonstrated by a rapid decrease of the fraction of macrocytes, whereas the degree of RBC volume dispersion decreases simultaneously. Within this period a significant change in the fraction ofmicrocytes was not observed. At about 6 months of age, a marked shift of RBC size distribution histograms towards lower volumes occurs. Concomitant with the lower MCV values, the values for the absolute distribution width at half peak height (ADWo. j) also showed an obvious decrease. At birth, ZPP/Hb ratios are about three times higher than those of adult subjects and decrease slowly during infancy. This suggests that iron deficiency is unlikely in the first months of life.

40|$|In {{hanging drop}} {{preparations}} of normal blood from various species of animals including man, the following processes were directly observed {{for the first}} time: 1. The process of fusion between two red corpuscles so as to form a round or slightly oval <b>macrocyte</b> with normal hemoglobin content, a diameter of 10 µ± and no delle. These macrocytes appear to be slightly thicker in the centre than at the periphery. No thickness measurements could be made. 2. The process of fusion between two microcytes each 5 µ± in diameter, so as to form a red corpuscle of approximately normal size but with dense hemoglobin and no delle. 3. The process of fusion between a red corpuscle and a microcyte, forming a <b>macrocyte</b> slightly larger than a normal red corpuscle and exhibiting a normal hemoglobin tint but no delle. 4. The process of microcyte formation from red corpuscles was seen occurring in four different ways: (a) By the intermittent compression of a single red corpuscle by the pull of three or more fibrin threads attached to the corpuscle. (b) By the steady, continuous compression of a single red corpuscle by the pull of two polar fibrin threads, (c) By intermittent rises of intracorpuscular pressure in a red corpuscle due to trauma, (d) By avulsion and retraction or contraction of the hemoglobin stroma from the intact surface layer of a red corpuscle. Thickness measurements in single microcytes were made in rabbit blood. 5. The process of a typical microcyte with dense hemoglobin and no delle changing back to a fairly large red corpuscle with practically normal hemoglobin tint and with a delle. 6. Macrocytes were seen expelling their hemoglobin in {{a fraction of a}} second and turning into shadows which were often paler than the background, but without any decrease in the visible surface area or change in the contour. 7. Extensibility and retractibility (or perhaps relaxation and contraction) may be exhibited by the corpuscle as a whole, by local sections of both surface layer and stroma, or retractility (contractility (?)) may be shown by the hemoglobin stroma alone. On the basis of observational evidence it is inferred that: 1. The surface layer of a red corpuscle is probably a condensed stroma rather than an anatomically defined membrane. 2. A pigment, probably hemoglobin, is present in the surface layer. 3. The surface layer of red corpuscles becomes rigid before or during spontaneous hemolysis. 4. Hemoglobin exists in an undissolved form in the intact red corpuscle. 5. The transverse diameter of microcytes (5 µ±) represents the maximal shortening of which this diameter is capable in normal red corpuscles of man, rabbit and guinea pig under the conditions studied. 6. Fusing red corpuscle are destroyed by repeated washings with Ringer solution. 7. In stagnating blood there is no increase in fusion forms, nor in the production of microcytes...|$|E

40|$|Summary: In forty-nine {{subjects}} on maintenance haemodialysis {{quantitative information}} {{with respect to}} changes in the erythron was derived from the red blood cell size distribution histogram. Increased values for the fraction of microcytes were observed in seventeen subjects, whereas in three subjects increased fractions of <b>macrocytes</b> were established. Both fractions were found to be increased simultaneously in only one subject. In the case of normal mean corpuscular volume (MCV) values, the fractions of microcytes were shown to be increased in four male and three female subjects. In contrast, MCV values were increased in four male subjects while the fractions of <b>macrocytes</b> did not exceed the reference range. Several causes which may give rise to abnormalities in red blood cell size distribution histograms in subjects treated by haemodialysis are discussed.

For the differential WBC count, 200 leukocytes per slide (three slides per snake) were counted and classified as lymphocytes, azurophils, heterophils, eosinophils, and basophils. Total thrombocyte (TT) counts were calculated for 200 leucocytes found in the visual field. In order to obtain size characteristics of the different blood cells types, 80 cells of each cell type for each individual snake were photographed under × 1, 000 magnification with a digital camera connected to a Zeiss Axiovert microscope (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany).

40|$|The term macrocytosis {{refers to}} a blood {{condition}} in which red blood cells (RBC) are larger than normal. Macrocytosis is reported in terms of mean corpuscular volume (MCV).

The peripheral blood smear is more sensitive than RBC indices for identifying early macrocytic changes because the MCV represents {{the mean of the}} distribution curve and is insensitive to the presence of small numbers of <b>macrocytes.</b> 2 However, compared to the peripheral blood smear, MCV may underestimate macrocytosis in over 30 % of cases. 3 Although determination of the MCV by automated blood cell counter is rarely inaccurate, hyperglycemia, marked leukocytosis and cold agglutinins may result in false elevations of the MCV. 4 - 6 Moreover, partial occlusion of the instrumen...|$|R

The patient also reported a 1 -month history of jaundice. On examination, he was hemodynamically stable and afebrile with pallor and diffuse jaundice but without skin rash or palpable purpura. Normal sensations and power in all extremities were evident on neurological exam. Presence of hemolytic anemia, schistocytosis, thrombocytopenia, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was suggestive of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP).

Hemograms, {{erythrocyte}} volume distribution curves, {{serum iron}} and percent transferrin saturation determinations were done on samples from 50 kittens to characterize feline erythrocytic responses {{between one and}} ten weeks of age.

Most of the macrocytic cells no longer were present by five weeks. <b>Macrocytes</b> were replaced by erythrocytes of normal volume in 30 % of the kittens. At five weeks of age, 70 %of the kittens had produced microcytic cells which correlated with significantly lower packed cell volume values (p < 0. 02) and mean corpuscular volume values (p < 0. 00 I).

40|$|Bloom’s {{syndrome}} {{is a human}} autosomal genetic disorder characterized at the cellular level by genome instability and increased sister chomatid exchanges (SCEs). Clinical features of the disease include proportional dwarfism and a predisposition to develop {{a wide variety of}} malignancies. The human BLM gene has been cloned recently and encodes a DNA helicase. Mouse embryos homozygous for a targeted mutation in the murine Bloom’s syndrome gene (Blm) are developmentally delayed and die by embryonic day 13. 5. The fact that the interrupted gene is the homolog of the human BLM gene was confirmed by its homologous sequence, its chromosomal location, and by demonstrating high numbers of SCEs in cultured murine Blm−/− fibroblasts. The proportional dwarfism seen in the human is consistent with the small size and developmental delay (12 – 24 hr) seen during mid-gestation in murine Blm−/− embryos. Interestingly, the growth retardation in mutant embryos can be accounted for by a wave of increased apoptosis in the epiblast restricted to early post-implantation embryogenesis. Mutant embryos do not survive past day 13. 5, and at this time exhibit severe anemia. Red blood cells and their precursors from Blm−/− embryos are heterogeneous in appearance and have increased numbers of <b>macrocytes</b> and micronuclei. Both the apoptotic wave and the appearance of micronuclei in red blood cells are likely cellular consequences of damaged DNA caused by effects on replicating or segregating chromosomes...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 25 - 26) An electronic cell sizing {{and counting}} system was employed {{for the first}} time to study developmental changes in the peripheral blood picture of neonatal mice. Among the parameters studied were erythrocyte volume and number, hemoglobin level, mean corpuscular hemoglobin, and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration. The system used determined several of these blood values simultaneously and permitted much more rapid and accurate measurements than have previously been obtained using standard hemocytometric techniques. The erythrocytes of the neonatal period were macrocytic and hypo??chromic. The mean volume and mean corpuscular hemoglobin decreased after birth, while the erythrocyte count, hemoglobin content and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration rose. Adult values for each of these parameters were reached by the 41 st day after birth. The eryth??rocyte population gradually became more homogeneous as the largest cells were eliminated with time, when supplemental iron was administered to female mice during or just before pregnancy,the erythrocyte distributions of the offspring were the same as in normal newborn mice, but the erythrocyte number was higher. On the basis of evidence reported in this study together with that obtained by other investigators, a model for the production of hypochromic <b>macrocytes</b> in neonatal mice is described. It is suggested that the immediate cause of the macrocytosis is the skipping of cell divisions during erythrocyte production...|$|R
40|$|For {{the purpose}} of {{settling}} the specialization stage of erythroblast where the transcription for hemoglobin is initiated, the absorption of heme and the incorporation of tritiated uridine into RNA have been observed on the cells from the anemic rabbit after a mass red cell transfusion by which the DNA synthesis of large size precursors is suppressed and the early denucleation of erythroblasts is stimulated. In the erythroblasts obtained 24 to 72 hours after red cell transfusion a distinct absorption of heme appears first in the proerythroblast, followed by a progressive increase with the advance of the specialization. Hemoglobin synthesis is markedly stimulated after the denucleation. The incorporation of tritiated uridine into RNA is most marked in the proerythroblast and decreases with the advance of specialization stage suggesting that the mRNA synthesis for hemoglobin is initiated at the proerythroblast, continuing to the polychromatic erythroblast where. the synthesis is minimized. The volumetric observations indicate a possible denucleation at proerythroblast, {{but it has been}} revealed that the maximum RNA level of <b>macrocytes</b> is comparable to that of early basophilic erythroblast and its highest hemoglobin level is only that expected in the cells denucleated at late basophilic stage.

In an attempt to identify EPO administration, we have studied the peripheral blood of 20 subjects practising sports at an amateur level. Automated cytometry was performed on the blood samples before and during 45 days of EPO treatment. The same hematological indices were determined for a control population that consisted of 240 elite athletes from various sports. As expected following EPO treatment, RBC, [Hb] and Hct increased significantly (increments of 8 %, 6. 3 % and 11 %, respectively). A significant increase in reticulocyte count was also observed. In addition, automated erythrocyte analysis showed a significant increase in cells with a volume > 120 fl and hemoglobin content (HC) < 28 pg (hypochromic <b>macrocytes,</b> or MacroHypo) : 0. 06 +/- 0. 09 % before EPO, 0. 48 +/- 0. 63 % after EPO. The EPO-treated subjects differed from the control population having higher values for Hct, mean corpuscular volume (MCV), Macro and MacroHypo. To investigate the possibility of using such variations in blood parameters to identify EPO treatment, individual values for Hct, MCV, Macro and MacroHypo for treated subjects and controls were plotted.

The effects of the radiofrequency radiations on albino mice placed in exposure cages and located around the base stations over a six months period were carried out. The levels of radiofrequency (RF) radiations around the base stations were found to be between 488. 51 mV/m to 625. 49 mV/m compared to 59 mV/m in control stations. The results of the weight change experiment showed that over the 180 days of observation, there was weight gain in the exposed and control mice groups. Statistical comparisons of mean weight changes between exposed mice and control mice showed that there were no significant (P> 0. 05) differences between the weight of the test animals. The hematological studies revealed an elevation of white blood cell (WBC) counts in mice exposed to RF radiations compared to control group.

40|$|The {{biochemical}} {{actions and}} {{side effects of}} recombinant erythropoietins (rhEPOs), their analogs and mimetics, their misuse as doping agents, and the principal analytical strategies developed to identify them in athletes' biologic fluids are reviewed. Patients who experience a range of pathologies {{have benefited from the}} administration of rhEPOs to correct severe anemia. Currently, monitoring the biologic effect of rhEPO in patients under treatment is by measuring the hemoglobin concentration. However, it may be valuable to directly monitor the actual levels of the administered drug and determine a dose-dependent correlation with any clinical adverse effect observed. This may permit the adoption of a patient-specific administration regime. Currently, the method of detecting EPO approved for doping control is an isoelectric-focusing, double-blotting, chemiluminescence assay based on charge differences between isoforms of rhEPOs and endogenous EPO in urine. The advantages and limitations of this method are presented. A new approach using sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as a complementary tool to the established method is discussed. The application of matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry and liquid chromatography combined with tandem mass spectrometry for the direct detection of the rhEPO molecules may prove to be promising. Indirect evidence of rhEPO abuse by athletes is based on the analysis of blood parameters (hemoglobin hematocrit, reticulocytes, <b>macrocytes,</b> etc) and serum markers (concentration of EPO and serum transferrin receptors, etc).

40|$|Objective: {{to reveal}} {{changes in the}} {{structure}} and shape of red blood cells depending on blood loss (BL) volume in patients with severe concomitant injury (SCI). Subjects and methods. Eighteen patients (9 men, 9 women) aged 48. 6 ± 16. 1 years who had sustained severe concomitant mechanical injury (CMI) with different BL volumes and hemodynamic disorders were examined. According to the volume of BL, the patients {{were divided into two}} groups: 1) 7 victims with a BL volume of 2000 ml (37. 5 ± 5. 1 ml/kg), grade 4 BL. A comparison group consisted of 5 apparently healthy volunteers whose mean age was 26. 4 ± 2. 7 years. The shapes and sizes of red blood cells were examined by light optical and atomic force microscopy (AFM). To study the composition of red blood cells, ten microliters of whole blood were applied to the slides and red blood cell monolayers were prepared using a V-sampler. The membrane surface was scanned by semicontact resonance AFM. The investigators used NSGL 01 -A cantilevers with a resonance frequency in the range of 80200 kHz, a probe radius of 10 nm, 512 and 1024 scanning points, and 100 X 100 ^m and 10 X 10 ^m scanning fields. Planar and 3 D images were obtained. Results. Calculation of 1000 cells by light optical microscopy and AFM showed significantly different counts of macro- and microcytes in the comparison group. The 100 X 100 -^m field exhibited the following types of red blood cells: discocytes (97. 9 ± 1. 5 % and 96 ± 5 %), echinocytes (2. 1 ± 0. 9 % and 3 ± 1 %), and squamous cells (0. 1 ± 0. 02 % and 1 ± 0. 5 %). Within the first 24 hours after injury, the victim group displayed lower normocyte counts and higher counts of <b>macrocytes</b> and microcytes than the control group. AFM in the 100 X 100 -^m field revealed that the victims with SMI when admitted to an intensive care unit exhibited a significant decrease in the counts of discocytes counts and increases in those of echinocytes, stomatocytes, and squamous cells, as compared to the controls. Anisocytosis and poikylocytosis was found to depended on the degree of BL. The squamous cells {{are most likely to be}} a variety of young erythrocytes. An appreciable increase in <b>macrocytes</b> and squamous cells on day 5 most likely reflects enhanced compensatory erythropoiesis in response to BL. Examination of red blood cell shapes within the first 24 hours after injury in the AFM field revealed profound discocytes with a protuberance in the center. On day 1 of injury changes in the nanostructure of red blood cell membranes included: 9 -fold increase of first-order height (hj); 1. 5 -fold and 3 -fold increase of second- and third-order heights (h 2 and h 3), respectively. The magnitude of changes in hj, h 2 and h 3 depended on the volume of BL and tended to decrease within the first two weeks of injury. Conclusion. The victims with SMI were observed to possess significant anisocytosis and poikylocytosis. The changes were associated with the volume of BL and included profound discocytes with a protuberance in the center as well aso changes in heights of nanostructural patterns of red blood cell membranes. Key words: severe concomitant injury, blood loss, atomic force microscopy, light optical microscopy, nanostructure of red blood cell membranes...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{elucidate}} the specific features of the biorhythms of iron exchange and erythropoiesis in thermal injury and to define their role in the pathogenesis of anemia. Materials and methods. Seventy-five patients aged 32 to 45 years, who had extensive (up to 50 % of the body’s surface) superficial (second-to-third degree) thermal burns, were examined. A control group comprised 108 donors aged 25 — 35 years. Examinations were made four times daily on days 1, 2, 3, 7, 14, 21, 28, 38, 48, 60 after injury. The authors studied daily changes in the titers of erythropoietin (EP), ferritin (F), serum iron concentrations (SIC), MDA, the populations of the ineffective, normal, and terminal types of erythron kinetics (by the activity of glucose- 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase (G- 6 -PDG)). Results. The progressive reduction in the levels of erythro-cytes and hemoglobin, which most intensive during three weeks after injury has been found to correlate with the rise in the population of microcytes with a low activity of G- 6 -PDG and shorter survival in the presence of significantly elevated concentrations of F, EP, and MDA in the evening. In the morning, the production of a highly active population of <b>macrocytes,</b> the progeny of terminal erythropoiesis is increased, which causes a decrease in SIC and levels its circadian rhythm due to the higher uptake of the trace. Conclusion. The surplus of tissue iron pool due to hyperphagocytosis of short-lived erythrocytes, as well as high EP titer-induced inhibition of apoptosis have been ascertained to be the leading mechanisms of burn-related anemia. Their basis is the stimulation of the alternative (terminal and ineffective) types of erythron kinetics.  </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{morphology}} of erythrocyte is {{an important}} diagnostic element. Changes in morphology can point to certain diseases. Among various morphological features of erythrocytes the automatic analyzers commonly examine their size and stainability. The size of erythrocyte is ranging between 6. 7 and 7. 7 mmicrometrů. The smaller erythrocytes are called microcytes while bigger ones are called <b>macrocytes.</b> The size of erythrocytes is assessed by MCV (Mean Cell Volume), which indicates the average corpuscular volume. The supply of substances such as proteins, vitamins and minerals is important for proper development and metabolism of erythrocytes. Especially iron, vitamin B 12 and folic acid are substances that affect the morphology of the erythrocyte. Deficiency of these substances leads to morphological changes in the blood picture. The deficiency of iron {{is presented in the}} peripheral blood like microcytosis (MCV 97 fl). This change is the main theme of project. As a result of deficiency of vitamin B 12 and folic acid, changes in bone marrow are formed in addition to changes observed in the peripheral blood. Deficiency of vitamin B 12 causes the megaloblastic reconstruction of bone marrow. This reconstructed bone marrow differs from normoblastic bone marrow by size, shape and and the gap between the cytoplasm and nucleus maturation. The retardation of nuclear maturation is caused by a suppressed formation of DNA related to the above mentioned deficiency of vitamin B 12. Megaloblastic anemia and pernicious anemia are other hematological diseases caused by deficiency of vitamin B 12. These diseases are at work also mentioned. The causes, which lead to a lack of both vitamins, are variable, for instance their insufficient food intake, or a defect in their assimilation. At present automatic analyzers offer a full range of tested parameters of blood cells. The samples were examined by an automatic analyzer Coulter LH 750, which operates on the principle of impedance. The value of MCV analyzer calculates using the software as the average of all measured impedance pulses. The macrocytosis was presented in 4 % {{of the total number of}} samples examined for levels of vitamin B 12. In 52 % of samples deficient values of B 12 (< 150 ng/l) content were observed. The macrocytosis was present in 7. 5 % of the total number of samples examined for level of folic acid. The deficit values of folic acid (< 3, 1 microgram/l) were observed in 38 % of all cases. At increased values of MCV 27 % deficiency of vitamin B 12 and 33 % deficiency of folic acid was found. This work confirmed the link between lack of vitamin B 12 and folic acid and the subsequent development of morphological changes. The deficiency in vitamin B 12, in folic acid or in both vitamins occurred at high MCV...|$|R
