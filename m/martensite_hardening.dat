40|$|A recent microstructure-based FEM {{model that}} couples crystal-based plasticity, the B 2 MB 190 phase {{transformation}} and anisotropic elasticity at the grain scale is calibrated to recent data for polycrystalline NiTi (49. 9 at. % Ni). Inputs include anisotropic elastic properties, texture and {{differential scanning calorimetry}} data, {{as well as a}} subset of recent isothermal deformation and load-biased thermal cycling data. The model is assessed against additional experimental data. Several experimental trends are captured - in particular, the transformation strain during thermal cycling monotonically increases and reaches a peak with increasing bias stress. This is achieved, in part, by modifying the <b>martensite</b> <b>hardening</b> matrix proposed by Patoor et al. [Patoor E, Eberhardt A, Berveiller M. J Phys IV 1996; 6 : 277]. Some experimental trends are underestimated - in particular, the ratcheting of macrostrain during thermal cycling. This may reflect a model limitation that transformation-plasticity coupling is captured on a coarse (grain) scale but not on a fine (martensitic plate) scale...|$|E
30|$|Enhanced strain {{hardening}} rate of TBF steels austempered at higher temperatures (450 and 475  °C) {{over a small}} strain range (Fig.  5) is attributed to the high long-range internal stress resulting from both the initial <b>martensite</b> <b>hardening</b> of original martensite and the difference in strength between the granular bainitic ferrite soft matrix and the γr hard second phase (Sugimoto et al. 2006). The total elongation and strength-elongation balance of TBF steel austempered at 475  °C are seriously decreased (Fig.  4 b, c). The decrease of total elongation is firstly attributed to the rapid transformation of blocky γr at low strain which results in a rapid increase of initial {{strain hardening}} (Fig.  5). In addition, the coarse microstructure consisting of high amount of large blocks of γr/αm and insufficient numbers of bainitic ferrite lathes (Fig.  6 g) results also in the decrease of total elongation. Martensite blocks act {{as the source of}} voids initiation and insufficient numbers of bf lathes lead to the decrease of γr stability (Sugimoto et al. 2002).|$|E
30|$|TBF steel {{austempered}} {{at temperatures}} lower than its Ms indicates higher tensile strength “up to 1552  MPa” {{compared to the}} steel austempered at temperatures higher than Ms (Fig.  4 a). This is due to its finer lath structure and its bainitic ferrite/martensite (αm) mixed matrix. Tensile strength of this TBF steel is decreased with increasing austempering temperature, from 325 to 350  °C (Fig.  4 a) due to the decrease of martensite lathes in the mixed matrix. The strengthening effect of martensite lathes is more dominant in this steel than a small TRIP effect of (3 %) γr. TBF steel austempered at temperatures lower than Ms exhibits a smaller total elongation compared to that austempered at 425 and 450  °C, higher than the Ms (Fig.  4 b). This is due to steep fall of strain hardening {{at an early stage}} which may be caused by small internal stress hardening and initial <b>martensite</b> <b>hardening</b> resulting from a small volume fraction of second phase (Sugimoto et al. 2000), followed by great decrease of strain hardening at low strain (Fig.  5) which in turn results from insignificant TRIP effect of small γr volume fraction.|$|E

In the present work, 3 mm thick 15 CDV 6 alloy steel sheets were joined to SAE 4130 low alloy steel by Inter Pulse Gas Tungsten Arc welding using 8 CD 12 alloy filler wire, by taking both the base materials in different prior and post heat treatment conditions. Different welding parameters and heat- treatment cycles are employed. These weld coupons are evaluated by non-destructive tests like Dye penetrate test and X-ray radiography.

The fracture toughness of this steel has been evaluated by testing compact tension specimens and surface cracked tension specimens following the procedures in ASTM E- 399 and ASTM E- 740 respectively.

30|$|Figures  6 e and 7 d {{show the}} {{microstructure}} of TBF steel austempered at 425  °C. This fine uniform microstructure mainly consists of bainitic ferrite matrix of lath structure and interlath γr films. It {{is evident from}} the figures (Fig.  6 d, e and 7 c, d) that the matrix structure is changed in some zones from bf lathes to granular bainitic ferrite and the retained austenite films are changed to a few of coarse and island type γr. K. Sugimoto et al. (2010 a) have also detected and reported these morphologic changes. It is also obvious from these figures that the pro-eutoctoid ferrite (αPE) and upper bainite are developed. The grain refinement through Nb addition leads to promotion of transformation during cooling from austenitization which causes ~ 20 % transformed phase fraction prior to the overaging step (Hausman 2013). Ultrahigh-strength TBF steel austempered at 425  °C exhibits high total elongation. As shown in Fig.  4 b, c, the total elongation and strength-elongation balance were considerably increased at 425  °C to the maximum values of 29 % and 30  GPa%, respectively. The large total elongation {{can be attributed to the}} uniform microstructure and fine lath structure matrix and to the pronounced TRIP effect of a large amount of stable retained austenite films which gradually transforms upon loading to martensite. The strain-induced transformation of γr simultaneously relaxes the localized stress concentration at the matrix/second phase interface to suppress the void initiation (Sugimoto et al. 2000). Recently, (Zhao et al. 2014) have reported that the film type γr transforms into <b>martensite</b> and <b>hardens</b> the bf matrix. The resultant compressive stress on the bf matrix prevents crack propagation. Consequently, the gradual transformation of high amount of stable γr films in the TBF steel austempered at 425  °C prevents the rapid decrease of strain hardening rate at low strain and permits for the strain hardening to continue up to a high strain (Fig.  5) which results in a considerable increase of the total elongation (Fig.  4 b).|$|R
40|$|During {{the surface}} {{treatment}} of workpieces {{by means of}} electron beams, several areas must often be treated. The energy applied causes the austenitizing of the edge layer of a workpiece. As a result of cooling, the austenite in converted into <b>martensite</b> and causes <b>hardening,</b> this {{is also known as}} self-quenching. During the hardening of several surfaces, the hardening of the next layer requires a high cycle time before it can cool down to ambient temperature. The time required is to be reduced. As is already known, no cooling medium, e. g. water is to be used; this would lead to corrosion or would disturb the vacuum process. According to the invention, the workpieces are exposed to a stream of cooling gas in a cooling station at atmospheric pressure after a surface is hardened by means of the electron beam; at intervals, an atomozing liquid is injected into the stream of cooling gas. In the intermediate time, the next workpiece is supplied to the electron beam system to harden the next su rface.

40|$|Building fuel {{efficient}} automobiles is increasingly important {{due to the}} rising cost of energy. One way to improve fuel efficiency is to reduce the overall automobile weight. Weight reductions using steel components are desirable because of easy integration into existing manufacturing systems. Designing components with Advanced High Strength Steels (AHSS) has allowed for material reductions, while maintaining strength requirements. Two Advanced High Strength steel microstructures investigated in this research utilize different strengthening mechanisms to obtain a desired tensile strength grade of 590 MPa. One steel, HR 590, utilizes precipitation strengthening to refine the grain size and harden the steel. The other steel, HR 590 DP, utilizes a dual phase microstructure consisting of <b>hardened</b> <b>martensite</b> constituents in a ferrite matrix. The steels are processed to have the same tensile strength grade, but exhibit different fatigue behavior. The central objective of this research is to characterize and compare the fatigue behavior of these two steels. The results show the dual phase steel work hardens at a low fatigue life. The precipitation strengthened microstructure shows hardening at low strain amplitudes, softening at intermediate strain amplitudes and little to no effect at high strain amplitudes. These different fatigue responses are characterized and quantified in this research. Additionally, observations showing the fracture surfaces and the bulk microstructure are analyzed.

40|$|The {{integral}} {{diaphragm pressure}} transducers machined out of precipitation <b>hardened</b> <b>martensite</b> stainless steel (APX 4) {{are widely used}} for propellant pressure measurements in space applications. These transducers are expected to exhibit dimensional stability and linearity for their entire useful life. These vital factors are very critical for the reliable performance and dependability of the pressure transducers. However, these transducers invariably develop internal stresses during various stages of machining. These stresses have an adverse effect {{on the performance of}} the transducers causing deviation from linearity. In order to eliminate these possibilities, it was planned to cryotreat the machined transducers to improve both the long-term linearity and dimensional stability. To study these effects, an experimental cryotreatment unit was designed and developed based on the concept of indirect cooling using the concept of cold nitrogen gas forced closed loop convection currents. The system has the capability of cryotreating large number of samples for varied rates of cooling, soaking and warm-up. After obtaining the initial levels of residual stress and retained austenite using X-ray diffraction techniques, the pressure transducers were cryotreated at 98 K for 36 h. Immediately after cryotreatment, the transducers were tempered at 510 degrees C for 3 h in vacuum furnace. Results after cryo treatment clearly indicated significant reduction in residual stress levels and conversion of retained austenite to martensite. These changes have brought in improvements in long term zero drift and dimensional stability. The cryotreated pressure transducers have been incorporated for actual space applications.

40|$|Press {{hardening}} of MnB steels to high-strength {{body parts}} {{is a key}} technology in the automotive industry for improving passenger safety and reducing car weight. The dominant method in automotive production is direct press hardening, which comprises the austenitizing of pre-cut 22 MnB 5 sheets in a roller hearth furnace and immediate hot forming, with simultaneous <b>hardening</b> (<b>martensite</b> formation due to rapid cooling). A metallic AlSi coating protects the steel sheets from scaling. Since, however, it melts at 600 °C, the coating is transferred onto the mullite conveyor rollers through the constant mechanical contact. Beside the formation of process-disturbing residues baked onto the rollers, this melt infiltrates the microstructure of the furnace rollers. The mullite phase of the roller material is dissolved, and a zonal microstructure is formed, leading to uncontrolled roller fractures and hence to production downtimes. The approach chosen for preventing this corrosive process and increasing plant availability of the roller-hearth furnace is a sol-gel composite coating using a transitory aluminum oxide sol as the binder phase. The suitability of various ceramic filler powders is tested {{in a variety of}} laboratory-scale tests imitating industrial service conditions. Different coatings made with three selected powder qualities which were identified as being suitable are then tested under realistic conditions in a pilot-plant scale roller hearth furnace.

In the first field test as well as in the subsequent test runs in different roller hearth furnaces, the application of this final coating causes a significant increase of roller life as well as a marked decrease in the spread of damage events.

40|$|Slat-band {{chains are}} used as {{conveyors}} by the food industry, breweries and bottling plants. The operating conditions require abrasion resistance and strength which are at the limit of {{the capabilities of the}} current material of choice, cold worked type 430. In an unconventional way of strengthening this material, Mintek developed a process in which the cold worked material is aged between 450 °C and 500 °C. The present work aims to elucidate the strengthening mechanism, using type 430 stainless steel containing 16. 42 % Cr and 0. 036 % C, in the cold-rolled condition (38 % reduction in area), with and without prior solution heat treatment. The Cr-rich precipitate α" may form in the 450 °C to 500 °C range (due to the miscibility gap in the Fe-Cr system), resulting in the increased hardness and lowered ductility. Mossbauer studies confirmed that the α", at this composition and temperature, forms through the process of nucleation and growth. Hardening due to α" precipitation was only observed after aging for 64 hours or more, however. After increasing the dissolved interstitial content by solution heat treatments (in the vicinity of 900 °C), increases in Vickers hardness of 30 - 50 kg/mm 2 could be obtained after only 8 minutes at 475 °C. This hardness increase corresponds to an increase in tensile strength of more than 100 MPa. The increased hardness {{does not appear to be}} caused by strain aging, and presumably results from fine carbide or nitride precipitation. Solution treatment at 930 °C also introduced some martensite (α') into the microstructure, which raised the hardness of the unaged cold worked material. Overaging of the carbide and nitride precipitates was observed at 475 °C, but not at 450 °C, probably due to the lower diffusion rates at the lower temperature. No averaging of the α" precipitates occurred, for aging times up to 2072 hours. Samples aged for selected periods of time at 475 °C had low impact strengths - even well before the formation of α" - and revealed predominantly cleavage fracture with some ductile fracture areas, mostly at grain boundaries. Both impact strength and lateral expansion indicated that embrittlement accompanies the increased hardness obtained by aging. Calculation of critical crack lengths from the impact data, however, revealed that a maximum flaw length of 0. 8 mm, for specimens solution treated at 880 °C, could be tolerated before catastrophic failure. Since it is not expected that flaws of that size would exist in the as manufactured links, fatigue will probably determine the lifetime of the chains, although the lower K 1 c values indicate that less crack propagation will be tolerated before brittle fracture. During the aging treatment, the strength may be lowered by recrystallisation of the coldworked material. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed the start of recovery, but no recrystallisation. Some large precipitates (around lμm in diameter) were present. These were identified, through their diffraction patterns, as M 23 C 6; these carbides were present in both aged and unaged material and hence represent precipitates which had not dissolved during the initial solution treatments. The α" precipitates- and the presumed newly formed nitride and carbide precipitates - were too fine for detection by TEM. Potentiodynamic testing of the treated material in a 0. 5 M H 2 SO 4 solution indicated that, although the probable hardening mechanisms imply localised Cr depletion of the matrix, the general corrosion resistance and passivation behaviour were not affected. It is concluded that the strength of the chain may be increased markedly by short-term heat treatments at 475 °C, with lowered toughness, but with no decrease in corrosion resistance. <b>Martensite,</b> work <b>hardening,</b> and precipitation of carbides and nitrides all contribute to the final strength, with α" formation only becoming significant after longer aging times.

40|$|A {{series of}} AK-constant fatigue crack growth tests in Paris regime {{were carried out}} to {{investigate}} the effect of second phase particle on fatigue crack growth behavior of microstructure controlled steels with uniformly distributed hard particles. Three kinds of materials were used in this study, ferrite matrix with pearlite particles (FP), ferrite matrix with bainite particles (FB) and ferrite matrix with martensite particles (FM). The fatigue crack growth tests by using a single edge cracked tension (SECT) type specimen was performed inside a scanning electron microscope chamber equipped with a servo-hydraulic fatigue machine. The {{results showed that the}} fatigue crack growth rates for all materials did not coincide with each other, even when the crack growth curves were arranged by the effective stress intensity factor range. From the in-situ observations, crack tip stress shielding phenomena, such as interlocking, branching, etc. were found on the crack wake, which enhanced fatigue crack growth resistance. In ferrite-pearlite (FP) steel, small size and small spacing of hard particles seemed to induce small but frequent crack deflections, which resulted in crack closure phenomena. On the other hand, large size of pearlite particle seemed to induce stress shielding phenomena and then contribute to high crack growth resistance, which was the main reason for higher fatigue crack growth resistance of the large size and spacing of pearlite particle compared to the small size of pearlite particle. It was similar result for the ferrite-bainite (FB) steel where the large size and large spacing of bainite particles enhanced the fatigue crack growth resistance. The higher volume fraction of hard particle also influenced the fatigue crack growth behavior. In this investigation, the result indicated the higher volume fiaction of hard particle in the ferrite-bainite (FBI) steel has significantly increased the fatigue crack growth resistance compared to the ferrite-bainite (FB 2) with lower volume fraction and ferrite-pearlite (FP) steels. The effect of hardness of second phase particle was also investigated. The results revealed that the ferrite-martensite (FM) steel showed significantly higher fatigue crack growth resistance compared to the ferrite-pearlite (FP) and ferrite-bainite (FB) steels. From the in-situ observations, the crack tip stress shielding phenomena, such as interlocking, branching, etc were found on the crack wake, which enhanced fatigue crack growth resistance. In the FM steel, the deformation of plastic constrained at the crack tip in ferrite region seemed to induce stress shielding phenomena and then contribute to high crack growth resistance, which was the main reason for lower fatigue crack growth rate of the FM steel with <b>harden</b> <b>martensite</b> particle compared to the FP and FB steels with soften pearlite and bainite particles...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Grinding {{introduces}} unavoidable {{residual stresses}} of significant but unknown magnitudes. The effect of residual stresses in surface integrity {{is related to}} the nature of the residual stresses which relies purely on the process parameters and the workmaterial properties. It is a well-known fact that the fatigue strength of a ground component is increased by introducing compressive stresses. On the other hand, fatigue cracks may originate at regions of maximum tensile stress and usually at the surface of the material. Moreover, stress corrosion cracking is another consequence of critical surface tensile stress. Added to that, the residual stresses may result in dimension alteration and surface distortion, particularly for thin products such as plates. The beneficial effects of compressive residual stresses have been widely recognized in industry. The wise application of such a principle would bring about improved economical use of parts subjected to fatigue loading and aggressive environmental conditions. Therefore a better understanding of residual stress mechanisms is necessary to increase the dimensional accuracy and improve the surface integrity of ground elements, particularly for parts with high precision and manufactured by automated production lines. Consequently, the development of reliable models for predicting residual stresses is of great value in reducing the amount of measurements and experimental tests of residual stresses. Unfortunately, little effort has been devoted so far to develop appropriate models to take into account grinding conditions, workmaterial properties and boundary conditions. This thesis aims to investigate the residual stress mechanisms induced by grinding in terms of grinding parameters. In order to obtain a full understanding, both the roles of individual factors causing residual stresses (i. e. mechanical, thermal and phase transformation) and their couplings were carefully studied with the aid of the finite element method. The studies include: (1) residual stresses due to thermal grinding conditions, (2) residual stresses due to iso-thermal mechanical grinding conditions, (3) coupling of thermo-mechanical conditions, (4) coupling of thermo-phase transformation, and (5) the full coupling of all the factors. It is found that under sole thermal grinding conditions, the heat flux associated with up-grinding may lead to a higher grinding temperature compared with that of down-grinding. A constant flux introduces the least temperature rise if the total grinding energy is the same. Higher convection heat transfer not only decreases the grinding temperature but also makes the temperature rise occur mainly within a thin surface layer. A similar effect can be achieved by applying higher table speeds. When the grinding temperature is less than the austensing temperature, surface residual stresses are tensile. The heat generated within the grinding zone causes a very non-uniform temperature field in the workpiece. The part of the workmaterial subjected to a higher temperature rise expands more significantly and causes compressive stresses because of the restraint from its surrounding material that expands less. When the surface heat flux moves forward, the material outside the grinding zone contracts under cooling. Since the workmaterial has been plastically deformed during thermal loading, the contraction is restrained and thus a tensile stress field is generated locally. If a workpiece material experiences a critical temperature variation in grinding, phase transformation takes place and a martensite layer appears in the immediate layer underneath the ground surface. It was found that the growth of <b>martensite</b> develops a <b>hardened</b> zone with a higher yield stress that expands with the movement of the heat flux. A tensile surface residual stress is then developed. When the volume growth of material takes place during phase change, compressive residual stresses may also be generated. Under iso-thermal grinding conditions, it was found that plane stress is mainly compressive regardless of the distribution of surface traction and the direction of the tangential grinding force. With up-grinding, the residual stress in the grinding direction is always tensile. However, down-grinding may yield compressive surface residual stresses if the magnitude of the ratio of horizontal to vertical grinding forces is sufficiently large. Moreover, it is noted that discrete surface traction, which is more reasonable in terms of simulating the individual cutting of abrasive grits, would bring about more complex residual stress distribution that is very sensitive to the combined effect of individual cutting grits. If thermal and mechanical grinding conditions are coupled, a state free from residual stresses may be achieved if grinding heat is low and either the convection heat transfer or the table speed is high. However, it is found that the full coupling of the mechanical deformation, the thermal deformation and deformation by phase change results in tensile residual stresses. The effects of cooling and mechanical traction in this case however are minor. In summary, the research of this thesis explored the following: (a) grinding temperature development in terms of a wide range of grinding parameters together with the effect of temperature-dependent material properties, (b) the origin and onset of irreversible deformation due to mechanical loading, thermal loading and phase change under critical grinding conditions, (c) the effects of individual residual stress mechanisms and their partial and full couplings, and (d) the selection of grinding conditions to achieve beneficial residual stresses. Finally, based on the new findings in this research, a more comprehensive methodology is suggested for further study...|$|R
