40|$|In this thesis, I {{study how}} {{information}} and asset market frictions {{can affect the}} investment and funding decisions of financial institutions, and their implications for the efficiency and stability of the financial system as a whole. The first chapter, Self-fulfilling fire sales, shows that while collateralised short-term debt mitigates individual borrowing firms’ incentives to take excessive risk, it also exerts pressure on the liquidity of the collateral asset market. When the asset market is not liquid enough, a vicious feedback loop between borrowers’ risk-taking incentives and expected asset fire-sale discount can cause instability in this secured funding market. Central bank intervention such as asset purchase is shown {{to be able to}} enhance stability and welfare. In the second chapter, Counter-cyclical foreclosure for securitisation, Jing Zeng and I study how information asymmetry in the mortgage securitisation process could distort the foreclosure policy of delinquent <b>mortages.</b> We show that banks would choose to commit to foreclose delinquent mortgages excessively {{in order to reduce the}} information friction in the securitisation process. This offers a potential explanation to the large number of foreclosures of delinquent mortgages in the U. S in the aftermath of the Subprime mortgage crisis in 2007 - 2009. The last chapter, Asset market runs and the collapse of debt maturity, shows that when market-makers have limited riskabsorbing capacity and there is uncertainty in the execution prices of sell orders, a borrower may want to shorten the debt maturity in order to allow his creditor to demand repayment and liquidate the collateral asset ahead of creditors of other firms in the case of default. This strategic shortening of debt maturity in equilibrium amplifies the borrowers risk of failing to roll-over their debt and leads to excessive asset liquidation...|$|R

40|$|The 2007 {{international}} economic crisis {{may have begun}} in capitalism’s heartland with credit default swops and sub-prime <b>mortages,</b> nevertheless {{some of its most}} dramatic manifestations have been at the edge. In Europe, the peripheral economies of Iceland, Greece and Ireland have manifested crises that have shaken Europe to the core, and generated crisis discourse that may well prove central. Certainly previous talk of crisis seem to have been key to political change processes in the past (Hay, 1996; Mårtenson and Lindhoff, 1998). While there has been some initial analysis of the discursive response to the economic crisis (Hartz, 2010; O’Rourke, 2010) this paper focuses on what some have considered the most conservative of ‘frames’ through which the crisis has been viewed (Thompson, 2009 : 523) : enterprise discourse. Furthermore this work concentrates on enterprise discourse in a post-celtic tiger crisis-ridden Ireland. Ireland is an economy, society and culture at the edge. On the one hand Ireland is {{on the edge of the}} USA /UK model. It is English-speaking, has a common law tradition, an Anglo-American banking model, low corporate tax rates and strong cultural and economic ties with both the USA and the UK. On the other hand, Ireland is also on the edge of mainland Europe with its membership of the Euro, its social Partnership model of labour relations until 2009, its early adoption of European Labour rights, generally pro-European stance and its historic cultural and economic ties to the continent. Enterprise discourse in Ireland is influenced by both USA/UK and European Union (EU) developments. However, Irish enterprise discourse is not merely a ‘local adoption’. For example, during the ‘Celtic Tiger’ period (1987 - 2007), high Irish economic growth rates have coincided with the development of the EU’s enterprise policy, thus giving the impression that Ireland could serve as a model of development. Since the crisis Ireland, numbered among the ‘PIGS’ (Totaro, 2010) or ‘GIPSY’ club (Gros, 2010), has been represented both as a model victim of free-market fundamentalism (Krugman, 2010) and as a model of how public expenditure should be drastically cut (Halligan, 2010; Tett, 2010). Thus an examination of enterprise discourse in Ireland is of concern to more than residents of Ireland. References Gros, D. 2010. Adjustment Difficulties in the GIPSY Club.
