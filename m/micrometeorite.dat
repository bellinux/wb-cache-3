The same announcement also discussed the nature of Jupiter's rings. Light scattering by particles in the rings showed the particles were irregularly shaped (rather than spherical) and likely originated as ejecta from <b>micrometeorite</b> impacts on Jupiter's moons, probably on Metis and Adrastea.

Six of the particles are identified as composite <b>micrometeorites</b> that contain chondritic igneous objects and fine-grained matrix. These particles suggest that at least some coarse-grained <b>micrometeorites</b> (cgMMs) may be derived from the same parent bodies as fine-grained <b>micrometeorites.</b> The new evidence indicates that, contrary to previous suggestions, the parent bodies of <b>micrometeorites</b> broadly resemble the parent asteroids of chondrulebearing carbonaceous chondrites...|$|R

Those modules would be within their useful lives in 2016 or 2020. The report presents a statement from an unnamed Russian engineer that, based on the experience from Mir, a 30-year life should be possible, except for <b>micrometeorite</b> damage, because the Russian modules have been built with on-orbit refurbishment in mind.|$|E
25|$|Ballistic panels, {{also called}} <b>micrometeorite</b> shielding, are {{incorporated}} into the station to protect pressurised sections and critical systems. The type and thickness of these panels depends on their predicted exposure to damage. The station's shields and structure have different designs on the ROS and the USOS. On the USOS, a thin aluminium sheet is held apart from the hull and causes objects to shatter into a cloud before hitting the hull, thereby spreading the energy of impact. On the ROS, a carbon plastic honeycomb screen is spaced from the hull, an aluminium honeycomb screen is spaced from that, with a screen-vacuum thermal insulation covering, and glass cloth over the top.

25|$|Two {{types of}} ghost craters {{occur in the}} Borealis region; both are nearly obliterated by smooth plains material. In one type found along the {{northwest}} border of Suisei Planitia (Guest and Greeley, 1983), only the uppermost parts of walls and rims protrude above smooth plains material. Ghost craters of this type display rounded rim crests that are densely cratered with secondaries, a feature typical of the rough surface of intercrater plains material. These craters are floored by smooth plains material and are therefore older than it; a similar relation occurs on the Moon, where the crater Archimedes is seen to be older than the mare material it contains. Another type of ghost crater, common in Borealis Planitia, is recognized only by an irregular or thin outline of a rim crest under a thin mantle of smooth plains material; the buried rim crest is shown on the map. The polygonal ghost crater centered at lat 82.5° N., long 100° W., northwest of Depréz, is a transitional form between these two types. Polar darkening is generally lacking on Mercury (Hapke, 1977), but darkening in restricted areas {{may be due to}} vapor-phase deposition accompanying <b>micrometeorite</b> impacts (Hapke, 1977). In the Borealis region, surface darkening affects some crater floors, and low-albedo areas are mapped in both intermediate plains and smooth plains materials. The low-albedo plains are marginal to the borders of Borealis and Suisei Planitiae, which suggests that darkening may be due to internal volatile materials escaping along the fractured margins of unrecognized buried or very degraded basins.|$|E

It {{was the first}} attempt to collect <b>micrometeorites</b> at inland bare ice in Antarctica and to use a filter with 10 μm openings; it can capture particles that overlap in size with interplanetary dust particles collected in stratosphere. At the inland bare ice of the Antarctic Continent, an ancient flux of extraterrestrial dust {{is thought to be}} preserved in contrast with bare ice along the shore of the continent. For collecting <b>micrometeorites</b> from the bare ice, we used a tented sledge equipped with appliances for melting ice and filtering the melted water.

40|$|<b>Micrometeorites</b> {{extracted}} from Antarctic ice {{are a major}} source of extraterrestrial materials available for study in the laboratory. Materials in this size range are important because the peak in the mass flux distribution of extraterrestrial particles accreted by the Earth occurs for particles approximately 200 microns in diameter with a mass accretion rate estimated at approximately 40 x 10 (exp 6) kilograms per year. It has been suggested that <b>micrometeorites</b> may have contributed much pre-biotic organic matter to the early Earth, but the types and abundances of organic material in <b>micrometeorites</b> are poorly known.

2500|$|Impacts by meteorites and comets are {{the only}} abrupt {{geologic}} force acting on the Moon today, though the variation of Earth tides {{on the scale of}} the Lunar anomalistic month causes small variations in stresses. Some of the most important craters used in lunar stratigraphy formed in this recent epoch. For example, the crater Copernicus, which has a depth of 3.76km and a radius of 93km, is believed to have formed about 900 million years ago (though this is debatable). The Apollo 17 mission landed in an area in which the material coming from the crater Tycho might have been sampled. The study of these rocks seem to indicate that this crater could have formed 100 million years ago, though this is debatable as well. The surface has also experienced space weathering due to high energy particles, solar wind implantation, and <b>micrometeorite</b> impacts. This process causes the ray systems associated with young craters to darken until it matches the albedo of the surrounding surface.

Moreover, on the average, Antarctic <b>micrometeorites</b> contain at least as much carbon as does Orgueil, the most C-rich meteorite. <b>Micrometeorites</b> are thus responsible for most of the carbon accreted by the Earth.

We also discovered this 'COPS' phase in the fusion crust of Murchison. It appears likely that COPS is a product of meteoroid reprocessing during frictional heating in the Earth's atmosphere and/or its fast 'weathering' in the upper atmosphere.

Seventy-six cosmic spherules were recovered from Coniacian (87 ± 1 Ma) sediments of the White Chalk Supergroup. Particles vary from pristine silicate and iron-type spherules to pseudomorphic spherules consisting of either single-phase recrystallized magnetite or Fe-silicide. Pristine spherules are readily identified as <b>micrometeorites</b> {{on the basis of}} their characteristic mineralogies, textures and compositions. Both magnetite and silicide spherules contain dendritic crystals and spherical morphologies, testifying to rapid crystallisation of high temperature iron-rich metallic and oxide liquids. These particles also contain spherical cavities, representing weathering and removal of metal beads and irregular cavities, representing vesicles formed by trapped gas during crystallization; both features commonly found among modern Antarctic Iron-type (I-type) cosmic spherules. On the basis of textural analysis, the magnetite and Fe-silicide spherules are shown to be I-type cosmic spherules that have experienced complete secondary replacement during diagenesis (fossilization). Our results demonstrate that <b>micrometeorites,</b> preserved in sedimentary rocks, are affected by a suite of complex diagenetic processes, which can result in disparate replacement minerals, even within the same sequence of sedimentary beds.
