50|$|Following {{condensation}} of the {{low pressure}} exhaust steam in the condenser, the feed water is passed to a condensate sump mounted under the condenser. From this receiver the condensate is drawn by one or two extraction pumps and passed through a discharge strainer. The low pressure feed heating system consists of five Direct Contact heaters with one high level deaerator to provide a high feed pump suction head. The Direct Contact L.P. heaters are arranged in two banks, comprising three and two heaters respectively. Within each bank the heaters are stacked above each other so that the condensate drains from the lower pressure heater below by gravity. The heights of the heaters are approximately inversely proportional to the bled steam pressures. The advantages of Direct Contact heaters are essentially that thermal efficiency is improved, capital cost is reduced due to fewer numbers of extraction pumps being required, and the system is entirely ferrous. The main extraction pump discharges the condensate to No.1 D.C. heater from which it cascades down to No.2 and then to No.3 D.C. heater by gravity. Two lift pumps deliver the condensate to No.4 D.C. heater, from which it cascades through No.5 D.C. heater to two deaerator lift pumps. The deaerator lift pumps discharge the condensate to the deaerator and from there it passes to the boiler feed pump suction main through microwire and magnetic filters. The main boiler feed pump is driven by a steam turbine which receives its steam from the main H.P. turbine exhaust. It comprises a single cylinder eleven stage turbine turning at 5,000 rev/min (31.42 Rad/min) and driving a <b>multi-stage</b> <b>pump</b> to give a delivery pressure of 2,067 tonne/m2 (2,940 lbf/in2). Two electrically driven Starting and Standby feed pumps are provided. The high pressure heating system consists of two parallel banks of two heaters being numbered 7 and 8 stages in the system. Each of the H.P. heaters is vertical and of the non-contact type. From the H.P. heaters the condensate, at a temperature of 253 degrees Celsius (455 degrees Fahrenheit), is passed into the boiler economiser. During unit shutdowns {{the whole of the}} feed system can be ‘blanketed’ with nitrogen gas. This is an attempt to reduce the rate at which copper and ferrous oxides form, hence reduce the ‘carrying over’ of these oxides to the boiler drum. Boiler feed water make-up is supplied by the Water Treatment Plant. This has a continuous rating of 3,672,000 Litres (970,000 gallons) in 24 hours at 153,300 Litres (40,500 gallons) per hour. The plant comprises three groups of cation, anion and mixed bed ion exchange resin units, together with vacuum degassing and pressure filtering plant. Each group processes 76,650 Litres (20,250 gallons) per hour and normally two groups are in service at one time, with the third on standby or being regenerated.|$|E

40|$|The {{primary goal}} {{of the project was}} to gain insight into the flow pattern in a mixed flow pump {{diffuser}} by using FLUENT CFD code and k-e turbulence model, and improve the design of a diffuser for higher pump efficiency. The diffuser chosen in this thesis is used in a mixed flow <b>multi-stage</b> <b>pump</b> which collects the nearly radial flow (water) at impeller discharge and converts it to a nearly axial flow at the inlet of the following pump stage. A three-dimensional computational model was developed for three different diffuser designs labeled as Diffuser A, Diffuser B and Diffuser C. CFD results indicated that Diffuser C had better pressure recovery characteristics than both Diffuser A and Diffuser B. These results were confirmed by comparing with the experimental data for these diffusers provided by the pump manufacturer. The major conclusion resulting from the flow pattern study for Diffuser A, B and C is that the exit angle of the mean flow near the hub side of the diffuser has a strong effect on the diffuser performance. The greater the flow exit angle, the higher the degree of secondary flow formation which tends to reduce static pressure recovery. Based on that finding, several different diffuser geometries were modeled in an effort to reduce the exit flow angle. It can be concluded from this work that FLUENT CFD code can be used to model internal subsonic flows {{with a high degree of}} confidence.

40|$|Panel Sessionpg. 133 This {{paper is}} for the user of {{rotating}} equipment, Reliability {{is the key to}} the bottom line and rotordynamics is often the significant factor in determining reliability. Rotordynamics is a very interesting and complicated subject. The importance of this subject has increased over the last few decades, particularly in smaller equipment such as pumps. As machine speeds have increased and higher flows and efficiencies have become necessary, the side effect has been to introduce new rotordynamics problems. These include critical speeds, unbalance response and rotor stability. An example of a recently seen problem involved the application of variable frequency drives to vertical pumps which induced structural resonances in the system at operating speeds. The object of this paper is to discuss various aspects of rotordynamics that are general and then apply these to some examples. The mathematics will be kept to a minimum and as many helpful ?rules of thumb? will be included as this subject allows. Rotordynamics can be a very controversial subject from the nomenclature used to the question of the degree of accuracy needed to model a rotordynamic system. There have been many simplifications and assumptions made in this paper and the author offers some opinions that some people will disagree with, but the approach here is quite conservative and the guidelines will not get anyone into trouble. The approaches and guidance offered here are based on experience of many people and many years of analyzing and testing machinery. The track record of those using these techniques is very good when comparing analytical and actual test data. The paper is broken down into two major sections. The first section covers rotordynamics of machines with the majority of the mass between bearings such as a compressor or a <b>multi-stage</b> <b>pump.</b> All the effects of the various geometrical factors will be discussed for these types of machines.

Pumps manufactures, indeed, usually do not provide information about efficiency of a pump used like a turbine. Various researchers indicated the single-stage centrifugal pumps as the optimal and most convenient choice for a PAT, operating, however, in a range from low-to-medium head [12, 13, 14, 15].
