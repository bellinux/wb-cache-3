For one thing the estimates are subject to some smoothing bias, which is the price that must be paid for limiting estimator variance by penalization. However if smoothing parameters are selected appropriately the (squared) smoothing bias introduced by penalization should be less than the reduction in variance that it produces, so that the net effect is a reduction in <b>mean</b> <b>square</b> <b>estimation</b> <b>error,</b> relative to not penalizing.
