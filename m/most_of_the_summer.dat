5|$|Garfield {{was carried}} {{back to the}} White House. Although doctors {{told him that he}} would not survive the night, the President {{remained}} conscious and alert. The next morning his vital signs were good and doctors began to hope for recovery. A long vigil began, with Garfield's doctors issuing regular bulletins that the American public followed closely throughout the summer of 1881. His condition fluctuated. Fevers came and went. Garfield struggled to keep down solid food and spent <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>summer</b> eating little, and that only liquids.|$|E
5|$|On May 12, LeVert {{underwent}} {{surgery to repair}} a stress fracture in his foot. He {{was expected to be}} sidelined for 8–10 weeks, but be available for the team's August trip to play in Europe. Beilein announced on June 3 that Max Bielfeldt had undergone hip surgery and was expected to miss <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>summer.</b> On August 6, D. J. Wilson was sidelined for 4–6 weeks following surgery on his pinky finger. This announcement came prior to the team's August 15 departure for its summer trip to Italy.|$|E
5|$|Harold's brother Tostig made probing attacks {{along the}} {{southern}} coast of England in May 1066, landing at the Isle of Wight using a fleet supplied by Baldwin of Flanders. Tostig appears to have received little local support, and further raids into Lincolnshire and near the River Humber met with no more success, so he retreated to Scotland, where he remained for a time. According to the Norman writer William of Jumièges, William had meanwhile sent an embassy to King Harold Godwinson to remind Harold of his oath to support William's claim, although whether this embassy actually occurred is unclear. Harold assembled an army and a fleet to repel William's anticipated invasion force, deploying troops and ships along the English Channel for <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>summer.</b>|$|E

5|$|Attempt {{to retake}} {{the town was}} made under the {{leadership}} of the new Swedish Governor-General of Finland Carl Nieroth with 10 000 men strong army supported by naval squadron led by Admiral Olof Wernfelt consisting of 6 ships of the line, 3 frigates and 3 brigantines. Swedish light infantry had started the harassing operations already in the spring of 1711 and naval blockade had been place for <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>summer.</b> Swedish manpower had been sapped by a plague which had struck Finland in late 1710 killing amongst others nearly a thousand in Helsinki alone - half the population at the time. Same plague had struck Karlskrona making it difficult for the Swedish to equip their naval squadron Finland and it took until late June before it was able to sail delaying all Swedish operations. Actual siege by land forces was started in the autumn. However, as king refused to release more troops and supplies from Sweden for the besieging forces the siege was doomed to fail. On 2 December 1711 freezing waters and harsh weather forced the naval force to retire and by the Christmas also the land forces had to withdraw. Nieroth who had invigorated the whole of Finland perished suddenly on 25 January 1712 and was succeeded by weak Georg Henrik Lybecker.|$|E
5|$|The {{criminal}} trial continued for <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>summer</b> and Carrouges, Le Gris and Marguerite were all {{called on to}} give evidence. Marguerite was by this time visibly pregnant, although medieval medical knowledge claimed that children could not be conceived {{as a result of}} rape and her condition therefore was determined to have no bearing on the case. Adam Louvel and at least one of Marguerite's maidservants also gave evidence and, as was the custom of the day for people of low birth, they were tortured to test the veracity of their testimony. During this process neither produced evidence incriminating Le Gris, although Louvel was subsequently challenged to a duel himself by Marguerite's cousin, Thomin du Bois. In his evidence, Carrouges statement primarily repeated and supported his wife's testimony, while Le Gris accused Carrouges of inventing the charges and beating his wife into making the accusations against the squire. In his statement, Le Gris painted a picture of a man driven wild with anger and jealousy who sought to restore his family fortune by concocting false accusations against his most significant rival. Le Gris also offered alibis for his whereabouts during the entire week the crime {{was supposed to have been}} committed and attempted to explain that it was not possible for him to have ridden the twenty-five miles which supposedly separated him from Marguerite on the morning in question. A rebuttal from Carrouges emphasised the shame the trial had brought to his family as a reason against its invention and offered a counter demonstration of horsemanship indicating that the suggested fifty mile round trip was not impossible even if Le Gris's alibi was true. Le Gris' alibi was compromised some days later when the man providing it, a squire named Jean Beloteau, was arrested for committing rape in Paris even as the trial progressed. On 15 September, with the King in Flanders preparing for an invasion of England, the parlement handed down its verdict: As they had been unable to determine the guilt in the case, the two men would fight a duel to the death on 27 November 1386.|$|E

25|$|In 1980, RTA {{undertook}} a complete {{renovation of the}} Green and Blue Lines, with new track, ballast, poles and overhead wiring. Existing stations were demolished and new stations constructed. The project necessitated closing the Green Line east of Shaker Square for <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>summer</b> of 1980 and the Blue Line east of Shaker Square for <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>summer</b> of 1981, with substitute bus shuttles and single-tracking along {{the remainder of the}} line from East 55th Street to Shaker Square. To run on the renovated lines, a fleet of new LRVs were purchased from an Italian firm, Breda Costruzioni Ferroviarie, to replace the aging PCC cars. The new lines were dedicated on October 30, 1981.|$|E

25|$|After S. G. Spann was {{authorized}} to raise Indian troops in April 1863, he soon established a recruiting camp in Mobile, Alabama and Newton County, Mississippi. Spann placed recruiting advertisements in the Mobile Advertiser and Register. The advertisements {{appeared in the}} newspaper for <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>summer</b> of 1863. Spann's organization was known as Spann's Independent Scouts. It was soon re-organized as the 18th Battalion, Alabama Cavalry. The unit helped with Gideon J. Pillow's conscription efforts {{in the fall of}} 1863. Spann was the commander of U.C.V. Camp Dabney H. Maury which was based in Newton, Mississippi. Spann lived in Meridian, Mississippi at the time he wrote about the deeds of the Choctaw during the Civil War.|$|E
25|$|As {{commander}} of Company A of the 4th U.S. Artillery Regiment, Gardner, along with Captain Abner Doubleday, {{his wife and}} Company E, arrived from Fort Capron, Florida, reaching their new post aboard the steamer Gordon on June 16, 1858, joining Captain Truman Seymour’s Company H to jointly constitute Moultrie’s new U.S. Army garrison. In August, yellow fever broke out amongst the companies of newly arrived artillerymen, infecting 49 and eventually killing 28. To reduce the possibility of further spreading of the epidemic, Washington authorized Gardner to temporarily move his command outside the fort into a healthier locale during the hot summer season. Subsequently, Gardner was absent from Fort Moultrie throughout <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>summer</b> of 1859, scouting out potential arrangements around Smithville, North Carolina. Doubleday acted as commandant during Gardner's absence.|$|E

40|$|The Algerian current {{observed}} during <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>summers</b> between 1975 and 1983 {{appeared as a}} succession of eddies (diameter about 100 km) propagating eastward along the coast. In 1984, however, satellite infrared imagery revealed two huge (diameter about 200 km) and driftless anticyclonic eddies occupying <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Algerian basin. The Atlantic water was deflected seaward {{as far as the}} Balearic islands by the westernmost eddy located off Algiers, and was then dispatched by other eddies throughout the basin as if by a set of paddle-wheels. Nevertheless, and independent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> general situation, <b>the</b> occurrence <b>of</b> eddies induces secondary phenomena such as advections of surface water from the Liguro-Provencal basin into the Algerian basin, cool tongues and small-scale cyclonic eddies along the Algerian coast. In consequence, the circulation in the Algerian basin is mainly driven by mesoscale eddies and its temporal and spatial variability is thus very large...|$|R
