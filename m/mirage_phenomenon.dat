40|$|The {{advent of}} X-ray lasers allowed the {{realization}} of compact coherent soft X-ray sources, thus opening {{the way to a}} wide range of applications. Here we report the observation of unexpected concentric rings in the far-field beam profile at the output of a two-stage plasma-based X-ray laser, which can be considered as the first manifestation of a <b>mirage</b> <b>phenomenon</b> in X-rays. We have developed a method of solving the Maxwellâ€“Bloch equations for this problem, and find that the experimentally observed phenomenon is due to the emergence of X-ray mirages in the plasma amplifier, appearing as phase-matched coherent virtual point sources. The obtained results bring a new insight into the physical nature of amplification of X-ray radiation in laser-induced plasma amplifiers and open additional opportunities for X-ray plasma diagnostics and extreme ultraviolet lithography...|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} the local {{density of states}} and the order parameter structure inside an elliptic quantum corral on surfaces of isotropic and anisotropic superconductors. The Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations are solved {{in the presence of}} non-magnetic and magnetic impurities. We observe and discuss a variety of <b>mirage</b> and anti-mirage <b>phenomena,</b> which specifically reflect the nature of the superconducting pairing state. Comment: 8 pages, 8 figure...|$|R
2500|$|<b>Mirages</b> are optical <b>phenomena</b> {{in which}} light rays are bent due to thermal {{variations}} in the refraction index of air, producing displaced or heavily distorted images of distant objects. Other dramatic optical phenomena associated with this include the Novaya Zemlya effect where the sun appears to rise earlier than predicted with a distorted shape. A spectacular form of refraction occurs with a temperature inversion called the Fata Morgana where objects on the horizon or even beyond the horizon, such as islands, cliffs, ships or icebergs, appear elongated and elevated, like [...] "fairy tale castles".|$|R
