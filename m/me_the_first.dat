25|$|In {{the history}} of LGBT theatre in Singapore, {{it was only in}} the second half of the 1980s that gay writers started to explore the {{hitherto}} taboo area of homosexuality in their works. The licensing authority, however, was not quite ready so that in 1988, three plays with gay themes were banned from being performed. These were Eleanor Wong's Jackson on a Jaunt, Chay Yew's As If He Hears and Russell Heng's Lest The Demons Get To <b>Me.</b> <b>The</b> <b>first</b> two plays were subsequently staged in 1989/1990 after negotiations with the authority. The third was staged in 1992 after Singapore's culture policy was liberalised by its new Prime Minister, Goh Chok Tong.|$|E

[...] He also had problems having his Pleyel piano sent to him. It finally arrived from Paris in December. Chopin wrote to Pleyel in January 1839: [...] "I am sending you my Preludes [...] I finished them on your little piano, which arrived {{in the best possible}} condition in spite of the sea, the bad weather and the Palma customs." [...] Chopin was also able to undertake work on his Ballade No. 2, Op. 38; two Polonaises, Op. 40; and the Scherzo No. 3, Op. 39.|$|E
500|$|In 2017, Holt {{talked about}} {{recording}} the guitar solos, [...] "That's {{one of my}} favorites on the album. I'm never blown away by anything I've done musically. I always want to redo it five minutes after I'm done with it. That goes down to songwriting too - it's never going to be perfect. Nothing's perfect. So yeah, I went in and did all the solos for that album in a day. I just sat down with a six pack of beer with Kerry and Terry Date. They just let me do my own thing. Tom came in after I had been messing around with a solo for a half an hour and he told <b>me</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> take was perfect. I told him they've got to let me know because I'll keep going over it and sometimes you lose a good thing when that happens. You've got to know when to just let it go and keep it whether it's raw or rough or perfect or maybe there a little bit of magic in there." ...|$|E

500|$|However, some reviewers {{felt the}} film relied {{too heavily on}} gadgets and special effects, with the plot being neglected. James Berardinelli of Reelviews.net said, [...] "This is a train wreck of an action film – a stupefying attempt by the filmmakers to {{force-feed}} James Bond into the mindless XXX mold and throw 40 years of cinematic history down the toilet in favor of bright flashes and loud bangs." [...] Of the action sequences, he said, [...] "Die Another Day {{is an exercise in}} loud explosions and excruciatingly bad special effects. The CGI work in this movie is an order of magnitude worse than anything I have seen in a major motion picture. Coupled with lousy production design, Die Another Day looks like it was done on the cheap. Gary Brown of the Houston Community Newspapers also described the weak point of the film as [...] "the seemingly non-stop action sequences and loud explosions that appear to take centre stage while the Bond character is almost relegated to second string." [...] Roger Moore remarked, [...] "I thought it just went too far – and that’s from <b>me,</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> Bond in space! Invisible cars and dodgy CGI footage? Please!" ...|$|E
500|$|Many live {{instruments}} were {{used during the}} album's production, especially violin. Milian named [...] "You Make Me Laugh" [...] {{one of her favorite}} songs on the album. It was the first song written by Milian for the album, and she worked with Bloodshy for the song's production. The album's second and final single, [...] "When You Look at Me", was written by Milian. Using her school days as the inspiration for the song, Milian said that [...] "when I was growing up, I found people were always trying to label <b>me.</b> <b>The</b> <b>first</b> day of school it would be like 'Here comes this girl all dressed up. She thinks she's all that' and they didn't even know me. The message behind 'When You Look At Me' is never judge a book by its cover." [...] Milian asked Ja Rule to appear on her album, however {{she did not want to}} put him [...] "on just any song", and wanted to make sure it was the right song for him. Milian hoped Ja Rule would appear on the track [...] "A Girl Like Me", but he ended up rapping on [...] "Get Away". Milian co-wrote the track [...] "Twitch" [...] with R singer Montell Jordan, which explains that men have a certain twitch of their shoulders whenever they tell lies.|$|E

2500|$|While {{living with}} his father, an engineer, Edgard was pushed to further his {{scientific}} understanding at the Institute Technique, {{a high school in}} Italy that specialized in teaching mathematics and science. It was here where Edgard became particularly interested in the works of Leonardo da Vinci. It was through Edgard's love of science that he began to study sound, as he later recalled [...] "When I was about twenty, I came across a definition of music that seemed suddenly to throw light on my gropings toward music I sensed could exist. Józef Maria Hoene-Wroński, the Polish physicist, chemist, musicologist and philosopher {{of the first half of}} the nineteenth century, defined music as 'the corporealization of the intelligence that is in sounds.' It was a new and exciting conception and to <b>me</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> that started me thinking of music as spatial—as moving bodies of sound in space, a conception I gradually made my own." ...|$|E
2500|$|For {{roughly the}} next decade Gordon {{controlled}} Jackson with threats, lies, and routine domestic violence. According to Jackson, [...] "When he hit <b>me,</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> time I was in shock, I just recalled my ear ringing, just ringing so hard." [...] Gordon confiscated Jackson's passport, transferred her bank accounts into his name, hired bodyguards to watch La Toya constantly and banned her from speaking to or seeing her family, monitoring her every phone call. La Toya's father Joseph stated in his book The Jacksons that he believed Gordon brainwashed La Toya and made her fearful of her own family. Katherine also believed that La Toya had been brainwashed while Gordon claimed that Katherine had tried to kill her daughter. Sister Janet concurred with her parents saying at the time, [...] "I think this guy who is with her has brainwashed her and made her like this... He keeps {{her away from the}} family, and now he's brainwashed her so much she keeps herself away from us." ...|$|E

[...] "She came up to <b>me</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> day we worked together and offered to go over lines together and help me with anything I needed. She is a sweetheart," [...] said Baker. Baker revealed that in her spare time in between takes as the character, she managed to find something to keep entertained by. [...] "It seems like there is always something to do when you have down time on the set," [...] she said. [...] "I either run lines with the other actors or hang out in the hair and makeup room. I love those ladies!" [...] Adding to Baker's enjoyment on the set was Young. [...] "He is always cracking jokes!" [...] stated Baker.|$|E

2500|$|Rick Moranis {{drove me}} out of my mind. There's this whole wave of insult comedy. In the real world, if someone insults you a couple of times, you can smack them. Or punch them. You can't do that on a movie set. And these comedians walk around, and they can say {{whatever}} they want. I'm just not that handy with that. Comedians are a special breed. They can antagonize you and say whatever they... want, and you can't do anything to stop them... He's this weird looking little guy who couldn't get laid in a whore house with a fistful of fifties. He would imitate <b>me.</b> <b>The</b> <b>first</b> thing he says to me is, [...] "Do you just act cool, or are you really cool?" [...] That was the first sentence out of his mouth to me in Joel Silver's office. And I was like, [...] "Oh... {{this is not going to}} go well." [...] But he was one of Joel's dear friends, and he ended up making a bunch of movies for Disney. I just wasn't that sharp. I wasn't ready for that kind of crap.|$|E

Like, it shows the grown side of Chris – it doesn't show the kiddie side. 'Cause with this album, I wanted to blend, I wanted to do all different visuals of <b>me.</b> <b>The</b> <b>first</b> [...] 'Wall to Wall,' the acting, the vampires, the spookiness, then you go to 'Kiss, Kiss,' that had the little goofy part, now this one is solo, the main [...] is me. Me freestyle dancing – just showing people me naturally, not a choreographed routine, just me dancing and showing you what I'm capable of. But at the same time, I was just having fun with the camera, and just one-on-one time with me and my audience." [...] The video was quite popular in American television, reaching number 1 on BET's 106 & Park for 6 days, and staying on the countdown for 38 days. It has also reached number 1 on MTV TRL for 10 days, replacing Flo Rida's [...] "Low" [...] and finally retired at number 1 after it stayed on the countdown for 35 days.

2500|$|After {{completing}} his BA degree in English Literature from the Government College, Lahore (then in British India, now in Pakistan), Dev Anand left his home-town for Bombay {{in the early}} 1940s. He began {{his career in the}} military censor's office at Churchgate, for a monthly salary of Rs. 165. Later he joined as a clerk in an accounting firm for a salary of Rs. 85. He joined his older brother, Chetan, {{as a member of the}} Indian People's Theatre Association (IPTA). Dev Anand aspired to become a performer after seeing Ashok Kumar's performance in films like Achhut Kanya and Kismet. [...] Dev Anand quoted in an interview that [...] "I remember when I gate-crashed into the office of the man who gave <b>me</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> break, he kept looking at me– Babu Rao Pai of Prabhat Film Studios. At that time he made up his mind that this boy deserves a break and later mentioned to his people that ‘this boy struck me because of his smile and beautiful eyes and his tremendous confidence.'" [...] Then he was soon offered the lead role in Prabhat Films' Hum Ek Hain (1946), a film about Hindu-Muslim unity, where Dev Anand played a Hindu boy and was paired opposite Kamala Kotnis. While shooting the film in Pune, Anand befriended the actor Guru Dutt. Between them, they agreed that if one of them were to become successful in the film industry, he would help the other also to be successful. They formed a mutual understanding that when Anand produced a film, Dutt would direct it and when Dutt directed a film, Anand would act in it.|$|E
