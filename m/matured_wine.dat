We present how the {{supervised}} {{machine learning}} techniques {{can be used to}} predict quality characteristics in an important chemical engineering ap-plication: the wine distillate maturation process. A number of experiments have been conducted with six regression-based algorithms, where the M 5 ’ algorithm was proved to be the most appropriate for predicting the organoleptic properties of the <b>matured</b> <b>wine</b> distillates. The rules that are exported by the algorithm are as accurate as human expert’s decisions. ...|$|E

In the past scientists have carried out experiments on <b>maturing</b> <b>wine</b> quickly using ultrasounds or gamma radiations. This study reports about <b>maturing</b> <b>wine</b> with high electric field at different frequencies applied for a short time duration. The electric field intensity and the frequency of the field along with the exposure time of wine to this field seem to be important parameters that could affect the the treated wine.

40|$|Maturation of wine, {{also called}} ageing, is an {{important}} process in making premium wine. During this process, many compounds change in concentration, and these changes are responsible for colour and flavour changes {{that contribute to the}} complexity of <b>matured</b> <b>wine.</b> However, ageing is an expensive process due to the time taken, frequently years, the cost of which cannot be recovered until sale. Alternating electrical fields have purportedly been shown to accelerate ageing of wine as judged by informal sensory trials, and by limited results in the scientific literature. This research aimed to quantity the changes due to electric fields in terms of sensory and chemical science. Wine ageing machines (WAM) equipped with alternating electric fields were used to treat red wines (Cabernet Merlot, Pinot Noir and Merlot Cabernet Sauvignon) and white wine (Sauvignon Blanc). There were three versions of WAM: a flow-through WAM from the University of Waikato, a flow-through WAM 2 (a modified version of the original), and a static WAM. In the first two, the wine flows through glass tubing between the charged plates 1 cm apart. In the static WAM, tubes containing wine are suspended between vertical plates. In the present study, electric fields were adjusted with different frequencies and strengths. The wines were physicochemically analysed by ultraviolet spectrometry, liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and liquid chromatography mass spectrometry/ mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Further, sensory tests were conducted between control wines and WAM-treated wines. Only flow-through WAM 2 treated Sauvignon Blanc appeared to show an absorbance difference in the wavelength range of 230 to 350 nm, but the difference was finally interpreted as artifactual arising from electronic noise in the spectrophotometer. Further, other WAM-treated wines did not show any sensory or colour differences compared with control wines that could not be attributed to noise. In LC-MS (/MS) studies, several compounds were shown to vary with treatment, notably 2 -furoic acid in white wine. However, the differences observed were inconsistent and might have been due to statistical variation that can arise in 1 in 20 events by chance alone. It was concluded that these WAMs had no effect on wine ageing in the manner they were applied here...|$|E

25|$|Ageing {{also brings}} other {{flavours}} to the wine. Barrel ageing creates scents of vanilla, butter, brioche, toast, caramel, etc. The long <b>maturing</b> <b>wines</b> like yellow wine or sherry have typical aromas of fresh walnuts, almonds, and hazelnuts.|$|R
50|$|Malolactic {{fermentation}} {{occurs when}} {{lactic acid bacteria}} metabolize malic acid and produce lactic acid and carbon dioxide. This is carried out either as an intentional procedure in which specially cultivated strains of such bacteria are introduced into the <b>maturing</b> <b>wine,</b> or it can happen by chance if uncultivated lactic acid bacteria are present.|$|R
50|$|Second hand wine auctions are {{arranged}} by many major auction houses, such as Christie's and Sotheby's.

50|$|Once {{the wines}} have been blended {{on a large}} scale, they are matured in tanks (in the case of {{smoother}} vintages) or in barrels (in the case of more robust vintages). <b>Maturing</b> a <b>wine</b> means storing it for long periods in cellars where the temperature is controlled and where it remains undisturbed apart from rackings that take place every three months. <b>Maturing</b> a <b>wine</b> that is stored in barrels can take between six and eighteen months.|$|R

5000|$|Beers are {{sometimes}} aged in barrels which were previously used for <b>maturing</b> <b>wines</b> or spirits. This is {{most common in}} darker beers such as stout, which is sometimes aged in oak barrels identical to those used for whiskey. Whiskey distiller Jameson notably purchases barrels used by Franciscan Well brewery for their Shandon Stout to produce a whiskey branded as [...] "Jameson Caskmates". Cask ale is aged in the barrel (usually steel) {{for a short time}} before serving. Extensive barrel aging is required of many sour beers.|$|R
25|$|After {{harvest the}} grapes are destemmed and crushed {{with a short}} {{maceration}} period, often with the must warmed up to aid in extraction of color and phenolics before the wines are pressed and put into barrel.

5000|$|A wine auction is {{an auction}} devoted to wine, {{sometimes}} {{in combination with}} other alcoholic beverages. There are two basic types of wine auctions: first hand wine auctions, where wineries sell their own wines, and second hand wine auctions, arranged by auction houses or other auctioneers {{to make it possible for}} any owners of wine to trade it. In most cases, the wines traded at wine auctions are collectible wine, so-called [...] "fine wine". These are wines which are typically suitable for extended cellaring, and where some of the buyers are looking for <b>mature</b> <b>wines</b> which are no longer available through first-hand retail channels.|$|R

In 1920s, over 3,200 soju breweries existed throughout the Korean Peninsula.|$|R
25|$|As {{red wine}} ages, the harsh tannins of its youth {{gradually}} {{give way to}} a softer mouthfeel. An inky dark color will eventually lose its depth of color and begin to appear orange at the edges, and then later eventually turning brown. These changes occur due to the complex chemical reactions of the phenolic compounds of the wine. In processes that begin during fermentation and continue after bottling, these compounds bind together and aggregate. Eventually these particles reach a certain size where they are too large to stay suspended in the solution and precipitate out. The presence of visible sediment in a bottle will usually indicate a <b>mature</b> <b>wine.</b> The resulting wine, with this loss of tannins and pigment, will have a paler color and taste softer, less astringent. The sediment, while harmless, can have an unpleasant taste and is often separated from the wine by decanting.|$|R

50|$|Generally {{the greater}} the amount of ullage, the more {{potential}} that the wine has been exposed to harmful levels of oxidation. This is why auction houses and retailers of <b>mature</b> <b>wines</b> {{pay close attention to}} the ullage levels in determining the resale value of the wine. The ullage level can also give insight as to the type of care and storage condition that the wine was kept in. Wines that have been kept at ambient humidity levels and in temperatures between 50-59°F (10-15°C) will experience evaporation and diffusion at a slower rate than wine kept in lesser conditions and will thus have a lower ullage levels. Ullage levels are generally important to the likelihood of almost any wine being in good shape. Vintage Port might be slightly less prone to damage since it is fortified, but the only wines that can not be damaged by oxidation are Madeira wines, which are already oxidized.|$|R
