5|$|A {{coronation}} is the act {{of placement}} or bestowal of a crown upon a monarch's head. The term generally also refers {{not only to the}} physical crowning but to the whole ceremony wherein {{the act of}} crowning occurs, along with the presentation of other items of regalia, marking the formal investiture of a <b>monarch</b> with regal power. Aside from the crowning, a coronation ceremony may comprise many other rituals such as the taking of special vows by the <b>monarch,</b> the investing and presentation of regalia to the <b>monarch,</b> and acts of homage by the new ruler's subjects and the performance of other ritual deeds of special significance to the particular nation. Western-style coronations have often included anointing the <b>monarch</b> with holy oil, or chrism as it is often called; the anointing ritual's religious significance follows examples found in the Bible. The monarch's consort may also be crowned, either simultaneously with the <b>monarch</b> or as a separate event.|$|E
5|$|A <b>monarch</b> is {{the head}} of a monarchy, a form of {{government}} in which a state or polity is ruled by an individual who normally rules for life or until abdication, and typically inherits the throne by birth. Monarchs may be autocrats (as in all absolute monarchies) or may be ceremonial figureheads, exercising only limited or no reserve powers at all, with actual authority vested in a legislature and/or executive cabinet (as in many constitutional monarchies). In many cases, a <b>monarch</b> will also be linked with a state religion. Most states only have a single <b>monarch</b> at any given time, although a regent may rule when the <b>monarch</b> is a minor, not present, or otherwise incapable of ruling. Cases in which two monarchs rule simultaneously over a single state, as is the current situation in Andorra, are known as coregencies.|$|E
5|$|Eight {{years before}} her death, she had {{reportedly}} placed two-thirds of her money into trusts, {{for the benefit}} of her great-grandchildren. She left the bulk of her estate, estimated to be worth £70million, including paintings, Fabergé eggs, jewellery, and horses, to her surviving daughter, Queen Elizabeth II. As property passing from <b>monarch</b> to <b>monarch</b> is exempt from Inheritance Tax, as is property passing from the consort of a former <b>monarch</b> to the current <b>monarch,</b> a tax liability estimated at £28million (40 percent {{of the value of the}} estate) was not incurred. The most important pieces of art were transferred to the Royal Collection by Elizabeth II.|$|E

5|$|The Caribs who {{occupied}} {{the island of}} Saint Lucia in pre-Columbian times had a complex society, with hereditary kings and shamans. The present monarchy {{has its roots in}} the Dutch, French, and English monarchies, under the authority of which the island was first colonised in 1605, and later the British monarchy, as a Crown colony. On 22 February 1979, the country gained independence from the United Kingdom, retaining the then reigning <b>monarch,</b> Elizabeth II, as <b>monarch</b> of the newly created monarchy of Saint Lucia. The <b>monarch</b> is represented in the country by the Governor-General of Saint Lucia, currently Dame Pearlette Louisy.|$|E

5|$|The United Kingdom {{and fifteen}} other Commonwealth monarchies that {{share the same}} person as their <b>monarch</b> are called Commonwealth realms. The terms British monarchy and British <b>monarch</b> are {{frequently}} still employed {{in reference to the}} shared individual and institution; however, each country is sovereign and independent of the others, and the <b>monarch</b> has a different, specific, and official national title and style for each realm.|$|E
5|$|The <b>monarch</b> {{also has}} power to {{exercise}} her prerogative over {{the granting of}} honours, the regulation {{of the armed forces}} and ecclesiastical appointments. Although the granting of most honours is normally decided by the executive, the <b>monarch</b> is still the person who technically awards them. Exceptions to this rule are membership of the Order of the Garter, the Order of the Thistle, the Order of Merit, the Royal Victorian Order and the Royal Victorian Chain, which the <b>monarch</b> has complete discretion to grant. In relation to the armed forces, the <b>monarch</b> is the Commander in Chief, and members are regulated under the royal prerogative. Most statutes do not apply to the armed forces, although some areas, such as military discipline, are governed by Acts of Parliament. Under the Crown Proceedings Act 1947, the <b>monarch</b> is the sole authority for the armed forces, and as such their organisation, disposition and control cannot be questioned by the courts. This exercise of prerogative power gives the Crown authority to recruit members of the armed forces, appoint commissioned officers, and establish agreements with foreign governments to station troops in their territory. The prerogative empowers the <b>monarch</b> to appoint bishops and archbishops in the Church of England, and to regulate the printing and licensing of the authorised Church of England version of the Bible. The <b>monarch</b> also exerts a certain influence power on His or Her weekly and closed conversations with the Prime-Minister of the United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|The <b>monarch</b> {{and his or}} her {{immediate}} family undertake various official, ceremonial, diplomatic and representational duties. As the monarchy is constitutional, the <b>monarch</b> is limited to non-partisan functions such as bestowing honours and appointing the Prime Minister. The <b>monarch</b> is, by tradition, commander-in-chief of the British Armed Forces. Though the ultimate formal executive authority over the government of the United Kingdom is still by and through the monarch's royal prerogative, these powers may only be used according to laws enacted in Parliament and, in practice, within the constraints of convention and precedent.|$|E

50|$|While the {{practice}} of transferring <b>monarchs</b> {{from place to place}} is generally not condoned by scientists, some reciprocal transfers of tagged <b>monarchs</b> have demonstrated that <b>monarchs</b> from east of the Rocky Mountains will migrate south if transferred west, in the range of the western population (rather than SW). <b>Monarchs</b> transferred from Nebraska to Oregon will also migrate south.|$|R

25|$|In {{addition}} to the disease risks, researchers believe these captive-reared <b>monarchs</b> are not as fit as wild ones, owing to the unnatural conditions they are raised in. Homeowners often raise <b>monarchs</b> in plastic or glass containers in their kitchens, basements, porches, etc., and under artificial lighting and controlled temperatures. Such conditions would not mimic what the <b>monarchs</b> are used to in the wild, and may result in adult <b>monarchs</b> that are unsuited for the realities of their wild existence. In support of this, {{a recent study by}} a citizen scientist found that captive-reared <b>monarchs</b> have a lower migration success rate than wild <b>monarchs</b> do.|$|R
