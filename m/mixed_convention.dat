The friction factor and Nusselt number between forced convection and mixed convection under uniform heat flux and non-uniform heat flux are analyzed quantitatively. The effect of solar elevation angel on the fluid flow and heat transfer is also investigated. We found {{that it is not}} feasible to perform the heat transfer design and prediction for parabolic trough solar collector based on the experimental correlations for forced convection or traditional <b>mixed</b> <b>convention...</b>|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn this work, {{the impact}} of Brownian motion and thermophoresis on heat and mass {{transfer}} flow over a horizontal circular cylinder embedded in porous media filled with nanofluid is numerically examined. The transformed boundary layer equations for momentum, temperature and concentration subject to the appropriate boundary conditions are solved numerically by using an optimized, efficient and extensively validated Finite element method. The influence of the non-dimensional parameters such as the buoyancy ratio parameter (Nr), <b>mixed</b> <b>convention</b> parameter (Ra), thermophoresis parameter (Nt), Brownian motion parameter (Nb), tangential coordinate (ξ) and the Lewis parameter (Le) on velocity, temperature and concentration evolutions in the boundary layer region is analyzed in detail {{and the results are}} shown graphically. The local Nusselt number and the local Sherwood number are also investigated for various values of these non-dimensional parameters and the results are shown in tabular form. The comparison of present results with existing results shows good agreement...|$|E
40|$|The law of {{jurisdiction}} {{and of the}} recognition and enforcement of foreign judgments is confused. So is the debate about it. Basic concepts, even that {{of jurisdiction}}, have ambiguous meaning. Misunderstandings, most prominent in the failure to conclude a worldwide judgments convention at the Hague, are the consequence. This article tries to bring conceptual clarity to the field through an analysis of concepts and relations. The article first shows that jurisdiction as a requirement for the rendering of a decision (direct jurisdiction) and jurisdiction as a requirement for the decision 2 ̆ 7 s enforceability elsewhere (indirect jurisdiction), are logically independent from each other. It goes on {{to show that the}} three possible values of deontic logic - obligatory, optional, and impermissible conduct - are reflected in three possible statuses that jurisdictional bases can have: such bases may be required, excluded, or permitted. A combination of both distinctions leads to nine different possible combinations of direct and indirect jurisdiction. The article analyzes each of these nine in detail. Such an analysis is crucial for the drafting of judgment conventions. Traditionally, a distinction existed between so-called single conventions that regulate only enforcement of foreign judgments, and double conventions that regulate also direct jurisdiction. Arthur von Mehren, for whose memorial volume this article is written, developed a third category, the so-called <b>mixed</b> <b>convention.</b> Although it represented a considerable improvement, the exact structure of <b>mixed</b> <b>convention</b> never became fully clear. This article proposes a new typology that is both richer and more exact. Although the article draws on rich comparative material from existing conventions, and although it emphasizes repeatedly the normative implications both of different values for jurisdictional bases and of different types of conventions, the article 2 ̆ 7 s prime aim is analytical, not normative. However, far from being a mere formalist exercise, such an analysis lays the indispensable prerequisites for a proper normative analysis. The definition of clear concepts does not guarantee proper policy debates, but without clear concepts policy debate is impossible. In this sense, the paper hopes to help provide new foundations for such debates...|$|E

One group received vocabulary instruction through standard code mixing in which an L 1 lexical item was incorporated within an L 2 context; another received the same instruction through reversed code mixing, which involved {{the use of an}} L 2 lexical item within an L 1 context. The third group was a comparison group that was presented with the same words in English sentences without any code mixing. At the end of the treatment, multiple-choice and fill-in-the-blanks vocabulary tests were administered to all three groups. The gathered data were analyzed using two separate one-way ANOVA procedures. Results indicated that code <b>mixing</b> <b>conventions</b> had no significant effect on the learners' vocabulary recognition. As to vocabulary production, the comparison group outperformed the standard code mixing group in a statistically significant way.

Each player plays the repeated {{game with a}} fixed but endogenous aspiration, a payoff level that is considered “satisfac-tory”. Choice probabilities are modified by experience: satisfactory payoff experiences positively reinforce probability weights on chosen actions, while unsatisfactory expe-riences cause other actions to be tried. Our equilibrium notion requires consistency, equality of aspiration levels with long run average payoffs, and stability, robustness of outcomes with respect to random perturbations of each player’s state. Our main result identifies the set of equilibrium pure strategy conventions: this comprises all efficient, strongly individually rational outcomes, and protected Nash equilibria. Extensions to <b>mixed</b> strategy <b>conventions,</b> and applications to games of coordination, cooperation and oligopoly are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Steampunk is a {{progressive}} literary genre that evokes, imitates, and re-imagines {{the nineteenth century}} and favors the Industrial Revolution ideals of science and technology. In a historical framework, it <b>mixes</b> nineteenth-century <b>conventions</b> and retrofuturistic machinery with science fiction and fantasy elements. Steampunk authors are able to radically redefine socio-cultural implications that affect both past and contemporary societies. The following study explores the multitude of characteristics that define Steampunk literature as an interdisciplinary study. Chapter 1 explores the definitions and literary genres that construct Steampunk and includes a brief literary history of Steampunk works. Chapter 2 focuses on Cherie Priest’s novel Boneshaker (2009), which depicts self-sufficient females battling hardships in America’s last frontier. Chapter 3 looks at how Cassandra Clare’s Infernal Devices series (2010 - 2013) illustrates female identity as a performance in an age of technological progression and cultural revolutions. The female characters in Priest’s and Clare’s novels resist hegemonic conventions and create an alternative vision of nineteenth-century women...|$|R

40|$|O estudo aqui apresentado surge da necessidade de {{responder}} a questões muitas vezes levantadas durante o processo de mistura de som para cinema em surround 5. 1. O grande objectivo desta dissertação é tentar perceber a que se deve o estabelecimento de determinadas tendências de misturas implementadas desde os primórdios da utilização do sistema surround 5. 1. De forma a recolher informação foram realizados 3 projetos: uma análise da mistura de filmes reconhecidos pelos Óscares da da Academia; entrevistas a técnicos de som, quer de mistura quer de captação; e um exercício de re-mistura. Com os resultados obtidos da análise dos filme permitiu-se perceber a evolução de alguns aspectos das misturas de som, dando, assim, origem a alguns dos tópicos discutidos durante as entrevistas. Com o exercício da re-mistura, onde diferentes técnicos tiveram que misturar os mesmos 5 minutos de uma curta-metragem, foi possível evidenciar que {{de facto}} existe uma componente humana durante o processo de mistura e que por isso os resultados vão ser diferentes, tornando-se, assim, num processo muito subjectivo. Partindo dos resultados adquiridos conclui-se que existe uma série de factores, como a evoluresstecnolóecno e a interpretação artítica dos misturadores, que influenciaram e influenciam as escolhas estéticas. Sendo a tecnologia como principal influente no processo de mistura, seria pertinente saber que tecnologias melhoraram ou abriram portas a outros conceitos e fenómenos no processo de mistura de som para cinema. The study here presented originates {{from the need}} to answer questions that often arise {{during the process of}} sound mixing in 5. 1 surround for cinema. These questions focus on the reasons behind certains choices done during the mixing process, which implicitly have become <b>mixing</b> <b>conventions</b> or unwritten rules. That being said, the main objective of this dissertation is to understand what determined some of the mixing tendencies implemented {{since the beginning of the}} use of 5. 1 surround system. In order to collect information, three projects were designed: the analysis of films acknowledged by the Academy; interviews with sound engineers, wether re-recording mixers or recording engineers; and a re-mixing exercise. From the results gathered during the analysis, one was able to understand the evolution of certain aspects of sound mixing, which in turn elicited some of the topics dicussed during the interviews. With the re-mixing exercise, where different engineers had to mix the same 5 minutes of a short-film, it was shown that a human component does truly exist during the mixing process and because of that the results will be different, therefore consisting on a really subjective process. Based on the results acquired we can conclude that there are a series of elements, like the technological evolution and the artistic interpretation from the mixers, that have influenced and still influence the aesthetic choices, Considering that technology is the main influential element in the sound mixing process, it would be interesting to know which technologies improved or opened the door to other concepts or tendencies during sound mixing for film...|$|R
40|$|There {{has been}} much written on Boethius and his impact on Chaucer 2 ̆ 7 s greater known works, such as The Canterbury Tales and Troilus and Criseyde, yet {{there has not been}} much light shone on his other works, namely The Book of the Duchess, The Parliament of Fowls, and The House of Fame, which are a rich <b>mix</b> of medieval <b>conventions</b> and Boethian {{elements}} and themes. Such ideas have been explored through the lenses of his five, shorter 2 ̆ 2 Boethian lyrics 2 ̆ 2 - 2 ̆ 2 The Former Age, 2 ̆ 2 2 ̆ 2 Fortune, 2 ̆ 2 2 ̆ 2 Truth, 2 ̆ 2 2 ̆ 2 Gentilesse, 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 Lak of Stedfastnesse 2 ̆ 2 - particularly because it is within these five poems that the metafictional narrative approach or framing of Chaucer 2 ̆ 7 s Boethiusinfluenced work, through narration and possible consolations, are fleshed out and brought into focus. However, the 2 ̆ 2 Boethian lyrics 2 ̆ 2 are not necessary {{in the study of the}} three earlier poems The Book of the Duchess, The Parliament of Fowls, and The House of Fame. Using the convention of the frame tale with the dream vision in these three poems allows for the narrator to be brought to an understanding in each of these texts, strongly suggesting that this approach is something that Chaucer came across in Boethius 2 ̆ 7 s The Consolation of Philosophy. To merely go through and catalogue all Boethian elements as lifted directly from Consolation would accomplish nothing but a catalog of similarities. In that same vein, to analyze the 2 ̆ 2 Boethian poems 2 ̆ 2 would also be treading over familiar scholarly ground. In examining an intermediary group of texts as a bridge between Boethius 2 ̆ 7 s classical philosophy and Chaucer 2 ̆ 7 s courtly poetry, particularly The Book of the Duchess, The Parliament of Fowls and The House of Fame, this more concretely shows the extent of Boethius 2 ̆ 7 s coloring injected into Chaucer 2 ̆ 7 s writings from early in his writing career. Through close readings and secondary outside research, I am confident that another chapter of Chaucerian scholarship, one that has rarely been explored, much less written, can be added...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the Filth’s transgression of documentary modes in its counter-historical retelling of the Sex Pistols’ career. Filth’s subversion of conventional film documentary narrative and formal patterns are examined, with specific {{attention to the}} transgression of Nicholls’s modal theory of ‘nonfiction’ cinema. Filth is proposed as a key text {{in the development of}} new approaches to documentary film-making, by interrogating its wayward, counter-cultural style. Filth would perhaps be more aptly described as counter-history than documentary. Its relationship to history and facticity will be explored by uncovering its playfulness with form and convention, as well as its use of Shakespeare’s Richard III as a mischievous subversion of the common documentary gambit of narrative parallelism. Rather than inventing new modes of representation, counter-hegemonic cinema often subverts existing <b>conventions.</b> <b>Mixing</b> familiar conventional genre signifiers with counter-hegemonic, marginal or transgressive forms highlights differences, destabilises expectations and communicates more effectively with a broader audience. Filth’s bricolage of disparate elements consists of what its director, Julien Temple, refers to as “scattershot use of archive” footage interspersed with new interviews. The result is problematic for documentary film theory; Filth transgresses and even parodies established documentary forms. While in some superficial aspects Filth follows the ‘rockumentary’ format, the film formally and structurally deviates from the conventions of this style. We could instead try to categorise Filth as an independent example of rhetorical form, with its emotive and argumentative elements. Yet, despite its rhetorical tone, the plethora of opposing viewpoints transgresses and even parodies the persuasive purpose of rhetorical documentary-making. Narrators disagree, images clash and, while the audience may feel the pressure to be persuaded, the anarchic mix of viewpoints makes it difficult to extrapolate a clear rhetorical line of argument. One means by which to clarify Filth’s transgressions is to apply Nichols’s modes of documentary film. While the possibility of a single text combining more than one mode is not directly denied, nevertheless Nichols tends to explain each mode in terms of its difference from the others, implying mutual exclusivity. Yet Filth transgresses every one of these modes. If the modes are viewed as more dynamic and flexible than Nichols originally proposed, however, they remain invaluable as a tool for understanding this example of late postmodern documentary. Just as an early modern history play might present a politically manipulated counter-historical chronicle, postmodern oppositional documentary can retell the past through a perspective of resistance or taking an openly biased socio-political viewpoint. This parallel function clarifies the apparently incongruous appropriation of Olivier’s Richard III in Filth, notwithstanding the obvious deliberate punk impudence of brutally splicing Olivier’s treasured ‘classic’. The figure of Shakespeare’s Richard, through Olivier’s film, binds Filth’s narrative in every major plot development: such as when Johnny Rotten joins the band, when ‘God Save the Queen’ is released and when the band self-destructs. An audience’s desire for realism in terms of causality, is key to creating a conventionally satisfying narrative, and in a documentary one could assume that this desire is easily satisfied given the ‘reality’ of the subject. Yet the other aspect of narrative an audience desires most is likely to be resolution and structure: a beginning, middle and end to the ‘story’, which may be harder for a feature documentary to deliver. Many documentaries avoid the challenge of actual resolution by providing some “new light” on their subjects, just as Filth openly claims to do. However, the recoding of Richard III in Filth also props up the narrative by transposing a parallel ‘reality’ that has been ready-fashioned into a plot. What this film represents in its style and its form is an attempt to capture on film the bricolage, the anarchy and the fun of punk. Yet it is ironic that only via technologies unavailable to the rebels of the 70 s can the quick-fire, scattershot style can be achieved. A last grasp towards the visceral rebellion of the early days of punk may, in Filth, ironically become a herald of the coming communicative strategies of 21 st Century New Media – the short clip or home made montage of YouTube replacing the painstaking physical processes of film editing. Yet Filth, riding roughshod over every attempt to compartmentalise documentary, legitimises instead the power of retelling – and epitomises the plurality of counterhistories...|$|R
