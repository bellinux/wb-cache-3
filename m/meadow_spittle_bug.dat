50|$|Lepyronia quadrangularis is {{a species}} of <b>spittle</b> <b>bug</b> {{that can be found}} in many places in the world. The adults are {{brownish}} with two oblique darker brown bands that strike across their fore wings (hemelytra). The fore wings are also marked with a small blackish curve at their tips. The eggs are laid between the leaf and the main stem of grasses from midsummer to late fall. The nymphs feed and molt under spittle and hibernate in the egg stage. Lepyronia quadrangularis is polyphagous, feeding upon a variety of grasses, shrubs, and herbs. Its common name is diamond-backed <b>spittle</b> <b>bug.</b>|$|R
40|$|Meadow spittlebug, Philaenus spumarius (L.), has {{recently}} been a subject of interest to biologists due to various genetic factors. This species is widely distributed and {{has been reported to}} exist {{in different parts of the}} world. Dlabola reported the species for the first time from Iran. A number of studies have been done on substantial activities of this <b>spittle</b> <b>bug</b> on Alhaghi pseudalhagi (M. Bieb.) Desv. camel thorn plant from Fabaceae family in Mashhad region, Khorasan Razavi during 2005 - 2006. In weekly investigations, it was noted that the spittlebug begins its activity from early spring as first instars and produces froth after nourishing on camel thorn plant. The bug had 5 instar ages in total and they spend the whole first year of their lives in their self-produced foam. The adult <b>spittle</b> <b>bug</b> appeared in late May without any froth production activity however, they produced a thin√Ç liquid-like discharge. This spittlebug had 3 generations on the camel thorn plant among which, unlike the first generation instars, the 2 nd and the 3 rd instars had fully grown wings, were able to move freely on the plant and were resilient to some extent. The latter generations did not produce any froth and still had a very thin discharge which moisturized the total body of the plant as well as the ground around it. Density of the 2 nd and the 3 rd generations of <b>spittle</b> <b>bugs</b> were higher than the first generation. Those <b>spittle</b> <b>bugs</b> from the 3 rd generation which managed to reach their adulthood, mated and after laying eggs, entered their hibernation period. According to our investigations, duration of one generation of the <b>spittle</b> <b>bug</b> in Mashhad region fluctuates from approximately 60 - 83 days in spring and 44 - 56 days in summer. The population of the bug reached its maximum in summer in 2006 and early summer in 2007. We found out that the bug, among all different species of camel thorn plant in natural growth areas, is only activating on few specific species of the plant...|$|R

50|$|The main {{threat to}} the species is the loss and {{degradation}} of its habitat. Most of the land on which it grows has {{been taken over by}} non-native plants. It is also threatened by erosion caused by the activity of feral goats. The plants are eaten by mice, rats, and the <b>spittle</b> <b>bug</b> Claspoptera xanthocephala.|$|R
50|$|The {{existence}} of troll cats {{appears to be}} related to the observation of matter (such as hair) regurgitated by cattle. The slime mold Fuligo septica and the foam made by <b>spittle</b> <b>bugs</b> were seen as troll cat droppings. Also offered as an explanation for the belief in troll cats is the Norwegian Forest Cat, a particularly long-haired cat native to Northern Europe.|$|R
40|$|Locris rubens (Erichson) (Cercopidae: Homoptera) and Poophilus costalis (Walker) (Aphrophoridae: Homoptera) are endemic pests of sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench) in Nigeria {{and some}} other {{countries}} in West and Central Africa. Other hosts are maize, pearl millet, rice, sugarcane, and grasses. On sorghum, L. rubens lays eggs in the epidermis of the leaf sheath. There are five nymphal instars and development from egg to adult takes about 33 days. Both species of <b>spittle</b> <b>bugs</b> feed on all growth stages and all parts of sorghum, including the panicle. Feeding symptoms include yellow leaf blotching. Severe infestations often kill young leaves and plants...|$|R
40|$|A {{comprehensive}} review of cytogenetic features is provided for the large hemipteran suborder Auchenorrhyncha, which currently contains approximately 42, 000 valid species. This review {{is based on the}} analysis of 819 species, 483 genera, and 31 families representing all presently recognized Auchenorrhyncha superfamilies, e. i. Cicadoidea (cicadas), Cercopoidea (<b>spittle</b> <b>bugs),</b> Membracoidea (leafhoppers and treehoppers), Myerslopioidea (ground-dwelling leafhoppers), and Fulgoroidea (planthoppers). History and present status of chromosome studies are described, as well as the structure of chromosomes, chromosome counts, trends and mechanisms of evolution of karyotypes and sex determining systems, their variation at different taxonomic levels and most characteristic (modal) states, occurrence of parthenogenesis, polyploidy, B-chromosomes and chromosome rearrangements, and methods used for cytogenetic analysis of Auchenorrhyncha...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: 1. Root hemiparasites {{are common}} {{components}} of many ecosystems and can affect both the biomass and the nutritional {{quality of the}} plants they infect. The consequences of these modifications for the preference and performance of three herbivore feeding guilds sharing a host with the hemi-parasite were examined. 2. It was predicted that as the hemiparasite increased in biomass {{its impact on the}} host would increase, as would the indirect impacts on the herbivores. It was also predicted that herbivores from different feeding guilds would respond differently to the presence of the hemiparasite, reflecting {{the extent to which they}} utilise resources disrupted by the parasite and hence are in competition with it. 3. The preference and performance of phloem-feeding aphids, xylem-feeding <b>spittle</b> <b>bugs,</b> and leaf-feeding grasshoppers were measured on the host grass species, Holcus lanatus L. (Poaceae), with and without attachment from the hemi-parasite, Rhinanthus minor L. (Orobanchaceae). 4. The effects of R. minor on the host were dependent on the hemiparasite's stage of growth, being most pronounced when it was at peak biomass. At this stage it caused a significant reduction in the biomass, water content, and total nitrogen content of the host plants. 5. Overall, herbivores benefited from, or preferred, shared host plants more than uninfected plants. The aphid benefited from sharing a host with R. minor, showing increased population growth on, and preference for, parasitised plants. The <b>spittle</b> <b>bug</b> also showed a preference for parasitised plants. The grasshopper, Chorthippus brunneus Thunberg (Orthoptera: Acrididae), did not show a preference for, or a performance response to, parasitised hosts, but it consumed significantly more plant material when caged on parasitised plants. 6. These data support the prediction that invertebrate herbivores responded to changes in host plant traits driven by the hemiparasite, and strongly suggest that these indirect interactions could impact on population and community processes within natural communitie...|$|R
40|$|The infraorder Cicadomorpha is a {{monophyletic}} {{group of}} the order Hemiptera, suborder Auchenorrhyncha, and is composed of three superfamilies: Cercopoidea (<b>spittle</b> <b>bugs),</b> Cicadoidea (cicadas) and Membracoidea (leafhoppers and treehoppers). Phylogenetic relationships among the superfamilies have been highly controversial morphologically and molecularly, but recent molecular phylogenetic analyses provided support for Cercopoidea + Cicadoidea. In this study, we examined morphology of the wing base structure in Cicadomorpha and tested the previous phylogenetic hypotheses using the characters selected from the wing base. As a result, a sister-group relationship between Cicadoidea and Cercopoidea was supported by three synapomorphies (presence of a projection posterior to the anterior notal wing process, presence of a novel notal process anterior to the posterior notal wing process, presence of a novel sclerite between the distal median plate and the base of anal vein). The present study provides the first unambiguous and prominent morphological support for Cicadoidea + Cercopoidea...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{experiments}} that tested whether diverse plant communities have lower invasibility have all varied species richness. We experimentally varied evenness of four grassland species (three grasses and one forb) by planting a field experiment in Texas, and monitored {{the number of}} unplanted dicot and monocot species that invaded plots for two growing seasons. By varying evenness, we eliminated any sampling effect in our diversity treatment, because all plots contained the same plant species. Experimentally reducing evenness led to {{a greater number of}} dicot invaders, which emerged in plots throughout the growing season, but had less of an effect on monocot invaders, which emerged in flushes when experimental plants were semi-dormant. Frequency of Solidago canadensis (altissima) stems with <b>spittle</b> <b>bugs</b> significantly increased with reductions in evenness during the first year, apparently because the greater number of Solidago stems in high evenness plots diluted the spittle-bug effect. These results support the view that higher diversity plant communities are more resistant to dicot invaders and insect herbivores...|$|R
40|$|The {{incidence}} {{and distribution of}} the sorghum head bug, E. oldi (Heteroptera: Miridae), and other panicle pests of sorghum in research stations and farmers' fields in West and Central Africa (WCA) were assessed during 1985 - 94. Maximum head bug abundance was observed during the dough stage. Head bug abundance was greater on improved cultivars (CSM 388, Malisor 84 - 7, ICSV 1063, ICSV 247 and ICSH 507), while the local sorghum cultivar guineense with long glumes was less susceptible, both at the research stations and in farmers' fields. Grain damage was moderate to severe, although farmers were mostly unaware of this insect and its damage potential because it remains hidden inside the panicle. Sorghum midge (Stenodiplosis sorghicola) damage was very high in farmers' fields in Burkina Faso, Niger, and Nigeria. The shootfly Atherigona soccata, stemborer Busseola fusca, grasshoppers, <b>spittle</b> <b>bugs</b> Locris rubens, Campylomma spp., Creontiades pallidus and Agonoscelis spp., head caterpillars Helicoverpa armigera, Pyroderces simplex and Eublemma gayneri, were other insect pests which damaged sorghum in the areas surveyed. It is proposed that future efforts in sorghum improvement for WCA should focus on developing cultivars with resistance to sorghum head bugs...|$|R
40|$|Resilin is {{a member}} of a family of elastic {{proteins}} that includes elastin, as well as gluten, gliadin, abductin and spider silks. Resilin is found in specialized regions of the cuticle of most insects, providing low stiffness, high strain and efficient energy storage 1, 2; it is best known for its roles in insect flight 3, 4 and the remarkable jumping ability of fleas 5, 6 and <b>spittle</b> <b>bugs</b> 7. Previously, the Drosophila melanogaster CG 15920 gene was tentatively identified as one encoding a resilin-like protein 8, 9 (pro-resilin). Here we report the cloning and expression of the first exon of the Drosophila CG 15920 gene as a soluble protein in Escherichia coli. We show that this recombinant protein can be cast into a rubber-like biomaterial by rapid photochemical crosslinking. This observation validates the role of the putative elastic repeat motif in resilin function. The resilience (recovery after deformation) of crosslinked recombinant resilin was found to exceed that of unfilled synthetic polybutadiene, a high resilience rubber. We believe that our work will greatly facilitate structural investigations into the functional properties of resilin and shed light on more general aspects of the structure of elastomeric proteins. In addition, the ability to rapidly cast samples of this biomaterial may enable its use in situ for both industrial and biomedical applications...|$|R
50|$|Paleontological and {{geological}} {{studies of}} similar deposits to Driftwood Canyon occurring {{to the east}} and further south in the interior of British Columbia go back to work carried out by George Mercer Dawson and John William Dawson in the 1870s to 1890s as part of the survey of British Columbia for the Geological Survey of Canada, and D.P. Penhallow's work on Cenozoic Era plants. Fossil fish from Driftwood Canyon in the Canadian Museum of Nature include specimens collected in the 1930s; however, the Driftwood Canyon (also known as Driftwood Creek beds) fossils have only been studied since the 1950s. The Driftwood Canyon fossil beds are best known for the abundant and well-preserved insect and fish fossils (Amia, Amyzon, and Eosalmo). The insects are particularly diverse and well preserved, and include water striders (Gerridae), aphids (Aphididae), leaf hoppers (Cicadellidae), green lacewings (Neuroptera), <b>spittle</b> <b>bugs</b> (Cercopidae), march flies (Bibionidae), scorpionflies (Mecoptera), fungus gnats (Mycetophilidae), snout beetles (Curculionidae), and ichneumon wasps. A fossil species of green lacewing (Neuroptera, Chrysopidae) was recently named Pseudochrysopa harveyi to honour the founder of the park, Gordon Harvey. Fossil feathers are sometimes found and rare rodent bones are sometimes found in fish coprolites. Most recently, fossil palm beetles (Bruchidae) were described from the beds, confirming the presence of palms (Arecaceae) in the local environment in the early Eocene.|$|R
40|$|Resilin is {{a member}} of the family of {{elastomeric}} proteins and is found in specialised regions of the cuticle of most insects, and provides low stiffness, high strain and efficient energy storage. It is best known for its role in insect flight and the remarkable jumping ability of fleas and <b>spittle</b> <b>bugs.</b> In common with other elastomeric proteins, the recently identified Drosophila melanogaster proresilin shows glycine-rich repetitive sequences; in particular the N- and C-terminal regions of the protein are dominated by 18 repeats of a 15 -residue sequence (SDTYGAPGGGNGGRP) and eleven repeats of a 13 -residue sequence (GYSGGRPGGQDLG), respectively. We synthesised and analysed the molecular and supramolecular structure of some polypeptides with sequences belonging to the glycine-rich repeated domain of D. melanogaster resilin. The conformational studies performed by CD, FTIR and NMR spectroscopies pointed to the coexistence of two main conformational features, such as folded beta-turns and (quasi) extended structures (e. g., poly-L-proline II conformation) in common with other elastomeric proteins; this suggests an elasticity mechanism for resilin common to other elastomeric proteins. Our data show that also in the case of resilin, repetitive sequences are characterised by autonomous structures almost independent of the remaining parts of the molecule as already extensively found for elastin. From a supramolecular point of view, a great tendency to aggregate in fibrous structures is observed, particularly for the resilin- inspired polypeptide (PGGGN) (10). This is encouraging for the development of resilin-based biomaterials for the production of biocompatible medical devices, as well as high performing elastic materials...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Arthropod photoreceptors are {{versatile}} sense organs. Any {{investigation of}} these organs has {{to consider that}} their structure and functional limitations {{at the moment of}} fixation depend on many factors: species, sex, developmental and nutritional state of the animal, time of day and ambient light. The microscopic image of an arthropod photoreceptor is always a sample frozen in time and space. Quite often publications on arthropod photoreceptors only provide the name of the species studied, but nothing beyond that. At least the developmental status of the study animals ought to be noted, possibly even the sex and body size. Forty publications on insect and 54 on crustacean photoreceptors were checked for the information that was given about the investigated animals: Out of these papers 40 % provide only information on the name of the studied species and nothing else. The aim of this thesis, thus, was to investigate, to what extent the developmental state and the sex of the animal as well as the ambient light conditions affect the structure of the eye of a given species. Five species of arthropods were chosen: (a) the semi-terrestrial isopod Ligia exotica and two aquatic Branchiuran fishlice, Argulus foliaceus and A. coregoni, to represent the Crustacea, and (b) the stick insect Carausius morosus and the <b>spittle</b> <b>bug</b> Philaenus spumarius, both terrestrial, to represent the Insecta. The addition of new ommatidia was studied in a paper on L. exotica, which also dealt with the site of newly added ommatidia. It was found that all of these species had two sessile, large compound eyes firmly positioned on their heads (but fishlouse compound eyes were bathed in haemocoelic liquid). In all species, the compound eye was found to be of the apposition type. The gross structural organization of the ommatidia stayed approximately the same during the whole post-embryonic development. Lateral ocelli of the A. coregoni nauplius eye changed from elongated to spherical between the metanauplius and the 8 th stage pre-adult. The sex of the specimens was not found to affect the structure of the eye. In all species, {{it turned out that the}} larger the animal and hence the eye, the better its sensitivity. The addition of new ommatidia in the L. exotica compound eye was concluded to take place in the anterior and ventral marginal areas of the eye...|$|R
