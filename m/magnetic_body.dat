METHODS: Data {{were collected on}} 13 patients with ocular penetrating and perforating injuries combined with traumatic cataracts and <b>magnetic</b> foreign <b>bodies</b> in the anterior part of the vitreous cavity who underwent a simple modified removal surgery. Under direct vision of binocular indirect ophthalmoscope, the intraocular earth magnet was applied to remove the <b>magnetic</b> foreign <b>bodies</b> after clearance of the turbid lens and prolapsed vitreous. Postsurgical intraocular reaction and recovery of the visual function were observed and evaluated. RESULTS: Under the direct vision, by using this surgery method, all the <b>magnetic</b> foreign <b>bodies</b> were successfully removed smooth and fast. No complication such as secondary bleeding or infection occurred. Corrected visual acuity has been improved obviously in all these patients who underwent operation. The postoperative follow up of 6 mo showed that the BCVA of 10 cases was > 0. 3. BCVA of the other 3 cases was 0. 1 - 0. 3.

40|$|Geophysical {{data and}} surface geology define intertonguing thrust wedges {{that form the}} upper crust in the San Gorgonio Pass region. This picture serves {{as the basis for}} {{inferring}} past fault movements within the San Andreas system, which are fundamental to understanding the tectonic evolution of the San Gorgonio Pass region. Interpretation of gravity data indicates that sedimentary rocks have been thrust at least 5 km in the central part of San Gorgonio Pass beneath basement rocks of the southeast San Bernardino Mountains. Subtle, long-wavelength magnetic anomalies indicate that a <b>magnetic</b> <b>body</b> extends in the subsurface north of San Gorgonio Pass and south under Peninsular Ranges basement, and has a southern edge that is roughly parallel to, but 5 – 6 km south of, the surface trace of the Banning fault. This deep <b>magnetic</b> <b>body</b> is composed either of upper-plate rocks of San Gabriel Mountains basement or rocks of San Bernardino Mountains basement or both. We suggest that transpression across the San Gorgonio Pass region drove a wedge of Peninsular Ranges basement and its overlying sedimentary cover northward into the San Bernardino Mountains during the Neogene, offsetting the Banning fault at shallow depth. Average rates of convergence implied by this offset are broadly consistent with estimates of convergence from other geologic and geodetic data. Seismicity suggests a deeper detachment surface beneath the deep <b>magnetic</b> <b>body.</b> This interpretation suggests that the fault mapped at the surface evolved not only in map but also in cross-sectional view.

In this paper, simple two-dimensional magnetic and gravity models are constructed utilizing parameters such as the density contrast and susceptibilities obtained from a borehole, seismic sections and field susceptibility measurements, respectively. The gravity model shows the existence of horst-like structures, as suggested previously. The top of the <b>magnetic</b> <b>bodies</b> in the Marmara Sea {{is close to the}} sea bottom.

Geophysical data and modeling results suggest that the origin and evaluation of the Marmara Sea began with the possibility of emplacement of horst-like structures in the Central Ridge during the Palaeozoic or earlier followed by block rotations and intrusion of the magnetic material into the upper crust with sediment deposition and faulting. It can also be suggested that the horst-like structures in the central Marmara act to diffuse the propagation of the Northern Boundary Fault (NBF).

40|$|This paper investigates numerically a {{wave energy}} harness device-water {{interaction}} system excited {{by a wave}} maker motion in order to extract maximum wave energy. The model of the energy harness device consists of a moving coil connected to a <b>magnetic</b> <b>body</b> floating on the water surface of the towing tank. At {{one end of the}} towing tank, a wave maker produces waves to excite the device-water interaction system. The motion of the coil relative to the <b>magnetic</b> <b>body</b> produces an electromagnetic induction voltage added to an energy collection circuit, so that the kinetic energy of the coil motion is transformed to electric energy. To extract maximum energy from the wave requires a large relative motion between the coil and the <b>magnetic</b> <b>body</b> of the energy harness device. To this end, the natural frequency of the wave energy harness device should be so close to the wave frequency that a resonance of the wave energy device can be reached. Since the wave energy device floats on the water surface, its dynamic behaviour is affected by the water motion. Therefore, it is necessary to consider fluid-structure interactions to design an effective wave energy device. This problem is addressed in this paper. In this numerical simulation, the water is considered as a compressible fluid satisfying a wave equation in the water domain in association with the boundary conditions on the free surface, wall and bottom of the towing tank. The wave maker motion is simulated by a given boundary acceleration on the wet interface of the wave maker. The energy harness device is treated as a two masses connected by four springs between them. The spring stiffness can be adjusted to obtain an effective energy extraction device. On the interface between the <b>magnetic</b> <b>body</b> and the water, the equilibrium and motion consistent conditions are required. The governing equations describing the fluid-structure interaction dynamics of the integrated system are presented. A corresponding variational principle is formulated and a mixed finite element model is established. The developed computer program-FSIAP is used to complete the numerical simulations. Suitable parameters of the energy harness device are obtained. The dynamic responses of the integrated fluid-structure interaction system excited by the wave maker motions are calculated. It is shown that the designed energy harness device can extract maximum wave energy using the resonance principle. The results obtained are compared and discussed. Some guidelines for engineering applications are provided...|$|E

40|$|The idea of ”remote {{metabolism}} ” (or quantum credit card, as I {{have also}} called it) emerged {{more than a}} decade ago- and zero energy ontology (ZEO) provides the justification for it.
