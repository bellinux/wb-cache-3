5|$|Entanglement {{can result}} in {{mortality}} because when the seals get trapped in <b>marine</b> <b>debris</b> such as fishing nets they cannot maneuver or reach the surface to breathe. Marine fisheries can potentially interact with monk seals via direct and indirect relationships. Directly the seal can become snared by fishing equipment, entangled in discarded debris, and even feed on fish refuse. International law prohibits the intentional discarding of debris from ships at sea. Monk seals {{have one of the}} highest documented rates of entanglement of any pinniped species.|$|E

30|$|Accordingly, MP are {{considered}} an emerging global issue by various experts [[10],[11]] and international institutions [[12],[13]]. These concerns {{and the public}} interest, however, focus almost exclusively on <b>marine</b> plastic <b>debris.</b> However, we argue that microplastics are also freshwater contaminants of emerging concern. This is supported by three arguments. First, although data is scarce, MP are present in freshwater ecosystems. Second, MP contain and adsorb micropollutants and pathogens. Third, laboratory studies demonstrate that marine organisms ingest MP and suffer adverse effect. While data on freshwater species is scarce, {{there is no reason}} to suppose that they remain unaffected. Thus, concerns about the impact of MP on freshwater ecosystems are legitimate and should receive more scientific attention.|$|R
40|$|<b>Marine</b> plastic <b>debris</b> is {{a global}} problem that is {{threatening}} marine biodiversity. Different marine organisms {{have been exposed to}} the lethal and sub-lethal effects of this problem. Sub-lethal effects include reduced fitness due to reduced feeding, reduced reproductive output, limb amputation, and exposure to diseases and toxic materials, while lethal effects include drowning, gastro-intestinal blockage, and stomach rupture. Marine turtles are very vulnerable to these effects since these organisms actively ingest plastic mistaking it as prey. This adds stress to the declining population of marine turtles. On 17 April 2015, a dead adult female green turtle was recovered in Brgy. Lapu-lapu, Agdao, Davao City, Philippines. Necropsy showed that several plastic materials caused blockage in the pyloric end of the stomach which may have caused the turtle’s mortality. </p...|$|R

Deliberate disposal of wastes at sea is called ocean dumping. Naturally occurring debris, such as driftwood, are also present.|$|E
40|$|<b>Marine</b> plastic <b>debris</b> is well {{characterized}} {{in terms}} of its ability to negatively impact terrestrial and marine environments, endanger coastal wildlife, and interfere with navigation, tourism and commercial fisheries. However, the impacts of potentially harmful microorganisms and pathogens colonising plastic litter are not well understood. The hard surface of plastics provides an ideal environment for opportunistic microbial colonisers to form biofilms and might offer a protective niche capable of supporting a diversity of different microorganisms, known as the “Plastisphere”. This biotope could act as an important vector for the persistence and spread of pathogens, faecal indicator organisms (FIOs) and harmful algal bloom species (HABs) across beach and bathing environments. This review will focus on the existent knowledge and research gaps, and identify the possible consequences of plastic-associated microbes on human health, the spread of infectious diseases and bathing water quality...|$|R
40|$|Plastic is {{a common}} item in marine environments. Studies {{assessing}} seabird ingestion of plastics have focused on species that ingest plastics mistaken for prey items. Few studies have examined a scavenger and predatory species {{that are likely to}} ingest plastics indirectly through their prey items, such as the great skua (Stercorarius skua). We examined 1034 regurgitated pellets from a great skua colony in the Faroe Islands for plastics and found approximately 6 % contained plastics. Pellets containing remains of Northern fulmars (Fulmarus glacialis) had the highest prevalence of plastic. Our findings support previous work showing that Northern fulmars have higher loads of plastics than other sympatric species. This study demonstrates that <b>marine</b> plastic <b>debris</b> is transferred from surface feeding seabird species to predatory great skuas.

40|$|Abstract- This study aim to {{find the}} colonizing ability of {{cellulose}} degrading fungi which were derived from terrestrial sources, in sea water with salinity of 34 ‰, {{which can be used}} in degradation of <b>marine</b> algal <b>debris</b> in order to use as fertilizer. Algal debris is rich in minerals but due to its salt content it takes relatively longer time to degrade by microbes. Here the fungus Cladosporium sp. depicted the highest activity of 64. 01 FPU/ml. which was 20. 74 FPU/ml in CBM medium on the same substrate; this shows their preference as well as tolerance to marine environment. While Helminthosporium sp. showed the activity of 60. 65 FPU/ml which is also relatively higher than that of CBM medium, activity of fungal crude enzymes was evaluated in different temperature and varying pH medium, the optimum temperature for all given strains was 50 0 C while pH vary.

40|$|Recent {{surveys of}} <b>marine</b> plastic <b>debris</b> density have {{revealed}} high {{levels in the}} center of the subtropical gyres. Earlier studies have argued that the formation of great garbage patches is due to Ekman convergence in such regions. In this work we report a tendency so far overlooked of drogued and undrogued drifters to accumulate distinctly over the subtropical gyres, with undrogued drifters accumulating in the same areas where plastic debris accumulate. We show that the observed accumulation is too fast for Ekman convergence to explain it. We demonstrate that the accumulation is controlled by finite-size and buoyancy (i. e., inertial) effects on undrogued drifter motion subjected to ocean current and wind drags. We infer that the motion of flotsam in general is constrained by similar effects. This is done by using a newly proposed Maxey [...] Riley equation which models the submerged (surfaced) drifter portion as a sphere of the fractional volume that is submerged (surfaced).

40|$|Stable isotope {{analysis}} has provided crucial {{new insights into}} dietary change at the Neolithic transition in north-west Europe, indicating an unexpectedly sudden and radical shift from marine to terrestrial resources in coastal and island locations. Investigations of early Neolithic skeletal material from Sumburgh on Shetland, at the far-flung margins of the Neolithic world, suggest that this general pattern may mask significant subtle detail. Analysis of juvenile dentine reveals the consumption of marine foods on an occasional basis. This suggests that marine foods may have been consumed as a crucial supplementary resource in times of famine, when the newly introduced cereal crops failed {{to cope with the}} demanding climate of Shetland. This isotopic evidence is consistent with the presence of <b>marine</b> food <b>debris</b> in contemporary middens. The occasional and contingent nature of marine food consumption underlines how, even on Shetland, the shift from marine to terrestrial diet was a key element in the Neolithic transition...|$|R

25|$|Approximately {{one million}} short-tailed shearwaters return to Phillip Island from the Bering Straits, Alaska to breed in burrows each year. Historically, shearwaters were {{harvested}} {{for food and}} oil but are now protected in Victoria. The threat of fox predation on the colony has been largely reduced due to control and eradication, however township light pollution and the ingestion of marine plastics remain significant threats of which scientists are currently researching. Fledglings on their first flights to sea are attracted to artificial lights which disorientates their path and leaves many landing and stranded on roads. High mortality rates from road traffic were recorded until 1999, before a Shearwater Protection Program was established to remove and re-locate birds on roads to safer areas. A recent study on Phillip Island into plastic ingestion in shearwater fledglings found all sampled birds contained plastic particles, passed on from the fish caught by their parents, {{it has been found}} that shearwaters have a particularly high prevalence of <b>marine</b> <b>debris</b> in their systems.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Barium (Ba) is a {{trace element}} which occurs {{predominantly}} as barite mineral (BaSO 4) {{in the marine}} environment. Previous work suggests that barite concentrations {{are related to the}} organic carbon flux and <b>marine</b> biological <b>debris</b> in the water column suggesting a direct or indirect involvement in the marine biological cycling. In addition, barite has a high preservation rate (~ 30 %) in sediments and it is less affected by early diagenesis than other proxies for productivity such as carbonates (~ 10 %) and organic carbon (~ 1 %), for example. Therefore, Ba is considered an excellent proxy for ocean (paleo) productivity. However, correlating barite to productivity involves some caveats. Specifically, the post-depositional formation of barite in oxic sediments can lead to Ba release into porewaters under anoxic conditions, which can form barite again under oxic conditions. This diagenetic formation is not correlated to export production as the seawater authigenic barite formed with decaying organic matter in the water column. Therefore, the main goal of this work is to briefly review the marine Ba cycle and highlight its importance for (paleo) productivity research...|$|R
40|$|<b>Marine</b> plastic <b>debris</b> {{are found}} {{worldwide}} in oceans and coastal areas. They degrade only slowly and contain chemicals added during manufacture or absorbed from the seawater. Therefore, they can pose a long-lasting contaminant source and potentially transfer chemicals to marine organisms when ingested. In {{order to assess}} their risk, the contaminant concentration in the plastics needs to be estimated and differences understood. We collected from literature plastic water partition coefficients of various organic chemicals for seven plastic types: polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), high-density, low-density and ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (LDPE, HDPE, UHMWPE), polystyrene (PS), polypropylene (PP), and polyvinyl chloride (PVC). Most data was available for PDMS (1060) and LDPE (220), but much less for the remaining plastics (73). Where possible, regression models were developed and the partitioning was compared between the different plastic types. The partitioning of chemicals follows the order of LDPE approximate to HDPE approximate to PP > PVC approximate to PS. Data describing the impact of weathering are urgently needed.
