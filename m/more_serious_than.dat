5|$|In Liao custom betrothal {{was seen}} as being equally serious to, if not <b>more</b> <b>serious</b> <b>than,</b> {{marriage}} itself, and was difficult to annul. The groom would pledge to work for three years for the bride's family, pay a bride price, and lavish the bride's family with gifts. After the three years, the groom {{would be allowed to}} take the bride back to his home, and the bride would usually cut off all ties with her family.|$|E
5|$|As regards proportionality, the law {{states that}} a self-defense {{may not be}} manifestly disproportionate. It is evident, that for a self-defense to be successful, {{it has to be}} {{performed}} on a level exceeding the attack. Unlike in case of necessity, the consequence of necessary self-defense may be <b>more</b> <b>serious</b> <b>than</b> consequence of the attack. The defense may not be restricted to a passive one, it can also be active. It is not the outcome of the incident but the sequence of actions at its beginning which determines who is to be deemed the attacker, and who is the party attacked.|$|E
5|$|During {{his final}} months in office, Patton drew {{criticism}} for abusing his patronage power. Critics charged {{that he had}} appointed several {{of his family and}} friends who were in non-merit system jobs to merit system positions, increasing their chances of being retained when a new administration took over. These charges were particularly damaging because, earlier in the year, the General Assembly had ordered Patton to cut 800 non-merit positions to help balance the budget. The Lexington Herald-Leader opined that these charges were <b>more</b> <b>serious</b> <b>than</b> those of the Conner affair. Patton maintained that his friends had followed proper personnel protocol in applying for and securing merit positions.|$|E

5|$|Historian Keith W. Olson {{has written}} that Nixon left a {{negative}} legacy: fundamental mistrust of government with its roots in Vietnam and Watergate. During the impeachment of Bill Clinton in 1998, both sides tried to use Nixon and Watergate to their advantage: Republicans suggested that Clinton's misconduct had been comparable to Nixon's, while Democrats contended that Nixon's actions had been far <b>more</b> <b>serious</b> <b>than</b> those of the incumbent. Another legacy, for a time, was {{a decrease in the}} power of the presidency as Congress passed restrictive legislation in the wake of Watergate. Olson suggests that grants of power to George W. Bush in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks restored the president's power.|$|E
5|$|Oil tankers {{are only}} one source of oil spills. According to the United States Coast Guard, 35.7% {{of the volume of}} oil spilled in the United States from 1991 to 2004 came from tank vessels (ships/barges), 27.6% from {{facilities}} and other non-vessels, 19.9% from non-tank vessels, and 9.3% from pipelines; 7.4% from mystery spills. Only 5% of the actual spills came from oil tankers, while 51.8% came from other kinds of vessels. The detailed statistics for 2004 shown in the table below show tank vessels responsible for somewhat less than 5% of the number of total spills but more than 60% of the volume. Tanker spills are much more rare and much <b>more</b> <b>serious</b> <b>than</b> spills from non-tank vessels.|$|E
5|$|Diaby {{began the}} 2008–09 season {{late in the}} season after the thigh injury from the {{previous}} season was discovered to be <b>more</b> <b>serious</b> <b>than</b> first thought. He made his debut in the season on 18 October 2008 in a 3–1 win over Everton. Three days later, Diaby scored the third goal in a 5–2 Champions League group stage win over Fenerbahçe. He appeared regularly in the campaign {{for the first time in}} his Arsenal career. On 26 December 2008, Diaby scored his third career goal against Aston Villa in a 2–2 draw. The following month, he assisted on the equalising goal, scored by Robin van Persie, in the team's 1–1 draw with Everton. Diaby scored his second goal of the campaign in Arsenal's 3–1 league win against Newcastle on 21 March. He finished the season by scoring the team's third goal in the 4–1 win over Stoke City.|$|E

5|$|Furious {{joined the}} Home Fleet {{off the coast}} of Norway on 10 April 1940 and her Swordfish made several attacks on German ships in Narvik on the {{following}} days. She refuelled at Tromsø on the 14th and remained behind after the bulk of the Home Fleet departed on 15 April, her aircraft flying reconnaissance missions until ordered home on 25 April. Her port inner turbine had been damaged by the shock wave from a near miss on 18 April, and the damage was <b>more</b> <b>serious</b> <b>than</b> initially thought. After quick repairs, Furious returned on 18 May carrying the Gladiators of a reformed 263 Squadron; they were flown off on 21 May once their base at Bardufoss was ready. She sailed to Scapa Flow once all the Gladiators had been flown off.|$|E
5|$|Mulyo Hadi Purnomo, {{based in}} Semarang, was tasked with casting the minor roles. Bramantyo {{contacted}} the main cast members directly. Agus Kuncoro, who had acted in Sang Pencerah and {{was known for}} playing in Islamic-themed films, agreed to play Surya in ? immediately after reading the script. Singer Glenn Fredly was interested in playing Doni because he considered the character, an ultra-conservative Catholic, an interesting role, given the sensitive religious situation in the country. Revalina S. Temat, who had appeared in Bramantyo's 2009 film Perempuan Berkalung Sorban (The Girl With the Keffiyeh Around Her Neck), found her role as Menuk interesting and <b>more</b> <b>serious</b> <b>than</b> her recent work in horror films. Endhita, whom Bramantyo called for the role, expressed interest {{as soon as she}} received an outline of the plot.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, back at Parkside {{the other}} seven trains {{had come to a}} halt {{following}} the accident. The electrical telegraph had not yet been invented and no signalling system was in place advanced enough to communicate with Northumbrian, with Liverpool and Manchester, or with the party who had accompanied Huskisson to Eccles. The remaining passengers and railway staff congregated near the accident site to discuss how best to proceed. The L staff argued that since the railway was not at fault for the accident they should be allowed to continue to Manchester to prove the viability of the design. They also made the point that a large crowd would by now have gathered in Manchester, waiting to see the arrival of the trains and {{to get a glimpse of}} the Duke of Wellington. Joseph Sandars also suggested that, did the group not continue, the Manchester crowd would hear rumours of the accident and believe it to be <b>more</b> <b>serious</b> <b>than</b> it was. The Prime Minister and Sir Robert Peel, the Home Secretary, felt that it would be disrespectful to Huskisson to continue, and advocated that the group return to Liverpool to await news of Huskisson's condition.|$|E

25|$|Sinning is the {{opposite}} of following Jesus, robbing people of their resemblance to God while turning their souls away from God's love. People can sin by failing to obey the Ten Commandments, failing to love God, and failing to love other people.

25|$|There {{are some}} {{varieties}} of mold that contain toxic compounds (mycotoxins). However, exposure to hazardous levels of mycotoxin via inhalation {{is not possible}} in most cases, as toxins are produced by the fungal body and are not at significant levels in the released spores. The primary hazard of mold growth, {{as it relates to}} indoor air quality, comes from the allergenic properties of the spore cell wall. <b>More</b> <b>serious</b> <b>than</b> most allergenic properties is the ability of mold to trigger episodes in persons that already have asthma, a serious respiratory disease.|$|E
