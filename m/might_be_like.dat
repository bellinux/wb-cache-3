Its almost featureless disc gave no hint what its surface <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>like,</b> {{and it was}} only with the development of spectroscopic, radar and ultraviolet observations that more of its secrets were revealed. The first ultraviolet observations were carried out in the 1920s, when Frank E. Ross found that ultraviolet photographs revealed considerable detail that was absent in visible and infrared radiation. He suggested this was due to a dense, yellow lower atmosphere with high cirrus clouds above it.|$|E

Horizons closed permanently in 1999 after a few years of sporadic operation; construction began on Mission: Space shortly thereafter. Industry estimates put the cost of developing the new attraction at US$100 million. The pavilion, like others at Epcot, features a VIP lounge for HP employees called The Red Planet Room.|$|E

25|$|In 1895 Wells was an {{established}} writer and he married his second wife, Catherine Robbins, moving {{with her to}} the town of Woking in Surrey. Here he spent his mornings walking or cycling in the surrounding countryside, and his afternoons writing. The original idea for The War of the Worlds came from his brother during one of these walks, pondering on what it <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> if alien beings were suddenly to descend on the scene and start attacking its inhabitants.|$|E
25|$|Edward Fredkin and Konrad Zuse {{pioneered the}} idea of a computable universe, the former by writing a line in his book on how the world <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> a {{cellular}} automaton, and later further developed by Fredkin using a toy model called Salt. It has been claimed that NKS tries to take these ideas as its own but Wolfram's model of the universe if a rewriting network and not a cellular automaton as Wolfram himself has suggested a cellular automaton cannot account for relativistic features such as no absolute time frame. Jürgen Schmidhuber has also charged that his work on Turing machine-computable physics was stolen without attribution, namely his idea on enumerating possible Turing-computable universes.|$|E

Matthew Alexander of Mania praised the artwork, noting that characters were [...] "cute and sexy {{with a wide}} variety of clothing that does a good job expressing the character's personality" [...] and that, overall, the artwork was [...] "very clean with attractive characters and well-detailed backgrounds". In his review of the second volume, Alexander wrote that [...] "so far, the story continues to be a fun examination of what life <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> from the cat's point of view, but I don't know how the whole Wild Cat storyline is going to be wrapped up in only one more volume". In his review of the third volume, Alexander felt that [...] "the story probably received an early ending", but concluded that [...] "despite the series only being three volumes, it really is a worthy read and quite funny if you've ever owned a cat".|$|E

500|$|Thief: The Dark Project {{has been}} {{declared}} {{one of the greatest}} games of all time by several publications. Inducting it into its hall of fame, GameSpy writer Rich Carlson wrote: [...] "With a tactical philosophy contrary to nearly every [...] action game at that time, Thief rewarded stealth and sneaking over brazen frontal assault," [...] continuing: [...] "While inadvertently undermining the notion that all action games need be shooters, it carved a completely new niche in the same already glutted genre." [...] GameSpot editor Greg Kasavin argued that, while Metal Gear Solid, [...] and Thief all defined the stealth action genre, it was Thief that displayed [...] "the purest depiction of what it <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> to slip from shadow to shadow" [...] and [...] "largely remains an unsurpassed achievement in gaming." [...] In 2009, Thief was added to IGN's hall of fame. Sid Shuman, writing for GamePro, asserted that Thief [...] "pioneered its own genre ... the stealth-action title." [...] John Walker of Eurogamer wrote in a retrospective review: [...] "Thief is an embarrassment to modern stealth games, each of which produces only a faded parody of this masterful original." [...] In 2012, Mike Fahey of Kotaku called Thief [...] "the best stealth game I've ever played", superior to modern games in the genre. That same year, Time named it one of the 100 greatest video games of all time.|$|E
500|$|Two {{young female}} millworkers in 1873 Maine visit the town's {{carousel}} after work. One of them, Julie Jordan, attracts {{the attention of}} the barker, Billy Bigelow ("The Carousel Waltz"). [...] When Julie lets Billy {{put his arm around her}} during the ride, Mrs. Mullin, the widowed owner of the carousel, tells Julie never to return. Julie and her friend, Carrie Pipperidge, argue with Mrs. Mullin. [...] Billy arrives and, seeing that Mrs. Mullin is jealous, mocks her; he is fired from his job. Billy, unconcerned, invites Julie to join him for a drink. As he goes to get his belongings, Carrie presses Julie about her feelings toward him, but Julie is evasive ("You're a Queer One, Julie Jordan"). Carrie has a beau too, fisherman Enoch Snow ("(When I Marry) Mister Snow"), to whom she is newly engaged. [...] Billy returns for Julie as the departing Carrie warns that staying out late means the loss of Julie's job. Mr. Bascombe, owner of the mill, happens by along with a policeman, and offers to escort Julie to her home, but she refuses and is fired. Left alone, she and Billy talk about what life <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> if they were in love, but neither quite confesses to the growing attraction they feel for each other ("If I Loved You").|$|E
500|$|Robert C. Cooper {{intended}} the episode as [...] "an emotional {{tribute to the}} ten seasons that [...] come before" [...] and [...] "the last chapter in the book – but not necessarily in the series of books. It was a chance , using science fiction, to show people one version of what the future <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> for these characters that they've {{spent so much time}} with and loved so much." [...] By killing off the Asgard race, Cooper gave the episode an element of tragedy that reflected his feelings at the time. Producer Brad Wright wanted all of the characters to get a last shot in the spotlight instead of focusing on only one character. Because of fan vocality about team episodes, Cooper decided to put the characters through several decades of life and see their relationships develop and evolve. The references in [...] "Unending" [...] to the events of season 2's [...] "The Fifth Race", another Cooper-penned episode often named as a fan favorite, were intended, as were the callbacks to season 9's [...] "The Ties That Bind" [...] (the Daniel-Vala argument, see below) and season 10's [...] "Line In The Sand" [...] (the solution of using the Ori beam). The period aboard the ship was originally significantly less than fifty years, but the actors' last-stage makeup, which Cooper only saw minutes before filming, looked so old that Cooper was forced {{to increase the number of}} years in the script.|$|E

He would still be glad of the fact, even if the Americans and British won the war. Naturally, when I am with Nazis, I find they are not my idea of what a Nazi is, but this wasn't meant to be a political tract. It was meant to stand for {{the fact that there was}} something tragic in the fate of a real Nazi. Except that I wonder if a real Nazi ever existed. At least, when I went to Germany, I never met one.
