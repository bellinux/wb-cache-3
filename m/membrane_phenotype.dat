40|$|The {{adenosine}} deaminase inhibitor deoxycoformycin {{was used in}} low doses to treat 19 patients with clinically aggressive T cell malignancy with a mature <b>membrane</b> <b>phenotype.</b> The patients comprised eight with prolymphocytic leukaemia, two with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, four with adult T cell leukaemia-lymphoma, three with Sézary syndrome, and two with T cell lymphoma. Two thirds of the patients had been resistant or minimally responsive to combination chemotherapy. Complete remission was obtained in five patients (two with prolymphocytic leukaemia and one each with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, adult T cell leukaemia-lymphoma, and Sézary syndrome) and partial remission in two others. Unmaintained complete remission lasting {{more than one year}} was seen in three patients. Responses were obtained only in patients with CD 4 +,CD 8 -membrane markers (seven out of 10), and no responses were recorded in any of the nine patients with a different phenotype. In this series remission appeared to correlate with the <b>membrane</b> <b>phenotype</b> of the neoplastic cell and not with the cytopathological diagnosis. Future studies should establish the biochemical basis for the greater sensitivity of CD 4 + lymphoid cells to deoxycoformycin...|$|E

Additional suppressors of OmpR(V 203 Q) were isolated by random mutagenesis.

These envZ 11 -like mutations mapped to a region different from those previously reported and were incapable of suppressing the ompR(V 203 M) allele.

40|$|Regulated {{membrane}} fusion {{is fundamental}} to cell physiology and function, including vesicle-mediated transport through the secretory pathway and the post-mitotic reassembly of Golgi, ER and nuclear membranes. Morphogenesis of the Drosophila compound eye photoreceptor is a sensitive assay of membrane fusion pathways. Starting with a mutation impacting photoreceptor morphogenesis, I identify here a Drosophila gene, eyes closed (eyc), as a fly homolog of p 47, a co-factor of p 97 AAA ATPase that {{has been found to}} be involved in membrane fusion. Loss of Eyc function results in a lethal failure of nuclear envelope assembly in early zygotic divisions.

40|$|We {{report the}} {{nucleotide}} {{sequence of the}} rpoN gene from broad-host-range Rhizobium sp. strain NGR 234 and analyze the encoded RPON protein, a sigma factor. Comparative analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence of RPON from NGR 234 with sequences from other gram-negative bacteria identified a perfectly conserved RPON box unique to RPON sigma factors. Symbiotic regulatory phenotypes were defined for a site-directed internal deletion within the coding sequence of the rpoN gene of Rhizobium strain NGR 234 : they included quantitative nodulation kinetics on Vigna unguiculata and microscopic analysis of the Fix- determinate nodules of V. unguiculata and Macroptilium atropurpureum. RPON was a primary coregulator of nodulation and was implicated in establishment or maintenance of the plant-synthesized peribacteroid <b>membrane.</b> <b>Phenotypes</b> of rpoN in Rhizobium strain NGR 234 could be grouped as symbiosis related, rather than simply pleiotropically physiological as in free-living bacteria such as Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas putida...|$|R
40|$|Phosphoinositides {{regulate}} myriad cellular processes, {{acting as}} potent signaling molecules in conserved signaling pathways and as organelle gatekeepers that recruit effector proteins to membranes. Phosphoinositide-generating enzymes {{have been studied}} extensively in yeast and cultured cells, yet their roles in animal development are not well understood. Here, we analyze Drosophila melanogaster phosphatidylinositol 4 -kinase IIIalpha (PI 4 KIIIalpha) during oogenesis. We demonstrate that PI 4 KIIIalpha is required for production of plasma membrane PtdIns 4 P and PtdIns(4, 5) P 2 and is crucial for actin organization, membrane trafficking and cell polarity. Female germ cells mutant for PI 4 KIIIalpha exhibit defects in cortical integrity associated with failure to recruit the cytoskeletal-membrane crosslinker Moesin and the exocyst subunit Sec 5. These effects reflect a unique requirement for PI 4 KIIIa, as egg chambers from flies mutant for either of the other Drosophila PI 4 Ks, fwd or PI 4 KII, show Golgi but not plasma <b>membrane</b> <b>phenotypes.</b> Thus, PI 4 KIIIalpha is a vital regulator of a functionally distinct pool of PtdIns 4 P that is essential for PtdIns(4, 5) P 2 -dependent processes in Drosophila development...|$|R

Eleven patients (10 men, one woman) corresponded histologically to intermediate (INT) or mantle zone lymphoma, and five, with less well defined features, were designated small lymphocytic lymphoma with cleaved cells. The blood films showed a pleomorphic picture with lymphoid cells of predominantly medium size with nuclear irregularities and clefts. The <b>membrane</b> <b>phenotype</b> of the circulating cells showed strong immunoglobulin staining and reactivity with CD 5 and FMC 7 in all cases tested; CD 10 was positive in six out of nine cases. The <b>membrane</b> <b>phenotype</b> of two of the five cases of small lymphocytic lymphoma was close to those of B-CLL and three resembled INT lymphoma. Bone marrow trephine biopsy specimens showed a diffuse pattern of infiltration in INT lymphoma. The median survival of these patients was less than two years, suggesting that a leukaemic presentation is associated with poor prognosis. By combining data from histology, membrane markers, and peripheral blood morphology, the leukaemic phase of typical INT lymphoma can be defined in most cases...|$|E
40|$|Herpesvirus saimiri has {{recently}} been shown to immortalize human T cells. It was unknown, however, whether Herpesvirus saimiri transformation affects T-cell receptor (TCR) expression and signal transduction. In the present study, we have transformed CD 4 + human T-cell clones specific for human myelin basic protein. The transformed T cells were grown in interleukin 2 and divided {{in the absence of}} antigen and antigen-presenting cells. They retained the <b>membrane</b> <b>phenotype</b> of activated T cells and secreted the cytokines interferon gamma and lymphotoxin, but interleukin 4 was not detected. Further, the transformed T cells continued to express the original TCR as demonstrated by TCR variable-region-V beta-specific monoclonal antibodies and TCR sequencing. Antigen-specific recognition and signal transduction by the TCR were demonstrated by myelin-basic-protein-induced HLA-DR-restricted secretion of interferon gamma and lymphotoxin and by myelin-basic-protein-specific proliferation. Antigen specificity and reactivity have been maintained for > 1 year after transformation. Transformation with Herpesvirus saimiri now allows the production of virtually unlimited numbers of (auto) antigen-specific T cells expressing functional TCR and a stable <b>membrane</b> <b>phenotype.</b> This technology will facilitate studies of the pathogenesis of putative autoimmune diseases, such as multiple sclerosis, and may be of help in TCR-targeted immunotherapy...|$|E

The Ts-DTH are hydrocortisone resistant, partially sensitive to X-irradiation and the <b>membrane</b> <b>phenotype</b> of Ts cells is Ly I+. Ts-DTH suppression is mediated through the production of soluble suppressor factor (SF-DTH). SF-DTH is non-dialysable but passes through 450 nm filter and does not sediment after centrifugation at 100, 000 g for 2 h; chromatography on Sephadex G- 100 indicates an approximate molecular weight of 12, 000...|$|E
40|$|The type II {{secretion}} (T 2 S) {{system of}} Vibrio cholerae is a multiprotein complex that spans the cell envelope and secretes proteins important for pathogenesis {{as well as}} survival in different environments. Here we report that, {{in addition to the}} loss of extracellular secretion, removal or inhibition of expression of the T 2 S genes, epsC-N, results in growth defects and a broad range of alterations in the outer membrane that interfere with its barrier function. Specifically, the sensitivity to membrane-perturbing agents such as bile salts and the antimicrobial peptide polymyxin B is increased, and periplasmic constituents leak out into the culture medium. As a consequence, the σE stress response is induced. Furthermore, due to the defects caused by inactivation of the T 2 S system, the Δeps deletion mutant of V. cholerae strain N 16961 is incapable of surviving the passage through the infant mouse gastrointestinal tract. The growth defect and leaky outer <b>membrane</b> <b>phenotypes</b> are suppressed when the culture medium is supplemented with 5 % glucose or sucrose, although the eps mutants remain sensitive to membrane-damaging agents. This suggests that the sugars do not restore the integrity of the outer membrane in the eps mutant strains per se but may provide osmoprotective functions...|$|R
40|$|Several cell types {{have been}} {{suggested}} as giving rise to chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), and these suggestions have reflected the sophistication of technology available at the time. Although {{there is no consensus}} as to the normal cellular counterpart(s) in the disease, an antigen-experienced B lymphocyte appears required based on surface <b>membrane</b> <b>phenotypes</b> and gene expression profiles. However, what is still unclear is whether a single or multiple normal precursors were stimulated to evolve into CLL and at what stage(s) this occurred. A unifying, parsimonious theory is that CLL clones with either mutated or unmutated IGHVs derive from marginal zone B cells. However, evidence for remarkably similar B-cell receptor amino acid sequence and striking differences in polyantigen and autoantigen-binding activity, found in some but not all CLL clones, challenge a single-cell derivation for CLL. In this Perspective, we summarize data regarding normal counterparts of CLL cells and suggest that a multistep process of leukemogenesis is important to consider when assigning a cellular origin for this disease. Finally, although available data do not definitively identify the cell(s) of origin, we offer possibilities for single- and multiple-cell origin models as straw men that can be improved on and hopefully lead to final answers to this puzzle...|$|R
40|$|The {{oxysterol}} binding protein homologue Kes 1 p {{has been}} implicated in nonvesicular sterol transport in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Kes 1 p also represses formation of protein transport vesicles from the trans-Golgi network (TGN) through an unknown mechanism. Here, we show that potential phospholipid translocases in the Drs 2 /Dnf family (type IV P-type ATPases [P 4 -ATPases]) are downstream targets of Kes 1 p repression. Disruption of KES 1 suppresses the cold-sensitive (cs) growth defect of drs 2 Δ, which correlates with an enhanced ability of Dnf P 4 -ATPases to functionally substitute for Drs 2 p. Loss of Kes 1 p also suppresses a drs 2 -ts allele in a strain deficient for Dnf P 4 -ATPases, suggesting that Kes 1 p antagonizes Drs 2 p activity in vivo. Indeed, Drs 2 -dependent phosphatidylserine translocase (flippase) activity is hyperactive in TGN membranes from kes 1 Δ cells and is potently attenuated by addition of recombinant Kes 1 p. Surprisingly, Drs 2 p also antagonizes Kes 1 p activity in vivo. Drs 2 p deficiency causes a markedly increased rate of cholesterol transport from the plasma membrane to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and redistribution of endogenous ergosterol to intracellular <b>membranes,</b> <b>phenotypes</b> that are Kes 1 p dependent. These data suggest a homeostatic feedback mechanism in which appropriately regulated flippase activity in the Golgi complex helps establish a plasma membrane phospholipid organization that resists sterol extraction by a sterol binding protein...|$|R
30|$|The ensuing {{inflammatory}} {{response of the}} intestinal mucosa has long been associated with Salmonella virulence (Valdez et al. 2009). It is known that OMPs {{have the potential to}} induce inflammatory reaction along with the release of cytokines (Chanana et al. 2005). In the present study also, the rFliC (an outer <b>membrane</b> <b>phenotype)</b> being the subunit of flagellar complex might have induced inflammation through the increased generation of pro-inflammatory mediators such as MDA and nitrite. Further, rFliC induced thermal hyperalgesia (flicking response) observed during inflammation {{may be due to the}} increased diacylglycerol levels. This in turn may activate protein kinase C (PKC) causing changes in pain perception (Pacher et al. 2007).|$|E
40|$|A {{study was}} {{performed}} on cell suspension from peripheral blood and bone marrow aspirates and on cryostat sections from bone marrow biopsies in order to investigate the <b>membrane</b> <b>phenotype</b> of neoplastic B cells in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (B-CLL).

The results demonstrate that neoplastic B lymphocytes in B-CLL display an identical phenotype in peripheral blood and bone marrow.

40|$|The {{results of}} this study show that during growth of the {{immunogenic}} Meth A fibrosarcoma, two different types of suppressor T lymphocytes are generated in sequence. One type is generated during early tumor growth, reaches peak number around day 6, and is progressively lost thereafter. It is defined by its ability, upon passive transfer, to suppress the expression of a DTH reaction to tumor antigens in tumor- immunized recipients. It bears the Ly 1 -, 2 + <b>membrane</b> <b>phenotype</b> and is sensitive to relatively low doses of cyclophosphamide. In contrast, the second type of suppressor cell is not detected until after day 9 of tumor growth, and is defined by its ability to inhibit, upon passive transfer, the expression of adoptive immunity against an established tumor in T cell-deficient recipients. According to previous studies it bears the Ly 1 +, 2 -, L 3 T 4 a+ <b>membrane</b> <b>phenotype</b> and is less sensitive to cyclophosphamide than the T cell suppressor of DTH. It is argued that this second type of suppressor T cell seems likely to be responsible for the escape of immunogenic tumors from antitumor immunity, because it can suppress the expression of a powerful mechanism of antitumor immunity in recipient mice, and is generated progressively as the tumor- bearing host loses concomitant immunity. In contrast, although the Ly- 1 -, 2 + T cell suppressors of DTH can efficiently suppress a DTH reaction to an implant of living tumor cells, they fail to suppress the expression of immunity to the same implant...|$|E
40|$|Purified {{peripheral}} blood lymphocytes (PBL) from nine untreated patients with Hodgkin's disease (HD), two HD patients in complete remission and 17 healthy donors were studied for natural killer (NK) cell activity against the K- 562 cell line using a single cell cytotoxic assay, which allowed enumeration of effector cells and characterization of their surface <b>membrane</b> <b>phenotypes</b> after staining with monoclonal antibodies. The frequency of NK cells {{was significantly lower}} in HD patients than in controls (mean % +/- s. d., 1. 9 +/- 0. 9 and 2. 8 +/- 1. 2, respectively), while the fraction of target binding cells was similar in the two groups. The fraction of cytotoxic lymphocytes increased after pre-treatment of PBL with 500 iu leucocyte interferon in all tested control donors (n = 12) and the two patients in remission but only in four of seven untreated patients. No relation between the impaired NK cell frequency and age, tumour histology and clinical stage could be revealed. Subtyping of the target cell binding NK cells by monoclonal antibodies disclosed a marked heterogeneity of effector cells. NK effector cells reactive with M 1 and anti-Ia antibodies were enriched while T 3 + and T 4 + NK lymphocytes tended to be reduced as compared to PBL. There {{was no difference between}} patients and healthy donors with regard to the surface antigen patterns of NK cells. Interferon treatment did not alter significantly the phenotypic characteristics of cytotoxic lymphocytes in patients and controls. It is concluded that the impairment of NK cell activity in HD is partly attributed to a lower frequency of cytotoxic effector cells among a normal number of target binding cells. The defect could not be attributed to a selective defect of effector cell subsets...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} {{the results of}} treatment with 2 '-deoxycoformycin (DCF) in 68 patients with post-thymic (mature) T-cell malignancies. These included: prolymphocytic leukaemia (T-PLL), 31, HTLV- 1 + adult T-cell leukaemia/lymphoma (ATLL), 20, cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL), comprising mycosis fungoides and Sezary syndrome, 13, and large granular lymphocytic leukaemia, four. Two-thirds of patients were refractory to previous therapy, which included four drug combinations. DCF was given intravenously at 4 mg m- 2 weekly for the first 4 weeks and then every 2 weeks until maximal response. Toxicity was very low with only one death resulting from prolonged neutropenia. Overall response rates, partial (PR) and complete. (CR), were 38 %, with variations according to diagnosis. Best responses, 54 %, were seen in CTCL but limited to Sezary patients, one CR, six PR, whilst none of the mycosis fungoides responded. Responses in T-PLL were recorded in 48 % including three CR (of 8 - 12 months' duration unmaintained) and 12 PR. Fifteen per cent of responses were seen in ATLL. The only ATLL responders - two CR, one PR - were those patients who received combination chemotherapy prior to DCF, with reduction of tumour bulk but short of PR. When results were analysed according to <b>membrane</b> <b>phenotypes</b> {{it was apparent that}} responses were seen mainly in cases with CD 4 +, CD 8 - T cells - 22 of 47 (47 %) - contrasting with only three of 19 (16 %) with other T-cell phenotypes. We conclude that DCF is a useful therapy for the treatment of T-cell leukaemias, in particular Sezary syndrome and T-PLL, and should play a part in strategies to improve the natural history of this group of lymphoid malignancies...|$|R

Here, we show that in Swiss 3 T 3 cells with 4 N DNA content, high levels of Mos lead {{to the production of}} binucleated cells. The Swiss 3 T 3 cells in mitosis, before binucleation occurs, are anastral and the spindle poles are juxtaposed to the cell <b>membrane.</b> These <b>phenotypes</b> {{may be related to the}} meiotic process of attachment of the spindle pole to the oocyte membrane during polar body formation.

40|$|The high {{incidence}} of arrhythmias in compensated cardiac hypertrophy is related to two independently regulated components—fibro-sis and the adaptational phenotypic changes in membrane proteins linked to cardiac hypertrophy, and fibrosis. During the regression of hypertensive cardiopathy in middle-aged spontaneously hypertensive rats, the roles of cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis can be analysed separately, revealing that both correlate independently with arrhythmias. In an experimental model of myocardial infarction {{it is possible to}} prevent arrhythmias with propranolol {{at the same time as}} cardiac hypertrophy, despite ventricular fibrosis. Fibrosis would appear to create arrhythmias both by anatomical uncoupling and by a re-entry mechanism generated by the zig-zag propagation of the transverse waveform.

40|$|The gene locus {{known as}} mtr confers {{resistance}} to hydrophobic dyes, detergents, and antibiotics. It {{has been suggested}} previously that the host environment {{is important in the}} selection of gonococcal strains with this outer <b>membrane</b> <b>phenotype,</b> and thus that strains with mtr gene loci should predominate in environments high in hydrophobic molecules. Furthermore, resistance to hydrophobic molecules has been related to a sevenfold increase in a minor outer membrane protein. To test these suggestions the outer membrane phenotypes of 61 strains of Neisseria gonorrhoeae were identified using 27 rectal isolates from homosexual men and 34 urethral isolates from heterosexual men who were matched for age. The cell envelope phenotype of each strain was identified on the basis of resistance to various hydrophobic compounds.

All cell lines expressed the CD 4 <b>membrane</b> <b>phenotype,</b> and their antigen reactivity was blocked by antibodies against monomorphic HLA DR/DP determinants. Using a panel of fusion proteins of different, overlapping mouse AChR alpha-chain sequences, a major T cell epitope was localized between amino acid positions 85 and 142. This determinant was distinct from the humoral main immunogenic region, which has been identified on the sequence 61 - 76. The response pattern of uncloned T lines from three patients with different HLA haplotypes suggests, however, that in any one MG patient T lymphocytes may recognize more than one autoantigenic epitope on the AChR alpha-chain, and that the T lymphocyte response profiles vary among individual patients...|$|E
40|$|Adenoid cystic {{carcinoma}} (ACC) is {{a frequent}} malignant salivary gland neoplasm presenting different growth patterns described as tubular, cribriform and solid, which represent distinct differentiation stages. Cell lines originated from ACCs grown inside three-dimensional environments have not been capable to reproduce all in vivo ACC growth patterns. As ACC cells in vivo present replicated basement membrane, to mimic this situation in vitro ACC cells (CAC 2 cells) were grown {{on the top of}} a reconstituted basement <b>membrane</b> (Matrigel). <b>Phenotype</b> differences were assessed by light, fluorescence and transmission electron microscopy. The cultures grown on the top of Matrigel presented three-dimensional arrangement of cells intercepted by cellular cords. At these, cell nests pseudocyst formations were observed.

We now report that mice lacking all three APP/APLP family members survive through embryonic development, and die shortly after birth. In contrast to double-mutant animals with perinatal lethality, 81 % of triple mutants showed cranial abnormalities.

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation and ubiquitination, may play important regulatory roles in this highly processive and ordered process. However, while ubiquitination {{plays an important}} role in cargo selection, functions for ubiquitination of the endocytic machinery are not known. We identified the deubiquitinase (DUB) Ubp 7 p as a late arriving endocytic protein. Deletion of the DUBs Ubp 2 p and Ubp 7 p resulted in elongation of the lifetimes of endocytic coat proteins at the plasma membrane and recruitment of endocytic proteins to internal <b>membranes.</b> These <b>phenotypes</b> could be replicated by expressing a permanently ubiquitinated version of the early endocytic adaptor Ede 1 p, the yeast Eps 15 homolog, which is implicated in the initiation of endocytic sites.

On blood samples drawn from four astronauts before and after a 12 - 15 days space-flight, we analysed a panel of hematological parameters and some phenotypic features of age-related RBC subsets, which can be linked to a neocytolytic process. After the space-flight, changes in plasma ferritin levels and in reticulocyte number indicated that a neocytolytic process likely occurred in flight. Furthermore the percentage and the viability of early generated RBC was decreased and on the outer membrane layer a small number of those left over exposed phosphatydilserine (PS), a phospholipid able to trigger macrophage ingestion. A decreased expression of the membrane molecules CD 55, which protects red cells from complement mediated lysis and CD 47, which inhibits macrophage phagocytosis, was also observed in young erythrocytes.

40|$|CD 30 is {{a member}} of the TNF {{receptor}} superfamily that is commonly used as a marker for Hodgkin and Reed-Sternberg cells in Hodgkin's disease. More recently, it has been proposed that CD 30 is preferentially up-regulated on Th 2 -type human T cells. We analyzed regulation of CD 30 expression on both peripheral blood T cells and T cell clones. In short-term culture, CD 30 expression could be induced on T cells by Ags that elicit Th 2 -type responses (Schistosoma haematobium, adult worm Ag, and Toxocaria canis, excretory/secretory Ag) and Th 0 -type responses (tetanus toxoid), as well as Th 1 -type responses (tuberculin purified protein derivative). Moreover, simultaneous measurement of <b>membrane</b> <b>phenotype</b> and cytokine production showed that CD 30 -expressing cells can produce IFN-gamma. Finally, within panels of randomly generated as well as Ag-specific T cell clones, CD 30 expression was found on Th 0 -, Th 2 -, and Th 1 -type clones. We conclude that induction of CD 30 on activated T cells is not related to differentiation in Th 0 -, Th 1 -, or Th 2 -type cell...|$|E

40|$|Haemophilus ducreyi is an obligate human {{pathogen}} and the causative {{agent of the}} sexually transmitted, genital ulcerative disease chancroid. The genome of strain 35000 HP contains two known porin proteins, OmpP 2 A and OmpP 2 B. Loss of OmpP 2 A and OmpP 2 B expression in the mutant 35000 HP::P 2 AB resulted in no obvious growth defect or phenotype. Comparison of outer membrane profiles indicated increased expression of the 58. 5 -kDa chaperone, GroEL, in the porin-deficient mutant. A proteomics-based comparison resulted {{in the identification of}} 231 proteins present in membrane-associated protein samples, of which a subset of 56 proteins was differentially expressed at a level of 1. 5 -fold or greater in the porin-deficient strain 35000 HP::P 2 AB relative to that in 35000 HP. Twenty of the differentially expressed proteins were selected for real-time PCR, resulting in the validation of 90 % of the selected subgroup. Proteins identified in these studies suggested a decreased <b>membrane</b> stability <b>phenotype,</b> which was verified by disk diffusion assay. Loss of OmpP 2 A and OmpP 2 B resulted in global protein expression changes which appear to compensate for the absence of porin expression in 35000 HP::P 2 AB...|$|R

40|$|SummaryBackgroundClathrin-mediated {{endocytosis}} in {{budding yeast}} requires the regulated recruitment and disassociation {{of more than}} 60 proteins at discrete plasma membrane punctae. Posttranslational modifications such as ubiquitination may play important regulatory roles in this highly processive and ordered process. However, although ubiquitination {{plays an important role}} in cargo selection, functions for ubiquitination of the endocytic machinery are not known. ResultsWe identified the deubiquitinase (DUB) Ubp 7 as a late-arriving endocytic protein. Deletion of the DUBs Ubp 2 and Ubp 7 resulted in elongation of endocytic coat protein lifetimes at the plasma membrane and recruitment of endocytic proteins to internal <b>membranes.</b> These <b>phenotypes</b> could be replicated by expressing a permanently ubiquitinated version of Ede 1, the yeast Eps 15 homolog, which is implicated in endocytic site initiation, whereas EDE 1 deletion partially suppressed the DUB deletion phenotype. Both DUBs are capable of deubiquitinating Ede 1 in vitro. ConclusionsDeubiquitination regulates formation of endocytic sites and stability of the endocytic coat. This regulation appears to occur through Ede 1, because permanently ubiquitinated Ede 1 phenocopies deletion of UBP 2 and UBP 7. Moreover, incomplete suppression of the ubp 2 Δ ubp 7 Δ phenotype by ede 1 Δ indicates that ubiquitination and deubiquitination are likely to regulate additional components of the endocytic machinery...|$|R
