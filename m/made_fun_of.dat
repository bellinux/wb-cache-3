5|$|After {{returning}} from World War II, Hassett operated a sports store in Melbourne; {{one of his}} staff members was Victorian Test teammate Neil Harvey. After retiring from cricket, Hassett joined the Australian Broadcasting Commission as a radio commentator in 1956, remaining in that position until 1981. During {{his time in the}} commentary booth, he was known for his self-deprecating humour and frequently <b>made</b> <b>fun</b> <b>of</b> his conservative approach to batting during the latter half of his career. Hassett was known for his disapproval of some of the aspects of the modern evolution of cricket, particularly the more aggressive player conduct that contrasted with the more sedate and gentlemanly style of his era.|$|E
5|$|Made in Berlin in the 1930s, the Columbus Globe for State and Industry Leaders {{was located}} in Hitler's office {{throughout}} most of its existence. It became widely known in the United States after comedian Charlie Chaplin parodied it in his 1940 film The Great Dictator. Comedy group The Three Stooges also <b>made</b> <b>fun</b> <b>of</b> it in two of their short subject comedies. One of the two limited editions was looted by John Barsamia, a private in the U.S. Army, at Hitler's summer retreat shortly {{after the war and}} sold 60 years later at an auction in San Francisco for $100,000. The globe in Hitler's office replaced Ethiopia with Italian East Africa and was known for its size as well as manufacturing cost.|$|E

60|$|Of course, {{the other}} lads <b>made</b> great <b>fun</b> <b>of</b> the whole thing, and plagued Dr. Alec's {{students}} {{half out of}} their lives. But they kept on persistently, and one day something happened which made the other fellows behave themselves for ever after.|$|R
5000|$|Kemp {{was born}} in Maastricht and died there in 1967. In Limburg, the county where he was born, people <b>made</b> <b>fun</b> out <b>of</b> his surname; in several dialects of Dutch and the {{regional}} Limburgian language, 'kemp' (as 'kennep' and general Dutch 'hennep') is the colloquial term for marijuana.|$|R
5|$|The FBI arrives to take Marvin back to Ethiopia, but Marvin tricks {{them into}} taking Cartman instead. Cartman, who had {{previously}} cared little for the impoverished in Africa, is unable to bear the lack of food and poor living conditions there; furthermore, he attempts to convince the Red Cross there that he's {{not one of the}} Africans, but it fails. While praying to God in Addis Ababa, Cartman says he is sorry he <b>made</b> <b>fun</b> <b>of</b> poor people. He eventually finds a Red Cross shack, where Sally Struthers is hoarding all the food meant for charity. After a brief argument, Cartman exposes all of Miss Struthers's hoarding of the food supply to the Ethiopians, who then take control of the food supply.|$|E
5|$|Rickey was a {{conservative}} teetotaler, while O'Malley freely enjoyed vices such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco. As O'Malley became {{more involved in}} affairs, he became critical of Rickey, the highest-paid individual in baseball, counting salary, attendance bonuses, and player contract sales commissions. O'Malley and Rickey had very different backgrounds and philosophies. It was O'Malley who put pressure on Rickey to fire manager Leo Durocher, who O'Malley felt was a drain on attendance. In board of directors meetings, O'Malley also opposed Rickey's extravagances. When he was with his political friends, he <b>made</b> <b>fun</b> <b>of</b> Rickey at every chance. Daily News columnist Jimmy Powers would deride Rickey for selling off players and for general miserliness. When Rickey asked O'Malley, the team lawyer, if he should sue, O'Malley said no. Powers' campaign became so public that after the 1946 season Rickey gave each player a new Studebaker, which gave O'Malley, a Dodgers shareholder, reason to speak ill of Rickey in the press. It {{got to the point}} where everything Rickey did was something O'Malley derided: O'Malley thought Rickey's construction of the state of the art Vero Beach spring training facility, known as Dodgertown, was extravagant; he thought Rickey's investment in the Brooklyn Dodgers of the All-America Football Conference was questionable; he fought Rickey on the team's beer sponsor; and he demanded that players return their 1947 World Series rings before receiving the new ones Rickey ordered. As team lawyer, O'Malley had a role in breaking the racial barrier as well. In particular, he had a significant role in Rickey's top-secret search for suitable ballplayers to break the color barrier and then later he had a role in assessing the ongoing legal risks to the franchise.Other accounts, however, suggest that he played a lesser role in Robinson's signing.|$|E

500|$|On its {{publication}} in 1954, {{the book was}} received with immediate acclaim, and has remained in print ever since. The Manchester Guardian called it [...] "fascinating…unusually readable"; Harold Nicolson in The Observer said, [...] "it will become a classic", though he <b>made</b> gentle <b>fun</b> <b>of</b> the combative Englishness of Hartley's culinary pronouncements.|$|R
5000|$|Although it {{aired on}} state-run television, the play {{came in for}} some {{criticism}} in the Parliament of India because it allegedly <b>made</b> disrespectful <b>fun</b> <b>of</b> Emperor Akbar, [...] "a great and respected leader of this nation of ancient times." [...] The play has received popular and critical acclaim since it first began to be staged.|$|R
50|$|The {{program was}} known for its wit and satire, but also, as both {{performers}} constantly admitted, a large degree of toilet humour. The use of such low-brow comedy was frequently mocked by the hosts themselves. They caused occasional controversy, such as when they <b>made</b> repeated <b>fun</b> <b>of</b> Mal Colston's son for shouting at the media camped outside Colston's family home.|$|R

60|$|Coote did, bowing very slightly, and Kipps secured his vacated {{position}} on the extensive black skin rug. He spread out his legs compass-fashion and tried to appear at his ease. The rug, the fender, the mantel and mirror conspired with great success {{to make him look}} a trivial and intrusive little creature amidst their commonplace hauteur, and his own shadow on the opposite wall seemed to think everything a great lark and mocked and <b>made</b> tremendous <b>fun</b> <b>of</b> him....|$|R
5000|$|Hobgoblins {{primarily}} {{received attention}} {{when it was}} later shown on Mystery Science Theater 3000. The episode, as usual, <b>made</b> unrelenting <b>fun</b> <b>of</b> the movie and of Sloane in particular, with Tom Servo attempting to use time travel to assault Sloane for making the film—only to give Sloane inspiration for making the movie—at the episode's conclusion. MST3K writer Paul Chaplin later commented on Hobgoblins, saying, [...] "It shoots right {{to the top of}} the list of the worst movies we've ever done." ...|$|R
25|$|Sublima (voiced by Charlie Adler)– Oblina's mother. Sublima {{comes from}} a rich family and {{strongly}} disapproves of Oblina scaring. She almost made her daughter quit school and come back home. Sublima even <b>made</b> <b>fun</b> <b>of</b> mold farmers (A hobby that Horvak now has.).|$|E

6000|$|... "When George {{came the}} next day he was just the same splendid old George, and I do not believe any one ever {{received}} a warmer welcome from a sister-in-law than I gave him.

60|$|Flamboyantly smoking cigars {{they sat}} in a box at the burlesque show, their {{feet up on the}} rail, while a chorus of twenty daubed, worried, and inextinguishably respectable grandams swung their legs in the more {{elementary}} chorus-evolutions, and a Jewish comedian <b>made</b> vicious <b>fun</b> <b>of</b> Jews. In the entr'actes they met other lone delegates. A dozen of them went in taxicabs out to Bright Blossom Inn, where the blossoms were made of dusty paper festooned along a room low and stinking, like a cow-stable no longer wisely used.|$|R
6000|$|The {{people are}} so earnest, they make me sad. But then, they are so didactic, they hold forth so much, they are so cock-sure and so narrow-eyed, they make me laugh. George laughs too. I am sure we <b>made</b> such <b>fun</b> <b>of</b> a straight-haired goggle of a girl who had {{suffered}} {{in prison for the}} cause of women, that I am ashamed when I see my [...] "Woman's League" [...] badge. At the bottom, you know, Cyril, I don't care for anything very much, except myself. Things seem so frivolous. I am the only real thing, I and the children——" ...|$|R

25|$|While he {{was still}} at school, Tucholsky had already written his first {{articles}} as a journalist. In 1907 the weekly satirical magazine Ulk ("Prank") published the short text Märchen ("Fairy Tale"), in which the 17-year-old Tucholsky <b>made</b> <b>fun</b> <b>of</b> Kaiser Wilhelm II's cultural tastes. At university he worked more intensively as a journalist, among other things working for the social democratic party organ Vorwärts ("onwards"). He involved himself in the SPD's election campaign in 1911.|$|E
25|$|In {{the ensuing}} war years, Balašević had serious {{problems}} {{with the government of}} Slobodan Milošević because he openly stated his opposition to it. At his concerts he often criticised and <b>made</b> <b>fun</b> <b>of</b> Milošević and other Serbian politicians. In 1996, he became the UNHCR Goodwill Ambassador for his antiwar statements during the Yugoslav wars and held the first postwar concert in Sarajevo as the first Serbian artist visiting war-torn Bosnia and Herzegovina.|$|E
5000|$|In recent years, the skits of {{the show}} have parodied and <b>made</b> <b>fun</b> mostly <b>of</b> campus life and stereotypes, have been less harsh, and have caused less controversy. The show is the {{signature}} event of Keenan Hall. Three shows are offered on consecutive Thursday, Friday, and Saturday in February. [...] The show is loved by the student body, and ticket distribution is an event in itself, always drawing large crowds, with tickets running out in minutes. With an attendance of over 4600 (1500 per show), {{it is the most}} attended hall event, {{and one of the most}} popular and beloved events at Notre Dame.|$|R
6000|$|... "Friedrich, in his conversation, {{showed a}} modesty which {{seemed a little}} affected. 'S'IL M'EST PERMIS D'AVOIR UNE OPINION,' a common {{expression}} of his;--said 'opinion' on most things, on Medicine among others, being always excellent. Thinks French Literature surpasses that of the Ancients. Small opinion of English Literature: turned Shakspeare into ridicule; and <b>made</b> also bitter <b>fun</b> <b>of</b> German Letters,--their Language barbarous, their Authors without genius....|$|R
6000|$|Chloe {{called me}} [...] "Tommy," [...] and <b>made</b> sisterly <b>fun</b> <b>of</b> my {{attempts}} to woo her. With Devoe she was vastly more reserved. He {{was the man}} of romance, one to stir her imagination and deepest feelings had her fancy leaned toward him. I was closer to her, but standing in no glamour; I had the task before me of winning her in what {{seems to me the}} American way of fighting--with cleanness and pluck and everyday devotion to break away the barriers of friendship that divided us, and to take her, if I could, between sunrise and dark, abetted by neither moonlight nor music nor foreign wiles.|$|R
25|$|After John Frederick death's, Prince-Bishop of Paderborn Ferdinand of Fürstenberg {{appointed}} him as Auxiliary Bishop of Münster (Church Saint Liudger) on 7 October 1680. The new prince-elector Ernest Augustus, Elector of Hanover was a Protestant. Earlier, Augustus' wife, Sophia of Hanover, had <b>made</b> <b>fun</b> <b>of</b> Steno's piousness; he had sold his bishop's ring and cross {{to help the}} needy. He continued zealously the work of counter reform begun by Bernhard von Galen.|$|E
25|$|Karolína Kurková {{was born}} in Děčín, Czechoslovakia, to Josef Kurka, a Czech {{basketball}} player, and a Slovak mother.

She later traveled to Milan to gain more experience and signed a modeling contract with Miuccia Prada.|$|E
25|$|Later {{that month}} (October 1968), Big Brother {{performed}} at the University of Massachusetts Amherst and at the Worcester Polytechnic Institute. During a November concert at the Guthrie Theater in Minneapolis, bassist Peter Albin <b>made</b> <b>fun</b> <b>of</b> Joplin {{in front of their}} audience, joking that when she panted after finishing a song she sounded like Lassie. Aside from two 1970 reunions, Joplin's last performance with Big Brother was at a Family Dog benefit in San Francisco on December 1, 1968.|$|E
60|$|When Dan used to {{come home}} from Harvard she put on a pretty cap for him, and {{distinguished}} him as company by certain laces hiding her wasted frame, and giving their pathetic coquetry to her transparent wrists. He was her favourite, and the girls acknowledged him so, and <b>made</b> their <b>fun</b> <b>of</b> her for spoiling him. He found out as he grew up that her broken health dated from his birth, and at first this deeply affected him; but his young life soon lost the keenness of the impression, and he loved his mother because she loved him, and not because she had been dying for him so many years.|$|R
60|$|Pan {{sat next}} this big black-eyed man, {{in the circle}} of hungry cowboys. They <b>made</b> no more <b>fun</b> <b>of</b> Pan. He was one of them.

But he had no trouble {{disposing}} of the juicy beefsteak and boiled potatoes and beans and hot biscuits that Tex, the boss, piled upon his plate.|$|R
50|$|Babla (Master Raju) is a kid {{who lives}} in a village with his mother (Dina Pathak). His mother sends him to his sister's (Vidya Sinha) place (in a city) so that he can go to a good school. Initially, Babla likes both school as well as his sister's home very much and becomes a good friend with Pappu (Master Tito), his classmate. They roam around in streets, watch street magic shows and wish they could do such tricks, look inquisitively at how sweets are <b>made,</b> make <b>fun</b> <b>of</b> teacher, etc. They enjoy all these things thoroughly. But Babla gets {{reminded}} of the harsh reality of life when his sister and brother-in-law start scolding him for his disinterest in studies and complaints from the school regarding his so-called irresponsible behavior (like making <b>fun</b> <b>of</b> teachers, singing in the classroom, etc.). He gets to realize that nobody understands kids, their innocence, their view of life and he will have to grow up to enjoy life fully.|$|R
