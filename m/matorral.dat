40|$|Radiotracking of two {{roe deer}} Capreolus capreolus (1 female, 1 male) in a Mediterranean habitat (<b>Matorrals)</b> with a {{detailed}} analysis of the vegetation showed that within their annual home range the deers selected particular habitat types, according to the season. The northern slope was preferred by both animals. Comparatively to female, male had a larger annual home range (150 ha vs. 130 ha), composed of more widely scattered sites of preferred use in more seasonal vs variable habitat types. Habitat selection in different seasons was affected by several factors: i) in all seasons, abundance of Rubus ulmifolius and Rosa ssp., ii) strong winds, especially in winter, that caused the male to move to southern slope, iii) disturbance by hunting dogs in autumn that forced deers into one or two refuge zones, iv) aspect of deer biology, such as territory marking by the male and giving birth by the female, which modified not only behaviour but also use of space...|$|R
40|$|Broom <b>matorrals</b> are {{subjected}} to extensive burning in the Pyrenees to improve grazing value, despite being a habitat of conservation interest in Europe. Our aim here is to evaluate the impact of such management practices over the long term, and of ﬁre severity over the short term, on avifauna. Bird-habitat stations were distributed in broom shrublands from {{a few months to}} 51 years after ﬁre, at 1400 – 2100 m a. s. l. Overall, shrub cover was the main habitat variable affecting the bird community composition. The abundance trends of bird species for half a century after ﬁre were varied, but population recovery seemed slower (especially in the Dartford warbler Sylvia undata) than it had been reported at a lower altitude. Three species of European conservation concern (Alauda arvensis, Lullula arborea and Lanius collurio) showed abundance peaks at 10 – 19 years after ﬁre. This time interval showed the highest species richness, abundance and conservation value, whereas shrub cover continued to increase afterwards. The bird assemblage tended to impoverish with increasing ﬁre severity in the ﬁrst year after a ﬁre. Our results emphasize: (1) the slow recovery of bird community of burnt mountain shrub- lands; (2) the need for long-term biodiversity assessments to help improve planning of ﬁre intervals at different altitudes; (3) the relevance of reducing ﬁre severity due to its impact on fauna.

40|$|National audienceIn {{the western}} part of Morocco, various studies deal with land use (LU) mapping and analysis. However, no {{quantitative}} or qualitative analysis has been focused on the interrelations between mass wasting (MW) and LU. This paper is centered on the mapping in the NW Morocco (Chefchaouen province) to define different LU classes and their consequences for slope stability. Seven classes of LU were mapped: dense forests, shrubs or <b>matorrals,</b> reforestation areas, farmlands, naked areas, urban zones and free water bodies. Four major types of MW occur within this region: landslides, rock falls, debris flows and undercutting. Badlands (BL) do not belong to MW but are characterized by successive thalweg and crests resulting from linear erosion, also responsible for the loss in farmlands. Therefore, their location and extension are analyzed. The analysis of the spatial distribution of MW according to LU classes demonstrated that high densities of MW and BL classes cover three main LU classes: farmlands include 45 % of MW and BL; dense forest's areas reach up to 24 % of the phenomena, commonly due to an important local clearance of vegetation; shrubs are concerned by 11 % of the MW only, in conformity with the discrete character of their plant cover. Landslides, river undermining and badlands are mostly triggered by farmlands. Debris flows and rock falls develop where steep rocks and resistant formations (limestone, sandstone, and quartzite) dominate, in association with marquetry of shrubs and islands of dense forests...|$|R

40|$|International audienceOf {{the many}} {{techniques}} tested to date to rehabilitate degraded ecosystems, topsoil transfer appears {{to offer the}} best results. However, this method is recent, and results achieved {{in the short term}} (months to years) may not provide a sound indication of long-term vegetation reestablishment. In the plain of La Crau in southeastern France, many dry alluvial quarries were exploited in the 1970 s- 1980 s and are nearly all now abandoned. Various topsoil transfers were performed when operations ceased, for various rehabilitation purposes (aesthetic, security, agricultural, etc.) and now provide the opportunity to test their efficacy in the 30 -year long-term. We used an ecological analysis of plant communities and soil carried out in 2015 to compare the reference ecosystem (the steppe of La Crau, positive control) with un-rehabilitated quarry pits (negative control) and with four different rehabilitation treatments: (1) soil transfer (40 cm) with no contact with the water table; (2) soil transfer (40 cm) in contact with the water table; (3) more than 40 cm of soil transfer and (4) anthropogenic material deposits (spoils) unrelated to the characteristics of the reference soil. Our results show that the treatment most favorable to restoration of the species richness, diversity and composition of the steppe vegetation is transferring soil with fine particles (clay, silt) (treatment 1), at least 40 cm thick and without contact with groundwater. However, even after thirty years, and the re-establishment of traditional sheep grazing, full restoration of the reference steppe is far from being achieved. The other treatments lead to the emergence of hybrid or novel ecosystems, such as temporary ponds, riparian woodlands or <b>matorrals</b> with new variables and common variables to the historical ecosystem. Additional techniques to enhance the effectiveness of topsoil transfer are discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

Anecdotal evidence has suggested that, during the rutting period, female roe deer may undertake short excursions, outside of their normal home range, possibly to mate with a reproductive partner. To address this question, we analysed the ranging behaviour of 27 female roe deer Capreolus capreolus, equipped with GPS collars, inhabiting a fragmented landscape in France. We compared female movements during the rutting period with a non-rutting period over two summers using a recently published approach. Search intensity and home range size were significantly greater during the rutting period. The difference in home range size between the two periods was significantly greater in 2006 compared to 2005 and in open compared to closed habitat. We were not able to identify any influence of body mass on the difference in ranging behaviour between the two periods. Visual analysis of movement trajectories for 11 females revealed that 5 (45 %) performed an excursion for a duration of a few hours to several days. We speculatively suggest that female rut excursions provide an opportunity for active mate choice in roe deer, where males are territorial, although we cannot rule out the alternative explanation that these movements are a means to avoid male harassment...|$|R
