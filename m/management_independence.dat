40|$|Like the United States, {{managers}} of Japan's large companies {{since the early}} 1950 s have had great autonomy because shareholding is dispersed. However, most Japanese companies have {{a significant portion of}} their shares stably held by other friendly financial institutions and businesses, a significant component of the integrated, synergistic "postwar economic system" embodied in the permanent employment system of industrial relations, the main bank system, and <b>management</b> <b>independence.</b> Employees rather than shareholders are the main potential constraint, so managers have given strong priority to employee interests. Japan's mediocre economic performance since 1991, and a range of publicized corporate scandals, are now undermining this system. Government policies and public pressure have improved corporate disclosure and transparency, and have made corporate governance through capital markets feasible. While managers in the future will place greater weight on shareholder interests, only a few companies are likely to adopt the Anglo-American corporate governance model. More likely is the gradual development of a hybrid approach in which management retains considerable autonomy and employee interests remain important...|$|E

The agency theory is used to link corporate governance mechanism and risk disclosure. The method used in this study is content analysis, this study covers the period 2014.

The findings reveal that corporate governance mechanisms i. e. multiple directorship and board size do have influence on the risk disclosure nevertheless the findings on other variables; risk <b>management</b> committee, board <b>independence</b> and the board expertise, did not reflect any association with risk disclosure. These findings show that the risk <b>management</b> committee, board <b>independence</b> and board finance expertise do not clearly affect risk disclosure in the context of Malaysian GLCs. Even though the risk management committee is separate from the audit committee, the large number of board independence and board financial expertise should have affected risk disclosure.

40|$|This paper explores {{causes and}} {{implications}} of the auditor changes. We investigate the US setting in which the changes are voluntary and there is mandatory disclosure about {{the reasons for the}} change. The findings show that changes with a departing Big- 4 are motivated by the auditor’s concerns about the client firm weaknesses in internal control processes and compliance with law. The changes between Non-Big- 4 auditors are associated with the issuance of going concern qualified opinions, suggesting possible audit opinion shopping by client firms. The switches from a Non-Big- 4 to a Big- 4 auditor are associated with issues related to the application of accounting standards. Overall, our findings suggest that changes allow auditors to better organise their audit, and balance the objectives of their assignments and the maintenance of effective client relations. The balance of reasonably effective internal controls systems and of risk-proportioned audit fees {{is at the core of}} negotiations between audit and client firms. Also, the search for more effective audit and higher governance and financial markets reputation may motivate the switch from a smaller audit firm to a Big- 4.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{statistical analysis}} supporting stylized facts about sovereign wealth funds (SWFs). It discusses the forces {{leading to the}} growth of SWFs, including the role of fuel exports and ongoing current account surpluses, and large hoarding of international reserves. It analyzes the degree to which measures of SWF governance and transparency compare with national norms of behavior. We provide evidence that many countries with SWFs are characterized by effective governance but weak democratic institutions, as compared to other nonindustrial countries. We also present a model with which we compare the optimal degree of diversification abroad by a central bank versus that of a sovereign wealth fund. We show that if the central bank manages its foreign assets with the objective of reducing the probability of sudden stops, it will place a high weight on the downside risk of holding risky assets abroad and will tend to hold primarily safe foreign assets. In contrast, if the sovereign wealth fund, acting on behalf of the Treasury, maximizes the expected utility of a representative domestic agent, it will opt for relatively greater holding of more risky foreign assets. We discuss how the degree of a country's transparency may affect the size of the foreign asset base entrusted to a wealth fund's management, and show that, for relatively low levels of public foreign assets, assigning portfolio <b>management</b> <b>independence</b> to the central bank may be advantageous. However, for a large enough foreign asset base, the opportunity cost associated with the limited portfolio diversification of the central bank induces authorities to establish a wealth fund in pursuit of higher returns.

40|$|Abstract: This paper investigates {{whether the}} extent of {{opportunistic}} earnings management (measured by discretionary accruals) is related to chairman independence and ownership structure. Based on a sample of UK companies, we find that Chairman Independence are important factors in constraining the inclination of managers to engage in earnings management which support the argument that outsiders ownership (institutional investors) contribute in constraining earnings management whereas insiders ownership (management ownership) do not. Our findings have implications for stakeholders and policymakers in that we find institutional ownership and Chairman Independence are important mechanisms of corporate governance. We find that independent chairman according to the UK corporate governance code criteria has no effect in detecting earnings management, while independent chairman using the code independence criteria set for non executive directors is significantly effective in reducing earnings management.

40|$|This study empirically {{examines}} {{the relation between}} two dimensions of auditor quality: auditor independence and auditor specialization, {{and the level of}} discretionary accruals, a proxy for earnings management. This study focuses on earnings management in response to mounting pressure amongst investors, policy makers and corporate governance reformists for mechanism to curb excessive opportunistic behaviour amongst corporate <b>management.</b> Auditor <b>independence</b> and auditor specialization are the epicentre of this analysis as these two factors are considered to be key determinants of earnings management. As earnings <b>management,</b> auditor <b>independence</b> and auditor specialization are unobservable, I use absolute discretionary accruals, the ratio of non-audit to total fees and auditor industry market share as respective proxies. Using 2004 data hand collected from 325 Australian publicly listed firms I find no sig-nificant association between the non-audit/total fee ratio and the magnitude of earnings man-agement. Thus, this result suggests the provision of non-audit services by the incumbent auditor does not compromise independence and, therefore, the auditor 2 ̆ 7 s ability to constrain earnings management. This study also fail to find a firm engaging an audit firm with industry specializa-tion skills has significantly lower levels of absolute discretionary accruals than a firm using the services of a non-specialist. The main findings of this study are robust to various sensitivity checks. Findings have implications for various stakeholders. For instance, there is currently ap-pears to be a preoccupation amongst corporate governance reformists and policy makers inter-nationally to curb the provision of non-audit services by the incumbent auditor to aid in such matters as the reduction in earnings management. These findings suggest this preoccupation may be misplaced and that constraining the ability of firms purchase non-audit services from the in-cumbent auditor could provide only limited benefits whilst increasing costs. In addition, policy makers and reformists need to consider more clearly {{the costs and benefits of}} any moves to limit industry concentrations within the audit market...|$|R
