50|$|Worst-case {{tolerance}} {{analysis is}} the traditional type of tolerance stackup calculation. The individual variables are placed at their tolerance limits {{in order to make}} the measurement as large or as small as possible. The worst-case model does not consider the distribution of the individual variables, but rather that those variables do not exceed their respective specified limits. This model predicts the maximum expected variation of the measurement. Designing to worst-case tolerance requirements guarantees 100 percent of the parts will assemble and function properly, regardless of the actual component variation. The major drawback is that the worst-case model often requires very tight individual component tolerances. The obvious result is expensive manufacturing and inspection processes and/or high scrap rates. Worst-case tolerancing is often required by the customer for critical <b>mechanical</b> <b>interfaces</b> and spare part replacement interfaces. When worst-case tolerancing is not a contract requirement, properly applied statistical tolerancing can ensure acceptable assembly yields with increased component tolerances and lower fabrication costs.|$|E

40|$|Interfacial {{delamination}} {{is a key}} reliability {{challenge in}} composites and micro-electronic systems due to (high-density) integration of dissimilar materials. Predictive finite element models are used to minimize delamination failures during design, but require accurate interface models to capture (irreversible) crack initiation and propagation behavior observed in experiments. Therefore, an Integrated Global Digital Image Correlation (I-GDIC) strategy is developed for accurate determination of <b>mechanical</b> <b>interface</b> behavior from in-situ delamination experiments. Recently, a novel miniature delamination setup was presented that enables in-situ microscopic characterization of interface delamination while sensitively measuring global load-displacement curves for all mode mixities. Nevertheless, extraction of detailed <b>mechanical</b> <b>interface</b> behavior from measured images is challenging, because deformations are tiny and measurement noise large. Therefore, an advanced I-GDIC methodology is developed which correlates the image patterns by only deforming the images using kinematically-admissible ‘eigenmodes’ that correspond to the few parameters controlling the interface tractions in an analytic description of the crack tip deformation field, thereby greatly enhancing accuracy and robustness. This method is validated on virtual delamination experiments, simulated using a recently developed self-adaptive cohesive zone (CZ) finite element framework...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe Santonian-Campanian Flamborough Head chalk cliffs (Yorkshire, UK) are an {{outstanding}} outcrop of once deeply-buried tight-chalk (until 1200 m). Flamborough Chalk showed that porosity ranges from 9 to 20 % and permeability from 0. 04 to 0. 2 mD (e. g. Faÿ-Gomord et al., 2016; Sagi et al., 2013). These outcrops {{are likely to}} be representative of sub-surface chalk reservoirs in nearby onshore and offshore regions, e. g. the North Sea. The zone had been strongly affected by transpressive tectonic deformations during Tertiary; which has been widely studied (e. g. Bell et al., 1999; Starmer, 2013; Welch et al., 2014), but the precoce fracture network, far from these intense deformation zone, has not been investigated yet. Evidence of synsedimentary faulting associated with polygonal-shaped fractures network was revealed by the observation of plateform images (acquired at low altitude and used in photogrammetry). These feature argue for isotropic horizontal state of stress during compaction. Thus, the measured multiple fracture orientations were active simultaneously and mechanically interacting, instead of the intersection of multiple regional sets of different ages reported in the literature. Compaction-related stylolitization occurred in chalk synchronously or soon after synsedimentary deformation, from 800 m to 1200 m, the maximum burial depth estimated for these outcrops, under the same stress field (sub-vertical s 1, and sub-horizontal s 2 and s 3). It results in numerous horizontal stylolithic planes and small cemented synsedimentary faults with small displacements often used as preferential pressure-dissolution planes with vertical stylolithic peak. This fracture pattern, observed in high resolution aerial images and in the field, is also studied using a mechanical stratigraphy approach (e. g. D Jacquemyn et al., 2012). The mechanical units have been characterized using the DigiFract software on high resolution photogrammetry panoramas (Bisdom et al., 2014). The <b>mechanical</b> <b>interfaces</b> have been defined and their strength quantified. It appears that sedimentological bedding is non-existent or invisible and that the fracture spacing is strongly controlled by the mechanical unit thickness. The mechanical units are mostly delimited by compaction features, such as stylolites and marl-seams, which accumulate insoluble residue, clay essentially. However not all insoluble residue layers behave as <b>mechanical</b> <b>interfaces</b> and the relationship between the thickness of the insoluble residues and the strength of the <b>mechanical</b> <b>interfaces</b> have also been investigated...|$|E
