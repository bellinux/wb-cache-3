5|$|All the {{alkali metals}} are highly {{reactive}} and are never found in elemental forms in nature. Because of this, {{they are usually}} stored in mineral oil or kerosene (paraffin oil). They react aggressively with the halogens to form the alkali metal halides, which are white ionic crystalline compounds that are all soluble in water except lithium fluoride (LiF). The alkali metals also react with water to form strongly alkaline hydroxides and thus should be handled with great care. The heavier alkali metals react more vigorously than the lighter ones; for example, when dropped into water, caesium produces a larger explosion than potassium if {{the same number of}} <b>moles</b> <b>of</b> each metal is used. The alkali metals have the lowest first ionisation energies in their respective periods of the periodic table because of their low effective nuclear charge and the ability to attain a noble gas configuration by losing just one electron. Not only do the alkali metals react with water, but also with proton donors like alcohols and phenols, gaseous ammonia, and alkynes, the last demonstrating the phenomenal degree of their reactivity. Their great power as reducing agents makes them very useful in liberating other metals from their oxides or halides.|$|E
5|$|The {{accuracy}} of the measured value of the Avogadro constant is currently limited by the uncertainty {{in the value of}} the Planck constant—a measure relating the energy of photons to their frequency. That relative standard uncertainty has been 50parts per billion (ppb) since 2006. By fixing the Avogadro constant, the practical effect of this proposal would be that the uncertainty in the mass of a 12C atom—and the magnitude of the kilogram—could be no better than the current 50ppb uncertainty in the Planck constant. Under this proposal, the magnitude of the kilogram would be subject to future refinement as improved measurements of the value of the Planck constant become available; electronic realizations of the kilogram would be recalibrated as required. Conversely, an electronic definition of the kilogram (see Electronic approaches, below), which would precisely fix the Planck constant, would continue to allow 83⅓ <b>moles</b> <b>of</b> 12C to have a mass of precisely one kilogram but the number of atoms comprising a mole (the Avogadro constant) would continue to be subject to future refinement.|$|E

50|$|The {{demethylation}} of sarcosine catalyzed by sarcosine dehydrogenase {{can proceed}} {{with or without}} the presence of tetrahydrofolate. Under anaerobic condition and without tetrahydrofolate, however, a free formaldehyde is formed after the N-demethylation of sarcosine. The reaction with 1 <b>mole</b> <b>of</b> sarcosine and 1 <b>mole</b> <b>of</b> FAD, under this condition, yields 1 <b>mole</b> <b>of</b> glycine and 1 <b>mole</b> <b>of</b> formaldehyde (See figure 2 for mechanism).|$|R

Nevi larger than 20mm (3/4") in size are at higher risk for becoming cancerous.|$|E
25|$|Pressure: The rate of gaseous {{reactions}} {{increases with}} pressure, which is, in fact, equivalent {{to an increase}} in concentration of the gas.The reaction rate increases in the direction where there are fewer <b>moles</b> <b>of</b> gas and decreases in the reverse direction. For condensed-phase reactions, the pressure dependence is weak.|$|E
5000|$|The mass <b>of</b> one <b>mole</b> <b>of</b> a {{substance}} depends {{not only on}} its molecular formula, {{but also on the}} proportion of the isotopes of each element present in it. For example, one <b>mole</b> <b>of</b> calcium-40 is [...] ± [...] grams, whereas one <b>mole</b> <b>of</b> calcium-42 is [...] ± [...] grams, and one <b>mole</b> <b>of</b> calcium with the normal isotopic mix is 40.078 ± 0.004 grams.|$|R

25|$|The {{stoichiometric}} ratio of MS to H2S is 1:1, meaning for every sulfide ion present as a metal sulfide compound, one molecule of H2S is generated. Thus, the amount (in <b>moles)</b> <b>of</b> H2S measured by weighing the trap {{is equal to}} the amount of AVS originally present in the sediment.|$|E
25|$|One niche use of CrCl3 {{in organic}} {{synthesis}} {{is for the}} in situ preparation of chromium(II) chloride, a reagent for the reduction of alkyl halides and for the synthesis of (E)-alkenyl halides. The reaction is usually performed using two <b>moles</b> <b>of</b> CrCl3 per mole of lithium aluminium hydride, although if aqueous acidic conditions are appropriate zinc and hydrochloric acid may be sufficient.|$|E
25|$|Methyl {{isocyanate}} {{is usually}} manufactured by {{the reaction of}} monomethylamine and phosgene. For large scale production, it is advantageous to combine these reactants at higher temperature in the gas phase. A mixture of methyl isocyanate and two <b>moles</b> <b>of</b> hydrogen chloride is formed, but N-methylcarbamoyl chloride (MCC) forms as the mixture is condensed, leaving one mole of hydrogen chloride as a gas.|$|E
2500|$|The solubility, S, in {{the absence}} of a common ion can be {{calculated}} as follows.

50|$|The {{microbial}} urease catalyzes the hydrolysis of urea into ammonium and carbonate. One <b>mole</b> <b>of</b> urea is hydrolyzed intracellularly to 1 mol {{of ammonia}} and 1 <b>mole</b> <b>of</b> Carbamic acid (1), which spontaneously hydrolyzes {{to form an}} additional 1 <b>mole</b> <b>of</b> ammonia and carbonic acid (2).|$|R

25|$|Other {{thermodynamic}} potentials {{may be used}} {{to replace}} internal energy so long as proper care is taken in recognizing which natural variables correspond to which potential. For the recommended nomenclature of these potentials, see (Alberty, 2001). Equation (2) is useful for processes where system volume, entropy, and number of <b>moles</b> <b>of</b> various components change because internal energy is also a function of these variables and no others.|$|E
25|$|According to the Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO), a metal {{amino acid}} chelate {{is defined as}} the product {{resulting}} from the reaction of a metal ion from a soluble metal salt with a mole ratio of one to three (preferably two) <b>moles</b> <b>of</b> amino acids. The average weight of the hydrolyzed amino acids must be approximately 150 and the resulting molecular weight of the chelate must not exceed 800 Da.|$|E
25|$|Until all hydrogens {{attached}} to boron {{have been transferred}} away, the boron group BH2 will continue adding to more alkenes. This means that one mole of hydroborane will undergo the reaction with three <b>moles</b> <b>of</b> alkene. Furthermore, {{it is not necessary}} for the hydroborane to have more than one hydrogen. For example, reagents of the type R2BH are commonly used, where R can represents the remainder of the molecule. Such modified hydroboration reagents include 9-BBN, catecholborane, and disiamylborane.|$|E

30|$|Purified non-citraconylated rmCRP was {{analyzed}} for amino acid composition by standard analysis {{and was found}} to contain {{the same number of}} amino acid residues per <b>mole</b> <b>of</b> protein as the biologically purified CRP subunit. Eleven alanine residues were quantified per <b>mole</b> <b>of</b> recombinant CRP compared to 9 per <b>mole</b> <b>of</b> mCRP, and two cysteine residues were quantified per <b>mole</b> <b>of</b> mCRP while none were detected in rmCRP. Three methionine resides were quantified per <b>mole</b> <b>of</b> rmCRP compared to two in the biological CRP subunit. These results corroborate the changes engineered in the recombinant CRP subunit and verifying the expressed protein is in other ways identical to the biologically derived CRP molecule. These procedures were performed under contract by Analytical Biotechnology Services, Boston, MA.|$|R
50|$|One <b>mole</b> <b>of</b> I2 is {{consumed}} for each <b>mole</b> <b>of</b> H2O. The titration reaction proceeds as above, {{and the end}} point may be detected by a bipotentiometric method as described above.|$|R
25|$|In May 2007 {{biochemical}} engineers {{from the}} Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University and biologists and chemists from the Oak Ridge National Laboratory announced {{a method of}} producing high-yield pure hydrogen from starch and water. In 2009, they demonstrated to produce nearly 12 <b>moles</b> <b>of</b> hydrogen per glucose unit from cellulosic materials and water. Thanks to complete conversion and modest reaction conditions, they propose to use carbohydrate as a high energy density hydrogen carrier with a density of 14.8 wt%.|$|E
25|$|As a {{starting}} material {{for industrial production}} of lactic chemistry, that is applied for chemical synthesis, almost any carbohydrate source containing C5/C6 sugars could be used. Pure sucrose, glucose from starch, raw sugar beet juice are frequently applied. Lactic acid producing bacteria could be divided in two classes: homofermentative bacteria like Lactobacillus casei and Lactococcus lactis, producing two <b>moles</b> <b>of</b> lactate from one mole of glucose, heterofermentative species producing one mole of lactate from one mole of glucose as well as carbon dioxide and acetic acid/ethanol.|$|E
25|$|Most {{chemical}} reactions are reversible, that {{is they can}} and do run in both directions. The forward and reverse reactions are competing {{with each other and}} differ in reaction rates. These rates depend on the concentration and therefore change with time of the reaction: the reverse rate gradually increases and becomes equal to the rate of the forward reaction, establishing the so-called chemical equilibrium. The time to reach equilibrium depends on such parameters as temperature, pressure and the materials involved, and is determined by the minimum free energy. In equilibrium, the Gibbs free energy must be zero. The pressure dependence can be explained with the Le Chatelier's principle. For example, an increase in pressure due to decreasing volume causes the reaction to shift to the side with the fewer <b>moles</b> <b>of</b> gas.|$|E
50|$|Because 6 <b>mole</b> <b>of</b> {{fluoride}} {{react with}} one <b>mole</b> <b>of</b> aluminium, the titration is particularly precise, and a coefficient of variance (CV) of 0.03 {{has been achieved}} {{in the analysis of}} alum.|$|R
50|$|Large complex gas {{molecules}} {{may have}} high heat capacities per <b>mole</b> <b>of</b> gas molecules, but their heat capacities per <b>mole</b> <b>of</b> total gas atoms {{are very similar}} to those of liquids and solids, again differing by less than a factor <b>of</b> two per <b>mole</b> <b>of</b> atoms. This factor of two represents vibrational degrees of freedom available in solids vs. gas molecules of various complexities.|$|R
50|$|It is {{particularly}} important for ion-exchange polymers (also called ion-exchange resins): one equivalent of an ion-exchange polymer will exchange one <b>mole</b> <b>of</b> singly charged ions, but only half a <b>mole</b> <b>of</b> doubly charged ions.|$|R
500|$|All silicon-based {{approaches}} would fix the Avogadro constant but vary in {{the details}} of the definition of the kilogram. One approach would use silicon with all three of its natural isotopes present. About 7.78% of silicon comprises the two heavier isotopes: 29Si and 30Si. As described in Carbon12 above, this method would define the magnitude of the kilogram in terms of a certain number of 12C atoms by fixing the Avogadro constant; the silicon sphere would be the practical realization. This approach could accurately delineate the magnitude of the kilogram because the masses of the three silicon nuclides relative to 12C are known with great precision (relative uncertainties of 1ppb or better). An alternative method for creating a silicon sphere-based kilogram proposes to use isotopic separation techniques to enrich the silicon until it is nearly pure 28Si, which has a relative atomic mass of [...] With this approach, the Avogadro constant would not only be fixed, but so too would the atomic mass of 28Si. As such, the definition of the kilogram would be decoupled from 12C and the kilogram would instead be defined as · atoms of 28Si (≈ fixed <b>moles</b> <b>of</b> 28Si atoms). Physicists could elect to define the kilogram in terms of 28Si even when kilogram prototypes are made of natural silicon (all three isotopes present). Even with a kilogram definition based on theoretically pure 28Si, a silicon-sphere prototype made of only nearly pure 28Si would necessarily deviate slightly from the defined number of <b>moles</b> <b>of</b> silicon to compensate for various chemical and isotopic impurities as well as the effect of surface oxides.|$|E
500|$|Though not {{offering}} a practical realization, this definition would precisely define {{the magnitude of}} the kilogram in terms of a certain number of carbon12 atoms. Carbon12 (12C) is an isotope of carbon. The mole is currently defined as [...] "the quantity of entities (elementary particles like atoms or molecules) equal to the number of atoms in 12 grams of carbon12". Thus, the current definition of the mole requires that [...] (83⅓) <b>moles</b> <b>of</b> 12C has a mass of precisely one kilogram. The number of atoms in a mole, a quantity known as the Avogadro constant, is experimentally determined, and the current best estimate of its value is [...] This new definition of the kilogram proposed to fix the Avogadro constant at precisely [...] with the kilogram being defined as [...] "the mass equal to that of [...] atoms of 12C".|$|E
2500|$|In {{the real}} system, however, the total <b>moles</b> <b>of</b> a {{component}} {{varies depending on}} the arbitrary placement of the dividing surface. [...] The quantitative measure of adsorption of the -th component is captured by the surface excess quantity. [...] The surface excess represents {{the difference between the}} total <b>moles</b> <b>of</b> the -th component in a system and the <b>moles</b> <b>of</b> the -th component in a particular phase (either [...] or [...] ) and is represented by: ...|$|E
500|$|As {{even the}} most massive atoms are far too light to work with directly, chemists instead use the unit <b>of</b> <b>moles.</b> One <b>mole</b> <b>of</b> atoms of any element always has {{the same number of}} atoms (about [...] ). This number was chosen so that if an element has an atomic mass <b>of</b> 1u, a <b>mole</b> <b>of</b> atoms of that element has a mass close to one gram. Because of the {{definition}} of the unified atomic mass unit, each carbon-12 atom has an atomic mass of exactly 12u, and so a <b>mole</b> <b>of</b> carbon-12 atoms weighs exactly 0.012kg.|$|R
50|$|For example, {{the energy}} needed to convert a <b>mole</b> <b>of</b> ethane to a <b>mole</b> <b>of</b> ethyl radicals, 423.0 kJ/mol, is, for each bond in that mole, 423.0/96.485 = 4.38 ev/bond ≈ 4.40 ev/bond. Likewise, 460 kJ/mol becomes 460/96.485 = 4.77 ev/bond.|$|R
