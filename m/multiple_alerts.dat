Finally, the Action layer receives a decision information and judges by itself how and when to trigger an information, warning or intervention for the driver. This simplified concept helps the design of intelligent vehicles by using one single reliable and precise source of perception of the environment including the vehicle itself and avoid <b>multiple</b> <b>alerts</b> or conflicting messages displayed to the driver.|$|E

However, the intelligence services had received a tipoff about the attack and the trucks, which are in fact empty, are blown up by the US Army. The victory is short-lived however: the train that is carrying the real plutonium is attacked and derailed forcing them to capitulate to the demands for the submarine.

The method also enables automatic signature generation that can be deployed immediately to network firewalls and content filters to proactively protect other hosts.

Twenty-four participants, balanced for age and gender, drove an instrumented vehicle on a test-track while haptic alerts (vibrations in the driver seat) were generated.

Data analytics frameworks decomposes our problems to build applications that {{are more than just}} inference and can help make predictions as well as prescriptions to problems in real time instead of batch processes. Information Security is becoming more important to organizations as the Internet and cloud technologies become more integrated with their internal processes. The number of attacks and attack vectors has been increasing steadily over the years. Border defense measures (e. g. Intrusion Detection Systems) are no longer enough to identify and stop attackers. Data driven information security is not a new approach to solving information security; however there is an increased emphasis on combining heterogeneous sources to gain a broader view of the problem instead of isolated systems. Stitching together <b>multiple</b> <b>alerts</b> into a cohesive system can increase the number of True Positives. With the increased concern of unknown insider threats and zero-day attacks, identifying unknown attack vectors becomes more difficult. Previous research has shown that with as little as 10 commands it is possible to identify a masquerade attack against a user 2 ̆ 7 s profile. This thesis is going to look at a data driven information security architecture that relies on both behavioral analysis of SSH profiles and bad actor data collected from an SSH honeypot to identify bad actor attack vectors. Honeypots should collect only data from bad actors; therefore have a high True Positive rate. Using Apache Spark and Apache Hadoop we can create a real time data driven architecture that can collect and analyze new bad actor behaviors from honeypot data and monitor legitimate user accounts to create predictive and prescriptive models.

40|$|Project (M. S., Computer Science) [...] California State University, Sacramento, 2012. The aim of {{this project}} {{is to create an}} {{application}} that can provide location based alerts on Android mobile phones. While a time based alarm application alerts a user at a specified time, a location based alert application alerts a user when he/she is in the proximity of a specified location. The application lets the user specify a central location of a region and a radius around it and alerts the user when he/she enters the circular region. Both GPS and network provider can be used for providing location based alerts. Users can use GPS for getting more accurate location information and use network providers to preserve battery life and to get location information indoors. The following are the main features of the application. (1) Alert List. The application stores location alerts in file system and displays them every time the application is opened. User can add new alerts, edit/delete existing alerts and set <b>multiple</b> <b>alerts</b> for different locations. The application is not required to run in the foreground for receiving the alerts. (2) Weekly Reminders. User can choose to receive alerts on specific days of the week. (3) Favorite-places List. User can maintain a list of favorite places and use the list to enable location alerts for those places when needed. (4) Interaction with contacts-list. The application interacts with native 'contacts' application and lets the user choose address of any of the contacts for setting a location alert. (5) Enable/Disable alerts. The application provides options to turn on/off alerts and to set radius. Though there are existing mobile applications that provide location-based services, this application has some unique set of features that differentiates it from other applications. For instance, the application maintains a list of favorite places the user would like to visit and helps user set location alerts for the places in the list. The application further enhances user experience by letting user set location alerts for any of the contacts in native contact-list application. The application also helps in improving performance by implementing an efficient algorithm for setting weekly reminders that saves battery life.

40|$|Alerting {{systems are}} {{becoming}} pervasive in process operations, which {{may result in}} the potential for dissonance or conflict in information from different alerting systems that suggests different threat levels and/or actions to resolve hazards. Little is currently available to help in predicting or solving the dissonance problem. This thesis presents a methodology to model and analyze dissonance between alerting systems, providing both a theoretical foundation for understanding dissonance and a practical basis from which specific problems can be addressed. A state-space representation of <b>multiple</b> <b>alerting</b> system operation is generalized that can be tailored {{across a variety of}} applications. Based on the representation, two major causes of dissonance are identified: logic differences and sensor error. Additionally, several possible types of dissonance are identified. A mathematical analysis method is developed to identify the conditions for dissonance originating from logic differences. A probabilistic analysis methodology is developed to estimate the probability of dissonance originating from sensor error, and to compare the relative contribution to dissonance of sensor error against the contribution from logic differences. A hybrid model, which describes the dynamic behavior of the process with <b>multiple</b> <b>alerting</b> systems, is developed to identify dangerous dissonance space, from which the process can lead to disaster. Methodologies to avoid or mitigate dissonance are outlined. Two examples are used to demonstrate the application of the methodology. First, a conceptual In-Trail Spacing example is presented. The methodology is applied to identify the conditions for possible dissonance, to identify relative contribution of logic difference and sensor error, and to identify dangerous dissonance space. Several proposed mitigation methods are demonstrated in this example. In the second example, the methodology is applied to address the dissonance problem between two air traffic alert and avoidance systems: the existing Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) vs. the proposed Airborne Conflict Management system (ACM). Conditions on ACM resolution maneuvers are identified to avoid dynamic dissonance between TCAS and ACM.

Methods/Analysis: To achieve {{the purpose of this}} paper, data was collected through simulating a vehicle crash in different traffic scenarios. The data collected was then used to design a Misbehaviour Detection Scheme considering two inputs of Emergency Electronic Brake Light (EEBL) and Lane Change (LC). To confirm the veracity of transmitted Post-Crash Notification (PCN) alert, Bayes' rule was used to combine the two alert evidences. Findings: In each of the experiments conducted, the scenario belief values (probability of individual events) were calculated and Bayes' rule was used for combining the two evidences to obtain a better belief value. Simulation results show that increasing vehicle speed improves detection accuracy. Traffic scenarios having vehicles with low speed transmits fewer secondary alerts. Existing MDS uses single secondary alerts for verifying received PCN alerts.

The techniques used to perform cybercrimes are becoming sophisticated relatively with the firewalls protecting them. Reaching high-level of data protection, in both wired and wireless networks, in order to face recent cybercrime approaches is a challenge that is continuously proven hard to achieve. In a common IT infrastructure, the deployed network devices contain a number of event logs that reside locally within its memory.

40|$|Falling asleep while {{operating}} a vehicle leads to serious accidents {{and loss of}} lives. The challenge of detecting drowsiness nonintrusively stems from {{the absence of a}} single marker, and the existence of diverse signs and symptoms that collectively but not uniquely characterize it. Current alerters for locomotive cabs are inadequate partly because they a) often monitor one modality b) fail to consider the inherent characteristics of the locomotive operator tasks and physical environment, and c) are typically developed without quantitative techniques to assess performance and optimize components as part of an overall system, rather than at the individual level. Based on an estimation theory framework, a new systems approach is here proposed to design locomotive cab alerting technologies. The main idea is to combine information from an infrared eyelid monitor and a generic Train Sentry class activity monitor, to isolate the common drowsiness component and obtain an improved estimate of the operator's state. A study first quantified the important physical aspects of the locomotive cab and engineer behavior pertinent to the performance of image-based eye closure monitors. (cont.) A bench test study evaluated Attention Technology's current infrared eye closure monitor prototype front-end image analysis, Model DD- 850, to verify whether its performance was a good match to the locomotive physical environment and engineer behavioral characteristics. Data from these studies were used to develop a simulation software tool in MATLAB/SIMULINK. The goal was to assess the proposed tandem detector solution and to support rational design, development and optimization of future locomotive alerting systems. A signal detection theory (SDT) approach was employed. However, the detectors were nonlinear, had <b>multiple</b> <b>alerting</b> levels and displayed non-Gaussian noise characteristics. Therefore, Monte Carlo methods were used to compute their SDT parameters on both a standalone and tandem basis. Investigation through simulation showed that adopting an architecture using tandem detectors and an "AND" logic based arbiter reduces the false alarm rate by an order of magnitude and improves the total time to alert, at the expense of only a few percent in missed alarm probability. Detection performance may be further enhanced using a speed dependent arbiter with "AND" logic above a speed threshold and "OR" logic below it. (cont.) In the simulation, the speed threshold was found to be 25 mph. This system-level study provides enough ground to build a prototype system and test the proposed solution in a simulator.

50|$|These factors {{decrease}} relative food competition since {{control over}} a food source by an individual is not correlated to the duration or richness of said source. The passing of information acts to create a foraging group. Group foraging decreases predation and increases relative feeding time {{at the cost of}} sharing a food source. The decrease in predation is due to the dilution factor and an early warning system created by having <b>multiple</b> animals <b>alert.</b> Increases in relative feeding are explained by decreasing time spent watching for predators and social learning. Recruiting new members to food patches benefits successful foragers by increasing relative numbers. With the addition of new members to a group the benefits of group foraging increase until the group size is larger than the food source is able to support. Less successful foragers benefit by gaining knowledge of where food sources are located. Aerial displays are used to recruit individuals to participate in group foraging. However, not all birds display since not all birds are members in a group or are part of a group that is seeking participants. In the presence of patchy resources, Richner and Heeb propose the simplest manner would be to form a communal roost and recruit participants there.
