5|$|Quants, a {{grassland}} clearing in a forestry plantation {{well known}} for its butterflies including Duke of Burgundy, <b>marsh</b> <b>fritillary</b> and wood white, {{is a candidate for}} Special Area of Conservation (cSAC). These are designated under the European Commission Habitats Directive (92/43/EEC) as internationally important habitats.|$|E
25|$|These {{protected}} habitats {{support a}} variety of wildlife such as harbour porpoises and <b>marsh</b> <b>fritillary.</b>|$|E
25|$|Rare {{plants that}} occur in Wanister Bog include devil's-bit scabious, Succisa pratensis, and marsh violet, Viola palustris. The former is the food plant of the <b>marsh</b> <b>fritillary,</b> Euphydryas aurinia, and the narrow-bordered bee hawk-moth, Hemaris tityus, while the latter is the food plant of the pearl-bordered fritillary, Boloria euphrosyne, and the small pearl-bordered fritillary.|$|E
50|$|As {{with many}} farms in England Sheepdrove {{has entered the}} Defra {{agri-environment}} schemes to help support farmland biodiversity including special measures to restore habitats such as Sheepdrove Rare Butterfly Project which aims to attract <b>marsh</b> <b>fritillaries.</b> The farm has records of 25 species of butterfly, 10 species of bee, 6 species of bat and 104 species of bird (including 5 types of owl). Notable plants include the goldilocks buttercup, field gromwell and Venus's looking-glass.|$|R
50|$|Mayenne has a {{diversity}} of habitat types such as forest, heathland, bog and farmland. Some 1445 species of plants, 63 species of mammals, 280 species of birds, 16 species of amphibians and 11 species of reptiles have been recorded, as well as thousands of species of invertebrates. The peat-lands and bogs are often fringed with woodlands of alder and ash, and in some places carnivorous plants such as sundew and butterwort flourish, <b>fritillaries,</b> <b>marsh</b> cinquefoil and cottongrass grow and butterflies, dragonflies and spiders abound.|$|R
6000|$|As to salmon, Walton {{scarcely}} speaks a true {{word about}} their habits, except by accident. Concerning pike, he quotes {{the theory that}} they are bred by pickerel weed, only as what 'some think.' In describing the use of frogs as bait, he makes the famous, or infamous, remark, 'Use him as though you loved him [...] . that he may live the longer.' A bait-fisher {{may be a good}} man, as Izaak was, but it is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle. As coarse fish are usually caught only with bait, I shall not follow Izaak on to this unholy and unfamiliar ground, wherein, none the less, grow flowers of Walton's fancy, and the songs of the old poets are heard. The Practical Angler, indeed, is a book to be marked with flowers, <b>marsh</b> marigolds and <b>fritillaries,</b> and petals of the yellow iris, for the whole provokes us to content, and whispers that word of the apostle, 'Study to be quiet.' ...|$|R
25|$|The {{site was}} {{previously}} populated with scattered juniper (Juniperus communis) bushes, {{but these are}} now removed and the current grazing regime ensures {{that they do not}} return. There are some invertebrates recorded, including for <b>marsh</b> <b>fritillary</b> (Euphydryas aurinia) and small heath (Coenonympha pamphilus) butterflies, and a number of downland birds are present including for the skylark, corn bunting and grey partridge.|$|E
25|$|The {{characteristic}} and notable species {{outside the}} core area include sea purslane (Halimione portulacoides), Salicornia spp., pea crabs that live inside mussels, lugworm, Hydrobia snails, and annual seablite (Suaeda maritima) in estuarine and saltmarsh habitats; common reed (Phragmites australis), creeping bentgrass (Agrostis stolonifera), common rush (Juncus effusus), and fat duckweed (Lemna gibba) {{in the low}} and grazing marshland of the floodplains; and hawthorn (Crataegus monogyna), blackthorn (Prunus spinosa), ash (Fraxinus excelsior), crested dog's-tail (Cynosurus cristatus), and creeping bentgrass in mixed farmland. The reserve also contains nationally rare mammals such as the common dormouse and the European otter, the <b>marsh</b> <b>fritillary</b> butterfly, and coral reef off Lundy Island found nowhere else.|$|E

50|$|This site is {{designated}} {{due to its}} biological qualities, {{especially its}} wet heath and marshy grassland. It also has an important population of the nationally scarce <b>marsh</b> <b>fritillary</b> butterfly (Eurodryas aurinia).|$|E
50|$|The site {{is known}} for its variety of {{invertebrates}} and butterflies recorded are chalkhill blue, small blue, <b>marsh</b> <b>fritillary</b> and Duke of Burgundy fritillary. Moth records include cistus forester and juniper carpet.|$|E
5000|$|The project's page also notes: [...] "The Ottery {{supports}} {{a broad range}} of wildlife including populations of trout and migratory fish, otters, kingfishers, sand martins, dippers, curlews, snipe and the <b>marsh</b> <b>fritillary</b> butterfly." ...|$|E
5000|$|... 36 {{species of}} {{resident}} breeding butterflies {{have been recorded}} including <b>marsh</b> <b>fritillary</b> (Euphydryas aurinia), high brown fritillary (Argynnis cydippe), brown hairstreak (Thecla betulae), Duke of Burgundy (Hamearis lucina) and purple emperor (Apatura iris).|$|E
50|$|It is {{occasionally}} {{used by the}} <b>marsh</b> <b>fritillary</b> as a foodplant {{instead of}} its usual foodplant of devils bit scabious (Succisa pratensis). It is also the foodplant of the narrow-bordered bee hawk-moth (Hemaris tityus).|$|E
5000|$|It {{consists}} of a grassland clearing in a forestry plantation. It {{is well known for}} its butterflies [...] - [...] among the species which occur are Duke of Burgundy, <b>marsh</b> <b>fritillary</b> and wood white.|$|E
50|$|The site carries {{international}} importance {{because it}} holds {{one of the}} best populations of the <b>marsh</b> <b>fritillary</b> butterfly in Wales. At peak times, thousands of butterflies can be seen flying around parts of the site.|$|E
50|$|In the British Isles {{the main}} food plant of the larval {{stage of the}} <b>marsh</b> <b>fritillary</b> is the devil's bit scabious, Succisa pratensis, but can also include the field scabious, Knautia arvensis, and the small scabious, Scabiosa columbaria.|$|E
50|$|When {{the site}} was {{recorded}} as an SSSI it supported a strong breeding population of the <b>marsh</b> <b>fritillary</b> (Eurodryas aurinia), however this declined in the late 20th century, and this species is no longer found at the site.|$|E
5000|$|In the British Isles the <b>marsh</b> <b>fritillary</b> {{is usually}} {{to be found}} in damp heathy grasslands which are called rhos {{pastures}} from the Welsh word [...] meaning heath, but the species does exist in other types of habitats which are drier, like neutral grasslands or dry calcareous grasslands. Small populations may be seen where there is not a lot of the larval food plant present. Small populations can be an important element of the ecology because they can produce lots of mobile individuals which can found other populations. The <b>marsh</b> <b>fritillary</b> is protected under British law. It is listed under Schedule 5 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act, also the EU Habitats and Species Directive (Annex II).|$|E
50|$|In spring, the {{woodland}} on {{the slopes}} above the bog is transformed by a spectacular cover of primroses, wood anemone and bluebells. The huge variety of insects found here includes the rare <b>marsh</b> <b>fritillary</b> butterfly and many kinds of dragonfly and damselfly.|$|E
50|$|Rhos Gellie is a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) in Ceredigion, west Wales. It {{has been}} {{designated}} since 1988 as an SSSI {{as it is a}} habitat for <b>marsh</b> <b>fritillary</b> butterflies and also has a unique combination of varied vegetation types.|$|E
50|$|The {{diversity}} of the landscape is an important refuge and home to many plant and animal species: rare orchids like the lady's slipper, the clubtail dragonfly, the <b>marsh</b> <b>fritillary,</b> the whinchat, the red-backed shrike, the black stork, the kingfisher and the otter.|$|E
50|$|Caeau Ffos Fach is a Site of Special Scientific Interest in Carmarthen & Dinefwr, Wales. Part of this SSSI is {{a nature}} reserve {{owned by the}} charity Butterfly Conservation {{primarily}} because {{of the population of the}} rare and legally protected butterfly species the <b>marsh</b> <b>fritillary.</b>|$|E
