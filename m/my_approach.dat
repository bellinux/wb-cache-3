25|$|This article {{discusses}} {{the human rights}} situation of Kurds in Turkey. Kurds have {{had a long history}} of discrimination and massacres perpetrated against them by the Turkish government. In the last hundred years, four Eastern Anatolian groups—Armenians, Kurds, Assyrians, and Greeks—have fallen victim to state-sponsored attempts by the Ottoman authorities or their Turkish or Iraqi successors to eradicate them. Because of space limitations, I have concentrated here on the genocidal sequence affecting Armenians and Kurds only, though <b>my</b> <b>approach</b> would also be pertinent to the Pontic Greek and Assyrian cases.|$|E
25|$|Following the Young Turk Revolution at the {{beginning}} of the 20th century and the flowering of Turkish nationalism, the destruction or assimilation of minority populations (particularly Armenians, Assyrians and Kurds) has been a recurring pattern.

500|$|Lawson {{has adopted}} a casual {{approach}} to cooking, stating, [...] "I think cooking should be about fun and family. ... I think part of my appeal is that <b>my</b> <b>approach</b> to cooking is really relaxed and not rigid. There are no rules in my kitchen." [...] One editor, highlighting the technical simplicity of Lawson's recipes, noted that [...] "her dishes require none of the elaborate preparation called for by most TV chefs".|$|E
500|$|McCartney {{was largely}} a self-taught musician, and his {{approach}} was described by musicologist Ian MacDonald as [...] "by nature drawn to music's formal aspects yet wholly untutored... produced technically 'finished' work almost entirely by instinct, his harmonic judgement based mainly on perfect pitch and an acute pair of ears ... natural melodist—a creator of tunes capable of existing apart from their harmony". McCartney commented, [...] "I prefer to think of <b>my</b> <b>approach</b> to music as... rather like the primitive cave artists, who drew without training." ...|$|E
500|$|Davis {{later said}} [...] "Jim Wong [...] {{was a big}} help, too. A lot of the stage {{directions}} point toward farce, but Jim told me to play against that and just let the situation play out. The Forrest Gump scene was difficult, too. When I prepared it and did it the first time, I was almost Shakespearean in <b>my</b> <b>approach.</b> Jim made me toss it off more, and it worked fine". Chris Owens who portrayed the Young Smoking Man spent time watching how Davis smokes to ensure {{that he did it}} just like him. Owens later appeared as a young version of The Smoking Man again in the episode [...] "Demons", and as his son Jeffrey Spender.|$|E

500|$|In March 1967, Bonniwell and Ross {{ushered in}} the new lineup at United Western Recorders to record the second album The Bonniwell Music Machine. The {{recording}} and mixing process was painstakingly masterminded almost solely by Bonniwell, who was appreciative of his new bandmates' efforts to develop the album's concept, but disillusioned by the project's lack of cohesion. He further explains that the [...] "Warner Brothers album has such an eclectic approach; each track is (was) a singular, studio invention. Not only was my songwriting divergent, but <b>my</b> <b>approach</b> to recording was exploratory as well". Six of the album's tracks were holdovers from the first lineup's sessions at Cosimo Matassa's studio and RCA Studios. This resulted in a hodgepodge of musical styles, including exploratory approaches toward psychedelia and soft rock. On February 10, 1968, The Bonniwell Music Machine was released with little commercial success. Conseqently, the Bonniwell Music Machine was largely forgotten {{by the general public}} and the second lineup fragmented in July 1968.|$|E
500|$|Influenced by his {{honeymoon in}} the Caribbean, Jarrell became {{interested}} in the effects of man-made and natural sunlight on the environment. Experimentation with pigments, media, imagery and design allowed him to create artworks that fully expressed his intended messages. Referring to works such as Nassau (1968) and Sign of the Times (1966), Jarrell commented: [...] "The colors of the Bahamas influenced my use of color and <b>my</b> <b>approach</b> to my work." [...] With Sign of the Times he shows a street scene, his first attempt at a painting involving social interaction. In 1968, Jarrell became art director at Sander Line Graphics, only to quit shortly thereafter to become self-employed. Aside from creating his art he also started a successful mail-order photo processing business. Soon after Jarrell and Jae decided to open a gallery space below their studio: WJ Studio and Gallery. While the studio and gallery flourished, Jarrell taught part-time art classes at Wadsworth Elementary School and considered moving to New York, seeking refuge {{in the heart of the}} art world.|$|E
500|$|A {{graduate}} of Columbia University architecture school, Kosinski's knowledge of architecture was pivotal in conceptualizing the Tron: Legacy universe. His approach in cultivating a prototype {{was different from}} other film directors because, according to Kosinski, he came [...] "from a design point of view"; [...] "Some of my favorite directors come from outside of the film business, so that made <b>my</b> <b>approach</b> different from other directors, but a design background makes sense for a movie like this because the whole world {{has to be made}} from scratch." [...] Lisberger would later state that he left the sequel to a different production team because [...] "after thirty years I don’t want to compete with myself", and to showcase how the next generation dealt with the themes contained in Tron - [...] "If I brought my network in, it would be a little bit like one of those Clint Eastwood movies where all the old guys go to space." [...] Lisberger added that [...] "I dig this role of being the Obi-Wan or the Yoda on this film more than being the guy in the trenches", stating that unlike Kosinski his age was a hindering factor - [...] "I cannot work sixteen hours a day staring at twenty-five monitors for most of that time." ...|$|E
60|$|Mr. Brough {{of course}} was made aware of <b>my</b> <b>approaching</b> marriage, as of {{everything}} else relating to every clerk in the office; and I do believe Abednego told him what we had for dinner every day. Indeed, his knowledge of our affairs was wonderful.|$|R

500|$|The same year, Garfield co-starred {{opposite}} Jesse Eisenberg in The Social Network, a drama {{based on}} the founders of Facebook. On his character, Garfield remarked that [...] "No one knows who Eduardo Saverin is, and I don't either. Of course, the fact he's a real-life human being, breathing on this Earth somewhere, creates a whole new dimension to <b>my</b> <b>approach</b> because you feel {{a greater sense of}} responsibility". Initially, the film's director, David Fincher, had met Garfield under the auspices of him playing Mark Zuckerberg, having been referred to him by Mark Romanek. However, Fincher did not like Garfield for the part as he found Garfield's [...] "incredible emotional access to his kind of core humanity" [...] better tailored for the role of Saverin. Garfield's performance was very well received; he earned wider recognition and numerous nominations, including BAFTA nominations for Best Actor in a Supporting Role and Rising Star, as well as a Golden Globe nomination for Best Performance in a Supporting Role. Mark Kermode of the BBC expressed his surprise that Garfield had been overlooked for an Academy Award nomination, opining that [...] "everyone knows he's one of the very best things about the Social Network". Writing in The Wall Street Journal, Joe Morgenstern thought the role was portrayed with [...] "great subtlety and rueful charm". Rolling Stone said Garfield delivered [...] "a vulnerability that raises the emotional stakes in a movie", and proclaimed: [...] "Keep your eyes on Garfield — he's shatteringly good, the soul of a film that might otherwise be without one." [...] He received similar plaudits of the Los Angeles Times, Entertainment Weekly, and The New Yorker.|$|E

2500|$|Andrews {{also wrote}} in his book Man of No Property that [...] "I have always {{believed}} that all individuals are, as human beings, equally important. <b>My</b> <b>approach</b> to them has been the same, high or low.

[...] As I answered, {{it struck}} me that she might have formed some {{intention}} of appealing to me for assistance or advice, and that I ought to spare her a possible disappointment by warning her of <b>my</b> <b>approaching</b> absence from home.

60|$|I {{think that}} I {{should have gone}} crazy but {{for the sound of}} <b>my</b> <b>approaching</b> jailer.

Kill my jailer by a ruse, and trust to fate to lead me to the outer world in safety.|$|R
50|$|If {{you carry}} out the idea of postponing the Leeds Festival till 1881, {{it will be a}} very great relief to me and a weight off my mind, because, in {{consequence}} of <b>my</b> <b>approaching</b> visit to America Gilbert and Sullivan would premiere The Pirates of Penzance, I should have very little time to write for the next six months, and I have been seriously perplexed how to manage it.|$|R
2500|$|He and Chandler {{returned}} to San Francisco {{at the end}} of 1924, and the next month he set up a studio with Hagemeyer. Weston seemed to be struggling with his past and his future during this period. He burned all of his pre-Mexico journals, as though trying to erase the past, and started a new series of nudes with Lerner and with his son Neil. He wrote that these images were [...] "the start of a new period in <b>my</b> <b>approach</b> and attitude towards photography." ...|$|E
2500|$|Shyamalan {{commented on}} the issues {{regarding}} fans' perceptions of the casting {{in an interview with}} Washington Post columnist Jen Chaney, saying, [...] "Anime is based on ambiguous facial features. It's meant to be interpretive. It's meant to be inclusive of all races, and you can see yourself in all these characters...This is a multicultural movie and I'm going to make it even more multicultural in <b>my</b> <b>approach</b> to its casting. There's African-Americans in the movie...so it's a source of pride for me. The irony that [...] would label this with anything but the greatest pride, that the movie poster has Noah and Dev on it and my name on it. I don't know what else to do." [...] In this quote, Shyamalan's reference to Noah Ringer can be explained by Noah's self-identification of his ancestry as [...] "American Indian," [...] although critics of the film's casting have presumed that the actor is simply [...] "white" [...] when making their complaints.|$|E
2500|$|The {{decision}} was made to not use the Cox/Davies script, which gave Gilliam only ten days to write another. Gilliam has stated in an interview [...] "When we were writing the script, we really tried not to invent anything. We sort of cannibalized the book." [...] The director enlisted the help of Tony Grisoni and they wrote the script at Gilliam's home in May 1997. Grisoni remembers, [...] "I'd sit at the keyboard, and we'd talk and talk and I'd keep typing." [...] One of the most important scenes from the book that Gilliam wanted to put in the film was the confrontation between Duke and Dr. Gonzo and the waitress of the North Star Coffee Lounge. The director said, [...] "This is two guys who have gone beyond the pale, this is unforgivable – that scene, it's ugly. <b>My</b> <b>approach,</b> rather than to throw it out, was to make that scene the low point." ...|$|E
60|$|At {{two o'clock}} I descended {{again to the}} breakfast-room, a little anxiously. Expectations of some {{interest}} were connected with <b>my</b> <b>approaching</b> reappearance {{in that part of}} the house. My introduction to Miss Fairlie was now close at hand; and, if Miss Halcombe's search through her mother's letters had produced the result which she anticipated, the time had come for clearing up the mystery of the woman in white.|$|R
60|$|It {{wanted a}} few minutes to noon as I left the room in which the old nobleman was confined, and by the door of which a trooper was stationed, musket on shoulder.

2500|$|In January 2013, Ryan stated, [...] "It's {{going to}} be a CBS procedural. We're going to solve a case every week, but we're going to do it with a lot of humor and a lot of fun. And I would say the stealth thing I would like to get in is, in a day and age when income {{inequality}} and class inequities dominate a lot of the country, this is {{going to be}} an opportunity to put a young working-class kid in Detroit in the middle of Beverly Hills, you can do a lot of stealth social commentary. <b>My</b> <b>approach</b> is to update it and make it feel modern and 2013. The pilot opens with a 4-5 minute sequence which I think is really harrowing and really dangerous, that would be something that you might have seen on Chicago Code or The Shield. I want it to feel grounded in that way. There'll be some opportunities for laughs after that. It's not a laughs come first show." ...|$|E
2500|$|Guan Yu {{claimed he}} had 30,000 troops. He {{selected}} 5,000 elite soldiers, headed to the upstream shallows located some 10 li away from Yiyang, and planned to cross the shallows at night. Lu Su held a discussion with his subordinates {{on how to deal}} with Guan Yu. At the time, Gan Ning had only 300 men under him and he told Lu Su, [...] "If you give me another 500 troops, I'll go to confront Guan Yu. I assure you that Guan Yu will not dare to cross the waters when he hears of <b>my</b> <b>approach.</b> But if he does, I'll capture him." [...] Lu Su then chose 1,000 troops and put them under Gan Ning's command. Gan Ning headed towards Guan Yu's position at night. As Gan Ning expected, Guan Yu did not cross the shallows and instead set up camps there. That place was thus named 'Guan Yu's Shallows' (關羽瀨).|$|E
