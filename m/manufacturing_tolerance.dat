The flow rates of 1565 new nozzles collected on the market from these manufacturers were measured on a device developed for this study.

40|$|Abstract: During {{the design}} of new {{technical}} systems, their <b>manufacturing</b> <b>tolerances</b> (i. e. system parameter uncertainties) should be determined basically by working requirements {{of the system and}} technological possibilities of the manufacturers. Therefore the determination of <b>manufacturing</b> <b>tolerances</b> can be a very important and difficult task. It is possible that system output parameter values are inadequate, but every equipment of the system meets its own requirements, because their <b>manufacturing</b> <b>tolerances</b> (allowable uncertainties) of elements have been determined incorrectly. It is possible too, that the working requirements of the designed system have to determine strictly the system parameter tolerances. For example, these system requirements can be velocity or acceleration of the piston of aircraft hydraulic servo actuator, from the flight mechanical point of view. These external parameters should require very strictly the tolerances of internal parameters of the given system. Using linearized mathematical diagnostic model of the given system, the problems mentioned above can be investigated and solved. This paper will show the methodology of the linearized mathematical-diagnostic model’s usage to investigate effects of manufacturing parameter uncertainties...|$|R

In this topology the inverter performs MPPT for large quantities of solar panels as a whole. Since the solar panels are connected in series to form strings, the same current must flow through all the modules, so the solar inverter continuously adjusts the electric current in the system to find the average optimal working point of all the modules. As a result, potential power may be lost whenever a mismatch exists between modules.23* Panel mismatch is unavoidable in many cases, due to panel <b>manufacturing</b> <b>tolerance,</b> partial shading,4 uneven soiling, or uneven tilt angle.
