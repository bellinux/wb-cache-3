During Chasing Vermeer, Charles Fort's book, Lo!, inspires the {{children}} to list {{and pay attention to}} coincidences as they realize that they are more than what they seem and explore the concept that they make up one unexplained pattern. Balliett stated that she wanted to convey how coincidences were noticeable and felt <b>meaningful,</b> <b>and</b> how they could matter even if they were unexplainable.|$|E
5|$|Peter Donovan criticises the language-games {{approach}} {{for failing to}} recognise that religions operate in a world containing other ideas and that many religious people make claims to truth. He notes that many religious believers not only believe their religion to be <b>meaningful</b> <b>and</b> true in its own context, but claim that it is true against all other possible beliefs; if the language games analogy is accepted, such a comparison between beliefs is impossible. Donovan proposes that debates between different religions, and the apologetics of some, demonstrates that they {{interact with each other}} and the wider world and so cannot be treated as isolated language games.|$|E

25|$|While it is {{possible}} to use the approach above to define -adic numbers and explore their properties, just {{as in the case of}} real numbers other approaches are generally preferred.

25|$|With the {{development}} of statistical techniques and numerical taxonomy in the 1960s, mathematical methods (including Cluster analysis, Principal components analysis, correspondence analysis and Factor analysis) {{have been used to}} build typologies. These techniques provide a qualitative way to articulate the degrees of consistency among particular attributes. Correlation coefficients created by these methods help archaeologists discern between <b>meaningful</b> <b>and</b> useless similarities between artefacts. During the 1990s archaeologists began to use phylogenetic methods borrowed from Cladistics.|$|E
50|$|In 1992, Janoff-Bulman {{delineated}} {{a theory}} of trauma response (Shattered Assumptions Theory). Janoff-Bulman posits that humans have basic assumptions about {{the world in which}} they live, {{based on the belief that}} the world is a benevolent <b>and</b> <b>meaningful</b> place <b>and</b> that the individual has self-worth. These assumptions give the individual the illusion that they have a measure of control on their own lives as well as a feeling of invulnerability. When an individual faces a traumatic event, their deeply held beliefs that the world is a benevolent <b>and</b> <b>meaningful</b> place <b>and</b> that they have a worthy role in that world are shattered. The world is no longer benevolent or predictable.Terror management theory and anxiety buffer disruption theory have taken the concept one step further.|$|R

25|$|To {{illustrate}} this point, Chomsky created the nonsensical sentence in (1), {{which does not}} occur in any corpus, is not <b>meaningful,</b> <b>and</b> is not statistically probable. However, the form of this sentence is judged to be grammatical by many native speakers of English. Such grammaticality judgements {{reflect the fact that}} the structure of sentence (1) obeys the rules of English grammar. This can be seen by comparing sentence (1) with sentence (2). Both sentences have the same structure, and both are grammatically well-formed.|$|E

25|$|Several {{distinct}} sub-regions within Mesoamerica {{are defined}} by a convergence of geographic and cultural attributes. These sub-regions are more conceptual than culturally <b>meaningful,</b> <b>and</b> the demarcation of their limits is not rigid. The Maya area, for example, {{can be divided into}} two general groups: the lowlands and highlands. The lowlands are further divided into the southern and northern Maya lowlands. The southern Maya lowlands are generally regarded as encompassing northern Guatemala, southern Campeche and Quintana Roo in Mexico, and Belize. The northern lowlands cover the remainder of the northern portion of the Yucatán Peninsula. Other areas include Central Mexico, West Mexico, the Gulf Coast Lowlands, Oaxaca, the Southern Pacific Lowlands, and Southeast Mesoamerica (including northern Honduras).|$|E
25|$|The United States Department of Labor {{has sought}} to address {{one of the main}} causes of homelessness, a lack of <b>meaningful</b> <b>and</b> {{sustainable}} employment, through targeted training programs and an increase in access to employment opportunities that can help homeless people to develop sustainable lifestyles.

All individuals who are in need of assistance are able, in theory, to access employment and training services under the Workforce Investment Act (WIA), although this is contingent upon funding and program support by the government, with veterans also being able to use the Veterans Workforce Investment Program.|$|E
