2500|$|Relations between Bahraini Jews and Bahraini Muslims {{are highly}} respected, with Bahrain {{being the only}} state on the Arabian {{peninsula}} {{where there is a}} specific Jewish community. Bahrain is the only Gulf state with two synagogues and two cemetery's next to each other. One member of the community, Rouben Rouben, who sells TV sets, DVD players, copies, fax machines and kitchen appliances from his down-town showroom, said “95 percent of <b>my</b> <b>customers</b> are Bahrainis, and the government is our No. 1 corporate customer. I’ve never felt any kind of discrimination.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Between 2003 and 2004 Massow was {{director}} of another financial adviser firm, this time a tied agent of the Zurich Advice Network (previously Allied Dunbar). Massow had previously campaigned against {{what he saw as}} Allied Dunbar's anti-gay underwriting practices, but he claimed that [...] "they've moved on and, for the sake of <b>my</b> <b>customers,</b> so must I [...] if other gay financial advisers think they're doing the best for their customers by blackballing all the companies that were once out of line (there were about eight of them) when it came to gay issues – then their priorities are very strange. Financial advice is about getting the best product – not petty grudge bearing." [...] Massow accepted a transitional loan of £330,000 to enable office relocation and staff training. However the arrangement was short-lived and ironically ended after a dispute between Massow and Zurich over Zurich's approach to insuring the gay clients in which the firm specialised. A long £13m legal case followed which, ultimately, Massow lost.|$|E

60|$|The case was, to {{a certain}} extent, {{simplified}} now. Either Mr. Davager had ridden out with the letter about him, or he had left it in some safe hiding-place in his room. I suspected it {{to be in his}} room, for a reason that will a little astonish you--his trunk, his dressing-case, and all the drawers and cupboards, were left open. I knew <b>my</b> <b>customer,</b> and I thought this extraordinary carelessness on his part rather suspicious.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, sir,' {{said the}} dealer, 'be it so. You are an old {{customer}} after all; and if, as you say, {{you have the}} chance of a good marriage, far be it from me to be an obstacle. Here is a nice thing for a lady now,' he went on, 'this hand glass--fifteenth century, warranted; comes from a good collection, too; but I reserve the name, in the interests of <b>my</b> <b>customer,</b> who was just like yourself, my dear sir, the nephew and sole heir of a remarkable collector.' ...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: In {{creating}} this piece I wanted to portray an edgy style that pushes {{the envelope and}} strays from the norm. There are many types of women and I feel it is my duty to construct their personalities through the silent yet bold ripples of fabric, giving them the confidence and making them feel unique and audacious. By keeping track of material cost as well as time spent draping, pattern making and sewing the final garment, this dress would sell for $ 225. 00. This allows me to sell a sensibly priced dress while still managing {{to turn a profit}} and making it affordable for clients who want a one of a kind experience in a dress designed for them. Through extensive research and communication with Kristine Eikenbary, head designer of Shimmer formal wear dresses, I began {{creating this}} dress not by sketching but by focusing on who <b>my</b> <b>customer</b> is and what I want to bring to her. While sketching, I took into account <b>my</b> <b>customer</b> and how she behaves, reacts, looks and feels and wanted to create a short and spunky dress adding elements of surprise with every fold and line of the silhouette. This is a daring piece, one with a rock stars’ edge, a sassy confidence, an elegant tone and a feminine touch. This is one of five garments; the entire line can be seen at the Fashion Merchandising spring fashion show, Wild and Free, June 2 nd at 3 pm and 7 pm in Milo Smith Theater in McConnell Hall...|$|R

5000|$|Whatever she's doing, {{running a}} home, a career, entertaining, mothering, traveling, I deeply believe this woman remains an individual. No {{one is going}} to tell her exactly what she has to wear, no matter what's {{currently}} in style. She wants and needs high style, high quality, fashion-conscious clothes that can last for more than one season…. And because I think I have an exceptional ability to anticipate trends, my clothes always have a [...] "today" [...] spirit. I'm constantly refining, improving, interpreting…trying to capture the essence of the times without being trendy. But from whatever source my ideas come from, I always keep in mind that lively, energetic, smart looking woman who is <b>my</b> <b>customer.</b> She's <b>my</b> motivation and my ultimate inspiration.|$|R

But we have tried it and not sold it." [...] However, in November 2016, the company published a photo of a model with a [...] "curvy" [...] physique in Lorna Jane garments on their Instagram feed. The photo quickly garnered 16,000 [...] "likes". The company followed up by inviting consumers to register their interest in Lorna Jane garments [...] "outside of the standard range." ...|$|R

30|$|Thus, the incumbents pre-selected their offers {{prior to}} {{presenting}} them to consumers. This pre-selection occurred {{not only as}} described by physically presenting only certain items but also by arranging catalogues {{that served as the}} basis for assembling the service. Because the strategic pattern was oriented toward satisfying regular customers, such pre-selections were guided by the consideration of whether “this [new service component would] fit with <b>my</b> <b>customer</b> target group” (Expert 12). Thus, strategic premises about consumer needs essentially predetermined which service packages would be offered to consumers. Because of the peculiar situation in which “the [consumers] are frequently […] distressed [and] don’t know what they want” (Expert 6), such pre-selection could essentially guide consumer choice. Accordingly, based on the premise of a low willingness to pay for additional service items or innovative components that would yield higher profit margins, “most [funeral homes] would probably say, ‘I can’t sell [these items]’” (Expert 10), with the consequence that these alternatives were excluded from the scope of action. Such guiding pre-selections generated market outcomes that would not disconfirm strategic premises, although consumers presumably had freedom of choice.|$|R
5000|$|Davies and Son is an {{independent}} tailors on the West side SR, having started in Hanover Street in 1803. It moved to its current location in 1986, making it the oldest independent tailors on Savile Row. The brand incorporates {{a number of other}} tailoring businesses including: Bostridge and Curties and Watson, Fargerstrom and Hughes, Johns and Pegg, James and James, Wells of Mayfair and Fallan & Harvey. It is now owned by Alan Bennett, who stated in an interview: [...] "It's difficult to attract new customers in Savile Row - it isn't generally a case of attracting passing trade. But I realised that by buying into other firms, where the owner might be approaching retirement age, I could add to <b>my</b> <b>customer</b> lists." [...] Davies & Son hold the Royal Warrant as Military Tailors to HRH The Duke of Edinburgh. Other customers have included: Joseph P. Kennedy Sr., Calvin Klein, Prince Michael of Kent, Douglas Fairbanks Jr., Edward Fox, Clark Gable, Benny Goodman, Harry S. Truman and the Duke of Windsor.

5000|$|A {{certain number}} of the polyamory people have gotten on my case about it.
