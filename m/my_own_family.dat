2500|$|She wrote: [...] "Every {{detail of}} my mother's illness {{is still with}} me, {{specially}} her last weeks on earth." [...] She remembered the bedroom scene where her dying mother received the last sacraments while Thérèse knelt and her father cried. She wrote: [...] "When Mummy died, my happy disposition changed. I had been so lively and open; now I became diffident and oversensitive, crying if anyone looked at me. [...] I was only happy if no one took notice of me...

She got her first taste of singing solo at a fire hall, where she soaked up the crowd's appreciation. [...] "Sometimes I think that I cheated <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>family</b> and my closest friends by giving to audiences so much of the love I might have kept for them. But that's the way I was made; I truly don't think I could help it." [...] (p.20) Martin's craft was developed by seeing movies and becoming a mimic. She would win prizes for looking, acting and dancing like Ruby Keeler and singing exactly like Bing Crosby. [...] "Never, never, never can I say I had a frustrating childhood. It was all joy. Mother used to say she never had seen such a happy child—that I awakened each morning with a smile. I don't remember that, but I do remember that I never wanted to go to bed, to go to sleep, for fear I'd miss something." [...] (p.20) ...|$|E

As the central character, Phoutone’s poetic remembrances of {{his commitment to the}} Lao Royal army, displacement from Laos, and resettlement in the United States all serve to consider the complex history of Lao Americans in the geopolitical context of U.

40|$|In {{an effort}} to counter {{orthodox}} masculinity, my work uses ornamentation and the insertion of <b>my</b> <b>own</b> queer body into a hyper masculine context, which will expand existing notions of masculinity, into more inclusive ones. I will discuss issues of acceptance and visibility that affect queer athletes and the greater implications. My thesis exhibition will be completed in two parts: a live performance art piece and a gallery exhibition of sculpture and photography. The artwork has an autobiographical point of departure informed by <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>family's</b> personal mythology surrounding our Scandinavian heritage, while also reflecting on my identity, as a queer, lower class person with a rural Saskatchewan upbringing. I use artwork {{as a tool to}} create discussion and dialogue, which forwards <b>my</b> <b>own</b> agenda of creating more inclusive versions of masculinity. This is significant when looking at the social atmosphere facing queers in North America...|$|R
40|$|A {{personal}} {{journey and}} a scientific challenge, {{this is an}} autoethnographic study about <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>family’s</b> secrecy. I knew my grandfather had been a German prisoner of war during World War II. We all knew. But nobody talked about it. Then one day I decided I wanted to do systematic research {{on the issue of}} family secrecy around my grandfather’s war experiences. Researching one’s <b>own</b> <b>family</b> can be called autoethnography. It could be said that autoethnography is an approach to research that aims to describe and systemically analyze (graphy) personal experience (auto) to understand social and cultural phenomena (ethno). This scientific approach is quite new in the field of family therapy. This study has been an important personal quest, but it also led to important reflections on silences in <b>families,</b> on <b>my</b> <b>own</b> professional development, and on methodological issues concerning autoethnographical research. For one thing, it highlights some of the positive aspects of family secrecy and silences, and invites us—when confronted with family secrecy in clinical practice—to carefully consider the potential destructive and life-giving aspects of the silence. status: accepte...|$|R

40|$|The {{completion}} of this dissertation {{would have been}} impossible, {{had it not been}} for the support of several individuals and institutions. These include first of all my advisor, Professor William P.

I am grateful to the past and present chairs of the Comparative Literature Program at Vanderbilt University, Professors Margaret A. Doody and Earl. E Fitz, for allowing me the necessary time and leeway to pursue my area of interest; likewise to the deans of the Vanderbilt Graduate School, especially Associate Dean Richard L. Hoover, for granting me several extensions, without which I would not have been able to finish my thesis. I likewise wish to thank Brigham Young University Idaho, my former employer, for a one-semester leave in 2001 that made it possible for me to do essential research in Germany. I also wish to thank my wifes and <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>families</b> for their moral and even material support. And finally, and most importantly, I wish to acknowledge the enduring love and loyalty of my wife Caroline and our three beautiful sons, David, Benjamin, and Max. The boys cannot remember a time when Dad was not working on his dissertation. The last six years were often difficult, at times even painful...|$|R

[...] Holliday admits that she {{did not know how to}} handle the logistics of the project, was unable to keep up with orders, and takes responsibility for some customers not receiving the merchandise they paid for. [...] "The system we were using just didn't work," [...] she said, attributing missing merchandise to [...] "one big batch that was lost by the post office" [...] and [...] "usual business discrepancies". She was unable to make the charity donation after paying [...] "thousands and thousands of dollars" [...] out of pocket to a shipping and distribution center to ensure issues with merchandise would be resolved, which [...] "ate up what little was left of the profits".

60|$|Although the {{statement}} may appear somewhat superfluous {{to those who}} know me, {{it may not be}} out of place to add, in conclusion, that these stories are entirely of <b>my</b> <b>own</b> imagining, constructing, and writing. The fact that the events of some of my tales occur on foreign ground, and are acted out by foreign personages, appears to have suggested in some quarters the inference that the stories themselves might be of foreign origin. Let me, once for all, assure any readers who may honor me with their attention, that in this, and in all other cases, they may depend on the genuineness of my literary offspring. The little children of my brain may be weakly enough, and may be sadly in want of a helping hand to aid them in their first attempts at walking on the stage of this great world; but, at any rate, they are not borrowed children. The members of <b>my</b> <b>own</b> literary <b>family</b> are indeed increasing so fast as to render the very idea of borrowing quite out of the question, and to suggest serious apprehension that I may not have done adding to the large book-population, on <b>my</b> <b>own</b> sole responsibility, even yet.|$|R
