No, I don't have any regrets about my part in {{the invention of the}} airplane, though no one could deplore <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> the destruction it has caused. I feel about the airplane much the same as I do in regard to fire. That is, I regret all the terrible damage caused by fire, but I think it is good for the human race that someone discovered how to start fires and that we have learned how to put fire to thousands of important uses." ...|$|E
500|$|In the Georgia game Bomar had a brain {{hemorrhage}} {{after he}} was kicked in the chin, and half his body was paralyzed for two days. It was thought {{that he would never}} play football again: [...] "Not a player on the team could talk of Bomar's injury without tears coming to his eyes", and Bomar sat on the bench {{for the rest of the}} season's games. Known as a devastating blocker and [...] "lightning fast," [...] he was the first Commodore football player elected to the College Football Hall of Fame in 1956. At his induction Bomar said, [...] "I just wish all the men who played with me at Vanderbilt between 1921 and 1924 could also receive this coveted award. They deserve it <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>do.</b> After all, they made it possible for me to be chosen." ...|$|E
2500|$|Guicciardini served three popes over {{a period}} of twenty years, and perhaps because of his experiences, he was highly {{critical}} of the papacy: [...] "I don't know anyone who dislikes the ambition, the avarice, and the sensuality of priests <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>do....</b> Nevertheless, the position I have enjoyed with several popes has forced me to love their greatness for my own self-interest. If it weren't for this consideration, I would have loved Martin Luther as much as I love myself—not to be released from the laws taught by the Christian religion as it is normally interpreted and understood, but to see this band of ruffians reduced within their correct bounds." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Upon my word, Mrs. Greene, I must deny that," [...] said I, jumping up. [...] "What {{on earth}} could <b>I</b> have <b>done</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>do?</b> <b>I</b> {{have been to}} Milan and nearly fagged myself to death." ...|$|R
60|$|Mackintosh is, it seems, {{the writer}} of the {{defensive}} letter in the Morning Chronicle. If so, it is very kind, and <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> for myself.|$|R
2500|$|Denver Post {{contributor}} Joanne Ostrow {{declared the}} protagonist of the series a [...] "female answer to SpongeBob SquarePants". Among the favorable reception was a mixed review from Common Sense Medias Emily Ashby. She said while it [...] "maintains a chaotic pace, {{and there are no}} real attempts to teach strong positive lessons [...] Young tweens will likely enjoy Bessie's outlandish, fantasy-fueled adventures– which are fast-paced and, on the surface, entertaining." [...] Ed Liu of Toon Zone called The Mighty B! a show that he admires more than what he [...] "truly love", stating: [...] "There is prodigious talent behind it and its wonderfully energetic, boisterous comedy. It's clearly trying very, very hard to be entertaining and largely succeeds [...] I almost feel bad for not liking The Mighty B! <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>do,</b> and I'm still not sure why I don't enjoy it more". He noted it was worth pointing out that more recent episodes of the show seem [...] "more assured and funnier" [...] than the eight episodes on the We Got the Bee DVD.|$|E
2500|$|Philadelphia Aug. 30. 1791.Sir,I {{thank you}} {{sincerely}} for your {{letter of the}} 19th. instant and for the Almanac it contained. no body wishes <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> to see such proofs as you exhibit, that nature has given to our black brethren, talents equal {{to those of the}} other colours of men, & that the appearance of a want of them is owing merely to the degraded condition of their existence both in Africa & America. I can add with truth that no body wishes more ardently to see a good system commenced for raising the condition both of their body & mind to what it ought to be, as fast as the imbecillity of their present existence, and other circumstance which cannot be neglected, will admit. I have taken the liberty of sending your almanac to Monsieur de Condorcet, Secretary of the Academy of sciences at Paris, and member of the Philanthropic society because I considered it as a document to which your whole colour had a right for their justification against the doubts which have been entertained of them. I am with great esteem, Sir,Your most obedt. humble servt.Th. Jefferson ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'That I don't know {{anything}} about,' she stammered. 'But Cytherea didn't, of course, dream any <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>did,</b> or {{others in the}} parish, that he was married.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I wanted Lawrence <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> the others," [...] grumbled Jason Sparr. He {{was doing}} some deep {{thinking}} and his face showed that he was much disturbed.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm {{not talking}} of lawyers," [...] said Anko reprovingly. [...] "I'm {{talking about my}} pain. I don't imagine anyone could suffer <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> with that stomach ache." ...|$|R
60|$|DAISY. You needn't {{hesitate}} {{to say anything}} about the Eurasians. You can't hate and despise them <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>do.</b>|$|E

60|$|CAESAR. You {{have been}} growing up since the Sphinx {{introduced}} us the other night; {{and you think you}} know <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> already.|$|E
6000|$|I fancied Boone saw {{the drift}} of this, which was <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>did,</b> and the farmer nodded oracularly in his {{direction}} when I asked: [...] "What did you do instead?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ask him!" [...] said Aylward modestly, nodding towards Black Simon. [...] "He saw <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>did.</b> And yet, by {{the holy}} nails! there was not very much that <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not see either." ...|$|R
60|$|DAISY. I? I've {{been happy}} {{for the first time}} in my life. At last I've known peace and rest. Oh, George, I'm so {{grateful}} for all you've given me! In these three months you've changed the whole world for me. I thought I couldn't love you <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>did.</b> <b>I</b> think every day my love grows more consuming.|$|R
6000|$|... "What bribe have I {{to offer}} you?" [...] Duncombe asked. [...] "Information? You know <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>do.</b> I am afraid {{you have been}} misled." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Sure," [...] {{chimed in}} Grierson, who was frightened, [...] "that's right, Hugh. I didn't mean anything. Nobody appreciates you <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>do,</b> old man." ...|$|E
6000|$|Jess laughed, and answered, [...] "Jantje {{does not}} like Frank Muller any <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>do,</b> but I don't know why. He will never tell me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But I've {{had to let}} {{out every}} one of my dresses AGAIN. I weigh four pounds <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> in July. Anne, WHERE will this end? Mrs. Morgan's heroines are all tall and slender." ...|$|R
60|$|Here {{she lived}} for about seven years, {{and the old}} gentleman, when she died, wept over her grave a great deal <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>did,</b> who was then too young to mind {{anything}} but toys or sweetmeats.|$|R
6000|$|... "For you--very little. I wonder. For me--every thing. Yes--everything. You didn't mean it, Master; you didn't {{know any}} <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> when <b>I</b> began, but love {{between a man}} and a woman is {{sometimes}} very one-sided. Fearfully one-sided! That's all...." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, Janet," [...] {{the guest}} may say (for he enjoys her {{interference}} <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>do),</b> [...] "you make him so comfortable that you spoil him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes, it's pretty fresh,' assented Pancks. 'As a {{stranger}} {{you feel the}} climate <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>do,</b> I dare say. Indeed I haven't got time to feel it.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't say that, my son--it must {{be through}} a better Friend than I am-- who loves you <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>do.</b> I have not died for you--He did." ...|$|E
5000|$|A notable {{departure}} from the positive reception was Michael Kinsley's review in the Times itself. He noted: [...] "Having seen Page One, I don’t know much <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> before. The movie, directed by Andrew Rossi, is, in a word, a mess." ...|$|R
6000|$|We were disappointed, {{and felt}} {{that we could not}} attain to the {{feelings}} in the Confirmation poem in the Christian Year--Mr. Castleford's gift to me. Still, I believe that, though encumbered with such a drag as myself, Clarence, <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>did,</b> ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Very well," [...] said Hans, [...] "if ye {{will have}} it, I will {{tell it to}} you; but, after all, it is not better than my own story, and the poor man in the end gets no <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> in my bargains." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I guess I could, if I wasn't {{afraid of}} uncle. He knows so much <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>do,</b> he'd laugh," [...] began Geordie, evidently {{puzzled by the}} question.|$|E
6000|$|... "What business?" [...] asked Sir Henry sharply. [...] "It {{seems to}} me that all you gentlemen know a great deal <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> about my own affairs." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He knows <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>do,</b> then. He {{knows more}} than I ever shall know. Ada, {{you should not}} have said so. It {{will have to be}} all unsaid." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, dear blessed sir, and {{you will}} send Sir John to pray with me? For I turned, sir, I turned: but I could not help it--I could not abear the torments: but she bore them, sweet angel--and <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>did.</b> Oh, dear me!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I say, that isn't fair, mother! Neither of {{them was}} new, and the boy needed the best <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>did,</b> and <b>I</b> wore the old one all winter, didn't I?" [...] asked Jack, who had rather exulted over Frank, and was now taken down himself.|$|R
6000|$|... "No man's {{principles}} {{can remain}} stable in an unstable world," [...] Miller pronounced. [...] "I still detest force and compulsion of every sort, but I recognise its necessity in our present civil life far <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> {{in a war}} which was, after all, a war of politicians." ...|$|R
