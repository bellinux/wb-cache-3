Time:APR 26 - 29, 2010. Any {{kinds of}} tiny {{vibration}} of machine tool parts {{will have a}} great influence on surface quality of the workpiece at ultra-precise machining process of aspheric surface. At present the major way for decreasing influence of vibration is machining compensation technology. Therefore {{it is important for}} machining compensation control to acquire and transmit these vibration signals effectively. This paper presents a vibration monitoring system of aspheric surface <b>machining</b> <b>machine</b> tool based on wireless sensor networks (WSN). Some key issues of wireless sensor networks for vibration monitoring system of aspheric surface machining are discussed. The reliability of data transmission, network communication protocol and synchronization mechanism of wireless sensor networks are studied for the vibration monitoring system. The proposed system achieves multi-sensors vibration monitoring involving the grinding wheel, the workpiece and the workbench spindle. The wireless transmission of vibration signals is achieved by the combination with vibration sensor nodes and wireless network. In this paper, these vibration sensor nodes are developed. An experimental platform is structured which employs wireless sensor networks to the vibration monitoring system in order to test acquisition and wireless transmission of vibration signal. The test results show that the proposed system can achieve vibration data transmission effectively and reliability and meet the monitoring requirements of aspheric surface <b>machining</b> <b>machine</b> tool...|$|E

40|$|International audienceOur {{two major}} concerns, {{which should be}} taken into {{consideration}} as soon as we start the selecting the machining parameters, are the minimization of the machining time and the maintaining of the high-speed <b>machining</b> <b>machine</b> in good state. The manufacturing strategy is one of the parameters which practically influences the time of the different geometrical forms manufacturing, as well as the machine itself. In this article, we propose an optimization methodology of the machining strategy for pockets of complex forms. For doing this, we have developed analytic models expressing the feed rate of the cutting tools trajectory. Then, we have elaborated an optimization method based on the analysis of the different critical parameters so as to distinguish the most suitable strategies to calculate the cutting time and define the machine dynamics. To validate our results, we have compared them to the experimental ones and also to those found in literature...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. With the {{development}} of the CNC precision machining and the ultra-precision <b>machining,</b> <b>machine</b> tools error issue has became the most active research topics and concerned by more and more experts. In this paper, a rapid simulation software platform based on multi-body system theory and Matlab software for measurement and analysis geometric errors of CNC machine tool is presented, which includes the generation of simulated measurement data, data processing, error separation and error compensation etc. To verify the feasibility of the developed software, the sequential step diagonal vector measurement method has been analyzed. The experimental results show that after error compensation the machine performance is improved by 39 %. It demonstrates that the sequential step diagonal vector measurement method could significantly improve the machine accuracy and the developed software platform is reliable. This platform is not only effective for step diagonal vector measurement method, but also can be applied to other measurements. Therefore, the software platform provides a fast, reliable and objective tool for machine error measurement and analysis...|$|E

In this research, thermoplastic elastomer (TPE) is used, TPE is a class of copolymers or a physical mix of polymers usually a plastic and a rubber which consist of materials with both thermoplastic and elastomeric properties.

The virgin TPE come from raw material of TPE in the resin form whereas the recycled TPE come from injection moulded virgin dog-bone shape specimens that have been crushed by using crusher machine. After that, recycled TPE and virgin TPE are then mixed according to the desired mixing ratio and injection moulded by using injection moulding machine. Then, the specimens undergo tensile strength test by using universal testing machine in order to determine which mixing ratio produce highest tensile strength. As a result, the mixing ratio that produce highest tensile strength is 100 % virgin TPE and the second highest is 100 % recycled TPE. This is due to the ability of material mix together and produces strong bonding within each other...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: The paper {{presents}} the electronic catalogs for selection of tools and cutting conditions, their advantages and disadvantages. The tool makers most frequently offer {{the data on}} their tools and the relevant cutting conditions {{in the form of}} catalogs. Recently the data on the tool of the individual makers on compact discs have appeared. Electronic catalogs of tools contain the data on the tools of different makers. The further development is so oriented that the tool user will obtain all the necessary information through Internet. The Internet can be efficiently used in modernly organized computer-supported system for tool management. Design/methodology/approach: A home page has been made that contains the interconnections to web pages of the cutting tool makers and to some catalogs for selection of cutting tools, accessible through Internet. It is accessible on the server of the Laboratory for cutting at the Faculty of mechanical engineering in Maribor under the URL address: [URL] The contribution proposes an expert system for optimization of cutting parameters from commercial data bases. Research limitations/implications: The OPTIS expert system serves for optimization of cutting conditions with respect to minimizing the manufacturing costs by taking into account the cutting process limitations. The programme is applicable only for turning. Practical implications: The OPTIS selects optimal cutting conditions with respect to the tool maker, workpiece material, type of <b>machining,</b> <b>machine,</b> smallest and greatest cutting conditions, tool, data on series, type of clamping and workpiece geometry.
