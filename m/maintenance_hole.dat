The liner within a bore tube is designed to remove the radiated power and the photodesorbed gas that impair the beam tube vacuum. The bimetallic liner tube is subjected to cooldown and eddy current loads. The square liner tube is a two-shell laminated Nitronic- 40 steel is used for strength and a copper inner layer for low impedance to the image currents. Perforated holes are used to remove the photodesorbed gases for vacuum <b>maintenance.</b> The <b>holes</b> are located in a low-stress area of the liner. Rectangular holes in a four-pole symmetry pattern are required for beam dynamic stability. The liner is conductivity cooled by the round steel bore tube with a 2 -mm wall. The copper layer must not be stressed over the yield strength limit because copper properties such as conductivity are known to change when the copper is stressed over yield strength. This analysis will address liner system response under thermal, eddy current, and vaporized liquid helium loads in a quenching dipole magnet...|$|R
40|$|The TEA-CO_ 2 lasers {{will not}} be an {{alternative}} to UV excimer lasers for the precise drilling of small holes in polyethylen and polypropylene. Drilling with TEA-CO_ 2 lasers leads to substantial melting of the materials in typ. 300 #mu#m depth. Line-tuning to specific absorption peaks shows no improvement in edge quality. A calculation of the costs for the drilling of catheters by excimer lasers clearly demonstrates the competitiveness of the laser process. Included are investment cost, running costs and <b>maintenance.</b> Small <b>holes</b> in diamonds e. g. for drawing dies can be drilled very precisely by UV-radiation. Comparing excimer lasers of 193 and 248 nm with a frequency-tripled Nd:YAG laser (355 nm) leads to different drilling rates, but nearly the same wall angles, where the wall angles depend on the fluences and the resolution of the focussing optics. The shape of the drill holes is very reproducible up to a certain aspect ratio (depth/diameter). From the experimental results a simple model is developed, which depicts the allowable aspect ratio and the corresponding wall angle in a process diagram. (orig.)

40|$|The Arctic {{stratosphere}} {{throughout the}} late winter and early spring of 2011 {{was characterized by}} an unusually severe ozone loss, resulting {{in what has been}} described as an ozone hole. The 2011 ozone loss was made possible by unusually cold temperatures throughout the Arctic stratosphere. Here we consider the issue of what constitutes suitable environmental conditions for the formation and maintenance of a polar ozone hole. Our discussion focuses on the importance of the stratospheric wind field and, in particular, the importance of a high latitude zonal jet, which serves as a meridional transport barrier both prior to ozone hole formation and during the ozone <b>hole</b> <b>maintenance</b> phase. It is argued that stratospheric conditions in the boreal winter/spring of 2011 were highly unusual inasmuch as in that year Antarctic-like Lagrangian dynamics {{led to the formation of}} a boreal ozone hole...|$|R
40|$|The {{importance}} of sustainable financial management {{of water and}} wastewater pipeline infrastructure has grown in recent years due to the increasing backlog of maintenance, renewal and replacement of aging water and wastewater infrastructure. As the water and wastewater infrastructure age, {{the condition of the}} water and wastewater infrastructure will continue to deteriorate increasing the cost for renewal and replacement. In response to the aging and deteriorating potable water and wastewater infrastructure Public Sector Accounting Board PS 3150 and Regulation 453 / 07 under the Ontario Safe Drinking Water Act were established. PS 3150 requires local governments to report their tangible capital assets along with their depreciation on financial statements. One key component of this reporting is determining the need for and cost of the replacement of these assets. Ontario Regulation 453 / 07 requires public utilities to prepare and submit long term financial plans for water systems. One key principle of the financial plans is that the expenses of operating water systems should be paid by revenues generated from providing the water systems. A crucial aspect of PS 3150, Ontario regulation 453 / 07 and the financial management of water and wastewater infrastructure are accurate estimates of future capital works construction prices. Historically, construction indices are used to forecast construction prices. Engineering New Record (ENR) Construction Cost Index (CCI), Federal Highway Administration (FWHA) composite National Highway Construction Cost Index (NHCCI) and Consumer Price Index (CPI) have been used to estimate future construction prices of water and wastewater infrastructure in Canada. However, these indices do not accurately represent the circumstance of the water and wastewater infrastructure construction sector, which can lead to errors and inaccuracies in construction price forecasts. It is recommended sector specific construction indices be used to forecast construction prices. However, there are few construction indices available for the water and wastewater infrastructure sector and available indices are not based on actual construction data. This thesis presents a methodology to accurately estimate future construction prices for water and wastewater pipeline capital works based on actual construction price data. The methodology contains three components: construction data processing, development of unit price indices for watermain and sanitary sewer construction, and estimation of inflation in watermain and sanitary sewer construction. The data processing component cleans and transforms actual construction price data from the City of Niagara Falls from 1981 to 2014 into a centralized, organized and auditable construction price dataset. Based on the construction price dataset, unit price indices specific to the watermain and sanitary sewer construction sector were developed. Unit price indices were developed and calculated for watermain projects, pipes, valves, and hydrants, and sanitary sewer projects, pipes, and maintenance holes. Geometric Brownian Motion was used to estimate inflation in and forecast future construction prices for watermain and sanitary sewer capital works construction based on the developed unit price indices. A Microsoft Access relational database containing the data processing function, calculation of watermain and sanitary sewer unit price indices, and estimation of inflation was developed to improve the accuracy, efficiency and consistency of the methodology. Additionally, the methodology allows contractor markup in watermain and sanitary sewer construction and factors influencing watermain and sanitary sewer unit price indices to be examined. The inflation of watermain reference project construction is 5. 79 % per annum from 1982 - 2014, while the inflation of sanitary sewer reference project capital works construction is 4. 66 % per annum from 1981 - 2014. The inflation rates of watermain pipe, valve and hydrant construction from 1982 - 2014 are 6. 36 %, 5. 09 %, and 2. 81 % per annum, respectively. The inflation rates of sanitary sewer pipe and <b>maintenance</b> <b>hole</b> construction from 1981 - 2014 are 7. 41 % and 5. 25 % per annum, respectively. Inflation of watermain and sanitary sewer reference projects is above inflation of CPI, NRBCPI and LDCCT at 2. 25 %, 3. 17 % and 3. 77 % per annum, respectively, but below inflation of S&P/TSX composite index at 6. 90 % per annum. This indicates when forecasting future prices within a construction sector, the use of a proxy index will result in inaccurate estimates of future construction prices. In the water and wastewater pipeline construction sector the use of CPI, NRBCPI or LDCCT will result in significant underestimation of future construction prices. To obtain accurate estimates of future construction prices it is important to use sector specific indices which the developed unit price indices represent for the water and wastewater pipeline construction sector. In this thesis contractor markup is defined as a financial premium in excess of market inflation {{in the form of a}} per annum interest rate surcharge. Contractor markup includes risk premiums, overhead and profit. The contractor markups for watermain and sanitary sewer projects are 3. 54 % and 2. 41 %, respectively. As the number of tender bids submitted for a project increase, the unit price of reference projects generally decreases. This is caused by an increase in the competition among contractors resulting in a decrease in the unit prices of the reference projects as bidders attempt to win the project. The Infrastructure Stimulus Fund increased the total number of projects and the total value of projects in 2009 and 2010 but did not significantly alter the watermain and sanitary sewer unit price indices...|$|E
40|$|International audienceNowadays, {{the rapidly}} {{developed}} Internet of Things require the ability handling information efficiently {{to deal with}} the intelligent applications. Wireless sensor networks (WSNs), which act as an important interface between physical environment and Internet of Things, have been applied in numerous applications. As a kind of important application of WSNs, the continuous objects boundary detection is popular in industry. However, the long-term maintenance for the traditional WSNs, which are used to monitor the leakage of continuous objects, is expensive. Thus, we use sparse WSNs to address this issue. But, the inaccuracy of the sparse network is a big problem while the information of continuous objects is used to arrange retreat path for people. To access this problem, we propose our mechanism which used hybrid network to compromise the accuracy and cost of <b>maintenance.</b> The sensing <b>holes</b> will be detected by using Voronoi diagram, before the network starts to work. After the static sensor nodes get the value of the toxic air, the mechanism can calculate the high variation location, which give weights to the sensing holes, in the static sensor networks. Thus, the sensing holes which selected by both spatial and data variation factors will be list in a target nodes list for the mobile sensor node. Finally, the optimal path considering both distance and priority for the mobile sensor will be plan out. Experimental evaluation shows that there is an optimal amount of the static nodes decided by the sensing radius and the size of area. And it reduces the energy consumption by the static networks...|$|R
