40|$|This paper aims at drawing new {{guidelines}} for investigation of <b>monetary</b> hyperinflation <b>analysis.</b> We propose a MIUF optimizing model {{and show that}} monetary hyperinflation can occur as a perfect foresight competitive equilibrium path only when money is essential {{in the sense of}} Scheinkman (1980). This result emerges without any ad-hoc assumption implying the inclusion of friction in the adjustment of some nominal variable. It suggests that <b>monetary</b> hyperinflation <b>analysis</b> under perfect foresight requires abandoning the Cagan money demand and adopting a demand for money respecting money essentiality. monetary hyperinflation, seigniorage, inflation tax, money essentiality. ...|$|R

40|$|In this article, we {{investigate}} the possible time-varying structure of DSGE models. We follow {{the study of}} Andrle et al. (2009), which argues that models designed for <b>monetary</b> policy <b>analysis</b> and forecasting of {{an economy that is}} undergoing structural changes must include exogenous processes (technologies) capturing the specific characteristics of in-dividual sectors. We conclude that the presence of structural changes and the conver-gence process in the data imply drifting of structural parameters in the model without technologies. Incorporating technologies causes the structural parameters to be relatively stable. From the perspective of <b>monetary</b> policy <b>analysis</b> and forecasting, it seems more convenient to assume that the structural parameters are stable and use sectoral tech-nologies owing to their aggregate form. 1...|$|R

40|$|This paper applies a new Bayesian {{framework}} {{laid out}} in Faust and Gupta (2009) for evaluating the suitability of dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) models for the task of <b>monetary</b> policy <b>analysis.</b> The paper characterizes practical <b>monetary</b> policy <b>analysis</b> as determining how intended policy should be revised {{in light of the}} structural interpretation of incoming news. The news is defined as the one-step ahead forecast errors and the first and second moments of this news sufficiently summarize its structure for the purposes of <b>monetary</b> policy <b>analysis.</b> To shed light on the structural implications of this news, the paper estimates the implied structural shocks from fitting the DSGE model of Smets and Wouters (2007) to data. These fitted shocks then provide a structural interpretation for the observed news. The paper then evaluates the first and second moments of both the forecast errors and structural shocks, finding strengths of the model and important shortcomings. The paper finds that the posterior distribution for the realized value of the mean and cross-correlations of the structural shocks are typically nonzero. This result is surprising because structural shocks by construction are supposed to be zero-mean and uncorrelated. The results, therefore, identify specific frictions and structural aspects of the model that cause misspecification and suggest areas of improvement for model building...|$|R

40|$|Structural {{models are}} a {{powerful}} tool for business cycle and <b>monetary</b> policy <b>analysis</b> because they are assumed to be invariant to either policy changes or external shocks. In this paper, we derive a neoclassical monetary model in which both the demand and supply side are structural {{in the sense that the}} behavioral equations obtained are rigorously calculated from optimizing decisions of the individuals. Moreover, we introduce price stickiness on the supply side decisions so as to have relevant short-run real effects of monetary policy through the real interest rate channel. The resulting medium-size model will be calibrated and estimated for the euro area economies. As two examples of the applications of the model for the euro area, some simulations on business cycle and <b>monetary</b> policy <b>analysis</b> will be carried out.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we provide {{international}} {{evidence on the}} issue of whether the optimizing IS equation is more stable than a backward-looking alternative. The international evidence consist of estimates of IS equations on quarterly data for the UK and Australia, both for the full sample of the last 40 years and for the period following major monetary policy shifts in 1979 - 80. Our results suggest that the parameters in the optimizing IS equations are more empirically stable than those of the backward-looking alternative.

40|$|In the data, prices change both {{temporarily}} and permanently. Standard Calvo models {{focus on}} permanent price changes and {{take one of}} two shortcuts when confronted with the data: drop temporary changes from the data or leave them in and treat them as permanent. We provide a menu cost model that includes motives for both types of price changes. Since this model accounts for the main regularities of price changes, its predictions for the real effects of monetary policy shocks are useful benchmarks against which to judge existing shortcuts. We find that neither shortcut comes close to these benchmarks. For <b>monetary</b> policy <b>analysis,</b> researchers should use a menu cost model like ours {{or at least a}} third, theory-based shortcut: set the Calvo model's parameters so that it generates the same real effects from monetary shocks as does the benchmark menu cost model.
