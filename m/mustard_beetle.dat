40|$|ABSTRACT. Bioassay guided chromatographic {{separation}} of a methanolic extract of Agauria salicifollia led to to {{the isolation of}} Acetylmoraldehyde (1) and Aguariasterone (2), whose structures were elucidated using UV, IR, NMR and melting points. Insecticidal activity was done using adult Phaedon cochleariae (<b>Mustard</b> <b>beetle)</b> at 1, 0. 1, 0. 01 % concentration of 1. 00 µg dose per insect of the compound. The compound 1 and 2 {{were found to be}} active with LD 50 values of 0. 04 and 0. 15 µg/insect respectively...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{investigations of}} the insecticidal compounds of three Sri Lankan plants, Pleurostylia opposita (Wall) Alston (Celastraceae), Aegle marmelos Correa (Rutaceae) and Excoecaria agallocha Linn. (Euphorbiaceae). After establishing the insecticidal activity of the extracts of three plants, separation of compounds was achieved by bio-assay directed chromatography, and the compounds were characterised by NMR especially 2 D experiments, mass, UV and IR spectroscopy. Three new macrocyclic sesquiterpene polyol ester alkaloids 1, 2 and 3 containing a novel 6, 7 ring skeleton have been identified from the petroleum ether-ethyl acetate extract of the stem bark of Pleurstylia opposita. They are homologues of known macrocyclic sesquiterpene alkaloids which contains a 6, 6 ring system based on the ß-dihydroagarofuran core. The extra methylene has been shown by NMR {{to be in the}} 8 position of the 6, 7 ring. Observation of insecticidal activity in the Pleurostylia genus is novel. The previously reported 20 -hydroxylupane- 3 - one has also been identified from the active extract and shown to be noninsecticidal. Two new insecticidal compounds 6 and 7 have been identified from the petroleum ether-ethyl acetate extract of the stem bark of Aegle marmelos. They are shown to be protolimonoids, and are senecioate ester analogues of the known isovalerate esters of C- 21 -ß and C- 21 -α glabretal which were also isolated. Compounds 8 and 9 were also found to be insecticidal against <b>mustard</b> <b>beetles</b> and houseflies. Separation and characterisation of epimeric mixtures were first achieved for the di p-nitrobenzoate derivative. Previously recorded epoxyaurapten, marmesin, marmin and lupeol have been isolated from the active extract of Aegle marmelos and shown to be noninsecticidal. Five compounds 24 - 28 have been isolated from the ethyl acetate extract of the stem bark of Excoecaria agallocha. They all have the previously reported daphnane diterpenoid orthoester skeleton, and differ only in the orthoester alkyl side chain. Two of them 24 and 27 are novel. Insecticidal activity has not been recorded previously for extracts of Excoecaria species, nor for the daphnane orthoesters...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Specificity {{of plant}} {{induction}} responses {{may be important}} to the interactions between mustards and insect herbivores. This study compared {{the effects of the}} cabbage white butterfly, Pieris rapae (L.), cabbage looper, Trichoplusia ni (Hubner), and the <b>mustard</b> flea <b>beetle,</b> Phyllotreta cruciferae (Goeze) on induction of leaf trichome density, sinigrin concentration, and nitro-gen concentration in black mustard, Brassica nigra (L.) Koch. Plants were damaged for 12 h at the four-leaf stage, with effort made to standardize the damage applied. Induction responses were measured on the fifth, seventh, ninth, and 11 th leaves counted from the cotyle-dons. Seventh leaves of plants damaged by P. rapae had 76 % more trichomes per unit area than controls, whereas equivalent leaves of plants damaged by the other two herbivores exhibited no response. Ninth leaves of plants damaged by T. ni had 113 % more trichomes per unit area than controls, whereas equivalent leaves of plants damaged by the other two herbivores exhibited no response. Trichome densities of fifth and 11 th leaves did not respond to treatments. Leaf sinigrin and nitrogen concentrations were not affected by the damage treat-ments. Differential plant trichome response to P. rapae and T. ni may have been due to differences in location of feeding during the damage treatment. Other cues, such as salivary components, may also have differed between the two herbivores. This study {{is one of the first}} to document differential effects of two herbivores from the same guild on induction of morphological resistance...|$|R
40|$|Oligophagous herbivores must {{adjust their}} enzymatic {{machinery}} {{to the different}} host plant species they consume. If different hosts are used {{from one generation to}} the next, adaptation may be highly plastic, while if a single host is used over several generations there may be a longer-term response due to natural selection. Using an experimental evolutionary approach, we investigated effects of long-term experience versus short-term responses to different host plants in the oligophagous <b>mustard</b> leaf <b>beetle</b> Phaedon cochleariae. After 26 generations of continuous feeding on either Brassica rapa, Nasturtium officinale or Sinapis alba, freshly hatched larvae were kept on these plants or moved to one of the other host plants for ten days. Global transcriptional patterns as shown by microarrays revealed that between 1 % and 16. 1 % of all 25, 227 putative genes were differentially expressed in these treatments in comparison to the control line constantly feeding on B. rapa. A shift back from S. alba to B. rapa caused the largest changes in gene transcription and may thus represent the harshest conditions. Infection rates with a gregarine parasite were intermediate in all lines that were constantly kept on one host, but much lower or higher when short-term shifts to other host plants occurred. In conclusion, transcriptional plasticity in genes related to metabolism, digestion and general cellular processes plays a key role in long- and short-term responses of the beetle to changing host plant conditions, whereby the specific conditions also affect the interactions between the beetle host and its gregarine parasite...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Phytophagous insects {{have emerged}} {{successfully}} {{on the planet}} {{also because of the}} development of diverse and often astonishing defensive strategies against their enemies. The larvae of the <b>mustard</b> leaf <b>beetle</b> Phaedon cochleariae, for example, secrete deterrents from specialized defensive glands on their back. The secretion process involves ATP-binding cassette transporters. Therefore, sugar as one of the major energy sources to fuel the ATP synthesis for the cellular metabolism and transport processes, has to be present in the defensive glands. However, the role of sugar transporters for the production of defensive secretions was not addressed until now. RESULTS: To identify sugar transporters in P. cochleariae, a transcript catalogue was created by Illumina sequencing of cDNA libraries. A total of 68, 667 transcripts were identified and 68 proteins were annotated as either members of the solute carrier 2 (SLC 2) family or trehalose transporters. Phylogenetic analyses revealed an extension of the mammalian GLUT 6 / 8 class in insects as well as one group of transporters exhibiting distinctive conserved motifs only present in the insect order Coleoptera. RNA-seq data of samples derived from the defensive glands revealed six transcripts encoding sugar transporters with more than 3, 000 counts. Two of them are exclusively expressed in the glandular tissue. Reduction in secretions production was accomplished by silencing two of four selected transporters. RNA-seq experiments of transporter-silenced larvae showed the down-regulation of the silenced transporter but concurrently the up-regulation of other SLC 2 transporters suggesting an adaptive system to maintain sugar homeostasis in the defensive glands. CONCLUSION: We provide the first comprehensive phylogenetic study of the SLC 2 family in a phytophagous beetle species. RNAi and RNA-seq experiments underline the importance of SLC 2 transporters in defensive glands to achieve a chemical defense for successful competitive interaction in natural ecosystems...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{determine}} the impact of accompanying plants: sweet alyssum (Lobularia maritima L.) and white mustard (Synapis alba L.), on the incidence of pests of the broad bean (Vicia faba L.) variety Bartek, in the intercropping system. The observations of the number of the beetles of Bruchus rufimanus Boh. and Sitona spp were made. The broad bean was grown along with two other plants in varying spacing (the distances between rows were 50, 65 and 80 cm) and in homogeneous cultivation (the distances between rows were 50 cm). Broad bean in a homogeneous cultivation served as a control. In addition, the broad bean from homogeneous cultivation subjected to a standard protection by chemical insecticides was also analyzed. The measurements were carried out in field conditions, by using an entomological bucket, through the shedding of insects from randomly selected 30 plants per plot. The sweet alyssum as an accompanying plant showed no significant influence on the occurrence of herbivorous beetles of Bruchus rufimanus Boh. and Sitona spp., regardless of the spacing between the rows. The white mustard as a companion plant showed a significant impact on increasing the number of Bruchus rufimanus Boh. beetles in the middle row spacing (65 cm). The impact of white <b>mustard</b> on other <b>beetles</b> has not been detected...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The primary {{plant cell}} {{wall is a}} complex mixture of polysaccharides and {{proteins}} encasing living plant cells. Among these polysaccharides, cellulose is the most abundant and useful biopolymer present on earth. These polysaccharides also represent {{a rich source of}} energy for organisms which have evolved the ability to degrade them. A growing body of evidence suggests that phytophagous beetles, mainly species from the superfamilies Chrysomeloidea and Curculionoidea, possess endogenous genes encoding complex and diverse families of so-called plant cell wall degrading enzymes (PCWDEs). The presence of these genes in phytophagous beetles may have been a key element in their success as herbivores. Here, we combined a proteomics approach and transcriptome sequencing to identify PCWDEs present in larval gut contents of the <b>mustard</b> leaf <b>beetle,</b> Phaedon cochleariae. Results Using a two-dimensional proteomics approach, we recovered 11 protein bands, isolated using activity assays targeting cellulose-, pectin- and xylan-degrading enzymes. After mass spectrometry analyses, a total of 13 proteins putatively responsible for degrading plant cell wall polysaccharides were identified; these proteins belong to three glycoside hydrolase (GH) families: GH 11 (xylanases), GH 28 (polygalacturonases or pectinases), and GH 45 (β- 1, 4 -glucanases or cellulases). Additionally, highly stable and proteolysis-resistant host plant-derived proteins from various pathogenesis-related protein (PRs) families as well as polygalacturonase-inhibiting proteins (PGIPs) were also identified from the gut contents proteome. In parallel, transcriptome sequencing revealed the presence of at least 19 putative PCWDE transcripts encoded by the P. cochleariae genome. All of these were specifically expressed in the insect gut rather {{than the rest of the}} body, and in adults as well as larvae. The discrepancy observed in the number of putative PCWDEs between transcriptome and proteome analyses could be partially explained by differences in transcriptional level. Conclusions Combining proteome and transcriptome sequencing analyses proved to be a powerful tool for the discovery of active PCWDEs in a non-model species. Our data represent the starting point of an in-depth functional and evolutionary characterization of PCWDE gene families in phytophagous beetles and their contribution to the adaptation of these highly successful herbivores to their host plants. </p...|$|R
