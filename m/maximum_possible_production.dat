50|$|At the {{low range}} of {{capacity}} factors is the photovoltaic power station, which supplies power to the electricity grid from a large-scale photovoltaic system (PV system). An inherent limit to its capacity factor comes from its requirement of daylight, preferably with a sun unobstructed by clouds, smoke or smog, shade from trees and building structures. Since the amount of sunlight varies both with {{the time of the}} day and the seasons of the year, the capacity factor is typically computed on an annual basis. The amount of available sunlight is mostly determined by the latitude of the installation and the local cloud cover.The actual production is also influenced by local factors such as dust and ambient temperature, which ideally should be low. As for any power station, the <b>maximum</b> <b>possible</b> power <b>production</b> is the nameplate capacity times the number of hours in a year, while the actual production is the amount of electricity delivered annually to the grid.|$|R

Methods to compute the requirement of energy and labour for the production processes from raw material to the product at the farm gate are discussed. It is shown that limited amounts of added energy and labour are required to achieve the <b>maximum</b> <b>possible</b> <b>production</b> per hectare. The form of the functions that relate the requirement for these resources {{with the level of}} production is considered in two limiting situations. These concern the minimum amount of added labour that is required when energy is abundantly available and the minimum amount of added energy that is required when labour is abundantly available. By means of these functions and the added energy and added labour used in the actual farm situation, iso-yield functions are constructed. These functions identify the possibilities for substitution of energy and labour during the production process at various yield levels. The shape of the expansion paths indicate {{that there may be a}} considerable range of production situations where the yield per unit of added energy, the yield per unit of added labour and the yield per unit of surface increase with increasing use of added labour and energy per hectare, whereas the added energy use per unit of added labour decreases at the same time.

The results are quantitative predictions of the <b>maximum</b> <b>possible</b> region-by-region oil consumption during the next 20 years.

In particular, during the next few years a reduction of the average per capita oil consumption of about 5 %/year is predicted for most OECD countries in Western Europe, and slightly smaller reductions, about 2 - 3 %/year, is predicted for all other oil importing countries and regions.

The question answered in this paper is: What is the optimal utilization and service level of a production system {{in order to achieve}} the <b>maximum</b> <b>possible</b> EVA for a company? A single-product, single-machine, make-to-order production system with investment dependent machine capacity is modeled. The model combines a market share concept based on delivery/production lead time and service level with concepts describing the logistical relationships between WIP, utilization, production lead time and service level. In addition to the explanatory use of the model, it can provide support for strategic decisions concerning investing or divesting machinery. The main application of this model is in describing the link between capacity investment and company value comprehensively based on data available from cost accounting in real companies. Furthermore, this paper shows that high flexibility of personnel and machine capacity increases the <b>maximum</b> <b>possible</b> EVA of <b>production</b> systems even if this flexibility is linked to additional costs.

40|$|Concern {{with the}} environmental, economic, and social {{impacts of the}} post-WWII model of {{agricultural}} intensification has led to renewed interest in grazing as a feeding strategy for temperate livestock farming systems. Putting grass back {{at the core of}} livestock feeding not only requires technical knowledge but also reconsideration of the importance of uncertainty in management choices. We developed a simple stochastic model of grassland dynamics to quantify both robustness and production of alternative management strategies under continuous grazing and management-intensive rotational grazing. The model was calibrated on data from cool-season grasslands in south-central Wisconsin. We defined robustness as the probability that a given management strategy did not lead to overgrazing, while the production indicator was number of livestock unit days per hectare enabled by the grazing strategy. Robustness was strongly dependent on the timing and intensity of grazing, and the highest levels of production were incompatible with a high value of robustness. Beyond a certain threshold of production, we observed a trade-off between robustness and production, where robustness decreased regularly until the <b>maximum</b> <b>possible</b> <b>production.</b> This trade-off did not significantly differ between continuous grazing and rotational grazing. We identified key management practices that led to both high production and high robustness, but to attain these results will require not only acquisition of new technical knowledge but also a change in the way the system is managed: from controlling environmental variability with external inputs to understanding and managing stochastic systems in a way that reduces negative externalities while increasing production efficiencies...|$|E
40|$|The Sulfur-Iodine Cycle for the {{thermochemical}} {{production of}} hydrogen offers many benefits to {{traditional methods of}} hydrogen production. As opposed to steam methane reforming - the most prevalent method of hydrogen production today - there are no carbon dioxide emissions. Compared to other methods of hydrogen production, {{the efficiency of the}} cycle is excellent. Due to the high temperatures necessary for the cycle, which are generally greater than 8500 C, several of the Generation IV nuclear reactor concepts are attractive thermal energy sources. However, the high temperature and corrosive reaction conditions of the cycle, involving reactions including the decomposition of H 2 SO 4 at 400 - 9000 C, present formidable corrosion challenges. The conversion of sulfuric acid to sulfur dioxide was the focus of this study. The alloying of structural materials to platinum has been proposed as a solution to this problem. A catalytic loop to test the materials was constructed. Sulfuric acid was pumped over the material at 903 + 20 C. The sulfur dioxide production of the catalyst was measured as a means of quantifying the efficiency of the system as a function of temperature. (cont.) The <b>maximum</b> <b>possible</b> <b>production</b> of the material was calculated by using a mass balance. A gas chromatograph was used to calculate the actual production of sulfur dioxide.

Rooftops are the best situated parts of buildings to harvest solar energy and generate electricity [12]. Calculating the rooftop solar potential is not always simple [12]. Rooftop PV potential in urban environments has been estimated in the various regions across globe [13]. Depending {{on the size of}} the study region, the type of available data, and the expected results, different methods of estimation have been used [6]. These methods try to assess essential elements such as solar incident intensity, usable roof area availability, and shadows cast by nearby objects [6]. Some studies establish a relationship between population density, building densities, and roof areas, especially for large regions [6]. The outputs of studies like these are not usually applicable at individual and local scales [6]. Based on a representative sample of buildings, Ordóňez et al. used statistical construction data and digital urban maps to measure the useful roof surface area of the sample, and extrapolated the characterization of the sample to the total study region to estimate the solar energy potential in Andalusia (Spain) [13]. Izquierdo et al. calculated the roof area available for solar applications based on land use, population, and building density data using a representative sample of GIS maps of urban areas [10]. They assessed irradiation potential by employing hourly meteorological data from weather stations using Erbs model and Liu–Jordan isotropic model [10]. Establishing a relationship between per capita suitable rooftop area and population density by linear regression on solar rooftop potential data from 1600 cities, IEA (International Energy Agency) Energy Technology Perspectives report derived the rooftop solar PV power capacity in other cities [14]. Sometimes, the inclination angle of different rooftop surfaces and the spatio-temporal variation of insolation are ignored. The IEA value may be used as a starting point in evaluating PV-generation potential, but follow-up evaluation is required.|$|R

Hofman of the Economic Projections Center of the Statistics Division, and Heriberto Tapia research assistant {{in the office}} of the Executive Secretary of ECLAC. The views expressed in this document, which has been reproduced without formal editing, are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the views of the Organization [...] Abstract Potential output estimates are becoming increasingly important in policy design in Latin America (ECLAC, 2002) and the objective of this paper is to make a methodological contribution to this field of work. For a proper evaluation of the macroeconomic situation in a certain point in time it is important to have an idea of the level of potential output. For monetary policy decisions it is important to know what the level of potential output is compared to the effective output. In an era in which inflation targeting has become widespread in Latin America it has become increasingly important to estimate potential output. In projections of economic growth the output gap can be a very important input. Estimates of potential output are of course only one of many indicators to be used in macroeconomic policy evaluation. In most developed countries an array of measures about the economic cycle are used among which the most important are measures of capacity use, delivery lags and the NAIRU (non-accelerating inflationary rate of unemployment) and direct measures of inflation. In the evaluation of the macroeconomic situation additional elements that might affect the economy (terms of trade, external situation) must be taken into consideration the whole complex environment of the economy internal and external. The work on economic growth has experienced a rapid expansion in the last few decades. Interesting new ideas have been developed and older somewhat forgotten ones have come to the focus of attention again. The growth performance of nations shows a great variety in results and these differences can be explained, among other causes, by differences in accumulation of production factors and multi factor productivity on one level and institutional factors and the international context on an other. In the context of these new approaches in the analysis of economic growth concepts like catching-up and potential growth are becoming increasingly important. In estimating potential output two approaches can be distinguished. In the first one a variety of statistical detrending techniques are applied, in our case using the Hodrick-Prescott filter, and in the second approach the output gap is estimated on the basis of structural relationships. The Hodrick-Prescott filter defines a "trend" output. The second part on production functions indicate more towards a concept of production frontier or the <b>maximum</b> <b>possible</b> <b>production</b> given certain factors. The paper estimates potential output in a group of nine countries in Latin America: Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Mexico, Peru and Venezuela. These countries cover around 80 % of the Latin American territory and about 90 % of its GDP. A new aspect of our estimates is that they introduce the concept of structural change in the production function.
