There {{have been a number of}} research projects as well as reconstruction projects and projects to make more of the site accessible to visitors. However, the director states that <b>more</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> be done to conserve the site, especially its fragile murals, and to balance the needs of tourists against the need to conserve the site in general. Each year since 1992, the number of visitors to the site increases which now stands at 653,000 annually.|$|E
25|$|In {{families}} {{with more than}} one child (twins or triplets), it has been found that maternal sensitivity is lower, as there are <b>more</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> be taken care of by the mother and less time to form a unique bond, which in turn results in decreased cognitive development in the infants (relative to if the child were raised alone). Furthermore, in the newborn period, women who displayed high maternal sensitivity had children who were able to regulate their emotions and who had higher symbolic and cognitive skills. In the case of the triplets, the child that received the least maternal sensitivity was the one that showed the poorest outcomes cognitively and had the most medical problems.|$|E
2500|$|Emanuel's {{previous}} {{statements on}} rationing {{were about the}} [...] "allocation of very scarce medical interventions such as organs and vaccines" [...] such as who should get a [...] "liver for transplantation". Ezekiel said that McCaughey's euthanasia claims were a [...] "willful distortion of my record". Jim Rutennberg said that Emanuel's critics oversimplified complex issues, such as who should get a kidney. Such rationing {{was said to be}} unavoidable because of scarcity, and because a scarce resource such as a liver is [...] "indivisible". Emanuel said that McCaughey took words out of context, omitting qualifiers such as [...] "Without overstating it (and without fully defending it) ... Clearly, <b>more</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> be done ..." [...] Emanuel once compared the word [...] "rationing" [...] to George Carlin’s seven words you can't say on television. In 1994 Emanuel said in testimony before the Senate Finance Committee, [...] "Just because we are {{spending a lot of money}} on patients who die does not mean that we can save a lot of money on end of life care." ...|$|E

2500|$|This civic {{republican or}} deliberative {{democratic}} {{conception of the}} good provides both procedural and substantive insights for developing a just allocation of health care resources. Procedurally, it suggests the need for public forums to deliberate about which health services should be considered basic and should be socially guaranteed. Substantively, it suggests services that promote {{the continuation of the}} polity-those that ensure healthy future generations, ensure development of practical reasoning skills, and ensure full and active participation by citizens in public deliberations-are to be socially guaranteed as basic. Conversely, services provided to individuals who are irreversibly prevented from being or becoming participating citizens are not basic and should not be guaranteed. An obvious example is not guaranteeing health services to patients with dementia. A less obvious example is guaranteeing neuropsychological services to ensure children with learning disabilities can read and learn to reason. Clearly, <b>more</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> be done to elucidate what specific health care services are basic; however, the overlap between liberalism and communitarianism points to a way of introducing the good back into medical ethics and devising a principled way of distinguishing basic from discretionary health care services ...|$|E

'What I have to say,' Mr. Gladstone now wrote to the prime minister, 'is that if you and Lord Aberdeen should think fit to appoint me to Florence or Naples, and to employ me in any such communications as those to which I have referred, I am at your disposal.'
