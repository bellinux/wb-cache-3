500|$|Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger {{used his}} press conference before the match to look ahead to the new season. He wanted his team to build on their FA Cup success {{and said that the}} Community Shield [...] "...will {{be the best way to}} prepare for the start of the League season next week." [...] Wenger was {{surprised}} his opponents Manchester City had taken midfielder Frank Lampard from their own franchise club New York City FC on loan; he questioned whether this was a way to bypass UEFA's Financial Fair Play rules. Of Bacary Sagna's move from Arsenal to Manchester City in the summer, Wenger told reporters: [...] "I made him a proposal to stay for three years, but he chose them. Had he chosen a long time ago? Maybe – it looks to <b>me</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> agreed it a long time before." [...] Wenger also revealed Arsenal had received offers for defender Thomas Vermaelen; on the day of the Community Shield match the player transferred to Barcelona.|$|E
500|$|... "The Convict" [...] was {{the first}} Office episode to be {{directed}} by Jeffrey Blitz, who later won an Emmy Award for the fifth season episode [...] "Stress Relief". In a departure from series routine, Gervais and Merchant were not present on set for much of filming, though episode writers had typically been available in the past. Actress Kate Flannery found the episode [...] "a {{lot of fun to}} shoot," [...] and observed that on the occasions Gervais was present, [...] "it seems to <b>me</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> is looking at all of us with a sense of, 'I can't believe that this exists because of me.' That is just my interpretation, but he seems so humble, and kind of reverent." [...] One scene was meant to take place outdoors under cold temperatures, so the parking lot set was laden with fake snow and slush. Also present on set were two sets of twin babies, as the character of Hannah Smotridge-Barr brings her son to the office.|$|E
500|$|Mitchell earned preseason first-team All-Pac-10 honors from The Sporting News and Lindy's Sports {{before the}} 2000 season as he {{prepared}} to take over the starting wide receiver job following Farmer's graduation. Mitchell, along with teammate Poli-Dixon, was named to the Fred Biletnikoff Award watchlist for the best wide receiver in college football during the preseason. In the season-opener against third-ranked Alabama, Mitchell threw a 31-yard touchdown pass to Poli-Dixon on a trick play in the first quarter and made a 46-yard touchdown reception from McCann in the third quarter. He finished the game with four catches for 91yards in the upset win. In the 24–21 win over Fresno State on September 9, Mitchell led the team in receiving with six receptions for 58yards and a 20-yard touchdown pass from McCann. Mitchell's catches went into the double-digits against third-ranked Michigan, as he had ten receptions for 137yards in the 23–20 upset win on September 16. On September 23, {{in the third quarter of}} a 29–10 loss against Oregon, Mitchell caught what appeared to be a touchdown in the corner of the end zone, but was ruled out-of-bounds by the officials. The Bruins settled for a field goal on the drive and Mitchell explained after the game that [...] "I knew it was a touchdown, you knew it was a touchdown, everybody does. The ref knew it too because he looked at <b>me</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> was sorry." [...] On the next series, however, Mitchell caught a 54-yard touchdown pass from backup quarterback Bennett. Mitchell finished the game with eight receptions for 158yards. In a 38–31 comeback win over Arizona State on September 30, he caught two touchdown passes from Cory Paus in the third quarter, one of which was for 80yards, and had four total catches for 125yards in the game. On October 14, in a triple-overtime loss to California, Mitchell made eight receptions for 167yards and caught a 35-yard touchdown from Paus in the fourth quarter.|$|E
60|$|Oscar {{burst out}} laughing. <b>Like</b> <b>me,</b> <b>he</b> now saw this mysterious young lady {{for the first}} time. <b>Like</b> <b>me,</b> <b>he</b> {{wondered}} what the extraordinary nick-name under which she had presented herself could possibly mean.|$|R
6000|$|His hand {{touched her}} foot through the soft eiderdown. Gyp thought: 'Why does he come and whine to <b>me</b> <b>like</b> this? <b>He</b> has no dignity--none!' And she said: ...|$|R

2500|$|Baseball America named Hirsh Houston's top {{prospect}} {{heading into}} the 2006 season; it also listed Hirsh as having the [...] "Best Control" [...] in the organization. Before the season, Houston added him to its 40-man roster. [...] "He's a very mature kid," [...] Astros assistant general manager Ricky Bennett said. [...] "He keeps everything in perspective." [...] With Hirsh in spring training with the major league team, manager Phil Garner summed up his estimation of Hirsh as follows: [...] "He looks to <b>me</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> maintains good concentration. [...] Whatever he's doing, {{he looks like he}} focuses at it. [...] He looks like he throws the ball down in the zone well, which is really good for as big as he is. And his stuff's good. [...] He looks like he has some of the other ingredients that you've got to have to go along with having good stuff. [...] He's a good athlete. [...] He swings the bat pretty good, and he moves on the mound well." ...|$|E
2500|$|When Jackson {{returned}} to the role, he was given multiple emotional storylines that continually put Lucky in tragic situations. As Jackson resumed the character in October 2009, Lucky is unaware that Elizabeth, his fiancée again, is {{having an affair with}} his brother Nikolas. What started as a joke grows into a physical relationship the same night Elizabeth accepts Lucky's remarriage proposal. Herbst explained to Comcast: [...] "I truly believe that [...] is in love with Lucky and has been in love with him her entire life. But what happened with Nikolas caught her by surprise as much as everybody else. It's hard for her to articulate it. She just knows that Nikolas did make her feel more like a woman and that in her relationship with Lucky she's very much still that 16-year-old girl that constantly needs to be saved. That's kind of the role that Lucky has played in her life." [...] When Lucky eventually walks in on her with Nikolas, he does not say anything and instead trashes his house and resumes drinking. J Bernard Jones from entertainment website Zap2it described that Lucky: [...] "generally was an emotional wreck, careening all over the place like a pinball. On the other hand, whenever Lucky was with Elizabeth or Nikolas he was cold and detached, imbuing just enough of Jackson's trademark sincerity (some would say over-earnestness) to knock the two cheatin' hearts off-kilter." [...] Lucky is irate by the time he confronts them. Herbst described the scene: [...] "Jonathan actually seemed like one more step {{and he was going to}} take my head off. Honestly, it was not so hard to be present when he was yelling at <b>me</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> did." [...] Jones from Zap2it stated that in the confrontation scenes: [...] "Jackson accomplished a much harder task than simply reclaiming the Lucky mantle: he has bridged the gap between his previous run, Jacob Young's and most recently, Greg Vaughan's. Now Lucky seems like a whole person once again, as opposed to a fractured character sliced up over the years by the writers, and fractured by fan loyalties." [...] Lucky, Nikolas and Elizabeth soon learn that Elizabeth is pregnant, and either brother could be the father. Jackson explained Lucky's position: ...|$|E

60|$|He {{caught my}} hand in his, and devoured it with kisses. His lips burned <b>me</b> <b>like</b> fire. <b>He</b> twisted himself {{suddenly}} in the chair, and wound his arm around my waist. In the terror and indignation of the moment, vainly struggling with him, I cried out for help.|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{he treated}} <b>me</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> does you fellows," [...] {{continued}} Jerry, [...] "he shouldn't have a yard of fencing or {{a blade of}} grass left--nor a ewe, nor a lamb, nor a hogget. I do hate fellows who come here {{and want to be}} better than any one about 'em--young chaps especially. Sending up here to look for sheep-skins, cuss his impudence! I sent that German fellow of his away with a flea in his ear." ...|$|E
6000|$|She {{turned a}} stern look on him. [...] "You bet I am! I was raised a free citizen. No man {{can make a}} slave of me. I thought he {{understood}} that; but it seems he didn't. He's all right in many ways--one of the best riders in the country--but he's pretty tolerable domineering--I've always known that--still, I never expected him to talk to <b>me</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> did to-day. It certainly was raw." [...] She broke off abruptly. [...] "You mustn't let Frank Meeker {{get the best of}} you, either," [...] she advised. [...] "He's a mean little weasel if he gets started. I'll bet he put Cliff up to this business." ...|$|E
5000|$|In 1999, Trump again {{referred}} to O'Donnell as a [...] "disgruntled employee" [...] {{during an interview}} with Playboy; Trump also told the magazine: [...] "Nobody has had worse things written about them than me.

I brought the guy in to work for me; {{it turns out he}} didn't know that much about what he was doing. I think I met the guy two or three times total.

6000|$|... "Yes"--and Verena looked up--"he {{wanted me}} to know it right away. He says it's only fair to you that he should give notice of his intentions.

6000|$|... 'If {{you talk}} to <b>me</b> <b>like</b> that,' <b>he</b> said, 'I'll shy my glass at your head.'

5000|$|Harvick {{said that}} he [...] "knew he (Edwards) was better through (Turns) 3 and 4, {{but that was not}} the car I wanted to see behind me.

I got up too high … and then he got into <b>me,</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> should have. I knew I needed to get a good run off the corner and I was going to have to get into his door.

5000|$|Also, in an {{unedited}} {{version that}} Sandler sings {{at some of}} his comedy shows, he replaces the lyric [...] "As for half-Jewish actors/Sean Penn is quite the great one/And Marlon Brando's not a Jew at all/But it looks to <b>me</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> ate one" [...] with [...] "Gwyneth Paltrow's half-Jewish/But a full-time Oscar winner/Jennifer Connelly's half-Jewish, too/And I'd like to put some more in her". While this version is not played on radio stations, the music video shows a background screen showing a picture of Sandler licking his lips as the Jennifer Connelly lyric is sung, with shocked laughter coming from the audience. This version is hidden about four minutes after the edited version on the Eight Crazy Nights soundtrack.|$|E

5000|$|The race {{restarted}} on lap 139. Matt Kenseth {{took the}} lead for a circuit on lap 152 before Truex took back over the following lap. He continued to hold it until Kenseth took it from him for good on lap 180. Racing for second, Hamlin made contact with Jimmie Johnson by bumping {{him out of the}} way rounding turns 3 and 4 before continuing on lap 198. In his post-race media availability, Hamlin explained his bump on Johnson by saying how they [...] "were racing for 13th or something at New Hampshire and he turned us, luckily I saved it. He nearly wrecked us there. I raced him hard for the lead at Charlotte and then we come here and I catch him from a really long ways back. They didn’t want to let us go. It was frustrating from my standpoint, so I had to move him out of the way. I gave him many warnings on the radio.’’ Johnson said afterwards in his availability that he was [...] "puzzled that he had to move <b>me</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> did,” Johnson said. “I prefer to race people cleanly.

Petitioner was court-martialed for the matter, but Tanikawa did not know [...] "what they did with him." [...] He did not talk with Galloway that night, because [...] "he was out of his mind" [...] and appeared insane. Tanikawa did not know when petitioner left the battalion or what happened to him after (as the witness put it) the Argonne fight, but heard he went to the hospital, [...] "just dressing station I guess." [...] The witness next saw Galloway in 1936, at a disabled veterans' post meeting in Sacramento, California. Petitioner then [...] "looked to <b>me</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> wasn't all there. Insane.
