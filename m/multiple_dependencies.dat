40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} unified {{analysis}} of the ‘respective’ readings of plural and conjoined expressions, the internal readings of symmetrical predicates such as same and different, and the summative readings of expressions such as a total of $ 10000. These expressions pose significant challenges to compositional semantics, and have been studied extensively in the literature. However, almost all previous studies focus exclusively {{on one of these}} phenomena, and the close parallels and interactions that they exhibit have been mostly overlooked to date. We point out two key properties common to these phenomena: (i) they target all types of coordination, including nonconstituent coordination such as Right-Node Raising and Dependent Cluster Coordination; (ii) the three phenomena all exhibit <b>multiple</b> <b>dependency,</b> both by themselves and with respect to each other. These two parallels suggest that one and the same mechanism {{is at the core of}} their semantics. Building on this intuition, we propose a unified {{analysis of the}}se phenomena, in which the meanings of expressions involving coordination are formally modelled as multisets, that is, sets that allow for duplicate occurrences of identical elements. The analysis is couched in Hybrid Type-Logical Categorial Grammar. The flexible syntax-semantics interface of this framework enables an analysis of ‘respective’ readings and related phenomena which, for the first time in the literature, yields a simple and principled solution for both the interactions with nonconstituent coordination and the <b>multiple</b> <b>dependency</b> noted above...|$|R

However, most dependency-based systems suffer from a major drawback: they only use 1 -best dependency trees for feature extraction, which adversely affects the performance due to parsing errors. Therefore, we propose an approach that applies dependency forest to sentiment analysis. A dependency forest compactly represents <b>multiple</b> <b>dependency</b> trees. We develop new algorithms for extracting features from dependency forest. Experiments show that our forest-based system obtains 5. 4 point absolute improvement in accuracy over a bag-of-words system, and 1. 3 point improvement over a tree-based system on a widely used sentiment dataset. Our forest-based system also achieves state-ofthe-art performance on the sentiment dataset...|$|R

40|$|The word {{addiction}} is almost immediately associated with notions of drug dependency and alcoholism, and drug {{addiction is}} often referred to as a pandemic that affects individuals, families, communities and society at large. Aetiological approaches to understanding and treating addiction have changed dramatically throughout history, and currently the most contemporary approach is that of the disease model which views addiction as an illness rather than as a ‘badness’. While the underpinnings of Narcotics Anonymous’ 12 step philosophy employs non-specific drug language as it views all drugs as having the capacity to become addictive, and while it does not distinguish between the capacity for substances and certain behaviours to become addictive, activities such as overeating, having sex and gambling are yet to be classified as legitimate addictions by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV-TR). As a result, it appears as if some confusion exists as to whether these behaviours should be classified as impulse control disorders or as genuine addictions due to the various similarities they share in common with substance based disorders. The research conducted explored how people recovering from addiction, as well as how people working with addiction understand addiction and <b>multiple</b> <b>dependency,</b> together with the factors that contribute to relapse and the ability to abstain. Various 12 Step meetings from a variety of 12 Step Fellowships were attended and members were invited to participate in the study. Ultimately seventy eight participants completed a self developed questionnaire which was utilised to assess how people recovering from addiction understood addiction and <b>multiple</b> <b>dependency</b> and the factors that contribute to relapse and the ability to abstain. Quantitative data were analysed via descriptive and inferential statistics. Furthermore twenty participants working with addiction were interviewed with the use of a semi structured interview schedule in order to explore their perceptions around addiction and the factors that contribute to relapse and sobriety. Qualitative data were analysed using thematic content analysis. Results indicated that the majority of recovering addicts and professionals working with addiction understand addiction as a disease. However, discrepancy was apparent with regards to whether or not all recovering addicts have the same disease and subsequently whether all addictions can be treated in the same manner. The above result suggested that there was no standardised, uniform way in which the disease model is understood and interpreted. Factors such as cross addiction, resistance to change and issues relating to the maintenance of change were identified as issues that contribute to relapse, while factors such as aftercare, following the 12 step programme and support were identified as the main aspects that contribute to sobriety. No statistical significance was noted between participants who had relapsed as opposed to those who had not for variables of sensation seeking, impulsivity and perceived stress (which may have been as a result of small sample size). Deeper understanding of the disease model together with broader application of it, and a focus on appropriate training and more comprehensive assessment could perhaps see a reduction in high rates of relapse and recidivism more commonly known as the ‘revolving door syndrome’...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Craig {{interpolation}} is a known {{method for}} expressing a target function f {{as a function}} of a given set of base functions G. The found interpolant represents the dependency function h, such that f = h(G). Generally, the set G contains enough base functions to enable the existence of <b>multiple</b> <b>dependency</b> functions whose quality mainly depends on the base functions selected for reconstruction. The interpolation is not an optimization problem and thus, often, it selects some random base functions and, particularly, omits others potentially required for an optimal implementation of the target function. Mainly, it is impossible to impose that the interpolant uses a specific base function. In this paper, we propose a method that forces a specific base function gi as a primary input of a dependency function. Such dependency function is build as a Shannon expansion of two constrained Craig interpolants for the assignments of the primary inputs for which gi evaluates to 0 and 1, respectively. We also introduce a method that iteratively imposes, one by one, a predefined set of base functions. In each iteration, we force a base function by generating a new dependency function used as a target function for the next iteration. We show that, unlike the standard Craig interpolation method, our carving method succeeds, with very high probability, to impose the desired base functions. It recomposes single-output logic circuits as their delay- or area-optimised implementations regardless of the input implementation. The proposed methods can be efficiently employed for rewriting circuits in some synthesis-based algorithms. I...|$|R

It was hypothesized that young gay men with AIDS and the elderly experience similar physical, social, and psychological changes, but the cognitive adaptation to these changes are hindered by the non-normative timing of these events. Methods. Thirty-two self-identified gay men with AIDS {{between the ages of}} 22 to 44 years were recruited from an out-patient clinic in Montreal. These participants were asked to complete a comprehensive questionnaire, which assessed the respondent's daily stress, impact of HIV, health-related quality of life, ways of coping, <b>multiple</b> loss, <b>dependency</b> on informal and formal supports, and preparation for death. Quantitative methods were used to analyse the data. Results. The hypothesis was confirmed. Respondents reported relatively low levels of health-related quality of life, significant concern over health and financial security, considerable <b>multiple</b> loss, increased <b>dependency</b> on informal and formal supports, proportionally greater use of active coping strategies, and significant concern about discrimination.
