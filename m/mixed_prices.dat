40|$|The late 1980 s saw a {{transformation}} of telecommunications in Australia {{with the introduction of}} limited competition. In 1997 the market was fully opened to competition. It was hoped on both these occasions that competition would lead to low prices and a wide range of services. The resulting picture has been <b>mixed.</b> <b>Prices</b> have fallen significantly but Australia is not at the forefront of low international prices. However, {{there are a number of}} reasons for this and it is unrealistic to expect very low prices. Australian consumers and businesses have benefitted greatly from the large reductions in prices that have occurred and price reductions are undoubtedly a key reason for the growing importance of telecommunications in household and business budgets and our lives generally over the past twenty years...|$|E

The main results are: {{the determination of}} turning points in Euroland's business cycle is not very sensitive to the detrending method used, although {{the level of the}} recent output gap depends on it.

In markets with <b>mixed</b> <b>prices</b> impact of devaluation and inflation against the foreign currency have most complex nature and usually leads to slower growth in prices in local currency and partial de-dollarization of the market. Provided that the value of the real estate market is denominated in local and foreign currency, it is necessary {{to solve the problem of}} correspondence between these prices. With this condition must be satisfied that the market prices in local currency correspond to the state of the real estate market on the valuation date. Purpose. Development of the method, which should take into account the particular valuation procedures in determining the market value of the local currency in terms of the existence of high inflation and a significant devaluation. The study of this problem, especially for the markets of emerging economics, is an urgent and important task of applied economic analysis and, in particular, the theory and practice of evaluation as part of this analysis. Conclusion. To achieve this goal have been developed and used techniques and methods of applied economic analysis and, in particular, the theory and practice of evaluation as part of this analysis. Satisfactory agreement obtained values and the market rent rate, which are responsible of the real estate market in a significant devaluation of local currency, confirm the position that the correction in market conditions ("discount on the offer price" and "market conditions") must be done in determining the market value so and the market rent rate...|$|E

With different marginal costs, by changing the production <b>mix</b> <b>price</b> differentiation can improve welfare and also aggregate consumer surplus even if total output does not increase (as in the linear case). This depends on the variability of cost and demand parameters, and on their correlation. We also show that the welfare criterion (developed for the case of common marginal costs) based on total output can {{be replaced by the}} computation of well-defined price indexes. These results possibly pave the way for a more optimistic assessment of monopolistic pricing...|$|R

A fraction of consumers, {{who do not}} learn any new information, remain locked-in at their previous supplier in each period. We analyze Markov perfect equilibria in which firms use <b>mixed</b> <b>pricing</b> strategies. Market share dynamics are driven by the endogenous price dispersion.

A time-based competitive tactic, MI is used by marketing and sales managers to respond to consumers more quickly in the marketplace. Fleisher suggests it is not distributed as widely as some forms of CI, which are also distributed to non-marketing decision-makers. Market intelligence has a shorter time horizon than other intelligence areas, and is measured in days, weeks, or (in slower-moving industries) months.|$|R
