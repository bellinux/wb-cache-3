Currently, gastrointestinal diseases due to dysregulated gut microbiota are considered important factors that limit {{growth of the}} captive forest <b>musk</b> <b>deer</b> population. Compared with captive forest <b>musk</b> <b>deer,</b> wild forest <b>musk</b> <b>deer</b> have a wider feeding range with no dietary limitations, and their gut microbiota are in a relatively natural state. However, no reports have compared the gut microbiota between wild and captive forest <b>musk</b> <b>deer.</b> To gain insight into the composition of gut microbiota in forest <b>musk</b> <b>deer</b> under different food-source conditions, we employed high-throughput 16 S rRNA sequencing technology to investigate differences in the gut microbiota occurring between captive and wild forest <b>musk</b> <b>deer.</b> Both captive and wild forest <b>musk</b> <b>deer</b> showed similar microbiota at the phylum level, which consisted mainly of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes, although {{significant differences were found}} in their relative abundances between both groups. α-Diversity results showed that no significant differences occurred in the microbiota between both groups, while β-diversity results showed that significant differences did occur in their microbiota compositions.

40|$|There {{is not a}} {{consensus}} on classification of <b>musk</b> <b>deer.</b> Nowak (1991) includes Moschus in the family Cervidae (true deer), but suggests that the genus may warrant its own separate family.

Green and Kattel (1997) report that Moschus comprise a separate family, somewhere between the Mouse Deer (Tragulidae) and the Cervoids (goat-antelopes and true deer). This is due to having both “primitive” ruminant characteristics such as tusks and an absence of antlers, and more advanced features such as a four-chambered stomach.

The results depicted that altitude, cattle grazing, rock cover and distance to settlements influenced on selecting communal pellet deposition sites by the <b>musk</b> <b>deer.</b> The pellet deposition sites had lower mean richness of forbs and seedlings species.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Alpine <b>musk</b> <b>deer</b> (Moschus sifanicus) {{have evolved}} {{behavioural}} characteristics which {{have contributed to}} their sur-vival and proliferation in a unique environmental niche. Understanding these characteristics, specifically those relating to gender is vital in developing appropriate social and economic management systems for captive farming. This study compared the behav-ioural patterns of female and male captive <b>musk</b> <b>deer</b> to explore differences in gender. Thirty two adult captive <b>musk</b> <b>deer,</b> 19 males and 13 females, were observed from August 2002 to January 2003, at Xinglongshan <b>Musk</b> <b>Deer</b> Farm (XMDF) Gansu Province, China. The frequencies of 12 behavioural categories were recorded and compared between the two sexes. The results showed (1) that behavioural patterns were similar between female and male deer, (2) that female alpine <b>musk</b> <b>deer</b> can express male specific behaviour, such as tail-pasting and, (3) that gender differences in feeding and ruminating behaviour {{may be related to}} energy requirement and resource allocation patterns...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{seeks to}} explore and assess the habitat selection, trophic interactions and distribution of Himalayan <b>musk</b> <b>deer.</b> Chapter one deals with seasonal diet analysis of <b>musk</b> <b>deer</b> along with the overlap in consumption with livestock during summer. Microhistological technique was employed to assess dietary consumption. Results showed that Abies spectabilis, Pinus wallichiana, and Berberis species constituted the major portion of <b>musk</b> <b>deer’s</b> diet. Dietary breadth measured by the Shannon index was found higher in winter compared to summer. Although <b>musk</b> <b>deer</b> and livestock shared {{a considerable number of}} plant species in their diets, the consumption however was significantly different in terms of abundance of the species consumed. Chapter two deals with habitat selection at the 2 nd order in terms of physical and vegetational attributes within the home range. It also assesses the impacts of livestock presence in habitat selection of <b>musk</b> <b>deer.</b> Logistic regression of <b>musk</b> <b>deer’s</b> presence/absence with binomial error structure and logit link function was employed to determine the physical and vegetational characteristics that likely affected the habitat selection by <b>musk</b> <b>deer.</b> Results found that elevation, aspect, canopy-cover, and tree species significantly affected the habitat selection of <b>musk</b> <b>deer.</b> Moreover, presence and absence of livestock was not found to have any significant effect on the habitat section of <b>musk</b> <b>deer</b> suggesting the selection as an evolutionary adaptation rather than an outcome of interspecific interactions with the livestock. Chapter three deals with habitat selection at the scale of geographic range. This chapter seeks to predict the area that is climatically suitable currently and in the future in context of climate change. Maxent modeling technique with occurrence records (i. e., latitude and longitude) of the species and bioclimatic variables as inputs was employed. Annual mean temperature was found as the significant climatic variable affecting habitat selection at the scale of geographic range and the model predicted an expansion of climatically-suitable area at the northern limit of the species’ range in Indian and Tibetan regions. It is expected that the understanding of habitat selection of <b>musk</b> <b>deer</b> at different scales could help in the conservation and management of the species...|$|R
40|$|<b>Musk</b> <b>deer</b> {{are highly}} {{important}} as a medicinal species that are severely exploited throughout their range of occurrence due to the medicinal value of the musk produced only by the male individuals. Methods used for studying the populations and distributions of other ungulates do not work well with <b>musk</b> <b>deer</b> {{and the presence of}} a unified methodology for studying <b>musk</b> <b>deer</b> appear to be lacking worldwide. Therefore, the development of a simple predictive model for studying the distribution of the <b>musk</b> <b>deer</b> habitats stands as an important task to be accomplished.

New sightings of <b>musk</b> <b>deer</b> was later spotted in the upper northeast Asia and Russia; these spotted places soon opened their own musk market. After the 1980s, the production begins to steadily decline due to hunting for their musk glands.
