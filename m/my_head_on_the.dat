500|$|In 1998, on {{learning}} of {{his interest in}} pursuing a political career, the National Party president John Slater began working actively to recruit him. Former party leader Jenny Shipley describes {{him as one of}} the people she [...] "deliberately sought out and put <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> line–either privately or publicly–to get them in there".|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, {{the song}} shows Rihanna sexually seducing her love interest, while {{revealing}} her [...] "nasty secrets". According to Julianne Shepherd of Spin, Rihanna [...] "coyly dares" [...] 'her lover to [...] "sex her up"'. In [...] "Roc Me Out", Rihanna uses her [...] "militaristic alternate persona" [...] and interprets the lyrics [...] "with a command and directness befitting" [...] of it. Rihanna complains to her lover throughout the lines [...] "You’re taking {{too long to}} get <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground / And my feet in the clouds," [...] before cooing, [...] "I’ve been a bad girl, daddy". She gives him instructions while singing [...] "Get <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground and my feet in the clouds". Priya Elan of NME commented that the song sounds like a [...] "‘Rude Boy’ re-tool from the vocal delivery to her 'Come on boy' line." [...] In the end, Rihanna reveals the [...] "dirtiest secret" [...] through the line [...] "I’ll let you in on a dirty secret, I {{just want to be}} loved". David Amidon of PopMatters described the line as the song's [...] "not exactly a dangerous sentiment".|$|E
500|$|Bowie {{was chosen}} to curate the 2007 High Line Festival, {{selecting}} musicians and artists for the Manhattan event, including electronic pop duo AIR, surrealist photographer Claude Cahun and English comedian Ricky Gervais. Bowie performed on Scarlett Johansson's 2008 album of Tom Waits covers, Anywhere I Lay <b>My</b> <b>Head.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> 40th anniversary of the July 1969 moon landing—and Bowie's accompanying commercial breakthrough with [...] "Space Oddity"—EMI released the individual tracks from the original eight-track studio recording of the song, in a 2009 contest inviting {{members of the public}} to create a remix. A Reality Tour, a double album of live material from the 2003 concert tour, was released in January 2010.|$|E
60|$|The {{sense of}} fear {{began to come}} to me now. I moved <b>my</b> <b>head</b> away <b>on</b> <b>the</b> pillow. The whisper {{followed}} my movement.|$|R
60|$|I rolled <b>my</b> <b>head</b> {{negatively}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> floor. “Your {{arguments are}} too—er—forcible,” I managed to articulate, at cost of great pain to my aching throat.|$|R

500|$|After England had amassed 496 in {{the first}} innings, Australia had slumped to 3/68 with Bradman one of the {{dismissed}} batsmen. Harvey, {{the youngest member of}} the squad, joined cavalier all-rounder Keith Miller. Australia were more than 400 behind and if England were to remove the pair, they would expose Australia's lower order and give themselves an opportunity to take a large first innings lead. Upon arriving in the middle, Miller greeted him cheerfully and said to Harvey, [...] "OK, mate, get up the other end. [...] I'll take the bowling for a while until you get yourself organised." [...] Harvey said, [...] "Mate, that will do me." [...] I couldn't get up the other end quick enough. [...] I watched him play a few overs and I thought, [...] "This is good", and then they brought Laker on to bowl. [...] The third and the fifth balls of Laker's over disappeared over <b>my</b> <b>head,</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> way up, and they both finished in the crowd for six[...] [...] [...] I can honestly thank Keith Miller for the confidence he gave me during our partnership [...] [...] [...] and it did so much for my future cricket career." ...|$|E
60|$|In lazy wonder, I turn <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> pillow, {{and look}} {{on the other side}} of my bed.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{see it all}} now--don't you? After I had thanked Miss Minerva, {{turned away}} <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> pillow {{overpowered}} by disgust.|$|E
60|$|My blood {{seemed to}} stand still. A deadly paralysing coldness stole {{all over me}} as I turned <b>my</b> <b>head</b> round <b>on</b> <b>the</b> pillow and {{determined}} to test whether the bed-top was really moving or not, by keeping my eye <b>on</b> <b>the</b> man in the picture.|$|R
6000|$|I {{heard no}} more, felt no more, till I became {{conscious}} that I was lying with <b>my</b> <b>head</b> low <b>on</b> <b>the</b> sofa, Pierre, {{and my father}} by my side. As soon as I was thoroughly revived, my father left the room, and presently returned, saying-- ...|$|R

6000|$|So, when I am in a voluptuous vein, [...] I pillow <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> sweets of the rose, And list to {{the tale}} of the wreath, and the chain, [...] Till its echoes depart; then I sink to repose.|$|E
6000|$|Charley smiled. [...] "Your remark {{is about}} as clear as <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> subject, Jacques; but I still remain {{convinced}} that truth is right and that falsehood is wrong, {{and that we should}} stick to the first through thick and thin." ...|$|E

60|$|One day, I do {{not know}} whether it was in the morning or afternoon, I raised <b>my</b> <b>head,</b> and <b>on</b> <b>the</b> horizon I saw a steamer. Quick as a flash my glass was brought to bear upon it. In the next minute my arms dropped, the {{telescope}} fell into <b>my</b> lap, <b>my</b> <b>head</b> dropped. It was not Bertha's steamer; it was an ordinary steamer with its deck parallel with the water and a long line of smoke coming out of its funnel. The shock of the disappointment was very great.|$|R
6000|$|... "And didn't he bore <b>my</b> <b>head</b> off <b>on</b> <b>the</b> home passage!" [...] began Bunter {{again in}} a weary voice. [...] "He loved me. He was proud of me. I was converted. I had had a manifestation. Do {{you know what he}} was after? He wanted me and him 'to make a seance,' in his own words, and to try to call up that ghost (the one that had turned my hair white--the ghost of my {{supposed}} victim), and, as he said, talk it over with him--the ghost--in a friendly way.|$|R
60|$|I {{was shown}} {{into the room}} I already knew so well, and I sat down in Giulia's chair. I rested <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{cushions}} which had pressed against her beautiful hair, her cheek; and I inhaled the fragrance which they had left behind them.|$|E
6000|$|... "I propose," [...] I continued, elaborating {{upon the}} scheme {{that had come}} into <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> way, [...] "to do more than this for you. I am asking some friends to dine to-night whom I wish you and your {{daughter}} to meet. You will {{then be able to}} refer to other reputable acquaintances in London besides myself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What sort of men? Any {{men that}} came along?" [...] said the troop-horse. [...] "They teach us in riding school {{to lie down}} and let our masters fire across us, but Dick Cunliffe is the only man I'd trust to do that. It tickles my girths, and, besides, I can't see with <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground." ...|$|E
60|$|I awoke, {{suddenly}} and unaccountably, {{from a deep}} and dreamless sleep with an all-pervading sensation of nervous uneasiness which I had never felt before. In the old days at the Vicarage my capacity as a sound sleeper had {{been the subject of}} many a little harmless joke. From the moment when <b>my</b> <b>head</b> was <b>on</b> <b>the</b> pillow I had never known what it was to awake until the maid knocked at my door. At all seasons and times the long and uninterrupted repose of a child was the repose that I enjoyed.|$|R
6000|$|... "So rapid was {{the action}} that the volley which {{immediately}} succeeded passed harmlessly over his head, while the Indians dashed forward in pursuit. At {{the same instant}} I myself was felled to the earth. The axe which the trapper had flung struck a tree in its flight, and as it glanced off the handle gave me a violent blow in passing. I fell stunned. As I did so <b>my</b> <b>head</b> alighted <b>on</b> <b>the</b> shoulder of the woman, {{and the last thing}} I felt, as my wandering senses forsook me, was her still warm blood flowing over my face and neck.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have made}} her happy!" [...] he murmured. [...] "I may lay down <b>my</b> weary <b>head</b> now <b>on</b> <b>the</b> mother earth that hushes all her {{children}} to rest at last. Sink, heart! sink, sink to rest! Oh, look at them!" [...] he said to Crayford, with a burst of grief. [...] "They have forgotten me already." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I'll {{tell you}} how I came to think of it,' said the Knight. 'You see, I said to myself, [...] "The only {{difficulty}} is with the feet: the HEAD is high enough already." [...] Now, first I put <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> top of the gate--then I stand on my head--then the feet are high enough, you see--then I'm over, you see.' ...|$|E
60|$|That, however, {{was one of}} {{the chances}} which must be taken, if we would get about the work in the only manner that promised success, and I wriggled my way upward until having come to where the earth was {{seemingly}} solid above <b>my</b> <b>head,</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> alert meanwhile for a signal from Harvey which should tell of danger in the rear.|$|E
6000|$|... “I {{wonder if}} you’re dead? I hope so!” I thought, for {{my head was}} swimming. But I wasn’t going to take chances; I had his own example too close before me for that; and I tried to draw the knife out to give it him again. The blood came over my hands, I remember, hot as tea; and with that I fainted clean away, and fell with <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> man’s mouth.|$|E
40|$|UCI # 4. As I {{was walking}} {{to work to}} open <b>the</b> {{storefront}} <b>on</b> Broad Street to attract pedestrians, I heard this plane come over <b>my</b> <b>head.</b> Later <b>on</b> in <b>the</b> day, this plane was joined by helicopters as well. It was really jarring to realize that I’m {{not the only one}} who’s watching: so is the rest of the world. [URL]...|$|R

But he wants you, George--he wants you. Sometimes he's full of hope--talks of when we're {{going to have}} a carriage and be in society--makes it seem so natural and topsy-turvy, I hardly know whether my old heels aren't up here listening to him, and <b>my</b> old <b>head</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> floor.... Then he gets depressed. Says he wants restraint. Says he can make a splash but can't keep on. Says if you don't come in everything will smash--But you are coming in?" ...|$|R
6000|$|The dimly-flowing {{river was}} at my feet; <b>the</b> river <b>on</b> which I had seen Cristel again, {{for the first time}} since we were children. Thus far, the dreadful loss of her had been a calamity, held away from me in some degree by events which had imperatively taken {{possession}} of my mind. In the darkness and the stillness, the misery of having lost her was free to crush me. <b>My</b> <b>head</b> dropped <b>on</b> <b>the</b> neck of the dog, nestling close at my side. [...] "Oh, Ponto!" [...] I said to him, [...] "she's gone!" [...] Nobody could see me; nobody could despise me--I burst out crying.|$|R
6000|$|... '"Be not frightened," [...] he {{said more}} quietly, [...] "I {{can make you}} whole again," [...] and laying a magic powder on our tongues he placed our heads on our necks. In the {{twinkling}} of an eye our heads were joined to our bodies without leaving {{so much as a}} scar; only that, blinded with rage as he still was, Thelamis had placed <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> prince's body, and his on mine! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{wonder if}} you're dead? I hope so!" [...] I thought, for {{my head was}} swimming. But I wasn't going to take chances; I had his own example too close before me for that; and I tried to draw the knife out to give it him again. The blood came over my hands, I remember, hot as tea; and with that I fainted clean away, and fell with <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> man's mouth.|$|E
6000|$|I {{knelt down}} by the tomb. I laid my hands, I laid <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> broad white stone, and closed my weary eyes on the earth around, on the light above. I let her come back to me. Oh, my love! my love! my heart may speak to you NOW! It is {{yesterday}} again since we parted--yesterday, since your dear hand lay in mine--yesterday, since my eyes looked their last on you. My love! my love! ...|$|E
6000|$|They {{had taken}} me into the kitchen, and I had laid <b>my</b> <b>head</b> down <b>on</b> <b>the</b> old deal table. Biddy held one of my hands to her lips, and Joe's {{restoring}} touch was on my shoulder. [...] "Which he warn't strong enough, my dear, fur to be surprised," [...] said Joe. And Biddy said, [...] "I ought to have thought of it, dear Joe, but I was too happy." [...] They were both so overjoyed to see me, so proud to see me, so touched by my coming to them, so delighted that I should have come by accident to make their day complete! ...|$|R
60|$|In {{the moment}} when she spoke to me I knew what had happened. The old Indian wound (irritated, doubtless, by the violent {{exertion}} that I had imposed on myself) had opened again. I struggled against the sudden sense of faintness that seized on me; I tried to tell {{the people of the}} inn what to do. It was useless. I dropped to <b>my</b> knees; <b>my</b> <b>head</b> sunk <b>on</b> <b>the</b> bosom of the woman stretched senseless upon the low couch beneath me. The death-in-life that had got her had got me. Lost to the world about us, we lay, with my blood flowing on her, united in our deathly trance.|$|R
60|$|We {{started from}} Vera Cruz about mid-day and slept, or rather passed the night, at a filthy inn alive with every sort of insect pest. Two hours before dawn we were bundled into the diligencia and slowly dragged up a {{mountain}} road so steep that, notwithstanding the blows and oaths of the drivers, the mules {{had to stop}} every few hundred yards to rest. I remember that at last I fell asleep, <b>my</b> <b>head</b> reposing <b>on</b> <b>the</b> shoulder of a very fat priest, who snored tempestuously, then awoke to pray, then snored again. It {{was the voice of}} Miss Becker, who sat opposite to me, that wakened me.|$|R
