A study of factors which may influence the amount and ratios of the volatile acids should be helpful in determining manufacturing and curing procedures which will give a fine flavored product.

An alternative approach for control using methods approved for organic production are sprays based on teas made from compost, both actively aerated (ACT) and non-aerated (NCT) compost teas, and sprays made from diluted milk. We evaluated these sprays for control of powdery mildew on pumpkins in field trials in Connecticut in 2008 and 2009, and in greenhouse trials in 2009. We also evaluated the compost teas and milk in the greenhouse in 2009, as well as additives, like liquid seaweed and humic acid, used to enhance the effectiveness of compost teas. Applications were applied to the leaves before disease symptoms were noticed and visual assessments of the plants were made on a weekly basis. In 2008 both the ACT and NCT treatments applied in combination with a milk spray significantly reduced the incidence of powdery mildew compared with compost tea applied without the additional milk spray. In 2009 the treatments were changed to evaluate the effect of milk applied alone, and the compost teas were evaluated without the additional milk application. In both locations the compost teas provided no control of powdery mildew when compared to the untreated control plots. The <b>milk</b> <b>treatment</b> provided significantly less disease than the untreated control, and the chemical treatment had equal or significantly less disease than the milk.

Immediately following muscle-damaging exercise, participants consumed either A 2 milk, regular milk or PLA (500 mL each). Visual analogue scale (muscle soreness), maximal voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC), countermovement jump (CMJ) and 20 -m sprint were measured prior to and 24, 48, and 72 h post EIMD. At 48 h post-EIMD, CMJ and 20 -m sprint recovered quicker in A 2 (33. 4 ± 6. 6 and 3. 3 ± 0. 1, respectively) and regular milk (33. 1 ± 7. 1 and 3. 3 ± 0. 3, respectively) vs. PLA (29. 2 ± 3. 6 and 3. 6 ± 0. 3, respectively) (p < 0. 05).

With federal Clean Water Act Section 319 funding, four new or modified <b>milk</b> house wastewater <b>treatment</b> systems were demonstrated and evaluated on sixteen farms in four counties in Minnesota. All of the treatment systems had a septic tank for primary treatment. The four types of systems installed included aeration, both aerobic treatment units and recirculating media filters with discharge to subsurface soil treatment systems, irrigation to cropland or pasture, and large soil surface infiltration areas covered with bark (bark beds). The systems were monitored for influent and effluent wastewater characteristics, water flow and overall system performance. Overall the systems removed 98 - 100 % of BOD 5 and TSS, 90 to 100 % of the phosphorous and 75 - 90 % of the nitrogen. Lessons learned from the installation and monitoring of these systems have led to design guidelines for the selection, design, and installation of these <b>milk</b> house wastewater <b>treatment</b> systems.
