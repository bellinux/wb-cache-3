5000|$|Coverings {{have changed}} as {{industrial}} techniques have developed, and have included <b>Mercerised</b> <b>cotton,</b> velvet, calfskin and, most recently, bicast leather. However, sheep's leather {{is still considered}} the authentic material for the chairs.|$|R
5000|$|The modern {{production}} method for <b>mercerised</b> <b>cotton,</b> {{also known as}} [...] "pearl" [...] or [...] "pearle" [...] cotton, gives cotton thread (or cotton-covered thread with a polyester core) a sodium hydroxide bath that is then neutralized with an acid bath. This treatment increases lustre, strength, affinity to dye, and resistance to mildew. On the other hand, it also increases its affinity to lint.|$|R
50|$|Since silk, the {{original}} product, was gradually {{being replaced by}} more modern raw materials, Amann & Söhne started to manufacture schappe silk in 1919, and <b>mercerised</b> <b>cotton</b> in 1923. Alfred Amann died in 1942. Alfred Pielenz, his son-in-law, was nominated to become his successor. He guided the company through {{the last years of}} war, during which the production stagnated, as well as through the postwar years, during which the production was slowly being reconstructed.|$|R
5000|$|Historians {{studying}} {{the reign of}} James IV believe that a similar series of [...] "Unicorn" [...] tapestries {{were part of the}} Scottish Royal tapestry collection. The team at West Dean Tapestry visited the Metropolitan Museum of Art to inspect the originals and researched the medieval techniques, the colour palette and materials. Traditional techniques and materials were used with <b>mercerised</b> <b>cotton</b> taking the place of silk to preserve its colour better. The wool was specially dyed at West Dean College.|$|R
50|$|Jean Dollfus {{was born}} in Mulhouse, France, in 1800, the son of Daniel Dollfus and Anne Marie Mieg. He {{was born in}}to a family that owned a textile {{business}} established in the 18th century. His parents wrote their surname as Dollfus-Mieg, and Daniel used this name to re-brand his uncle's textile company as Dollfus-Mieg & Compagnie, or D.M.C., in 1800. Whilst studying in Leeds, Jean Dollfus found out about <b>Mercerised</b> <b>cotton.</b> This was a new technique of chemically treating cotton to increase not only its strength but also its appearance, a discovery that he would apply to the textile business.|$|R
25|$|Cotton {{forms the}} {{foundation}} of warps and wefts {{of the majority of}} modern rugs. Nomads who cannot afford to buy cotton on the market use wool for warps and wefts, which are also traditionally made of wool in areas where cotton was not a local product. Cotton can be spun more tightly than wool, and tolerates more tension, which makes cotton a superior material for {{the foundation of}} a rug. Especially larger carpets are more likely to lie flat on the floor, whereas wool tends to shrink unevenly, and carpets with a woolen foundation may buckle when wet. Chemically treated (<b>mercerised)</b> <b>cotton</b> has been used in rugs as a silk substitute since the late nineteenth century.|$|R
40|$|Continuous cold Ar plasmas {{were used}} to {{activate}} the <b>mercerised</b> <b>cotton</b> fabric towards surface-initiated graft polymerisation of glycidyl methacrylate, 2 -hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA) and 1, 1, 2, 2 -tetrahydroperfluorodecyl methacrylate (XFDMA). Single and multi-step processes, carried out either in the plasma chamber (one-step and two-step processes) or ex situ after plasma treatment, were explored to optimise the grafting efficiency. The mechanical properties of the grafted cotton were substantially unaffected. Grafting with XFDMA gave good results only when the plasma activation was performed on monomer-impregnated fabrics, as shown by gravimetry, ATR FT-IR spectroscopy, and water and oil repellence tests. On the contrary, with HEMA better results were obtained by in situ grafting from monomer vapour...|$|R
50|$|The {{early years}} of the 20th century saw the {{manufacture}} of surgical threads which were woven rather than twisted. In 1907 a new artificial silk was produced specifically for the manufacture of Plauen lace. With the main factory unable to cope with demand, another was set up at Mundelsheim in 1910. A new product was added to the Amann range in 1919 with the manufacture of schappe silk (silk waste) and in 1921 an extension was built to house the colour dyeing plant. The latter was overseen by Johannes Mecheels, whose son, Otto Mecheels, went on to establish the Hohenstein Institute, a textile research centre situated at the edge of Bönnigheim. In 1923, <b>mercerised</b> <b>cotton</b> thread was produced, followed two years later by crocheting thread made from artificial silk.|$|R
50|$|Today the Baandha {{fabric is}} popularly {{known by its}} {{geographical}} and cultural name Sambalpuri owing to the pioneering efforts of Sri Radhashyam Meher, who brought about a radical improvement in {{the skills of the}} craftsmen {{and the quality of the}} products. Other master craftsmen who contributed to the development of Sambalpuri textiles were Padmashree Kailash Chandra Meher, Padmashree Kunja Bihari Meher, Padmashree Chatrubhuja Meher and Padmashree Krutharth Acharya. Sambalpuri textiles today include furnishing materials, dress materials and sarees in silk, <b>cotton</b> and <b>mercerised</b> <b>cotton</b> in a variety of colours and many different designs. Baandha craftsmen are also masters of the 'extra warp' and 'extra weft' style of designing which can be seen in almost all forms of Baandha textiles. Radhashyam Meher also produced Khadi textiles using the Baandha art.|$|R
5000|$|Filet crochet {{is a type}} of crocheted fabric. This type of {{crocheted lace}} is gridlike because it uses only two crochet stitches: the chain stitch and the double crochet stitch (U.S. terminology; known in some other {{countries}} as chain stitch and treble). Old filet patterns used a treble or triple stitch vertically but chained two between the vertical stitches. This was to prevent distortion of some patterns. Chain stitches use less yarn than double crochet stitches, which results in a visual difference in appearance between the two kinds of stitch. Filet crochet forms patterns by filling in parts of a mostly chain stitch mesh with double crochet stitches. [...] Filet crochet is usually constructed from monotone crochet thread made of <b>Mercerised</b> <b>cotton</b> in white or ecru, and worked in rows. Filet crochet is used for decorative applications such as window curtains, tablecloths, and place settings such as coasters and placemats.|$|R

60|$|There is, of course, {{nothing on}} earth, and I doubt at times {{if there is}} a joy in Heaven, like {{starting}} a small haberdasher's shop. Imagine, for example, having a drawerful of tapes (one whole piece most exquisitely blocked of every possible width of tape), or, again, an army of neat, large packages, each displaying one sample of hooks and eyes. Think of your cottons, your drawer of coloured silks, the little, less, least of the compartments and thin packets of your needle drawer! Poor princes and wretched gentlefolk mysteriously above retail trade, may taste only the faint unsatisfactory shadow of these delights with trays of stamps or butterflies. I write, of course, for those to whom these things appeal; there are clods alive who see nothing, or next to nothing, in spools of <b>mercerised</b> <b>cotton</b> and endless bands of paper-set pins. I write for the wise, and as I write I wonder that Kipps resisted haberdashery. He did. Yet even starting a bookshop is at least twenty times as interesting as building your own house to your own design in unlimited space and time, or any possible thing people with indisputable social position and sound securities can possibly find to do. Upon that I rest.|$|R
30|$|In view of {{the past}} {{reported}} studies, the most utilized material fabric is cotton. In some of the studies, the greigh fabric have been processed through the textile finishing processes for making a finished fabrics. Textile finishing usually involved treatments such as scouring, desizing, bleaching, mercerizing and dyeing process. Textile finishing usually involved treatments such as scouring, desizing, bleaching, mercerizing and dyeing process (Hall 1966). None reported the cotton fabric experiencing the finishing process mercerizing process. It is remarkable that the wet preparing of cotton fabrics prompts its shrinkage, expanding the yarn number, mass every unit territory, and fabric thickness (Tarbuk et al. 2014). <b>Mercerised</b> <b>cotton</b> fibre will be round and hollow rather than strip like shapes, and the cross-segments of the filaments change from kidney like to roundabout molded. The primary explanation behind this is the cotton fibre swelling amid the mercerisation process. Amid mercerization, Sodium Hyroxide (NaoH) infiltrated into the lumen of the cotton strands and swelled. Mercerizing process is the act of chemical treatment on cellulosic fibre to improve {{the properties of the}} fibre in term of tensile strength, absorption properties and also greater affinity of dyes and various chemical finishes. Mercerized cotton holds the properties of higher mass per unit area, thickness, breaking force and elongation, luster, with a change of surface charge that ensures further quality improvement and also higher adsorption of anionic auxiliaries.|$|R
5000|$|Fancy print—created by {{printing}} {{patterns on}} cloth. Unlike expensive wax prints, {{the design is}} printed {{on one side of}} the <b>cotton</b> fabric. <b>Fancy</b> prints are made in Europe, India, and West Africa. The most popular fancy print is known as the traditional print.|$|R
40|$|In this study, the {{ecological}} {{parameters of the}} effluent obtained from dyeing of scoured and <b>mercerised</b> organic <b>cotton</b> single jersey fabrics with textile reactive dyes adopting exhaust dyeing method was investigated. The dyes used include regular (Navacron H and FN) reactive dyes and low impact (Remazol and Levafix) reactive dyes along with inorganic salt (sodium sulphate) and biosalt (trisodium citrate). The ecological parameters include chemical oxygen demand (COD), biological oxygen demand (BOD) and total dossolved solids (TDS). The {{results show that the}} use of the low impact reactive dyes has greater ecological advantages as it reduces the COD, BOD and TDS of the effluent considerably. Further, the use of the biosalt in the dye bath as replacement for the inorganic salt reduces the COD and TDS value significantly but will also increase the BOD of the effluent...|$|R
5000|$|When Bowlmor Lanes {{purchased}} {{its first}} center in 1997 to renovate and upscale it, league bowling was eliminated [...] "to ease out regulars {{who did not}} <b>cotton</b> to the <b>fancy</b> trappings or the higher prices." [...] That strategy proved so successful that league bowling was not offered at the five other centers the company added, and by 2012 Bowlmor {{was one of the}} highest grossing bowling facility operators in North America.|$|R
5000|$|Shannon then {{borrowed}} $2 {{million from}} friends, family, and Bowlmor's sellers {{to transform the}} center. Changes included installation of video screens, glow in the dark lanes and balls, and lane-side food and drink service. Shannon eliminated bowling leagues, [...] "to ease out {{those who did not}} <b>cotton</b> to the <b>fancy</b> trappings or higher prices," [...] in favor of promotions and events aimed at attracting new fans to the sport. By 1999, Bowlmor Lanes Union Square was the highest-grossing bowling center in the United States. The center was closed in July 2014 when it lost its lease.|$|R
5000|$|The Charlton Mill was {{the last}} granite mill {{constructed}} in the city. It was built in 1911, with Earl P. Charlton, its principal investor, as president. Charlton was a successful businessman who had established a chain of 53 five and dime stores, and in 1912 became a co-founder of the F.W. Woolworth Company. [...] Its main building provides a marked architectural contrast to earlier mills built in Fall River by its extreme width and large windows. By 1917, it contained 55,992 spindles and 1,300 looms, for the manufacture of fine and <b>fancy</b> <b>cotton</b> goods. The company was sold in 1938, and the facility remained in textile production at least into the 1980s.|$|R
50|$|Crompton {{was brought}} up as a hand loom cotton weaver and, at an early age, learned the trade of a machinist. While {{superintendent}} of a cotton mill in Ramsbottom he made many experiments on cotton looms. He went to Taunton, Massachusetts, in 1836 and devised a loom for the manufacture of <b>fancy</b> <b>cotton</b> goods, receiving a patent on 23 November 1837 (U.S. Patent 491). In this loom {{one part of the}} warp was depressed while the other was lifted, instead of allowing one part to remain stationary, thus securing more room for the passage of the shuttle. Another feature of it was an endless loop pattern chain, which, with its peculiar apparatus, operated the warp. This allowed many more pattern sequences and made them much easier to change.|$|R
50|$|The Crompton Loom {{evolved from}} {{multiple}} acquisitions of patents throughout the 1850s and 1860s. Furbush and Crompton held multiple other patents that improved the “narrow looms”, such as double reverse motion improvements. James Greenhalgh patented the first open-shed loom in 1852, but in 1857 the patent {{was found to}} be too close to William Crompton’s power fancy loom, and therefore the Greenhalgh Loom patent was disallowed. William Crompton’s patent expired the next year, and when it did, Crompton and Furbush purchased the rights to the Greenhalgh Loom, improved it in several ways, and called it the Crompton Loom. This 1857 version of the loom would improve again, however, until it became {{one of the best in}} the world at the Paris Exhibition in 1867, and later would become the standard <b>fancy</b> <b>cotton</b> loom of the United States (around 1870).|$|R
6000|$|But revelry {{at night}} brings morning headache, {{and we did}} not set out, as agreed, at dawn. By slow degrees the grumbling, {{loitering}} party was mustered. The chiefs were Gidi Mavunga, head guide, and his son Papagayo, a dull quiet body; Chico Mpamba, [...] "French landlord" [...] of Banza Nokki, and my interpreter Nchama Chamvu. Fourteen armed moleques carried our hammocks and our little viaticum in the shape of four bottles of present-gin, two costa- finas, (= twenty-four yards of <b>fancy</b> <b>cotton),</b> and fourteen fathoms of satin-stripe, the latter a reserved fund. The boy [...] "Lendo," [...] whose appropriate name means [...] "The Go," [...] bore a burden of his own size all day, and acted as little foot-page at the halt. The [...] "gentlemen" [...] were in full travelling costume. Slung by a thong to the chief guide's left shoulder were a tiger-cat skin, cardamom-sheaths and birds' beaks and claws clustering round a something in shape like the largest German sausage, the whole ruddled with ochre: this charm must not be touched by the herd; a slave-lad, having unwittingly offended, knelt down whilst the wearer applied a dusty big toe between his eyebrows. Papagayo had a bag of grass-cloth and bits of cane, from which protruded strips of leather and scarlet broadcloth.|$|R
