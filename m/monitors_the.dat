5|$|Devised by the American {{climatologist}} and geographer C. W. Thornthwaite, {{this climate}} classification method <b>monitors</b> <b>the</b> soil water budget using evapotranspiration. It <b>monitors</b> <b>the</b> portion of total precipitation used to nourish vegetation over a certain area. It uses indices {{such as a}} humidity index and an aridity index to determine an area's moisture regime based upon its average temperature, average rainfall, and average vegetation type. The lower {{the value of the}} index in any given area, the drier the area is.|$|E

5|$|At {{the tenth}} RA I {{tropical}} cyclone committee held during 1991, it was {{recommended that the}} intensity classifications be changed ahead of the 1993–94 tropical cyclone season. Specifically {{it was decided that}} the classifications: Weak Tropical Depression, Moderate Tropical Depression and Severe Tropical Depression would be changed to Tropical Depression, Moderate Tropical Storm and Severe Tropical Storm. This change was implemented ahead of the 1993–94 tropical cyclone season. The United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center also <b>monitors</b> <b>the</b> basin, and issues warnings on significant tropical cyclones on behalf of the United States Government. These warnings use a 1-minute sustained wind speed and can be compared to the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale, however, regardless of intensity in this basin the JTWC labels all systems as tropical cyclones.|$|E
