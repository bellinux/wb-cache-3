50|$|General Vargas is {{disturbed}} {{to learn}} {{of the existence of}} the synth, recalling the artificial intelligence monsters (Finster, a deranged android, and Cochise, a malevolent AI) that he and his fellow Rangers fought years before in the original Wasteland game. He tells the recruits that they must take on Ace's original mission of installing <b>repeater</b> <b>units</b> in three radio towers in order to triangulate the location of a suspicious radio <b>message.</b> The first <b>repeater</b> is already installed; now they must go to towers in Highpool (a community based around a local dam that provides the area with water) and the Ag Center (a science commune that grows genetically modified vegetables).|$|R
40|$|In this thesis, an Interactive Video Data Service (IVDS) is developed. This service {{provides}} {{a mechanism for}} television viewers {{to interact with the}} program they are watching. Possible interactions include purchasing products from home shopping programs and requesting information from advertisers. Within the project, two areas were focused upon: channel simulation and the <b>Repeater</b> <b>Unit.</b> Additionally, the overall system was discussed along with its background. The purpose of channel simulation was to demonstrate the viability of the unique communication channel model proposed for the IVDS system. This channel was implemented using uni-directional transmissions, without acknowledgments. The <b>Repeater</b> <b>Unit</b> was designed to be a message processing system, intended to relay messages from system users to the home office. The design entailed both hardware and software. The hardware requirements were for a high level design, while the software required not only design, but implementation. iii Acknowledgments.

50|$|The SMODIM {{maintains}} a dynamic position database through player-to-player network communications. The onboard telemetry radio supports simultaneous distribution to multiple locations. The radio {{acts as a}} <b>message</b> <b>repeater</b> to overcome line of sight (LOS) interruptions. The SMODIM interfaces with distributed interactive simulation (DIS) networks using SMODIM tracking analysis and recording (SMOTAR), an advanced software suite that provides visual display and tracking of SMODIM instrumented players. GPS provides real-time position data as players are dynamically simulated, tracked and recorded over tactical maps and aerial photos for after-action review (AAR).|$|R
50|$|With the <b>repeater</b> <b>unit</b> {{installed}} in Damonta, General Vargas traces {{the signal to}} Los Angeles, and sends out a helicopter {{with a team of}} crack Rangers, including Angela Deth. The player characters listen from the Ranger base as Angela and the team follow the signal to a military base, where they are attacked and their helicopter shot down. With the signal lost, Vargas sends the player's team to Los Angeles in the hope of finding out what happened.|$|R
50|$|Things quickly get {{complicated}} as the Rangers {{are forced to}} choose between saving Highpool from raiders or the Ag Center from a lab experiment gone wrong; their choice wins them allies and acclaim from those they save, but means terrible losses for the other location (they can also fail to save both locations). Whatever happens, the Rangers install the <b>repeater</b> <b>unit</b> in one of the two sites, and Vargas says that one last repeater needs to be installed in a town called Damonta, which is tucked away behind a wall of very high radiation and past a valley occupied by suicidal, nuke-worshipping monks.|$|R
50|$|The Z-Wave chip is {{optimized}} for battery-powered devices, {{and most of}} the time remains in a power saving mode to consume less energy, waking up only to perform its function. With Z-Wave mesh networks, each device in the house bounces wireless signals around the house, which results in low power consumption, allowing devices work for years without needing to replace batteries. For Z-Wave units to be able to route unsolicited messages, they cannot be in sleep mode. Therefore, battery-operated devices are not designed as <b>repeater</b> <b>units.</b> Mobile devices, such as remote controls, are also excluded since Z-Wave assumes that all devices in the network remain in their original detected position.|$|R
40|$|The {{messages}} in this booklet {{have been heard}} by thousands of travelers to Southeast Alaska. They were prepared originally as tape recordings to be broadcast by means of <b>message</b> <b>repeater</b> systems on board the Alaska State ferries and commercial cruise vessels plying the Alaska waters of the Inside Passage. Public interest caused us to publish them in this form so they {{would be available to}} anyone on ships traveling through the Tongass country. The U. S. D. A. Forest Service, in cooperation with the State of Alaska, has developed the interpretive program for the Alaska Marine Highway (Inside Passage) because, as one of the messages says, " [...] . most of the landward view is National Forest.

50|$|The Vari-lite VL6 was {{designed}} to complement the VL5, as a simple, lightweight, cheap-to-hire, moving head spot luminaire; but did not appear on the market until mid-1994â€”almost {{two years after the}} VL5. As a Series 300 luminaire, it could be controlled either by Vari-lite Series 200 data or DMX512, via a Vari-lite Smart <b>Repeater</b> (VLSR) <b>unit.</b>|$|R
50|$|Along {{with the}} <b>repeater</b> <b>units,</b> most {{stations}} utilize duplexers. These are notch filters usually in {{an array of}} six, eight, and sometimes four units. They separate the transmitter and receiver signals from each other so one antenna and coaxial line can be utilized. While this solution is very efficient and easy to install, factors such as humidity and temperature can affect the performance of duplexers, so in most configurations a dryer is installed to keep humidity out of the duplexers and coaxial cable, along with heated buildings in which they are installed in. Excellent quality coaxial cable, connectors, and antennas must also be used, as a single-antenna is not as forgiving as a dual antenna system since any RF leakage or poor connection can greatly decay the reliability and performance of the repeater. In some applications, cables going from the repeater and duplexers must be tuned to mitigate these issues.|$|R
50|$|At the {{application}} layer, ETSI TS 104 001 provides a table-oriented data storage and command system that provides {{for not only}} smart meters and related data but for general purpose extension to other smart grid devices. ETSI TS 104 001 is {{an updated version of}} {{the application}} layer specification that incorporates enhanced security features, including AES 128 encryption, and replaces the previously ETSI GS OSG 001 version. OSGP is designed to be very bandwidth efficient, enabling it to offer high performance and low cost using bandwidth constrained media such as the power line. For example, just as SQL provide an efficient and flexible database query language for enterprise applications, OSGP provides an efficient and flexible query language for smart grid devices. As with SQL, OSGP support reading and writing of single attributes, multiple elements, or even entire tables. As another example, OSGP includes capabilities for an adaptive, directed meshing system that enables any OSGP device to serve as a <b>message</b> <b>repeater,</b> further optimizing bandwidth use by repeating only those packets that need to be repeated. OSGP also includes authentication and encryption for all exchanges to protect the integrity and privacy of data as is required in the smart grid.|$|R
50|$|Another early Ethernet product {{designed}} by API was the RL6000 Ethernet <b>Repeater.</b> This <b>unit</b> directly competed with the Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) DEREP-AA repeater, but had {{the advantages of}} being modular (allowing for fiber interfaces, Thinnet or AUI Cable interfaces) and smaller (occupying {{less than half the}} space of a DEREP-AA). Consequently, API was able to overtake DEC in sales of this product in 1984, a significant feat for a start-up in the Ethernet industry.|$|R
40|$|The Interactive Video and Data System is a {{multidisciplinary}} research project involving {{the creation of}} a means for people to interact with television and printed media without the addition of expensive hardware as required by most interactive systems available today. The IVDS system consists of a Consumer Control Unit which transmits user requests, a <b>Repeater</b> <b>Unit</b> which receives transmissions from the CCUs, and a Host System which takes appropriate actions for user demands. This thesis follows the evolution of the original CCU prototype as more capabilities are added and hardware platforms are changed, focusing on the addition of a bar code interface to the CCU. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS I would like to thank Dr. N. J. Davis for his constant encouragement and support throughout the duration of this project. I {{would also like to thank}} Dr. Midkiff and Dr. Sweeney for their support and for their time. Thanks also to IRS and the CIT for their continued funding of this project. Finally, thanks to everyone working on the IVDS project for their help. Without them, the project would be under staffed. Also, thanks to Suzanne for distracting me whenever possible. ii...|$|R
5000|$|There {{was also}} a 1 watt version used in {{conjunction}} with a vehicle mounted <b>repeater.</b> Additionally many <b>units</b> were optionally equipped with a keypad {{on the right side of}} the carry handle. This was used to send dtmf tones to the repeater to turn it on and change channels. The feature was known as [...] "steering".|$|R
40|$|An IVDS (Interactive Video Data Service) uses an {{interactive}} television system to transmit data {{to and from}} subscribers' homes. IVDS allows the viewer to interact with content provided on the television using a remote control. A typical IVDS application would be ordering an advertised product or playing along with a quiz show. The Virginia Tech Center for Wireless Telecommunications (CWT), under a contract with Interactive Return Service, Inc., is developing an IVDS system in which content is provided through the television cable system {{in the form of}} audio codes. A special remote control can detected these audio codes and query the user for input. The return path for this system is a wireless channel. The remote control contains a spread spectrum transmitter that transmits packets to a <b>Repeater</b> <b>unit</b> residing within a quarter mile of the user's home. With the popularity of the World Wide Web soaring, many companies are announcing internet appliances that will bring the content of the web to the user {{at a fraction of the}} cost of a standard personal computer. CWT has been contracted to extend the core IVDS system to provide a web browsing capability, allowing the user to browse the web with only the remote control. This thesis outlines the requirements of the IVDS Web Browser System. The different hardware design concepts are documented. The final Browser System specification is presented, as well as a board-level description of the Decoder Unit that is part of this final Browser System. Finally, a detailed description, current status, and simulation results are presented for the FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array) that serves as the controller for the Decoder Unit. i Acknowledgments I would like to thank my Dr. Nathaniel Davis, my advisor, for his guidance throughou [...] ...|$|R

40|$|With {{deeper and}} faster VLSI technologies, on-chip {{inductance}} has gained {{significance in the}} design of high-speed interconnects. This work reviews the importance of on-chip inductance, its useful effects and the associated negative drawbacks. It also gives an overview of the existing RC/RLC interconnect delay models and repeater insertion methodologies. The rapid growth in the VLSI technology has led to continuos reduction in the feature size of the VLSI devices and thus to higher levels of integration. The increased speed of on-chip circuitry has caused the time required for a signal to travel through the long onchip interconnects to become {{a significant portion of the}} total delay in a processing <b>unit.</b> <b>Repeaters</b> are now widely used to enhance the performance of these interconnects in CMOS SoC. For RC-modeled interconnects, parallel repeaters have proved to be superior to their serial counterparts. In this thesis, a Variable-Repeater Regeneration Technique (VRRT) and the associated mathematical models for the delays are presented. These models are used to confirm the speed optimality of the interconnects resulting from VRRT. The mathematical formulation is based on modeling the repeater resistance in series with the interconnect and also based on the first and second moment analysis, which takes into account the inductive effects of the interconnects. The main focus of this dissertation is to present a theory in parallel repeater modeling for repeater-insertion regeneration strategies. Hence, in order to avoid the fundamental weaknesses associated with the serial modeling of a parallel repeater, we carry out a new mathematical modeling for parallel repeater-insertion methodologies in SoC Interconnects. The proposed methodology is based on modeling the repeater pull-down resistance in parallel with the interconnect. Also, to account for the effect of interconnect inductance, two moments are used in the transfer function, as opposed to the previously reported Elmore delay models, which consider only one moment for the RC interconnects. The new parallel modeling technique is applied to both the Variable-Segment Regeneration Technique (VSRT) and Variable-Repeater Regeneration Technique. A direct consequence of this new type of modeling is an increased challenge in the mathematical modeling of the interconnects. HSpice electrical and C++/MATLAB simulations are conducted to assess the performance of the proposed optimization methodology using 0. 25 -micron CMOS technology. Simulation results show that the proposed repeater-insertion methodology can be used to optimize SoC interconnects in terms of propagation delay, and provide the VLSI/SoC designers with optimal design parameters, such as type, position and size of the repeaters, to be used for the interconnect regeneration, faster than by using the conventional HSpice simulations. Also in this dissertation, a new technique of regeneration, the Hybrid Regeneration Technique (HRT), is introduced. This technique is expected to perform better than the VSRT and VRRT, since it combines the advantages of the latter two techniques. Both the serial and parallel repeater modeling techniques are applied to HRT. Finally, a framework for a CAD tool based on the serial and parallel modeling of repeaters is presente...|$|R
