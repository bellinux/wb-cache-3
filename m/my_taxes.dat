500|$|Conway {{continued}} McConnell's line {{of attack}} on Bevin's finances, specifically the issue of delinquent taxes. While McConnell's charges involved delinquent taxes against Bevin Brothers Manufacturing, Theo Keith of Louisville's WAVE reported in June that Bevin had been late at least 10 times paying property taxes on his vacation homes in Maine and Louisiana between 2002 and 2009. He further reported in July that Bevin's company, Integrity Holdings, also had multiple past delinquency issues. In total, Keith estimated that Bevin had paid about $1,800 in penalties for late tax payments. Bevin became irritated with Keith's reporting and refused to answer questions from him at subsequent press conferences; he did not buy ads on WAVE, despite running ads on Louisville's other three network broadcast stations. The Associated Press' Adam Beam eventually reported that Bevin had paid his taxes late on 30 different occasions. In an October interview with Beam, Bevin said, [...] "Sometimes you do pay it late and you pay interest on having paid it late. But you pay the taxes. ... You do {{this all the time}} in business." [...] He added that his critics [...] "could have done just as breathless a story of all the times I paid <b>my</b> <b>taxes</b> early and gotten a discount on it." [...] He also reiterated that, as of the time of the interview, he had paid all of his taxes: [...] "Do I actually owe taxes to anyone, anywhere? The answer is no." ...|$|E
500|$|In June 2012, Hill {{was charged}} with three counts of tax fraud or failing to file taxes (Title 26 USC § 7202 Willful failure to collect or pay over tax) not tax evasion [...] on $1.8 million of income earned between 2005 and 2007. During this time she had toured as a musical artist, earned {{royalties}} from both her records and from films she had appeared in, and had owned and {{been in charge of}} multiple corporations. In a long post to her Tumblr, Hill said that she had gone [...] "underground" [...] and had rejected pop culture's [...] "climate of hostility, false entitlement, manipulation, racial prejudice, sexism and ageism." [...] She added that, [...] "When I was working consistently without being affected by the interferences mentioned above, I filed and paid <b>my</b> <b>taxes.</b> This only stopped when it was necessary to withdraw from society, in order to guarantee the safety and well-being of myself and my family." [...] On June 29, 2012, Hill appeared in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey in Newark and pleaded guilty to the charges; her attorney said she would make restitution for the back taxes she owed. By April 22, 2013, Hill had paid back only $50,000 of the $554,000 she owed immediately; U.S. Magistrate Judge Madeline Cox Arleo criticized Hill, saying [...] "This is not someone who stands before the court penniless. This is a criminal matter. Actions speak louder than words, and there has been no effort here to pay these taxes." [...] Hill also faced possible eviction from her rented home in South Orange as well as a civil lawsuit from the town for running a business out of a home without a zoning permit.|$|E

40|$|This Article builds upon a similar, lengthier {{effort that}} I {{published}} in the Tax Lawyer in 2009. While there is overlap, this Article contains much new material. Important case law and tax proposals from the House Ways and Means Committee have {{come out in the}} interim. Due to space limitations, unlike <b>my</b> <b>Tax</b> Lawyer effort, this Article attempts to avoid prolixity.

If you are not that reader, a review of <b>my</b> <b>Tax</b> Lawyer article or Professor Mann 2 ̆ 7 s article in this symposium edition will fill in the gaps. Generally speaking, I recommend repealing Subchapter S, but integrating its more legitimate benefits into Subchapter K.

2500|$|In {{response}} to [...] "Facing Facts About Race", the American writer Ta-Nehisi Coates accused Hanson {{of racism and}} stupidity. Referring to Hanson's [...] "Talk", Coates wrote: [...] "Let us be direct—in any other context we would automatically recognize this [...] "talk" [...] as stupid advice. If I were {{to tell you that}} I only employ Asian-Americans to do <b>my</b> <b>taxes</b> because [...] "Asian-Americans do better on the Math SAT," [...] you would not simply question my sensitivity, but my mental faculties. That is because you would understand that in making an individual decision, employing an ancestral class of millions is not very intelligent. Moreover, were I to tell you I wanted my son to marry a Jewish woman because [...] "Jews are really successful," [...] you would understand that statement for the stupidity which it is...There is no difference between my argument above and the notion that black boys should be avoided because they are overrepresented in the violent crime stats. But one of the effects of racism is its tendency to justify stupidity." ...|$|E
2500|$|It was {{disclosed}} that Arnault planned {{to apply for}} Belgian citizenship and was considering moving to Belgium in 2013. In April 2013, Arnault {{said that he had}} been misquoted and that he never intended to leave France: [...] "I repeatedly said that I would stay as a resident in France and that I would continue to pay <b>my</b> <b>taxes....</b> Today, I decided to remove any ambiguity. I withdraw my request of Belgian nationality. Requesting Belgian nationality was to better protect the foundation that I created with the sole purpose of ensuring the continuity and integrity of the LVMH group if I were to disappear." [...] On 10 April 2013, Arnault announced that he had decided to abandon his application for Belgian citizenship, saying he did not want the move to be misinterpreted as a measure of tax evasion at a time when France faced economic and social challenges. Arnault also stated that several employees requested to leave France for tax purposes, that he declined their requests, and that [...] "the 75% tax would not raise a lot of revenue but should prove less divisive now that it was set to be levied on firms rather than people and only due to stay in place for two years." ...|$|E
