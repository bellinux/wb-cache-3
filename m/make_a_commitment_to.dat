25|$|This {{traditional}} ceremony {{marks the}} commitment of the senior class to become active alumni of Indiana State. Historically, each senior class was charged with adding to the Parsons-Sandison Living Memorial Fund, a scholarship fund for Indiana State students.

At commencement, another ceremony is conducted. As part of this ceremony, the senior class answers the challenge of commitment, as they become alumni of the university.|$|E
500|$|A {{makeshift}} {{control room}} with tape machines, a mixing console, and other outboard equipment {{was set up}} in Danesmoate's dining room, with the adjacent drawing room used for recording and performing. The large doors separating the rooms were replaced with a glass screen, and to maintain a relaxed [...] "non-studio" [...] atmosphere for the sessions, the control room was dubbed the [...] "lyric room" [...] and the recording space was called the [...] "band room". Lanois' strategy was to encourage the band members to have their parts worked out in advance and to capture as much of the essence of a live band take as possible, without having the possibility of subsequent overdubbing to fall back on. This was a change for U2, who previously recorded each instrument separately and then layered them into the mix. To support his approach of having all the band members recording in a room together, Lanois eschewed having them wear headphones in favour of using monitor speakers due to their power; Mullen and bassist Adam Clayton used two each. To aid in sound isolation, gobos were built in the drawing room, although the production staff still faced issues with audio spill from the monitor speakers. Lanois said that due to the setup, [...] "you have to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>commitment</b> <b>to</b> what you put down and either use it or throw it all away." [...] This recording setup was duplicated at subsequent locations during the album sessions.|$|E
