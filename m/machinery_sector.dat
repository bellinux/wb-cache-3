More specifically, the paper analyzes these trade patterns, with distinctions between machinery intermediate goods and machinery final products, among trading partners (regions), between intra-regional trade and inter-regional trade, and among <b>machinery</b> <b>sectors,</b> so as to investigate whether there were any differences in reactions to the crisis. Moreover, in order to consider possible seasonality in trade, the paper also attempts to apply the X- 12 model and discusses features of trade patterns based not only on actual trade values but also on estimated trade values with seasonal adjustment. Our results demonstrate that effects of the {{global financial}} crisis on international production/distribution networks in East Asia do indeed exist but, at the same time, that East Asia’s trade has rapidly recovered through the regional production/distribution networks.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the impact of}} firm networks on Japan's national border effect. We estimate gravity equations using data on Japan's international and interregional trade in four machinery industries (electrical, general, precision and transportation machinery). The <b>machinery</b> <b>sector</b> {{is the most important}} manufacturing sector for exports and outward foreign direct investment (FDI) in Japan. By taking into account international as well as interregional firm networks, we find that ownership relations usually enhance exports from parent firms to establishment. Consequently we can explain 15 % (7 %, 1 % and 0. 5 %) of the decline in Japan's border effect from 1980 to 1995 in precision (transportation, general electrical) <b>machinery</b> <b>sector</b> by the increase of international networks. ...|$|E

To answer this question, we empirically investigate whether features of international fragmentation appear in other sectors by examining intraregional trade in East Asia.

It is argued that this approach is the most suitable for capturing the real effects of transnational activity, since foreign wages indicate the attractiveness of alternative sites for investment, production and employment. A simultaneous equations estimator is employed and, for each industry, there is evidence that both the behaviour of investment and labour demand are sensitive to foreign wage conditions.

Several econometric techniques, including the Gamma Pseudo Maximum Likelihood estimator, are used to rectify possible problems of heteroskedasticity and zero trade flows inherent in the estimation of gravity models of trade. The major finding is that outward FDI is trade enhancing for the Japanese manufacturing industry. However, we find that whether outward FDI creates or replaces trade depends on the industry under scrutiny. Our results indicate that the complementary relationship between FDI and trade is dominant in Japanese manufacturing, especially in the food and beverages, electric machinery, primary metals, and precision <b>machinery</b> <b>sectors.</b> We find also that Japanese overseas investments substitute for imports of chemical products, and for both exports and imports of general machinery...|$|R

40|$|In recent decades, the {{intensification}} of intra-regional trade within East Asia {{has been driven by}} the rapid expansion of parts and components trade notably from <b>machinery</b> <b>sector</b> and electrical machinery sub-sector. This paper examines the patterns of intra- trade in <b>machinery</b> <b>sector</b> and the linkage between parts and components trade and the regional production / distribution network led by multinational enterprises. Using international trade data and survey results on business operations of Japanese MNEs and their overseas affiliates, we found that trade patterns in East Asia has shifted towards parts and components trade. Redirection of trade flows has also been observed among East Asian countries especially for Japan and China. An investigation into micro data of Japanese MNEs reveals that parts and components trade is highly associated with fragmentation of production and back-and-forth transactions between parent companies and their affiliates located in different countries according to location advantages. Despite the highly integrated trade, East Asia has still relied on final demand outside the region. The paper suggests that it is crucial for East Asia to maintain its competitive position in the world market.

Using the micro-data of Japanese manufacturing MNEs from 1994 to 2010, {{we find that}} exports tend to respond to exchange rate changes, in particular when wholly or majority-owned affiliates are dominant among their foreign affiliates and when intra-firm trade ratios are higher.
