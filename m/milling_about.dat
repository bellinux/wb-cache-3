5|$|Napoleon {{promptly}} {{responded by}} ordering a counter-attack by the cuirassier brigades of Farine and Travers and Jaquinot's two Chevau-léger (lancer) regiments in the I Corps light cavalry division. Disorganized and <b>milling</b> <b>about</b> {{the bottom of}} the valley between Hougoumont and La Belle Alliance, the Scots Greys {{and the rest of the}} British heavy cavalry were taken by surprise by the countercharge of Milhaud's cuirassiers, joined by lancers from Baron Jaquinot's 1st Cavalry Division.|$|E
5|$|The {{left-hand}} wing {{depicts the}} Crucifixion. It shows Christ's followers grieving in the foreground, soldiers and spectators <b>milling</b> <b>about</b> in the mid-ground and a portrayal of three crucified {{bodies in the}} upper-ground. The scene is framed against an azure sky {{with a view of}} Jerusalem in the distance. The right-hand wing portrays scenes associated with the Last Judgement: a hellscape at its base, the resurrected awaiting judgement in the centre-ground, and a representation of Christ in Majesty flanked by a Great Deësis of saints, apostles, clergy, virgins and nobility in the upper section. Portions of the work contain Greek, Latin and Hebrew inscriptions. The original gilt frames contain Biblical passages in Latin drawn from the books of Isaiah, Deuteronomy and Revelation. According to a date written in Russian on their reverse, the panels were transferred to canvas supports in 1867.|$|E
25|$|At {{the same}} time some of the Spanish ships were still a {{presence}} {{off the coast of}} England; <b>milling</b> <b>about</b> in confusion without being able to make any harbour. Eventually with a wind astern, the order was given by Brochero to head back to Spain and they sailed back in disorder to Corunna.|$|E

25|$|From {{the mid-1980s}} onwards, pubs and karaoke bars like Babylon and Inner Circle started to sprout up along Tanjong Pagar. Sizable groups {{of gay men}} could be seen <b>milling</b> <b>about</b> outside these establishments {{especially}} on weekends. This, along with cruising activity at nearby Ann Siang Hill and the surrounding back alleys would eventually come to give Tanjong Pagar Road {{the reputation of being}} Singapore's gay quarter.|$|E
25|$|Swarm {{behaviour}} is {{a collective}} behaviour exhibited by animals of similar size which aggregate together, perhaps <b>milling</b> <b>about</b> {{the same spot}} or perhaps migrating in some direction. Swarm behaviour is commonly exhibited by insects, but it also occurs in the flocking of birds, the schooling of fish and the herd behaviour of quadrupeds. It is a complex emergent behaviour that occurs when individual agents follow simple behavioral rules.|$|E
25|$|Having taken casualties, {{and still}} trying to reorder {{themselves}}, the Scots Greys {{and the rest of}} the Union Brigade found themselves before the main French lines. Their horses were blown, and they were still in disorder without any idea of what their next collective objective was. Some attacked nearby gun batteries of the Grande Battery, dispersing or sabring the gunners. Disorganized and <b>milling</b> <b>about</b> the bottom of the valley between Hougoumont and La Belle Alliance, the Scots Greys {{and the rest of the}} British heavy cavalry were taken by surprise by the counter-charge of Milhaud's cuirassiers, joined by lancers from Baron Jaquinot's 1st Cavalry Division.|$|E

25|$|Swarm behaviour, or swarming, is a {{collective}} behaviour exhibited by entities, particularly animals, of similar size which aggregate together, perhaps <b>milling</b> <b>about</b> {{the same spot}} or perhaps moving en masse or migrating in some direction. It is a highly interdisciplinary topic. As a term, swarming is applied particularly to insects, but can also be applied to any other entity or animal that exhibits swarm behaviour. The term flocking or 'murmuration' are usually used to refer specifically to swarm behaviour in birds, herding to refer to swarm behaviour in quadrupeds, shoaling or schooling to refer to swarm behaviour in fish. Phytoplankton also gather in huge swarms called blooms, although these organisms are algae and are not self-propelled the way animals are. By extension, the term swarm is applied also to inanimate entities which exhibit parallel behaviours, as in a robot swarm, an earthquake swarm, or a swarm of stars.|$|E
25|$|Having {{broken through}} the barrier, the truck, driving in a zigzag fashion, knocked down random {{members of the}} crowd <b>milling</b> <b>about</b> on the {{pavement}} and in the three traffic lanes on the seaward side of the Promenade. The driver tried {{to stay on the}} pavement—returning to the traffic lanes only when blocked by a bus shelter or pavilion—thus increasing the number of deaths. After reaching the Hotel Negresco, the progress of the truck, already travelling more slowly, was further slowed down by a passing cyclist, whose attempts to open the cabin door were abandoned after being threatened with a gun through the window; followed by a motorcyclist, in pursuit from the Centre Universitaire Méditerranéen, who threw his scooter under the front wheels of the truck at the intersection with rue Meyerbeer, striking blows at the driver from the running board before being struck with the butt of the driver's gun, suffering moderate injuries from falling off the truck's side. The driver fired several shots at police from his 7.65mm firearm, close to the Hotel Negresco, as police arrived; they returned fire with their 9mm Sig Sauer handguns, gave chase to the vehicle and attempted to disable it.|$|E
500|$|By {{this time}} fully awake, Frederick {{hoped that the}} battle could be {{retrieved}} {{and returned to the}} village to take command. [...] At 7:00, finding his infantry <b>milling</b> <b>about</b> in the village, Frederick ordered them to advance, sending reinforcements commanded by Prince Francis of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel, his brother-in-law, with them. [...] As Francis approached the village, Austrian cannon-fire sheared his head off his shoulders; his troops faltered, demoralized by the sight of the prince's headless body atop his spooked horse. Frederick himself helped to rally Francis' shaken troops.|$|E
50|$|There was a tower <b>mill</b> <b>about</b> 600 yd {{northwest}} of the village. By the 1970s it was derelict but the tower has since been restored {{as part of a}} private house.|$|R
50|$|George Chrisman House is a {{historic}} home located near Linville, Rockingham County, Virginia. It was built about 1787, and is a two-story, three bay, stone Federal style dwelling with flanking wings.

500|$|They are {{vulnerable}} to attack while watering but {{with a large number}} of birds <b>milling</b> <b>about,</b> predators find it difficult to select a target bird and are likely to have been spotted before they can get close to the flock. The choice of a watering site is influenced by the topography of the nearby ground. The sandgrouse tend to avoid sites with cover for mammalian predators and their greatest risk is usually from predatory birds. Sandgrouse travel tens of miles to their traditional water holes and tend to disregard temporary water sources which may appear periodically. This probably has a survival value because a dried up water source in an arid region could result in dehydration and death. The Burchell's sandgrouse in the Kalahari Desert sometimes travels over [...] daily to reach a water source. Not all species need to drink every day, and the Tibetan sandgrouse does not need to travel to drink because of the abundance of water from melting snowfields in its habitat.|$|E

50|$|Ralph Turner and Lewis Killian {{put forth}} {{the idea that}} norms emerge from within the crowd. Emergent norm theory states that crowds have little unity at their outset, but {{during a period of}} <b>milling</b> <b>about,</b> key members suggest {{appropriate}} actions, and following members fall in line, forming the basis for the crowd's norms.|$|E

50|$|Then in 1995, Beijing's Central Academy of Fine Arts (CAFA), {{looking for}} cheap, ample {{workshop}} space away from downtown, {{set up in}} the now defunct Factory 706.

The cluttered sculpture workshops have always remained open for visitors to peek at the dozens of workers <b>milling</b> <b>about.</b>|$|E
