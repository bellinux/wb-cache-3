25|$|The {{resolution}} of a multimeter is often {{specified in the}} number of decimal digits resolved and displayed. If the <b>most</b> <b>significant</b> <b>digit</b> cannot take all values from 0 to 9 it is generally, and confusingly, termed a fractional digit. For example, a multimeter which can read up to 19999 (plus an embedded decimal point) is said to read 4½ digits.|$|E
25|$|Big-endianness may be {{demonstrated}} by writing a decimal number, say one hundred twenty-three, on {{paper in the}} usual positional notation understood by a numerate reader: 123. The digits are written starting from the left and to the right, with the <b>most</b> <b>significant</b> <b>digit,</b> 1, written first. This {{is analogous to the}} lowest address of memory being used first. This {{is an example of a}} big-endian convention taken from daily life.|$|E
25|$|We {{can assume}} that as we write text left to right, we are {{increasing}} the 'address' on paper, as a processor would write bytes with increasing memory addresses − as in the adjacent table. On paper, the hex value 0a0b0c0d (written 168496141 in usual decimal notation) is big-endian style since we write the <b>most</b> <b>significant</b> <b>digit</b> first and the rest follow in decreasing significance. Mapping this number as a binary value to a sequence of 4 bytes in memory in big-endian style also writes the bytes {{from left to right}} in decreasing significance: 0Ah at +0, 0Bh at +1, 0Ch at +2, 0Dh at +3.|$|E

Auto-ranging meters usually include a facility to hold the meter to a particular range, because a measurement that causes frequent range changes can be distracting to the user.|$|R

There are many alternative methods.|$|E
2500|$|Benford's law, {{also called}} the first-digit law, is an {{observation}} about the frequency distribution of leading digits in many real-life sets of numerical data. The law states that in many naturally occurring collections of numbers, the leading significant digit {{is likely to be}} small. For example, in sets that obey the law, the number [...] appears as the <b>most</b> <b>significant</b> <b>digit</b> about 30% of the time, while [...] appears as the <b>most</b> <b>significant</b> <b>digit</b> less than 5% of the time. By contrast, if the digits were distributed uniformly, they would each occur about 11.1% of the time. Benford's law also makes predictions about the distribution of second digits, third digits, digit combinations, and so on.|$|E
2500|$|It can be {{required}} that the <b>most</b> <b>significant</b> <b>digit</b> of the significand of a non-zero number be non-zero (except when the corresponding exponent would be smaller than the minimum one).

For binary formats (which uses only the digits [...] and [...] ) this non-zero digit is necessarily [...] Therefore, it {{does not need to}} be represented in memory; allowing the format to have one more bit of precision.

2500|$|A signed (meaning {{negative}} or non-negative) digit string {{of a given}} length in a given base (or radix). This digit string {{is referred to as}} the significand, mantissa, or coefficient. The length of the significand determines the precision to which numbers can be represented. [...] The radix point position is assumed always to be somewhere within the significand—often just after or just before the <b>most</b> <b>significant</b> <b>digit,</b> or to the right of the rightmost (least significant) digit. [...] This article generally follows the convention that the radix point is set just after the most significant (leftmost) digit.|$|E
2500|$|By convention, if the <b>most</b> <b>significant</b> <b>digit</b> can {{be either}} 0 or 1, it is termed a half-digit; if it can take higher values without {{reaching}} 9 (often 3 or 5), it may be called three-quarters of a digit. A 5½ digit multimeter would display one [...] "half digit" [...] that could only display 0 or 1, followed by five digits taking all values from 0 to 9. Such a meter could show positive or negative values from 0 to 199,999. A 3¾ digit meter can display a quantity from 0 to 3,999 or 5,999, depending on the manufacturer.|$|E
2500|$|Radix sort is an {{algorithm}} that sorts numbers by processing individual digits. n numbers {{consisting of}} k digits each are sorted in O(n · k) time. [...] Radix sort can process digits of each number either {{starting from the}} least significant digit (LSD) or starting from the <b>most</b> <b>significant</b> <b>digit</b> (MSD). [...] The LSD algorithm first sorts the list by the least significant digit while preserving their relative order using a stable sort. Then it sorts them by the next digit, and so on from the least significant to the most significant, ending up with a sorted list. While the LSD radix sort {{requires the use of}} a stable sort, the MSD radix sort algorithm does not (unless stable sorting is desired). [...] In-place MSD radix sort is not stable. [...] It is common for the counting sort algorithm to be used internally by the radix sort. [...] A hybrid sorting approach, such as using insertion sort for small bins improves performance of radix sort significantly.|$|E

Additional bands have meanings which may vary from one type to another. Low-tolerance capacitors may begin with the first 3 (rather than 2) digits of the value. It is usually, but not always, possible to work out what scheme is used by the particular colors used. Cylindrical capacitors marked with bands may look like resistors.|$|R

The lower nibble of the rightmost byte is usually used as the sign flag, although some unsigned representations lack a sign flag.

40|$|A novel {{optoelectronic}} quotient-selected modified signed-digit division {{technique is}} proposed.

50|$|A <b>most</b> <b>{{significant}}</b> <b>digit</b> (MSD) radix sort {{can be used}} to sort keys in lexicographic order. Unlike a least {{significant digit}} (LSD) radix sort, a <b>most</b> <b>significant</b> <b>digit</b> radix sort does not necessarily preserve the original order of duplicate keys. An MSD radix sort starts processing the keys from the <b>most</b> <b>significant</b> <b>digit,</b> leftmost digit, to the least significant digit, rightmost digit. This sequence is opposite that of least significant digit (LSD) radix sorts. An MSD radix sort stops rearranging the position of a key when the processing reaches a unique prefix of the key. Some MSD radix sorts use one level of buckets in which to group the keys. See the counting sort and pigeonhole sort articles. Other MSD radix sorts use multiple levels of buckets, which form a trie or a path in a trie. A postman's sort / postal sort is a kind of MSD radix sort.|$|E
50|$|A Least {{significant}} digit (LSD) Radix sort is a fast stable sorting algorithm {{which can be}} used to sort keys in integer representation order.

40|$|In many {{different}} topics, the <b>most</b> <b>significant</b> <b>digits</b> of data series display a non-uniform distribution which {{points to an}} equiprobability of logarithms. This surprising ubiquitous property, known as the <b>significant</b> <b>digit</b> law, is shown here to follow from two similar, albeit different, scale symmetries: the scale-invariance and the scale-ratio invariance. After having legitimized these symmetries in the present context, the corresponding symmetric distributions are determined by implementing a covariance criterion. The logarithmic distribution is identified as the only distribution satisfying both symmetries. Attraction of other distributions to this most symmetric distribution by dilation, stretching and merging is investigated and clarified. The natures of both the scale-invariance and the scale-ratio invariance are further analyzed by determining {{the structure of the}} sets composed by the corresponding symmetric distributions. Altogether, these results provide new insights into the meaning and the role of scale symmetries in statistics.

40|$|Summary. Starting from coding-theoretic constructions, {{we build}} digital nets with good figures of merit, where {{the figure of}} merit {{takes into account the}} equidistribution of a {{preselected}} set of low-dimensional projections. This type of figure of merit {{turns out to be a}} better predictor than the t-value for the variance of randomized quasi-Monte Carlo (RQMC) estimators based on nets, for certain classes of integrals. Our construction method determines the <b>most</b> <b>significant</b> <b>digits</b> of the points by exploiting the equivalence between the desired equidistribution properties used in our criterion and the property of a related point set to be an orthogonal array, and using existing orthogonal array constructions. The least <b>significant</b> <b>digits</b> are then adjusted to improve the figure of merit. Known results on orthogonal arrays provide bounds on the best possible figure of merit that can be achieved. We present a concrete construction that belongs to the class of cyclic digital nets and we provide numerical illustrations of how it can reduce the variance of a RQMC estimator, compared with more standard constructions. ...|$|R
50|$|A {{leading zero}} is any 0 digit that comes {{before the first}} nonzero digit in a number string in {{positional}} notation. For example, James Bond's famous identifier, 007, has two leading zeros. When leading zeros occupy the <b>most</b> <b>significant</b> <b>digits</b> of an integer, they could be left blank or omitted for the same numeric value. Therefore, the usual decimal notation of integers does not use leading zeros except for the zero itself, which would be denoted as an empty string otherwise. However, in decimal fractions strictly between −1 and 1, the leading zeros digits between the decimal point and the first nonzero digit are necessary for conveying the magnitude of a number and cannot be omitted, while trailing zeroes- zeroes occurring after the decimal point and after the last nonzero digit- can be omitted without changing the meaning.|$|R
