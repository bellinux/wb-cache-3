60|$|I {{have spoken}} {{here of the}} {{privilege}} which an English author enjoys by reason of the ever-widening circle of readers to whom he writes. I should have said the writers of English literature, seeing that the privilege is of course shared by the American writer. I profess my belief that in the States an English author has an advantage over one of that country merely in the fact of his being English, as a French milliner has undoubtedly an advantage in her nationality, let her merits or demerits as a milliner be what they may. I think that English books are better liked because they are English. But I {{do not know that}} there is any feeling with us either for or against an author because he is American. I believe that Longfellow stands in our judgment exactly where he would have stood had he been a tutor at a college in Oxford instead of a Professor at Cambridge in Massachusetts. Prescott is read among us as a historian without any reference as to his nationality, and by many, as I take it, in absolute ignorance of his nationality. Hawthorne, the novelist, is quite as well known in England as he is in his own country. But I do not know that to either of these three is awarded any favor or is denied any justice because he is an American. Washington Irving published many of his works in this country, receiving very large sums for them from Mr. Murray, and I fancy that in dealing with his publisher he found neither advantage nor disadvantage in his nationality; that is, of course, advantage or disadvantage as respected the light in which his works would be regarded. It must be admitted that there is no jealousy in the States against English authors. I {{think that there is a}} feeling in their favor, but no one can at any rate allege that there is a feeling against them: I think I may also assert on the part of my own country that there is no jealousy here against American authors. As regards the tastes of the people, the works of each country flow freely through the other. That is as it should be. But when we come to the <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> <b>supply,</b> things are not exactly as they should be; and I do not believe that any one will contradict me when I say that the fault is with the Americans.|$|E

This holds regardless {{of the degree of}} trade liberalization and of the <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> <b>supply.</b> However, if the pre-trade environment is characterized by a free-entry equilibrium, then service trade liberalization is not necessarily welfare improving. It is welfare enhancing if the trade liberalization is full and the <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> <b>supply</b> is cross-border.

40|$|International trade {{agreements}} increasingly constrain {{the ability of}} governments to use trade policies. Fewer international constraints apply {{to the use of}} investment policies, although there is discussion about negotiating such disciplines both regionally and multilaterally. Since firms compete in foreign markets via both exports and foreign direct investment(FDI), the following question arises: can constraints on the use of only one type of policy (trade or FDI) induce firms to adopt inefficient modes of supply when serving foreign markets? We address this question in a model in which a local and a foreign firm compete in the domestic market. In the model, the domestic government's trade and/or FDI policies as well as the foreign firm's choice between exports and FDI are endogenous. We show that even if the domestic government is constrained only in its ability to use trade (FDI) policy, and is free to set its FDI (trade) policy, the foreign firm chooses the efficient <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> <b>supply.</b> The key point is that it is never {{in the interest of the}} domestic government to set policies in a manner that leads the foreign firm to adopt an inefficient <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> <b>supply.</b> ...|$|E

40|$|International {{trade in}} {{educational}} services has grown substantially {{over the past}} decades. Now it is a billion dollar industry including recruitment of international students, establishment of university campuses abroad, franchised provision and on line education. WTO requires each member nation to make its own schedule of commitments in education services, and to explain its limitations on market access and national treatment {{as well as other}} limitations. In the schedules of commitments, commitments are split into two sections: First, “horizontal” commitments which stipulate limitations that apply to all of the sectors included in the schedule; these often refer to a particular <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> <b>supply,</b> notably commercial presence and the presence of natural persons. Any evaluation of sector-specific commitments must therefore take the horizontal entries into account.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to empirically {{investigate}} the relationship between cross border trade in services (Mode 1) and commercial presence in services (Mode 3). I postulate that these two <b>modes</b> <b>of</b> <b>supply</b> facilitate each other, and that, in contrast to the manufacturing sector, this complementarity might occur even at the level of horizontal investment. For the empirical analysis I make use of bilateral data on US majority-owned foreign affiliate operations (MOFAs). The same exercise is carried for the case of goods sectors. After using two different estimating techniques, results confirm the intuition, not only Mode 1 and Mode 3 in services are complements but also the complementarity relationship is stronger than that found in the case of goods. Moreover, the complementarity between this two <b>modes</b> <b>of</b> <b>supply,</b> for the case of services, is also found at the level of horizontal FDI. international trade in services; <b>modes</b> <b>of</b> supply; FDI...|$|R
40|$|According to the GATS, {{services}} can be traded through four different <b>modes</b> <b>of</b> <b>supply,</b> namely, cross border supply, consumption abroad, commercial presence, and movement of natural persons, termed modes 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively. There is much evidence to indicate interdependence across these four modes in services trade. There are essentially {{two types of}} linkages, namely, positive and negative linkages, across the various <b>modes</b> <b>of</b> <b>supply.</b> Positive linkages {{take the form of}} (i) complementarities across modes, where one or more mode is simultaneously used for providing the service across borders; and (ii) facilitation across modes, where trade through one mode creates conditions that are conducive for trading through other modes. Negative linkages take the form of (i) substitution across modes, where trade through one mode is substituted by another; (ii) restrictions on one mode which affect trade through other <b>modes</b> <b>of</b> <b>supply</b> and distort the way in which a service is trade; and (iii) restrictions which apply across multiple modes and constrain several modes simultaneously. In addition to these first order linkages, there are also extended spillover effects across the modes that arise indirectly over the medium and long run. This paper discusses the various kinds of linkages that are found in service sector trade, using evidence from companies, countries, and surveys and {{from a wide range of}} services. The objective is to provide an integrated perspective on service sector trade and related multilateral negotiations under the GATS so that countries can better leverage cross modal and cross-subsectoral trade opportunities, address constraints in a holistic manner, and maximize the overall gains from services trade. ...|$|R
40|$|This study {{analyses}} how {{domestic regulation}} affects {{trade in services}} through commercial presence {{and to what extent}} regulation, level and heterogeneity, has an impact on the choice <b>of</b> <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> servicing a foreign market for total services, financial services, transport, communication, computer, and other business services. Regulatory heterogeneity is found to have a relatively large impact on trade through commercial presence. If all countries in the sample harmonized or recognized each other’s regulation, total services trade through commercial presence could increase by between 13 and 30 % depending on the country. The study also assesses what determines services suppliers’ choice <b>of</b> <b>mode.</b> <b>Modes</b> <b>of</b> <b>supply</b> are found to be complementary to various degrees. Commercial presence is more dominant the more similar a country pair is as far as regulation and business environment are concerned and countries sharing a common language are more likely to trade through commercial presence. For some sectors it is found that the disadvantage of remoteness is amplified by strict regulation. In most services sectors trade liberalisation generates meaningful market access only if commercial presence is allowed. Furthermore, absence of explicit barriers to trade and investment is not necessarily sufficient to attract foreign investors. regulatory reforms, trade in services, regulatory harmonization, <b>modes</b> <b>of</b> <b>supply...</b>|$|R
40|$|From the {{viewpoint}} of GATS, challenges emerging from Mode 4 of supply are two pronged – measurement of value of services delivered through Mode 4 and statistical record of movement of persons to deliver services. The existing reporting system in India provides information on the purpose of transactions; the modes of supply of services are not considered. However, based {{on the nature of}} delivery of services, these can be broadly identified under specific modes of supply. Some measurement of <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> <b>supply</b> is possible in respect of software services. Onsite software exports – services performed at the site in the host country – which account for 41 per cent of the value of exports, would involve delivery either through natural movement of persons or through contractual employment of residents of the host country. An important issue emerging from the Indian experience is that proper identification and classification of remittances repatriated by the migrant workers would be crucial under the GATS to assess the services delivered through Mode 4. In case of countries where a significant share of migrant workers is constituted by unskilled/semi-skille...|$|E
40|$|It {{has become}} {{increasingly}} clear that the services negotiations under the Doha Development Agenda will not produce significant improvements on current commitments unless major new impetus is provided.

Despite the substantial benefits that may be associated with the liberalization of services trade, the GATS has obviously not yet lived up to ambitious expectations. While the ongoing services negotiations provide an opportunity to complement the rule-making efforts of the Uruguay Round with genuine market opening, many governments apparently have found it difficult, despite generally more restrictive access regimes and, thus, potentially higher gains from liberalization than in merchandise trade, to undertake or envisage economically significant bindings across a broad range of services.
