40|$|The large {{vacuum vessel}} of the J. E. T. (Joint European Torus) {{experiment}} {{has been designed}} as an all metal composite torus of non-circular cross-section. To comply with mechanical stability and ultra high vacuum requirements it has been designed as a completely welded fabrication. The metal structure consists of 32 rigid and wedge-shaped sections (equal in number to the B TOR field coils) which in turn are joined together by parallel bellows to form a torus. The rigid sectors are of box type construction suitably ribbed to withstand the stresses imposed upon them by the external forces. The bellows linking these rigid sectors determine the electrical resistance of the metallic vacuum vessel the long way around the torus, since currents which are induced in parallel with the plasma current should be kept as low as possible. All forces acting on the vacuum vessel are absorbed by the rigid sectors which also incorporate the openings to {{the interior of the}} machine, such as ports for pumping, diagnostics, auxiliary plasma heating, etc [...] . This toroidal vacuum vessel has been designed as a double walled structure with the bellows linking the rigid sectors being fitted as pairs, and it is proposed to circulate hot inert gas through out this interspace in order to raise the temperature of the whole vacuum vessel to 500 °C to achieve bakeout conditions which will assist in reaching the required base pressure of 10 - 10 torr. In order to protect external apparatus from this bakeout temperature the outside of the vacuum vessel will be thermally insulated. Much consideration has been given to the choice of materials from which to construct this vacuum vessel. Stress conditions at elevated temperatures and electrical requirements indicate {{that one of the most}} suitable materials would be in the high content nickel alloy range. The final choice was to use Inconel 600 (a trade name of Huntington Alloys, USA) or Nicrofer 7216 (a trade name of Vereinigte Deutsche Metallwerke FRG) for the rigid sectors and Inconel 625 (Nicrofer 6020) for the bellows, the latter material having the required electrical resistivity. The horizontal ports lying on the equitorial plane are connected to pumping boxes which in turn form locations for the turbo molecular and cryopumps. They also provide maximum access to the interior of the vacuum vessel for the beams of energetic neutral particles proposed for additional plasma heating. The vacuum vessel has been so designed that all the stresses are taken by the rigid sectors, whilst the radial inward directed forces are transmitted to and supported by a <b>modular</b> <b>restraint</b> <b>ring</b> which acts as an arch type of structure transmitting pressure forces of 100 tons between adjacent rigid sectors. The forces acting on the vacuum vessel are due to the atmospheric pressure during normal operation and during bakeout operations at 500 °C, the electro magnetic forces due to eddy currents which are induced in the metallic structure when the magnetic fluxes linking the vacuum vessel change with time, and the thermal stresses arising for expansion of the vacuum vessel during the baking and during experimental operation...|$|E

LRIP 22 includes upgrades such as the UIK and enhanced Automatic Fire Extinguishing System (AFES). Reset work also adds Engineering Change Proposals (ECPs) that include acoustic signature reduction (muffler), <b>Modular</b> Ammunition <b>Restraint</b> System (MARS) ammunition storage, and some Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) relocation.|$|R
40|$|The {{constraint}} {{ring test}} {{is widely used}} to assess the cracking potential for early-age cementitious materials. In this paper, the analytical expressions based on elastic mechanism are presented to estimate the residual stresses of the restrained mortar ring by considering the comprehensive effects of hydration heat, autogenous and drying shrinkage, creeping, and restraint. In the present analytical method, the stress field of the restrained ring is treated as the superposition of those caused by hydration heat, external restraint, autogenous and drying shrinkage, and creep. The factors including the properties of materials, environmental parameters such as relative humidity and temperature, the geometry effect of specimen, and the relative constraint effects of steel ring to mortar ring, are taken into account to predict the strain development with age of mortar. The temperature of the ring, the elastic modulus, the creep strain, and the split tensile strength are measured to validate the model. The age of cracking is predicted by comparing the estimated maximum tensile stress of the restrained mortar ring with the measured split tensile strength of specimen. The suitability of the present analytical method is assessed by comparing with the <b>restraint</b> <b>ring</b> test and a soundly good agreement is observed...|$|R
50|$|A {{number of}} {{carbohydrate}} validation web services {{are available at}} glycosciences.de (including nomenclature checks and linkage checks by pdb-care, and cross-validation with Mass Spectrometry data {{through the use of}} GlycanBuilder), whereas the CCP4 suite currently distributes Privateer, which is a tool that is integrated into the model building and refinement process itself. Privateer is able to check stereo- and regio-chemistry, ring conformation and puckering, linkage torsions, and real-space correlation against positive omit density, generating aperiodic torsion <b>restraints</b> on <b>ring</b> bonds, which can be used by any refinement software {{in order to maintain the}} monosaccharide's minimal energy conformation.|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the elastic buckling of circular plates with an internal elastic ring support and elastically restrained edge against translation. The classical plate theory is used to derive the governing differential equation for circular plate with internal elastic ring support and flexible edge support system. This work presents the existence of buckling mode switching with respect to the radius of internal elastic ring support. The buckling mode may not be axisymmetric as previously assumed. The plate may buckle in an axisymmetric mode in general, but when the radius of the ring support becomes small, the plate may buckle in an asymmetric mode. The cross-over ring support radius varies from 0. 1255 to 0. 09371 times the plate radius, depending on the translational stiffness of the elastic restraint at the edges and elastic <b>restraint</b> of the <b>ring</b> support. The optimum radius of the internal elastic ring support is also determined. Extensive data is tabulated so that pertinent conclusions can be arrived at on the influence of translational restraints, Poisson’s ratio, and other boundary conditions on the buckling of uniform isotropic circular plates. The numerical results obtained are in good agreement with the previously published data...|$|R
30|$|Probably {{the best}} example of a custom made {{structural}} testing facility which is currently available for large-scale non-standard structural fire testing is the CERIB-Promethée testing facility in Epernon, France. This facility has been operational since 2008 (Robert et al. 2009), and was developed to expand existing standard fire tests, to incorporate boundary conditions which would occur due to restraint and interaction between hot and cold zones in a real fire in a real building, and to provide validation data for thermo-mechanical simulations of real structures during fire. The facility essentially consists of a gas-fired furnace with integrated mechanical loading frames that can reproduce interactions between the parts of the structure under testing and those that are unexposed. The furnace measures 6 m × 4 m × 2.5 m (adjustable to 4.1 m), although a specimen length of 10 m can be installed due to the <b>modular</b> furnace construction. <b>Restraint</b> and structural interactions are simulated via multi directional loading using an array of 29 hydraulic jacks with loading capacities up to 3 MN. These jacks can be actively controlled by coupling to numerical analysis of the full structure in real time (although it is not clear if this has yet been accomplished in practice). The furnace is heated by 16 gas burners and is capable of simulating various standard fires including ISO 834 (ISO 1999) and hydrocarbon curves (CEN 2002). Despite the capabilities of this furnace, it appears that relatively few of these capabilities have yet been used to produce publishable scientific outputs, likely because the current prescriptive SFE regulatory framework effectively discourages investment in rational testing.|$|R
