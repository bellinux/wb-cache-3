25|$|For the Norton Bavant Chalk Downland Edge, the 'character' of {{this area}} {{encompasses}} three distinctive, steeply sloping hills (Middle Hill, Scratchbury Hill, and Cotley Hill), which form a distinct and somewhat isolated unit of Chalk Downland Edge. The hills are covered with long fields, which are predominantly arable, with occasional patches of rough remnant chalk grassland and scrub situated {{on the top of}} the hills. Many chalk grassland slopes in England show the mark of centuries of grazing by sheep, the slopes bearing a stepped or striped appearance formed by a mixture of soil creep and sheep paths, and such erosion is visible on the slopes of Scratchbury Hill. Regular patches and belts of mixed woodland populate parts of the lower slopes. Imber <b>military</b> <b>range</b> perimeter paths run across the top of the hills, providing public access to the area.|$|E
25|$|The San Elizario Salt War, {{also known}} as the Salinero Revolt or the El Paso Salt War, was an {{extended}} and complex political, social and <b>military</b> <b>range</b> war over ownership and control of immense salt lakes {{at the base of the}} Guadalupe Mountains of West Texas. What began in 1866 as a political and legal struggle among Anglo Texan politicians and capitalists gave rise to an armed struggle waged in 1877 by the ethnic Mexican inhabitants living in the communities on both sides of the Rio Grande near El Paso, Texas against a leading politician, supported by the Texas Rangers. The struggle climaxed with the siege and surrender of 20 Texas Rangers to a popular army of perhaps 500 men in the town of San Elizario, Texas. The arrival of the African-American 9th Cavalry and a sheriff's posse of New Mexico mercenaries caused hundreds of Tejanos to flee to Mexico, some in permanent exile. The right of individuals to own the salt lakes previously held as a community asset was established by force of arms.|$|E
40|$|The <b>military</b> <b>ranges</b> in Flanders are, as well {{as being}} centres of {{national}} defence, also landscape complexes with interesting histories. In particular the extensive heathland areas in the Antwerp and Limburg Campine area combine biodiversity with important landscape components. The transformation of these heathlands into <b>military</b> <b>ranges,</b> during the 19 th century, ensured that these areas escaped industrial and residential development. Thus the <b>military</b> <b>ranges</b> are in effect fossilized landscapes from a period in which the pressure on the surrounding area was very high. The absence of largescale impacts on the <b>military</b> <b>ranges</b> since the 19 th century raises the potential for the survival of undamaged archaeological deposits and evidence of historic land use. This paper presents the study of twelve <b>military</b> <b>ranges</b> in Flanders and their historic landscape and archaeological value. The study is part of a European program of nature restoration called LIFE. Within this program the DANAH project was set up by the Ministry of Defence and the Agency for Nature and Forests to concentrate on development and management of mainly heathland landscapes in twelve <b>military</b> <b>ranges</b> in Flanders. The primary goal is to obtain a workable balance between military activity and nature development...|$|R

25|$|Gifford {{said that}} Widlar and Talbert were {{actually}} {{the founders of}} National Semiconductor, and that Sporck joined them later. The duo started by setting up the epitaxial process at Santa Clara. Once the technology was in place, Widlar concentrated on voltage regulators {{and by the end}} of 1966 produced the industry's first integrated linear regulator. The LM100, a revolutionary new circuit, became another flagship product that surpassed expectations for sales and longevity. In 1967 Widlar designed the LM101, an operational amplifier with improved gain, decreased input current, and protection against short circuit. The LM101 featured another unorthodox input stage, employing NPN input transistors emitter coupled to PNP transistors in a common base arrangement. The high reverse breakdown voltage of the PNP transistors allowed the LM101 to withstand a differential input voltage of ±30 V. Its frequency compensation was simpler and more robust and stable than that of μA709. It was followed by LM101A, a functionally identical IC that pioneered the use of a field-effect transistor to control internal current sources. Widlar's solution minimized die area and current drain, and enabled operation over a wide range of power supply voltages. Later he devised another new device, the super-beta transistor. It was created in silicon by Talbert and integrated in the LM108 precision operational amplifier, which was released in 1969. These high-gain, very-low-voltage devices were capable of operating at very low input currents within the full <b>military</b> <b>range</b> of operating conditions. The items in the linear circuit product line were user friendly, very useful, and very profitable.|$|E

40|$|Cyclic nitramines {{released}} into all environmental compartments through anthropogenic activities are toxic and possibly carcinogenic and mutagenic. Soils on <b>military</b> <b>ranges,</b> located {{throughout the world}} in various climatic regions and close to human activities, are especially susceptible to cyclic nitramine contamination. The properties of soils on <b>military</b> <b>ranges</b> will directly affect the cyclic nitramine contamination and biodegradation; however, studies {{in this area are}} limited. Previous related research was mainly focused on monitoring the temporal and spatial changes in nitrate explosive concentrations and various in situ and ex situ remediation techniques. Anaerobic biodegradation of cyclic nitramines in soils is scarce, but appears to be a more efficient means of bioremediation than aerobic techniques; however, most published research has not been applied in situ as there are numerous hindrances to applications in the field. The present research therefore aims to study the feasibility of ruminal bioremediation as an inexpensive, ecologically conscious, and viable means to remediate soils on <b>military</b> <b>ranges</b> contaminated with cyclic nitramines by (1) determining if RDX degradation in whole ovine rumen fluid occurs and isolating an...|$|R
