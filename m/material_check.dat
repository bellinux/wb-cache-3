40|$|Tryptophan {{is one of}} the 20 {{amino acids}} that link {{together}} to form proteins. For humans it is an essential amino acid, we must get it from our diet since we cannot synthesize it. E. coli bacterial cells, however, can synthesize the amino acid tryptophan when it is not provided from the environment (e. g. the gut where it lives). It would be wasteful to synthesize tryptophan when it is readily available in the environment so E. coli have evolved a genetic switch (the trp operon) that turns o ® synthesis in this case and turns on synthesis when tryptophan is no longer present in the environment. The following model is based loosely on the control of tryptophan production by the trp operon. Although the trp gene codes for 5 enzymes that act on ¯ve substrates, or precursors, we simplify it a bit by considering only one of each. Our treatment follows Banks and Maha®y [2], who considered a general negative feedback genetic control model. Their model, hence ours too, does not include transcriptional attenuation of the trp operon. See Santillan and Mackey [7] for a more realistic model of the trp operon.

40|$|Abstract — The sun {{tracking}} {{is aimed}} {{to optimize the}} energy production efficiency by following the sun trajectory, and, therefore, the panels must remain always normal to the sun direction. The sun tracking constitute a promising alternative and they {{are more and more}} used in industry in order to improve the quantity of the produced power by the photovoltaic systems Tracker performance is impacted from effects such as wind and gravity, and understanding the impact of these loads on the optical performance can yield tracker designs that are potentially cheaper, while maintaining required structural stability. In this paper, A dual axis sun tracking system of 12. 8 kWp connected to the grid (the active surface being of 88. 5 m) is modeled geometrically (three dimensional solid model) by using SolidWorks CAD Software and simulated statically by FEA (Finite Element Analysis) using SolidWorks Simulation to determine the equivalent stress, displacement, deformation and safety factor. This approach of design and optimization of the tracking subjected to its free weight and critical wind load, namely wind speed of 130 km/h. Puts forward the interest of this design is to get gain of time, money and the quality of rigidity and resistance of the finished product. Thus, the reliability of the tracking is shown because the critical stresses of Von Mises of the most fragile <b>material</b> <b>check</b> the criteria of resistance with a safety factor higher than six (06) with strains are much lower than the unit.

These sessions were quite unforgettable, although I must admit that the first few years were pretty rough.
