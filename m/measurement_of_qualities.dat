40|$|The present paper {{proposes a}} new method for {{analyzing}} oral discussion processes. This method is called Inter-utterance Quotation Network Analysis (IQNA) {{that was developed}} {{with the concept of}} inter-textuality and the methods of network analysis. Using IQNA, researchers can obtain visualized representations of the dynamics of discussion and general indices for <b>measurement</b> <b>of</b> <b>qualities</b> of discussion. As an introduction to IQNA, the author shows two applications of the method to classroom discourse. The first one offers an index measuring to what extent students have the initiative in a classroom discussion. The second one demonstrates how IQNA explicates developmental process of a discussion topic. In {{the last part of the}} paper, merits and limitations of IQNA are discussed...|$|E

In recent years, commercial “intelligent route control ” devices are used by multihomed stub {{networks to}} optimize the routing of their Internet traffic. In this work, we first conduct <b>measurement</b> <b>of</b> <b>qualities</b> of alternate paths through multihoming. In the remaining part, we study the route control of traffic {{among a group of}} multihomed stub networks which may belong to an organization and exchange data regularly. This type of route control is special because the access links of such networks may not be over-provisioned and are shared by traffic controlled by multiple route control devices. Such shared bottlenecks may affect the effectiveness of uncoordinated “intelligent route control”. We propose a global optimization based approach to coordinate the route control among such a group of networks. Our approach can avoid oscillations which may be caused by uncoordinated route control. Simulation results show that our approach has advantages over equal-splitting based static load-balancing...|$|E

The <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> love (QOL) in twenty first century Indian youth has been continuously degraded now a days because of the structure of true love in lover’s relationship is not defined clearly. In this paper, authors perform a theoretical analysis on four different types of relationships viz. one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-one, many-to-many exists in 21 st century youth correspondingly proposes two methodologies that are termed as break-up for love making and break_up after time pass. The significance to develop new methodologies is to measure the <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> true love in twenty first century youth.
