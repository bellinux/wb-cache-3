5|$|The {{two stars}} in Serpens Caput that {{form part of}} the Snake's body below the heart are Epsilon and Mu Serpentis, both third-magnitude A-type main-sequence stars. Both have a peculiarity: Epsilon is an Am star, while Mu is a binary. Located {{slightly}} northwest of Mu is 36 Serpentis, another A-type <b>main-sequence</b> <b>star.</b> This star also has a peculiarity; it is a binary with the primary component being a Lambda Boötis star, meaning that it has solar-like amounts of carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen, while containing very low amounts of iron peak elements. 25 Serpentis, positioned a few degrees northeast of Mu Serpentis, is a spectroscopic binary consisting of a hot B-type giant and an A-type <b>main-sequence</b> <b>star.</b> The primary is a slowly pulsating B star, which causes the system to vary by 0.03 magnitudes.|$|E
5|$|Exocomets {{beyond the}} Solar System {{have also been}} {{detected}} and may be common in the Milky Way. The first exocomet system detected was around Beta Pictoris, a very young A-type <b>main-sequence</b> <b>star,</b> in 1987. A total of 10 such exocomet systems have been identified , using the absorption spectrum caused by the large clouds of gas emitted by comets when passing close to their star.|$|E
5|$|In 1992, astronomers Aleksander Wolszczan and Dale Frail {{announced}} {{the discovery of}} planets around a pulsar, PSR B1257+12.

5|$|Marking the raven's {{right wing}} is Eta Corvi, a yellow-white <b>main-sequence</b> <b>star</b> of type F2V that is 1.52 times as massive and 4.87 times as {{luminous}} as the Sun. It is 59 light-years distant from our Solar System. Two debris disks {{have been detected}} orbiting this star, one warm within 3.5 astronomical units and another out at ~150 astronomical units distant. Zeta Corvi marks the raven's neck. It is of apparent magnitude 5.21, separated by 7 arcseconds from the star HR 4691. Located 420 ± 10 light-years distant, it is a blue-white Be star of spectral type B8V, the presence of hydrogen emission lines in its spectrum indicating it has a circumstellar disc. These stars may be an optical double or a true multiple star system, with a separation of at least 50,000 astronomical units and the stars taking 3.5 million years to orbit each other. HR 4691 is itself double, composed of an ageing yellow-orange giant whose spectral type has been calculated at K0 or G3, and an F-type <b>main-sequence</b> <b>star.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Sun is a G2-type <b>main-sequence</b> <b>star.</b> Hotter main-sequence {{stars are}} more luminous.

5|$|The Sun is the Solar System's {{star and}} by far its most massive component. Its large mass (332,900 Earth masses) {{produces}} temperatures and densities in its core {{high enough to}} sustain nuclear fusion of hydrogen into helium, making it a <b>main-sequence</b> <b>star.</b> This releases {{an enormous amount of}} energy, mostly radiated into space as electromagnetic radiation peaking in visible light.|$|E
5|$|The {{smallest}} known {{planet is}} PSR B1257+12A, {{one of the}} first extrasolar planets discovered, which was found in 1992 in orbit around a pulsar.

From then until the Kepler mission most known extrasolar planets were gas giants comparable in mass to Jupiter or larger as they were more easily detected. The catalog of Kepler candidate planets consists mostly of planets the size of Neptune and smaller, down to smaller than Mercury.|$|E
25|$|O-type {{stars are}} very hot and {{extremely}} luminous, {{with most of}} their radiated output in the ultraviolet range.

5|$|The {{principal}} {{component of the}} Solar System is the Sun, a G2 <b>main-sequence</b> <b>star</b> that contains 99.86% of the system's known mass and dominates it gravitationally. The Sun's four largest orbiting bodies, the giant planets, account for 99% of the remaining mass, with Jupiter and Saturn together comprising more than 90%. The remaining objects of the Solar System (including the four terrestrial planets, the dwarf planets, moons, asteroids, and comets) together comprise less than 0.002% of the Solar System's total mass.|$|E
5|$|The {{study of}} stars and stellar {{evolution}} is fundamental {{to our understanding of}} the Universe. The astrophysics of stars has been determined through observation and theoretical understanding; and from computer simulations of the interior. Star formation occurs in dense regions of dust and gas, known as giant molecular clouds. When destabilized, cloud fragments can collapse under the influence of gravity, to form a protostar. A sufficiently dense, and hot, core region will trigger nuclear fusion, thus creating a <b>main-sequence</b> <b>star.</b>|$|E
5|$|Vega {{became the}} first solitary <b>main-sequence</b> <b>star</b> beyond the Sun known to be an X-ray emitter when in 1979 it was {{observed}} from an imaging X-ray telescope launched on an Aerobee 350 from the White Sands Missile Range. In 1983, Vega {{became the first}} star {{found to have a}} disk of dust. The Infrared Astronomical Satellite (IRAS) discovered an excess of infrared radiation coming from the star, and this was attributed to energy emitted by the orbiting dust as it was heated by the star.|$|E

5|$|Altair {{is one of}} the few {{stars for}} which a direct image has been obtained. In 2006 and 2007, J. D.

The false-color image was published in 2007. The equatorial radius of the star was estimated to be 2.03 solar radii, and the polar radius 1.63 solar radii—a 25% increase of the stellar radius from pole to equator. The polar axis is inclined by about 60° to the line of sight from the Earth.|$|E
5|$|If {{the mass}} of a <b>main-sequence</b> <b>star</b> is lower than {{approximately}} half a solar mass, it will never become hot enough to fuse helium in its core. It is thought that, over a lifespan that considerably exceeds {{the age of the}} Universe (c. 13.8 billion years), such a star will eventually burn all its hydrogen and end its evolution as a helium white dwarf composed chiefly of helium-4 nuclei. Due to the very long time this process takes, it is not thought to be the origin of the observed helium white dwarfs. Rather, they are thought to be the product of mass loss in binary systems or mass loss due to a large planetary companion.|$|E
5|$|Marking the Little Bear's tail, Polaris, or Alpha Ursae Minoris, is the {{brightest}} star in the constellation, varying between apparent magnitude 1.97 and 2.00 over a period of 3.97days.

Polaris is {{the brightest}} Cepheid variable star visible from Earth. It is a triple star system, the supergiant primary star having two yellow-white <b>main-sequence</b> <b>star</b> companions that are 17 and 2,400astronomical units (AU) distant and take 29.6 and 42,000years respectively to complete one orbit.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. We {{discuss the}} {{apparent}} widespread presence of Weak-Line T-Tauri stars (WTTS) among stellar coronal sources {{detected in the}} ROSAT All-Sky Survey (RASS), and their relative number with respect to young <b>main-sequence</b> <b>stars</b> in the same samples. The approach taken {{in most of the}} current literature for identifying and classifying WTT stars among RASS X-ray sources is based on the usage of low-resolution optical spectra only and on simple, mass-independent thresholds on the equivalent width of the Li i 6707. 8 ˚A doublet. We show that this approach is likely to lead to putative WTTS samples which contain a large number of normal, young <b>main-sequence</b> <b>stars</b> masquerading as WTTS sources. Young <b>main-sequence</b> <b>stars</b> are known to be the dominant contributor in stellar X-ray selected samples at the limiting flux levels of the RASS, yet they appear to be very rare in the RASS samples discussed here. We argue that many of the putative WTTS sources are actually mis-classified young <b>main-sequence</b> <b>stars,</b> and that thus there is likely not a true “WTTS question ” in the RASS samples...|$|R
50|$|In <b>main-sequence</b> <b>stars</b> major eruptive {{variability}} is exceptional. It {{is common}} only among the flare stars, {{also known as}} the UV Ceti variables, very faint <b>main-sequence</b> <b>stars</b> which undergo regular flares. They increase in brightness by up to two magnitudes (six times brighter) in just a few seconds, and then fade back to normal brightness in half an hour or less. Several nearby red dwarfs are flare stars, including Proxima Centauri and Wolf 359.|$|R
