25|$|After {{the end of}} the Mexican War of Independence in 1821, {{the markets}} {{initially}} had momentum as restrictions against imports were lifted and other measures to free the market had a positive effect. However, for much of the 19th century, the country's political instability would hamper <b>market</b> <b>development</b> and food distribution, with most remaining sold in small tianguis with large, formal markets only in the largest cities. The economic situation began to stabilize in the latter 19th century, especially the last decades under the Porfirio Díaz regime. This government took steps to begin to regulate and modernize the food distribution system by establishing official monopolies called tendajones or estanquillos.|$|E
25|$|The Roadmap for the Integration of ASEAN in Finance is {{the latest}} {{regional}} initiative, which aims to strengthen regional self-help and support mechanisms. The implementation of the roadmap {{will contribute to the}} realisation of the ASEAN Economic Community that was launched by the ASEAN leaders in October 2003 in Bali. The AEC is the end-goal of economic integration as outlined in the ASEAN Vision 2020 and the Bali Concord II to establish a single market and production base, characterised by the free movement of goods, services, investment, and a freer flow of capital. The AEC will also facilitate the movement of business professionals, skilled labour, and talent within the region. As in the EU, adoption of an ASEAN common currency, when conditions are ripe, could be the final stage of the ASEAN Economic Community. Under the roadmap, approaches and milestones have been identified in areas deemed crucial to financial and monetary integration, namely: (a) capital <b>market</b> <b>development,</b> (b) capital account liberalisation, (c) financial services liberalisation, and (d) ASEAN currency co-operation. Capital <b>market</b> <b>development</b> entails promoting institutional capacity, including the legal and regulatory framework, as well as the facilitation of greater cross-border collaboration, linkages, and harmonisation between capital markets in the region. Orderly capital account liberalisation will be promoted with adequate safeguards against volatility and systemic risks. To expedite the process of financial services liberalisation, ASEAN has agreed on a positive list modality and adopted milestones to facilitate negotiations. Currency co-operation would involve exploration of possible currency arrangements, including an ASEAN currency payment system for trade in local goods to reduce the demand for US dollars and to help promote stability of regional currencies, such as by settling intra-ASEAN trade using regional currencies.|$|E

25|$|One of the town's most {{well-known}} shops, the shoe store Tommy Ball's, closed in May 2008 after going into administration. The town's oldest store, Mercer & Sons, also closed after {{a decline in}} sales blamed on the credit crunch. It opened in 1840 and was originally an ironmonger but the public store converted to selling toys, household goods and hardware. However, in January 2009 {{the directors of the}} company announced that the shop would close following a 30-day statutory consultation, unless they change their mind or a buyer is found. The markets continue to offer a wide range of local produce—Lancashire cheeses, tripe, Bowland beef and lamb can all be found.

The war {{disrupted}} food production and distribution with the abandonment of haciendas, lack of manpower in the agricultural sector and the disruption of transportation systems. With {{the exception of the}} Abelardo L. Rodríguez market in 1934, there were no new markets constructed in Mexico City, other than small ones for newly established neighborhoods in the growing city. Outside of Mexico City, formal markets were still be introduced to replace older tianguis. The installation of fixed structures to replace tianguis did not always go well. In Xalapa, Veracruz a new, modern and at the time, spacious market was built and promoted in the 1940s to replace the weekly market at the Plazuela del Carbón. However, at first no one would go and shop there, making it a distinct failure. It took fifteen years of efforts to make the market accepted and profitable.|$|E

Bank and stock <b>market</b> <b>developments</b> indices are used to measure developments in the banking sector and the stock market. The results indicate {{the existence of a}} steady long run relationship between growth, bank and stock <b>market</b> <b>developments.</b> Banks are found to have a greater impact on economic growth than stock markets. Evidence of supply-leading hypothesis is found. The results suggest that economic growth is better promoted through a financially-based economic system than a stock market based one...|$|R
500|$|The U.S. {{frequently}} {{uses its}} economic power {{in order to}} punish other countries. [...] One of the ways the U.S. does this is by holding back on exporting food. [...] Reasons for the punishment of another country vary; however, they {{can be broken down}} into two main groups: Foreign containment objective and market development/humanitarian objectives. [...] The foreign containment objective tends to punish those countries who are threatening to the U.S. [...] An example of such a threat would be countries under other forms of government. [...] More examples related to the containment objective would be no aid to communist countries, socialist governments, countries who support radical regimes, regimes with an inadequate democracy who are too weak to be anti-communist (effectively), and countries who will not accept U.S. agreements. [...] An example of <b>market</b> <b>development</b> and humanitarian objectives would fall under a category of countries that are trying to compete with the U.S. economically. [...] The U.S. will execute foreign aid punishments to countries trying to nationalize property of U.S. companies, countries who want to take over functions by U.S. companies, and countries trying to initiate nationalistic economic policies.|$|E
