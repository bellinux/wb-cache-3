Afterward, mining incidents were on the increase, and efforts {{to deal with them}} were unsuccessful. The government then {{came up with the idea}} of giving the violence an outlet instead.

The New Poor Law is considered {{to be one of the}} most [...] "far-reaching pieces of legislation of the entire Nineteenth Century" [...] and [...] "classic example of the fundamental Whig-Benthamite reforming legislation of the period". The Act aimed to reduce the burden on rate payers and can be seen as an attempt by the Whig government to win the votes of the classes enfranchised by the Great Reform Act. Despite being labelled an [...] "amendment act" [...] it completely overhauled the existing system and established a Poor Law Commission to oversee the national operation of the system. [...] This included the forming together of small parishes into Poor Law Unions and the building of workhouses in each union for the giving of poor relief. Although the aim of the legislation was to reduce costs to rate payers, one area not reformed was the <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>financing</b> of the Poor Law system which continued to be paid for by levying a [...] "poor rate" [...] on the property owning middle classes.|$|E

40|$|Purpose – This paper aims {{to analyse}} {{the attitudes of}} Libyan retail {{customers}} to Islamic <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> <b>finance.</b> Design/methodology/approach – The study conducted a survey of 385 Libyan retail consumers. Descriptive, factor and discriminant analyses of responses were performed to identify principal factors affecting attitudes towards and the potential use of Islamic financial products and services. Findings – The results indicate that while most respondents have at least some knowledge about some Islamic products, especially Musharakah (full-equity business partnerships) and Quard Hassan (interest-free benevolent loans), they are generally unaware of many other products. Nonetheless, most respondents (85. 9 per cent) are potential users <b>of</b> Islamic <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> <b>finance</b> at the retail level, though potential use varying markedly according to age, level of education, employment, income and nationality. Factor analysis reduces {{the large number of}} variables that determine retail consumers’ attitudes towards Islamic <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> <b>finance</b> to just community service, profitability, religion and unique services. Discriminant analysis shows that religion and community service are the most important positive attitudes determining the potential use <b>of</b> Islamic <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> <b>finance</b> by retail consumers in Libya. Research limitations/implications – The study is undertaken in a single national context, so there is no possibility of comparing the results with alternative financial systems in different stages of the adoption <b>of</b> Islamic <b>finance.</b> Research was completed in 2010, with the ongoing unrest in Libya precluding publication until recently. Practical implications – Religious motivations rank highest in determining positive attitudes to Islamic <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> <b>finance,</b> and marketers should ensure that Islamic financial products and services strictly comply with Sharia. However, {{it may be possible to}} strengthen these positive attitudes by promoting that the community service role <b>of</b> Islamic <b>finance</b> is also important. Consumers also react favourably to marketing that either admits something negative about the product (e. g. Islamic finance is Sharia-compliant, but less profitable for depositors) or something positive about a competing product (e. g. conventional finance is more profitable, but cares less about the community). Marketers should emphasise the strengths <b>of</b> Islamic <b>finance</b> across the several sources of positive attitudes the authors have identified. Originality/value – There is no published work on Libyan retail consumers and limited study of attitudes towards Islamic <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> <b>finance</b> more generally.
