One of economically important tuna species is bigeye tuna (Thunnus obesus) which has a proportion of 21 % of the total production of large tuna group. The objective {{of this study was to}} investigate the effects of different <b>moon</b> <b>phase</b> on the catch of bigeye tuna (T. obesus) in Eastern Indian Ocean. Data collection was conducted by the scientific observers from August 2005 to June 2014 in the tuna longline vessels were based in the port of Benoa, Bali. <b>Moon</b> <b>phase</b> data were collected from August 2005 to June 2014 from National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). Catch data were calculated using the catch rate formula which defined as the number of catches per 100 hooks. The number of catch rate then was sorted into each <b>moon</b> <b>phases</b> and were analyzed using one-way Anova. This study covered 62 trips and 1, 480 numbers of operations or sets was conducted from sampled vessels.

40|$|A single multiple-choice {{question}} {{was used to}} pre and post-assess a brief lesson on <b>moon</b> <b>phases</b> immediately {{before and after the}} lesson in a class for pre-service teachers. The lesson included a lecture on why we see <b>moon</b> <b>phases</b> which involved a classroom demonstration and a diagram showing the relative positions of the sun, the moon, and the earth at the various phases, followed by an explanation of solar and lunar eclipses. The results of the pre/post assessment were very encouraging: 43 % answered correctly on the pre-test and 88 % on the post-test (a normalized gain of 79 %!). The most common distracter chosen on the pre-test was that <b>moon</b> <b>phases</b> were caused by Earth’s shadow (35 %). However, students struggled to answer moon-phase questions on the final exam two weeks later. Two sections had an essay question: “Explain why the moon sometimes appears as a crescent, sometimes as a circle (full moon), and sometimes not at all (new moon). ” Only 25 % answered correctly (in prose or with a well-labeled diagram). 40 % had incomplete explanations or diagrams, several simply stating: “Because the <b>moon</b> has <b>phases.</b> ” The remaining 35 % were incorrect explanations. However, only 7 % of the answers (20 % of the incorrect explanations) described <b>moon</b> <b>phases</b> as the result of Earth’s shadow. Other answers included references to Earth’s rotation and a diagram of the solar system with the sun between the Earth and the moon. Another section was given a {{multiple-choice question}} with a diagram of the sun, the Earth, and the moon in a line in that order and a list of <b>moon</b> <b>phases</b> from which to choose.

30|$|For {{studies of}} auroral records from {{historical}} articles, concerns on <b>moon</b> <b>phase</b> might {{be important in}} estimating the actual events indicated by the records. One reason for our interest in <b>moon</b> <b>phase</b> {{is that there are}} some natural optical events possibly expressed as vapor, such as “moon halo” and paraselene (or “moon dog”), which occur rarely with a nearly full moon and ice crystals in cold air. This kind of atmospheric optics would occur more frequently in a polar region, but may possibly occur at lower latitudes given appropriate weather conditions. If the frequency of the “potentially aurora” records depends on the <b>moon</b> <b>phase,</b> it indicates that there may be significant number of events that are actually atmospheric optics. In order to examine this, we calculate the <b>moon</b> <b>phase</b> (0 for the previous new moon and 1 for the next new moon) and make a histogram of historical records of vapors from Sòngshǐ.|$|R
40|$|In Amphibians, both {{positive}} and negative correlations between activity and full <b>moon</b> <b>phase</b> have been observed. In this study, we present data for two anuran species (Hyla intermedia and Rana dalmatina) studied in a hilly Mediterranean area of central Italy. We analysed, in a two-year survey, the relationships between the number of egg clutches laid each night and the <b>moon</b> <b>phases</b> by means of circular statistics. Moreover, the studied species exhibited clear oviposition site selection behaviour influenced, at least in H. intermedia, by <b>moon</b> <b>phases.</b> We observed the occurrence of an avoidance effect by amphibians for oviposition and specific egg-laying behaviour during <b>moon</b> <b>phases</b> around the full moon. This apparent lunar phobia was evident in both species when yearly data were pooled. On the other hand, while this pattern continued to be also evident in H. intermedia when single years were considered, in R. dalmatina it stood just in one year of study. Nonetheless, during cloudy nights, when moonlight arriving on the ground was low, the frogs' behaviour was similar to that observed in new <b>moon</b> <b>phases.</b> We interpreted the observed pattern as an anti-predatory strategy. Overall, comparisons between our own study and previous research suggest that there was insufficient evidence to establish any unequivocal patterns and that further research in this regard is needed...|$|R

40|$|Foraging {{animals have}} several tools for {{managing}} the risk of predation, and the foraging games between them and their predators. Among these, time allocation is foremost, followed by vigilance and apprehension. Together, their use influences a forager's time allocation and giving-up density (GUD) in depletable resource patches. We examined Allenby's gerbils (Gerbilus andersoni allenbyi) exploiting seed resource patches in a large vivarium under varying <b>moon</b> <b>phases</b> {{in the presence of}} a red fox (Vulpes vulpes). We measured time allocated to foraging patches electronically and GUDs from seeds left behind in resource patches. From these, we estimated handling times, attack rates and quitting harvest rates (QHRs). Gerbils displayed greater vigilance (lower attack rates) at brighter <b>moon</b> <b>phases</b> (full full > new > wane). Finally, gerbils displayed higher QHRs at new and waxing <b>moon</b> <b>phases.</b> Differences across <b>moon</b> <b>phases</b> not only reflect changing time allocation and vigilance, but changes in the state of the foragers and their marginal value of energy. Early in the lunar cycle, gerbils rely on vigilance and sacrifice state to avoid risk; later they defend state at the cost of increased time allocation; finally their state can recover as safe opportunities expand. In the predator–prey foraging game, foxes may contribute to these patterns of behaviours by modulating their own activity in response to the opportunities presented in each <b>moon</b> <b>phase...</b>|$|R
