5|$|Masked shrikes {{are most}} similar in {{appearance}} to woodchat shrikes, but are smaller, more slender and longer-tailed. Adults {{of the two}} species are easily distinguished, since the <b>masked</b> <b>shrike</b> has white on its head and a dark rump, whereas the woodchat shrike has a black crown, rusty nape and white rump. Juveniles are more similar, but the <b>masked</b> <b>shrike</b> has a longer tail, paler face, and grey back and rump, whereas the woodchat shrike has a sandy back and pale grey rump.|$|E
5|$|The <b>masked</b> <b>shrike</b> feeds {{mainly on}} large insects, {{although}} other arthropods and small vertebrates are also caught. Shrikes fatten up before migration, {{but to a}} lesser extent than other passerines because they can feed on the way, sometimes taking other tired migrants. Despite its relatively small size, the <b>masked</b> <b>shrike</b> has been recorded as killing species such as lesser whitethroat and little swift. Vertebrates are killed by bill blows {{to the back of the}} head, and the tomial teeth are then used to separate the neck bones.|$|E
5|$|The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) {{estimates}} the European {{population of the}} <b>masked</b> <b>shrike</b> to be between 105,000–300,000 individuals, suggesting a global total of 142,000–600,000 birds. Although the population appears to be declining, the decrease is not rapid enough to trigger the IUCN vulnerability criteria. The large numbers and extensive breeding range of about , mean that this shrike is classified by the IUCN as being of least concern.|$|E
500|$|The <b>masked</b> <b>shrike's</b> {{preferred}} {{habitat is}} open woodland with bushes and some large trees. Unlike its relatives, it avoids very open, lightly vegetated country.

It occurs in lowlands and in hills up to [...] In some areas breeding occurs at greater altitudes, up to [...] It may occur in gardens and resorts on migration, and in winter again prefers open country with thorny bushes and large trees like acacia or introduced eucalyptus.|$|R
5|$|Male <b>masked</b> <b>shrikes</b> sing from perches {{in their}} territories from early April, {{sometimes}} chasing or competing vocally with neighbouring males. The male's courtship display, usually accompanied by singing, {{starts with the}} bird perching erect and shivering its wings on an exposed perch, and {{is followed by the}} shrike stepping down its branch and bowing, either on the move or while temporarily halted. The male may also give a fluttering, zigzagging flight display. The female is sometimes fed by her mate while she crouches with spread wings and gives begging calls. Elements of the display are shared with other shrikes, but stepping-down and bowing on the move appear to be confined to this species.|$|R
50|$|Kleptoparasitism is {{relatively}} uncommon in birds. However, some non-passerine groups, such as skuas, jaegers and frigatebirds, rely extensively on such behavior to obtain food, and others—including raptors, gulls, terns, coots, and some ducks and shorebirds—will do so opportunistically. Among opportunistic {{species such as}} the roseate tern, {{research has found that}} parent birds involved in kleptoparasitism are more successful in raising broods than non-kleptoparasitic individuals. Bald eagles have also been seen attacking smaller raptors, such as ospreys, to steal fish away from them. Among passerine birds, there are fewer known examples of kleptoparasitism, though <b>masked</b> <b>shrikes</b> have been recorded stealing food from wheatears, and Eurasian blackbirds have been seen stealing smashed snails from other thrushes.|$|R
5|$|The <b>masked</b> <b>shrike</b> {{gives the}} harsh calls typical of this family, with {{repeated}} tsr, tzr or shek notes and some whistles, and when alarmed produces a rattling krrrr. The bill may be snapped when {{the bird is}} agitated. The song, up to a minute long, is soft for a shrike, with chattering sounds interspersed with rich warbles. It resembles the songs of Hippolais species, particularly the olive-tree warbler. On rare occasions, males may sing in flight.|$|E
5|$|The <b>masked</b> <b>shrike</b> breeds in the Balkans, {{northeast}} Greece {{and some}} of the Greek islands, Turkey, Cyprus and from Syria south to Israel. It also nests in eastern Iraq and western Iran. The range in the east is uncertain, and may include Afghanistan and northern Saudi Arabia. It is migratory, wintering south of the Sahara, mainly in Chad, Sudan and Ethiopia. Smaller numbers are found west to eastern Mali and Nigeria, and in northern Kenya and southern Saudi Arabia. Most birds leave the breeding areas in late August and September, and return north in February and March.|$|E
5|$|The masked shrike's {{preferred}} {{habitat is}} open woodland with bushes and some large trees. It is less conspicuous than its relatives, avoiding very open country and often perching in less exposed locations.

The chicks are fed by both parents until they fledge 18–20days later, and remain dependent on the adults for about 3–4 weeks after leaving the nest. The <b>masked</b> <b>shrike</b> eats mainly large insects, occasionally small vertebrates; it sometimes impales its prey on thorns or barbed wire. Populations are decreasing {{in parts of the}} European range, but not rapidly enough to raise serious conservation concerns, and the species is therefore classified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as being of least concern.|$|E

500|$|The <b>masked</b> <b>shrike</b> was {{described}} by German explorer and naturalist Martin Lichtenstein in 1823 under its current scientific name. Lanius is the Latin for a butcher, and comes from the shrikes' habit of impaling prey, reminiscent of a butcher hanging carcasses, and nubicus means [...] "Nubian" [...] (from northeast Africa). The bird was independently described by Dutch zoologist Coenraad Temminck in 1824 as Lanius personatus, from the Latin personatus [...] "masked", referring, as does the English name, to the bird's appearance, but the older name takes precedence. A later synonym from 1844 was L. leucometopon from the Greek leukos, [...] "white", and metopon, [...] "forehead", describing {{a feature of the}} distinctive head pattern.

500|$|The [...] <b>masked</b> <b>shrike</b> (Lanius nubicus) is {{a bird in}} the shrike family, Laniidae. It breeds {{in southeastern}} Europe and at {{the eastern end of}} the Mediterranean, with a {{separate}} population in eastern Iraq and western Iran. It is migratory, wintering mainly in northeast Africa. Although it is a short-range migrant, vagrants have occurred widely elsewhere, including northern and western Europe. It is the smallest member of its genus, long-tailed and with a hooked bill. The male has mainly black upperparts, with white on its crown, forehead and supercilium and large white patches on the shoulders and wings. The throat, neck sides and underparts are white, with orange flanks and breast. The female is a duller version of the male, with brownish black upperparts and a grey or buff tone to the shoulders and underparts. The juvenile has grey-brown upperparts with a paler forehead and barring from the head to rump, barred off-white underparts and brown wings аpart from the white primary patches. The species' calls are short and grating, but the song has melodic warbler-like components.|$|E
500|$|The nest, {{built by}} both sexes, is a small, neat cup of rootlets, stems and twigs, lined with wool or hair, and adorned with lichen externally.
