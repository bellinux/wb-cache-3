40|$|Abstract. The aim of {{the study}} was to {{investigate}} the resistance to rolling contact fatigue of a-C:H:W and MoS 2 /Ti coated gears. The investigation of rolling contact fatigue was realised by means of a gear test rig using FZG PT C/ 10 / 90 pitting test. Four material combinations of gears were tested: <b>wheel</b> and <b>pinion</b> uncoated, <b>wheel</b> and <b>pinion</b> coated, <b>wheel</b> coated and <b>pinion</b> uncoated as well as <b>wheel</b> uncoated and <b>pinion</b> coated. The tests were performed using for lubrication mineral gear oil of API GL- 5 performance level and 80 W/ 90 viscosity grade. The results indicate that for the coated/coated pair (<b>wheel</b> and <b>pinion</b> coated) and uncoated/coated pair (uncoated <b>wheel</b> and coated <b>pinion)</b> a significant decrease in the fatigue life compared to the uncoated gears was obtained. The best results were obtained in the case of the coated/uncoated pair (a-C:H:W coated <b>wheel</b> and uncoated <b>pinion)</b> â€“ even fourfold increase in the fatigue life was observed. This shows a very high potential of application of PVD coatings for gears...|$|R

50|$|A safety pinion was an {{alternate}} means of protection, {{used with the}} going barrel. In this, the centre <b>wheel</b> <b>pinion,</b> which the barrel gear engages, was attached to its shaft with a reverse screw thread. If the spring broke, the reverse recoil of the barrel, instead of being {{passed on to the}} gear train, would simply unscrew the pinion.|$|R

50|$|Fourth wheel - In clocks {{and watches}} {{with the second}} hand in a subdial on the face, this turns once per minute, and the shaft {{projects}} through the face and holds the second hand. The fourth wheel also turns the escape <b>wheel</b> <b>pinion.</b> Many clocks don't need this wheel, because of their slower moving escapements, and in these the third wheel drives the escape wheel directly.|$|R
50|$|There is no {{pattern that}} is {{repeated}} every 60 minutes, but this {{might well have}} to do with the fact that the gear ratio of the going train is 95:8, meaning that it takes a full 8 hours until the same teeth on the escapement <b>wheel</b> <b>pinion</b> and the great wheel engage again. A longer measuring interval (24 hours) might be necessary to observe repeat patterns.|$|R

The degradation of the cogwheel arose during the warranty period, after seven months of using of the construction machine. The experimental analysis revealed that the cause of the degradation of the cogwheel was due to high mechanical stress in the operating conditions of construction machine. </div...|$|R

50|$|Initial {{servicing}} of the Queerbox {{was undertaken}} by Graham Hill, then a mechanic at Lotus. It was {{soon discovered that}} the final drive was reliably unreliable, with all examples having the hypoid crown <b>wheel</b> <b>pinion</b> of their final drives fail at around fifty miles, much less than a single race. When improved oils meant that they lasted barely long enough to compete, it was then found that the gearbox section was also unreliable, with a worn box becoming unable to select a gear and leaving drivers with 'a box full of neutrals'.|$|R

50|$|The <b>pinion</b> <b>wheels</b> can {{be mounted}} on the same axle as the rail wheels (as in the picture at left), or driven separately. The steam {{locomotives}} on the Mount Lyell Mining and Railway Company had separate cylinders driving the <b>pinion</b> <b>wheel,</b> as do the 'X' Class locomotives on the Nilgiri Mountain Railway.|$|R
50|$|In 1948 Zenith {{introduced}} a watch with a redesigned gear train where the fourth wheel {{was at the}} center of the movement, and so could drive a center seconds hand directly. The <b>minute</b> <b>wheel,</b> which had previously been at the center of the movement, was moved off center and drove the <b>minute</b> <b>wheel</b> indirectly. Any fluttering due the indirect gearing is concealed by the relatively slow movement of the minute hand. This redesign brought all the train gearing between the plates and allowed a thinner movement.|$|R
5000|$|John Blenkinsop {{thought that}} the {{friction}} would be too low of metal wheels on metal rails, so he built his locomotives for the Middleton Railway in 1812 with a 20 tooth, 3 ft diameter cog <b>wheel</b> (<b>pinion)</b> {{on the left side}} that engaged in rack teeth (two teeth per foot) on the outer side of the rail, the metal [...] "fishbelly" [...] edge rail with its side rack being cast all in one piece, in three feet (one yard) lengths. Blenkinsop's system remained in use for 25 years on the Middleton Railway, but it became a curiosity because simple friction was found to be sufficient for railroads operating on level ground.|$|R

50|$|Cannon pinion - a pinion with {{a hollow}} shaft that fits {{friction}} tight over the center wheel shaft, projects through the face, {{and holds the}} minute hand. While the timepiece is not being set, this is turned by the center wheel, and drives the <b>minute</b> <b>wheel.</b> While being set it is turned by the setting mechanism, in modern clocks a setting knob {{on the back of}} the clock. In watches during setting this is turned by the <b>minute</b> <b>wheel,</b> which is turned by the keyless work. In older clocks the setting was done by opening the face and manually pushing the minute hand, which rotated the cannon pinion directly.|$|R
50|$|A second free-turning <b>pinion</b> <b>wheel</b> {{which also}} meshed with the rack, was {{mounted on the}} leading driving axle. It had grooved brake drums bolted to each side and acted as a brake only, with the brakes being applied by a hand {{mechanism}} from the footplate. The brakes on the driving and free-turning <b>pinion</b> <b>wheels</b> were separately controlled, while the vacuum brake gear on the engine was only used to control the brakes of the train.|$|R
50|$|The {{mainspring}} {{is wound}} {{by turning the}} arbor, but drives the watch movement by the barrel; this arrangement allows the spring to continue powering the watch while it is being wound. Winding the watch turns the arbor, which tightens the mainspring, wrapping it closer around the arbor. The arbor has a ratchet attached to it, with a click to prevent the spring from turning the arbor backward and unwinding. After winding, the arbor is stationary and {{the pull of the}} mainspring turns the barrel, which has a ring of gear teeth around it. This meshes with one of the clocks gears, usually the center <b>wheel</b> <b>pinion</b> and drives the wheel train. The barrel usually rotates once every 8 hours, so the common 40-hour spring requires 5 turns to unwind completely.|$|R
60|$|Our quarrel was {{now made}} up, {{and we looked}} about the room for an {{aperture}} through which to survey the city of Edina. Windows there were none. The sole light admitted into the gloomy chamber proceeded from a square opening, about a foot in diameter, at a height of about seven feet from the floor. Yet what will the energy of true genius not effect? I resolved to clamber up to this hole. A vast quantity of <b>wheels,</b> <b>pinions,</b> and other cabalistic--looking machinery stood opposite the hole, close to it; and through the hole there passed an iron rod from the machinery. Between the wheels and the wall where the hole lay there was barely room for my body--yet I was desperate, and determined to persevere. I called Pompey to my side.|$|R

40|$|Shortened {{version of}} {{abstract}} in article itself) This article describes an algorithm for producing, for any desired resolution and any desired numbers of <b>wheel</b> and <b>pinion</b> teeth, polygonal approximations to {{the shapes of}} a pair of cycloidal gears that mesh correctly. An Octave implementation of the algorithm, mostly written in 2014, is included. The Octave implementation contains a (crude, but evidently adequate, at least for reasonable numbers of <b>wheel</b> and <b>pinion</b> teeth) solution of the problem of iteratively finding the generating wheel angle corresponding to the tips of the tooth addenda. However, this Octave implementation does not contain a good {{solution to the problem of}} automatically determining the generating wheel angles required to produce a polygon which approximates the curved addenda to a resolution specified by the user. A proposed better solution to this problem, involving a priority queue, is discussed...|$|R

50|$|Although {{a highly}} ingenious {{escapement}} design, the Daniels coaxial nevertheless still needs lubrication to the lever pallet pivots.

50|$|Soon after 1802, Terry's {{production}} of wooden clocks grew considerably. Like other Connecticut clockmakers, Terry knew that apprentices could cheaply rough-cut wooden wheels for more skilled journeymen to shape precisely into clockworks, making clocks slightly more cheaply. And Terry {{was one of}} a number of Connecticut clockmakers who began to substitute water-powered machines for apprentices in the {{production of}} these rough-cut wheels. In 1802 or 03, Terry purchased a mill to produce wooden clock wheels, which still had to be finished by hand by skilled journeymen clockmakers. He purchased a grain mill and used the water wheel and main shaft to run saws and lathes, which helped speed the production of parts. He later created jigs and fixtures to produce a large number of interchangeable clock parts. This allowed for the rapid adjustment and assembly of clocks, freeing Terry from the task of fitting and modifying each individual piece of each clock. Using his own ingenuity and inventiveness, Terry was thus able to speedily cut <b>wheels,</b> <b>pinions,</b> and other important clock parts accurately and repetitively.|$|R
