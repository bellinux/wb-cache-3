5|$|At {{the time}} of their commissioning, all four of the Iowa-class battleships were {{equipped}} with 20 quad 40mm <b>mounts</b> and 49 single 20mm <b>mounts.</b> These guns were respectively augmented with the Mk14 range sight and Mk51 fire control system to improve accuracy.|$|E
5|$|In 1937 eight /75 caliber AA guns in two quadruple <b>mounts</b> {{were added}} to improve the light AA armament. The ships were more {{extensively}} refitted with large amounts of light AA guns {{at the expense of}} the 5-inch/51 caliber guns in 1942, as the attack on Pearl Harbor had shown pre-war light AA armament to be inadequate. The 1.1 inch quad <b>mounts</b> were removed and 24 Bofors 40 mm guns were added in six quadruple <b>mounts</b> (later increased to 40 guns), while 42 Oerlikon 20 mm guns in single <b>mounts</b> were also added. The 3-inch AA gun armament was increased to 10 guns, while the 5-inch gun armament was reduced to 6 guns.|$|E
5|$|Since {{they were}} {{designed}} to escort the US fleet of fast attack aircraft carriers, the Iowa-class battleships were all intended to carry a fearsome array of anti-aircraft guns to protect US aircraft carriers from Japanese fighters and dive bombers. This array included up to 20 quad 40mm <b>mounts</b> and 49 single 20mm <b>mounts.</b> In the 1968 USS New Jersey re-activation for service off Vietnam, the 20mm and 40mm batteries were removed. In the 1980s re-activation, all the ships with 20mm and 40mm batteries had them removed, and four Phalanx CIWS <b>mounts</b> were added to all.|$|E

5|$|The 5-inch/38 gun {{would remain}} on the battleships for the ships' entire service life; however, {{the total number of}} guns and gun <b>mounts</b> was reduced from 20 guns in ten <b>mounts</b> to 12 guns in six <b>mounts</b> during the 1980s' {{modernization}} of the four Iowas. The removal of four of the gun <b>mounts</b> was required for the battleships to be outfitted with the armored box launchers needed to carry and fire Tomahawk missiles. At the time of the 1991 Persian Gulf War, these guns had been largely relegated to littoral defense for the battleships. Since each battleship carried a small detachment of Marines aboard, the Marines would man one of the 5-inch gun <b>mounts.</b>|$|E
5|$|The rear turrets, the barbettes {{and their}} {{supporting}} structures were removed beginning in early 1943 and the {{openings in the}} middle deck were covered by 152mm plates salvaged from the turret armour. All of the 14cm guns were removed and the casemate openings sealed off. Four additional twin 12.7cm <b>mounts</b> were added, one pair abreast the funnel and the other abreast the conning tower. The original ten twin 25mm gun <b>mounts</b> were replaced by triple <b>mounts</b> and nine new triple <b>mounts</b> were added, a total of 57 guns. Two each Type 94 and Type 95 AA directors were added to control the additional guns. The ammunition for these new guns was stored in the magazines originally used for the 14cm guns and for Turret No. 5. During 1944, the ships' AA defences were reinforced with an additional dozen triple and eleven single 25mm gun <b>mounts,</b> {{for a total of}} 104 barrels, and a pair of Type 13 early warning radars were added. In September six 30-round AA rocket launchers were added {{on the sides of the}} flight deck.|$|E
5|$|The ship mounted four 4.7-inch Mk IX guns {{in single}} <b>mounts,</b> {{designated}} 'A', 'B', 'X', and 'Y' {{from front to}} rear. For anti-aircraft (AA) defence, Hero had two quadruple Mark I <b>mounts</b> for the 0.5inch Vickers Mk III machine gun. She was fitted with two above-water quadruple torpedo tube <b>mounts</b> for 21-inch torpedoes. One depth charge rail and two throwers were fitted; 20 depth charges were originally carried, but this increased to 35 shortly after the war began.

5|$|While {{the ship}} was under repair in April 1944, the two 15.5cm wing turrets were removed and {{replaced}} with three triple 25mm gun <b>mounts</b> each. A total of twenty-one triple 25mm <b>mounts</b> and 25 single <b>mounts</b> were added at that time, giving the ship a light AA armament that numbered one hundred and thirty 25mm guns.|$|E
5|$|After 1940 {{the lower}} aft six-inch guns were removed and the casemates plated over. The ship's {{anti-aircraft}} armament was augmented by two quadruple 1.1-inch gun <b>mounts</b> by early 1942, although these {{were replaced by}} twin Bofors 40 mm gun <b>mounts</b> later in the war. At about the same time, Milwaukee received eight Oerlikon 20 mm cannon.|$|E
5|$|As a carrier, {{the ship}} was {{to have had a}} {{complement}} of ten Bf 109 fighters and ten Ju 87 dive-bombers. She would have been armed with an anti-aircraft battery of ten 10.5cm SK C/33 guns in dual <b>mounts,</b> ten 3.7cm SK C/30 guns in dual <b>mounts,</b> and twenty-four 2cm Flak 38 guns in quadruple <b>mounts.</b> Conversion work was halted in June 1943, however, and the incomplete vessel was towed to Königsberg where she was eventually scuttled on 29 January 1945. The ship was seized by the advancing Soviet Army and was briefly considered for cannibalization for spare parts to complete her sister ship Lützow, which had been purchased by the Soviet Navy before the war. This plan was also abandoned, and {{the ship was}} broken up for scrap.|$|E

50|$|There are contradicting {{definitions}} of <b>Mount</b> Seppiko.

5|$|In January 1945, {{removal of}} two quadruple torpedo tubes was {{authorized}} to permit substitution of two 40mm quad <b>mounts.</b> In June, {{removal of the}} third centerline tube was authorized {{to make way for}} two 40mm twin <b>mounts</b> abreast of the aft stack.

By May 1945, Belfast mounted thirty-six 2-pounder guns in two eight-gun <b>mounts,</b> four quadruple <b>mounts,</b> and four single <b>mounts.</b> She also mounted fourteen 20mm Oerlikons. Her two aftmost 4-inch mountings were removed, and the remainder fitted with Remote Power Control. Her empty hangars were converted to crew accommodation, and her aircraft catapult was removed.|$|E
5|$|The {{design of}} the Ibuki class was a minor {{improvement}} over the last pair of the Mogami class after those ships had been upgraded during the late 1930s.
