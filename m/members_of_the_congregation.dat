5|$|Plymouth Colony {{was founded}} {{by a group of}} English Puritans who later {{came to be known as}} the Pilgrims. The core group (roughly 40% of the adults and 56% of the family groupings) were part of a {{congregation}} led by William Bradford. They began to feel the pressures of religious persecution while still in the English village of Scrooby, near East Retford, Nottinghamshire. In 1607, Archbishop Tobias Matthew raided homes and imprisoned several <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>congregation.</b> The congregation left England in 1609 and emigrated to the Netherlands, settling first in Amsterdam and then in Leiden.|$|E
5|$|The {{congregation}} hired Marcus Friedlander of Congregation Baith Israel in Brooklyn, New York in 1893.

Over 500 people, both Jews and non-Jews, were sheltered in the building for days after the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. The synagogue had 95 members by 1907, with annual revenues of $6,000 (today $).|$|E

At the time, the property was valued at $95,000 (today $). The funds for the purchase were raised from the <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>congregation,</b> and to honor those contributing $10 or more, names were engraved on one of four marble slabs in the stairway to the main sanctuary. The most generous gift was $500, at a time when $10 was two weeks' pay.

5|$|The Roman Catholic Church {{first entered}} Semarang, Dutch East Indies, {{in what is}} now Central Java, Indonesia, in the early 19th century. In 1808 Father Lambertus Prinsen (1777â€“1840) was sent from the Netherlands to the Indies as the pastor for Semarang and several {{surrounding}} settlements, including Salatiga and Klaten. He quickly established a council for handling religious duties, and baptisms began the following year; fourteen people, mostly Dutch, were baptised in 1809. However, this congregation did not have a church in which they could pray. Until 1815 the congregation used the nearby Immanuel Church, a building intended for Protestants. Between 1815 and 1822 services were held at the homes of <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>congregation,</b> then from 7 August 1822 Mass was held at Prinsen's new home (near Immanuel).|$|E

5|$|Mount Saint Peter Church was {{magnificent}} {{and rose}} {{up on the}} hill, but to many, {{it seemed as if}} it could not really belong to the congregation. It was much richer than Saint Peter Church and {{if it had not been}} labored upon by so many <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>congregation,</b> none would have felt worthy to call it their parish. But since so much work, love, and faith had been spent on this place of worship, parishioners became proud to have the honor of attending Mass there every Sunday. As a construction site, it had held some dangers. On September 28, 1941, a group of teenage boys, just out of high school, were making concrete flooring for the church at the Burrell Construction Company. A large crane operating above them made an unusual movement, causing its bucket, which weighed several tons, to come down with a huge crash right in their midst. All the working tools were completely destroyed but none of the boys were hurt. The bronze door at the front entrance fell on a worker, and everyone believed he had been crushed to death. When ten men lifted the door, they found the worker unharmed underneath it. In another case, an 18-year-old was assigned a job on the tower of the church before it was roofed. No one realized that he had poor eyesight and he fell from the tower while working. On his way down, he was able to grab onto a pulley that was suspended from the tower.|$|E
