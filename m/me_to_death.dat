500|$|Leicester's forces, {{small and}} seriously underfinanced from the outset, faced the most {{formidable}} army in Europe. Unity among their ranks was at risk by Leicester's and the other officers' quarrels with Sir John Norris, who had commanded previous English contingents in the Netherlands and was now the Earl's deputy. Elizabeth was angry that the war cost more than anticipated and for many months delayed sending money and troops. This not only forced Dudley to raise further funds on his own account, but much aggravated the soldiers' lot. [...] "They cannot get a penny; their credit is spent; they perish for want of victuals and clothing in great numbers ...
