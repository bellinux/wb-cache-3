5000|$|Gopherus is a genus of fossorial {{tortoises}} {{commonly referred}} to as <b>gopher</b> <b>tortoises.</b> The <b>gopher</b> <b>tortoise</b> is grouped with land tortoises that originated 60 million years ago, in North America. A genetic study has shown that their closest relatives are in the Asian genus Manouria. The <b>gopher</b> <b>tortoises</b> live in the southern United States from California's Mojave Desert across to Florida, and in parts of northern Mexico. <b>Gopher</b> <b>tortoises</b> are so named because of their ability to dig large, deep burrows; those of the <b>Gopher</b> <b>tortoise</b> can be up to 40 ft in length and 10 ft in depth. These burrows are used by a variety of other species, including mammals, other reptiles, amphibians, and birds. [...] <b>Gopher</b> <b>tortoises</b> are 20 - 50 cm in length, depending on the species. [...] All five species are found in xeric habitats.|$|R
2500|$|<b>Gopher</b> <b>{{tortoises}},</b> {{like other}} tortoises {{of the genus}} Gopherus, {{are known for their}} digging ability. <b>Gopher</b> <b>tortoises</b> {{spend most of their time}} in long burrows, up to [...] in length and [...] deep. In these burrows, the tortoises are protected from summer heat, winter cold, fire, and predators. The burrows are especially common in longleaf pine savannas, where the tortoises are the primary grazers, playing an essential role in their ecosystem. Except during breeding season, <b>gopher</b> <b>tortoises</b> are solitary animals, inhabiting a small home range. Within their range they dig several burrows. On average, each <b>gopher</b> <b>tortoise</b> needs about [...] to live.|$|R

50|$|<b>Gopher</b> <b>{{tortoises}},</b> {{like other}} tortoises {{of the genus}} Gopherus, {{are known for their}} digging ability. <b>Gopher</b> <b>tortoises</b> {{spend most of their time}} in long burrows, up to 14.5 m in length and 3 m deep. In these burrows, the tortoises are protected from summer heat, winter cold, fire, and predators. The burrows are especially common in longleaf pine savannas, where the tortoises are the primary grazers, playing an essential role in their ecosystem. Except during breeding season, <b>gopher</b> <b>tortoises</b> are solitary animals, inhabiting a small home range. Within their range they dig several burrows.

40|$|Public {{and private}} {{conservation}} areas {{are becoming increasingly}} important to the continued survival of the <b>gopher</b> <b>tortoise,</b> making it imperative that land managers know the specific habitat requirements of juvenile <b>gopher</b> <b>tortoises</b> because recruitment is key to species persistence. Little is currently known about environmental factors that underlie hatchling and juvenile survival and recruitment in <b>gopher</b> <b>tortoise</b> populations. Because of the short duration and distance of juvenile tortoise foraging journeys, food availability, thermoregulatory conditions, and refugia near the burrow may considerably affect juvenile growth and survival. This two-year study of a central Florida sandhill examines the spatial relationship between juvenile <b>gopher</b> <b>tortoise</b> burrows and the surrounding habitat. <b>Gopher</b> <b>tortoise</b> burrow positions, activity, and width were recorded in four complete surveys of the 4 -hectare study area. Coincident with three of the burrow surveys, vegetation and structural habitat characteristics, such as forb and canopy cover, were surveyed in a uniform grid design. Vegetation cover was reclassified using habitat suitability functions (HSFs) derived from qualitative literature values and combined into habitat suitability indices (HSIs) to model the relationships between habitat variables {{and the likelihood of}} juvenile <b>gopher</b> <b>tortoise</b> presence. Chi-squared tests and spatial point pattern analysis were used to validate and identify well-forming models. In general, the best performing HSI models for the juvenile <b>gopher</b> <b>tortoise</b> were those that incorporated all three <b>gopher</b> <b>tortoise</b> life requisites in a compensatory relationship (geometric mean) : thermoregulation (total high canopy, bare ground, or litter), predation (oak mid-canopy), and food (forb or wiregrass). The models could be improved by using the observed relative abundance of juvenile burrows in each vegetation cover class to modify the HSFs. These methods will help identify habitat characteristics associated with active juvenile <b>gopher</b> <b>tortoise</b> burrows that can be used by public and private land managers to improve existing tortoise habitat and to identify high-quality habitat for future preserves...|$|R
50|$|<b>Gopher</b> <b>tortoises</b> {{are known}} as a {{keystone}} species.The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission states the <b>gopher</b> <b>tortoise</b> provides refuge {{for as many as}} 350 to 400 species. The burrows are used for feeding, resting, reproduction, and protection from temperature extremes, moisture loss,and predators. These species include gopher frogs (Rana capito), several species of snake, such as the eastern indigo snake (Drymarchon couperi), small invertebrates, and burrowing owls (Athene cunicularia). Therefore, conservation efforts focused on the <b>gopher</b> <b>tortoise</b> aid these species as well.|$|R
25|$|<b>Gopher</b> <b>tortoises</b> are {{herbivore}} scavengers. Their diets contains over 300 {{species of}} plants. They consume {{a very wide}} range of plants, but mainly eat broad-leaved grass, regular grass, wiregrass, and terrestrial legumes. They also eat mushrooms, and fruits such as gopher apple, pawpaw, blackberries, and saw palmetto berries. In addition, <b>gopher</b> <b>tortoises</b> eat flowers from the genera Cnidoscolus (nettles), Tillandsia (Spanish and ball moss), Richardia, and Dyschoriste. Juvenile tortoises tend to eat more legumes, which are higher in protein, and fewer grasses and tough, fibrous plants than mature <b>tortoises.</b> <b>Gopher</b> <b>tortoises</b> {{have been known to}} scavenge carrion and eat excrement. As <b>gopher</b> <b>tortoises</b> usually get water from the food they eat, they usually only drink standing water in times of extreme drought.|$|R
25|$|In the past, {{approximately}} 83,955 <b>gopher</b> <b>tortoises</b> were incidentally taken (destroyed) and 137,759 {{acres of}} <b>gopher</b> <b>tortoise</b> habitat was permitted for development in Florida as developers could acquire Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission Incidental Take Permits {{to build in}} the gopher tortoises' natural habitat. Additional <b>gopher</b> <b>tortoise</b> habitat was lost due to issuance of Special Tortoise Relocation Permits and Standard Tortoise Relocation Permits, but the total acreage of habitat lost and total number of <b>gopher</b> <b>tortoises</b> relocated cannot be estimated due to issuance of {{these two types of}} permits. On July 31, 2007 the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission implemented new permitting rules requiring developers to relocate tortoises. Starting on April 22, 2009, three types of permits were available in Florida for developers wishing to build on <b>gopher</b> <b>tortoise</b> habitat. Two of these permits allow for the relocation of <b>gopher</b> <b>tortoises,</b> either to some other place on the site being used for construction, or to a recipient site which has been certified by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. The third type of permit allows for temporary relocation of tortoises while major utility lines are installed. In the third case, the tortoises are returned to their habitat after construction is complete.|$|R

40|$|The <b>gopher</b> <b>tortoise</b> (Gopherus polyphemus) is {{critical}} to upland communities and considered a keystone species. A recent threat to <b>gopher</b> <b>tortoise</b> habitat is the invasive cogongrass (Imperata cylindrica), which spreads rapidly, eliminating native vegetation.

Edaphic and vegetative conditions, such as sandy soils and total and mid-story canopy coverage, influenced <b>gopher</b> <b>tortoise</b> occurrence. Logistic regression analyses revealed that active burrow occurrence was related positively to deep, sandy soils and related negatively to total canopy closure and fine loam soils with limited sand content. Abandoned burrow occurrence was related positively to increasing mid-story canopy closure and selected soil types. Sandy soils and open over-story canopy that created favorable burrowing, nesting, and foraging conditions were important influences in active burrow occurrence. Vegetation management techniques, such as prescribed fire, mid-story control, and intermediate forest stand thinning, are recommended on <b>gopher</b> <b>tortoise</b> conservation areas and connective corridor habitats on commercial timberlands.
