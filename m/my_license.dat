While I derived great satisfaction from years of practicing law, I have not done so for 15 years and do not envision returning to the profession. I am very sorry for what I did, and I deeply apologize." [...] By giving up his license, Berger avoided cross-examination by the Bar Counsel regarding details of his thefts.|$|E
6000|$|He {{also agreed}} to meet our wishes as to the {{character}} of the ceremony. [...] "I'll make it as short as you like," [...] he said. [...] "I'll reduce it to its lowest legal terms," [...] and with this understanding I procured <b>my</b> <b>license</b> and returned to Hanover.|$|E

6000|$|... "Under favour, my lord," [...] replied his domestic, [...] "it is unequal dealing to {{be equally}} {{offended}} by my speech and by my silence.

60|$|IN {{due course}} I got <b>my</b> <b>license.</b> I was a pilot now, full fledged. I dropped into casual employments; no misfortunes resulting, {{intermittent}} work gave place to steady and protracted engagements.

But by and by the war came, commerce was suspended, my occupation was gone.|$|E
60|$|But {{whenever}} we see things done wildly, but taken tamely, then the State is growing insane. For instance, I {{have a gun}} license. For all I know, this would logically allow me to fire off fifty-nine enormous field-guns day and night in my back garden. I {{should not be surprised}} at a man doing it; for it would be great fun. But I should be surprised at the neighbours putting up with it, and regarding it as an ordinary thing merely because it might happen to fulfill the letter of <b>my</b> <b>license.</b>|$|E
60|$|So I asked {{permission}} of the Queen to let my son resume his studies, and of Mademoiselle to leave her for the time. Both were gracious, though the Queen told me I was going into a wasp's nest; while, on the other hand, Mademoiselle congratulated me on returning to those dear Parisians, and said she should not be long behind me. I was too much afraid of being hindered not to set out immediately after having received <b>my</b> <b>license,</b> so as {{to take advantage of}} the escort of some of the deputies with whom I had a slight acquaintance. I also hoped to avoid M. de Lamont's leave-takings, but I was not fortunate enough to do this. The absurd man, learning that I was on the point of departure, came rushing headlong into the court where the carriages stood, having first disordered his hair and untied his scarf, so as to give himself a distracted appearance, and thus he threw himself on his knees between me and the coach door, declaring that I was killing him and breaking his heart by my cruelty.|$|E
