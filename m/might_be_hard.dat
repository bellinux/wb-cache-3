500|$|Weak results {{hinting that}} the clique problem <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> to {{approximate}} {{have been known}} for a long time. [...] observed that, {{because of the fact that}} the clique number takes on small integer values and is NP-hard to compute, it cannot have a fully polynomial-time approximation scheme. If too accurate an approximation were available, rounding its value to an integer would give the exact clique number. However, little more was known until the early 1990s, when several authors began to make connections between the approximation of maximum cliques and probabilistically checkable proofs. They used these connections to prove hardness of approximation results for the maximum clique problem.|$|E
500|$|Ikumi created other girl–animal {{combinations}} while {{designing the}} four other Mew Mews, including a mouse girl with the same green coloring as Retasu. However, the mouse design {{was one of several}} designs rejected for use in the series as the choices were narrowed down. Once the main Mew Mew designs were finalized, Ikumi named them after various foods: Ichigo (Strawberry), Minto (Mint), Retasu (Lettuce), Bu-Ling (Pudding), and Zakuro (Pomegranate). During one of the project meetings, an unnamed editor remarked that the names <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> to remember and suggested naming the characters after various colors instead, but the food names were kept. Although Ikumi initially suggested calling Ichigo's main attack [...] "Strawberry Bell Bell" [...] as a joke, the editorial team thought it was funny and kept the name. Ikumi noted that future attack names were decided by which sounded funniest. The only character from Ikumi's Tokyo Black Cat Girl to retain his original name and general appearance was Masha, but his gender was changed to female in Tokyo Mew Mew.|$|E

500|$|Players at both clubs {{received}} {{the news with}} apprehension. As Ley put it, [...] "When you merge two clubs into one, you cannot have a squad of 45." [...] The Oxford team learned of the impending merger and the new name from Smith {{in the dressing room}} at Belle Vue just before the match against Doncaster on 16 April. Mark Jones, one of the Oxford midfielders, recalled that the room [...] "went totally quiet", and that his first thought was that it <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> to him to keep his place in the first team with Reading's players also on the books. According to Jones, Smith attempted to assuage the Oxford players' fears by telling them that [...] "we're only doing it so we can buy Kerry Dixon. All your places are safe". Alan Judge, the Reading goalkeeper, reported his team reacting in a similar way—indeed, he described the Reading players as even more worried as Oxford had far outperformed them in the League that season. Ley, who accompanied the Oxford team on the bus ride home after the game, recalled that the players were almost silent, their victory over Doncaster overshadowed by [...] "a feeling of incredulity, confusion, worry and fear".|$|E
2500|$|The {{earliest}} recorded {{beginnings of}} geometry {{can be traced}} to early peoples, who discovered obtuse triangles in the ancient Indus Valley (see Harappan Mathematics), and ancient Babylonia (see Babylonian mathematics) from around 3000 BC. Early geometry was a collection of empirically discovered principles concerning lengths, angles, areas, and volumes, which were developed to meet some practical need in surveying, construction, astronomy, and various crafts. Among these were some surprisingly sophisticated principles, and a modern mathematician <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> put to derive some of them without the use of calculus. For example, both the Egyptians and the Babylonians were aware of versions of the Pythagorean theorem about 1500 years before Pythagoras and the Indian Sulba Sutras around 800 B.C. contained the first statements of the theorem; the Egyptians had a correct formula for the volume of a frustum of a square pyramid; ...|$|E

40|$|Microprocessor cores {{are a major}} {{challenge}} in the test arena: not only is their complexity always increasing, but also their specific characteristics intensify all difficulties.

It overcomes the main limitations of previous methodologies and provides significantly better results. Human intervention is limited to the enumeration of all assembly instructions. Also internal parameters of the optimizer are auto-adapted. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the approach. ...|$|R

Bob had some virtues and was throwing himself away, although, when one came to think of it, this was only true to some extent. What one meant was that he was throwing away his opportunities of rising to a higher plane; while Bob was satisfied with his present level Sadie was good enough for him, perhaps too good. Life together <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> for both, and there was a touch of pathos in his burning all the tender tokens that bound him to the past, though it was ominous that he kept the whisky.
