60|$|Darkness {{had already}} come on, and the coolies being far behind, we encamped {{by the light}} of the moon, shining through a thin fog, where we first found dwarf-juniper for fuel, at 13,500 feet. A little sleet fell during the night, which was tolerably fine, and not very cold; the <b>minimum</b> <b>thermometer</b> {{indicating}} 14.5 degrees.|$|E
60|$|At sunrise the {{following}} morning the sky was clear, with a light north wind; about two feet of snow had fallen, the drifts were deep, and all trace of the path obliterated. The <b>minimum</b> <b>thermometer</b> had fallen to 3.7 degrees, the temperature rose to 27 degrees at 9 a.m., after which the wind fell, {{and with it the}} thermometer to 18 degrees. Soon, however, southerly breezes set in, bringing up heavy masses of clouds.|$|E
60|$|The {{night was}} {{brilliant}} and starlight: the <b>minimum</b> <b>thermometer</b> fell to 27 degrees, a strong north-east wind blew down the valley, {{and there was}} a thick hoar-frost, with which the black yaks were drolly powdered. The broad leaves of R. Hodgsoni were curled, from the expansion of the frozen fluid in the layer of cells on the upper surface of the leaf, which is exposed to the greatest cold of radiation. The sun restores them a little, but as winter advances, they become irrecoverably cured, and droop at the ends of the branches.|$|E

40|$|Since the {{invention}} of maximum and <b>minimum</b> <b>thermometers</b> in the 18 th century, diurnal temperature extrema have been taken for air worldwide. At some stations, these extrema temperatures were collected at various soil depths also, and the behavior of these temperatures at a 10 -cm depth at the Tifton Experimental Station in Georgia is presented. After a precipitation cooling event, the diurnal temperature maxima drop to a minimum value and then start a recovery to higher values (similar to thermal inertia). This recovery represents a measure of response to heating {{as a function of}} soil moisture and soil property. Eight different curves were fitted {{to a wide variety of}} data sets for different stations and years, and both power and exponential curves were fitted to a wide variety of data sets for different stations and years.

60|$|The {{first and}} last of these {{temperatures}} were respectively 42.3 degrees and 46.4 degrees lower than Calcutta, which, with the proper deduction for latitude, allows 508 and 460 feet as equivalent to 1 degree Fahr. I left a <b>minimum</b> <b>thermometer</b> on the summit on the 9th of September, and removed it on the 27th, {{but it had been}} lifted and turned over by the action of the frost and snow on the loose rocks amongst which I had placed it; the latter appearing to have been completely shifted. Fortunately, the instrument escaped unhurt, with the index at 28 degrees.|$|E
60|$|The ground {{about the}} temple was snowed; and we descended {{a few hundred}} feet, to encamp in a most picturesque grove, among chaits and inscribed stones, with a peep of the temples above. Nightingales warbled deliciously night and morning, which rather {{surprised}} us, as the <b>minimum</b> <b>thermometer</b> fell to 27.8 degrees, and the ground next day was covered with hoar-frost; the elevation being 6,580 feet. These birds migrate hither in October and November, lingering in the Himalayan valleys till the cold of early spring drives them further south, to the plains of India, whence they return north in March and April.|$|E
60|$|The {{night was}} magnificent, {{brilliant}} starlight, with a pale mist over the mountains: the thermometer fell to 15.5 degrees at 7.30 p.m., and one laid upon wood with its bulb freely exposed, sank to 7.5 degrees: the snow sparkled with broad flakes of hoar-frost {{in the full}} moon, which was so bright, that I recorded my observations by its light. Owing to the extreme cold of radiation, I passed a very uncomfortable night. The <b>minimum</b> <b>thermometer</b> fell to 1 degrees in shade.* [At sunrise the temperature was 11.5 degrees; that of grass, cleared on the previous day from snow, and exposed to the sky, 6.5 degrees; that on wool, 2.2 degrees; and that {{on the surface of}} the snow, 0.7 degrees.] The sky was clear; and every rock, leaf, twig, blade of grass, and the snow itself, were covered with broad rhomboidal plates of hoar-frost, nearly one-third of an inch across: while the metal scale of the thermometer instantaneously blistered my tongue. As the sun rose, the light reflected from these myriads of facets had a splendid effect.|$|E
40|$|Air {{and soil}} {{temperatures}} were measured in 1974 - 85 in 3 clear felled areas and 3 neighbouring forest stands dominated by Norway spruce (Picea abies) in N. Finland. Daily temperatures were measured with thermograph plotters and maximum and <b>minimum</b> <b>thermometers</b> in meteorological screens (2 m {{above the ground}}), and a Grant device at 10 cm above the ground and at 5, 50 and 100 cm below ground level. Clear felling had no significant influence on air temperature at 2 m above the ground. The daily air temperature maxima at 10 cm were greater in the clear fell area than in the forest; the daily temperature minima at 10 cm were less in the clear fell area. Night frosts were {{more common in the}} clear fell area. Daily soil temperatures at 5 cm depth were 2 - 3 degrees C greater in the clear fell area than in the forest; temperatures at 50 cm and 100 cm depth were 3 - 5 degrees C greater.

Consequently, the differences between the clear fell area and the forest did not diminish during the 12 years following clear felling...|$|R
60|$|The {{observations}} for temperature {{were taken}} with every precaution to avoid radiation, and the thermometers were constantly {{compared with a}} standard, and the errors allowed for. The maximum thermometer with a steel index, I found to be extremely liable to derangement and very difficult to re-adjust. Negretti's maximum thermometer was not known to me during my journey. The spirit <b>minimum</b> <b>thermometers</b> again, are easily set to rights when out of order, but in every one (of six or seven) which I took to India, by several makers, the zero point receded, the error in some increasing annually, even to-6 degrees in two years. This seems due to a vaporisation of the spirit within the tube. I have seen a thermometer of this description in India, of which the spirit seemed to have retired wholly into the bulb, and which I was assured had never been injured. In wet-bulb observations, distilled water or rain, or snow water was used, but I never found the result to differ from that obtained by any running fresh water, except such as was polluted to the taste and eye.|$|R
50|$|The party made {{atmospheric}} measurements at {{the peak}} of the mountain for purposes of determining its elevation.

The alcohol <b>minimum</b> recording <b>thermometer</b> read 7 °F. These measurements, with others taken at Fort Gibbon and Valdez, were reduced by C. E. Griffin, Topographic Engineer of the United States Geological Survey, to produce an elevation for Denali of 20,384 feet. The precise figure measured by the United States Geological Survey in 2015 is 20,310 feet.|$|R
60|$|He {{rubbed his}} eyes. The riddle of his {{surroundings}} was confusing {{but his mind}} was quite clear--evidently his sleep had benefited him. He {{was not in a}} bed at all as he understood the word, but lying naked on a very soft and yielding mattress, in a trough of dark glass. The mattress was partly transparent, a fact he observed with a sense of insecurity, and below it was a mirror reflecting him greyly. About his arm--and he saw with a shock that his skin was strangely dry and yellow--was bound a curious apparatus of rubber, bound so cunningly that it seemed to pass into his skin above and below. And this bed was placed in a case of greenish coloured glass (as it seemed to him), a bar in the white framework of which had first arrested his attention. In the corner of the case was a stand of glittering and delicately made apparatus, for the most part quite strange appliances, though a maximum and <b>minimum</b> <b>thermometer</b> was recognisable.|$|E
60|$|It became dark {{before we}} reached the Cholamoo lake, where we lost our way amongst glaciers, moraines, and marshes. We {{expected}} to have seen {{the lights of the}} camp, but were disappointed, and as it was freezing hard, we began to be anxious, and shouted till the echos of our voices against the opposite bank were heard by Tchebu Lama, who met us in great alarm for our safety. Our camp was pitched some way from the shore, on a broad plain, 16,900 feet above the sea.* [This, which is about the level of the lake, gives the Lachen river a fall of about 1500 feet between its source and Kongra Lama, or sixty feet per mile following its windings. From Kongra Lama to Tallum it is 140 feet per mile; from Tallum to Singtam 160 feet; and from Singtam to the plains of India 50 feet per mile. The total fall from Cholamoo lake to its exit on the plains of India is eighty-five feet per mile. Its length, following its windings, is 195 miles, upwards of double the direct distance.] A cold wind descended from Donkia; yet, though more elevated than Yeumtso, the climate of Cholamoo, from being damper and misty, was milder. The <b>minimum</b> <b>thermometer</b> fell to 14 degrees.|$|E
60|$|The {{weather was}} {{generally}} drizzling or rainy, {{and we were}} getting very tired of our captivity; but I beguiled the time by carefully keeping my meteorological register,* [During the thirty days spent at Tumloong, the temperature was mild and equable, with much cloud and drizzle, but little hard rain; and we experienced violent thunder-storms, followed by transient sunshine. Unlike 1848, the rains did not cease this year before the middle of December; nor had there been one fine month since April. The mean temperature, computed from 150 observations, was 50.2 degrees, and from the maximum and <b>minimum</b> <b>thermometer</b> 49.6 degrees, which is a fair approximation to the theoretical temperature calculated for the elevation and month, and allows a fall of 1 degree for 320 feet of ascent. The temperature during the spring (from 50 observations) varied during the day from 2.4 degrees to 5.8 degrees {{higher than that of}} the air, the greatest differences occurring morning and evening. The barometric tide amounted to 0.091 between 9.50 a.m. and 4 p.m., which is less than {{at the level of the}} plains of India, and more than at any greater elevation than Tumloong. The air was always damp, nearly saturated at night, and the mean amount of humidity for ninety-eight observations taken during the day was only 0.850, corresponding to a dew-point of 49.6 degrees, or 5.2 degrees below that of the air.] and by reducing many of my previous observations. Each morning we were awakened at daybreak by the prolonged echos of the conchs, trumpets, and cymbals, beaten by the priests before the many temples in the valley: wild and pleasing sounds, often followed by their choral chants. After dark we sat over the fire, generally in company with a little Lepcha girl, who was appointed to keep us in fire-wood, and who sat watching our movements with childish curiosity. Dolly, as we christened her, was a quick child and a kind one, intolerably dirty, but very entertaining from her powers of mimicry. She was fond of hearing me whistle airs, and procured me a Tibetan Jews'-harp,* [This instrument (which is common in Tibet) is identical with the European, except that the tongue is produced behind the bow, in a strong steel spike, by which the instrument is held firmer to the mouth.] with which, and coarse tobacco, which I smoked out of a Tibetan brass pipe, I wiled away the dark evenings, whilst my cheerful companion amused himself with an old harmonicon, to the enchantment of Dolly and our guards and neighbours.|$|E
40|$|A {{prominent}} {{feature of}} previous long-term temperature studies {{has been the}} appearance of warming since the 1880 s, this often being taken as evidence for anthropogenic-induced global warming. In this investigation, the long-term, annual, mean temperature record (1844 - 1992) of the Armagh Observatory (Armagh, North Ireland), a set of temperature data based on maximum and <b>minimum</b> <b>thermometers</b> that predates the 1880 s and correlates well with northern hemispheric and global standards, is examined for evidence of systematic variation, in particular, as related to solar-cycle forcing and secular variation. Indeed, both appear to be embedded within the Armagh data. Removal of these effects, each contributing about 8 % to the overall reduction in variance, yields residuals that are randomly distributed. Application of the 10 -year moving average to the residuals, furthermore, strongly suggests that {{the behavior of the}} residuals is episodic, inferring that (for extended periods of time) temperatures at Armagh sometimes were warmer or cooler (than expected), while at other times they were stable. Comparison of cyclic averages of annual mean temperatures against the lengths of the associated Hale cycles (i. e., the length of two, sequentially numbered, even-odd sunspot cycle pairs) strongly suggests that the temperatures correlate inversely (r = - 0. 886 at less than 2 % level of significance) against the length of the associated Hale cycle. Because sunspot cycle 22 ended in 1996, the present Hale cycle probably will be shorter than average, implying that temperatures at Armagh over this Hale cycle will be warmer (about 9. 31 q 0. 23 C at the 90 % confidence level) than average (= 9. 00 C) ...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To assess {{quality of}} storage of {{vaccines}} in the community. DESIGN [...] Questionnaire survey of general practices {{and child health}} clinics, and monitoring of storage temperatures of selected refrigerators. SETTING [...] Central Manchester and Bradford health districts. SUBJECTS [...] 45 general practices and five child health clinics, of which 40 (80 %) responded. Eight practices were selected for refrigeration monitoring. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Adherence to Department of Health guidelines for vaccine storage, temperature range to which vaccines were exposed over two weeks. RESULTS [...] Of the 40 respondents, only 16 {{were aware of the}} appropriate storage conditions for the vaccines; eight had <b>minimum</b> and maximum <b>thermometers</b> but only one of these was monitored daily. In six of the eight practices selected for monitoring of refrigeration temperatures the vaccines were exposed to either subzero temperatures (three fridges) or temperatures up to 16 degrees C (three). Two of these were specialised drug storage refrigerators with an incorporated thermostat and external temperature gauges. CONCLUSION [...] Vaccines were exposed to temperatures that may reduce their potency. Safe storage of vaccines in the clinics cannot be ensured without adhering to the recommended guidelines. Provision of adequate equipment and training for staff in maintaining the "cold chain" and the use and care of equipment are important components of a successful immunisation programme...|$|R
40|$|In {{the last}} two decades of the 20 th century, most {{meteorological}} networks replaced traditional mechanical thermometers (usually placed inside a Stevenson screen) with electronic ones (usually in the open air, protected by a plastic shelter). Impacts of such instrumental change on the climatology of daily minimum and daily maximum temperatures are assessed here, by analysing eleven years of data from a couple of stations operating in parallel in the same test site in a location with a Mediterranean climate. Seasonal effects (i. e. monthly biases ranging from - 0. 8 !C to + 1 °C) were detected on maximum temperatures, but they compensate each other in the yearly average. In <b>minimum</b> temperatures, electronic <b>thermometers</b> introduced a - 0. 75 °C bias, regardless of the season. Specific biases due to horizontal winds and to vertical heat fluxes were also detected and studied. Two possible causes of the climatological bias were investigated: local wind conditions and different responses to turbulent heat fluctuations by electronic and mechanical thermometers. Other possible causes exist, but they could not be investigated {{due to a lack of}} data. The present study shows that, in the test site, replacing traditional thermometers with modern ones in climatological networks introduced an underestimate in minimum temperatures. This suggests that in locations with similar microclimates the real atmospheric warming could be even greater than that observed to date...|$|R

Klinkerfues had developed a bifilar-hygrometer which was widely used but did not prove in laymen's hands. After that Lambrecht built a hair hygrometer, [...] "Model Klinkerfues". In 1873, after separation from Klinkerfues, Lambrecht started to build new meteorological instruments such as polymeters, dew point monitors, and aspiration psychrometers. His weather telegraphs, weather columns and combinations of different meteorological instruments were in use at several bigger cities and foreign health resorts before World War I. Lambrecht also built medical thermometers. At the same time he developed the so-called <b>minimum</b> <b>thermometer</b> with a narrowing of the lumen of the capillary which is placed above the mercury container.
