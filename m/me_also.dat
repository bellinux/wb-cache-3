25|$|Other wartime entries {{have their}} moments, such as They Stooge to Conga ({{considered}} {{the most violent}} Stooge short), Higher Than a Kite, Back From the Front (all 1943), Gents Without Cents (1944) and the anti-Japanese The Yoke's on <b>Me</b> (<b>also</b> 1944). However, taken in bulk, the wartime films are decidedly substandard. No Dough Boys (again 1944) is often considered {{the best of these}} farces. The team, made up as Japanese soldiers for a photo shoot, is mistaken for genuine saboteurs by a Nazi ringleader (Vernon Dent, the Stooges' primary foil). The highlight of the film features the Stooges engaging in nonsensical gymnastics (the real spies are renowned acrobats) for a skeptical group of enemy agents.|$|E

Giddens said, [...] "although {{some of the reasons}} for the events in the film were changed, the main storyline remained unchanged". Asked if he was pressured by the recent success of Taiwanese films at the box office, he replied [...] "No, I am more pressured by whether the film is nice to watch, whether it will succeed in the box office, and whether it will become an embarrassment for <b>me.</b> <b>Also,</b> if the film is not nice, it will be a letdown to Chen-tung and Michelle, who have been working so hard".|$|E

[...] As the rights afforded to these settlers by Catherine were gradually diminished, many of the settlers headed to North America, with Saskatchewan offering good farmland, and other incentives for immigrants. Taube reflected fondly on his experiences growing up in Saskatchewan, noting: [...] "Certainly, there is nothing about my first 21 years in Saskatchewan, taken {{in the context of}} those times that I would wish to be changed. [...] The advantages that I enjoyed include: [...] the marvelous experience of growing up on a farm, which taught me an appreciation of nature, and taught <b>me</b> <b>also</b> to discipline myself to get necessary jobs done..." ...|$|E
