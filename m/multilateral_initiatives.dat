It is also a forum for member and non-member economies to share information about various bilateral and <b>multilateral</b> <b>initiatives.</b> IPEEC supported initiatives are open to both member and non-member nations as well as the private sector.IPEEC is coordinating the implementation of the Group of 20 (G20) Energy Efficiency Action Plan, which was agreed by G20 leaders in late 2014 as a practical approach to strengthening voluntary international energy efficiency collaboration. And since July 2016, IPEEC is coordinating the Energy Efficiency Leading Programme (EELP) that provides the basis for a ‘comprehensive, flexible, and adequately-resourced’ framework for strengthened voluntary collaboration on energy efficiency among G20 members and beyond.|$|E
50|$|On November 16, 2011, he was {{appointed}} Minister of Foreign Affairs of Monti’s government. During his tenure, he held 1,483 meetings and events, which covered 91 different countries with 75 official visits abroad and 138 meetings with other foreign ministers, of which 63 in Italy and 75 overseas. He was member of the “Westervelle Group”, composed by 11 European Foreign Ministers and aimed at supporting initiatives for “More Europe” in the European political integration process. He actively promoted UN moratorium {{on the death penalty}} resolution and other campaigns for human rights and fundamental freedoms. Within the EU and NATO, Minister Terzi was a strong advocate for a renewed “Pratica di Mare” partnership with the Russian Federation in order to settle energy and rule of law issues, as well as European security concerns raising from East-West diverging positions on conventional and nuclear forces. He gave impulse to policies of diversification of energy supplies to Italy, by negotiating and signing during the 2012 UNGA in New York the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) for the Trans Adriatic Pipeline (TAP) between Albania, Greece and Italy, by strengthening relations with transitional governments in Libya, and enhancing economic cooperation with Mozambique, Angola and Algeria. He pursued a reinforced Mediterranean political and economic cooperation in the Mediterranean region in the “5+5 Dialogue” framework, with Spain, France, Italy, Malta, Portugal, Libya, Morocco, Mauritania and Tunisia, and other bilateral and <b>multilateral</b> <b>initiatives</b> through the EU, NATO and the UN. At the same time Minister Terzi did strive for a closer EU political, economic, and scientific cooperation with Israel and for the reactivation of the MEPP on the base of the two-state solution. During his tenure, Minister Terzi engaged in a more active Italian diplomacy for the Horn of Africa, by visiting and signing new agreements with Ethiopia and Somalia.|$|E

Methods: The authors analyzed the contribution of enhanced Internet connectivity and access to electronic information resources to the performance of malaria research staff and their institutes through a cross-sectional questionnaire survey of 181 respondents at 14 health research centers in Africa. Separate reviews of bandwidth usage, requests for document delivery, and publications in peer reviewed journals support the data of the survey. Results: The MIMCom network makes a positive contribution to the performance of malaria researchers and support staff at the sites reviewed by improving e-mail exchange, access to published literature, and research proposal development and submission.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} tax {{reforms in}} OECD countries {{over the last}} 20 years {{and how they are}} related to tax competition. Both individual countries ’ reforms and <b>multilateral</b> <b>initiatives</b> and developments are covered. This is followed by an overview of the empirical evidence on tax competition. Our conclusion is that the evidence for some interdependence in tax setting behaviour is strong, although the exact process driving this remains unclear. While the most basic tax competition models fail to explain the development in OECD countries, {{there is more than one}} possible explanation for the reforms undertaken if more advanced models are considered. The <b>multilateral</b> <b>initiatives</b> that were implemented however do not seem to be related to resource-based tax competition, instead they are about taxing rights.

40|$|Abstract. “When spider webs unite, {{they can}} tie up a lion ” (Ethiopian folk adage). The <b>Multilateral</b> <b>Initiative</b> on Malaria Communications Network (MIMCom) {{facilitates}} {{a new way}} of doing research in Africa and African scientists’ participation in the international scientific community. The MIMCom supports full access to the Internet and the resources of the WorldWide Web at 19 research sites in 11 African countries. Furthermore, the MIMCom project comprises two websites: one includes links to resources, databases, and publications as well as a document delivery service for full text journal articles, and the other is a research agenda specific website with a server for a research network desiring to share raw data. Other important components of MIMCom are training and evaluation components. The MIMCom was conceived in 1997 by African researchers and has been designed, implemented, and overseen by the U. S. National Library of Medicine in collaboration with partners in Africa, the United States, and the United Kingdom. This project demonstrates clearly that it can make a positive difference in the functioning of remote research sites in Africa, in terms of site growth and productivity and in the professional lives of individual researchers. This report reviews the project’s background, methods of operation with an emphasis on local needs and priorities, cost effectiveness, and local responsibility; results focusing on a technical network; documentation of the system and two-way exchange of information; the MIMCom website; a network approach to research; and financial sustainability.
