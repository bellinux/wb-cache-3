5000|$|Locking pliers, mole grips (<b>mole</b> <b>wrench)</b> or vise-grips are pliers {{that can}} be locked into position, using an {{over-center}} action. One side of the handle includes a bolt {{that is used to}} adjust the spacing of the jaws, {{the other side of the}} handle (especially in larger models) often includes a lever to push the two sides of the handles apart to unlock the pliers. [...] "Mole" [...] and [...] "Vise-Grip" [...] are trade names of different brands of locking pliers, yet locking pliers are generically referred to as [...] "Vise-Grips" [...] by mechanics and do-it-yourself hobbyists and craftspeople.|$|E
40|$|Since 1990 we {{have used}} partially-threaded 6. 5 mm {{cannulated}} steel screws to fix 14 slipped upper femoral epiphyses (SUFE). Six patients have come to screw removal, and in five of them we failed to remove {{at least one of}} the screws. In each of these five hips, the retained screw became increasingly more difficu!tto move and eventually became stuck, resisting even the use of a <b>mole</b> <b>wrench.</b> The screws were cut and left in situ (Fig. 1). In one patient deep infection led to osteomyelitis which required extensive surgery to remove the metalwork and treat the infection. Discussion. Cannulated screws are commonly used because they can be accurately placed under fluoroscopic control through small incisions. It is possible to avoid penetration of the femoral head and the clustering of screws which may lead to chondrolysis and segmental avascular necrosis (Lehman et a! 1984; Stambough et a! 1986). The removal ofsuch screws has been recommended because of the risk of trochanteric bursitis (Crandall, Gabriel and Akbarnia 1992), difficulty with subsequent arthroplasty, a possible stress riser effect leading to fracture (Stambough et a! 1986) and the theoretical risk of neop!asia from long-term corrosion of metal implants (Black 1988). Cannulated screws were designed with reverse cutting threads to facilitate easy removal, but the increasing bone mass of adolescence seems to result in dense bony ingrowth around the screws. Considerable torque is required to cut a way out, and the thread tends to clog with bone swarf that has nowhere to go. Some screws may be placed abutting the cortex and this further increases the risk of the thread engaging dense bone during removal (Fig. 1) ...|$|E
