In her first term in parliament, Jeanette Fitzsimons, leader of the New Zealand Greens, introduced a members bill to the House on 25 May 2000, the New Zealand Nuclear Free Zone Extension Bill. This, she says, sets out to fill gaps in the 1987 legislation and seeks to prohibit the transit of nuclear armed or propelled warships and transport of nuclear waste though the 200 mile Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ).

The mixed oxide was composed of uranium and plutonium oxides where the plutonium was of weapons-grade composition. The study {{was part of the}} Fissile Materials Disposition Program that considered the possibility of fueling commercial reactors with weapons plutonium. The isotopic composition of the spent fuel is estimated at various times following discharge. Actinides and all significant fission products are considered.

40|$|Neutronic {{parameter}} uncertainty induced by nuclear data uncertainty is quantified for several light water reactor fuel cells composed of {{different combinations of}} fissile/fertile nuclides.

40|$|Two {{new fuel}} {{assembly}} designs for light water reactors using advanced mixed-oxide fuels {{have been proposed}} to reduce the radiotoxicity of used nuclear fuel discharged from nuclear power plants. The research efforts of this thesis {{are the first to}} consider the effects of burnup on advanced <b>mixed-oxide</b> <b>fuel</b> assembly performance and thermal safety margin over an assembly?s expected operational burnup lifetime. In order to accomplish this, a new burnup-dependent thermal-hydraulic analysis methodology has been developed. The new methodology models many of the effects of burnup on an assembly design by including burnup-dependent variations in fuel pin relative power from neutronic calculations, assembly power reductions due to fissile content depletion and core reshuffling, and fuel material thermal-physical properties. Additionally, a text-based coupling method is developed to facilitate the exchange of information between the neutronic code DRAGON and thermal-hydraulic code VIPRE- 01. The new methodology effectively covers the entire assembly burnup lifetime and evaluates the thermal-hydraulic performance against ANS Condition I, II, and III events with respect to the minimum departure from nucleate boiling ratio, peak cladding temperatures, and fuel centerline temperatures. A comprehensive literature survey on the thermal conductivity of posed fuel materials with burnup-dependence has been carried out to model the advanced materials in the thermal-hydraulic code VIPRE- 01. Where documented conductivity values are not available, a simplified method for estimating the thermal conductivity has been developed. The new thermal conductivity models are based on established FRAPCON- 3 fuel property models used in the nuclear industry, with small adjustments having been made to account for actinide additions. Steady-state and transient thermal-hydraulic analyses are performed with VIPRE- 01 for a reference UO 2 assembly design, and two advanced <b>mixed-oxide</b> <b>fuel</b> assembly designs using the new burnup-dependent thermal-hydraulic analysis methodology. All three designs maintain a sufficiently large thermal margin with respect to the minimum departure from nucleate boiling ratio, and maximum cladding and fuel temperatures during partial and complete loss-of-flow accident scenarios. The presence of a thin (Am,Zr) O 2 outer layer on the fuel pellet in the two advanced <b>mixed-oxide</b> <b>fuel</b> assembly designs increases maximum fuel temperatures during transient conditions, but does not otherwise greatly compromise the thermal margin of the new designs...|$|E
