25|$|<b>Michael</b> <b>Kinsley</b> {{was hired}} as the Opinion and Editorial (Op-Ed) Editor in April 2004 to help {{improve the quality of}} the opinion pieces. His role was controversial, as he forced writers to take a more decisive stance on issues. In 2005, he created a Wikitorial, the first Wiki by a major news organization. Although it failed, readers could combine forces to produce their own {{editorial}} pieces. He resigned later that year.|$|E
25|$|Buchanan {{returned}} to his column and began regular appearances as a broadcast host and political commentator. He co-hosted a three-hour daily radio show with liberal columnist Tom Braden called the Buchanan-Braden Program. He delivered daily commentaries on NBC radio from 1978 to 1984. Buchanan started his TV career as a regular on The McLaughlin Group and CNN's Crossfire (inspired by Buchanan-Braden) and The Capital Gang, making him nationally recognizable. His several stints on Crossfire occurred between 1982 and 1999; his sparring partners included Braden, <b>Michael</b> <b>Kinsley,</b> Geraldine Ferraro, and Bill Press.|$|E
25|$|In June 1982, {{the channel}} {{launched}} {{a late night}} political debate program, Crossfire, which featured discussions on political issues from opposing viewpoints; it was hosted by liberal Tom Braden and conservative Pat Buchanan. The idea of the program came about when Braden and Buchanan debated on a daily radio show in 1978. The show soon became popular and was moved to a primetime slot. In 1985, Buchanan left the show to become the communications director for the Ronald Reagan presidential administration. He was replaced by conservative columnist Robert Novak, who had already co-hosted another political program on CNN, Evans & Novak and was also a regular on The McLaughlin Group at the time. Buchanan returned to the show in 1987, replacing Novak. In 1989, Braden was replaced by <b>Michael</b> <b>Kinsley,</b> a liberal columnist for Time, and magazine editor for The New Republic.|$|E
50|$|At launch, {{the site}} was hailed by the rival Philadelphia Inquirer as “startlingly good” and a “tour de force” that outshined <b>Michael</b> <b>Kinsley’s</b> new {{high-profile}} digital magazine Slate.|$|R
5000|$|A notable {{departure}} from the positive reception was <b>Michael</b> <b>Kinsley's</b> review in the Times itself. He noted: [...] "Having seen Page One, I don’t know much more than I did before. The movie, directed by Andrew Rossi, is, in a word, a mess." ...|$|R

Robert Wright's article "Faux Pas," in the October 11, 1993 issue which castigates Economic Policy Institute President Jeff Faux for his criticism of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA); Robert Wright's reply; Simon Seba Montefiore's article "Mother Dolores" in the October 4, 1993 issue; <b>Michael</b> <b>Kinsley's</b> "Trading Places" in the October 4 issue in which he criticizes the Republicans who may desert the NAFTA cause; Praise for Jacob Weisberg for finding the unpublished "Blythe Spirit," by William Faulkner, in Weisberg's September 6, 1993 article...|$|R
500|$|The {{article was}} an instant sensation. [...] The {{journalist}} <b>Michael</b> <b>Kinsley</b> has said, [...] "It's {{hard to imagine a}} magazine article today having the kind of impact that [...] article and others had in those days in terms of everyone talking about it purely {{on the basis of the}} writing and the style." ...|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) are {{carpooling}} with FBI agents <b>Michael</b> <b>Kinsley</b> and Carla Stonecypher {{en route}} to a [...] "team building" [...] seminar. When they are stopped at a roadblock by local police, Mulder decides to investigate. As Mulder and Scully venture into the woods, they are informed by Officer Michele Fazekas that no conclusive evidence has been found to support Louis' report of a shooting. Mulder sees this as a perfect opportunity to ditch the seminar. Later, Mulder explains to Scully that no species native to North America will attack a stronger member of its prey when there is a weaker target available.|$|E
500|$|On May 26, 1995, Bill Gates {{sent the}} [...] "Internet Tidal Wave" [...] {{memorandum}} to Microsoft executives. The memo described Netscape with their Netscape Navigator as a [...] "new competitor 'born' on the Internet." [...] The memo outlines Microsoft's failure {{to grasp the}} Internet's importance, and in it Gates assigned [...] "the Internet {{the highest level of}} importance" [...] from then on. Microsoft began to expand its product line into computer networking and the World Wide Web. On August 24, 1995, it launched a major online service, MSN (Microsoft Network), as a direct competitor to AOL. MSN became an umbrella service for Microsoft's online services, using Microsoft Passport (now called a Microsoft account) as a universal login system for all of its web sites. The company continued to branch out into new markets in 1996, starting with a joint venture with NBC to create a new 24-hour cable news television station, MSNBC. The station was launched on July 15, 1996 to compete with similar news outlets such as CNN. Microsoft also launched Slate, an online magazine edited by <b>Michael</b> <b>Kinsley,</b> which offered political and social commentary along with the cartoon Doonesbury. In an attempt to extend its reach in the consumer market, the company acquired WebTV, which enabled consumers to access the Web from their televisions. Microsoft entered the personal digital assistant (PDA) market in November with Windows CE 1.0, a new built-from-scratch version of their flagship operating system, designed to run on low-memory, low-performance machines, such as handhelds and other small computers. 1996 saw the release of Windows NT 4.0, which brought the Windows 95 GUI and Windows NT kernel together.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Michael</b> <b>Kinsley,</b> in The New York Times Book Review, lauded Hitchens's [...] "logical flourishes and conundrums, {{many of them}} {{entertaining}} to the nonbeliever".

2500|$|He {{transformed}} a former Christian Science {{church in the}} First Hill neighborhood in Seattle, into a civic crossroads hosting chamber music, best-selling authors, dialogue on national issues and presidential candidates. Town Hall Seattle became a springboard for the Bill Bradley presidential campaign in 2000. In 2004, Howard Dean drew large crowds, but they didn't translate into caucus votes. Slate magazine founder <b>Michael</b> <b>Kinsley</b> {{referred to it as}} [...] "The Church of David Brewster." ...|$|E
2500|$|In [...] "It's Not Apartheid", {{published}} in The Washington Post, columnist <b>Michael</b> <b>Kinsley</b> states that Carter [...] "makes {{no attempt to}} explain [...] " [...] which he calls [...] "a foolish and unfair comparison, unworthy {{of the man who}} won – and deserved – the Nobel Peace Prize." [...] To start with, no one has yet thought to accuse Israel of creating a phony country in finally acquiescing {{to the creation of a}} Palestinian state. Palestine is no Bantustan. Furthermore, Israel has always had Arab citizens. No doubt many Israelis have racist attitudes toward Arabs, but the official philosophy of the government is quite the opposite, and sincere efforts are made to, for example, instill humanitarian and egalitarian attitudes in children.|$|E
2500|$|Jeffrey Rosen and <b>Michael</b> <b>Kinsley</b> echo Ginsburg, {{arguing that}} a {{legislative}} movement {{would have been}} the correct way to build a more durable consensus in support of abortion rights. William Saletan wrote, [...] "Blackmun's [...] papers vindicate every indictment of Roe: invention, overreach, arbitrariness, textual indifference." [...] Benjamin Wittes has written that Roe [...] "disenfranchised millions of conservatives on an issue about which they care deeply." [...] And Edward Lazarus, a former Blackmun clerk who [...] "loved Roe's author like a grandfather," [...] wrote: [...] "As a matter of constitutional interpretation and judicial method, Roe borders on the indefensible.... Justice Blackmun's opinion provides essentially no reasoning in support of its holding. And in the almost 30 years since Roes announcement, no one has produced a convincing defense of Roe on its own terms." ...|$|E
2500|$|Congress has an {{important}} role in national defense, including the exclusive power to declare war, to raise and maintain the armed forces, and to make rules for the military. Some critics charge that the executive branch has usurped Congress's constitutionally defined task of declaring war. While historically presidents initiated the process for going to war, they asked for and received formal war declarations from Congress for the War of 1812, the Mexican–American War, the Spanish–American War, World War I, and World War II, although President Theodore Roosevelt's military move into Panama in 1903 did not get congressional approval. In the early days after the North Korean invasion of 1950, President Truman described the American response as a [...] "police action". According to Time magazine in 1970, [...] "U.S. presidents [...] ordered troops into position or action without a formal congressional declaration a total of 149 times." [...] In 1993, <b>Michael</b> <b>Kinsley</b> wrote that [...] "Congress's war power has become the most flagrantly disregarded provision in the Constitution," [...] and that the [...] "real erosion [...] began after World War II." [...] Disagreement about the extent of congressional versus presidential power regarding war has been present periodically throughout the nation's history." ...|$|E
