40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to define an impact of the cultivar, year and {{cultivation}} area of the standard Croatian winter wheat on the <b>bread-making</b> <b>quality.</b> The <b>bread-making</b> <b>quality</b> of cultivars ‘Divana’, ‘Žitarka’ and ‘Sana’ from the crop years 1998, 2000, 2002, 2004 and 2006, and from Zagreb and Osijek location was analyzed. Wheat from the cultivar tests cultivated under the same agro technological conditions was used for this testing. The tested winter wheat <b>bread-making</b> <b>quality</b> primarily depended on the genetic properties of cultivar. However, climatic changes occurring during the last 10 years, particularly the increase in temperatures and quantity of rainfalls in the period of the grain development, ripening and harvest, had a negative influence on the wheat breadmaking quality. Even though the average values of tested quality factors were within the expected range, a significant dependence of the cultivar Divana breadmaking quality upon the cultivation climate conditions was proven. Sana cultivar has proven to be the most stable, whereas its <b>bread-making</b> <b>quality</b> was the lowest. For all three cultivars the <b>bread-making</b> <b>quality</b> has been decreasing in the last 10 years, although the quality of winter wheat from the Zagreb area was higher since the climate conditions were more favourable...|$|R

40|$|To dissect {{the most}} {{important}} determinant of wheat <b>bread-making</b> <b>quality,</b> gluten protein-types from 128 flours of organically grown German wheat varieties Bussard and Orestis were investigated by quantitative HPLC and SDS-PAGE procedures using protein standards. Both varieties exhibit great differences in gluten strength (> 34 %) at two locations and between two years determined by SDS-sedimentation volume (SDS-SV), a measure of <b>bread-making</b> <b>quality.</b> Unexpectedly, {{the results showed that}} neither concentrations of gliadin, gluten, HMW-glutenin or glutenin could explain the observed variation in SDS-SV even if protein concentrations were equal. In the case of glutenin this was found to be due to a low glutenin recovery resulting from a partial insolubility of glutenin in propanol (protein recoveries from 78 % to 95 %). Further investigations under the conditions of a complete glutenin extraction led to the identification and characterization of glutenin macropolymer (GMP) which affected the <b>bread-making</b> <b>quality</b> of wheat significantly. This effect was associated with higher molecular weights of GMP which may cause growing gluten networks compared to simple glutenin. Moreover, it was finally shown that quantitatively the concentrations of GMP (mg/ 100 mg flour) were independent of protein concentrations.

However, the organization, recombination and expression of LMW-GS genes and their functional mechanism in bread-making are not well understood. Here we report a systematic molecular analysis of LMW-GS genes located at the orthologous Glu- 3 loci (Glu-A 3, B 3 and D 3) of bread wheat using complementary approaches (genome wide characterization of gene members, expression profiling, proteomic analysis). Fourteen unique LMW-GS genes were identified for Xiaoyan 54 (with superior <b>bread-making</b> <b>quality).</b> Molecular mapping and recombination analyses revealed that the three Glu- 3 loci of Xiaoyan 54 harbored dissimilar numbers of LMW-GS genes and covered different genetic distances. The number of expressed LMW-GS in the seeds was higher in Xiaoyan 54 than in Jing 411 (with relatively poor <b>bread-making</b> <b>quality).</b> This correlated with the finding of higher numbers of active LMW-GS genes at the A 3 and D 3 loci in Xiaoyan 54. Association analysis using recombinant inbred lines suggested that positive interactions, conferred by genetic combinations of the Glu- 3 locus alleles with more numerous active LMW-GS genes, were generally important for the recombinant progenies to attain high Zeleny sedimentation value (ZSV), an important indicator of <b>bread-making</b> <b>quality.</b> A higher number of active LMW-GS genes tended {{to lead to a}} more elevated ZSV, although this tendency was influenced by genetic background.

Hardness index, Zeleny and SDS sedimentation tests had the highest coefficient of variability (13. 51 %, 11. 83 % and 11. 03 %, respectively).

A field experiment under two cropping intensities, called intensive and extensive production systems, was conducted in the 1999 / 2000 growing season at the Faculty of Agriculture in Zagreb. The use of an intensive production system compared to an extensive system significantly improved hectolitre weight (1. 9 %), protein content (16. 9 %), wet gluten (59. 7 %), sedimentation (67. 2 %), falling number (7. 8 %), water absorption (2. 0 %), dough development time (78. 2 %), dough stability (900. 0 %), dough resistance (138. 1 %) and farinograph quality number (142. 8 %), while it had no effect on gluten index, flour yield and physical grain properties (1000 -grain weight, grain length, width and thickness).

40|$|Abstract Background Low-molecular-weight {{glutenin}} subunits (LMW-GS) strongly {{influence the}} <b>bread-making</b> <b>quality</b> of bread wheat. These proteins are encoded by a multi-gene family {{located at the}} Glu-A 3, Glu-B 3 and Glu-D 3 loci on the short arms of homoeologous group 1 chromosomes, and show high allelic variation. To characterize the genetic and protein compositions of LMW-GS alleles, we investigated 16 Aroona near-isogenic lines (NILs) using SDS-PAGE, 2 D-PAGE and the LMW-GS gene marker system. Moreover, the composition of glutenin macro-polymers, dough properties and pan bread quality parameters were determined for functional analysis of LMW-GS alleles in the NILs. Results Using the LMW-GS gene marker system, 14 – 20 LMW-GS genes were identified in individual NILs. At the Glu-A 3 locus, two m-type and 2 – 4 i-type genes were identified and their allelic variants showed high polymorphisms in length and nucleotide sequences. The Glu-A 3 d allele possessed three active genes, the highest number among Glu-A 3 alleles. At the Glu-B 3 locus, 2 – 3 [*]m-type and 1 – 3 [*]s-type genes were identified from individual NILs. Based on the different compositions of s-type genes, Glu-B 3 alleles {{were divided into two}} groups, one containing Glu-B 3 a, B 3 b, B 3 f and B 3 g, and the other comprising Glu-B 3 c, B 3 d, B 3 h and B 3 i. Eight conserved genes were identified among Glu-D 3 alleles, except for Glu-D 3 f. The protein products of the unique active genes in each NIL were detected using protein electrophoresis. Among Glu- 3 alleles, the Glu-A 3 e genotype without i-type LMW-GS performed worst in almost all quality properties. Glu-B 3 b, B 3 g and B 3 i showed better quality parameters than the other Glu-B 3 alleles, whereas the Glu-B 3 c allele containing s-type genes with low expression levels had an inferior effect on <b>bread-making</b> <b>quality.</b> Due to the conserved genes at Glu-D 3 locus, Glu-D 3 alleles showed no significant differences in effects on all quality parameters. Conclusions This work provided new insights into the composition and function of 18 LMW-GS alleles in bread wheat. The variation of i-type genes mainly contributed to the high diversity of Glu-A 3 alleles, and the differences among Glu-B 3 alleles were mainly derived from the high polymorphism of s-type genes. Among LMW-GS alleles, Glu-A 3 e and Glu-B 3 c represented inferior alleles for <b>bread-making</b> <b>quality,</b> whereas Glu-A 3 d, Glu-B 3 b, Glu-B 3 g and Glu-B 3 i were correlated with superior <b>bread-making</b> <b>quality.</b> Glu-D 3 alleles played minor roles in determining quality variation in bread wheat. Thus, LMW-GS alleles not only affect dough extensibility but greatly contribute to the dough resistance, glutenin macro-polymers and bread quality. </p...|$|R

The fractions differed in gliadin composition as evidenced by lactate-PAGE, SDS-PAGE and RP-HPLC. The fractions were virtually free of lipid. Isolated fractions were evaluated for their effects on <b>bread-making</b> <b>quality</b> using a pan loaf baking test. The unbound fraction (D) contained lipids, mainly mono- and digalactosyldiacylglycerols, and it increased (cv. Obelisk flour) or decreased (cv. Camp Rémy flour) loaf volume at additions of up to 0 · 5 % on flour weight. At higher levels of addition it had a strong negative effect on loaf volume. The unfractionated extract (containing some fraction D) or the recombined fractions improved loaf volume. All individual fractions improved loaf volume, but to different extents. For {{four out of five}} fractions the improvement corresponded to the statistical prediction of loaf volume by RP-HPLC gliadin peak areas. © 1994 Academic Press. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Wheat {{quality is}} an {{important}} target trait. Previous studies mainly focus on storage protein, but their contribution to quality is partial, and most loci for quality are still undetected. Wild species of wheat are valuable resources for wheat improvement and introgression lines (ILs) are the ideal materials for detecting quantitative trait loci (QTL). In this study, a set of 82 BC 5 F 2 - 6 ILs, carrying a range of introgressed chromosome segments from a synthetic hexaploid wheat Am 3 (Triticum carthlicum x Aegilops tauschii), was developed and genotyped with 170 microsatellite markers. QTL analysis was performed for 14 parameters, sodium dodecyl sulfate sedimentation volume, grain protein content (GPC), grain hardness and 11 mixograph parameters, associated with end-use quality of wheat, using the materials harvested in three environments. This led to the detection of 116 QTL, with c. 95 % of the positive alleles contributed by Am 3. Six important and novel genomic regions for <b>bread-making</b> <b>quality</b> were found on chromosomes 2 D, 3 A, 4 A, 4 B, 5 A and 6 A.

However, LMW-GSs display high polymorphic protein complexes encoded by multiple genes, and elucidating the complex LMW-GS gene family in bread wheat remains challenging. In the present study, using conventional polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with conserved primers and high-resolution capillary electrophoresis, we developed a new molecular marker system for identifying LMW-GS gene family members. Based on sequence alignment of 13 LMW-GS genes previously identified in the Chinese bread wheat variety Xiaoyan 54 and other genes available in GenBank, PCR primers were developed and assigned to conserved sequences spanning the length polymorphism regions of LMW-GS genes. After PCR amplification, 17 DNA fragments in Xiaoyan 54 were detected using capillary electrophoresis. In total, 13 fragments were identical to previously identified LMW-GS genes, and the other 4 were derived from unique LMW-GS genes by sequencing. This marker system was also used to identify LMW-GS genes in Chinese Spring and its group 1 nulli–tetrasomic lines. Among the 17 detected DNA fragments, 4 were located on chromosome 1 A, 5 on 1 B, and 8 on 1 D. The results suggest that this marker system is useful for large-scale identification of LMW-GS genes in bread wheat varieties, and for the selection of desirable LMW-GS genes to improve the <b>bread-making</b> <b>quality</b> in wheat molecular breeding programmes...|$|R

40|$|In view of {{the poor}} <b>bread-making</b> <b>quality</b> of the wheat grown in The Netherlands, {{only a small part}} of {{production}} is used for baking of bread. Therefore quality improvement is a major aim of plant breeding. Unfortunately, breeding for breadmaking quality is hampered by its complexity. The suitability of wheat flour for the manufacture of bread depends on the composition of a large number of kernel components, such as lipids, starch and proteins, and this kernel composition in turn depends on agronomic measures, climate and on the genetic make-up of the varieties. Moreover the suitability of wheat flour for the baking of bread depends on technological conditions, such as those in milling and in the baking process. Another drawback in breeding for improved <b>bread-making</b> <b>quality</b> is the lack of simple and fast techniques to assess <b>bread-making</b> <b>quality.</b> Dough and baking- tests, which take much labour and time are required to determine such characteristics as dough strength and elasticity, loaf volume and crumb structure. Plant breeders in various countries have been aware that the kernel proteins play a major role in determining the <b>bread-making</b> <b>quality.</b> The total amount of kernel proteins, which is largely determined by environment and as such difficult to change by breeding, is positively correlated with the <b>bread-making</b> <b>quality.</b> More useful characteristics for breeding are the genetically determined differences in protein quality, which result in differences in <b>bread-making</b> <b>quality</b> at a given amount of protein, i. e. in differences in the ratio between loaf volume and protein content. Small-scale tests to estimate protein quality (e. g. the SDS sedimentation, the Pelshenke dough-ball or the residue-protein tests) have been used in breeding programmes to predict <b>bread-making</b> <b>quality.</b> However the results of these tests not only depend on the genotype but also reflect environmental conditions. After the development of biochemical techniques for separation of proteins, <b>bread-making</b> <b>quality</b> has been related to the composition of kernel proteins. Because protein composition is genetically determined, it has been proposed as a tool in breeding for bread- making quality. In this thesis the <b>bread-making</b> <b>quality</b> of wheat was studied in relation to differences in type and amount of the various high molecular weight glutenin (HNWg) subunits. These storage proteins are encoded by genes at three homoeologous loci (Glu- 1 loci: Glu-A 1 , Glu-B 1 and Glu-D 1 ); at each locus several alleles occur that differ in type or number (0 - 2) of subunits encoded. At the start of this study, the relation between variation in the HMWg subunit genotype and breadmaking quality has been studied extensively by various research groups. These studies revealed the occurrence of alleles that differ in their contribution to breadmaking quality. In fact, a large part of the variation in <b>bread-making</b> <b>quality</b> was ascribed to variation in the HMWg genotype. Though it was known that variation in type of the HMWg subunits also affects the quality of wheat grown in The Netherlands, it was not known to what extent differences in bread- making quality can be ascribed to differences in the HMWg subunit genotype. Two general aspects for breeding for <b>bread-making</b> <b>quality</b> required further research: 1) the difficulties which may occur in the identification of the HMWg subunit alleles 2) the variation in amount of the HMWg subunits on which aspect very little information was available. Variation in the amounts of groups of kernel proteins, such as the gliadins and the glutenins, is of prime importance for <b>bread-making</b> <b>quality</b> (Chapter 1). Therefore, it was worthwhile studying whether genetic variation in the amounts of the HMWg subunits could also be used in breeding for <b>bread-making</b> <b>quality.</b> Variation in the amounts of the subunits is probably also important for other applications of wheat in which gluten characteristics are important, such as the manufacture of pastas and pastry. Another reason for studying the HMWg subunits quantitatively is that the cause of the 'differences' in quality of HMWg alleles is not known. Differences in the structure of the subunits (the intrinsic quality of the subunits) have beensuggested, but also differences in the level of gene expression (the quantity of the subunits) could be responsible for the differences in quality between the alleles. Therefore a major aim was to study the variation in amount of individual HMWgsubunits and to elucidate the mechanisms underlying this variation. Chapter 2 shows that variation in the HMWg genotype does have a large effect on <b>bread-making</b> <b>quality</b> of wheat lines grown in The Netherlands. These lines represent a wide genetic background and can be considered to be random lines with respect to bread- making quality. A baking test developed in The Netherlands was used to determine quality. In general, the ranking of the alleles for quality was in agreement with the ranking found in studies in other countries. Because different baking tests and different criteria for quality were used in the various studies, the relationship found can be considered as generally valid. Most important is the variation at the glu-D 1 locus. The allele encoding the subunits 5 + 10 is related to a higher bread- making quality than its allelic counterpart encoding 2 + 12. In the literature, it is generally assumed that the effect of allelic variation at the 3 homoeologous (Glu- 1 loci on quality is additive. The so-called scoring systems to screen lines for <b>bread-making</b> <b>quality</b> are based on this assumption. However this study shows that interactions between homoeologous loci do occur: an effect of allelic variation at the Glu-A 1 and Glu-B 1 loci was present only in combination with the 'high-quality' glu-D 1 allele encoding the subunits 5 + 10. The mechanisms underlying these interactions are not known. At this point, it should be noted that in Dutch wheat varieties, 'poor quality' alleles predominate at each of the three (Glu- 1 loci (Chapter 7). Therefore it is important to introduce 'high-quality alleles' into Dutch breeding programmes, in particular the glu-D 1 allele encoding 5 + 10. About 20 % of the variation in the breeding lines was ascribed to differences in HMWg genotype, which is much lower than in some of the other published studies. The remainder of the variation in <b>bread-making</b> <b>quality</b> was ascribed to variation in environmental conditions and to genetic variation in the composition of other kernel components, such as lipids, starch, gliadins and low molecular weight glutenin subunits. Therefore, genetic variation in other kernel components should also be taken into consideration when selecting for <b>bread-making</b> <b>quality,</b> although the HMWg subunit genes can be considered as major genes in determining that quality. Which of these other components is most important in this respect is not known. A large number of HMWg alleles are present in varieties and in species related to bread-wheat. Because the contribution to quality is known for only a small number of these alleles, there could be alleles with an unknown 'quality' in breeding programmes. Unintended introduction of 'poor-quality' alleles can be avoided as far as these alleles can be distinguished from 'high-quality' ones. The HMWg alleles are routinely identified by determining the relative mobility (R m) with one-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) of the subunits encoded. As shown in Chapter 3, the resolution of this technique may be insufficient for an unambiguous identification because alleles may be present that differ only slightly in the R m of the subunits encoded. Unambiguous identification by two-dimensional electrophoresis is especially necessary before introducing species related to bread-wheat in breeding programmes. To study variation in the amount of the HMWg subunits effectively, one must develop a method for a reliable quantification of the subunits present in the kernel. Since one of the objectives was to investigate the amounts of the subunits encoded by different alleles and because a genotype may possess 'poor-quality' alleles in combination with 'high-quality' alleles, one must use a method that allows the quantification and identification of each subunit. In most methods described in the literature, reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) is used to separate the HMWg subunits. However the sample preparation required before RP-HPLC is a potential source of error and may even result in systematic losses of the HMWg subunits, as discussed in Chapter 4. In addition, these methods require electrophoretic analysis to identify the HMWg subunits present in the RP-HPLC peaks. As an alternative, an efficient method was developed and is described in Chapter 4. The HMWg subunits are separated from other kernel proteins - and from each other - by SDS-PAGE. Scanning densitometry is used to determine the amount of Coomassie brilliant blue (CBB) adsorbed by the protein after get staining, which is a measure for the amount of protein. The routine method for gel staining resulted in subunit bands with a low staining intensity. So it was essential to introduce a new and more sensitive staining method. Since sample preparation is not required in the method, systematic losses of the HMWg subunits can be avoided. Because the identification of the subunits is based on their R m during SDS-PAGE, the method allows quantification and identification of the subunits in one analysis. As shown in Chapter 5, the amount of individual (HNWg) subunits is subject to environmental variation. An increase in nitrogen fertilizer applied to two varieties (Obelisk and Urban), grown at the same trial field, resulted in an increase in both the total amount of kernel proteins and the amounts of all HMWg subunits. Variation in protein content accounted for 88 % and 87 % of the variation, respectively, in|$|R

Materials and Methods: Ten winter wheat cultivars were grown in 4 different locations during two years in a randomized complete block (RCB) experimental design with three repetitions at each location. Samples were collected and subjected to quality analysis and determination of HMW-GS composition by sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Results: Considering theHMW-GS composition, the most frequent subunit at the Glu-A 1 locus was N, at the Glu-B 1 locus 7 + 9 and at the Glu-D 1 locus 2 + 12. The analyzed cultivar Demetra, with subunits 5 + 10 at the Glu-D 1 locus, has shown the best <b>bread-making</b> <b>quality.</b> Among cultivars with subunits 2 + 12 at the Glu-D 1 locus, the cultivars with subunits 7 + 8 at the Glu-B 1 locus have shown on average better characteristics of gluten strength with regard to higher values of Gluten Index and resistance to exstensibility ratio (R/Ext). The results of the linear correlation between quality parameters and HMW-GS composition, expressed as the Glu- 1 score, have shown the most significant (P< 0. 05) influence ofHMW- -GS on Gluten Index r= 0. 42), dough energy (r= 0. 48) and dough maximum resistance (r= 0. 47). Conclusions: These results indicated that the presence of HMW-GS 5 + 10 and 7 + 8 contributes to higher <b>bread-making</b> <b>quality</b> of analyzed cultivars.
