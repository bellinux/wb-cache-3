5|$|The Government of Croatia {{decided that}} <b>multicast</b> (simultaneous analog and digital DVB-T {{broadcasting}} {{of the main}} channels) was to cease in 2010. The territory of Croatia was split into nine digital-TV allotment regions. The analog broadcast network was switched off gradually (by the digital-TV allotment regions) beginning on 26 January 2010. The process was completed, achieving digital switchover on 5 October 2010, but geographically isolated areas were left with analog broadcasts. The last analog TV transmitter in Croatia was shut down on 30 September 2011, as DVB-T coverage was extended to 98.5 percent of households in Croatia and no less than 95 percent of households {{in each of the}} allotment regions. Approximately 6,000 households were left with no reception of DVB-T or analog TV broadcasts.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Network-wide {{broadcasting}} and <b>multicasting</b> are {{two important}} routing schemes used in group communications. In network-wide broadcasting, generated packets {{at the source}} node are distributed to all nodes in the network, while <b>multicasting</b> delivers the packets only to {{a subset of the}} nodes by creating and maintaining a data dissemination structure. Due to the overhead in <b>multicasting,</b> in certain situations, it is more efficient to use network-wide broadcasting instead of <b>multicasting,</b> even when the data is destined to a subset of the nodes. In this paper we analyze a specific broadcasting protocol and a specific <b>multicasting</b> protocol for two performance metrics, namely spectrum efficiency and energy efficiency, and determine the conditions that make one of them preferable over the other.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the application of}} non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) to a multi-user network with mixed <b>multicasting</b> and unicasting traffic. The proposed design of beamforming and power allocation ensures that the unicasting performance is improved while maintaining the reception reliability of <b>multicasting.</b> Both analytical and simulation results are provided {{to demonstrate that the}} use of the NOMA assisted multicast-unicast scheme yields a significant improvement in spectral efficiency compared to orthogonal multiple access (OMA) schemes which realize <b>multicasting</b> and unicasting services separately. Since unicasting messages are broadcasted to all the users, how the use of NOMA can prevent those <b>multicasting</b> receivers intercepting the unicasting messages is also investigated, where it is shown that the secrecy unicasting rate achieved by NOMA is always larger than or equal to that of OMA. This security gain is mainly {{due to the fact that}} the <b>multicasting</b> messages can be used as jamming signals to prevent potential eavesdropping when the <b>multicasting</b> and unicasting messages are superimposed together following the NOMA principle...|$|R
40|$|<b>Multicasting</b> is an {{important}} interprocessor communication pattern existing in various parallel application algorithms. Mesh-connected topology {{is one of the}} most thoroughly investigated network topologies for parallel processing. The torus network has been proposed for metropolitan area networks (MAN).

It is NP-complete in general to find an optimal <b>multicasting</b> algorithm which minimizes both time and traffic. This thesis proposes two kind of <b>multicasting</b> algorithms for torus/mesh networks, the VH algorithm with a time complexity of O(kD), and the DIST algorithm with a time complexity of O(kDN), where k is the number of destination nodes. D is the maximum distance, and N is the total number of nodes in the network. The VH algorithm guarantee that every destination node can receive the message from the source in a minimum <b>multicasting</b> time. The DIST algorithm generates less traffic compared to the VH algorithm, but at the price of an increased <b>multicasting</b> time...|$|R
25|$|OSPF {{does not}} use a {{transport}} protocol, such as UDP or TCP, but encapsulates its data directly in IP packets with protocol number 89. This {{is in contrast to}} other routing protocols, such as the Routing Information Protocol (RIP) and the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP). OSPF implements its own transport layer error detection and correction functions. OSPF uses <b>multicast</b> addressing for distributing route information within a broadcast domain. OSPF reserves the <b>multicast</b> addresses 224.0.0.5 (IPv4) and FF02::5 (IPv6) for all SPF/link state routers (AllSPFRouters) and 224.0.0.6 (IPv4) and FF02::6 (IPv6) for all Designated Routers (AllDRouters). For non-broadcast networks, special provisions for configuration facilitate neighbor discovery. OSPF <b>multicast</b> IP packets never traverse IP routers, they never travel more than one hop. The virtual link feature can be used to create an adjacency tunnel across multiple hops. The OSPF protocols gathers information regarding all link states in the domain in its link state database, and is thus not a link layer protocol itself, but is – based on the purpose of the protocol; to exchange and calculate optimal paths through the network for IP destination addresses – most correctly classified as an Internet layer protocol. The OSPF protocol, when running on IPv4, can operate securely between routers, optionally using a variety of authentication methods to allow only trusted routers to participate in routing. OSPFv3, running on IPv6, does not support protocol-internal authentication. Instead, it relies on IPv6 protocol security (IPsec).|$|E

40|$|The {{existing}} algorithms for deadlock-free <b>multicasting</b> in interconnection networks {{assume the}} Hamiltonian {{property in the}} networks topology. However, these networks fail to be Hamiltonian {{in the presence of}} faults. This paper investigates the use of Euler circuits in deadlock-free <b>multicasting.</b> Not only are Euler circuits known to exist in all connected networks, a fast polynomial-time algorithm exists to find an Euler circuit in a network. We present a <b>multicasting</b> algorithm which works for both regular and irregular topologies. Our algorithm is applicable to store-andforward as well as wormhole-routed networks. We show that at most two virtual channels are required per physical channel for any connected network. We also prove that no virtual channels are required to achieve deadlock-free <b>multicasting</b> on a large class of networks. Unlike other existing algorithms for deadlock-free <b>multicasting</b> in faulty networks, our algorithm requires a small amount of information to be stored at each node. The potential of our technique is further illustrated with the help of various examples. A performance analysis on wormhole-routed networks shows that our routing algorithm outperforms existing <b>multicasting</b> procedures. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — An Ad hoc Network {{consists}} {{of a set of}} autonomous mobile nodes that communicates via multi-hop wireless communication in an infrastructure-less environment. In such a network group communication takes place by implementing a <b>multicasting</b> technique. This <b>multicasting</b> technique is intended to provide energy and bandwidth efficiency with secure content delivery. The project concentrates on identifying such an efficient <b>multicasting</b> technique. On the basis of comparison of <b>multicasting</b> protocols, Protocol for Unified <b>Multicasting</b> through Announcement (PUMA) has been chosen for initial implementation. PUMA does not rely on any unicast routing approach. It delivers data at a higher efficiency, while also provides a tight bound for control overhead {{in a wide range of}} network scenarios. Secure communication is a major concern in PUMA, especially because <b>multicasting</b> protocols are applied in areas such as audio / video conferencing, corporate communicati-ons, collaborative and groupware applications. For secure communication, the performance of RSA and ElGamal was examined; Findings say that RSA’s execution time is comparatively less. To guarantee the data integrity in ad hoc networks, SHA- 1 and MD 5 are analyzed with RSA. Finally, the integration of PUMA has been done with RSA and SHA 1 to guarantee more security...|$|R

40|$|<b>Multicasting</b> in {{the optical}} domain has been {{recently}} shown to provide substantial savings {{in terms of}} the network-wide average packet hop distance and the total number of transceivers in the network. Current proposed <b>multicasting</b> architectures [e. g., Splitter-and-Delivery (SaD) ] employ power splitting mechanisms which have the side effect of high fabrication cost due to the large number of splitters and the need for optical amplifiers. We propose a low-cost novel architecture called Tap-and-Continue (TaC) for realizing <b>multicasting.</b> This architecture provides a natural evolution from current unicast cross-connects and is based on tapping devices. We prove that any <b>multicasting</b> session can be feasibly realized in networks employing only TaC cross-connects, and the problem of finding the optimal multiple-destination minimum cost trail in such networks is NP-complete. Therefore, we develop a 4 -approximation algorithm for multiple-destination routing. Simulation results demonstrate that the TaC cross-connect provides a realistic, cost-effective approach for implementing <b>multicasting</b> with negligible blocking degradation especially in multifiber networks...|$|R
40|$|Abstract- The {{conceptual}} {{shift in}} expectations of wireless users from voice towards multimedia, from availability towards acceptable quality, and from stand-alone towards group-oriented computing {{has a big}} impact on the needs of today’s networks in terms of mobility, quality of service (QoS) support, and <b>multicasting.</b> Ad hoc networks can provide users with these features. However, it is necessary to develop QoS <b>multicasting</b> strategies for them. This paper defines the building blocks of an ad hoc QoS <b>multicasting</b> (AQM) protocol, which achieves <b>multicasting</b> efficiency by tracking resource availability in a node’s neighbourhood based on previous reservations, and announces the QoS conditions at session initiation. When nodes join a session with certain QoS requirements, this information is used to select the most appropriate routes. AQM is compared to a non-QoS scheme with emphasis on service satisfaction for sessions. By applying QoS restrictions, AQM improves the <b>multicasting</b> session efficiency.
