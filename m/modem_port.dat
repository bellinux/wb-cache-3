50|$|DECserver 900GM/GMXThe DECserver 900GM was {{a network}} access server that {{supported}} up to 16 full <b>modem</b> control <b>ports,</b> or 32 eight-wire partial <b>modem</b> control <b>ports.</b> The DECserver 900GMX was {{identical to the}} DECserver 900GM, except that it supported up to 8 full <b>modem</b> control <b>ports,</b> or 16 eight-wire partial <b>modem</b> control <b>ports.</b> The ports were used to connect asynchronous devices including terminals, printers, modems, or PCs to an Ethernet local area network (LAN). The DECserver 900GM was configured with four 68-pin D-connectors (two for the DECserver 900GMx), and provided full or limited <b>modem</b> control. Each <b>port</b> supported sixteen data rates from 75 bit/s to 115.2 kbit/s. The DECserver 900GM included 4 MB of standard memory, and could be expanded to 8 MB.|$|R

50|$|Two serial ports are {{provided}} on a Quadra 605; one 8-pin Mini-DIN printer port and one 9-pin Mini-DIN <b>modem</b> <b>port</b> {{similar to the}} printer port, but with an extra pin to supply +5 V power from the ADB power supply. Apple recommends no more than 100 mA should be drawn from this pin.|$|E
50|$|In addition, a {{modified}} Communication Slot II was {{present on the}} Power Macintosh G3 personality cards. This slot only provided power and serial lines, leaving the PCI pins disconnected. For this reason {{it could only be}} used with modem cards. As in other machines, the external <b>modem</b> <b>port</b> is disabled when a modem is installed in the Communication Slot.|$|E
50|$|All netbooks on {{the market}} today support Wi-Fi {{wireless}} networking and many can be used on mobile telephone networks with data capability (for example, 3G). Mobile data plans are supplied under contract {{in the same way as}} mobile telephones. Some also include ethernet and/or <b>modem</b> <b>ports,</b> for broadband or dial-up Internet access, respectively.|$|R
5000|$|Starting in the mid-1990s, several {{manufacturers}} such as U.S. Robotics produced [...] "modem terminal servers". Instead {{of having}} RS-232 ports, these would directly incorporate an analog modem. These devices {{were commonly used}} by Internet service providers to allow consumer dial-up. Modern versions interface to an ISDN PRI instead of having analog <b>modem</b> <b>ports.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The DSLAM {{equipment}} collects {{the data}} from its many <b>modem</b> <b>ports</b> and aggregates their voice and data traffic into one complex composite [...] "signal" [...] via multiplexing. Depending on its device architecture and setup, a DSLAM aggregates the DSL lines over its Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM), frame relay, and/or Internet Protocol network (i.e., an IP-DSLAM using PTM-TC Transfer Mode - Transmission Convergence) protocol(s) stack.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to the respective expansion bus pins, these slots also carried audio and serial lines. The serial bus was shared with the external <b>modem</b> <b>port.</b> Because the power and serial pins remained unchanged between the two slots, {{it was possible to}} design a universal modem card which could work in either. Network adapters, however, needed to be designed for one or the other.|$|E
50|$|A major {{disadvantage}} to both is {{that when}} a modem card is installed in the Communication Slot, the modem serial port {{on the back of}} the computer is disabled. Computers that came with this card installed had the <b>modem</b> <b>port</b> blanked out (though the connector was still present). Further, due to its unconventional architecture, the Performa 5200's printer port would be disabled if a network adapter was installed in the Communication Slot.|$|E

50|$|There was an NGO Centre {{and other}} {{supplementary}} facilities. The NGO Centre was located at Phase I of the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre. There are meeting, briefing rooms, {{and a computer}} area with desktop workstations, LAN and <b>modem</b> <b>ports</b> and wireless LAN access. In addition, other equipment like printers, photocopiers, telephone and fax lines were also provided. Moreover, extra meeting rooms and briefing rooms were set up for them when necessary. Reservation of these facilities was held by the WTO Secretariat.|$|R
25|$|The {{original}} Mac Mini {{includes two}} USB 2.0 and one FireWire 400 port. Networking is supported with 10/100 Ethernet and V.92 <b>modem</b> <b>ports,</b> while 802.11b/g and Bluetooth were additional build-to-order options. The modem was later {{omitted from the}} Mac Mini, but an external modem remained an option. External displays are supported via a DVI port. Adaptors are also available for VGA, S-Video, and composite video. The system contains a built-in speaker and an analog 1/8-inch stereo Mini jack for sound out {{at the back of}} the case.|$|R
50|$|It has a {{built-in}} RJ-42 <b>Modem</b> Connection <b>port</b> with which {{you were able to}} connect to (now defunct) servers to play against other players all around Japan.|$|R
5000|$|However, the 60-pin AV {{connector}} was {{not suitable}} for such connections, and users expected to plug [...] "modems" [...] into the <b>modem</b> <b>port.</b> Although the existing serial ports could be adapted to run in [...] "AV mode" [...] {{in the same fashion}} that the older versions could run in RS-232 or networking mode, the line adaptor required more power that the port could supply. Apple solved this problem by adding a 9th pin to the existing 8-pin Mini-DIN connector. The result was GeoPort.|$|E
50|$|In January 1988, a new ROM {{firmware}} update was issued to address bugs {{in the new}} memory-expandable IIc. Changes included better detection of installed RAM chips, correction of a problem when using the serial <b>modem</b> <b>port</b> in terminal mode, and a bug fix for keyboard buffering. The ROM upgrade was available free of charge only to owners of the memory expansion IIc. This was the final change to the Apple IIc; it would be superseded that September by the Apple IIc Plus (identified as ROM version ‘5’).|$|E
5000|$|... "The BIG news is from {{a company}} called General Computer. They {{announced}} a Mac mod called HyperDrive, which is a RAM expansion to 512K, and the installation of a 10 meg hard disk with the controller INSIDE THE MACINTOSH. This allows direct booting from the hard disk, free <b>modem</b> <b>port,</b> no serial I/O to slow things down, and no external box to carry around. Price is $2,795 on a 128K machine or $2195 on a 512K machine. They do the installation or {{you can buy a}} kit from your dealer." ...|$|E
50|$|The 165 added a 33 MHz {{processor}} and larger standard hard drive. Along with the PowerBook 145B, {{this would be}} the last of the true 100 series PowerBooks and the last Apple laptop to include two serial (printer and <b>modem)</b> <b>ports.</b> Its entry level descendant, the PowerBook 150, would continue to sell for another year and though it used the 140 case design, its internals were actually based on the PowerBook Duo and PowerBook 190, a 100-series PowerBook in name only as it used the PowerBook 5300's motherboard and case as well.|$|R

50|$|Another {{new feature}} was the NetWare Asynchronous Services Interface (NASI). It allowed network sharing of {{multiple}} serial devices, such as <b>modems.</b> Client <b>port</b> redirection occurred via an MS-DOS or Microsoft Windows driver allowing companies to consolidate modems and analog phone lines.|$|R
5000|$|The PDT series were desktop systems {{marketed as}} [...] "smart {{terminal}}s". The /110 and /130 were {{housed in a}} VT100 terminal enclosure. The /150 was housed in a table-top unit which included two 8-inch floppy drives, three asynchronous serial ports, one printer port, one <b>modem</b> <b>port</b> and one synchronous serial port and required an external terminal. All three employed the same chipset as used on the LSI-11/03 and LSI-11/2 in four [...] "microm"s. There is an option which combines two of the microms into one dual carrier, freeing one socket for an EIS/FIS chip. The /150 in combination with a VT105 terminal was also sold as MiniMINC, a budget version of the MINC-11.|$|E
50|$|The DM 600 PVR is {{the same}} small size as the DM 500 but {{includes}} an IDE interface allowing to add an internal 2.5 in laptop-type hard disk drive, the box will only recognise 5600rpm drives. On the outside it adds an S-Video output connector and an analog <b>modem</b> <b>port.</b> It is built around the same IBM STBx25xx integrated controller, but features 32 MiB of flash and 96 MiB of RAM, of which 64 MiB are user-accessible. It is possible to change the tuner module, selecting between Satellite, Terrestrial and Cable versions. There is still just one SCART connector and no 7-segment LED display, just 2 status LEDs. The provided remote control unit {{is the same}} one supplied with the 7000, 7020 and 7025 and allows one to control the TV set as well.|$|E
50|$|The {{computer}} {{consists of}} a monitor which is the main computer and a keyboard. The computer {{was used as a}} computer terminal so there are no internal drives or daughter cards. The only computer component in the case is a motherboard with a <b>modem</b> <b>port,</b> keyboard port, and an aux. port. Termcap provides support for the Visual 50 by way of the entries named v50, vi50, v50am, or visual50, depending on the system. The computer uses on an SGS (now STMicroelectronics) Z8400AB1 CPU, based on the Zilog Z80A CPU. This CPU has an 8 bit data bus and a 16 bit address bus, and runs at 4 MHz. The keyboard is a Keytronic A65-0248, attached by a 4 wire telephone cord. The keyboard uses an Intel P8048H MCU, a common MCU for keyboards.|$|E
5000|$|A 'Server' device {{which houses}} an ADSL / optical fiber <b>modem,</b> 4 <b>port</b> gigabit switch, 802.11n/b/g Wifi access point/hotspot, {{powerline}} networking, router, 250GB NAS (extensible through USB and eSATA), wired and DECT wireless phone base, UPnP media server and more.|$|R
5000|$|Like the iMac, the iBook G3 had a PowerPC G3 CPU, and no legacy Apple interfaces. USB, Ethernet, <b>modem</b> <b>ports</b> and {{an optical}} drive were standard. The ports were left {{uncovered}} along the left side, {{as a cover}} {{was thought to be}} fragile and unnecessary with the iBook's new interfaces, which lacked the exposed pins of earlier connectors. When the lid was closed, the hinge kept it firmly shut, so {{there was no need for}} a latch on the screen. The hinge included an integrated carrying handle. Additional power connectors on the bottom surface allowed multiple iBook G3s to be charged on a custom-made rack. The iBook G3 was the first Mac to use Apple's new [...] "Unified Logic Board Architecture," [...] which condensed all of the machine's core features into two chips, and added AGP and Ultra DMA support.|$|R
50|$|The {{game was}} re-released in 1994 as Falcon Gold a {{compilation}} which included Art of the Kill video digitized on the CD collection, along with Operation Fighting Tiger and the announcement for Falcon 4.0. It noted for their early multiplayer support, as {{even the first}} version supported two players via a null <b>modem</b> serial <b>port</b> connection.|$|R
5000|$|The Commodore 16 is one {{of three}} {{computers}} in its family. The even-less-successful Commodore 116 is functionally and technically similar but was shipped in a smaller case with a rubber chiclet keyboard and was only available in Europe. The family's flagship, the Commodore Plus/4, was shipped in a similar case but has a 59-key full-travel keyboard (with a specifically advertised [...] "cursor key diamond" [...] of four keys, contrasted with the VIC-20's and C64's two + shift key scheme inherited from the PET), 64 KB of RAM, a <b>modem</b> <b>port,</b> and built-in entry-level office suite software. Although shipped with 16k from the factory, it was possible to modify the C16 for 64k, making it able to run any Plus/4 software except applications that required the user port or built-in programs.|$|E
50|$|New World ROM Macs are {{the first}} Macs where direct usage of the Open Firmware (OF) {{subsystem}} is encouraged. Previous PCI Power Macs used Open Firmware for booting, but the implementation was not complete; in these machines OF was only expected to probe PCI devices, then immediately hand control over to the Mac OS ROM. Because of this, versions 1.0.5 and 2.x had several serious bugs, as well as missing functionality (such as being able to load files from a HFS partition or a TFTP server). Apple also set the default input and output devices to ttya (the <b>modem</b> <b>port</b> on beige Macs), which {{made it difficult for}} normal users to get to Open Firmware; to do so it was necessary to either hook up a terminal, or change the Open Firmware settings from inside Mac OS using a tool such as Boot Variables or Apple's System Disk.|$|E
5000|$|From a {{practical}} user's point of view, three tangible features the C16 lacks are a <b>modem</b> <b>port</b> and VIC-20/C64-compatible Datasette and game ports. Commodore sold a C16-family-specific Datassette (the Commodore 1531) and joysticks, but third-party converters {{to allow the}} use of the abundant, and hence much less expensive, VIC-20/C64-type units soon appeared. The official reason for changing the joystick ports was to reduce RF interference. The C16's serial port (Commodore's proprietary [...] "serial CBM-488 bus", no relation to RS-232 and the like) was {{the same as that of}} the VIC-20 and Commodore 64, which meant that printers and disk drives, at least, were interchangeable with the older machines. Partially for cost reasons, the user port, designed for modems and other devices, was omitted from the C16 (although the connections for it were still present on the system board). Despite costing less than the Plus/4, the C16's keyboard was higher quality and easier to type on.|$|E
50|$|The buffer {{between a}} serial port (UART) and a <b>MODEM.</b> The COM <b>port</b> speed may be 38400 bit/s while the MODEM may {{only have a}} 14400 bit/s carrier.|$|R
50|$|In {{order to}} {{proactively}} manage the potentially {{large numbers of}} user connections to Prestel computers, special monitoring equipment was developed by Post Office Research & Development engineers. This was known by the acronym VAMPIRE, short for Viewdata Access Monitor and Priority Incident Reporting Equipment - a title which more or less describes its function. The device uses private circuits to connect <b>modem</b> <b>ports</b> on each computer or remote IRC multiplexor node, with a display on a television screen Prestel Prestel at the Regional Centre responsible for the administration of IRC. The VAMPIRE screen consisted of a matrix of small squares, so arranged that all ports for a single IRC computer could be displayed on a single television with each square representing the state of a port simply {{by means of the}} colour. Free ports were shown as green, occupied ports as yellow, incoming calls as pale blue and faulty ports as red, such that the state of a whole Prestel machine or concentrator node could be determined at a glance.|$|R
40|$|Apple {{introduced}} the Power Macintosh G 3 Blue and White (B & W) on January 5, 1999. The Power Macintosh G 3 line stayed in production until August 1999, {{and was replaced}} by the Power Macintosh G 4, which used the same chassis. The Power Macintosh G 3 originally cost between $ 1599 and $ 2900 depending on options. The three original Power Macintosh G 3 models shipped with a 300 MHz, 350 MHz, or 400 MHz PowerPC 750 (G 3) processor. Just pull on the small round handle {{on the side of the}} tower, and the entire side of the computer opens up. The G 3 's motherboard is mounted on that surface, giving you easy access for upgrading RAM or installed PCI cards. Apple added new ports (USB and the much-anticipated FireWire) that took the place of historic, and quickly becoming antiquated, Mac serial (printer and <b>modem)</b> <b>ports.</b> The Power Macintosh G 3 has two USB (12 Mbps) ports, two FireWire (400 Mbps) ports, one 10 / 100 BaseT Ethernet port, an RJ- 11 jack for an optional 56 K modem, a sound out and sound in jack, and one ADB (Apple Desktop Bus) port. The maximum RAM for the G 3 is 1 GB...|$|R
