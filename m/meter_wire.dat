This year (December 2008) we have installed Electric Field Meter (EFM- 100) and wire antenna {{for measuring the}} atmospheric electric field and conduction current. This instrument is deployed at Maitri, Antarctica and will be operated under any weather conditions like snow fall and strong blizzard etc. The study {{have been carried out}} during austral summer for the period of 2008 and 2009 at the Indian station, Maitri (70.75 °S, 11.75 °E, 117 m above mean sea level). The present work has been to understand the new instrument system in response to different meteorological conditions and on fairweather days. In this paper we have selected the data of the days during magnetically quiet period to minimize the upper atmospheric contribution. Fairweather’ conditions, i.e., days with absence of high winds, drifting or falling snow and clouds. The diurnal variation curve of electric field during fairweather days is a single periodic with a minimum at 04 : 00 UT and a maximum at 19 : 00 UT. But atmospheric current variation has minimum 03 : 00 UT for Maxwell current and conduction current. The maximum for Maxwell current is at 20 : 00 UT and 19 : 00 UT for the conduction current, which is very similar to the Carnegie curve. The measured electric field from the Passive antenna and EFM- 100 compared and is behaving similar variation. Using Maxwell current density and conduction current density we have separated the displacement current density.|$|E

In spite of {{the new generation of}} advanced analytical devices, the conservation/heritage management sector claims for some kind of simple, robust and low-cost device to monitor environmental acidity wherever necessary. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to offer a suitable alternative for the estimation of environmental acidity by means of detectors to be used without electrodes, solutions, pH <b>meters,</b> <b>wires</b> or batteries. Doped sol-gel thin coatings have been used as transductors for producing pH detectors. The coatings consist of a partially densified polysiloxane network and an organic dye sensitive to pH changes. The siloxane network behaves as a host for immobilisation of the dye molecules, in such a way that chemical-optical properties of the dye are preserved as far as possible. The transductors were applied on common glass substrates by dipping. Further heat-treatment allows the coating partial densification. The optical response of the detectors was analysed by VIS absorption spectroscopy, since a change of colour took place when the detectors were submitted to different pH buffered solutions. With the aim to investigate their optical behaviour as a function of pH, several experimental measurements were undertaken: absorption intensity; maximum spectral wavelength; colour coordinates; colour purity percentages. Time response and memory effect were also studied. The detector operation conditions for monitoring environmental acidity both indoor and outdoor are discussed...|$|R

40|$|This report {{describes}} {{the production of}} ERM®-EB 530 A, B and C, aluminium gold alloy material certified for the mass fraction of gold. The material was produced following ISO Guide 34 : 2009. Pure aluminium and pure gold were arc melted together to obtain a master alloy Al- 5 %Au (mass percent). The master alloy was melted with pure aluminium in a resistance furnace, casted in ingot and heat treated. The ingot was processed mechanically (wire drawing or rolling) to obtain thin wire (diameter 0. 5 mm and 1. 0 mm) and thin foil (thickness 0. 1 mm). Between-unit homogeneity was quantified and stability during dispatch and storage were assessed in accordance with ISO Guide 35 : 2006. Within-unit homogeneity was quantified to determine the minimum sample intake. The material was characterised by an intercomparison among laboratories of demonstrated competence and adhering to ISO/IEC 17025. Technically invalid results were removed but no outlier was eliminated on statistical grounds only. Uncertainties of the certified values were estimated {{in compliance with the}} Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement (GUM) and include uncertainties related to possible inhomogeneity, and instability and to characterisation. The material is intended for the calibration of methods (k 0 -neutron activation analysis). As any reference material, it can also be used for control charts or validation studies.
