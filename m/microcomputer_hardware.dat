In today's information based society, <b>microcomputer</b> <b>hardware</b> and software facilitates or inhibits access to information. The members of the public that have access to technology, and hence to information, are the haves; those without, the have nots of the information age. Because public libraries are closing at the rate of one a week, and, when providing computer based access, often charge, alternative sources must be found that provide the general public with technology based access. This baseline survey of general public access examines another potential provider of <b>microcomputer</b> <b>hardware</b> and software access, the public, two-year community college library/learning center (LRC), and answers three questions: first, to what extent are two-year, community college library/learning centers providing general public access to <b>microcomputer</b> <b>hardware</b> and software; second, what are the factors that could be limiting such access; and third, what relationships exist between demographic variables (region, size of student enrollment, size of taxing district population, and library/learning center budget) and the provision of general public access to microcomputer software and hardware?The findings show a large percentage (72 %) of LRC administrators agreed or strongly agreed that LRCs should be providing general public access to microcomputer software and hardware. A larger number (92 %) strongly agreed or agreed that providing general public access to information via <b>microcomputer</b> <b>hardware</b> and software is an important role. Most LRCs have <b>microcomputer</b> <b>hardware</b> (89 %) and provide on-site, general public access to it (57 %). Few loan <b>microcomputer</b> <b>hardware</b> to the public (2 %).

Only eight percent (8 %) loan/circulate software to the general public. Forty-six percent (46 %) provide access to data bases, such as ERIC. Few LRCs charge microcomputer related fees. Factors potentially limiting access include: policies and practices; licensing, copyright and legal restrictions; attitudes; technological inhibitors; and fees.

30|$|Finally, it {{is worth}} {{mentioning}} that the only KVM-specific tracepoints are kvm_entry kvm_entry and kvm_exitkvm_exit, which represent VMX mode transitions. Since these transitions are common to all hypervisors supporting hardware-assisted virtualization, our approach is therefore not specific to KVM. And, although these tracepoints are already included in Linux’s source tree, they can be added in any hypervisor by simply instrumenting all calls to vmentry vmentry and vmexit vmexit instructions which requires very little effort, thus allowing this model {{to be used with}} any hypervisor. Moreover, if the administrator chooses not to instrument these transitions, little information would be lost, as the only state lost in Figure 5 would be VMMVMM. Preemption and execution recovery would still be possible with little analysis precision lost (hypervisor involvement would account as effective CPU time instead of overhead due to virtualization). Furthermore, kernel traces generated from other operating systems can be used as well with minimal effort. As long as the events required to cover the FSM presented in section ‘Multi-level trace analysis’ are available, the model can be ported by simply specifying the names of these events. Moreover, in the case of <b>microcomputers</b> without <b>hardware</b> virtualization, the synchronization approach could potentially be extended to any other type of communication between the guest and the host, such as a TCP packet exchange. The rest of the analysis is based on the state system built, and thus does not depend on the details of the underlying traces.|$|R
