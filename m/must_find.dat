5|$|In 1991, a side-scrolling Fantasia {{video game}} {{developed}} by Infogrames was released for the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis system. The player controls Mickey Mouse, who <b>must</b> <b>find</b> missing musical notes scattered across four elemental worlds {{based upon the}} film's segments.|$|E
5|$|Another {{parasitic}} trematode {{example is}} seen in a terrestrial setting. Leucochloridium is a genus of flatworm (phylum Platyhelminthes) which matures in the intestine of songbirds. Their eggs pass out of the bird in the feces and are then taken in by Succinea, a terrestrial snail that lives in moist environments. The eggs develop into larvae inside this intermediate host, and then <b>must</b> <b>find</b> {{their way into the}} digestive system of a suitable bird. The problem here is that these birds do not eat snails, so the sporocyst <b>must</b> <b>find</b> some way of manipulating its future host into eating it. Unlike related species, these parasites are brightly colored and able to move in a pulsating manner. A sporocyst sac forces its way into the snail's eye stalks, and pulsates at high speed, enlarging the tentacle in the process. It also affects the host's behavior: the snail moves towards light, which it usually avoids. These combined factors make the sporocysts highly conspicuous, such that they are soon eaten by a hungry songbird. The snail then regenerates its tentacles, and Leucochloridium carries on with its life cycle.|$|E

Some gardens are now heritage landscapes that are subject to constant demand for new exhibits and exemplary environmental management.|$|E

Two-page book embedding has also been used to find simultaneous embeddings of graphs, in which two graphs are given on the same vertex set and one <b>must</b> <b>find</b> a placement for the vertices in which both graphs are drawn planarly with straight edges.|$|E

5|$|A {{mandatory}} order is {{an order of}} the High Court commanding a public authority to perform a public duty, while a prohibiting order operates to prevent illegal action by an authority from occurring in the first place. A quashing order, the most commonly sought prerogative order, {{has the effect of}} invalidating an ultra vires decision made by an authority. Obtaining a mandatory, prohibiting or quashing order is a two-stage process, as an applicant must be granted leave by the Court to apply for the order. The Court <b>must</b> <b>find</b> the existence of a proper public law issue and available grounds of review. Leave will be granted provided that an arguable and prima facie case of reasonable suspicion that the authority has acted in breach of administrative law rules is established.|$|E

They hibernate in caves as a community.|$|E
