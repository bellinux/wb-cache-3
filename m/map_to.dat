30|$|We first {{discuss the}} strong {{relationship}} between RDR and default theories. We also characterised default theories that can be <b>mapped</b> <b>to</b> RDR trees. We then discuss the relationship between default theories and NRDR. We discuss how the policies presented {{in the previous section}} translate to constraints on default theories that can be <b>mapped</b> <b>to</b> NRDR. We will show how default theories, that can be <b>mapped</b> <b>to</b> NRDR, are less constrained than theories which can be <b>mapped</b> <b>to</b> RDR. That is, the set of default theories that can be <b>mapped</b> <b>to</b> NRDR is larger than the set of those that can be <b>mapped</b> <b>to</b> RDR.|$|R
5000|$|The term [...] "normal {{cylindrical}} projection" [...] is used {{to refer}} to any projection in which meridians are <b>mapped</b> <b>to</b> equally spaced vertical lines and circles of latitude are <b>mapped</b> <b>to</b> horizontal lines (or, mutatis mutandis, more generally, radial lines from a fixed point are <b>mapped</b> <b>to</b> equally spaced parallel lines and concentric circles around it are <b>mapped</b> <b>to</b> perpendicular lines).|$|R
30|$|MPLS {{networks}} support Diffserv by mapping Diffserv BAs on to LSPs. MPLS can map Diffserv {{in several}} ways. Multiple BAs can be <b>mapped</b> <b>to</b> single LSP or single BA can be <b>mapped</b> <b>to</b> single LSP. When multiple BAs are <b>mapped</b> <b>to</b> single LSP, {{the method is}} called E-LSP (EXP is used to specify PHB) and L-LSP when single BA is <b>mapped</b> <b>to</b> single LSP [8].|$|R
5|$|In {{the second}} {{volume of the}} greatly {{expanded}} version of his book The Principal Navigations, Voiages, Traffiques and Discoueries of the English Nation (1599), Hakluyt published what is known today as the Wright–Molyneux Map.

5|$|The update rule is an {{injective}} function, that is, {{there are}} no two configurations that both <b>map</b> <b>to</b> the same common configuration. This condition is obviously implied by {{the assumption that the}} update rule is a bijection. In the other direction, the Garden of Eden theorem for cellular automata implies that every injective update rule is bijective.|$|E
5|$|Weather {{maps are}} created by {{plotting}} or tracing the values of relevant quantities such as sea level pressure, temperature, and cloud cover onto a geographical <b>map</b> <b>to</b> help find synoptic scale features such as weather fronts.|$|E
50|$|A VLAN {{can only}} be <b>mapped</b> <b>to</b> one MSTI or to the CIST. One VLAN <b>mapped</b> <b>to</b> {{multiple}} spanning trees is not allowed. All the VLANs are <b>mapped</b> <b>to</b> the CIST by default. Once a VLAN is <b>mapped</b> <b>to</b> a specified MSTI, it {{is removed from the}} CIST.To avoid unnecessary STP processing, a Port that is attached to a LAN with no other bridges/switches attached, can be configured as an edge port.|$|R

5|$|After {{defeating}} a rival railroad {{company and}} laying track {{to supply the}} US Cavalry near the Mexican border, Amelia meets a French prospector named Pierre Beaumont, who helps her and US Cavalry commander, Major Cooper, defeat a Mexican army attacking a fort. He then lures Amelia to a mine in Colorado where a surprise visit from an aged Kanyenke, who has brought Cooper and the cavalry with him, reveals Beaumont {{as the leader of}} Circle of Ossus. Amelia, Kanyenke, and Cooper chase Beaumont through the mines, where they find a <b>map</b> <b>to</b> the Lake of the Moon.|$|E
5|$|Ancient Trader is a turn-based {{strategy}} {{video game}} played from a two-dimensional perspective. The player controls a ship and seeks out three artifacts {{to defeat the}} game's final boss, a sea creature called the Ancient Guardian. The player explores the <b>map</b> <b>to</b> gather items, including tea, spices, and fruit, {{all of which can}} be found in wrecks. These can be exchanged for gold, which can be used to buy upgrades for the ship. The commodities are stored in the cargo hold, the capacity of which can be upgraded with gold.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the game, the entire map is obscured until explored by the player. The map consists of a landlocked sea with several islands, wreckage, sea creatures, enemy ships, ports, and whirlpools. The player can sometimes encounter message bottles that clear away fog of war on the <b>map</b> <b>to</b> reveal hidden ports.Sea creatures and enemy ships appear randomly and challenge the player for gold or commodities in a card minigame. Ports are trading and safe zones where the player can sell commodities, buy upgrades for the ship, and take on sidequests. Whirlpools teleport the player's ship to a random location on the map.|$|E
30|$|As we {{described}} in Section 4.2, the release schedule of GNOME guides {{the type and}} timing of coordination activities discussed in the main communication channel. Each of the resulting categories of communication can be <b>mapped</b> <b>to</b> the release team objectives. Thus, the first objective <b>maps</b> <b>to</b> Request for comments and Proposals and discussions; the second <b>maps</b> <b>to</b> Proposals and discussions, Schedule reminders, and Request for approval; and the third objective <b>maps</b> <b>to</b> Announcement, Schedule reminders, and Request for approval.|$|R
30|$|Tags were <b>mapped</b> <b>to</b> genome by SOAP or bowtie {{to analyze}} hircine gene {{expression}} and {{distribution in the}} two libraries. 11, 546, 193 (78.92  %) and 9, 624, 248 (80.11  %) clean reads in Fols and Luts were <b>mapped</b> <b>to</b> the hircine genome, respectively. sRNA was <b>mapped</b> <b>to</b> repeat with processes, screen and remove repeat associated tags. We found {{that the number of}} unique sRNA tags <b>mapped</b> <b>to</b> repeat associated sequence Ambi was the highest, and the number of total sRNA tags <b>mapped</b> <b>to</b> total associated repeats SINE/SS was the highest in Fols. The results of genome mapping and repeat reads in the Luts were similar to the Fols.|$|R
40|$|Earlier linkage {{analyses}} of nystatin resistance loci in Dictyostelium discoideum tentatively mapped the nysB and nysC loci to the previously unmarked linkage group V.

The third nystatin resistance locus, nysA, <b>maps</b> <b>to</b> linkage group II...|$|R
5|$|Even the maps, {{of which}} Tolkien {{originally}} proposed five, were considered and debated. He wished Thror's <b>map</b> <b>to</b> be tipped in (that is, glued {{in after the}} book has been bound) at first mention in the text, and with the moon-letters (almost identical to Anglo-Saxon runes) on the reverse {{so they could be}} seen when held up to the light. In the end the cost, as well as the shading of the maps, which would be difficult to reproduce, resulted in the final design of two maps as endpapers, Thror's map, and the Map of Wilderland, both printed in black and red on the paper's cream background.|$|E
5|$|In England, the {{scientist}} Francis Galton {{heard of this}} work, {{as well as the}} pioneering weather forecasts of Robert Fitzroy. After gathering information from weather stations across the country for the month of October 1861, he plotted the data on a map using his own system of symbols, thereby creating the world's first weather map. He used his <b>map</b> <b>to</b> prove that air circulated clockwise around areas of high pressure; he coined the term 'anticyclone' to describe the phenomenon. He was also instrumental in publishing the first weather map in a newspaper, for which he modified the pantograph (an instrument for copying drawings) to inscribe the map onto printing blocks. The Times began printing weather maps using these methods with data from the Meteorological Office.|$|E
5|$|In Yucatan, Morgan confronts Sahin and the Ottomans {{searching for}} the Lake and destroys the Ottoman base. However the Spanish conquistador, Francisco Juan Delgado de Leon, captures Sahin and some other Ottoman {{soldiers}} before Morgan can. Morgan is then forced to fight and defeat the Spanish, who are attacking Morgan's new allies, the Aztecs. After his battle to defend the Aztecs, Morgan realizes that Delgado and the Spanish were after the <b>map</b> <b>to</b> the Lake of the Moon disguised as the mosaic in the Aztecs' town square. The mosaic shows the Lake of the Moon being in Florida.|$|E
50|$|This form of {{triangular}} <b>mapping</b> recursively generalizes <b>to</b> vectors of finitely many natural numbers by repeatedly {{mapping the}} first two elements to a natural number. For example, (0,2,3) <b>maps</b> <b>to</b> (5,3), which <b>maps</b> <b>to</b> 39.|$|R
5000|$|The {{interface}} two {{came with}} two joystick ports that (unlike the Kempston which used the IN31 command) were <b>mapped</b> <b>to</b> actual key presses. Player 1 was <b>mapped</b> <b>to</b> - and player 2 was <b>mapped</b> <b>to</b> -. This initially seemed {{at odds with}} Sinclair's own keyboard layout, given that the keyboard itself had the cursor keys <b>mapped</b> <b>to</b> - with [...] typically being used by games as a fire button. Joystick interfaces that <b>mapped</b> <b>to</b> the cursor keys were available, but like the popular Kempston interface they were limited to supporting a single joystick only. It was the twin joystick feature of the ZX Interface 2 {{that turned out to}} be its major selling point.|$|R
50|$|In other words, a non-{{positive}} integer x≤0 is <b>mapped</b> <b>to</b> an even integer −2x, while {{a positive}} integer x>0 is <b>mapped</b> <b>to</b> an odd integer 2x−1.|$|R
5|$|In {{addition}} to the single-player missions, The World Is Not Enough features a multiplayer mode where up to four players can compete {{against each other in}} different game types, ranging from the traditional deathmatch to objective-based games such as capture the flag or king of the hill. Other game types include Last Agent Standing, where players begin the game with a finite number of lives and must survive until the opposing players exhaust their lives, and Uplink, in which players must find and touch uplink units scattered in key locations of the <b>map</b> <b>to</b> score points. Multiplayer games can be played on 14 different maps and can also include bots. Bots' appearance and amount of health can be changed to match player preference.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the single-player mode, Seeds of Evil features a multiplayer mode where various players can compete {{against each other in}} several game types. Options such as time limit, <b>map</b> <b>to</b> play on, and characters to play as can be changed to match player preference. Every character has their own strengths and weaknesses, with some being able to regenerate health. For example, the Raptor is limited to close-range attacks, but is also extremely fast and agile. Multiplayer games in the Nintendo 64 version of the game support up to four players via split screen. In contrast, multiplayer games in the Microsoft Windows version support up to 16 players via LAN or internet.|$|E
5|$|Rain World {{setting is}} {{destroyed}} by ecological catastrophe and illustrated in pixel art. Its story is communicated through {{details in the}} environment, images during hibernation, and holograms from a worm that monitors the Slugcat. The game offers little to guide the player, apart from the worm, who gives some hints about where to go and what to collect towards {{the beginning of the}} game. The player can view a <b>map</b> <b>to</b> check their progress through the large in-game world, and this can help to reach the game's multiple endings.|$|E

The transforming gene of the T 24 bladder carcinoma cell line <b>maps</b> <b>to</b> human chromosome 11. An oncogene isolated from the lung carcinoma cell line SK-Calu- 1 <b>maps</b> <b>to</b> human chromosome 12.

25|$|Note {{that the}} set D may be empty. This {{would mean that}} every natural number x <b>maps</b> <b>to</b> a set of natural numbers that {{contains}} x. Then, every number <b>maps</b> <b>to</b> a nonempty set and no number <b>maps</b> <b>to</b> the empty set. But the empty set {{is a member of}} 𝒫(ℕ), so the mapping still does not cover 𝒫(ℕ).|$|R
30|$|For instance, A {{elements}} in the customized model are <b>mapped</b> <b>to</b> B {{elements in}} Cloud resource runtime model. Thus, operations to add, remove and list A elements are <b>mapped</b> <b>to</b> the same operations on related B elements.
