Some HTTP response codes (e.g. 401, Unauthorized) have clear meanings {{in the context of an}} HTTP conversation but do not apply to the process of HTTP redirection. Three additional types of PURLs ("chain", [...] "partial' and [...] "clone") are given <b>mnemonic</b> <b>names</b> related to their functions.|$|R
50|$|The ISA of a {{computer}} is usually described in a small instruction manual, which describes how the instructions are encoded. Also, it may define short (vaguely) <b>mnemonic</b> <b>names</b> for the instructions. The names can be recognized by a software development tool called an assembler. An assembler is {{a computer}} program that translates a human-readable form of the ISA into a computer-readable form. Disassemblers are also widely available, usually in debuggers and software programs to isolate and correct malfunctions in binary computer programs.|$|R
40|$|Experience in {{maintaining}} up-to-date documentation for one module of the large-scale Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System 2 (MEDLARS 2) is described. Several innovative techniques were explored {{in the development}} of this system's data management environment, particularly those that use PL/I as an automatic documenter. The PL/I data description section can provide automatic documentation by means of a master description of data elements that has long and highly meaningful <b>mnemonic</b> <b>names</b> and a formalized technique for the production of descriptive commentary. The techniques discussed are practical methods that employ the computer during system development in a manner that assists system implementation, provides interim documentation for customer review, and satisfies some of the deliverable documentation requirements...|$|R
5000|$|All {{load and}} store {{instructions}} {{use the same}} <b>mnemonic</b> <b>name,</b> LD, for LOAD (a return to the simplistic Datapoint 2200 vocabulary); other common instructions, such as ADD and INC, use the same mnemonic regardless of addressing mode or operand size. This is possible because the operands themselves carry enough information.|$|E

40|$|Design of low-cost, microcomputer-based {{navigation}} receivers, and the assembler are described. The {{development of}} computer software for microprocessors is materially {{aided by the}} assembler program using <b>mnemonic</b> variable <b>names.</b> The flexibility of the environment provided by the IBM's Virtual Machine Facility and the Conversational Monitor System, make possible the convenient assembler access. The implementation of the assembler for the microprocessor chip serves {{a part of the}} present need and forms a model for support of other microprocessors...|$|R
5000|$|... "Antonina" [...] and [...] "Alexander" [...] may be <b>mnemonic</b> device <b>names</b> {{that made}} oral {{repetition}} of the tale easier, {{and so it is}} possible, if not likely, that they are invented names. Whether Theodora and Didymus were the originals or not, it is possible that these legends are shadows of an actual martyrdom that had been lost to the story tellers. The feast day of Antonina and Alexander in the Roman Catholic Church is May 3.|$|R
5000|$|This is a {{medium-sized}} warbler. The adult has a streaked brown back, whitish grey underparts, unstreaked {{except on the}} undertail. The sexes are identical, as with most warblers, but young birds are yellower below. Like most warblers, it is insectivorous. It {{is very similar to}} the common grasshopper warbler, but is slightly larger, has white tips to the tail and tertial feathers, and a warmer brown rump. The white tips are the reason for its colloquial, <b>mnemonic</b> <b>name</b> of [...] "PG Tips".|$|E
50|$|Undoubtedly, he {{had some}} high {{political}} talents. He had a gift for mordant, wounding, sometimes very funny phrases. And, having thought up the most outrageous attack he {{had the nerve to}} deliver it, without fear of offending taste or friends or damaging his own repute....He was strong on insolence. He also had other attributes necessary to make his words resound, and his fame increase: a <b>mnemonic</b> <b>name,</b> an idiosyncratic appearance, and good delivery, whether on the platform or in the House of Commons. In addition he had sporadic charm, although intermingled with offensive and often pointless rudeness.|$|E
50|$|Common Language Information Services {{encompasses}} several {{products that}} are in general use by the global telecommunications industry through license agreements.

50|$|Also all {{competitors}} of {{the annual}} World Memory Championships <b>name</b> <b>mnemonic</b> strategies the source for their performances (including performances like memorizing a list of more than 2000 digits in an hour, 280 words in 15 minutes or {{the order of a}} deck of cards in under 25 seconds).|$|R

5000|$|Competitors {{describe}} numerous {{methods and}} techniques for improving their memorization skills, with some having published and named their specific methods. These include, for instance, the <b>Mnemonic</b> dominic system, <b>named</b> after former World Champion Dominic O'Brien, the Mnemonic major system, {{as well as}} the Person-Action-Object System which involves encoding cards and numbers into sequences of persons, actions, and objects. These methods are sometimes referred to as [...] "mnemotechnics".|$|R
