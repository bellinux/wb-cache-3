5|$|The spotted {{green pigeon}} {{is most likely}} extinct, and <b>may</b> <b>already</b> have been close to {{extinction}} by the time Europeans arrived in its native area. The species may have disappeared due to being over-hunted and being preyed upon by introduced animals. Hume suggested that the bird may have survived until the 1820s.|$|E

As a matter of practice, the defendant <b>may</b> <b>already</b> have been prosecuted for the initial offence (for example, another offence against the person). Accordingly, the Attorney General's consent is required if {{more than three years}} has elapsed, or where the defendant has already been prosecuted in the circumstances alleged to have resulted in the victim's death.|$|E
5|$|There is some {{dispute about}} whether this new {{military}} structure was put into place under the Emperor Diocletian or Constantine since both reorganised the Roman Army in the late 3rd and early 4th centuries to some degree. Both Diocletian and even his predecessor of thirty years Gallienus <b>may</b> <b>already</b> have controlled mobile strategic reserves to assist the empire's border forces; either Diocletian or Constantine expanded this nascent force into permanent field armies.|$|E

5|$|He <b>may</b> <b>already</b> {{have been}} a Doctor of Civil Law by that point, because in the {{following}} year, on 22 November 1350, he is found as such acting as the Regent of Orléans presenting a candidate for licence. Having studied civil law for the highest qualification available, de Coventre moved on to canon law. By 28 March 1351, he possessed a Bachelorate in Decrees (canon law). This was perhaps why on 16 April 1353, he obtained from Pope Innocent VI another grace for himself. Precisely when he obtained his doctorate is unclear, but he was D. U. J. (doctor utriusque juris), Doctor of Both Laws, by 4 September 1359.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the dodo <b>may</b> <b>already</b> have been rare or localised before the arrival of humans on Mauritius, since it would have been unlikely to become extinct so rapidly if it had occupied all the remote areas of the island. A 2005 expedition found subfossil remains of dodos and other animals killed by a flash flood. Such mass mortalities would have further jeopardised a species already in danger of becoming extinct. Yet the fact that the dodo survived hundreds of years of volcanic activity and climactic changes shows the bird was resilient within its ecosystem.|$|E
5|$|The helmet {{appears to}} have been {{deliberately}} folded up and deposited in an artificial stone structure. It is thought to have been used for ceremonial occasions rather than for combat, and <b>may</b> <b>already</b> have been an antique {{by the time it was}} buried. It is of the same type as the Newstead Helmet (found in 1905) and its design also has similarities with the Ribchester Helmet (found in 1796) and the Hallaton Helmet (found in 2000), though its facial features are more akin to those of helmets found in southern Europe. Its design may allude to the Trojans, whose exploits the Romans re-enacted in cavalry tournaments.|$|E

5|$|The higher-level {{phylogeny}} of the arthropods {{continues to}} be a matter of debate and research. In 2008, researchers at Tufts University uncovered what they believe is the world's oldest known full-body impression of a primitive flying insect, a 300-million-year-old specimen from the Carboniferous period. The oldest definitive insect fossil is the Devonian Rhyniognatha hirsti, from the 396-million-year-old Rhynie chert. It may have superficially resembled a modern-day silverfish insect. This species already possessed dicondylic mandibles (two articulations in the mandible), a feature associated with winged insects, suggesting that wings <b>may</b> <b>already</b> have evolved at this time. Thus, the first insects probably appeared earlier, in the Silurian period.|$|E
5|$|The {{roots of}} Tephrosia apollinea are deep, {{penetrating}} soils {{to a depth}} of 3 metres or more, aiding the absorption of moisture from the soil. Moisture is stored in the cortex of the roots, which is protected by a thin periderm. Water storage in the cortex enables growth and reproduction during times of drought, which allow it to thrive in both arid and semi-arid conditions and to survive during winter and summer months at times of low rainfall. The roots grow at a faster rate than the shoots themselves, and even at the early stage of the plant displaying a shoot the length of a cm, the roots <b>may</b> <b>already</b> be 30cm or more in length.|$|E
5|$|The {{scientific}} and technological impact of extraterrestrial contact through electromagnetic waves would probably be quite small, especially at first. However, if the message contains {{a large amount of}} information, deciphering it could give humans access to a galactic heritage perhaps predating the human species itself, which may greatly advance our technology and science. A possible negative effect could be to demoralize research scientists as they come to know that what they are researching <b>may</b> <b>already</b> be known to another civilization.|$|E

Wells tells Doggett and Scully that he is moving {{backwards}} in time and cannot recall the past few days. Doggett is skeptical, but Scully hears him out. Wells says {{there must be a}} reason for it and Scully suggests that the answer <b>may</b> <b>already</b> be within him. Studying the evidence of the case, Wells has a flash of the murder that reveals the knife in a hand with a spider web tattoo.|$|E
5|$|Youth {{spend too}} much time {{learning}} what their teachers think is important, irrelevant from what the youth <b>may</b> <b>already</b> know. The manager of learning value allows the youth to learn and practice his skills in situations simulating real life. The Manager of Learning methodology first exposes the learner to a situation to help both the learner and the leader assess his current state of knowledge. This causes the learner to internalize a need to improve his knowledge or skills. This is followed by a period of teaching or exposure during which the participant improves from their base-line knowledge. The participant then gets a chance to apply what he has learned, and lastly, evaluates his performance improvement.|$|E
5|$|A {{wind energy}} {{penetration}} figure {{can be specified}} for different duration of time, but is often quoted annually. To obtain 100% from wind annually requires substantial long term storage or substantial interconnection to other systems which <b>may</b> <b>already</b> have substantial storage. On a monthly, weekly, daily, or hourly basis—or less—wind might supply as much as or more than 100% of current use, with the rest stored or exported. Seasonal industry might then take advantage of high wind and low usage times such as at night when wind output can exceed normal demand. Such industry might include production of silicon, aluminum, steel, or of natural gas, and hydrogen, and using future long term storage to facilitate 100% energy from variable renewable energy. Homes can also be programmed to accept extra electric power on demand, for example by remotely turning up water heater thermostats.|$|E

5|$|As {{part of this}} development, {{the family}} created a large, new deer park around the castle, {{replacing}} the older, unenclosed hunting grounds. Deer parks were an important status symbol in this period, and many nobles who acquired power and wealth {{for the first time}} chose to undertake similar projects. Creating the park, which spread out from the south of the castle to cover , required clearing away the older settlements around the castle and abandoning various fields and pastures. These settlements, comprising long houses built in warmer climate of the 12th and early 13th century, <b>may</b> <b>already</b> have become less sustainable due to the onset of the cooler climate that began to emerge {{at the end of the}} 13th. Land near the castle, later called Kennel Field, was used to hold required the packs of dogs for hunting.|$|E
5|$|At {{some point}} during his reign, Sigeberht abdicated his power to Ecgric and retired to lead a {{religious}} life within a monastery he had built for his own use. Bede does not name the location of Sigeberht's monastery, but later sources name it as Beodricesworth, afterwards called Bury St Edmunds. If that identification is accepted, the likely site was in the original precinct of the mediaeval abbey at Bury St Edmunds, probably the 'worth' or curtilage of Beodric after whom the place was originally named. The site occupied a strong position on {{the upper reaches of}} the Lark valley, which drains north-west into the Great Fen through important early settlements at Icklingham, Culford, West Stow and others. This was a line of access towards Ely, where a foundation of Saint Augustine <b>may</b> <b>already</b> have existed, and towards Soham, where Saint Felix is thought to have founded a monastery.|$|E
5|$|Lord Wilberforce, in Quistclose, {{stated that}} the {{contract}} gives the moneylender an equitable interest in the loan. Under Wilberforce's two-stage trust, the interest in the money first goes from the lender to the borrower (the primary trust) and then, when the trust's purpose fails, reverses (the secondary trust). In Twinsectra Lord Millett also explained that a Quistclose trust is a resulting trust, but held that the lender retains the interest throughout the transaction, with no need for this interest to reverse if {{the purpose of the}} loan fails. The problem with Wilberforce's analysis, as explained by Alastair Hudson, Professor of Equity and Finance Law at the University of Exeter, is that because the resulting trust only comes into existence after the misuse of the loan, it may come too late; if the money is not available when the claim is brought, there is no remedy. The borrower <b>may</b> <b>already</b> have spent the money, or already be insolvent and the subject of claims by creditors.|$|E

5|$|Members of {{the species}} once {{inhabited}} rainforests, swamps, and cloud forests in India, Bhutan, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Laos, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and China. In historical times, they lived in southwest China, particularly in Sichuan. They are now critically endangered, with only five substantial populations in the wild: four on Sumatra and one on Borneo. Their numbers are difficult to determine because they are solitary animals that are widely scattered across their range, but they are estimated to number fewer than 100. Survival of the Peninsular Malaysia population is in doubt, {{and one of the}} Sumatran populations <b>may</b> <b>already</b> be extinct. In 2015, researchers announced that the Bornean rhinoceros had become extinct from the northern part of Borneo (Sabah, Malaysia); however, a tiny population was discovered in East Kalimantan in early 2016.|$|E
5|$|Baibars {{ventured into}} the area around Krak des Chevaliers in 1270 and allowed his men to graze their animals on the fields around the castle. When he {{received}} news that year of the Eighth Crusade led by King Louis IX of France, Baibars left for Cairo to avoid a confrontation. After Louis died in 1271 Baibars returned to deal with Krak des Chevaliers. Before he marched on the castle the Sultan captured the smaller castles in the area, including Chastel Blanc. On 3March, Baibars' army arrived at Krak des Chevaliers. By the time the Sultan appeared on the scene, the castle <b>may</b> <b>already</b> have been blockaded by Mamluk forces for several days. Of the three Arabic accounts of the siege only one was contemporary, that of Ibn Shaddad, although he was not present at the siege. Peasants {{who lived in the}} area had fled to the castle for safety and were kept in the outer ward. As soon as Baibars arrived he erected mangonels, powerful siege weapons which he would later turn on the castle. In a probable reference to a walled suburb outside the castle's entrance, Ibn Shaddad records that two days later the first line of defences fell to the besiegers.|$|E
5|$|The River Parrett, the Bristol Channel and the Severn Estuary are {{believed}} to have been used for riverine bulk transportation of people and supplies in Somerset under Roman and later Anglo-Saxon and Norman occupation. Roman Somerset, which lasted for over 250years until around the beginning of the 5th century, had various settlements, including Bath (Aquae Sulis), Ilchester (Lindinis) and lead mines at Charterhouse; and four roads surrounding the Somerset Levels. There is evidence of two Roman ports on the Parrett. The port at Combwich, on the west bank, was ill-recorded before its destruction by quarrying and erosion. The other at Crandon Bridge on the east bank near where the current King's Sedgemoor Drain enters the Parrett, was in use between the first and the fourth centuries. Evidence of an extensive site with storehouses was found in the mid-1970s, during motorway construction works. The Crandon Bridge site may have been linked by a probable Roman road over the Polden Hills to the Fosse Way, at Ilchester. Ilchester, the largest Roman town in Somerset, was a port with large granaries, sited where the Fosse Way crossed the Ilchester Yeo by means of a paved ford. The Yeo was navigable by small craft {{all the way to the}} Parrett allowing military supplies to be brought by boat directly to Ilchester; however, disembarkation at Crandon Bridge and use of the Polden Hills roadway allowed more rapid movement to Ilchester. The Yeo <b>may</b> <b>already</b> have been straightened and canalised before Roman occupation.|$|E
