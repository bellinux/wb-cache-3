The study is restricted to simple one- and two-degree-of-freedom systems with a unilateral constraint {{on one of the}} degrees of freedom, for which the response can be analytically determined.

The results obtained for various sets of parameters point out some limitations to the validity of a general modal superposition formula...|$|R

In the paper, {{the crack}} {{parallel}} to and {{lying on the}} interface in the hard cladding material structure {{is regarded as the}} research object, theoretical model of the stress intensity factor (SIF) of the interface crack under the <b>mechanical</b> <b>impact</b> load is built. Based on it, the SIF of the crack parallel to and lying on the interface in the cermet cladding material structure under the <b>mechanical</b> <b>impact</b> load is investigated by using finite element analysis method. The influences of the cladding thickness ratio and <b>mechanical</b> <b>impact</b> stress amplitude on the interface SIF are investigated. The research results show that, at a certain moment, the interface SIFs decrease with increasing cladding thickness ratio when the <b>mechanical</b> <b>impact</b> stress amplitude is a constant and increase as the <b>mechanical</b> <b>impact</b> stress amplitude increases when the cladding thickness ratio is a constant...|$|R

40|$|We {{study the}} problem of what causes prices to change. It {{is well known that}} trading impacts prices — orders to buy drive the price up, and orders to sell drive it down. We {{introduce}} a means of decomposing the total impact of trading into two components, defining the <b>mechanical</b> <b>impact</b> of a trading order as the change in future prices {{in the absence of any}} future changes in decision making, and the informational impact as the remainder of the total <b>impact</b> once <b>mechanical</b> <b>impact</b> is removed. This decomposition is performed using order book data from the London Stock Exchange. The average <b>mechanical</b> <b>impact</b> of a market order decays to zero as a function of time, at an asymptotic rate that is consistent with a power law with an exponent of roughly 1. 7. In contrast the average informational impact builds to approach a constant value. Initially the <b>impact</b> is entirely <b>mechanical,</b> and is about half as big as the asymptotic informational impact. The size of the informational impact is positively correlated to <b>mechanical</b> <b>impact.</b> For cases where the <b>mechanical</b> <b>impact</b> is zero for all times, we find that the informational impact is negative, i. e. buy market orders that have no <b>mechanical</b> <b>impact</b> at all generate strong negative price responses.

40|$|Metal-based {{reactive}} composites are a {{class of}} materials that consist {{of at least one}} metals, such as Ni/Al, that have high-energy densities and can produce significant energy output during exothermic reaction after thermal or mechanical initiation. However, conventionally these materials typically have slow reaction rates and are difficult to ignite at typical micron particle size ranges limiting their application. Therefore, mechanical activation techniques have been used to create materials with high surface areas and smaller characteristic dimensions in order to increase combustion velocity and ignition sensitivity. Their combustion and <b>mechanical</b> <b>impact</b> behavior is being studied to develop the understanding needed so that the materials can be ultimately developed for applications such as multi-functional energetic materials, blast enhancement and synthesis of novel metastable non-equilibrium materials. ^ In this work Ni and Al powder is mixed by High-Energy Ball Milling (HEBM) to produce a mechanically activated (MA) Ni/Al reactive composite. A two-step process is adopted that includes dry milling followed by wet milling using hexanes as a process control agent. The microstructure of the resulting powder contains layered Ni and Al laminates that have micron to nano-scale dimensions depending upon the dry milling time and particle size of the material. The <b>mechanical</b> <b>impact</b> response and combustion behavior of these materials was studied through a series of experiments. ^ <b>Mechanical</b> <b>impact</b> experiments were performed using a modified Asay shear experiment where properties such as <b>mechanical</b> <b>impact</b> ignition threshold, ignition delay time, and combustion velocity were identified. It was found that the <b>mechanical</b> <b>impact</b> ignition threshold decreases as the dry milling time increases. The material with the longest dry milling time considered (97...|$|R

When the P-wave propagates in the beam along the spherical wavefronts, it will be reflected by the boundary of the crack and then be propagated as diffracted wave. The TOF technology, which is based on detecting the arrival time of the P-wave, can be used to estimate the crack depth.|$|R

40|$|Reaction wood formation, in {{particular}} compression wood in conifers, {{has often been}} used to date geomorphic events such as debris flows or snow avalanches. However, very little is known yet about the variations of tension wood formation and particularly cross-sectional vessel characteristics in response to different <b>mechanical</b> <b>impacts.</b> To test whether different intensities and characteristic forms of tension wood formation induce the formation of vessels with changing sizes, growth experiments with different treatments were conducted with alder and beech followed by wood anatomical analysis of the vessels. The experiments comprised bending treatments of varying severities in combination with cambium wounding and other alterations. The treatments were successful in inducing different intensities in tension wood expressed by variations of vessel lumen area (VLA). An increasing bending stress resulted {{in the formation of}} lower VLA values. When the apex or the root system was damaged or the apex remained vertical, VLA values decreased less and the tension wood formation was regarded as less intense. Our research shows that VLA is affected by <b>mechanical</b> <b>impacts</b> and that the application of wood anatomical techniques can potentially provide supplementary information about type and intensities of past <b>mechanical</b> <b>impacts</b> in angiosperm tree growth...|$|R
