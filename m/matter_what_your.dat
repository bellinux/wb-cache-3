Perhaps the most media {{coverage}} was given to a particular exchange between Anakin and Obi-Wan, which led to the aforementioned controversy: [...] "If you're not with me, then you're my enemy", Anakin declares. Despite Lucas' insistence to the contrary, The Seattle Times concluded, [...] "Without naming Bush or the Patriot Act, it's all unmistakable no <b>matter</b> <b>what</b> <b>your</b> own politics may be." ...|$|E
500|$|Hill {{experienced}} discrimination {{throughout her}} climbing career {{and in an}} interview with John Stieger in Climbing, she pointed out that despite her success and prowess at climbing, this was a problem for her. She pointed to sexist remarks from male climbers who believed particular routes were impossible for female climbers and the fact that [...] "there's a lot less importance and prestige placed on women in climbing, no <b>matter</b> <b>what</b> <b>your</b> ability is". Hill has also commented extensively about how American culture encourages women to be passive and to forego developing muscles, which makes it harder for them to excel at climbing. She lamented this trend and was happy that her family and friends had allowed her to be the [...] "tomboy" [...] she wanted to be. Hill has explained that when competing she is not competing against men or women but with people's expectations of what women can do.|$|E
500|$|Following Terry-Thomas's death, Lionel Jeffries {{called him}} [...] "the {{last of the}} great gentlemen of the cinema", while the {{director}} Michael Winner commented that [...] "no <b>matter</b> <b>what</b> <b>your</b> position was in relation to his, as the star he was always terribly nice. He was the kindest man and he enjoyed life so much". Reviewing his career in The Guardian, Adrian Turner considered that [...] "we took him for granted and he was ideal for his time. Not to put too serious a point on it, his portrayal of crass stupidity and blatant deviousness struck a chord with British audiences during the fifties as they experienced the clumsy dismemberment of the Empire and the 'never had it so good' ethos of the Macmillan era. During the sixties he became a glorious anachronism, much in demand in America, who saw in him the irrelevant pageantry of Britain"; {{he also said that}} Terry-Thomas was [...] "a national treasure". Gilbert Adair, writing in The Independent, considered that [...] "for three decades, and in literally scores of films, he personified the Englishman as amiable bounder"; Adair wrote that [...] "the characterisation he was to assume represented the very essence of patrician, double-barrelled caddishness". Terry-Thomas's friend Jack Lemmon called him [...] "a consummate professional... he was a gentleman, a delight to be with personally, let alone professionally, and above all as an actor he had one of the qualities that I admire so much—he made it look simple".|$|E

2500|$|I {{have taken}} up unconstitutional action at this time because of the {{abnormal}} circumstances and because precedent has been given by the British government. I am a socialist, and have been fighting and will fight for an absolute reconstruction of society {{for the benefit of}} all. I am proud of my conduct. I have squared my conduct with my intellect, and if everyone had done so this war would not have taken place. I act square and clean for my principles. .... No <b>matter</b> <b>what</b> <b>your</b> accusations against me may be, no matter what reservations you keep at the back of your head, my appeal is to the working class. I appeal exclusively to them because they and they only can bring about the time when the whole world will be in one brotherhood, on a sound economic foundation. That, and that alone, can be the means of bringing about a re-organisation of society. That can only be obtained when the people of the world get the world, and retain the world.|$|E
2500|$|In June 2002, it was {{reported}} that Lucy Benjamin had quit her role of Lisa. She commented, [...] "I’ve had a wonderful five years and I’m terribly excited by the [...] storyline.” EastEnders executive producer Louise Berridge added, “This {{is going to be a}} very demanding story to play but I know Lucy will do a fabulous job. She’s an actress with a terrific future.” Despite initial claims that the actress had decided to leave, she later admitted that the producers had axed the character. Discussing Lisa's exit, Lucy Benjamin's boyfriend of the time, actor Steve McFadden who plays Phil Mitchell, said, [...] "Lucy didn’t feel comfortable with lying. There’s a stigma attached to being given the boot but she felt stupid pretending she’d decided to pack in a great job. It was hard for her and she was very upset but she’s come through it. I felt for her but soaps are led by storylines and Lucy was told that the writers had come up with a brilliant plot that was too good to say no to.I guess Lucy’s character was so central to the plot that eventually it blew up in her face. I’m proud of the fact that she was good enough to come to the forefront of the show. Lucy did so well to make her mark on EastEnders in the first place because Lisa arrived on the Square on her own. She wasn’t part of a family, which means she was more vulnerable to the chop. She was only on a three-month contract but she made it a success and ended up being part of the cast for four years. If you are part of a screen family on EastEnders you are practically bomb-proof, no <b>matter</b> <b>what</b> <b>your</b> ability is as an actor." ...|$|E

60|$|Where he {{gets his}} English is his own secret. There is nothing like it {{elsewhere}} in the earth; or even in paradise, perhaps, but the other place is probably full of it. You hire {{him as soon as}} you touch Indian soil; for no <b>matter</b> <b>what</b> <b>your</b> sex is, you cannot do without him. He is messenger, valet, chambermaid, table-waiter, lady's maid, courier--he is everything. He carries a coarse linen clothes-bag and a quilt; he sleeps on the stone floor outside your chamber door, and gets his meals you do not know where nor when; you only know that he is not fed on the premises, either when you are in a hotel or when you are a guest in a private house. His wages are large--from an Indian point of view--and he feeds and clothes himself out of them. We had three of him in two and a half months. The first one's rate was thirty rupees a month that is to say, twenty-seven cents a day; the rate of the others, Rs. 40 (40 rupees) a month. A princely sum; for the native switchman on a railway and the native servant in a private family get only Rs. 7 per month, and the farm-hand only 4. The two former feed and clothe themselves and their families on their $1.90 per month; but I cannot believe that the farmhand has to feed himself on his $1.08. I think the farm probably feeds him, and that the whole of his wages, except a trifle for the priest, go to the support of his family. That is, to the feeding of his family; for they live in a mud hut, hand-made, and, doubtless, rent-free, and they wear no clothes; at least, nothing more than a rag. And not much of a rag at that, {{in the case of the}} males. However, these are handsome times for the farm-hand; he was not always the child of luxury that he is now. The Chief Commissioner of the Central Provinces, in a recent official utterance wherein he was rebuking a native deputation for complaining of hard times, reminded them that they could easily remember when a farm-hand's wages were only half a rupee (former value) a month--that is to say, less than a cent a day; nearly $2.90 a year. If such a wage-earner had a good deal of a family--and they all have that, for God is very good to these poor natives in some ways--he would save a profit of fifteen cents, clean and clear, out of his year's toil; I mean a frugal, thrifty person would, not one given to display and ostentation. And if he owed $13.50 and took good care of his health, he could pay it off in ninety years. Then he could hold up his head, and look his creditors in the face again.|$|E
