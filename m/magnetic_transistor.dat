40|$|In {{order to}} {{investigate}} the viability of spin injection from ferromagnetic contacts into semiconductors, magnetoresistance measurements have been performed on four distinct classes of spin injection devices; two sets of lateral cobalt/silicon/cobalt structures (coded Cornell 96 and Cornell 97 samples) in which different shape anisotropies cobalt pads were grown on silicon substrates, a set of vertical devices consisting of 1 #mu#m-thick silicon membrane sandwiched by two nickel films {{and a set of}} granular cobalt/silicon mechanical milling alloy structures. Negative magnetoresistance due to spin injection into silicon has been observed in the lateral Cornell 97 samples at room temperature. The devices also exhibit the spin dependent chemical potential effect at Schottky barriers and the ferromagnetic fringing field Hall effect. While they are also interesting in their own right from both the physics and applications points of view, these effects may obscure spin dependent transport. Furthermore, the observed spin injection effect is modest (0. 1 - 0. 3 % of magnetoresistance in 16 kOe). As a result, the spin diffusion length cannot be accurately evaluated but can only be estimated to be of order tens of micrometres at the least in n-doped (10 " 1 " 8 cm"-" 3) silicon. The magnetoresistance characteristic can be modified by the ion milling process. The milled Cornell 97 samples show large magnetoresistance (more than 10 %) in 4 - 25 K regime. This may be explained by the introduction of localised states, however this large magnetoresistance whose characteristic is highly temperature-sensitive is not entirely understood. Lorentz magnetoresistance in silicon is a dominant effect in the vertical structures. The giant magnetoresistance has been observed in the cobalt/silicon alloy which can be modelled as the magnetic cobalt granules embedded in non-magnetic cobalt silicide matrix. In addition to these two terminal devices, a novel <b>magnetic</b> <b>transistor</b> comprising a silicon base has been studied. This three terminal device affords the current gain which is not only high (up to 1000) but also magnetically tuneable (up to 0. 78 % change of gain in 16 kOe field).

40|$|In {{this thesis}} I {{investigate}} {{several aspects of}} local quantum criticality, a concept of key importance {{in a number of}} physical contexts ranging from critical heavy fermion compounds to quantum dot systems. Quantum critical points are associated with second order phase transitions at zero temperature. In contrast to their finite-temperature counterparts, the zero-point motion cannot be neglected near a quantum critical point. As a result, the incorporation of quantum dynamics leads to an effective dimension larger than the spatial dimension of the system for the order parameter fluctuations within the Ginzburg-Landau-Wilson treatment of criticality. This so-called quantum-to-classical mapping works well for the critical properties in insulating systems but apparently fails in systems containing gapless fermions. This has been experimentally most clearly been demonstrated within a particular class of intermetallic compounds called heavy fermions. A particular way in which the Ginzburg-Landau-Wilson paradigm fails is for critical Kondo destruction that seems to underlie the unconventional quantum criticality seen in the heavy fermions. I focus on studying the properties of critical Kondo destruction and the emergence of energy-over-temperature-scaling in systems without spatial degrees of freedom, i. e., so-called quantum impurity systems. In particular, I employ large-N techniques to address critical properties of this class of quantum phase transitions in and out of equilibrium. As quantum critical systems are characterized by a scale-invariant spectrum with many low-lying excitations, it may appear that any perturbation can lead to a response beyond the linear response regime. Understanding what governs the non-linear response regime near quantum criticality is an interesting area. Here, I first present a path integral version of the Schrieffer-Wolff transformation which relates the functional integral form of the partition function of the Anderson model to that of its effective low-energy model. The equivalence between the low-energy sector of the Anderson model in the Kondo regime and the spin-isotropic Kondo model is usually established via a canonical transformation performed on the Hamiltonian, followed by a projection. The resulting functional integral assumes the form of a spin path integral and includes a geometric phase factor, i. e. a Berry phase. The approach stresses the underlying symmetries of the model and allows for a straightforward generalization of the transformation to more involved models. As an example of the efficiency of the approach I apply it to a single electron transistor attached to ferromagnetic leads and derive the effective low-energy model of such a <b>magnetic</b> <b>transistor.</b> As Kondo screening is a local phenomenon, it and its criticality can be studied using the appropriate impurity model. A general impurity model to study critical Kondo destruction is the pseudogap Bose-Fermi Kondo model. Here, I concentrate on the multi-channel version of the model using the dynamical large-N study. This model allows to study the non-trivial interplay between two different mechanisms of critical Kondo destruction. The interplay of two processes that can each by itself lead to critical Kondo destruction. The zero-temperature residual entropy at various fixed points for the model is also discussed. The two channel Anderson model exhibits several continuous quantum phase transitions between weak- and strong-coupling phases. The non-crossing approximation (NCA) is believed to give reliable results for the standard two-channel Anderson model of a magnetic impurity in a metal. I revisit the reliability of the NCA for the standard two channel Anderson model (constant conduction electron density of states) and investigate its reliability for the two-channel pseudogap Anderson model. This is done by comparing finite-temperature, finite-frequency solutions of the NCA equations and asymptotically exact zero-temperature NCA solutions with numerical renormalization-group calculations. The phase diagram of this model is well established. The focus here will be on the dynamical scaling properties obtained within the NCA. Finally, I study the thermal and non-thermal steady state scaling functions and the steady-state dynamics of the pseudogap Kondo model. This model allows us to study the concept of effective temperatures near fully interacting as well as weak-coupling fixed points and compare the out-of-equilibrium scaling properties of critical Kondo destruction to those of the traditional spin-density wave (SDW) scenario. The differences I identify can be experimentally probed. This may be helpful in identifying the nature of the quantum critical points observed in certain heavy fermion compounds...|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} {{reports on the}} {{development}} of permalloy thin films obtained by electrodeposition onto low-doped n-type silicon substrates.
