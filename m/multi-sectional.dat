5|$|In France, organ music {{developed}} during the Baroque era through the music of Jean Titelouze, François Couperin, and Nicolas de Grigny. Because the French organ of the 17th and early 18th centuries was very standardized, a conventional set of registrations developed for its repertoire. The music of French composers (and Italian composers such as Girolamo Frescobaldi) was written for use during the Mass. Very little secular organ music was composed in France and Italy during the Baroque period; the written repertoire is almost exclusively intended for liturgical use. In England, composers such as John Blow and John Stanley wrote <b>multi-sectional</b> free works for liturgical use called voluntaries through the 19th century.|$|E
5|$|Starting {{with the}} album Blood Fire Death, {{one of the}} first {{definitive}} Viking metal releases, Bathory incorporated a diverse range of musical elements. While retaining the noise and chaos of previous recordings, the band took a more sorrowful and melodic approach, working in ballads based on Germanic and Norse folklore, shanty-like melodies and folk music elements such as bourdon sounds, Jew's harps, and fifes. Bathory added natural found sounds, such as ocean waves, thunder, and wild animal noises, in a style similar to that of musique concrète. Instruments were sometimes used to create onomatopoeic effects such as drum sounds imitating thunder or a sledgehammer. The songs typically featured <b>multi-sectional</b> formal structures, following a pattern of three instrumental sections– introduction, bridge, and finale– and two vocal sections– stanza and refrain.|$|E
5|$|The {{composition}} representing Vršac at the Exhibition {{was originally}} meant to depict folk hero Janko Halabura fighting the Turks, {{an idea to}} which Jovanović took a liking. The Vršac council members soon changed their minds, and Jovanović was asked to paint a composition showing the everyday lives of the town's inhabitants. Over {{the course of the}} triptych's creation, Jovanović visited his hometown {{on a number of occasions}} for the purpose of sketching its people and structures. The triptych proved to be a particularly difficult undertaking. Jovanović's firm grasp in Western Medieval panel and mural painting proved of great importance. Earlier, Jovanović had been the recipient of several church commissions that called for <b>multi-sectional</b> painting, though not to the same extent as some of his contemporaries, such as Uroš Predić. Each scene needed to connect seamlessly with the others, and Jovanović was met with the additional challenge of painting a number of figures engaged in actions requiring precise definition. The artist addressed this by carefully drawing each figure, the landscape and the panels themselves so as to ensure compositional unity. To ensure natural light, Jovanović painted the triptych out of studio, en plein air. It took the artist about ten months to complete.|$|E
2500|$|In Paris, {{his musical}} {{vocabulary}} established, Villa-Lobos {{solved the problem}} of his works' form. It was perceived as an incongruity that his Brazilian impressionism should be expressed {{in the form of}} quartets and sonatas. He developed new forms to free his imagination from the constraints of conventional musical development such as that required in sonata form. The <b>multi-sectional</b> poema form may be seen in the Suite for Voice and Violin, which is somewhat like a triptych, and the Poema da criança e sua mamã for voice, flute, clarinet, and cello (1923). [...] The extended Rudepoêma for piano, written for Rubinstein, is a multi-layered work, often requiring notation on several staves, and is both experimental and demanding. [...] Wright calls it [...] "the most impressive result" [...] of this formal development. The Ciranda, or Cirandinha is a stylised treatment of simple Brazilian folk melodies {{in a wide variety of}} moods. [...] A ciranda is a child's singing game, but Villa-Lobos's treatment in the works he gave this title are sophisticated. [...] Another form was the Chôros. Villa-Lobos composed more than a dozen works with this title for various instruments, mostly in the years 19241929. He described them as [...] "a new form of musical composition", a transformation of the Brazilian music and sounds [...] "by the personality of the composer".|$|E
2500|$|Thirty-seven of Byrd's motets were {{published}} in two sets of Cantiones sacrae, which appeared in 1589 and 1591. Together with two sets of English songs, discussed below, these collections, dedicated to powerful Elizabethan lords (Edward Somerset, 4th Earl of Worcester and John Lumley, 1st Baron Lumley), probably formed part of Byrd's campaign to re-establish himself in Court circles after the reverses of the 1580s. They may also {{reflect the fact that}} Byrd's fellow monopolist Tallis and his printer Thomas Vautrollier had died, thus creating a more propitious climate for publishing ventures. Since many of the motet texts of the 1589 and 1591 sets are pathetic in tone, {{it is not surprising that}} many of them continue and develop the 'affective-imitative' vein found in some motets from the 1570s, though in a more concise and concentrated form. Domine praestolamur (1589) is a good example of this style, laid out in imitative paragraphs based on subjects which characteristically emphasise the expressive minor second and minor sixth, with continuations which subsequently break off and are heard separately (another technique which Byrd had learnt from his study of Ferrabosco). Byrd evolved a special [...] "cell" [...] technique for setting the petitionary clauses such as miserere mei or libera nos Domine which form the focal point for a number of the texts. Particularly striking examples of these are the final section of Tribulatio proxima est (1589) and the <b>multi-sectional</b> Infelix ego (1591), a large-scale motet which takes its point of departure from Tribue Domine of 1575.|$|E

50|$|Later northerners like Franz Tunder, Georg Böhm and Johann Adam Reincken all {{cultivated}} a harmonically and rhythmically complex improvisatory style {{rooted in}} the chorale improvisation tradition. Forms such as the organ prelude (a <b>multi-sectional</b> composition with numerous flourishes and embellishments such as scale runs, arpeggios and complex counterpoint) and the chorale fantasia (a musical setting of a whole verse of the chorale text, resulting in a <b>multi-sectional</b> composition with contrasting sections for different lines) were developed almost exclusively by north German composers. Dieterich Buxtehude's work represents the pinnacle of this tradition; the praeludia form {{the core of his}} work. Nikolaus Bruhns was the most important of Buxtehude's pupils, but he died early and only a few works by him survive.|$|E

50|$|Bach's toccatas {{are among}} the most famous {{examples}} of the form, and his Toccata and Fugue in D minor, BWV 565 {{is one of the most}} popular organ works today, although its authorship is disputed by some authorities. His toccatas for organ are improvisatory compositions, and are often followed by an independent fugue movement. In such cases the toccata is used in place of the usually more stable prelude. Bach's toccatas for harpsichord are <b>multi-sectional</b> works which include fugal writing as part of their structure.|$|E
5000|$|Steigleder's Tabulaturbuch (Strasbourg, 1627) {{consists}} of 40 variations on Luther's chorale [...] "Vater unser im Himmelreich". This collection {{was intended for}} the church organist, and Steigleder specifically states that the performer may choose how many variations to play, which ones and in what sequence. Certain variations call for a supporting instrument or singer to reinforce the chorale melody. Steigleder employs {{a vast array of}} techniques from simple 2 voice settings to double counterpoint, extensive <b>multi-sectional</b> fantasies and toccatas, various canons, hocket, and many more.|$|E
50|$|Many {{instruments}} with enharmonic keyboards {{were built}} during the Renaissance and Baroque eras. Most composers and performers who used these instruments are virtually unknown today. Among them are Johann Kaspar Kerll's teacher, Giovanni Valentini, {{who played a}} harpsichord with 77 keys for 4 octaves (19 keys per octave plus one extra C), and Friedrich Suppig, published one of the definitive works for an instrument with an enharmonic keyboard: the Fantasia of the Labyrinthus Musicus, which is a <b>multi-sectional</b> composition that makes use of all 24 keys and is intended for a keyboard with 31 notes per octave and pure major thirds.|$|E

Gibbons's surviving keyboard output comprises some 45 pieces. The polyphonic fantasia and dance forms are the best represented genres. Gibbons's writing exhibits a command of three- and four-part counterpoint. Most of the fantasias are complex, <b>multi-sectional</b> pieces, treating multiple subjects imitatively. Gibbons's approach to melody, in both his fantasias and his dances, features extensive development of simple musical ideas, as for example in Pavane in D minor and Lord Salisbury's Pavan and Galliard.|$|E

The four ricercares of Intavolatura libro primo are <b>multi-sectional</b> works consisting essentially of series of imitative expositions of different subjects. Interestingly, the two surviving ensemble ricercares by Cavazzoni do not share these characteristics: there are no sections, no clearly defined cadential points, and the works are quite short compared to their keyboard counterparts. Cavazzoni's two canzonas, also contained in Intavolatura libro primo, are similar in design. They employ short, lively subjects derived from those in works by other composers.|$|E
5000|$|Coelho's most {{important}} compositions are his tientos, {{which are very}} long (200 - 300 bars on average), <b>multi-sectional</b> pieces. Imitative counterpoint has a secondary role in them, whereas motivic figures and figuration, hallmarks of the Baroque style, are in the foreground. The harmonic language is simple and clear {{in sharp contrast to}} the contemporary Italian composers (i.e., Ascanio Mayone, Giovanni Maria Trabaci and Girolamo Frescobaldi); the contrapuntal techniques are reminiscent of Sweelinck. Coelho's liturgical pieces are less ornate, and generally employ more strict counterpoint. They include a group of 23 versets para se cantarem ao órgâo, [...] "for singing to the organ", which all consist of a vocal line with organ accompaniment.|$|E

50|$|As a {{composer}} Albertini is known {{by a single}} collection of music, the twelve Sonatinae (sonatas for violin and basso continuo) posthumously published in Vienna and in Frankfurt in 1692. The collection was prepared for publication by Albertini himself, {{but he did not}} live to see it printed, possibly because of the high cost of the copperplate engraving process. Albertini's sonatas are <b>multi-sectional</b> pieces, very varied in content and structure, and all of the highest quality. Some idea of the rich variety of forms found in the Sonatinae may be gleaned from the following examples: Sonata IX is a passacaglia in which the main theme is presented as a canon at the fifth in the first and the last sections; and statements of the ostinato sometimes overlap with formal sections of the sonata. Sonata XII, the last in the cycle, consists entirely of imitative movements, unlike other sonatas, in which imitative movements are either absent or are surrounded by free sections, such as slow lyrical arias, toccata-like movements with rapid passagework over sustained bass notes, etc. Albertini's sonatas are very demanding technically, with frequent instances of difficult fast passages, leaps, sudden changes of register and, particularly in the last sonata, double stopping.|$|E

They brought with them a love for the French contredanse, a <b>multi-sectional</b> dance form that evolved into the danzón, the quintessential charanga style. Both were performed by an ensemble called an orquesta típica, a group with brass, woodwinds and timpani that performed outdoors. When the upper classes decided to dance indoors, the instrumentation was radically altered. The new ensemble was called charanga francesa. Although the word francesa literally means [...] "French," [...] it was used in nineteenth-century Cuba more specifically as a name for Haitian Creoles. In the charanga francesa, flutes and strings replaced the brass and woodwinds of the orquesta típica, and a small drum kit called pailas (now called timbales) replaced the booming tympany. While the orquesta típica was raucous in a New Orleans jazz fashion, the charanga francesa produced a light and somewhat effete music.

5000|$|More radical {{in their}} {{departure}} from established musical conventions were Black Sabbath, whose origins lay as a band playing blues and {{rock and roll}} covers within the mainstream Birmingham music scene of the 1960s. From 1969 onwards they {{moved away from the}} traditional structures of rock and roll music entirely, using modal rather than three-chord blues forms and creating an entirely new set of musical codes based on <b>multi-sectional</b> design, unresolved tritones and Aeolian riffs. Their 1970 album Black Sabbath first saw the pattern of angular riffs, power chords, down-tuned guitars and crushingly high volume that would come to characterise heavy metal. Paranoid, their second album, refined and focused this model, and in the process [...] "defined the sound and style of heavy metal more than any other album in rock history". Paranoid also marked Black Sabbath's commercial breakthrough, reaching number 1 in the UK album charts and number 8 in the US. Black Sabbath's influence is universal throughout heavy metal and its many subgenres, but their musical significance extends well beyond metal: their discovery that guitar-based music could be fundamentally alienating would lead directly {{to the sound of the}} Sex Pistols and the birth of punk; and their influence would be felt by bands as diverse as the post-punk Joy Division, the avant-garde Sonic Youth, the Seattle-based grunge bands Nirvana, Mudhoney, Soundgarden and Alice in Chains, Californian stoner rock, and even the rap of Ice-T, Cypress Hill and Eminem.|$|E

A typical <b>multi-sectional</b> facade consists of a top section, representing the non-viewing (daylighting) part, a main middle (viewing) section and a spandrel section. The top section can transmit daylight deeper into the space and the middle section should provide direct outside view (or privacy) and protect from glare and sunlight. The two sections may have different areas, glazing properties, and shading types and control options.
