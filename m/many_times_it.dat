5|$|Although 0 is {{divisible}} by 2 {{more times}} than any other number, it is not straightforward to quantify exactly how many times that is. For any nonzero integer n, one may define the 2-adic order of n to be {{the number of times}} n is divisible by 2. This description does not work for 0; no matter how <b>many</b> <b>times</b> <b>it</b> is divided by 2, it can always be divided by 2 again. Rather, the usual convention is to set the 2-order of 0 to be infinity as a special case. This convention is not peculiar to the 2-order; {{it is one of the}} axioms of an additive valuation in higher algebra.|$|E
5|$|Home Health Aide: The home health, or hospice, aide {{is not a}} {{core service}} for a hospice patient; this means it is not {{required}} that every patient on hospice receive an aide. However, most patients do receive this service, and it is often the one most depended on by the patient and family. The hospice aide typically visits anywhere from 3–7 {{days a week for}} approximately 1–2 hours at each visit. His or her functions include providing respite to the primary caregiver and physical support to the patient, including bathing, dressing, or feeding. <b>Many</b> <b>times</b> <b>it</b> is the hospice aide who develops the closest relationship with the patient, due to the frequency of visits. The hospice aide is not a licensed nurse and therefore can not administer medications, treat wounds, handle IV's or similar treatments.|$|E

5|$|The planets {{were thought}} by Ptolemy to orbit Earth in deferent and {{epicycle}} motions. Although {{the idea that}} the planets orbited the Sun had been suggested <b>many</b> <b>times,</b> <b>it</b> was not until the 17th century that this view was supported by evidence from the first telescopic astronomical observations, performed by Galileo Galilei. At about the same time, by careful analysis of pre-telescopic observation data collected by Tycho Brahe, Johannes Kepler found the planets' orbits were not circular but elliptical. As observational tools improved, astronomers saw that, like Earth, the planets rotated around tilted axes, and some shared such features as ice caps and seasons. Since the dawn of the Space Age, close observation by space probes has found that Earth and the other planets share characteristics such as volcanism, hurricanes, tectonics, and even hydrology.|$|E

It {{is not necessary}} to confess venial sins although they may be confessed, a practice that began with the Irish monks around the 12th century. Venial sins are all sins that are not mortal. The Church encourages frequent, intelligent use of the sacrament of confession even if a person has only venial sins, in view of the benefits that might be derived.|$|E
25|$|The {{very first}} step which is {{normally}} overlooked {{by the top}} level management is defining the exact problem.

If the problem is not identified properly then we may face a problem as each and every member of the group might have a different definition of the problem.

Only then is it possible for the group members to find alternate sources or problem solving in an effective manner.|$|E
25|$|Unlike other main-line railway companies, the LB had {{to share}} both its London termini with its rivals, London Bridge with the SER and Victoria with the LCDR. The rapid {{increase}} in commuting {{towards the end of}} the nineteenth century created an urgent need to expand the cramped and limited facilities at Victoria. During the first decade of the new century the line between Grosvenor Bridge and Victoria was widened and the station rebuilt on a much larger scale. A new turntable and locomotive servicing facilities enabled the use of more powerful locomotives. During the same period LB facilities at London Bridge were enlarged, but since the station had been rebuilt so <b>many</b> <b>times</b> <b>it</b> remained a ‘’sprawling confusion'’.|$|E

25|$|T-5 HO {{lights are}} the newest {{variation}} on fluorescent lights. They are run at slightly higher power levels than standard fluorescent lamps, but are made significantly thinner than standard fluorescent bulbs, {{which allows for}} more efficient reflector designs that get more light into the aquarium. Higher quality T-5 systems often match or exceed the output of equivalent power compact fluorescent or VHO lighting fixtures. On the downside, T-5 lighting {{is the most expensive}} type fluorescent lighting available. <b>Many</b> <b>times</b> <b>it</b> is much cheaper per watt, especially in the long run with the multiple T-5 bulbs being replaced, to use an equivalent metal halide light setup over a T-5 setup if such high light output is required.|$|E
25|$|A castle {{was built}} by the English to protect and {{dominate}} this position. It was located at what is now Castle Place, where several roads meet {{at the top of}} High Street. The castle was attacked, recovered, destroyed and rebuilt <b>many</b> <b>times.</b> <b>It</b> was first destroyed in 1315 by Edward le Bruce, who came to Ireland on the invitation of O'Neill and other Irish chieftains. The replacement building was dismantled in 1503 by Gerald, Earl of Kildare, rebuilt by the Irish and subsequently destroyed by the same Earl of Kildare in 1512. In 1552 Lord Deputy James Croft fortified the castle and put it under the command of Hugh Mac Neil Oge, who swore allegiance to the English crown. When Mac Neil Oge was killed by Scottish attackers in 1555, the castle was committed to the custody of Englishman Randolphus Lane. The old Belfast Castle was eventually destroyed by fire on 25 April 1708.|$|E

Several music stores, however, had posted a different one: June 5, 2008. Finally, in an interview on Orange FM on June 2, 2008, Paparizou stated that the album would be released on June 12, 2008, however, on June 11, 2008 the album was available through online download retailers such as the Greek iTunes. On June 13 it was released on all major European iTunes. The album was released as Vrisko To Logo Na Zo: The Deluxe Edition on December 22 to contain a bonus DVD. The DVD includes the Paparizou's concert in Athens, which was held in September 2008. The director is Kostas Kapetanidis and this DVD consists of 19 solo songs performed by Helena and 3 duets performed by Helena, Stavento and Manos Pirovolakis. Furthermore, the DVD includes bonus backstage material, which consists of a Helena's interview before the concert and the Helena's rehearsal of the concert.

25|$|A graded poset (with {{positive}} integer ranks) cannot {{have any}} elements x for which arbitrarily long chains with greatest element x exist, as otherwise {{it would have}} to have elements of arbitrarily small (and eventually negative) rank. For instance, the integers (with the usual order) cannot be a graded poset, nor can any interval (with more than one element) of rational or real numbers. (In particular, graded posets are well-founded, meaning that they satisfy the descending chain condition (DCC): they do not contain any infinite descending chains. has arbitrarily long chains descending fromnbsp&, but has no infinite descending chains.) Henceforth we shall therefore only consider posets in which this does not happen. This implies that whenever xnbsp&<nbsp&y we can get from x to y by repeatedly choosing a cover, finitely <b>many</b> <b>times.</b> <b>It</b> also means that (for positive integer rank functions) compatibility of ρ with the ordering follows from the requirement about covers. As a variant of the definition of a graded poset, Birkhoff allows rank functions to have arbitrary (rather than only nonnegative) integer values. In this variant, the integers can be graded (by the identity function) in his setting, and the compatibility of ranks with the ordering is not redundant. As a third variant, Brightwell and West define a rank function to be integer-valued, but don't require its compatibility with the ordering; hence this variant can grade even e.g. the real numbers by any function, as the requirement about covers is vacuous for this example.|$|E
