40|$|State {{trading is}} a common feature in the <b>management</b> <b>of</b> <b>imports</b> and exports of {{agricultural}} products {{and it has been}} a long-standing feature of China's agricultural trade regime. While the use of state trading was modified by China's accession to the WTO, it remains a dominant feature for some commodities, even though there have been recent attempts to diminish its importance. In this article, we review the role that the state trading enterprise (STE), China National Cereals, Oils and Foodstuffs Import and Export Company (COFCO), continues to play in the importing and exporting of some agricultural commodities. We then review the economic theory that has been developed to measure the tariff equivalent of importing STEs. Finally, we apply that theory through a calibration exercise to measure the tariff equivalent of COFCO in China's import market for wheat. The distortionary impact of COFCO depends on the bias in government policy toward agriculture, the competitiveness of the domestic procurement market, and also the number of firms that are allocated licenses to import alongside COFCO.

Aim {{of this study was}} to compare clinical and parasitological manifestations of loiasis between subjects born in endemic areas and expatriates/travelers. Methods: we report clinical and parasitological manifestations of 100 patients with imported loiasis seen between 1993 and 2013 at the Center of Tropical Diseases, Negrar, Italy. Results: among the 100 patients, 30 were African immigrants, 70 were Europeans (59 long-term expatriates and 11 travelers). Thirty-five patients (19 Africans and 16 Europeans) had positive microfilaremia. Calabar swellings were twice as frequent in Europeans (90 %) than in Africans (46. 7 %), while a history of "eyeworm" was recorded in a higher proportion of Africans (43. 3 %) than in Europeans (17. 4 %).

40|$|Background: Botswana {{has made}} {{substantial}} progress towards malaria elimination across the country. This work assessed interventions and epidemiological characteristics of malaria in Botswana, {{during a period}} of decreasing transmission intensity. Methods: National passive malaria surveillance data for five years (2008 – 2012) were analysed. A district-level, random effects model with Poisson regression was used to explore the association between malaria cases and coverage with long-lasting insecticide-treated nets (LLINs) and indoor residual spraying (IRS). Malaria cases were mapped to visualize spatio-temporal variation in malaria for each year. Results: Within five years, a reduction in malaria prevalence (approximately 98 %) and number of deaths (12 to three) was observed. Between 2008 and 2012, 237, 050 LLINs were distributed and 596, 979 rooms were sprayed with insecticides. Coverage with LLINs and IRS was not uniformly distributed over the study period and only targeted the northern districts with a high malaria burden. The coverage of IRS was associated with a reduction in malaria cases. Conclusions: Botswana has made significant strides towards its goal of country-wide elimination of malaria.

The assessment of malaria importation would provide key data i) to select countries with propitious conditions for pre-elimination phase and ii) to predict its feasibility. Recently, a sero-prevalence study in Djibouti indicated low malaria prevalence, which is propitious for the implementation of pre-elimination, but data on the extent of malaria importation remain unknown. Methods: Djiboutian plasmodial populations were analysed over an eleven-year period (1998, 1999, 2002 and 2009). The risk of malaria importation was indirectly assessed by using plasmodial population parameters. Based on 5 microsatellite markers, expected heterozygosity (H. e.), multiplicity of infection, pairwise Fst index, multiple correspondence analysis and individual genetic relationship were determined. The prevalence of single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with pyrimethamine resistance was also determined. Results: Data indicated a significant decline in genetic diversity (0. 51, 0. 59, 0. 51 and 0 in 1998, 1999, 2002 and 2009, respectively) over the study period, which is inconsistent with the level of malaria importation described in a previous study.

In March 2009, DENV- 3 was isolated for the second time, occurring about 30 years after the previous circulation. In August, 3 other cases emerged. One much larger outbreak occurred again in 2010. To address the origin and particularly {{to determine whether the}} outbreaks were caused by the same viral genotype, we investigated the epidemiological and molecular characteristics of the introduction, spread and genetic microevolution of DENV- 3 involved. Three imported cases (index- 1, 2, 3) separately traveled back from Vietnam, India and Tanzania, resulted in 1, 3 and 60 secondary autochthonous cases, respectively. In autochthonous cases, 64. 6 % positive in IgM anti-DENV and 18. 6 % in IgG from a total of 48 submitted serum samples, accompanied by 7 DENV- 3 isolates. With 99. 8 %, 99. 7 %, and 100 % envelope gene nucleotidic identity, 09 /GZ/ 1081 from index- 1 and endemic strain (09 /GZ/ 1483) belonged to genotype V; 09 /GZ/ 10616 from index- 2 and endemic strains (09 /GZ/ 11144 and 09 /GZ/ 11194) belonged to genotype III Clade-A; and 10 /GZ/ 4898 from index- 3 and all four 2010 endemic DENV- 3 strains belonged to genotype III Clade-B, respectively.

The {{aim of the}} present study was to investigate the evolution and outcome of patients diagnosed with Plasmodium falciparum malaria at a Belgian referral institute in order to assess the safety of the institute's current selective ambulatory management protocol. From 2000 to 2005, all patients diagnosed with P. falciparum infection at the Institute of Tropical Medicine and the University Hospital of Antwerp were enrolled prospectively. Ambulatory treatment was offered to nonvomiting patients if they exhibited none of the 2000 World Health Organization criteria of severity and had parasitemia below 1 % at the initial assessment. The treatment of choice was quinine (plus doxycycline or clindamycin) for inpatients and atovaquone-proguanil for outpatients. P. falciparum malaria was diagnosed in 387 patients, of whom 246 (64 %) were Western travelers or expatriates and 117 (30 %) were already on antimalarial therapy. At diagnosis, 60 (15 %) patients had severe malaria. Vital organ dysfunction was initially seen in 34 and developed later in five others. Five patients died.

40|$|Abstract Background Bhutan has {{achieved}} a major reduction in malaria incidence amid multiple challenges. This case study seeks to characterize the Bhutan malaria control programme over the last 10 years. Methods A review of the malaria epidemiology, control strategies, and elimination strategies employed in Bhutan was carried out through a literature review of peer-reviewed and grey national and international literature {{with the addition of}} reviewing the surveillance and vector control records of the Bhutan Vector-Borne Disease Control Programme (VDCP). Data triangulation was used to identify trends in epidemiology and key strategies and interventions through analysis of the VDCP surveillance and programme records and the literature review. Enabling and challenging factors were identified through analysis of socio-economic and health indicators, corroborated through a review of national and international reports and peer-review articles. Findings Confirmed malaria cases in Bhutan declined by 98. 7 % from 1994 to 2010. The majority of indigenous cases were due to Plasmodium vivax (59. 9 %) and adult males are most at-risk <b>of</b> malaria. <b>Imported</b> cases, or those in foreign nationals, varied over the years, reaching 21. 8 % of all confirmed cases in 2006. Strategies implemented by the VDCP are likely {{to be related to the}} decline in cases over the last 10 years. Access to malaria diagnosis in treatment was expanded throughout the country and evidence-based case management, including the introduction of artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) for P. falciparum, increasing coverage of high risk areas with Indoor Residual Spraying, insecticide-treated bed nets, and long-lasting insecticidal nets are likely to have contributed to the decline alongside enabling factors such as economic development and increasing access to health services. Conclusion Bhutan has made significant strides towards elimination and has adopted a goal of national elimination. A major challenge in the future will be prevention and <b>management</b> <b>of</b> <b>imported</b> malaria infections from neighbouring Indian states.

The prevalence of single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with pyrimethamine resistance was also determined. RESULTS: Data indicated a significant decline in genetic diversity (0. 51, 0. 59, 0. 51 and 0 in 1998, 1999, 2002 and 2009, respectively) over the study period, which is inconsistent with the level of malaria importation described in a previous study. This suggested that Djiboutian malaria situation may have benefited from the decline of malaria prevalence that occurred in neighbouring countries, in particular in Ethiopia. The high Fst indices derived from plasmodial populations from one study period to another (0. 12 between 1999 and 2002, and 0. 43 between 2002 and 2009) suggested a random sampling <b>of</b> parasites, probably <b>imported</b> from neighbouring countries, leading to oligo-clonal expansion of few different strains during each transmission season. Nevertheless, similar genotypes observed during the study period suggested recurrent migrations and imported malaria. CONCLUSION: In the present study, the extent of genetic diversity was used to assess the risk of malaria importation in the low malaria transmission setting of Djibouti. The molecular approach highlights i) the evolution of Djiboutian plasmodial population profiles that are consistent and compatible with Djiboutian pre-elimination goals and ii) the necessity to implement the monitoring of plasmodial populations and interventions at the regional scale in the Horn of Africa to ensure higher efficiency of malaria control and elimination...|$|R
40|$|This review aims to {{summarize}} the body of knowledge available on Zika virus to date.  A comprehensive review of the scientific literature on Zika virus was performed with the aim to stress relevant aspects for healthcare professionals in non-endemic area. For several years, the Zika virus infection was considered an extremely rare exotic disease with poor clinical relevance. However, Zika virus has recently gained {{the attention of the}} scientific community and public opinion since the virus spread to the Pacific islands and the South America in an unprecedented epidemic, and additionally due to the definitive evidence that the infection could be complicated by Guillain-Barré syndrome, passed through vertical transmission, and result in central nervous system abnormalities (including microcephaly) of the fetus. Studies and scientific evidences on the complications associated with Zika virus infection are growing day by day. It is advisable that the healthcare professionals working in non-endemic areas maintain full awareness on this issue in order to practice proper <b>management</b> <b>of</b> the <b>imported</b> cases <b>of</b> Zika virus infection...|$|R
40|$|Abstract In this {{position}} paper, the European Society for Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases, Study Group on Clinical Parasitology, summarizes main issues regarding the <b>management</b> <b>of</b> <b>imported</b> malaria cases. Malaria {{is a rare}} diagnosis in Europe, {{but it is a}} medical emergency. A travel history is the key to suspecting malaria and is mandatory in patients with fever. There are no specific clinical signs or symptoms of malaria although fever is seen in almost all non-immune patients. Migrants from malaria endemic areas may have few symptoms. Malaria diagnostics should be performed immediately on suspicion of malaria and the gold- standard is microscopy of Giemsa-stained thick and thin blood films. A Rapid Diagnostic Test (RDT) may be used as an initial screening tool, but does not replace urgent microscopy which should be done in parallel. Delays in microscopy, however, should not lead to delayed initiation of appropriate treatment. Patients diagnosed with malaria should usually be hospitalized. If outpatient management is preferred, as is the practice in some European centres, patients must usually be followed closely (at least daily) until clinical and parasitological cure. Treatment of uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria is either with oral artemisinin combination therapy (ACT) or with the combination atovaquone/proguanil. Two forms of ACT are available in Europe: artemether/lumefantrine and dihydroartemisinin/piperaquine. ACT is also effective against Plasmodium vivax, Plasmodium ovale, Plasmodium malariae and Plasmodium knowlesi, but these species can be treated with chloroquine. Treatment of persistent liver forms in P. vivax and P. ovale with primaquine is indicated after excluding glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency. There are modified schedules and drug options for the treatment of malaria in special patient groups, such as children and pregnant women. The potential for drug interactions and the role of food in the absorption of anti-malarials are important considerations in the choice of treatment. Complicated malaria is treated with intravenous artesunate resulting in a much more rapid decrease in parasite density compared to quinine. Patients treated with intravenous artesunate should be closely monitored for haemolysis for four weeks after treatment. There is a concern in some countries about the lack of artesunate produced according to Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP). </p...|$|R

40|$|Malaria is {{the most}} {{important}} vector borne disease worldwide. Globally it results in an estimated 400 million infections and more than 1 million deaths each year. Although malaria is a rare cause of hospital admission in the United Kingdom, it constitutes a substantial health threat for people travelling in endemic areas. The incidence <b>of</b> <b>imported</b> malaria is rising throughout much of the developed world, largely because of a global increase in long distance travel, immigration, and the resurgence of malaria in many tropical countries. Moreover, although Plasmodium vivax was once the most common form <b>of</b> <b>imported</b> malaria, it has since been superseded by P falciparum—the only form of malaria that can be lethal—which now accounts for some 80 % of reported cases. Around 15 % of episodes of malaria occur in children aged 15 years or younger. Most of those affected are UK residents of African ethnicity who have recently visited family in endemic areas but have not taken preventive measures. Nevertheless, even strict compliance with preventive measures is never 100 % effective, as resistance to available chemoprophylactic agents is increasing {{in many parts of the}} world. Although most cases of P falciparum malaria in patients presenting to health services in the UK are uncomplicated, up to 10 % become severe and life threatening malaria, principally because of delays in diagnosis and inadequate treatment. In uncomplicated disease, the clinical features of malaria are similar in children and adults, but in severe disease, the clinical spectrum, complications, and management differ and merit the development of separate guidelines for children. We therefore propose the following guidelines for the assessment and emergency <b>management</b> <b>of</b> children with <b>imported</b> malaria. Citation: Maitland, K. et al. (2005).
