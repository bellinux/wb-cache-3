Foreign producers compete in quantity {{as well as in}} quality of outputs. We show that consumer exclusions always occur due to the trade policy and prove that a specific tariff upgrades the quality choice of some consumers who purchased the <b>minimum</b> <b>quality</b> <b>requirement's</b> <b>quality</b> level. However, the specific tariff does not a ect the quality choice of the remaining consumers who purchased at a quality level higher than the <b>minimum</b> <b>quality</b> <b>requirement</b> (MQR). Under some conditions, an ad valorem tariff is shown to downgrade the quality of imports. Furthermore, a quota is also proved to downgrade the quality of imports, to lower the social welfare, and to raise the prices of imports. Moreover, we also investigate a policy with a quality ceiling on imports. In this regime we demonstrate that a specific tariff downgrades the quality choice of some consumers who purchased the maximum quality level. Finally, we derive the condition and demonstrate that an increase in the MQR results in a smaller market size and upgrades the quality of imports...|$|R

40|$|Most {{existing}} unequal loss protection (ULP) schemes do {{not consider}} the <b>minimum</b> <b>quality</b> <b>requirement</b> and usually have high computation complexity. In this research, we propose a layered ULP (L-ULP) scheme to solve these problems. In particular, we use the rate-based optimal solution with a local search to find the average forward error correction (FEC) allocation and use the gradient search to find the FEC solution for each layer. Experimental {{results show that the}} executing time of L-ULP is much faster than the traditional ULP scheme but the average distortion is worse. Therefore, we further propose to combine the L-ULP with the pre-interleaving to have an improved L-ULP (IL-ULP) system. By using the pre-interleaving, we are able to delay the occurrence of the first unrecoverable loss in the source bitstream and thus improve the loss resilience performance. With the better loss resilience performance in the source bitstream, our proposed IL-ULP scheme is allowed to have a weaker FEC protection and allocate more bits to the source coding, which leads to the improvement of the overall performance. Experimental results show that our proposed IL-ULP scheme even outperforms the global optimal result obtained by any traditional ULP scheme while the complexity of IL-ULP is almost the same as L-ULP...|$|R

The paper examined accessibility to {{water supply and sanitation}} services in the Awutu Senya East Municipality and the accompanying consequences. In the analysis of water provision responsibility, it was established that the contribution of private individuals constituted 64. 2 % of daily water production while public water provision effort constituted 35. 8 %. In spite of the enviable contributions of private individuals in water provision efforts in the Municipality, however, about 45 % of the water sources are salty while 28 % are impure and contaminated.

As a consequence, explorative analysis (in contrast to purely hypothesis driven research procedures) has become applicable. However, numerous issues have to be considered for deriving meaningful results from Omics, and bioinformatics has to respect these in data analysis and interpretation. Aspects include sample type and quality, concise definition of the (clinical) question, and selection of samples ideally coming from thoroughly defined sample and data repositories. Omics suffers from a principal shortcoming, namely unbalanced sample-to-feature matrix denoted as "curse of dimensionality", where a feature refers to a specific gene or protein among the many thousands assayed in parallel in an Omics experiment. This setting makes the identification of relevant features with respect to a phenotype under analysis error prone from a statistical perspective. From this sample size calculation for screening studies and for verification of results from Omics, bioinformatics is essential.

40|$|Purpose: The European Commission's Integrated Product Policy Communication, 2003, defined Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) as the ‘best {{framework}} {{for assessing the}} potential environmental impacts of products'. Since then, the use of LCA and life cycle approaches has been developing {{in a wide range}} of European policies, and its use has also significantly grown in business. Increasing the availability of quality-assured Life Cycle Inventory (LCI) data is the current challenge to ensure the development of LCA in various areas. Methods: One solution to increase availability is to use LCI data from multiple database sources but under the condition that such LCI data are fully interoperable. Results and discussion: This paper presents original solutions and recent achievements towards increased availability, quality and interoperability of life cycle inventory data, developed through European Commission-led activities and based on wide stakeholder consultation and international dialogue. An overview of related activities, such as the International Reference Life Cycle Data System (ILCD), the European Reference Life Cycle Database (ELCD) and the ILCD Entry-Level quality requirements are presented.

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a new {{resource}} allocation framework for multimedia systems that perform multiple simultaneous video decoding tasks. We jointly consider the available system resources (e. g. processor cycles) and the video decoding task’s {{characteristics such as}} the sequence’s content, the bit-rate, and the GOP structure, {{in order to determine}} a fair and optimal resource allocation. To this end, we derive a quality-complexity model that determines the quality (in terms of PSNR) that a task can achieve given a certain system resource allocation. We use these quality-complexity models to determine a quality-fair and Pareto optimal resource allocation using the Kalai-Smorodinski Bargaining Solution (KSBS) from axiomatic bargaining theory. The KSBS explicitly considers the resulting multimedia quality when performing a resource allocation and distributes quality-domain penalties proportional to the difference between each video decoding task’s maximum and <b>minimum</b> <b>quality</b> <b>requirements.</b> We compare the KSBS to other fairness policies in the literature and find that because it explicitly considers multimedia quality it provides significantly fairer resource allocations in terms of the resulting PSNR compared to policies that operate solely in the resource domain. To weight the quality impact of the resource allocations to the different decoding tasks depending on application specific requirements or user preferences, we generalize the existing KSBS solution by introducing bargaining powers based on each video sequence’s motion and texture characteristics...|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} UAV IoT aerial {{sensing that}} delivers multiple VR/AR immersive communication sessions to remote users. The UAV swarm is spatially distributed {{over a wide}} area of interest, and each UAV captures a viewpoint of the scene below it. The remote users are interested in visual immersive navigation of specific subareas/scenes of interest, reconstructed on their respective VR/AR devices from the captured data. The reconstruction quality of the immersive scene representations at the users {{will depend on the}} sampling/sensing rates associated with each UAV. There is a limit on the aggregate amount of data that the UAV swarm can sample and send towards the users, stemming from physical/transmission capacity constraints. Similarly, each VR/AR application has <b>minimum</b> reconstruction <b>quality</b> <b>requirements</b> for its own session. We propose an optimization framework that makes three contributions in this context. First, we select the optimal sampling rates to be used by each UAV, such that the system and application constraints are not exceed, while the priority weighted reconstruction quality across all VR/AR sessions is maximized. Then, we design an optimal scalable source-channel signal representation that instills into the captured data inherent rate adaptivity, unequal error protection, and minimum required redundancy. Finally, the UAV transmission efficiency is enhanced by the use of small-form-factor multi-beam directional antennas and optimal power/link scheduling across the scalable signal representation layers. Our experiments demonstrate competitive advantages over conventional methods for visual sensing. This is a first-of-its-kind study of an emerging application of prospectively broad societal impact.
