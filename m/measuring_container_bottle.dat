40|$|A sedimentation-potential-generating {{apparatus}} {{has been}} improved to make precision measurement. In {{the course of}} the first discussion, a theoretical analysis of the apparatus {{made it clear that the}} mass of the movable parts including a <b>measuring</b> <b>container</b> had to be as little as possible. Therefore, the apparatus was so desingned that the <b>measuring</b> <b>container</b> could be smaller, and that the shield in the apparatus could be devided into two parts, a movable shield and a fixed one. The apparatus was applied to measure sedimentation potential generated in the solutions of twenty alkali halide compounds. The result showed that there is a certain relation between sedimentation potential and atomic weight...|$|R

30|$|The {{same can}} be said of the <b>container</b> <b>measure</b> words as the second type of <b>measure</b> words. <b>Container</b> <b>measure</b> words, such as 包 bao ‘package’, 箱 xiang ‘case’, etc. can in {{principle}} measure any entity as long as the real world context allows that entity to be put inside that particular container. In other words, a <b>container</b> <b>measure</b> word denotes a time-variant state where the entity is (envisioned to be) contained inside the type of container specified. The interpretation of the following D-M compounds are situation and context dependent: 三包糖 san bao tang ‘three packs of sugar’, 三箱糖 san xiang tang ‘three cartons of sugar’, 三包筆 san bao bi ‘three packs of pens’, 三箱筆 san xiang bi ‘three cartons of pens’. There is no way to ascertain the actual quantity of objects in each container without explicit knowledge of the particular situations. Like standard <b>measure</b> words, <b>container</b> <b>measure</b> words’ perdurant property is shown by its high versatility in measuring and denoting properties of all types of entities. In addition, the interpretation of the property (both of volume and ways contained) of each container is also dependent on the container or the (partially conventionalized) way of packaging involved in defining the container. Again, the note on the possibility of borrowing SPAN ontology concept for description a SNAP ontology, discussed in the last section on measure words, also applies here. In other words, when required by real world context, the language does allow a speaker to select a perdurant property described by a container classifier to treat it as an endurant.|$|R

40|$|Ontarians are {{producing}} more waste {{per capita than}} previous generations and consuming more bottled water. Using the product policy quadrangle developed by Oosternhuis (1996), the research examines four components of Ontario bottled water packaging policy— policy objectives, policy instruments, product groups and actors. Interviews with Ontario experts reveal stakeholder communication and Extended Producer Responsibility can promote packaging minimization. There was no agreement about whether Ontario has a waste policy framework to support bottled water waste reduction, reuse and recycling. Stakeholders did agree that a policy framework can help to promote packaging minimization. The discussion will examine the following: various concepts to support zero waste, eco-labelling, policy objectives, enforcement, use of language, focus on financial obligations, deposit-return systems, refillable <b>containers,</b> <b>bottle</b> standardization, waste minimization, how waste is measured, {{an evaluation of the}} waste hierarchy, reporting waste reduction and reuse, learning from history and alternative methods of encouraging the consumption of municipal water.

40|$|After the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami {{inundation}} event, thin sediment {{films of}} fining up sequences {{were located in}} several topographic depressions of the southern coastal belt of Sri Lanka. The films consisting of silty fine sand with particular microfossil assemblages were located also in closed <b>containers,</b> <b>bottles</b> and kitchen tables. Well preserved microfossils such as foraminifera, radiolarians as well as spicules of sponges were noted in these recent tsunami sediments. Random augur holes were drilled into some selected depressions in the southern coastal villages of Peraliya and Denuwala situated at locations separated by about 50 km. In several such holes, at least two fining up sequences were located below the surface in soil horizons separated from each other by 35 cm to 1 m. These soil profiles were overlying older coral reefs developed on lateritic formations. The microscopic observations on particular size fractions of the soil horizons showed microfossil assemblages with textures, color and organic C contents strikingly comparable to those observed in the recent tsunami sediments of Sri Lanka. Our findings imply the occurrence {{of at least two}} paleo- tsunami events of different ages in Sri Lanka originating apparently from a common source...|$|R
