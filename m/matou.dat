5000|$|Tsubaki is the Master of Rider in the False Holy Grail War of Fate/strange fake. She {{was born}} to Eastern-Asian magi parents in their thirties seeking for ways to further their future {{in the world of}} magecraft. They were among those who managed to take the actual {{machinery}} underlying the Fuyuki Holy Grail War system, and while there, also obtained partial knowledge on Zouken <b>Matou's</b> magecraft. Seeking to adapt it to their own use, they eventually reached the idea of using magically-modified bacteria to better their host, and decided to use their first born daughter as the test subject. Speaking words like “We will make you into an illustrious mage”, her parents' experiments caused her great pain. They felt no love for her as a person, but only as a vessel to continue their family line. Although their experiments proved to be fruitful, they lost control of some of the bacteria before she was complete. This deprived her of her consciousness, but her parents had long lost any interest in her as a person. She was hospitalized solely for the sake of making sure that an heir could be born from her. While in a coma, Tsubaki entered her dream world, where she initially suffered from great loneliness. After eventually getting used to it, she continued to explore the city, and she eventually stopped keeping track of time after three months. After one year, the False Holy Grail War began to approach. It was noted, by Orlando Reeve, that Tsubaki's parents had planned to ally with the police chief, thus implying that they worked for the government organization of America.|$|R

Madame I believed to be in her chamber; the room whence he had stepped was dedicated to the portress's sole use; and she, Rosine <b>Matou,</b> an unprincipled though pretty little French grisette, airy, fickle, dressy, vain, and mercenary--it was not, surely, to her hand he owed the ordeal through which he seemed to have passed? ...|$|E
