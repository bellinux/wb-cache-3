Furthermore, the changes in LDH associated with acute bowel infarction have not been documented. To determine the changes in serum CPK and LDH in acute colonic infarction, laparotomies were performed on dogs after peripheral baseline blood samples were drawn and each subject was randomly placed in one of three groups: laparotomy alone, acute colonic obstruction, and acute colonic infarction by ligation of the inferior mesenteric artery. The marginal artery of the colon was ligated at the peritoneal reflection and at the cecum to interrupt arterial collaterals. Blood samples were taken from each subject at intervals of three hours for 48 hours after injury. Serum from each sample was analyzed for total CPK and LDH by automated spectrophotometry. Isoenzymes were determined by agarose gel electrophoresis. Necropsies were conducted on all the dogs to confirm that the intended condition had been produced and that no intercurrent disease was present. The data support the conclusion that total CPK, total LDH and their isoenzymes become elevated in the peripheral serum after colonic infarction. The maximal elevations were all seen within the first 12 hours after acute colonic infarction.

40|$|Acute epiploic appendagitis most {{commonly}} manifests with acute lower quadrant pain. Its clinical features {{are similar to}} those of acute diverticulitis or, less commonly, acute appendicitis. The conditions that may mimic acute epiploic appendagitis at computed tomography (CT) include acute omental <b>infarction,</b> <b>mesenteric</b> panniculitis, fat-containing tumor, and primary and secondary acute inflammatory processes in the large bowel (eg, diverticulitis and appendicitis). Whereas the location of acute epiploic appendagitis is {{most commonly}} adjacent to the sigmoid colon, acute omental infarction is typically located in the right lower quadrant and often is mistaken for acute appendicitis. It is important to correctly diagnose acute epiploic appendagitis and acute omental infarction on CT images because these conditions may be mistaken for acute abdomen, and the mistake may lead to unnecessary surgery. The CT features of acute epiploic appendagitis include an oval lesion 1. 5 - 3. 5 cm in diameter, with attenuation similar to that of fat and with surrounding inflammatory changes, that abuts the anterior sigmoid colon wall. The CT features of acute omental infarction include a well-circumscribed triangular or oval heterogeneous fatty mass with a whorled pattern of concentric linear fat stranding between the anterior abdominal wall and the transverse or ascending colon. As CT increasingly is used for the evaluation of acute abdomen, radiologists are likely to see acute epiploic appendagitis and its mimics more often. Recognition of these conditions on CT images will allow appropriate management of acute abdominal pain and may help to prevent unnecessary surgery...|$|R
40|$|Currently, {{diagnostic}} tests for <b>mesenteric</b> ischaemia and <b>infarction</b> are inadequate due to poor sensitivity and specificity. In addition, many potential markers appear {{too late to}} be clinically useful. At present, definitive diagnosis can only be made {{at the time of}} surgery, which is not ideal as surgery is often to be avoided in critically ill and elderly patients. A clinically useful, minimally invasive test is likely to decrease the currently very high mortality rate and allow monitoring of 2 ̆ 7 at risk 2 ̆ 7 patients during their hospital stay. A two-dimensional electrophoresis based proteomic approach was undertaken to assess plasma protein differences between patients with surgically confirmed bowel infarction and control Intensive Care patients. The major protein differences were found to be members or variants of acute phase proteins. Serum amyloid A showed the largest difference between the two patient groups, and this protein was investigated in greater depth. An analysis was performed to compare the diagnostic ability of several commonly used indicators of critical illness and bowel infarction with serum amyloid A and phospholipase A 2. Although none of the variables were ideal for clinical use, plasma phospholipase A 2 activity showed the best discriminatory power, as determined by Receiver Operating Characteristic curves. From a review of the literature, phospholipase AI (PLA 2) appeared to be increased in the bowel as a result of ischaemia and infarction. In one patient, matched tissues were obtained, and PLA 2 activity was found to be significantly higher in infarcted bowel tissue compared to ischaemic bowel tissue. PLA 2 activity was significantly greater in bowel lumen than tissue, suggesting that the protein was being released, and may enter the circulation. PLA 2 activity was increased in the plasma of bowel infarction patients compared with control patients, though the difference was not significant. The phospholipase activity exhibited a number of similarities to typical phospholipase A 2 proteins, but also showed a number of inconsistent characteristics. For this reason, we wished to identify the protein responsible for the increased phospholipase activity in infarcted human bowel. The PLA 2 activity in human bowel could not be abolished by immunoprecipitation of the PLA 2 isoforms IIA (well described in bowel) and V (a closely related isoform). To investigate these proteins, a native urea protein gel devised for snake venom phospholipase A 2 was modified for use with mammalian phospholipase AI. The modified gel was used to show that the protein with phospholipase activity from infarcted gut was different from normal gut PLA 2 and type IIA PLA 2. A number of extensions were devised for these native gels and were found to be useful both in this investigation and for venom investigations. Protein purification was undertaken to identify the protein responsible for the increased phospholipase activity in infarcted bowel. Protein was purified from infarcted human bowel using a number of techniques that exploited unusual characteristics of the protein. The purification techniques each retained the native activity of the protein and the purification could therefore be monitored with a phospholipid hydrolysis assay at each stage. The protein identified by mass spectrometry was an excellent match for cyclophilin B, an inflammatory protein that had previously been identified in rat bowel at the mRNA level (Hasel et al, 1991, Kainer & Doris, 2000). As the purification progress had been monitored throughout with a phospholipid hydrolysis assay, cyclophilin B was an unexpected identification, as it is not known to have phospholipase activity. Cyclophilin B was removed from the highly purified samples via immunoprecipitation and this process abolished all phospholipase activity. The addition of cyclosporin A, (the pharmaceutical ligand of cyclophilin B), did not effect the phospholipase activity. Cyclophilin B protein was found in normal and infarcted human bowel using Western blotting. Cyclophilin B protein also appeared to be present in the bowel lumen and plasma of several patients with bowel infarction, but not in control patients. Immunohistochemistry confirmed the ubiquitous nature of cyclophilin B that had been reported by other groups. This project has investigated the use of two dimensional gel electrophoresis based proteomics to identify proteins present in the plasma of patients with confirmed bowel infarction and control intensive care patients. The major protein classes observed were members of the acute phase proteins, which highlights the need for pre-fractionation of plasma to identify lower abundance, disease associated proteins. A series of potential plasma markers were compared using Receiver Operating Characteristic Curves. Although no ideal marker was clear from this analysis, phospholipase activity appeared to warrant further investigation. Phospholipase activity was investigated in human infarcted bowel. Protein purification identified cyclophilin B as a bowel protein that showed unusual phospholipid hydrolysing activity. Cyclophilin B is a ubiquitous protein in intestinal cell types in both normal and infarcted tissue. There appears to be release of cyclophilin B into bowel lumen and plasma under conditions of <b>mesenteric</b> ischaemia and <b>infarction...</b>|$|R

We report data from the International Registry of Acute Aortic Dissection (IRAD), {{the largest group of}} patients treated for acute aortic dissections. The aim {{of this study was to}} identify clinical characteristics, therapeutic approaches, risk factors for mortality, in-hospital outcome, and long-term results of this cohort, thus clarifying its natural history. MethodsA comprehensive analysis of 290 clinical variables on 18 patients affected by isolated acute abdominal aortic dissection (IAAAD) was performed. Among 1417 patients enrolled in the IRAD from 1996 to 2003, 532 (37. 5 %) had an acute type B dissection, of which 18 (1. 3 %) had an IAAAD. Theor mean age was 67. 7 ± 13. 3 years, with a male predominance (n = 12, 67 %). Aortic aneurysms pre-existed in 5 patients (28 %). IAAAD was iatrogenic in 2 cases (11 %). ResultsCompared with patients with type B aortic dissections, abdominal pain, <b>mesenteric</b> ischemia or <b>infarction,</b> limb ischemia, and hypotension as initial clinical signs were significantly more frequent in patients with IAAAD, whereas chest pain was more typical in patients with type B dissections. No neurologic symptoms, such as ischemic spinal cord damage or ischemic peripheral neuropathy, occurred in the IAAAD cohort. The 18 IAAAD patients were medically, surgically, or percutaneously managed in 12 (66. 6 %), five (27. 8 %), and one (5. 6 %) cases, respectively. The overall in-hospital mortality rate was 5. 6 % (n = 1). The patient who died was medically managed. No deaths were reported among patients who underwent surgery or had an endovascular procedure, irrespective of their preoperative status. A mean follow-up of 5 years (range, 1 month to 9 years) was completed for 71 % (12 of 17) of the patients. Four patients (33. 3 %) died during the 9 -year follow-up period. Overall survival was 93. 3 % ± 12. 6 % at 1 year and 73. 3 % ± 27. 2 % at 5 years. All patients who died during the follow-up period had in-hospital medical management (P =. 04). ConclusionsIAAAD is a condition that may present differently compared with classic type B aortic dissections. IAAAD patients treated with surgical or endovascular procedures had a lower unadjusted in-hospital and long-term mortality rate compared with medically managed patients. On the basis of the present natural history report, continued surveillance appears mandatory. To improve the life expectancy of patients with IAAAD, aggressive surgical or endovascular management seems justified...|$|R
