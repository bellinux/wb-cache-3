500|$|They again {{finished}} third the following 1960/61 season. Despite a 14 game run without loss, 5 defeats {{in the opening}} 11 matches [...] cost Liverpool promotion. Shareholder John Moores felt the club needed {{to spend more money}} on players to be successful and encouraged chairman T. V. Williams to do so. That summer of 1961 Shankly signed Ian St John from Motherwell and Ron Yeats from Dundee United. ‘Take a walk around my centre-half, gentlemen, he’s a colossus!’ Shankly said to the press conference when announcing Yeats’ arrival. [...] Shankly confidently challenged the board of directors to [...] "sack <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> can't play." [...] St John and Yeats in their first season helped win promotion to the First Division; Unbeaten at home all season, they won the Second Division with 62 points.|$|E
500|$|The two Scottish {{players were}} centre half Ron Yeats and centre forward Ian St John from Dundee United and Motherwell respectively. With Sawyer's help, Shankly signed {{them both in}} the spring of 1961 and {{challenged}} the Liverpool board to [...] "sack <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> can't play". At a press conference when Yeats came to Liverpool, Shankly emphasised Yeats's huge size by inviting the journalists to [...] "go and walk round him; he's a colossus!" [...] Goalkeeper Tommy Lawrence came through the club's junior teams, so Shankly now had his [...] "strength through the middle" [...] and the team building continued with the transfer of wing half Gordon Milne from Preston. Other players developed at Anfield were Jimmy Melia, Ronnie Moran, Alan A'Court and future England internationals Gerry Byrne and Roger Hunt. Shankly said of goalscorer Hunt {{the first time he saw}} him: [...] "Christ, this one can play!" [...] Liverpool had finished third in both 1959–60 and 1960–61 (only the top two clubs were promoted); but the new team gained promotion in the 1961–62 season by winning the Second Division championship, Hunt scoring 41 goals.|$|E
500|$|Since Valene, I’ve {{tried to}} do {{anything}} and everything but play a goody-two-shoes. I love Val, I adore her. But I spent a total of 15 years—if you count the first year I played her on Dallas. That was quite an investment for me as an actress. If you were playing a goody-two-shoes today, the tabloid media would be dying to catch you on a bad day. [...] Look at what they’ve done to Tiger Woods. Look at what they’ve done to that man. My feeling is his father—or the absence of his father in his life—is (the root of) what’s going on with Tiger and that marriage. But the media won’t leave him alone. No matter who you are, (the celebrity coverage) is obsessive and constant. It’s hurtful. For <b>me,</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> show my face in a bad photo, they latch into me hook, line and sinker. Even Entertainment Tonight now has blood on their hands. It's brutal. I wonder what they’ll do with Alec Baldwin now. He was my brother on Knots. They really threw him under a bus (when endlessly publicizing his infamous voice-mail rant against daughter Ireland, then 11, in 2007). He loves that child so much." ...|$|E

2500|$|An {{animated}} {{representation of}} Cutler briefly {{appeared in the}} South Park episode, [...] "Guitar Queer-O." [...] The show is set in Colorado, and the characters are avid Broncos fans. Two characters, Stan and Kyle, meet Cutler and say, [...] "Nice to meet you. I mean, you kinda suck, but my dad says you might be good some day." [...] Cutler himself later responded to the episode, saying, [...] "It was cool. I thought it was funny. They can make fun of <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> want to." ...|$|E
2500|$|When Newman {{died there}} {{appeared}} in a monthly magazine a series of very unflattering sketches by one who had lived under his roof. I ventured to ask Cardinal Manning if he had seen these sketches. He replied that he had and thought them very shocking; the writer must have a very unenviable mind, , and then, having thus sacrificed to propriety, after a moment's pause he added: [...] "But if you ask <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> are like poor Newman, I am bound to say – a photograph." ...|$|E

"Just how President Roosevelt and his {{advisers}} hope to lift the exploited and oppressed out of the mire by increasing profits and raising {{the cost of living}} is too deep for <b>me.</b> <b>If</b> <b>they</b> believe employers will increase wages as their profits increase, then they believe the leopard can change his spots. They should know that increased profits only increase the appetite for profits. The desire for the accumulation of great wealth seems like a disease, and disease has never been cured by increasing its virulence. ...he one lasting solution {{is the end of the}} profit system." ...|$|E

2500|$|Mashinini {{joined the}} Garment Workers Union and {{organised}} in her factory. She became both a shop steward and a floor supervisor appointed by management. She later described the difficult situation resulting {{from these two}} positions: [...] "They could have sacked <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> had wanted. I was a shop steward, but {{if they wanted to}} sack you they could still sack you. Instead, they would try and use me to stop the trouble. They would use me like a fire extinguisher, always there to stop trouble." [...] Ultimately, she wrote, [...] "I had a dual role in the factory, but I was very clear where my first loyalty lay. I was appointed a supervisor but I was elected to be a shop steward by my fellow workers." ...|$|E
2500|$|Originally {{published}} {{under the}} pseudonym [...] "Tex Burns". Louis L'Amour was commissioned to write four Hopalong Cassidy {{books in the}} spring and summer of 1950 by Doubleday's Double D Western imprint. They were the first novels he ever had published and he denied writing them until the day he died, refusing to sign any of them that fans would occasionally bring to his autograph sessions. His reason to his young son for doing this was, [...] "I wrote some books. I just did it for the money, and my name didn't go on them. So now, when people ask <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> were mine, I say no." [...] When his son asked if this was not lying he said, [...] "I just wrote them for hire. They weren't my books." ...|$|E
2500|$|I've {{given up}} {{speaking}} to them. I've said basically everything that possibly {{can be said}} to this bunch. I'm basically leaving it up to them now. They are going to show <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> really want to play for Australia and whether they really want to play under me. I'll find out over the next three games and my decision will be made as to my future as a captain and a player after that... I don't think it's my captaincy... but if we continue to lose, you've just got to start saying: [...] "Right, someone else has to come in and see if they can do something different." [...] It just gets as simple as that. That's the way I see it. The fellows are not responding to me and that's that. I'll find out over the next three games if that's the case or not.|$|E

2500|$|On December 17, 2014, {{nine months}} after Zach Adams' arrest, Judge Creed McGinley chastised {{prosecutors}} for delays {{in the case and}} for the state's failure to turn over evidence to the defense. [...] "I am absolutely out of patience with these cases not moving", he said. Judge McGinley ordered that a bill of particulars will be filed for Zachary Adams' case within seven days and that discovery will take place immediately. The prosecution ignored both deadlines. In response, attorneys for the men filed motions to dismiss charges. The motions filed accuses the state of [...] "silence or stonewalling", stating that, among other things, that the state has yet to disclose evidence that the skull found belongs to Bobo. [...] "It would appear to <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> had a skull with a dental match they would have given that to us right away. It's a little suspicious why we don't have that forensic information", said Autry's attorney Fletcher Long.|$|E
2500|$|The {{rigors of}} the Polish winter, the bad roads and the extreme poverty of certain regions brought about {{considerable}} misery for both sides and rendered proper reconnaissance virtually impossible. After some initial maneuvering and minor engagements, the first major battle occurred at Eylau. Here, the Grande Armée gave battle, despite being seriously outnumbered and with the expected reinforcements failing to materialise, Napoleon's position was looking increasingly perilous. The Emperor thus ordered Marshal Murat to launch the entire reserve cavalry into a massive charge. At first, Murat led forward two dragoons and one cuirassiers divisions and these men pierced the Russian line and carried on beyond, only to find themselves behind enemy lines and in serious danger of being surrounded. As a result, the Emperor ordered Marshal Bessières to help the stranded reserve cavalry and thus a second cavalry charge ensued, spearheaded by the Chasseurs à Cheval and followed by the heavy cavalry of the 5th cuirassiers and Grenadiers à Cheval. Commanding the horse grenadiers was colonel Lepic who superbly led two squadrons of the regiment, as they stormed through {{the first and second}} Russian lines, stopping only in front of the enemy reserves. As the handful of horse grenadiers arrived in front of this third enemy line, they were all but surrounded and the Russians at once demanded that they surrender. Lepic defiantly retorted: [...] "Have a look at my men and tell <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> look like ones who want to surrender!" [...] and he immediately ordered a charge, hacking his way back to his own lines. The regiment lost 4 officers dead and 14 officers wounded, as well as a large number of troopers, but the charge of the Guard cavalry did allow their fellow reserve cavalry to break their encirclement and get back to their original positions. The French would go on to win the bloody battle of Eylau later that evening.|$|E
