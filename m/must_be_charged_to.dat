The isolated gate-electrode of the MOSFET forms a capacitor (gate capacitor), which must be charged or discharged each time the MOSFET is switched on or off.

In general, thus, the cost of Internet access (and even more so broadband access) is unaffordable by most of the population. According to the Kenyan ISPs association, high costs are also {{a consequence}} of the subjection of African ISPs to European ISPs and the lack of a clear international regulation of inter-ISP cost partition. For example, while ITU has long ratified that the cost of inter-provider telephonic connections <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>charged</b> <b>to</b> all involved providers in equal parts, in 2002 the Kenyan ISP association has denounced that all costs of Internet traffic between Europe and Africa are charged to African providers.|$|E

The Ghoshal circuit employs a series array of 400 Josephson tunnel junctions as the load on an NMOS driver. The array is formed on a silicon substrate in an aperture in the ground plane. We report calculations of the parasitic inductance and capacitance associated with the load array and their effects on the amplifier switching delay. The dominant cause of delay is the capacitance that <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>charged</b> <b>to</b> develop the output voltage. Schemes for reduction of the capacitance have been studied.

Thus determining the right mix of the segments to be opened according to the predicted demand level is a crucial element in implementing revenue management strategies. In this paper, we will try to determine the optimal segmentation mix for a hotel chain in Malaysia using dynamic programming method.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{aimed at}} assessing what environmental taxes are. It was argued clear policy guidelines for their design follow from understanding them as regulatory instruments aimed at environmental policy goals. Empirical evidence drawn from institutional practices in Denmark (waste tax), Portugal (energy tax) and Sweden (energy tax, CO 2 tax, sulphur tax and the NOx charge) showed that compliance with such guidelines, which allow {{the distinction between}} environmental taxes and environmentally-related taxes, are paramount to the environmental effectiveness of these instruments. Both environmental taxes and pollution taxes or environmentally-related taxes are raised on polluting tax bases and highlight inefficiencies in abatement and opportunities for technological progress by putting a positive price on pollution, hence raising awareness and sharing responsibility. However, they are substantially different. Their underlying normative tax design is different following the different objectives they pursue. The more environmentally targeted tax design of environmental taxes makes them perform better than pollution taxes as instruments of environmental policy, producing stronger and quicker environmental effects than environmentally-related taxes raised on the same tax bases. Environmental taxes aim only or primarily at fulfilling precise environmental objectives via behavioural change and technological progress and must be ruled by environmental criteria. Their design induces behavioural change by promoting tax awareness and tax avoidance, {{as well as by}} adopting a ‘forward looking’ approach provided by its reference to the opportunity for improvement rather than mere pollution amounts. Therefore, they must be raised on specific polluting emissions or a proxy for them. Their tax rate needs to be referred to pollution abatement costs or relative polluting impacts taking into account a specific pollutant, and be set at the level required to induce the behavioural change necessary to attain the environmental objective pursued. And they <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>charged</b> <b>to</b> polluters who control the cause sine qua non of pollution and still did not explore all their opportunities for environmental improvement...|$|E

But it is equally safe to say that if a new and successful method of treating some procedural problem were discovered in England, American lawyers as a class would remain in substantial ignorance of it for at least two generations, and would probably treat it with scornful indifference for a generation or two more. There are no state lines for progressive doctors, dentists, engineers, architects, manufacturers or business men. But not one lawyer in a hundred knows or cares what reforms are being employed by his profession on the other side of the political boundary. The American lawyer is satisfied with things as they are. As long as clients continue to come and the machinery of the law continues to move, he is as free from concern over the methods used elsewhere as the southern negro with his mule and his little plow, who never worries about tractors or other new-fangled devices. No better illustration of this can be found than the problem of joinder of causes of action. The old rules and the very foundations upon which they rested, if there really were any, have been demolished by modern reformatory legislation. Most of the restriction which the law placed upon such joinder can be shown by experience to be useless. One jurisdiction has progressed here, another there.

International audienceBiogenic polyamines, which {{play a role}} in DNA condensation and stabilization, are ubiquitous and are found at millimolar concentration in the nucleus of eukaryotic cells. The interaction modes of three polyamines-putrescine (Put), spermine (Spm), and spermidine (Spd) -with a self-complementary 16 base pair (bp) duplex, are investigated by all-atom explicit-solvent molecular dynamics. The length of the amine aliphatic chain leads to a change of the interaction mode from minor groove binding to major groove binding. Through all-atom dynamics, noncovalent interactions that stabilize the polyamine-DNA complex and prefigure the reactivity, leading to the low-barrier formation of deleterious DNA-polyamine cross-links, after one-electron oxidation of a guanine nucleobase, are unraveled. The binding strength is quantified from the obtained trajectories by molecular mechanics generalized Born surface area post-processing (MM-GBSA). The values of binding free energies provide the same affinity order, Put<Spm<Spd, as that determined by recent isothermal calorimetry measurements, with a satisfactory correlation, to validate the structural predictions. The binding modes and carbon-nitrogen distances along the series of polyamines illustrate the selectivity towards deleterious DNA-polyamine cross-link formation through the extraction of average approaching distances between the C 8 atom of guanines and the ammonium group.

The loss prevention specialist suspected Moore might attempt to purchase goods with a credit card, and instructed a cashier to contact management if Moore presented a credit card without proper identification. Moore brought over $ 300 worth of goods to the cashier’s register and presented a credit card. When Moore could not produce identification, the cashier summoned a manager who took the credit card to the loss prevention specialist for examination. The loss prevention specialist discovered that the credit card was reported stolen and detained Moore. Moore claimed to have the cardholder’s consent to use the credit card, which was not verified. Moore was subsequently arrested and charged with one count of fraudulent use of a credit card, one count of possession of a credit card without the cardholder’s consent, and one count of burglary.

50|$|Rainbow Bell Adventures is {{a typical}} side-scrolling platformer, in which either Twinbee, Winbee or Gwinbee must {{get to the end}} of a stage. All {{characters}} use their punch to attack, which can <b>be</b> <b>charged</b> <b>to</b> unleash a punch wave. They have two sets of weapons, one of them is either a short or long-ranged weapon (a hammer for Twinbee, a lasso for Winbee, and throwing rattles for Gwinbee), and the other one is a gun, which is a reference to Detana!! TwinBees cutscene, in which Twinbee is shown with two guns on each hand. All three can temporally fly in eight directions by propelling via a rocket pack that <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>charged,</b> as well as hover.|$|R
