40|$|We {{investigated}} {{a passive}} sampling-thermal desorption-GC/MS system, {{which is a}} simple sampling method and a highly sensitive analytical method, for the determination of volatile organic compounds （VOCs） in indoor air. Diffusive uptake rates of 9 compounds, carbon tetrachloride, trichloroethylene, toluene, tetrachloroethylene, ethylbenzene, <b>m,</b> <b>p-xylene,</b> o-xylene, styrene and p-dichlorobenzene, were calculated {{on the basis of}} the results of simultaneous mea-surement by passive and active sampler indoors and outdoors. Relative standard deviation（RSD） of diffusive uptake rates for these compounds were under 20 ％ except ethylbenzene, whose RSD was 27. 7 ％. These results showed the passive sampling-thermal desorption-GC/MS system can be applied to the determination of VOCs in indoor air. This method was applied to investigate the indoor VOC levels in Sapporo city in winter. Nine kinds of VOCs in indoor air were measured at 34 houses in Sapporo at the same time （February 14, 1996 ）. Indoor concentrations of VOCs except carbon tetrachloride were higher than those of outdoor air, which suggested that the emission source was in the house. The concentrations of toluene, ethylbenzene, o-xylene and <b>m,</b> <b>p-xylene</b> were significantly higher in newly built house and renovated house.

40|$|The North China Plain {{including}} Beijing {{is frequently}} suffering from serious haze days in recent years. To best recognize {{the influence of}} haze days on regional air quality, the pollution levels of deleterious gases of BTEX (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, <b>m,</b> <b>p-xylene</b> and o-xylene) and carbonyls (formaldehyde, acetaldehyde and acetone) under haze and non-haze days were contrastively investigated {{during the period of}} September 2008 -August 2010 in Beijing. In comparison with non-haze days, remarkable enhancement of BTEX and the carbonyls under haze days in winter was found, with enhancement factors of 1. 9 - 5. 7 for BTEX and of 1. 5 - 4. 2 for the carbonyls. Whereas the enhancement factors for both BTEX (1. 0 - 3. 0) and the carbonyls (1. 2 - 1. 9) under haze days in summer were relatively small. The ratios of each BTEX to CO under both haze days and non-haze days exhibited a minimal value in the afternoon, whereas maximal values for the ratios of the carbonyls to CO were usually found in the afternoon. The ratios of each BTEX to CO were extremely greater under haze days than those under non-haze days in winter, but no evident difference was found in summer. The ratios of each carbonyl under both haze days and non-haze days in summer were at least a factor of 2 greater than those in winter and only enhancement of the ratios under haze days was found in winter. The remarkably higher ratios of ethylbenzene to <b>m,</b> <b>p-xylene</b> under haze days than non-haze days in both winter and summer revealed high reactivity of photochemical reactions initiated by OH radicals under haze days.

A stainless steel flow-through environmental chamber was used to characterize the emissions rate of pollutants from office equipment. Different types of office equipment (including fax machines, laser printers, ink-jet printers, scanners, and photocopying machines) were investigated. The concentration of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), total VOC (TVOC), ozone, respirable particles (PM 10) and temperature were measured. Characterization the species of VOCs was carried out by gas chromatography-mass selective detector (GC-MSD). The highest emission rates of VOCs compounds were toluene, ethylbenzene, <b>m,</b> <b>p-xylene,</b> and styrene. Results showed that emissions of ozone and VOC from laser printers were significantly higher than that from ink-jet printers.

The physical-chemical {{properties of}} the substance (water solubility, soil organic carbon-water partition coefficient) cause high mobility and high concentrations in groundwater. Laboratory scale batch and column tests and mathematical modeling were performed to study the feasibility of a biobarrier (BB), that is an in situ permeable biological barrier with or without inoculation, for the remediation of MTBE and other gasoline-derived pollutants (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, o-xylene and <b>m</b> + <b>p-xylenes,</b> BTEXs) polluted groundwater and to estimate kinetic constants. The experimental results showed simultaneous biodegradation of MTBE and BTEXs, with similar removals in the uninoculated and the inoculated systems. Ranges for the first order kinetic removal were obtained for MTBE ((0. 18 ± 0. 02) /(0. 28 ± 0. 11 d^- 1)), B ((0. 39 ± 0. 12) /(0. 56 ± 0. 12 d^- 1)), T ((0. 51 ± 0. 03) /(0. 78 ± 0. 15 d^- 1)), E ((0. 46 ± 0. 18) /(1. 57 ± 0. 21 d^- 1)), o-X ((0. 24 ± 0. 08) /(0. 64 ± 0. 09 d^- 1)) and m + p-X ((0. 20 ± 0. 04) /(1. 21 ± 0. 04 d^- 1)).

40|$|The temp. and {{pressure}} {{dependence of the}} substrate selectivity of the alkylation of mesitylene (<b>M)</b> and <b>p-xylene</b> (X) by radiolytically formed CH 3 ClCH 3 + ions have been investigated in CH 3 Cl gas at 40 - 140 °/ 50 - 760 Torr. The Arrhenius plot of the empirical kM/kX ratio measured at 760 Torr is linear over the entire temp. range investigated, and its slope corresponds to a difference of 2. 2 ± 0. 2 kcal mol- 1 between the activation energies for the CH 3 ClCH 3 + methylation of p-xylene and mesitylene. A pressure-dependence study of the same competition reactions carried out at 100 ° points to 300 Torr as the pressure limit, below which the correspondence between the phenomenol. Arrhenius-plot slope and the actual activation-barrier difference is no longer warranted. This conclusion is further corroborated by {{a comparison of the}} present results with those derived from the same reactions from reactant ion monitoring (RIM) high-pressure mass spectrometry at 0. 5 - 1. 2 Torr. The large discrepancy obsd. is interpreted as evidence that above 300 Torr the activation mechanism of the CH 3 ClCH 3 + methylation of arenes, a typical ion-mol. process, is essentially thermal and that, below this limit, coexistence of both thermal and electrostatic activation mechanisms as well as incomplete equilibration of the internal energy of the reactants make Arrhenius plots hardly a measure of the activation barriers involved in the gas-phase arom. alkylations...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: In recent decades, high ambient ozone {{concentrations}} {{have become}} one of the major regional air quality issues in the Pearl River Delta (PRD) region. Non-methane hydrocarbons (NMHCs), as key precursors of ozone, were found to be the limiting factor in photochemical ozone formation for large areas in the PRD. For source apportioning of NMHCs as well as ozone pollution control strategies, it is necessary to obtain typical seasonal and diurnal patterns of NMHCs with a large pool of field data. To date, few studies have focused on seasonal and diurnal variations of NMHCs in urban areas of Guangzhou. This study explored the seasonal variations of most hydrocarbons concentrations with autumn maximum and spring minimum in Guangzhou. The diurnal variations of most anthropogenic NMHCs typically showed two-peak pattern with one at 8 : 00 in the morning and another at 20 : 00 in the evening, both corresponding to traffic rush hours in Guangzhou, whereas isoprene displayed a different bimodal diurnal curve. Propene, ethene, <b>m,</b> <b>p-xylene</b> and toluene were the four largest contributors to ozone formation in Guangzhou, based on the evaluation of individual NMHCs ’ photochemical reactivity. Therefore, an effective strategy for controlling ozone pollution may be achieved by the reduction of vehicle emissions in Guangzhou...|$|E
40|$|The {{automatic}} analysis {{system of}} a portable gas chromatograph {{was designed to}} measure the organic pollutants in urban air. This equipment was composed of three parts; PID-gas chromatograph unit (60 × 22 × 52 cm, 22 kg), integrator (Shimadzu CR 6 A, 8. 5 kg) and He bonbe (16 kg). Samples were automatically concentrated in the Tenax-GC glass tube by a vacuum pump, which is able to take 3 liters air for 12 minutes. After the carrier gas flowed in the absorbent glass tube, it reached suddenly to 210 ℃ within a minute. At the same time, ananalytical column (SPB- 1, Fused Silica Capillary 0. 32 mmφ× 25 m thick 1. 0 μm) was kept at 80 ℃. We investigated in terms of C_ 6 ～C_ 9 aromatic hydrocarbons (12 components), trichloroethylene, tetrachloroethylene and p-dichlorobenzene {{in order to test}} this system and knew the air pollution level in Korea. The range of each concentration was 10. 5 - 71. 5 ppb intoluene, 2. 3 - 17. 0 ppb in benzene, 3. 6 - 33. 0 ppb in <b>m,</b> <b>p-xylene</b> in Seoul, Korea.

40|$|Indoor {{air quality}} (IAQ) {{has been a}} matter of public concern in Hong Kong. Recently, the Hong Kong Government has {{recognized}} the potential risk and problems related to indoor air pollution, and it is striving to establish IAQ objectives for different types of indoor environments. This study attempts to provide more information about the present IAQ of local resident flats. Air pollutants measured in this study included carbon dioxide (CO 2), respirable suspended particulate matter (PM 10), formaldehyde (HCHO), volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and airborne bacteria. The results {{of this study indicate that}} the 8 -h average concentrations of CO 2 and PM 10 in the domestic kitchens investigated were 14 % and 67 % higher than those measured in the living rooms. The indoor air pollution caused by PM 10 was more serious in domestic kitchens than in living rooms as almost all of the kitchens investigated had higher indoor levels of PM 10. The majority of the domestic living rooms and kitchens studied had average concentrations of airborne bacteria higher than 500 CFU/m 3. The mean total bacteria count recorded in kitchens was greater than that obtained in living rooms by 23 %. In homes where occupants smoke, the negative impact of benzene, toluene and <b>m,</b> <b>p-xylene</b> on the IAQ was greatly enhanced.

40|$|As a {{requirement}} of the Murdoch University Environmental Engineering Degree, enrolment in ENG 450 Engineering Internship was undertaken by Daniel Marsh. The internship existed as a work placement at Coogee Chemicals, a chemical manufacturing, storage and distribution company located in Kwinana. Throughout the internship work was completed {{under the supervision of}} HSEQ Coordinator Shoba Senasinghe. The main focus of this internship was the design, construction and testing of a pilot scale wetland for the treatment of wastewater generated within Coogee Chemicals Kwinana Site, thus providing engineering and environmental science experience to the intern while providing Coogee Chemicals with information on the feasibility of treating wastewater using wetlands. The waste streams are characterised as containing contaminants such as BTEX (Benzene, Toluene, Ethyl-Benzene and Xylene), gasoline and diesel range hydrocarbons, detergents, solvents, caustic, ethanol and diesel. The hydrocarbons are sourced from activities such as tank dewatering, pumps and bunded areas, gantry floor wash downs and line washing. Coogee Chemicals would like to use the pilot wetland as a treatment method to test the possibility of installing a larger treatment system within the Kwinana site for the treatment of all appropriate waste streams, collectively over 5 m 3 /day of contaminated wastewater. Diesel contaminated groundwater was initially trialled followed by pond water which receives effluent from an oil-water separator. As the internship is an experimental based project, data is being continuously recorded on the performance of the treatment capabilities of the wetland systems. At the time of reporting, there are six wetland cells operating in three separate treatment streams, making three pairs. Only data for the wetland system in South 3 is analysed. Wetland performance for groundwater showed very low effluent concentrations for benzene, ethylbenzene, <b>m</b> & <b>p-xylene</b> and o-xylene with 3 ug/l, 3 ug/l, 6 ug/l and 3 ug/l respectively.

40|$|A {{total of}} fifteen {{bacteria}} from activated sludge were isolated for th eir ability to grow on aromatic substrates {{as the sole}} source of carbon and energy. They were identified {{as members of the}} genera Pseudomonas and Aeromonas. Four P. putida spp. To- 1, To- 3, To- 5, Na- 13 and one A. caviae sp. To- 4 capable of good growth on toluene were selected for fu rther study. All five bacteria were capable of growth on toluene, benzoic acid, m-toluic acid, ethylbenzene, pseudocumene, <b>m</b> - and <b>p-xylene</b> and <b>m</b> - and p -chlorophenol. A. caviae To- 4 alone was capable of growth on phenol and naphthalene. The growth of these bacteria was investigated under different cultural conditions - solid culture, liquid culture, directly added toluene and in the presence of other carbon sources. Growth was b e tter when toluene was supplied in the vapour phase. The toxic effect of directly added toluene was alleviated by the addition of a readily metabolizable carbon source and by the acclimation of the cells to toluene. Strains To- 4 and To- 5 were selected as representative strains of the genera to investigate the removal of toluene. Both of the strains behaved similarly in respect to the utilization of toluene and the utilization of toluene was dependent on the availability of toluene and oxygen. The optimum pH for growth of all the isolates in the presence of toluene was between pH 5. 8 to pH 7. 4. All five isolates showed greater meta activity thanortho activity in degrading toluene. However following growth on non-aromatic substrates the Pseudomonas spp. showed meta activity and the Aeromonassp. showed ortho activity. A large plasmid band (85 - 120 kb) was detected in all the P seudomonasspp. following growth on aromatic and non-aromatic substrates. The stra in A. caviae To- 4 did not carry any plasmid following growth on nonaromatic substrates. This stra in carried a large plasmid (85 - 120 kb) only when grown in the presence of toluene. The identification of the plasmid was confirmed by dot blot hybridization using a TOL probe. Restriction analyses of the plasmid DNA of A. caviae To- 4 and P. putida To- 5 were compared to that of the TOL plasmid of P. putida NCIB 10432 and the presence of specifi sequences of the TOL plasmid were confirmed by Southern hybridization using both a digoxigenin-labelled and a radioactively labelled probe.

40|$|El objetivo de este {{proyecto}} es el estudio de las aplicaciones de las redes neuronales en el campo de la exposición personal y su comparación con los resultados obtenidos con el método tradicional. Pare ello hemos utilizado los datos procedentes de dos estudios distintos que se han realizado. Estos estudios son el proyecto Europeo LIFE-MACBETH (1996) y el proyecto Europeo PEOPLE. Estos estudios se realizaron en varias ciudades Europeas pero para este trabajo se han recopilado los datos de la ciudad de Murcia del proyecto LIFE-MACBETH, donde se estudió la exposición personal a Benceno, Tolueno y m, p-Xilenos. Y los de la ciudad de Madrid (2003) donde se midió la concentraciones en aire ambiente y la exposición personal, de los datos que se recopilaron hemos utilizado los correspondientes a Benceno y compuestos aromáticos. El método clásico utilizado es el de regresión multivariable, que es un método estadístico que establece una relación matemática entre un conjunto de variables independientes y una variable dependiente. El procedimiento utilizado con esta regresión fue el llamado "paso a paso". Las redes neuronales ensayadas han sido: capa lineal, las dos versiones diseño y entrenamiento; Feed-forward Backprop. Cascade-forward Backprop., la base radial pura, la probabilística y la regresión generalizada y también la opción "fitting tool". Del proyecto LIFE-MACBETH pudimos concluir que: • De los métodos aceptables clásicos estadísticos fueron aquellos en donde se relacionó la concentración de exposición personal con los distintos tiempos de exposición a cada ambiente y las concentraciones de los distintos ambientes. The aim of {{this project}} is to study the applications of neural networks {{in the field of}} personal exposure and to compare the obtained results with the traditional method. For this application we used data from two different studies. These studies are the European LIFE-MACBETH project and the European PEOPLE project. These studies were performed in various European cities, but for this study, we have collected from LIFE-MACBETH project the data of the city of Murcia, where personal exposure to Benzene, Toluene and m, p-Xylenes was studied. And to the PEOPLE project the date of city of Madrid (2003) where concentrations were measured in ambient air and personal exposure. From the data collected, we used those for Benzene and aromatics. The classic method used is the multivariate regression, which is a statistical method that establishes a mathematical relationship between a set of independent variables and a dependent variable. This regression was made using a called "stepwise” procedure. The neural networks tested for this project has been the following: Linear layer, both versions design and training; Feed-forward backprop; the Cascade-forward backprop, the pure radial basis, probabilistic and generalized regression and also the option “fitting tool”. The date of the project LIFE-MACBETH several conclusions are concluded: • The classical statistical methods acceptable were those in which personal exposure concentration with different times of exposure to each environment and the concentrations of the different environments related. • Classical statistical study shows that the environments with more influence on personal exposure to the three pollutants are the time spent outdoors and at home (in all the evaluated periods). Also, during periods of weekend and leisure the influence of interiors other than homes is significant. • In case of neural network models, tested options have been considered acceptable methods for linear layer design and generalized regression in which a neural network of four neurons in parallel was designed. • In general, the error obtained with neural networks is smaller than those obtained with the conventional method, especially for Toluene and m, p-Xylenes. From the results with the data of the project PEOPLE several conclusions are concluded too. • The classic study it is deduced that the environments more influence on personal exposure to the five pollutants are time spent at work and at home; for four of the pollutants also affects the time spent in the car (except for the o-Xylene); for three of them also influences the time spent shopping (except Benzene and <b>m,</b> <b>p-Xylene).</b> For Benzene and m,p-Xylenes other relevant variable is the number of cigarettes smoked. • With all the contaminants, five neural network simulations and one with the classical statistical multivariate regression method have been made. The simulation {{for the use of the}} generalized regression network in two-step option was not acceptable because the percentage of deleted data was very high. • For all pollutants the Networks option Linear Layer Design (LLD) 1 step improves the classical method. Also Generalized Regression (GR) 2 steps shows an improvement over the classical estimates. The GR 1 step serves to refine the data, detecting outliers...|$|E
