However, 3D Realms {{did not receive}} the Quake II engine code until November 1997, and the earlier screenshots were <b>mock-ups</b> with the Quake engine that the team had made in their spare time. 3D Realms unveiled the first video footage of Duke Nukem Forever using the Quake II engine at the 1998 Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) conference. The trailer showed Duke fighting {{on the back of}} a moving truck and firefights with aliens. While critics were impressed, Broussard was not happy with the progress being made.|$|E

30|$|And {{products}} were produced from the manufactures’ viewpoints, and then sometimes failed to satisfy user requirements. Therefore, HCD using paper prototyping [3] and <b>mock-up</b> [4] became popular. However the paper prototyping and the <b>mock-up</b> were {{not suitable for}} evaluating products which had various movements, because only limited movements of product could be implemented by the paper prototyping and the <b>mock-up.</b>|$|R
5|$|Later {{that year}} he was {{assigned}} to the Manhattan Project, and moved with his family to Los Alamos, New Mexico. There he joined the Los Alamos Laboratory's Ordnance (O) Division, which was under the command of another Naval officer, Captain William S. Parsons. Initially the goal of the O Division was to design a gun-type nuclear weapon known as Thin Man. This proved to be impractical due to contamination of the reactor-bred plutonium with plutonium-240, and in February 1944, the Division switched its attention {{to the development of the}} Little Boy, a smaller device using uranium-235. Birch used unenriched uranium to create scale models and later full-scale <b>mock-ups</b> of the device.|$|E
5|$|On 1November1975, Lockheed and Northrop {{were each}} awarded $1.5-million {{contracts}} {{to proceed with}} Phase 1 of XST. During a four-month period, the two companies were each required to construct full-scale wooden <b>mock-ups,</b> which would then be evaluated at the USAF's Radar Target Scatter (RATSCAT) test facility at White Sands, New Mexico. To test the design's radar returns, Lockheed erected a $187,000 specially built pole upon which the model would be perched. In March1976, a Lockheed model {{was transferred to the}} range before being tested; the following month Lockheed was pronounced the winner because the Northrop XST had a much higher side hemisphere RCS. DARPA, having realized the progress accumulated throughout the study, urged the Northrop team to remain together. The agency would later initiate the Battlefield Surveillance Aircraft-Experimental (BSAX), which evolved into the Tacit Blue and, ultimately, the B-2 bomber.|$|E
5|$|All {{members of}} the SASR are {{parachute}} qualified, and each member of a patrol {{has at least one}} specialisation, including medic, signaller, explosive expert or linguist. Counter terrorist training includes close quarters battle (CQB), explosive entry, tubular assault (in vehicles such as in buses, trains and aircraft) and in high rise buildings, as well as room and building clearance. This training is conducted in a range of advanced facilities, including electronic indoor and outdoor CQB ranges, outdoor sniper range, and urban training facilities at Swanbourne. Additional facilities include a special urban complex, vertical plunging range, method of entry house, and simulated oil rig and aircraft <b>mock-ups</b> in order to provide realistic training environments for potential operational scenarios. Free-Fall training includes High Altitude Parachute Operations (HAPO) either High Altitude Low Opening (HALO) or High Altitude High Opening (HAHO) conducted at a maximum of 25,000 feet. SASR personnel also provide training in weapons handling to ASIS operatives at Swan Island in Victoria. Despite a possible reduction in rank, SASR operators receive significant allowances, which make them among the highest-paid soldiers in the Australian Defence Force, with a trooper (equivalent to a private) reportedly earning about $100,000 per annum in 2006.|$|E

5|$|Training {{also took}} place at Port Sunlight, where they were shown how to destroy large {{condensers}} of the kind found in the plant. The sappers were given detailed briefings on the plant and the surrounding area, and were trained on large models and <b>mock-ups</b> of the buildings that the plant was composed of, all based on {{information provided by the}} SOE agents who had arrived earlier in the month. Because the operation was considered to be extremely important, and its results vital to the Allied war effort, security efforts were extremely thorough. A cover story was provided for the sappers as they conducted their training; a rumour was spread that they were training to compete against a company of American engineers in a fictional 'Washington Cup' athletic event, which involved a long route march to be completed either by glider or parachute, followed by a complex demolition task and finally a demanding endurance test. The departure airfield was also sealed off to civilians and non-essential military personnel, and all mail and telephone calls were censored.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, NASA planned {{to launch a}} modular space station called Freedom as a {{counterpart}} to Mir, while the Soviets were planning to construct Mir-2 in the 1990s {{as a replacement for}} the station. Because of budget and design constraints, Freedom never progressed past <b>mock-ups</b> and minor component tests and, with the fall of the Soviet Union {{and the end of the}} Space Race, the project was nearly cancelled entirely by the United States House of Representatives. The post-Soviet economic chaos in Russia also led to the cancellation of Mir-2, though only after its base block, DOS-8, had been constructed. Similar budgetary difficulties were faced by other nations with space station projects, which prompted the US government to negotiate with European states, Russia, Japan, and Canada in the early 1990s to begin a collaborative project. In June 1992, American president George H. W. Bush and Russian president Boris Yeltsin agreed to cooperate on space exploration. The resulting Agreement between the United States of America and the Russian Federation Concerning Cooperation in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space for Peaceful Purposes called for a short joint space programme with one American astronaut deployed to the Russian space station Mir and two Russian cosmonauts deployed to a Space Shuttle.|$|E

40|$|The {{significance}} of the full-scale <b>mock-up</b> as a tool depends, among other things, on the type and finish of the <b>mock-up,</b> the purpose of its use and the user. The qualities of the tool effect the way it can be used. By working with {{a new group of}} users, architecture students, and by supplementing our building system with blocks we now have gained new experience. In {{the first part of this}} paper we present the projects that we carried out in teaching, partly inspired by the collaboration with EFA-members. In the second part, we try to compare this experience with our previous work with lay-people. Since the outcome of full-scale modelling means different things to these two  categories of users, it affects their relationship to the <b>mock-up.</b> A consequence of this is that the <b>mock-up</b> has to fulfil various demands and it is important to be aware of these and adjust the <b>mock-up</b> and the full-scale modelling procedure according to them...|$|R

40|$|A {{first wall}} <b>mock-up</b> {{of the design}} for the next European torus (NET) was {{available}} for experiments as a water-cooled steel structure. The <b>mock-up</b> has not been thought to become a thermal fatigue specimen because of its pre-damage by {{a large number of}} thermocouple holes. It was rather used as a prototypical background structure for thermomechanical tests of carbon-based protection tiles and their attachment schemes. In a first series of tests the bare <b>mock-up</b> was thermally loaded by a heat flux to its surface. In this case, the strains measured on its back side verified a corresponding FE model prediction reasonably. In a second series the <b>mock-up</b> was protected by a radiatively cooled tile that was not in close thermal contact with the mock-up; these tests revealed the great importance of appropriately sized gaps that allow the full differential expansion and bowing also during thermal transients. Finally, the <b>mock-up</b> was protected by conductively cooled tiles which, with an intermediate layer of flexible graphite, were pressed {{to the surface of the}} <b>mock-up.</b> The heat transfer characteristics of the compliant layer turned out to be uniform and reliable even after thermal cycles at high temperatures.
