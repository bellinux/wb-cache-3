40|$|The {{mutagenic}} {{consequences of}} damage to DNA produced by low pH and high temperature have been determined in a forward <b>mutational</b> <b>system</b> capable of detecting all classes of mutagenic events. When damaged single-stranded DNA from bacteriophage M 13 mp 2 is used to transfect competent Escherichia coli cells, a 15 -fold increase in mutation frequency, measured as loss of alpha-complementation by the lac DNA in the phage, is observed compared with an untreated DNA control transfection. The enhanced mutagenicity is largely dependent on induction of the error-prone SOS response and {{is proportional to the}} number of lethal hits introduced into the DNA. The effect is abolished by treatment of the damaged DNA before transfection with either apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease or alkali. Based on these observations and the rate constants for formation of the known heat/acid-produced lesions in DNA, it is concluded {{that the majority of the}} induced mutagenesis results from apurinic sites. DNA sequence analysis of 87 spontaneous and 124 induced mutants indicates that the major effect is on single base-substitution mutagenesis with a small increase in (deletion) frame-shift frequency. Approximately 80 % of the base-substitution mutations occur at purine positions in the viral strand, consistent with depurination as the predominant premutagenic lesion. The preference of guanine over adenine sites mutated is consistent with the preference for depurination of guanine over adenine. Transversions are observed for 57 of 79 (72 %) induced base substitutions, with a strong preference for insertion of adenine residues opposite the putative apurinic site. These data in a forward <b>mutational</b> <b>system</b> provide insight into the mechanisms used by a cell to replicate DNA containing noncoding lesions...|$|E
40|$|The {{methionine}} <b>mutational</b> <b>system</b> in Aspergillus detects prototrophic revertants {{arising from}} forward mutation {{at any of}} six different suppressor gene loci (Scott & Alderson, 1971). It has been generally assumed that every conidium containing a prototrophic nucleus will form a colony irrespective {{of the number of}} auxotrophic or prototrophic conidia on the plate. Earlier work by Grigg (I 952), on Neirrospora, using reconstruction experiments, demon-strated that when the background plating density exceeded about I x 10 ' conidialplate the number of prototrophs retrieved declined and that the conidial concentrations necessary to inhibit prototrophic colony formation varied for different auxotrophic strains. Although the numbers of conidia plated for the detection of revertants in Aspergillus are considerably less than those used by Grigg, it was thought necessary to investigate the effect of different plating densities on the retrieval of the revertants in order that an accurate determination of mutation frequencies could be obtained. The type of reconstruction experiment used by Grigg, using untreated cells, has been avoided in the present study since it seemed advisable to test for the effect of plating density under actual experimental conditions using u. v. - or 31 - i r rad i ated conidia...|$|E
40|$|We {{have used}} feline {{immunodeficiency}} virus (FIV) protease (PR) as a <b>mutational</b> <b>system</b> {{to study the}} molecular basis of substrate-inhibitor specificity for lentivirus PRs, {{with a focus on}} human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1) PR. Our previous mutagenesis studies demonstrated that discrete substitutions in the active site of FIV PR with structurally equivalent residues of HIV- 1 PR dramatically altered the specificity of the mutant PRs in in vitro analyses. Here, we have expanded these studies to analyze the specificity changes in each mutant FIV PR expressed {{in the context of the}} natural Gag-Pol polyprotein ex vivo. Expression mutants were prepared in which 4 to 12 HIV- 1 -equivalent substitutions were made in FIV PR, and cleavage of each Gag-Pol polyprotein was then assessed in pseudovirions from transduced cells. The findings demonstrated that, as with in vitro analyses, inhibitor specificities of the mutants showed increased HIV- 1 PR character when analyzed against the natural substrate. In addition, all of the mutant PRs still processed the FIV polyprotein but the apparent order of processing was altered relative to that observed with wild-type FIV PR. Given the importance of the order in which Gag-Pol is processed, these findings likely explain the failure to produce infectious FIVs bearing these mutations...|$|E

40|$|The {{delicate}} balance among cellular pathways that control mutagenic changes in DNA {{will be the}} focus of the 2012 Mutagenesis Gordon Research Conference. Mutagenesis is essential for evolution, while genetic stability maintains cellular functions in all organisms from microbes to metazoans.

40|$|Proteins {{translocated}} {{across the}} single plasma membrane of mycoplasmas (class Mollicutes) represent important components {{likely to affect}} several interactions of these wall-less microbes with their respective hosts. However, identification and functional analysis of such proteins is hampered {{by the lack of}} <b>mutational</b> <b>systems</b> in mycoplasmas and by a perceived limitation in translating recombinant mycoplasma genes containing UGA (Trp) codons in other eubacteria. Here we directly analyze a gene encoding a Mycoplasma hyorhinis protein capable of promoting its membrane translocation. It was initially detected by screening a recombinant phage genomic library with antibody from a host with M. hyorhinis-induced arthritis and was localized by Tn 5 and deletion mutations affecting expression of antigenic translational products. Sequence analysis of the isolated gene predicted a hydrophilic protein, P 101, containing three UGA codons and a putative signal peptide with an uncharacteristic cluster of positively charged amino acids near its C terminus. Nevertheless, lambda::TnphoA transposon mutagenesis of an Escherichia coli plasmid bearing the p 101 gene resulted in p 101 ::TnphoA fusions expressing products that could translocate as much as 48 kDa of the P 101 sequence (up to the first UGA codon) across the E. coli plasma membrane. Fusion proteins containing mature P 101 sequences expressed mycoplasma epitopes and were found by cell fractionation and detergent phase partitioning to be integral membrane proteins in E. coli, suggesting a lack of signal peptide cleavage in this system. Importantly, identification of P 101 by direct analysis of its export function relied neither on prior identification of the mycoplasmal product nor on complete expression of the product from the cloned mycoplasma gene...|$|R
40|$|The {{mutagenic}} {{consequences of}} damages to M 13 mp 19 RF DNA produced by singlet oxygen have been determined in a forward <b>mutational</b> <b>system</b> capable of detecting all classes of mutagenic events. When the damaged M 13 mp 19 RF DNA {{is used to}} transfect competent E. coli JM 105 cells, a 16. 6 -fold increase in mutation frequency is observed at 5 % survivors when measured as a loss of alpha-complementation. The enhanced mutagenicity {{is largely due to}} single-nucleotide substitutions, frameshift events and double-mutations. The single-nucleotide substitutions occur in the regulatory and in the structural part of the lacZ gene under the predominant form of a G:C to T:A transversion. The spectrum of mutations detected among the M 13 lacZ phages surviving the singlet oxygen treatment is totally different from those appearing spontaneously. SOS induction mediated through u. v. -irradiation of bacteria leads to an increase of the mutation frequency in the M 13 surviving to the singlet oxygen treatment. The mutation spectrum in this case is a mixture between those observed with the spontaneous mutants and the mutants induced by singlet oxygen. Lesions introduced in the M 13 mp 19 RF DNA can be partly repaired by the enzymatic machinery of the bacteria. It turns out that excision-repair and SOS repair are probably involved in the removal of these lesions by singlet oxygen...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Interferon-gamma {{is a key}} {{cytokine}} in {{the protective}} responses against intracellular pathogens. A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) located in the first intron of the human IFN-γ gene can putatively influence the secretion of cytokine with an impact on infection outcome as demonstrated for tuberculosis and other complex diseases. Our aim {{was to investigate the}} putative association of IFNG+ 874 T/A SNP with American tegumentary leishmaniasis (ATL) and also the influence of this SNP in the secretion of IFN-γ in vitro. Methods Brazilian ATL patients (78 cutaneous, CL, and 58 mucosal leishmaniasis, ML) and 609 healthy volunteers were evaluated. The genotype of + 874 region in the IFN-γ gene was carried out by Amplification Refractory <b>Mutational</b> <b>System</b> (ARMS-PCR). Leishmania -induced IFN-γ production on peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) culture supernatants was assessed by ELISA. Results There are no differences between + 874 T/A SNP frequency in cases and controls or in ML versus CL patients. Cutaneous leishmaniasis cases exhibiting AA genotype produced lower levels of IFN-γ than TA/TT genotypes. In mucosal cases, high and low IFN-γ producers were clearly demonstrated but no differences in the cytokine production was observed among the IFNG + 874 T or A carriers. Conclusion Our results suggest that + 874 T/A polymorphism was not associated with either susceptibility or severity to leishmaniasis. Despite this, IFNG + 874 T/A SNP could be involved in the pathogenesis of leishmaniasis by influencing the amount of cytokine released by CL patients, although it could not prevent disease development. On the other hand, it is possible that in ML cases, other potential polymorphic regulatory genes such as TNF-α and IL- 10 are also involved thus interfering with IFN-γ secretion. </p...|$|E
40|$|Introdução. A paracoccidioidomicose (PCM) é uma micose sistêmica crônica, endêmica na América Latina, principalmente Brasil, sendo a oitava causa de morte entre as doenças infecciosas crônicas recorrentes. A PCM infecção é caracterizada por uma resposta Th 1, a forma aguda por um perfil misto da resposta Th 2 /Th 9, enquanto na forma crônica caracteriza-se pelo perfil Th 17 /Th 22. A ocorrência e gravidade da PCM humana podem também estar associadas a fatores genéticos como os polimorfismos dos genes de citocinas. Objetivos. 1. Descrever a frequência dos polimorfismos de (SNPs) IFNG + 874 T/A, IL 12 B 3 ÚTR + 1188 A/C e IL 12 RB 1 11014 A/G no éxon 7 em pacientes e controles; 2. Investigar a associação entre esses polimorfismos e as diferentes formas clínicas da micose; 3. Verificar se há associação entre esses polimorfismos e a secreção das citocinas IFN-y, IL- 12 p 40 e IL- 12 p 70. Materiais e Métodos. 143 pacientes com PCM foram incluídos (40 com a forma aguda, 100 com a forma crônica {{multifocal}} e 17 unifocal). Critérios de inclusão: ter doença ativa (DA) comprovada por exame micológico ou histopatológico positivo ou presença de anticorpos anti-Paracoccidioides brasiliensis (>= 1 / 32 por contraimunoeletroforese) ou ter doença curada/tratada (CT) quando comprovada anteriormente pelos critérios de DA e atualmente com títulos de anticorpos estáveis e = 6 meses. Analisaram-se os SNPs IFNG pela técnica de PCR-ARMS (P̈olymerase Chain Reaction - Amplification Refractory <b>Mutational</b> <b>System)</b> ̈, IL 12 B e IL 12 RB 1 por RFLP (P̈CR-Restriction Fragment Lenght Polymorphism) ̈. Para a dosagem de citocinas foram utilizadas as técnicas de ELISA (n= 29) e CBA (C̈ytometric Bead Array;̈ n= 18), sendo considerados estatisticamente significantes, os valores de p = 1 / 32 by counterimmunoelectrophoresis) or cured/treated disease (CT) when previously proved by {{criteria of}} DA and present stable antibodies titles = 6 months in between. The SNP IFNG was analyzed by PCR-ARMS (Polymerase Chain Reaction - Amplification Refractory <b>Mutational</b> <b>System)</b> and the SNPs IL 12 B and IL 12 RB 1 by PCR-RFLP (PCR-Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism). The levels of cytokines were detected by ELISA (n= 29) and CBA (Cytometric Bead Array; n= 18) {{and values of}} p < 0. 05 for ? 2 test and Kruskal-Wallist́est, with Dunnś post-test were considered statistically significant. Results. The AA genotype of SNP IL 12 RB 1 was the most frequent in the multifocal chronic form while the AG was more frequent in men with the unifocal chronic form of PCM (p = 0. 048). On this clinical form in the comparison between genres, the AG genotype was also more frequent in men (p= 0. 009). On ethnicity, it was demonstrated statistical difference between the frequencies of genotypes and alleles of SNPs IFNG and IL 12 RB 1 (p < 0. 05). In the comparison between the clinical forms of PCM, the frequencies of genotypes and alleles of the evaluated SNPs were similar. On the levels of cytokines, for SNPs IFNG, IL 12 B and IL 12 RB 1, increased levels of cytokines were observed with PHA on the CT and CO groups compared with DA, suggesting a connection with {{the evolution of the}} disease and the previously described immunosuppression during active disease. Conclusion. There was no association between the SNPs IFNG, IL 12 B and IL 12 RB 1 and the different forms of PCM when all patients were analyzed; among men, it is suggested that the AA genotype of IL 12 RB 1 is associated with a more disseminated chronic disease. There was {{a significant difference between the}} ethnicities on SNPs IFNG and IL 12 RB 1, being the latter also associated with the chronic form in men. The increase in the number of patients in certain ethnic groups and in the unifocal clinical form of PCM might help the better understanding of these association...|$|E
40|$|We have {{measured}} {{the frequency of}} UV-induced reversions (locus plus suppressor) for the ochre alleles ade 2 – 1 and lys 2 – 1 and forward mutations (ade 2 adex double auxotrophs) in an excision-deficient strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (rad 2 – 20). For very low UV doses, both <b>mutational</b> <b>systems</b> exhibit linear induction kinetics. However, as the dose increases, a strikingly different response is observed: in the selective reversion system a transition to higher order induction kinetics occurs near 9 ergs/mm 2 (25 % survival), whereas in the nonselective forward system the mutation frequency passes through a maximum near 14 ergs/mm 2 (4. 4 % survival) and then declines. This contrast in kinetics cannot be explained in any straightforward way by current models of induced mutagenesis, which have been developed primarily {{on the basis of}} bacterial data. The bacterial models are designed to accommodate the quadratic induction kinetics that are frequently observed in these systems. We have derived a mathematical expression for mutation frequency that enables us to fit both the forward and reversion data on the assumptions that mutagenesis is basically a "single event" Poisson process, and that mutation and killing are not necessarily independent of one another. In particular, the dose-response relations are consistent with the idea that the sensitivity of the revertants is about 25 % less than that of the original cell population, whereas the sensitivity of the forward mutants is about 29 % greater than the population average. We argue that this relatively small differential sensitivity of mutant and nonmutant cells is associated with events that take place during mutation expression and clonal growth...|$|R
40|$|The {{mutagenicity}} of peroxyl radicals, important partici-pants in {{lipid peroxidation}} cascades, was investigated using a plasmid-based <b>mutational</b> assay <b>system.</b> Double-stranded pSP 189 plasmids were incubated {{with a range}} of concen-trations of the water-soluble peroxyl radical generator 2, 29 -azobis(2 -amidinopropane) hydrochloride (AAPH). Fol-lowing replication in human Ad 293 cells, the plasmids were screened for supF mutations in indicator bacteria. Exposure to peroxyl radicals caused strand nicking and a decrease in transfection efficiency, which was accompanied by a significant increase in supF mutants. Each of these effects was abolished {{in the presence of the}} water-soluble vitamin E analogue Trolox. Automated sequencing of 76 AAPH-induced mutant plasmids revealed that substitutions at G:C base pairs were the most common changes, accounting for 85. 5 % of all identified mutations. Of these, most comprised G:C→T:A transversions (53. 5 %), with lesser contributions by G:C→A:T transitions (23. 9 %) and G:C→C:G transversions (22. 5 %). Collectively, these data confirm our previous findings concerning the spectrum of mutations produced upon bacterial replication of peroxyl radical-damaged phage DNA and extend them by showing that such damage has mutagenic consequences during replication in more complex eukaryotic systems...|$|R

40|$|The {{effects of}} a newly mapped DNA repair-defective mutant, uvsI, on mutagen sensitivities and {{mutation}} were investigated. Results showed that uvsI differs {{for most of the}} investigated properties from other uvs mutants of A. nidulans which are known to belong to three different epistatic groups, "UvsF", "UvsC", and "UvsB". Most of these mutants are sterile and many of them alter mitotic recombination frequencies, while uvsI exhibits normal levels of meiotic and mitotic recombination. In addition, uvsI strains are not more sensitive than wild type to MMS (methyl methanesulfonate) to which all other uvs strains are sensitive. However, the uvsI mutant was found to be very sensitive to the killing effects of UV light and the chemical mutagen, 4 -NQO (4 -nitro-quinoline-N-oxide). In line with the distinct phenotype of uvsI, no epistatic interactions were found for this mutant with any members of the established three epistatic groups. The effects of uvsI on mutagenesis are highly specific and dependent on the <b>mutational</b> test <b>systems.</b> In the uvsI mutant, two types of forward mutation were not affected, but spontaneous and UV-induced reversion frequencies of choA 1 and pabaA 1 were significantly reduced. Specific effects were further demonstrated in reversion tests of various sC alleles originally isolated as selenate resistant mutants by treatment with EMS (ethyl methanesulfonate), which leads mainly to G:C to A:T transitions. After EMS treatment uvsI mutants showed highly reduced reversion frequencies for all these sC alleles (except one) compared to $uvs sp+$ strains. These results suggest that the uvsI mutation may be defective in AT to GC transition mutagenesis, while increasing transversion(s) from A:T base pairs. In contrast, uvsI affected the frequencies of spontaneous and UV-induced reversions for these sC alleles in a variety of ways. Thus, uvsI may well represent a fourth functional and epistatic group of DNA repair and possibly be involved in a minor mutagenic D...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Amino acid {{sequence}} {{alignment of}} phage phiC 31 integrase with the serine recombinases family revealed highly conserved regions outside the catalytic domain. Until now, no <b>system</b> <b>mutational</b> or biochemical {{studies have been}} carried out to assess the roles of these conserved residues in the recombination of phiC 31 integrase. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: To determine the functional roles of these conserved residues, a series of conserved residues were targeted by site-directed mutagenesis. Out of the 17 mutants, 11 mutants showed impaired or no recombination ability, as analyzed by recombination assay both in vivo and in vitro. Results of DNA binding activity assays showed that mutants (R 18 A, I 141 A, L 143 A,E 153 A, I 432 A and V 571 A) exhibited a great decrease in DNA binding affinity, and mutants (G 182 A/F 183 A, C 374 A, C 376 A/G 377 A, Y 393 A and V 566 A) had completely lost their ability to bind to the specific target DNA attB as compared with wild-type protein. Further analysis of mutants (R 18 A, I 141 A, L 143 A and E 153 A) synapse and cleavage showed that these mutants were blocked in recombination at the stage of strand cleavage. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: This data reveals that some of the highly conserved residues both in the N-terminus and C-terminus region of phiC 31 integrase, play vital roles in the substrate binding and cleavage. The cysteine-rich motif and the C-tail val-rich region of phiC 31 integrase may represent the major DNA binding domains of phiC 31 integrase...|$|R

The rank order of the transition metal ions correlated with the calculated binding energy between free acetate and the metal ions coordinated in a cyclam ring. Construction of AMD 3100 substituted with only a single Cu 2 + or Ni 2 + ion demonstrated {{that the increase in}} binding affinity of the metal ion substituted bicyclam is achieved through an enhanced interaction of just one of the ring <b>systems.</b> <b>Mutational</b> analysis of potential metal ion binding residues in the main ligand binding crevice of the CXCR 4 receptor showed that although binding of the bicyclam is dependent on both Asp 171 and Asp 262, the enhancing effect of the metal ion was selectively eliminated by substitution of Asp 262 located at the extracellular end of TM-VI. It is concluded that the increased binding affinity of the metal ion substituted AMD 3100 is obtained through enhanced interaction of one of the cyclam ring systems with the carboxylate group of Asp 262. It is suggested that this occurs through a strong concomitant interaction of one of the oxygen's directly with the metal ion and the other oxygen to one of the nitrogens of the cyclam ring through a hydrogen bond...|$|R
40|$|Chronic {{lymphocytic}} leukemia (CLL) is clinically heterogeneous. While some patients have indolent disease for many years, 20 - 30 % will progress and ultimately die of their disease.

However, none of these markers identify all cases of CLL at risk. In a recent review, we summarized those CD antigens known to correlate with the prognosis of CLL. The present study has identified surface profiles of CD antigens that distinguish clinically progressive CLL from slow-progressive and stable CLL. Using an extended DotScan? CLL antibody microarray (Version 3; 182 CD antibodies), and with refined analysis of purified CD 19 + B-cells, the following 27 CD antigens were differentially abundant for progressive CLL: CD 11 a, CD 11 b, CD 11 c, CD 18, CD 19, CD 20 (two epitopes), CD 21, CD 22, CD 23, CD 24, CD 25, CD 38, CD 40, CD 43, CD 45, CD 45 RA, CD 52, CD 69, CD 81, CD 84, CD 98, CD 102, CD 148, CD 180, CD 196 and CD 270.

40|$|Activation of tissue-specific genes is {{a tightly}} {{controlled}} process that normally involves the combined action of several transcription factors and transcriptional co-regulators. The bone-specific osteoca 1 cin gene (OC) {{has been used}} as a prototype to study both tissue-specific and hormonal responsiveness. In this study we have examined the role of Runx 2, VDR and C/EBP factors in the regulation of OC gene transcription. Contributions of the Runx and VDRE motifs to OC promoter activity were addressed by introducing point mutations within the context of the rat (- 1. 1 kb) osteocalcin promoter fused to a CAT-reporter gene. The functional significance of these mutations was assayed following transient transfection and after genomic integration in ROS 17 / 2. 8 osteoblastic cell lines. Furthermore, we tested the effect of these mutations on the chromatin organization of the OC promoter. Our data show that all three Runx sites are required for maximal activation of the OC promoter and that the distal sites contribute significantly to the basal activity. Strikingly, mutation of the three Runx sites abrogates responsiveness of the OC promoter to vitamin D; this loss is also observed when only the Runx sites flanking the VDRE are mutated. Chromatin changes that result in the appearance of DNase I hypersensitive sites during activation of the OC gene are well documented. Mutation of the three Runx sites results in altered chromatin structure as reflected by absence of DNase I hypersensitive sites at the vitamin D response element and over the proximal, tissue-specific basal promoter. These data are consistent with the critical role of Runx 2 in osteoblast maturation and bone development. Mutation of the VDRE resulted in a complete loss of vitamin D responsiveness; however, this mutant promoter exhibited increased basal activity. The two DNase I hypersensitive sites characteristic of the transcriptionally active OC gene in osteoblastics cells were not altered upon mutation of the VDRE element, although restriction enzyme accessibility in the proximal promoter region was decreased. We also found an increased level of histone H 3 acetylation at the VDRE mutant promoter in comparison to the endogenous gene. Thus binding of VDR to OC promoter is required to achieve a normal transcriptional regulation and chromatin structure of the OC gene. Although Runx 2 is considered a master gene for bone development and osteoblast differentiation, it is noteworthy that osteoblast-specific transcription of the rat OC promoter occurs even in the absence of Runx sites. Therefore, other transcription factor(s) should be able to drive OC expression. We characterized a C/EBP enhancer element in the proximal promoter of the rat osteoca 1 cin gene that resides in close proximity to a Runx element, essential for tissue-specific activation. We find that C/EBPβ or δ and Runx 2 factors interact together in a synergistic manner to enhance OC transcription in cell culture <b>systems.</b> <b>Mutational</b> analysis demonstrated that this synergism is mediated through the C/EBP responsive element in the OC promoter and requires a direct interaction between Runx 2 and C/EBPβ or δ. Taken together, our findings strongly support a mechanism in which combinatorial interaction of Runx 2, VDR, C/EBPβ or δ and probably other transcription factors are needed for regulating OC expression. In this process Runx factors not only act as simple transcriptional trans activators but also by facilitating modifications in promoter architecture and maintaining an active conformation of the target gene promoter...|$|R
