25|$|North Korean People's Liberation Front {{claims that}} it has support and {{contacts}} within disaffected officers of the Korean People's Army, but analysts are not convinced of this. They also claim to have contacts within the police of North Korea. Hankuk University of Foreign Studies professor Namkung Young says {{that members of the}} organization know the North Korean situation well, but they should be more realistic with their goals. Furthermore, he noted that South Korean support for the organization could increase tensions between the governments. A U.S. <b>military</b> <b>analyst</b> was unaware of any independent sources supporting the claims that the North Korean military would be discontent enough to attempt a coup.|$|E
25|$|During the Siege of Beirut, by late August 1982, Lebanese sources put {{the death}} toll in Beirut at 6,776. This figure {{included}} victims of the June 4, 1982, bombing, which occurred {{two days before the}} operation officially started. Lebanese police and international doctors serving in Beirut put the number of civilian casualties at about 80%. According to American <b>military</b> <b>analyst</b> Richard Gabriel, all factions in the conflicts agree that between 4,000 and 5,000 civilians died during the siege caused by military activity of all sides. He states that most of the observers that were present on the ground and other relevant sources in Lebanon agree that estimates of 8,000–10,000 are too high.|$|E
25|$|The 1982 Lebanon {{war began}} on 6 June 1982, when Israel invaded {{again for the}} purpose of attacking the Palestine Liberation Organization. The Israeli army laid siege to Beirut. During the conflict, {{according}} to Lebanese sources, between 15,000–20,000 people were killed, mostly civilians. According to American <b>military</b> <b>analyst</b> Richard Gabriel, between 5,000–8,000 civilians were killed. Fighting also occurred between Israel and Syria. The United States, fearing a widening conflict and the prestige the siege was giving PLO leader Yasser Arafat, got all sides to agree to a cease-fire and terms for the PLO's withdrawal on 12 August. The Multinational Force in Lebanon arrived to keep the peace and ensure PLO withdrawal. The PLO leadership retreated from Beirut on 30 August 1982 and moved to Tunisia.|$|E

25|$|In 2010, {{before the}} system was {{declared}} operational, Iron Dome was criticized by Reuven Pedatzur, a <b>military</b> <b>analyst,</b> former fighter pilot and {{professor of political science}} at Tel Aviv University for costing too much compared to the cost of a Qassam rocket (fired by Palestinian forces), so that launching very large numbers of Qassams could essentially attack Israel's financial means. The estimated cost of each Tamir interceptor missile has been cited from US$20,000–50,000 whereas a crudely manufactured Qassam rocket costs around $800 and the cost of each Hamas Grad rocket is only several thousand dollars each. Rafael responded that the cost issue was exaggerated since Iron Dome intercepts only rockets determined to constitute a threat, and that the lives saved and the strategic impact are worth the cost.|$|E
25|$|Russia's Minister of Health and Social Reform Mikhail Zurabov {{said the}} total number of people who were injured in the crisis {{exceeded}} 1,200. The exact number of people who received ambulatory assistance immediately after the crisis is not known, but is estimated to be around 700 (753 according to the UN). Moscow-based <b>military</b> <b>analyst</b> Pavel Felgenhauer concluded on 7 September 2004 that 90% of the surviving hostages had sustained injuries. At least 437 people, including 221 children, were hospitalized; 197 children were taken to the Children’s Republican Clinical Hospital in the North Ossetian capital of Vladikavkaz, and 30 were in cardiopulmonary resuscitation units in critical condition. Another 150 people were transferred to the Vladikavkaz Emergency Hospital. Sixty-two people, including 12 children, were treated in two local hospitals in Beslan, while 6 children with severe injuries were flown to Moscow for specialist treatment. The majority of the children were treated for burns, gunshot injuries, shrapnel wounds, and mutilation caused by explosions. Some had to have limbs amputated and eyes removed and many children were permanently disabled. One month after the attack, 240 people (160 of them children) were still being treated in hospitals in Vladikavkaz and in Beslan. Surviving children and parents have received psychological treatment at Vladikavkaz Rehabilitation Centre.|$|E
500|$|Russian {{military}} deception is broadly {{equated with}} maskirovka, but other terms {{are also used}} in the area, including the [...] "fog of war", tuman voyny. Khitrost means a commander's personal gift of cunning and guile, part of his military skill, whereas deception is practised by the whole organization and does not carry the sense of personal trickiness; nor need the Russian use of deception {{be thought of as}} [...] "evil". Indeed, Michael Handel reminds readers, in the preface to the <b>military</b> <b>analyst</b> David Glantz's book, of Sun Tzu's claim in The Art of War that all warfare is based on deception; Handel suggests that deception is a normal and indeed necessary part of warfare. The goal of military deception is however surprise, vnezapnost, so the two are naturally studied together.|$|E
5000|$|Whether the {{introduction}} of the personal, portable, infrared-homing surface-to-air [...] "Stinger" [...] missile in September 1986 was {{a turning point in the}} war is disputed.Many Western <b>military</b> <b>analysts</b> credit the Stinger with a kill ratio of about 70% and with responsibility for most of the over 350 Soviet or Afghan government aircraft and helicopters downed in the last two years of the war. Some <b>military</b> <b>analysts</b> considered it a [...] "game changer" [...] coined the term [...] "Stinger effect" [...] to describe it.According to US Congressman Charlie Wilson who was instrumental in funding the Stingers for the Mujahideen, before the Stinger the Mujahideen never won a set piece battle with the Soviets but after it was introduced, the Mujahideen never again lost one.|$|R

25|$|In 1882 Italy {{signed a}} {{defensive}} alliance with Austria-Hungary and Germany (see Triple Alliance).

500|$|However, the <b>military</b> <b>analyst</b> William Connor {{cautioned that}} in the Soviet sense, the {{doctrine}} covered much more than camouflage and deception. It had, he suggested, the connotation of active control of the enemy. By the time of Operation Bagration in 1944, Connor argues, the Russian doctrine of military deception already included all these aspects. The meaning evolved in Soviet practice and doctrine to include strategic, political, and diplomatic objectives, in other words operating at all levels. This differs from Western doctrines on deception, and from information warfare doctrines, by its emphasis on pragmatic aspects. According to the analyst James Hansen, deception [...] "is treated as an operational art to be polished by professors of military science and officers who specialize in this area." [...] In 2015, Julian Lindley-French described strategic maskirovka as [...] "a new level of ambition" [...] established by Moscow to unbalance the West both politically and militarily.|$|E
500|$|Before the Guterma fiasco, {{the network}} had {{maintained}} its reputation {{for running a}} strong news organization. As the conflict on the Korean peninsula began to heat up in mid-1950, Mutual started airing two special reports nightly on the situation, featuring the commentary of Major George Fielding Eliot, <b>military</b> <b>analyst</b> for CBS during World War II. By August, Mutual was represented by six correspondents in Korea, more than ABC or NBC. In June 1958, {{just a few months}} before the Scranton takeover, the network had launched a nightly 25-minute newscast, The World Today, hosted by Westbrook Van Voorhis, famous as the voice of The March of Time. On occasion, Mutual's commentary programs made the news: On March 11, 1954, Fulton Lewis Jr. featured Senator Joseph McCarthy as his guest, two days after the senator's ethics had been called into question on the TV show See It Now, hosted by Edward R. Murrow. In his radio interview, McCarthy dismissed Murrow as [...] "the extreme left-wing, bleeding-heart element of television." ...|$|E
