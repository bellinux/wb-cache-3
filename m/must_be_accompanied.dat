5|$|Although {{potentially}} fatal if eaten raw, Gyromitra esculenta {{is a popular}} delicacy in Scandinavia, Eastern Europe, and the upper Great Lakes region of North America. Although popular in some districts of the eastern Pyrenees, it is prohibited from sale {{to the public in}} Spain. It may be sold fresh in Finland, but it <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>accompanied</b> by warnings and instructions on correct preparation.|$|E
5|$|The village {{stretches}} primarily along {{a single}} carriageway road known as The Street. The north-eastern end of The Street is a designated Conservation Area. The lack of development stems from its position within the Kent Downs Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB) and a Site of Nature Conservation Interest, which influences local planning laws and limits permission to build new housing. All development is subject to {{a high level of}} scrutiny; any development that would adversely affect the natural beauty of the landscape will automatically be resisted, and large-scale development proposals <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>accompanied</b> by an environmental impact assessment. The last major development was that of the residential cul-de-sac Draysfield.|$|E

5|$|Julian offers Theo {{money to}} acquire transit papers {{for a young}} refugee named Kee, which Theo obtains from his cousin Nigel, a {{government}} minister who runs a state-sponsored collection of salvaged art from around the world. The transit papers require that the bearer <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>accompanied,</b> so Theo agrees to escort Kee {{in exchange for a}} large sum. Luke, a Fishes member, drives them and former midwife Miriam towards the coast to a boat. They are ambushed by an armed gang, and Julian is killed. Luke kills two police officers who stop their car, and they bury Julian in the forest as Theo breaks down crying over her death. The group ditches their car for another to escape to a Fishes safe house.|$|E

50|$|Adiantum jordanii is {{a carrier}} of the fungus-like oomycete, Phytophthora ramorum, which causes Sudden Oak Death. The USDA enforces an import control, {{focusing}} intensely on areas (CA, OR, NY in U.S.) that {{are infected with}} Sudden Oak death.

25|$|Criticism : To explain {{universal}} gravitation, one {{is forced}} to assume that all pulsations in the universe are in phase—which appears very implausible. In addition, the aether should be incompressible to ensure that attraction also arises at greater distances.

25|$|The {{energy content}} {{of an object}} at rest with mass m equals mc2. Conservation of energy implies that, in any reaction, a {{decrease}} of {{the sum of the}} masses of particles <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>accompanied</b> by an increase in kinetic energies of the particles after the reaction. Similarly, the mass of an object can be increased by taking in kinetic energies.|$|E
30|$|When we {{talk about}} “Vergangenheitsbewältigung”, we must {{distinguish}} between at least three different levels. The first level involves taking legal action and condemning those who committed the crimes. The second level embraces financial reparation. The recognition of guilt <b>must</b> also <b>be</b> <b>accompanied</b> by compensation. And, finally, the critical self-questioning of society and the acceptance of responsibility.|$|R
30|$|The {{connection}} of service robots to a (partly) autonomous system {{may well be}} desirable from an efficiency standpoint. However, every network leads {{to the problems of}} monopolization and dependency. The same applies to the interface between multiple systems. The formation of systems <b>must</b> therefore <b>be</b> <b>accompanied</b> by regulatory action, as is already the case in other areas of economic regulation. Hence, technology law <b>must</b> invariably <b>be</b> conceived of as economic law.|$|R

In 1840, at the synodical gathering of the newly constituted Lutheran Church in Australia, a request had been sent to the Old Lutherans in Prussia to send a second pastor to the young German settlement. A requirement had been imposed on them by the Prussian government, that they <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>accompanied</b> by a pastor before being allowed to emigrate.|$|E

25|$|The {{role of the}} {{parentheses}} in {{the definition}} {{is to ensure that}} any formula can only be obtained in one way by following the inductive definition (in other words, there is a unique parse tree for each formula). This property is known as unique readability of formulas. There are many conventions for where parentheses are used in formulas. For example, some authors use colons or full stops instead of parentheses, or change the places in which parentheses are inserted. Each author's particular definition <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>accompanied</b> by a proof of unique readability.|$|E
25|$|No {{specific}} {{mention is}} made in the procedure for amendments affecting what falls within the federal/provincial distribution of powers. Therefore, they can be dealt with generally under s. 38, or with respect to specific provinces under s. 43. However, a s. 38 amendment in that regard will not apply to a province that has passed a resolution of dissent from it, and s. 40 states that a s. 38 amendment that transfers provincial jurisdiction over an education or cultural matter to Parliament <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>accompanied</b> by reasonable compensation by Canada to the provinces.|$|E
25|$|This {{style is}} {{commonly}} found on racing bicycles with two chainrings. The relative {{step on the}} chainrings (say 35%) is typically around {{three or four times}} the relative step on the cogset (say 8% or 10%), e.g. chainrings 39-53 and close-range cogsets 12-13-14-15-16-17-19-21 or 12-13-15-17-19-21-23-25. This arrangement provides much more scope for adjusting the gear ratio to maintain a constant pedalling speed, but any change of chainring <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>accompanied</b> by a simultaneous change of 3 or 4 sprockets on the cogset if the goal is to switch to the next higher or lower gear ratio.|$|E
