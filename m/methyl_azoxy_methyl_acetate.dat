The PVDF membranes were compared to chlorinated polypropylene and polyvinyl alcohol dense membranes (developed for the same application) by pervaporation of a quaternary equimolar methyl acetate-methanol-. n-butyl acetate-. n-butanol reference feed. PVDF membranes resulted in a permeate richer in <b>methyl</b> <b>acetate</b> than the corresponding quaternary feed, and in a selectivity methyl acetate/methanol higher than one for the same mixture. Chlorinated polypropylene and polyvinyl alcohol membranes gave a permeate richer of both methanol and <b>methyl</b> <b>acetate</b> than the corresponding feed and were thus not applicable during the extensive study on the binary methyl acetate-methanol mixture. These preliminary results performances were also assessed with the Hansen solubility parameters theory, which resulted inadequate for predicting {{the behavior of the}} two glassy-state and the rubbery-state (PVDF) polymeric membranes during pervaporation. Thus, pervaporation of methyl acetate-methanol binary mixtures by PVDF membranes was studied experimentally using feed concentrations in the range 11 - 78 mol% <b>methyl</b> <b>acetate,</b> and temperatures in the range 30 - 44 °C, resulting in separation factors methyl acetate/methanol above 1 (up to 2. 1 at 11 mol% <b>methyl</b> <b>acetate</b> in the feed), in the whole feed concentration range. High total fluxes up to 35 kgm- 2 h- 1 (at 78 mol% <b>methyl</b> <b>acetate</b> and 44 °C) were also observed.

40|$|To {{support the}} {{development}} of Controlled Ecological Life Support Systems (CELSS) in the space program, a metabolic simulator has been selected {{for use in a}} closed chamber to test functions of the CELSS. This metabolic simulator is a catalytic reactor which oxidizes the <b>methyl</b> <b>acetate</b> to produce carbon dioxide and water vapor. In this project, kinetic studies of catalytic oxidation of <b>methyl</b> <b>acetate</b> were conducted using monolithic and pellet catalysts with 0. 5 % (by weight) platinum (Pt) on aluminum oxide (Al 2 O 3). The reaction was studied at a pressure of one atmosphere and at temperatures varying from 160 C to 420 C. By-products were identified at the exit of the preheater and reactor. For the kinetic study with the monolithic catalyst, a linear regression method was used to correlate the kinetic data with zero-order, first-order and Langmuir-Hinshelwood models. Results indicate that the first-order model represents the data adequately at low concentrations of <b>methyl</b> <b>acetate.</b> For higher concentrations of <b>methyl</b> <b>acetate,</b> the Langmuir-Hinshelwood model best represents the kinetic data. Both rate constant and adsorption equilibrium constants were estimated from the regression. A Taguchi orthogonal array (L(sub 9)) was used to investigate the effects of temperature, flow rate, and concentration on the catalytic oxidation of <b>methyl</b> <b>acetate.</b> For the monolithic catalyst, temperature exerts the most significant effect, followed by concentration of <b>methyl</b> <b>acetate.</b> For the pellet catalyst, reaction temperature is the most significant factor, followed by gas flow rate and <b>methyl</b> <b>acetate</b> concentration. Concentrations of either carbon dioxide or oxygen were seen to have insignificant effect on the <b>methyl</b> <b>acetate</b> conversion process. Experimental results indicate that the preheater with glass beads can accomplish thermal cracking and catalytic reaction of <b>methyl</b> <b>acetate</b> to produce acetic acid, methanol, methyl formate, and 1 -propanol. The concentration of all by-products was measured in ppmv (parts per million by volume). At higher temperatures, greater amounts of these products are produced, as expected. In all cases, methanol was the predominant concentration detected, followed by methyl formate. At temperatures lower than 320 C for the P-type monolithic catalyst, methanol, acetic acid, and acetone were detected, whereas, for the E-type monolithic catalyst, only methanol was detected at 160 C. Both P and E types of the monolithic catalyst were specified with the same substrates (ceramic), washcoat (Al 2 O 3), and promoter (Pt). However, the manufacturing and treatment procedures were quite different. It was therefore concluded that the performance of the E-type monolithic catalyst is superior to that of the P-type for oxidation of <b>methyl</b> <b>acetate.</b> At higher reaction temperatures, e. g., above 420 C, all reactants and byproducts were completely oxidized using these two types of monolithic catalyst to produce carbon dioxide and water vapor. A complex heterogenous catalytic reaction mechanism was proposed to explain the formation of the byproducts (methanol, acetic acid, and methyl formate) as the <b>methyl</b> <b>acetate</b> traveled through the preheater packed with glass beads. The by-product, 1 -propanol, may be formed only through a homogeneous reaction, since it is difficult to develop a reasonable sequence of heterogeneous reaction steps to explain its formation. The homogeneous thermal decomposition of <b>methyl</b> <b>acetate</b> to form free radicals was proposed to explain the formation of 1 -propanol, and also methanol, in the preheater. A dual-site catalytic reaction mechanism was proposed for the oxidation of <b>methyl</b> <b>acetate</b> over Pt/Al 2 O 3 monolithic catalyst. The dual-site mechanism describes the chemisorption of oxygen molecules as well as a physical adsorption of <b>methyl</b> <b>acetate</b> on the active sites. On the active sites, <b>methyl</b> <b>acetate</b> is oxidized rapidly to form carbon dioxide and water vapor. A rate equation derived from this mechanism gives the Langmuir-Hinshelwood rate formula which has been observed from the experimental data obtained in this project for high <b>methyl</b> <b>acetate</b> concentration (greater than 1000 ppmv) over a monolithic catalyst. If the oxygen concentration is very high and <b>methyl</b> <b>acetate</b> concentration is very low, the reaction rate equation is then reduced to a first-order with respect to <b>methyl</b> <b>acetate</b> concentration. The first-order model has also been observed from the experimental data obtained in this project for low <b>methyl</b> <b>acetate</b> concentration (less than 1000 ppmv) ...|$|R

The Rh-FePO 4 catalyst prepared from a mixed aqueous solution exhibits a higher rate and turnover frequency for <b>methyl</b> <b>acetate</b> formation than the Rh/FePO 4 prepared by the impregnation method. Characterizations with XRD, diffuse-reflectance UV-vis, TEM, and H- 2 -TPR suggest that Rh 3 + ions are mainly incorporated into the lattice of FePO 4 in the Rh-FePO 4 prepared from the mixed aqueous solution, whereas Rh(III) species probably exist {{on the surface of}} FePO 4 in the Rh/FePO 4 prepared by impregnation. The support of Rh(III) species and FePO 4 by MCM- 41 by a co-impregnation method can drastically increase the rate and turnover frequency for <b>methyl</b> <b>acetate</b> formation, whereas a two-step impregnation method leads to catalysts without <b>methyl</b> <b>acetate</b> formation.

40|$|The {{apparent}} molar heat capacity, phi-c, its associative part, phi-c(assoc), and {{the excess}} heat capacity, C(p) E, {{have been obtained}} at 25 -degrees-C through the concentration range for methanol, hexan- 1 -ol and decan- 1 -ol {{in a series of}} proton acceptor solvents: <b>methyl</b> <b>acetate,</b> ethyl <b>acetate,</b> octyl <b>acetate,</b> <b>methyl</b> octanoate, decyl <b>acetate</b> and <b>methyl</b> tetradecanoate. The results are explained quantitatively by the Tresczanowicz-Kehiaian (TK) association model and the Flory lattice model in terms of alcohol self-association into tetramers, characterized by an OH-OH equilibrium constant and enthalpy, and by alcohol-ester complex formation characterized by an OH-COO equilibrium constant and enthalpy, each independent of alcohol and ester chain length. As predicted, phi-c(assoc) at infinite alcohol dilution is independent of the choice of alcohol, but increases with increasing ester chain length. With increasing alcohol concentration phi-c(assoc) passes through a maximum which is much reduced compared with the inert solvent case. For each alcohol, C(p) E increases with increasing ester chain length, while for the same ester, C(p) E decreases with increasing alcohol chain length. dC(p) E/dT is positive for mixtures of methanol and <b>methyl</b> <b>acetate,</b> as predicted by the TK model. It is negative for decanol with <b>methyl</b> <b>acetate,</b> contrary to the TK model, but consistent with a non-random distribution of alcohol tetramers in the solution...|$|R
40|$|At high {{temperature}} (1 80 - 200 "C) esters, orthoesters, carbonates and orthocarbonates {{have been found}} to alkylate acidic compounds via a B,, 2 mechanism. Phenol gives anisole with <b>methyl</b> <b>acetate</b> in the presence of potassium carbonate. Thiols and other CH-acidic compounds are also alkylated under such conditions. The results obtained under batch conditions can be repeated under continuous-flow conditions, if the base which promotes the reaction can be used in catalytic amount. Continuous-flow alkylation of thiophenol by <b>methyl</b> <b>acetate</b> on a sodium acetate-type fixed bed, and other alkylations by orthoesters or orthocarbonates on a potassium carbonate catalytic bed, have been achieved...|$|R
40|$|This work is {{an excerpt}} of PhD {{dissertation}} by F. Goembira in Kyoto University who is presently affiliated to the Department of Environmental Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Andalas University, Indonesia. Supercritical <b>methyl</b> <b>acetate</b> has been proven to convert triglycerides into fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) and triacetin. Due to the low reactivity of supercritical <b>methyl</b> <b>acetate</b> on triglycerides, reaction condition of 350 °C/ 20 MPa/ 45 min is needed to obtain the highest yield of 96. 7 wt. % FAME and 8. 8 wt. % triacetin (total 105. 5 wt. %). Yet, under such condition, thermal decomposition of products is inevitable, thus, further yield increments are hard to attain. This study was, therefore, done to know the possible use of additives in increasing the reaction rate of the supercritical process. Oleic acid, acetic acid, methanol and water were evaluated as additives. It was discovered that acetic acid and water additions improved the performance of supercritical <b>methyl</b> <b>acetate</b> method. Surprisingly, when both additives were used simultaneously as aqueous acetic acid, the higher yield was obtainable at a lower reaction temperature. The addition of 10 wt. % aqueous acetic acid (25 wt. % concentration) at 300 °C/ 20 MPa/ 45 min yielded 96. 8 wt. % FAME and 12. 9 wt. % triacetin (total 109. 7 wt. %), thus, it is considered as a potential additive in biodiesel production by supercritical <b>methyl</b> <b>acetate</b> method...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{studied the}} effect of feed {{location}} of semi-batch reactive distillation via esterification reaction of acetic acid and methanol producing <b>methyl</b> <b>acetate</b> using Aspen Batch Distillation model. The reactive distillation model used was developed following a design of an in-house made reactive distillation column, which comprised of seven stages: five possible feed stages, where solid catalyst for the reaction was contained, a reboiler and a condenser. The main objectives of this semi-batch reactive distillation operation were to obtain a high yield of <b>methyl</b> <b>acetate</b> product with 95 wt% purity. In the operation, methanol was charged to the reboiler and acetic acid was fed to the column continuously at five different feed stages. From the simulation results, it showed that the feed location of acetic acid affecting on the yield and {{the purity of the}} main product at the top stage of the column. It was found that the optimum feed stage of acetic acid was at stage four giving the maximum yield and purity of <b>methyl</b> <b>acetate</b> at 74. 74 % by mole and 97. 36 wt%, respectively...|$|R
