2500|$|The first {{acrylic acid}} {{was created in}} 1843. <b>Methacrylic</b> <b>acid,</b> derived from acrylic acid, was {{formulated}} in 1865. The reaction between <b>methacrylic</b> <b>acid</b> and methanol results in the ester methyl methacrylate. Polymethyl methacrylate was discovered in the early 1930s by British chemists Rowland Hill and John Crawford at Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI) in England. ICI registered the product under the trademark Perspex. About the same time, chemist and industrialist Otto Röhm of Rohm and Haas AG in Germany attempted to produce safety glass by polymerizing methyl methacrylate between two layers of glass. The polymer separated from the glass as a clear plastic sheet, which Röhm gave the trademarked name Plexiglas in 1933. Both Perspex and Plexiglas were commercialized in the late 1930s. In the United States, E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Company (now DuPont Company) subsequently introduced its own product under the trademark Lucite. In 1936 Imperial Chemical Industries (now Lucite International) began the first commercially viable production of acrylic safety glass. During World War II both Allied and Axis forces used acrylic glass for submarine periscopes and aircraft windshields, canopies, and gun turrets. [...] Airplane pilots whose eyes were damaged by flying shards of PMMA fared much better than those injured by standard glass, demonstrating better compatibility between human tissue and PMMA than glass. Civilian applications followed after the war.|$|E

Methods: The methacrylic derivative of HA was prepared through a one-pot procedure involving the reaction with ethylenediamine (EDA) and methacrylic anhydride (MA). The obtained derivative, named HA-EDA-MA, was used to prepare photocrosslinked hydrogels loaded with a prolyl endopeptidase derived from Flavobacterium meningosepticum (PEP FM) able to detoxify gliadin.

The MAGIC-f polymer gel was irradiated under 1. 25 MeV cobalt- 60, ranging from 0 to 60 Gy in 2 -Gy steps, and received dose uniformity and accuracy of ± 2 %. After calibration of the ultrasonic systems with a frequency of 500 kHz, the parameters of ultrasound velocity and attenuation coefficient of the irradiated gel samples were measured.

Based on a 4 -order polynomial curve, fitted on the dose–response parameters of ultrasound velocity and attenuation coefficient and observed at 24 hours after irradiation, ultrasonic parameters had more sensitivity. The sensitivity of the dose–velocity and dose-attenuation coefficient curves was observed as 50 m/s/Gy and 0. 06 dB/MHz/Gy over the linear range of 4 to 44 Gy, respectively.

40|$|Background: Polymer gel {{dosimeters}} {{combined with}} {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (MRI) {{can be used for}} dose verification of advanced radiation therapy techniques. However, the uncertainty of dose map measured by gel dosimeter should be known. The {{purpose of this study is}} to investigate the uncertainty related to calibration curve and MRI protocol for MAGIC (<b>Methacrylic</b> and Ascorbic <b>acid</b> in Gelatin Initiated by Copper) gel and finally ways of optimization MRI protocol is introduced. Materials and Methods: MAGIC gel was prepared by the Fong et al. instruction. The gels were poured into calibration vials and irradiated by 18 MV photons. 1. 5 Tesla MRI was used for reading out information. Finally, uncertainty of measured dose was calculated. Results: Results show that for MAGIC polymer gel dosimeter, at low doses, the estimated uncertainty is high (≈ 18. 96 % for 1 Gy) but it reduces to approximately 4. 17 % for 10 Gy. Also, with increasing dose, the uncertainty for the measured dose decreases non-linearly. For low doses, the most significant uncertainties are σR 0 (uncertainty of intercept) and σa (uncertainty of slope) for high doses. MRI protocol parameters influence signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Conclusion: The most important source of uncertainty is uncertainty of R 2. Hence, MRI protocol and parameters therein should be optimized. At low doses, the estimated uncertainty is high and reduces by increasing dose. It is suggested that in relative dosimetry, gels are irradiated by high doses in linear range of given gel dosimeter and then scaled down to the desired dose range...|$|R
