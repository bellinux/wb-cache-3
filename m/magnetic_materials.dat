5|$|Magnetism as a {{property}} of matter {{has been known}} in China since 4000 BC. However, the first modern studies of magnetism only started {{with the development of}} electrodynamics by Faraday, Maxwell and others in the nineteenth century, which included classifying materials as ferromagnetic, paramagnetic and diamagnetic based on their response to magnetization. Pierre Curie studied the dependence of magnetization on temperature and discovered the Curie point phase transition in ferromagnetic materials. In 1906, Pierre Weiss introduced the concept of magnetic domains to explain the main properties of ferromagnets. The first attempt at a microscopic description of magnetism was by Wilhelm Lenz and Ernst Ising through the Ising model that described <b>magnetic</b> <b>materials</b> as consisting of a periodic lattice of spins that collectively acquired magnetization. The Ising model was solved exactly to show that spontaneous magnetization cannot occur in one dimension but is possible in higher-dimensional lattices. Further research such as by Bloch on spin waves and Néel on antiferromagnetism led to developing new <b>magnetic</b> <b>materials</b> with applications to magnetic storage devices.|$|E
5|$|Magnetometers detect minute {{deviations}} in the Earth's {{magnetic field}} caused by iron artifacts, kilns, {{some types of}} stone structures, and even ditches and middens in archaeological geophysics. Using magnetic instruments adapted from airborne magnetic anomaly detectors developed during World War II to detect submarines, the magnetic variations across the ocean floor have been mapped. Basalt — the iron-rich, volcanic rock making up the ocean floor — contains a strongly magnetic mineral (magnetite) and can locally distort compass readings. The distortion was recognized by Icelandic mariners {{as early as the}} late 18th century. More important, because the presence of magnetite gives the basalt measurable magnetic properties, these magnetic variations have provided another means to study the deep ocean floor. When newly formed rock cools, such <b>magnetic</b> <b>materials</b> record the Earth's magnetic field.|$|E

For pure hard magnetic grains in high density media with an average diameter of 5 nm and a height of 10 nm the switching probability is not sufficiently high for the use in bit-patterned media. Using a bilayer structure with 50 % hard <b>magnetic</b> <b>material</b> with low Curie temperature and 50 % soft <b>magnetic</b> <b>material</b> with high Curie temperature to obtain more than 99. 2 % switching probability, leads to very large jitter. We propose an optimized material composition to reach a switching probability of P_switch> 99. 2 % and simultaneously achieve the narrow transition jitter of pure hard <b>magnetic</b> <b>material.</b> Simulations with a continuous laser spot were performed with the atomistic simulation program VAMPIRE for a single cylindrical recording grain with a diameter of 5 nm and a height of 10 nm.

30|$|Magnetite {{or other}} <b>magnetic</b> <b>material</b> {{is used by}} the steel {{industry}} for cleaning coal prior to combustion. One potential source of magnetite is CFA which can contains economically recoverable amounts of <b>magnetic</b> <b>material.</b> After removal of <b>magnetic</b> <b>material</b> from CFA, the remaining product can be useful for refractory and ceramic manufacturing since it contains appreciable amounts of Al 2 O 3 and SiO 2 (Rao et al. 1999). The characteristics of <b>magnetic</b> <b>material</b> in CFA vary depending on the coal source and operating conditions of the coal boiler (Zyryanov et al. 2011). The basic principle behind magnetic separation deals with the fact that <b>materials</b> having different <b>magnetic</b> moments experience varying forces {{in the presence of a}} magnetic field gradient.

25|$|Induction heating is a {{non-contact}} {{process which}} uses {{the principle of}} electromagnetic induction to produce heat in a workpiece.

As a result, red imported fire ants can destroy electrical equipment. This is known as magnetism, where scientists have identified internal <b>magnetic</b> <b>materials</b> which {{may play a role}} in orientation behaviours. They are known to chew through electrical insulation which causes damage to electric motors, irrigation lines, pumps, signal boxes, transformers, telephone exchanges, and other equipment.

25|$|Lifshitz' {{result was}} {{subsequently}} generalized to arbitrary multilayer planar geometries {{as well as}} to anisotropic and <b>magnetic</b> <b>materials,</b> but for several decades the calculation of Casimir forces for non-planar geometries remained limited to a few idealized cases admitting analytical solutions.

However, in the 2000s a number of authors developed and demonstrated a variety of numerical techniques, in many cases adapted from classical computational electromagnetics, that are capable of accurately calculating Casimir forces for arbitrary geometries and materials, from simple finite-size effects of finite plates to more complicated phenomena arising for patterned surfaces or objects of various shapes.|$|E

Prestressed concrete has been increasingly used for the material of the tower, but still, requires much reinforcing steel to meet the strength requirement of the turbine.

Reliance on rare earth minerals for components has risked expense and price volatility as China has been main producer of rare earth minerals (96% in 2009) and had been reducing its export quotas of these materials. In recent years, however, other producers have increased production of rare earth minerals and China has removed its reduced export quota on rare earths leading to an increased supply and decreased cost of rare earth minerals, increasing the viability of the implementation of variable speed generators in wind turbines on a large scale.|$|E
