5|$|The {{suggestion}} that her building had been sped up by using guns and/or turrets originally {{designed for the}} s which preceded her is not borne out as the guns and turrets were not ordered until July 1905. It seems <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> Dreadnoughts turrets and guns merely received higher priority {{than those of the}} earlier ships.|$|E
5|$|Today, the American record {{industry}} defines Latin music as {{any type of}} release with lyrics mostly in Spanish. Mainstream artists and producers tend to feature more on songs from Latin artists and it's also become <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> English language songs crossover to Spanish radio and vice versa.|$|E

5000|$|Bill Gates {{considers}} the book {{one of the}} most important books he's ever read, and on the BBC program Desert Island Discs he selected the book as the one he would take with him to a deserted island. He has written that [...] "Steven Pinker shows us ways we can make those positive trajectories a little <b>more</b> <b>likely.</b> <b>That's</b> a contribution, not just to historical scholarship, but to the world." ...|$|R
5|$|A Roman by birth, Honorius {{may have}} been one of those chosen by Pope Gregory the Great for the Gregorian mission to England, {{although}} it seems <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> {{he was a member of}} the second party of missionaries, sent in 601. It is not known if his name was given to him at birth or if he chose it when he became archbishop.|$|E
5|$|A {{diagnosis}} of hypothyroidism without any lumps or masses felt within the thyroid gland {{does not require}} thyroid imaging; however, if the thyroid feels abnormal, diagnostic imaging is then recommended. The presence of antibodies against thyroid peroxidase (TPO) makes it <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> thyroid nodules are caused by autoimmune thyroiditis, {{but if there is}} any doubt, a needle biopsy may be required.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{international}} breed associations have been testing the F94L status of cattle registered in their herd books. The absence of F94L genes in some tested cattle {{might be a}} result of a sire or dam ancestor that had double muscling (MH) genes, or <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> the myostatin gene was the normal or wild type variant found most commonly in beef cattle. In the latter case, loss of the F94L variant will arise when grading up to purebred when base animals are not Limousins.|$|E

50|$|After Civello's {{death in}} 1970, the FBI listed the Dallas Family as inactive. It is <b>more</b> <b>likely,</b> however, <b>that</b> {{longtime}} Dallas capo Joseph Ianni assumed leadership after Civello's death.|$|R

5|$|Although Sarah {{implied that}} she had {{encouraged}} the escape {{for the safety of}} Princess Anne, it is <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> she was protecting herself and her husband. If James succeeded in defeating Prince William of Orange in battle he might imprison and even execute Lord and Lady Churchill for treason, whereas it was unlikely he would condemn his daughter to a similar fate. But James fled to France in December 1688 rather than confront the invading army, allowing William to take over his throne.|$|E
5|$|Due to its location, the Church of St Peter {{is often}} {{described}} as a cemetery church. However, scholar Bistra Nikolova considers it improbable that an ordinary village cemetery church would have an inscription by a Bulgarian tsar. In her opinion, it is <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> the church was constructed by a noble person related to the court of the Second Bulgarian Empire.|$|E
5|$|In early 348 BC, the Athenians were {{distracted by}} events on Euboea, {{and were in}} no {{position}} to send much help to Olynthos. However, the expedition the Athenians sent to Euboea to try to maintain their position on the island was a disaster, and the Athenians had to seek peace with Chalcis, thereby effectively losing control of the island. It is possible that Philip actually incited the revolt on Euboea, though it considered <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> this is a misreading of a speech of the Athenian politician Aeschines.|$|E

50|$|<b>More</b> <b>likely</b> is <b>that</b> he {{revived the}} club around 1905 {{when he was}} a maths teacher and was a key driver in the club being {{accepted}} into the Scottish Rugby Union in 1911.|$|R
5|$|It {{was later}} {{claimed by the}} Nazis that Wessel also wrote the music to the song, but it was {{considered}} <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> the tune was in reality adapted from a World War I German Imperial Navy song, and was probably originally a folk song. The authorship of the melody was finally determined by a German court in 1937 as not by Wessel.|$|E
5|$|Moorman {{suggests}} that Lucy may represent Wordsworth's romantic interest Mary Hutchinson, but wonders {{why she would}} be represented as one who died. It is possible that Wordsworth was thinking of Margaret Hutchinson, Mary's sister who had died. There is no evidence, however, that the poet loved any of the Hutchinsons other than Mary. It is <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> Margaret's death influenced but is not the foundation for Lucy.|$|E
5|$|Paulinus' missionary {{efforts are}} {{difficult}} to evaluate. Bede implies that the mission in Northumbria was successful, {{but there is little}} supporting evidence, and it is <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> Paulinus' missionary efforts there were relatively ineffectual. Although Osric, one of Edwin's successors, was converted to Christianity by Paulinus, he returned to paganism after Edwin's death. Hilda, however, remained a Christian, and eventually went on to become abbess of the influential Whitby Abbey. Northumbria's conversion to Christianity was mainly achieved by Irish missionaries brought into the region by Edwin's eventual successor, Oswald.|$|E

5|$|The army of {{the early}} Republic {{continued}} to evolve, and {{although there was a}} tendency among Romans to attribute such changes to great reformers, it is <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> changes were the product of slow evolution rather than singular and deliberate policy of reform. The manipular formation was probably copied from Rome's Samnite enemies to the south, perhaps as a result of Roman defeats in the Second Samnite War.|$|E
5|$|The {{historian}} Guy Halsall {{argues that}} as Ælle immediately preceded the late sixth-century King Ceawlin as Bretwalda, {{it is far}} <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> Ælle dates to the mid sixth century, and that the Chronicle has moved his dates back a century {{in order to provide}} a foundation myth for Sussex which puts it chronologically and geographically between the origins of the kingdoms of Kent and Wessex.|$|E
5|$|Writing in the Handbook of Texas, {{historian}} Thomas Ricks Lindley {{maintains that}} the Wagner cannon does not match the Smithwick account. The Wagner gun is made of iron and is smaller than a six-pounder. Historians such as Lindley think it <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> the Gonzales cannon was taken to San Antonio de Béxar, where it was used during the Battle of the Alamo and captured by Mexican troops in March 1836. It was likely melted down {{with many of the}} other cannons when the Mexican army retreated.|$|E

5|$|Afonso III of Portugal was not {{the eldest}} son, {{therefore}} heraldic practices stated he should not take his father's arms without adding a personal variation. Before becoming king, Afonso was married to Matilda II of Boulogne but her inability to provide him with a royal heir led Afonso to divorce her, in 1253. He then married Beatrice of Castile, an illegitimate daughter of Alfonso X of Castile. It is <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> it was this family connection with Castile (his mother was also Castilian) that justified the new heraldic addition to the royal arms—a red bordure charged with an undetermined number of yellow castles—rather than the definitive conquest of the Algarve and its Moorish fortresses, considering {{that the number of}} castles was only fixed in the late 16th century.|$|E
5|$|Al-Mu'tadid {{died at the}} Hasani palace on 5 April 902, at the age {{of either}} 40 or 47. There were rumours that he had been poisoned, but it is <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> the rigours of his campaigns, coupled with his dissolute life, {{severely}} weakened his health. During his final illness, he refused to follow the advice of his physicians, and even kicked one of them to death. He left behind him four sons and several daughters. Al-Mu'tadid was the first Abbasid caliph to be buried within the walls of Baghdad. Like his sons after him, he was buried in the former Tahirid palace {{in the western part of}} the city, which was now used by the caliphs as a secondary residence.|$|E
5|$|Alexius Slav's {{marriage}} to the daughter of Latin Emperor Henry of Flanders in 1209 was potentially a great danger to Boril, who could be facing their joint forces. Fearing such a coalition, Boril approached Strez, {{who was at the}} time gaining more power and was close to complete independence from Serbia. Strez agreed to a union with his former enemy, though only after Boril reconfirmed his complete autonomy. Strez eliminated the remaining Serbian troops in his lands in an act that the Serbs saw as devil-inspired treason. It is not impossible that Boril persuaded Strez through military action, though it is <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> the union was achieved through negotiations.|$|E
