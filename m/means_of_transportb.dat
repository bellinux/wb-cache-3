The {{aim of this}} study was to evaluate the relationship between OSAHS and dorsal AHI in order to improve early diagnosis of dorsal sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome.

50|$|However, {{production}} {{not only}} involves labor, but also certain <b>means</b> <b>of</b> labor: tools, materials, {{power plants and}} so on. These <b>means</b> <b>of</b> labor—also known as <b>means</b> <b>of</b> production—are often the product of another labor process as well. So the labor process inevitably involves these <b>means</b> <b>of</b> production that already enter the process {{with a certain amount}} of value. Labor also requires other <b>means</b> <b>of</b> production that are not produced with labor and therefore bear no value: such as sunlight, air, uncultivated land, unextracted minerals, etc. While useful, even crucial to the production process, these bring no value to that process. In terms <b>of</b> <b>means</b> <b>of</b> production resulting from another labor process, LTV treats the magnitude of value <b>of</b> these produced <b>means</b> <b>of</b> production as constant throughout the labor process. Due to the constancy of their value, these <b>means</b> <b>of</b> production are referred to, in this light, as constant capital.|$|R
