40|$|International audienceHumanoid robots are {{commonly}} {{required to make}} contacts with the environment in order to perform various tasks. For tasks such as walking, sudden establishment and breaking of contacts are unavoidable. Such behaviours may result in large changes in actuator torques (lashing), leading to potential control instability and damage to the actuators. In this paper, an approach to minimise sudden changes in actuation torques is proposed. This is achieved using Model Predictive Control (MPC) to modify the <b>maximum</b> and <b>minimum</b> <b>allowable</b> forces for a reactive whole-body controller. The MPC previews the evolution of contacts in time and generates smoother <b>maximum</b> and <b>minimum</b> <b>allowable</b> forces. The effect of the proposed approach is simulated for different scenarios on the iCub robot, such as standing up from a sitting posture and the lifting and lowering of a foot while standing.

40|$|This paper {{explains}} about methodology framework {{development for}} integrated process design and control (IPDC) of heat exchanger network (HEN). In {{most of the}} IPDC HEN problems, the feasible {{solutions to the problems}} may lie in a relatively small portion of the search space due to the large number of variables and constraints involved. The ability to solve such problems depends on the effectiveness of the method of solution in identifying and locating the feasible solutions. Hence, one approach to solve this IPDC HEN problem is to apply a decomposition method. The method starts with defining the IPDC HEN problems and formulated as a mathematical programming. The IPDC HEN problem is decomposed into four hierarchical sequential stages: (i) target selection, (ii) HEN design analysis, (iii) controllability analysis, and (iv) optimal selection and verification. This method simultaneously combines the solution for both process design and process control problem by selecting a manipulated variable that represent both process design and process control which is <b>minimum</b> <b>allowable</b> <b>temperature</b> difference, ΔTmin. The decision on selection ΔTmin are guided by a new propose Trade-off plot that combine process design criteria and steady state process control criteria.

40|$|AbstractThe Oxy-combustion {{method of}} CO 2 capture is {{considered}} to have several advantages over other methods for CO 2 capture from coal based power plants. The capture process is energy intensive and hence expensive. Heat integration is often recommended to recover part of the energy expended in the capture process. In this study, pinch analysis {{is used as a}} tool to integrate heat from the CO 2 capture process into the steam cycle of the power plant. This way of heat integration provides an opportunity to make better use of the available low grade heat at the power plant premises by approaching the <b>minimum</b> <b>allowable</b> <b>temperature</b> difference between the hot and the cold streams. This ultimately results in a better overall efficiency by generating additional power for the same fuel input and also by reducing the consumption of cooling required in the capture process. The resulting steam cycle will be a custom design for oxy-combustion coal based power plants and will be tightly integrated with the capture process. As this method brings a lot of changes to the steam cycle configuration, this is best suited for new power plants rather than retrofit of existing plants. Results show that the Pinch method of heat integration achieves better overall thermal efficiency compared to the conventional method of steam cycle design and heat integration. A techno-economic is however required to justify the efficiency gains achieved. Further work will be done later to optimize some of the simulation assumptions and to arrive at the network design...|$|R

30|$|This {{paper has}} {{introduced}} a new framework of mean-entropy-skewness portfolio selection problem with transaction cost under the constrains on short-and long-term returns with transaction costs, dividends, number of assets in the portfolio, and the <b>maximum</b> and <b>minimum</b> <b>allowable</b> capital invested in stocks. Uncertainties of future return of stocks are characterized by uncertain variables. The efficiency of the portfolios is evaluated by looking for risk contraction {{on one hand and}} expected return and skewness augmentation on the other hand. An empirical application has served to illustrate the computational tractability of the approach and the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. A comparative study with other relevant literatures proves the usefulness of the proposed model. In addition to the GA, some other meta-heuristic algorithms such as tabu search, simulated annealing, ant colony optimization, and particle swam optimization may be employed to solve the nonlinear programming problem.|$|R

The model in the uncertain environment is formulated as a nonlinear programming model based on uncertainty theory. Also, some other criteria like short-and long-term returns, dividends, number of assets in the portfolio, and the <b>maximum</b> and <b>minimum</b> <b>allowable</b> capital invested in stocks of any company are considered. Since there is no efficient solution methodology to solve the proposed model, assuming the returns as some special uncertain variables, the original portfolio selection model is transformed into an equivalent deterministic model, which can be solved by any state-of-the-art solution methodology.|$|R

The present work aims at sizing a small-scale organic Rankine cycle unit by tailoring its de-sign for domestic solar applications. Stringent design criteria, i. e., compactness, high performance and safe operation, are targeted by adopting a multi-objective optimization approach modeled with the genetic algorithm. Design-point thermo-dynamic variables, e. g., evaporating pressure, the working fluid, minimum al-lowable temperature differences, and the equipment geometry, are the decision variables. Flat plate heat exchangers with herringbone corrugations are selected as heat transfer equipment for the preheater, the evaporator and the condenser. The results unveil the hyperbolic trend binding the net power output to the heat exchanger compactness. Findings also suggest that the evaporator and condens-er <b>minimum</b> <b>allowable</b> <b>temperature</b> differences have the largest impact on the system volume and on the cycle performances.

To solve the proposed optimization problem, we provide a genetic algorithm in the ‘Genetic algorithm’ section. In the ‘Case study: Bombay Stock Exchange’ section, a case study from Bombay Stock Exchange is done to illustrate the method.

40|$|AbstractIn {{portfolio}} selection problem, {{the expected}} return, risk, liquidity etc. cannot be predicted precisely. The investor generally makes his portfolio decision {{according to his}} experience and his economic wisdom. So, deterministic portfolio selection {{is not a good}} choice for the investor. In most of the recent works on this problem, fuzzy set theory is widely used to model the problem in uncertain environments. This paper utilizes the concept of interval numbers in fuzzy set theory to extend the classical mean–variance (MV) portfolio selection model into mean–variance–skewness (MVS) model with consideration of transaction cost. In addition, some other criteria like short and long term returns, liquidity, dividends, number of assets in the portfolio and the <b>maximum</b> and <b>minimum</b> <b>allowable</b> capital invested in stocks of any selected company are considered. Three different models have been proposed by defining the future financial market optimistically, pessimistically and in the combined form to model the fuzzy MVS portfolio selection problem. In order to solve the models, fuzzy simulation (FS) and elitist genetic algorithm (EGA) are integrated to produce a more powerful and effective hybrid intelligence algorithm (HIA).

40|$|In {{practical}} applications of area-to-point spatial interpolation, inequality constraints, such as non-negativity, or more general {{constraints on the}} <b>maximum</b> and/or <b>minimum</b> <b>allowable</b> value of the resulting predictions, {{should be taken into}} account. The geostatistical framework pro-posed in this paper deals with area-to-point interpolation problems under such constraints, while: (i) explicitly accounting for support differences between sample data and unknown values, (ii) guaranteeing coherent predictions, and (iii) providing a measure of reliability for the resulting predictions. The analogy between the dual form of area-to-point interpolation and a spline allows to solve constrained area-to-point interpolation problems via a constrained quadratic minimization algorithm, after accounting for the following three issues: (i) equality and inequality constraints could be applied to different supports, and such support differences should be considered explicitly in the problem formulation, (ii) if inequality constraints are enforced on the entire set of points discretizing the areal data, it is impossible to obtain a so-lution of the quadratic programming problem, and (iii) the uniqueness and existence of the solution has to be diagnosed. In this work, stable and efficient computation of point predic-tions is achieved through the following two steps: (i) initial prediction at all locations via unconstrained area-to-point interpolation, and (ii) constrained area-to-point interpolation with inequality information only at those points whose initial predicted values violate the inequality constraints. Last, the application of the proposed method to area-to-point spatial interpola-tion with inequality constraints in one and two dimensions is demonstrated using realistically simulated data. ...|$|R

40|$|Coding schemes {{have been}} {{designed}} and investigated specifically for optical and electronic data-communication channels in which information is conveyed via pulse-position modulation (PPM) subject to dead-time constraints. These schemes involve the use of error-correcting codes concatenated with codes denoted constrained codes. These codes are decoded using an interactive method. In pulse-position modulation, time is partitioned into frames of Mslots of equal duration. Each frame contains one pulsed slot (all others are non-pulsed). For a given channel, the dead-time constraints are defined as a <b>maximum</b> and a <b>minimum</b> on the <b>allowable</b> time between pulses. For example, if a Q-switched laser is used to transmit the pulses, then the <b>minimum</b> <b>allowable</b> dead time is {{the time needed to}} recharge the laser for the next pulse. In the case of bits recorded on a magnetic medium, the <b>minimum</b> <b>allowable</b> time between pulses depends on the recording/playback speed and the minimum distance between pulses needed to prevent interference between adjacent bits during readout. The maximum allowable dead time for a given channel is the maximum time for which it is possible to satisfy the requirement to synchronize slots. In mathematical shorthand, the dead-time constraints for a given channel are represented by the pair of integers (d,k), where d is the <b>minimum</b> <b>allowable</b> number of zeroes between ones and k is the maximum allowable number of zeroes between ones. A system of the type to which the present schemes apply is represented by a binary- input, real-valued-output channel model illustrated in the figure.
