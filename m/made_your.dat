500|$|The band began {{recording}} {{in spring}} 2008 at Outhouse Studios in Reading, Berkshire {{over the course}} of two weeks. Matt O'Grady and John Mitchell handled producer duties, with Mitchell also mixing the proceedings, while Tim Turan mastered the album. [...] "Save It for the Bedroom" [...] and [...] "You've <b>Made</b> <b>Your</b> Bed (So Sleep in It)", which were initially released as a single in 2007, were re-recorded during the album's studio sessions. Franceschi's sister Elissa provided additional vocals on [...] "Always Attract".|$|E
500|$|The news {{left him}} [...] "a zombie {{for about six}} months." [...] Even before the breakup, he had {{returned}} to school at Seton Hall University in early 1989. The band breakup occurred during his second semester at Seton Hall, {{on his way to}} completing the remaining 21 credits needed to obtain his bachelor's degree in communications. He graduated from there later in 1989. He then briefly attended Yeshiva University's Cardozo School of Law, but withdrew after six weeks. Weinberg asked Ringo Starr for advice on how to go on when the band that had <b>made</b> <b>your</b> life had broken up. Weinberg and Springsteen remained on friendly terms during this period.|$|E
500|$|According to Long, [...] "Saddlesore Galactica" [...] is {{considered}} by many critics and fans as one of the worst episodes {{in the history of the}} show, particularly for the scenes featuring the jockey elves. In 2007, Maclean's writer Marco Ursi named it his least favorite episode of The Simpsons, elaborating: [...] "This is the one where the Simpsons get a horse – again – and the plot devolves into something involving the secret land of the jockeys. Making meta-references to the fact you’ve just <b>made</b> <b>your</b> 'worst episode ever' doesn’t make it any funnier." [...] Nancy Basile of About.com listed the episode as one of the worst episodes of the season—one of the episodes that made her [...] "cringe because they included blatant gimmicks and outlandish plots".|$|E

500|$|Elvis Costello and Brian Eno's track, [...] "My Dark Life", {{came about}} {{as a result of}} album {{producer}} David Was asking Costello to provide a song that would sound like [...] "'you went into the studio with Brian Eno"—the two musicians had recently met at a film screening at Paul McCartney's home, and reconvened to record the song the following week. R.E.M. and author William S. Burroughs collaborated on a new version of [...] "Star Me Kitten", a song that had originally appeared on the band's 1992 album Automatic for the People. Rob Zombie has described his collaboration with Alice Cooper on the song [...] "Hands of Death (Burn Baby Burn)" [...] as one of the [...] "great moments where you really feel like you've <b>made</b> <b>your</b> dreams come true". Zombie and Cooper were nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance in 1997 for the song, losing out to Rage Against the Machine's [...] "Tire Me".|$|E
500|$|Hull was {{remembered by}} his comrades as an {{exceptional}} pilot and an affable, jovial personality. Jimmy Beedle, in his 1966 history of No.43 Squadron, called Hull {{one of its}} all-time great characters, citing him as {{a major factor in}} the squadron's [...] "high standard of flying and... outstanding squadron spirit". John Simpson, who joined the unit as a pilot officer two months after Hull, recalled finding [...] "a confidence when flying with Caesar that was wholly lacking otherwise." [...] "I have never seen anyone who could throw a fighter about with so much confidence as old Caesar," [...] said another pilot, quoted by Beedle. [...] "Nobody gave me so much confidence to have a lead from, nobody gave me so much exhilaration and fun. Following Caesar you found yourself getting more out of your machine than you had ever imagined was possible, doing things that done by yourself would have <b>made</b> <b>your</b> hair stand on end." ...|$|E
500|$|You Me at Six went on {{tour with}} Elliot Minor, during which both bands {{released}} singles. [...] "Save It for the Bedroom" [...] {{was released on}} 22 October 2007 through Slam Dunk Records, a label co-founded by the band with help from their manager and fans. The single featured [...] "You've <b>Made</b> <b>Your</b> Made (So Sleep in It)" [...] as the B-side, and both tracks would later appear on Take Off Your Colours. A music video for [...] "Save It for the Bedroom" [...] had been released a few days prior and was directed by Lawrence Hardy. The band's release sold more copies than Elliot Minor's single, which was released through a major label. This situation {{made it clear to}} the band that, according to Franceschi, [...] "major labels are good but over the years they have totally lost touch of what sells." [...] By this time, the group was in discussion with a range of independent and major labels.|$|E

500|$|Critical {{reaction}} to the album's lyrical content was mixed. Thom Jurek of Allmusic felt the [...] "dark, unrelentingly twisted-as-fuck lyrics reflect a singular intensity," [...] and praised the band for connecting their anti-religion stance with a belief that religion has underscored many wars throughout history. However, Rolling Stones Chris Steffen mourned that it had become [...] "downright painful to hear Tom Araya — at 45 years old! — continue to belt out the band's increasingly self-parodying, anti-religious lyrics," [...] and singled out lyrics such as [...] "Religion's a whore" [...] and [...] "I've made my choice: six six six!" [...] as over the top. Jamie Thomson of The Guardian wrote that the album left [...] "no blasphemy... unuttered", while Peter Atkinson of KNAC.com observed that [...] "when not fixating on religion, the band revisit their other favorite subject — war — in surprisingly familiar terms," [...] and remarked that Slayer had sunk [...] "to the level of God-repelling dunderheads Deicide." [...] He concluded the review with the opinion that [...] "It's déjà {{vu all over again}} from God Hates Us All — and once you've titled something God Hates Us All, haven't you <b>made</b> <b>your</b> point enough already?" ...|$|E
500|$|Martin's first {{recording}} {{session with}} the Beatles took place at EMI's Abbey Road Studios in London on 6 June 1962. Martin immediately complained to Epstein about Best's poor drumming and suggested they use a session drummer in his place. Already contemplating Best's dismissal, the Beatles replaced him in mid-August with Ringo Starr, who left Rory Storm and the Hurricanes to join them. A 4 September session at EMI yielded a recording of [...] "Love Me Do" [...] featuring Starr on drums, but a dissatisfied Martin hired drummer Andy White for the band's third session a week later, which produced recordings of [...] "Love Me Do", [...] "Please Please Me" [...] and [...] "P.S. I Love You". Martin initially selected the Starr version of [...] "Love Me Do" [...] for the band's first single, though subsequent re-pressings featured the White version, with Starr on tambourine. Released in early October, [...] "Love Me Do" [...] peaked at number seventeen on the Record Retailer chart. Their television debut came later that month with a live performance on the regional news programme People and Places. After Martin suggested rerecording [...] "Please Please Me" [...] at a faster tempo, a studio session in late November yielded that recording, of which Martin accurately predicted, [...] "You've just <b>made</b> <b>your</b> first No.1." ...|$|E
500|$|The Beatles' second {{recording}} {{session with}} Martin was on 4 September 1962, when they recorded [...] "How Do You Do It", heavily modified by The Beatles which Martin {{thought was a}} sure-fire hit, even though Lennon and McCartney {{did not want to}} release it, not being one of their own compositions or style. Martin was correct: Gerry & the Pacemakers' version, which Martin produced, spent three weeks at No. 1 in April 1963, before being displaced by [...] "From Me to You". On 11 September 1962, the Beatles re-recorded [...] "Love Me Do" [...] with session player Andy White playing drums. Ringo Starr was asked to play tambourine and maracas, and although he complied, he was definitely [...] "not pleased". Due to an EMI library error, a 4 September version with Starr playing drums was issued on the British single release; afterwards, the tape was destroyed, and the 11 September recording with Andy White on drums was used for all subsequent releases. Martin would later praise Starr's drumming, calling him [...] "probably... the finest rock drummer in the world today". As [...] "Love Me Do" [...] peaked at number 17 in the British charts, on 26 November 1962 Martin recorded [...] "Please Please Me", which he did only after Lennon and McCartney had almost begged him to record another of their original songs. Martin's crucial contribution to the song was to tell them to speed up what was initially a slow ballad. After the recording Martin looked over the mixing desk and said, [...] "Gentlemen, you have just <b>made</b> <b>your</b> first number one record". Martin directed Epstein to find a good publisher, as Ardmore & Beechwood had done nothing to promote [...] "Love Me Do", informing Epstein of three publishers who, in Martin's opinion, would be fair and honest, which led them to Dick James.|$|E

I will never recover as completely from B.D.'s book as I have from the stroke. Both were shattering experiences." [...] Her memoir concluded with a letter to her daughter, in which she addressed her several times as [...] "Hyman", and described her actions as [...] "a glaring lack of loyalty and thanks for the very privileged life I feel you have been given". She concluded with a reference to the title of Hyman's book, [...] "If it refers to money, if my memory serves me right, I've been your keeper all these many years.

[...] He then encounters Warden Elroy (James Patrick Stewert), son of the infamous warden Raymond Elroy, who took sadistic pleasure in torturing inmates through manual labor and solitary confinement. Elroy tells Torque the prison has descended into chaos since {{the appearance of the}} malefactors, and asks for help in restoring order. He is able to convince the guards and prisoners to work together, and with Torque's help they are able to escape, although Torque remains behind.|$|E
