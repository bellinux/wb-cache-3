A central composite design based on {{three levels of}} each of particle size, in terms of <b>mesh</b> <b>number</b> (40, 60 and 80 meshes), and gamma radiation dose (25, 50 and 75 kGy) was constructed. A statistically significant dose-dependent decrease (p< 0. 05) in antioxidant properties of gamma irradiated flour was observed. However, {{an increase in the}} <b>mesh</b> <b>number</b> (decrease in particle size of flour) resulted in an increase in antioxidant properties. The optimum level of radiation dose to achieve maximum value of responses was found to be 50 kGy for Trolox equivalent total antioxidant activity (TETAOA), 25 kGy for iron chelating ability (ICA), 25 kGy for reducing power (RP) and 75 kGy for linoleic acid reduction capacity (LARC).

The measurements on the net-shape and towing-net-resistance were {{carried out in the}} circuler tank, with about 51 cm/sec of flow-speed. The results obtained are as follows: 1. The net-shape was noted to be different in each net, especially in both the A-net (2 % of hanging-coefficent) and the B-net (5 % of hanging-coefficent), the cod-end was observed to be fairly expanded. 2. The maximum cross-section-area of net-mouth was obtained in the D-net (15 % of hanging-coefficent). 3. Concerning the total towing-net-resistance, the minimum value was showed by the C-net (10 % of hanging-coefficent), the maximum by A-net (of the largest <b>mesh</b> <b>number)</b> and the value next to maximum was showed by the F-net (30 % of hanging-coefficent; the smallest <b>mesh</b> <b>number).</b> Accordingly, we can assume that, the total net-resistance of bag-net is depending more upon net-shape than upon <b>mesh</b> <b>number</b> of the netting, except those of low hanging-coefficent. ...|$|E
40|$|It is well {{established}} that increasing <b>mesh</b> <b>number</b> in the circumference of a diamond-mesh trawl codend can reduce size selection for round fish, whereas selection for flat fish species is unaffected. This effect has also been documented in Mediterranean trawl fisheries. In contrast, no information is available {{with regard to the}} effect of increasing <b>mesh</b> <b>number</b> in the circumference of square-mesh codends on the size selection of round fish and flat fish species. A field study was devised to bridge this gap and formulate proposals aimed at improving trawl fishery management. Size selection data were collected for a round fish species, red mullet (Mullus barbatus), and two flat fish species, Mediterranean scaldfish (Arnoglossus laterna) and solenette (Buglossidium luteum). Fishing trials were conducted in the Adriatic Sea (Central Mediterranean) using three square-mesh codends that differed only in <b>mesh</b> <b>number</b> around the circumference. Results demonstrated that increasing the number of meshes from 107 to 213 reduced the 50 % retention length (L 50) for red mullet by 2. 5 cm but did not affect size selection for the two flat fish species. In some fisheries, regulatory provisions regarding the number of meshes in the circumference should therefore be carefully considered both for diamond- and square-mesh codends...|$|E

First, the results of the up-to-date method used in all FEM softwares (Gibb's method) can be consistently improved; second, none of the crossover operators tried so far (either general or problem specific) proved useful; third, though the general tendency in Evolutionary Computation seems to be the hybridization with other methods (deterministic or heuristic), none of the presented attempt did encounter any success yet. The good news, however, is that this algorithm allows an improvement over the standard heuristic method between 12 % and 20 % for both the 1545 and 5453 -nodes meshes used as test-bed.

Ultrasonic vibration was given to a resin lapping tool which was formed around the middle part of a vibration rod. To expand the lapping area, a relative spiral motion was newly applied in this experiment between the resin tool and the metal mold. The effects of the mesh number(# 1500, # 3000, # 8000) of WA abrasive in slurry and the normal lapping force(1 N, 2 N, 3 N, 4 N, 5 N) onto the characteristics of surface roughness and lapping uniformity were elucidated. The obtained results are summarised as follows. (1) The relationship between the lapping process time and the surface roughness was almost linear on the log-log graph. (2) The highest improvement rate of surface roughness in this experiment was obtained under the condition of <b>mesh</b> <b>number</b> # 1500 and lapping force 5 N, and then the surface roughness of Ra 0. 08 μm was obtained after the lapping process time of 120 min. (3) It is expected that much smaller surface roughness can be obtained if much greater lapping force was applied.

40|$|To {{determine}} the fluid dynamical coefficients for plane netting, the following studies {{were carried out}} in the water circulating tank of Faculty of Fiseries, Kagoshima University and in the towing tank of Faculty of Fisheries, Hokkaido University. As a rule coefficients for fluid dynamical resistance of netting depend on the projective areas, and therefore it becomes necessary to {{determine the}} experimental equations for the areas towards verious attack angles. In these studies, the minimum unit of the netting fabric is termed as a "Netting element". At the elementary fabric a horizontal cutting is made at the respective intermediate points of the four knotted legs. The shape of a netting element is to be shown in the form "X". The netting used in these studies are "Weaver's knot netting" and the "twisted knotless netting" which are most familier in the Japanese fisheries. Basing on the two sets of tank-experiments made on the two kinds of the netting, the following results were obtained : 1) In the case of towing tank experiments the normal force coefficient and the tangential force coefficient are proved to be independent of the Reynolds number with in the range from 6 × 10 ^ 2 to 3 × 10 ^ 3; {{and in the case of}} the circulating tank experiments they are proved to be so with the range from 8 × 10 ^ 2 to 3 × 10 ^ 3. 2) The edge effect of the netting is not depending on <b>mesh</b> <b>numbers</b> when the value of 2 ij/(i+j) is larger than 6. 0.

However, with the increase of blade length and flow rate, non-linear effects such as finite deformation must be considered in strength computation to guarantee enough accuracy. Parallel computation is adopted to improve the efficiency of classical nonlinear finite element method and shorten the blade design period.

In this paper, the dynamic partial differential equations and the finite element method forms for turbine blades under centrifugal load and flow load are given firstly.

The test results showed that when all windbreaks had the same ventilation rate, the windbreak net of plain weave had the best shelter effect, the secondary was ribbed weave, and the worst was knitted weave; however, if both the shading and anti-insect functions were required, the windbreak net of knitted weave type was relatively more ideal to choose; yet if taking economic benefit into consideration, the windbreak net of ribbed weave was the cheapest.

One of the Ti meshes is anodized to in situ synthesize the self-organized TiO₂nanotube layer as the photoanode materials. Another Ti mesh is platinized through electrodeposition as the counter electrode. The morphologies of the electrodes are characterized by scanning electron microscopy. We investigate the effect of the <b>mesh</b> <b>number</b> on the 3 D DSSCs with the dye adsorption, cyclic voltammetry, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The results show that with the increase in the <b>mesh</b> <b>number,</b> the dye-loadings on the photoanode and the active surface area of Pt on the counter electrode are increased, while the diffusion of the electrolyte becomes more difficult due to the reduced diameter of the openings in the mesh. It has also been demonstrated that the performance of this 3 D DSSC is independent of the incident solar beam angle due to its axial symmetrical structure.
