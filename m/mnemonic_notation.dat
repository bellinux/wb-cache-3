40|$|In {{order to}} assist the field of neural {{networks}} in its maturing, a formalization and a solid foundation are essential. Additionally, to permit the introduction of formal proofs, {{it is essential to}} have an all encompassing formal mathematical definition of a neural network. Most neural networks, even biological ones, exhibit a layered structure. This publication shows that all neural networks can be represented as layered structures. This layeredness is therefore chosen as the basis for a formal neural network framework.

Narratives of identity, displacement and loss, {{common to the}} migrant experience are translated as concept and inspiration for this research. Exploring an attachment to my cultural past highlights a disrupted sense of place, which is examined {{within the context of}} {{personal experience}}. Movement as a condition of migration is a developed theme in this thesis, which is described through a shared sense of place between the Northern and Southern hemispheres, Scotland and Australia. The exhibition A Long Road Home is developed from studio-based research and journeys into past and present landscapes over a period of three and a half years. Accompanying this exegesis is an exhibition of four components: Painting and drawing, a book of self-published poems and memories, after before white rabbits, 2009 [appendix i]. A self-published book of documentary photography of Glasgow’s East End, 2007, the dead end of culture, 2009, [appendix ii]. This exegesis and exhibition component employs <b>mnemonic</b> <b>notations</b> to explore memory as [re] remembering to conceptually underpin this thesis and also to prompt an emotive response. As an abstract concept, memories encompass an itinerant history that is teased from {{beneath the surface of the}} skin to extend the narrative of personal experience. after before white rabbits, a series of memories and recollections, reinterpret the past to inform the present, suggesting mindscape as an alternate landscape. A series of mnemonics invite the reader to participate on a journey that is in a continuous state of flux and transformation that moves between one horizon and another...|$|R

40|$|The term “extended techniques” in {{the context}} of Western art music refers to {{performance}} techniques that fall outside the normal course of study for an instrument. The purpose of this study is, 1) to show that woodwind techniques considered “extended” and relatively “new” in Western classical music appear in traditional repertoires in Japan, and 2) to show that these techniques do not function as merely ornamental or virtuosic devices, but are instead structurally significant. I approach these two objectives through case studies of the instrumental kangen repertoire of the gagaku court ensemble (with a focus on the hichiriki and ryūteki wind parts) and the classical Zen Buddhist honkyoku repertoire of the shakuhachi flute. 	Whereas previous studies have disregarded the role of performance techniques in their analyses of form and mode, I have investigated how performance techniques confirm, emphasize, and even outline the formal and modal structure of the case-study pieces: Etenraku (gagaku) and Sokaku Reibo (shakuhachi). In this study, I analyze two recordings of the virtuosic shakuhachi piece Sokaku Reibo by recognized masters: Aoki Reibo II and Yamaguchi Gorō, and three recordings of the well-known gagaku piece Etenraku by Japanese court ensembles, in addition to recordings of the individual wind parts and sung mnemonics. In order to create a comprehensive picture {{of the role of the}} relevant performance techniques, I combine the methods of transnotation of tablature scores and <b>mnemonics</b> into staff <b>notation</b> (and lists of pitch cells in the case of Sokaku Reibo), transcription of recordings, and spectral analysis of recorded excerpts. 	This study demonstrates that all elements of a performance should be considered in analysis. An analysis that considers only the basic melodic line of a piece risks discarding elements that could inform and confirm the results. In the case of Etenraku and Sokaku Reibo, my investigation of performance techniques has led to a discovery of their structural significance...|$|R
