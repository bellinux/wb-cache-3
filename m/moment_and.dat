Recursions are deduced for the <b>moments</b> <b>and</b> cumulants of functions in the form Rk[a,b] as defined by Dhaene & Sundt (1994).

5|$|Chlorine has two stable {{isotopes}}, 35Cl and 37Cl. These are {{its only}} two natural isotopes occurring in quantity, with 35Cl making up 76% of natural chlorine and 37Cl {{making up the}} remaining 24%. Both are synthesised in stars in the oxygen-burning and silicon-burning processes. Both have nuclear spin 3/2+ and thus {{may be used for}} nuclear magnetic resonance, although the spin magnitude being greater than 1/2 results in non-spherical nuclear charge distribution and thus resonance broadening {{as a result of a}} nonzero nuclear quadrupole <b>moment</b> <b>and</b> resultant quadrupolar relaxation. The other chlorine isotopes are all radioactive, with half-lives too short to occur in nature primordially. Of these, the most commonly used in the laboratory are 36Cl (t1/2 = 3.0×105y) and 38Cl (t1/2 = 37.2min), which may be produced from the neutron activation of natural chlorine.|$|E

In collaboration with Gregory Breit, he developed the Breit–Rabi equation and predicted that the Stern–Gerlach experiment could be modified to confirm {{the properties of the}} atomic nucleus. His techniques for using nuclear magnetic resonance to discern the magnetic <b>moment</b> <b>and</b> nuclear spin of atoms earned him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1944.
