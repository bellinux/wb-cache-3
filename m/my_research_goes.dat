40|$|Entitled "Preservation and the Production of Bare Life," my {{dissertation}} {{considers the}} role of late 19 th and 20 th century American literature as it negotiated and challenged contemporary discourses of preservation, which, I argue, were emerging in complicity with the silencing and cultural dismissal of multiethnic populations within the rapidly expanding United States and its imperial peripheries. From George Catlin's vision of "a nation's park, containing man and beast," to William Faulkner's depiction of Haiti as an historical island "set aside by Heaven itself," preservation was employed {{not only for the}} disinterested acquisition of knowledge, but also as an ideological tool used to encapsulate and redefine certain subjects as static and unchanging, barred from civil lives and political representation. <b>My</b> <b>research</b> <b>goes</b> on to explore the writings of Yankton Sioux essayist, Zitkala-Sa, and African American labor organizer, Angelo Herndon, who envisioned and articulated new anti-colonial definitions of preservation, using their memoirs as a means to contest their presumed containment within these enclosed histories. In our own current moment, when conversations regarding preservation (ecological, historical and cultural) continue to dominate the popular imaginary, my work traces the contested genealogy of this term as it was inspired, influenced, and subsequently transformed by the diverse and multivalent literatures of the late 19 th and 20 th century United State...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2017 - 08 The {{intent of}} this thesis {{is to explore}} {{existing}} gender norms in mixed martial arts cultures. Masculinity is particularly valorized in sport, creating tension for female athletes who are forced to balance masculine norms with feminine beauty ideals. While there is a robust literature on the intersections of mixed martial arts (MMA) and masculinity, female voices are rarely heard in that literature. <b>My</b> <b>research</b> <b>goes</b> beyond the work of others by incorporating female voices and perspectives. Grounded in gender constructionism, my thesis addresses how {{both male and female}} MMA fighters conceive of their and others’ participation in gendered terms, and how this informs their gender identities. My thesis further examines the intersections of masculinity and gender that are readily observable within MMA, and those that are less conspicuous or go largely unnoticed. Finally, my thesis explores how norms perpetuate gender stereotypes and highlight differences, as masculine norms persist in the fighting culture. The examination of gender norms in MMA contributes to a larger body of research concerning gender roles and norms in other social contexts. This contribution extends beyond MMA and sport, serving as a commentary on existing power structures solidified by a gender binary. Yet, the question remains, how do male and female fighters navigate masculine norms and expectations in mixed martial arts? Keywords: Gender, masculinity, norms, binary, mixed martial art...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{studies the}} complex relationship between Italian Renaissance art and dance. Interdisciplinary scholarship has hitherto focused on Renaissance dance treatises, which often exhibit parallels with contemporary writings on painting and sculpture. <b>My</b> <b>research</b> <b>goes</b> beyond the textual parallels to focus {{instead on the}} mechanisms of figuration in the visual arts, and on the corporeal sensibility of the Renaissance image. I examine {{the ways in which}} figural patterns, interactions, and gestures can be understood in terms of choreography. At issue is the nature of figural composition and of the figure itself, the characteristics of the dancing body and the role of that body within the corporeal imagination of the artist. The fundamental thesis is that the Renaissance artist can be considered a choreographer in his own right. Chapter One (From Solo to Chorus) provides a framework for thinking about the artist as choreographer by discussing at length Leon Battista Alberti's On Painting (1435 / 36). First, I show that Alberti's definition of figural composition is essentially choreographic, in that it concerns the formal organization of bodies that move with expressive purpose. Secondly, I analyze Alberti's emphasis upon the Calumny of Apelles and the Three Graces, themes from Antiquity that express an aesthetic held in tension between the poles of fury and grace. These poles ultimately take us one step beyond the alignment of composition and choreography: Alberti also breaches the strict limits imposed on the body by court dance practice. In doing so, he paves the way for artists who expand the world of dance pictorially. These two aspects of Alberti's book [...] the choreographic nature of figural composition and the role of dance in the figural imagination [...] establish the range of issues discussed in the next four chapters, which treat paintings, sculptures, prints, and drawings made between circa 1430 and 1520. Organized to progress from duo to chorus, they treat both explicit and implicit depictions of dance as well as bodies ranging from the graceful to the frenzied. Chapter Two (Duo) explores Annunciations by Donatello and Botticelli as dancing duos that pivot on the opposition between entry and reception, flourish and calm, male and female. The dance is just about to begin [...] impending duet signals imminent union. Focusing on Botticelli's depiction of the Three Graces in the Primavera, Chapter Three (Trio) considers representations of actual dancing, moments when artists such as Botticelli, Mantegna, and Leonardo da Vinci become choreographers in the most explicit sense of the term. Chapter Four (Chorus I) looks at Antonio Pollaiuolo's Dancing Nudes, a fresco that demonstrates the ability of the artistic imagination to choreograph dances far beyond the limits of reality. Chapter Five (Chorus II) extends the dissertation's reach into the sixteenth century with a discussion of Raphael's design for the Massacre of the Innocents engraved by Marcantonio Raimondi. Its graceful figures and their careful composition lead to an inevitable engagement with dance; the violence of the subject is transcended by a choreographic aesthetic. Raphael's art confirms this dissertation's argument for the artist as choreographer, a thesis that has the potential to broaden understanding of what lies at the very core of Renaissance art itself: the composition of human bodies in motion...|$|E

Considering teachers' perspectives about linguistic diversity is especially relevant if taken into account within a theoretical framework which considers linguistic diversity an important tool for the acquisition of further languages. This doctoral thesis, «Linguistic Diversity: A Qualitative Analysis of Foreign Language Teachers' Category Assembly» presented by Melinda Dooly Owenby on the 25 April and directed by Dr. Luci Nussbaum, studies foreign language teachers' perspectives towards students whose language is different from the school's vehicular language. The research was carried out through a qualitative analysis of the way in which both inservice and preservice teachers constructed categories during conversations about linguistic diversity. The principal questions of the research were the following: - Question: Are there any predominant categorizations of linguistic and cultural diversity in the interactions between groups of preservice and inservice teachers and if so, which ones? - Question: Are there any significant differences in their categorizations of linguistic and cultural diversity between preservice and inservice teachers and if so, which ones? - Question: With preservice teachers, does it make a difference if they have participated in international and intercultural projects, exchanges or experiences, compared to the attitudes of preservice teachers who have not? - Question: Is there indication of evolution in the category assemblies over the course of the research? In the theoretical part of the research, the first chapter discusses some previous studies on cognitive schemes and how they affect teacher behaviour and subsequent expectations in the classroom. It also introduces the rationale for the Baktinian, dialogic approach taken in the research and explains how it fits with the ethnomethodological understanding of categorizations, stemming from a common «stock of social knowledge». The chapter also discusses the reasons behind taking a qualitative approach rather than a quantitative one and provides a literature review of teacher expectations because categorization concerning teacher expectations is a key issue in the research. The second chapter of <b>my</b> <b>research</b> <b>goes</b> into further detail about how I adapted Sacks' Membership Categorization Analysis as a principal part of the research approach. It explains what MCA is and how it can be applied to the research, as well as providing some definitions and examples of the more technical aspects of MCA. The other theoretical chapters enter into the topic of diversity, which is the principal focus of the analysis and how conversation participants often categorize the «other» according to features of diversity. Reflective teaching and language awareness is considered since it provides the main focus of the proposals made in this research, based on the results of the category analysis. I also provide a theoretical background of the approach taken as well as a practical outline of its application to the research. The analysis itself consists of a qualitative conversation analysis of over 100 extracts taken from approximately 25 hours of recordings of three groups, one inservice and two preservice groups, all of whom are discussing linguistic and cultural diversity. The extracts were selected according to the frequency of the category mentioned (e. g. linguistic diversity categorized as a problem) and how the actual category was constructed (the negotiation of the category, attenuating features, common background knowledge which was visibly accessed, etc.).

40|$|In a 4 -month constructivist {{teaching}} experiment, I investigated how one 7 th grade {{child and}} two 8 th grade children constructed algebraic reasoning as a transformation in their multiplicative schemes. Algebraic reasoning is the purposeful functioning of a child’s schemes and operations in contexts I defined as algebraic. The algebraic contexts explored {{in my study}} required a child to create equality between two multiplicative situations (compilations) by operating on/with the individual units (1 s) and composite units that constitute the compilations. Algebraic reasoning emerges in two ways from these contexts. First, when a child operates on and with the structure {{of his or her}} schemes, the child is reasoning algebraically. Second, if a child’s schemes form the underpinnings for formal algebraic conceptions, the child is reasoning algebraically. ^ I identified three specific schemes of equality, a unidirectional scheme of equality, a relational scheme of equality, and a quantitative relational scheme (QRE) of equality, that were constructed by the children in my study as they produced equality between two compilations. A QRE scheme of equality is comprised of operations on composite units across two compilations. The QRE scheme constitutes algebraic reasoning because a child operates on the structure of their multiplicative schemes with the structure of their additive schemes. A child also operates on the structure of their equality scheme with the structure of their multiplicative schemes. Moreover, because the QRE scheme is comprised of operations on composite units across two compilations, it forms the cognitive roots for the algebraic concepts of the distributive property, quantitative conservation, and solving linear equations. The construction of the QRE scheme by a child Joe was crucial to my study because it provided evidence of the existence of the hypothesized QRE scheme. ^ The second scheme of equality, a relational scheme, consists of balancing the total 1 s from each compilation via operations on 1 s. This scheme also constitutes algebraic reasoning because a child increases the smaller total via addition and decreases the larger total via subtraction until they produce equality. They operate with the structure of their additive scheme on the structure of their equality scheme. A child with the third scheme of equality, a unidirectional scheme, creates equality by transforming the total from one of the given compilations to produce the second total. A child who operates with this scheme is not reasoning algebraically. ^ I suggest a trajectory for the development of these three equality schemes. A child begins with a unidirectional scheme of equality. Next, they construct a relational scheme of equality as their scheme progresses to include operating on both totals with 1 s to create balance. A second progression occurs to the most advanced equality scheme, a QRE scheme, when a scheme is constructed that moves past operations on 1 s to include operations on composite units. <b>My</b> <b>research</b> <b>goes</b> beyond a description of the three schemes as it provides evidence as to how a child transitions from not having a QRE scheme to having one. Moreover, my research informs the teaching of mathematics as the UDS and QRE tasks offer elementary school teachers a way to give children opportunities to form the foundations for the formal algebraic concepts of the distributive property, solving linear equations, and quantitative conservation. ...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the late mediaeval Church in the Hebrides from 1266 until 1472. The late mediaeval Church was culturally significant: it imposed {{rules and regulations}} on lay society throughout western Christendom. Hitherto, studies of the Hebridean Church have focused on its organisation and its bishops. <b>My</b> <b>research</b> <b>goes</b> beyond these studies to examine {{the effectiveness of the}} Church in bringing Christian religion and piety to mediaeval Hebridean society. This is accomplished through a prosopographical study of the clergy in the Hebrides and analysis of the church and chapel sites. The mediaeval Church transcended countries and peoples and through the provision of parish clergy, it managed to establish and maintain a certain level of Christian faith and belief. The majority of the recorded clergy were Gaels who came from the dioceses of Sodor and Argyll and were therefore able to communicate with their parishioners. Some of the clergy can be identified as belonging to the territorial, professional and ecclesiastical kindreds and can be described as of high social status. Determining educational status is particularly tricky, given the absence of any evidence for any schools in the Hebrides. However, we can reasonably conclude that the high status clergy undoubtedly were educated, although not all to university level. The scarcity of accusations of non-residence implies that non-residence was not widespread. An examination of rectors and perpetual vicars at the parish churches reveals that there was usually one or the other at the parish churches. A more common accusation regarded pluralism, although we have to acknowledge that sometimes the accusations might be exaggerated. Whilst allegations of offences such as simony are rare, failure to comply with canon law on clerical celibacy is clear from all supplications seeking dispensation for illegitimacy as the son of a priest. The churches, chapels and grave-yards were a focal point for these priests and for secular society. As important as the provision of clergy are the adequate numbers of, and maintenance of, church buildings. The church building had enormous significance for both mediaeval theologians and the laity. The parish church, in particular, was very important as the central focus for baptism and burial and therefore access is very important. The key issues are, therefore, access to the parish church, the visibility of the churches and their relationship with secular settlements. Access is determined by location and the location of the forty-three parish churches in the Hebrides can, on the whole, be described as accessible. None of them are inaccessible locations, indeed most can be accessed both from land and from the sea. They are relatively visible, but not outstandingly so. However, their visibility would have been enhanced with use of plaster on the exterior of the buildings. Secular settlements were dispersed and consequently there were always some settlements nearby the parish church and others more distant. A major issue which has arisen is the identification of categories of chapels. Using models established by Orme, there are four main categories of chapel – dependent, cult, locational and oratory chapels. Effectively, the numerous small chapels meant that, in general, {{it can be said that}} people were never very far from some kind of church building. Identifying the type of chapel allows us to understand how the parishes functioned. The final two chapters consist of case-studies of the islands of Tiree, Coll and Skye. There are a total of 12 parishes on these islands and within these parishes 68 church and chapel sites. The relationships between parish church and chapel have been analysed in each and we have been able to identify some dependent chapels. It is also clear that we have a number of early mediaeval chapel sites which may have been abandoned by the late Middle Ages. However, other early mediaeval sites may have continued in use, perhaps as cult chapels for particular saints. The cults of saints such as St Columba, St Comgan and St Maelrubha were especially strong in Skye whilst St Columba, St Finnan and St Findoca were popular on Tiree and Coll. Above all else, this study demonstrates the vitality of the late mediaeval Church in the Hebrides; its parish churches were not overwhelmingly appropriated and there were sufficient numbers of apparently educated clergy available to serve the churches. The range of ecclesiastical sites also shows the breadth of provision...|$|E

40|$|The {{intention}} of my thesis Hopscotch by Cortázar - {{a game in}} many games was to analyze the novel in its ludic dimension.

However, I {{do not intend to}} utilize this term in his whole meaning, I wanted to study the multiplicity and unit of the game, exploring some of the aspects of the semantic gesture.

40|$|Of all {{the major}} migrant groups in the Netherlands, Turkish and Moroccan pupils perform the least well in school. Although smaller in number {{there is also a}} Turkish and Moroccan group that is {{successful}} in school. In several projects these successful Turkish and Moroccan higher education students give, as a student mentor, guidance and counselling to Turkish and Moroccan pupils in secondary education. International literature has extensively reviewed the effects of mentoring. The content of mentoring as such, however, has not been studied so much. In the article I will focus on this somehow neglected aspect in the research. I will, based on <b>my</b> own qualitative <b>research,</b> <b>go</b> into depth on how mentoring is practiced on a daily basis. With the aim to develop (the beginning of) a methodology I will look how a mentor relationship develops over time and describe the variety of themes a mentor relationships deals with...|$|R
40|$|When I {{agreed to}} do an article that would {{capture the essence of}} <b>my</b> <b>research,</b> I did not realize how hard it would be. What made the task {{difficult}} was that I was not sure how to write the article in an interesting way. I thought a descriptive narrative of my work might be about as interesting as reading the phone directory. As I considered this problem, I realized that a presenta-tion of my work {{against the backdrop of the}} history of reading and writing might be appealing. This history could take the long view as well as the short view. The long view is driven by the fact that I have studied the history of writ-ing, and this history can be traced back thousands of years. The short view is driven by the fact that although <b>my</b> <b>research</b> on reading <b>goes</b> back only 40 years, during this short span of time academic psychology has gone through three paradigm shifts. Additionally, the field of reading has experienced some important wars (captured in the title of Chall’s, 1967, classic book Learning to Read: The Great Debate). What follows, then, is a brief over-view of the history of writing as well as a description of my work on fluency. A history of writing is included because it reflects my personal view on this important aspect of reading...|$|R
40|$|I am very {{grateful}} {{to all the people}} who have supported me during the pursuit of my Ph. D. degree. This work {{would not have been possible}} without their encouragement and help. First and foremost, I would like to express my sincere appreciation and deep gratitude to my dissertation advisor, Dr. A. P. Meliopoulos, for his continuous support and invaluable guidance during my graduate studies at Georgia Tech. His willingness to share freely his vast experience and knowledge has contributed significantly to the completion of this work. I would like to extend my appreciation to Dr. Deepak M. Divan, Dr. Ronald G. Harley, and Dr. Erik I. Verriest for serving on my dissertation proposal committee, and Dr. Shijie Deng for serving on my dissertation defense committee. Their valuable comments and instructive suggestions have helped improve the quality of this dissertation.

40|$|First of all, I {{would like}} to thank my advisor Professor Friedhelm Meyer auf der Heide for his great support and many helpful discussions. He showed me in which {{direction}} <b>my</b> <b>research</b> could <b>go</b> but always left me the freedom to do the routing and to choose my way. Besides, I {{would like to}} thank my “co-advisor” Professor Bruce Maggs who lead me to several spectacular attractions including an embedding of the AKS- into the Multibutterfly-network, a life-sized Diplodocus and many fancy restaurants in Pittsburgh. I {{would like to thank}} Matthias Westermann and Klaus Schröder for a very productive collaboration and many valuable discussions, not only about distributed data management but also about maybe even more important aspects of life. Many thanks also to Christian Scheideler and Rolf Wanka with whom I shared an office during most of the last three and a half years. I enjoyed listening to many private lessons Christian and Rolf gave me, e. g., in probability theory, sorting algorithms, and history. In particular, I have to thank the students who did most of the implementations for the experimental results presented in my thesis. Harald Räcke implemented the newly invented data management strategies in the DIVA (Distributed Variables) library; Christof Krick implemented a benchmark of applications for evaluating these strategies; and Mark Meierjohann did most of the simulations for the multimedia data server. All of them were very engaged and did a very good job. This research was supported by the DFG-Sonderforschungsbereich 376 “Massive Parallelität”...|$|R
40|$|I {{would like}} to express my deepest thanks to Dr. Stanley Gilliland, my major professor, for his patient and {{encouraging}} advisement. I am forever grateful for the opportunity he has given me to continue my collegiate education. I {{would also like to}} extend my gratitude to Dr. Christina DeWitt and Dr. Udaya DeSilva for serving on my committee. You have imparted me with skills and knowledge that I’m sure will serve {{me for the rest of}} my life. I wish to thank my husband, Kelly James, for his unwavering support. You are my strength and I couldn’t have done this without you. To my parents, Joe and Johnna Caldwell, thank you for giving me the resources to continue my education and instilling in me a sense of responsibility that has allowed me to be successful. I would also like to thank my lab mates and friends: Lacey Guillen, Megan Bible and Sandra McCoy. I have learned from each of you, and I never imagined that research could be so much fun.

40|$|I {{would like}} to express my {{gratitude}} upon accomplishing my thesis project and my master study to the following persons. I owe my greatest gratitude to the three supervisors, Johan Versendaal, Marjan van den Akker and Bastiaan de Bevere. Their academic and professional guidance stimulates my interest and potential of pursuing the facts and enlightens me on deducting them logically with a scientific method to achieve a problem of both theoretical and practical values. They have also made available their support {{in a number of}} ways including helping with the schedules and challenges during <b>my</b> <b>research.</b> Special thanks <b>go</b> to the other colleagues in Ballast Nedam who also helped during my thesis project. The thesis and the master study would not have been possible without the opportunity given by the Institute of Information and Computing Sciences at Utrecht University. The Master of Business Informatics program granted me a chance to improve my knowledge of ICT by balancing it with a business-oriented perspective. Although the journey to comprehend the science of Business Informatics lasts for the rest of my life, the “method” engineering I studied and the rigour required to carry out the engineering process wil...|$|R
40|$|Raul {{introduced}} me to a world I only thought I knew; his intellectual watermark is present on every page of this thesis. Chuck more than kindly volunteered to chair this thesis; he believed in my abilities and has been an interminable source of motivation and support. My warmest regards go out to you both. Thanks {{to the rest of}} my committee, Dan and Leslie. Due to karma’s interventions Dan, who has quite literally been there from the very beginning, is still around. I’m quite glad to still have him around. Thanks go out to anybody who has, in one way or another, expressed interest in <b>my</b> <b>research.</b> Thank also <b>goes</b> out to Richmond Brown, who was always there to lend an ear or hand when doom seemed inevitable; and Molly, Alexandra and Elizabeth without whom writing would have been a substantially lonelier and tense experience. In Argentina, I want to thank Ale and Vasco of Ojo Obrero, as well as everyone from the Polo Obrero for opening the doors {{to the world of the}} piquete to me. Also, a special thanks to the entire Delellis family who provided me with a home and family in Argentina. Jorge Delellis had me promise to include his nam...|$|R
