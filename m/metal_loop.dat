25|$|Sixx is {{most often}} seen playing Gibson Thunderbird basses. Between 2000 and 2003 Gibson {{produced}} the Nikki Sixx Signature Blackbird. The Gibson Blackbird was {{for all intents and}} purposes a standard Thunderbird bass, but with a satin black finish, Iron Crosses on the fretboard instead of dots, an Iron Cross behind the classic Thunderbird logo, and Nikki Sixx's 'opti-grab' (a <b>metal</b> <b>loop</b> installed behind the bridge for hooking the little finger onto while playing). What also made this bass interesting was the lack of volume or tone controls, being replaced by a single on/off switch. Although subtle, this helped give this Blackbird more tone and a higher output. This model was discontinued in 2003, but has recently been put back in production as the Epiphone Nikki Sixx Blackbird. Cosmetically the Epiphone Blackbird is identical to the Gibson original, but with a bolt-on single ply neck, solid mahogany body, different pickups and lower grade parts and manufacturing. The Epiphone model still kept the 'opti-grab,' designed and made first by his bass technician Tim Luzzi, and single on/off switch of the Gibson original. In 2008, Gibson announced a 'limited run' new Nikki Sixx signature bass. Like the original it features a neck through design made of mahogany and walnut, with maple 'wings' to form the body. Unlike the original 'Blackbird' bass, a clear 'satin black cherry' finish is given to the instrument, with red 'slash' X's on the 3rd, 5th, 7th and 12th frets. A mirror pickguard is also applied, with a red signature and two X's (6 x's on the whole bass) is also a new addition. Unlike the Gibson Blackbird, the new signature featured volume and tone controls, the 'opti-grab', and an on/off switch.|$|E
2500|$|Other changes {{included}} new colored cloth badges for all {{ranks and}} positions and [...] "skill awards", {{represented by a}} <b>metal</b> <b>loop</b> worn on the belt, that were awarded instantly {{at the time they}} were earned. They [...] supplemented individual rank requirements which along with merit badges were also presented immediately, and recognized later at the court of honor. The merit badge program—previously only available to First Class and above—was opened to all ranks, and merit badges were required for Tenderfoot, Second Class and First Class. The number of required merit badges for Eagle Scout was increased to 24, and Camping merit badge was dropped from the required list. The entry age was changed to 11 or 10-½ if a boy had finished fifth grade.|$|E

5000|$|The {{design for}} the pattern face of the {{building}} originated from steel <b>metal</b> square <b>loops</b> and this is shown through the extruded balconies making up the façade, appearing to be {{an extension of the}} <b>metal</b> <b>loops.</b> In order to keep a similar building skyline of surrounding structures, the Podium apartment consists of 10 storeys, the Cloud was an addition but was designed to appear not to disturb the distinct building skyline.|$|R
50|$|A late {{variant of}} this type of scepter hieroglyph {{sometimes}} represented the sistrum, a musical rattle that was sacred to Hathor and was carried by her priestesses. The sistrum had a <b>metal</b> <b>loop</b> with jingles mounted on a cow-goddess faced handle.|$|E
50|$|In 1982 they {{introduced}} the famous bright-orange XL-R design. The XL-R {{had a number}} of improvements over earlier models. Among these was a new buckle design; previous designs generally use a <b>metal</b> <b>loop</b> attached {{on one side of the}} cuff and a buckle with a rack cut into the bottom attached to the other. For tighter settings the loop had to be inserted into a rack cut higher on the buckle, lowering the mechanical advantage and making it much harder to close. The new design moved the rack to one cuff and put the <b>metal</b> <b>loop</b> on the buckle itself. This offered steady mechanical advantage on any setting. The new four-buckle system is largely identical to any modern downhill ski boot.|$|E
50|$|To {{ensure that}} the grenade hit the ground nose first, a cloth {{streamer}} {{was attached to the}} end of the handle. When thrown this unfurled and acted as a tail to stabilize flight. The grenade came with a <b>metal</b> <b>loop</b> so it could hang from the belt.|$|E
50|$|The word terret {{may also}} be used for other <b>metal</b> <b>loops</b> for {{attaching}} ropes or chains, such as the ring on a dog collar. The word derives from the Old French toret or touret, meaning small and round.|$|R

50|$|Here another {{change of}} sides is {{required}} for the single tier, as the rope must then be passed in a similar fashion around the front side of the right pack-box or pack-bag, and finally tightened thoroughly, before being tied off onto the <b>metal</b> <b>loop,</b> by means of a half-hitch for example.|$|E
5000|$|A {{carabiner}} (...) or karabiner is {{a specialized}} type of shackle, a <b>metal</b> <b>loop</b> with a spring-loaded gate used to quickly and reversibly connect components, {{most notably in}} safety-critical systems. The word is a shortened form of Karabinerhaken (or also short Karabiner), a German phrase for a [...] "spring hook" [...] used by a carbine rifleman, or carabinier, to attach items to a belt or bandolier.|$|E
50|$|A {{wire loop}} {{game is a}} game which {{involves}} guiding a <b>metal</b> <b>loop</b> along a serpentine length of wire without actually touching the loop to the wire. The loop and wire are connected to a power source {{in such a way}} that, if they touch, they form a closed electric circuit. The circuit includes a light- or sound-emitting device of some form, which indicates that the game has been lost.|$|E
50|$|Carabiners are <b>metal</b> <b>loops</b> with {{spring-loaded}} gates (openings), used as connectors. Once made {{primarily from}} steel, almost all carabiners for recreational climbing are now {{made from a}} light weight aluminum alloy. Steel carabiners are much heavier, but harder wearing, and therefore are often used by instructors when working with groups.|$|R

50|$|The RSL can be {{disengaged}} by a skydiver {{in situations}} where it is desirable to detach the main parachute without deploying the reserve. Examples of such situations may include certain high-wind landings (in case the parachute must be cut away if the skydiver is being dragged across the ground), when performing canopy formations or when landing over water. The RSL attaches to the risers through a small <b>metal</b> <b>loop</b> that will disconnect when a fabric tab is pulled.|$|E
50|$|The Jonas peeler, {{designed}} in Sweden in 1953, is a straight design with a pivoting blade {{attached to the}} end of an oblong <b>metal</b> <b>loop</b> handle, which is held like a knife. A shaft runs through the length of the handle. The blade has two edges to enable use in either direction, and by either hand. While often copied, the original is still made by Linden Sweden. For many decades, it has been the standard type of peeler in the United States.|$|E
50|$|Due to {{the bell}} in this play, {{dedicated}} Noh stages have a hook used for holding this bell {{in the center}} of the roof, and a <b>metal</b> <b>loop</b> at upstage left to hold the rope when lowering it; these are used only for this play. The part calls for a change of Noh costumes inside the bell, which is very challenging, due to being done alone, in the dark, in cramped quarters - normally a Noh costume is put on by several attendants. Accordingly, this role is reserved for senior actors.|$|E
5000|$|As the climber {{continues}} to ascend, they clip the rope into {{higher and higher}} <b>metal</b> <b>loops</b> fixed into the rock, {{so that in the}} event of a fall they don't fall further than the [...] "unclipped" [...] length of rope allows. While the task of belaying is typically assigned to a companion who stays at the bottom, self-belaying is also possible as an advanced technical climbing technique.|$|R

50|$|A shackle, {{also known}} as a gyve, is a U-shaped piece of metal secured with a clevis pin or bolt across the opening, or a hinged <b>metal</b> <b>loop</b> secured with a {{quick-release}} locking pin mechanism. The term also applies to handcuffs and other similarly conceived restraint devices that function in a similar manner. Shackles are the primary connecting link in all manner of rigging systems, from boats and ships to industrial crane rigging, as they allow different rigging subsets to be connected or disconnected quickly. A shackle is also the similarly shaped piece of metal used with a locking mechanism in padlocks.|$|E
