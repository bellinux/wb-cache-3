5|$|Just {{months into}} his reign, Edward forced a {{constitutional}} crisis by insisting on marrying the American divorcée Wallis Simpson. Although legally Edward could have married Simpson, as King {{he was also}} head of the Church of England, which at that time did not allow divorced people to remarry. Edward's ministers believed that the people would never accept Simpson as Queen and advised against the <b>marriage.</b> <b>As</b> <b>a</b> constitutional monarch, Edward was obliged to accept ministerial advice.|$|E

5|$|Maryland holds {{a unique}} {{place in the}} history of {{same-sex}} marriage in the United States. In 1973, it became the first state in the nation to define <b>marriage</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> union {{between a man and a}} woman, expressly banning same-sex marriage. The General Assembly passed the law a short time after voters in the state ratified Article 46 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights, commonly referred to as the Equal Rights Amendment, in November 1972. The constitutional provision prohibited discrimination in equality of rights on the basis of sex.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the Supreme Court's {{decision}} in Obergefell v. Hodges, U.S. states passed several {{different types of}} state constitutional amendments banning legal recognition of same-sex unions in U.S. state constitutions, referred to by proponents as defense of marriage amendments. The amendments define <b>marriage</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> union between one man and one woman and prevent civil unions or same-sex marriages from being legalized, {{though some of the}} amendments bar only the latter. The Obergefell {{decision in}} June 2015 invalidated these state constitutional amendments insofar as they prevented same-sex couples from marrying, even though the actual text of these amendments remain written into the state constitutions.|$|E
5|$|While the {{contemporary}} Western ideal sees <b>marriage</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> unique bond {{between two people}} who are in love, families in which heredity is central to power or inheritance (such as royal families) have often seen marriage in a different light. There are often political or other non-romantic functions that must be served and the relative wealth and power of the potential spouses may be considered. Marriage for political, economic, or diplomatic reasons, the marriage of state, was a pattern seen for centuries among European rulers.|$|E

5|$|The Roda Codex, {{the sole}} source for Onneca's Christian marriage, places this union with her cousin Aznar Sánchez de Laron before her <b>marriage,</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> widow, to Abdullah of Córdoba. Based on this, French {{historian}} Évariste Lévi-Provençal developed a chronology for Onneca's life that placed her birth date around 835. Lévi-Provençal believed that Onneca did not accompany her {{father when he}} returned to Pamplona in 882, either because she had already died, or because she had converted to Islam and chose to remain in Abdullah's harem. However, such a chronology is problematic since it implies that Onneca's children by Aznar were born before or only shortly after her father's capture in 860, thus making Onneca's daughter Toda Aznárez a sexagenarian {{at the time of her}} son García Sánchez I's birth (which is known to have occurred in either 919 or 922), and nearly a centenarian at the time of her 958 visit to Cordoba. Therefore, most historians addressing the question have concluded that the Roda Codex was in error with regard to the order of Onneca's two marriages.|$|E
5|$|The {{primary role}} of free women in {{classical}} Athens was {{to marry and}} bear children. The emphasis on <b>marriage</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> way to perpetuate the family through childbearing had changed from archaic Athens, when (at least amongst the powerful) marriages were as much about making beneficial connections as they were about perpetuating the family. Athenian women typically first married much older men around age fourteen. Before this they were looked after by their closest male relative, {{who was responsible for}} choosing their husband; the bride had little say in this decision. Since a classical Athenian marriage was concerned with the production of children who could inherit their parents' property, women often married relatives. This was especially the case of women with no brothers (epikleroi), whose nearest male relative was given the first option of marrying her.|$|E
5|$|The {{relations}} between family members follow two patterns: {{the bonds of}} marriage serve mostly as Machiavellian means to financial ends, while the obligations of the older generation to the young {{take the form of}} sacrifice and deprivation. Delphine is trapped in a loveless marriage to Baron de Nucingen, a money-savvy banker. He is aware of her extramarital affairs, and uses them as a means to extort money from her. Anastasie, meanwhile, is married to the comte de Restaud, who cares less about the illegitimate children she has than the jewels she sells to provide for her lover– who is conning her in a scheme that Rastignac has heard was popular in Paris. This depiction of <b>marriage</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> tool of power reflects the harsh reality of the unstable social structures of the time.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} attitudes toward gay marriage {{within the context}} of debates over the declining vitality of heterosexual <b>marriage</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> institution. We use data from a three-state survey conducted in 1998 - 2000 and designed to explore attitudes toward marriage and divorce reform (N= 1324). We find that gender and race significantly affect attitudes toward gay marriage, but marital status and state of residence do not. A core finding is that heterosexual marriage preservation attitudes are pivotal predictors, net of religiosity. Cohabitation and parenthood are also key, but opposing determinants. We interpret these findings with theories about vested interest in upholding <b>marriage</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> institution and ambivalence resulting fro...|$|R
