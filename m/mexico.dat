40|$|Abstract. In this paper, we use {{the gravity}} model of trade to {{decompose}} <b>Mexico’s</b> export growth into components associated with export-supply capacity, import-demand conditions, and other factors. Some have argued that <b>Mexico’s</b> recent sluggish export performance is due to China’s expansion in global markets. Others have cited <b>Mexico’s</b> inability to make needed economic reforms, which have hurt the country’s competitiveness in manufacturing. Our results suggest that negative import-demand shocks associated with both China and the U. S. recession have contributed to the slowdown in <b>Mexico’s</b> export growth. Had U. S. GDP growth not decelerated after 2000, <b>Mexico’s</b> annual manufacturing export growth would have been 1. 4 percentage points higher. Had China’s growth in export capabilities remained unchanged after 1995, <b>Mexico’s</b> annual export growth rate would have been 1. 5 percentage points higher in the late 1990 s and 3. 0 percentage points higher in the early 2000 s. We also examine factors that contribute to growth in <b>Mexico’s</b> export supply capacity...|$|R

5|$|Early in the {{duration}} of the cyclone, the National Hurricane Center recommended for interests along the coast of southwestern <b>Mexico</b> to monitor the progress of the storm. Upon regaining tropical storm status on June 1, the governments of Guatemala and <b>Mexico</b> issued a tropical storm watch from Sipacate, Guatemala to Barra de Tonala, <b>Mexico.</b> Later, as the track became more apparent, the watch was replaced by a tropical storm warning, and a tropical storm watch was extended westward to Salina Cruz, <b>Mexico.</b> Officials in <b>Mexico</b> allocated emergency funds for southern regions of Chiapas and Oaxaca in preparation for a potential flooding disaster. At least 1,400people were evacuated in Chiapas to emergency shelters.|$|E

40|$|Over {{the last}} decade, <b>Mexico’s</b> {{unit labour costs}} {{decreased}} relative to other emerging markets’, especially compared to China’s. This decrease boosted <b>Mexico’s</b> trade competitiveness, particularly in the manufacturing sector. However, <b>Mexico’s</b> increasing competitiveness masks one of the country’s fundamental concerns, which {{is the absence of}} productivity improvements. The aim of this paper is two-fold: first, we examine the evolution of total factor productivity in <b>Mexico’s</b> manufacturing sector, as compared to China’s. Firm-level data is employed to analyse the distribution and characteristics of productivity across <b>Mexico’s</b> regions. Second, using regional data for the period 2005 – 2012, we study the policy impediments behind sluggish productivity improvements, particularly to determine how labour informality may have contributed. The study takes advantage of <b>Mexico’s</b> heterogeneity across regions in terms of productivity, market regulation, financial constraints and firm size to identify economic policies that can help to boost productivity in the future...|$|R
