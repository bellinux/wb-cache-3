5|$|Sonderkommando wearing {{gas masks}} then dragged the bodies from the chamber. The victims' glasses, {{artificial}} limbs, jewelry, and hair were removed, and any dental work was extracted so the gold could be <b>melted</b> <b>down.</b> The corpses were {{burned in the}} nearby incinerators, and the ashes were buried, thrown in the river, or used as fertilizer.|$|E
5|$|During World War II {{the demand}} for metal for the war effort {{resulted}} in many bells being <b>melted</b> <b>down</b> for scrap. As a result, those that survived are generally regarded as important historic artifacts. More than 70,000 bells (approximately 90 per cent of the bonshō then in existence) were destroyed in this way. However, rapid production of bells during the post-war period meant that by 1995 the number of temple bells in Japan had returned to pre-war levels.|$|E

5|$|Parsifal was {{expressly}} composed for {{the stage}} at Bayreuth {{and many of the}} most famous recordings of the opera come from live performances on that stage. In the pre-LP era, Karl Muck conducted excerpts from the opera at Bayreuth. These are still considered some of the best performances of the opera on disc. They also contain the only sound evidence of the bells constructed for the work's premiere, which were <b>melted</b> <b>down</b> for scrap during World War II.|$|E
5|$|Under his ownership, the Drawing Room was redecorated in a Renaissance Venetian style, In the process, Crace's {{stencilling}} {{was over}} painted and then covered by damasked silk, the Norton fireplace was removed, the furniture replaced with Edwardian pieces, and the carpet dyed by Sketchleys. In 1917, {{to assist the}} war effort, the ironwork conservatory was razed, and its ironwork <b>melted</b> <b>down</b> for ammunition.|$|E

5|$|During {{the period}} of the Commonwealth, 1649–60, {{wholesale}} iconoclasm was wrought on all the pictorial elements of Christian buildings. Most of England’s medieval stained glass was smashed. The majority of England’s medieval statues were smashed or defaced leaving only a few isolated examples intact. Medieval paintings almost disappeared. Vestments embroidered in the famous style known as Opus Anglicanum were burnt. Those medieval Communion vessels that had escaped the Dissolution were <b>melted</b> <b>down</b> so that only about 50 items of pre-Reformation church plate remain.|$|E
5|$|From 1930 to 1970, the Jules Rimet Trophy {{was awarded}} to the World Cup winning team. It was {{originally}} simply known as the World Cup or Coupe du Monde, but in 1946 it was renamed after the FIFA president Jules Rimet who set up the first tournament. In 1970, Brazil's third victory in the tournament entitled them to keep the trophy permanently. However, the trophy was stolen in 1983 {{and has never been}} recovered, apparently <b>melted</b> <b>down</b> by the thieves.|$|E
5|$|Initially, Nakashima, Francois Sammer (a Czech {{architect}} {{who had worked}} for Le Corbusier in Russia) and Chandulal (a devotee who had trained as an engineer), built a full-scale model of the dormitory in order to test the feasibility of the design, and then used it as a laboratory to further refine the construction methods. Nakashima's duties included doing very explicit detail drawings showing, for example, the design of the concrete formwork. Devotees even donated brass utensils so that they could be <b>melted</b> <b>down</b> to make door handles and hinges.|$|E

Only one piece of the Jules Rimet Trophy has been found, the original base which FIFA had kept in a basement of the federation's Zürich headquarters prior to 2015.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} {{badge of}} the Army and Navy Union was patented as design No. 21640 on June 21, 1892. The distinctive badge {{has been used}} since then and worn on public occasions and ceremonies by its members. The badge of the Army and Navy Union received can be worn on Army or Navy uniforms. The United States Congress in 1913 authorized the use condemned American Civil War cannons to be <b>melted</b> <b>down</b> to provide medals {{to the members of}} the organization.|$|E
5|$|The three-cent nickel piece {{initially}} circulated well, {{but became}} less popular when the five-cent nickel {{was introduced in}} 1866, a larger, more convenient coin, with a value of five cents better fitting the decimal system. After 1870, most years saw low annual mintages for the three-cent nickel, and in 1890 Congress abolished it. The last were struck in 1889; many were <b>melted</b> <b>down</b> to coin more five-cent pieces. The issue is not widely collected, and prices for rare dates remain low {{by the standards of}} American collectible coinage.|$|E

5|$|The town escaped heavy bombing {{during the}} Second World War, but the sea front {{incurred}} great damage {{when it was}} fortified against invasion. The cast iron lampposts and benches along the front were removed and <b>melted</b> <b>down</b> for munitions, as was much of the superstructure from both Bournemouth and Boscombe piers before they were breached to prevent their use by enemy ships. The large amounts of barbed wire and anti-tank obstacles along the beach, and the mines {{at the foot of}} the chines, took two years to remove when peace was finally achieved.|$|E
5|$|Writing in the Handbook of Texas, {{historian}} Thomas Ricks Lindley {{maintains that}} the Wagner cannon does not match the Smithwick account. The Wagner gun is made of iron and is smaller than a six-pounder. Historians such as Lindley think {{it more likely that}} the Gonzales cannon was taken to San Antonio de Béxar, where it was used during the Battle of the Alamo and captured by Mexican troops in March 1836. It was likely <b>melted</b> <b>down</b> with many of the other cannons when the Mexican army retreated.|$|E
5|$|After Méliès's {{financial}} difficulties and decline, most {{copies of his}} prints were lost. In 1917, his offices were occupied by the French military, who <b>melted</b> <b>down</b> many of Méliès's films to gather the traces of silver from the film stock and make boot heels from the celluloid. When the Théâtre Robert-Houdin was demolished in 1923, the prints kept there were sold by weight to a vendor of second-hand film. Finally, in that same year, Méliès had a moment of anger and burned all his remaining negatives in his garden in Montreuil. In 1925, he began selling toys and candy from a stand in the Gare Montparnasse in Paris. A Trip to the Moon was largely forgotten to history and went unseen for years.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the most}} {{powerful}} individual in the Roman Empire, Augustus wished to embody the spirit of Republican virtue and norms. He also wanted to relate to and connect with {{the concerns of the}} plebs and lay people. He achieved this through various means of generosity and a cutting back of lavish excess. In the year 29BC, Augustus paid 400 sesterces each to 250,000 citizens, 1,000 sesterces each to 120,000 veterans in the colonies, and spent 700 million sesterces in purchasing land for his soldiers to settle upon. He also restored 82 different temples to display his care for the Roman pantheon of deities. In 28BC, he <b>melted</b> <b>down</b> 80 silver statues erected in his likeness and in honor of him, an attempt of his to appear frugal and modest.|$|E
5|$|Fiscal chaos, {{coupled with}} {{problems}} {{of transportation and}} the requisition of metal led to a general economic collapse as factories ran out of raw materials and laid off workers. The crisis especially afflicted Belgium's large manufacturing industries. As raw material usually imported from abroad dried up, more firms laid off workers. Unemployment became a major problem and increased reliance on charity distributed by civil institutions and organisations. As many as 650,000 people were unemployed between 1915 and 1918. The German authorities used the crisis to loot industrial machinery from Belgian factories, which was either sent to Germany intact or <b>melted</b> <b>down.</b> The policy escalated {{after the end of}} the German policy of deportation in 1917 which later created major problems for Belgian economic recovery {{after the end of the}} war.|$|E
5|$|In Bakuriani, {{the street}} where Kumaritashvili's {{childhood}} home is located was renamed in his honour. Felix Loch of Germany, who {{won the gold medal}} in luge at the Vancouver Olympics, had his medal <b>melted</b> <b>down</b> and refashioned into two disks, etched with an image of Kumaritashvili and the years of his birth and death, one of which he gave to Kumaritashvili's parents. In spite of several donations of money to the Kumaritashvili family, the tragedy was hard on them; twice in the years afterwards Dodo, who continued to fix a meal for Kumaritashvili every day, tried to kill herself, while David dealt with severe health problems resulting in multiple stays in hospital.|$|E
