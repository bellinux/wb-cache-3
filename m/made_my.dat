I didn't want to go back on my word to my wife that I'd retired from front-line politics. How would it all work? Was No 10 suitable for someone in a wheelchair? All these things go through one's mind. Then if Michael had won...he would have had to ask me to join his government, and I didn't want that. I asked myself: why am I risking all this?

500|$|Bach {{composed}} his cantata {{as part of}} {{his application}} for the position of [...] in Leipzig, the official title being [...] (Cantor and Director of Music). As cantor, he was responsible for the music at four Lutheran churches, the main churches Thomaskirche (St. Thomas) and the Nikolaikirche (St. Nicholas), but also the Neue Kirche (New Church) and the Peterskirche (St. Peter). As director of music, the Thomaskantor was Leipzig's [...] "senior musician", responsible for the music on official occasions such as town council elections and homages. Functions related to the university took place at the Paulinerkirche. The position became vacant when Johann Kuhnau died on 5 June 1722. Bach was interested, mentioning as one reason that he saw more possibilities for future academic studies of his sons in Leipzig: [...] "...but this post was described to me in such favorable terms that finally (particularly since my sons seemed inclined to [...] studies) I cast my lot, {{in the name of the}} Lord, and <b>made</b> <b>my</b> journey to Leipzig, took my examination, and then made the change of position." ...|$|E

Calling [...] "Already Gone" [...] one of the best songs he had ever composed, Tedder challenged people to [...] "listen [...] and form their own opinions". Clarkson discouraged her label, RCA, from releasing [...] "Already Gone" [...] as a single because she respected Beyoncé, but they went against her will and released it. She said, [...] "It's one of those things I have no control over. I already <b>made</b> <b>my</b> album. At this point, the record company can do whatever they want with it." [...] Clarkson later told James Montgomery of MTV News that it was unfortunate [...] "Already Gone" [...] and [...] "Halo" [...] sound so similar, but noted that at least they have different vocal melodies.|$|E

500|$|Rodriguez {{first came}} up with the idea for Planet Terror during the {{production}} of The Faculty: [...] "I remember telling Elijah Wood and Josh Hartnett, all these young actors, that zombie movies were dead and hadn't been around in a while, but that I thought they were going to come back in a big way because they’d been gone for so long.

We got all excited about it, and then I didn't know where to go with it. The introduction was about as far as I'd gotten, and then I got onto other movies. Sure enough, the zombie [...] invasion happened and they all came back again, and I was like, 'Ah, I knew that I should've <b>made</b> <b>my</b> zombie film.'" [...] The story was reapproached when Tarantino and Rodriguez developed the idea for Grindhouse.|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reaction}} to the album's lyrical content was mixed. Thom Jurek of Allmusic felt the [...] "dark, unrelentingly twisted-as-fuck lyrics reflect a singular intensity," [...] and praised the band for connecting their anti-religion stance with a belief that religion has underscored many wars throughout history. However, Rolling Stones Chris Steffen mourned that it had become [...] "downright painful to hear Tom Araya — at 45 years old! — continue to belt out the band's increasingly self-parodying, anti-religious lyrics," [...] and singled out lyrics such as [...] "Religion's a whore" [...] and [...] "I've <b>made</b> <b>my</b> choice: six six six!" [...] as over the top. Jamie Thomson of The Guardian wrote that the album left [...] "no blasphemy... unuttered", while Peter Atkinson of KNAC.com observed that [...] "when not fixating on religion, the band revisit their other favorite subject — war — in surprisingly familiar terms," [...] and remarked that Slayer had sunk [...] "to the level of God-repelling dunderheads Deicide." [...] He concluded the review with the opinion that [...] "It's déjà {{vu all over again}} from God Hates Us All — and once you've titled something God Hates Us All, haven't you made your point enough already?" ...|$|E
