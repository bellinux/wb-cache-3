500|$|The Russian {{zoologist}} Ilya Ilyich Mechnikov (1845–1916) first {{recognized that}} specialized cells {{were involved in}} defense against microbial infections. In 1882, he studied motile (freely <b>moving)</b> <b>cells</b> in the larvae of starfishes, believing they were important to the animals' immune defenses. To test his idea, he inserted small thorns from a tangerine tree into the larvae. [...] After a few hours {{he noticed that the}} motile cells had surrounded the thorns. Mechnikov traveled to Vienna and shared his ideas with Carl Friedrich Claus who suggested the name ‘‘phagocyte’’ (from the Greek words phagein, meaning [...] "to eat or devour", and kutos, meaning [...] "hollow vessel") for the cells that Mechnikov had observed.|$|E
50|$|<b>Moving</b> <b>cells,</b> such as fibroblasts, are {{arranged}} quite differently. Endocytosis by coated pits occurs, as in stationary cells, at random. But in motile cells exocytosis now {{occurs at the}} front of the cell: It is here that both LDL- and transferrin-receptors emerge from inside the cell and return to the cell surface. As the sites of endocytosis (at random on the cell surface) and exocytosis (at the front edge of the cell) are separated in space, it follows that (within the cell’s context) there is a flow of membrane from the front rearward.|$|E
50|$|Studying cell {{migration}} is important {{from the point}} of view of metastasis, and for this reason, several model organisms are used to determine what molecules are important in initiating, maintaining and guiding <b>moving</b> <b>cells.</b> Drosophila melanogaster is one of the favorite organisms for studying biological phenomena. The border cells of the Drosophila ovary are a genetically tractable system for studying diverse aspects of moving phenotype. After identifying the genes that are important for this phenotype, their homologs can be investigated for putative roles in turning non-invasive cancerous tumors into metastatic ones.|$|E

5000|$|CARM1 (coactivator-associated {{arginine}} methyltransferase 1), {{also known}} as PRMT4 (protein arginine N-methyltransferase 4), is an enzyme (...) encoded by the [...] gene found in human beings, {{as well as many}} other mammals. It has a polypeptide (L) chain type that is 348 residues long, and is made up of alpha helices and beta sheets. Its main function includes catalyzing the transfer of a methyl group from S-adenosyl-L-methionine to the side chain nitrogens of arginine residues within proteins to form methylated arginine derivatives and S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine. CARM1 is a secondary coactivator through its association with p160 family (SRC-1, GRIP1, AIB) of coactivators. It is responsible for <b>moving</b> <b>cells</b> toward the inner cell mass in developing blastocysts.|$|E
50|$|Nucleotides {{also play}} a central role in {{life-form}} metabolism at the fundamental, cellular level. They carry packets of chemical energy—in the form of the nucleoside triphosphates ATP, GTP, CTP and UTP—throughout the cell to the many cellular functions that demand energy, which include synthesizing amino acids, proteins and cell membranes and parts; <b>moving</b> the <b>cell</b> and <b>moving</b> <b>cell</b> parts, both internally and intercellularly; dividing the cell, etc. In addition, nucleotides participate in cell signaling (cGMP and cAMP), and are incorporated into important cofactors of enzymatic reactions (e.g. coenzyme A, FAD, FMN, NAD, and NADP+).|$|R
40|$|Passengers in city buses are {{possibly}} one of {{the main}} contributors to the increase in mobile traffic in cellular networks. Instead of each passenger accessing the cellular base station, we may deploy a small cell on the bus to serve these passengers. To reap the benefits of this deployment in the cellular network, resource allocation of the network needs to be addressed carefully. We call the small cells deployed in city buses as <b>moving</b> small <b>cells.</b> In this paper, we propose a probabilistic graph based resource allocation (PGRA) algorithm in a cellular network with <b>moving</b> small <b>cells.</b> We exploit the headway characteristics of city buses to study the interference relationship between different <b>moving</b> small <b>cells.</b> Our performance metric is the number of resource blocks used.

50|$|Focal adhesions are integrin-containing, multi-protein {{structures}} that form mechanical links between intracellular actin bundles and the extracellular substrate in many cell types. Focal adhesions are large, dynamic protein complexes {{through which the}} cytoskeleton of a cell connects to the ECM. They are limited to clearly defined ranges of the cell, at which the plasma membrane closes to within 15 nm of the ECM substrate. Focal adhesions {{are in a state}} of constant flux: proteins associate and disassociate with it continually as signals are transmitted to other parts of the cell, relating to anything from cell motility to cell cycle. Focal adhesions can contain over 100 different proteins, which suggests a considerable functional diversity. More than anchoring the cell, they function as signal carriers (sensors), which inform the cell about the condition of the ECM and thus affect their behavior. In sessile cells, focal adhesions are quite stable under normal conditions, while in <b>moving</b> <b>cells</b> their stability is diminished: this is because in motile cells, focal adhesions are being constantly assembled and disassembled as the cell establishes new contacts at the leading edge, and breaks old contacts at the trailing edge of the cell. One example of their important role is in the immune system, in which white blood cells migrate along the connective endothelium following cellular signals to damaged biological tissue.|$|E
50|$|The first visible {{stage of}} {{gastrulation}} {{is the creation}} of a concavity on the dorsal side, right under the gray crescent. In this place begins the infiltration of cells of the future mesoderm. From this moment the embryo is called a gastrula, and the concave, visible from outside, is the emerging blastopore. Over the upper edge of the blastopore, called the dorsal lip, a migration of cells occurs, which derive from the central area of the gray crescent. The process of involution takes place - the dorsal lip turns in upon itself. The <b>moving</b> <b>cells</b> enter the blastocoele. As the blastopore deepens, a new embryonic cavity develops, the primitive gut, or the archenteron. It grows in length towards the future front part of the embryo. It can be seen from outside the embryo that the dorsal lip curves itself and grows, creating the side lips of the blastopore. During this time, the paraxial mesoderm enters the embryo. It will change into somitomeres. The bottom of the archenteron is composed of macromeres. They later transform into the gut of the embryo. The ventral lip of the blastopore develops, and the lateral plate mesoderm enters the blastocoel through it. The blastopore develops a ring-like shape, and surrounds the macromeres, creating the yolk sac. The process of involution occurs simultaneously with the process of epiboly, a cell movement associated with the covering of the embryo by the ectoderm. The blastopore gradually closes, and the macromeres, which are endodermal cells, are pulled inside of the embryo (the process of emboly). It {{can be seen from the}} outside as the shrinking of the yolk sac. Near the end of gastrulation, the yolk sac becomes entirely covered by the ectoderm, and the blastopore assumes the shape of a vertical cleavage. The three germ layers form a characteristic shape. The ectoderm is the outermost layer, the mesoderm is the middle one, and the endoderm forms the inside layer. Only in the locations of the future body openings (the mouth and the anus), the endoderm remains in immediate contact with the ectoderm.In the next stage of development, which is known as neurulation, the embryo grows in length in the anterior-posterior axis. The differentiation of the germ layers also occurs.|$|E

40|$|Free-flow {{electrophoresis}} {{allows the}} separation of different cell populations from a cell suspension isolated from rabbit kidney cortex after perfusion of the kidneys with a calcium-binder, followed by gentle mechanical treatment. After electrophoretic separation, analysis of the adenylate cyclase activities after stimulation by various hormones allows the precise determination {{of the origin of}} the cell populations with different electrophoretic mobilities. Adenylate cyclase from the slow-moving main cell population was only sensitive to parathyroid hormone. These cells had also high alkaline phosphatase content, further demonstrating their proximal origin. The various fast- <b>moving</b> <b>cell</b> populations had adenylate cyclase sensitive to isoproterenol and arginine vasopressin but were less sensitive to parathyroid hormone than the slow-moving cells. Their alkaline phosphatase content was also much lower. This indicates that these fast- <b>moving</b> <b>cell</b> populations originate from both the granulous segment of the distal tubule and from the collecting ducts.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{directed}} {{movement of}} human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) {{in a plane}} (Zigmond chamber assay) is described by a statistical model. We demonstrate that (a) the movement of a single cell is a superposition of a directed and a random movement, and (b) the degree of orientation, P 1, of <b>moving</b> <b>cells</b> in a chemotactic gradient can be determined either by the time average of a single cell or by the average of movement of multiple cells at a fixed time (Ergoden hypothesis). However, an homogeneous cell population is a necessary condition. P 1, which is identical with the McCutcheon index, {{is derived from the}} measured angular distribution function of <b>moving</b> <b>cells.</b> The statistical model allows one to distinguish between chemotaxis and chemokinesis. Applying this model to the temperature-dependent changes of cell movement, we found that P 1 = 0. 82 (37 °C) decreased to P 1 = 0. 4 (22 °C). The average speed of <b>moving</b> <b>cells</b> exhibits a very strong temperature-dependent variation from 30 #m/min (37 °C) to 5 /~m/min (22 °C), indicating a different temperature dependence of chemotaxis and chemokinesis. At a fixed temperature (37 °C) the stability of the chemotactic gradient can also be checked by the angular distribution function. In addition, this model was applied to investigate the enteric cytopathogenic human orphan, strain 9 (ECHO 9) virusinduce...|$|E
