40|$|Using beef as {{a typical}} <b>{{mountain}}</b> <b>product,</b> the paper investigates {{the role of the}} mountain origin claim among urban consumers in four Pyrenean bordering regions, in France and Spain, applying a choice experiment. Complementarily, breed, intrinsically linked to beef mountain systems is also studied. An Error Components mixed logit model is estimated and attribute non-attendance is analytically derived. Results suggest that the mountain labeling may have a limited impact on consumption, as it is highly non-attended and its Willingness to Pay is low even after controlling for non-attendance. Nevertheless, preference heterogeneity suggest a feasible niche market in Spain. In contrast, the use of breed as a differentiation claim, not currently used in Spain, could have a more immediate impact on consumers' choices. The paper finds synergies between mountain labelling and other quality schemes. JRC. D. 4 -Economics of Agricultur...|$|E

40|$|Recent {{research}} has demonstrated significant demand for foods from Europe’s mountain areas; the production of these foods delivers significant positive externalities, despite producers facing greater constraints than their lowland equivalents. Existing markets often fail to account for these factors {{due to a lack}} of clear definition of <b>mountain</b> <b>products.</b> This research investigated the current and potential future role of food labelling and certification to support mountain food supply chains and sustainable mountain development, using expert/stakeholder interviews, spatial analysis, and email survey. Results demonstrate that existing EU Geographical Indication schemes are important for marketing mountain foods; however, they are less suitable for small-scale producers. National schemes for certifying <b>mountain</b> <b>products</b> have limited effectiveness, although considerable scope for enhancement exists. Recent EU legislation defining <b>mountain</b> <b>products</b> represents a considerable opportunity; however, challenges and potential trade-offs remain regarding the development of criteria on the location of supply chain stages and environmental factors, certification and control methods, and definition of mountain areas.

Based on this context, the purpose of the paper is to discuss what other marketing alternatives exist for the promotion of <b>mountain</b> quality food <b>products</b> beyond labelling. This is done through the analyses of shelves and postal surveys to retailers, carried out as part of the EU project EuroMARC, which included information for Austria, France, Norway, Romania, Slovenia and UK (Scotland). The analysis concentrates on two product promotion aspects: display and store-promotion, and communication of product attributes.

40|$|With a view {{to making}} the <b>mountain</b> <b>products</b> on the market more clearly {{identifiable}} and less misleading for consumers, the EU institutions legislated on a common definition of an optional quality term, 'mountain product', in the labelling of agricultural products. The term 'mountain product' should only be used for products for which the feed and the raw materials come essentially from mountain areas and for which the processing also takes place in mountain areas. The European Commission will adopt implementing acts setting derogations to the general principles of the new Regulation (EU) No 1151 / 2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 November 2012 on quality schemes for agricultural products and foodstuffs {{in order to take}} into account the specificities of the different sectors involved. In this context, the present report aims to (i) gather and analyse information on the supply chains for agricultural and food <b>products</b> in <b>mountain</b> areas; (ii) review the possible reasons why citizens, stakeholders and consumers need clarity regarding the provenance of mountain products; and (iii) assess past and present labelling practices for <b>mountain</b> <b>products.</b> Flexibility might be sought in the derogations to the rules governing the term 'mountain product' with regards to the exact place where feed is sourced, to the places where agricultural raw material produced in mountain areas are transformed in further processed goods, to the share of non-mountain ingredients within a <b>mountain</b> processed <b>product</b> that may be considered as acceptable. Means for a proper enforcement of the rules and to ensure coexistence between the new optional quality term 'mountain product' and other existing tools, such as trademarks and geographical indications, should be proposed. In absence of derogations, the applicability the optional quality term 'mountain products' would be impaired. JRC. J. 4 -Agriculture and Life Sciences in the Econom...|$|R
40|$|International audienceTerritorial {{labelling}} of <b>mountain</b> food <b>products</b> {{serves as}} a marker of both product quality traits and cultural heritage. In mountain regions, the use of territorial labelling relates to competitiveness of farming enterprises and to the renewed attractiveness and identity of the territorial domain. A wide range of farming practices across European mountains, with a wealth of tradition and know-how, generates a variety of <b>mountain</b> <b>products</b> appreciated by consumers (EuroMARC, 2009; European Commission, 2011). However, farmers face difficulties in valorising this potential marketing advantage and in getting a fair price for their products (European Commission, 2009). The use of quality labels has been proposed as a strategy to resolve this. To help promote their <b>products,</b> <b>mountain</b> actors across Europe {{use a variety of}} quality labels linked to mountain territories. Territorial labels have the potential to structure and govern food chains and are conceptualised as processes of respatialization/relocalization of food systems studied in the literature on origin-based quality in the food sector. This literature contextualises the shift from production to quality-driven system in the specific histories and networks of territories (Allaire & Sylvander, 1997; Allaire, 2002, 2010); it is particularly interested in understanding how the regulatory frames underlying quality labels are shaped by local organisational actors and generate collaborative structures (Allaire, 2002) ...|$|R

Recently, in order to differentiate <b>mountain</b> <b>products</b> and to link them to the breed more present in the territory, the PDO Montasio specification allows to labell products as ‘Mountain Product’ and ‘Only Italian Simmental breed’. A project is in progress with the aim of assessing the economic and technical frame of a possible production system and studying the range of variability of the product qualitative characteristics. In the first phase of the project, one cheese factory with 20 associated dairy farms and one alpine farm, for a total of 350 Italian Simmental cows, were involved. A survey at farm level provided data useful to support a marketing strategy. A first experimental trial focused on the quality of cheese produced from cows grazing on alpine pasture or kept indoors. A more recent study aimed to define the quality of the Montasio cheese in relation to pasture type and level of supplementation. The results of the project within the framework of the increase of product value will be discussed...|$|R

Second, based on a shelves survey collected as part of the EuroMARC, we analyse for several products (apples, sausages, water and cheese) and countries (Austria, France, Norway, Scotland and Slovenia) using a hedonic price regression approach whether a premium is paid for <b>mountain</b> food <b>products</b> in comparison with identified similar non-mountain food products. The results indicate that the answer is mixed and depends on the product and country.
