There are five {{designated}} cultural venues in Lillehammer: Kulturhuset Banken, Lillehammer Art Museum, Lillehammer University College, Maihaugen and the Nansen Academy. The Main Media Centre will be located at <b>Mesna</b> Upper Secondary School, which is adjacent to Stampesletta.|$|E
25|$|The {{ship was}} sold to Victor Jenssens Rederi A/S of Oslo, Norway in 1947 and renamed <b>Mesna.</b> She was then sold to Skibs-A/S Agnes of Mandal two years later and renamed Rona. The ship was broken up in Hamburg, West Germany in December 1958.|$|E
25|$|Standard {{therapy is}} a {{combination}} of limb-salvage orthopedic surgery when possible (or amputation in some cases) and a combination of high-dose methotrexate with leucovorin rescue, intra-arterial cisplatin, adriamycin, ifosfamide with <b>mesna,</b> BCD (bleomycin, cyclophosphamide, dactinomycin), etoposide, and muramyl tripeptide. Rotationplasty may be used. Ifosfamide can be used as an adjuvant treatment if the necrosis rate is low.|$|E
25|$|Just {{like other}} {{municipalities}} of Serbia, New Belgrade is further divided into local communities (Serbian: <b>mesna</b> zajednica). Apart from Bežanija and Staro Sajmište, no other neighbourhoods have historical or traditional names, as Novi Beograd {{did not exist}} as such. However, in the five decades of its existence, some of its parts gradually became known as distinct neighborhoods of their own.|$|E
50|$|It is {{administered}} intravenously or orally (per mouth). The IV <b>mesna</b> infusions {{would be given}} with IV ifosfamide, while oral <b>mesna</b> would be given with oral cyclophosphamide. The oral doses must be double the intravenous (IV) <b>mesna</b> dose due to bioavailability issues. The oral preparation allows patients to leave the hospital sooner, instead of staying four to five days for all the IV <b>mesna</b> infusions.|$|E
50|$|<b>Mesna</b> assists to detoxify these {{metabolites}} by {{reaction of}} its sulfhydryl group with α,β-unsaturated carbonyl containing compounds such as acrolein. This reaction {{is known as}} a Michael addition. <b>Mesna</b> also increases urinary excretion of cysteine.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Mesna</b> {{reduces the}} {{toxicity}} of urotoxic compounds that may form after chemotherapy administration. <b>Mesna</b> is a water-soluble compound with antioxidant properties, and is given concomitantly with the chemotherapeutic agents cyclophosphamide and ifosfamide. <b>Mesna</b> concentrates in the bladder where acrolein accumulates after administration of chemotherapy {{and through a}} Michael addition, forms a conjugate with acrolein and other urotoxic metabolites. [...] This conjugation reaction inactivates the urotoxic compounds to harmless metabolites. The metabolites are then excreted in the urine.|$|E
50|$|<b>Mesna</b> Upper Secondary School (<b>Mesna</b> videregående skole) is one {{of three}} public upper {{secondary}} schools in Lillehammer, Norway. It is located near Stampesletta and was opened on 26 August 1985. During the 2016 Winter Youth Olympics, the school is scheduled to act as the media center.|$|E

50|$|Acetylcysteine {{has been}} used for cyclophosphamide-induced hemorrhagic cystitis, {{although}} <b>mesna</b> is generally preferred due to the ability of acetylcysteine to diminish the effectiveness of cyclophosphamide.|$|E
50|$|Outside North America, <b>mesna</b> is {{also used}} as a {{mucolytic}} agent, working {{in the same way}} as acetylcysteine; it is sold for this indication as Mistabron and Mistabronco.|$|E

50|$|<b>Mesna</b> is used therapeutically {{to reduce}} the {{incidence}} of haemorrhagic cystitis and haematuria when a patient receives ifosfamide or cyclophosphamide for cancer chemotherapy. These two anticancer agents, in vivo, may be converted to urotoxic metabolites, such as acrolein.|$|E
50|$|<b>Mesna,</b> {{sold under}} {{the brand name}} Mesnex among others, is a {{medication}} used in those taking cyclophosphamide or ifosfamide to decrease the risk of bleeding from the bladder. It is used either by mouth or injection into a vein.|$|E

50|$|Unfortunately <b>mesna</b> is {{ineffective}} as {{a treatment}} once hemorrhagic cystitis has developed.

50|$|Standard {{therapy is}} a {{combination}} of limb-salvage orthopedic surgery when possible (or amputation in some cases) and a combination of high-dose methotrexate with leucovorin rescue, intra-arterial cisplatin, adriamycin, ifosfamide with <b>mesna,</b> BCD (bleomycin, cyclophosphamide, dactinomycin), etoposide, and muramyl tripeptide.
