40|$|T-cell {{tolerance}} to the <b>minor</b> <b>lymphocyte-stimulating</b> <b>antigen</b> Mls- 1 a in a T-cell receptor (TcR) V beta 8. 1 transgenic line of mice is maintained by both clonal deletion and clonal anergy. Approximately 20 - 50 % of peripheral CD 4 + (but not CD 8 +) T cells isolated from these mice are anergic {{and fail to}} proliferate following TcR ligation. We have examined key events in T-cell signaling in peripheral T cells isolated from these mice. In this report, we show that the anergic CD 4 + T cells did not mobilize calcium or express receptors for interleukin 2 (IL- 2) following TcR ligation. However, the cells retained viability and functional potential because stimulation with phorbol 12 -myristate 13 -acetate and ionomycin bypassed the block in receptor-mediated signaling and induced IL- 2 receptor expression and proliferation of the anergic cells...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{studies in}} mice have {{highlighted}} {{the importance of}} polymorphic genetic loci such as the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) or <b>minor</b> <b>lymphocyte-stimulating</b> <b>antigen</b> (Mls) in determining {{the nature of the}} peripheral T-cell receptor (TcR) population. As our knowledge of the equivalent process in humans is incomplete, we have utilized a modification of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to determine the overall genetic contribution to the normal human TcR variable V beta gene repertoire. These data demonstrate that the normal human T-cell population contains members of all the major TcR V beta families and that there is considerable variation in the relative amounts of specific TcR V beta transcripts between individuals. We have established that the normal peripheral TcR V beta repertoire is more concordant in identical twins than in unrelated individuals. The relative importance of genetic factors in determining the peripheral TcR repertoire is emphasized by these results and suggests that, in humans, the genetic control of immune responsiveness is mediated in part by the peripheral TcR repertoire...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND/AIMS: Neonatal thymectomy induces {{autoimmune}} gastritis in BALB/c (<b>minor</b> <b>lymphocyte-stimulating</b> <b>antigen</b> [Mls]- 1 b) mice, whereas DBA/ 2 (Mls- 1 a) mice are resistant. Resistance {{has been}} linked to the Mls- 1 a locus, which encodes a retroviral superantigen, and to superantigen reactive T cells that express V beta 6 + T-cell receptors. V beta 6 + T cells are known to be deleted in mice expressing Mls- 1 a superantigens. METHODS: Neonatal thymectomized BALB/c and Mls- 1 a congenic BALB. D 2. Mls- 1 a mice were analyzed to examine directly the role of Mls- 1 a self-superantigens and V beta 6 + T cells in autoimmune gastritis. RESULTS: Autoimmune gastritis was detected in thymectomized BALB. D 2. Mls- 1 a mice with high incidence. Autoantibodies to the gastric H+,K(+) -adenosine triphosphatase were present independent of the Mls phenotype in sera of gastritic mice. Severe gastritis had already appeared 1 month after thymectomy in BALB. D 2. Mls- 1 a mice. V beta 6 + T cells were deleted in the stomach lymph nodes of 1 -month-old gastritic BALB. D 2. Mls- 1 a mice but could be detected by immunocytochemistry in the stomach lesions. CONCLUSIONS: Endogenous Mls- 1 a self-superantigens and Mls- 1 a reactive V beta 6 + T cells are not involved in resistance to autoimmune gastritis in BALB. D 2 mice...|$|E
40|$|Superantigens {{are defined}} by their ability to stimulate a large {{fraction}} of T cells via interaction with the T cell receptor (TCR) V beta domain. Endogenous superantigens, classically termed <b>minor</b> <b>lymphocyte-stimulating</b> (Mls) <b>antigens,</b> were recently identified as products of open reading frames (ORF) in integrated proviral copies of mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV). We have described an infectious MMTV homologue of the classical endogenous superantigen Mls- 1 a (Mtv- 7). The ORF molecules of both the endogenous Mtv- 7 and the infectious MMTV(SW) interact with T cells expressing the TCR V beta 6, 7, 8. 1, and 9 domains. Furthermore, the COOH termini of their ORF molecules, thought to confer TCR specificity, are very similar. Since successful transport of MMTV {{from the site of}} infection in the gut to the mammary gland depends on a functional immune system, we were interested in determining the early events after and requirements for MMTV infection. We show that MMTV(SW) infection induces a massive response of V beta 6 + CDC 4 + T cells, which interact with the viral ORF. Concomitantly, we observed a B cell response and differentiation that depends on both the presence and stimulation of the superantigen-reactive T cells. Furthermore, we show that B cells are the main target of the initial MMTV infection as judged by the presence of the reverse-transcribed viral genome and ORF transcripts. Thus, we suggest that MMTV infection of B cells leads to ORF-mediated B-T cell interaction, which maintains and possibly amplifies viral infection...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} was {{performed}} to identify cells responsible {{for the elimination of}} T cells reactive with <b>minor</b> <b>lymphocyte-stimulating</b> (Mls) <b>antigens</b> during T cell development. Experiments were carried out in a fetal thymus organ culture (FTOC) system. To examine the tolerance- inducing activity, various populations of cells from adult CBA/J (Mls- 1 a) mice were injected into deoxyguanosine (dGuo) -treated FTOC of C 3 H/He (Mls- 1 b) mice with a microinjector, and 2 d later, the thymus lobes were injected with fetal thymus cells from C 3 H/He mice as T cell precursors. After 14 d of cultivation, cells were harvested and assayed for the expression of the T cell receptor V beta 6 element. The absence or marked reduction of T cells expressing V beta 6 at high levels (V beta 6 high) was regarded as indicating the deletion of Mls- 1 a-reactive T cells. T cell-depleted populations of thymic as well as splenic cells from CBA/J mice were able to induce clonal deletion. Further characterization of the effector cells was carried out by fractionating the spleen cells before injecting them into dGuo-FTOC. None of the dish- adherent population, dish-nonadherent population, or purified B cells alone were able to induce clonal deletion, whereas the addition of purified B cells to adherent cells restored tolerance inducibility. It was further shown that a combination of CBA/J B cells and C 3 H/He dendritic cells was effective in eliminating Mls-reactive clones. These results indicate that for the deletion of clones reactive with Mls antigens during T cell development in the thymus, both DC and B cells are required...|$|R
40|$|Experimental {{conditions}} whereby T-cell tolerance can {{be established}} and maintained have been investi-gated and defined in many systems. However, the mechanisms of tolerance in these systems and their relevance to tolerance induction during normal T-cell development i vivo is still not fully understood. In vivo evidence for clonal deletion has been documented re-cently, {{made possible by the}} development of mono-clonal antibodies (MAbs) to T-cell receptor (TCR) V~ chains and by the observation that certain (variable) V, chains are associated with reactivity to I-E (Kappler et al. 1987 b) and <b>minor</b> <b>lymphocyte-stimulating</b> a tigens (Mls) (Kappler et al. 1988; MacDonald et al. 1988).

40|$|We have {{recently}} shown that {{recognition of the}} mouse mammary tumor virus 9 -associated superantigen (vSAG- 9) by murine V beta 17 + T cells is strongly influenced by the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II haplotype of the presenting cells, resulting in a form of MHC- restricted recognition. This finding was unexpected, because T cell recognition of another well-characterized retroviral superantigen, <b>minor</b> <b>lymphocyte-stimulating</b> <b>antigen</b> 1 (Mls- 1), had {{been shown to be}} independent of the MHC haplotype of the presenting cell. To determine whether recognition of vSAG- 9 and Mls- 1 is fundamentally different, we undertook an extensive analysis of MHC haplotype influences on vSAG- 9 and Mls- 1 recognition by panels of T cell hybridomas. Our results show that, although most hybridomas recognized Mls- 1 regardless of the MHC haplotype of the presenting cells, as previously described by others, some hybridomas exhibited unique patterns of MHC fine specificity. Thus, T cell recognition of vSAG- 9 and Mls- 1 is not fundamentally different, but the apparent differences can be explained in terms of frequency. The MHC fine specificity of individual Mls- 1 -reactive hybridomas was influenced by both V beta and non-V beta T cell receptor (TCR) elements. First, the influence of the V beta element was apparent from the observation that V beta 8. 2 + hybridomas were significantly more MHC specific in their recognition of Mls- 1 than V beta 8. 1 hybridomas. Second, a role for the TCR alpha chain was implicated from the distinct patterns of fine specificity of Mls- 1 reactivity among a panel of transgenic hybridomas that expressed an identical beta chain (V beta 8. 1 D beta 2 J beta 2. 3 C beta 2). Sequence analysis revealed that junctional residues of the TCR alpha chain and/or V alpha/J alpha combinations influenced the MHC haplotype fine specificity for Mls- 1. Third, D beta J beta influences were implicated, in that the transgenic hybridomas expressed distinctive patterns of Mls- 1 fine specificity not represented among V beta 8. 1 + nontransgenic hybridomas. The findings that T cell recognition of endogenous superantigen is MHC specific, and that this specificity correlates with non-V beta elements of the TCR, support the hypothesis that there is a direct interaction between the TCR and either polymorphic residues of the MHC class II molecule or haplotype-specific dominant peptides presented by class II...|$|E
40|$|We have derived a T {{cell clone}} that recognizes and {{responds}} to three {{different types of}} antigen: self + X (fowl gamma globulin + H- 2 d), allo- H- 2 p,b, and <b>minor</b> <b>lymphocyte-stimulating</b> (Mlsa,d) determinants. Anti- TcR mAb and their F(ab') 2 and Fab fragments were tested for their capacity to block the response of this clone. When responses were assayed on day 4 or later, addition of KJ 16 or F 23. 1 mAb caused a marked inhibition of the response {{to each of the}} three antigens recognized by the clone. Responses measured at earlier time points however were unaffected or enhanced. This finding suggested that the inhibitory effects of anti-TcR mAb that followed the phase of enhancement might have reflected downregulation of the cells rather than simple blockade of TcR. In support of this possibility it was found that addition of anti-TcR mAb caused marked inhibition of the response of the clone to IL- 2, i. e., a response that is not known to involve the TcR...|$|R
40|$|Although typical mixed {{lymphocyte}} reactions (MLR) 1 {{are directed}} predominantly to H- 2 determinants, high primary MLR in mice {{can also be}} elicited by gene products of the <b>minor</b> <b>lymphocyte-stimulating</b> (Mls) locus located on chromosome 1 (1). Of the four described Mls alleles, a b c d, Mis a and Mls d determinants elicit the strongest response. Since these two sets of determinants cross-react extensively (and are probably indistinguishable), we shall {{refer to them as}} "Mls a'd determinants " (2). Mis a'd determinants are of interest for at least three reasons. Firstly, in our hands the T cell response to these determinants does not exhibit H- 2 restriction (3, 4) (although others disagree with this viewpoint [5]). Secondly, from studies on karyotypically unstable hybridomas prepared from a dual-reactive T cell clone, we have preliminary evidence that the receptors for allo-H- 2 and Mls a'd determinants are encoded on different chromosomes. 2 Thirdly, the expression of MIs a'd determinants appears to define one of the two subsets of B cells, namely the "mature " B cells, which develop late in ontogeny and express Lyb 5 surfac...|$|R
40|$|The {{present report}} has {{evaluated}} the differentiation compartment in which T cells are tolerized to non-major histocompatibility complex (MHC) -encoded <b>minor</b> <b>lymphocyte-stimulating</b> locus (MLS) alloantigens. It was observed that T cell precursors are not tolerized prethymically to MLS alloantigens but are tolerized intrathymically and postthymically to MLS alloantigens. The failure of prethymic T cells to be tolerized indicates either that T cell precursors {{are unable to}} be tolerized to MLS alloantigens or that cells in the prethymic compartment are unable to induce MLS-specific tolerance. In either case, these results demonstrate that the thymus is the initial site in which T cell tolerance to MLS alloantigen is induced. The present results also demonstrate a striking disparity in the reactivity of thymocytes to MHC and MLS alloantigens expressed in the extrathymic host through which their precursors had migrated. In the experimental mice constructed for these studies, intrathymic T cells were tolerant to the MHC alloantigens but were reactive to the MLS alloantigens expressed by the extrathymic host. This observation {{is consistent with the}} concept that T cell precursors may be tolerized to MHC alloantigens at an earlier point in their differentiation than they are tolerized to non-MHC- encoded MLS alloantigens...|$|R
40|$|CBA/N mice, a mutant subline of the CBA/Ca strain, have an X-linked B lymphocyte-immune defect. These {{mice and}} F 1 male progeny derived from CBA/N females {{fail to produce}} {{specific}} antibody after immunization with certain thymicindependent (TI) antigens (1 - 4). In addition, these mice fail to produce IgM or IgG responses to either the TI or T-dependent derivatives of the hapten phosphorylcholine (PC) (5, 6). Moreover, analysis of surface membrane characteristics indicates that B cells derived from immune defective mice fail to express determinants that are present on a population of B lymphocytes that appears late in ontogeny. These include <b>minor</b> <b>lymphocyte-stimulating</b> determinants (7), Lyb 5 (8), and Lyb 3 (9). Furthermore, the B cells of CBA/N mice have unusually high amounts of surface IgM (sIgM) and exhibit a low ratio of surface 8 :/ ~ heavy chains {{when compared with the}} B cells of normal mice (10, 11). These surface characteristics are similar to those that are exhibited by neonatal B cells (10).

40|$|Recent {{investigations}} in mice revealed that natural immunological tolerance to endogenous <b>minor</b> <b>lymphocyte-stimulating</b> locus 1 a (MIs- 1 a) antigen correlates primarily with deletion of MIs- 1 a-specific V beta 6 + T lymphocytes in the thymus. Similar mechanisms account for acquired tolerance {{in some instances}} since the neonatal injection of MIs- 1 a-expressing MHC compatible cells in neonatal mice within the first 24 h of life causes clonal deletion of V beta 6 + T cells. Here we demonstrate that V beta 6 + T cells are not deleted in mice neonatally treated with MIs- 1 a spleen cells expressing allogeneic H- 2 molecules. However, when such non-deleted V beta 6 + T cells were tested in vitro, no interleukin 2 (IL- 2) secretion or proliferation was observed after MIs- 1 a stimulation. This non-responsive state could be overcome by addition of exogenous IL- 2, consistent {{with the fact that}} V beta 6 + cells enlarged and expressed IL- 2 receptors upon MIs- 1 a stimulation. Furthermore, the same neonatally treated mice showed in vitro functional unresponsiveness of cytotoxic T cells but not of IL- 2 -secreting cells specific for the tolerated allogeneic MHC antigens. Taken together, our data indicate that neonatal tolerance to MIs- 1 a can be accomplished by either clonal deletion or clonal anergy, and that it does not necessarily correlate with tolerance to MHC determinants...|$|R
40|$|Differential {{expression}} of surface markers can frequently {{be used to}} distinguish functional subsets of T cells, yet a surface phenotype unique to T cells induced into an anergic state has not been described. Here, we report that CD 4 T cells rendered anergic in vivo by superantigen can be identified by loss of the 6 C 10 T cell marker. Inoculation of Vβ 8. 1 T cell antigen receptor (TCR) transgenic mice with a Vβ 8. 1 -reactive <b>minor</b> <b>lymphocyte-stimulating</b> superantigen (Mls- 1 a) induces tolerance to Mls- 1 a by clonal anergy. CD 4 lymph node T cells from Mls- 1 a inoculated transgenic mice enriched for the 6 C 10 − phenotype neither proliferate nor produce interleukin- 2 upon TCR engagement, whereas 6 C 10 + CD 4 T cells retain responsiveness. Analysis of T cell memory markers demonstrate that 6 C 10 − T cells remain 3 G 11 hi but express heterogeneous levels of CD 45 RB, CD 62 L, CD 44, and the CD 69 early activation marker, suggesting that T cells at various degrees of activation can be functionally anergic.

40|$|The {{interactions}} between CD 40 on B cells and its ligand gp 39 on activated T helper cells {{are known to}} be essential for the development of thymus-dependent humoral immunity. However, CD 40 is also functionally expressed on thymic epithelial cells and dendritic cells, suggesting that gp 39 -CD 40 interactions may also play a role in thymic education, the process by which self-reactive cells are deleted from the T cell repertoire. Six systems of negative selection were studied for their reliance on gp 39 -CD 40 interactions to mediate negative selection. In all cases, when the antigen/superantigen was endogenously expressed (in contrast to exogenously administered), negative selection was blocked by loss of gp 39 function. Specifically, blockade of gp 39 -CD 40 interactions prevented the deletion of thymocytes expressing V[33, V[311, and V[312, specificities normally deleted in BALB/c mice because of the endogenous expression of <b>minor</b> <b>lymphocyte-stimulating</b> determinants. Independent verification of a role of gp 39 in negative selection was provided by studies in gp 39 -deficient mice where alterations in T cell receptor (TCP,) V[3 expression were also observed.

40|$|To {{study the}} {{mechanisms}} of tolerance in detail, we have constructed transgenic mice expressing a V beta 8. 1 -D beta 2 -J beta 2. 3 -C beta 2 T-cell receptor (TCR) gene. Since expression of V beta 8. 1 is known to correlate with reactivity of CD 4 +CD 8 - T cells to <b>minor</b> <b>lymphocyte-stimulating</b> locus 1 a (Mls- 1 a), we expected to induce tolerance in most CD 4 +CD 8 - T cells in V beta 8. 1 transgenic mice of the Mls- 1 a allele. In one line of Mls- 1 b V beta 8. 1 transgenic mice, the V beta 8. 1 TCR was expressed on greater than 98 % of mature T cells and their response to Mls- 1 a was highly enriched. In Mls- 1 a V beta 8. 1 transgenic mice, CD 4 +CD 8 - T cells in these mice were severely reduced among both peripheral T cells and thymocytes. However, the deletion of these cells was not complete, {{and most of the}} residual CD 4 +CD 8 - mature T cells still expressed normal densities of V beta 8. 1 TCR. The residual CD 4 +CD 8 - T cells did not respond to Mls- 1 a but were still able to proliferate in response to other stimuli via the TCR. Interestingly, CD 4 +CD 8 - V beta 8. 1 + T-cell clones isolated from Mls- 1 a V beta 8. 1 transgenic mice could respond to Mls- 1 a.

40|$|In {{addition}} to the major intrathymic pathway of T cell differentiation, extrathymic pathways of such differentiation {{have been shown to}} exist in the liver and intestine. In particular, hepatic T cells of T cell receptors or CD 3 of intermediate levels (i. e., intermediate T cell receptor cells) always contain self-reactive clones and sometimes appear at other sites, including the target tissues in autoimmune diseases and the tumor sites in malignancies. To prove their extrathymic origin and self reactivity, in this study we used thymectomized, irradiated (B 6 x C 3 H/He) F 1 mice subjected to transplantation of bone marrow cells of B 6 mice. It was clearly demonstrated that all T cells generated under athymic conditions in the peripheral immune organs are intermediate CD 3 cells. In the case of nonthymectomized irradiated mice, not only intermediate CD 3 cells but also high CD 3 cells were generated. Phenotypic characterization showed that newly generated intermediate CD 3 cells were unique (e. g., interleukin 2 receptor alpha-/beta+ and CD 44 + L-selectin-) and were, therefore, distinguishable from thymus-derived T cells. The precursor cells of intermediate CD 3 cells in the bone marrow were Thy- 1 + CD 3 -.

40|$|Murine T cells {{respond to}} at least three {{different}} types of antigens: (a) H- 2 alloantigens, (b) conventional antigens seen in association with self H- 2 determinants (self + X), and (c) <b>minor</b> <b>lymphocyte-stimulating</b> (Mls) determinants. The fact that individual T cell clones can respond to three diverse types of antigens raises the question whether recognition of these antigens involves one, or more than one, type of T cell receptor (TcR) molecule. With the availability of monoclonal antibodies (mAb) specific for allotypic determinants of the TcR a-,Q heterodimer, e. g., KJ 16 (1) and F 23. 1 (2), it has been possible to examine whether such antibodies can inhibit the response of dual-reactive T cell clones, i. e., clones reactive {{with more than one}} of the above classes of antigens. The invariable finding has been that anti-TcR antibodies, including anticlonotype antibodies, are able to inhibit responsiveness of dual-reactive clones and hybridomas to both ligands (1, 3 - 6). These data have been interpreted as providing strong support for the view that T cell specificity for all three classes of antigens is controlled by a single set of TcR molecules. We show here that KJ 16 and F 23. 1 mAb each inhibited the responses of a triple-reactive T cell clone to all three classes of antigens. Significantly, however, the anti-TcR mAb also inhibited the response of the clone to IL- 2, a ligand that is not recognized by the TcR. These data suggest that the blocking effects of anti-TcR antibodies must be interpreted with considerable caution. Materials and Methods Mice. B 10. P, B 10.
