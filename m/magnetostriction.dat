5|$|Dysprosium {{is one of}} the {{components}} of Terfenol-D, along with iron and terbium. Terfenol-D has the highest room-temperature <b>magnetostriction</b> of any known material; which is employed in transducers, wide-band mechanical resonators, and high-precision liquid-fuel injectors.|$|E
5|$|Nickel is a {{naturally}} magnetostrictive material, meaning that, {{in the presence}} of a magnetic field, the material undergoes a small change in length. The <b>magnetostriction</b> of nickel is on the order of 50ppm and is negative, indicating that it contracts.|$|E
25|$|Uranium dioxide is {{also the}} strongest known piezomagnet in the antiferromagnetic state {{observed}} at cryogenic temperatures below 30 degrees Kelvin. UO2 displays a linear <b>magnetostriction</b> that changes sign with {{the sign of the}} applied magnetic field, and magnetoelastic memory switching at magnetic fields near 180,000 Oe.|$|E
25|$|The SI {{derived unit}} of energy, the joule, {{is named after}} James Joule. He worked with Lord Kelvin to develop the {{absolute}} scale of temperature, which {{came to be called}} the Kelvin scale. Joule also made observations of <b>magnetostriction,</b> and he found the relationship between the current through a resistor and the heat dissipated, which is also called Joule's first law.|$|E
25|$|Magnetostrictive transducers, {{based on}} <b>magnetostriction,</b> have been {{predominantly}} used as sonar ultrasonic sound wave radiators, but their use has spread also to audio speaker systems. Magnetostrictive speaker drivers have some special advantages: {{they can provide}} greater force (with smaller excursions) than other technologies; low excursion can avoid distortions from large excursion as in other designs; the magnetizing coil is stationary and therefore more easily cooled; they are robust because delicate suspensions and voice coils are not required. Magnetostrictive speaker modules have been produced by Fostex and FeONIC and subwoofer drivers have also been produced.|$|E
25|$|Transducer {{technologies}} employed much less commonly for headphones include the Heil Air Motion Transformer (AMT); Piezoelectric film; Ribbon planar magnetic; <b>Magnetostriction</b> and Plasma-ionisation. The first Heil AMT headphone was marketed by ESS Laboratories and was essentially an ESS AMT tweeter {{from one of}} the company's speakers being driven at full range. Since the turn of the century, only Precide of Switzerland have manufactured an AMT headphone. Piezoelectric film headphones were first developed by Pioneer, their two models both used a flat sheet of film which limited the maximum volume of air that could be moved. Currently TakeT produce a piezoelectric film headphone which is shaped not unlike an AMT transducer but which like the driver Precide uses for their headphones, has a variation in the size of transducer folds over the diaphragm. It additionally incorporates a two way design by its inclusion of a dedicated tweeter/supertweeter panel. The folded shape of a diaphragm allows a transducer with a larger surface area to fit within smaller space constraints. This increases the total volume of air that can be moved on each excursion of the transducer given that radiating area.|$|E

2500|$|<b>Magnetostriction</b> headphones, {{sometimes}} {{sold under}} {{the label of}} [...] "Bonephones", are headphones that work via the transmission of vibrations {{against the side of}} head, transmitting the sound via bone conduction. This is particularly helpful in situations where the ears must be left unobstructed or when used by those who are deaf for reasons which do not affect the nervous apparatus of hearing. <b>Magnetostriction</b> headphones though, have greater limitations to their fidelity than conventional headphones which work via the normal workings of the ear. Additionally, there was also one attempt to market a plasma-ionisation headphone in the early 1990s by a French company called Plasmasonics. It is believed that there are no functioning examples left.|$|E
2500|$|... 50Hz/60Hz CRTs {{used for}} {{television}} operate with horizontal scanning frequencies of 15,734Hz (for NTSC systems) or 15,625Hz (for PAL systems). These frequencies {{are at the}} upper range of human hearing and are inaudible to many people; however, some people (especially children) will perceive a high-pitched tone near an operating television CRT. The sound is due to <b>magnetostriction</b> in the magnetic core and periodic movement of windings of the flyback transformer.|$|E
2500|$|Miller {{worked on}} {{increasingly}} larger interferometers, culminating in {{one with a}} [...] (effective) arm length that he tried at various sites, including {{on top of a}} mountain at the Mount Wilson Observatory. To avoid the possibility of the aether wind being blocked by solid walls, his mountaintop observations used a special shed with thin walls, mainly of canvas. From noisy, irregular data, he consistently extracted a small positive signal that varied with each rotation of the device, with the sidereal day, and on a yearly basis. His measurements in the 1920s amounted to approximately [...] instead of the nearly [...] expected from the Earth's orbital motion alone. He remained convinced this was due to partial entrainment or aether dragging, though he did not attempt a detailed explanation. He ignored critiques demonstrating the inconsistency of his results and the refutation by the Hammar experiment. Miller's findings were considered important at the time, and were discussed by Michelson, Lorentz and others at a meeting reported in 1928. There was general agreement that more experimentation was needed to check Miller's results. Miller later built a non-magnetic device to eliminate <b>magnetostriction,</b> while Michelson built one of non-expanding Invar to eliminate any remaining thermal effects. Other experimenters from around the world increased accuracy, eliminated possible side effects, or both. So far, no one has been able to replicate Miller's results, and modern experimental accuracies have ruled them out. Roberts (2006) has pointed out that the primitive data reduction techniques used by Miller and other early experimenters, including Michelson and Morley, were capable of creating apparent periodic signals even when none existed in the actual data. After reanalyzing Miller's original data using modern techniques of quantitative error analysis, Roberts found Miller's apparent signals to be statistically insignificant.|$|E

50|$|A {{ferromagnetic}} material {{will have a}} dimensional change when an external magnetic field is applied. This effect is called <b>magnetostriction.</b> The flux field of a magnet expands or collapses depends on the arrangement of {{ferromagnetic material}} having inducing voltage in a coil {{and the amount of}} change is affected by the magnitude and direction of the field. The AC current in the electric coil induces an AC magnetic field and thus produces <b>magnetostriction</b> at ultrasonic frequency in the material. The disturbances caused by <b>magnetostriction</b> then propagate in the material as an ultrasound wave.|$|E

50|$|In {{polycrystalline}} material, the <b>magnetostriction</b> {{response is}} very complicated. It {{is affected by}} direction of the bias field, direction of the field from AC electric coil, the strength of bias field, and the amplitude of the AC current. In some cases, one or two peak response may be observed {{with the increase of}} bias field. In some cases, the response can be improved significantly with the change of relative direction between bias magnetic field and AC magnetic field. Quantitatively, the <b>magnetostriction</b> may be described in a similar mathematical format as piezoelectric constants. Empirically, a lot of experience is needed to fully understand the <b>magnetostriction</b> phenomenon.|$|E

50|$|The magnetocrystalline {{anisotropy}} {{parameters are}} generally defined for ferromagnets that are constrained to remain undeformed as {{the direction of}} magnetization changes. However, coupling between the magnetization and the lattice does result in deformation, an effect called <b>magnetostriction.</b> To keep the lattice from deforming, a stress must be applied. If the crystal is not under stress, <b>magnetostriction</b> alters the effective magnetocrystalline anisotropy. If a ferromagnet is single domain (uniformly magnetized), the effect {{is to change the}} magnetocrystalline anisotropy parameters.|$|E

5000|$|Electromagnetic {{forces in}} the {{presence}} of a magnetic field include equivalent forces due to Maxwell stress tensor, <b>magnetostriction</b> and Lorentz force (also called Laplace force). Maxwell forces, also called reluctances forces, are concentrated at the interface of high magnetic reluctivity changes, e.g. between air and a ferromagnetic material in electric machines they are also responsible of the attraction or repulsion of two magnets facing each other. <b>Magnetostriction</b> forces are concentrated inside the ferromagnetic material itself. Lorentz or Laplace forces act on conductors plunged in an external magnetic field.|$|E
5000|$|Piezomagnetism {{differs from}} the related {{property}} of magnetostriction; if an applied magnetic field is reversed in direction, the strain produced changes signs. Additionally, a non-zero piezomagnetic moment can be produced by mechanical strain alone, at zero field - {{this is not true}} of <b>magnetostriction.</b> According to IEEE: [...] "Piezomagnetism is the linear magnetomechanical effect analogous to the linear electromechanical effect of piezoelectricity. Similarly, <b>magnetostriction</b> and electrostriction are analogous second-order effects. These higher-order effects can be represented as effectively first-order when variations in the system parameters are small compared with the initial values of the parameters".|$|E
50|$|There are two {{mechanisms}} to generate waves through magnetic field interaction. One is Lorentz force when {{the material is}} conductive. The other is <b>magnetostriction</b> when the material is ferromagnetic.|$|E
