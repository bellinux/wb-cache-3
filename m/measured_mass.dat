5|$|A {{limitation}} of the radial velocity method used to detect Gliese 876 c is that only a lower limit on the planet's mass can be obtained. This is because the <b>measured</b> <b>mass</b> value depends on the inclination of the orbit, which is not determined by the radial velocity measurements. However, in a resonant system such as Gliese 876, gravitational interactions between the planets {{can be used to}} determine the true masses. Using this method, the inclination of the orbit can be determined, revealing the planet's true mass to be 0.72 times that of Jupiter.|$|E
5|$|The mass of Gliese 876 d from radial {{velocity}} has one problem, {{it is that}} only a lower limit on the mass can be obtained. This is because the <b>measured</b> <b>mass</b> value also depends on the orbital inclination, which in general is unknown. However, models incorporating the gravitational interactions between the resonant outer planets enables the inclination of the orbits to be determined. This reveals that the outer planets are nearly coplanar with an inclination of around 59° {{with respect to the}} plane of the sky. Assuming that Gliese 876 d orbits in the same plane as the other planets, the true mass of the planet is revealed to be 6.83 times the mass of Earth.|$|E

25|$|The {{masses of}} the gases to be mixed must be {{calculated}} based on the final partial pressure ratio and total pressure, and the cylinder is filled to the appropriate weight corresponding to the added weight of each component. The advantage of this system is that temperature {{does not affect the}} accuracy, as pressure is not measured during the process. The disadvantage is that helium has a much lower density than the other components, and a small error in <b>measured</b> <b>mass</b> of helium will result in a relatively large error in composition.|$|E
25|$|The protein’s whole mass {{is the sum}} of {{the masses}} of its amino-acid {{residues}} plus the mass of a water molecule and adjusted for any post-translational modifications. Although proteins ionize less well than the peptides derived from them, a protein in solution may be able to be subjected to ESI-MS and its mass measured to an accuracy of 1 part in 20,000 or better. This is often sufficient to confirm the termini (thus that the protein’s <b>measured</b> <b>mass</b> matches that predicted from its sequence) and infer {{the presence or absence of}} many post-translational modifications.|$|E
500|$|The {{present day}} {{shape of the}} {{universe}} has been determined from measurements of {{the cosmic microwave background}} using satellites like the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe. These observations indicate that the observable universe is [...] "flat", meaning that photons on parallel paths at one point will remain parallel as they travel through space to the limit of the observable universe, except for local gravity. The flat Universe, combined with the <b>measured</b> <b>mass</b> density of the Universe and the accelerating expansion of the Universe, indicates that space has a non-zero vacuum energy, which is called dark energy.|$|E

2500|$|Information {{including}} the <b>measured</b> <b>mass</b> of the putative peptide ions {{and those of}} their fragment ions is then matched against calculated mass values from the conceptual (in-silico) proteolysis and fragmentation of databases of protein sequences. A successful match will be found if its score exceeds a threshold based on the analysis parameters. Even if the actual protein is not represented in the database, error-tolerant matching allows for the putative identification of a protein based on similarity to homologous proteins. A variety of software packages are available to perform this analysis.|$|E

[...] Specifically, the quantity measured through lensing is the total (or virial) mass to light ratio – again due to the insensitivity of lensing to matter type. [...] Assuming that luminous matter can trace dark matter, this quantity is of particular importance, since measuring the ratio of luminous (baryonic) matter to total matter can provide information regarding the overall ratio of baryonic to dark matter in the universe.|$|E
