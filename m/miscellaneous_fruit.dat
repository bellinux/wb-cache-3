50|$|Bangladesh imports mainly red lentils, cereals, edible oil, oil seeds, <b>miscellaneous</b> <b>fruit</b> items, fertilizer, {{mechanical}} appliances, wood pulp, paper/paperboard, scraps, and optical, medical, {{scientific and}} technical instruments from Canada. Bangladesh is the second largest importer of Canadian food grains and other agricultural products in South Asia. Moreover, potential areas of trade from Bangladesh to Canada are shipbuilding, pharmaceuticals, leather and leather goods and IT.|$|E
40|$|Botrytis cinerea is a mold {{responsible}} for fruit rot in many fruit plants. Grapes {{are susceptible to}} this fungus. Generally it causes bunch rot commonly known as botrytis rot or grey rot. It also creates conditions favorable {{for the growth of}} other spoilage organisms. Botrytis and a mix of other microorganisms including yeast, mold, and bacteria are involved in <b>miscellaneous</b> <b>fruit</b> rots. Under certain ideal microclimatic conditions the fungus causes noble rot, which is {{responsible for}} the production of some of the world's finest sweet white wines. It is important to realize that the same fungus (botrytis) can cause noble rot or ignoble rot depending on the conditions of development. Development of Noble Rot Temperature and humidity are the two critical factors influencing the development of noble rot. During the infection phase, a temperature of 20 - 25 °C and a relative humidity of 85 - 95 % for a maximum of 24 hours are considered desirable. Once the infection has occurred the relative humidity should drop below 60 %. This drop in humidity is a key factor in dehydration of the infected berries...|$|E
40|$|The feeding {{habits of}} the maned wolf were studied in {{southeast}} Brazil to understand its response towards changes in the environment and in relation to its prey. By occurrence, <b>miscellaneous</b> <b>fruits,</b> small mammals and wolf`s fruit were the most consumed items. Armadillos, small mammals and wolf`s fruit (Solanum lycocarpum) provided most of the ingested biomass. While wolf`s fruit and small mammals were mainly consumed in the dry season, other <b>miscellaneous</b> <b>fruits</b> were taken mostly in the wet season. There was selectivity in the predation on some small mammal species. The maned wolf`s diet followed patterns {{similar to those found}} in more pristine areas.

40|$|This {{work was}} carried out in the farm of the Military Brigade in the city of Itaara, RS, Brazil. The present work has as main {{objective}} to evaluate the estimate of litter fall in Seasonal Deciduous Forest. For the litter collection, six  plots of 25 m x 17 m had been demarcated, placed in the forest. In each plot, five litter traps had been distributed, totalizing 30 traps. The litter collections had been carried out monthly, during a period of 2 years (December of 2002 to November of 2004). In the laboratory, the material was separated in fractions, leaves, small twigs and <b>miscellaneous</b> (flowers, <b>fruits,</b> seeds and residues not identified). During the two years of collection, it could be observed great litter deposition in the {{in the beginning of the}} winter and mainly in the spring with the biggest depositions during September and November, indicating a standard seasonal in this forest.   The leaves had been responsible for 71. 3 % of the composition of the litter, the fine twigs had contributed with 16. 7 %, and the miscellany with the lesser ratio of 12. 1 %, in the two years of collection. A significant correlation between the litter deposition and the climatic variables was not verified. </p...|$|R
