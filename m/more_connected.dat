5|$|Adventures of Mana is {{a remake}} of the 1991 Game Boy game Final Fantasy Adventure, {{which was the first}} entry in the Mana series. It is the second remake of Final Fantasy Adventure, the first being the Game Boy Advance game Sword of Mana, which had removed the {{connections}} to the Final Fantasy series in favor of being <b>more</b> <b>connected</b> {{to the rest of the}} Mana series. According to Adventures of Manas producer, Masaru Oyamada, the development team focused on not upsetting what had made the original game good, while adding things that had not been possible to do in the original version due to hardware limitations; they also aimed to make the game more comfortable and intuitive to play: for instance, switching armor and weapons and using items and magic was made easier, and shortcut commands were added. The game borrows some elements from the original Game Boy version, and some from Sword of Mana. For example, the first remake introduced the ability to play as the heroine, but Adventures of Mana, like the original, only has a male playable character; conversely Adventures of Manas battle system, user interface and sword attack are based on Sword of Manas rather than the original's. Kenji Ito, the composer for Final Fantasy Adventure, returned to create updated and more dramatic rearrangements for the remake.|$|E

However, widespread infighting by older and <b>more</b> <b>connected</b> officials made the Politburo turn to Ceaușescu, as a compromise candidate. He was elected general secretary on 22 March 1965, three days after Gheorghiu-Dej's death.|$|E

25|$|While Böckten {{has grown}} {{together}} with Gelterkinden during the 1980s and 1990s, it remains separate from Sissach to this day. Nevertheless, it is mainly attached to Sissach in administrative matters (e.g. school system, church). Its location between these bigger municipalities, that both possess an express train railway station, makes Böckten much <b>more</b> <b>connected</b> {{to the nearby}} centers (most notably Basel and Liestal) than most other localities of comparable size.|$|E

25|$|During World War II, when Germany invaded Denmark, Greenlanders became {{socially}} and economically less connected to Denmark and <b>more</b> <b>connected</b> to the United States and Canada. After the war, Denmark resumed control of Greenland and in 1953, converted its status from colony to overseas amt (county). Although Greenland {{is still a}} part of the Kingdom of Denmark, it has enjoyed home rule since 1979. In 1985, the island decided to leave the European Union, which it had joined as a part of Denmark in 1973; the Faroes had never joined.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we build}} an {{aggregate}} demand model for air passenger traffic in a hub-and-spoke network. This model considers {{the roles of}} airline service variables such as service frequency, aircraft size, ticket price, flight distance, and number of spokes in the network. It also {{takes into account the}} influence of local passengers and social-economic and demographic conditions in the spoke and hub metropolitan areas. The hub airport capacity, which has a significant impact on service quality in the hub airport and in the whole hub-and-spoke network, is also taken into consideration. Our demand model reveals that airlines can attract <b>more</b> <b>connecting</b> passengers in a hub-and-spoke network by increasing service frequency than by increasing aircraft size in the same percentage. Our research confirms the importance of local service to connecting passengers, and finds that, interestingly, airlines' services in the first flight leg are more important to attract passengers than those in the second flight segment. Based on data in this study, we also find that a 1 % reduction of ticket price will bring about 0. 9 % <b>more</b> <b>connecting</b> passengers, and a 1 % increase of airport acceptance rate can bring about 0. 35 % <b>more</b> <b>connecting</b> passengers in the network, with all else equal. These findings are helpful for airlines to understand the effects of changing their services, and also useful for us to quantify the benefits of hub airport expansion projects. At the end of this paper, we give an example as an application to demonstrate how the developed demand model could be used to valuate passengers' direct benefit from airport capacity expansion. ...|$|R

25|$|Vaishnavas {{mark their}} foreheads with tilaka, {{either as a}} daily ritual, or on special occasions. The {{different}} Vaishnava sampradayas each have their own distinctive style of tilaka, which depicts the siddhanta of their particular lineage. The general tilaka pattern is of a parabolic shape resembling the letter U or two or <b>more</b> <b>connected</b> vertical lines on and another optional line on the nose resembling the letter Y, which usually represents the foot of Vishnu and the centre vertical line symbolizing his manhood. Alternate interpretations suggest that the symbol is representation {{of male and female}} parts in union.|$|E
25|$|As the {{practice}} of vaccination was introduced and showed its effectiveness, patients began to have more confidence in medical healing. In 1781, the responsibility for medical care was formally transferred from church authority to the medical profession; patients were no longer admitted to the Hôtel-Dieu except for medical treatment, and doctors insisted that the medical treatment be scientific, not just spiritual. As medical schools became <b>more</b> <b>connected</b> to hospitals, the bodies of patients were seen as objects of medical observation used to study and teach pathological anatomy, rather than just bodies in need of hospital care.|$|E
25|$|In {{designing}} the Mystics, Froud portrayed {{them as being}} <b>more</b> <b>connected</b> to the natural world than their Skeksis counterparts. Henson intended to convey {{the idea that they}} were purged of all materialistic urges, yet were incapable of acting in the real world. Froud also incorporated geometric symbolism throughout the film in order to hint at the implied unity of the two races. The Mystics were the hardest creatures to perform, as the actors had to walk on their haunches with their right arm extended forward, with the full weight of the head on it. Henson himself could hold a position in a Mystic costume for only 5–10 seconds.|$|E

25|$|Harkers Island {{gradually}} became <b>more</b> <b>connected</b> to North Carolina {{and the world}} at large early in the 20th century. With the influx of new residents from the Outer Banks, a post office was opened in 1904. The first public road to extend the length of the island, Harkers Island Drive, was built in 1926 when a footpath was widened and paved with the oyster shells from the Coree mound at Shell Point. The road was hard paved by the county in 1936. The road and the post office were connected to the mainland by a ferry service until the Earl C. Davis Memorial Bridge was built in 1941.|$|E
25|$|Disagreements {{within the}} party became <b>more</b> <b>connected</b> with matters of {{political}} than ideological strategy. The ideological direction of the Portuguese republicanism had been traced much earlier by the works of José Félix Henriques Nogueira, little changed through the years, except in terms of later adaptation to the everyday realities of the country. The works of Teófilo Braga contributed to this task by trying to concretise the decentralising and federalist ideas, abandoning the socialist quality in favour of democratic aspects. This change also aimed to attract the small and medium bourgeoisie, which turned {{into one of the}} main bases of republican support. In the election of 13 October 1878 the PRP elected its first member of parliament, José Joaquim Rodrigues de Freitas, for Porto.|$|E

25|$|Changes in China's food {{production}} system are generating {{an awareness of}} food safety problems. China's agricultural system is composed mostly of small land-holding farmers and subsistence agriculture. China, however, has less arable land than other nations and farmers intensively use fertilizer and pesticides to maintain high {{food production}}. Food is sold in both open air markets and urban supermarkets, and by the late 1990s, China's farms were adapting to more specialized crop production as the local markets become <b>more</b> <b>connected</b> to the national and international markets. However, local authorities largely control food regulation enforcement unless the central government steps in. As urban consumers' incomes increase, the demand for quality food goods, safer production, and processed foods also increases, and urban residents and supermarkets attract more national and media attention to food problems.|$|E
25|$|At {{the same}} time he made {{attempts}} to help grow ABC, Goldenson had been trying since mid-1953 to provide content for the network by contacting his old acquaintances in Hollywood, with whom he had worked when UPT was a subsidiary of Paramount Pictures. ABC's merger with UPT {{led to the creation of}} relationships with Hollywood's film production studios, breaking a quarantine that had existed at that time between film and television, the latter of which had previously been <b>more</b> <b>connected</b> to radio. ABC's flagship productions at the time were The Lone Ranger, based on the radio program of the same title, and The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet, the latter of which (at 14 seasons, running from 1952 to 1966) held the record for the longest-running prime time comedy in U.S. television history, until it was surpassed by The Simpsons in 2003.|$|E
25|$|Until {{the early}} 20th century, Golden {{maintained}} {{a small town}} population of around 2,500 people. Several industries faded or were destroyed by tragic events, , but others flourished to continue Golden's industrial legacy, including its brewing, brick making, clay mining and porcelain industries. Golden became even <b>more</b> <b>connected</b> through mass transit, with two trolley lines extending to Denver, while the movie theater gradually took {{the place of the}} opera house for downtown entertainment. Downtown revitalization efforts began in the 1920s with its first streetscape and ornamental lighting project and urban renewal on its north and east, anchored by new senior high and grade schools. The historic cultural tension between the city's north and south sides gradually eased, and the town successfully endured additional major economic depressions, including the Silver Crash of 1893 and the Great Depression. The School of Mines gained a worldwide academic reputation, Coors rapidly came to the forefront of the national and international brewing and ceramics industries, and the city modernized with a recreation center, paved streets and more.|$|E
