5|$|Milk served almost 11 <b>months</b> <b>in</b> <b>office</b> and was {{responsible}} for passing a stringent gay rights ordinance for the city. On November 27, 1978, Milk and Mayor George Moscone were assassinated by Dan White, another city supervisor, who had recently resigned to pursue a private business enterprise but who had sought to get his position back after that endeavor failed. White was sentenced to seven {{years in prison for}} manslaughter, later reduced to five years, and after his release in 1983, committed suicide two years later by carbon monoxide inhalation.|$|E
5|$|Nerva's brief reign was {{marred by}} {{financial}} difficulties and his inability to assert his authority over the Roman army. A revolt by the Praetorian Guard in October 97 essentially forced him to adopt an heir. After some deliberation Nerva adopted Trajan, a young and popular general, as his successor. After barely fifteen <b>months</b> <b>in</b> <b>office,</b> Nerva {{died of natural causes}} on 27 January 98. Upon his death he was succeeded and deified by Trajan.|$|E
5|$|Abbas died {{in autumn}} 861, after another raid into Byzantine territory, and was buried at Caltagirone; the Byzantines later exhumed and burned his corpse. As his replacement, the Sicilian Muslims chose his uncle Ahmad ibn Ya'qub. His tenure was short, as in February 862 he was deposed {{in favour of}} Abdallah, son of Abbas. Abdallah's general Rabah was able to capture a few Byzantine fortresses, despite {{suffering}} a defeat in battle at first. Abdallah's elevation, however, was not acknowledged by the Aghlabids, and he was replaced, after only five <b>months</b> <b>in</b> <b>office,</b> by Khafaja ibn Sufyan.|$|E

5|$|Congress created {{executive}} departments during Washington's first <b>months</b> <b>in</b> <b>office</b> in 1789, {{including the}} State Department on July 27, the Department of War in early August, and the Treasury Department on September 2. The President also received two additional officers without departments: the Attorney General and Postmaster General. Washington appointed Richmond lawyer Edmund Randolph as Attorney General and Samuel Osgood as Postmaster General. He also appointed fellow Virginian Thomas Jefferson to be Secretary of State and Henry Knox as Secretary of War. Finally, he appointed Alexander Hamilton {{to head the}} Treasury Department. Washington's cabinet eventually developed into a consultation and advisory body, although this was not mandated by the Constitution.|$|E
5|$|During {{his final}} <b>months</b> <b>in</b> <b>office,</b> Patton drew {{criticism}} for abusing his patronage power. Critics charged {{that he had}} appointed several {{of his family and}} friends who were in non-merit system jobs to merit system positions, increasing their chances of being retained when a new administration took over. These charges were particularly damaging because, earlier in the year, the General Assembly had ordered Patton to cut 800 non-merit positions to help balance the budget. The Lexington Herald-Leader opined that these charges were more serious than those of the Conner affair. Patton maintained that his friends had followed proper personnel protocol in applying for and securing merit positions.|$|E
5|$|Gordon Brown was {{reportedly}} unhappy over Blair's comments about him, while David Runciman of The London Review of Books suggested there were episodes from Blair's troubled {{relationship with his}} Chancellor that were absent from A Journey. Labour politician Alistair Darling said the book demonstrates how the country can be {{changed for the better}} when a government has a clear purpose, while the New Zealand Listener suggested Blair and his contemporaries had helped to write New Labour's epitaph. Some families of servicemen and women who were killed in Iraq reacted angrily, with one antiwar commentator dismissing Blair's regrets over the loss of life. Shortly after the release of A Journey, the screenwriter of the 2006 film The Queen, which depicts Blair's first <b>months</b> <b>in</b> <b>office,</b> accused Blair of plagiarising a conversation with Elizabeth II from him.|$|E

50|$|Cartwright is {{in favor}} of more gun safety laws. During his first <b>month</b> <b>in</b> <b>office</b> he co-sponsored four bills {{involving}} gun control. He opposes gun-makers' legal immunity after a crime has occurred, as does he oppose assault rifle sales.|$|R
5|$|Cleveland {{brought his}} {{opposition}} to needless spending to the governor's office; he promptly sent the legislature eight vetos {{in his first two}} <b>months</b> <b>in</b> <b>office.</b> The first to attract attention was his veto of a bill to reduce the fares on New York City elevated trains to five cents. The bill had broad support because the trains' owner, Jay Gould, was unpopular, and his fare increases were widely denounced. Cleveland, however, saw the bill as unjust—Gould had taken over the railroads when they were failing and had made the system solvent again. Moreover, Cleveland believed that altering Gould's franchise would violate the Contract Clause of the federal Constitution. Despite the initial popularity of the fare-reduction bill, the newspapers praised Cleveland's veto. Theodore Roosevelt, then a member of the Assembly, had reluctantly voted for the bill to which Cleveland objected, in a desire to punish the unscrupulous railroad barons. After the veto, Roosevelt reversed himself, as did many legislators, and the veto was sustained.|$|E
5|$|In 1723, Bach was {{appointed}} as Thomaskantor (director of church music) in Leipzig, {{where he was}} responsible for the music at four churches and for the training and education of boys singing in the Thomanerchor. He took office {{in the middle of the}} liturgical year, on the first Sunday after Trinity. In his first twelve <b>months</b> <b>in</b> <b>office,</b> Bach decided to compose new works for almost all liturgical events, known as his first cantata cycle. The year after, he continued that effort, composing chorale cantatas based on Lutheran hymns. He kept the format of the chorale cantata cycle until Palm Sunday of 1725, but then repeated an early Easter cantata, Christ lag in Todes Banden, BWV 4, on Easter Sunday, and wrote Bleib bei uns, denn es will Abend werden for Easter Monday as the first cantata in that cycle that was not a chorale cantata. The change was possibly due to the loss of a librettist.|$|E
5|$|In 706 or a {{few years}} later he was {{appointed}} as governor of Basra under the governor of Iraq, al-Hajjaj ibn Yusuf, and remained in the post until al-Hajjaj's replacement by Yazid ibn al-Muhallab in 715. Yazid in turn named al-Jarrah as his deputy for Iraq, before he himself left for Khurasan, and in 717, Caliph Umar II (r. 717–720) appointed al-Jarraj as Yazid's successor in the governorship of Khurasan and Sistan. Al-Jarrah remained in Khurasan until March/April 719, when he was dismissed after 17 <b>months</b> <b>in</b> <b>office</b> due to complaints of his mistreatment of the native converts to Islam (mawali), who, despite their conversion, were still obliged to pay the poll-tax (jizya). He was replaced by his deputy, Abd al-Rahman ibn Nu'aym al-Ghamidi. The most notable event of his tenure {{was the beginning of the}} covert missionary activity (da'wah) by the agents of the Abbasids in Khurasan. After his return to Iraq, in 720, he seems to have fought alongside Maslamah ibn Abd al-Malik in the suppression of the rebellion of Yazid ibn al-Muhallab.|$|E

5|$|The provincial presidents were {{appointed}} by the national government and were, in theory, charged with governing the province. In practice, however, their power was intangible, varying from province to province based upon each president's relative degree of personal influence and personal character. Since the national government wanted to ensure their loyalty, presidents were, in most cases, sent to a province {{in which they had}} no political, familial or other ties. In order to prevent them from developing any strong local interests or support, presidents would be limited to terms of only a few <b>months</b> <b>in</b> <b>office.</b> As the president usually {{spent a great deal of}} time away from the province, often traveling to their native province or the imperial capital, the de facto governor was the vice-president, who was chosen by the Provincial Assembly and was usually a local politician. With little power to undermine provincial autonomy, the president was an agent of the central government with little function beyond conveying its interests to the provincial political bosses. Presidents could be used by the national government to influence, or even rig, elections, although to be effective the president had to rely on provincial and local politicians who belonged to his own political party. This interdependency created a complex relationship which was based upon exchanges of favors, private interests, party goals, negotiations, and other political maneuvering.|$|E
25|$|In 1909 Radikale Venstre formed {{its first}} {{government}}, and Munch became Minister of the Interior. He didn't have much impact in this position, {{as the government}} was ousted already after 10 <b>months</b> <b>in</b> <b>office.</b>|$|E
