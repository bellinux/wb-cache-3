25|$|In {{the case}} of Electro-Motive Diesel's {{two-stroke}} engines, the mechanically assisted turbocharger is not specifically a twincharger, as the engine uses the <b>mechanical</b> <b>assistance</b> to charge air only at lower engine speeds and startup. Once above notch # 5, the engine uses true turbocharging. This differs from a turbocharger that uses the compressor section of the turbo-compressor only during starting and, as a two-stroke engines cannot naturally aspirate, and, according to SAE definitions, a two-stroke engine with a mechanically assisted compressor during idle and low throttle is considered naturally aspirated.|$|E
30|$|After extubation, 36 {{patients}} required curative NIV, including 7 {{who also}} needed <b>mechanical</b> cough <b>assistance,</b> and 8 required only <b>mechanical</b> cough <b>assistance.</b> Reintubation was performed within 2  days after extubation in 6 patients and on day 6 in 1 patient.

30|$|Identifying {{patients}} {{at high risk}} of post-extubation acute respiratory failure requiring respiratory or <b>mechanical</b> cough <b>assistance</b> remains challenging. Here, our primary aim was to evaluate the accuracy of easily collected parameters obtained before or just after extubation in predicting the risk of post-extubation acute respiratory failure requiring, at best, noninvasive mechanical ventilation (NIV) and/or <b>mechanical</b> cough <b>assistance</b> and, at worst, reintubation after extubation.|$|R
500|$|Cattle {{may need}} to be {{deliberately}} thrown or tipped over for certain types of husbandry practices and medical treatment. [...] When done for medical purposes, this is often called [...] "casting", and when performed without <b>mechanical</b> <b>assistance</b> requires the attachment of [...] of rope around the body and legs of the animal. After the rope is secured by non-slip bowline knots, it is pulled to the rear until the animal is off-balance. Once the cow is forced to lie down in sternal recumbency (on its chest), it can be rolled onto its side and its legs tied to prevent kicking.|$|E
2500|$|Boxcars {{can carry}} most kinds of freight. Originally they were hand-loaded, but {{in more recent}} years <b>mechanical</b> <b>assistance</b> such as forklifts {{have been used to}} load and empty them faster. Their {{generalized}} design is still slower to load and unload than specialized designs of car, and this partially explains the decline in boxcar numbers since World War II. The other cause for this decline is the dramatic shift of waterborne cargo transport to container shipping. Effectively a boxcar without the wheels and chassis, a container is designed to be amenable to intermodal freight transport, whether by container ships, trucks or trains, and can be delivered door-to-door.|$|E

Its aims and objectives were articulated in Fors Clavigera. A communitarian venture, it had a hierarchical structure, with Ruskin as its Master, and dedicated members called [...] "Companions" [...] whose first loyalty was nearly always to Ruskin personally. Ruskin wished to show that contemporary life could still be enjoyed in the countryside, with land being farmed traditionally, with minimal <b>mechanical</b> <b>assistance.</b> With a tithe (or personal donation) of £7,000, Ruskin acquired some land and a remarkable collection of books, art and other precious and beautiful objects.|$|E
40|$|Since {{its first}} {{clinical}} application {{in patients with}} cardiogenic shock (CS) in 1968, the intra aortic balloon pump (IABP) increasingly {{has been used for}} several clinical conditions requiring <b>mechanical</b> cardiac <b>assistance.</b> In current practice, IABP therapy is still the most accessible and most frequently used method of <b>mechanical</b> cardiac <b>assistance.</b> It is primarily being used as a therapeutic instrument for hemodynamic stabilization in left ventricular failure and cardiogenic shock, mainly in patients with myocardial infarction. Although IABP therapy showed to be effective for stabilization of hemodynamically compromised patients, it has failed to show any long-term survival benefit in any setting of acute myocardial infarction. The rapid developments in ventricular assist device technology have led to the availability of several percutaneous implantable left ventricular assist devices (LVADs). These more potent percutaneous LVADs herald a promising alternative therapeutic approach for <b>mechanical</b> cardiac <b>assistance</b> other than IABP therapy.

60|$|March {{followed}} him to the bar parlor with some wonder, and his dim sense of repugnance was not dismissed by the first sight of the innkeeper, who was widely different from the genial innkeepers of romance, a bony man, very silent behind a black mustache, but with black, restless eyes. Taciturn as he was, the investigator succeeded at last in extracting a scrap of information from him, by dint of ordering beer and talking to him persistently and minutely on the subject of motor cars. He evidently regarded the innkeeper as in some singular way an authority on motor cars; as being deep in the secrets of the mechanism, management, and mismanagement of motor cars; holding the man all the time with a glittering eye like the Ancient Mariner. Out of all this rather mysterious conversation there did emerge at last a sort of admission that one particular motor car, of a given description, had stopped before the inn about an hour before, and that an elderly man had alighted, requiring some <b>mechanical</b> <b>assistance.</b> Asked if the visitor required any other assistance, the innkeeper said shortly that the old gentleman had filled his flask and taken a packet of sandwiches. And with these words the somewhat inhospitable host had walked hastily out of the bar, and they heard him banging doors in the dark interior.|$|E

30|$|In conclusion, {{our main}} {{finding is that}} FVC {{measurements}} before and after extubation are well correlated. FVC may serve as an objective predictor of post-extubation respiratory failure requiring NIV and/or <b>mechanical</b> cough <b>assistance</b> and/or reintubation in heterogeneous populations of medical ICU patients. FVC measurement may deserve consideration as an inexpensive tool {{to be used in}} combination with easily identified risk factors for assessing patients after a successful SBT, with the goal of identifying those likely to require prophylactic post-extubation NIV and/or <b>mechanical</b> cough <b>assistance.</b> However, further studies are necessary to confirm our results in different conditions and populations.|$|R

30|$|Among 3458 {{patients}} {{admitted to}} the ICU, 730 received endotracheal MV for longer than 72  h and were then extubated; among these, 130 were included. At inclusion, the 130 patients had mean ICU stay and endotracheal MV durations both equal to 11  ±  4.2  days. After extubation, 36 patients required curative NIV, 7 both curative NIV and <b>mechanical</b> cough <b>assistance,</b> and 8 only mechanical cough assistance; 6 patients, all of whom first received NIV, required reintubation within 48  h. The group that required NIV after extubation had a significantly higher proportion of patients with chronic respiratory disease (P =  0.015), longer endotracheal MV duration at inclusion, and lower Medical Research Council (MRC) score (P =  0.02, P =  0.01, and P =  0.004, respectively). By multivariate analysis, forced vital capacity (FVC) and peak cough expiratory flow (PCEF) were independently associated with (NIV) and/or <b>mechanical</b> cough <b>assistance</b> and/or reintubation after extubation. Areas under the ROC curves for pre-extubation PCEF and FVC were 0.71 and 0.76, respectively.|$|R
40|$|Background: Nitrates are {{superior}} to furosemide {{in the management of}} acute pulmonary edema associated with myocardial infarction; however, their role in the absence of infarction is unclear. Methods and Results: A randomized comparison was undertaken of the relative effectiveness of primary therapy with either intravenous morphine/furosemide (men/women; n = 32) or nitroglycerin/N-acetylcysteine (NTG/NAC; n = 37) in consecutive patients with acute pulmonary edema. The primary end point was change in Pao 2 /Fio 2 over the first 60 minutes of therapy. Secondary end points were needed for <b>mechanical</b> respiratory <b>assistance</b> (ie, continuous positive airway pressure via mask or intubation and ventilation) and changes in other gas exchange parameters. Both treatment groups showed improvement in oxygenation after 60 minutes of therapy; however, this reached statistical significance only with NTG/ NAC therapy. There {{was no significant difference between}} groups in the assessed parameters (95 % Cl for differences in Pao 2 /Fio 2 : furosemide/morphine − 12 to 23 and NTG/NAC 4 to 44), a finding also confirmed in 32 patients presenting with respiratory failure. Only 11 % of the study group required <b>mechanical</b> ventilatory <b>assistance</b> (continuous positive airway pressure in 4 patients and intubation and ventilation in 3 patients). Conclusions: NTG/NAC therapy is as effective as furosemide/morphine in the initial management of acute pulmonary edema, regardless of the presence or absence of respiratory failure. The necessity for <b>mechanical</b> ventilatory <b>assistance</b> is infrequent in these patients, regardless of the initial medical treatment regimen. John F. Beltrame, Christopher J.
