40|$|We report neutron {{diffraction}} and magnetization {{studies of the}} magnetic order in multiferroic BiFeO 3. In ferroelectric <b>monodomain</b> <b>single</b> <b>crystals,</b> there are three magnetic cycloidal domains with propagation vectors equivalent by crystallographic symmetry. The cycloid period slowly grows with increasing temperature. The magnetic domain populations do not change with temperature except in the close vicinity of the Neel temperature, at which, in addition, a small jump in magneti- zation is observed. No evidence for the spin-reorientation transitions proposed in previous Raman and dielectric studies is found. The magnetic cycloid is slightly anharmonic for T= 5 K. The an- harmonicity is much smaller than previously reported in NMR studies. At room temperature, a circular cycloid is observed, within errors. We argue that the observed anharmonicity provides important clues for understanding electromagnons in BiFeO 3. Comment: In Press at PR...|$|R

The {{examples of such}} application are given in our works: in [1] for the most widespread ground technology of silicon (Si) <b>single</b> <b>crystal</b> growing by the Czochralski (CZ) method and in [2] for the space technology of semiconductor <b>single</b> <b>crystal</b> growing by th...|$|R
40|$|An {{analytical}} description of volume reflection of charged ultrarelativistic particles in bent <b>single</b> <b>crystals</b> is considered. The relation describing {{the angle of}} volume reflection {{as a function of}} the transversal energy is obtained. Different angle distributions of the scattered protons in <b>single</b> <b>crystals</b> are found. Results of calculations for 400  GeV protons scattered by the silicon <b>single</b> <b>crystal</b> are presented...|$|R
40|$|High-purity <b>single</b> <b>crystals</b> of Nb and Ta {{could be}} {{prepared}} free of hydrogen by a Pd-coating technique. Low-frequency torsion pendulum measurements are reported on such <b>single</b> <b>crystals</b> showing the intrinsic α and γ relaxation. The dislocation-internal friction spectra of Nb and Ta are compared with new results on W <b>single</b> <b>crystals.</b> The activation {{parameters of the}} α and γ processes are reported...|$|R
