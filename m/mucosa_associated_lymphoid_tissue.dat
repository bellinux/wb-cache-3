40|$|Abstract Introduction <b>Mucosa</b> <b>associated</b> <b>lymphoid</b> <b>tissue</b> lymphomas are {{the most}} common lymphomas of the salivary glands. The benign lymphoepithelial lesion is also a {{lymphoproliferative}} disease that develops in the parotid gland. In the present case report, we describe one case of benign lymphoepithelial lesion with a subsequent low transformation to grade <b>mucosa</b> <b>associated</b> <b>lymphoid</b> <b>tissue</b> lymphoma appearing as a cystic mass in the parotid gland. Case presentation A 78 -year-old Caucasian female smoker was referred to our clinic with a non-tender left facial swelling that had been present for approximately three years. The patient underwent resection of the left parotid gland with preservation of the left facial nerve through a preauricular incision. The pathology report was consistent with a low-grade marginal-zone B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (<b>mucosa</b> <b>associated</b> <b>lymphoid</b> <b>tissue</b> lymphoma) following benign lymphoepithelial lesion of the gland. Conclusions Salivary gland <b>mucosa</b> <b>associated</b> <b>lymphoid</b> <b>tissue</b> lymphoma should be considered in the differential diagnosis of cystic or bilateral salivary gland lesions. Parotidectomy is recommended in order to treat the tumor and to ensure histological diagnosis for further follow-up planning. Radiotherapy and chemotherapy should be considered in association with surgery in disseminated forms or after removal. </p...|$|E

Moreover, the reduction in lymphocytes number was maximum in duodenum and cecal tonsils, while minimal in lungs.

40|$|Abstract. Background: Marginal zone lymphomas are {{indolent}} B-cell lymphomas {{associated with}} autoimmunity and chronic inflammation. The two most frequent variants are <b>mucosa</b> <b>associated</b> <b>lymphoid</b> <b>tissues</b> marginal zone lymphomas and splenic marginal zone lymphomas. The {{aim of the}} study was to determine if it is possible to classify splenic and gastric lymphomas according to karyometric features. Methods: The material consisted of 16 splenic and 14 gastric lymphomas. The measurements were done with the AnalySIS image analysis system. In each case at least 100 nuclei were selected, and 19 different geometric parameters were measured. Results: On statistical analysis, the nuclei of splenic and gastric lymphomas showed differences in most parameters, but significant overlap of the values was present. Neural networks were trained and used for classification of the data. By this method, the nuclei were properly classified with a sensitivity of 0. 75 and specificity of 0. 71. In addition, in all the cases the majority of the nuclei were properly classified, thus allowing correct classification of all the cases into “splenic ” or “gastric”. Conclusion: These results support the view that mucosa-associated <b>lymphoid</b> <b>tissue</b> lymphomas and splenic marginal-zone lymphomas are separate entities...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to gain more insight into the {{mechanism}} of IgA memory formation by testing the effects of intra-intestinal antigen priming on various booster routes. To obtain a primary immune response trinitrophenyl conjugated keyhole limpet haemocyanin (KLH-TNP) was injected into the lumen of the small intestines of mice. For secondary immune responses mice were boosted intra-intestinally, intravenously or subcutaneously. The distribution of antigen specific cells in situ was demonstrated by enzyme histochemistry whereas quantification of TNP-specific cells was performed with a plaque-forming cell assay. After single or repeated intra-intestinal antigen administrations both primary and secondary immune responses in terms of specific antibody containing cells were mainly located in the spleen. The anti-TNP antibody-containing cells produced predominantly IgM during the primary and IgM, IgG and IgA during the secondary response. In mesenteric lymph nodes and villi antigen-specific cells were detected sporadically. When intra-intestinal priming was followed by intravenous or subcutaneous booster injections most anti-TNP antibody-producing cells were demonstrated in the spleen and in the draining popliteal lymph nodes. In contrast to repeated intravenous or subcutaneous immunizations alone, these organs contained, besides specific IgM and IgG cells, many TNP-specific cells producing IgA antibodies. This result demonstrates that the production of IgA antibodies is not restricted to mucosa-associated <b>lymphoid</b> <b>tissues.</b> IgA memory cells are induced in <b>mucosa</b> <b>associated</b> <b>lymphoid</b> <b>tissues,</b> probably in Peyer's patches, will consecutively migrate throughout the whole lymphoid system and can be triggered by renewed antigen contact to become IgA plasma cells...|$|R
40|$|International audienceBackground CD 4 T cell {{lymphopenia}} is {{an important}} T cell defect associated to ageing. Higher susceptibility to infections, cancer, or autoimmune pathologies described in aged individuals is thought to partly rely on T cell lymphopenia. We hypothesize that such diverse effects may reflect anatomical heterogeneity of age related T cell lymphopenia. Indeed, no data are currently available {{on the impact of}} ageing on T cell pool recovered from gut <b>associated</b> <b>lymphoid</b> <b>tissue</b> (GALT), a crucial site of CD 4 T cell accumulation. Results Primary, secondary and tertiary lymphoid organs of C 57 BL/ 6 animals were analysed at three intervals of ages: 2 to 6  months (young), 10 to 14  months (middle-aged) and 22 to 26  months (old). We confirmed that ageing preferentially impacted CD 4 T cell compartment in secondary lymphoid organs. Importantly, a different picture emerged from gut associated mucosal sites: during ageing, CD 4 T cell accumulation was progressively developing in colon and small intestine lamina propria and Peyer's patches. Similar trend was also observed in middle-aged SJL/B 6 F 1 mice. Interestingly, an inverse correlation was detected between CD 4 T cell numbers in secondary lymphoid organs and colonic lamina propria of C 57 BL/ 6 mice whereas no increase in proliferation rate of GALT CD 4 T cells was detected. In contrast to GALT, no CD 4 T cell accumulation was detected in lungs and liver in middle-aged animals. Finally, the concomitant accumulation of CD 4 T cell in GALT and depletion in secondary lymphoid organs during ageing was detected both in male and female animals. Conclusions Our data thus demonstrate that T cell lymphopenia in secondary <b>lymphoid</b> organs currently <b>associated</b> to ageing is not sustained in gut or lung <b>mucosa</b> <b>associated</b> <b>lymphoid</b> <b>tissues</b> or non-lymphoid sites such as the liver. The inverse correlation between CD 4 T cell numbers in secondary lymphoid organs and colonic lamina propria and the absence of overt proliferation in GALT suggest that marked CD 4 T cell decay in secondary lymphoid organs during ageing reflect redistribution of CD 4 T cells rather than generalized CD 4 T cell decay. Such anatomical heterogeneity may provide an important rationale for the diversity of immune defects observed during ageing...|$|R

Records from 1829 indicate that American Indians would reduce contact hypersensitivity from poison ivy by consuming leaves of related Rhus species; however, contemporary attempts to use oral tolerance to ameliorate autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis and other hypersensitivity reactions have been mixed. The systemic effects of oral tolerance may be explained by the extensive recirculation of immune cells primed in one mucosal tissue in another mucosal tissue, allowing extension of mucosal immunity. [...] The same probably occurs for cells mediating mucosal immune tolerance.|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} based upon four {{original}} papers in which human dendritic cells (DCs) and B cells have been analyzed {{in terms of how}} they influence the character of adaptive immune responses. DCs isolated from human tonsils were found to possess a capacity to directly regulate proliferation, isotype switching, and antibody production in B cells. DC-produced cytokines, including IL- 13, were identified as critical mediators of these B cell responses. Furthermore, gene chip technology was used to evaluate the nature and kinetics of the global gene expression taking place in monocyte-derived DCs exposed to inflammatory agents. Obtained results revealed an extensive and temporal reprogramming of these cells in response to TNF-a, IL- 1 b, plus mediators released by activated monocytes. The altered gene expression was represented by a pronounced upregulation of a number of mRNAs encoding proteins with established functions in the regulation of both T and B cell responses. This transcriptional reorganization may reflect the effect of in vivo released inflammatory mediators, indicating that DCs can be fully matured to activate adaptive immunity in response to tissue inflammation. Furthermore, also the role of B cells in immune regulation was investigated. Antigen-activated B cells within germinal centers (GC) were found to produce the Th 2 -polarizing cytokine IL- 4 and consequently they could elicit Th 2 -differentiation in vitro. In agreement with this in vitro observation, a Th 2 precursor subset was identified in human tonsil and demonstrated to uniformly display a GC-associated CXCR 5 high phenotype. Therefore Th 2 -development in human tonsils appears to selectively occur within GCs and to be supported by B cells secreting IL- 4. Moreover, IL- 4 -producing B cells were also identified within follicles located in colon mucosa, indicating that B cell-dependent Th 2 development can take place in several of the <b>mucosa</b> <b>associated</b> <b>lymphoid</b> <b>tissues.</b> Finally, functional properties of the previously described CD 57 + GC Th cells were addressed and obtained results showed that these cells represent anergized T cells. These data thus suggest that B cells and GCs regulate CD 4 + T cell differentiation in a finely tuned fashion, either by promoting differentiation of Th 2 cells or by furnishing T cell-unresponsiveness. In conclusion, I propose that Th cell polarization may be subjected to a counterbalanced regulation, where DC-produced IL- 12 and/or IFN-a/b promote Th 1 -differentiation, whereas GCs and B cells preferentially furnish Th 2 -development but also contribute to suppression of T cell responses...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND & AIMS: Priming of T cells by {{dendritic}} cells (DCs) in {{the intestinal}} <b>mucosa</b> and <b>associated</b> <b>lymphoid</b> <b>tissues</b> helps maintain mucosal tolerance but {{also contributes to}} the development of chronic intestinal inflammation. Chemokines regulate the intestinal immune response and can contribute to pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel diseases. We investigated the role of the chemokine CCL 17, which is expressed by conventional DCs in the intestine and is up-regulated during colitis. METHODS: Colitis was induced by administration of dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) to mice or transfer of T cells to lymphopenic mice. Colitis activity was monitored by body weight assessment, histologic scoring, and cytokine profile analysis. The direct effects of CCL 17 on DCs and the indirect effects on differentiation of T helper (Th) cells were determined in vitro and ex vivo. RESULTS: Mice that lacked CCL 17 (Ccl 17 (E/E) mice) were protected from induction of severe colitis by DSS or T-cell transfer. Colonic mucosa and mesenteric lymph nodes from Ccl 17 -deficient mice produced lower levels of proinflammatory cytokines. The population of Foxp 3 (+) regulatory T cells (Tregs) was expanded in Ccl 17 (E/E) mice and required for long-term protection from colitis. CCR 4 expression by transferred T cells was not required for induction of colitis, but CCR 4 expression by the recipients was required. CCL 17 promoted Toll-like receptor-induced secretion of interleukin- 12 and interleukin- 23 by DCs in an autocrine manner, promoted differentiation of Th 1 and Th 17 cells, and reduced induction of Foxp 3 (+) Treg cells. CONCLUSIONS: The chemokine CCL 17 is required for induction of intestinal inflammation in mice. CCL 17 has an autocrine effect on DCs that promotes production of inflammatory cytokines and activation of Th 1 and Th 17 cells and reduces expansion of Treg cells...|$|R
40|$|The {{interactions}} between the endogenous gut microbiota and the fish host are integral in mediating the development, maintenance and effective functionality of the intestinal <b>mucosa</b> and gut <b>associated</b> <b>lymphoid</b> <b>tissues</b> (GALTs). These microbial populations also provide a level of protection against pathogenic visitors to the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and aid host digestive function via the production of exogenous digestive enzymes and vitamins. Manipulation of these endogenous populations may provide an alternative method to antibiotics to control disease and promote health management. Applications of probiotics for Mediterranean teleosts can stimulate immune responses, enhance growth performance, feed utilisation, digestive enzyme activities, antioxidant enzyme activities, gene expression, disease resistance, larval survival, gut morphology, modulate GI microbiota and mediate stress responses. Although considerably less information is available regarding prebiotic applications for Mediterranean teleosts, prebiotics also offer benefits with regards to improving immune status and fish production. Despite the promising potential benefits demonstrated in current literature, obtaining consistent and reliable results is often difficult due to our incomplete understanding of indigenous fish GI microbiota and their subsequent host interactions which mediate and drive both localised and systemic host immunological responses. Additionally, the probiotic and prebiotic (biotics) mechanisms which mediate host benefits at the mucosal interface are poorly understood. Future studies focused on these interactions. utilising gnotobiotic techniques should provide {{a better understanding of}} how to extract the full potential of biotic applications to promote immune function of Mediterranean teleosts. 2010 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Both innate and {{adaptative}} immune responses {{contribute to}} the control of infectious diseases, including by limiting the spreading of zoonotic diseases from animal reservoirs to humans. Pigs represent an important animal reservoir for influenza virus infection of human populations and are also naturally infected by coronaviruses, an important group of viruses, which includes the recently emerged {{severe acute respiratory syndrome}} (SARS) virus. Studies on both innate and adaptative immune responses of pigs to influenza virus and coronaviruses contribute, therefore, to a better control of these infections in their natural hosts and will be briefly reviewed in this article. Pro-inflammatory cytokines, including type I interferon (IFN), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), and interleukin- 6 (IL- 6), were found in lung secretions of influenza virus infected pigs, and correlated with the intensity of clinical signs, whereas prior vaccination against influenza strongly reduced the production of infectious virus and cytokines in the lungs upon challenge, which was associated with clinical protection. An early type I IFN production was also found in coronavirus infected pigs, including at mucosal sites. IFN induction by coronavirus is shown to involve interaction between a viral glycoprotein and a leukocyte subset, likely equivalent to plasmacytoid dendritic cells, present in the <b>mucosae</b> and <b>associated</b> <b>lymphoid</b> <b>tissues.</b> Given the IFN mediated antiviral and immunomodulatory effects, the use of IFN or IFN inducers may prove an efficient strategy for a better control of influenza virus and coronavirus infections in pigs. Because influenza and coronaviruses target mucosal surfaces, adaptative immune responses have to be characterized at mucosal sites. Thus, nasal and pulmonary antibody responses were analyzed in influenza virus infected or vaccinated pigs showing short-lived, but potentially protective local IgA and IgG antibody (Ab) responses. Interestingly, primary influenza virus infection induced long-lived increase of lung CD 8 (+) T cells and local lymphoproliferative responses. Pigs infected by a respiratory coronavirus (PRCV) showed virus-specific IgG Ab-secreting cells in the bronchial lymph nodes, whereas the transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV) induced more IgA Ab-secreting cells in gut tissues, which illustrates the importance of the route of antigen administration for inducing local immune effector mechanisms. Porcine viral infections provide, therefore, valuable models for evaluating the immune parameters that are important for controlling transmission of important viral zoonotic infections...|$|R
