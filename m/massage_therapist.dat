The Tar Heels did not receive a post-season tournament bid by the NCAA—the only time in Williams' coaching career that his team didn't take part in that tournament when eligible to do so. However, they did receive a bid to the NIT. The Tar Heels made it to the NIT championship game versus Dayton, which was played on April 1, 2010, at Madison Square Garden. The Tar Heels lost by a score of 79–68, bringing their overall tally to 20–17 for the 2009–10 season. This 20-win season however kept Williams' streak of 20-win seasons alive. Williams stated that the season was [...] "the biggest frustration and the biggest disappointment of my professional life". In addition to frustrating play, Williams was criticized for comparing the season to the disaster in Haiti by stating, [...] "Our <b>massage</b> <b>therapist</b> told me, she said 'You know, Coach, what happened in Haiti is a catastrophe. What you're having is a disappointment.' And I told her that depends on which chair she was sitting in, because it does feel like a catastrophe to me, and that's because it is my life."

40|$|Background: Although {{there is}} {{evidence}} that client expectations influence client outcomes, a valid and reliable scale for measuring the range of client expectations for both massage therapy and the behaviors of their <b>massage</b> <b>therapists</b> does not exist. Understanding how client expectations influence client outcomes would provide insight into how massage achieves its reported effects. Purpose: To develop and validate the Client Expectations of Massage Scale (CEMS), a measure of clients’ clinical, educational, interpersonal, and outcome expectations. Setting: Offices of licensed <b>massage</b> <b>therapists</b> in Iowa. Research Design: A practice-based research methodology was used to collect data from two samples of massage therapy clients. For Sample 1, 21 volunteer <b>massage</b> <b>therapists</b> collected data from their clients before the massage. Factor analysis was conducted to test construct validity and coefficient alpha was used to assess reliability. Correlational analyses with the CEMS, previous measures of client expectations, and the Life Orientation Test–Revised were examined to test the convergent and discriminant validity of the CEMS. For Sample 2, 24 <b>massage</b> <b>therapists</b> distributed study materials for clients to complete before and after a massage therapy session. Structural equation modeling was used to assess the construct, discriminant, and predictive validity of the CEMS. Participants: Sample 1 involved 320 and Sample 2 involved 321 adult massage clients. Intervention: Standard care provided by licensed <b>massage</b> <b>therapists.</b> Main Outcomes: Numeric Rating Scale for pain and Positive and Negative Affect Schedule– Revised (including the Serenity subscale). Results: The CEMS demonstrated good construct, convergent, discriminant and predictive validity, and adequate reliability. Client expectations were generally positive toward massage and their <b>massage</b> <b>therapists.</b> Positive outcome expectations had a positive effect on clients’ changes in pain and serenity. High interpersonal expectations had a negative effect on clients’ changes in serenity. Conclusions: Client expectations contribute to the nonspecific effects of massage therapy...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Despite {{the growing}} {{popularity}} of therapeutic massage in the US, {{little is known about the}} training or practice characteristics of <b>massage</b> <b>therapists.</b> The objective of this study was to describe these characteristics. Methods As part of a study of random samples of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) practitioners, we interviewed 226 <b>massage</b> <b>therapists</b> licensed in Connecticut and Washington state by telephone in 1998 and 1999 (85 % of those contacted) and then asked a sample of them to record information on 20 consecutive visits to their practices (total of 2005 consecutive visits). Results Most <b>massage</b> <b>therapists</b> were women (85 %), white (95 %), and had completed some continuing education training (79 % in Connecticut and 52 % in Washington). They treated a limited number of conditions, most commonly musculoskeletal (59 % and 63 %) (especially back, neck, and shoulder problems), wellness care (20 % and 19 %), and psychological complaints (9 % and 6 %) (especially anxiety and depression). Practitioners commonly used one or more assessment techniques (67 % and 74 %) and gave a massage emphasizing Swedish (81 % and 77 %), deep tissue (63 % and 65 %), and trigger/pressure point techniques (52 % and 46 %). Self-care recommendations, including increasing water intake, body awareness, and specific forms of movement, were made as part of more than 80 % of visits. Although most patients self-referred to massage, more than one-quarter were receiving concomitant care for the same problem from a physician. <b>Massage</b> <b>therapists</b> rarely communicated with these physicians. Conclusion This study provides new information about licensed <b>massage</b> <b>therapists</b> that should be useful to physicians and other healthcare providers interested in learning about massage therapy in order to advise their patients about this popular CAM therapy. </p...|$|R
