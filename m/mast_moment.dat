40|$|Simulation of {{aerodynamic}} {{and flight}} mechanic characteristics {{is essential to}} predict helicopter flight behaviour. One {{of the most important}} features is certainly the interactions between the main rotor wake and different helicopter components. This Master Thesis focuses on an analytical model able to predict and evaluate main rotor wake interactions with tailboom, empennage and fenestron. This was implemented in a more general flight mechanical simulation code. The first version was created in a former master thesis by Airbus Helicopters. Further development have been requested {{in order to have a}} better estimation of computed quantities in trimmed conditions for a higher range of speeds. The previous model, indeed, was suitable only for hover and low velocity steady forward flight. For this purpose, has been fundamental a better estimation of lateral forces and of wake geometry. Researches about influence of different factors have been conducted and new physical models considering fin and fenestron interactions and wake distortion have been derived and implemented. Two main variables have been considered as quality indicators: <b>mast</b> <b>moment</b> and fenestron blade pitch. Nevertheless, other quantities like forces and velocities have always been taken into account as well. Computed results have been compared with flight test data in order to verify the reliability of the improved simulation model. Moreover, CFD analysis have been used to clearly understand the wake behaviour...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of the data correlation is, to find out correction procedures to be applied for rotors in wind tunnels. A flight test program was conducted with the Bo 105 of the DLR {{in order to establish}} a data base for a wind tunnel measurement program. This program will be performed in the NASA-Ames 40 ft by 80 ft closed test section using a full scale Bo 105 rotor, and in the DNW 8 m by 6 m closed and open test section using a 2. 46 scaled down Bo 105 model rotor. Parameters of main interest are the air density, actual weight, control angles, and the 1 /rev blade bending moment in flap. The use of a flight test data point as a base for a wind tunnel test point is mostly dependent on the number of repeated test points and how this point fits to a regression curve. Therefore it makes only few sense to apply a flight test point directly to the wind tunnel model using equal control angles, <b>mast</b> <b>moment</b> or flapping moment. Much time was spend to find a criterion allowing the evaluation of a test point quality. It was found that some essentials have to be fulfilled: No control input, climb/descent close to zero; roll and pitch rates negligible small.

60|$|The {{captain had}} {{remained}} on deck. He {{placed his hand}} on the shrouds of the main <b>mast.</b> One <b>moment</b> they hung loosely; and then, as the vessel rolled over, tightened themselves, with a sudden jerk, till they were as stiff as iron rods. He shook his head.|$|R
60|$|The fierce temptation {{struck him}} as a sudden squall strikes a ship with all her canvas spread. For a <b>moment</b> <b>mast</b> and rigging stood the strain, then they went by the board. He would do it if it killed him; but the task must be {{undertaken}} properly, deliberately, and above all in secret. To-morrow he would begin. When he had satisfied himself; when he had seen; then he could always stop.|$|R
40|$|An active cyclic sidestick was {{successfully}} integrated in the DLR {{fly by wire}} Flying Helicopter Simulator (FHS) {{in which it was}} evaluated in flight with 6 pilots taking part in the test program. Tactile cueing functions to reduce pilot workload and to demonstrate operational benets were developed. These were: 1) a <b>mast</b> bending <b>moment</b> limitation, 2) a g-load limitation with cueing in the longitudinal cyclic axis, and 3) a flight guidance function for a standard rate IFR-turn. The latter 2 functions were evaluated in flight. Positive remarks were received. The flight guidance function was workload rated and showed noteworthy reductions and better situational awareness. Another topic was the evaluation of control force parameters suitable for the short pole highly versatile sidestick...|$|R
50|$|Years ago, Peleg, now the {{co-owner}} of the Pequod, sailed as mate under Ahab. During that voyage, a typhoon near Japan swung her three <b>masts</b> overboard. Every <b>moment</b> the crew thought the ship would sink, the sea breaking over the ship. Yet instead of thinking of death, Captain Ahab and Peleg thought of how to save all hands, and how to rig jury masts {{in order to get}} into the nearest port.|$|R

Not only the eyes are a window on the soul.|$|R
60|$|There was a {{prize in}} the old blind evidently. But {{what was he doing}} there? Till then I had {{supposed}} that the owl always takes his game from the wing. Farther along the beach was a sand bluff overlooking the proceedings. I gained it after a careful stalk, crept to the edge, and looked over. Down in the blind a big snowy owl was digging away like a Trojan, tearing out sand and seaweed with his great claws, first one foot, then the other, like a hungry hen, and sending it up in showers behind him over the old <b>mast.</b> Every few <b>moments</b> he would stop suddenly, bristle up all his feathers till he looked comically big and fierce, take a look out over the log and along the beach, then fall to digging again furiously.|$|R
40|$|The dynamic {{characteristics}} of the Solar Array Flight Experiment (SAFE) structure during deployment and retraction are investigated. The SAFE structure consists of a deployable mast with an attached solar blanket designed with accordion type folds to permit packaging in a small volume. The planar form of the blanket geometry during deployment is maintained by a blanket tension/guidewire system. Structurally, the mast is modeled as an Euler beam column with inplane and out of plane bending and finite torsional stiffness. For out of plane motion, the blanket is modeled as a distributed mass uniformly supported by the three guidewires. For inplane motion the blanket displacements are assumed to vary linearly from the mast base to the mast tip. The mathematical model uses a virtual work formulation, required because the axial loading on the mast is nonconservative, combined with assumed beam modes to derive the differential equations of motion. Consideration of the time dependent boundary conditions results in an infinite set of ODE with time dependent coefficients. Finally, correlation of mast tip accelerations to <b>mast</b> base bending <b>moments</b> for specified modal motions are indicated...|$|R
