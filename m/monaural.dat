5|$|A <b>monaural</b> {{pressing}} of {{the album}} was released in the UK and Europe, which was simply a fold-down of the stereo mix.|$|E
5|$|F-Zero X {{features}} remixed {{music from}} its predecessor. Due to compression, the game features <b>monaural</b> music tracks, but ambient effects are generated with stereo sound effects.|$|E
5|$|The {{album was}} re-issued in 2010 {{as part of}} The Original Mono Recordings, a Columbia Legacy box set that {{included}} the <b>monaural</b> versions of Dylan's first eight albums.|$|E
5|$|Elvis Is Back! was {{released}} on April 8, 1960, in stereo and <b>monaural</b> versions. The album reached number two on Billboards Top LP's and topped the UK Albums Chart. Despite this, its commercial performance was a disappointment, with fewer than 300,000 copies sold in the United States.|$|E
5|$|The game {{features}} amplified <b>monaural</b> {{sound and}} pixel graphics on a CRT monitor. A Motorola 6809 {{central processing unit}} handles the graphics and gameplay, while a Motorola 6800 microprocessor handles the audio. A pack of three AA batteries provide power to save the game's settings and high scores when the machine is unplugged from an electrical outlet. The cabinet artwork is stenciled on the wooden frame.|$|E
5|$|Marble Madness is an arcade {{video game}} {{designed}} by Mark Cerny {{and published by}} Atari Games in 1984. The player uses a trackball to guide an onscreen marble through six obstacle-filled courses within a time limit. Marble Madness was Atari's first game to use the Atari System 1 hardware and to be programmed in the C programming language. It {{was also one of}} the first games to use true stereo sound; previous games used either <b>monaural</b> sound or simulated stereo.|$|E
5|$|Quad {{have now}} brought out five {{generations of the}} classic {{electrostatic}} design. Originally designed for <b>monaural</b> sound in a domestic context, the popularisation of stereophonic sound prompted the manufacturer to modify the electrostatic panels to improve their stereo dispersion. These speakers featured larger panels and a revolutionary stator design, made up of eight concentric rings fed from the centre outwards through analogue delay lines, so that the audio signal gives the illusion of radiating from a point source one foot behind the panel.|$|E
5|$|Robotron: 2084 {{features}} <b>monaural</b> {{sound and}} raster graphics on a 19-inch CRT monitor. It uses a Motorola 6809 {{central processing unit}} that operates at 1MHz. To produce multiple sounds on a single audio channel, the game uses a priority scheme to generate sounds in order of importance. A custom graphics coprocessor—which operates as a blitter chip—generates the on-screen objects and visual effects. The coprocessor increases the transfer speed of memory, which allows the game to simultaneously animate {{a large number of}} objects.|$|E
5|$|The game uses LaserDisc {{technology}} to stream pre-recorded animation, which {{was produced by}} Japanese studio Toei Animation. The game features raster graphics on a CRT monitor and amplified <b>monaural</b> sound. The protagonist's appearance was possibly derived from the main character, Lum, from the Japanese manga and anime series Urusei Yatsura. Several factors prevented an overseas release: {{a decline in the}} popularity of laserdisc arcade games in the mid-80s, the expensive price of laserdisc technology, and difficulty to translate. In the original Japanese Reika is voiced by Yuriko Yamamoto.|$|E
5|$|Joust was {{developed}} by Williams Electronics, with John Newcomer as the lead designer. Programmer Bill Pfutzenrueter and artists Jan Hendricks and Python Anghelo assisted him. Tim Murphy and John Kotlarik handled the audio design. The game features amplified <b>monaural</b> sound and raster graphics on a 19-inch color CRT monitor. Like other Williams arcade games, Joust was programmed in assembly language. A pack of three AA batteries provide power to save the game's settings and high scores when the machine is unplugged from an electrical outlet. The cabinet artwork, by Anghelo, is stenciled on a wooden frame. Anghelo also designed artwork for promotional materials; one such flyer featured archaic English, which was also incorporated into the game's onscreen instructions and game-over message.|$|E
5|$|Mayabazar was {{the first}} colourised Telugu film, with its audio remastered from <b>monaural</b> to a DTS 5.1-channel system. In late November 2007 a Hyderabad company, Goldstone Technologies, {{acquired}} world negative rights to 14 Telugu films produced by Vijaya Vauhini Studios, including that of Mayabazar, to digitally remaster them in colour. C.Jagan Mohan of Goldstone Technologies' experience at All India Radio gave him the idea of converting the film's audio to DTS. The audio was restored, sound effects remastered, distortion eliminated, and {{the volume of the}} vocals increased, and musicians re-recorded the film's background music on seven tracks instead of one.|$|E
5|$|Slalom was {{originally}} released in 1986 in the arcades {{as part of}} the Nintendo VS. System and was titled Vs. Slalom. This release featured an upright cabinet, a joystick, one jump button, <b>monaural</b> sound, and standard raster graphics. There was also an optional controller upgrade that featured two physical ski poles and shortened skis that the player could stand on and use to control the skier onscreen. The NES version was released by Nintendo in North America in March1987 and in Europe on October15, 1987. Slalom was Rare's first video game developed as a new company. It was also the Stamper brothers' first video game console release.|$|E
5|$|The Beatles {{completed}} a final {{mix of the}} song on 21 April 1967. Due to the difficulty in getting the two 4-track machines to play {{at exactly the same}} time, only a mono mix was attempted. In October 1968, while preparing the Yellow Submarine soundtrack album for release, EMI's engineers created a mock-stereo (duophonic) mix from this mono mix, instead of returning to the master tapes. For the <b>monaural</b> version of the album, originally available only in the UK, the engineers combined the two channels from the duophonic mix, rather than using the April 1967 mono mix.|$|E
5|$|The film's {{world premiere}} was on April 2, 1968, at the Uptown Theater in Washington, D.C. It opened {{two days later}} at the Warner Cinerama Theatre in Hollywood and the Loew's Capitol in New York. Kubrick then deleted {{nineteen}} minutes of footage from the film before its general release in five other U.S. cities on April 10, 1968, and internationally in five cities the following day, where it was shown in 70mm format, used a six-track stereo magnetic soundtrack, and projected in the 2.21:1 aspect ratio. The general release of the film in its 35mm anamorphic format took place in autumn 1968 and used either a four-track magnetic stereo soundtrack or an optical <b>monaural</b> soundtrack.|$|E
5|$|Because {{microcomputers}} in Japan {{were not}} powerful enough {{at the time}} to perform the complex tasks involved in designing and programming Space Invaders, Nishikado had to design his own custom hardware and development tools for the game. He created the arcade board using new microprocessors from the United States. The game uses an Intel 8080 central processing unit, features raster graphics on a CRT monitor and <b>monaural</b> sound hosted by a combination of analog circuitry and a Texas Instruments SN76477 sound chip. Despite the specially developed hardware, Nishikado was unable to program the game as he wanted—the Control Program board was not powerful enough to display the graphics in color or move the enemies faster—and he considered the development of the hardware {{the most difficult part of}} the whole process. While programming the game, Nishikado discovered that the processor was able to render the alien graphics faster the fewer were on screen. Rather than design the game to compensate for the speed increase, he decided to keep it as a challenging gameplay mechanism.|$|E
5|$|The game {{features}} <b>monaural</b> {{sound and}} pixel graphics on a 19inch CRT monitor. The initial concept was conceived by John Kotlarik, who aimed {{to create a}} non-violent game. Inspired by Pac-Man, he envisioned similar gameplay in an open playing field {{rather than in a}} maze. Python Anghelo furthered the concept by creating artwork and a scenario. Kotlarik designed the protagonist to have fluid movement like it was traveling on a slick surface. The control scheme allows the digital input to operate similar to an analogue one. He programmed the bubble to accelerate in the direction the joystick is held. Once the joystick returns to its neutral position, the bubble will coast as the velocity slowly decreases. Anghelo designed the artwork for the wooden cabinets as well as a new cylindrical, plastic cabinet. Gary Berge, a mechanical engineer, created the new cabinets with a rotational molding process.|$|E
5|$|During the Second World War, Sargent and the Liverpool Philharmonic {{accompanied}} Albert Sammons, the dedicatee, in his 1944 {{recording of}} the Delius Violin Concerto. Later, in 1965, with Jacqueline du Pré, in her début recording, Sargent recorded Delius's Cello Concerto, coupled with the Songs of Farewell (1965). At {{the end of the}} war, Sargent turned to recording Elgar. A recording regularly chosen over all others in comparative surveys is the first of Sargent's two versions of Elgar's The Dream of Gerontius with Heddle Nash as tenor and the familiar Sargent pairing of the Huddersfield Choral Society and the Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra, recorded in 1945. Sargent was also the conductor for Heifetz's 1949 recording of Elgar's Violin Concerto and Paul Tortelier's first {{recording of the}} Cello Concerto in 1954. He also recorded Elgar's Wand of Youth Suite No. 2, with the BBC; the Pomp and Circumstance Marches 1 and 4 with the LSO; and the Enigma Variations with the Philharmonia. Sargent made two recordings of Holst's The Planets: a <b>monaural</b> version with the LSO for Decca (1950) and a stereo version with the BBC for EMI (1960). He also recorded shorter Holst pieces: The Perfect Fool ballet music and the Beni Mora suite.|$|E

25|$|The {{recording}} {{was issued}} in both stereo (DOS 687) and <b>monaural</b> (DOL 287) formats. It was out-of-print for many years, was not released in other formats, and is highly prized among collectors, as a play with such adult themes {{had never been}} recorded {{for the general public}} before.|$|E
25|$|Clear-Com, Telex, RTS {{and many}} other {{production}} intercom systems use four-pin XLR connectors for attaching <b>monaural</b> intercom headsets or handsets. The standard pinout for four-pin XLR headsets is: Pin 1 = Microphone ground (screen/shield); Pin 2 = Microphone signal ("hot") input; Pin 3 = Headphone ground (return); Pin 4 = Headphone signal ("hot") output.|$|E

25|$|On 22 September 2003, Hilltop Hoods {{released}} {{their third}} album, The Calling, {{which became a}} commercial breakthrough. In an interview {{after the release of}} their fourth album, Suffa revealed that The Calling was recorded on his mother's computer and the simplicity of their 'studio' is the reason why some of the music on the album is in <b>monaural</b> ('mono') sound.|$|E
25|$|Jeffress {{was known}} for {{building}} and testing models to simulate components of the auditory system. In particular, he simultaneously developed mathematical and electrical models of <b>monaural</b> signal detection and compared their performance under a number of stimulus manipulations to that of humans detecting under the same stimulus conditions. The final versions of these models were highly successful at predicting numerous psychophysical facts.|$|E
25|$|Disney's {{distribution}} arm, Buena Vista Distribution, originally released Sleeping Beauty to {{theaters in}} both standard 35mm prints and large-format 70mm prints. The Super Technirama 70 prints were equipped with six-track stereophonic sound; some CinemaScope-compatible 35mm Technirama prints were released in four-track stereo, {{and others had}} <b>monaural</b> soundtracks. On the initial run, Sleeping Beauty was paired with the short musical/documentary film Grand Canyon which won an Academy Award.|$|E
25|$|The show is {{typically}} available in three formats: 64 kbit/s MP3, 32 kbit/s MP3, and 64 kbit/s AAC. Occasionally, other bitrates {{are used for}} episodes produced in stereo, however most episodes are <b>monaural.</b> The files are available as direct downloads, with bandwidth provided by Cachefly. On 23 February 2014, before recording TWiT 446, Laporte stated that episode bandwidth for the entire network is around 950 terabytes per month.|$|E
25|$|Jeffress' first {{project at}} DRL was to {{determine}} whether the improvement humans show when detecting binaural rather than <b>monaural</b> signals could be adapted to Navy sonars. Jeffress designed and built an experimental binaural sonar that he and his students tested at Austin's Lake Travis. While this project was unsuccessful, it initiated a program at DRL on masking and binaural hearing that endured, and was highly productive, for more than 20 years.|$|E
25|$|VCDs {{are often}} bilingual. Because they feature stereo audio, disc players have {{an option to}} play only {{the left or right}} audio channel. On some films, they feature English on the left audio channel and Cantonese on the right; more {{commonly}} Hong Kong VCDs will feature Mandarin on one channel and Cantonese on the other. This is similar to selecting a language track on a DVD, except it's limited to 2 languages, due to there being only two audio channels (left and right). The audio track effectively becomes <b>monaural.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{some ways}} {{similar to the}} laser {{turntable}} is the IRENE scanning machine for disc records, which images with microphotography in two dimensions, invented {{by a team of}} physicists at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratories. IRENE will retrieve the information from a laterally modulated <b>monaural</b> grooved sound source without touching the medium itself, but cannot read vertically modulated information. This excludes grooved recordings such as cylinders and some radio transcriptions that feature a hill-and-dale format of recording, and stereophonic or quadraphonic grooved recordings, which utilize {{a combination of the two}} as well as supersonic encoding for quadraphonic.|$|E
25|$|An FM signal {{can also}} be used to carry a stereo signal; this is done with {{multiplexing}} and demultiplexing before and after the FM process. The FM modulation and demodulation process is identical in stereo and <b>monaural</b> processes. A high-efficiency radio-frequency switching amplifier can be used to transmit FM signals (and other constant-amplitude signals). For a given signal strength (measured at the receiver antenna), switching amplifiers use less battery power and typically cost less than a linear amplifier. This gives FM another advantage over other modulation methods requiring linear amplifiers, such as AM and QAM.|$|E
25|$|Standard {{convenience}} features {{included a}} custom luxury steering wheel, column-mounted manual shifter, woodgrain dashboard trim, inside hood release, individual reclining front seats with adjustable headrests, center folding arm rest, fixed two-point seatbelts, two-speed electric wipers, electric washers integrated to the wiper arms, 140km/h speedometer, courtesy lights, <b>monaural</b> AM radio {{with a single}} in-dash speaker, electric analog clock, heater with windshield defroster, lighter, dashboard ashtray, locking glove box, tinted windshield, plastic door panels with cloth insert and pull strap, dual rear ashtrays, folding down rear bench seat, trunk carpet, sound-insulating cardboard-type headliner (U.S. base model type), and round dome light.|$|E
25|$|Compact Cassettes contain two {{miniature}} spools, between {{which the}} magnetically coated, polyester-type plastic film (magnetic tape) is passed and wound. These spools and their attendant parts are held inside a protective plastic shell. Two stereo pairs of tracks (four total) or two <b>monaural</b> audio tracks {{are available on}} the tape; one stereo pair or one monophonic track is played or recorded when the tape is moving in one direction and the second (pair) when moving in the other direction. This reversal is achieved either by manually flipping the cassette, or by the machine automatically changing the direction of tape movement ("auto-reverse") when it detects that the tape has come to an end.|$|E
25|$|The logical {{format of}} an audio CD (officially Compact Disc Digital Audio or CD-DA) is {{described}} in a document produced in 1980 by the format's joint creators, Sony and Philips. The document is known colloquially as the Red Book CD-DA after the colour of its cover. The format is a two-channel 16-bit PCM encoding at a 44.1kHz sampling rate per channel. Four-channel sound was to be an allowable option within the Red Book format, but has never been implemented. <b>Monaural</b> audio has no existing standard on a Red Book CD; thus, mono source material is usually presented as two identical channels in a standard Red Book stereo track (i.e., mirrored mono); an MP3 CD, however, can have audio file formats with mono sound.|$|E
25|$|In early March of that year, neuroscientists Ursula Bellugi and Edward Klima {{came from}} the Salk Institute for Biological Studies to {{administer}} their own series of brain exams on Genie. Audiometry tests confirmed that she had regular hearing in both ears, but {{on a series of}} dichotic listening tests Bellugi and Klima found that she identified language sounds with 100% accuracy in her left ear while correctly answering at only a chance level in her right ear. Such an extreme level of asymmetry on these tests had previously only been documented in patients with either split-brain or who had undergone a hemispherectomy as an adult. When they gave her <b>monaural</b> tests for both language and non-language sounds she answered with 100% accuracy in both ears, which was normal. On non-language dichotic listening tests she showed a slight preference for identifying non-language sounds in her left ear, which was typical for a right-handed person and helped rule out the possibility of her brain only being reversed in dominance for language.|$|E
25|$|Barber's Symphony No. 2 {{has been}} {{recorded}} by over a dozen orchestras. A 1951 recording of the 1947 revised version of Symphony No. 2 is available by the New Symphony Orchestra with Samuel Barber conducting. The <b>monaural</b> recording was originally released on a ten-inch LP by London Records, who reissued it in 1956 on a twelve-inch disc, coupled with the ballet suite from Medea. This coupling was again reissued in 1970 on Everest Records, and in 1965 a new pairing of the symphony with Barber's Concerto for Cello and Orchestra, conducted by Barber with the same orchestra and Zara Nelsova, cello, was issued in London on the Ace of Clubs imprint of Decca Records. More recently, this recording of the symphony was released on CD by Pavilion Records in 2001. A recording of the broadcast of the world premiere by the Boston Symphony Orchestra is held by the Motion Picture, Broadcasting, and Recorded Sound Division of the Library of Congress in Washington, D.C. This recording has been released commercially on CD by AS Disc in 1989, and by Pristine Audio in 2017 as part of Koussevitzky Conducts Barber, PASC 217.|$|E
