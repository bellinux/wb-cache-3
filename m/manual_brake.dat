500|$|Shortly {{after the}} incident, WMATA General Manager John Catoe {{stated that the}} cause was not known but that [...] "the system is safe." [...] The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) began an investigation. WMATA and NTSB {{investigators}} considered several possible causes, which might include operator error, brake failure, fault in the computerized signal and operation system, {{or a combination of}} the three. During rush hour operation, train movement is typically controlled by a centralized computer system, and a separate decentralized system can automatically apply the brakes to prevent a collision. These systems had failed at least once in the past, and the NTSB subsequently identified incompatible specifications, from the maximum deceleration capability of the trains to the deceleration rates used in the wayside system design. [...] The train has a manual emergency brake, which can be applied by the driver {{in the event of an}} imminent collision, if the driver can see and identify the hazard with sufficient time to stop. Officials indicated that the <b>manual</b> <b>brake</b> was indeed engaged. It is possible that the brake system failed to perform as designed, or that the operator applied the brake too late. The lead car of the moving train was two months overdue for scheduled brake maintenance. In a press conference the evening of June 22, Catoe stated that the last car on the stopped train was a CAF 5000-Series car (car 5066), which entered service in 2001, and that the lead car on the moving train was a Rohr Industries 1000-Series car. WMATA later confirmed that all of the cars on the moving train were 1000-Series.|$|E
5000|$|Control in Real Racing 2 {{is similar}} to that of its predecessor. The player is given five {{different}} control methods from which to choose: Method A features accelerometer steering (tilting the physical device to the left to turn left and to the right to turn right), auto accelerate and manual brake; Method B features accelerometer steering, manual accelerate and manual brake; Method C features a virtual on-screen steering wheel to steer, auto accelerate and <b>manual</b> <b>brake,</b> Method D features a virtual steering wheel to steer, manual accelerate and manual brake; Method E features touch to steer (where the play touches the left side of the touchscreen to turn left, and the right side to turn right), auto accelerate and <b>manual</b> <b>brake.</b> Within each of these options, the player can modify the amount of brake assist and steering assist, as well as selecting to turn on or off [...] "anti-skid". In Methods A and B, the accelerometer sensitivity can also be modified.|$|E
5000|$|The Tamora is {{fitted with}} a TVR's {{in-house}} 'Speed Six', a DOHC 3605 cc six-cylinder engine rated at [...] at 7200 rpm and 290 lbft Nm of torque at 5500 rpm, mated to a five-speed <b>manual.</b> <b>Brake</b> rotors are 12.0 in up front, and 11.1 in in the back, both clamped by AP Racing calipers. The suspension is a double wishbone setup at all four corners. Standard wheels are 16×7 inch aluminium, with 225/50ZR-16 Avon ZZ3 tires.|$|E

50|$|Capable of {{achieving}} {{speeds up to}} 42 km/h, the 1,085m Alpine Coaster track slides over bumps, twists through corkscrews and zigzags through the trees of the Niagara Escarpment covering 475 vertical metres. The carts are capable of holding two people at a time, and riders can use a <b>manual</b> <b>brake</b> to control their speed as they descend the track. The resort has since added a mini-Putt course, a high ropes climbing facility and a zipline facility {{to be completed in}} the fall of 2013.|$|E
50|$|On 25 November 1941, {{seven men}} {{were killed and}} 53 were injured when a trolley {{transporting}} miners down a sharply sloping shaft ran out of control. The incident happened at the 'Gorky' drift mine, with ninety men and boys taking the spake, an open-sided trolley fitted with cross planks for seating and a central overhead handrail as a holding point, down to the workings 525 yards below. The surface engineman suffered a temporary blackout and the <b>manual</b> <b>brake</b> was disengaged, causing the spake to quickly build up speed. Most of the injuries and fatalities were to miners who leapt from the spake and were thrown back under the trolley due to the narrowness of the drift shaft.|$|E

50|$|The Dragon Coaster's {{boarding}} station is {{wrapped around the}} right leg of the layout. After climbing into the new Morgan trains, the operator pushes a lever to release the still used <b>manual</b> <b>braking</b> system. The trains roll down a short inclined curve toward the lift hill.|$|R
50|$|Standard {{equipment}} on the Apollo included {{in no particular}} order, a 250 cubic-inch 1-barrel L-6, semi-closed cooling system, <b>manual</b> <b>brakes</b> with finned front drums, coil spring front suspension with stabilizer bar, extensive use on insulation and sound deadening materials, flow-through ventilation system, full-foam seats, front and rear ashtrays, strong, reinforced front bumpers, carpeting, deluxe steering wheel, roof drip moldings, and front and rear wheel opening moldings.|$|R
2500|$|The {{aircraft}} {{touched down}} on the wet runway at [...] over the target airspeed. Furthermore, it touched down [...] from the runway threshold, [...] beyond the 1000–1500ft range established by the Southwest Airlines FOM. The captain deployed the thrust reversers and then he and the first officer applied <b>manual</b> <b>brakes,</b> {{but according to the}} NTSB findings, under those conditions even maximum braking would not have prevented the aircraft from overrunning the end of the runway.|$|R
50|$|Restart after a {{shutdown}} {{required the}} assistance of the parks' maintenance staff. One person would go to the <b>manual</b> <b>brake</b> release under the C brake while the other ran the control panel brake in the house. One train would be taken {{to the top of the}} lift and stopped. The second train would be stopped at the C brake before the second inverted loop. The third train would be in the house. To start the process, the C brake was pulled to release the train for the second loop. The lift train would be released as soon as the C block train was clear of the brake. Once the lift train cleared the house train was released. This was done several times during the first year of operation until the ride was reduced to two trains.|$|E

5000|$|The pilots {{received}} several computer-generated wind shear and glide slope deviation warnings, and observed severe airspeed fluctuations, {{during the last}} mile before touchdown. The auto brakes were set at only the number two level and then were turned off moments after touchdown, when the Captain elected to use <b>manual</b> <b>braking</b> and thrust reversal. The speedbrakes were extended momentarily, but then retracted. This caused the plane to [...] "float," [...] making the brakes ineffective until the speed brakes were extended again.|$|R
50|$|The landing continued, but <b>manual</b> <b>braking</b> did not {{commence}} {{until the}} aircraft was over 1,600 metres down the runway. Then the plane proceeded to hydroplane and skid {{its way down}} the runway, departing substantially from runway centreline. Company standard operating procedure mandated that idle reverse thrust {{should be used for}} landings and that flaps should be set at 25 degrees, not the maximum of 30 degrees. The combination of flaps 25, no auto-braking, no reverse thrust, a high and fast approach, a late touch down, poor Cockpit Resource Management, and the standing water on the runway led to a runway overshoot.|$|R
40|$|The braking {{performance}} of a nine-place, light, twin-engine airplane was evaluated on comparative grooved and ungrooved surfaces of the landing research runway at NASA Wallops Station. The test airplane was equipped with <b>manual</b> <b>braking</b> on the main wheels of the tricycle landing gear, and its weight varied from 33. 4 to 35. 6 kN (7500 to 8000 Ib). The test results indicate that pavement grooving significantly improves aircraft braking and directional control on wet runways. Measurements and observations of airplane tire treads made during this test program showed no indication of unusual wear and/or damage attributable to grooved surfaces. Comparative braking data obtained with a jet fighter and a civil and a military jet transport are also presented. Includes bibliographical references (p. 13 - 14).

40|$|Abstract. The {{brake system}} {{plays a key}} role in the vehicle safety system. The drivers usually cannot depress the brake pedal {{immediately}} in emergencies. A new vehicle brake-assist mechanism using the transmission principle of the clutch is designed to solve this problem. This mechanism can automatically assist drivers to handle the emergency when they failed to brake in time. Thus, the danger can be avoided initiatively. Through experiment, the reliability and effectiveness of the actuator is proved. Compared to <b>manual</b> <b>brake,</b> the designed mechanism can be more exact and rapid...|$|E
50|$|As {{the medical}} {{director}} of the Marion Nursing Home for some three decades, he became aware of the problem of wheelchair-related falls among semi-ambulatory patients who did not or could not remember to use <b>manual</b> <b>brakes</b> on their wheelchairs. Some patients in wheelchairs, particularly the elderly, have a tendency to fall and injure themselves when trying to stand because they fail to engage the manual locks. Dugas hence attempted {{to find a way to}} save these patients from potentially debilitating injuries. He began his experimentation with locking systems and procured his first patent (#5,203,433) on April 20, 1993. The wheelchair locks/brakes are made of stainless steel, and worked well but were heavy and had a tendency to require maintenance.|$|R
25|$|<b>Manual</b> hand <b>brakes</b> {{serve to}} keep a piece of rolling stock {{stationary}} {{after it has been}} spotted in a rail yard or at a customer for unloading or loading. They are also used to secure a parked train from inadvertent movement, especially while unmanned.|$|R
500|$|The enquiry report {{submitted}} by the Civil Aviation Ministry said that Glušica slept for over 90 minutes during the flight. The Air India Express IX 812 [...] carrying 166 people from Dubai including the crew, crashed while negotiating a tricky landing at Mangalore city's [...] "table-top" [...] airport overlooking a ravine. The American National Transportation Safety Board says {{it was the first}} instance of snoring recorded on a Cockpit Voice Recorder (CVR). Analysis of the accident revealed that had the pilot [...] "deployed détente reverse thrust and applied maximum <b>manual</b> <b>braking</b> at touchdown", the aircraft could have been stopped within the paved overrun area of the runway. The captain had exacerbated the long landing by attempting a go-around following deployment of the thrust reversers.|$|R
50|$|On 18 May 2005, a Jordanian Airbus A320, {{registration}} JY-JAR operating for LTE {{suffered a}} braking malfunction on landing at Leeds Bradford Airport following {{a flight from}} Fuerteventura Airport. The aircraft touched down on runway 14 just beyond the touchdown zone, approximately 400 m (1,300 ft) beyond the aiming point. The pilots determined {{that the rate of}} deceleration was inadequate and applied full reverse thrust and full <b>manual</b> <b>braking</b> in an effort to stop the aircraft, however the normal braking system malfunctioned and the Captain turned the aircraft onto a level grassed area {{to the right of the}} runway where it came to rest. There were no injuries to the passengers or crew, however the Air Accidents Investigation Branch made seven safety recommendations in the final accident report.|$|R
5000|$|Each power car is {{fitted with}} two {{traction}} motors of [...] total output, delivered via shafts and gear drives, using a permanently operating cogwheel with {{a diameter of}} 573 mm.

50|$|On 10 June 2013 a Xian MA60 {{passenger}} plane, Myanma Airways Flight 309, registered XY-AIP, {{sustained damage}} in a runway excursion accident at Kawthaung Airport (KAW), Myanmar. There were 64 persons on board, {{no one was}} injured. The Myanma Airways airplane operated on a domestic flight from Yangon to Mawlamyine and Kawthaung. Departing Mawlamyine at 11:10 hours local time, the flight was uneventful until the approach for landing. The aircraft was configured with landing gear when the “hydraulic pressure low”(LEFPL) warning light illuminated. After landing, the pilot started using <b>manual</b> <b>braking</b> and selected the nose gear to taxi mode. The airplane veered left and went off the runway, running into fence pillars, turning the aircraft 90 degrees to the left. The aircraft came to rest upon striking a tree with the left hand wing, 150 feet {{from the side of}} the runway.|$|R
5000|$|The railway had six {{of these}} four-wheel {{vehicles}} which saw use carrying long loads commonly {{being used in}} pairs; each had <b>manual</b> parking <b>brakes</b> and they survived until {{the final years of}} the railway largely out of use latterly. All had a grey livery on woodwork and black metal and frames, they were numbered along their edges.|$|R
50|$|After {{a review}} of the love between Yuto Sakurai and Airi Nogami, with the man sacrificing his {{existence}} to help his past incarnation act as Kamen Rider Zeronos in order to protect both Airi and time itself, scene opens to Airi and Ryotaro are renovating the Milk Dipper. Seigi Ozaki and Issē Miura arrive while Ryotaro is suddenly possessed by Momotaros who spirits him off while telling him that the DenLiner has been hijacked by an Imagin. But on the way, M-Ryotaro senses two thugs attacking Airi during her walk and arrives in time to beat them out of thinking they are in league with the Imagin, only to hear that a young man put them up to it. Seeing Yuto leaving the scene makes it more confusing as M-Ryotaro loses him before Urataros calls that the DenLiner stopped thanks to the <b>manual</b> <b>brakes.</b>|$|R
2500|$|The first hull {{loss of a}} 747-400 {{occurred}} on November 4, 1993 when China Airlines Flight 605, flying from Taipei to Hong Kong Kai Tak Airport, touched down more than [...] past the runway's displaced threshold during 20 knot (gusting 38) crosswinds. Combined with the disengagement of auto brakes and retracted speed <b>brakes,</b> <b>manual</b> <b>braking</b> and thrust reversal were not enough to prevent the aircraft from sliding into Victoria Harbour. No one was seriously injured, but the aircraft was written off. The type's second hull loss {{occurred on}} October 31, 2000, when Singapore Airlines Flight 006, a 747-400 flying on a Singapore to Los Angeles route via Taipei, rammed into construction equipment while attempting to take off from a closed runway at Chiang Kai-shek International Airport. The aircraft caught fire and was destroyed, killing 79 passengers and four crew members. The cause was attributed to the flight crew navigating to the wrong runway.|$|R
50|$|The Wuling Sunshine is {{available}} {{with a range}} of petrol engines, with power outputs that vary from 34.7 to 63 Kw (50-84 SAE HP), which consume between 6.8 and 7.8 L/100km. The engine is mid-mounted, and drives the rear wheels via a five speed <b>manual</b> gearbox. <b>Brakes</b> are hydraulic, with discs in front and drums at the rear, and steering is of the rack and pinion type.|$|R
50|$|However {{the same}} {{technique}} {{can be accomplished}} by a driver through the use of the <b>manual</b> parking <b>brake</b> lever, coordinated with the brake, clutch, gear shift and accelerator. This is a standard technique in most countries where manual transmissions remain popular, for example the UK. Cars equipped with a parking brake pedal are not suited for this maneuver unless it is released by hand, for example in the Citroen XM.|$|R
5000|$|The M-408 was a {{conventional}} rear-wheel drive economy car {{powered by a}} 1357 cc OHV straight-four, producing [...] at 4750 rpm (60.5 SAE hp)). After 1967, the assembly of the engines was done by UZAM in Ufa. One two-barrel down-draft carburettor was used. The car was initially equipped with self-adjusting <b>manual</b> drum <b>brakes,</b> then from 1969 with power brakes with a hydrovacuum servo and a split circuit braking system.|$|R
25|$|In 2002, Unique Performance, {{a company}} of Farmers Branch, Texas, {{purchased}} a license from Carroll Shelby Enterprises to place his name {{on a series of}} continuation vintage vehicles. This company specialized in recreating 1960s-style Shelby Mustangs. They purchased used Mustangs and installed updated versions of the Shelby 325-horsepower 302-cubic-inch V8 engine. They also utilize modern five-speed <b>manual</b> transmissions, <b>brakes,</b> steering, suspension, interiors and entertainment systems. Because Shelby's license was purchased, these cars have Shelby serial numbers.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "Big Dipper" [...] at Camden Park (amusement park), in Huntington, West Virginia , {{was built}} in 1958. The Big Dipper {{features}} original Century Flyer cars with working headlights, and a classic figure-eight track design. The ride's name refers to a big dip measuring almost the full height of the roller coaster after the first turn. A second, shallower dip leads into an unlit tunnel, from which the cars emerge shortly {{before returning to the}} pavilion to let off passengers. The [...] "Big Dipper" [...] and [...] "Little Dipper" [...] (also built by NAD and located at Camden Park) are both still in operation, as of 2015, running with no seat belts and <b>manual</b> <b>brakes.</b> Although John A. Miller is often credited with designing the [...] "Big Dipper" [...] at Camden Park, he, in fact, did not. The confusion lies with the common name of the coaster, in that he designed three other coasters also named [...] "Big Dipper", located in Aurora, OH (1926), Blackpool, England (1923), and Chicago, IL (1920). The Camden Park coaster was actually designed with the help of Aurel Vaszin, the founder and owner of NAD.|$|R
50|$|The NA {{series was}} {{released}} to Australia during January 1983 in short- (SWB) and long-wheelbase (LWB) three-door wagon formats, with the 2.6-liter petrol or 2.3-liter turbo diesel, both mated to a five-speed KM145 <b>manual</b> transmission. <b>Brakes</b> were ventilated front discs and rear drums. The five-door, high-roof LWB model {{was introduced in}} May 1984 with the same powertrain options. The five-door offered a luxury Superwagon trim and also had a shorter final drive than the SWB models, {{to make up for}} the increased weight.|$|R
50|$|Taxi {{tests of}} the XP-56 began on 6 April 1943 and showed a serious yaw problem. At first, it {{was thought to be}} caused by uneven wheel brakes, and {{considerable}} effort was placed into fixing this problem. <b>Manual</b> hydraulic <b>brakes</b> were installed and the aircraft flew on 30 September 1943 at Muroc Air Base in southern California. Eventually, the yaw problem was traced to a lack of aerodynamic stability, and to fix this the upper vertical stabilizer was enlarged from a mere stub, to one virtually matching the ventral unit in shape and area.|$|R
5000|$|Electric park brakes (EPB) {{are used}} on {{passenger}} vehicles {{to hold the}} vehicle stationary on grades and flat roads. This was accomplished traditionally using a <b>manual</b> parking <b>brake.</b> With electric park brakes, the driver activates the holding mechanism with a button and the brake pads are then electrically applied onto the rear brakes. This is accomplished by an electronic control unit (ECU) and an actuator mechanism. There are two mechanisms that are currently in production: 1. Cable puller systems and 2. Caliper integrated systems. [...] EPB systems {{can be considered a}} subset of Brake-by-wire technology.|$|R
