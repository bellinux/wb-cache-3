40|$|Individual-based data {{on little}} terns Sterna albifrons at a post-breeding {{moulting}} area {{were used to}} investigate the spatial extent at which this site attract birds. Combining information collected on young terns, ringed at the natal colonies, with that on birds captured {{a few months later}} at the <b>moulting</b> <b>site,</b> we estimated a survival/movement parameter for each age-by-colony combination. This parameter is the product between the survival probability and the probability to visit the <b>moulting</b> <b>site.</b> The distance between the natal colony and the <b>moulting</b> <b>site</b> negatively influenced the probability of reaching the site in yearlings. Having corrected for the distance from the moulting area, colony characteristics explained only about 10 % of the spatial variation in the survival/ movement parameter of juveniles. In older birds that had visited the site at least once in their life, neither the colony nor the distance affected the survival/movement parameter significantly. The average annual adult survival/movement probability was 0. 90. Juvenile survival between June and September was 0. 60. Overall results suggest that the moulting area could act as a 'population funnel' within a system of moult migration that involves birds breeding up to 500 km away. However, other unknown <b>moulting</b> <b>site</b> must exist within this area that could be important for the conservation of the species. © Journal of Avian Biology. Peer Reviewe...|$|E
40|$|The {{relative}} importance of prior occupancy and of asymmetries in both value of winning and in resource-holding potential for the outcome of animal contests was tested. Bluethroats, Luscinia s. svecica, were offered food ad libitum in the field. Prior to migration, at a <b>moulting</b> <b>site,</b> their weight increased rapidly and peaked after a few days. Lean birds won significantly more interactions than fat birds, probably owing to higher motivation {{to fight for the}} food. Dominance between individuals shifted and was not correlated with size or prior occupancy. During the subsequent migration, at a stopover site, the bluethroats gained weight throughout their stay. Dominance between individuals was constant and positively correlated with size, whereas fat reserves and prior occupancy had no effect on contest resolution. Fat deposition rates were positively correlated with dominance status. The different dominance patterns are explained in terms of different gain curves of fat for birds putting on fat for survival and migration, respectively. Though prior occupancy had no general effect on dominance patterns, such an uncorrelated asymmetry may have been used to settle single contests between fat birds at the <b>moulting</b> <b>site.</b> The fact that dominance (acting through differences in size) influences fat deposition rates may be important for the spatial and temporal pattern of migration in birds that compete for resources at stopover sites...|$|E

Lip to 1992, 72 % of all neck-banded Greylag Geese recorded front a moulting area were reported from Oostvaardeusplassen in the Netherlands, 600 km from the marking area. After 1992, there was a change in the moult migration and the majority of the reports of moulting Greylag Geese from Scania were from the Danish island of Saltholm a distance of 50 km away.

Distances moved by birds in the mesic, winter-rainfall, south-western region (Strandfontein) of South Africa were compared with movements in the semi-arid, summer-rainfall region (Barberspan) of northern South Africa.

Four of these occurred during the pre-breeding season and seven during the post moult period. A monitoring study was initiated in 1999 to evaluate the movements of geese around the airport and determine appropriate mitigation strategies {{to reduce the risk}} of birdstrike. <b>Moult</b> <b>sites</b> within 13 km of the airport were identified. 4, 900 moulting geese were caught and fitted with colour rings and radio-transmitters between 1999 and 2004. 2, 500 visits were made to over 300 sites resulting in over 10, 000 sightings of known individuals. Birds that crossed the airport approaches whilst moving between roost sites and feeding areas in newly harvested cereal crops were identified. Throughout the monitoring period efforts were made to control the risk, but by 2003 it was estimated that 10, 000 bird transits of the approaches involving almost 700 individuals occurred during a 50 day period. The knowledge of the movements of ringed and tagged birds was used to inform a revised habitat management, daily roost dispersal and on-airfield bird deterrence programme in 2004.

40|$|The {{impact of}} {{predation}} by an avian predator (great crested grebe Podiceps cristatus) and a predatory fish (perch Perca fluviatilis) {{on a common}} resource, the small planktivorous fish smelt (Osmerus eperlanus) was studied in Lake IJsselmeer, The Netherlands, in July-October 1985 - 1988. At {{this time of the}} year the grebes are in simultaneous wing-moult and therefore temporarily flightless. Four factors limit the predation pressure by grebes: (1) an underwater visibility threshold of c. 40 cm Secchi depth is the lower limit at which large numbers attend the <b>moulting</b> <b>site,</b> (2) a lower density threshold of exploitable smelt biomass of c. 30 kg/ha determines the actual fishing areas, (3) a fish size threshold of 6. 5 cm total length further limits prey availability, and (4) the vertical movements of the prey impose a strong (diel) time constraint on the birds, allowing only crepuscular foraging. Perch, the other main predator in this system, is less restricted in its foraging. Perch were found to be in direct competition with the grebes, preying heavily on the juvenile smelt. Over the 4 years of study 90 % of all predation from 15 July to 15 October (72 - 233 kg/ha) was due to perch. The high level of predation by birds and fish was only possible due to a continuous immigration of smelt into the area (1. 45 kg/ha per day). In three of the four years, however, the combined predation by fish and birds surpassed the immigration rate of the prey, which led to a strong reduction in smelt stocks in the study area. A conceptual model is developed to describe the different sets of constraints on the grebes' foraging. First, the state of eutrophication in relation to the weather condition determines the degree of algal blooms, and thus underwater visibility, in late summer. This is the major factor governing the numbers of grebes on the moulting area. Second, the size of the population of predatory fish determines the overall food availability (biomass and size distribution of smelt). These factors are partly interconnected and related to human action (pollution, fisheries). It is suggested that, despite deteriorating visibility conditions, the largest <b>moulting</b> <b>site</b> for grebes in Europe at Lake IJsselmeer exists because the stocks of predatory fish are kept low by overfishing. ...|$|E
40|$|Photo-identification (photo-ID) with camera traps was {{examined}} as a non-invasive method for studying and monitoring the endangered Saimaa ringed seal Phoca hispida saimensis. An average of 51 game cameras {{were set up}} at shoreline haul-out sites in central Lake Saimaa during the moulting seasons {{in each of the}} years from 2010 to 2014. Individuals were identified from their lifelong unique lateral fur patterns. A total of 220 000 digital images of seals were obtained from these game cameras and from digital cameras during this period, allowing 164 individuals to be identified, 43 % of which were re-sighted in successive years. In the majority of game camera images, both sides of the seal were shown, and it was possible to determine the sex of the seal. The average distance between sightings of individual seals in different years was 1. 6 km, suggesting that Saimaa ringed seals exhibit a high degree of <b>moulting</b> <b>site</b> fidelity. In addition, the results support suggestions of natal site fidelity. We propose that photo-ID sampling based on camera traps, and larger-scale photographic survey of the seals, should be implemented as a population monitoring tool of the Saimaa ringed seal. Further application of the photo-ID technique may facilitate mark-recapture population and survival rate estimates for this threatened seal species and provide significant insights into its life history and social behaviour...|$|E

For this we used a unique long-term dataset of 5821 grebes captured for ringing throughout the moulting seasons of 2006 - 2012 in the Odiel salt-marshes (SW Spain). The grebes were sexed and classified as adults (74 %) or juveniles (26 %). Birds ringed at Odiel were recovered over a wide area up to central Russia and south to the Canary Islands and Morocco. We report on a unique case of a strongly biased sex ratio in a moult-migrating bird species with biparental care, in which adult females were significantly more abundant than adult males in all 7 years (1. 6 - 4. 2 females per male). Biased sex ratios were not found among juveniles. Differences between North America and Europe in the sex ratios of adult Black-necked Grebes at moulting sites {{may be explained by}} the much larger American moulting sites, which would facilitate an unbiased sex ratio in North America, but not in Europe.

40|$|International audienceThe {{trade-off}} foragers make between predation {{risk and}} feeding efficiency is readily studied in dabbling ducks, which have stereotyped feeding methods, {{some of which}} prevent predator detection while others do not. Teals forage mostly with only the bill submerged (eyes above the water surface) in winter, but use a broader foraging repertoire in summer. Given the different environments used by teals over the year, {{it is likely that}} such a shift is due to changes in diet, but it may also be caused by differences in predation risk between habitats. However, neither predation risk nor teal behaviour has been studied with consistent methods around the year or throughout any of its flyways. Covering wintering, spring-staging, breeding and <b>moulting</b> <b>sites,</b> we combined focal observations of teals and predator flyover data from seven regions ranging from southern France to northern Sweden. Although not apparent at the scale of days within sites, teals indeed relied more on shallow foraging where predation risk was higher, i. e. at wintering sites. Average foraging depth increased gradually from September to August, i. e. from wintering to breeding sites. Foraging bout length of deeply foraging teals did not decrease over the year, suggesting that it is through selection of foraging technique, rather than by the balance between foraging and interruptions, that birds adjust to predation risk. This study highlights behavioural plasticity in response to contrasting selection regimes within a flyway, in dabbling ducks as well as long-distance migrants in general...|$|R
40|$|Six {{adult male}} pink-footed geese (Anser brachyrhynchus), tagged with {{satellite}} transmitters, were tracked in Svalbard {{during the period}} of June–September in 2003 and 2004. The {{purpose of the study was}} to describe the movements and staging periods of individual geese during the post-breeding period to investigate a possible moult migration among pink-footed geese in Svalbard. All geese moved about 200 km east from their potential breeding (summering) areas in western Spitsbergen. The preferred moulting area was the island of Edgeøya, where four geese staged prior to a southward autumn migration. Five geese left potential breeding areas between 11 and 30 June, and remained for more than 25 days in eastern areas during most of July, which we interpret as the moult migration of either failed or non-breeders. Geese left moulting areas in mid-August, using an average of 1. 4 staging areas before the autumn migration, suggesting that <b>moult</b> <b>sites</b> support pre-migration hyperphagia. Only one goose remained at the suspected breeding site from early June to early September. Mean monthly temperatures in the summering and moulting ranges of the geese were calculated from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite data. The mean June moult range temperature (− 0. 9 °C) was significantly lower than that of the summering ranges (4. 6 °C). The July mean moult range temperature did not differ significantly from that in June on the summering ranges.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Southern {{elephant}} seals Mirounga leonina migrate seasonally between pelagic foraging {{areas in}} the Southern Ocean and breeding and <b>moulting</b> <b>sites</b> on subantarctic islands. Here we characterized genetic diversity of the elephant seal moulting colony from King George Island (KGI), South Shetlands Archipelago, in comparison with breeding colonies described in earlier studies. Although KGI serves as a breeding site, the numbers of elephant seals are up to 3 times higher during the moulting season, suggesting post-breeding immigration from other sites, or {{that large numbers of}} individuals skip the breeding season every year. High haplotype diversity and a high percentage of shared haplotypes is consistent with the hypothesis of immigration from other South Atlantic colonies, which is also supported by satellite tracking data from earlier studies. Estimates of effective population size at both mtDNA and microsatellite loci were unexpectedly high compared with the census size of the KGI colony, suggesting that they were elevated due to the presence of immigrants. However, we detected few immigrants and no genetic structure in the KGI colony, which could result from the genetic similarity between KGI and other breeding colonies from the South Atlantic, but could also be an effect of an insufficient sampling scheme. These results show the need for genetic monitoring of southern elephant seal colonies throughout their annual cycle to better understand the range of their seasonal movements and patterns of gene flow. The southern elephant seal serves as a model to study links between spatio-temporal environmental variability, population dynamics, and individual movements, physiology and reproductive behavior. Understanding the patterns of dispersal and gene flow in this species is essential to adequately address these general questions...|$|R

The two lakes show differences in shoreline structure, riparian communities and humun use patterns. Lake Pearson is regularly used by people for recreation while Lake Grasmere is a Wildlife Refuge and recreation activities are restricted. Data is gathered on bird abundance and feeding activity {{over the course of}} eleven months. The bird communities of these lakes showed differences in species composition and abundance within their community structure with Lake Pearson exhibiting greater species richness and Lake Grasmere greater abundance. These differences were the result of many interactions occurring between lake morphology and component aquatic and terrestrial vegetation, season and life cycle influences and human disturbances to the lakes. Species demonstrated different responses to these factors. Extensive aquatic macrophytes in Lake Grasmere attract large abundances of waterfowl, particularly Black Swans and Canada Geese. The latter species has the potential to significantly add to the nutrient loading of the lake. Species composition and abundance were also influenced by season, with some bird species migrating away from the lakes to escape the harsh winter or to travel to breeding grounds. Lake Grasmere is important as a <b>moulting</b> <b>site</b> for waterfowl, particularly Paradise Shelduck and as a feeding habitat for the threatened species, crested Grebe.

40|$|Decapod {{crustaceans}} have complex {{life histories}} and behaviour in aspects such as foraging, mating and reproduction, moulting and growth, habitat selection and migration. New technologies have {{enabled us to}} use an individual, field-based approach to analyze these problems, although they have been less developed in decapods than in marine vertebrates. These new possibilities are discussed here mainly from a biological point of view. There is {{a brief review of}} previous applications of telemetry to analyze habitat selection, foraging behaviour, energetics, <b>moulting</b> <b>site</b> selection and migrations in decapods, and two case studies are discussed in more detail. The first one refers to the study of differences in habitat use and movement patterns in juveniles and adults of coastal species that show ontogenetic habitat shifts, related to differences in selective pressures affecting both life history stages (predation risk, and growth and reproduction optimization). The second case study is dedicated to the migratory patterns in spider crabs combining telemetry and electronic tags. Operational limitations in tracking make it impossible to get detailed information on movement patterns during migration, which in turn involve an important bathymetric gradient and a change in the oceanographic environment (mainly temperature). Monitoring depth and temperature in the immediate habitat of the animals, using electronic data storage tags recovered by the fishery, allow for movement patterns to be modeled using supplementary information on the topography and hydrography of the study area.

40|$|Includes bibliographical references. Despite the {{importance}} of movement ecology studies, the field faces a prevailing challenge of methodological limitations in tracking individual organisms. This research investigated {{the utility of the}} stable isotope technique to trace movements of ducks in southern Africa. I sampled and analysed feathers of ten duck species for stable isotope proportions of Carbon (δ 13 C), Nitrogen (δ 15 N) and Hydrogen (δD), from five wetlands (Strandfontein and Barberspan in South Africa, the Manyame catchment in Zimbabwe, Lake Chuali in Mozambique, and Lake Ngami in Botswana) as test cases. Sampling was carried out at different seasons to account for seasonal isotope signature variations. Isotope signatures of feathers grown at different moulting locations were compared to test whether southern Africa shows stable isotope spatial patterns (distinct isotopic regions). Feathers grown at different life-phases were compared to test whether different sites had been used and if more mobile species showed more and stronger isotope distinctions. Finally, growing flight feathers grown at moulting locations were compared across species to query how much information on diet and foraging behaviour can be inferred from southern African duck feather stable isotopes. Feather isotope signatures were distinct by site in {{at least one of the}} tested isotopes, for the majority of ducks tested. Strandfontein had more and stronger distinctions of isotope signatures between feathers grown at different life phases. This site is the closest to the sea and most likely to have marine-influenced isotope signatures especially in δ 15 N, it falls within the Mediterranean climatic conditions experiencing winter rainfall unlike all the other sites. Vegetation compositions (C 3 and C 4 plant distributions) therefore vary across sites influencing δ 13 C patterns. More mobile species (only Egyptian Goose Alopochen aegyptiacus from Strandfontein, and Cape Shoveler Anas smithii from Barberspan; determined by mobility scores from other studies) had more and stronger distinctions between flight and body feathers. All the other species did not comply with mobility scores. They showed weaker and fewer tissue signature distinctions than their mobility scores suggested. There were high isotopic signature overlaps in δ 13 C and δ 15 N across and within feeding guilds at each <b>moulting</b> <b>site</b> implying dietary overlaps during moulting. More overlaps occurred during the dry seasons (summer in Strandfontein and winter in Lake Chuali, Manyame catchment site, and Lake Ngami). Higher isotopic variances (higher dietary flexibility) were associated with isotope signature divergence to mobility scores especially in Cape Teals and Yellow-billed Ducks. The isotope technique is flawed with uncontrollable sources of variation which potentially confound movement inferences. It is best used when accompanied by conventional methods to detect and counter against species specific biology and dietary behaviour imposed biases in tissue isotope signatures. Further research on how species specific biological processes affect the reflection of spatial patterns of isotopes in feathers is recommended. Multi-isotope time explicit approaches and trace element analysis were also recommended. Scientists should be wary about basing management strategies or building theory about movement patterns of species based on the technique at least in stochastic environments such as southern Africa. My results provide empirical evidence that the technique is unreliable at this scale of analysis. In particular, the majority of ducks in this region are not good candidates for use of isotopic signatures in distinguishing movement patterns of southern African ducks. 498...|$|E

We combined analysis of stable hydrogen isotope ratios (δ 2 H) in flight feathers from nesting females equipped with geolocators to test whether we could correctly identify their use of moulting rivers (which show a strong north–south gradient in river water δ 2 H characteristics) based on feather δ 2 H values. The results are the first ever to demonstrate a strong positive correlation (r 2 = 0. 91) between measured river catchment water δ 2 H and feather δ 2 H from birds of known moulting location (from geolocation) in an avian piscivorous species. Furthermore, our δ 2 H results overwhelmingly supported previous determinations based on feather δ 13 C and δ 15 N measurements from the same individuals confirming that most Scaly-sided Mergansers of both sexes moulted on freshwater, although four non-breeding and failed breeding females (out of 21) and one male (out of six) apparently undertook moult migration to brackish and marine waters. The single case where the δ 2 H results contradicted previous isotopic evidence was likely due to birds eating migratory fish of marine provenance that migrate up freshwater rivers. These results confirm the potential power of feather δ 2 H to assign piscivorous birds to specific river catchment <b>moult</b> <b>sites</b> and the utility of using multiple stable isotopes to assign birds to moult habitat and location in potentially complex estuarine and brackish situations or where migratory prey may be used by birds in freshwater habitat...|$|R
40|$|This {{study focused}} on the {{dispersal}} and dispersion of southern elephant seals, Mirounga leonina, at Marion Island {{in relation to their}} natal site, and to their site of first reproduction. Movements from the natal site to terrestrial haulouts used for reproduction, and between successive reproductive sites, were defined as dispersal, while movements from the natal site to sites used for purposes other than reproduction, were defined as dispersion. Some 33000 records collected over 12 years, of haul outs at 54 different sites of 5700 tagged seals, formed the database analysed. Both male and female seals were found to use sites closer to their natal site than expected, for reproductive, moult and winter haulouts. However, breeding seals used sites closer to their site of first reproduction than their natal site, on subsequent reproductive haulouts. No difference was found between the mean distances dispersed to <b>moult</b> <b>sites</b> and to winter haulout sites, but distances of dispersal were significantly less than distances of dispersion. Female seals dispersed further than males to reproductive sites, but no difference between the sexes was apparent for moult and winter dispersion. While the number of male seals hauling out to reproduce was too small to assess the effects of various factors on the dispersal of males, a number of factors influenced the dispersion of male seals, and dispersion and dispersal of female seals. These included age, isolation of natal site, anthropogenic disturbance, natal harem size and natal harem pre-weaning mortality. A number of hypotheses are proposed to explain the reasons behind the results found, and the direction of future research concerning the movements of southern elephant seals and their choice of terrestrial environment is suggested.

40|$|Aim: We present {{elements}} of a new conceptual framework for the unification of biogeography and movement ecology, and demonstrate {{the value of the}} new framework using a case study of two species of Afrotropical duck (Anatidae) across a latitudinal gradient. Location: Southern Africa. Methods: The first part of the paper rests on logic and philosophy. For the second (case study) section, we used data from up to 3 years of satellite telemetry for 26 individuals of two species of Afrotropical duck, the Egyptian goose (Alopochen aegyptiaca) and red-billed teal (Anas erythrorhyncha), from three different populations with <b>moulting</b> <b>sites</b> spread across 17 degrees of latitude. We compared quantitative measures of movement patterns using principal components analysis and boxplots. Results: We argue that unpacking the concept of dispersal into the fundamental {{elements of}} movement (internal drivers, external drivers, navigation capacity, and motion capacity) provides a more solid basis for contrasting competing hypotheses in biogeographical studies. We found, surprisingly, that red-billed teal, a 'highly nomadic' species, moved with a relatively high degree of consistency at each of our three study latitudes, while Egyptian geese, a 'resident' species, showed latitude-dependent variation in their movements. However, much of the latitude-related variation for Egyptian geese was driven by their annual moult migrations, rather than directly by fluctuations in resource availability. Internal factors appear to dominate movements and probably determine the species ranges of both of our study species. Main conclusions: The integration of biogeography and movement ecology, through a more sophisticated view of mechanisms formerly lumped together under 'dispersal', offers a fertile area for further research. The biogeography of Afrotropical ducks appears to be strongly influenced by internal factors. Biogeographical patterns in this taxon may thus be best understood (and modelled) as a long-term response to environmental stochasticity, rather than as a deliberate selection of optimal habitat. Latitudinal comparisons emerge as a valuable way of gaining insights into the drivers of movement for widespread species...|$|R
40|$|In 1999, seven dark-bellied brent geese Branta bemicla bemicla were {{followed}} during spring migration from western Europe to Arctic Russia using satellite telemetry. For {{six of the}} birds we were also able to monitor their summer stay at the Taimyr Peninsula, and for five birds part of their autumn migration was recorded. In this article, we report on site use during summer and spring/autumn migration. We also describe migration routes and evaluate general migratory performance during autumn migration. All birds spent the summer within areas covered by the Great Arctic Reserve on the Taimyr Peninsula. None of the birds returned to the wintering area with young, so the sites used during summer were most likely used primarily for moulting. The birds remained at the same sites the whole summer until the start of autumn migration, indicating that the build-up of fuel stores for migration {{took place at the}} <b>moulting</b> <b>sites.</b> Autumn migration was conducted in a similar way as spring migration regarding routes and general migratory performance. Site use showed both a relatively large variation between individuals and seasons, as well as some degree of site fidelity as all birds returned for a longer stay in autumn to {{at least one of the}} areas they had used formore than two days in spring. Thus the migration of brent geese along the Arctic Ocean cannot be considered as a simple migration system with just a few key sites along the route, but instead it is a complex system with several localities used in different ways by different individuals. Most of the areas used by the satellite-tagged birds were previously known stopover areas, but some of them had not been recognized as being of importance to brent geese before. Most of the stopover areas do not have anykind of formal legal protection. It is suggested that further research should be carried out in the areas identified in this study to evaluate their importance and role in the migratory journeys of dark-bellied brent geese...|$|R

F. auricularia {{was found to be}} spread across all of southern Australia with records indicating it probably invaded Australia, in Tasmania, over 170 years ago. The mtDNA analysis of Australian and New Zealand F. auricularia populations indicated only one of the two known European earwig subspecies is found in these regions and that there are two differing clades of this subspecies within Australia but only one in Tasmania and New Zealand. Comparing these results to samples collected throughout Europe indicates that the genetic diversity of the mainland Australian population is only half that of Europe and the diversity in Tasmania and New Zealand is half that again. Possible European sources for only one of the two Australian clades were found. These results indicate that multiple invasion events are likely to have occurred on the Australian mainland, but this seems less probable within Tasmania or New Zealand. The investigation into the intraguild compatibility of earwigs and A. mali in apple orchards was determined by weekly monitoring of arthropod communities (including WAA, earwigs, A. mali) within 5 orchards over two entire apple production seasons. Earwig trap catches were observed to rapidly decline after the imaginal <b>moult</b> at all <b>sites</b> and during both seasons. The thesis shows that trees which possess large earwig trap catches (> 22 earwigs/tree/week) within the first 7 weeks after blossom contain little to no WAA {{at the end of the}} season. Trees that contained fewer earwigs had larger WAA infestations unless the first generation of A. mali numbers exceeded 0. 5 wasps per sticky trap per week. If these beneficial insect targets were not met, extreme WAA infestations occurred, despite other predators being observed feeding on WAA colonies.
