Previous attempts to consider <b>magnification</b> <b>factors</b> for the self-organizing map (SOM) algorithm have been hindered because the mapping is only defined at discrete points (given by the reference vectors). In this paper we consider the batch version of SOM, for which a continuous mapping can be defined, as well as the Generative Topographic Mapping (GTM) algorithm of Bishop et al. [2] which has been introduced as a probabilistic formulation of the SOM. We show how the techniques of differential geometry can be used to determine <b>magnification</b> <b>factors</b> as continuous functions of the latent space coordinates.

40|$|An {{alternating}} method, {{in conjunction}} with the finite element method and a newly developed analytical solution for an elliptical crack in an infinite solid, is used to determine stress intensity factors for semi-elliptical surface flaws in cylindrical pressure vessels. The present finite element alternating method leads to a very inexpensive procedure for routine evaluation of accurate stress intensity factors for flawed pressure vessels. The problems considered in the present paper are: (/) an outer semi-elliptical surface crack in a thick cylinder, and (ii) inner semi-elliptical surface cracks in a thin cylinder which were recommended for analysis by the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code (Section III, App. G, 1977). For each crack geometry of an inner surface crack, seven independent loadings, such as internal pressure loading on the cylinder surface and polynomial pressure loadings from constant to fifth order on the crack surface, are considered. From the analyses of these loadings, the <b>magnification</b> <b>factors</b> for the internal pressure loading and the polynomial influence functions for the polynomial crack surface loadings are determined. By the method of superposition, the <b>magnification</b> <b>factors</b> for in-ternally pressurized cylinders are rederived by using the polynomial influence functions to check {{the internal consistency of the}} present analysis. These values agree excellently with the <b>magnification</b> <b>factors</b> obtained directly. The present results are also compared with the results available in literature. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Recently, we have {{developed}} the hierarchical Generative Topographic Mapping (HGTM), an interactive method for visualization of large high-dimensional real-valued data sets. In this paper, we propose a more general visualization system by extending HGTM in three ways, which allows the user to visualize {{a wider range of}} data sets and better support the model development process. 1) We integrate HGTM with noise models from the exponential family of distributions. The basic building block is the Latent Trait Model (LTM). This enables us to visualize data of inherently discrete nature, e. g., collections of documents, in a hierarchical manner. 2) We give the user a choice of initializing the child plots of the current plot in either interactive, orautomatic mode. In the interactive mode, the user selects “regions of interest, ” whereas in the automatic mode, an unsupervised minimum message length (MML) -inspired construction of a mixture of LTMs is employed. The unsupervised construction is particularly useful when high-level plots are covered with dense clusters of highly overlapping data projections, making it difficult to use the interactive mode. Such a situation often arises when visualizing large data sets. 3) We derive general formulas for <b>magnification</b> <b>factors</b> in latent trait models. <b>Magnification</b> <b>factors</b> are a useful tool to improve our understanding of the visualization plots, since they can highlight the boundaries between data clusters. We illustrate our approach on a toy example and evaluate it on three more complex real data sets.
