Consistent with {{the content and}} format recommended by Regulatory Guide 1. 16, such information has been provided in Items 24 and 25 of the Operating Data Reports for Surry Units 1 and 2. As the NRC has recognized in its clarification of treatment of information on plant outage and restart schedules, outage-related forecast information is now considered confidential business (or proprietary) information. Based {{on the nature of}} this information, a more limited presentation of outage-related forecast information that is not considered proprietary will be provided, rather than request that this information be withheld from public disclosure in accordance with 1 OCFR 2. 790.

40|$|Issue: Wood waste {{processors}} must set {{a tipping}} fee (receiving charge) that allows their {{business to be}} profitable. The tipping fee must cover expenses yet, remain competitive with other local recycling or disposal options. Also, an acceptable profit margin per unit (cubic yard or ton) of incoming material should be considered. Establishing a tipping fee ensures that the facility operates profitably. Best Practice: This Best Practice outlines the process for determining the tipping fee at a new or existing facility. Implementation: The tipping fee is perhaps the only variable of the facility’s financial system. Therefore, calculating the desired tipping fee requires “working backwards. ” The cost to process the wood waste (processing costs) {{is determined by the}} facility’s <b>monthly</b> <b>operating</b> expenses and payment capital expenditures. The tipping fee (per unit basis) is determined by dividing the total tipping revenue by the material tonnage or cubic yards of incoming material. Therefore to determine the tipping fee, the tipping revenue must first be calculated using the following equation: Tipping Revenues = (Processing Costs + Profit Margin) - Material Revenues where: 1. Processing Costs = <b>Monthly</b> <b>Operating</b> Expenses + <b>Monthly</b> Payments on Capital Expenditures. Operating Expenses. These expenses are necessary costs to remain in business and typically include the following: • Labor; • Disposal Costs For Removed Contaminants • Overhead (e. g., benefits...|$|R
50|$|As sawmill work became {{increasingly}} specialized and the labour market increasingly competitive, Aboriginal involvement in that sector declined. Like {{other ethnic groups}} at the time, the Squamish and Tsleil-Waututh shifted focus to specialize in longshoring. For many Aboriginal workers, who collectively held a significant employment repertoire in logging and sawmill work, the transition to longshoring was logical. Familiarity with the physical nature of handling lumber, {{as well as its}} attendant skills, such as knowing how to <b>operate</b> <b>logging</b> and milling equipment, enabled Native workers to become quickly familiarized with the waterfront work environment.|$|R

A computer simulation model, TRUCKSIM, has been developed to assist in these analyses by predicting the effects of both road and alternative vehicle specification on transport performance.

In or around 1880, these railroads allowed the clearcutting of the remaining forests.

The logging railroads used special geared steam locomotives, such as the Shay, Climax and Heisler. Nine companies <b>operated</b> <b>logging</b> railroads in what became Moshannon State Forest; the Goodyear Lumber Company was the largest and cut much of what became Quehanna Wild Area between 1902 and 1912.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{application}} of Implicit Stochastic Optimization (ISO) to determine <b>monthly</b> <b>operating</b> rules for a reservoir system located in the semiarid Northeast of Brazil. ISO employs a deterministic optimization model to find optimal reservoir allocations under several possible inflow scenarios and later constructs the rules by analyzing the ensemble of these optimal releases. The operating policies provide the monthly reservoir release conditioned on the storage {{at the beginning of}} the month and the inflow predicted for the month. In addition to the classical regression analysis, this study establishes the rules by a two-dimensional interpolation strategy. After the rules are identified, they are applied to operate the system under new inflow realizations and show ability to produce policies similar to those obtained by deterministic optimization taking the same inflows as perfect forecasts...|$|R
