40|$|As a 1 st step, {{this study}} aimed at {{investigating}} the microbial quality of liquid egg white in a French eggprocessing company. Thirty raw and 33 pasteurized liquid egg white samples were analyzed. Pasteurization was globally found efficient on mesophilic contaminants (1. 7 ± 1. 6 and 0. 8 ± 0. 9 log CFU/mL in raw and pasteurized samples, respectively), including {{for the control}} of Salmonella. However,Gram-positive enterococci were still detected in the pasteurized samples. As a 2 nd step, a representative bacterial collection was built for exploring the spoilage issue in egg-based <b>chilled</b> <b>desserts.</b> Custard cream was chosen as growth medium since this food is widely used {{for the production of}} French <b>chilled</b> <b>desserts.</b> All of the 166 isolates of the bacterial collection were shown to be able to grow and to induce spoilage of the custard cream at refrigeration temperature (10 °C). Several spoilage types were highlighted in the custard cream, on the basis of changes regarding pH, consistency, production of holes or gas. As a 3 rd step, bacterial enzymatic activities were explored on custard cream-based agar media. The bacterial collection was reduced to 43 isolates, based on further selection regarding the genera and the spoilage types previously highlighted. Albeit to different degrees, all these isolates were able to produce proteases. A large part of these isolates also expressed lipolytic and amylolytic activities. This studyemphasizes the need to control egg white contamination and especially with Gram-positive heat-resistant Enterococi, in order to guarantee the shelf life of egg-based <b>chilled</b> <b>desserts...</b>|$|R

40|$|This PhD thesis aims {{to extend}} the current {{quantitative}} microbial risk assessment for minimally heated chilled foods by including information on variability of non-proteolytic Clostridium botulinum at strain level. The research on strain variability covers practical experiments as well as literature surveys and focuses on heat resistance properties of non-proteolytic C. botulinum spores, variability in growth at chill temperatures and variability in growth and neurotoxin formation {{in the presence of}} different carbohydrates. A strain classification pattern was developed and compared with published literature information on the genetic variation of non-proteolytic C. botulinum. Results for the growth at chill temperatures and from the carbohydrate study provide strong evidence of significant variability for strains of non-proteolytic C. botulinum that is associated with the type of neurotoxin formed. Although a literature review on heat resistance did not show correlation between the decimal reduction time and toxin type for non-proteolytic C. botulinum it provides a strong quantitative support for modelling of the thermal properties of the spores. Insights on strain variability were included in a modular quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA) for a model dairy-based <b>chilled</b> <b>dessert</b> using a Monte Carlo simulation technique. The model considered four steps in product manufacture that either reduced or increased the hazard associated with non-proteolytic C. botulinum: spore load in raw material, thermal inactivation of spores, distribution of spores in retail units and population kinetics for non-proteolytic C. botulinum during multi-stage storage regimes. The replacement of a commonly applied assumption on strain homogeneity with strain specific characteristics of non-proteolytic C. botulinum revealed that inclusion of information on strain variability has an important impact on estimated risks. The QMRA indicated that, for a minimally heated dairy-based dessert, a greater hazard was associated with type E strains than with those of type B and F. The findings in this thesis provide important information relating to food safety and public health and could be used by risk managers for verification of microbiological criteria for particular products originating from geographical locations with higher prevalence of type E non-proteolytic C. botulinum strains. This approach illustrates a step forward by including population details into to risk assessment which may become a significant element in the assessment of complex foodborne hazards...|$|R
40|$|Although {{egg white}} {{is known as}} expressing {{efficient}} antimicrobial properties under physiological conditions, little is known on the microbial quality of industrial egg white. This issue is of great importance when egg white enters into the composition of highly perishable products, such as <b>chilled</b> egg-based <b>desserts.</b> Due to the high thermo-sensitivity of its constitutive proteins, liquid egg white is stabilized at low heat-treating times and temperatures (2 to 6 min at 55 °C to 57 °C in France). The remaining of heat-resisting bacteria may shorten the shelf-life of the desserts, with damaging health and economical consequences. The objective {{of this study was}} to investigate the microbial quality of raw and pasteurized liquid egg white products collected in a French company at two consecutive warm and cold seasons. A total of 63 samples were analyzed, including 30 raw and 33 pasteurized (at 57 °C for 6 min) liquid egg white products. The level and type of bacterial contamination was evaluated by pour-plating in PCA (incubation for 24 h at 30 °C under aerobic conditions) and 16 SrDNA sequencing of the colonies. The average counts were fairly low and a broad range of population was highlighted from one sample to another, namely 1. 7 ± 1. 6 log CFU/m...|$|R
5000|$|New flavors were {{continually}} {{added and}} unsuccessful flavors were removed: in the 1950s and 1960s, apple, black cherry, black raspberry, grape, lemon-lime, mixed fruit, orange-banana, pineapple-grapefruit, blackberry, strawberry-banana, tropical fruit and more intense [...] "wild" [...] {{versions of the}} venerable strawberry, raspberry and cherry. In 1966, the Jell-O [...] "No-Bake" [...] dessert line was launched, which allowed a cheesecake {{to be made in}} 15 minutes. In 1969, Jell-O 1∗2∗3 (later Jell-O 1•2•3), a gelatin dessert that separated into three layers as it cooled, was unveiled. Until 1987, Jell-O 1•2•3 was readily found in grocery stores throughout most of the United States, but the dessert is now rare. In 1971 packaged prepared pudding called Jell-O Pudding Treats were introduced. Jell-O Whip 'n <b>Chill,</b> a mousse-style <b>dessert,</b> was introduced and widely promoted; it remains available in limited areas today.|$|R
40|$|The {{consumption}} of <b>chilled</b> dairy <b>desserts</b> is increasing in the European Union. The famous French “île flottante”, consisting in a foam of egg white floating on a custard cream, represents a highly nutritive medium for bacterial growth {{and for the}} expression of enzymes susceptible to affect the food shelf-life at chilled temperatures. To avoid such issues, the suppliers may either adjust the processes of heat-treatment -but this means of control is limited due to the high heat-sensitivity of egg proteins- or incorporate food additives. However, there is an increasing consumer demand for natural products without preservatives. The present study aims at better controlling the spoilage events by fully characterising the bacterial biodiversity and spoilage potential during cold storage. Sixty-five spoiled desserts delivered by two companies were analysed for their (i) sensorial characteristics and (ii) bacterial counts and 16 S rDNA sequencing. Five hundred sixty-six isolates were further studied through an in vivo (in pure custard cream) spoilage test at 10 °C. An in vitro (in a custard cream-based medium) test allowed assaying the expression of proteases (10 °C) and growth (6 °C). The expression of lipases was assayed on PCA tributyrin agar (10 °C). The spoilage mainly concerned the custard cream part of the dessert, exhibiting high bacterial counts (> 6 log UFC/mL), pH decrease, thickening, coagulation and appearance of off-odours. Eighty bacterial genera were identified, mainly corresponding to Gram positive bacteria. The contamination by the Bacillus cereus group concerned 80 % of the spoiled desserts. Fifty-seven and 8 % of the recovered isolates expressed proteolytic and lipolytic activities at 10 °C. Thirty four percents was able to grow at 6 °C in the in vitro test. A statistical analysis of the whole data highlighted various correlations between the type of bacterium, its growth and enzymatic potentials at low temperature, and the spoilage characteristics of the dessert...|$|R
40|$|Egg white {{antimicrobial}} {{activities are}} widely investigated regarding {{the resistance of}} Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis. This resistance is considered as one on the main factors explaining the high prevalence of this serovar in egg-product-related food-borne disease. The behavior of Gram-positive bacteria has been poorly investigated in egg white whereas it can provide additional insight into the bacterial response to this iron-deprived harsh medium. Investigating the behavior of Gam-positive bacteria in egg white may then provide {{new insights into the}} mechanisms of bacterial pathogenesis and adaptation in the hos t iron-deprived environment. Bacillus cereus is a Gram-positive spore-forming opportunistic human bac terium frequently associated with foodborne infections due to the production of diarrheal and e metic toxins. Psychrotrophic B. cereus group strains are recognized as being involved in spoilage events of chilled pasteurized liquid whole egg products due to their ability to secrete hydrolytic enzymes, even at low temperature. Their behavior in an egg product such as egg white warranted furth er consideration since this ingredient is widely used in the production of food particularly sensiti ve from a microbiological perspective, such a <b>chilled</b> lightly cooked <b>desserts</b> comprising egg white foams (chocolate mousse, floating island, etc.). These facts led us to investigate the behavior of B. cereus group bacteria in egg white. Our results highlighted a strong bactericidal effect at permissive temperature (30 °C) and under the natural alkaline (natural pH of 9. 3 a few days after laying) and iron-deprived conditions of egg white. This bactericidal effect could be ascribed to a well-kno wn egg white protein, ovotransferrin, which to date had exclusively been described as responsible for bacteriostasis due to iron chelation. The addition of iron reversed this bactericidal effect only under neutral incubation conditions. A perturbation of the electrochemical potential of the cytoplasmic membrane suggested that an ovotransferrin-mediated membrane disturbance mechanism could be involved in bacterial death in egg white...|$|R
