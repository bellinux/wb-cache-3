40|$|Soil-related {{obstacles}} {{resulting from}} continuous monoculture have limited the sustainable {{development of the}} tomato industry in China. An experiment on tomatoes with seven continuous monoculture treatments (the 1 st, 3 rd, 5 th, 7 th, 9 th, 11 th, and 13 th crops, respectively) was conducted in a solar greenhouse, to investigate the influence of monoculture on soil quality. Most soil quality indicators first increased and then decreased with increasing continuous monoculture crops, and significant differences among crops were observed. Indicators at the 13 th crop were significantly lower than those at the other crops in terms of average well color development (AWCD), substrate richness (S), the Shannon diversity index (H), and the <b>McIntosh</b> <b>index</b> (U) of the soil microbial community (SMC), soil urease (UR), and neutral phosphatase (N-PHO) activities, and available nitrogen (AN) and potassium (AK). However, fungal abundance (FUN) at the 13 th crop {{was significantly higher than}} that at the other crops. As principal component analysis (PCA) revealed, SMC functional diversity at the 1 st, 11 th, and 13 th crops were similar, and were obviously distinguished from those at the other crops. Moreover, the tomato yield was significantly and positively correlated with soil-available potassium and SMC functional diversity indexes. Our findings indicated that short-term continuous monoculture, e. g., for fewer than seven or nine crops, was beneficial for soil quality improvement. However, continuous monoculture for greater than 11 crops had adverse effects on soil enzyme activities, soil microbial abundances, soil chemical properties, soil SMC functional diversity, and the tomato yield, particularly at the 13 th crop...|$|E
40|$|Antibiotics in soil can {{interfere}} with the structure and function of the soil microbial community and represent a potential genetic pollution risk. The effects of different concentrations and application frequencies of oxytetracycline (OTC) to an agricultural soil on the activities of soil microorganisms and enzymes were investigated during incubation of 120 days. Single once-only high application treatments (1, 3. 6, 10, and 30 mg OTC kg(- 1) soil) and one daily low application treatment (0. 03 mg OTC kg(- 1) soil every day) were compared to simulate OTC application to the soil in sewage sludges or manures or from waste water irrigation. In the single addition treatments, microbial biomass carbon (C-mic) in the soil increased 2. 17 - 3. 29 times and 1. 37 - 2. 08 times after 7 and 42 d of incubation, respectively, but nitrification potential increased sharply to 3. 01 - 10. 9 times after 28 d and dehydrogenase activity was also significantly stimulated after 14 d compared to the zero OTC control and decreased sharply by 120 d. The daily OTC addition treatments promoted C-mic (up to 2. 64 times) and increased the <b>McIntosh</b> <b>index</b> (p < 0. 05) between 60 and 90 days as calculated using Biolog data and compared to the zero OTC control. A single high rate of OTC addition showed a generally more pronounced negative effect on soil microbial community metabolism (but not on functional diversity indices of the soil microbial community) than repeated small rates of addition because with equal amounts of added OTC (single 3. 6 mg kg(- 1) and daily 0. 03 mg kg(- 1), OTC) C-mic, nitrification potential and neutral phosphatase activity at 120 d were significantly lower in the single application treatments.

40|$|Plant growth-promoting yeasts {{are often}} over looked as a {{mechanism}} to improve phytoremediation of heavy metals. In this study, Cryptococcus sp. NSE 1, a Cd-tolerant yeast with plant growth capabilities, was isolated from the rhizosphere of the heavy metal hyperaccumulator Sedum plumbizincicola. The yeast exhibited strong tolerance {{to a range of}} heavy metals including Cd, Cu, and Zn on plate assays. The adsorption rate Cd, Cu, Zn by NSE 1 was 26. 1, 13. 2, and 25. 2 %, respectively. Irregular spines were formed on the surface of NSE 1 when grown in MSM medium supplemented with 200 mg L- 1 Cd. NSE 1 was capable of utilizing 1 -aminocyclopropane- 1 -carboxylate (ACC) as a sole nitrogen source and was capable of solubilization of inorganic phosphate at rates of 195. 2 mg L- 1. Field experiments demonstrated that NSE 1 increased phytoremediation by increasing the biomass of Cd hyperaccumulator S. plumbizincicola (46 %, p < 0. 05) during phytoremediation. Overall, Cd accumulation by S. plumbizincicola was increased from 19. 6 to 31. 1 mg m(- 2) though no difference in the concentration of Cd in the shoot biomass was observed between NSE 1 and control. A Cd accumulation ratio of 38. 0 % for NSE 1 and 17. 2 % for control was observed. The HCl-extractable Cd and CaCl 2 -extractable Cd concentration in the soil of the NSE 1 treatment were reduced by 39. 2 and 29. 5 %, respectively. Community-level physiology profiling, assessed using Biolog Eco plates, indicated functional changes to the rhizosphere community inoculated with NSE 1 by average well color development (AWCD) and measurement of richness (diversity). Values of Shannon-Weiner index, Simpson index, and <b>McIntosh</b> <b>index</b> showed a slight but no significant increases. These results indicate that inoculation of NSE 1 could increase the shoot biomass of S. plumbizincicola, enhance the Cd accumulation in S. plumbizincicola, and decrease the available heavy metal content in soils significantly without overall significant changes to the microbial community...|$|E
40|$|The main {{objectives}} {{of this study}} was to determine and compare the density and diversity of water birds and terrestrial birds using distance sampling point count method at Paya Indah Wetland Reserve, Selangor Peninsular Malaysia. A total of 13872 bird individuals from 100 bird species were recorded in the wetland reserve. Out of the total, 25 (22. 26 % of all detections) and 75 (77. 74 % of all detections) bird species belong to water birds and terrestrial birds respectively. The results showed that total bird density of the wetland reserve is 83. 92 ± 4. 53 birds ha - 1 and ranged from 75. 40 - 93. 41 birds ha - 1 (95 % confidence interval). The terrestrial birds have higher density (70. 26 ± 4. 48 birds ha - 1) as compared to water birds (13. 09 ± 1. 78 birds ha - 1). The highest water bird density was recorded for Purple Swamphen (5. 05 ± 0. 89 birds ha - 1) and the lowest was Ballion's Crake (0. 31 ± 0. 13 birds ha - 1). The highest terrestrial bird density was recorded for Yellow-vented Bulbul (12. 97 ± 1. 05 birds ha - 1) and the lowest was Ashy Minivet (0. 31 ± 0. 18 birds ha - 1). The highest species diversity i. e. Shannon’s index (N 1 = 20. 83), species richness i. e. Margalef’s index (R 1 = 7. 97) and species evenness, i. e., <b>McIntosh’s</b> <b>index</b> (E = 0. 73) was recorded in terrestrial birds. This study indicated that Paya Indah Wetland Reserve is a highly important habitat and provides diverse food, shelter, nesting and roosting sites for water birds as well as terrestrial birds...|$|R
40|$|Taoyuan, Yunnan Province is {{a special}} eco-site which keeps the highest yield records of rice {{cultivation}} in small planting areas. Soil microbial species and functional diversity were evaluated using cultivation method and BIOLOG ecoplates. The {{results showed that the}} microbial community of the high yield region was more abundant, and the total microbial population was 2 times of the control, furthermore, the areas belonged to the healthy "bacteria" soil, which was showed as bacteria > actinomycetes > fungi. Bacteria were the dominant populations in the rhizosphere of high yielding rice field, and the yield formation of rice was not correlated with the depth of soil layers. In order to obtain more species diversity information, Shannon diversity index H, Shannon evenness index E and Simpson index D were analyzed, and the results showed that microbial community diversity and evenness were not the main differences between the high and general yield areas. Then, the functional diversity of soil microbial community was investigated through the average well color development(AWCD) and diversity index analyses. The results of AWCD analysis indicated that the metabolic activity of soil microbial community in high yield paddy soils were stronger than the control. Moreover, the difference range from large to small showed as tillering stage > harvest period > seedling period > rotation period, the stronger the rice growth, the greater the difference between the high yield region and the control. At tillering stage and harvest stage, due to the vigorous plant growth, the root exudates were rich, and the microbial communities of high yield paddy soils showed a strong metabolic activity and strong ability to use carbon sources. The results of Shannon, Simpson and <b>McIntosh</b> <b>indices</b> analysis indicated that common microbial species was not a key factor affecting the yield of rice. Tillering stage was a key period for the growth of high yield rice, and many characteristics of this period were the important reasons for high yield formation of rice...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Plant Diversity {{conservation}} is a main objective in rangeland management. Plant diversity is a suitable index for showing the changes of vegetation in rangelands {{and has a}} high correlation with ecosystem parameters. Therefore, using this index {{it is possible to}} find the changes and manage the ecosystem correctly. The current research was performed to determine the species diversity in Fashandak rangelands of Taleghan. To do this, 110 plots each one with an area of 1 m 2 were established based on randomized-systematic method and density of the species within each plot was recorded. Species properties including the related genus and family in addition to life form, growth form and biological type were determined. Shannon, Simpson and <b>McIntosh</b> diversity <b>indexes</b> were used. Results showed that diversity of Fashandak rangelands could be considered as moderate. The highest distribution frequency was related to the species of Bromus tomentellus, Hypericum perforatum and Thymus kotschyanus...|$|R
40|$|Background, aim, {{and scope}} Bamboo (Phyllostachy pubescens Mazel ex Lehaie), a unique fast-growing tree species, is an {{important}} forest resource in southern China. Because of its high economic value and short rotation period, intensive management practices such as fertilization, weeding, and deep tilling are extensively utilized. These practices significantly increase the production of mature timber and young shoots. In this paper, bamboo stands under intensive management with short-term (STIP) and long-term (LTIP) practices were compared with those managed conventionally (CON) to {{study the effects of}} intensive management practices on soil biological properties. Materials and methods We measured the soil microbial biomass carbon (MBC), basal respiration carbon (BRC), and the specific ability of soil microbiota to consume a range of carbon (C) substrates, measured by Biolog ECO MicroPlate. Results Intensive management practice significantly decreased (P? STIP > LTIP), but increased soil BRC (in the order of STIP 蠌TIP > CON). Under intensive management practices, soil microbial activity, and diversity of C sources utilized by microbial communities decreased (P?<? 0. 05), as characterized by average well color development (AWCD). Shannon and <b>McIntosh</b> <b>indexes</b> tended to decline with intensive management practices. Intensive management practice also caused much lower (P?<? 0. 05) utilization of 2 -hydroxy benzoic acid and a-cyclodextrin. Discussion Soil biological properties were proved to be sensitive indicators of soil quality in response to the intensive management practices, with decreases in soil MBC, microbial activity, and diversity of C sources utilized by microbial communities under the continuing intensive management practices in bamboo stands. This indicates that the intensive management practices had resulted in the negative effect on the soil microbial activities. Conclusions Intensive management practices generally had a negative influence on the soil biological properties. This would have important implications for the sustainable management of bamboo production systems in southern China. Recommendations and perspectives To minimize the detrimental effect on soil microbial communities, an improved intensive management practice with reducing amounts of mineral fertilizer and increasing organic fertilizer applications are recommended annually so that both high bamboo yield and soil quality can be sustained over a long period.

40|$|The {{present study}} is aimed at {{assessing}} the herbaceous plant diversity and determining the specific species related to different management systems in olive grove ecosystems [organic, conventional (unsprayed), and conventional (sprayed) ] in two sites (Nies and Pteleos) of Magnesia Prefecture (central Greece). The sampling of herbaceous vegetation {{was carried out in}} randomly selected plots of 0. 25 m(2) (0. 5 mx 0. 5 m) each. The results showed that the organic system in Pteleos favored plant species richness and Shannon-Weiner, Simpson, Margalef, Brilluin, <b>McIntosh,</b> and Menhinick <b>indexes</b> more than the other management systems (P < 0. 05). A Renyi diagram revealed the greatest plant diversity in the organic system in Pteleos site. According to cluster analysis results, the organic and the conventional (unsprayed) olive groves in Pteleos exhibited a strong similarity regarding plant diversity. The same was detected in the pairs: Nies conventional (unsprayed) and Nies organic, and in Nies conventional (sprayed) and Pteleos conventional (sprayed). IndVal analysis revealed three characteristic types of indices, Chenopodium album in the organic olive groves in Pteleos, Sinapis arvensis in the organic ones in Nies, and Aegilops geniculata in the conventional (unsprayed) olive groves in Nies...|$|R
