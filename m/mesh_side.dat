40|$|PURPOSE: To {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} polypropylene mesh, implanted by inguinotomy, in the spermatic funiculus, epididium and testis of dogs. METHODS: Eighteen dogs were considered (12 - 23 Kg), separated in three groups. Group A (n= 7) : left side (with mesh) versus right side (without mesh); Group B (n= 7) : left side (without mesh) versus right side (with mesh) and Group C (n= 4) : without any surgical manipulation (control group). After being observed for 60 days, the animals were subjected to bilateral removal of the spermatic funiculus, epididium and testis that were submitted to histological analysis. During the re-operation, a macroscopic evaluation was performed. RESULTS: On the <b>mesh</b> <b>side,</b> we noted 100 % of mesh adherence to the posterior wall of the inguinal canal, {{as well as the}} adherence of the spermatic funiculus to the mesh. A congestion of the pampiniform plexus was noted in three animals. Chronic inflammation reaction and foreign body reaction in the spermatic funiculus was observed in 100 % of the animals. On the side that did not carry a mesh, chronic inflammatory reaction was observed in 71 % of the animals. All the animals presented chronic inflammatory reaction in the deferent duct in the <b>mesh</b> <b>side</b> and in eleven animals in the side without the mesh. These alterations were not found in Group C. There was a considerable statistical reduction in the average difference of the diameter of the lumen of the deferent duct in the <b>mesh</b> <b>side.</b> In the epididium and testis, macro and microscopic alterations were not significant, although one animal presented a marked reduction of spermatogenesis on the <b>mesh</b> <b>side.</b> CONCLUSION: The polypropylene mesh, when in contact with the spermatic funiculus of dogs, causes a more intense chronic inflammatory reaction and a significant reduction in the diameter of the lumen of the deferent duct...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Three-dimensional {{finite element}} method (FEM) is widely used as an {{effective}} numerical simulation technique to solve the complex engineering problem. In the FEM simulation technique at first it needs to discrete the problem.

Though in extensive commercial software have an excellent automatic mesh generating system, however the problem of hexahedral automatic mesh generation and its adaptation are not enough to solve for practical applications, because for the mesh generation of complex shape is very difficult and still intensive labor work by hand. In this paper we present a new method to generate an appropriate mesh using existing regular hexahedral mesh and hexahedron mesh generation technique.

40|$|Abstract. Three-dimensional {{finite element}} method (FEM) is widely used as an {{effective}} numerical simulation technique to solve the complex engineering problem. Usually, the more complex engineering problem has more complex structure and shape; the FEM simulation technique is that needs to discrete the structure {{and shape of the}} problem by mesh. In addition, the correct generation of mesh {{is one of the most}} significant issues that directly affect to the accuracy of the FEM simulation. The hexahedral mesh is better than tetrahedral mesh in solving the complex engineering problem. The common methods of hexahedral automatic mesh generation have been used in some commercial soft already, but its adaptation is not enough to solve for practical applications of the complex engineering problems. A new method of mesh generation technique was proposed by improved waveform mesh generating method, and realized by C++ developing program in Linux OS. The method could generate some effective and smoothly mesh models by quadrilateral element or hexahedron element, and not only generated revolution curve surface meshes, but also generated random meshes according to free functions too. The results shown that the hexahedral mesh models of the complex shapes were generated as the shape function apply to regular <b>mesh</b> <b>side</b> as a waveform constraint...|$|E
40|$|Knowledge of soil seed banks is {{essential}} to understand the dynamics of plant populations and communities and would greatly benefit from the integration of existing knowledge on ecological correlates of seed size and shape. This paper aims to establish a feasible and meaningful method to describe size-number distributions of seeds in multi-species situations. For that purpose, size-number distributions of seeds with known length, width and thickness were determined by sequential sieving. The most appropriate combination of sieves and seeds dimensions was established, and {{the adequacy of the}} power function and the Weibull model to describe size-number distributions of spherical, non-spherical, and all seeds was investigated. We found that the geometric mean of seed length, width and thickness was the most adequate size estimator, providing shape-independent measures of seeds volume directly related to sieves <b>mesh</b> <b>side,</b> and that both the power function and the Weibull model provide high quality descriptions of size-number distributions of spherical, non-spherical, and all seeds. We also found that, in spite of its slightly lower accuracy, the power function is, at this stage, a more trustworthy model to characterize size-number distributions of seeds in soils banks because in some Weibull equations the estimates of the scale parameter were not acceptable...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to learn more about the effect of seeding and loading techniques on the osteogenic differentiation in vitro of rat bone marrow cells into titanium fiber mesh. This material was used as received or subjected to glow discharge treatment (RFGD). The seeding methods that were used included a so-called droplet, cell suspension (high and low cell density), and rotating plate method. Osteogenic cells were cultured for 4, 8, and 16 days into titanium fiber mesh. DNA, osteocalcin, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis, and calcium measurements were used to determine cellular proliferation and differentiation. DNA analysis of the differently seeded specimens showed that proliferation proceeded faster in the first versus second run for droplet and cell suspension samples. No clear and distinct additional effect was found when RFGD treatment was used. Statistical analyses revealed that high cell density and low rotational speed resulted always in a significantly higher DNA content. Calcium measurements and osteocalcin analysis showed that using high cell densities during inoculation of the scaffolds prevented the occurrence of differences between experimental runs. SEM examination showed that for droplet and cell suspension samples cells were present at only one side of the mesh. The <b>mesh</b> <b>side</b> where the cell sheet was observed depended on the additional use of glow discharge treatment. On these materials, the cells had penetrated through the meshes and formed a cell sheet at the bottom side. When rotation was used, no cell sheet was formed and cells had invaded the meshes and were growing around the titanium fibers. On the basis of our results, we conclude that (1). titanium fiber mesh is indeed suitable to support the osteogenic expression of bone marrow cells, and (2). changing the initial cell density as well as the use of dynamic seeding methods can influence the osteogenic capacity of the scaffold...|$|E
40|$|VEGGIE {{is a small}} plant {{production}} chamber built by ORBITEC. This chamber can be collapsed for easy stowage and deployed in orbit. It is designed for gravity independent operation, and provides 0. 17 square m of crop growth area with three primary subsystems: an LED light panel, extendable transparent Teflon bellows to enclose the plants, and a wicking reservoir. VEGGIE would provide the capability for astronauts to grow fresh foods for dietary supplementation. Initial planting concepts tested with the VEGGIE included direct seeding or plug placement on the reservoir surface. These options had issues of salt accumulation and eventual toxicity if the reservoir was filled with nutrient solution, and hardware reuse was limited due to sanitation. In response a rooting packet or "pillow" concept was developed: single-use bags of media containing time release fertilizer with a wicking surface contacting the VEGGIE reservoir. Pillows being tested are small electrostatic bags with a Nitex nylon <b>mesh</b> <b>side,</b> each holding 100 mL of dry media. Six pillows fit in one VEGGIE unit; however pillow size could vary depending on crop selected. Seeds can be planted directly in pillows and planted pillows can be hydrated in space as desired. Our goals were to define optimal media and crops for an ISS mission scenario. Plant tests in pillows were performed in a controlled environment chamber set to habitat-relevant conditions, and capillary reservoir analogs were utilized. Media tested within pillows included: a commercial peat-based potting mix, arcillite (calcined clay), perlite: vermiculite, and peat-based: arcillite blends. Testing included 15 types of leafy greens, snow pea, radish, and herbs. Media performance was crop dependent, but generally plants showed the greatest growth in the peat-based: arcillite mixes. Crops with the best performance in pillows were identified, and testing is underway with select leafy greens examining plant and microbial load response to repeated harvest. We plan to use findings from previous flight testing with media to evaluate the effects of capillary flow from the reservoir to pillows in microgravity...|$|E

Although fly catches among traps varied per site, overall, the Haviland trap caught the most D. suzukii, followed by the red, Van Steenwyk, and clear trap. The modified Haviland and commercial trap had low captures. Among five crop types in Oregon, a clear cup with <b>mesh</b> <b>sides</b> (Dreves) also was tested and caught the most flies. Traps with greater entry areas, found in mesh traps, caught more flies than traps with smaller entry areas. In terms of sensitivity and selectivity, traps that caught more flies likewise caught flies earlier, and all traps caught 26 - 31 % D. suzukii out of the total Drosophila captured.
