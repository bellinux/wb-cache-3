There is a relationship between the quality of boiled water with the presence of bacteria E. coli in <b>fruits</b> <b>juice</b> (p= 0, 001), there is a relationship between the quality of water wash to the presence of bacteria E. coli in <b>fruits</b> <b>juice</b> (p= 0, 005), there is no relationship between handler hygiene with the presence of bacteria E. coli in <b>fruits</b> <b>juice</b> (p= 0, 848), there is no relationship water sanitation with the presence of bacteria E. coli in <b>fruits</b> <b>juice</b> (p= 1, 000), there is no relationship between sanitary equipment with the presence of bacteria E. coli in <b>fruits</b> <b>juice</b> (p= 0, 561), there is no relationship between trash conditions with the presence of bacteria E. coli in <b>fruits</b> <b>juice</b> (p= 0, 543). From this study it could be concluded that the quality of boiled water and washing water are risk factors Escherichia coli bacteria contamination on <b>fruit</b> <b>juice</b> in Tembalang area...|$|R
30|$|This {{suggests}} that intermediate ripe <b>mango</b> <b>fruits</b> were much richer in starch/maltodextrin compared to fully ripe <b>mango</b> <b>fruits</b> (Kansci et al. 2003). Conversely, glucose concentrations were higher for fully ripe <b>mango</b> <b>fruits</b> {{for all the}} cultivars (Fig.  6), ranging from high of 3.30  ±  1.32 / 100  g Kent cultivar to low of 2.86  ±  1.30 / 100  g for Apple cultivars (Table  4). As the ripening continues, the level of glucose concentrations showed a significant (p ≤  0.00) increase from green maturity/intermediate maturity to fully ripe stage for fruits of Apple, Tommy Atkins, Ngowe, and Kent (p ≤  0.02) (Fig.  6).|$|R
40|$|This is {{the first}} study {{to be carried out}} which {{describes}} changes in biochemical profile of both pre- and post-climacteric Sri Lankan <b>mango</b> <b>fruits.</b> Chemometric analysis revealed that spatial distribution of biochemical compounds between peel and pulp was the major discriminatory factor during maturation; whereas fully mature <b>mango</b> <b>fruit</b> contained the highest concentration of starch and lowest concentration of acids. Since these combined variables also responsible for the final quality of ripe fruit, they could be used as important parameters of horticultural maturity to inform growers to harvest Sri Lankan <b>mango</b> <b>fruit</b> at the optimum stage.
