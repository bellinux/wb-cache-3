5|$|Jupiter is a {{powerful}} source of radio waves in the spectral region stretching from several kilohertz to tens of <b>megahertz.</b> Radio waves with frequencies of less than about 0.3MHz (and thus wavelengths longer than 1km) are called the Jovian kilometric radiation or KOM. Those with frequencies in the interval of 0.3–3MHz (with wavelengths of 100–1000m) are called the hectometric radiation or HOM, while emissions in the range 3–40MHz (with wavelengths of 10–100m) {{are referred to as}} the decametric radiation or DAM. The latter radiation was the first to be observed from Earth, and its approximately 10-hour periodicity helped to identify it as originating from Jupiter. The strongest part of decametric emission, which is related to Io and to the Io–Jupiter current system, is called Io-DAM.|$|E
5|$|After {{retiring}} to stud full-time, {{he had a}} {{very successful}} career. He became the first All American Futurity winner to sire another winner when his daughter Easy Date won the All American Futurity in 1974. Easy Date was later named 1975 World Champion Quarter Running Horse. He also sired Pie In the Sky, the 1979 All American Futurity winner, and Mr Trucka Jet, the 1985 All American Futurity winner. More than 1,500 of his offspring earned their AQHA Race Register of Merit, and nine became World Champion Quarter Running Horses. Besides the horses already mentioned, the champions include My Easy Credit, Extra Easy, Easily Smashed, Easy Angel, Easy Move, and <b>Megahertz.</b> His foal Sunset Gallant Jet was the 1979 and 1980 AQHA High Point Cutting & Chariot Racing Co-Champion. At various points in time, Easy Jet has led the AQHA's lists of All-time leading sires of sires, All-time leading sires of Register of Merit qualifiers, All-time leading sires of stakes winners, and All-time leading broodmare sires. In March 2008, he still led the list of All-time leading sires of Quarter Horse racehorses by winners, and on the corresponding list ordered by earnings, he ranks fourth. As a broodmare sire, or maternal grandsire, of racehorses, Easy Jet led the All-time leading lists by winners in March 2008, and the same list ordered by earnings had him second. As of 2008, his offspring had earned over $26,000,000 on the racetrack. In total, he sired 2,507foals in 25years of breeding.|$|E
5|$|The {{date was}} changed {{once more to}} August 3, before it was finally {{released}} in stores on August 24, 1995, {{the same day as}} the Microsoft's operating system Windows 95 version. Phantasmagoria came out first for Windows 95, Windows 3.1 and MS-DOS, then for Macintosh computers in November 1995. A hint book by Sierra came out {{at the same time as}} the game. Phantasmagoria was also ported to Sega Saturn and spanned eight discs exclusively in Japan, where it was fully translated and dubbed into Japanese, and released by Outrigger under the name Phantasm. In response to all the delays, Vince Broady, executive editor of the monthly publication Multimedia World, said Sierra may have been attempting to avoid the same mistakes from the previous year with Outpost, for which the company released many advertisements and reviews, but then over-promoted and released before it was finished. Sierra spokeswoman Kathy Gillmore admitted that mistakes were made in marketing Outpost and Sierra had tried to fix them. The minimum system requirements were an IBM compatible 486–25, 8 megabytes of RAM, 5 megabytes hard disk space, SVGA (256 colors) and a 2x CD-ROM. It supported Sound Blaster-compatible sound cards, and for MS-DOS the game worked with a <b>megahertz</b> chip. It sold for as much as $80 in some stores, but was typically sold for $69.95.|$|E
25|$|Video digital-to-analog {{converters}} {{operate in}} the <b>megahertz</b> range (from ~3MHz for low quality composite video scalers in early games consoles, to 250MHz or more for the highest-resolution VGA output).|$|E
25|$|Dish {{chose to}} settle. The {{terms of the}} {{settlement}} required Dish to pay $700 million for spectrum licenses covering 500 <b>megahertz</b> and capable of serving 150 million people.|$|E
25|$|The {{frequencies}} of sonars range from infrasonic to above a <b>megahertz.</b> Generally, the lower frequencies have longer range, while the higher {{frequencies of}}fer better resolution, and smaller size {{for a given}} directionality.|$|E
25|$|Laser illumination, however, also {{converts}} some N-V− into N-V0 centers. Emission is {{very quick}} (relaxation time ~10 ns). At room temperature, no sharp peaks are observed {{because of the}} thermal broadening. However, cooling the N-V− centers with liquid nitrogen or liquid helium dramatically narrows the lines down to a width of a few <b>megahertz.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Pilot ACE has binary floating-point arithmetic, and {{it became}} {{operational}} in 1950 at National Physical Laboratory, UK. Thirty-three were later sold commercially as the English Electric DEUCE. The arithmetic is actually implemented in software, but with a one <b>megahertz</b> clock rate, the speed of floating-point and fixed-point operations in this machine were initially faster than those of many competing computers.|$|E
25|$|Finite bandwidth: All {{amplifiers}} have finite bandwidth. To a first approximation, the op-amp has {{the frequency}} response of an integrator with gain. That is, the gain {{of a typical}} op-amp is inversely proportional to frequency and is characterized by its gain–bandwidth product(GBWP). For example, an op-amp with a GBWP of 1MHz would have a gain of 5 at 200kHz, and a gain of 1 at 1MHz. This dynamic response coupled with the very high DC gain of the op-amp gives it {{the characteristics of a}} first-order low-pass filter with very high DC gain and low cutoff frequency given by the GBWP divided by the DC gain.The finite bandwidth of an op-amp can be the source of several problems, including:Typical low-cost, general-purpose op-amps exhibit a GBWP of a few <b>megahertz.</b> Specialty and high-speed op-amps exist that can achieve a GBWP of hundreds of <b>megahertz.</b> For very high-frequency circuits, a current-feedback operational amplifier is often used.|$|E
25|$|Although QCA solves {{most of the}} {{limitations}} of CMOS technology, it also brings its own. Research suggests that intrinsic switching time of a QCA cell is at best in the order of terahertz. However, the actual speed may be much lower, in the order of <b>megahertz</b> for solid state QCA and gigahertz for molecular QCA, due to the proper quasi-adiabatic clock switching frequency setting.|$|E
25|$|They {{dispensed}} with split-ring-resonators and instead used {{a network of}} L–C loaded transmission lines. In the metamaterial literature this became known as artificial transmission-line media. At that time it had the added advantage of being more compact than a unit made of wires and split ring resonators. The network was both scalable (from the <b>megahertz</b> to the tens of gigahertz range) and tunable. It also includes a method for focusing the wavelengths of interest.|$|E
25|$|One {{can think}} of MEMS {{resonators}} as small bells that ring at high frequencies. Small bells ring at higher frequencies than large bells, and since MEMS resonators are small they can ring at high frequencies. Common bells are meters down to centimeters across and ring at hundreds of hertz to kilohertz; MEMS resonators are {{a tenth of a}} millimeter across and ring at tens of kilohertz to hundreds of <b>megahertz.</b> MEMS resonators have operated at over a gigahertz.|$|E
25|$|Alternating {{current is}} used to {{transmit}} information, as {{in the cases of}} telephone and cable television. Information signals are carried over a wide range of AC frequencies. POTS telephone signals have a frequency of about 3 kHz, close to the baseband audio frequency. Cable television and other cable-transmitted information currents may alternate at frequencies of tens to thousands of <b>megahertz.</b> These frequencies are similar to the electromagnetic wave frequencies often used to transmit the same types of information over the air.|$|E
25|$|In August 2009, the {{government}} of Belize nationalized Belize Telemedia Limited (BTL), which now competes directly with Speednet. As {{a result of the}} nationalisation process, the interconnection agreements are again subject to negotiations. Both BTL and Speednet boast a full range of products and services including basic telephone services, national and international calls, prepaid services, cellular services via GSM 1900 <b>megahertz</b> (MHz) and 3G CDMA 2000 respectively, international cellular roaming, fixed wireless, dial-up and internet, high-speed DSL, internet service, and national and international data networks.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} ski resorts have adopted RFID tags to provide skiers {{hands-free}} access to ski lifts. Skiers {{do not have}} to take their passes out of their pockets. Ski jackets have a left pocket into which the chip+card fits. This nearly contacts the sensor unit on the left of the turnstile as the skier pushes through to the lift. These systems were based on high frequency (HF) at 13.56 <b>megahertz.</b> The bulk of ski areas in Europe, from Verbier to Chamonix use these systems.|$|E
25|$|Future rollouts under Rubinstein's {{management}} {{included all}} subsequent upgrades (the G4 and G5) of the Power Mac series. While they were technically powerful computers, the Power Mac series {{suffered from the}} perception that they were slower than their Intel-based counterparts because their PowerPC CPUs listed slower clock speeds. Rubinstein and Apple popularised a term known as the <b>Megahertz</b> myth, to describe how the PowerPC architecture could not {{be compared to the}} Intel architecture simply on their clock speeds (the PowerPC CPUs, despite their lower clock speeds, were generally comparable to Intel CPUs of the era).|$|E
25|$|The {{result is}} a {{frequency}} compensated probe for modest frequencies that presents a load of about 10megohms shunted by 12pF. Although such a probe is an improvement, {{it does not work}} when the time scale shrinks to several cable transit times (transit time is typically 5ns). In that time frame, the cable looks like its characteristic impedance, and there will be reflections from the transmission line mismatch at the scope input and the probe that causes ringing. The modern scope probe uses lossy low capacitance transmission lines and sophisticated frequency shaping networks to make the 10X probe perform well at several hundred <b>megahertz.</b> Consequently, there are other adjustments for completing the compensation.|$|E
25|$|Supercomputing: DRDO's ANURAG {{developed}} the PACE+ Supercomputer for strategic purposes for supporting its various programmes. The initial version, as detailed in 1995, had the following specifications: The system delivered a sustained performance {{of more than}} 960 Mflops (million floating operations per second) for computational fluid dynamics programmes. Pace-Plus included 32 advanced computing nodes, each with 64 megabytes(MB) of memory that can be expanded up to 256MB and a powerful front-end processor which is a hyperSPARC with a speed of 66/90/100 <b>megahertz</b> (MHz). Besides fluid dynamics, these high-speed computer systems were used {{in areas such as}} vision, medical imaging, signal processing, molecular modeling, neural networks and finite element analysis. The latest variant of the PACE series is the PACE ++, a 128 node parallel processing system. With a front-end processor, it has a distributed memory and message passing system. Under Project Chitra, the DRDO is implementing a system with a computational speed of 2-3 Teraflops utilising commercial off the shelf components and the Open Source Linux Operating System.|$|E
25|$|FM is {{also used}} at {{intermediate}} frequencies by analog VCR systems (including VHS) to record the luminance (black and white) portions of the video signal. Commonly, the chrominance component is recorded as a conventional AM signal, using the higher-frequency FM signal as bias. FM is the only feasible method of recording the luminance ("black and white") component of video to (and retrieving video from) magnetic tape without distortion; video signals have a large range of frequency components – from a few hertz to several <b>megahertz,</b> too wide for equalizers to work with due to electronic noise below −60dB. FM also keeps the tape at saturation level, acting {{as a form of}} noise reduction; a limiter can mask variations in playback output, and the FM capture effect removes print-through and pre-echo. A continuous pilot-tone, if added to the signal – as was done on V2000 and many Hi-band formats – can keep mechanical jitter under control and assist timebase correction.|$|E
25|$|Eitel-McCullough {{operated}} a large manufacturing plant in San Bruno for many years. William Eitel and Jack McCullogh formed {{the company in}} 1934. It specialized {{in the manufacture of}} power grid tubes. Known as Eimac, the company also made vacuum tubes used in communication equipment, as well as other products for military and commercial applications. Due to its work on broadcast transmission parts, Eimac {{operated a}}n FM radio station, KSBR, which transmitted on 100.5 <b>megahertz.</b> The station began operations in 1947 and, that same year, was one of only two in the nation to test Rangertone tape recorders. (The other station was WASH-FM in Washington, D.C.) The recorders were based on the German Magnetophon. In need of more space, the company moved to San Carlos in 1959. Eimac's San Carlos plant was dedicated on April 16, 1959. In 1965, Eimac merged with Varian Associates and became known as the Eimac Division. In 1995, Leonard Green & Partners purchased the entire Electron Devices Business from Varian and formed Communications & Power Industries.|$|E
500|$|The sensors {{reported}} their data via radio frequency channels ranging upward from 162 <b>megahertz</b> (MHz) to 174MHz {{on the very}} high frequency band. 31 channels were assigned to each type of sensor with a 375kHz separation between each channel. Every channel contained 27 identification codes or addresses which could be set in the field prior to emplacement. Thus, a total of 837 individual sensors (27x31) could be deployed {{at any one time}} without signal duplication in a single operational zone.|$|E
500|$|The other {{meaning of}} the term [...] "channel" [...] in {{telecommunications}} is seen in the phrase communications channel, which is a subdivision of a transmission medium {{so that it can be}} used to send multiple streams of information simultaneously. For example, one radio station can broadcast radio waves into free space at frequencies in the neighborhood of 94.5MHz (<b>megahertz)</b> while another radio station can simultaneously broadcast radio waves at frequencies in the neighborhood of 96.1MHz. Each radio station would transmit radio waves over a frequency bandwidth of about 180kHz (kilohertz), centered at frequencies such as the above, which are called the [...] "carrier frequencies". Each station in this example is separated from its adjacent stations by 200kHz, and the difference between 200kHz and 180kHz (20kHz) is an engineering allowance for the imperfections in the communication system.|$|E
500|$|Frequencies of {{the order}} of <b>megahertz</b> (MHz) are above the usual range for {{mechanical}} filters. The components start to become very small, or alternatively the components are large compared to the signal wavelength. The lumped element model described above starts to break down and the components must be considered as distributed elements. The frequency at which the transition from lumped to distributed models takes place is much lower for mechanical filters than it is for their electrical counterparts. This is because mechanical vibrations travel at the speed of sound for the material the component is composed of. For solid components, this is many times (x15 for nickel-iron) the speed of sound in air (...) but still considerably less than the speed of electromagnetic waves (approx. [...] in vacuum). Consequently, mechanical wavelengths are much shorter than electrical wavelengths for the same frequency. [...] Advantage can be taken of these effects by deliberately designing components to be distributed elements, and the components and methods used in electrical distributed element filters can be brought to bear. The equivalents of stubs and impedance transformers are both achievable. Designs which use a mixture of lumped and distributed elements are referred to as semi-lumped.|$|E
500|$|In March 1932, the {{arrangements}} for flying between Lympne and Croydon in poor visibility were altered. If the cloudbase {{was less than}} [...] above sea level, or the visibility was less than , aircraft were prohibited from using the Croydon–Caterham–Penshurst–Lympne route, but were to use either the Croydon–Merstham–Edenbridge or Croydon–Chelsfield–Shoreham–Otford–Wrotham route. Alternatively a rhumb line course could be flown on the Croydon–Chelsfield–Lympne route. Aircraft not fitted with radios had to notify the officer in charge at their departure airport as to which route they intended to take before departure. Royal Air Force aircraft would avoid these routes as far as practicable in conditions of poor visibility. On 25 August the Folkestone Trophy Race was held at Lympne and was won by a Comper Swift. In November, {{it was reported that}} new radio equipment was to be installed at Lympne and St Inglevert operating on the 15-cm waveband at 2,000 <b>Megahertz.</b> The new radios were to be used for the announcement of the departure of non-radio aircraft across the Channel. Messages sent by radio were also printed out by a teleprinter, providing a record of the communication. The new equipment was scheduled to come into operation in Spring 1933.|$|E
500|$|There is a {{limit to}} the {{applicability}} of this lumped element model. [...] The model works well if the components are small enough that the time taken for a wave to cross them is insignificant, or equivalently, if there is no significant phase difference in the wave either side of the component. [...] What amounts to significant depends on how accurate the model is required to be, but a common rule of thumb is to require components to be smaller than one sixteenth of a wavelength. [...] Since wavelength decreases with frequency, this puts an upper limit on the frequency that can be covered in this kind of design. [...] This limit is much lower in the mechanical domain than the equivalent limit in the electrical domain. [...] This is because the much higher propagation speeds in the electrical domain lead to longer wavelengths (mechanical vibrations in steel propagate at about 6,000m/s, electromagnetic waves in common cable types propagate at about [...] ). [...] For instance, traditional mechanical filters are only made up to around 600kHz (although MEMS devices can operate at much higher frequencies due to their very small size). [...] In the electrical domain, on the other hand, the transition from the lumped element model to the distributed element model occurs in the hundreds of <b>megahertz</b> region.|$|E
2500|$|Many {{electronic}} systems include processors of various sorts that operate at hundreds of <b>megahertz.</b> [...] Typically, the clocks supplied to these processors come from clock generator PLLs, which multiply a lower-frequency reference clock (usually 50 or 100nbsp&MHz) {{up to the}} operating frequency of the processor. [...] The multiplication factor can be quite large {{in cases where the}} operating frequency is multiple gigahertz and the reference crystal is just tens or hundreds of <b>megahertz.</b>|$|E

The row {{beginning with}} the hash symbol indicates {{that in this case}} frequencies are in <b>megahertz</b> (MHZ), S-parameters are listed (S), magnitudes are in dB log magnitude (DB) and the system impedance is 50 Ohm (R 50). There are 9 columns of data. Column 1 is the test frequency in <b>megahertz</b> in this case. Columns 2, 4, 6 and 8 are the magnitudes of , , [...] and [...] respectively in dB.

2500|$|For {{a typical}} k of about [...]95, the above formula is often written for a {{length in metres}} of 143/f or a length in feet of 468/f where f is the {{frequency}} in <b>megahertz.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The {{original}} antenna installation {{was a large}} D.S. Kennedy parabolic reflector, [...] high by [...] wide, radiating in {{the frequency}} range 175 to 215 <b>megahertz.</b> Standard GE high-power television transmitters, modified for pulse operation, were used initially.|$|E
2500|$|... where [...] is the {{absolute}} resonance frequency of the sample and [...] is {{the absolute}} resonance frequency of a standard reference compound, measured in the same applied magnetic field [...] [...] Since the numerator is usually expressed in hertz, and the denominator in <b>megahertz,</b> [...] is expressed inppm.|$|E
2500|$|All {{electronic}} systems emit some unwanted radio frequency energy. [...] Various regulatory agencies (such as the FCC in the United States) put {{limits on the}} emitted energy and any interference caused by it. [...] The emitted noise generally appears at sharp spectral peaks (usually at the operating frequency of the device, and a few harmonics). [...] A system designer can use a spread-spectrum PLL to reduce interference with high-Q receivers by spreading the energy over a larger portion of the spectrum. [...] For example, by changing the operating frequency up and down by a small amount (about 1%), a device running at hundreds of <b>megahertz</b> can spread its interference evenly over a few <b>megahertz</b> of spectrum, which drastically reduces the amount of noise seen on broadcast FM radio channels, which have a bandwidth of several tens of kilohertz.|$|E
2500|$|Australian VHDL {{programmer}} John Kent synthesized the 6809 {{processor and}} it is now freely available to hobbyists and others to use in FPGA designs.

2500|$|On March 30, 1946, {{radio station}} WHK [...] owned {{at that time}} by United Broadcasting Company, a {{subsidiary}} of Forest City Publishing, itself {{the parent company of}} The Plain Dealer [...] launched an experimental FM station under the callsign W8XUB at 107.1 <b>megahertz</b> (MHz). [...] On July 31, 1947, W8XUB began broadcasting at 100.7MHz. [...] On November 13, 1947, the new FM station transitioned from experimental to commercial status; increased its power; and changed its callsign to WHKX.|$|E
2500|$|WXVU, the FCC-licensed student-operated FM radio station, {{operates}} at 89.1 <b>megahertz.</b> With an output of 75 watts, WXVU {{can be heard}} for [...] around the campus and globally via the internet at http://tunein.com/radio/WXVU-891-s24085/. Since 1991, the station has offered a varied program of music, news, sports, public affairs, and specialty programming. WXVU is the successor to WKVU/WWVU, the university-sponsored student-run carrier-current station organized in 1946 {{by a group of}} electrical engineering students who had served in World War II as radio operators.|$|E
2500|$|Sand {{presents}} as a homogenous {{gray and}} allows the ultrasound waves to penetrate deep. It is distinguishable from feces, which is less homogenous, and gas colic, which does not allow the operator to see pass the gas. Additionally, the sand usually [...] "sparkles" [...] on ultrasound if it moves. Sand is best diagnosed using a 3.5 <b>megahertz</b> probe. Horses with gastrointestinal rupture will have peritoneal fluid accumulation, sometimes with debris, visible on ultrasound. Horses with peritonitis will often have anechoic fluid, or material in between visceral surfaces.|$|E
2500|$|Non-broadcast {{signals are}} also affected. [...] Mobile phone signals {{are in the}} UHF band, ranging from 700 to over 2600 <b>Megahertz,</b> a range which makes them even more prone to weather-induced {{propagation}} changes. [...] In urban (and to some extent suburban) areas with a high population density, this is partly offset {{by the use of}} smaller cells, which use lower effective radiated power and beam tilt to reduce interference, and therefore increase frequency reuse and user capacity. [...] However, since this would not be very cost-effective in more rural areas, these cells are larger and so more likely to cause interference over longer distances when propagation conditions allow.|$|E
