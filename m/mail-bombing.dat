5000|$|A ZIP bomb is {{a variant}} of <b>mail-bombing.</b> After most {{commercial}} mail servers began checking mail with anti-virus software and filtering certain malicious file types, EXE, RAR, Zip, 7-Zip, mail server software was then configured to unpack archives and check their contents as well. A new idea to combat this solution was composing a [...] "bomb" [...] consisting of an enormous text file, containing, for example, only the letter z repeating millions of times. Such a file compresses into a relatively small archive, but its unpacking (especially by early versions of mail servers) would use a greater amount of processing, which {{could result in a}} DoS (Denial of Service). A ZIP or [...]tar.gz file can even contain a copy of itself, causing infinite recursion if the server checks nested archive files.|$|E

5000|$|Anarchists had bombed Wall Street {{and sent}} a number of <b>mail-bombs</b> to {{prominent}} businessmen and government leaders. The public lumped together the entire far left as terrorists.

40|$|Ted Kaczynski and Bernie Madoff share much in common. Both are well-educated, {{extremely}} intelligent, charismatic figures. Both rose to {{the height}} of their chosen professions—mathematics and finance. And both will die in federal prison, Kaczynski for committing a twenty-year <b>mail-bombing</b> spree that killed three people and seriously injured dozens more, and Madoff for committing the largest Ponzi scheme in history, bilking thousands {{of people out of}} almost $ 65 billion. But that last similarity—Kaczynski’s and Madoff’s plight at sentencing—may not have had to be. While Kaczynski’s attorneys tirelessly investigated and argued every aspect of their client’s personal history, mental state, motivations, and sentencing options, Madoff’s attorneys offered almost nothing to mitigate his conduct, simply accepting his fate at sentencing. In the end, Kaczynski’s attorneys were able to convince the government, the court, and their client that a life sentence was appropriate despite that he committed one of the most heinous and well-publicized death penalty-eligible crimes in recent history. Madoff, on the other hand, with almost unlimited resources at his disposal, received effectively the same sentence— 150 years in prison—for a nonviolent economic offense. Why were these two ultimately given the same sentence? And what can Madoff, the financier with unimaginable wealth, learn from Kaczynski, the reclusive and remorseless killer, when it comes to federal sentencing? The answer lies in how attorneys use sentencing mitigation strategies. This Article contends that federal white collar defendants have failed to effectively use mitigation strategies to lessen their sentences, resulting in unnecessarily long prison terms for nonviolent offenders committing financial crimes. The white collar defense bar has inexplicably ignored the mitigation techniques perfected by capital defense attorneys, and in the process has failed to effectively represent its clients. After discussing the development of the mitigation function in capital cases and paralleling it with the evolution of white collar sentencing jurisprudence, particularly post-Booker, this article will present seven key mitigation strategies currently used by capital defense teams and discuss how these strategies might be employed in federal white collar cases. The goal throughout this Article will be to highlight new strategies and techniques available in defending white collar clients and to enhance sentencing advocacy in federal criminal cases...|$|E

40|$|Abstract- Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is {{the tool}} that {{is able to}} detect occurrences of {{intrusion}} at host, network, as well as application. One {{of the most common}} network attacks is Denial of Service (DoS) attack. In DoS attack, a single host will send huge number of packets to one machine and thus make the operating of the network and host slow. There are several algorithms that have been proposed to detect DOS attacks and most of these solutions are based on detection mechanisms that have the potential of producing high number of false alarms. In addition, most of the solutions are monitoring and analyzing packets inside the network instead of network flow. In this paper, signature of selected attacks such as Smurf, <b>Mail-Bomb</b> and Ping-of-Death which are based on network flow is considered. The proposed engine monitors the network flows to detect attacks and the results show less false negative error during monitoring. In addition signature based IDS which use fuzzy decision tree for monitoring network flow proves that there are improvements on speed of detection and also performance of system...|$|R
