6000|$|He ignored <b>my</b> <b>question.</b> <b>For</b> him, untroubled Nature was the best, he said, and, with {{a glance}} at his feet, the most beautiful. He professed himself a Nazarite, and shook back his Teutonic poet's shock of hair. So he came to himself, {{and for the rest}} of our walk he kept to himself as the thread of his discourse, and went over himself from top to toe, and strung thereon all topics under the sun by way of {{illustrating}} his splendours. But especially his foil was the relative folly, the unnaturalness and want of logic in his fellow men. He held strong views about the extreme simplicity of everything, only that men, in their muddle-headedness, had confounded it all. [...] "Hence, for example, these trams! They are always running up and down as though they were looking for the lost simplicity of nature. 'We dropped it here!'" [...] He earned a living, we gathered, [...] "some considerable way above the minimum wage," [...] which threw a chance light on the labour problem--by perforating records for automatic musical machines--no doubt of the Pianotist and Pianola kind--and he spent all the leisure he could gain in going to and fro in the earth lecturing on [...] "The Need of a Return to Nature," [...] and on [...] "Simple Foods and Simple Ways." [...] He did it for the love of it. It was very clear to us he had an inordinate impulse to lecture, and esteemed us fair game. He had been lecturing on these topics in Italy, and he was now going back through the mountains to lecture in Saxony, lecturing on the way, to perforate a lot more records, lecturing the while, and so start out lecturing again. He was undisguisedly glad to have us to lecture to by the way.|$|E

Realised as a system of representation of the global popular, recent articulations of popular experience tend to be absorbed into generic cross-cultural media representations shared on the glocal level of operation by cultural producers, consumers and practitioners across geographical borders. In this paper, I shall focus on the changing spectacle of ‘the local’ through its cinematic action (along with its alternative heroine mediation), in light of such a transnational articulation as the emerging dominant. My purpose is to examine how local action has been re-imagined and can be re-aligned {{in relation to the}} specifically historical, national and postcolonial mode of imagination under the contemporary glocal context of the Hong Kong ‘Special Administrative Region’ (HKSAR), as this particular post-colony is officially renamed...|$|E

40|$|My Exam work {{is about}} how to {{communicate}} with children. Reading for children is important and meaningful. They get connection with adults and inspiration to read and tell stories by there own. Therefore I created the draft to a children book. I made it up on my own. The text is in rhyme. I chose rhyme for many reasons. First of all, it is fun to write and read. Second, it is a help for children to remember a story. They also get a larger vocabulary. The story is about dreams. I made up small figures that come every night and tell our dreams. Abstract things as dreams {{can be difficult to}} explain for children. My story can be a help for parents to talk about good, or bad dreams. My position is, never lie to children. The story is just an explanation for fun, so children can think about something else, when they had a bad dream for example. <b>My</b> <b>question</b> <b>for</b> this work was; How do you communicate with children in a good way?

40|$|Ever since I was {{introduced}} to activity theory, I have been intrigued by its descriptional power and complexity. The promise {{that there was an}} alternative approach to cognitive science that was richer, more complex and underrated, appealed to me. Because of a small literature review we were asked to do for a HCI course, I was also confronted with the problems and limitations of the desktop metaphor. These two subjects seemed to be a perfect match, so I decided to write a thesis proposal. I have learned a lot from the research for this master's thesis and although the research has led me from Marxism to modern cognitive science, I have got the feeling that I have only scratched the surface of activity theory. As this master's thesis is not only the result of my own efforts, I would like to thank a number of people that have helped me throughout the process of writing this thesis.

40|$|ABSTRACT Title of Dissertation:	BRIDGING THE GAP: A PHENOMENOLOGICAL STUDY OF UNIVERSITY LIAISONS IN PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT SCHOOLS Mary Margaret Madden, Doctor of Philosophy, 2005 Dissertation Directed by:	Professor Francine Hultgren 				Department of Education Policy and Leadership 	In this {{hermeneutic}} phenomenological study, I {{explore the}} lived experience of six university faculty who serve as liaisons and coordinators in Professional Development Schools (PDSs) and {{bridge the gap}} between P- 12 schools and universities. <b>My</b> <b>question</b> <b>for</b> this investigation asks, "What is the lived experience of university faculty in Professional Development Schools?" The themes arising from their lived experiences are opened through the lifeworld dimensions of lived body, time, space and relation. Throughout this study, I have used the metaphors of bridge and building to understand the liaisons' experiences, as well as other metaphors brought forward by my conversants. These metaphors led to my understanding that the experience of a liaison is grounded in movement, that they become bridges as they engage in the process of building them. I examine {{the manner in which they}} were called to this work, and the importance of building relationships in order to sustain them. Through the building process, the liaisons are building identities as liaisons, as well as experiencing changes in their personal lives. I identify exuberance (Jamison, 2004) and sacrifice as essential elements of the liaisons' work. Reflecting on these themes has made me more aware of what the liaisons are required to do, the combination of relationship and administration, and I suggest ways in which schools and universities can re-design perceptions and structures to provide support for the liaisons as they do their work...|$|E
40|$|In this {{hermeneutic}} phenomenological study, I {{explore the}} lived experience of 5 middle school girls in grades 5 - 9, {{who have experienced}} bullying. <b>My</b> <b>question</b> <b>for</b> this study asks, 2 ̆ 2 What is the lived experience of adolescent girls who have experienced female bullying? 2 ̆ 2 The metaphor of queenbees and wannabees has helped me understand adolescent ways {{of being in the}} world as they have been bullied. In addition, understanding the lived experience of female bullying is developed through the exploration of the phenomenological life-world themes of body, time, space, and relationality. The theme of body is examined through physical being, emotional being, and intellectual being. Lived time is explored as these females experience bullying and their perception of bullying. The theme of space surfaces from where and how they have been bullied, to the spaces in which they feel threatened or safe. The life-world of relationality is explicated through the peers and adults who surround these middle school girls. The in [...] depth conversations with the researcher focused on the continuing, daily experiences of these female adolescents.;Themes that emerged from the text of the conversations disclose deeper meanings {{of what it means to}} be bullied: the deep desire to belong to a group; the feeling of being invisible, which includes the longing to have 2 ̆ 2 new stuff; 2 ̆ 2 the exclusion that accompanies being different; the helplessness of being cyber-bullied; the mighty sting of the queenbee, and the silent code language. These adolescents are, indeed, swimming in uncharted waters. I admire these brave adolescents for sharing their stories with me.;And as busy as teachers may be, they need to recognize female bullying and the many forms of it hidden under the radar. Educators should encourage students to tell them when they have been bullied, or when they have been a witness to a bullying incident. Bullying occurs primarily at schools: the hallways, the classrooms, the playground, and while riding the bus. It is left to the legal system to answer the questions that arise from cyber-bullying that is meted out by the bully from home. Educators need to take action regarding the bully; middle school girls have the right to feel safe at school. Without the feeling of safety it will be difficult for adolescent females to reach their full potential. This study has created new pedagogical possibilities for viewing the experience of female bullying including implications for teacher in [...] service and school bullying policies...|$|E
