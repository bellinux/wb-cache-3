5|$|One day {{somebody}} in the crowd identified me. Standing behind <b>me</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> woman, with lips blue from cold, who had, of course, never heard me called by name before. Now she started out of the torpor common to us all and asked me in a whisper (everyone whispered there):'Can you describe this?'And I said: 'I can.'Then something like a smile passed fleetingly over {{what had once been}} her face.|$|E
25|$|Contrary to the mythology, {{the early}} {{moments of the}} March—getting there—was no picnic. People were afraid. We didn't know what we would meet. There was no precedent. Sitting across from <b>me</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> black preacher with a white collar. He was an AME preacher. We talked. Every now and then, people on the bus sang 'Oh Freedom' and 'We Shall Overcome,' {{but for the most}} part there wasn't a whole bunch of singing. We were {{secretly}} praying that nothing violent happened.|$|E
25|$|Sly {{recorded}} {{two more}} albums for Epic: High on You (1975) and Heard You Missed Me, Well I'm Back (1976). High On You {{was billed as}} a Sly Stone solo album; Heard You Missed <b>Me</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> Sly and the Family Stone album in name only. Although Sly continued to collaborate {{with some of the}} original Family Stone members on occasion, the actual band no longer existed. Sly played most of the instruments on record himself; he maintained a band to support him for live shows. Among his main collaborators were Cynthia Robinson and Pat Rizzo from the Family Stone, and background vocalists Lynn Mabry and Dawn Silva, who parted with Sly in 1977 and formed The Brides of Funkenstein in 1978. Epic released Stone from his contract in 1977, and in 1979 released 10 Years Too Soon, a remix album featuring disco versions of the 1960s Family Stone hits.|$|E

500|$|... "Beautiful Stranger" [...] {{is a song}} {{recorded}} by American singer and songwriter Madonna. It was released on May 29, 1999, by Maverick and Warner Bros. Records as a single from the soundtrack of the film, [...] Madonna co-wrote and co-produced the song with William Orbit, and it was inspired by her then relationship with British writer Andy Bird. The soundtrack for Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged <b>Me</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> much expected release and Madonna's song was chosen by the album's executive producers to promote it. [...] "Beautiful Stranger" [...] has appeared on two separate Madonna greatest hits collections: GHV2 (2001) and Celebration (2009). Musically, [...] "Beautiful Stranger" [...] is a psychedelic pop song that features heavily reverberated guitars and bouncy drum loops. Its lyrics tell {{the tale of a}} romantic infatuation.|$|E
500|$|UT {{running backs}} Henry Melton and Ramonce Taylor also {{received}} criticism. Taylor {{was criticized for}} running backwards and sideways {{in an effort to}} gain yards, instead of moving ahead and breaking tackles. The Daily Texan observed [...] "Five of Taylor's 15carries resulted in a loss or no gain for a total of minus-17yards. However, the other 10carries totaled 119yards for an average of 11.9yards per positive running play. The sophomore didn't have a positive gain of fewer than 5yards and accumulated three runs of 20yards or longer." [...] Greg Davis, UT's offensive coordinator, said [...] "Ramonce is a darter. The only time that really concerned <b>me</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> third-and-two situation. We talked to him on the sideline about a little bit more down and distance awareness." [...] Melton was criticized for [...] "tiptoeing indecisively". and letting himself get tackled near the line of scrimmage.|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, {{the song}} is a [...] "melancholic and mature farewell" [...] to a failed {{relationship}}. Jody Rosen of Rolling Stone wrote Rihanna [...] "slow-boiling" [...] interprets the line [...] "What you did to <b>me</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> crime". According to Jude Rogers of BBC Music the lyrics of the song hint towards her failed relationship with Brown. A reviewer of Plugged In wrote that the lyrics that allude to this are [...] "And I let you reach me one more time/But that’s enough." [...] According to the reviewer, she later admits that the she was blind by her emotional confusion, [...] "your love ain’t the kind you can keep." [...] Jon Pareless of The New York Times wrote that Rihanna compares her love to a crime scene in the [...] "elegiac" [...] "Cold Case Love" [...] which features the couplet [...] "Prints, pictures and white outlines / Are all that's left {{at the scene of}} a cold case love".|$|E

2500|$|Shakur {{had enjoyed}} {{and had been}} {{influenced}} by the work of contemporary English and Irish pop musicians as a teenager such as Kate Bush, Culture Club, Sinéad O'Connor, and U2. His style on 2Pacalypse Now was highly influenced by the social consciousness and Afrocentrism pervading hip hop in the late 1980s and early 1990s. All Eyez on <b>Me</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> change of style from his earlier works; while still containing socially conscious songs and themes, Shakur's album was heavily influenced by party tracks and tended to have a more [...] "feel good" [...] vibe than his earlier albums.|$|E

2500|$|Tobe Liston inflicted whippings {{so severe}} on Sonny that the scars were still visible decades later. [...] "The only thing {{my old man}} ever gave <b>me</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> beating", Liston said. Helen Baskin moved to St. Louis, Missouri, with some of her children, leaving Liston—aged around 13, {{according}} to his later reckonings—in Arkansas with his father. Sonny thrashed the pecans from his brother-in-law's tree and sold them in Forrest City. With the proceeds, he traveled to St. Louis and reunited {{with his mother and}} siblings. Liston tried going to school but quickly left after jeers about his illiteracy; the only employment he could obtain was sporadic and exploitative.|$|E
2500|$|In a February 2008 {{interview}} on BBC Radio 2, Johnny Marr from the Smiths discussed McGeoch's contribution to [...] "Happy House": [...] "What {{it is about}} [...] "Happy House" [...] from a guitar playing point of view, is for a start it's modern. It's not got any {{of the sort of}} creaky old rock'n'roll aspects to it and it still sounded like the Banshees, almost more so. That's when I really began to become a fan of John McGeoch. It was an extra bonus for me that they'd got a great guitar player who had left another band and came in as a ringer and joined and not surprisingly, that to <b>me</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> very good scenario. I've always liked that. It was like getting George Best on the guitar".|$|E
2500|$|The film's {{original}} music segments are a drum score consisting {{entirely of}} solo jazz percussion performances by Antonio Sánchez. The score is offset {{by a number}} of well known classical music pieces, including Mahler and Tchaikovsky. Iñárritu did not regard the particular choice of classical pieces as important. Nonetheless, the choice of classical music was strongly oriented to highly melodic scores taken predominantly from the 19th century classical repertoire (Mahler, Tchaikovsky, Rachmaninov, Ravel). Iñárritu stated that the classical components come from the world of the play, citing the radio in Riggan's room and the show itself as two sources of the music. The classical music segments also included two compositions by American composer John Adams. Several jazz compositions by Victor Hernández Stumpfhauser and Joan Valent counterbalance the original music composition by Sánchez. The drum sections comprise the majority of the score however, and were composed by Sánchez. Iñárritu explained the choice by saying they helped to structure scenes, and that [...] "The drums, for <b>me,</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> great way to find the rhythm of the film... In comedy, rhythm is king, and not having the tools of editing to determine time and space, I knew I needed something to help me find the internal rhythm of the film." ...|$|E

2500|$|Orwig was the {{athletic}} director at Indiana University from 1961 to 1975. [...] He took over as athletic director in February 1961, ten months into a four-year NCAA probation. [...] On accepting the post, Orwig said: [...] "No strong athletic department has been built on fraud. [...] We'll never have {{a part of that}} as long as I am the director at Indiana University. [...] I know there have been mistakes made here, but I think they've been honest ones. [...] These are mistakes to be corrected." [...] In the 61 years preceding Orwig's arrival, Indiana had won 49 conference championships and seven NCAA championships. [...] During Orwig's 15 years, the Hoosiers won 37 Big Ten championships in seven sports and six NCAA titles including a tie for the Big Ten football title in 1967 and a Rose Bowl appearance. [...] Home football attendance at Indiana averaged 25,854 the year before Orwig arrived, and by 1969 it had more than doubled to 53,319. [...] Orwig also guided the expansion of the school's athletic facilities, including the Assembly Hall basketball facility. [...] Among the coaches hired by Orwig were John Pont in football and Bobby Knight in basketball. [...] Bobby Knight said of Orwig: [...] "Bill Orwig, {{the athletic}} director who hired <b>me,</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> man of exceptional intelligence and class who knew how to get along with people and work with coaches. He had a great arrogance, in a positive way—he knew he was damned good at what he did. [...] I think more than anybody else in the school's history, Bill Orwig developed Indiana's athletic program into a major league operation—facilities, teams, coaches. [...] Sam Bell was a nationally respected track coach. Doc Counsilman {{was one of the great}} coaches of all time; John Pont took a team to the Rose Bowl; and Jerry Yeagley started the soccer program and built it from nothing into the best one going. [...] The architect of all that, Bill Orwig, is in the college athletic directors hall of fame." [...] He was also one of the founders and the first president from 1969-1970 of the National Athletic Directors of America.|$|E
