The specimens underwent cyclic loading by means of a monobeveled steel chisel that was attached to the upper <b>movable</b> <b>component</b> of the machine. The load was applied {{at the base of the}} bracket in the occlusogingival direction. The load profile was in the form of a wave at a rate of 1 Hz. Compressive shear fatigue test for 5, 000 load cycles or until bond failure was determined by testing according to the staircase (up-and-down) method [24, 25]. The first specimen was tested at the approximate value of about 25 % of the static shear bond strength previously evaluated [26]. Then, the load was raised by a fixed amount of 20 Newton (N) for the next tested specimen. On the other hand, if the bracket did not survive, i.e., the bond failed at some point during the 5, 000 cycles, the load was lowered also by the same fixed amount of 20 N for the next specimen. This procedure of raising the maximum load by 20 N following a test where the orthodontic bond has not failed and lowering the load by the same fixed amount following a bond failure was continued for each following specimen until all ten specimens in each group were evaluated.|$|R
40|$|Measurement and {{variation}} {{control of}} geometrical Key Characteristics (KCs), such as flatness and gap of joint faces, coaxiality of cabin sections, is the crucial issue in large components assembly from the aerospace industry. Aiming to control geometrical KCs and {{to attain the}} best fit of posture, an optimization algorithm based on KCs for large components assembly is proposed. This approach regards the posture best fit, which is a key activity in Measurement Aided Assembly (MAA), as a two-phase optimal problem. In the first phase, the global measurement coordinate system of digital model and shop floor is unified with minimum error based on singular value decomposition, and the current posture of components being assembly is optimally solved in terms of minimum variation of all reference points. In the second phase, the best posture of the <b>movable</b> <b>component</b> is optimally determined by minimizing multiple KCs' variation with the constraints that every KC respectively conforms to its product specification. The optimal models and the process procedures for these two-phase optimal problems based on Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) are proposed. In each model, every posture to be calculated is modeled as a 6 dimensional particle (three movement and three rotation parameters). Finally, an example that two cabin sections of satellite mainframe structure are being assembled is selected to verify {{the effectiveness of the}} proposed approach, models and algorithms.

40|$|The {{observation}} that a starchless mutant (TC 7) of Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh. is gravitropic (T. Caspar and B. G. Pickard, 1989, Planta 177, 185 - 197) {{raises questions about}} the hypothesis that starch and amyloplasts play a role in gravity perception. We compared the kinetics of gravitropism in this starchless mutant and the wild-type (WT). Wild-type roots are more responsive to gravity than TC 7 roots as judged by several parameters: (1) Vertically grown TC 7 roots were not as oriented with respect to the gravity vector as WT roots. (2) In the time course of curvature after gravistimulation, curvature in TC 7 roots was delayed and reduced compared to WT roots. (3) TC 7 roots curved less than WT roots following a single, short (induction) period of gravistimulation, and WT, but not TC 7, roots curved in response to a 1 -min period of horizontal exposure. (4) Wild-type roots curved much more than TC 7 roots in response to intermittent stimulation (repeated short periods of horizontal exposure); WT roots curved in response to 10 s of stimulation or less, but TC 7 roots required 2 min of stimulation to produce a curvature. The growth rates were equal for both genotypes. We conclude that WT roots are more sensitive to gravity than TC 7 roots. Starch is not required for gravity perception in TC 7 roots, but is necessary for full sensitivity; thus it is likely that amyloplasts function as statoliths in WT Arabidopsis roots. Furthermore, since centrifugation studies using low gravitational forces indicated that starchless plastids are relatively dense and are the most <b>movable</b> <b>component</b> in TC 7 columella cells, the starchless plastids may also function as statoliths...|$|R
