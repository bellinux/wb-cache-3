5|$|Mild ale has a {{predominantly}} <b>malty</b> palate. It is usually dark coloured with an abv of 3% to 3.6%, {{although there are}} lighter hued milds as well as stronger examples reaching 6% abv and higher.|$|E
5|$|While {{a variety}} of beers are popular across Northern England, the region is {{especially}} associated with brown ales such as Newcastle Brown Ale, Double Maxim and Samuel Smith's Nut Brown Ale. Beer in the North is usually served with a thick head which accentuates the nutty, <b>malty</b> flavours preferred in Northern beers. On the non-alcoholic side, the North – in particular, Lancashire – was {{the hub of the}} temperance bar movement which popularised soft drinks such as dandelion and burdock, Tizer and Vimto.|$|E

5000|$|Export [...] - [...] a pale lager brewed around Dortmund that is fuller, <b>maltier</b> {{and less}} hoppy than Pilsner. 12-12.5° Plato, 5-5.5% ABV. Germany's most popular {{style in the}} 1950s and 1960s, it is now {{becoming}} increasingly rare.|$|R
50|$|Bock is {{a strong}} lager of German origin. Several substyles exist, {{including}} maibock (helles bock, heller bock), a paler, more hopped version generally made for consumption at spring festivals; doppelbock (double bock), a stronger and <b>maltier</b> version; and eisbock, a much stronger version made by partially freezing the beer and removing the ice that forms.|$|R
25|$|Vegemite is salty, {{slightly}} bitter, <b>malty,</b> {{and rich}} in umami – a glutamate similar in flavour to beef bouillon.|$|E
25|$|In 2011, {{the brewery}} had a {{capacity}} of over 1.5 million hectolitres (over 1 million barrels) per annum. Production in 2012 was 900,000 hectolitres, with around 40,000 hl in own brand sales. The bulk of the brewery's own production is cask conditioned ale but it also sells bottled and keg ales. The company's most famous beer is Strongarm, a 4% abv bitter introduced in 1955, and other regular beers are IPA, Bullion Gold and Trophy Special. Strongarm is made with 18 per cent crystal malt, which contributes significantly to its distinctive ruby red colour and its roasted, <b>malty</b> flavour.|$|E
25|$|Pot {{distilled}} gin represents the earliest style of gin, and is traditionally produced by pot distilling a fermented grain mash (malt wine) from barley or other grains, then redistilling it with flavouring botanicals {{to extract the}} aromatic compounds. The fermentation of grain mash produces a neutral alcohol (similar to vodka) that is predominately tasteless except for the iconic ethyl alcohol taste. A double gin can be produced by redistilling the first gin again with more botanicals. Due {{to the use of}} pot stills, the alcohol content of the distillate is relatively low; around 68% ABV for a single {{distilled gin}} or 76% ABV for a double gin. This type of gin is often aged in tanks or wooden casks, and retains a heavier, <b>malty</b> flavour that gives it a marked resemblance to whisky. Korenwijn (grain wine) and the oude (old) style of Geneva gin or Holland gin represent the most prominent gins of this class.|$|E
50|$|In February, 2012, Anchor Brewing in San Francisco created the Zymaster No. 1 Lager {{in honor}} of the lager the Boca Brewing Company and was an attempt to re-create Boca's lager. It uses two-row barley and {{mountain}} water, and is a single-hop beer. This traditional beer recipe is <b>maltier</b> and hoppier and stronger than most lagers on the market today.|$|R
50|$|However, {{it makes}} little sense {{to say that}} Canadian beer is merely {{the sum of its}} parts, or takes all of its {{influence}} from other styles. Brands like Molson Export, Moosehead and Sleeman, for example, led the way in crafting a softer and more palatable style of ale and lager for North American audiences, while still retaining strength. For example, Canadian-style ales - pale or dark - tend to be <b>maltier</b> than their American equivalents and more bitter than their English cousins.|$|R
50|$|American Pale Ales are {{generally}} around 5% abv with significant quantities of American hops, typically Cascade. Although American brewed beers {{tend to use}} a cleaner yeast, and American two row malt, it is particularly the American hops that distinguish an APA from British or European pale ales. The style {{is close to the}} American India Pale Ale (IPA), and boundaries blur, though IPAs are stronger and more assertively hopped. The style is also close to Amber Ale, though Amber Ales are darker and <b>maltier</b> due to use of crystal malts.|$|R
2500|$|Sierra Nevada's Celebration Ale {{has been}} brewed as a winter {{seasonal}} since 1981. While it has won medals under the IPA category, {{it has also}} been described as a hoppy, <b>malty</b> amber ale, as well as a [...] "bigger version" [...] of the company's pale ale.|$|E

5000|$|... 1935: Richard E. Byrd {{named the}} Horlick Mountains {{on the edge}} of the Ross Ice Shelf after William, in {{appreciation}} of his support. A small factory opened in Australia for the local market, including New Zealand. Horlicks milky-chocolate-flavoured disks in paper packets, which were eaten as candy, were marketed in the USA via radio commercials touting the ease with which they could be taken to school by children.In the USA, Horlicks Tablets were sold as a candy, offered in a glass bottle resembling an aspirin jar. In World War II the tablets were supplied to US, UK and other troops as an energy boosting treat, and included in lifeboat and liferaft rations, and aircrew escape kits. Today they are packaged in foil pouches, manufactured in Malaysia as Horlicks <b>Malties.</b>|$|R
2500|$|There is a North Korean {{variety of}} steam beer, an {{originally}} American style of beer brewed in {{higher than normal}} temperatures. The North Korean equivalent came about through necessity. Frequent power outages {{made it impossible to}} maintain a constant low temperature for brewing. North Korean steam beers are brewed with lager yeast, but for the same reason of unreliable refrigeration, ales are also well-liked. North Korean steam beers are so ubiquitous that {{it can be said that}} [...] "the average beer is a steam beer". Since rice— a staple in Asian beers— is reserved for food, and barley is not generally used in Korean cooking, there is ample barley to be used in brewing, up to the point of all-barley beers. As a result, beers are darker, fuller, and <b>maltier,</b> which is considered a perk over other Asian beers. Necessities have forced North Koreans to make, according to one writer, [...] "more interesting beers than most other countries of the world".|$|R
