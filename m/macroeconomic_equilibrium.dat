5000|$|In Schumpeter's book he {{proposed}} an idea radical for its time: the evolutionary perspective. He based his theory {{on the assumption}} of usual <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>equilibrium,</b> which is something like [...] "the normal mode of economic affairs". This equilibrium is being perpetually destroyed by entrepreneurs who try to introduce innovations. A successful introduction of an innovation (i.e. a disruptive technology) disturbs the normal flow of economic life, because it forces some of the already existing technologies and means of production to lose their positions within the economy.|$|E
50|$|The state {{serves as}} a {{safeguard}} for the ownership and as the coordinator of production through a universal economic plan. For the purpose of reducing waste and increasing efficiency, scientific planning replaces market mechanisms and price mechanisms as the guiding principle of the economy. The Marxist-Leninist state's huge purchasing power replaces the role of market forces, with <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>equilibrium</b> not being achieved through market forces but by economic planning based on scientific assessment. In the socialist economy, {{the value of a}} good or service is based on its use value, rather than its cost of production or its exchange value. The profit motive as a driving force for production is replaced by social obligation to fulfil the economic plan. Wages are set and differentiated according to skill and intensity of work. While socially utilised means of production are under public control, personal belongings or property of a personal nature that doesn't involve mass production of goods remains relatively unaffected by the state.|$|E

Until recently, he was a Professor of Economics at Princeton University and, before that, held positions at the University of Rochester, the University of Pennsylvania, and Northwestern University. He received numerous awards and grants, most recently the 2007 Söderberg Prize and a 2.1 Million Euro 2008 senior research grant from the European Research Council. Krusell's research has focused on macroeconomics, broadly defined, with particular contributions in the areas of technological change, inequality, political economy, macroeconomic policy, and labor economics. He is currently pursuing a long-term project on the interactions between global climate change and the economy. He is especially known for developing the most widely used computational algorithm for calculating <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>equilibrium</b> under rational expectations in economies with heterogeneous agents and aggregate uncertainty when financial markets are incomplete.

30|$|With {{respect to}} the neoclassical closure, the Keynesian closure {{consists}} of fixing the level of investments at a predetermined level (see Álvarez-Martínez and Polo 2012) and to endogenize the unemployment rate. The unemployment rate is then determined {{in order to satisfy}} the <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>equilibrium</b> condition between investments and aggregate savings, implying that aggregate production is demand-driven. In particular, and in contrast to neoclassical models, the <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>equilibrium</b> may be an under-unemployment equilibrium, implying that unemployment appears in the case in which the level of the aggregate demand is insufficient.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{develops}} a business cycle {{model with a}} financial intermediation sector. Financial wealth {{is defined as a}} predetermined state variable. Both, the additional sector of financial intermediaries and predetermination of financial wealth, affect the demand for real financial wealth. If real financial wealth also enters the monetary policy rule, the conditions for stability and uniqueness of the <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>equilibrium</b> path change fundamentally compared to standard New Keynesian business cycle models. Here, real financial wealth is interpreted as a real broad monetary aggregate. Furthermore, different interest rate rules and their consequences for stability and uniqueness of the <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>equilibrium</b> path are considered. Two monetary policy rules are found to be feasible - i. e. if these monetary policy rules are applied there exists a stable and unique <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>equilibrium</b> path.

40|$|The global {{financial}} crisis (GFC) {{has had a}} negative effect on the Bolivian economy. The outbreak of the GFC has caused a drop in export commodity prices such as mining and hydrocarbons, and a reduction in remittances. Bolivia however, was in a relatively good position to deal with the negative effects of the GFC. The country has experienced in recent years an important commodity price boom, which significantly increased external revenues, public and private incomes and consumption levels. Although the GFC has had a mild effect on the Bolivian economy so far, there are important structural factors that could put at risk the long term sustainability of policies and of the <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>equilibriums.</b> Among these factors are: i) a low investment rates, which could risk growth prospects and employment creation; ii) a large dependency of Bolivia fiscal sector on the hydrocarbon rent, which makes the long term sustainability of macroeconomic policies and of the current economic situation questionable; iii) the lack of a favourable investment climate required to increase growth and employment, which depends among other factors of the rule of law, property rights, judicial security, clearer and more stable rules of the game, macroeconomic stability, etc. iv) lack of a clearer strategy in relation to the country external insertion is also necessary. Access to larger markets, with higher incomes and purchasing power, is necessary to promote sustainable growth and employment creation, and to reduce the vulnerability of the Bolivian economy to shocks. Trade agreements with the USA, European Union and other regions of the world are necessary to promote investment, growth and employment creation. Financial crisis, Bolivia...|$|R

30|$|An {{important}} feature of the CGE model is its macro closure. The <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>equilibrium</b> condition states that aggregate investments must be equal to aggregate savings. The neoclassical closure, {{which is the most}} frequently used in general equilibrium models, implies that investments are then savings-driven, i.e., the <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>equilibrium</b> condition determines the aggregate investment. The use of the neoclassical closure implies that a shock which increases the value of a component of the aggregate demand produces a strong and unreasonable effect on investments, while the effect on the GDP is negligible since GDP is determined by the supply of production inputs that are assumed to be fully employed in the economy.|$|E
