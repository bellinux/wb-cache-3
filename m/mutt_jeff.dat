5000|$|<b>Mutt</b> and <b>Jeff</b> is {{a long-running}} and widely popular American {{newspaper}} comic strip created by cartoonist Bud Fisher in 1907 about [...] "two mismatched tinhorns".

They made 36 <b>Mutt</b> and <b>Jeff</b> short comedies in 1913, but production ceased for two years when Fisher's copyright was challenged. Once the courts upheld Fisher's copyright claim, the comic strip was syndicated nationwide, and between 1916 and 1926, his film production company created another 277 <b>Mutt</b> and <b>Jeff</b> film productions.

MI5 used <b>Mutt</b> and <b>Jeff's</b> radio sets to relay false information, leading the Germans to believe that the United Kingdom intended to invade Norway (this activity was a component of Operation Fortitude). To ensure the German handlers did not suspect <b>Mutt</b> and <b>Jeff</b> of having sold out, MI5 arranged for fake sabotage operations - supposedly the work of the pair - to take place, in one case {{going so far as to}} set off a controlled explosion at a power plant which was widely reported in the local media as a genuine attack.|$|R
