5|$|Considered {{to be one}} of the <b>most</b> <b>impressive</b> {{examples}} of medieval Bulgarian architecture, the Round Church takes its name from the distinctive shape of one of its three sections, the cella (naos), which is a rotunda that serves as a place of liturgy. The church's design also includes a wide atrium and a rectangular entrance area, or narthex, marked by two circular turrets.|$|E
5|$|The cathedral is {{considered}} the largest and <b>most</b> <b>impressive</b> structure of Ani. It is a domed basilica with a rectangular plan, though the dome {{and most of its}} supporting drum are now missing. Its use of pointed arches and cluster piers has been widely cited by scholars to have possibly influenced, or at least preceded, Gothic architecture.|$|E
5|$|This {{spectacular}} moth {{is considered}} one of the <b>most</b> <b>impressive</b> and beautiful Lepidoptera, rivalling almost any of the butterflies in brilliance of colouring and form. It is featured in most coffee table books on the Lepidoptera, and is much sought after by collectors. It is collected in the wild, and raised commercially for the international butterfly trade; its wings were used to make jewellery in the Victorian era.|$|E

5|$|After Tommy Docherty's brief spell as manager, Willie Ormond {{was hired}} in 1973. Ormond lost his first match in charge 5–0 to England, but {{recovered}} to steer Scotland to their first World Cup finals in 16 years in 1974. At the 1974 World Cup finals in West Germany, Scotland achieved their <b>most</b> <b>impressive</b> performance at a World Cup tournament. The team was unbeaten but failed to progress beyond the group stages on goal difference. After beating Zaïre, they drew with both Brazil and Yugoslavia, and went out because they had beaten Zaïre by the smallest margin.|$|E
5|$|Brooker {{originally}} {{wrote the}} episode in an apocalyptic setting, {{but when the}} script {{was about to be}} filmed at a former U.S. Air Force base, he changed it because of a fence he saw there. He rewrote the story in two days, removing some details he considered useful for a sequel story. The main change was the addition of a plot twist {{at the end of the}} script, which was noted as the <b>most</b> <b>impressive</b> aspect of the episode by several reviewers.|$|E
5|$|By the Iron Age, Scotland {{had been}} {{penetrated}} by the wider La Tène culture. The Torrs Pony-cap and Horns {{are perhaps the}} <b>most</b> <b>impressive</b> of the relatively few finds of La Tène decoration from Scotland, and indicate links with Ireland and southern Britain. The Stirling torcs, found in 2009, are a group of four gold torcs in different styles, dating from 300 BC and 100 BC Two demonstrate common styles found in Scotland and Ireland, but the other two indicate workmanship from what is now southern France and the Greek and Roman worlds.|$|E

5|$|From the Iron Age {{there are}} more {{extensive}} examples of patterned objects and gold work. Evidence of the wider La Tène culture includes the Torrs Pony-cap and Horns. The Stirling torcs demonstrate common styles found in Scotland and Ireland and continental workmanship. One of the <b>most</b> <b>impressive</b> items from this period is the boar's head fragment of the Deskford carnyx. From the first century CE, as Rome carried {{out a series of}} occupations, there are Roman artifacts like the Cramond Lioness and Roman influence on material culture can be seen in local stone carvings.|$|E
5|$|In 1941, Chen {{arrived in}} Chongqing, China's wartime capital, where {{he joined the}} China Film Studio and the Central Cinematography Studio run by the Nationalist government.

His <b>most</b> <b>impressive</b> wartime contribution was the staging of Qu Yuan, a famous 1942 play by Guo Moruo. In 1942, he also published Rules of Cinema, which is considered the first comprehensive Chinese book on film theory.|$|E
5|$|In archaeological nomenclature, Norte Chico is a pre-ceramic {{culture of}} the pre-Columbian Late Archaic; it {{completely}} lacked ceramics and apparently had almost no visual art. The <b>most</b> <b>impressive</b> achievement of the civilization was its monumental architecture, including large earthwork platform mounds and sunken circular plazas. Archaeological evidence suggests use of textile technology and, possibly, the worship of common god symbols, both of which recur in pre-Columbian Andean cultures. Sophisticated government is assumed to have been required to manage the ancient Norte Chico. Questions remain over its organization, particularly the influence of food resources on politics.|$|E

5|$|Muslim women, {{particularly}} {{those from the}} Ayyubid family, the families of local governors, and {{the families of the}} ulema ("religious scholars") took an active role in Ayyubid architecture. Damascus witnessed the most sustained patronage of religious architecture by women. They were responsible for the construction of 15 madrasas, six Sufi hospices, and 26 religious and charitable institutions. In Aleppo, the Firdaws Madrasa, known as the <b>most</b> <b>impressive</b> Ayyubid building in Syria, had regent queen Dayfa Khatun as its patron.|$|E
5|$|On 30 June 2006, the Tour de France {{announced}} that Basso would not ride the 2006 Tour after apparent {{involvement in the}} Operación Puerto doping scandal. Sastre took over as captain and was the strongest in the favorite group on the last mountain stages, but a poor last time trial placed him fourth overall. The team scored two stage wins, the <b>most</b> <b>impressive</b> Fränk Schleck's win on Alpe d'Huez. Voigt had already won a flat stage after a long break.|$|E
5|$|One of the <b>most</b> <b>impressive</b> single-game {{performances}} by any player in NHL history came on April 27, 1994. Hašek made 70 saves in a 4OT shutout. The opposing goalie was Martin Brodeur, then a rookie, who made 49 saves before being beaten by Dave Hannan and the Sabres beat New Jersey 1–0, which helped the Sabres {{to tie the}} series 3-3 {{in the first round}} of the Stanley Cup Playoffs. Hašek's 70 saves set a record, which still stands, for the most saves in a game without allowing a goal.|$|E

5|$|Some of the studio's <b>most</b> <b>impressive</b> {{releases}} were foreign productions.

5|$|The Gray's Inn masque in 1588 {{with its}} centrepiece, The Misfortunes of Arthur by Thomas Hughes, is {{considered}} by A.W. Ward be the <b>most</b> <b>impressive</b> masque thrown {{at any of the}} Inns. William Shakespeare performed at the Inn at least once, as his patron, Lord Southampton, was a member. For the Christmas of 1594, his play The Comedy of Errors was performed by the Lord Chamberlain's Men before a riotous assembly of notables in such disorder that the affair became known as the Night of Errors and a mock trial was held to arraign the culprit.|$|E
5|$|The Newstead Helmet, {{found at}} the Roman fort in Newstead, near Melrose in Roxburghshire, {{is one of the}} <b>most</b> <b>impressive</b> of many finds of Roman arms and armour. The Staffordshire Moorlands Pan is a second-century Romano-British trulla {{apparently}} decorated as a souvenir for a soldier who had served on Hadrian's Wall, and probably made locally. A number of items were also found in the Sculptor's Cave, Coversea in Morayshire, including Roman pottery, rings, bracelets, needles and coins, some of which had been re-used for ornaments.|$|E

5|$|The first Christiansborg Palace in Copenhagen, {{designed}} by Elias David Häusser and {{completed in the}} 1740s, was {{certainly one of the}} <b>most</b> <b>impressive</b> Baroque buildings of its day. Although the palace itself was destroyed by fire in 1794, the extensive showgrounds and riding arena completed by Niels Eigtved have survived undamaged and can be visited today. Fredensborg Palace (1731), the royal residence on the shore of Sealand's Lake Esrum, with its exquisite Chancellery House, is the work of Johan Cornelius Krieger who was the court gardener at Rosenborg Castle. The park at Fredensborg is one of Denmark's largest and best preserved Baroque gardens.|$|E
