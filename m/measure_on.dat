5|$|Ahead of the storm, all {{ports in}} Gujarat, {{including}} Kandla, {{one of the}} largest in the country, were closed as a precautionary <b>measure.</b> <b>On</b> May25, over 10,000 people were evacuated from coastal areas in the threatened region. Throughout India, a total of 118,800 people were evacuated and 100,000 more were evacuated in Pakistan. The Indian military was placed on standby to undertake search-and-rescue missions immediately after the storms' passage. Fourteen districts of Gujarat were placed on red alert, the highest level of preparedness. Seven emergency control centers were set up across the country and officials alerted hospitals and fire crews about the approaching storm.|$|E

5|$|As {{a treaty}} {{document}} {{with a foreign}} nation, the Tyler-Texas annexation treaty required {{the support of a}} two-thirds majority in the Senate for passage. But in fact, when the Senate voted on the <b>measure</b> <b>on</b> June 8, 1844, fully two-thirds voted against the treaty (16–35). The vote went largely along party lines: Whigs had opposed it almost unanimously (1–27), while Democrats split, but voted overwhelmingly in favor (15–8). The election campaign had hardened partisan positions on Texas among Democrats. Tyler had anticipated that the measure would fail, due largely to the divisive effects of Secretary Calhoun's Packenham letter. Undeterred, he formally asked the House of Representatives to consider other constitutional means to authorize passage of the treaty. Congress adjourned before debating the matter.|$|E

40|$|Most {{information}} discovery processes need {{to understand}} the reasons {{of the success of the}} inference methods or the usability of the new information, which can sometimes be somehow explained with a few useful <b>measures</b> <b>on</b> the premises or on the chosen relations, logics and implications. This chapter presents a state of art on the latest concepts of measure, from the additive measures, to monotone fuzzy measures and the latest monotone measures in relation to a preorder that gives an ordering for a measurable characteristic. A few <b>measures</b> <b>on</b> fuzzy sets and fuzzy relations are proposed. Namely, the entropy <b>measures</b> <b>on</b> fuzzy sets, which are a measure of fuzziness in itself, and the specificity <b>measures</b> <b>on</b> fuzzy sets, which cam be understood as measures of utility of the information contained in a fuzzy set. Some <b>measures</b> <b>on</b> fuzzy relations to be considered are the conditionality measures, which are degrees of generalization of modus ponens when making fuzzy inference. Those <b>measures</b> <b>on</b> fuzzy sets and fuzzy relations provide interesting information on fuzzy inference and approximate reasoning processes...|$|R

5|$|Following the mutiny of the French Guards a {{few hours}} before the {{storming}} of the Bastille, the only troops immediately available for the security of the palace at Versailles were the aristocratic Garde du Corps (Body Guard) and the Cent-Suisses (Hundred Swiss). Both were primarily ceremonial units and lacked the numbers and training to provide effective protection for the royal family and the government. Accordingly, the Flanders Regiment (a regular infantry regiment of the Royal Army) was ordered to Versailles in late September 1789 by the king's minister of war, the Comte de Saint-Priest, as a precautionary <b>measure.</b> <b>On</b> 1 October, the officers at Versailles held a welcoming banquet for the officers of the new troops, a customary practice when a unit changed its garrison. The royal family briefly attended the affair, walking amongst the tables set up in the opera house of the palace. Outside, in the cour de marbre (central courtyard), the soldiers' toasts and oaths of fealty to the king grew more demonstrative as the night wore on.|$|E

In particular, the spectral theorem for self-adjoint compact operators on Hilbert spaces provides a canonical decomposition of Gaussian <b>measures</b> <b>on</b> Hilbert spaces, the so-called Karhunen-Lò eve expansion. In this paper, we extend this result to Gaussian <b>measures</b> <b>on</b> Banach spaces {{in a very}} similar and constructive manner. In some sense, this {{can also be seen}} as a generalization of the spectral theorem for covariance operators associated to Gaussian <b>measures</b> <b>on</b> Banach spaces.

It is demonstrated that these geometrically defined quantities coincide with the Verblunsky coefficients, which appear in the Szegö recursions for the matrix orthogonal polynomials. Finally, we provide an alternative proof of the Geronimus relations {{which is based on}} a simple relation between canonical moments of matrix <b>measures</b> <b>on</b> the interval [− 1, 1] and the Verblunsky coefficients corresponding to matrix <b>measures</b> <b>on</b> the unit circle...|$|R
