Staple foods of Indian cuisine include pearl millet (bājra), rice, whole-wheat flour (aṭṭa), and a variety of lentils, such as masoor (most often red lentils), toor (pigeon peas), urad (black gram), and mong (<b>mung</b> <b>beans).</b> Lentils may be used whole, dehusked—for example, dhuli moong or dhuli urad—or split. Split lentils, or dal, are used extensively. The spice trade between India and Europe is often cited by historians as the primary catalyst for Europe's Age of Discovery.|$|E

However, the effect of processing on properties of <b>mung</b> <b>bean</b> has not been widely studied in Sri Lanka. In the current study, effect of processing (boiling and sprouting) on some nutritional and functional properties of <b>mung</b> <b>bean</b> was investigated in comparison with raw <b>mung</b> <b>bean.</b> <b>Mung</b> <b>bean</b> seeds (Vigna radiata), varity MI 6 {{were obtained from the}} Government Seed Center, Dambulla, Sri Lanka. Proximate composition, gross energy, insoluble dietary fibre (IDF) and soluble dietary fibre (SDF) contents,total phenolic content (TPC), total flavonoid content (TFC), α-amylase inhibition capacity, DPPH and ABTS scavenging activities were determined.

25|$|In Sri Lanka, {{several types}} of congee are known as kenda in Sinhalese. Sinhala people use congee as a breakfast, a side dish, an {{accessory}} to indigenous medical therapies, and a sweet. Kenda can be prepared with many ingredients, including rice, roasted rice, rice flour, finger millet flour, sago, coconut milk, herbs, tubers, kitul flour, and mung bean. When it is prepared with rice and water only, it is known as hal kenda. If salt is added to bring a much saltier taste, it is known as lunu kenda, a dish commonly used as a supplementary diet in purgation therapy in indigenous medical traditions. If roasted rice is used, the congee becomes bendi hal kenda, utilized to treat diarrheal diseases. If rice flour and coconut milk are the main ingredients, such congee is known as kiriya. If finger millet flour and water is used, it is known as kurakkan anama. If coconut milk is added, the dish is called kurakkan kenda. If sago is used, such congee is known as sawu kenda. A special type of congee prepared from the byproducts of coconut oil production is known as pol kiri kenda. There are many varieties of kola kenda, congee with herbs as an ingredient; sometimes, a vaidya or veda mahttaya (a physician trained in indigenous medical traditions) might prescribe a special type of kola kenda, known under such circumstances as behet kenda. Sinhala villagers use specific tubers for preparing congee, such as Diascorea species tubers.

Leaf Area Index (LAI), plant dry weight (DW), height of plants and root length density (RLD) were measured with a ten day interval, starting at 32 days after sowing (DAP). Besides these morphological parameters, leaf stomatal resistance (r(s)) was measured with a porometer. Moisture regime was the factor most significantly influencing r(s) as well for <b>mung</b> <b>bean</b> in all cases as for the weeds. At 32 DAP, r(s) was significantly influenced by the applied moisture regime in <b>mung</b> <b>bean</b> with C. rotundus. r(s) of S. nodiflora was high due to the combined effect of drought stress and competition.

In the MPI group, the expression of sterol regulatory-element binding factor 1 (SREBF 1) mRNA in the liver was significantly different when compared with the casein group.
