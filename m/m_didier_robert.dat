50|$|In 1757, Gilles and <b>Didier</b> <b>Robert</b> De Vaugondy {{published}} The Atlas Universel, one of {{the most}} important atlases of the 18th century. To produce the atlas, the Vaugondys integrated older sources with more modern surveyed maps. They verified and corrected the latitude and longitude of many regional maps in the atlas with astronomical observations. The older material was revised with the addition of many new place names. In 1760, <b>Didier</b> <b>Robert</b> de Vaugondy was appointed geographer to Louis XV.|$|R

5|$|In February 2016, the {{conservative}} {{majority in the}} Regional Council of Réunion with president <b>Didier</b> <b>Robert</b> announced plans to transform the national park into a regional nature park. Too restrictive rules, which hindered tourism development, was cited as a motive. A regional nature park, unlike a national park, functions {{on the basis of}} mutual agreements and has no power to establish its own regulations. Park officials and opposition politicians rejected the plan, saying it would threaten the island's biodiversity, the World Heritage listing, and critical access to state funding. It would be the first case of a national park in France being downgraded. In September 2016, the national park's director, Marylène Hoarau, announced her withdrawal upon pressure from Ségolène Royal, head of the Ministry of Ecology, Sustainable Development and Energy. This led the park's president, Daniel Gonthier, to suspect political interference; Hoarau had criticised Robert for launching a call for proposals {{on the future of the}} park. In an interview,Robert denied involvement in Hoarau's departure and criticised the minister for her decision.|$|R

40|$|The {{evolution}} {{of real estate}} in Roubaix". The rebuilding of the industrial textile town of Roubaix has been carried on {{for a few years}} now. Hundreds of lodgings have been demolished. A study of the {{evolution of}} the ownership of these lodgings will tell us of the reason of their existence and of their architectural design, it will also allow us to throw a light on one essential signification of urban rebuilding, The building of working-class lodgings in the Roubaix "courees" was ensured by a whole class of little landlords who found thus a means of subsistence. Under the influence of many different factors this building has stopped. In spite of attempts by certain organizations such as the "P. A. C. T. " the ownership was gradually scattered to become nowadays a refuge-property for some categories of population having very little financial means. The present rebuilding brings a conclusion to this evolution and to the gradual vanishing of the little landlords class by the replacing of the "courees" by subsidized flats and of individual initiative by the intervention of the State and of the "H.

40|$|After {{a steady}} {{increase}} since the 1950 s, laryngeal cancer mortality had tended {{to level off}} since the early 1980 s in men from most European countries. To update trends in laryngeal cancer mortality in Europe, age-standardized (world standard) mortality rates per 100, 000 were derived from the WHO mortality database for 33 European countries over the period 1980 - 2001. Jointpoint {{analysis was used to}} identify significant changes in mortality rates. In the European Union (EU) as a whole, male mortality declined by 0. 8 % per year between 1980 and 1989, by 2. 8 % between 1989 and 1995, by 5. 3 % between 1995 and 1998, and by 1. 5 % thereafter (rates were 5. 1 / 100, 000 in 1980 - 1981 and 3. 3 / 100, 000 in 2000 - 2001). This mainly reflects a decrease in rates in men from western and southern European countries, which had exceedingly high rates in the past. Male laryngeal mortality rose up to the early 1990 s, and leveled off thereafter in several countries from central and eastern Europe. In 2000 - 2001 there was still a 10 - 15 -fold variation in male laryngeal mortality between the highest rates in Croatia (7. 9 / 100, 000) and Hungary (7. 7 / 100, 000) and the lowest ones in Sweden (0. 5 / 100, 000) and Finland (0. 8 / 100, 000). Laryngeal cancer mortality was comparatively low in women from most European countries, with stable rates around 0. 3 / 100, 000 in the EU as a whole over the last 2 decades. Laryngeal cancer trends should be interpreted in terms of patterns and changes in exposure to alcohol and tobacco. Despite recent declines, the persistence of a wide variability in male laryngeal cancer mortality indicates that there is still ample scope for prevention of laryngeal cancer in Europe.

IMEA 043 -CESAR trial working group info:eu-repo/semantics/article article 2016 Journal of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndromes (1999) 714390 - 398 <![CDATA[OBJECTIVE: The aim of the trial was to evaluate in patients under antiretroviral therapy (ART) the effect of rosuvastatin on cellular and soluble markers of immune activation/inflammation, as well as to identify patients who better benefit from statin administration. METHODS: IMEA- 043 -CESAR was a phase II open-label pilot trial that enrolled patients under suppressive ART and CD 4 < 500 /mm. Patients received rosuvastatin (20 mg/d) for 12 weeks. The primary outcome was the variation at week 12 (W 12) in the proportion of CD 38 HLA-DRCD 8 T lymphocytes. Secondary outcomes included evolution of other markers of T-cell activation and of inflammatory biomarkers between baseline, W 12, and W 24. RESULTS: Fifty patients were enrolled; end points were available for 43 patients. When considering all patients, the proportion of CD 38 HLA-DRCD 8 T cells did not significantly decline throughout the follow-up. However, the proportion of CD 38 CD 8 T cells significantly decreased at W 12 [median percentage change of - 22. 2 % (- 32. 3; + 1. 4) ]. Principal component analysis allowed identification of 3 groups of patients based on their baseline activation/inflammation profiles, 1 group with elevated levels of CD 8 T-cell activation, and a small group with high levels of systemic inflammation and low levels of T-cell activation. Half of the patients exhibited relatively low levels of inflammation and activation. The proportion of activated CD 8 T cells significantly decreased only in the particular group of patients with high baseline CD 8 T-cell activation. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that combining rosuvastatin with effective ART can result in a sustained decrease in CD 8 T-cell activation and highlights the importance of identifying patients who can benefit from specific immunotherapeutic strategies...|$|R
