40|$|The {{conception}} of industrialization {{in reference to}} agriculture of six North-Western Gubernyias being a considerable part of the Taken Lands, has quite different dimension than in other sectors of partitioned Poland. Using two terms – industrialization of agricultural production and employment of modern methods of increasing this production – is more adequate here. The 1890 s {{and the beginning of}} the 20 th century are the years of intensive development in using new tools and agricultural machines in Polish manors, where wooden harrows and primitive ploughs had been still used in the 1870 s, but at the turn of the 19 th century, <b>multiple</b> <b>furrow</b> <b>ploughs,</b> cultivators, reaping machines, mowers and steam-threshers occurred. Many landlords invested money in alcohol distillery, increasing potatoes raising. Growing specialization of agricultural production can be clearly seen – Belorussian Gubernyias were the second in the production of milk and its products in European part of Russia. The reasons of this big modernizing development, as for the borderlands gubernyias, lie mainly in the falling profitability of traditional corn-growing and in the eagerness of Polish landlords for increasing profits from their properties...|$|R

40|$|The International Livestock Centre for Africa (ILCA) and the International Crops Re search Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT) have {{developed}} a <b>furrowing</b> <b>plough</b> which enables better use {{to be made of}} the vertisols found in the upland plains of Ethiopia. These fertile soils are too hard to be worked during the dry season and are quickly waterlogged during the rainy season which considerably reduces their productivity. According to trials carried out in 1986, such ploughing reduces the waterlogging of the rooting zone and produces higher yields. It can be done without a large investment by a <b>furrowing</b> <b>plough</b> made from two traditional ploughs attached together by a wood frame and pulled by a pair of oxen.

40|$|ABSTRACT: If inappropriately conducted, {{management}} and sowing practices may compromise {{the environment and}} the profitability of the agricultural activity. The aim {{of this study was to}} analyze the furrow opener mechanisms action and the level of load applied to soil firming mechanism in no-till, on the Oxisol resistance to penetration during soybean sowing, under three soil moistures. The experiment was arranged in split-split plot design, in which the plots were composed by three soil moistures (23. 8; 25. 5 and 27. 5 % b. s.), two furrow opener mechanisms sub-plots (double disks and <b>furrow</b> <b>plough)</b> and the split-split plot of three levels of load applied to soil firming mechanism (12. 2; 18. 5 and 24. 1 kPa), according to randomized blocks design, with three replications. The soil moisture provided different resistance behavior to penetration with the depth, on the seedbed, independently of the furrow opener and the level of load applied to soil firming mechanism. The <b>furrow</b> <b>plough</b> use provided less soil resistance to penetration when compared to the double disk furrow opener, on the seedbed, independently of the soil moisture and the level of load applied to soil firming mechanism.

50|$|Bailliehill Mount's summit has {{evidence}} of earthworks that are sub-circular with an earthen bank {{on all sides}} except the NW, with an interior height of around 0.5m and an exterior height of around 2.3m. An entrance may have existed to the north where the bank seems to stop short of the steep slope although that section has been subject to landslips that may have removed {{evidence of}} this part of any bank.

50|$|Rushock Hill has {{extensive}} {{evidence of}} ridge and <b>furrow</b> <b>ploughing</b> which extends {{into a lot}} of surrounding woodland. Other features include the uncommon site of dry stone walling (not a common local feature) and specimen trees and earthworks which suggest 18th century landscaping. Capability Brown is known to have visited Eywood House in the valley below in Titley and though no evidence of any work being done by him exists the substantial evidence of landscaping suggests that great wealth and imagination was used to greatly alter the hill and surrounding area and would benefit from some modern archaeological investigation.|$|R
50|$|The {{earthworks}} {{are located}} {{a little to}} the north west of the present village of Spurstow, which is believed to have subsequently contracted or moved. They lie in a valley, which formerly contained a stream. There are six house platforms which are 25-40 metres2 in area, each of which is surrounded by a 2-metre ditch. To {{the north side of the}} platforms and abutting them there is evidence of medieval ridge and <b>furrow</b> <b>ploughing.</b> A later causeway runs north-south, bisecting the site. The existing lane to Haycroft farm represents part of an old road from Ridley Green to Beeston.|$|R
