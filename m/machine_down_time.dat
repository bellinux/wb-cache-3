40|$|The {{manufacturing}} industry is constantly {{looking for ways}} to reduce production costs {{and at the same time}} to increase productivity. Automation of common manufacturing operations is one of these methods. By automating common manufacturing operations; various machines, robots, control systems and information technologies are used to reduce the overall human input requirement (mental and physical). Recent advances in technology have made it possible to now also automate (or facilitate) the maintenance requirement of these machines and tools. Modern tools and machines, which can estimate when it will fail or when failure is imminent have obvious advantages for predictive maintenance purposes. Another function of this technology is to determine how efficiently a tool or machine operates, or what the quality of the produced goods is. Predictive maintenance can decrease manufacturing plant or <b>machine</b> <b>down</b> <b>times</b> – which have a positive effect on cost-savings – has gained considerable importance over the last two decade...|$|R

40|$|AbstractLi-Ion {{batteries}} are crucial components in mobile devices {{that range from}} cellular phones to electrical vehicles. With the increasing demand {{in the market for}} these devices, manufacturers are required to reduce production cycle times. The main components of the Li-Ion {{batteries are}} anode and cathode foils, which are cut in required forms by punching. These materials consist of Cu sheets sandwiched between graphite layers for anode, and Al sheets sandwiched between Li metal oxide layers for cathode. In punching, the process quality degrades in time due to tool wear. This eventually causes <b>machine</b> <b>down</b> <b>times</b> for tool repair or change, which can increase the whole process cycle time drastically. Laser remote cutting based on ablation can be adequate solution to substitute the current technology, if the cutting edge quality and productivity can be matched to punching. This paper investigates laser microcutting of Li-Ion battery anode and cathode thin foils with ns-pulsed fibre lasers. These laser sources are cost effective and provide industrially robust operation. Two systems operating with 1 μm and 0. 5 μm wavelength and 250 ns and 1 ns pulse durations respectively were compared.

40|$|Abstract: A set of jobs can be {{processed}} without interruption by a flexible machine {{only if the}} set of tools required by all jobs can be loaded in the tool magazine. However, in practice {{the total number of}} tools required by a job set would exceed the tool magazine capacity.

With the advancement of internet technologies, customer services nowadays are supported through web-based systems. More recently, rapid development of the semantic web and semantic web services has prompted us to develop a semantic help-desk for supporting customer services over the semantic web environment, which is presented in this paper. In particular, a fuzzy formal concept analysis (FCA) -based approach is developed for automatic generation of fuzzy machine service ontology that can deal with uncertain information. The proposed automatic fuzzy ontology generation technique consists of the following steps: fuzzy formal concept analysis, fuzzy conceptual clustering, and ontology generation. As such, the supporting machine services provided by the proposed system will potentially improve customer satisfaction in terms of reducing <b>machine</b> <b>down</b> <b>time</b> and increasing productivity.

40|$|Introduction Having two (or more) equal {{treatment}} machines (linac twins) enables a radiotherapy department {{to facilitate the}} workflow. The {{major part of the}} German standards (DIN) regarding quality assurance of medical linear accelerators has been reworked or has been published {{for the first time in}} the recent years due to technical developments. The aim of this study is to setup a commissioning procedure and a quality assurance program for linac twins with flattening filter free option and to investigate if time required for commissioning and quality assurance can be reduced as compared to 2 linacs of different types. This includes the radiotherapy planning system (RTPS). Material and Methods Tenders were invited to provide two linacs of the same type to replace the old Siemens Primus machines. We asked for linacs with two photon energies (6 and 15 MV), additional flatness filter free (FFF) option, capability of intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) and volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT), and 5 - 6 different electron energies between 4 MeV and 22 MeV. Our requirement was that patients should be treatable at both machines with the same treatment plan. The first of the twin machines, an Elekta Synergy with Agility head, XVI Cone Beam CT, and Iview Portal Imaging has been installed and commissioned according to earlier experiences [1] and has been running in the clinical routine for several months, but initially not FFF. The second linac will be installed in April, therefore no comparative measurements are shown here but may be added for the final presentation. Although commissioning tests, the determination of basic performance characteristics, and consistency tests for linacs according the German standards [2] have to be accomplished for each machine, they can at least be set up identically without modifications for twin machines. This is also applicable for performance characteristics and consistency testing concerning special techniques as stereotactic radiotherapy [3; 4], and IMRT [5; 6], as well as electronic portal imaging devices (EPID) [2]. For commissioning of the linac in the RTPS Oncentra 4. 3 (Nucletron an Elekta Company) a set of geometrical data, absolute, and relative dose measurements is required in addition to the acceptance test of the linac. The data are processed by the company to create a model of the treatment unit, which takes several weeks according to our experience. Once the model is delivered by the company, it has to be validated by the customer. One aim of the study is to investigate, if this procedure can be reduced to the validation process for the second linac. The draft of the German standard for consistency tests of RTPS DIN 6873 – 5 [7] requires calculations for each treatment machine. Probably part 1 of DIN 6873 for commissioning of RTPS which is in development will demand this too. Having only one treatment machine model reduces time and effort for quality assurance. The German directive “Strahlenschutz in der Medizin” [8], paragraph 2. 3. 4, requires a concept to ensure patient treatment even during <b>machine</b> <b>down</b> <b>times</b> (e. g. maintenance or breakdown). Linac twins allow shifting all patients from one machine to the other without calculating new treatment plans. The record and verify system (Mosaiq) can be configured in a manner that fields for one machine can be delivered at the other without warnings or password confirmation. Discussion and Conclusion We expect that the time and effort for commissioning and quality assurance will be reduced for linac twins. Earlier experiences with the Siemens Primus machines (of different generations) have shown that it was possible to get equivalent dose distributions at least for standard photon energies. As much more this should be possible for linacs of the same production series...|$|R

40|$|Turning {{is one of}} the {{important}} machining processes in manufacturing industries. Tools wear during turning, {{is one of the}} major problems which may lead to production loss and <b>machine</b> <b>down</b> <b>time.</b> An effective tool wear monitoring method is therefore required to minimise the above. The work done in this thesis is related to the development of a new method for tool wear monitoring using tool-emitted sound signal in conjunction with newly reported Hilbert Huang Transform (HHT). In the proposed method, the condition of the cutting tool insert is monitored to classify its state into three different categories, namely, fresh, slightly worn and severely worn by analysing the tool-emitted audible sound. A trained competitive neural network is employed for this purpose. The network is trained by using the instantaneous amplitudes and instantaneous frequencies extracted from the tool-emitted sound using HHT. The novelty of the present work is the use of HHT to extract the instantaneous amplitudes and the frequencies of the tool-emitted sound to determine the condition of the cutting tool insert based on its flank wear. HHT is a recently developed signal processing technique more suitable for analysing nonstationary and nonlinear signals such as tool-emitted sound...|$|E
40|$|It is {{critical}} {{to ensure that a}} 5 -axis machine tool is operating within its geometric tolerance. However, there are various sources of errors influencing its accuracy; testing them with current methods requires expensive equipment and long <b>machine</b> <b>down</b> <b>time.</b> This motivates the development of a simple and fast way to identify and characterise geometric errors of 5 -axis machine tools. A method using a Double Ball Bar (DBB) is proposed to characterise rotary axes Position Independent Geometric Errors (PIGEs), which are caused by imperfections during assembly of machine components. An established method is used to test the same PIGEs, and the results are used to validate the developed method. The Homogeneous Transformation Matrices (HTMs) are used to build up a machine tool model and generate DBB error plots due to different PIGEs based on the given testing scheme. The simulated DBB trace patterns can be used to evaluate individual error impacts for known faults and diagnose machine tool conditions. The main contribution is the development of the fast and simple characterisation of the PIGEs of rotary axes. The results show the effectiveness and improved efficiency of the new methods, which can be considered for 5 -axis machine tool maintenance and checking...|$|E
40|$|Implementing a {{predictive}} maintenance model {{does not have}} to be a five year, million dollar project. There are relatively simple steps a maintenance team can take to see results within the first year. Because overall cost of {{predictive maintenance}} is up to four time less expensive than preventative maintenance, as many assets as possible should be covered by predictive maintenance. Facilitating the transition to predictive maintenance is made easier with a Computerized Maintenance Management System. A good CMMS is user-friendly, automatically produces preventative maintenance work orders, and tracks all work done on each piece of machinery. IR scans and vibration analysis are two predictive maintenance techniques that can increase uptime.
