2500|$|The US Public Health Study of Syphilis at Tuskegee {{began as}} a 6-month {{descriptive}} epidemiological study {{of the range of}} pathology associated with syphilis in the Macon County population. At that time, it was believed that the effects of syphilis depended on the race of those affected. For African Americans, physicians believed that their cardiovascular system was more affected than the central nervous system. Initially, subjects were studied for six to eight months and then treated with contemporary methods, including Salvarsan, <b>mercurial</b> <b>ointments,</b> and bismuth. These methods were, at best, mildly effective. [...] The disadvantage that these treatments were all highly toxic. The Tuskegee Institute participated in the study, as its representatives understood the intent was to benefit public health in the local poor population. The Tuskegee University-affiliated hospital effectively loaned the PHS its medical facilities, and other predominantly black institutions and local black doctors participated as well.|$|E

40|$|ACONVENIENT {{method of}} ridding hens of body lice is the {{application}} of <b>mercurial</b> or blue <b>ointment,</b> a method advo-cated by Pearl, Surface, and Curtis (1915). The ointment is applied by rubbing three pieces, {{about the size of}} a small pea, one underneath each wing and the vent. How-ever, on a small test it was observed that the use of <b>mercurial</b> <b>ointment</b> on setting hens was disastrous to the hatch. Since no literature could be found on this subject, it was decided to run a more comprehensive test on the effect of <b>mercurial</b> <b>ointment</b> on hatchability, particularly with the view of determining the effect on hatchability of eggs from treated breeding stock when arti...|$|R

In 1860 Dr. Duffield owned a small drugstore {{at the corner of}} Gratiot and Woodward Avenues. Dr. Duffield made a variety of pharmaceutical preparations, including Hoffman’s anodyne and <b>mercurial</b> <b>ointment,</b> but was overwhelmed by the operations of the business.|$|R

Before embarking for a voyage, it is {{convenient}} to enclose the guns in a leaden case, which, on arrival, can be melted up into bullets. It is remarkable how much better dirty guns withstand rust than clean ones.|$|R
