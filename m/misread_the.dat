Garner, who narrated the original commercial, stated that his first action ever to be captured on film was to <b>misread</b> <b>the</b> line that had been provided to him.

5|$|Unaware that Novara {{had been}} disabled, and fearing that his ships would be drawn {{too close to}} the Austrian naval base at Cattaro, Acton broke off the pursuit. The {{destroyer}} Acerbi <b>misread</b> <b>the</b> signal, and attempted to launch a torpedo attack, but was driven off by the combined fire of Novara, Saida, and Helgoland. At 12:05, Acton realized the dire situation Novara was in, but by this time, the Sankt Georg group was too close. The Sankt Georg group rendezvoused with Novara, Saida, and Helgoland, and Csepel and Balaton reached the scene as well. The entire group returned to Cattaro together.|$|E
5|$|Shortly before 16:00, Hipper's force {{encountered}} Vice Admiral Beatty's battlecruiser squadron. The German {{ships were}} the first to open fire, at a range of approximately 15,000 yards (14,000m). When the British ships began returning fire, confusion amongst the British battlecruisers resulted in Moltke being engaged by both New Zealand and Tiger. The British rangefinders had <b>misread</b> <b>the</b> range to their German targets, and so the first salvos fired by the British ships fell a mile past the German battlecruisers. At 16:52, Moltke hit Tiger with two main gun shells, but neither of these hits caused any significant damage. Moltke then fired a further four shells, two of which hit simultaneously on the midships and after turrets, knocking both out for a significant period of the battle.|$|E
5|$|To {{finance the}} scheme, Otto, Augustus and Charles Morse met with Charles T. Barney, {{president}} of the city's third-largest trust, the Knickerbocker Trust Company. Barney had provided financing for previous Morse schemes. Morse, however, cautioned Otto that he needed much more money than he had to attempt the squeeze and Barney declined to provide funding. Otto decided to attempt the corner anyway. On Monday, October 14, he began aggressively purchasing shares of United Copper, which rose in one day from $39 to $52 per share. On Tuesday (Oct. 15), he issued the call for short sellers to return the borrowed stock. The share price rose to nearly $60, but the short sellers {{were able to find}} plenty of United Copper shares from sources other than the Heinzes. Otto had <b>misread</b> <b>the</b> market, and the share price of United Copper began to collapse.|$|E
40|$|Reading always entails {{an act of}} {{interpretation}} and all interpretation involves misreading. All poets cannot {{be separated from the}} previous ones.

This misreading is not a mistake, but it is meant to create new meaning to the available text. By <b>misreading</b> <b>the</b> previous texts, the poet creates a space of creativity for himself. There are six ways of misreading as explicated by Harold Bloom. In this article only three ways of misreading will be explained and applied, namely clinamen, tessera, and kenosis...|$|R

5|$|His {{specific}} origins are unclear; {{according to}} the seventeenth-century genealogist Père Anselme, {{he was the son}} of Ursio I, viscount of Melun, a town about 50 kilometres outside Paris in the Brie region of the French Vexin, which was later known as the Île-de-France. Anselme believed William succeeded his father in 1084, and was later succeeded by his own son, Ursio II. However, in the nineteenth century, Adolphe Duchalais showed that Anselme <b>misread</b> <b>the</b> charters he was using; all that is known for certain is that Ursio was viscount in 1085 and William was viscount in 1094. There is no definite record of an Ursio II, and after William there is no viscount known until Adam, who married the daughter of the previous, unnamed viscount in 1138. William was presumably related to Ursio but his specific relationship to him and the other viscounts is unknown.|$|E
5|$|Subsequent {{hardware}} units under Iwata's tenure, {{including the}} Nintendo 3DS and Wii U, {{were not as}} successful as the DS and Wii, and Nintendo's finances took a downward turn starting in 2010. During the development phase of the 3DS, a handheld device featuring stereoscopic 3D without the need of accessories, Iwata stated that his background in technology helped keep Nintendo's engineers in line. It was hoped that the successor to the Nintendo DS would reinvigorate the company after profits began declining. However, weak sales upon {{the release of the}} Nintendo 3DS caused the company's stock to fall by 12percent on July29, 2011. The console's poor sales prompted a price cut in August from its launch price of US$250 to US$170. Sales of the 3DS continually fell below expectations. Iwata later admitted in 2014 that he <b>misread</b> <b>the</b> market and did not appropriately account for changing lifestyles since the launch of the Wii. He continually placed focus on family-oriented games despite declining popularity.|$|E

25|$|The Police Act of 1919 was {{the death}} knell of NUPPO. It {{established}} the Police Federation, a public sector version of a company union, to replace NUPPO. Under the Act, NUPPO was outlawed as a representative body for the police and forbade them from belonging to a trade union. NUPPO had no options but to fight or fold; unsurprisingly, it chose to fight. This time, however, it was the union that <b>misread</b> <b>the</b> mood of the men when it called for another strike.

25|$|For their part, the German {{high command}} <b>misread</b> <b>the</b> Allied objectives, believing the Allied assault to {{be a general}} {{pressure}} along the front designed to induce collapse at any given point. Hitler had agreed to a partial withdrawal in the north (the Erstein salient) during the night of 28 January but forbade a general withdrawal over the Rhine. German outposts in the Vosges Mountains were pulled back, but the confusion of the withdrawal and {{the pressures of the}} battlefield resulted in many units becoming mixed with one another. While this did not affect the numbers available for combat, it did lower the defensive cohesion of the German units. On 29 January, Heeresgruppe Oberrhein was dissolved as a headquarters, and the units in the Colmar Pocket were again subordinated to Heeresgruppe G (Army Group G), under the command of SS-Obergruppenführer Paul Hausser.|$|E

25|$|The tour itself began uneventfully, {{although}} Hutton {{was dismissed}} {{by his first}} ball of the tour, in a warm up match against Bermuda. The first-class matches began in Jamaica; the M.C.C. team inflicted only the third defeat on Jamaica by a touring side {{in the first game}} (Hutton had played in another when Yorkshire won a match on their 1936 tour) and he second was drawn. As the Test series began, Hutton wanted to exploit what he saw as a West Indian weakness against pace which had been exploited by Australia in 195152; he picked four fast bowlers but had <b>misread</b> <b>the</b> pitch, which played very slowly. West Indies were able to build up a big score before England collapsed to the West Indies spinners. Stollmeyer batted again, receiving abuse from the crowd for not enforcing the follow-on, and set a target of 457 to win. Although Hutton believed that the target was achievable on the easy batting pitch, England's batsmen again failed, losing by 140 runs. Both captains employed time-wasting tactics in the match, and used negative leg theory bowling, outside leg stump. Hutton himself scored 24 and 56; in the second Test, he scored 72 and 77 but could not prevent another loss. He had lost his seventh consecutive toss in Tests and despite the loss of early wickets, West Indies scored 383. Wisden criticised Hutton for not placing fielders on the boundary to cut off runs. In reply, England batted very slowly, batting nearly 160 overs for a score of 181; Wisden believed that Hutton was weighed down by responsibility, batting for four and a half hours before being caught from a desperate attacking shot, possibly affected by barracking from the crowd. West Indies batted again and set a target of 495. England were bowled out for 313 to lose by 181 runs.|$|E
