The <b>multilayered</b> <b>ceramic</b> with combination of Al 2 O 3 /Al 2 O 3 and Al 2 O 3 /SiO 2 samples were prepared via compression method.

The tendency of ceramic and electrode layers thinning to 100 to 200  nm that is used for increasing of capacitor dielectric capacity leads to the necessity of the powder size decreasing to 10 to 20  nm. At the same time, these powders used as electrode materials should fulfill the requirements for morphology, particle size distribution, ability to disperse in organic solvents, and impurity composition.

Fifteen of the ceramic coated rings were stacked vertically in the casing at one time for each test. There was a total of 36 rings.

2500|$|Many new {{developments}} are targeted at reducing parasitic inductance (ESL). This increases the resonance {{frequency of the}} capacitor and, for example, can follow the constantly increasing switching speed of digital circuits. Miniaturization, especially in the SMD <b>multilayer</b> <b>ceramic</b> chip capacitors (MLCC), increases the resonance frequency. Parasitic inductance is further lowered by placing the electrodes on the longitudinal side of the chip instead of the lateral side. The [...] "face-down" [...] construction associated with multi-anode technology in tantalum electrolytic capacitors further reduced ESL. Capacitor families such as the so-called MOS capacitor or silicon capacitors offer solutions when capacitors at frequencies up to the GHz range are needed.|$|E
