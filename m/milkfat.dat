2500|$|In {{parallel}} with the enormous shift (in industrialized nations) away from breastfeeding to home-made formulas, nutrition scientists continued to analyze human milk and attempted to make infant formulas that more closely matched its composition. [...] Maltose and dextrins were believed nutritionally important, and in 1912, the Mead Johnson Company released a milk additive called Dextri-Maltose. This formula was made available to mothers only by physicians. In 1919, <b>milkfats</b> were replaced with a blend of animal and vegetable fats {{as part of the}} continued drive to closer simulate human milk.

2500|$|In the United States, the Code of Federal Regulations {{includes}} a Standard of Identity for [...] "Parmesan and reggiano cheese". This defines both {{aspects of the}} production process and of the final result. In particular, parmesan must be made of cow's milk, cured for 10 months or more, contain no more than 32% water, and have no less than 32% <b>milkfat</b> in its solids. Most grated parmesans in the US have cellulose added as an anti-caking agent, with up to 4% considered acceptable under Federal law. Several manufacturers have been investigated for allegedly going beyond the 4% limit.|$|E
2500|$|The {{provinces of}} North Holland, South Holland, Zeeland, Utrecht and the Gelderlandic region of Betuwe are {{the parts of}} the Netherlands which make up the region in which western Dutch cuisine is found. Because of the {{abundance}} of water and flat grass lands that are found here, the area is known for its many dairy products, which includes prominent cheeses such as Gouda, Leyden (spiced cheese with cumin), Edam (traditionally in small spheres) as well as Leerdammer and Beemster, while the adjacent Zaanstreek in North Holland is since the 16th century known for its mayonnaise, typical whole-grain mustards and chocolate industry. Zeeland and South Holland produce a lot of butter, which contains a larger amount of <b>milkfat</b> than most other European butter varieties. A by-product of the butter-making process, karnemelk (buttermilk), is also considered typical for this region. Seafood such as soused herring, mussels (called Zeeuwse Mossels, since all Dutch mussels for consumption are cleaned in Zeeland's Oosterschelde), eels, oysters and shrimps are widely available and typical for the region. , once a local delicacy consisting of small chunks of battered white fish, has become a national fast food, just as [...] Pastries in this area tend to be quite doughy, and often contain large amounts of sugar; either caramelised, powdered or crystallised. The oliebol (in its modern form) and Zeeuwse bolus are good examples. Cookies are also produced in great number and tend to contain a lot of butter and sugar, like stroopwafel, as well as a filling of some kind, mostly almond, like [...] The traditional alcoholic beverages of this region are beer (strong pale lager) and Jenever, a high proof juniper-flavored spirit, that came to be known in England as gin. A noted exception within the traditional Dutch alcoholic landscape, Advocaat, a rich and creamy liqueur made from eggs, sugar and brandy, is also native to this region.|$|E

50|$|Homogenised milk is {{an example}} of a Pickering-stabilized emulsion. Casein (protein) units are adsorbed at the surface of milk fat {{globules}} and act as a surfactant. The casein replaces the <b>milkfat</b> globule membrane, which is damaged during homogenisation.|$|E
50|$|Asides from risk of illness, {{eating too}} much ice cream can lead to high blood {{cholesterol}} levels, due to its high <b>milkfat</b> content of at least 10%, which in turn can increase ones {{risk for heart disease}} or stroke.|$|E
50|$|In the U.S., the Food and Drug Administration {{requires}} products {{marketed as}} frozen custard to contain at least 10 percent <b>milkfat</b> and 1.4 percent egg yolk solids. If {{it has a}} smaller percentage of egg yolk solids, it is considered ice cream.|$|E
50|$|Pasteurized process {{cheese spread}} is a pasteurized {{processed}} cheese product prepared using {{one or more}} cheeses, additional ingredients and sometimes food additives such as emulsifiers (e.g. potassium phosphate and tartrate) and food stabilizers to limit product separation (e.g. carrageenan and xanthan gum). Cream, <b>milkfat,</b> sweeteners, water, salt, various seasonings and artificial color are sometimes used as ingredients. In the United States, the amount of cheese products used in pasteurized process cheese spread {{must be at least}} 51 percent, must contain at least 20 percent <b>milkfat,</b> and the moisture content must be between 44 percent to 60 percent, not exceeding 60 percent.

50|$|Manufactured filmjölk is {{made from}} pasteurised, homogenised, and {{standardised}} cow's milk. Although homemade filmjölk {{has been around for}} a long time (written records from the 18th century speak of filmjölk-like products, but it has probably been around since the Viking Age or longer), it was first introduced to the Swedish market as a consumer product in 1931 by the Swedish dairy cooperative Arla. The first filmjölk was unflavoured and contained 3% <b>milkfat.</b> Since the 1960s, different varieties of unflavoured filmjölk have been marketed in Swedish grocery stores. Långfil, a more elastic variant of filmjölk was introduced in 1965; lättfil, filmjölk with 0.5% <b>milkfat</b> was introduced in 1967; and mellanfil, filmjölk with 1.5% <b>milkfat</b> was introduced in 1990. In 1997, Arla introduced its first flavoured filmjölk: strawberry flavoured filmjölk. The flavoured filmjölk was so popular that different flavours soon followed. By 2001, almost one third of the filmjölk sold in Sweden was flavoured filmjölk. Since 2007, variations of filmjölk include filmjölk with various fat content, filmjölk flavoured with fruit, vanilla, or honey, as well as filmjölk with probiotic bacteria that is claimed to be extra healthful, such as Onaka fil which contains Bifidobacterium lactis (a strain of bacteria popular in Japan) and Verum Hälsofil which contains Lactococcus lactis L1A in quantities of at least 10 billion live bacteria per deciliter.|$|E
50|$|Heptadecanoic acid, or margaric acid, is a {{saturated}} fatty acid. Its {{molecular formula}} is CH3(CH2)15COOH. It occurs as a trace {{component of the}} fat and <b>milkfat</b> of ruminants, {{but it does not}} occur in any natural animal or vegetable fat at high concentrations. Salts and esters of heptadecanoic acid are called heptadecanoates.|$|E
50|$|The current {{trend toward}} reduced-fat content is {{believed}} to have resulted in an inferior product. To imitate Hungarian-style cooking and the use of smetana (called tejföl in Hungarian), Hungarian cookbooks recommend using Western sour cream mixed with heavy whipping cream (38-40% <b>milkfat).</b> Unlike sour cream mixed with whipping cream, smetana is not a homogenized product.|$|E

50|$|Milk {{equivalent}} is {{a measure}} of the quantity of fluid milk used in a processed dairy product. Measured on a <b>milkfat</b> basis, it takes about 21.8 pounds of farm milk to make a pound of butter, and about 9.2 pounds to make a pound of American cheese. Measured on a skim solids basis, it takes about 11.6 pounds of farm milk to make a pound of nonfat dry milk. Farm milk weighs about 8.6 pounds per gallon.|$|E

Such products tend to be classified as [...] "cheese food", [...] "cheese spread", or [...] "cheese product" [...] (depending primarily {{on the amount of}} cheese, moisture, and <b>milkfat</b> present in the final product).|$|E
5000|$|Per U.S. Food and Drug Administration regulations, Romano cheese can be {{made from}} cow, goat, and/or sheep's milk. It must contain less than 34% water and at least 38% <b>milkfat.</b> Cream, skim milk and/or dry milk and water can be added or removed to create the correct level of <b>milkfat.</b> Milk can be {{bleached}} with benzoyl peroxide or a mixture of benzoyl peroxide with potassium alum, calcium sulfate, and magnesium carbonate but, in that case, vitamin A must be added after treatment. Safe artificial blue or green coloring may be added only to counter any yellow coloring of the milk. Rennet {{does not need to be}} used and any [...] "suitable milk-clotting enzyme that produces equivalent curd formation" [...] may be used. Curd must be broken up to the size of corn kernels, stirred and heated to 120 F. The curd is drained, pressed into forms and the cheese is then soaked in brine for 24 hours. After brining, it is rubbed with salt and washed several times. Next it is dry-cured. It is occasionally turned and scrapped and may be coated with vegetable oil. Romano must be aged at least five months.|$|E

50|$|Smetana {{is one of}} {{the names}} for a range of sour creams from Central and Eastern Europe. It is a dairy product {{produced}} by souring heavy cream. It is similar to crème fraîche (28% fat), but nowadays mainly sold with 10% to 30% <b>milkfat</b> content depending on the country. Its cooking properties are different from crème fraîche and the lighter sour creams sold in the US, which contain 12 to 16% butterfat. It is widely used in cooking and baking.|$|E
50|$|Sainte-Maure de Touraine is an unpasteurized cheese {{made from}} full fat goat's milk. It has {{the form of}} a small log, around 16-17 cm in length, and weighs at least 250 g. It is white and soft under a greyish moldy rind and is rolled in wood ash. It has a straw through its centre, marked by the AOC seal and a number {{indicating}} the producer. The straw is used, in the making, to keep the roll together. The finished cheese has 45% <b>milkfat.</b>|$|E
50|$|A newborn {{cheese is}} usually salty yet bland in flavor and, for harder varieties, rubbery in texture. These qualities are {{sometimes}} enjoyed—cheese curds are eaten on their own—but normally cheeses {{are left to}} rest under controlled conditions. This aging period (also called ripening, or, from the French, affinage) lasts from {{a few days to}} several years. As a cheese ages, microbes and enzymes transform texture and intensify flavor. This transformation is largely a result of the breakdown of casein proteins and <b>milkfat</b> into a complex mix of amino acids, amines, and fatty acids.|$|E
50|$|Giant elands give large {{quantities}} of tender meat and high-quality hides even if fed a low-quality diet. These are game animals and are also hunted for trophies. Their milk is comparatively richer in proteins and <b>milkfat</b> than dairy cows, which may be {{an explanation for the}} quick growth of eland calves. Eland's milk has about triple the fat content and twice the protein of a dairy cow's milk. Its docility and profitable characteristics have made it a target of domestication in Africa and Russia and has also resulted in hunting.|$|E
