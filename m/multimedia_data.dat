25|$|RTP was {{developed}} by the Audio/Video Transport working group of the IETF standards organization. RTP is used in conjunction with other protocols such as H.323 and RTSP. The RTP standard defines a pair of protocols: RTP and RTCP. RTP is used for transfer of <b>multimedia</b> <b>data,</b> and the RTCP is used to periodically send control information and QoS parameters.|$|E
25|$|An RTP sender {{captures the}} <b>multimedia</b> <b>data,</b> then encodes, frames and transmits it as RTP packets with {{appropriate}} timestamps and increasing sequence numbers. Depending on the RTP profile in use, the sender may set the Payload Type field. The RTP receiver captures the RTP packets, detects missing packets, and may reorder packets. It decodes the frames {{according to the}} payload format and presents the stream to its user.|$|E

Abstractly, {{the task of}} a distributed multimedia system is to process <b>multimedia</b> traffic <b>data.</b> Hence, the quality of service of distributed multimedia systems is related to a fundamental issue how to accurately represent the <b>multimedia</b> traffic <b>data</b> to be processed. This paper discusses a correlation model of traffic and explains how to accurately model WWW-traffic by autocorrelation functions. The verifications with the data of real WWW-traffic show the WWW-traffic can be well modeled by the correlation model discussed...|$|R

25|$|Windows Vista {{includes}} a specialized QoS API called qWave (Quality Windows Audio/Video Experience), {{which is a}} pre-configured Quality of Service module for time dependent <b>multimedia</b> <b>data,</b> such as audio or video streams. qWave uses different packet priority schemes for real-time flows (such as multimedia packets) and best-effort flows (such as file downloads or e-mails) to ensure that real time data gets as little delays as possible, while providing a high quality channel for other data packets.|$|E
25|$|Although Windows Driver Model (WDM) was {{available}} starting with Windows 98, few audio card manufacturers used it. Due to internal buffering, KMixer introduced significant processing latency (30 ms on then-current systems). Windows 98 {{also includes a}} WDM streaming class driver (Stream.sys) to address these real time <b>multimedia</b> <b>data</b> stream processing requirements. When the sound card uses a custom driver for use with the system supplied port class driver PortCls.sys or implements a mini-driver for use with the streaming class driver, applications can bypass the KMixer completely and use the kernel streaming interfaces instead to reduce latency.|$|E

40|$|It is {{well known}} that cloud {{computing}} has many potential advantages over traditional distributed systems. Many enterprises can build their own private cloud with open source infrastructure as a service (IaaS) frameworks. Since enterprise applications and data are migrating to private cloud, the performance of cloud computing environments is of utmost importance for both cloud providers and users. To improve the performance, previous studies on cloud consolidation have been focused on live migration of virtual machines based on resource utilization. However, the approaches are not suitable for <b>multimedia</b> big <b>data</b> applications. In this paper, we reveal the performance bottleneck of <b>multimedia</b> big <b>data</b> applications in cloud computing environments and propose a cloud consolidation algorithm that considers application types.
