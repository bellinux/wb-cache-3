25|$|While Jan Ingenhousz {{described}} the irregular motion of coal dust particles {{on the surface}} of alcohol in 1785, the discovery of this phenomenon is often credited to the botanist Robert Brown in 1827. Brown was studying pollen grains of the plant Clarkia pulchella suspended in water under a microscope when he observed <b>minute</b> <b>particles,</b> ejected by the pollen grains, executing a jittery motion. By repeating the experiment with particles of inorganic matter he was able to rule out that the motion was life-related, although its origin was yet to be explained.|$|E
25|$|Fatio {{assumed that}} the {{universe}} is filled with <b>minute</b> <b>particles,</b> which are moving indiscriminately with very high speed and rectilinearly in all directions. To illustrate his thoughts he used the following example: Suppose an object C, on which an infinite small plane zz and a sphere centered about zz is drawn. Into this sphere Fatio placed the pyramid PzzQ, in which some particles are streaming in the direction of zz and also some particles, which were already reflected by C and therefore depart from zz. Fatio proposed that the mean velocity of the reflected particles is lower and therefore their momentum is weaker than that of the incident particles. The result is one stream, which pushes all bodies in the direction of zz. So on one hand the speed of the stream remains constant, {{but on the other hand}} at larger proximity to zz the density of the stream increases and therefore its intensity is proportional to 1/r2. And because one can draw an infinite number of such pyramids around C, the proportionality applies to the entire range around C.|$|E
500|$|In March 2009, the FBI {{disclosed}} that Tom Kaye, a paleontologist from the Burke Museum of Natural History and Culture in Seattle, had assembled {{a team of}} [...] "citizen sleuths", including scientific illustrator Carol Abraczinskas and metallurgist Alan Stone. The group, eventually known as the Cooper Research Team, reinvestigated important components of the case using GPS, satellite imagery, and other technologies unavailable in 1971. While little new information was gained regarding the buried ransom money or Cooper's landing zone, {{they were able to}} find and analyze hundreds of <b>minute</b> <b>particles</b> on Cooper's tie using electron microscopy.

2500|$|In {{the central}} and north range, the {{limestone}} is recognized to have distinct {{the upper and lower}} beds, long known as Top Ledge and Bottom Ledge, which commonly part when weathered. [...] This boundary between the upper and lower Cottonwood is evidenced by a sharp textural contrast, porosity difference, and changes in the opaque mineral content. [...] In this range, the whole member is fine-grained limestone, but the Top Ledge has a yellower tint or a creamy gray with open grain while the Bottom Ledge is whiter with tight grain. [...] With respect to fossil content, the upper weathering bed is characterized by the abundant Fusulinid assemblage, while the lower bed is composed of <b>minute</b> <b>particles</b> of various fragmented fossils, especially Osagia, echinoderms, and bryozoans.|$|E
2500|$|The {{elemental}} {{system used}} in medieval alchemy also originated with Jabir. His original system consisted of seven elements, {{which included the}} five classical elements (aether, air, earth, fire, and water) in addition to two chemical elements representing the metals: sulphur, [...] "the stone which burns", which characterized the principle of combustibility, and mercury, which contained the idealized principle of metallic properties. Shortly thereafter, this evolved into eight elements, with the Arabic concept of the three metallic principles: sulphur giving flammability or combustion, mercury giving volatility and stability, and salt giving solidity. The atomic theory of corpuscularianism, where all physical bodies possess an inner and outer layer of <b>minute</b> <b>particles</b> or corpuscles, also has its origins {{in the work of}} Jabir.|$|E
2500|$|When {{the case}} reached the High Court on 16 February 2009, {{involving}} 18 {{families and the}} culmination of a ten-year legal process, evidence was put forward describing how, between 1985 and 1997, there existed a possibility that expectant mothers could have been affected by toxic waste which could either have travelled by air as a consequence of dust, or could have been ingested after landing on vegetables or other items. The area was constantly coated with a thick, red dust, including an open air market selling vegetables and other produce. The vehicles were uncovered, and there was no adherence to procedures such as the wheel washing of the vehicles. David Wilby, QC, leading counsel for the claimants, stated in court that one expert, in trying to convey the appearance of the <b>minute</b> <b>particles</b> hanging over the town at that time, had described it as an [...] "atmospheric soup of toxic materials". Some of the open-backed lorries transported so-called 'wet waste', containing dioxins and heavy metals such as cadmium, lead and chromium.|$|E

50|$|Most {{philosophical}} {{schools in}} Hinduism maintain that material creation started with some <b>minute</b> <b>particle</b> (or seed) {{which had to}} be co-eternal or a part of ultimate reality (Brahman). This minute starting point is also the point into which all creation contracts {{at the end of each}} cycle. This concept varies between various traditions, such as the Vishishtadvaita tradition (which asserts that the Universe forms a part of God, created from some aspect of His divinity) and Tamil Shaiva Siddhanta traditions (which state that the <b>minute</b> initial <b>particle</b> (shuddha Maya) has always existed and was never created).|$|R
60|$|<b>Minute</b> <b>particles</b> of the {{carbonate}} {{were added}} to the secretion surrounding several glands. These instantly became black and secreted copiously; but, except in two instances, when extremely <b>minute</b> <b>particles</b> were given, there was no inflection. This result is analogous to that which follows from the immersion of leaves in a strong solution of one part of the carbonate to 109, or 146, or even 218 of water, for the leaves are then paralysed and no inflection ensues, though the glands are blackened, and the protoplasm in the cells of the tentacles undergoes strong aggregation.|$|E

60|$|Ideas being thus {{distinguished}} and understood, {{we may be}} able to give {{an account}} how the same water, at the same time, may produce the idea of cold by one hand and of heat by the other: whereas it is impossible that the same water, if those ideas were really in it, should at the same time be both hot and cold. For, if we imagine WARMTH, as it is in our hands, to be nothing but a certain sort and degree of motion in the <b>minute</b> <b>particles</b> of our nerves or animal spirits, we may understand how it is possible that the same water may, at the same time, produce the sensations of heat in one hand and cold in the other; which yet FIGURE never does, that never producing the idea of a square by one hand which has produced the idea of a globe by another. But if the sensation of heat and cold be nothing but the increase or diminution of the motion of the minute parts of our bodies, caused by the corpuscles of any other body, it is easy to be understood, that if that motion be greater in one hand than in the other; if a body be applied to the two hands, which has in its <b>minute</b> <b>particles</b> a greater motion than in those of one of the hands, and a less than in those of the other, it will increase the motion of the one hand and lessen it in the other; and so cause the different sensations of heat and cold that depend thereon.|$|E
