40|$|The {{proliferation}} of <b>mixed</b> <b>electoral</b> <b>systems</b> {{across the globe}} has spawned a growing literature assessing how these rules affect the behavior of political actors at the micro-level and partisan competition at the macro-level.

Despite our increased access to data from the expansion of <b>mixed</b> <b>electoral</b> <b>systems</b> and the conduct of multiple elections using these rules, our ability to draw inferences about their consequences is still constrained. Although Germany has held many elections under its <b>mixed</b> <b>electoral</b> rules, most other countries using mixed systems have conducted four or fewer elections. Moreover, institutional rules vary substantially across mixed systems and many countries have modified their rules over time. Thus, isolating the effects that <b>mixed</b> <b>electoral</b> rules exert, relative to other causal factors, is complicated by their relative newness, profound cross-national variation and longitudinal variability...|$|R

40|$|This work {{provides}} a parametric and semi-parametric {{analysis of the}} relationship between the proportionality degree of an <b>electoral</b> <b>system</b> and corruption. This allows us to properly consider <b>mixed</b> <b>electoral</b> <b>systems</b> alongside the two traditional ones, proportional and plurality. Results show that a reduction in the proportionality degree within the same proportional system is not beneficial in fighting corruption because it weakens the monitoring power of opponents (their representativeness reduces) without the introduction of the voters’ monitoring. On the contrary, mixed rules allow both monitors to exercise their power to induce politicians to avoid corrupt behaviour. Increasing plurality elements into mixed systems is beneficial only up to certain proportionality degrees, after which the corresponding level of corruption begins to grow. Therefore, for governors who want to adopt <b>mixed</b> <b>electoral</b> <b>systems,</b> the choice of their proportionality degree becomes fundamental. ...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a comprehensive {{picture of the}} Italian political <b>system</b> under <b>mixed</b> <b>electoral</b> rules, between 1996 and 2001. It addresses how a <b>mixed</b> member majoritarian <b>electoral</b> <b>system</b> affects the incentive structure of parties, voters and legislators, which in turn affect political and social outcomes. The thesis consequently investigates three related phenomena which were not necessarily considered by the drafters of the reform; namely pre-electoral bargaining, split-ticket voting, and the link between dual candidacy and legislative behaviour. First, the thesis addresses pre-electoral coalition bargaining, investigating the role that parties' policy positions play as a 'threat' resource. Second, the thesis investigates the impact of candidates' policy positions, among other variables, on the tendency of voters to split their ticket. Finally, the thesis addresses how indicators of electoral path, such as the opportunity of MPs to run simultaneously in both proportional and majoritarian tiers, affect legislative behaviour. The research develops new theoretical insights, analyses new empirical data, and applies innovative methodological tools. Not only does the thesis {{shed light on the}} logic underlying these three intriguing phenomena, but also contributes to our understanding of <b>mixed</b> <b>electoral</b> <b>systems.</b> Specifically, by investigating the incentive structures of parties, voters and legislators under mixed rules, the thesis re{{presents a}}n important contribution to contamination theory. The results support the argument that <b>mixed</b> <b>electoral</b> <b>systems</b> are not merely the sum of their proportional and majoritarian elements, but instead constitute a new and distinct hybrid system...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Although it {{is widely}} {{acknowledged}} that elections can be error-prone enterprises, few scholars have attempted to assess distortions in election results due to fraud. Yet, the consequences of electoral manipulation can be serious. If elections {{are perceived to be}} substantially compromised by vote theft, regime legitimacy can be undermined. This paper develops a set of general expectations about fraud derived from the existing literature. It employs precinct-level data from Ukraine's 2002 parliamentary elections to evaluate the hypotheses, benefiting from the unique features of <b>mixed</b> <b>electoral</b> <b>systems.</b> The results of tests are consistent with the presence of fraud even when controls are added for rival hypotheses. ...|$|R

40|$|The article {{proposes a}} new way to combine the “proportional” and “majoritarian” visions of democracy. The {{proposal}} blends elements of <b>mixed</b> <b>electoral</b> <b>systems,</b> parliamentarism, presidentialism and bicameralism. Voters are given a single vote to make two simultaneous choices: one about the proportional composition of the legislature and one about the two top parties forming a majoritarian “confidence chamber” embedded within the legislature. Only the majority in this chamber has the power to dismiss the cabinet in a vote of no-confidence. The proposed system virtually guarantees the feasibility of identifiable and stable one-party cabinets governing with shifting, issue-specific majorities in a highly proportional legislature. It is illustrated with respect to the 2013 federal election in Germany...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we study a {{coordination}} dilemma {{that appears in}} democracies where the Upper and Lower Houses are elected simultaneously using significantly different rules.

Using the case of Spain, where all the possible incentive structures for electoral coordination are present, we test both theories. Our results point out that contamination effects matter, but they are not strong enough to make Duvergerian gravity disappear. Both effects are at play in Spanish elections. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

We estimate a non-linear relationship between the Gallagher proportionality index and the per capita GDP growth using cross-country panel data. Our findings show that the proportionality degree is significant for growth; mixed systems (characterised by an intermediate level of proportionality), combining the different advantages of both proportional and plurality systems, solve the problem of the accountability-responsiveness and the political-government instability trade-offs.
