Following an eight-year legal battle conducted by lawyer Barry Swadron QC, on behalf of Doug Bell, a resident of North York who {{had been charged with}} living with other people to whom he was not related, the Supreme Court of Canada upheld Greene's position and struck down the <b>municipal</b> <b>bylaw</b> in April 1979.|$|E
25|$|The City of Yellowknife Municipal Enforcement Division (MED) is {{responsible}} for <b>municipal</b> <b>bylaw</b> infractions and traffic infractions (within city limits). The Yellowknife Fire Department handles the city's fire, ambulance, rescue, and hazardous materials responses. A point of debate {{in recent years has}} been the implementation of 911 services in Yellowknife (currently one must dial one of two local numbers) through a partnership with five other Northwest Territories communities; the cost of installation is currently estimated at around $1 million a year. There have been a number of incidents where emergency services have been either misdirected, or improperly dispatched. Health services are provided through the local Stanton Territorial Hospital. The Yellowknife Primary Care Centre has a broad range of practitioners including physicians, nurse practitioners, nurses, counsellors, dietitians and more. Services provided at the Yellowknife Primary Care Centre include mental health, diabetes education, diagnostic imaging, psychiatry and some home care services.|$|E

2500|$|Greene {{was first}} elected to the North York City Council in December 1972, winning a {{position}} on the city's Board of Control. [...] The position gave her an automatic seat on the Metropolitan Toronto Council. [...] Greene's first campaign was centred primarily around a zoning issue: she opposed a <b>municipal</b> <b>bylaw</b> restricting cohabitation by people unless they were related or one person was an owner (she and her female housemates had been threatened with eviction under the terms of this bylaw). [...] Greene also argued that she would speak for the rights of women, single persons, tenants and salaried workers. [...] One of the first issues she was involved in was the Ambulance service. She fought a [...] "one woman war" [...] which resulted in the amalgamation of ambulances services in Metropolitan Toronto and the establishment of the Toronto Ambulance Service.|$|E

50|$|In the Canadian {{province}} of Alberta, municipalities can appoint bylaw enforcements officers {{under the authority}} of section 555 and 556 of the Municipal Government Act. There is a common misconception that all bylaw officers are community peace officers. However, a person appointed as a community peace officer can only enforce provincial acts and regulations. A community peace officer is not authorized to enforce <b>municipal</b> <b>bylaws</b> unless they are also appointed {{under the authority of}} the Municipal Government Act, or if the specific bylaw states it can be enforced by a community peace officer working for that municipality. There are a number of municipalities in Alberta whose officers enforce only <b>municipal</b> <b>bylaws</b> as bylaw officers, others that only enforce provincial acts as community peace officers, and others that hold dual municipal and provincial appointments.|$|R

50|$|The National Plumbing Code {{permits the}} {{collection}} of rainwater for non-portable toilet flushing and outdoor irrigation throughout Canada. The right to harvest and use rainwater {{is determined by the}} provincial government and <b>municipal</b> <b>bylaws.</b> However, a majority of the provinces lack any significant legislation. The law of capture is not well defined and it varies for residential and non-domestic uses. When building a rainwater storage system, it is required that the design follows closely to the provincial codes and <b>municipal</b> <b>bylaws.</b> Multiple publications and reports have been developed by the Canadian Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC) in order to aid Canadians in designing and installing rainwater capture systems that comply with these codes, regulations and bylaws.|$|R

After parents filed a legal action to have the bylaw overturned, the Council suspended application of the bylaw.|$|E

40|$|While much {{is known}} about the impact of law and public policy, we know {{considerably}} less about their antecedents. Theories of policy adoption suggest that a variety of policy inputs help to shape legislative change. This research considers the enactment of <b>municipal</b> smoking <b>bylaws</b> in Canada between 1970 and 1995. The emergence of second-hand smoke (SHS) has been offered as a viable explanation for the increased enactment of local smoking restrictions. A number of indicators confirm the rising public health concern around SHS. Using Health Canada data on <b>municipal</b> smoking <b>bylaw</b> enactment in Canada, this paper employs an event history analysis to trace the role of four indicators of the increased recognition of SHS as a public health concern [...] scientific research, parliamentary debate, print media, and health advocacy. Findings indicate that the print media and health advocacy play the strongest role in explaining the increase in the adoption of <b>municipal</b> smoking <b>bylaws</b> in Canada. Results lend support to the quantitative study of the policy adoption process and to theories of policy making that consider multiple influences on policy adoption.

50|$|In {{some areas}} of Canada, {{particularly}} in Atlantic Canada and parts of Northern Ontario, most retailers are prohibited from opening on Boxing Day, either by provincial law or by <b>municipal</b> <b>bylaw,</b> or instead by informal agreement among major retailers to provide a day of relaxation following Christmas Day. In these areas, sales otherwise scheduled for 26 December are moved to the 27th. The city council of Greater Sudbury, Ontario, which was the largest city in Canada to maintain this restriction as of the early 2010s, formally repealed its store hours bylaw on 9 December 2014.|$|E
50|$|Sault Ste.

Retail stores in Sault Ste. Marie begin their post-Christmas Boxing Day sales on December 27. A municipal referendum to determine whether voters favour allowing stores to open on Boxing Day was held concurrently with the 2010 municipal election. Voter turnout was not high enough to make the referendum legally binding, but 60.77 per cent of voters opposed allowing stores to open on the holiday.|$|E
50|$|A {{municipal}} referendum {{to determine whether}} voters favoured allowing stores to open on Boxing Day was held concurrently with the election. Sault Ste.

Marie instead begin their post-Christmas Boxing Day sales on December 27. Although voter turnout was not high enough to make the referendum legally binding, meaning that city council is free to disregard the results if it chooses to revisit the issue in the future, 60.77 per cent of voters opposed allowing stores to open.|$|E
50|$|Within its {{jurisdiction}} {{and specific}} to those areas {{mandated by the}} higher body, a municipal by-law {{is no different than}} any other law of the land, and can be enforced with penalties, challenged in court and must comply with other laws of the land, such as the country's constitution. <b>Municipal</b> <b>bylaws</b> are often enforcable through the public justice system, and offenders can be charged with a criminal offence for breach of a bylaw. Common bylaws include vehicle parking and stopping regulations, animal control, building and construction, licensing, noise, zoning and business regulation, and management of public recreation areas.|$|R

50|$|Municipalities {{are under}} {{ever-increasing}} pressure {{to provide services}} quickly and cheaply, and many city governments see bylaw officers as attractive cheap alternatives to police for enforcement of non-criminal or less serious issues. As well, police departments themselves are under increased pressures in everything from staffing and finances, to the requirement to conduct police work within an increasingly complex legal framework brought about by increased litigiousness in society and more onerous limits & guidelines imposed on the police {{in order to protect}} individual rights and freedoms. As such, police departments are frequently unable or unwilling to perform duties related to the enforcement of non-criminal statutes or <b>municipal</b> <b>bylaws.</b>|$|R
