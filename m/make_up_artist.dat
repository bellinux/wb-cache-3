500|$|For {{the role}} of Kancha, the antagonist, Sanjay Dutt was cast. According to Malhotra, the script of Agneepath demanded that the villain be more {{powerful}} than the hero, and due to Dutt's bulky frame, he was considered perfect for the role. The character of Kancha demanded that Dutt go bald, but due to a prior commitment to the film Son of Sardar, which was being shot simultaneously, he could not do so for the sake of continuity. Therefore, Hollywood <b>make</b> <b>up</b> <b>artist</b> Robin Slater created a [...] "bald" [...] look for Dutt, with the use of prosthetics. However, due to the summer heat in Diu, the make-up would eventually drip down Dutt's face, which impelled him to finally shave his head. Director Malhotra admitted to being inspired by Marlon Brando's bald look in the film Apocalypse Now (1979) while designing Dutt's character. Dutt explained his look by saying, [...] "Kancha is suffering from an ailment that leaves him hairless. I shaved my head for the role, not once but twice, and the eye-brows and eye-lashes have been digitally removed." [...] Furthermore, Dutt worked out in the gym twice a day in order to bulk up for the role.|$|E
