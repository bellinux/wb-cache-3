5|$|State Route 139 (SR 139) is a {{state highway}} in the U.S. state of California. Running from SR 36 in Susanville north to Oregon Route 39, it forms part of the {{shortest}} route between Reno, Nevada, and Klamath Falls, Oregon. SR 139 cuts through much <b>Modoc</b> National Forest and passes near Antelope Mountain and Tule Lake. North of SR 299, the highway was built {{by the federal government}} and turned over to the state in about 1940; the remainder was built by a joint highway district of Lassen and <b>Modoc</b> Counties, completed in 1956, and given to the state in 1959.|$|E
5|$|Grant's {{policy had}} greater {{success in the}} Southwest. General Oliver Otis Howard {{negotiated}} peace with the Apache in 1872, convincing their leader, Cochise, to move the tribe to a new reservation, and ending a war started the year before. In Oregon, relations were less peaceful, as war with the Modocs erupted in April 1873. The Modocs refused {{to move to a}} reservation and killed the local army commander, Major General Edward Canby. Grant ordered restraint after Canby's death, disregarding Sherman's advice to seek revenge or exterminate the tribe. The army captured, tried, and executed the four <b>Modoc</b> warriors responsible for Canby's murder, and Grant ordered the rest of the <b>Modoc</b> tribe relocated to the Indian Territory. In 1874, the army defeated the Comanche Indians at the Battle of Palo Duro Canyon. Their villages were burned and horses slaughtered, eventually forcing them to finally settle at the Fort Sill reservation in 1875. Grant pocket-vetoed a bill in 1874 protecting bison and supporting Interior Secretary Columbus Delano, who believed the killing of bison would force Plains Indians to abandon their nomadic lifestyle.|$|E

5|$|The {{route of}} US395 in California is {{split into two}} segments, as the highway exits and reenters California via Nevada.

5|$|Lassen and <b>Modoc</b> Counties {{organized}} Joint Highway District No. 14 on December 21, 1929 {{to construct}} and maintain a road from Susanville via Adin to Oregon. However, since the state took over the part north of Adin, the district's scope was narrowed to Susanville-Adin. It finally completed work in 1956, and held a ceremony on August 26, in which it placed a monument at a point near Eagle Lake. The legislature added {{the road to the}} state highway system as Route 216 in 1959. The portion south of Horse Lake Road became an extension of Route 20 instead; this route from Susanville to Ravendale (later Termo) was never constructed by the state, and was deleted from SR 36 in 1998. Also in 1959, a spur of Route 210 west to Dorris was added; this became SR 161 in 1964.|$|E
5|$|State Route 139 {{begins at}} SR 36 in Susanville, and heads {{northeast}} up Antelope Mountain {{along the eastern}} edge of Susanville Ranch Park before turning north and descending into the Eagle Lake Basin, passing along {{the eastern edge of}} Eagle Lake and later the Said Valley Reservoir. The highway continues north and northwest through valleys and over hills and through a part of the <b>Modoc</b> National Forest, through the community of Avila Place, and then enters the east end of the Big Valley, where it begins to overlap SR 299 through Adin. The combined routes continue northerly through another part of the forest and over Adin Pass into the Warm Springs Valley, where SR 139 splits to the northwest near Canby.|$|E

25|$|There {{are several}} legends {{to how the}} town of <b>Modoc</b> got its name. One of them said that a man {{travelling}} on the train threw out a cigar box containing the name <b>Modoc,</b> and that Henry Conley, {{one of the first}} settlers of the town, picked it up and suggested to bystanders {{that it would be a}} good name for the town. Another theory is that <b>Modoc</b> was named after the <b>Modoc</b> people who were traditionally located in northern California. They became noted for their resistance to the US Army during the <b>Modoc</b> War, ending in 1873.|$|E
25|$|The {{defeat of}} the Army at the First Battle of the Stronghold {{strengthened}} the <b>Modoc</b> position. The United States began peace negotiations {{from a position of}} weakness.

25|$|The US lost 37 men {{killed or}} wounded; the <b>Modoc</b> {{suffered}} no casualties. Given the fog and rock cover, no Army survivors reported having seen a <b>Modoc</b> during the battle.

500|$|In January 1873, Grant's Native American peace {{policy was}} challenged. Two weeks after Grant was elected {{for a second}} term, {{fighting}} broke out between the <b>Modocs</b> and settlers near the California-Oregon border. The <b>Modocs,</b> led by Captain Jack, killed 18 white settlers and then found a strong defensive position. Grant ordered General Sherman not to attack the Indians but settle matters peacefully with a commission. S6herman then sent Major General Edward Canby, but Captain Jack killed him. Reverend Eleazar Thomas, a Methodist minister, was also killed. Alfred B. Meacham, an Indian Agent, was severely wounded. [...] The murders shocked the nation, and Sherman wired to have the <b>Modocs</b> exterminated. Grant overruled Sherman; Captain Jack was executed, and the remaining 155 <b>Modocs</b> were relocated to the Quapaw Agency in the Indian Territory. This episode and the Great Sioux War undermined public confidence in Grant's peace policy, according to historian Robert M. Utley.|$|R
25|$|The US Army forces {{tried to}} {{dislodge}} the <b>Modoc</b> {{from the natural}} fortress, now called Captain Jack's Stronghold, in the lava beds along the south shore of Tule Lake in northeastern California. They had illegally left the Klamath Reservation in Oregon, to {{which they had been}} relocated from their territory in order to enable European Americans to settle in the area. The <b>Modoc</b> soundly defeated the Army, inflicting numerous casualties and forcing it to retreat. Factors aiding the <b>Modoc</b> included their excellent defensive position, steady patience, and a thick fog that obscured portions of the battlefield.|$|E
