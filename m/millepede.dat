40|$|The Alignment of the CMS tracker {{will require}} to {{determine}} about 10 ^ 5 alignment parameters. The <b>Millepede</b> program, a linear least-squares algorithm, is a promising candidate for this task, having been used successfully for alignment in several experiments. However, {{due to the}} inversion of a large matrix of linear equations, <b>Millepede</b> in its original form was limited to problems with about 10000 parameters. A {{new version of the}} program, <b>Millepede</b> II, provides an iterative method to determine the solution of the matrix, which should work for systems with 100000 parameters, if the matrix is sparse. This method is tested within the CMS object oriented reconstruction framework (ORCA). Its precision and CPU needs are studied and compared to the inversion method, using alignment scenarios of the CMS tracker with currently up to 12000 parameters...|$|E

Instead of rats and mice there are curious little marsupial animals about the same size, which run about at night and nibble anything eatable that may be left uncovered. Four or five different kinds of ants attack everything not isolated by water, and one kind even swims across that; great spiders lurk in baskets and boxes, or hide {{in the folds of}} my mosquito curtain; centipedes and <b>millepedes</b> are found everywhere. I have caught them under my pillow and on my bead; while in every box, and under every hoard which has lain for some days undisturbed, little scorpions are sure to be found snugly ensconced, with their formidable tails quickly turned up ready for attack or defence. Such companions seem very alarming and dangerous, but all combined are not so bad as the irritation of mosquitoes, or of the insect pests often found at home. These latter are a constant and unceasing source of torment and disgust, whereas you may live a long time among scorpions, spiders, and centipedes, ugly and venomous though they are, and get no harm from them.

40|$|This work {{uses the}} <b>Millepede</b> linear {{alignment}} method, {{which is essentially}} a $chi^ 2 $ minimization algorithm, to determine simultaneously between 76 and 476 alignment parameters and several million track parameters. For the case of non-linear alignment models, <b>Millepede</b> is embedded in a Newton-Raphson iterative procedure. If needed a more robust approach is provided by adding quasi-Newton steps which minimize the approximate $chi^ 2 $ model function. The alignment apparatus is applied to locally align the LHCb's Inner Tracker sensors in an a priori fixed system of coordinate. An analytic measurement model was derived as function of track parameters and alignment parameters, for the two cases: null and non-null magnetic field. The alignment problem is equivalent to solving a linear system of equations, and usually a matrix inversion is required. In general, as consequence of global degrees of freedom or poorly constrained modes, the alignment matrix is singular or near-singular. The global degrees of freedom are obtained: directly from $chi^ 2 $ function invariant transformations, and in parallel by an alignment matrix diagonalization followed by an extraction of the least constrained modes. The procedure allows to properly define the local alignment of the Inner Tracker. Using Monte Carlo data, the outlined procedure reconstructs {{the position of the}} IT sensors within micrometer precision or better. For rotations equivalent precision was obtained...|$|E

5000|$|The {{book has}} been {{controversial}} at the national level. On its publication, two major scientists praised it. Botanist G. Ledyard Stebbins, a co-founder of the neo-Darwinian evolutionary paradigm, called it [...] "A classic of natural history that will take its place alongside Walden and A Sand County Almanac." [...] Zoologist George Schaller called it [...] "a marvelous book, {{one of the finest}} nature essays I have read, beautifully written, full of stimulating ideas and insights." [...] On the other hand, some readers found its synthesis of biology with folklore and philosophy disturbing. A March 20, 1983, review in the New York Times Book Review by then NYT reporter Clifford May manifested this view. While praising the book's natural history content, it accused Wallace of playing [...] "fast and loose" [...] with concepts like evolution and mythology [...] "in a grab for cosmic significance" [...] and of sinking [...] "quickly and deeply into a mire of pretension" [...] with [...] "attempts to alchemize science into poetry." [...] Most reviews were more favorable. The Atlantic Monthly(February, 1983) wrote: [...] "Mr. Wallace, rambling observantly about the area, has found functioning examples evolution from all the earth's history, which he describes with authority, charm, and a discreet touch of imagination." [...] The Wall Street Journal (2/14/83) wrote: [...] "He is very persuasive and writes beautifully of the contrasting forest levels of these wildly tumbled mountains, from rain forest to snow forest and red rock... {{in the tradition of the}} lyrical, literary description naturalists..." [...] The Washington Post (3/13/83) wrote that evolution [...] "frees us, Wallace says, from the older notion that earth and man were created at the caprice of violent gods, and doomed to repeat that violence. Instead, we are part of an open-ended process-- from algae to man, by way of trees and <b>millepedes,</b> and back again." ...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2004 The {{process of}} {{silvicultural}} thinning {{has become very}} controversial recently with regards to fire protection and management for old-growth conditions and biodiversity. Therefore, an unthinned control stand and 3 different thinning intensities were examined for their effects on the abundance, species richness, and diversity of arthropods in thinning treatments of silvicultural practices. Study sites were 40 - 50 year-old young stands of typical plantation Douglas-fir forests in the Willamette National Forest, Oregon. Shrub-, ground-, and litter-dwelling arthropods were collected with a bagging technique, pitfall traps, and Berlese extraction during 2000 and 2001. Abundance of shrub-dwelling arthropods decreased with the thinning intensity for deciduous foliage, but did not show any response for conifer foliage. Species richness and diversity of shrub-dwelling arthropods showed higher values in the conifer foliage types. Functional group composition for the two foliage types revealed consistently different proportions; the deciduous foliage type had {{a higher proportion of}} plant suckers and the conifer foliage type had higher proportion of predators and detritivores. NMS ordination (Non-metric Multidimensional Scaling) showed a very distinct difference between the species inhabiting the two contrasting foliage types. Abundance and diversity of ground-dwelling arthropods were higher in Heavy Thin and Light Thin with Gap treatments than the Control and Light Thinning treatments. Five groups of arthropods with relatively high abundance (such as Formicidae (ants), Araneae (spiders), Carabidae (ground-beetles), Gryllacrididae (camel-crickets), and Polydesmida (<b>millepedes))</b> permitted in depth analysis. Four groups (i. e., ants, spiders, camel-crickets, and millipedes) were more abundant in the more intense thinning treatment areas. However, the abundance of Carabidae (ground-beetles), the third most abundant group, was higher at the unthinned control than in any thinning treatments; densities were much higher during the wet season than dry season. NMS ordination showed that seasonal effects outweighed the thinning effects. Though the disturbance associated with thinning would be expected to decrease populations and density of fauna, I hypothesize that the principal effect of the thinning disturbance was to increase habitat heterogeneity and subsequently species richness. Abundance of litter-dwelling arthropods decreased in proportion to the thinning treatments. The litter-dwelling fauna was primarily correlated with seasonal moisture and secondarily positively correlated with thinning intensity. The proportion of predators decreased with the advancing seasons...|$|R
6000|$|And as the {{sun rose}} higher and higher, a great stillness fell upon the forest. The jaguars and the monkeys had hidden {{themselves}} in the darkest depths of the woods. The birds' notes died out one by one; the very butterflies ceased their flitting over the tree-tops, and slept with outspread wings upon the glossy leaves, undistinguishable from the flowers around them. Now and then a colibri whirred downward toward the water, hummed for a moment around some pendent flower, and then the living gem was lost in the deep blackness of the inner wood, among tree-trunks as huge and dark as the pillars of some Hindoo shrine; or a parrot swung and screamed at them from an overhanging bough; or a thirsty monkey slid lazily down a liana {{to the surface of the}} stream, dipped up the water in his tiny hand, and started chattering back, as his eyes met those of some foul alligator peering upward through the clear depths below. In shaded nooks beneath the boughs, the capybaras, rabbits as large as sheep, went paddling sleepily round and round, thrusting up their unwieldy heads among the blooms of the blue water-lilies; while black and purple water-hens ran up and down upon the rafts of floating leaves. The shining snout of a freshwater dolphin rose slowly to the surface; a jet of spray whirred up; a rainbow hung upon it for a moment; and the black snout sank lazily again. Here and there, too, upon some shallow pebbly shore, scarlet flamingoes stood dreaming knee-deep, on one leg; crested cranes pranced up and down, admiring their own finery; and ibises and egrets dipped their bills under water in search of prey: but before noon even those had slipped away, and there reigned a stillness which might be heard--such a stillness (to compare small things with great) as broods beneath the rich shadows of Amyas's own Devon woods, or among the lonely sweeps of Exmoor, when the heather is in flower--a stillness in which, as Humboldt says, [...] "If beyond the silence we listen for the faintest undertones, we detect a stifled, continuous hum of insects, which crowd the air close to the earth; a confused swarming murmur which hangs round every bush, in the cracked bark of trees, in the soil undermined by lizards, <b>millepedes,</b> and bees; a voice proclaiming to us that all Nature breathes, that under a thousand different forms life swarms in the gaping and dusty earth, as much as in the bosom of the waters, and the air which breathes around." ...|$|R

40|$|Project Specification <b>Millepede</b> is a multi-threaded {{detector}} alignment and calibration software {{based on}} the Linear Least Squares Fit algorithm for fitting {{a large number of}} parameters (5 M+). Developed at DESY, the application is used in many HEP sites, including CERN. Due to computational and memory complexity, the application uses an in-house principle of submatrix partitioning. While {{this is the way to}} make the computation feasible, it is not possible to deliver uncertainty for every estimated parameter. The project concerns characterizing the application in terms of parallelization efficiency, including the multi-threading and vectorization aspects. The project was also ported to Intel Xeon Phi, which allowed conducting a performance comparison between Xeon and Xeon Phi. Abstract Optimization of a scientific application is not an easy task. It requires a broad knowledge and following a multiple-step methodology. In this work we have characterized and optimized a detector alignment software called <b>Millepede</b> II. We have focused on different performance levels: vectorization, parallelism, memory distribution. Also, the software was ported to Xeon Phi. For the characterization of the application we have used several tools including Intel Advisor and Intel VTune Amplifier. In this paper we show that there is some room for optimization without introducing massive modifications to the code. We obtain a speed-up of 15 % by introducing changes in the code to ease the vectorization and by choosing the right scheduling for each parallel section of the code. Finally, we run the software on Xeon Phi, obtaining not satisfactory results due to the lack of adaptation of the software to the card’s hardware...|$|E

40|$|Studies were {{conducted}} in five districts of Burkina Faso, West Africa from November to December, 1996. The objectives aimed at establishing spatial distribution and quantifying the level of damages on peanut pods by soil arthropods, termites and millepedes. Twenty seven samples of 100 pods each were taken from farmers' stocks in each district, which made a total of 135 pod samples examined. Damage was determined in each district by counting scarified pods by termites and perforated pods by millepedes and converting obtained numbers in percents. Results show that termites and millepedes cause damages throughout the five districts, with termites causing damages, as high as 30 - 40 % in some districts, compared to damages caused by millepedes which rarely exceeded 3 %. While damage degrees by termites were found to vary with districts, distribution of <b>millepede</b> damages was fairly uniform throughout the study area. The observed differential distribution of termite damages {{is thought to be}} due to farmers growing susceptible varieties in eastern districts, varieties such as Te 3, proven to be highly susceptible to termites. Neither peanut pod weight, nor grain weight was significantly correlated with damages by termites and millepedes. However, it is highly likely that damages by the two soil arthropods increase grain contamination by the known carcinogenic substance, aflatoxin, by allowing pod penetration and grain invasion by the aflatoxin-producing fungus, Aspergillus sp. This suggests that there is an urgent need for efficient control methods to be developed and applied, not only to reduce peanut yield loss, but also to help preserve human health. One of these methods could be the use by local farmers of resistant varieties which have been shown by several authors to be efficient against termites and millepedes.
