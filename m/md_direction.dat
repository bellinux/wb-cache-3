40|$|Objective:  To {{develop a}} method to quickly {{estimate}} the location of center of resistance (CR) in mesial-distal (MD) and buccal-lingual (BL) directions from the tooth's image. Materials and Methods:  The maxillary cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) scans of 18 patients were used. Finite element (FE) models of the canines and their surrounding tissues were built based on their CBCT scans to calculate the locations of CR. Root length, centroid of the contact surface (CCS), and centroid of projection of the contact surface (CPCS) were also obtained from the images. The CCS and CPCS locations were projected on the tooth's long axis, which were represented as percentages of the root length measured from the root's apex. Results:  Using the FE results as the standards, the errors of using CCS or CPCS to estimate CR were calculated. The average location of CR calculated using the FE method was 60. 2 % measured from the root’s apex in the <b>MD</b> <b>direction</b> and 58. 4 % in the BL direction. The location of the CCS was 60. 9 %. The difference in CR was 0. 7 % in the <b>MD</b> <b>direction</b> and 2. 5 % in the BL direction. The location of CPCS was 60. 2 % in the <b>MD</b> <b>direction</b> and 59. 1 % in the BL direction, {{which resulted in a}} 0. 1 % and 0. 8 % difference with the reference CR, respectively. The average difference of CR in the MD and BL directions was small but statistically significant (P <. 05). Conclusion:  The locations of the CR of a human canine in the MD and BL directions can be estimated by finding the CPCSs in those directions...|$|E
40|$|On-line {{measurement}} of material properties {{is a goal}} of many manufacturers to improve production and quality. The elastic stiffness of paper {{is important for the}} paper industry. Currently, the elastic constants of paper are measured offline with contact ultrasonic methods [1 - 4]. Piezoelectric transducers are placed in contact with the paper surface to generate and detect plate wave modes, known as Lamb wave modes [5 - 7]. At low frequencies, where the wavelength of the elastic wave is larger than the paper thickness, two wave modes dominate in the paper, an anti-symmetric or flexural mode and a symmetric or thickness mode. Measurements of the phase velocities of these modes along both the machine direction (MD) and the perpendicular cross direction (CD) of the paper web provide an important parameter revealing the increased stiffness in the paper along the <b>MD</b> <b>direction...</b>|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{influence}} of fiber orientation on the crack propagation behavior was studied with single edge-notched specimens which were cut from an injection-molded plate of short-fiber reinforced plastics (SFRP), at five fiber angles {{relative to the}} loading axis, i. e. θ = 0 ° (MD), 22. 5 °, 45 °, 67. 5 °, 90 ° (TD). Macroscopic crack propagation path was nearly perpendicular to the loading axis for the cases of MD and TD. For the other fiber angles, the crack path was inclined because the crack tended to propagate along inclined fibers. In the relation between crack propagation rate and the stress intensity factor range, ∆K, the propagation rate of fatigue cracks was slowest for MD, and increased with increasing fiber angle. When the crack propagation rate was correlated to ∆K/E (Young’s modulus), the relations for different orientations merged together. The crack propagation rate was mainly controlled by ∆K at low rates and by the maximum stress intensity factor Kmax at high rates. The existence of the core layer had an influence on the fatigue crack propagation behavior of injection-molded plates. It accelerated crack propagation in <b>MD</b> <b>direction,</b> and decelerated in TD direction...|$|E

40|$|Several {{commercial}} polyolefin-based flexible foams {{produced by}} extrusion foaming were characterized {{in terms of}} their cellular morphology and fracture behaviour using the concept of the Essential Work of Fracture (EWF), focusing on the influence of foam's chemical nature, expansion ratio and cellular structure on the values of the fracture parameters. Correction procedures were proposed in order {{to take into account the}} complexity of foams in the obtained fracture parameters, particularly a correction procedure based on their expansion ratio, and a second one based on the fraction of polymer present in the foams determined from cellular structure characterization. Although doubts remain about the applicability of the EWF methodology to LDPE foams, the correction procedure based on the expansion ratio seemed to provide more accurate results than that based on polymer fraction, with EWF effectively distinguishing between polyolefin foams having different chemical nature. Comparatively, foams based on a P-E copolymer presented the highest values of the essential work of fracture in the <b>MD</b> <b>direction,</b> while significant differences were only observed in the TD direction for foams having a highly oriented cellular structure. All PP-based foams showed similar non-essential work of fracture values in both MD and TD directions. Peer ReviewedPostprint (author’s final draft...|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 145 - 149). Corrugated {{board is}} a composite sandwich type material used in the packaging industry worldwide. In the design of corrugated boxes, the stacking strength is an important design parameter. Current research shows that box failure is inﬂuenced by the ﬂexural rigidities of the panel and its transverse shear rigidities. McKinlay proposed a new method to measure the MD transverse shear stiffness of corrugated board. This research was aimed at designing a ﬁxture to perform the MD shear test and to evaluate its performance. In addition, the properties that inﬂuence box strength were to be investigated. These properties were then {{to be used in}} improved box strength predictions. It was found that the designed MD shear ﬁxture was able to measure the transverse shear stiffness of corrugated board in the <b>MD</b> <b>direction</b> {{with a high degree of}} accuracy and reproducibility. This method was much easier to perform than the standard block shear test method and also much quicker. This was a very important factor considering the application of this testing method in a research and development environment. In addition, the stiffness test exhibited good possibilities for use as a quality control tool. Extensive testing showed that the material used in the manufacture of corrugated board had a strong inﬂuence on board and box strength. In addition, it was found that the separation of the faces in a corrugated board structure had an inﬂuence on the strength and stability of the box. Factors such as the manufacturing process and board structure were also found to have an effect on box strength. Box strength predictions were performed using the methods available in the literature. These predictions had good correlation with the experimental box compression values. It was shown that box strength can be accurately predicted from liner and ﬂuting properties and this capability is an important tool in box strength design...|$|E
