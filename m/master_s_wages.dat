It argued that a <b>master.</b> <b>s</b> degree in industrial design would help graduates specialize in the related field and improve their skills. Therefore, this study consists of fundamental components about <b>master.</b> <b>s</b> studies in industrial design in turkey such as, existing circumstances of <b>master.</b> <b>s</b> degree, defining its problems and requirements, and resolution advisories to education. Seven universities offer a <b>master.</b> <b>s</b> degree in the field of industrial design in Turkey. In the study, comparative analysis of these programs is conducted on their current education system and two survey studies are realized among the academics of these universities, to examine their opinions. In the field study, the increase number of department facilities was underlined as one of the positive developments whereas problems concerning the academic staff of <b>master.</b> <b>s</b> programs came into prominence as the most important weaknesses. In addition, the required improvements of YOK criteria for the discipline were also found a critical situation for the future of programs.

40|$|A vast {{research}} literature indicates that comparison wages {{play a key}} role in determining job satisfaction. To examine this in the case of Australia, comparison wages are first constructed using two different measures, namely (1) cell average wages by age, gender and education level; and (2) ranked position of an individual 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>wages</b> in each cell. Then, using the first six waves of the HILDA Survey dataset, a random effects ordered probit model is utilized to predict overall job satisfaction. The findings of the study show that both own wages and comparison wages have an impact on overall job satisfaction. Comparison wages computed using the ranked position of an individual 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>wages</b> within a cell have an equal effect as that of own wages. The study further confirms that the ranked position of an individual 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>wages</b> in each cell matters more than cell average wages...|$|R

40|$|The {{majority}} of mainstream economists believe that globalization and trade liberalization {{have had a}} minor role in increasing U. <b>S.</b> <b>wage</b> inequality. A minority argues that capital mobility and outsourcing indicate a larger effect. This paper first surveys these views, and then argues that how we understand the policy consequences of trade liberalization helps determine the character of our analysis of the issue itself. Thus, a shift in policy perspective, to consider the "equity costs" of trade liberalization in terms of eroded U. S. labor market institutions, produces a larger framework for analyzing the consequences of globalization and trade liberalization than is available in traditional comparative advantage efficiency reasoning. From this wider perspective, trade liberalization has likely had {{a greater impact on}} U. <b>S.</b> <b>wage</b> inequality than even the minority mainstream position allows. globalization, trade liberalization, wage inequality, outsourcing, equity costs, institutions, comparative advantage,...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} an {{empirical}} {{study of the}} impact on U. <b>S.</b> <b>wage</b> structure of domestic technology, foreign technology, and import penetration. A model is presented which combines factor proportions theory with a version of growth theory. The model, which assumes two levels of skill, suggests that domestic technology raises both wages, while foreign technology, on a simple interpretation, lowers both. Trade at a constant technology, as usual, lowers the wage of that class of labor used intensively by the affected industry, and raises the other wage. The findings support the predictions of the model for domestic technology. On the other hand, they suggest that technological change, and perhaps other factors, have obscured the role of factor proportions in the data. Indeed, foreign technology and trade {{have the same effect}} on wages at different skill levels, not the opposite effects suggested by factor proportions. Finally, a simple diffusion story, in which foreign technology lowers all U. <b>S.</b> <b>wages,</b> is also rejected. Instead, uniformly higher U. <b>S.</b> <b>wages,</b> not lower, appear {{to be associated with the}} technology and trade of the oldest trading partners of the U. S., the economies of the West. Not so for Asia, especially the smaller countries which have recently accelerated their trade with the U. S. Their effects are uniformly negative on wages, suggesting a distinction between shock and long run effects of foreign technology and trade.

40|$|The rise in U. <b>S.</b> <b>wage</b> {{inequality}} {{over the}} past two decades is commonly associated with an increase in the use of "skill-biased" technologies (e. g., computer equipment) in the workplace, yet relatively few studies have attempted to measure the direct link between the two. This paper explores the relationship among inequality, worker education levels, and workplace computer usage using a sample of 230 U. S. industries between 1983 and 2002. The results generate two primary conclusions: First, this rising inequality in the United States has been caused predominantly by increasing wage dispersion within industries rather than between industries. Second, within-industry inequality is strongly tied to both the frequency of computer usage among workers and the fraction of total employment with a college degree. Both results lend support to the idea that skill-biased technological change has been an important element in the rise of U. <b>S.</b> <b>wage</b> inequality.

40|$|This {{study is}} {{concerned}} with the application of multivariate nonparametric models known as regression trees to the analysis of the U. <b>S.</b> <b>wage</b> structure. In Chapter 1, I first review regression trees and other available multivariate nonparametric techniques, highlighting their differences and common features. In the second part of Chapter 1, I look at the literature on the U. <b>S.</b> <b>wage</b> structure in connection with the issue of functional specification and argue that regression trees is particularly well suited for analyzing wage structures. In Chapter 2, I implement regression trees on U. <b>S.</b> <b>wages</b> for white male workers to estimate experience-wage profiles and unveil local sudden breaks in the profiles {{at the end of the}} working life. For 1980, these breaks account for about 50 % of the negative average differential between the last two experience groups. This effect decreases continuously until 1995. In Chapter 3 I propose a simple extension of the Oaxaca-type average wage gap decompositions between any two groups of workers. This procedure can be carried out without any compromise in the interpretation using a nonparametric wage structure. I then study wage gap decompositions for Mexican workers in the U. S. labor market. Finally, in Chapter 4 I apply regression trees to study both the relative growth performance of workers' real wages and the sources of wage dispersion and its evolution in the U. S. from 1980 onwards. On trends, the technique uncovers a linear structure for the growth experience of white workers with less than forty years of experience. On dispersion, at least 10 % of the increase in observed variance came from changes in the structure of wages itself...|$|R

40|$|In the 1970 s, the {{relative}} earnings advantage of highly educated workers, par-ticularly recent or young university graduates, deteriorated in the United States {{and most other}} OECD nations (Freeman 1981). This decline coincided with a pattern of decreasing wage differentials by occupation {{throughout much of the}} developed world. The narrowing of skill differentials in the 1970 s appears to have been strongly related to dramatic increases in {{the relative}} supply of highly educated workers generated by the labor force entrance of baby-boom cohorts and the rapid expansion of higher education. Explicit government and trade union policies aimed at reducing earnings differentials are also likely to have been an important factor in many countries. In contrast to the experience of the 1970 <b>s,</b> <b>wage</b> differentials by education and occupation expanded dramatically in the United States in the 1980 s.

Our analysis uses data from the CPS Outgoing Rotation Group (ORG) from 1992 to 2009. We find first that the largest part (around 77 % on average) of the recent changes in the U. <b>S.</b> <b>wage</b> inequality is explained by the wage structure effect and second that the earnings inequality is rising more at the top end of the wage distribution, {{even in the most}} recent years.

40|$|Much of the U. S. labor {{economics}} literature {{asserts that}} U. <b>S.</b> <b>wage</b> income inequality {{increased in the}} last half of the 20 th century. These papers point to two trends: 1) the increasing dispersion in U. <b>S.</b> <b>wage</b> incomes, and 2) the rapid growth in the relative frequency of large wage incomes of fixed size in constant dollar terms. A subset of the labor economics literature interprets these trends as a hollowing out of the wage income distribution. A hollowing out would yield fewer middling wage incomes. Since nonmetro wage incomes have, historically, been smaller than metro wage incomes, a hollowing out might disproportionately displace nonmetro wage incomes into the left mode of the hollowed out distribution, that of small wage incomes. However, there was no hollowing out of the nonmetro wage income distribution between 1961 and 2003. While trends # 1 and # 2 exist in U. <b>S.</b> nonmetro <b>wage</b> income data, they are aspects of the stretching of the distribution of nonmetro wage incomes to the right over larger wage incomes as all its percentiles increased between 1961 and 2003. This stretching means that all nonmetro wage income percentiles increase simultaneously with greater proportional growth in the smaller percentiles. The literature focused on the greater absolute gains of the larger percentiles and took them as evidence of growing inequality. This paper shows for nonmetro wage incomes in the U. S. that those gains are but one aspect of the stretching of the distribution and that other aspects of this transformation might as easily be taken as evidence of growing equality. ...|$|R
