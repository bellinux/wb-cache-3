5000|$|Bernard Vitet (26 May 1934 [...] - [...] 3 July 2013) was a French trumpetist, multi-instrumentist and composer, {{co-founder of}} the first free jazz band in France (1964) {{together}} with François Tusques, Michel <b>Portal</b> <b>Unit</b> (1972) and Un Drame Musical Instantané with Jean-Jacques Birgé and Francis Gorgé in 1976.|$|R
50|$|At the Jazz Inn, {{which he}} first played in 1972, {{he met the}} trio of Eddy Louiss, Bernard Lubat and Aldo Romano. Later, he joined Didier Levallet's Swing String System and the Michel <b>Portal</b> <b>Unit.</b> In 1976, l'Académie du Jazz awarded him the Prix Django Reinhardt. He then formed a new quartet with Michel Graillier, Aldo Romano, and Alby Cullaz, the latter soon {{replaced}} by Jean-François Jenny-Clark. He also worked with Michel Portal or Slide Hampton, Martial Solal and Jean-Claude Fohrenbach.|$|R
40|$|A <b>portal</b> axle <b>unit</b> is {{a gearbox}} unit {{installed}} on {{a vehicle for}} higher ground clearance and driving in off-road conditions. Shafts must be exceptionally tough and light to improve the overall performance of the <b>portal</b> axle <b>unit.</b> In this paper, a hollow shaft with a rib at both ends was proposed. The torsional stress of the three-dimensional shaft model was determined using finite element analysis (FEA) and validated by experimental testing. The hollow shaft thickness, rib thickness, depth of spokes, rib fillet radius, and number of spokes are the five of parameters considered in the torsional strength analysis of the rib. A Taguchi orthogonal array (L 25) was applied to determine the optimum set of parameters for the proposed shaft. The strength and weight of the optimized model were calculated and compared to the solid shaft, hollow shaft, and proposed model. The optimized model showed improvement in torsional strength with {{a slight increase in}} weight compared to the benchmark model...|$|R

During this period he was responsible for the transformation of Wind Telecomunicazioni S.P.A, initially a company on the downturn, in just three years, into one of the best performing mobile, fixed line and broadband integrated operators in the continent.|$|R
40|$|Hepatocellular adenomas (HCA) are {{uncommon}} benign neoplasms, {{more commonly}} found in women in the reproductive years {{with a history of}} oral contraceptive intake. The exact mechanism by which adenomas originate is not known, but exper-imental evidence suggests that sex hormones are promoters rather than initiators of hepatocellular neoplasm [1, 2]. Cases of HCA have also been re-ported in men and children, as well as in women with no history of oral contraceptive intake [3 – 5]. Grossly, HCA are solitary, well-defined, and usu-ally encapsulated masses, clearly distinct from liver parenchyma. Rarely, they are multilobulated and few are pedunculated [2, 6]. Microscopically they resemble normal liver parenchyma without <b>portal</b> <b>units.</b> Differential diagnosis includes focal nodular hy-perplasia and well-differentiated hepatocellular car-cinoma. Sometimes, differentiation from the latter can be difficult and involves careful evaluation of pathologic characteristics, particular attention being paid to the presence of architectural features, cellu-lar atypia, mitosis, and vascular invasion [2]. Some cases of hepatocellular carcinoma have been reported in diseases associated with iron over-load, but tumors with secondary iron deposition are extremely uncommon and may show some unusual features leading to diagnostic difficulties [7 – 10]. This report summarizes the pathological findings in 3 cases of HCA with some unusual characteristics including pseudoinfiltrative contours and heavy iron deposition...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the problematics of varnish {{degradation}} due to maintanance of a car or more precisely due to washing of a car bodywork and searching for a gentle washing of a car. The first section of this thesis discusses {{the creation of a}} protection layer of the car bodywork or types of varnishing, particular layers of varnish and additional products enhancing the qualities of car varnish. Second part of thesis analyses the measuring and evaluation of the state of varnish layers and uses the results for valuation of estetical and functional advantages and disadvantages. In third part we deal with description and categorisation of types and technologies of car washing. Fourth part focuses on experimentation and comparison of varnish degradation due to selected types of car washing using tests simulating real conditions of regular service. Particularly we evaluate <b>portal</b> washing <b>units</b> and hand washing. Consequently we subjectively and objectively analyse all the information and finaly we project this information to time and economical perspective...|$|R
40|$|AFIT/GNE/ENP/ 08 -M 04 The {{goal of this}} {{research}} work {{was to determine if}} there exists, and to what extent, variability in the pulse-height spectrum, and resolution produced by γ-photon induced scintillation events in polyvinyl toluene scintillators. Scintillator panels of the same type as those used in <b>portal</b> detector <b>units</b> currently operated by the Department of Homeland Security, made of polyvinyl toluene and measuring 12 × 15 × 2 in were purchased from three vendors. Each vendor supplied two scintillators, one wrapped by the vendor with aluminum foil coated mylar, and two unwrapped. The scintillators where exposed to an ≈ 8 µCi source collimated 137 Cs source which decays with a 662 keV γ-ray 85 % of the time. A Hamamatsu R 329 - 02 photomultiplier tube was optically mated to the 12 × 2 in surface of the scintillator. The pulse height spectrum was recorded with the source placed at different positions {{across the surface of the}} scintillator. Analysis of the pulse height spectrum was performed to determine efficienc...|$|R
40|$|The needs {{generated}} by the current context of the Portuguese projection have not been accompanied by a scientific production that expands at the same rate. The publishing of textbooks for Portuguese language teaching as a foreign and/or second language (PFL-PSL) has a gap concerning supplying the needs of learners to develop multiple competencies to establish meaningful relationships with people from other languages-cultures. Among the initiatives {{that have been developed}} to help teachers and learners of PFL-PSL, the online platform Portal do Professor de Português Língua Estrangeira/ Língua Não Materna (PPPLE) has a distinctive feature by offering teaching lessons that take into account the linguistic and cultural varieties of the Lusophone world. The <b>Portal</b> offers teaching <b>units</b> from five Portuguese-speaking countries so far: Angola, Brazil, East Timor, Mozambique and Portugal, reinforcing a view of Portuguese as a pluricentric language, shared by different countries and communities with specific rules for each context. This paper presents how teaching lessons are developed and discusses the articulation with theoretical and methodological principles that served as the foundation for the platform...|$|R
