40|$|The {{historical}} {{development of the}} European Union’s immigration policy has been described in the article. The main four phases of common immigration policy of the EU have been examined. Each phase {{is characterized by the}} adoption of important agreements and programs. In particular, the principles of Amsterdam Treaty and the Treaty of Lisbon and five-year program have been analyzed in the paper: Tampere (1999), The Hague (2004), Stockholm (2009) and guidelines Ypres (2014). The program contains guidelines for a common politics on the topics of protection of fundamental rights, privacy, minority rights and rights of groups of people in need of special protection, as well as a citizenship of the European Union. Such different spheres as domestic and public security, migration (European pact on immigration and asylum), the combat against the organized crime, and even family law, private law, inheritance law and others have been described in the program. The Ypes guidelines don’t constitute a program any more, but they rather guide focusing on the objective of transposition, implementation and consolidation of the existing legal instruments and measures. The guidelines point out the necessity to adopt a holistic approach to migration, making the best possible use of the regular migration, affording protection to those who need it, combating irregular migration and managing borders effectively. The need for the formation of the migration policy is becoming more apparent {{in view of the fact}} that globalization increases due to migration flows and its effectiveness depends largely on the cooperation with other <b>Member</b> <b>States,</b> countries <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> and transit countries. Nowadays, regulation of migration flows in the EU is a political process, which is legally coordinated from the acquit of the EU and national legislation <b>of</b> the <b>Member</b> <b>States.</b> Transfer <b>of</b> the migration policy to the supranational level allows tracking changes, made at the national level, in order to respond to the challenge of migration character without significant delay. The main conclusion of the article is that, on the one hand, immigration has become a relevant issue in all the EU countries. On the other hand, as a consequence of different timing of immigration, different socio-economic contexts and varying governmental migration and integration policies, different forms of migration, with different governmental policies of migration and integration, and with different types of migrants have evolved. Such different starting positions should be taken into account when studying the consequences of the immigration and the presence of migrants in society...|$|R

40|$|V magistrski nalogi avtorica najprej obravnava odločbe Sodišča EU, ki so pomembne z vidika uresničevanja pravice do svobodnega ustanavljanja po pravu EU, natančneje z vidika čezmejnega prenosa sedeža družbe. Ob tem večji poudarek nameni sodni odločbi v zadevi Cartesio, pri čemer so podrobneje predstavljeni tako sklepni predlogi generalnega pravobranilca v tej zadevi, kot tudi odločitev Sodišča EU. Avtorica se v bistvenem strinja s sklepnimi predlogi generalnega pravobranilca, vendar jih Sodišče EU ni povzelo v svojo odločitev, zato je do nje zavzeto nekoliko kritično stališče. Že v dispoziciji magistrskega dela je avtorica postavila tezo, da je treba čezmejni prenos statutarnega (in dejanskega) sedeža družbe v skladu s stališči Sodišča EU v zadevi Cartesio dopuščati zgolj na podlagi določb PDEU o svobodi ustanavljanja. Julija 2012 je Sodišče EU to tezo potrdilo z odločitvijo v zadevi VALE. V magistrski nalogi je zato podrobneje analizirana tudi odločitev Sodišča EU v tej zadevi, na podlagi vseh obravnavanih sodb pa so strnjeni zaključki o dopustnosti čezmejnega prenosa sedeža družbe v EU. Analizirani so različni položaji glede na to, ali gre za priselitev dejanskega in/ali statutarnega sedeža družbe v državo članico gostiteljico ali za izselitev dejanskega in/ali statutarnega sedeža družbe iz matične države članice. Pri tem je zelo pomembno, ali država članica gostiteljica oziroma matična država članica sprejema teorijo dejanskega sedeža ali teorijo ustanovitve. Zaključki se nanašajo tako na trenutno stanje v nacionalnih zakonodajah držav članic EU kot tudi na morebitno normativno ureditev te problematike v Štirinajsti direktivi. Za sprejem tega akta si pravna stroka prizadeva že vrsto let, vendar je Evropska komisija kot predlagatelj šele za leto 2013 napovedala ponovno proučitev stanja na tem področju. Pri urejanju čezmejnega prenosa statutarnega sedeža družbe na ravni EU se kot najbolj sporno ocenjuje vprašanje načela teritorialne skladnosti sedeža družbe. Sodišče EU v svojih odločitvah namreč od njega odstopa, sprejeto pa je med drugim v Uredbi SE. Ta je v magistrskem delu obravnavana zaradi edinstvene normativne ureditve čezmejnega prenosa sedeža gospodarske družbe na ravni EU. Posebno pozornost je avtorica namenila obravnavi davčnopravnih vprašanj v zvezi s čezmejnim prenosom sedeža družbe v EU. V magistrskem delu je analizirana sodna praksa Sodišča EU v zvezi z obdavčitvijo premoženja, ki ga družba s čezmejnim prenosom sedeža prenese v državo članico gostiteljico. Prav tako je raziskana normativna davčnopravna ureditev prenosa rezidenstva družbe v drugo državo članico ob primerljivih položajih (prenosu sedeža SE, čezmejnih združitvah in delitvah), ko družba v matični državi članici ohrani poslovno enoto. Na podlagi zaključkov sodne prakse Sodišča EU in omenjene davčnopravne normativne ureditve je avtorica v magistrskem delu oblikovala smernice, ki naj bi jih matične države članice upoštevale pri: (1) obdavčenju prenosa premoženja družbe v drugo državo članico ob čezmejnem prenosu sedeža družbe in (2) davčni obravnavi poslovne enote družbe, ki po čezmejnem prenosu sedeža ostane na ozemlju matične države članice. Ta stališča bi bilo treba upoštevati tudi ob snovanju sprememb Direktive 2009 / 133 zaradi morebitnega sprejema Štirinajste direktive, s čimer bi bila odpravljena pravna negotovost, ki sedaj spremlja družbe s težnjo po čezmejnem prenosu sedeža v EU. In this master thesis the authoress {{at first}} {{analyses}} the case {{law of the}} Court of Justice of the EU, which is important as regards freedom of establishment, more precisely the cross-border transfer of company’s seat. The Cartesio case has been analysed in greater detail, thereby the authoress discusses the opinion of Advocate General, which is in several points covered with her view. Otherwise the authoress has been critical to the judgement in Cartesio case, since it rejected {{the opinion of the}} Advocate General. The disposition of the thesis suggested the admissibility of cross-border transfer of company’s registered office (with its real seat) in line with the judgement in Cartesio case {{solely on the basis of}} the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. In July 2012 the Court of Justice of the EU confirmed this thesis with its judgement in VALE case. Therefore this case has also been analysed in greater detail, while the authoress researching this case and in the light of the relevant case law draws the conclusions regarding the admissibility of cross-border transfer of company’s seat. Different views has been discussed, depending on the immigration of the company’s real seat and/or the company’s registered office to the host Member State or the emigration of the company’s real seat and/or the company’s registered office from the <b>Member</b> <b>State</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin.</b> It is of great importance whether the host Member State or the <b>Member</b> <b>State</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> accepts the real seat theory or the incorporation theory. The conclusions concern the current state in national regulations of the Member States and the possible future steps regarding the adoption of the Fourteenth Directive. Legal science has been recommending the adoption of this directive for several years, nevertheless the European Commission as the proposer yet in 2013 announced the reassessment of these initiatives. The principle of territorial coincide of the company’s seat is considered to be the most controversial issue in regulating the cross-border transfer of company’s registered office. It has not been followed in the case law of the Court of Justice of the EU, although it is accepted in the SE Regulation. This regulation has been dealt with in the master thesis for its unique regulatory framework for cross-border transfer of company’s registered office at the EU level. The special attention in this master thesis has been given to taxation issues regarding cross-border transfer of the company’s seat in EU. The case law of the Court of Justice of the EU which is important for the taxation of the transferred assets occured with the transfere of the company’s seat to a host Member State has been analysed. The regulatory framework of the taxation of the transfer of the company’s residency to another Member State at comparable situations (transfer of the SE’s seat, cross-border mergers and divisions), when the company maintain its place of business in the <b>Member</b> <b>State</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin,</b> has been researched as well. Based on the findings of the relevant case-law of the Court of Justice of the EU and the above mentioned comparable taxation regulation the authoress suggests some guidelines that Member States of origin should consider in: (1) taxation of the transferred assets to another Member State occurred with the cross-border transfer of the company’s seat and (2) tax treatment of the company’s place of business, which is maintained in the <b>Member</b> <b>State</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> after the cross-border transfer of the company’s seat. These views should be taken into account while drawing up amendments to Directive 2009 / 133 followed by the possible adoption of the Fourteenth Directive, which would eliminate the legal uncertainty that currently affects companies with the tendency for cross-border transfer of the seat in EU...|$|E

Through its international and / or European regulations (Hague Convention of 25 October 1980 on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction, which is supplemented by Regulation (EC) no. 2201 / 2003 of 27 November 2003 concerning jurisdiction, the recognition and enforcement of judgments in matrimonial matters and in matters of parental responsibility, (prevailing the latter) and national ones (Law no. 63 / 2014 amending and supplementing Law no. 369 / 2004 on the application of the Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction which Romania adhered to by the Law no. 100 / 199), the legislator sought to ensure the prompt return of children abducted in the <b>Member</b> <b>State</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin,</b> the objective being the same: discouraging underage child abduction by a parent or by third parties, usually relatives and, in case of committing an act of international abduction of minors, ensuring {{the best interests of the}} child through the cooperation of the competent authorities in the field.

40|$|The {{ruling in}} Akrich, {{delivered}} by the full Court, concerns fundamental issues of policy {{in relation to the}} impact of Community law upon Member States immigration rules: how far can the Union citizens’ right to gain entry and residence permits for their spouses in situations regulated by Community law be used to circumvent the national provisions controlling migration fluxes from outside the Union? Can a Union citizen’s spouse who is unlawfully present in the Union territory rely on Community law to rectify his legal situation? The issue is one of great importance for migration policies: first of all, there is a significant danger of marriages of convenience; secondly, there is a widespread tendency to penalise abuses of immigration rules with deportation. Thus, many Member States provide that marriage can never be used to rectify the illegal status of a third country national, and that therefore a person who is unlawfully present within the State’s territory has in any case to leave and apply for entrance clearance from her own State of origin. However, if the situation were to fall within the scope of Article 10 Regulation 1612 / 68, deportation would not be possible unless justified by the public policy derogation. It is clear that the right to family reunification provided by secondary legislation was drafted with a very simple situation in mind – that of a Union citizen, already married to a third country national, 4 who wished to move to another Member State to there exercise an economic activity. Since the Union citizen was assumed to have a right to live with her spouse in the country of origin, deprivation of that right would result in a significant hindrance to movement. However, in such a simple scenario, the <b>Member</b> <b>State</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> would have already cleared the immigration status of the third country national spouse; in this sense Article 10 Regulation 1612 / 68 might be seen as requiring a sort of mechanism of mutual recognition, intended to make the enjoyment of the free movement rights fully effective. However, matters become more complicated when the immigration status of the third country national has not been previously cleared, either because she was unlawfully present in the Union territory at the time of marriage, or because marriage post-dates movement. In those cases, Community law might well impinge upon migration policies, an area which is tainted by complex political choices, as well as much populist rhetoric...|$|E
40|$|Under {{the current}} VAT system {{defined in the}} Sixth VAT Directive, Member States are {{required}} to have a single VAT rate of at least 15 % and may have a maximum of two reduced VAT rates set no lower than 5 %. Annex H of the 6 Directive outlines {{the list of the}} goods and services to which reduced rates could apply. However, this basic structure which applies to all Member States is complicated by the numerous individual temporary derogations granted to particular Member States. Most of these specific rates (zero rate, super reduced rates, parking rate and so on) are to be found under the title XVI Transitional provisions Article 28 of the 6 Directive and most have been granted until the entry into force of the "definitive system" of VAT based on taxation in the <b>Member</b> <b>State</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin.</b> The aim {{of this paper is to}} shed some light on the application of the current VAT system to both VAT bases and rates among Member States. For the VAT bases, our indicators demonstrate the share of the base to which a specific VAT rate applies relative to the whole taxable base. For the VAT rates, focusing on the statutory standard VAT rate is not satisfactory. To take into account the existence of different VAT rates, we compute implicit VAT rates. These implicit VAT rates give an indication on the VAT burden. Our analysis shows that the standard VAT rate is far from applicable to the whole taxable base. In the year 2000, on average for the EU- 15, 69 % of the VAT taxable transactions value was taxed at the standard VAT rate. Moreover for some Member States, only around half of the taxable transactions were actually taxed at the standard VAT rate. Therefore, non-standard VAT rates are not the exception as they should be. Taking into account all VAT rates in force gives us an implicit VAT rate that is up to 30 % lower than the standard rate in force in the Member States. In the year 2000, the EU- 15 average for the statutory standard VAT rate was 19. 4 % with a minimum (compulsory) of 15 % and a maximum of 25 %. In contrast, the implicit VAT rate for the EU- 15 was 15. 9 % with a larger volatility. VAT, European Union, Taxation, effective tax rates...|$|E

40|$|The cases {{annotated}} here seek {{to clarify}} the law {{in relation to the}} family rights of own citizens when returning to the <b>Member</b> <b>State</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> (circular migration); or when exercising the rights to free movement in another Member State whilst residing in the Member State of nationality (frontier migration). This is a complex area of the law in a political minefield: the Court has, broadly speaking, been generous with the rights of family members; it is sufficient here to recall the case law on the derived right of residence of parents of migrant children in education. Yet, the cases annotated here are difficult because they are at the very boundary between national and European law: indeed it is this boundary that the Court was asked to clarify. In this respect, it is clear that Member States wish to retain regulatory prerogatives in relation to the rights of family reunification of own citizens: {{it is no coincidence that}} Article 3 (1) Directive 2004 / 38 provides that the Directive can only be invoked against a State different from that of nationality. However, if the political will is clear, the legal situation is more complex since, pre-Directive 2004 / 38, the Court had already declared that Union citizens could invoke the Treaty against their State of nationality when they establish a cross-border element; and that the refusal to grant family reunification rights could be construed as a barrier to movement. 5 Here, therefore, the Grand Chamber had to elaborate on the extent to which the primary Treaty provisions grant rights to returning nationals and to frontier workers, that is to say it had to elaborate on the conditions necessary to invoke the Singh and the Carpenter doctrines respectively. Both the Singh and the Carpenter doctrines have proven to be very contentious with the Member States; in particular, some governments do not welcome further incursions in their migration policies. Furthermore, following the introduction of Union citizenship it has become easier to satisfy some cross-border requirement: what then if Union citizens tried to rely on those doctrines too easily, without having established proper economic/cross-border credentials? The national family reunification regimes would be directly undermined, and indirectly harmonized, through the “clever” exploitation of EU law. This is the problem that the Court seemingly attempted to solve in the rulings in questions. And yet, the carefully tailored solutions seem to fit no one – far from clarifying the scope of application of the Carpenter and Singh doctrines, and the reasons underlying them, it creates a system which is both confused and legally irrational...|$|E
40|$|The {{characteristics}} of free movement is {{the elimination of}} obstacles to trade between Member States and thus by such, create free movement within the entire union. Therefore art 34 in the Treaty of Lisabon (FEUF) states that all quantative restrictions on imports and measures of equivalent effect are prohibited. The legal approach to measures having equivalent effect is still unclear {{and the purpose of}} this paper is therefore to propose a solution to that particular problem. What can be said when it comes to this rule is that the EU-Court has gone from applying a discrimination test to a market access doctrine. According to the Court´s case law, measures having equivalent effects to quantative restrictions are “All trading rules enacted by Member States which are capable of hindering, directly or indirectly, actually or potentially, intra-community trade”.   The question of how to apply the test when it comes to a potential hinder to intra-community trade is still unclear. Connected to this is the remoteness test where hinders that are too indirect and uncertain cannot fall within the ambit of art 34 FEUF. The Courts case law has made it clear that a de minimis rule should not be applied so even small and unsubstantial hinders can fall within art 34 FEUF. The Court has also stated that a Member State that impedes a product from being imported to it´s territory when it has been lawfully produced and marketed in the <b>member</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin,</b> constitutes a measure of equivalent effect to quantative restrictions. This is referred to as the Cassis doctrine. In the case law after Cassis, there were a lot of contradicitions as to what constitutes measures of equivalent effects. That problem was solved by the Court in the Keck case where all measures relating to “certain” selling arrangements is not as such as to hinder trade between Member States. However, that is the case as long as they apply to all relevant traders operating within the national territory and as long as they affect in the same manner, in law and in fact, the marketing of domestic products and of those from other Member States (Keckcriterias). The problem today in connection to Cassis and Keck is that it can be hard to make a distinction between selling arrangements and rules connected to product requirements. After the development in Keck, the Court stated in the Trailers case that those measures relating to the use of goods which prohibits or impedes the use of them, constitutes measures of equivalent effect and thus are prohibited because they impede the good´s access to the market. Post Keck case law confirmes that when it comes to Member States national measures, one must apply both the discrimination test and the market access test in order to find out whether the rules falls within the ambit of art 34 FEUF. How this test should be applied is still unclear today, which creates legal uncertainty. This is something for the Court to work on in the future.    Hiba Zeyd...|$|E
40|$|The Swedish {{exit tax}} {{legislation}} in Chapter 22. § 5 p. 4 IL states that businesses who change its tax residence to another Member State within the EES are taxed as having its assets {{sold at the}} time of the change of domicile. This legislation was declared incompatible with the freedom of establishment in case RÅ 2009 ref. 30 due to the fact that businesses who changed tax residence were treated worse than businesses that remained within the <b>Member</b> <b>State</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin.</b> Of importance for the outcome of the case was the fact that ECJ had declared exit tax incompatible with the freedom of establishment in two previous cases. In connection with RÅ 2008 ref. 30 the Commission also addressed requirements for Sweden to abolish the restrictive legislation through a reasoned opinion. In the aftermath of RÅ 2008 ref. 30 the legislator drafted a suggestion for new legislation which aimed to make the exit tag legislation in IL compatible with the freedom of establishment. The legislator made clear that the communication from the Commission on exit taxation was of great significance in formulating the legislation, particularly the requirement from the Commission that exit tax ought not to lead to immediate tax consequences for the businesses. The suggested legislation made businesses able to defer payment of the exit tax by introducing a new chapter in SBL. Thus did not the wording of the exit tax legislation in IL change. The suggested legislation was heavily criticized by the respondents in the preparatory legislation and also in legal doctrine. The legislation was, however, adopted and the deferment legislation in Chapter 17 a SBL came into force 1 January 2010. The question that arises is whether this addition to the exit tax legislation is a sufficient action to achieve the objective of the legislation. It can be concluded that the situation for businesses changing tax residence is not significantly affected by the introduction of the deferment legislation in Chapter 17 a SBL. The fact remains that business changing tax residence still are adversely affected due to the fact that taxation occurs on the exit date, which can have the effect of these businesses being taxed in an earlier phase than resident businesses. Consequently the legislation continue to impose immediate tax consequences in certain cases. The fact that the legislation could be achieved in a less restrictive manner by placing the time of taxation at the real disposal of the assets makes the legislation disproportionate. Furthermore, it is not obvious that the conditions which the deferment is associated with should be seen as proportionate either. Due to the fact that it is ascertain that the conditions in some cases can be costly in terms of valuation costs and that the purpose of the legislation could be achieved in a less restrictive manner by applying directives in the field of mutual assistance and recovery of claims instead of an annual deferment procedure. The conditions could therefore be considered disproportionate in relation to the purpose of the legislation. Nevertheless, the main reason for arguing that the Swedish exit tax legislation should be considered as incompatible with the freedom of establishment is the fact that the legislation does not take full account of the taxed assets potential decrease in value, capable of arising after the businesses transfer of tax residence. Through ECJ-case law it can be noted that decrease in value must be taken into account by either the state of origin or the host state to be considered proportionate. The Swedish exit tax legislation is therefore incompatible with the freedom of establishment in all cases where the host state does not take notice of such decrease in value...|$|E
