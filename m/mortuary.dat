5|$|To {{the east}} of the pyramid, Djedkare's <b>mortuary</b> temple was laid out. The east façade of the <b>mortuary</b> temple was flanked by two massive stone structures, which {{resemble}} the later pylons. The <b>mortuary</b> temple is connected via a yet unexcavated causeway to a valley temple.|$|E
5|$|Userkaf's pyramid {{is part of}} {{a larger}} <b>mortuary</b> complex {{comprising}} a <b>mortuary</b> temple, an offering chapel and a cult pyramid as well as separate pyramid and <b>mortuary</b> temple for Userkaf's wife, queen Neferhetepes. Userkaf's <b>mortuary</b> temple and cult pyramid are today completely ruined and difficult to recognize. The pyramid of the queen is no more than a mound of rubble, with its funerary chamber exposed by stone robbers.|$|E
5|$|Near the baptistery is a {{separate}} rectangular <b>mortuary</b> chapel (ermita de difuntos) built in 1859. A road from the <b>mortuary</b> chapel leads to the cemetery with stone fences. At {{the middle of the}} cemetery is a stone chapel and an ossuary at its back.|$|E

5000|$|The Health (Burial) Regulations (1946) {{control the}} {{handling}} and burial of dead bodies, {{the operation of}} <b>mortuaries</b> and the registration of funeral directors.

5|$|The main {{pyramid of}} Sahure's <b>mortuary</b> complex exemplifies {{the decline of}} pyramid building, {{both in terms of}} size and quality. Yet, the {{accompanying}} <b>mortuary</b> temple is considered to be the most sophisticated one built up to that time.|$|E
5|$|The {{temple and}} pyramid were also {{surrounded}} by a brick wall. Likely for reasons of economy, the causeway leading to the <b>mortuary</b> temple {{at the foot of}} the pyramid was never built, no satellite pyramid was added to the <b>mortuary</b> complex, and the valley temple was left unfinished. Consequently, the priest of the <b>mortuary</b> cult of Neferirkare lived on the temple premises, in dwellings of mud-bricks and rushes, rather than in the pyramid town closer to the Nile valley.|$|E
5|$|In the Pyramid Age, {{the tomb}} of the king was {{associated}} with a <b>mortuary</b> temple located close to the pyramid. As {{the tomb of}} the king was hidden, this <b>mortuary</b> temple was located away from the burial, closer to the cultivation facing toward Thebes. These <b>mortuary</b> temples became places visited during the various festivals held in the Theban necropolis. Most notable is the Beautiful festival of the valley, where the sacred barques of Amun-Re, his consort, Mut, and son, Khonsu, left the temple at Karnak in order to visit the funerary temples of deceased kings on the West Bank and their shrines in the Theban Necropolis.|$|E

5|$|It is {{possible}} that Shepseskare continued {{the construction of the}} funerary complex of his predecessor. As Neferefre had died after a short reign, his pyramid complex was far from finished and neither the burial chamber nor the <b>mortuary</b> temple had been built. The planned pyramid was thus hastily changed into a square mastaba representing a stylized primeval hill and the accompanying <b>mortuary</b> temple was completed during the reign of Nyuserre.|$|E
5|$|Many temples {{were now}} built entirely of stone, and their general plan became fixed, with the sanctuary, halls, courtyards, and pylon {{gateways}} oriented {{along the path}} used for festival processions. New Kingdom pharaohs ceased using pyramids as funerary monuments and placed their tombs a great distance from their <b>mortuary</b> temples. Without pyramids to build around, <b>mortuary</b> temples began using the same plan as those dedicated to the gods.|$|E
5|$|The first {{hypothesis}} {{is that this is}} due to a change of ideology. The advent of the 5th dynasty marks the growing importance of the cult of the sun as hinted by the Westcar Papyrus. This is also directly evidenced by the large sun temples built at Abusir throughout the dynasty, a tradition initiated by Userkaf. Finally, the Abusir Papyri demonstrate the strong connection between the cult of the sun and the <b>mortuary</b> cult of the pharaohs of this dynasty: offerings for a deceased ruler were first consecrated in a sun temple before being dispatched to his <b>mortuary</b> temple. Thus, Userkaf located his <b>mortuary</b> temple to the south of the main pyramid so that the sun would shine directly into it all year round.|$|E

5|$|The site {{used for}} the Willard Whyte Space Labs (where Bond gets away in the Moon Buggy) was actually, at that time, a Johns-Manville gypsum plant located just outside Las Vegas. The home of Kirk Douglas was {{used for the}} scene in Tiffany's house, while the Elrod House in Palm Springs, {{designed}} by John Lautner, became Willard Whyte's house. The exterior shots of the Slumber <b>mortuary</b> were of the Palm <b>Mortuary</b> in Henderson, Nevada. The interiors were a set constructed at Pinewood Studios, where Ken Adam imitated the real building's lozenge-shaped stained glass window in its nave. During location filming, Adam visited several funeral homes in the Las Vegas area, the inspiration behind the gaudy design of the Slumber <b>mortuary</b> (the use of tasteless Art Nouveau furniture and Tiffany lamps) came from these experiences. Production wrapped with the crematorium sequence, on 13 August 1971.|$|E
5|$|Thutmose I was {{the first}} king who {{definitely}} {{was buried in the}} Valley of the Kings. Ineni was commissioned to dig this tomb, and presumably to build his <b>mortuary</b> temple. His <b>mortuary</b> temple has not been found, quite possibly because it was incorporated into or demolished by the construction of Hatshepsut's <b>mortuary</b> temple at Deir el-Bahri. His tomb, however, has been identified as KV38. In it was found a yellow quartzite sarcophagus bearing the name of Thutmose I. His body, however, may have been moved by Thutmose III into the tomb of Hatshepsut, KV20, which also contains a sarcophagus with the name of Thutmose I on it.|$|E
5|$|A {{hexagonal}} <b>mortuary</b> {{is located}} {{on the left side of}} the façade. It was built by Father Bon between 1867 and 1868. Inside is a baroque retablo, similar to the altars inside the church. It is now used as an adoration chapel.|$|E

5|$|Excavations at {{the pyramid}} of Sahure in Abusir under the {{direction}} of Miroslav Verner and Tarek El-Awady in the early 2000s provide a picture of the royal family of the early 5th Dynasty. In particular, reliefs from the causeway linking the valley and <b>mortuary</b> temples of the pyramid complex reveal that Sahure's mother was queen Neferhetepes II. She was the wife of pharaoh Userkaf, as indicated by the location of her pyramid immediately adjacent to that of Userkaf, which makes Userkaf the father of Sahure in all likelihood. This is further confirmed by the discovery of Sahure's cartouche in the <b>mortuary</b> temple of Userkaf at Saqqara, indicating that Sahure finished the structure started most probably by his father.|$|E
