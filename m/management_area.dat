5|$|To improve drainage, a levee was {{constructed}} in 1967, separating the lake from the Victoria Barge Canal, which runs along the bay's northern and eastern shores; cutting off several bayous from the lake. The canal begins north at an industrial plant outside Victoria and empties in San Antonio Bay in Seadrift. Hog Bayou runs along the western shore of Green Lake, through the Guadalupe Delta Wildlife <b>Management</b> <b>Area</b> to the south, before its confluence with Mission Lake.|$|E
5|$|Discovery of the Kiger Mustang was {{the result}} of a BLM Mustang roundup in the Beatys Butte area in Harney County in 1977. During the roundup, it was noticed that among the horses {{collected}} from the area, there was a group with similar color and markings. DNA testing by the University of Kentucky showed close relation to the Spanish horses brought to the Americas in the 17th century. These distinct horses were separated from the other horses and the BLM placed two groups in separate areas of Steens Mountain to preserve the breed. Seven horses were placed in the Riddle Mountain Herd <b>Management</b> <b>Area</b> (HMA) and twenty in the Kiger HMA.|$|E

5|$|The highway {{begins at}} a {{junction}} with NY26 in Cincinnatus, {{a town in}} eastern Cortland County. It heads east across the Otselic River and through the hamlet of Lower Cincinnatus before curving to the northeast and crossing into Chenango County very soon afterward. Across the county line, it continues northeast through a lightly developed valley surrounding Brakel Creek to the Pharsalia State Wildlife <b>Management</b> <b>Area,</b> where it connects with CR42, a highway that was once part of NY23. From here, the route heads southeastward along another valley, this one surrounding Canasawacta Creek, {{to the city of}} Norwich, the county seat of Chenango County. It heads east–west across the city on Pleasant and Rexford streets, passing through mostly residential areas and intersecting with NY12 at Broad Street.|$|E
5|$|FM 1528 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with FM 64 in the unincorporated community of Antioch as a two-lane, paved road. The highway proceeds southward, entering {{rural areas and}} intersecting several small roads. The road continues, entering the former community of Gough and intersects FM 2068. FM 1528 turns due eastward and continues, exiting the Gough area. The roadway proceeds east, intersecting several county roads and traveling past several small houses. The highway bends southward and travels a short distance before it intersects SH 24. The highway runs concurrently with SH 24 for a short distance before splitting off, proceeding into the community of Klondike. The road turns northeast, after it proceeds through Klondike and intersects FM 2890. The roadway continues northeastward, passing through the Cooper Wildlife <b>Management</b> <b>Area,</b> as well as traveling over a creek leading to Cooper Lake before it reenters rural areas. It continues, passing over another creek before it bends eastward. At {{the southern edge of}} Cooper, the route intersects FM 1880. The road bends northward, entering the city of Cooper. The roadway passes several small buildings in the community before reaching its eastern terminus, an intersection with SH 154 and State Highway 24 Business.|$|E
5|$|Junction 28 of the M5 {{lies within}} the parish of Cullompton {{and a short}} {{distance}} from the town centre. Other major road links are the A373 to Honiton and the former A38 to Exeter which runs through the town, and is now the B3181. In 2001 61.6% of people living in Cullompton travelled to work by car or van and 83% of households had at least one car. In October 1969 a bypass was completed but after only five years this was upgraded to form part of the M5. Since this time traffic coming from the south of Cullompton to the M5 junction has had to pass through the centre of the town. There are now problems with air quality in the town and Mid Devon District Council have made the whole of the built up area in Cullompton an Air quality <b>management</b> <b>area.</b> Traffic on the exit slip road leaving the M5 northbound often backed up onto the motorway, so the Highways Agency and Devon County Council made junction improvements by widening roads, introducing traffic lights and reopening the left hand lane of the northbound slip road, at a cost of £1.3m. This cost was covered by businesses moving to Cullompton.|$|E
