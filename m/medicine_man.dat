5|$|During the Sun Dance, {{which is}} practiced by many Plains Indian tribes, the eagle is {{represented}} in several ways. The eagle nest {{is represented by the}} fork of the lodge where the dance is held. A whistle made from the wing bone of an eagle is used {{during the course of the}} dance. Also during the dance, a <b>medicine</b> <b>man</b> may direct his fan, which is made of eagle feathers, to people who seek to be healed. The <b>medicine</b> <b>man</b> touches the fan to the center pole and then to the patient, in order to transmit power from the pole to the patient. The fan is then held up toward the sky, so that the eagle may carry the prayers for the sick to the Creator.|$|E
5|$|In 1875, the Northern Cheyenne, Hunkpapa, Oglala, Sans Arc, and Minneconjou camped {{together}} for a Sun Dance, with both the Cheyenne <b>medicine</b> <b>man</b> White Bull or Ice and Sitting Bull in association. This ceremonial alliance preceded their fighting together in 1876. Sitting Bull had a major revelation.|$|E
5|$|The Sunrise Dance Ceremony is not {{an ancient}} Yavapai ceremony. Apache and Yavapai often intermarried and adopted {{elements}} of each other's cultures; these two tribes reside together on the Camp Verde and Fort McDowell reservations. The Sunrise Dance is a four-day rite-of-transition for young Apache girls, which typically takes place from March through October. The sunrise dance is an ancient practice, unique to the Apache. It {{is related to the}} myth of the Changing Woman, a powerful figure in Apache culture who is believed to grant longevity. The power of Changing Woman is transferred to the pubescent girl through songs sung by the <b>Medicine</b> <b>Man.</b> A <b>medicine</b> <b>man</b> is joined by other tribal members in singing a series of songs, up to 32 which are believed to have first been sung by Changing Woman.|$|E

5|$|Black Elk (Lakota) was a <b>medicine</b> <b>man</b> and heyokha, {{whose life}} spanned the {{transition}} to reservations. His accounts of the 19th-century Indian Wars and Ghost Dance movement, and his deep thoughts on personal visions and Native American religion, {{form the basis of}} the book Black Elk Speaks, first published in 1932. (Among several editions, a premier annotated edition was published in 2008.) Paul Goble, an award-winning children's book author and illustrator, has been based in the Black Hills since 1977.|$|E
5|$|As hats {{go out of}} fashion, the {{anthropomorphic}} bear Popol the Hatter {{heads into}} the American West with his wife Virginia and blue donkey, Bluebell. Setting up camp {{in the land of}} the Bunnokee, a tribe of anthropomorphic rabbit Native Americans, he does good business there. This infuriates the Bunnokee <b>medicine</b> <b>man,</b> whose feather headdress business has declined as a result. He and the Chief of the Bunnokees conspire to eradicate the economic threat, launching war against Popol. Using technology that is more advanced than the Bunnokee's bow and arrows, Popol defeats the rabbits' initial attacks, but they retaliate by abducting Virginia and threatening to torture her. Popol then rescues her, and together they escape, coming upon a river in which they discover gold.|$|E
5|$|Wambui {{subsequently}} bore another son, Kongo, but Muigai died shortly after. In {{keeping with}} Kikuyu tradition, Wambui was then {{married to her}} late husband's younger brother, Ngengi. Kenyatta was then given the name of Kamau wa Ngengi ("Kamau, son of Ngengi"). Wambui bore her new husband a son, whom they also named Muigai. Ngengi was harsh and resentful toward these three boys, with Wambui deciding to take her youngest son with her {{to stay with her}} parental family further north. It was there that she died, and Kenyatta—who was very fond of the younger Muigai—travelled through the forest to collect his infant half-brother. Kenyatta then moved in with his grandfather, Kongo wa Magana, and assisted the latter in his role as a <b>medicine</b> <b>man.</b>|$|E

5|$|During Harrison's administration, the Lakota Sioux, {{previously}} {{confined to}} reservations in South Dakota, grew restive {{under the influence}} of Wovoka, a <b>medicine</b> <b>man,</b> who encouraged them to participate in a spiritual movement called the Ghost Dance. Many in Washington did not understand the predominantly religious nature of the Ghost Dance, and thought it was a militant movement being used to rally Native Americans against the government. On December 29, 1890, troops from the Seventh Cavalry clashed with the Sioux at Wounded Knee. The result was a massacre of at least 146 Sioux, including many women and children; the dead Sioux were buried in a mass grave. In reaction Harrison directed Major General Nelson A. Miles to investigate and ordered 3500 federal troops to South Dakota; the uprising was brought to an end. Wounded Knee is considered the last major American Indian battle in the 19th century. Harrison's general policy on American Indians was to encourage assimilation into white society and, despite the massacre, he believed the policy to have been generally successful. This policy, known as the allotment system and embodied in the Dawes Act, was favored by liberal reformers at the time, but eventually proved detrimental to American Indians as they sold most of their land at low prices to white speculators.|$|E
5|$|The {{bald eagle}} {{is a sacred}} bird in some North American cultures, and its feathers, {{like those of the}} golden eagle, are central to many {{religious}} and spiritual customs among Native Americans. Eagles are considered spiritual messengers between gods and humans by some cultures. Many pow wow dancers use the eagle claw as part of their regalia as well. Eagle feathers are often used in traditional ceremonies, particularly in the construction of regalia worn and as a part of fans, bustles and head dresses. In the Navajo Tradition an Eagle feather is represented to be a Protector, along with the Feather Navajo <b>Medicine</b> <b>Man</b> use the leg and wing bones for ceremonial whistles. The Lakota, for instance, give an eagle feather as a symbol of honor to person who achieves a task. In modern times, it may be given on an event such as a graduation from college. The Pawnee considered eagles as symbols of fertility because their nests are built high off the ground and because they fiercely protect their young. The Choctaw considered the bald eagle, who has direct contact with the upper world of the sun, as a symbol of peace.|$|E
25|$|After the Nooksack's <b>medicine</b> <b>man</b> {{was killed}} by an {{exploding}} 4th of July cannon, Holatchie, daughter of the Judsons' Nooksack neighbors Sally and Joe, became ill. Lacking a <b>medicine</b> <b>man,</b> Sally sent for the priest from the Lummi mission, who required the remuneration of a firearm and one cow for his visit. After the priest's departure, Judson, who acted as physician in the area, was inspired {{for the first time}} to evangelize to her neighbors. She explained the Protestant concepts of universal priesthood and divine grace, which Sally readily embraced.|$|E
2500|$|During Stewart’s time in Africa {{he learned}} a lot of {{valuable}} information about Africa and the natives' ways, for example, information about the medical properties of different plants. He also observed many <b>medicine</b> <b>men.</b> Stewart decided {{that the best way to}} treat Africans was by combining [...] Western medicine with their own practices, such as those of the <b>medicine</b> <b>men.</b> None of the missionaries who preceded James Stewart in South Africa, such as Dr. Venderkemp and Dr. Livingtsone, had focused on the medical aspect of missionary work. Stewart, however, felt that it was equally important.|$|R
5000|$|Authentic sandpaintings {{are rarely}} photographed, {{so as to}} not disrupt {{the flow of the}} ceremony. For many reasons, <b>medicine</b> <b>men</b> will seldom allow outsiders inside a sacred ceremony. Because so many outsiders are curious about sandpainting, some <b>medicine</b> <b>men</b> may create pieces for {{exhibition}} purposes only, using reversed colours and variations. To create an authentic sandpainting solely for viewing would be a profane act. The sandpaintings for sale in shops and on the Internet are commercially produced and contain deliberate errors, as the real sandpaintings are considered sacred.|$|R
60|$|These Indians have {{likewise}} their priests, or conjurers, or <b>medicine</b> <b>men,</b> who {{pretend to}} be in the confidence of the deities, and the expounders and enforcers of their will. Each of these <b>medicine</b> <b>men</b> has his idols carved in wood, representing the spirits of the air and of the fire, under some rude and grotesque form of a horse, a bear, a beaver, or other quadruped, or that of bird or fish. These idols are hung round with amulets and votive offerings, such as beavers' teeth, and bears' and eagles' claws.|$|R

25|$|Since it was {{perceived}} by the Maya that sickness was a punishment for a mistake or transgression, {{it was important that}} the healer inquire about details of the past of the sick person. This was done in a methodological fashion, first inquiring about ascriptive attributes, followed by specific events of the person’s life, and lastly about circumstantial or acquired attributes. This aspect of the medicine man’s job would be similar to a modern-day therapy session. In addition to ritualistic and spiritual elements, the <b>medicine</b> <b>man</b> had extensive knowledge of medicinal plants and how they should be used. After studying the symptoms of a sickness, a <b>medicine</b> <b>man</b> may prescribe a remedy to his patient. The number of times or days that the remedy should be ingested or applied depended on an individual’s gender; typically the number thirteen was associated with men, and the number nine with women.|$|E
