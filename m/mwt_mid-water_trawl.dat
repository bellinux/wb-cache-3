40|$|Even {{though the}} rich and {{variegated}} pelagic fishery resources of our west coast are well known much {{has to be done}} for a judicial and systematic exploitation on a commercial scale. To fill up this lacuna the present paper describes in detail a new design of 10. 5 m four-equal panel <b>mid-water</b> <b>trawl,</b> its rigging and operation from a medium size vessel. Comprehensive comparative efficiency studies of this gear with a 10. 5 m unequal panel <b>mid-water</b> <b>trawl</b> established the superiority of the new gear. From the results based on the mouth opening, resistance and the catch it is opined that this new gear can not only be used on a commercial scale in harvesting the seasonal pelagic fishery, but also as a secondary supporting gear in shrimp fishery in places like Veraval, where there is a commercially exploitable yield of quality fishes like hilsa, pomfret, seer etc., without much modification from conventional stern trawlers...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the diversity and}} distribution of two communities, micronekton organisms and large predatory fishes, sampled in mesoscale features of the Mozambique Channel from 2003 to 2009, by combining <b>mid-water</b> <b>trawls,</b> stomach contents of fish predators and instrumented longline fishing surveys. The highest species richness for assemblages was found in divergences and fronts {{rather than in the}} core of eddies. Despite an unbalanced scheme, diversity indices did not differ significantly between cyclonic and anticyclonic eddies, divergences and fronts. We found that eddies and associated physical cues did not substantially affect the distribution of micronektonic species which are mainly driven by the diel vertical migration pattern. Top predators exhibited a more complex response. Swordfish (Xiphias gladius) associated better with mesoscale features than tunas, with a clear preference for divergences which is consistent with the diel vertical migrations and occurrence of its main prey, the flying squids Sthenoteuthis oualaniensis (Ommastrephidae). On the other hand, the probability of presence of yellowfin tuna was not tied to any specific eddy structure. However, the highest values of positive yellowfin CPUEs were associated with low horizontal gradients of sea-level anomalies. We also showed a non-linear response of positive yellowfin CPUEs with respect to the depth of the minimal oxygen content. The larger the distance between the hooks and the minimal oxygen layer, towards the surface or at greater depths, the higher the CPUE, highlighting that yellowfin congregated in well-oxygenated waters. Micronekton sampled by <b>mid-water</b> <b>trawls</b> and stomach contents exhibited different species composition. The highly mobile organisms were not caught by trawling whereas they remain accessible to predators. The combination of stomach contents and <b>mid-water</b> <b>trawls</b> undoubtedly improved our understanding of the micronekton assemblage distribution. Our results provide some evidence that mesoscale features in the Mozambique Channel do not strongly affect the distribution of the mid-trophic level organisms such as micronekton and most of the large predatory fishes, and hypotheses are proposed to support this result...|$|R

40|$|In Division 3 O, primarily, redfish of {{two species}} Sebastes mentella and S. fasciatus are harvested. The bulk of catch (85 %) {{is made up}} by S. fasciatus. Calculations showed that with the change of mesh size from 132 mm to 88 mm in <b>mid-water</b> <b>trawls</b> in the redfish fishery the yield per recruit signi ficantly increased. When using mesh size of 118, 100 and 88 mm instead of 132 mm the largest yield per recruit would rise in 2. 2, 3. 1 and 3. 5 times and concern fish aged 14, 10 and 8 years, respectively. With {{reducing}} mesh size the total yield per recruit increased during the calculation period {{to the age of}} 18 years.

40|$|The {{existing}} population {{model for}} the horse-mackerel resource is extended to take commercial catch-at-length information from the <b>mid-water</b> <b>trawl</b> fishery and demersal surveys into account to allow the estimation of recruitment variations, which are correlated with the results for horse-mackerel abundance (considered to primarily reflect recruits) from the November pelagic surveys. Correlation is better with results for the West coast only from these surveys, rather than with those for the assessment area as a whole.

5|$|By-catch is the {{incidental}} {{capture of}} non-target species in fisheries. Fixed and drift gill nets cause the highest mortality levels for both cetaceans and pinnipeds, however, entanglements in long lines, <b>mid-water</b> <b>trawls,</b> and both trap and pot lines are also common. Tuna seines are particularly problematic for entanglement by dolphins. By-catch affects all cetaceans, both small and big, in all habitat types. However, smaller cetaceans and pinnipeds {{are most vulnerable}} as their size means that escape once they are entangled is highly unlikely and they frequently drown. While larger cetaceans are capable of dragging nets with them, the nets sometimes remain tightly attached to the individual and can impede the animal from feeding sometimes leading to starvation. Abandoned or lost nets and lines cause mortality through ingestion or entanglement. Marine mammals also get entangled in aquaculture nets, however, these are rare events and not prevalent enough to impact populations.|$|R

In October, the main food organisms were hyperiid amphipods (T. japonica). Stomach-content weight indices indicated that the feeding intensity of pollock was stronger in April (after spawning) than in October (before spawning). The numerical compositions of food categories in April differed among sampling stations. Such differences were not observed in October.

50|$|The 19th century saw {{increased}} demand for fish, which encouraged more indiscriminate methods of fishing such as bottom trawling to also catch demersal fish (fish living and feeding mainly on the seabed). During the 1880s, fish landings began to decline, and upon the recommendation of local fishers and scientists, the Firth of Clyde was closed to large trawling vessels in 1889. This closure remained in place until 1962 when bottom trawling for Norway lobster (Nephrops norvegicus) was approved in areas more than three nautical miles (nm) from the coast. During the 1960s and 1970s, landings of bottomfish increased as trawling intensified. The trawl closure within three nm of the coast was repealed in 1984 {{under pressure from the}} industry. Thereafter, bottomfish landings went into terminal decline, with all species collapsing to zero or near zero landings by the early 21st century. Herring fisheries collapsed in the 1970s as more efficient <b>mid-water</b> <b>trawls</b> and fish finders were introduced.|$|R
40|$|During the mid- 1980 {{s a major}} purse-seine fishery {{for small}} pelagic fishes, mainly jack {{mackerel}} (Trachurus declivis), developed off Tasmania. Catches exceeded 40, 000 t in the late 1980 s but were prone to large inter-annual fluctuations, due mainly to variation in the availability of surface schooling fish. By 2000 purse-seine fishing had effectively ceased, at which time industry commenced trialling <b>mid-water</b> <b>trawling</b> for small pelagics. Redbait (Emmelichthys nitidus), rather than jack mackerel, comprised {{the bulk of the}} trawl catch. Since the late 1980 s, the fishery has been managed using a combination of input and output controls, including a total allowable catch (TAC). The initial TAC was set at 42, 000 t, based on the highest purse-seine annual catch. The TAC was decreased to 34, 000 t (combined species TAC) for the 2002 - 03 and subsequent fishing seasons but without any scientific basis. At the same time the fishery had changed from a purse-seine fishery for jack mackerel to a <b>mid-water</b> <b>trawl</b> fishery primarily targeting redbait. Management of the fishery, which now forms part of the Commonwealth Small Pelagic Fishery (SPF), is currently under review but will be based on output controls (quotas). The primary objective {{of the present study was}} to evaluate the suitability of the daily egg production method (DEPM) for redbait. The DEPM is a fishery-independent method currently used worldwide to provide spawning biomass estimates of small pelagic fishes that are serial or batch spawners, i. e. release batches of pelagic eggs into the water column throughout the spawning season. The method assumes that the biomass of a fish population can be estimated from the daily production of eggs over the spawning area, the weight and proportion of females that spawned on a given day, and the average fecundity of each reproductively active female. As such, there are several characteristics relating to the reproductive biology, spawning dynamics and development of eggs that are prerequisites for the method. Redbait reproductive biology was examined from fish caught off eastern and south-western Tasmania. Redbait are batch spawners with asynchronous oocyte development and indeterminate fecundity, spawning over a discrete 2 - 3 month period during spring. Size at maturity varied markedly between eastern and south-western Tasmania, with south-west coast fish attaining 50...|$|R

Dworshak Dam discharged less water between July 1, 1992 and June 30, 1993 than any of our recent years of study (the lowest since 1986 - 1987). Based on a past relationship with an r{sup 2 }= 0. 62, we expected age 2 kokanee abundance to be very high with this low level of discharge. We estimated mature kokanee abundance by trawling, which correlated well (r{sup 2 }=. 89) to standardized spawner counts. This gives us the means to convert the older spawner count data into age 2 kokanee estimates. It is also a validation of spawner counts in tributary streams as an accurate method to obtain an index of adult kokanee abundance...|$|R

Dolphins and seals are also killed in fishing gear in Australian fisheries, particularly purse seine and trawl fisheries.

40|$|Incidental {{catches of}} {{cetaceans}} in the Dutch pelagic trawl fishery are largely restricted to late-winter early-spring {{in an area}} along the continental slope southwest of Ireland. Available evidence indicates that annual variations in such incidents are large. Using combined <b>mid-water</b> <b>trawl</b> by-catch and dolphin stomach content data, the hypothesis is put forward that Atlantic white-sided dolphin (Lagenorhynchus acutus), normally a more oceanic species, may actively search for mackerel (Scomber scombrus) closer to shore in early-spring, {{at least in some}} years. Supporting data were from an observer program during 1992 – 94, which covered seven trips representing 5 % of the annual effort in the fishery. Also over the period 1989 – 94, a total of 71 records of by-catch incidents were collected (involving a minimum of 312 individuals), of which 41 occured in 1994 (172 individuals). Approximately 90 % of the incidents occurred late-winter early-spring, when both the mackerel and horse mackerel (Trachurus trachurus) pelagic fisheries were operating in the same area, southwest of Ireland.

The fleet operates the year-round from eight harbours between Escondida Island and San Jorge Gulf (80 000 naut. miles 2). The important target species are: hake (Merluccius hubbsi), shortfin squid (IIlex argentinus) and shrimp (Pleoticus muelleri), while several tons of other fish are discarded.

40|$|Objective echoes {{identification}} {{is not possible}} nowadays when several species are present in an area. <b>Mid-water</b> <b>trawl</b> catches are usually used to split fish schools into species during acoustic surveys. Moreover it is weIl known that because of a lively behaviour {{of these types of}} species, the catchability may vary a lot from one species to another. Therefore, in order to verify the reliability of identification by trawling, 68 hauls carried out during 4 acoustic surveys (1991 - 1994) have been analysed. Five pelagic species (anchovy, mackerel, horse-mackerel, sprat and sardine), observed during these surveys in Bay of Biscay were considered. On the one hand, taking into account the vertical echo-sounder data and the vertical course of the trawl from nets onde data, a theoretical weight was calculated, and compared with the real catch. The results showed that catchability varied a lot between species and within species according to school structure. On the other hand, a vertical avoidance of fish was simulated by changing the vertical trawl position to approach the real catch and study specific behaviours which could bias the identification. As a result, it seems that trawl species compositions could be used with a better precision by applying a correcting factor according to specific catchabilities if completed by an aggregation classification...|$|R

This study examines spatial and temporal patterns in the species distribution of density, life cycle, population structure and diet using samples collected by <b>mid-water</b> <b>trawl</b> nets deployed in different seasons across the Scotia Sea. Virtually absent from the sea-ice zone, the species was most abundant in the northern Scotia Sea around the Georgia Basin at depths below 400 m that are associated with the Circumpolar Deep Water. The species migrated during night from waters deeper than 700 m to waters above the 400 m following their main prey species: the copepods Rhincalanus gigas and Calanoides acutus and euphausiids of the Thysanoessa genus. Larvae length distribution and post-larvae length-frequency analyses suggested a life cycle of ~ 3 years with spawning and recruitment strongly connected with APF and the South Georgia shelf.

Fish were caught with long-line and micronekton with an IKMT (Isaacs-Kidd <b>Mid-water</b> <b>Trawl).</b> 135 stomach contents and 30 tows have been analyzed. Istiophoridae and Thunnidae are opportunistic feeders, fish and crustaceans being the main components of the diet.

This observed biological relationship suggests that 1, 000 cfs of additional outflow would result in greater longfin smelt FMWT abundance (increase of 1 % of the abundance at 100, 000 cfs). The E/I ratio (during the period of biological effects from outflow on a fish species) can be used to track the percentage of the possible abundance in a year that would be lost from reduced outflow caused by exports.

In addition to censusing seabirds and mammals encountered on line transects, we characterized local oceanography. Zooplankton were sampled at the surface and with vertical tows. The relative abundance of zooplankton and fish biomass was measured using a dual-frequency echosounder. Significant acoustic targets were sampled with a <b>mid-water</b> <b>trawl</b> net. Long-lines were set to catch large demersal fish species and stomach samples from some of these fishes were analyzed to further characterize the marine food web. The Sitka Sound study area was interesting because transects of only 28 - 56 km in length extended from shallow coastal waters to a deep oceanic basin. Coastal habitat included shallow waters of less than 100 m, numerous islands and island passes, and numerous shoals, reefs and rocks; and was mostly in Sitka Sound. Shelf habitat included waters between 100 and 200 m in depth with relatively smooth bottom, which comprised a broad band running north to south outside Sitka Sound. Shelf-edge (slope) habitat (200 - 1500 m) extended offshore and ran the length of this shelf, and dee...|$|R
40|$|A <b>mid-water</b> <b>trawl</b> survey {{conducted}} between depths of 1000 and 3000 m {{in the eastern}} Gulf of Mexico found 54 % of the organisms collected were gonostomatid fishes. Lophogastrids within the family Eucopiidae were also common (17. 3 %), as were decapod shrimps within the families Oplophoridae and Benthesicymidae (9. 9 and 7. 1 % respectively). We examined the gut contents of 14 prominent species from this assemblage to determine if available food resources were partitioned. Cluster analysis of stomach contents resulted in 4 clusters based on taxonomic composition and 3 based on prey size. Bristlemouth fishes (Gonostomatidae) of the genus Cyclothone and lophogastrids of the genus Eucopia were planktivorous, consuming smaller prey items such as copepods and ostracods. Decapods within the family Oplophoridae tended to be piscivorous and consumed relatively large prey. Dendrobranchiate shrimps appeared to regularly consume detrital material, although the contribution of such material to the overall diet could not be quantified. The hatchetfish Sternoptyx pseudobscura had {{a large proportion of}} shallow-living taxa in its diet despite being non-migratory. Many of the bathypelagic species were found to be more piscivorous than mesopelagic counterparts within the same family or genus. Dietary overlap in both prey size and taxonomic composition was rare, occurring only 16. 5 % of the time. The most prevalent pattern (similar to 50 % of species pairings) was overlap in neither diet category, suggesting the species partitioned food resources...|$|R
40|$|Reprinted from Fishery bulletin, Vol. 75 (1), pages 173 - 183. Dover and {{rex sole}} larvae attain an {{exceptionally}} large size {{and have a}} long pelagic life. Dover sole larvae (9 - 65 mm standard length) were collected in <b>mid-water</b> <b>trawls</b> and plankton nets during all months of the year. Judging from growth of larvae and occurrence in bottom trawls of recently metamorphosed juveniles, Dover sole are pelagic during {{their first year of}} life. Large larvae (50 - 65 mm standard length) are probably pelagic for over a year and few apparently are recruited to benthic populations. Dover sole larvae were most common in oceanic waters beyond the continental slope and in the upper 50 m of the water column. The rex sole larvae captured were 5 - 89 mm long. Average size and stage of development of larvae increased from March through February, and juveniles were common on the bottom during winter on the outer shelf. Thus the pelagic phase usually lasts about a year. Both rex and Dover sole may utilize the outer continental shelf-upper slope region for a nursery during early benthic life. Petrale sole larvae (10 - 22 mm standard length) were rare. They were collected only from March to June and appear to have a pelagic life of about 6 mo. Age-group 0 juveniles, uncommon in bottom trawl collections, were only captured on the inner continental shelf in the fall...|$|R
40|$|Background: The Firth of Clyde {{is a large}} inlet of the {{sea that}} extends over 100 km into Scotland’s west coast. Methods: We {{compiled}} detailed fisheries landings data for this area and combined them with historical accounts to build a picture of change due to fishing activity over the last 200 years. Findings: In the early 19 th century, prior to the onset of industrial fishing, the Firth of Clyde supported diverse and productive fisheries for species such as herring (Clupea harengus, Clupeidae), cod (Gadus morhua, Gadidae), haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus, Gadidae), turbot (Psetta maxima, Scophthalmidae) and flounder (Platichthys flesus, Pleuronectidae). The 19 th century saw increased demand for fish, which encouraged more indiscriminate methods of fishing such as bottom trawling. During the 1880 s, fish landings began to decline, and upon the recommendation of local fishers and scientists, the Firth of Clyde was closed to large trawling vessels in 1889. This closure remained in place until 1962 when bottom trawling for Norway lobster (Nephrops norvegicus, Nephropidae) was approved in areas more than three nautical miles from the coast. During the 1960 s and 1970 s, landings of bottomfish increased as trawling intensified. The trawl closure within three nautical miles of the coast was repealed in 1984 {{under pressure from the}} industry. Thereafter, bottomfish landings went into terminal decline, with all species collapsing to zero or near zero landings by the early 21 st century. Herring fisheries collapsed in the 1970 s as more efficient <b>mid-water</b> <b>trawls</b> and fish finders were introduced, while...|$|R
40|$|IN ADDITION TO the fishes {{and faster}} {{swimming}} invertebrates (euphausiids, squids) usually ob-tained in midwater trawl collections, relatively large species of copepods are also frequently captured. Aside from Sewell's (1929) report of copepods found in six midwater collections {{made in the}} Ind ian Ocean, it has only been {{in recent years that}} midwate r trawl samples have been more or less systematically analyzed for copepods. From the Florida Current, off Miami, an area in which the copepods have been stud ied fairly extensively, Owre and Foyo (1964) re-ported that 21 calanoid species were found only in collections made by the Isaacs-Kidd midwater trawl (Isaacs and Kidd, 1953). Of these, 11 represented new records for the area. In the southwestern Indian Ocean, De Decker and Mombeck (1965) using both vertical plankton net and midwater fish trawl found 274 species of copepods. Of these the fish trawl accounted for 115 species including 43 which were not found in the plankton net collections. In the western Indian Ocean Grice and Hulsemann (1967) studied a series of 30 plankton net and 21 midwater trawl collections obtained between 18 °N and 40 0 S. In the midwater trawl col-lections were found 64 species not present in the plankton net collections, including representa-tives of all eight species of the family Mega-calanidae. It thus appears that midwater nets constitute a valuable additional means of sam-pling the calanoid copepod fauna in an open ocean area, and it is hoped that those interested in copepods will examine any available <b>mid-water</b> <b>trawl</b> samples. The samples examined in this study wer...|$|R
