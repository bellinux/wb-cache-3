5|$|Taiko {{performance}} styles {{vary widely}} across groups {{in terms of}} the number of performers, repertoire, instrument choices, and stage techniques. Nevertheless, a number of early groups have had broad influence on the tradition. For instance, <b>many</b> <b>pieces</b> developed by Ondekoza and Kodo are considered standard in many taiko groups.|$|E
5|$|Viruses are green, (red in Rush mode in the iOS mobile version) spiky {{circles that}} split cells larger than them into <b>many</b> <b>pieces</b> (16 or fewer, {{depending}} on the mass) and smaller cells can hide underneath a virus for protection against larger cells. Cells in 16 pieces can eat viruses without splitting, though it is usually dangerous moving in <b>many</b> <b>pieces,</b> as the cells are smaller and easier to eat.. Viruses are normally randomly generated, but players can make new viruses by feeding a virus, i.e. ejecting {{a small fraction of}} a player's cell's mass into the virus a few times, causing the virus to split and hence create another virus.|$|E
5|$|After the French {{defeat at}} Waterloo, the works' former owners sought their return. The Louvre's administrators were loath to comply and hid many works {{in their private}} collections. In response, foreign states sent emissaries to London to seek help, and <b>many</b> <b>pieces</b> were returned, even some that had been {{restored}} by the Louvre. In 1815 Louis XVIII finally concluded agreements with the Austrian government for the keeping of pieces such as Veronese's Wedding at Cana which was exchanged for a large Le Brun or the repurchase of the Albani collection.|$|E
50|$|Peter Bamm {{published}} <b>many</b> journalistic <b>pieces,</b> <b>many</b> of them extremely {{witty and}} ironic. He also wrote scientific and medical essays, culture-historical travel books and an autobiography.|$|R

50|$|Provazník wrote <b>many</b> musical <b>pieces,</b> both {{chamber and}} popular music.|$|R
5|$|An {{international}} {{style in}} art {{did not exist}} in Qatna; instead, a regional hybrid style prevailed where international motifs appear along with regional ones, yet all the pieces reveal enough features to trace them to Qatna. The volute-shaped plant {{is one of the most}} widespread international motifs; <b>many</b> <b>pieces</b> from the royal hypogeum were decorated with the motif, but Qatna had its own typical volute, where the crown is a single long lobe with dotted pendants branching out of the corners of the upper volute. The wall painting in Qatna's royal palace attests to contact with the Aegean region; they depict typical Minoan motifs such as palm trees and dolphins.|$|E
5|$|During {{his years}} in the law, Mercer used his {{substantial}} income to support the arts and amassed a large art collection including <b>many</b> <b>pieces</b> by Carl Ahrens, of whom Mercer {{was a close friend}} and admirer. This art collection was auctioned off in 1925 and was found to contain a selection of art, porcelain, sculpture and antique furniture from around the globe. Mercer was also a keen amateur painter himself and was also an excellent sportsman who represented Canada and the Canadian Army in shooting contests both at home and in Britain.|$|E
5|$|The {{symmetry}} {{on earth}} mirrors the symmetric perfection of heaven. The purpose {{of art at}} this time—in architecture, the visual arts, and music—was not to create something entirely new, but to reflect this divine perfection, {{and in this way}} to praise God. We find such a symmetric outline in <b>many</b> <b>pieces</b> by Johann Sebastian Bach,19 but only in a few cases is this outline as consequent as in the B Minor Mass. The parts Kyrie, Gloria and Credo are all designed with choral sections as the outer movements, framing an intimate center of theological significance.|$|E

5|$|Welds can be geometrically {{prepared}} {{in many different}} ways. The five basic types of weld joints are the butt joint, lap joint, corner joint, edge joint, and T-joint (a variant of this last is the cruciform joint). Other variations exist as well—for example, double-V preparation joints are characterized by the two pieces of material each tapering to a single center point at one-half their height. Single-U and double-U preparation joints are also fairly common—instead of having straight edges like the single-V and double-V preparation joints, they are curved, forming {{the shape of a}} U. Lap joints are also commonly more than two pieces thick—depending on the process used and the thickness of the material, <b>many</b> <b>pieces</b> can be welded together in a lap joint geometry.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to coronations, the Imperial State Crown is usually worn at State Openings of Parliament, where the Sword of State and two maces are carried in procession. Fonts are used at royal christenings, and altar plate {{is used for}} weddings, Royal Maundy, {{and a few other}} occasions. <b>Many</b> <b>pieces</b> have fallen out of use altogether, like the trumpets and banqueting plate, and some were only designed to be used once. When not in use the Jewels are on public display, mainly in the Jewel House, a vault at the Tower of London where they are seen by around 2.5million visitors from across the world every year. Although {{they are part of the}} Royal Collection and owned by the king or queen for the duration of his or her reign, the Crown Jewels do not belong to the monarch personally.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} summer of 1920, a total of 50,028 Maine Centennial half dollars were {{produced}} at the Philadelphia Mint, including 28 pieces reserved for inspection and testing at the 1921 meeting of the annual Assay Commission. No special care was taken in the minting; they were ejected into bins and many display bag marks. They were sent to Maine and placed on sale through the Office of the State Treasurer at a price of $1. Thirty thousand sold immediately and they remained on sale through the treasurer's office until all fifty thousand were vended, though this did not happen until at least 1929. Bowers speculated that had the full 100,000 authorized coins been struck, most of the additional quantity would have been returned to the Mint and melted for lack of buyers. <b>Many</b> <b>pieces</b> were spent {{in the years after}} 1920 and entered circulation.|$|E

50|$|The {{plates are}} popular in villages in arid region in India like parts of Andhra Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Jharkhand, Odisha, West Bengal, Karnataka, Telangana etc. The banyan tree, Butea monosperma, amongst others provide leaves {{that are used}} either with <b>many</b> <b>pieced</b> {{together}} or singly (only {{in case of a}} banana leaf) to make a leaf-plate for serving a meal.|$|R
5|$|The hoard {{contains}} about 100 silver and silver-gilt items; {{the number is}} imprecise because there are unmatched broken parts. They include a statuette of a leaping tigress, made as a handle for an object such as a jug or lamp; four pepper-pots (piperatoria); a beaker; a vase or juglet (a small jug); four bowls; a small dish; and 98 silver spoons and ladles. The beaker and juglet are decorated with similar leaf and stem patterns, and the juglet has three gilded bands. In contrast, the small bowls and dish are plain, and it is presumed that {{the owners of the}} Hoard had many more such items, probably including the large decorated dishes found in other hoards. <b>Many</b> <b>pieces</b> are gilded in parts to accentuate the decoration. The technique of fire-gilding with mercury was used, as was typical at the time.|$|E
5|$|The {{impact of}} the frieze may be sought in the Attic relief {{sculpture}} of the late fifth century; this resonance also may be discovered to some degree in the public works of the Hephaisteion frieze and the Nike Athena balustrade, where the imagery of the seated deities and the sandal-binder respectively, likely owes a debt to the Parthenon. There also are traces found on the private commissions of grave stelae from the period, for example, the “cat stele” from Aegina bears a distinct similarity to figures N135–6. As does the Hermes of the four-figure relief known from a Roman copy. Later classicizing art of the Hellenistic and Roman eras also looked to the frieze for inspiration as attested by the Lycian Sarcophagus of Sidon, Phoenicia, the Ara Pacis Augustae, the Gemma Augustea, and <b>many</b> <b>pieces</b> of the Hadrianic generation.|$|E
25|$|The Cloisters Cross is {{an unusually}} large ivory crucifix, with complex carving {{including}} many figures of prophets and others, which {{has been attributed to}} one of the relatively few artists whose name is known, Master Hugo, who also illuminated manuscripts. Like <b>many</b> <b>pieces</b> it was originally partly coloured. The Lewis chessmen are well-preserved examples of small ivories, of which <b>many</b> <b>pieces</b> or fragments remain from croziers, plaques, pectoral crosses and similar objects.|$|E
