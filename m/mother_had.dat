40|$|Introduction: The present {{research}} aimed to compare anxiety and hope between <b>mothers</b> <b>having</b> children suffering from autism syndrome and Down syndrome. Methods: This research used a descriptive-comparative method and {{the sample of}} the study included 60 <b>mothers</b> <b>having</b> children suffering from autism and down syndromes.
