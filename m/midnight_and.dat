5|$|A {{team from}} Argonne {{was on hand}} for {{powering}} up the first reactor at the Hanford Site, where large reactors would produce plutonium for bombs.

While the Marshalls were babysitting the reactor in Hanford, they left Peter with Leona's mother.|$|E
5|$|Fears in Solitude {{was written}} after {{rumors of a}} French {{invasion}} spread across England. Although Coleridge was opposed to Prime Minister William Pitt's control over the British government, he sided with his homeland. He began work on the poem during April 1798 and it {{was first published in}} a small pamphlet along with Frost at <b>Midnight</b> <b>and</b> France: An Ode. It was eventually printed seven times with a later printing removing any anti-Pitt sentiment.|$|E
5|$|Following the 2006 edition, Dick Clark Productions {{announced}} that Seacrest {{had agreed to}} remain a host for future editions of New Year's Rockin' Eve.

5|$|Immediately {{following}} the raid, the five Japanese fleet submarines {{that carried the}} midget submarines to Australia embarked on a campaign to disrupt merchant shipping in eastern Australian waters. Over the next month, the submarines attacked at least seven merchant vessels, sinking three ships and killing 50 sailors. During this period, between <b>midnight</b> <b>and</b> 02:30 on 8 June, two of the submarines bombarded the ports of Sydney and Newcastle.|$|E
5|$|South of the river, the Poles {{prepared}} for another crossing. That night, they awaited {{the arrival of}} assault boats from XXX Corps, but these did not arrive until after <b>midnight,</b> <b>and</b> many were without oars. The crossings started at 03:00, with fire support from the 43rd Wessex Division. Through the remaining hours of darkness, only 153 men were able to cross– less than ¼ of the hoped for reinforcement.|$|E
5|$|Though quite agile on land (capable {{of running}} {{as fast as}} a horse), capybaras are equally at home in the water. They are {{excellent}} swimmers, and can remain completely submerged for up to five minutes, an ability they use to evade predators. Capybaras can sleep in water, keeping only their noses out of the water. As temperatures increase during the day, they wallow in water and then graze during the late afternoon and early evening. They also spend time wallowing in mud. They rest around <b>midnight</b> <b>and</b> then continue to graze before dawn.|$|E

5|$|A {{large part}} of the {{population}} of the Northern states believed that the Davis government was somehow involved in the assassination of Abraham Lincoln, and although there was no evidence of their complicity, it was a political reality that had to be dealt with. One result was that the political radicals were able to force the government to prosecute those who had led the war against the Union. Mallory was one of the Confederate leaders who were charged with treason, among other things; on May 20, 1865, while he was still at La Grange, he was roused from his sleep at about <b>midnight</b> <b>and</b> taken into custody. From there he was taken to Fort Lafayette in New York Harbor, where he was confined as a political prisoner.|$|E
5|$|He {{took this}} {{development}} {{to a new}} level with his 1953 orchestral work Réveil des oiseaux—its material consists almost entirely of the birdsong one might hear between <b>midnight</b> <b>and</b> noon in the Jura. From this period onwards, Messiaen incorporated birdsong into all of his compositions and composed several works for which birds provide both the title and subject matter (for example the collection of thirteen pieces for piano Catalogue d'oiseaux completed in 1958, and La fauvette des jardins of 1971). Paul Griffiths observed that Messiaen was a more conscientious ornithologist than any previous composer, and a more musical observer of birdsong than any previous ornithologist.|$|E
5|$|Jordan {{originally}} intended to finish the series in a single volume titled A Memory of Light, but when Sanderson began writing the book it became clear a split was required as it was believed a single volume would be too large to print. The expected final book was then split into three volumes: The Gathering Storm, Towers of <b>Midnight,</b> <b>and</b> A Memory of Light. The books would be published a year apart with the first volume, The Gathering Storm, published on October 27, 2009; a week earlier than originally announced. Upon its release, it immediately rose to the No. 1 position on The New York Times hardcover fiction Best Seller list, making it the fifth consecutive Wheel of Time book to achieve this feat.|$|E

5|$|Late in the night, Thảo and Phát {{met with}} Kỳ {{in a meeting}} {{organized}} by the Americans, and insisted that Khanh be removed from power. The coup collapsed when, between <b>midnight</b> <b>and</b> dawn, anti-coup forces swept into the city; it was generally thought that the rebels did not {{put up a fight}} after being assured that Khánh would be ousted. Early in the morning, Thi, who gained the support of Kỳ, proposed a motion within the junta to remove Khánh and force him into exile, and the final vote was unanimous—Khanh was absent from the meeting. Kỳ, Thi and Thiệu then became the key figures in a junta that continued with Sửu and Prime Minister Phan Huy Quát as a civilian front, although General Minh became the nominal commander-in-chief of the armed forces.|$|E
5|$|Like other rails, the Crex {{species have}} {{a wide range of}} vocalisations. The males of both crakes have a loud {{territorial}} and advertising call consisting of a series of grating notes repeated {{two or three times a}} second for several minutes. The male stands upright with his neck extended when advertising, with its head and neck almost vertical and bill wide open. Calling is most frequent early in the breeding season, mainly at night for the corn crake, but in the day for its African cousin. The corn crake's call may be repeated more than 20,000 times a night, with a peak between <b>midnight</b> <b>and</b> 3am.|$|E
5|$|Starting July 28, 2012, Metrorail {{increased}} service along shared Green and Orange Line stations from Dadeland South to Earlington Heights Stations. Along {{this stretch}} of shared track, trains arrive every 5 minutes during peak hours, every 7 minutes during mid-day hours, and every 15 minutes late nights and on weekends. At stations with only one service, trains arrive every 10 minutes during weekday rush hours, every 15 minutes at midday, and every 15–30 minutes after 6 p.m. until midnight with weekend service running every 30 minutes. Metrorail runs from 5 a.m. until midnight seven days a week. For a brief period from 2003 to April 2004 there was 24-hour service supported by the transit tax; between <b>midnight</b> <b>and</b> 5 a.m. trains arrived every 60 minutes.|$|E
