5|$|From the 1980s Scottish {{literature}} enjoyed {{another major}} revival, particularly {{associated with a}} group of Glasgow writers focused around meetings in the house of critic, poet and teacher Philip Hobsbaum. Also important in the movement was Peter Kravitz, editor of Polygon Books. Members of the group that would come to prominence as writers included James Kelman, Alasdair Gray, Liz Lochhead, Tom Leonard and Aonghas MacNeacail. In the 1990s major, prize-winning, Scottish novels that emerged from this movement included Irvine Welsh's Trainspotting (1993), Warner's Morvern Callar (1995), Gray's Poor Things (1992) and Kelman's How Late It Was, How Late (1994). These works were linked by a sometimes overtly political reaction to Thatcherism that explored <b>marginal</b> <b>areas</b> of experience and used vivid vernacular language (including expletives and Scots dialect). Scottish crime fiction has been a major area of growth with the success of novelists including Val McDermid, Frederic Lindsay, Christopher Brookmyre, Quintin Jardine, Denise Mina and particularly the success of Edinburgh's Ian Rankin and his Inspector Rebus novels. This period also saw {{the emergence of a new}} generation of Scottish poets that became leading figures on the UK stage, including Don Paterson, Robert Crawford, Kathleen Jamie and Carol Ann Duffy. Glasgow-born Carol Ann Duffy was named as Poet Laureate in May 2009, the first woman, the first Scot and the first openly gay poet to take the post.|$|E
25|$|Following World War I, {{large numbers}} of ex-soldiers from Australia, along {{with a number of}} British veterans, took up farming within Western Australia, often in <b>marginal</b> <b>areas.</b> With the onset of the Great Depression in 1929, these farmers were {{encouraged}} to increase their wheat crops, with the government promising—and failing to deliver—assistance in the form of subsidies. In spite of the recommendations and the promised subsidies, wheat prices continued to fall, and by October 1932 matters were becoming intense, with the farmers preparing to harvest the season's crop while simultaneously threatening to refuse to load the wheat.|$|E
25|$|The need {{to include}} fresh plant food or raw animal flesh in the diet to prevent disease was known from ancient times. Native people living in <b>marginal</b> <b>areas</b> {{incorporated}} this into their medicinal lore. For example, spruce needles were used in temperate zones in infusions, or the leaves from species of drought-resistant trees in desert areas. In 1536, the French explorers Jacques Cartier and Daniel Knezevic, exploring the St. Lawrence River, used the local natives' knowledge to save his men who were dying of scurvy. He boiled the needles of the arbor vitae tree to make a tea that was later shown to contain 50mg of vitamin C per 100grams.|$|E

25|$|An {{example of}} this support is the {{agreement}} signed in September 2009 by the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) to provide a loan for up to $60 million for the North Lima Metropolitan Area Water Supply and Sewerage Optimization Project. The purpose of the project {{is to improve the}} quality of water and sanitation services by renovating the water supply network and improving its operation and management. It aims at reducing non-revenue water and increasing the continuity of water supply. The project complements another JICA-supported project to build a water treatment plant, water distribution systems, and sewerage systems in <b>marginal</b> <b>areas</b> of the same place.|$|E
25|$|For {{several centuries}} of the Medieval era, the {{vineyards}} of Germany (including Alsace) expanded, and {{is believed to}} have reached their greatest extent sometime around 1500, when perhaps as much as four times the present vineyard surface was planted. Basically, the wine regions were located in the same places as today, but more lands around the rivers, and land further upstream Rhine's tributaries, was cultivated. The subsequent decline can be attributed to locally produced beer becoming the everyday beverage in northern Germany in the 16th century, leading to a partial loss of market for wine, to the Thirty Years' War ravaging Germany in the 17th century, to the dissolution of the monasteries, where much of the wine-making know-how was concentrated, in those areas that accepted the Protestant reformation, and to the climatic changes of the Little Ice Age that made viticulture difficult or impossible in <b>marginal</b> <b>areas.</b>|$|E
25|$|Olives are not {{native to}} the Americas. Spanish colonists brought the olive to the New World, where its {{cultivation}} prospered in present-day Peru and Chile. The first seedlings from Spain were planted in Lima by Antonio de Rivera in 1560. Olive tree cultivation quickly spread along the valleys of South America's dry Pacific coast where the climate {{was similar to the}} Mediterranean. Spanish missionaries established the tree in the 18th century in California. It was first cultivated at Mission San Diego de Alcalá in 1769 or later around 1795. Orchards were started at other missions, but in 1838, an inspection found only two olive orchards in California. Cultivation for oil gradually became a highly successful commercial venture from the 1860s onward. In Japan, the first successful planting of olive trees happened in 1908 on Shodo Island, which became the cradle of olive cultivation. An estimated 865 million olive trees are in the world today (as of 2005), {{and the vast majority of}} these are found in Mediterranean countries, with traditionally <b>marginal</b> <b>areas</b> accounting for no more than 25% of olive-planted area and 10% of oil production.|$|E

500|$|According to the Augusto César Sandino Foundation, {{the most}} {{affected}} were [...] "inhabitants of small poor communities who live from diverse subsistence activities. Their houses, located beside the sea, were almost entirely destroyed.

500|$|Additionally, {{conservation}} {{efforts of the}} red maple have caused a major increase in the population of white-tailed deer since the mid-20th century. Deer will readily consume acorns, but leave maple seeds untouched, thus reducing the ability of oaks to regenerate compared to maples. [...] Because it can grow {{on a variety of}} substrates, has a high pH tolerance, and grows in both shade and sun, A. rubrum can be called a [...] "super-generalist," [...] and it is predicted to replace historically dominant tree species in the eastern United States such as [...] oaks, hickorys and pines. Extensive use of red maple in landscaping has also contributed to the surge in the species' numbers as volunteer seedlings proliferate. Finally, disease epidemics have greatly reduced the population of elms and chestnuts in the forests of the US. While mainline forest trees continue to dominate mesic sites with rich soil, more <b>marginal</b> <b>areas</b> are increasingly being dominated by red maple.|$|E

2500|$|Tijuana {{today is}} {{one of the fastest growing}} cities in Mexico with an average of 80,000 people moving to Tijuana yearly. [...] In terms of area, the city grows by {{approximately}} three hectares a day, mostly east and south as the city is mostly built out to the beach already with the exception of some canyons. [...] Along with settlements separated from Tijuana proper and other communities unimproved land, big business moves in providing supermarkets and retail to <b>marginal</b> <b>areas,</b> along with paved roads. [...] The city experiences the construction of 26,000 new settlers a year that has led to the unregulated, illegal squatter homes that takes place in the hills and valleys of ever expanding Tijuana, most of these areas are yet to be served by city services, including the addition of sidewalks, paving, streetlights, public transit and other services. [...] However this is an ongoing process; as older and existing squatter areas are brought into the city services, more <b>marginal</b> <b>areas</b> become occupied by squatters.|$|E
2500|$|To {{distinguish}} the Bruli-speaking descendants of Canarian settlers from the Saint Bernard Isleños, (the {{only ones who}} really call themselves [...] "Isleños"), Samuel G. Armistead, a prominent ethnographer, linguist, folklorist, and historian who did field work among the Isleño communities, prefers to call the people themselves [...] "Brulis". Originally they were mostly truck farmers, and they later found work on the large sugarcane plantations that formed in the 1860s, which meant the end of small farming in <b>marginal</b> <b>areas.</b> Some of {{the inhabitants of the}} eastern region emigrated to Cuba, where they founded Nuevitas.|$|E
2500|$|However, the {{boundaries}} of the proposed county of Cleveland were considerably altered, with a number of <b>marginal</b> <b>areas</b> removed. Under the revised scheme, the Teesside district would have 70 percent of the county's population, and it was felt that it would dominate the county. Accordingly, new guidelines were issued to the Local Boundaries Commission in March 1972 that was charged with drawing up district boundaries: Cleveland [...] "should be divided into not less than four new districts with populations comparable as is reasonably practicable having regard in particular to the pattern of local government before the establishment of the Teesside county borough".|$|E

2500|$|Băieți de gașcă, which {{comprises}} 11 short stories, {{is noted}} for its alternation of purist aesthetics and challenging use of Romanian slang, while its attempt to isolate pieces of the everyday creates a link with reportage. This approach to storytelling is likened by Bogdan Crețu with the prose of Alexandru Monciu-Sudinski, while Cristian Teodorescu connects it with J. D. Salinger's Nine Stories and the poetry of Emil Brumaru. Noting the difficulties of this approach, particularly in those stories which explore the <b>marginal</b> <b>areas</b> of Romanian society, Crețu commends Dan Lungu for opting in favor of first-person narratives written from within, which allow him to preserve the authenticity of uncultured or ungrammatical speech. In Teodorescu's account, the author [...] "grows so close to his characters that he ends up completely inside their skins. He takes {{the voice of a}} little girl shocked by the brutality of family life and the promiscuity of life in a block apartment. Or he turns himself into a gang boy and recounts his experiences in argotic language, which does not shy away from any of the words censored out of the latest Dicționarul explicativ al limbii române edition." [...] Daniel Cristea-Enache highlights the individualized use of language and gestures, from the [...] "infantile repetitiousness" [...] characteristic of little girls to the [...] "style of tricky young men", believing these traits to be in line with [...] "the exploitation of orality" [...] by authors such as Sorin Stoica and Ovidiu Verdeș.|$|E
