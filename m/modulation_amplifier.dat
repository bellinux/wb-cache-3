40|$|Abstract — Since the xDSL {{specifications}} impose stringent {{linearity requirements}} {{to ensure the}} integrity of the data transferred, current line drivers use linear amplifiers. The downside of these solutions is their power consumption, as the xDSL modulation has a high peak to average ratio, forcing the amplifier to operate in its least efficient region. An alternative is the use of switching amplifiers, which theoretically have an efficiency of 100 %. However, the nonlinear nature of these amplifiers complicates the design. To meet the linearity requirements, the switching frequency should be sufficiently high, but as this is limited by the technology used, additional techniques must be adopted. Therefor, a self-oscillating topology has been chosen and a mathematical model of the loop formulated to predict its behaviour. The model is then validated by numerical simulations on macro-blocks, yielding the values required for an implementation on silicon.

This paper presents {{an analysis of the}} supply rejection properties of RF amplifiers. We extend a conventional Volterra-series formulation to treat multiport systems and use it to describe the mixing products between power supply noise and the RF carrier. It is shown that a multiport Volterra formulation can be used to treat weak nonlinearities in the system and that the nonsymmetric cross terms accurately predict low-order mixing phenomenon. We demonstrate the validity of our hand analysis through the design and fabrication of a power amplifier in 180 -nm CMOS, operating between 900 MHz– 2. 4 GHz with a maximum output power of 15 dBm. Spectral regrowth of singletone and EDGE modulation waveforms is shown to match within 1 - 3 dB across frequency and input signal power.

In the simulations two wavelength-channels were added and dropped, and the effect of a failure of one channel was investigated by monitoring the power of the remaining channel. We found that the rising-speed of the remaining channel power increases with the pass to drop power-ratio (which is actually the crosstalk to signal power-ratio, XSR). This means that a gain control to compensate for the power-fluctuations needs to be faster when EDFAs are configured in a ring-structure instead of a chain with the same number of EDFAs. The dynamic behaviour of EDFAs in a ring-structure converges to that of EDFAs in a chain when the XSR reaches zero...|$|R
