2500|$|Ana Matronic ran {{a weekly}} cabaret event known as Knock Off {{at a club}} called the Slipper Room in New York, where she liked to hire {{eccentric}} and alternative acts; one reporter {{described it as a}} place that [...] "served up a racy, multigender revue of kitsch," [...] and that a performer dressed as a giant vulva [...] "enfolded <b>me</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> labia while singing [...] "Lick Me in My Wet Spot" [...] to the tune of [...] "Hit Me With Your Best Shot"." [...] Matronic invited the pair to appear at Knock Off, which they did on September 21, 2001. Shears dressed as his character [...] "Jason the Amazing Back-Alley Late Term Abortion" [...] whilst Matronic, dressed as a reject from Andy Warhol's Factory, joined the pair on stage and sang. Shears and Babydaddy felt she was very effective and asked her to join the band on a permanent basis, to which she agreed.|$|E
2500|$|In 1633 Maria Eleonora {{returned}} to Sweden with the embalmed body of her husband. In Nyköping, 7-year-old Queen Christina came in solemn procession {{to the ship}} to receive her mother. Later she wrote: [...] "I embraced the queen my mother, she drowned <b>me</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> tears and practically smothered me in her arms." [...] For {{more than a year}} Maria Eleonora condemned the active, spirited little Queen to an appalling mourning seclusion in rooms draped with black and lit by candles day and night, from which every ray of light was excluded. She made her daughter sleep with her in a bed over which her father's heart was hung in a golden casket. Things were made worse by Maria Eleonora's continual weeping. Christina, who was herself somewhat malformed with one shoulder higher than the other, also detested her mother's dwarfs and buffoons. She became seriously ill; an ulcer appeared on her left breast, causing her terrible pain and a high fever until it burst. In the summer of 1634 the funeral procession finally wound its way to Stockholm. Queen Christina later wrote about her mother: [...] "She carried out her role of mourning to perfection." ...|$|E

2500|$|Hamilton {{was raised}} in Harlem, New York, Hamilton was exposed to music at an early age. [...] "My mother was an {{entertainment}} journalist for the Cleveland Call and Post, so she would take <b>me</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> to events when I was just a baby." [...] Hamilton stated his mother always made sure he had an instrument around him. His mother put different kinds of instruments {{in the basement of}} their Cleveland home, but he naturally gravitated to the keyboard. Hamilton has stated, [...] "At first, I was just playing the rhythm of the songs I would hear... The older I got, the more proficient I got at hearing the notes." [...] For most of his life, Hamilton was self-taught. Picking up the lead and bass guitar in his teenage years, as well as the drums and harmonica. Hamilton has stated that listening to other genres of music, being exposed to different cultures and experiencing life helped mold his musical sound. Hamilton would leave from his mother's home at the age of 18 and would at times be homeless spending his nights at his friends houses.|$|E
2500|$|The persuasive {{power of}} {{language}} is first alluded to by Charles, who tells Joan after she has assured him she can end {{the siege of}} Orléans, [...] "Thou hast astonished me with thy high terms" [...] (1.2.93). This sense is repeated when the Countess of Auvergne is wondering about Talbot and says to her servant, [...] "Great is the rumour of this dreadful knight,/And his achievements of no less account./Fain would mine eyes be witness with mine ears,/To give their censure of these rare reports" [...] (2.3.7–10). Like Charles, Auvergne has been astonished with the 'high terms' bestowed on Talbot, and now she wishes {{to see if the}} report and the reality conflate. Later in the play, the persuasive power of language becomes important for Joan, as she uses it as a subterfuge to sneak into Rouen, telling her men, [...] "Be wary how you place your words;/Talk like the vulgar sort of market men/That come to gather money for their corn" [...] (3.2.3.5). Later, she uses language to persuade Burgundy to join with the Dauphin against the English. As Burgundy realises he is succumbing to her rhetoric, he muses to himself, [...] "Either she hath bewitched <b>me</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> words,/Or nature makes me suddenly relent" [...] (3.3.58–59). Here, language is shown to be so powerful as to act on Burgundy the same way Nature itself would act, {{to the point where he}} is unsure if he has been persuaded by a natural occurrence or by Joan's words. Language is thus presented as capable of transforming ideology. As Joan finishes her speech, Burgundy again attests to the power of her language, [...] "I am vanquish'd. These haughty words of hers/Have battered me like roaring canon-shot,/And made me almost yield upon my knees" [...] (3.3.78–80). Later, something similar happens with Henry, who agrees to marry Margaret merely because of Suffolk's description of her. In a line that echoes Burgundy's, Henry queries what it is that has prompted him to agree to Suffolk's suggestion: [...] "Whether it be through force of your report,/My noble lord of Suffolk, or for that/My tender youth was never yet attaint/With any passion of inflaming love, I cannot tell" [...] (5.6.79–83). Here, again, the power of language is shown to be so strong as to be confused with a natural phenomenon.|$|E
