50|$|WiRED International’s mission became {{focused on}} <b>medical</b> <b>and</b> <b>health</b> <b>education</b> {{as a result}} of the clear needs evident in Kosovo. A year later, with a National Institutes of Health {{developmental}} grant, WiRED began HIV/AIDS education programs across Kenya and then in Sierra Leone. The work expanded to all medical and health concerns, and today through partnerships, WiRED programs are in several African countries and in parts of China, Central and South America, the Middle East, Melanesia and Eurasia. In spring 2003 the State Department asked Dr. Selnow to travel to Baghdad with a representative of its U.S. Global Technology Corps to explore how WiRED could most effectively deliver medical training programs to Iraqi doctors. In June 2003, after reviewing field conditions and talking with U.S officials, Iraqi physicians and medical educators, WiRED launched the first technology-based medical training program in the country, starting with the opening of a facility in Iraq’s Medical City Center. Within 18 months the organization had set up 39 centers around Iraq. Several years later WiRED launched the country’s first telemedicine program. Technical problems with satellite availability in the war zone made that program difficult, and it never fully matured. WiRED’s work in Iraq ended in 2010, as the U.S. commitment was winding down. In 2011, as WiRED’s ground programs expanded elsewhere, it began development of its own educational training materials. The program evolved, in 2013, into the Center for the Development and Distribution of Health Education Programs. This resource supplies <b>medical</b> <b>and</b> <b>health</b> <b>education</b> modules via the Internet and portable storage media. It allows partners or any interested NGO to store training modules on thumb drives and laptops and sync them to acquire updates. The result has been a broad distribution of health education programs, even in the most remote areas. Now in 2014, WiRED has evolved into a health education hub operating in remote and resource-starved regions globally. WiRED collects intellectual content from physicians, nurses and medical educators from around the world. WiRED packages and translates it, when appropriate, and distributes it widely. This clearinghouse model has enabled many medical professionals to contribute to the program, and it has provided a source of health content for people in places isolated and often ignored.|$|E

40|$|There is {{no doubt}} that gender bias has been {{inherent}} in <b>medical</b> <b>and</b> public <b>health</b> <b>education,</b> research, <b>and</b> clinical practice. This paper discusses the central question for <b>medical</b> <b>and</b> public <b>health</b> educators viz. whether women's <b>health</b> concerns <b>and</b> needs could be best addressed by the conventional biomedical approach to <b>medical</b> <b>and</b> public <b>health</b> <b>education,</b> research, <b>and</b> practice. Gender inequalities in <b>health</b> <b>and</b> gender bias in <b>medical</b> <b>and</b> public <b>health</b> <b>education</b> are revealed. It is found that in most public <b>health</b> <b>and</b> prevention issues related to women's health, the core issue is male-female power relations, and not merely the lack of public health services, medical technology, or information. There is, thus, an urgent need to gender-sensitize public <b>health</b> <b>and</b> <b>medical</b> <b>education.</b> The paper proposes a gender analysis of health to distinguish between biological causes and social explanations for the health differentials between men and women. It also assessed some of the gender approaches to public <b>health</b> <b>and</b> <b>medical</b> <b>education</b> currently adopted in the Asia-Pacific region. It poses the pressing question of how <b>medical</b> <b>and</b> public <b>health</b> educators integrate the gender perspective into <b>medical</b> <b>and</b> public <b>health</b> <b>education.</b> The paper exhorts all <b>medical</b> <b>and</b> public <b>health</b> practitioners to explore new directions and identify innovative strategies to formulate a gender-sensitive curriculum towards the best practices in medicine <b>and</b> public <b>health</b> that will meet the health needs of women and men in the 21 st century...|$|R

40|$|A teacher’s {{classroom}} skills, attitudes, and behaviours {{are fundamental}} to excellent teaching. Assessing these qualities is a logistically difficult, costly, and at times, controversial task for teacher educators and school administrators.

40|$|New {{accessible}} learning methods delivered through mobile {{mixed reality}} are becoming possible in education, shifting pedagogy {{from the use}} of two dimensional images and videos to facilitating learning via interactive mobile environments. This is especially important in <b>medical</b> <b>and</b> <b>health</b> <b>education,</b> where the required knowledge acquisition is typically much more experiential, self-directed, and hands-on than in many other disciplines. Presented are insights obtained from the implementation and testing of two mobile mixed reality interventions across two Australian higher education classrooms in medicine and health sciences, concentrating on student perceptions of mobile mixed reality for learning physiology and anatomy in a face-to-face medical and health science classroom and skills acquisition in airways management focusing on direct laryngoscopy with foreign body removal in a distance paramedic science classroom. This is unique because most studies focus on a single discipline, focusing on either skills or the learner experience and a single delivery modality rather than linking cross-discipline knowledge acquisition {{and the development of a}} student’s tangible skills across multimodal classrooms. Outcomes are presented from post-intervention student interviews and discipline academic observation, which highlight improvements in learner motivation and skills, but also demonstrated pedagogical challenges to overcome with mobile mixed reality learning...|$|E
40|$|Background : Oxyuriasis and {{giardiasis}} {{are common}} intestinal infections in students. Prior investigators have proposed {{the role of}} teachers in preventing these problems. The present {{study was conducted to}} determine the effects of health training on teachers' knowledge of oxyuriasis and giardiasis prevention in Kashan in 2000. Materials and methods : For this quasi-experimental study, knowledge of 256 teachers towards the nature, transmission and prevention of oxyuriasis and giardiasis was assessed before the training via a questionnaire, then, one month later, after the training, their knowledge was reassessed. Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Wilcoxon and Mann-Whitney tests were used for data analysis. Results : Knowledge score of teachers' towards the nature, transmission and prevention of oxyuriasis and giardiasis prior the training intervention were 3. 6 ± 1. 1, 3. 6 ± 1. 2, and 3. 4 ± 1. 0 respectively. These figures have changed to 4. 3 ± 0. 9, 1. 1 ± 0. 1, and 3. 9 ± 4. 0 following the training respectively (p< 0. 00001).

40|$|Increasingly, {{the use of}} web {{database}} portfolio {{systems is}} noted in <b>medical</b> <b>and</b> <b>health</b> <b>education,</b> and for continuing professional development (CPD). However, the functions of existing systems are not always aligned with the corresponding pedagogy and hence reflection is often lost. This paper presents {{the development of a}} tailored web database portfolio system with Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS) connectivity, which is based on the portfolio pedagogy. Following a pre-determined portfolio framework, a system model with the components of web, database and mail servers, server side scripts, and a Query/Retrieve (Q/R) broker for conversion between Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) requests and Q/R service class of Digital Imaging and Communication in Medicine (DICOM) standard, is proposed. The system was piloted with seventy-seven volunteers. A tailored web database portfolio system ([URL] was developed. Technological arrangements for reinforcing portfolio pedagogy include popup windows (reminders) with guidelines and probing questions of 'collect', 'select' and 'reflect' on evidence of development/experience, limitation in the number of files (evidence) to be uploaded, the 'Evidence Insertion' functionality to link the individual uploaded artifacts with reflective writing, capability to accommodate diversity of contents and convenient interfaces for reviewing portfolios and communication. Evidence to date suggests the system supports users to build their portfolios with sound hypertext reflection under a facilitator's guidance, and with reviewers to monitor students' progress providing feedback and comments online in a programme-wide situation.

40|$|Today, {{health has}} transcended {{national}} boundaries {{and become more}} multifaceted. Global health has evolved as a new paradigm and is recently being identified as a thrust area now in India. Despite an existing need for a standardized global health curriculum, there is little information available on its education and curriculum in <b>medical</b> <b>and</b> <b>health</b> <b>education</b> space. In the Indian context, we are yet to have a fuller picture of the current status, including, content, structure, selection, teaching methods of global health, and how students are evaluated in India. The objective {{of this study was}} to map courses relating to studies on global health in India and analyze its mode of delivery. A detailed Internet search was carried out to identify global health courses and analyzed for: (i) whether global health is a part of the teaching curriculum, (ii) mode of teaching, (iii) broad contents, (iv) instructional formats, (v) assessment, and (vi) selection process. It was found that delivery of global health education in India was fragmented with limited focus at the undergraduate and postgraduate levels. Global health teaching was largely based on certificate courses or online courses, with hardly any institutions imparting a distinct global health education program. There is also no definite specification as to which institutes can impart teaching on global health education and what the specific eligibility requirements are. Our analysis suggests that efforts should be directed toward integrating global health education into broader public health curriculum. At the same time, the need for generation of global health leaders, creation of a common forum for addressing merits and demerits of global health issues, as well as creation of more opportunities for placements are recognized...|$|E
