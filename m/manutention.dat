It was initially called passerelle de l'Exposition Militaire or passerelle de Magdebourg, only later passerelle Debilly, after General Jean Louis Debilly of the French First Empire {{who was killed in}} the Battle of Jena in 1806. The bridge became a permanent fixture from its original provisional status under the management of the City of Paris in 1906 after it was relocated opposite to the rue de la <b>Manutention.</b>|$|E
50|$|In 1807, {{the army}} seized the site, which was {{transformed}} into a storage center and military camp. In 1840, the army built the large square, then called <b>Manutention</b> Sainte-Marie des Chaînes. Flour and bread were manufactured there; coffee, tobacco and wine were stored there until 1991. In 1870, a metal canopy was built over the central courtyard. Three flour mills were built, in 1853, 1870, and 1890, and a bakery. In 1941, the site was occupied by the army, and until 1995 it was called Military Subsistances.|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. Ass. Eval.) [...] University of Melbourne, Dept. of Education, 2005 <b>Manutention</b> is {{the skills}} {{training}} component {{of an integrated}} approach to manual handling risk reduction. Based {{of the work of}} Paul Dotte, <b>Manutention</b> training courses are delivered in Australia through the auspice of the Australian Association of <b>Manutention</b> Practitioners (AAMP). The assessment and reporting of training outcomes is hampered by the lack of industry standards for manual handling trainers. In part {{this is due to the}} lack of recognition of manual handling as a skill, although there is ample evidence in the literature to suggest that, as a psychomotor skill, it can be taught, learnt and with practice, levels of expertise can be achieved. Standards referencing is considered a form of criterion referencing where levels of performance are defined along a continuum of increasing competence. Using this, framework the <b>Manutention</b> competency was defined and descriptive standards were articulated for each level. The aspects of performance and associated quality indicators that contribute to the competency were written as scoring rubrics. This study used item response theory to investigate whether the <b>Manutention</b> competency could be empirically validated using a standards referenced framework. It also investigated whether the scoring rubric could be applied to inform judgements of competence at varying levels. The finding supported the use of a standards referenced framework as a best practice assessment model for AAMP and lent weight to the argument that manual handling is a skill.

40|$|Starting from a {{comprehensive}} set of experimental test results of upright cross-sections in compression, {{this paper is}} focussed on how the section can be optimally designed to achieve the highest possible failure load in global buckling. The aim is to optimize a cross-section prototype shape with restrictions on its geometry attending to manufacturing feasibility and assembly constraints. The proposed scheme consists of maximizing the design strength with respect to flexural torsional buckling, according to European Standard prEN 15512 : 2008 [European Standard prEN 15512 : 2008. Steel static storage systems - Adjustable pallet racking systems - Principles for structural design] / Fédération Européenne de la <b>Manutention</b> [Fédération Européenne de la <b>Manutention</b> (Section X) : The design of static steel pallet racking. FEM 10. 2. 02; August 2000] design recommendations. This is a bicriteria optimization problem which is solved by formulating a nonlinear mathematical program. Optimization is performed prior to the finite element method (FEM) nonlinear analysis of the solution design. The procedure herein presented has two advantages: {{on the one hand}} it considerably reduces the number of nonlinear analyses, and on the other it ensures that the best design is achieved.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an algorithm to model scaffold behaviour {{and follow the}} full moment-rotation curve including nonlinear loading and unloading behaviour and including looseness. Different approximations to the moment-rotation curves are developed and applied to simple frames. The Federation Européene de la <b>Manutention</b> (FEM) approach gave the simplest reliable results. The models are applied to frames including looseness effects where it is shown that for sway frames looseness reduces the capacity significantly but for braced frames looseness has less effect. Design recommendations for analyses of scaffolds with connectionsexhibitinglooseness are made...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Genetics factors {{contribute}} {{to the risk of}} osteoporosis in the elderly. Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the relationship between polymorphisms in the genes: interleukin- 1 (IL- 1 b) and vitamin D receptor (VDR) in 41 elderly patients with and without osteoporosis from basic health units. Methods: We extracted DNA from peripheral blood leukocytes of the elderly. Genetic polymorphisms were assessed by PCR-RFLP. The c 2 test and Fisher exact test were used to evaluate the effect of each polymorphism on osteoporosis, with a significance level of 5 %. Results: It has been found a significant association between the presence of osteoporosis and the gene polymorphism of IL- 1 B (p < 0. 05) in elderly women. With respect to the VDR gene was not detected significant association. Conclusions: These data suggest that IL- 1 b polymorphism may influence in the <b>manutention</b> of bone mineral density in elderly women...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper will}} {{consider}} both the nearshore and the onshore {{sector of the}} coastal zone but stops short of the immediate hinterland. As the 21 st century dawns, pressures on the littoral fringe intensify at an accelerating pace. Demands for its use are complex and numerous, with conflict steadily increasing. They encompass expanding human occupance, industry's search for water, implantation of transformation-facilities, processing, manufacture- and <b>manutention</b> plants, alternative energy installations, road-, rail- and air transportation centres, harbour space, terminals, maintenance and expansion of existing fisheries facilities, accomodation of various pipe- and slurry lines, siting of artificial islands of divergent purposes, preservation of touristic attractiveness, development of recreational installations, and - in some sites -exploitation of beaches and inner-shelf mineral deposits. Besides harmonising this vast array of exigencies, and rationally allocating space, managing must cope with environmental impact of multiple-use and the threatening aspects of sea-level rise posing the recurrent problems of coastal defense, beach restoration, and shoreline retreat...|$|E
40|$|In modern {{production}} and distribution systems, the automated storage/retrieval systems (AS/RS), high-storage level systems that reduce labor cost, required floor space and error rate, while increasing product availability, {{have been widely used}} since the 1950 s. Due to the high-investment costs involved in the development of high-efficient and high-flexible automated storage systems, performance estimation of the systems is both practically and theoretically important. The authors suggest a new method to estimate the travel time of a recently emerging version of AS/RSs, the multi-shuttle systems. The proposal is based on an industrial standard established by the Federation Europeenne de la <b>Manutention</b> (F. E. M.). In order to estimate travel times, the authors conduct a Monte Carlo simulation to determine coordinates of two additional representative points which are not given by F. E. M. Then they conduct a new Monte Carlo simulation to compare the results obtained by the method they proposed with those of previous methods and models developed in scientific literature based on Bozer and White formulations. Several real industrial applications demonstrate the validity of proposed method...|$|E
40|$|Intestinal {{obstruction}} {{occurs in}} chelonian mainly due parasitism and foreign bodies, as stones and sand. An intestinal compaction {{was described in}} a five year-old male d'orbigny's slider which {{was taken to the}} Veterinary Medical Teaching Hospital of the UNICASTELO, at Fernandopolis, SP, Brazil, presenting anorexia for a week, severe dehydration and stupor. Definitive diagnostic was performed by radiographic exam and great amount of intestinal radiopac substance was detected. The animal went through emergency celiotomy for removing the intestinal foreign bodies. Inhalatory anesthesia with isofluorane was used for anesthesia induction and <b>manutention.</b> After local antisepsy, a 4 cm(2) oblique opening was conducted on plastron by using a vibratory saw. Peritoneum was cut, intestines exteriorized and enterotomy performed. During the surgery, the animal was radiographed to confirm the complete taken out of the foreign bodies. Mononylon 4 - 0 strand was applied for intestinal suture in two planes. The plastron piece that was taken out was replaced and set with epoxy resine and gaze on the surgical window, making it waterproof. In the postoperative time, animal was medicated with analgesics for two days and pentabiotics for five days. Oral creamy diet was used with oral tube from the second to tenth day, what provided a great clinicosurgical recovering...|$|E
40|$|The goal of {{the study}} was get an {{experimental}} model of metabolic acidosis which was appropriated in future gastric emptying studies. For this proposal were utilized 141 female Wistar rats in three stages: in the first (n = 27) was defined the installation, <b>manutention</b> and spontaneous recuperation of the metabolic acidosis produced by the orogastric infusion of a two ml by 100 g of an 0. 5 M ammonium chloride solution; in the second (n = 60), it was studied the gastric emptying of the same solution utilized in the first stage and in the last stage (n = 54) it was determined the gastric emptying of the water, for excluding the possibility that the acidificant solution had caused any lesion in the gastric mucosa. As control group were utilized animals fed as a sodium chloride solution in the same concentration and volume that the acidificant solution. The results showed that 6 hours after the infusion, the gastric emptying of two above mentioned meals was complete and there was still a moderate metabolic acidosis in the group with infusion of ammonium chloride solution. Further more, the metabolic acidosis persisted in moderate values until 8 hours after the infusion. Based on these data the interval between 6 and 8 hours after the infusion of the these solutions was considered the best to the further studies about metabolic acidosis and gastric emptying. Finally, the gastric emptying of water, studied in rats with acidosis and controls demonstrated no differences between them. This was interpreted as a clue that the ammonium chloride solution did not modificate the integrity of the gastric mucosa...|$|E
