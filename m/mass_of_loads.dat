We model such mounds by numerically solving the Grad-Shafranov equation for axisymmet-ric static MHD equilibria. From our solutions we infer local distortion of field lines {{due to the}} weight of accreted matter. Variation in mass loading at the accretion disc will alter {{the shape of the}} accretion mound which will also affect the local field distortion. From simulations of cyclotron resonance scattering features from HMXBs, we conclude that local field distortion will greatly affect the shape and nature of the CRSF. From phase re-solved spectral analysis one can infer the local field structure and hence the nature <b>of</b> <b>mass</b> <b>loading</b> <b>of</b> field lines at the accretion disc.

Most of the rejected portion is used as ruminant and for alcohol production. In the present study, the untreated solid pineapple waste (SPW) was used to adsorb selenite ion (Se(IV)) from aqueous solution. The Se(IV) loaded and unloaded SPW were characterized using proximate analysis, atomic absorption spectrometry, scanning electron microscopy, energydispersive X-ray spectroscopy, thermogravimetry analysis, differential scanning calorimetry and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Various parameters that affect the adsorption such as initial pH, contact time, temperature, <b>mass</b> <b>of</b> adsorbent and concentration of adsorbate were investigated to determine the optimum adsorption conditions. Kinetics of the adsorption was investigated by pseudo firstorder and pseudo second-order models. Equilibrium {{studies were carried out}} by Langmuir, Freundlich and Temkin isotherms. Thermodynamic studies of the adsorption were performed using van’t Hoff equation. Desorption studies <b>of</b> the Se(IV) <b>loaded</b> SPW were carried out under various conditions such as initial pH, desorption time, ratio <b>mass</b> <b>of</b> <b>loaded</b> SPW to reaction volume and concentrations of humic acid and competing ions such as chloride, phosphate and sulphate ions. Under the optimum adsorption conditions the Se(IV) content of SPW could be increased by 100 folds from less than 10 µg/g to nearly 1000 µg/g. The adsorption optimum conditions were at pH 6, adsorption duration t = 60 min, initial concentration of Se(IV) aqueous solution C 0 = 10 mg/L, SPW weight was 3 g in 50 mL of reaction volume and temperature was 80 °C. The adsorption rate of Se(IV) by SPW under the optimum conditions fitted the pseudo second order with rate constant, k 2 = 4. 8539 mg/g min while the adsorption of Se(IV) by SPW best fitted Temkin isotherm (R 2 = 0. 9963), followed by Langmuir isotherm (R 2 = 0. 9830) and the Freundlich isotherm (R 2 = 0. 9702), which indicated the dominance of chemisorption.

Our hypothesis is that PET symptoms can be addressed at the level of the eardrum more easily than at the level of the eustachian tube.

This uncertainty in the estimation of community wide drugs use should not be underestimated. This paper aims to apply for the first time enantiomeric profiling in verifying sources of the presence of MDMA and amphetamine in wastewater based on a case study in two Dutch cities: Utrecht and Eindhoven.
