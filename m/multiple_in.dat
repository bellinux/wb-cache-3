In her first year of playing, Rousso had <b>multiple</b> <b>in</b> the money tournament finishes, including a seventh-place finish {{in a field of}} 605 at the $25,000 April 26, 2006 World Poker Tour (Season four) No-Limit Hold'em championship event, in which she earned $263,625 in prize money. By that time she was spending Tuesday through Thursday taking her law school classes, spending {{the rest of the week}} playing in poker tournaments and fielding endorsement offers from online poker clubs. On September 13, 2006 she won $285,450 with a first-place finish at the 173-entrant $5,000 no-limit hold 'em event at the 4th Borgata Open. At 2006 World Series of Poker she had three in the money finishes. She finished 80th in a field of 1068 in Event 4, $1,500 Limit Hold'em, 63rd in a field of 824 in Event 5, $2500 Short Handed No-Limit Hold'em, and she placed 8th of 507 in the Event 30, $5000 Short Handed No-Limit Hold'em event.|$|E

LTE will support channel bandwidths from 1.25MHz to 20MHz and both FDD and TDD operation. MetroPCS has activated the first LTE network, which is fully operational.

25|$|Three game modes are {{included}} with the game, with two more available via downloadable content. The first game mode, Power Race, is a hybrid of both racing and combat. Players can collect powerups to give their planes different abilities. These abilities include such things as missiles, machine guns, mines, or an EMP blast. The goal is to use whatever means necessary to achieve the highest finishing rank {{at the end of}} a given race. The second mode is focused solely on racing. Entitled Speed Race, this mode omits all weapons and powerups. In their place are rings scattered throughout the course. Flying through these rings provides the plane with an extra burst of speed, and flying through <b>multiple</b> <b>in</b> succession will multiply that speed. As with Power Race the goal is to finish the race in as high a rank as possible.|$|E

40|$|In complex areas, the {{attenuation}} of specular and diffracted <b>multiples</b> <b>in</b> {{image space}} {{is an attractive}} alternative to surface-related multiple elimination (SRME) and to data space Radon filtering. We present the equations that map, via wave-equation migration, 2 D diffracted and specular water-bottom multiples from data space to image space. We show the equations for both subsurface-offset-domain common-image-gathers (SODCIGs) and angle-domain common-image-gathers (ADCIGs). We demonstrate that when migrated with sediment velocities, the over-migrated multiples map to predictable regions in both SODCIGs and ADCIGs. Specular multiples focus similarly to primaries, whereas diffracted <b>multiples</b> do not. <b>In</b> particular, {{the apex of the}} residual moveout curve of diffracted <b>multiples</b> <b>in</b> ADCIGs is not located at the zero aperture angle. We use our equation of the residual moveout of the <b>multiples</b> <b>in</b> ADCIGs to design an apex-shifted Radon transform that maps the 2 D ADCIGs into a 3 D model space cube whose dimensions are depth, curvature, and apex-shift distance. Well-corrected primaries map to or near the zero-curvature plane and specularly reflected multiples map to or near the zero apex-shift plane. Diffracted <b>multiples</b> map elsewhere <b>in</b> the cube according to their curvature and apex-shift distance. Thus, specularly reflected as well as diffracted multiples can be attenuated simultaneously. We show the application of our apex-shifted Radon transform to a 2 D seismic line from the Gulf of Mexico. Diffracted multiples originate {{at the edges of the}} salt body and we show that we can successfully attenuate them, along with the specular <b>multiples,</b> <b>in</b> the image Radon domain...|$|R
