25|$|Before {{the modern}} era, {{cryptography}} focused on message confidentiality (i.e., encryption)—conversion of messages from a comprehensible form into an incomprehensible one {{and back again}} at the other end, rendering it unreadable by interceptors or eavesdroppers without secret knowledge (namely the key needed for decryption of that message). Encryption attempted to ensure secrecy in communications, {{such as those of}} spies, military leaders, and diplomats. In recent decades, the field has expanded beyond confidentiality concerns to include techniques for <b>message</b> <b>integrity</b> checking, sender/receiver identity authentication, digital signatures, interactive proofs and secure computation, among others.|$|E

25|$|PGP {{supports}} {{message authentication}} and integrity checking. The latter {{is used to}} detect whether a message has been altered since it was completed (the <b>message</b> <b>integrity</b> property) and the former {{to determine whether it}} was actually sent by the person or entity claimed to be the sender (a digital signature). Because the content is encrypted, any changes in the message will result in failure of the decryption with the appropriate key. The sender uses PGP to create a digital signature for the message with either the RSA or DSA algorithms. To do so, PGP computes a hash (also called a message digest) from the plaintext and then creates the digital signature from that hash using the sender's private key.|$|E

Here we consider the graph whose nodes are the balanced Boolean functions and whose edges are pairs of maps with sum a balanced map. This is a regular graph with degree ` ´. Within this graph it is posed the problem to find extreme values of the non linearity operator, calculated through the Walsh-Hadamard transform. The search of maximally non-linear balanced maps is of great interest in several areas of information security, e. g. S-boxes design, <b>messages</b> <b>integrity</b> and participants authentication. We present some experimental results regarding the performance of local search and some other heuristic techniques based on simulated annealing, giving all of them the same average approximation.

50|$|WPA also {{includes}} a <b>message</b> <b>integrity</b> check, {{which is designed to}} prevent an attacker from altering and resending data packets. This replaces the cyclic redundancy check (CRC) that was used by the WEP standard. CRC's main flaw was that it did not provide a sufficiently strong data integrity guarantee for the packets it handled. Well tested message authentication codes existed to solve these problems, but they required too much computation to be used on old network cards. WPA uses a <b>message</b> <b>integrity</b> check algorithm called TKIP to verify the integrity of the packets. TKIP is much stronger than a CRC, but not as strong as the algorithm used in WPA2. Researchers have since discovered a flaw in WPA that relied on older weaknesses in WEP and the limitations of the <b>message</b> <b>integrity</b> code hash function, named Michael, to retrieve the keystream from short packets to use for re-injection and spoofing.|$|E

50|$|The term <b>message</b> <b>integrity</b> code (MIC) is {{frequently}} substituted for the term MAC, especially in communications, where the acronym MAC traditionally stands for Media Access Control address. However, some authors use MIC {{to refer to}} a message digest, which is different from a MAC -- a message digest does not use secret keys. This lack of security means that any message digest intended for use gauging <b>message</b> <b>integrity</b> should be encrypted or otherwise be protected against tampering. Message digest algorithms are created such that a given message will always produce the same message digest assuming the same algorithm is used to generate both. Conversely, MAC algorithms are designed to produce matching MACs only if the same message, secret key and initialization vector are input to the same algorithm. Message digests do not use secret keys and, when taken on their own, are therefore a much less reliable gauge of <b>message</b> <b>integrity</b> than MACs. Because MACs use secret keys, they do not necessarily need to be encrypted to provide the same level of assurance.|$|E
