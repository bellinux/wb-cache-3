5|$|Einstein {{concluded}} that each wave of frequency f {{is associated with}} a collection of photons with energy hf each, where h is Planck's constant. He does not say much <b>more,</b> <b>because</b> he is not sure how the particles are related to the wave. But he does suggest that this idea would explain certain experimental results, notably the photoelectric effect.|$|E
5|$|No Gun Ri villagers {{said that}} in later decades, two mass graves holding some victims' remains were disturbed, and bones were removed during a {{reforestation}} project, and by farming activity. In 2007, excavations at several places near the bridge turned up little. The forensics team said that it hadn't found <b>more,</b> <b>because</b> so much time had passed, and any remains {{had been exposed to}} the elements and soil erosion, railway work, cultivation, and highly acidic soil.|$|E
5|$|Rhodium finds use in {{jewelry and}} for decorations. It is {{electroplated}} on white gold and platinum {{to give it}} a reflective white surface at time of sale, after which the thin layer wears away with use. This is known as rhodium flashing in the jewelry business. It may also be used in coating sterling silver to protect against tarnish (silver sulfide, Ag2S, produced from atmospheric hydrogen sulfide, H2S). Solid (pure) rhodium jewelry is very rare, <b>more</b> <b>because</b> of the difficulty of fabrication (high melting point and poor malleability) than because of the high price. The high cost ensures that rhodium is applied only as an electroplate.|$|E

5|$|The Striking Black {{campaign}} earned Bo national {{recognition and}} widespread popularity in Chongqing—all the <b>more</b> <b>because</b> of the city’s {{reputation as a}} center for criminal activity. The apparent success of Bo's campaign raised Bo's national and international profile and resulted in calls for a nationwide campaign based on his experiences in Chongqing. Through the campaign, Bo gained {{the support of a}} number of powerful members of the Politburo Standing Committee, including Wu Bangguo, Jia Qinglin, Li Changchun, Xi Jinping and Zhou Yongkang, all of whom visited Chongqing or praised Bo's achievements sometime between 2010 and 2011.|$|E
5|$|The bowl {{earned the}} right to select these teams via its multimillion-dollar payout system, which {{guarantees}} {{a certain amount of money}} to the participating conferences. Before 2006, the Chick-fil-A Bowl (then known as the Peach Bowl) matched the No.5 team in the SEC versus the No.3 team in the ACC. After the bowl increased its payout to $2.8million per squad, it then was given the second pick from the ACC, with the Gator Bowl dropping to third. After 2006, the Chick-fil-A Bowl has steadily increased its payouts in order to keep pace with the trend across college football. In the 2009 game, the ACC and SEC split a payout of $6.02 million, with the ACC receiving <b>more</b> <b>because</b> it offered an earlier selection.|$|E
5|$|With Rashad narrating the film's final scene, Teddy {{opens his}} own {{business}} concerning the production of gold teeth, as Big Gipp makes a cameo appearance in his shop, Brooklyn finds {{a job at a}} Krystal restaurant, while Esquire receives a mysterious letter of recommendation (presumably from Garnett) and is able to attend his college. The twins Veda and Star remain in the old neighborhood and hang out at Cascade on Sundays, while Erin goes to Spelman College, the school she wanted to attend, in which Rashad appreciates a lot <b>more</b> <b>because</b> she's still close. Uncle George starts attending church more often and finds a good woman to date. Ant changes direction, discarding the notion of drug dealing, finds a new girlfriend and begins to focus on his studies in school. Rashad, lastly, becomes a comic artist for the Sunday edition of the Atlanta Evening Standard, the city's newspaper. The film ends with Rashad leaving his skates in Cascades, and the building's lights go off.|$|E

25|$|Because of the {{perceived}} insult of the incursion against Coldwater so near to their territory, the Muscogee took up the hatchet against the Cumberland settlements afterwards.

25|$|Since then, {{the north}} face has been climbed many times.

Climbers are increasingly electing to challenge the Eiger in winter, when the crumbling face is strengthened by ice.|$|E

25|$|Kondrashov {{argues that}} the {{slightly}} deleterious nature of mutations means that the population will tend to be composed of individuals with {{a small number of}} mutations. Sex will act to recombine these genotypes, creating some individuals with fewer deleterious mutations, and some with <b>more.</b> <b>Because</b> there is a major selective disadvantage to individuals with more mutations, these individuals die out. In essence, sex compartmentalises the deleterious mutations.|$|E
25|$|Francisco Goya's The Nude Maja (1797) {{has been}} {{considered}} as probably the first European painting to show a female subject's pubic hair, though paintings had hinted at it. The painting was considered quite pornographic at the time. Gustave Courbet's L'Origine du monde (The Origin of the World, 1866) was considered scandalous probably <b>more</b> <b>because</b> of the presentation of thick pubic hair than the exposed female genitals.|$|E
25|$|Prices dropped quickly {{both for}} {{passenger}} tickets and freight transfer. However, the Ottomans {{were able to}} lower the prices <b>more</b> <b>because</b> {{they did not have}} to pay dividends and did not require as high a profit.

25|$|Ironically enough, {{there was}} {{universal}} reliance on folk healers – but clients often turned them in if something went wrong. According to Russian historian Valerie A. Kivelson, witchcraft accusations were normally thrown at lower-class peasants, townspeople and Cossacks. People turned to witchcraft {{as a means}} to support themselves. The ratio of male to female accusations was 75% to 25%. Males were targeted <b>more,</b> <b>because</b> witchcraft was associated with societal deviation. Because single people with no settled home could not be taxed, males typically had more power than women in their dissent.|$|E
25|$|Lastly, {{there have}} been {{problems}} with droughts and pest infestations. These include the roundheaded pine beetle, European mistletoe and caterpillars. Some residents see the event as divine will but others place global warming. It is not {{know how much of}} the oaks, junipers and pines that make up most of the forested areas have been compromised but there are visible yellow patches seen in the otherwise green forest. The pests have been able to infest <b>more</b> <b>because</b> trees are weak due to drought conditions.|$|E
25|$|There {{are three}} {{different}} RAID-Z modes: RAID-Z1 (similar to RAID5, allows one disk to fail), RAID-Z2 (similar to RAID6, allows two disks to fail), and RAID-Z3 (Also {{referred to as}} RAID7 allows three disks to fail). The need for RAID-Z3 arose recently because RAID configurations with future disks (say, 6–10TB) may {{take a long time}} to repair, the worst case being weeks. During those weeks, the rest of the disks in the RAID are stressed <b>more</b> <b>because</b> of the additional intensive repair process and might subsequently fail, too. By using RAID-Z3, the risk involved with disk replacement is reduced.|$|E
