40|$|We quantitatively {{analyze the}} way {{inflation}} alters the inequality {{of the income}} distribution in the U. S. economy. The main mechanism emphasized in this paper is the bracket creep effect according to which inflation pushes income into higher tax brackets. Governments adjust the nominal income tax brackets slowly and incompletely due to the rise in prices. In the U. S. postwar history, this typically happens less often than once every other tax year. In {{the first part of}} the paper, we study time series from the U. S. economy. As our central result we find that irrespective of the level of inflation <b>more</b> <b>frequent</b> <b>income</b> tax schedule adjustments make the relationship between inflation and income inequality more transitory in nature. In the second part of the paper, we develop a general equilibrium monetary model with income heterogeneity that is in line with our time series evidence. We find that a longer duration between two successive adjustments of the tax schedule reduces employment, savings, and output...|$|E
30|$|To {{administer}} the subsidy, {{the government must}} collect two types of information: that required to determine the eligibility of individuals (initial and ongoing) and that required to {{determine the amount of}} the subsidy. Where eligibility relates only to employment status – e.g., industry, hours of work, or wage rate – this information can be provided relatively easily by the employer. Some eligibility characteristics, such as receipt or duration of social insurance or unemployment benefits or immigration status, can be obtained from government records, possibly within the same agency that administers the subsidy. More detailed individual characteristics like income pose more difficult administrative problems. If eligibility is based on annual income in the prior calendar year, this information can be obtained through the tax system, as is done for wage subsidies in the U.S., U.K., and Chile. Subsidies based on annual income are, however, extremely unresponsive to short-term changes in income. If, for example, a worker loses their job in March, it may be a full year before the the tax return for that year is available to document that loss. Unfortunately, <b>more</b> <b>frequent</b> <b>income</b> reporting, which can take the form of regular monthly reports from the employer or periodic (e.g., every 6 months) redetermination of eligibility, probably involving the worker, can be quite burdensome for employer, worker, and government alike. Reporting requirements to determine ongoing eligibility and the amount of the subsidy will also vary with the complexity of the subsidy. In the simplest case, once eligible, workers retain eligibility {{as long as they are}} employed by the same employer and the subsidy is determined by their wages. In these cases, employer earnings reports are sufficient to determine ongoing eligibility and the amount of the subsidy.|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the differences and similarities between form and function of if-clauses as one type of conditional clauses within the applied linguistics and chemistry published academic Articles. These articles were examined and after determining the frequency of if-clauses, they were analyzed based on the model proposed by Sweetser (1990). According to the findings, if-clauses were <b>more</b> <b>frequent</b> in applied linguistics than chemistry articles. Results of function analysis indicated that, content is the major function in both applied and chemistry articles and comparing two genres, it is <b>more</b> <b>frequent</b> in applied linguistics articles. Next function in the line is epistemic, and it is again <b>more</b> <b>frequent</b> in applied linguistics articles and speech act was the last function that was <b>more</b> <b>frequent</b> in applied linguistics articles too. In addition, the verb forms of if-clauses were analyzed. Findings indicated that present + present pattern was the most predominant pattern across these two disciplines and it was <b>more</b> <b>frequent</b> in applied linguistics articles, therefore, {{there can be a}} relationship between verb pattern and function...|$|R
