Nayyouf claimed that officers of the Special Republican Guard organized the smuggling in collaboration with relatives of Bashar al-Assad including Dhu al-Himma Shalish and Assif Shoakat, who is also CEO of Bhaha, an import/export company owned by the Assad family. Nayyouf identified sites near the cities of al-Baida, Tell Sinan, and Sjinsjar as alleged holding sites for Iraqi WMDs.|$|E

Much later, the alleged weapons of <b>mass</b> <b>destruction</b> <b>in</b> Iraq affair {{certainly}} dirtied the previously favourable image.

To date, the Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction program has deactivated more than 7,500nuclear warheads.

In 1999 India was estimated to have 800kg of separated reactor-grade plutonium, with a total amount of 8300kg of civilian plutonium, enough for approximately 1,000 nuclear weapons. India is not a signatory to the 1968 Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), which it argues entrenches the status quo of the existing nuclear weapons states whilst preventing general nuclear disarmament.|$|E

He came to public attention in July 2003 when an unauthorised discussion he had off the record with BBC journalist Andrew Gilligan about the British government's dossier on weapons of <b>mass</b> <b>destruction</b> <b>in</b> Iraq was cited by Gilligan {{and led to a}} major controversy.

25|$|In a January 2003 CBS poll, 64% of Americans had {{approved}} {{of military action}} against Iraq; however, 63% wanted Bush to find a diplomatic solution rather than go to war, and 62% believed {{the threat of terrorism}} directed against the U.S. would increase due to war. The invasion of Iraq was strongly opposed by some long-standing U.S. allies, including the governments of France, Germany, and New Zealand. Their leaders argued that {{there was no evidence of}} weapons of <b>mass</b> <b>destruction</b> <b>in</b> Iraq and that invading the country was not justified in the context of UNMOVIC's 12 February 2003 report. On 15 February 2003, a month before the invasion, there were worldwide protests against the Iraq War, including a rally of three million people in Rome, which is listed in the Guinness Book of Records as the largest ever anti-war rally. According to the French academic Dominique Reynié, between 3 January and 12 April 2003, 36 million people across the globe took part in almost 3,000 protests against the Iraq war.|$|E

[...] "A Prayer for My Daughter" [...] deals with the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. Because the topic is controversial, it was a difficult area to work with without offending people from both sides.
