50|$|<b>Mebutamate</b> (Capla, Dormate) is an {{anxiolytic}} and sedative drug with antihypertensive {{effects of}} the carbamate class. It has effects {{comparable to those of}} barbiturates such as secobarbital, but is only around 1/3 the potency of secobarbital as a sedative. Side effects include dizziness and headaches.|$|E
50|$|<b>Mebutamate</b> {{is one of}} many GABAergic drugs which act via {{allosteric}} agonism of the GABAA receptor at the β-subreceptor {{similar to}} barbiturates. In contrast, benzodiazepines act at the α-subreceptor. As such, carbamates and barbiturates, possess analgesic properties which the benzodiazepine class of drugs do not.|$|E
50|$|In addition, some carbamates {{are used}} in human pharmacotherapy, for example, the {{acetylcholinesterase}} inhibitors neostigmine and rivastigmine, whose chemical structure {{is based on the}} natural alkaloid physostigmine. Other examples are meprobamate and its derivatives like carisoprodol, felbamate, <b>mebutamate,</b> and tybamate, a class of anxiolytic and muscle relaxant drugs widely used in the 1960s before the rise of benzodiazepines, and still used nowadays in some cases.|$|E
5000|$|Meprobamate's {{mechanism}} of action is not completely known. It {{has been shown in}} animal studies to have effects at multiple sites in the central nervous system, including the thalamus and limbic system. Meprobamate binds to GABAA receptors which interrupts neuronal communication in the reticular formation and spinal cord, causing sedation and altered perception of pain. It has been shown that meprobamate has the ability to activate currents {{even in the absence of}} GABA. [...] This relatively unique property makes meprobamate exceptionally dangerous when used in combination with other GABA-mediated drugs (including alcohol). It is also a potent adenosine reuptake inhibitor (AdoRI), which is most likely responsible for its lesser degree of sedation compared to barbiturates.Related drugs include carisoprodol and tybamate (prodrugs of meprobamate), felbamate, <b>mebutamate,</b> and methocarbamol.|$|E
40|$|Pressor {{responses}} to intravenous injections both of physostigmine and of pilocarpine were smaller in rats anaesthetized with either <b>mebutamate</b> or amylobarbitone than in rats anaesthetized with urethane. The response to electrical {{stimulation of the}} hypogastric nerve in the isolated hypogastric nerve-vas deferens preparation was diminished by <b>mebutamate</b> and by amylobarbitone, but not by urethane. Similar results were obtained with the cat isolated splenic nerve-spleen preparation. In the rat anaesthetized with urethane, pressor {{responses to}} physostigmine were only partially antagonized by hexamethonium but were completely abolished during “depolarizing” ganglionic block by nicotine or tetramethylammonium. It is suggested that, {{in addition to the}} central mechanism, there is a peripheral component in the pressor action of physostigmine and in the antihypertensive actions of <b>mebutamate</b> and amylobarbitone...|$|E
40|$|Guanethidine, hemicholinium and <b>mebutamate</b> {{were used}} to study the site and {{mechanism}} of the hypertensive response to eserine in the rat. Guanethidine was found to block very effectively the hypertensive effect of eserine and to produce {{at the same time}} a very strong potentiation of the response to catechol amines. Hemicholinium, after a certain latent period, also blocked the effect of eserine, at the same time leaving the response to adrenaline and noradrenaline intact. <b>Mebutamate</b> was also found to block the effect of eserine. The results of the present experiments suggest that eserine produces a central adrenergic activation in the rat...|$|E
40|$|W 583 (<b>Mebutamate)</b> was {{administered}} to nine male hypertensive patients in doses up to 2400 mg. per day {{in an attempt to}} lower the blood pressure. No other drug was used concurrently. The blood pressure was lowered in two patients only; and the drug was found to be without effect in the remaining seven patients. No postural effect or alteration in pulse was observed. Mild drowsiness was the only effect observed that might be attributable to W 583. The duration of treatment varied between three days, in a patient who then developed delirium and a sudden rise in blood pressure, to five months in one other patient. This drug appears to have a very limited place in the treatment of hypertension. Lack of significant demonstrated antihypertensive effect in seven of nine patients suggested that double-blind control studies are not warranted...|$|E
