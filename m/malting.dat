5|$|In the late-19th century, the Sleaford {{area was}} a major barley {{producer}} and by the 1880s, Sleaford was a stop on railway lines connecting the town to Boston, Grantham, Bourne, Spalding and Lincoln. These qualities made the town desirable {{for the production of}} malt, a crucial ingredient in beer production. The brewers Bass, Ratcliffe and Gretton Ltd were attracted to the town and in 1880 proposed a new <b>malting</b> complex there, which would consolidate <b>malting</b> closer to the barley source and reduce costs by up-scaling production. Drilling in 1892 revealed suitable artesian water sources under Sleaford; plans were submitted nine years later and over 13 acres of land off Mareham Lane was purchased; work started in 1901 and was complete by 1907.|$|E
5|$|The cloth {{industry}} {{appears to}} have been important {{in the development of the}} town until the 17th century along with <b>malting.</b> Brewing became important during the 18th and 19th centuries, and the oldest and most successful was May's Brewery, established by Thomas and William May in 1750 in Brook Street.|$|E
5|$|The starch {{source in}} a beer {{provides}} the fermentable material {{and is a}} key determinant of the strength and flavour of the beer. The most common starch source used in beer is malted grain. Grain is malted by soaking it in water, allowing it to begin germination, and then drying the partially germinated grain in a kiln. <b>Malting</b> grain produces enzymes that convert starches in the grain into fermentable sugars. Different roasting times and temperatures are used to produce different colours of malt from the same grain. Darker malts will produce darker beers.|$|E
5000|$|The {{ingredients}} used are: equal {{measures of}} maize meal, crushed mealie <b>malt</b> (corn <b>malt)</b> and crushed sorghum <b>malt.</b> The maize <b>malt</b> provides a lighter-toned beer with a mellower flavour. The sorghum <b>malt</b> provides a darker beer.|$|R
25|$|The {{hydrometer}} transformed how beer was brewed. Before {{its introduction}} beers were brewed {{from a single}} malt: brown beers from brown <b>malt,</b> amber beers from amber <b>malt,</b> pale beers from pale <b>malt.</b> Using the hydrometer, brewers could calculate the yield from different <b>malts.</b> They observed that pale <b>malt,</b> though more expensive, yielded far more fermentable material than cheaper <b>malts.</b> For example, brown <b>malt</b> (used for Porter) gave 54 pounds of extract per quarter, whilst pale <b>malt</b> gave 80 pounds. Once this was known, brewers switched to using mostly pale <b>malt</b> for all beers supplemented with a small quantity of highly coloured <b>malt</b> to achieve the correct colour for darker beers.|$|R
50|$|Westland's {{flagship}} American Single <b>Malt</b> Whiskey. This recipe, {{known as}} 5-malt, contains Washington select pale <b>malt</b> (70%), Munich <b>malt</b> (9%), Extra Special <b>malt</b> (13%), Brown <b>malt</b> (4%), and Pale Chocolate <b>malt</b> (4%). The spirit is aged predominantly in American Oak (Coopers Select, Cooper's Reserve) and occasionally 1st Fill Ex-Bourbon casks.|$|R
5|$|Nearly all beer {{includes}} {{barley malt}} {{as the majority}} of the starch. This is because its fibrous hull remains attached to the grain during threshing. After <b>malting,</b> barley is milled, which finally removes the hull, breaking it into large pieces. These pieces remain with the grain during the mash, and act as a filter bed during lautering, when sweet wort is separated from insoluble grain material. Other malted and unmalted grains (including wheat, rice, oats, and rye, and less frequently, corn and sorghum) may be used. Some brewers have produced gluten-free beer, made with sorghum with no barley malt, for those who cannot consume gluten-containing grains like wheat, barley, and rye.|$|E
5|$|Sleaford was {{primarily}} an agricultural town until the 20th century, supporting a cattle market, with seed companies, such as Hubbard and Phillips, and Sharpes International Seeds, being {{established in the}} late 19th century. The arrival of the railway made the town favourable for <b>malting.</b> Industry has declined, and in 2011 the most common occupations are in wholesale and retail trade, health and social care, public administration and defence and manufacturing. Regeneration of the town centre {{has led to the}} redevelopment of the old industrial areas, including the construction of the National Centre for Craft & Design on an old wharf.|$|E
5|$|Stephen Hartley began brewing in Tadcaster in 1758. In 1845 Jane Hartley mortgaged {{the brewery}} to David Backhouse and John Hartley. In 1847, Samuel Smith of Leeds {{arranged}} {{for his son}} John to enter the business. Jane Hartley died in 1852, and John Smith acquired the business, enlisting his brother William to help him. The timing was to prove fortuitous; pale ales were displacing porter as the beer of choice, and Tadcaster's hard water proved to be well-suited for brewing the new style. The prosperity of the 1850s and 1860s, together {{with the arrival of}} the railways, realised greater opportunities for brewers, and by 1861 John Smith employed eight men in his brewing and <b>malting</b> enterprise.|$|E
40|$|The paracaspase <b>MALT</b> 1 has arginine-directed {{proteolytic}} activity {{triggered by}} engagement of immune receptors. Recruitment of <b>MALT</b> 1 into activation complexes {{is required for}} <b>MALT</b> 1 proteolytic function. Here, co-expression of <b>MALT</b> 1 in HEK 293 cells, either with activated CARD 11 and BCL 10 or with TRAF 6, was used to explore the mechanism of <b>MALT</b> 1 activation at the molecular level. This work identified a prominent self-cleavage site of <b>MALT</b> 1 isoform A (<b>MALT</b> 1 A) at R 781 (R 770 in <b>MALT</b> 1 B) and revealed that TRAF 6 can activate <b>MALT</b> 1 independently of the CBM. Intramolecular cleavage at R 781 /R 770 removes a C-terminal TRAF 6 -binding site in both <b>MALT</b> 1 isoforms, leaving <b>MALT</b> 1 B devoid of the two key interaction sites with TRAF 6. A previously identified auto-proteolysis site of <b>MALT</b> 1 at R 149 leads to deletion of the death-domain, thereby abolishing interaction with BCL 10. By using <b>MALT</b> 1 isoforms and cleaved fragments thereof, as well as TRAF 6 WT and mutant forms, this work shows that TRAF 6 induces N-terminal auto-proteolytic cleavage of <b>MALT</b> 1 at R 149 and accelerates <b>MALT</b> 1 protein turnover. The <b>MALT</b> 1 fragment generated by N-terminal self-cleavage at R 149 was labile and displayed enhanced signaling properties that required an intact K 644 residue, previously {{shown to be a}} site for mono-ubiquitination of <b>MALT</b> 1. Conversely, C-terminal self-cleavage at R 781 /R 770 hampered the ability for self-cleavage at R 149 and stabilized <b>MALT</b> 1 by hindering interaction with TRAF 6. C-terminal self-cleavage had limited impact on <b>MALT</b> 1 A but severely reduced <b>MALT</b> 1 B proteolytic and signaling functions. It also abrogated NF-κB activation by N-terminally cleaved <b>MALT</b> 1 A. Altogether, this study provides further insights into mechanisms that regulate the scaffolding and activation cycle of <b>MALT</b> 1. It also emphasizes the reduced functional capacity of <b>MALT</b> 1 B as compared to <b>MALT</b> 1 A...|$|R

5|$|The O'Brien Brewing and <b>Malting</b> Company, {{also known}} as the Klondike Brewery, was a brewery founded by Thomas O'Brien in Klondike City, an {{adjoining}} settlement to Dawson City, Yukon Territory, Canada from 1904 to 1919. It was established during a period in which Dawson City was expected to become an important regional city, and used modern techniques and equipment imported from California. It was initially successful, selling 68,748 gallons of beer in 1905, but Dawson's population declined and growing temperance attitudes threatened the business. O'Brien sold the company in 1915, and in 1919 prohibition forced its closure. The brewery was abandoned, and the remains of the site are now owned by the Tr'ondek Hwech'in First Nation.|$|E
5|$|The company ran {{the complex}} at full {{capacity}} {{until after the}} Second World War; however, in the 1950s, Bass installed new and more efficient pneumatic <b>malting</b> systems at their original Burton-on-Trent plant, making the Sleaford complex redundant and {{paving the way for}} its closure in 1959. Vacant space was let to businesses, but the enormous complex was only ever partially occupied after Bass left. Vulnerable to damage and poorly maintained, fires started in 1969 and 1976, the latter resulting major damage to three of the malthouses. Some of the space was used for chicken-rearing by G. W. Padley (Property) Ltd. from 1973 into the 1990s.|$|E
5|$|The legal {{paperwork}} for the O'Brien Brewing and <b>Malting</b> Company {{was completed}} in late 1903 and the company was formally created in February 1904 by O'Brien as the majority shareholder with 77 percent of the stock, and six other investors. The company had an initial capital of $200,000 and owned $53,000 of land in Klondike City, just {{across the river from}} Dawson, which O'Brien had sold to the new company. George Mero was employed to build the new brewery at considerable speed - 15 days were allowed for the work's completion - converting O'Brien's old building for its new use. The brewery was situated alongside the Klondike Mines Railway terminal, also owned by O'Brien. It opened for business in April.|$|E

5|$|The maltings were {{constructed}} to designs by Herbert A. Couchman, Bass & Co.'s chief engineer. Built in red brick with Welsh slate roofing, the complex follows a rectangular plan along an east-west orientation: a central four-storey water tower {{is flanked by}} four malthouses. Behind the tower is a tall, octagonal chimney. The malthouses are identical in design and layout; barley was fed into a granary section, before being moved onto the germination floors and eventually transported {{to one of the}} twin kilns, where <b>malting</b> took place. Their southern fronts consisted of a six-storey building of five bays with a gable spanning three windows that faces the other ranges. Projecting northwards is a ten-bay section of four-storeys which formed the germination floors.|$|E
5|$|During the Industrial Revolution, the Slea was canalised in 1794 and the Sleaford Navigation Company {{constructed}} {{offices and}} wharves along Carre Street. The canal brought trade, while the Gothic-fronted gasworks on Eastgate lit the town from 1839. Benjamin Handley and Anthony Peacock financed and {{benefited from the}} navigation and founded the bank that took over Alvey's House on Northgate and later added a Baroque extension; Henry Handley, a Member of Parliament, is commemorated by the Handley Memorial on Southgate, a Gothic monument {{in the style of}} an Eleanor Cross. During the 1850s, the railways arrived and the station was built in a Gothic style. Sleaford's agricultural location and its new transport links encouraged seed trading and <b>malting</b> in the late 19th century: the seed merchant Charles Sharpe's house, The Pines, is on Boston Road. The massive Bass and Company maltings complex, constructed in brick off Mareham Lane between 1892 and 1905, is grade II* listed and has a frontage more than 1,000 feet long.|$|E

Elasticities of substitution for <b>malt</b> among different sources were computed. Results show that <b>malt</b> imported from the EU is least substitutable with <b>malt</b> from other sources, and demand for EU <b>malt</b> is less responsive to changes in price.

5000|$|Flavored <b>malt</b> {{beverages}} are brewery {{products that}} differ from traditional <b>malt</b> beverages such as beer, ale, lager, porter, stout, or <b>malt</b> liquor in several respects. Flavored <b>malt</b> beverages exhibit little or no traditional beer or <b>malt</b> beverage character. Their flavor is derived primarily from added flavors rather than from <b>malt</b> and other materials used in fermentation. At the same time, flavored <b>malt</b> beverages are marketed in traditional beer-type bottles and cans and distributed to the alcohol beverage market through beer and <b>malt</b> beverage wholesalers, and their alcohol content is similar to other <b>malt</b> beverages in the 4-6% alcohol by volume range.Although flavored <b>malt</b> beverages are produced at breweries, their method of production differs significantly from the production of other <b>malt</b> beverages and beer. In producing flavored <b>malt</b> beverages, brewers brew a fermented base of beer from <b>malt</b> and other brewing materials. Brewers then treat this base {{using a variety of}} processes in order to remove <b>malt</b> beverage character from the base. For example, they remove the color, bitterness, and taste generally associated with beer, ale, porter, stout, and other <b>malt</b> beverages. This leaves a base product to which brewers add various flavors, which typically contain distilled spirits, to achieve the desired taste profile and alcohol level.While the alcohol content of flavored <b>malt</b> beverages {{is similar to that of}} most traditional <b>malt</b> beverages, the alcohol in many of them is derived primarily from the distilled spirits component of the added flavors rather than from fermentation.:—70 Fed.
