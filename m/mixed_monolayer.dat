50|$|An {{important}} {{characteristic of}} the use of the substrate surface chemistry is the ability to readily control the areal dose of the dopants by forming a <b>mixed</b> <b>monolayer</b> of ‘blank’ and dopant-containing molecules. For instance, a mixture of boron precursor molecules and dodecene (all-carbon ‘blank’ precursor) in different ratios is utilized to manipulate the areal dose of boron. Besides the <b>mixed</b> <b>monolayer</b> formation, the areal dose can be readily tuned by using the molecular structure details of the dopant precursor. In specific, the molecular footprint of the precursor directly governs the surface concentration of the dopants, with larger molecules resulting in a lower dose. In this regard, using trioctylphosphine oxide (TOP) as the phosphorus precursor with an approximately six-fold larger molecular footprint than DPP, the dopant dose can be modulated in the reduction of six times accordingly. Moreover, the doping profiles can be readily tuned through optimization of the annealing conditions. In this case, the high surface doping density with sharp spatial decay can be obtained by using this MLD method with low anneal temperatures and short times for the formation of USJs. The ability to controllably tune the dopant dose through the structural design of the precursor and to control the dopant profile by the annealing conditions present a unique aspect of the MLD process for attaining the desired dopant dose and profile.|$|E

Spreading {{pressures of the}} TO-phospholipid mixture (i. e., surface pressures of the <b>mixed</b> <b>monolayer</b> in equilibrium with the phase-separating lipid mixture) at the air/saline interface were independent of the lipid composition. On the other hand, collapse pressures of the <b>mixed</b> <b>monolayer</b> of TO and phospholipid (i. e., surface pressures of the <b>mixed</b> <b>monolayer</b> in equilibrium with the TO-liquid phase) at the interface changed with the monolayer composition and were lower than the spreading pressure.

Optoelectronic device efficiency depends on control over chem. and electronic properties. We were able to functionalize silicon surfaces with mixed thiophene/methyl monolayers. The <b>mixed</b> <b>monolayer</b> method allowed for functionalization with thiophene groups while maintaining a low surface recombination velocity, S, of 27 ± 9 cm s^(- 1), while the single component thiophene-functionalized Si(111) surface displayed S= 670 ± 190 cm s^(- 1). Pd-catalyzed Heck coupling was achieved at mixed thienylBr/CH_ 3 -Si(111) surfaces. Coverage of q = 0. 11 ± 0. 03 was achieved for Heckcoupled fluorostyrene. The Heck coupling reaction was versatile, vinylferrocene and protoporphyrin-IX were also successfully coupled to the surface, and low surface recombination velocity was maintained after the coupling chem. Thienybromide functionalization induced an interfacial dipole, which was studied via spectroscopic and electronic experimentation and was investigated by ab initio methods. The band-edge positions were favorably shifted 400 mV from those at the CH_ 3 -Si(111) surfaces. The <b>mixed</b> <b>monolayer</b> technique can be similarly applied to attach protected aldehydes.

40|$|AbstractThe {{interaction}} of the glycoalkaloid tomatine with monolayers of a phospholipid (dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine, DMPC), and sphingolipid (egg sphingomyelin), and cholesterol is compared. Using measurements of the surface pressure response {{as a function of}} the subphase concentration of tomatine, interfacial binding constants are estimated for <b>mixed</b> <b>monolayers</b> of DMPC and cholesterol and for those of egg sphingomyelin and cholesterol of mole ratio 7 : 3. The binding constants obtained suggest a stronger {{interaction of}} tomatine with DMPC and cholesterol <b>mixed</b> <b>monolayers,</b> reflecting easier displacement of cholesterol from its interaction with DMPC than from its interaction with egg sphingomyelin. Mixtures of tomatine and cholesterol are found to spread directly at the water–air interface and form stable monolayers, suggesting that cholesterol holds tomatine at the interface despite the absence of observed monolayer behavior for tomatine alone. The interaction of tomatine with DMPC and cholesterol monolayers is found to exhibit a pH dependence in agreement with previously reported results for its interaction with liposomes; in particular, the interaction is much less at pH 5 than at pH 7 or pH 9. It is found that while tomatine interacts strongly with monolayers containing sitosterol, it does not interact with monolayers containing sitosterol glucoside. The response of monolayers of varying composition of DMPC and cholesterol to tomatine is also examined.

40|$|AbstractMolecular {{associations}} between different sterols and dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine (DPPC) {{were examined in}} monolayers at the air/water interface. The sterols examined included cholesterol, 5 -cholesten- 3 -one, 4 -cholesten- 3 β-ol, 4 -cholesten- 3 -one, cholesteryl acetate, and cholesteryl methyl-and ethyl ether. Information about the long-range order in pure sterol monolayers, as well as lateral domain-formation in <b>mixed</b> sterol/DPPC <b>monolayers</b> {{was obtained from the}} lateral miscibility or distribution of NBD-cholesterol (present at 0. 5 mol%), as determined by monolayer epifluorescence microscopy. It was observed that the miscibility of NBD-cholesterol with the host sterol was limited in all monolayers except those of 5 -cholesten- 3 -one and 4 -cholesten- 3 -one, suggesting that only these monolayers lacked a long-range order present in the other sterol monolayers. Note that the term long-range order does not necessarily imply that the monolayer is solid. In <b>mixed</b> <b>monolayers</b> containing 3 β-OH sterols and DPPC, cholesterol formed laterally condensed domains whereas 4 -cholesten- 3 β-ol did not. This finding suggest that the sterol/DPPC interaction is sensitive to the position of the double-bond of the sterol molecule (Δ 5 versus Δ 4). Neither of the 3 -keto sterols formed laterally condensed domains with DPPC. Cholesteryl acetate, however, formed lateral domains with DPPC which were in part similar to those seen in the cholesterol/DPPC system. The domains formed were circular, indicating their fluid nature. <b>Mixed</b> <b>monolayers</b> containing either of the ether sterol derivatives failed to produce clearly defined condensed domains with DPPC, although both <b>mixed</b> <b>monolayers</b> had a surface texture which suggested some degree of nonuniform distribution of the fluorescent probe.
