500|$|As Altgens {{set up for}} {{a second}} {{photograph}} along Elm Street, he heard a sound that he recognized as gunfire, {{and saw that the}} President had been struck in the head. Altgens later wrote that his camera was focused and ready, [...] "but when JFK's head exploded, sending substance in <b>my</b> <b>direction,</b> I virtually became paralyzed.... Yet, many news people say I should have taken the picture anyway... I should have made the picture that I was set up to make. And I didn't do it." ...|$|E
500|$|Actor {{and writer}} Kevin Murphy, who {{provides}} {{the voice and}} puppetry of Tom Servo in the series, spoke disparagingly about the film in the book Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Amazing Colossal Episode Guide, writing, [...] "One of my darkest fears is that I'll one day make my own film, my story, <b>my</b> <b>direction,</b> my own crystalline vision of something so universal, it must needs be shared with {{the world on the}} silver screen. And I make the movie, and it turns out like Gunslinger, or any other Corman film—turgid, insipid, clichéd, confusing, every opportunity for artistic expression intentionally ignored." ...|$|E
500|$|He added, [...] "A British {{soldier was}} {{cut into pieces}} [...] broad {{daylight}} in London or near London. Will [...] British government ever, instead of putting that guy to justice, {{put him in a}} five-star hotel and say, 'Brother, what made you do this? Can we accommodate your grievances?' [...] That is what the West is expecting [...] us - to bring the killers of our brothers, to bring those who cut the noses of the Afghan women, to bring those who do suicide bombings in our wedding parties, to put them {{on the other side of}} the table and say, 'Brother, you represent our religion and I have lost <b>my</b> <b>direction.</b> Let us talk.' [...] That is because there is not much respect for the dignity of the nation called Afghanistan when it comes to geopolitics." ...|$|E

2500|$|For the score, Giacchino felt no {{pressure}} to align his music with the style or tone of previous MCU films, and [...] "in fact they {{encouraged me to}} go in <b>my</b> <b>direction,</b> so there were never any handcuffs put on me." [...] In regards to the title character, Giacchino felt the key [...] "was getting inside of him—not worrying {{so much about the}} magic stuff, more just thinking about who he was as a person, what he lost and then how that loss affected him. For me it's a very sad story, {{and a lot of the}} music has this very melancholy feel to it." [...] To particularly differentiate the score, and help create a [...] "mystical mood", Giacchino used a harpsichord and an electric sitar.|$|E
2500|$|On May 6, 2006, Allison Barker of the Associated Press {{reported}} that Lynch, who had completed her freshman year, avoids {{talking about her}} military service at school, despite wearing a brace on her left foot protecting nerve damage from her capture: [...] "I think people recognize who I am; they just don't make it obvious. That's good for me because it gives {{me the opportunity to}} blend in and not stick out and really experience the college life, just like they are." [...] Lynch also talked about her career plans and legacy: [...] "I know I want to do something with children. [...] I haven't really found <b>my</b> <b>direction,</b> with everything I've been through... I want people to remember me as being a soldier who went over there and did my job. Nothing special. I'm just a country girl at heart." ...|$|E

2500|$|Luke Goss as Prince Nuada Silverlance: King Balor's {{son and a}} {{martial arts}} expert of {{extraordinary}} proficiency. Goss was previously cast as mutant vampire Jared Nomak in del Toro's 2002 film Blade II, and the director approached the actor to be cast in Hellboy II. The only other actor considered for the part was Charlie Hunnam. Goss trained with action director and former Jackie Chan Stunt Team member, Brad Allan, learning sword and spear skills for six to seven months for his role. He and Anna Walton also learned ancient Gaelic from a dialog coach for their lines. Goss did not perceive Nuada as evil, explaining, [...] "It's issues, his people, he's {{part of what he}} truly believes. I don't think, really, he's so deluded... is driven by an ethic that was instilled by the person he has problems [...] his father, and inevitably, that leads into the conflict with him and Hellboy." [...] Goss also noted that his character admired and revered his twin sister, portrayed by Anna Walton. He said of the prince and the princess, [...] "There is an incestuous relationship that's not maybe overly obvious to everybody, but some people hopefully will pick up on the fact, certainly from <b>my</b> <b>direction</b> towards her." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{an article}} on 24 July 1908, Goltz denied the charge often made in the West that the Ottoman {{authorities}} had oppressed the Christian population of Macedonia and were committing systematic human rights abuses. Goltz wrote: [...] "Nevertheless, what the Westerners write about the Turkish government is not honest. Most of the time, {{it is the case}} that those Greeks, Bulgarians, and Serbs, who have had terrible experiences at the hands of their very own nationals, ask for Turkish protection. They know that the Turks are filled with generosity and compassion. They forgot and forgive. For being compassionate to the weak is part of their national traditions and they are proud of it." [...] Goltz denied the charge of widespread human rights abuses against the Christians, writing: [...] "Now, the Ottoman administration there is much better than it is thought. The Ottoman governors there, either generals or civilian employees, are young, healthy and knowledgeable men. If they are left to themselves, they can protect the peace perfectly well." [...] Anyhow, Goltz wrote the Europeans [...] "never think about the real owners of the country, the Turks, who constitute the majority in Macedonia … Ottoman staff officers, since 1887, under <b>my</b> <b>direction,</b> have prepared the maps of the Ottoman Balkans and we have found many Turkish villages, which have not been shown in other maps, besides Slav and Greek ones. Turks, in short, have a great right to be in Macedonia. Goltz advised his protégés in the Committee of Union and Progress: [...] "Be powerful so you will not be subject to injustice." [...] In 1910, Goltz advised Pertev to create a para-military youth organization that would serve to [...] "inspire a patriotic and soldierly spirit in youth, to fill them with joy at the fame and greatness of Turkey, {{and at the same time}} to give them a healthy physical education, which prepares them for the military profession." [...] Goltz further added that the purpose of education of youth was [...] "the formation of the patriotic sense, love of the fatherland, soldierly virtues and the toughening of the body, less so the technical preparation of the growing generation." ...|$|E
2500|$|.....my {{ears were}} saluted with the {{agreeable}} {{sound of a}} fall of water and advancing a little further I saw the spray arrise above the plain like a collumn of smoke which would frequently dispear again in an instant caused I presume by the wind which blew pretty hard from the S. W. I did not however loose <b>my</b> <b>direction</b> to this point which soon began to make a roaring too tremendious to be mistaken for any cause short of the great falls of the Missouri. ... I hurryed down the hill which was about 200 feet high and difficult of access, to gaze on this sublimely grand specticle. ... immediately at the cascade the river is about 300 yds. wide; about ninety or a hundred yards of this next the Lard. bluff is a smoth even sheet of water falling over a precipice of at least eighty feet, the remaining part of about 200 yards on my right formes the grandest sight I ever beheld, the hight of the fall is the same of the other but the irregular and somewhat projecting rocks below receives the water in it's passage down and brakes it into a perfect white foam which assumes a thousand forms in a moment sometimes flying up in jets of sparkling foam to the hight of fifteen or twenty feet and are scarcely formed before large roling bodies of the same beaten and foaming water is thrown over and conceals them. in short the rocks seem to be most happily fixed to present a sheet of the whitest beaten froath for 200 yards in length and about 80 feet perpendicular. the water after descending strikes against the butment before mentioned or that on which I stand and seems to reverberate and being met by the more impetuous courant they role and swell into half formed billows of great hight which rise and again disappear in an instant. this butment of rock defends a handsom little bottom of about three acres which is deversified and agreeably shaded with some cottonwood trees; in the lower extremity of the bottom {{there is a very}} thick grove of the same kind of trees which are small, in this wood there are several Indian lodges formed of sticks. ... from the reflection of the sun on the spray or mist which arrises from these falls there is a beatifull rainbow produced which adds not a little to the beauty of this majestically grand senery. after wrighting this imperfect discription I again viewed the falls and was so much disgusted with the imperfect idea which it conveyed of the scene that I determined to draw my pen across it and begin agin, but then reflected that I could not perhaps succeed better than pening the first impressions of the mind; I wished for the pencil of Salvator Rosa or the pen of Thompson, that I might be enabled to give to the enlightened world some just idea of this truly magnifficent and sublimely grand object, which has from the commencement of time been concealed from the view of civilized man; but this was fruitless and vain. I most sincerely regreted that I had not brought a crimee obscura with me by the assistance of which even I could have hoped to have done better but alas this was also out of my reach; I therefore with the assistance of my pen only indeavoured to traces some of the stronger features of this seen by the assistance of which and my recollection aided by some able pencil I hope still to give to the world some faint idea of an object which at this moment fills me with such pleasure and astonishment, and which of its kind I will venture to ascert is second to but one in the known world. ...|$|E
