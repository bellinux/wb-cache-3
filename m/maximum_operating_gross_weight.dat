5000|$|... #Caption: The Airborne Laser Lab was a gas-dynamic laser {{mounted in}} a {{modified}} version of a KC-135 used for flight testing. Similar to the commercial Boeing 707, the slightly smaller KC-135 was designed to military specifications and <b>operated</b> at high <b>gross</b> <b>weights.</b> The NKC-135A (S/N 55-3123) was extensively modified by the Air Force weapons Laboratory, and used in an 11-year experiment to prove a high-energy laser could be operated in an aircraft and employed against airborne targets.|$|R
40|$|A {{computer}} program for aircraft synthesis using a numerical optimizer {{was developed to}} study {{the application of the}} joined-wing configuration to transport aircraft. The structural design algorithm included the effects of secondary bending moments to investigate the possibility of tail buckling and to design joined wings resistant to buckling. The structural weight computed using this method was combined with a statistically-based method to obtain realistic estimates of total lifting surface weight and aircraft empty weight. A variety of 'optimum' joined-wing and conventional aircraft designs were compared on the basis of direct <b>operating</b> cost, <b>gross</b> <b>weight,</b> and cruise drag. The most promising joined-wing designs were found to have a joint location at about 70 percent of the wing semispan. The optimum joined-wing transport is shown to save 1. 7 percent in direct operating cost and 11 percent in drag for a 2000 nautical mile transport mission...|$|R
50|$|In December 2014 {{the company}} asked the FAA {{to allow the}} Transition to be <b>operated</b> at a <b>gross</b> <b>weight</b> of 1800 lb instead of the light-sport {{aircraft}} maximum weight of 1320 lb and have a stall speed of 54 kn instead of the category maximum of 45 kn. The company indicated that the increases were required to allow inclusion of structures to meet FMVSS ground operation safety regulations. The company had previously been granted an increase in <b>gross</b> <b>weight</b> of 110 lb and another LSA aircraft, the ICON A5, was granted a 250 lb exemption to meet FAA spin resistance requirements; this new application would increase the Transition's allowed weight {{by a total of}} 480 lb or 36%. During consultations the request for the weight increase was supported by the General Aviation Manufacturers Association, the Experimental Aircraft Association, the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association and the Light Aircraft Manufacturers Association. Only a few individuals expressed opposition to the request. The exemption was granted by the FAA on 19 June 2016.|$|R
50|$|The <b>gross</b> vehicle <b>weight</b> rating (GVWR), or gross {{vehicle mass}} (GVM) is the <b>maximum</b> <b>operating</b> weight/mass of a vehicle as {{specified}} by the manufacturer including the vehicle's chassis, body, engine, engine fluids, fuel, accessories, driver, passengers and cargo but excluding that of any trailers.

50|$|An aircraft's <b>gross</b> <b>weight</b> will {{decrease}} during a flight due to fuel and oil consumption. An aircraft's <b>gross</b> <b>weight</b> may also vary during a flight due to payload dropping or in-flight refuelling.|$|R
50|$|Limit load is {{constant}} for all <b>weights</b> above design <b>gross</b> <b>weight.</b> The limit load factor is reduced if <b>gross</b> <b>weight</b> is increased. But the LLF cannot be increased if the <b>gross</b> <b>weight</b> is decreased below the design <b>gross</b> <b>weight.</b> Engine mounts and other structural members {{are designed for}} the nominal LLF. The nominal or limit load Bn is the load which should only occur once (or only a very few times) during the lifetime of an aircraft. Bn may therefore only occur once during (e.g.) 60,000 hours of flying. No plastic deformation is allowed at this level of a load.|$|R
