25|$|In May 2001, Vitter {{authored}} {{an amendment}} to the No Child Left Behind Act, a reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, which required all secondary schools receiving federal funding to permit US military recruitment on school grounds and to provide the name, home phone number and address of every student enrolled to military recruiters, unless the student or the student's parent specifically opts out. In February 2007, Democratic Representative Michael M. Honda proposed the Student Privacy Protection Act of 2007 to change Vitter's amendment from requiring high schools to provide military recruiters with students' personal information unless they explicitly opt-out to requiring the student's explicit consent first. According to the Congressional Quarterly, Vitter stands behind the current provision. He stated that if it is changed, families who supported military recruiting may <b>miss</b> out <b>if</b> <b>required</b> to opt in.|$|R
50|$|Missed {{approach}} point (MAP or MAPt) is {{the point}} prescribed in each instrument approach at which a missed approach procedure shall be executed <b>if</b> the <b>required</b> visual reference does not exist. It defines the point for both precision and non-precision approaches wherein the missed approach segment of an approach procedure begins. A pilot must execute a <b>missed</b> approach <b>if</b> a <b>required</b> visual reference (normally the runway or its environment) is not in sight upon reaching the MAP or the pilot decides it is unsafe {{to continue with the}} approach and landing to the runway. The missed approach point is published in the approach plates and contains instructions for missed approach procedures to be executed at this point.|$|R
50|$|The minimum descent {{altitude}} (MDA) is {{the lowest}} altitude, expressed in feet above mean sea level, to which descent is authorized on final approach or during circle-to-land maneuvering in execution of a standard instrument approach procedure where no electronic glideslope is provided. Unlike with DH or DA, a missed approach need not be initiated immediately upon reaching the altitude. A pilot flying a non-precision approach may descend to the MDA and maintain it until reaching the missed approach point (MAP), then initiate a <b>missed</b> approach <b>if</b> the <b>required</b> visual reference was not obtained. An aircraft must not descend below the MDA until visual reference is obtained, and which the aircraft can land while performing normal maneuvers, which differs slightly from a DH/DA in that while the missed approach procedure must be initiated at or prior to the DH/DA, because of its vertical momentum, during a precision approach an aircraft may end up descending slightly below the DH/DA {{during the course of}} the missed approach.|$|R
