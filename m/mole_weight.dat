The principles states the units and measurement types used in allocations, i.e. where to account mass, volume, molar or energy balance. Since physical properties of hydrocarbons are constantly changing when hydrocarbons from various contributing sources are mixed, affected by heat transfer and transitions in pressure and temperature, owners of hydrocarbon in a commingled material cannot be allocated materials equal to what physically delivered from their well. For instance, two multiphase streams are commingled, one with oil of <b>mole</b> <b>weight</b> 107 and gas of 20 kg/kgmol, the other of 116 and 21 respectively, {{may result in a}} commingled stream of 115 kg/kgmol for the oil and <b>mole</b> <b>weight</b> of 20.3 kg/kgmol for the gas. The allocation principles account for this effect.|$|E

40|$|TutorialAlthough wet (oil injected) and dry (oil free) screw {{compressors}} {{are widely used}} in many applications, limited information is available regarding the pulsation, vibration, and noise problems associated with these types of compressors. This tutorial discusses such problems and includes case histories where field testing was performed, and provides design recommendations. Both wet and dry {{screw compressors}} normally generate pulsation at the pocket passing frequency (PPF) and its multiples. The pulsation amplitudes are affected by many variables such as <b>mole</b> <b>weight</b> of the gas, operating pressures, speed, screw profile, {{and shape of the}} discharge port. The pulsation amplitudes are further amplified by acoustical natural frequencies of the compressor/silencer/piping system. Dry screw compressors are generally supplied with suction and discharge silencers which are designed to attenuate the pulsation generated by the compressors. Most of the silencers are reactive type (Helmholtz filters), absorptive type, or a combination of these two. Although the silencers are designed to attenuate pulsation at certain frequencies, they can also amplify pulsation when the excitation frequencies are coincident with the acoustical natural frequencies of the silencer itself. Pulsation in the silencers can also increase the vibration levels of the compressor rotors and can cause electrical problems to be fed into the local bus. Therefore, the silencers should be carefully designed to attenuate the pulsation levels over a wide frequency band. Wet screw compressors typically do not have silencers, since oil separators are used. The oil separators are primarily designed to remove the oil from the gas, but the separators can also attenuate and/or amplify the pulsation generated by the compressor. The shell wall mechanical natural frequencies can also be excited by pulsation at multiples of the PPF, which can result in excessive noise levels and fatigue failures of the shell wall, attached small bore piping, instrumentation, and the oil injection lines...|$|E

40|$|Tutorialpg. 183 - 196 The {{proposed}} Fifth Edition of API 618 (?Reciprocating Compressors for Petroleum, Chemical, and Gas Industry Services?) incorporates {{significant changes}} in the section concerning pulsation and vibration control. There are still to be three ?design approaches,? but the requirements to perform certain analyses that were presented as optional in the Fourth Edition will now be dependent on pressure pulsation and for levels determined from the acoustical simulation. The confusion concerning when piping forced mechanical response calculations should be performed, which originated in the Fourth Edition, has been eliminated; forced response calculations are not required to satisfy API 618 Fifth Edition when pulsation levels are controlled properly. A separate article on pulsation and vibration control is being developed by the API 618 sub-task force on pulsation and vibration control as an appendix (annex) to API 618. This text will be a stand alone ?RP? (Recommended Practices) document in the API system, which would then by referenced by API 618 as well as other API standards (e. g., API 674 for Positive Displacement Pumps) for which pulsation and vibration control are an issue.

The purpose of this tutorial is to provide the user with a working knowledge of good engineering practices for pulsation and vibration control of reciprocating machinery in relatively high <b>mole</b> <b>weight</b> gases (e. g., natural gas), as well as an indepth understanding of the proposed changes in API 618 and the differing design philosophies.

30|$|Using C 6 + {{data for}} HCDP limit {{application}} {{on a particular}} pipeline gas, it is prudent that an appropriate split be employed. If we consider the specific gravity, molecular <b>weight,</b> <b>mole</b> fraction of C 6 + of a gas are known, the challenge facing the gas processor or end-user becomes one of splitting the C 6 + fraction into C 6 /C 7 /C 8 {{that can be used}} to predict the HCDP and phase behaviour of the gas by equation of state. Based on the observation reported by several researchers (Katz 1983; Lorenz et al. 1964; Pedersen et al. 1982; Ahmed et al. 1985) that lighter hydrocarbon systems exhibit exponential molar distribution, an equation is therefore formulated which could be used to appropriately split the C 6 + data after the calculation of the “quasi-mole fraction” of the individual C 6 + pseudocomponents from the application of three well-established hydrocarbon physical properties correlations.|$|R
40|$|While {{studying}} a mechanism of fibroin biosynthesis in the posterior silkgland of the silkworm larvae, an odd chromatographic interaction was observed between the silkgland RNA and a fibroin powder column. 1) A clear {{difference was found}} in respect of the elution pattern between RNAs prepared by a phenol method from the posterior gland of t h e normal larvae and of the genetic mutant incapable of synthesizing fibroin. 2) The difference disappeared when RNAs were chromatographed on a column of the methylated derivative instead of fibroin. 3) No marked difference could have been detected between the two RNAs {{with respect to the}} phosphorus-atomic absorption coefficient, ultracentrifugal behaviour and nucleotide composition. 4) RNA molecule of a higher <b>mole</b> cular <b>weight</b> and/or of a higher guanylic acid content is retained more firmly to fibroin. 5) K^+ ion is preferable to Na^+ ion in sharpening the chromatogram, and 10 ^- 3 M Mg^++ ion dissociates the fibroin - RNA complex completely. In view of these results, it was suspected that a specific biological interaction in vivo between fibroin and a template RNA(s) in the field of the protein biosynthesis is revived at least in part in this mild gradient elution chromatography of the silkgland RNA on a fibroin powder column. It may thus provide in principle a unique method of isolating a proteinspecific RNA molecule (s), based on a molecular-biological specificity of its own. 蛋白質の生合成とリボ核酸(RNA) との関係については多数の人々により種々様々の実験成績が蓄積され,その結果現在では特定のRNA分子におけるヌクレオチド単位の配列順序がそれを鋳型として合成される蛋白質のアミノ酸配列を規定するものと推論されている. しかしそれを直接的に示す実験結果は未だに得られていない. このような特異性を持つRNA. 分子を全RNA分子の中から分劃精製しようとする場合,ヌクレオチド単位配列の高度のvariabilityによる全分子の理化学的polydispersityを考えると,むしろ対応する蚕自質分子との間のin vivoにおける特異的相互作用一鋳型RNAの上に素材アミノ酸が配列重合し,または次段階においてそれが解離放出される際の一をin vitroにおいて可及的に復元させ,利用することが原理的にもつとも忠実な,かつ選択的な方法と考えられないであろうか. それはその蛋白質の化学構造に関して遺伝的にmodificationを受けている突然変異種があり,さらにその蛋白質が生物にとつて量,質的に高度に特徴的な表現型である場合には,とくに有力な手段となるであろう. かかる観点に立つて,特徴的なアミノ酸組成および配列(100 g蛋白質中のアミノ酸組成はグリシン 42. 8 g,アラニン 32. 4 g,セリン 14. 7 g,チロシン 11. 8 g… で,就中グリシンが 1 個おきに配列する) を持つ家蚕絹フィブロインに対応する一広義の鋳型一特異的RNAの分劃検索を行なつている著者らは,その特殊化された合成分泌器官である後部絹糸腺よりとり出されたRNAがフィブロイン粉末カラムに対して興味あるクロマトグラフ挙動をとることを観察した. 結果の一部は予報済みである...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — When using {{equations}} {{of state}} to predict the phase behavior of hydrocarbon mixtures, problems occur with the C 7 + fraction that exists in such mixtures. Minimizing such problems requires breaking down (splitting) the C 7 + fraction {{into a number of}} pseudo-components with a single carbon number; e. g. C 7, C 8, C 9 …, etc. Extensive compositional analyses of too many reservoir fluids {{from all over the world}} have shown exponential molar distributions (<b>mole</b> fraction/molecular <b>weight</b> relation) of the C 7 + pseudo-components. Hence exponential methods are extensively used by many researchers as a first choice for splitting the C 7 + fraction. Other researchers are still suggesting improvements and enhancements to such methods. This is due to their feasibility in the sense that they do not contain too many unknown or difficult-to-determine parameters. In addition, C 7 + characterization represents only a minor portion of the process of compositional reservoir simulation. This paper revisits the most common splitting methods that were presented in literature and have gotten a wide acceptance in the oil industry. A worthwhile aspect of the paper, however, is that it proposes an improvement to the Katz constant-parameter splitting method. The improved method compared well with other splitting methods for all tested data sets. Another aspect of the paper is that the program has been coded in an object-oriented manner, which offers flexibility in programming and allows the different parts of the code to be described easily and in a natural manner as if they were real world objects. Some examples that were cited in literature are presented. Index Term — C 7 + splitting; hydrocarbon plus fractions; phase behavior; equations of state; OOP application I...|$|R

The models were derived from multiple data sources including laboratory data, published data bases, published statistical models, and expert opinion. The inputs to the model include information about the compound (molecular weight and octonal–H 2 O partition coefficient) and the application temperature. One model included all three parameters as inputs and the other model only included information about the compound. The values for <b>mole</b> molecular <b>weight</b> ranged from 30 to 600 Da. The values for the log of the octonal–H 2 O partition coefficient ranged from – 3. 1 to 4. 34. The values for the application temperature ranged from 22 to 39 8 C. The predicted values of the log of permeability coefficient ranged from – 5. 5 to – 0. 08. Each model was a collection of rules that express the relationship of each input to the permeability of the compound through human skin. The quality of the model was determined by comparing predicted and actual fuzzy classification and defuzzification of the predicted outputs to get crisp values for correlating estimates with published values. A modified form of the Hamming distance measure is proposed to compare predicted and actual fuzzy classification. An entropy measure is {{used to describe the}} ambiguity associated with the predicted fuzzy outputs. The three input model predicted over 70 % of the test data within one-half of a fuzzy class of the published data.

Refractive index strongly depends on molecular <b>weight,</b> <b>mole</b> fraction and temperature. Experimental data were correlated by four parameters’ relationship for dependence of refractive index on mole fraction of poly(ethylene glycol) and by three parameters’ relationship for dependence on molecular weight of poly(ethylene glycol). Obtained data {{can serve as}} an input data for subsequent study of these binary systems and especially for study of colloidal systems of metal nanoparticles in dispersion surrounding consisting of water and poly(ethylene glycol). Especially these data on refractive index are important for determination of nanoparticle size and zeta potential by dynamic light scattering. Obtained data on refractive index have been employed for correct and accurate determination of nanoparticle size and zeta potential. The size of Au nanoparticles was determined by dynamic light scattering. For comparison of this determination also a transmission electron microscopy and UV–vis spectroscopy have been employed in very good agreement. The optical properties of Au nanoparticles’ colloidal solutions were analyzed with UV–vis spectroscopy and showed a significant absorption peak maximum at 530 nm...|$|R
40|$|Avogadro’s number, NA, is the {{fundamental}} physical constant that links the macroscopic physical world of objects {{that we can see}} and feel with the submicroscopic, invisible world of atoms. In theory, NA specifies the exact number of atoms in a palm-sized specimen of a physical element such as carbon or silicon. The name honors the Italian math-ematical physicist Amedeo Avoga-dro (1776 – 1856), who proposed that equal volumes of all gases at the same temperature and pressure contain the same number of molecules. Long af-ter Avogadro’s death, the concept of the mole was introduced, and it was experimentally observed that one <b>mole</b> (the molecular <b>weight</b> in grams) of any substance contains the same number of molecules. This number is Avogadro’s number, although he knew nothing of moles or the epony-mous number itself. Today, Avogadro’s number is for-mally defined to be the number of car-bon- 12 atoms in 12 grams of unbound carbon- 12 in its rest-energy electronic state. The current state of the art esti-mates the value of NA, not based on experiments using carbon- 12, but by using x-ray diffraction in crystal sili-con lattices {{in the shape of a}} sphere or by a watt-balance method.

The <b>weight</b> fractions of crystalline material (WFCM) in the specimens, determined from the Rietveld scale factors after correcting for adsorbed water and impurities, were 0. 878 (esd = 0. 014), 0. 919 (0. 014), and 0. 965 (0. 015), respectively. The A 1 mole % substitutions, inferred from the Rietveld cell parameters according to the method of Schulze (1984), were 10. 4 + _ 2. 5, 16. 5 + 2. 6, and 17. 1 + 2. 6, respectively.

40|$|The {{application}} of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy in {{the determination of}} nutrition labeling component data (NLCD) was investigated, {{with the intent of}} using this methodology as a primary method to calibrate FTIR instrumentation for NLCD confirmation or screening on a routine basis. Unlike previous NMR studies, this work used three strategies to attain accuracy and reproducibility of NLCD through: (i) appropriate setting of operational parameters for spectral acquisition; (ii) resonance selection by optimizing the signal in proportion to the nuclei population and (iii) integration of resonances by pre-defined fixed chemical shift ranges. Both of 13 C NMR spectra and 1 H NMR spectra were shown to provide robust and acceptable results on the condition of appropriate acquisition of spectra for quantization purposes and the adoption of standard procedures for spectral processing, integration and calculation purposes. A quantitative approach of NLCD including trans content was determined by the interpretation resonance signals of 13 C's and 1 H's from methylene groups presented in triglyceride complex of fats and oils. An alternative method based on partial-least-squares (PLS) calibrations was provided as well, the latter proved to be especially useful in dealing with overlapping bands frequently found in 1 H spectra. With the diagnostic provided by PLS, the trans and cis signals were shown to be separated in 1 H spectra. It is the premise for the trans fat determination based on 1 H spectra. Unit conversion from <b>mole</b> to <b>weight</b> % was addressed and a solution was developed based on NMR data per se, without significant assumptions. Validation involving the analysis of three different lipid types (model triacylglycerols, refined and hydrogenated oils) demonstrated that NMR predictions of NLCD were in good agreement with those results either from samples' actual values as well as those obtained using GC and FTIR predictions. Thus with appropriate integration of instrumentation, software and spectral processing accessories, both 13 C and 1 H NMR can determine NLCD, but with the capability to determine trans, 1 H NMR is more practical than 13 C NMR due to its much shorter spectral acquisition time. Thus NMR can serve as a primary method for the calibration of FTIR instrumentation, a practical instrumental method for routine NLCD determination and screening...|$|R
40|$|Watercress (Rorippa nasturtium-aquaticum) is {{a member}} of the Brassicaceae family. Increasing {{interest}} in healthy diets has turned the focus to watercress since it is known to contain one of the highest concentrations of the beneficial antioxidant phenethyl isothiocyanate (PEITC). This has exciting possibilities to breed a higher quality crop with increased concentrations of this key antioxidant providing a mechanism to aid in the prevention of cancer. Dwarfism is another desirable characteristic for many agricultural crops. A crop with a reduced stem length produces a stable increased yield and is easier to harvest as well as package. Dwarf mutants have been extensively characterized in many plant species and endogenous phytochrome Gibberellin (GA) is one of the several genes associated with the dwarf phenotype. The three candidate genes of particular interest are: GA 2 ox, GA 3 ox and GA 20 ox. GA 20 ox and GA 3 ox are involved in GA biosynthesis whilst GA 2 ox is involved in GA catabolism. The aim of my research was to establish a collection of watercress from around the world and breed watercress that not only has a reduced stem length but is also nutritionally beneficial therefore breed an ‘ideal’ watercress cultivar. Initial screening of the germplasm shows significant variability in stem length (ranging from 7 - 17 cm), stem diameter (ranging from 1. 58 - 3. 18 mm) and antioxidant concentrations (ranging from 80 - 140 mmol Fe 2 + equivalent per gram fresh weight). The antioxidant concentrations were assessed using an adapted antioxidant assay Ferric Reducing Ability of Plasma (FRAP) which revealed a ranking order for the watercress lines. Two lines with high FRAP values, Wx_ 0033 (143. 84 mmol Fe 2 + equivalent per gram fresh weight) and Wx_ 0011 (126. 44 mmol Fe 2 + equivalent per gram fresh weight), and one line with a low FRAP value, Wx_ 0038 (87. 49 mmol Fe 2 + equivalent per gram fresh weight), and also a control line Wx_ 0001 (130. 66 mmol Fe 2 + equivalent per gram fresh weight) was taken forward for further glucosinolate and isothiocyanate analysis. The lines did indeed vary in the concentration of glucosinolate and isothiocyanate. Wx_ 0001 had both the highest concentration of phenethyl glucosinolate, 19. 35 ?<b>moles</b> per gram <b>weight</b> and phenethyl isothiocyanate, 0. 20 mg/ml phenethyl isothiocyanate. The genetic diversity of the watercress lines held within the collection were assessed using the Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism (AFLP) technique revealing a higher level of variation within (76 %) each line than between (24 %). Variation in gene expression was analysed using microarrays and verified using real time PCR. From the various data collected and recorded from the watercress germplasm collection this has lead to a breeding programme successfully being initiated at the University of Southampton...|$|R
