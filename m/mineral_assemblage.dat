2500|$|Garnets {{are also}} useful in {{defining}} metamorphic facies of rocks. For instance, eclogite {{can be defined}} as a rock of basalt composition, but mainly consisting of garnet and omphacite. Pyrope-rich garnet is restricted to relatively high-pressure metamorphic rocks, such as those in the lower crust and in the Earth's mantle. Peridotite may contain plagioclase, or aluminium-rich spinel, or pyrope-rich garnet, and the presence of each of the three minerals defines a pressure-temperature range in which the mineral could equilibrate with olivine plus pyroxene: the three are listed in order of increasing pressure for stability of the peridotite <b>mineral</b> <b>assemblage.</b> Hence, garnet peridotite must have been formed at great depth in the earth. Xenoliths of garnet peridotite have been carried up from depths of [...] and greater by kimberlite, and garnets from such disaggegated xenoliths are used as a kimberlite indicator minerals in diamond prospecting. At depths of about [...] and greater, a pyroxene component is dissolved in garnet, by the substitution of (Mg,Fe) plus Si for 2Al in the octahedral (Y) site in the garnet structure, creating unusually silica-rich garnets that have solid solution towards majorite. Such silica-rich garnets have been identified as inclusions within diamonds.|$|E

Zircon is an integral petrographic component of the <b>mineral</b> <b>assemblages</b> present in fenites (rocks formed by alkaline metasomatism) associated with the 136 Ma-aged Chilwa Island carbonatite complex,Malawi. Zircon exhibits contrasting characteristics and properties across the fenite aureole that surrounds the carbonatite stock.
