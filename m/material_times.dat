50|$|The next {{heir to the}} Dunboyne barony after Edmond was the 2nd Baron's {{younger son}} Pierce (whose grandson, also named Pierce, was in time to inherit the title as the 5th Baron). In 1618 Pierce petitioned the Crown to declare his nephew illegitimate, {{on the grounds that}} while his parents had lived {{together}} as man and wife, his father was at all <b>material</b> <b>times</b> married to a daughter of Lord Cahir. There is {{no reason to think that}} the allegation was true, but King James I was reluctant to dismiss it out of hand. He wrote to Lord Dunboyne saying that he had no wish either to deprive his ward of his rights, or to deprive Pierce of any rights which might belong to him, and requiring the parties to submit their dispute to the Court of Chancery (Ireland). This led to a lawsuit which went on for three years and involved several hearings in different courts.Eventually in 1621 the Lord Chancellor of Ireland made a decree in favour of Lord Dunboyne, ordering his son Pierce to cease from interference with or disturbance of his peaceful enjoyment of his lands. This was in effect a victory for young Edmond, and when his grandfather died in 1624 he succeeded without any further trouble from his uncle, who died in 1626.|$|E

5000|$|In November 2016,Miguna earned unflattering {{spotlight}} when in a KTN TV {{talk show}} hosted by Jeff Koinange, he made satirical remarks against Esther Passaris, a fellow guest {{appearing on the}} show, in response to false allegations that Ms. Passaris had made against him. The two who had declared interest in the Nairobi gubernatorial seat slated for the upcoming 2017 General Elections were on the show to debate and canvass votes from Nairobi voters. Miguna's remarks ignited uproar from a few viewers although in several polls conducted shortly thereafter, more than 65% of viewers supported him. Gender Cabinet Secretary and FIDA demanded for an apology from him but he dismissed them as people who had not understood {{the context of his}} utterances. Host Koinange was pilloried by a few anti-Miguna elements for failing to restrain Miguna as he went on the [...] "attack" [...] against Passaris. Koinange later apologized and announced the end of his popular show on KTN. However, Koinange's termination of the show seemed not to have been connected to the controversy since he invited and hosted the wife of the Nairobi Governor, Evans Kidero, the very next day following the show. Koinange had also subsequently invited both Miguna and Passaris to his new show on Citizen TV but Miguna declined stating {{that he did not want}} side shows. According to some observers, JKL terminated its contract with KTN because Miguna had referred to the retired President, Daniel arap Moi, as corrupt. At all <b>material</b> <b>times,</b> Moi owned The Standard Group Limited and KTN. In other words, whereas the KTN owners made it look like the termination of the show was linked to the heated exchanges between Miguna and Passaris, it was the criticism of Moi on his own TV station that had buried JKL. Miguna had also claimed that his privacy rights were violated by the station and Mr. Koinange since an altered and distorted video that had been secretly recorded during the commercial break of the JKL show was published and widely circulated while the verbatim record of the actual debate was pulled off and purged. Miguna filed a complaint against The Standard Group Limited, KTN and JKL with the Media Complaint Commission against The Standard Group Limited, KTN and JKL for the alleged violations. He argued that Passaris attended the show as a fellow contestant for public office and not as a woman. Consequently, he took issue with those criticising him for having successfully deconstructed his opponent with facts, reason and logic.|$|E
40|$|We study vibrated {{granular}} media, investigating each of {{the three}} components of the energy flow: particle-particle dissipation, energy input at the vibrating wall, and particle-wall dissipation. Energy dissipated by interparticle collisions is well estimated by existing theories when the granular material is dilute, and these theories are extended to include rotational kinetic energy. When the granular material is dense, the observed particle-particle dissipation rate decreases to as little as 2 / 5 of the theoretical prediction. We observe that the rate of energy input is the weight of the granular <b>material</b> <b>times</b> an average vibration velocity times a function of the ratio of particle to vibration velocity. `Particle-wall' dissipation has been neglected in all theories up to now, but can play an important role when the granular material is dilute. The ratio between gravitational potential energy and kinetic energy can vary by as much as a factor of 3. Previous simulations and experiments have shown that E ~ V^delta, with delta= 2 for dilute granular material, and delta ~ 1. 5 for dense granular material. We relate this change in exponent to the departure of particle-particle dissipation from its theoretical value. Comment: 19 pages revtex, 10 embedded eps figures, accepted by PR...|$|E
40|$|According to {{many private}} {{historical}} works published in early Ch'ing, the peasant rebels {{were accused of}} having {{set fire to the}} Ming Tombs in 1644 on their way to invade Peking. On the other hand, there were also legends described how the Manchus further destroyed the Ming Tombs soon after they took over the rule of China. Such legendary incidents are still prevalent in modem historical writings, even though some contemporary scholars began to cast doubt on their credibility. Some contemporary scholars argue that only the Ting-ling (Tomb of Emperor Wan-li) had been burned down by the rebels; others even allege that the rebels had not ignited flame on any Ming Tombs at all. As for the role of the Manchus, a rather common ground in serious scholarship is that the Manchus had caused severe damage to the Ting-ling and the Te-ling (Tomb of Emperor Tien-ch'i). This article, however, demonstrates that at the <b>material</b> <b>times</b> the rebels had in reality cremated three Ming Tombs, whereas the Manchus were only responsible for the inflammation of the Ting-ling. The Manchus did kindle a destructive fire on the Te-ling, but it was in 1636, eight years before they began to rule China. 根據不少清初史籍所說，流賊在進攻北京途中，曾焚毀昌平十二明陵；亦有傳聞記述，清人入關後，再次摧毀十二陵。這兩個說法雖然深入人心，流傳不已，但近日已有學者懷疑其可信性。就前者而官，有人認為流賊祇焚毀了定陵；有人則強調流賊未嘗焚毀十二陵。就後者言，論者普遍相信清人毀壞了定陵和德陵。本文就紛紜眾說，細加考辨，力證流賊入京途中，曾焚毀康、昭、定三陵；而清人入主後，僅破壞定陵而已。清人雖曾焚毀德陵，但此事發生於崇禎九年(1636) ，即他們入主前八年...|$|E
