50|$|In August 2002, the BCG vaccine used in Finland was {{discontinued}} by {{the manufacturer}} after factory inspectors were dissatisfied with the manufacturing process. Finland switched to a Danish strain BCG vaccine which did not have marketing authorization in Finland. Despite lack of marketing authorization, the vaccine was offered and recommended to all Finnish newborns (ca. 55 000 - 60 000 per year), and parents were not told the vaccine had no marketing authorization as required by Finnish and European Union legislation. The vaccine was injected into the thigh of newborns, despite clear <b>manufacturer</b> <b>instructions</b> that the vaccine shall be administered into upper arm, and despite manufacturer's warning that injecting into a lower limb {{is associated with a}} greater number of adverse effects.|$|E
50|$|Large {{volumes of}} {{electrically}} conductive salt water, complex plumbing, and numerous electrical appliances housed {{in close proximity}} certainly pose a significant risk of damage to both person and property and require close attention to safety. All equipment should be used according to <b>manufacturer</b> <b>instructions.</b> Electrical equipment should be placed above water level whenever possible, and drip loops should always be used. Circuit limits should never be exceeded and all appliances should be plugged into {{ground fault circuit interrupter}} (GFCI) outlets. These can be purchased at any hardware store and are relatively easy to install. Plug in GFCI power strips are also readily available. Home monitoring equipment with water sensors can also be adapted for the home aquarist and used to alert the owner of power outages or water overflows. This equipment can allow for timely intervention in a potential disaster and provides an added sense of security for frequent travelers.|$|E

5000|$|Installation of {{a typical}} 10 Phasor PMU is a simple process. A phasor will be either a 3 phase voltage or a 3 phase current. Each phasor will, therefore, require 3 {{separate}} electrical connections (one for each phase). Typically an electrical engineer designs the installation and interconnection of a PMU at a substation or at a generation plant. Substation personnel will bolt an equipment rack {{to the floor of}} the substation following established seismic mounting requirements. Then the PMU along with a modem and other support equipment will be mounted on the equipment rack. They will also install the Global Positioning Satellite (GPS) antenna on the roof of the substation per <b>manufacturer</b> <b>instructions.</b> Substation personnel will also install [...] "shunts" [...] in all Current transformer (CT) secondary circuits that are to be measured.

5000|$|On May 28, 2010, the NHTSA {{issued a}} {{statement}} that the stacking of all-weather floor mats from any manufacturer {{on top of the}} factory floor mat could cause accelerator entrapment.

Further, drivers are reminded to ensure that any driver-side floor mats (whether they are the carpeted floor mat or all weather floor mat) are properly installed and restrained by the retention hooks on the floorboard. Depending on vehicle and floor mat design, it is possible for unsecured floor mats to interfere with accelerator or brake pedals in a wide range of vehicles.
