25|$|According to her survivors, {{the first}} torpedo struck just aft {{of the bridge}} and caused major damage. Apparently, it {{exploded}} the ship's magazine; the resulting blast sheared off everything forward of the point of impact, destroying completely the bridge, the chart room, and the officers' and petty officers' quarters. As she stopped dead in the water, unable to signal a distress message, a second torpedo struck about 40 feet forward of the fantail and carried away the after part of the ship above the keel plates and shafts and destroyed the after crew's quarters. Only the <b>midships</b> <b>section</b> was left intact.|$|E

500|$|The wreck {{site was}} {{designated}} as a 'Protected Place' in 2002 under the Protection of Military Remains Act 1986, 60 years after her sinking. Survivors described five torpedo hits on Repulse, four {{on the port side}} and one on the starboard side. The four portside hits purportedly were: two amidship, one abreast of the rear turret and one near the propellers. The starboard side hit was amidships. A 2007 diving expedition [...] could confirm only two of the hits by examination of the wreck: the portside hit near the propellers and the starboard hit amidship. Unfortunately, {{at the time of the}} expedition, the portside <b>midships</b> <b>section</b> of the wreck was buried in the ocean floor thus the claimed hits there could not be confirmed. However, the area abreast of the port rear turret was accessible though and no sign whatsoever of a torpedo hit - as described by survivors - was found to be there.|$|E

500|$|The {{waterline}} belt of the Admiral-class ships was [...] thick, angled 12° outwards {{partly to}} keep the belt inside the bulge structure and allow torpedo hits to vent to the atmosphere. This angle also increased the armor's relative thickness to horizontal, close-range fire, albeit {{at the cost of}} reducing its relative height which increased the chance of plunging shellfire going over or under it. This sloped belt made their armor comparable to the [...] found in the latest British dreadnoughts. It ran some , from the forward edge of 'A' barbette to the middle of 'Y' barbette.

The middle belt stretched between 'A' and 'Y' barbettes, ending in four-inch transverse bulkheads at each end. The upper belt only ran from 'A' barbette {{to the end of the}} machinery spaces and ended in another four-inch transverse bulkhead. Five of Hoods decks were armoured with thicknesses varying from , with the greatest thicknesses over the magazines and the steering gear. Immediately adjacent to 'A' and 'Y' barbettes the main deck was five inches thick to protect the magazines.|$|E

50|$|On 26 April 1942, she {{departed}} Key West {{in company}} with a convoy. Just over two hours out of port, a violent explosion lifted Sturtevants stern from the water, but caused no apparent damage. Thinking herself under submarine attack, the destroyer dropped two depth charge barrages. About a minute after she dropped the second barrage of charges, a second detonation rocked the ship. She began to settle rapidly, but on an even keel. Minutes later, a third explosion ripped her keel apart beneath the after deckhouse. The <b>midships</b> <b>section</b> sank immediately, and the stern settled soon thereafter. The bow, curiously, remained above water for several hours. Finally, however, all but the crow's nest disappeared beneath the waves. Sturtevant went down off Key West about 8 mi north of the Marquesas Keys. Fifteen of her crew were lost with the ship.|$|E
