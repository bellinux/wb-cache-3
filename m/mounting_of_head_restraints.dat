40|$|Since 1995 the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) has {{measured}} and evaluated the static geometry <b>of</b> <b>head</b> <b>restraints</b> on vehicle seats. Geome-try {{is important because}} a restraint positioned behind {{and close to the}} back <b>of</b> an occupant’s <b>head</b> is a nec-essary first step toward reducing neck injury risk in rear crashes. In recent years <b>head</b> <b>restraint</b> geometry in new model passenger vehicles has improved stead-ily. However, a restraint that does not remain close to the head during a crash cannot effectively support the head and neck, so the effectiveness of a restraint with good static geometry may be reduced by poor dy-namic response of a seatback or restraint cushion. In addition, the effectiveness of advanced seat and <b>head</b> <b>restraints</b> designed to move during a crash, either to improve geometry or reduce torso accelerations, can be evaluated only in dynamic tests. Thus, good ge-ometry is necessary but, by itself, not sufficient for optimum protection. Dynamic evaluations using a test dummy also are needed to assess protection against neck injury in rear crashes. Several insurance-sponsored organizations formed the International Insurance Whiplash Prevention Group to develop a seat/head restraint evaluation protocol, including a dynamic test. Tests using this protocol produce substantially different results among seat/head restraint combinations, even among those with active <b>head</b> <b>restraints.</b> IIHS published its first set of evaluations using the protocol in fall 2004.

40|$|Soft-tissue neck injuries, also termed AIS 1 neck injuries, {{are common}} after {{low-speed}} rear-end impacts. These injuries, {{which can be}} long-lasting, have increased in frequency {{during the past few}} decades. There is no consensus regarding injury mechanisms; however, injury criteria have been proposed, without yet being fully evaluated. Factors influencing the injury risk are identified, but rarely quantified. Validated injury criteria, and precise knowledge of factors influencing injury risk, are essential when developing restraints to reduce AIS 1 neck injuries in a variety of rear-end impact conditions. This thesis aims to evaluate, with valid models, risk factors and injury criteria applicable to improving safety systems for low-speed rear-end impacts. Madymo models of the BioRID and car seats were developed and validated. Sensitivity analyses were used to identify and evaluate occupant and seat-related factors; the BioRID I, in four seats selected from a neck-disability risk ranking, was exposed to two crash pulses. Paired comparison designs were applied to the NIC max outcomes in ranking the four seats: this was compared with a neck-disability risk ranking of seats. The real-life data used comprised a variety of unspecified rear-end impact conditions; therefore, a broad set of crash pulses was used to reduce the influence of crash pulse parameters on the NIC max. Linear regressions between NIC max and crash-pulse parameters were executed. The BioRID II, in three seats, was exposed to recorded crash pulses from 79 impacts, which involved 110 occupants with known injury outcome. Seat geometry and seating posture were varied to obtain a range of NIC max values for each occupant. Using diagnostic tests, the NIC max predictability of long-term AIS 1 neck injuries was evaluated. Finally, the BioRID II, in the three seats, was exposed to 20 recorded crash pulses with potential to cause neck injuries, and the influence <b>of</b> <b>head</b> <b>restraint</b> positions on long-term AIS 1 neck injury risk was analysed. The sensitivity analyses revealed recliner characteristics to be the most influential parameter for the high crash pulse; the <b>head</b> <b>restraint</b> position was the most influential for the low one. Exposing the seats to the crash-pulse demonstrated that the NIC max identified the ranks of the four seats in ranking. The regression analyses showed that the change of velocity during the first 85 ms of the impact correlated with NIC max; therefore, the &# 916;v 85 ms can potentially quantify impact severity. The diagnostic tests showed that the NIC max predicted long-term AIS 1 neck injuries for variations in seat geometry and seating posture. The relation between NIC max and injury outcome was used to establish risk curves for the NIC max. Evaluating the influence <b>of</b> <b>head</b> <b>restraint</b> position, it was found that neck injury risk is decreased by 0. 1 for approximately 2. 5 cm of backset reduction. Only for the most severe impacts, can a higher positioned <b>head</b> <b>restraint</b> significantly reduce the injury risk.

Combining these systems with technologies for cellular resolution functional imaging {{would provide a}} powerful approach to study neural dynamics during behavior. Here we describe an integrated two-photon microscope and behavioral apparatus that allows cellular resolution functional imaging of cortical regions during epochs <b>of</b> voluntary <b>head</b> <b>restraint.</b> Rats were trained to initiate periods of restraint up to 8  s in duration, which provided the mechanical stability necessary for in vivo imaging while allowing free movement between behavioral trials. A mechanical registration system repositioned the head to within a few microns, allowing the same neuronal populations to be imaged on each trial. In proof-of-principle experiments, calcium-dependent fluorescence transients were recorded from GCaMP-labeled cortical neurons. In contrast to previous methods for <b>head</b> <b>restraint,</b> this system {{can be incorporated into}} high-throughput {{operant conditioning}} systems...|$|R
40|$|A problem {{solution}} {{to create the}} car chairs using modern software complexes (CAE) based on the finite elements is capable to increase an efficiency of designing process significantly. Designing process {{is complicated by the}} fact that at present there are no available techniques focused on this sort of tasks. This article shows the features to create the final element models (FEM) of the car chairs having three levels of complexity. It assesses a passive safety, which is ensured by the developed chair models with passive <b>head</b> <b>restraints</b> according to requirements of UNECE No 25 Regulations, and an accuracy of calculation results compared with those of full-scale experiments. This work is part of the developed technique, which allows effective development of the car chair designs both with passive, and with active <b>head</b> <b>restraints,</b> meeting the requirements of passive safety. By results of calculations and experiments it was established that at assessment by an UNECE No 25 technique the "rough" FEM (the 1 st and 2 nd levels) can be considered as rational (in terms of effort to its creation and task solution and by the errors of results), and it is expedient to use them for preliminary and multiple calculations. Detailed models (the 3 rd level) provide the greatest accuracy (for accelerations the relative error makes 10 %, for movements it is 11 %, while in comparison with calculations, the relative error for a model <b>of</b> <b>head</b> <b>restraint</b> only decreases by 5 % for accelerations and for 9 % for movements). The materials presented in the article are used both in research activities and in training students at the Chair of Wheel Vehicles of the Scientific and Educational Complex "Special Mechanical Engineering" of Bauman Moscow State Technical University. </p...|$|R
40|$|Although {{typically}} {{classified as}} AIS 1, whiplash injuries continue {{to represent a}} substantial societal problem with associated costs estimated at over $ 5 billion annually in the US. The primary objective {{of this study was}} to determine the effects <b>of</b> seatback and <b>head</b> <b>restraint</b> design parameters on occupant response in rear impact. Rear impact sled tests were conducted using the Hybrid III mid-sized male (50 M) dummy seated in a modified production seat, which allowed for the adjustment of recliner stiffness, seatback cushion stiffness, and <b>head</b> <b>restraint</b> height. Instrumentation provided measurements of neck forces and moments, head motion relative to the torso, seatback rotation, and head contact. An on-board digital video camera recorded dummy kinematics. Results from this study indicate that the risk of whiplash injury is not simply related to <b>head</b> <b>restraint</b> position, but is dependent on a combination of factors related to both <b>head</b> <b>restraint</b> and seatback design...|$|R
50|$|The 2000-2005 GL8 is {{a similar}} version of the first-generation Pontiac Montana, and the 2005+ GL8 {{is similar to the}} Pontiac Montana SV6. The Pontiac Montana came in both short- and long-wheelbase models. The Pontiac Montana {{was one of the few}} minivans which {{provided}} seating for eight. For 2001, the Montana received a new steering wheel with the Pontiac logo which replaces the one with the PONTIAC letters. For 2003, the sport-style <b>head</b> <b>restraints</b> were dropped in favor <b>of</b> the conventional <b>head</b> <b>restraints</b> the Venture and Silhouette offered; and the anti-lock brakes became optional, as well as for the Venture, but remained standard for the Silhouette before Oldsmobile's demise in 2004.|$|R
