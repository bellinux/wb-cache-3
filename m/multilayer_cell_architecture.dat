40|$|In {{order to}} provide mobile {{worldwide}} communication services, cellular systems can {{be based on a}} <b>multilayered,</b> multisized <b>cells</b> <b>architecture</b> characterized by the use of different technologies. Satellites can cover lightly populated areas, as well as those areas where other means cannot be used (like the sea); ® xed base stations, with different transmission powers and thus different cell sizes, can cover relatively highly populated areas. As a result, a given area could simultaneously be served by more than one Base Station, and the structure of such a system must be carefully designed. A Hierarchical Architecture (HA) scheme is a possible solution. HA is based on a multilevel cell con ® guration: microcells (or even indoor picocells) cover more densely populated areas and are given the majority of the traf ® c load as they are able to operate with very high capacity, while overlaying macrocells (or satellitar cells) provide a group of over ¯ ow channels. Occasionally, when microcells are not able to satisfy channel requests, the over ¯ ow channels are consumed. HA schemes are divided in two categories: Reversible Hierarchical (RH) and Non Reversible (NRH). The difference is given by the handover directions between cells allowed. In a RH handover, attempts between macrocells and microcells occur in both directions. This paper compares RH and NRH schemes by means of an analytical model based on birth-death processes. The main performance indexes and the control overhead are shown. KEY WORDS: Cellular systems; hierarchical network. 1...|$|R

40|$|Biofilm {{formation}} {{is thought to}} result from the concerted action of primary attachment to a specific surface and accumulation in <b>multilayered</b> <b>cell</b> clusters. Here we describe the isolation and characterization of transposon (Tn 917) mutants of Staphylococcus epidermidis O- 47 which were biofilm negative in the polystyrene microtiter plate assay. Among 5, 000 Tn 917 insertion mutants, 4 biofilm-negative mutants were isolated. Each mutant carried one copy of Tn 917. The mutants {{were divided into two}} phenotypic classes: class A (mut 1 and mut 1 a) and class B (mut 2 and mut 2 a). Mutants of phenotypic class A lacked four cell surface proteins, were less hydrophobic, and were affected in primary attachment to polystyrene, but were still able to form <b>multilayered</b> <b>cell</b> clusters. They were able to form a biofilm on a glass surface, a trait that was even more pronounced than in the wild-type stain O- 47. Loss of several surface proteins might have led to the reduced surface hydrophilic structures, thus favoring primary attachment to a glass surface and leading to subsequent biofilm formation. Mutants of phenotype class B were able to attach to polystyrene but were unable to form <b>multilayered</b> <b>cell</b> clusters, had unchanged cell surface proteins and hydrophobicity, and were unable to form a biofilm on a glass surface, mut 1 and mut 2 could be complemented by wild-type DNA fragments containing the Tn 917 insertion sites of mut 1 and mut 2, respectively. The complemented biofilm-positive clone mut 1 (pRC 20) produced a 60 -kDa protein which is postulated to function as the adhesin for binding to plastic.

To delineate the role of apoptosis in the process of cyst formation, MDCK cells were transfected with the bcl- 2 gene. Characterization of apoptosis was studied by morphological and biochemical methods. ResultsBcl- 2 overexpression conferred resistance to apoptosis. Cultured in collagen gel, Bcl- 2 transfectants rarely formed a simple epithelial cyst, but instead remained as a <b>multilayer</b> <b>cell</b> aggregate containing central or multiple lumens, or even developing into branching structures.

40|$|Oxygen and glucose {{supply is}} one of the {{important}} factors for the growth and viability of the cells in cultivation of tissues, e. g., spheroid, <b>multilayered</b> <b>cells,</b> and three-dimensional tissue construct. In this study, we used finite element methods to simulate the flow profile as well as oxygen and glucose supply to the <b>multilayered</b> <b>cells</b> in a microwell array chip for static and perfusion cultures. The simulation results indicated that oxygen supply is more crucial than glucose supply in both static and perfusion cultures, and that the oxygen supply through the wall of the perfusion culture chip is important in perfusion cultures. Glucose concentrations decline with time in static cultures, whereas they can be maintained at a constant level over time in perfusion cultures. The simulation of perfusion cultures indicated that the important parameters for glucose supply are the flow rate of the perfusion medium and the length of the cell culture chamber. In a perfusion culture chip made of oxygen-permeable materials, e. g., polydimethylsiloxane, oxygen is hardly supplied via the perfusion medium, but mainly supplied through the walls of the perfusion culture chip. The simulation of perfusion cultures indicated that the important parameters for oxygen supply are the thickness of the flow channel and the oxygen permeability of the walls of the channel, i. e., the type of material and the thickness of the wall...|$|R

This study established a novel 3 -dimensional (3 -D) cell invasion model for direct microscopic observation of oral cancer cell invasion into the underlying basement membrane and connective tissue stroma. A <b>multilayer</b> <b>cell</b> construct was developed using the OptiCell chamber, consisting of a lower layer of oral mucosa fibroblasts embedded in collagen gel and an overlaying upper layer of oral cancer cells. The two layers are separated by a basement membrane composed of reconstituted extracellular matrix. To verify the applicability of the <b>cell</b> invasion model, <b>multilayer</b> <b>cell</b> constructs of oral squamous cell carcinoma and oral mucosal fibroblasts were exposed to extrinsic urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) or plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI- 1), which are known effectors of cell migration.

Microscopic study showed that the presence of uPA enhanced cell invasion, while PAI- 1 inhibited cell migration. Western blot and zymographic analysis demonstrated that hypoxia up-regulated uPA and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) expression and activity; conversely, PAI- 1 level was down-regulated in response to hypoxic challenge as compared to normoxic condition.
