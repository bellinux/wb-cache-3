Barjatya's previous films, the male lead is called Prem. The story combined elements of Hindu tradition to set itself up as a film of cultural significance and was constructed differently than Barjatya's earlier films. Barjatya hoped that the film would be remembered as the first to tackle the definitions and dynamics of a marriage. In an interview with Times of India Barjatya said, he kept in <b>mind</b> <b>all</b> the novels of Saratchandra Chatterjee while making Vivah.

Lastly, an Alaska conversion could not satisfy the navy's goal of having new aircraft carriers quickly, as the work needed to modify the ships into carriers would entail long delays.

2500|$|A central {{aspect of}} Buddhist theory of karma is that intent (cetanā) matters and is {{essential}} {{to bring about a}} consequence or phala [...] "fruit" [...] or vipāka [...] "result".

In the Buddhist traditions, life aspects affected by the law of karma in past and current births of a being include the form of rebirth, realm of rebirth, social class, character and major circumstances of a lifetime.
