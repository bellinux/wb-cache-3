Dating clubs, for example, enable {{men and women to}} meet each other; magazines provide a way for advertisers to find an audience, and computer operating system vendors provide software that applications users and applications developers can use together. When devising pricing and investment strategies, <b>multi-sided</b> <b>platforms</b> must account for interactions among the demands of multiple groups of customers. In theory, the optimal price to customers {{on one side of the}} platform is not based on a markup formula such as the Lerner condition, and price does not track marginal cost. Indeed, many actual platform businesses charge one side little or nothing-shopping malls seldom charge shoppers; operating system vendors give developers many services for free; most Internet portals and free television providers do not charge viewers. Competition among platforms takes place in multi-sided markets in which seemingly distinct customer groups are connected through interdependent demand and a platform that, acting as an intermediary, internalizes the resulting indirect network externalities. <b>Multi-sided</b> <b>platforms</b> arise in many economically significant industries from media to payment systems and software; they arise in bricks and mortar industries such as shopping malls as well as information-based industries such as portals...|$|R

40|$|Chapter 1 gives a brief {{introduction}} to the dissertation. Chapter 2 describes {{the functioning of the}} broadcasting market, with particular emphasis on the platforms involved, in order to prepare the reader for the analysis of platform competition strategies that follows. I discuss so-called “multi sided market theory”, and describe some examples of platforms. In this context I point out that the broadcasting sector involves both vertical integration, horizontal integration and <b>multi-sided</b> market <b>platforms,</b> and the theme of access to platforms is discussed with reference to all three types. In chapter 3 I stress that <b>multi-sided</b> <b>platforms</b> are pervaded by externalities. For this reason I deal with price allocation on {{the two sides of the}} market in order to demonstrate that price allocation by the platform is not neutral. Then I discuss the existence of price differences in one-sided and two-sided markets with both single homing and multihoming, and with exclusive and non-exclusive services. In chapter 4 under the leitmotiv of the evolution of pluralism of information, I review the main Italian Constitutional Court judgments on this topic and the ex ante regulation of the broadcasting sector in Italy, verifying whether the existing antitrust limits are still consistent with the current level of technology, considering the DVB-T broadcasting technique and the sale of frequencies on the secondary market. In chapter 5 I describe the various relevant broadcasting markets in accordance with European Commission case decisions. I demonstrate that the activities of <b>multi-sided</b> broadcasting <b>platforms</b> are subject to Article 81 and 82 of the European Treaty, just like any other integrated platform, since in any case they can determine input or customer foreclosure. Furthermore I deal with the relationship between media broadcasting and the social value of sport with reference to the many antitrust cases in the broadcasting sector concerning the sale of sports event rights to media platforms, and I discus Italian Law 9 / 2008 which establishes the collective trading of such rights. Chapter 6 considers the issue of access to content by focusing on emerging <b>multi-sided</b> <b>platforms.</b> I compare them with the vertically integrated platforms and discuss the potential of <b>multi-sided</b> <b>platforms</b> to remove entry barriers to the sector by means of unbundling, which is made possible by the must-offer and must-carry obligations introduced into Italy by the most recent legislation.

40|$|PRELIMINARY VERSION The {{economics}} of two-sided markets or <b>multi-sided</b> <b>platforms</b> has emerged {{over the past}} decade {{as one of the most}} active areas of research in economics and strategy. The literature has constantly struggled, however, with a lack of agreement on a proper definition: for instance, some existing definitions imply that retail firms such as grocers, supermarkets and department stores are <b>multi-sided</b> <b>platforms</b> (MSPs). We propose a definition which provides a more precise notion of MSPs by requiring that they enable direct interactions between the multiple customer types which are affiliated to them. Several important implications of this new definition are derived. First, cross-group network effects are neither necessary nor sufficient for an organization to be a MSP. Second, our definition emphasizes the difference between MSPs and alternative forms of intermediation such as “re-sellers ” which take control over the interactions between the various sides, or input suppliers which have only one customer group affiliated as opposed to multiple. We discuss a number of examples that illustrate the insights that can be derived by applying our definition. Third, we point to the economic considerations that determine where firms choose to position themselves on the continuum between MSPs and resellers, or MSPs and input suppliers...|$|R
40|$|In {{the last}} decade a number of Internet-based <b>multi-sided</b> <b>platforms</b> have emerged that provide free {{services}} to, in some cases, millions of businesses. More such platforms are being spawned as the Internet-based economy grows. This Article argues that under current norms in adversarial proceedings, such as those involving competition policy, these platforms are likely to face large numbers of complaints in multiple jurisdictions, a substantial likelihood {{that at least one}} of these complaints will result in a false-positive decision against the platform, and material risk of a false-positive decision that results in catastrophic consequences. These effects result from a combination of business users of free services receiving a free litigation option they can pursue if they have any complaints; an adverse-selection problem that results from free services being particularly attractive to start-ups that do not have or want to invest capital in their businesses; and the sheer number of free-business users resulting in a high cumulative probability of at least one false-positive decision. After documenting these phenomena, this Article argues that government policymakers, including competition authorities and courts, should adopt a heightened level of scrutiny concerning complaints from free business users. This heightened level of scrutiny is necessary to counteract the impact of excessive litigation on innovation by <b>multi-sided</b> <b>platforms...</b>|$|R
40|$|AbstractExpectation of both {{sales and}} profit {{acts as an}} {{incentive}} structure for complementors, such as software vender, record rebels, TV program studio and so on. Because this expectation changes along with the product lifecycle progress, complementors’ behavior tends to be undesirable for <b>multi-sided</b> <b>platform</b> operators. Thus <b>multi-sided</b> <b>platform</b> operators have to manage the quality and variety of complements developed by external companies in order to sustain their sound ecosystem and to keep them growing. Otherwise the moral hazard problems between <b>multi-sided</b> <b>platform</b> operators and complementors cause the market failure of <b>multi-sided</b> <b>platform</b> to destroy their ecosystem.

40|$|Many {{organizations}} are adopting business intelligence and analytics systems {{in order to}} cope with the increasing digitalization of data intensive environments. In this paper, we study the role of self-service business intelligence (SSBI), a certain capability provided by a business intelligence system, in enabling organizational agility. In particular, the research question we address is as follows: How does self-service business intelligence enable organizational agility in a <b>multi-sided</b> <b>platform?</b> We focus on two types of organizational agility – namely, market capitalizing agility and operational adjustment agility – and identify how SSBI enables these capabilities in a <b>multi-sided</b> <b>platform</b> environment. We have conducted 12 qualitative interviews by focusing on the biggest digital marketplace of Norway, Finn. no. Our results indicate that SSBI {{plays an important role in}} enabling 1) market capitalizing agility by providing better understanding of supply and demand participants, more access to traffic data and user clickstreams, fast response to requests, and more access to supply and demand navigation behavior and 2) operational adjustment agility by redefining current organizational structures, empowering organizational employees, providing equal access to organizational level data and opportunities for data manipulation. The findings provide an empirical evidence for the role of SSBI in enabling organizational agility within the context of <b>multi-sided</b> <b>platform</b> environment...|$|E
40|$|A {{company that}} {{operates}} a <b>multi-sided</b> <b>platform</b> must convince participants {{to pay an}} affiliation fee to access the platform. The challenge is to determine {{what it will take}} to motivate the participants to pay to collaborate with each other. To motivate participants to pay an affiliation fee, a <b>multi-sided</b> <b>platform</b> must deliver unique value to the various stakeholder groups its sides represent. For example, if a platform is designed to generate revenue from three stakeholder groups: developers, users and researchers, it must deliver unique value to each of these three groups. Developers must receive more value from participating in the platform than the value received from not participating in the platform. The same holds true for users and researchers. To generate revenue, a platform must be designed to deliver compelling value propositions for each stakeholder group. To illustrate how this can be achieved, we will describe five lessons learned while defining value propositions for a technology company...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{research}} analyzes {{why and how}} Software as a Service (SaaS) ventures {{can succeed}} or fail using the two forms of free business models: freemium and free based on a <b>multi-sided</b> <b>platform.</b> Software as a Service ventures nowadays need a strong market presence and visibility to be financially sustainable, {{and that is why}} they are constantly innovating methods to reach solvency. Many of those companies chose free business models to reach that market presence and economic growth. Academic research in this subject is very limited, and there is no framework or guide that shows how companies using these business models can succeed. The aim of this research is to address that gap and determine the key factors that lead to success for ventures using these business models. The researchers‘ approach of understanding, analyzing and deciphering these business models stands on a qualitative open-ended research strategy with case studies, backed by interviews of companies using these business models. The findings are based on the gathered and analyzed data from the case studies and the interviews. The result of this research is the classification of key factors in three major groups: Customers, Development Strategy, and Business Sustainability.

40|$|Online media {{platforms}} {{have the}} characteristics of a particular type of market known as 'multi-sided'. These businesses create value by bringing advertisers and users together. Access to user data is critical to this process. On the basis of economic literature, the features of <b>multi-sided</b> <b>platforms</b> will be discussed. It will be argued that {{the characteristics of}} <b>multi-sided</b> <b>platforms</b> increase the likelihood that successful companies become dominant due to the existence of indirect network effects. In these circumstances, dominant platforms may foreclose competition by raising barriers to entry in the large collections of user data. This may give rise to access problems for competitors and new entrants that need access to data gathered by dominant platforms in order to provide competing or complementary services. A comparative legal analysis will be used to assess the standards that apply in the United States (US) and the European Union (EU) for finding liability for refusals to deal under antitrust or competition law. The private antitrust cases that have already occurred regarding access to user data in the US show that the scope of applicability of the essential facilities doctrine is very limited after the judgment of the Supreme Court in Trinko. Although the European Commission and the Court of Justice seem to be willing to accept liability for a refusal to deal more easily than their US counterparts, high legal hurdles still have to be met under the essential facilities doctrine in the EU. Nevertheless, there are scenarios in which liability for refusals to give access to data will likely be accepted in the EU...|$|R
40|$|<b>Multi-sided</b> <b>platforms</b> such as exchanges, search engines, social {{networks}} and software platforms create value by assembling and serving communities {{of people and}} businesses. They generally come into being to solve a transaction problem that prevents agents from getting together to exchange value. An essential feature of these platforms is that they promote positive externalities between members of the community. But as with any community, there are numerous opportunities for people and businesses to create negative externalities, or engage in other bad behavior, that can reduce economic efficiency and, in the extreme, lead to {{the tragedy of the}} commons. <b>Multi-sided</b> <b>platforms,</b> acting selfishly to maximize their own profits, often develop governance mechanisms to reduce harmful behavior. They also often develop rules to manage many of the same kinds of problems that beset communities subject to public laws and regulations. They enforce these rules through the exercise of property rights and, most importantly, through the bouncer 2 ̆ 7 s right to exclude agents from some quantum of the platform including prohibiting them from the platform entirely. Private control is likely to be more efficient than social control in dealing with negative externalities on platform communities because the platform owner can monitor bad behavior more closely and deal with this behavior more expeditiously than a public regulator. The courts and antitrust authorities should exercise caution in finding anticompetitive exclusion when that exclusion is conducted as part of a governance mechanism for dealing with bad behavior of some platform users that harm other users...|$|R
