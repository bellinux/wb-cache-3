25|$|On July 6, 2010, the Seattle Mariners trailed {{the visiting}} Kansas City Royals 3–2 in the 8th inning of a game. With runner Ichiro Suzuki on first {{base for the}} Mariners, Mariners {{designated}} hitter Russell Branyan hit a double down the right field line. As Royals outfielder David DeJesus attempted to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>play</b> on the ball, a young fan reached onto the field {{and picked up the}} ball. The play was ruled an automatic double, and the umpires ruled that Branyan would take second base and that Ichiro would take third base, denying him a potential opportunity to score on the play. Both Ichiro and Branyan would be stranded on the bases, and the Royals held on for the 3–2 victory.|$|E
25|$|On the 49ers' next drive, Montana {{called a}} pass play on third down. With the New York defense {{covering}} {{all of his}} receivers, Montana was forced to move outside the pocket to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>play.</b> Lawrence Taylor was the first Giant {{to try to bring}} Montana down, with Leonard Marshall trailing the play after getting up from a Tom Rathman block earlier in the sequence. Taylor swiped at Montana but missed, only briefly holding him up. Marshall, charging from Montana's blind side, was {{able to take advantage of}} the slowing of the quarterback's momentum and drilled him hard in the back. Montana was already suffering from a lingering back injury and Marshall's hit broke a finger on his throwing hand and gave him a severe concussion, as Montana struggled to stand for the remainder of the game. The 49ers almost turned the ball over as Marshall's hit caused a fumble, but the ball skipped past Giants cornerback Mark Collins and lineman Steve Wallace recovered enabling the 49ers to punt.|$|E

[...] A calculation system computes the number of plays made league-wide at each position and a plus-minus total rating for each player compared to a league average player. [...] For example, if Heyward made a play that only 20% of right fielders would make, he was credited with [...]8 points – or, 1 point minus [...]20.

Phil Simms threw four interceptions but coach Bill Parcells denied he was struggling, [...] "ou'd like not to take a sack in the scoring zone, but sometimes it's hard {{to know when to}} throw it away. Two of Phil's interceptions were rebounds {{that had nothing to do}} with the quarterback. On the interception on fourth and 14 at the end, he was trying to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>play.</b> I think I would have thrown there, too. The other interception was his mistake.

500|$|Mileena was {{the first}} evil female {{character}} {{to appear in the}} series, created by John Tobias for Mortal Kombat II simply to accommodate another palette-swapped character. Tobias recalled: [...] "I took advantage of Kitana and Mileena being masked sisters to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>play</b> on the veil myth… One sister is beautiful. One is ugly. One is good. One is evil. Choose wisely before asking one on a date." [...] According to Acclaim Entertainment's producer Robert O'Farrell, the game was given two female fighters so it would better compete against Capcom's Street Fighter II, which had only one. Mortal Kombat co-creator and producer Ed Boon described the sisters as the [...] "female versions of Scorpion and Sub-Zero". Since her debut, Mileena's characteristic weapon is a pair of sharpened, dagger-like sai, that at first she has been using in combat only as projectiles and during some of her finishing moves (eventually, the sai were given more use in Mortal Kombat 2011). Only in Mortal Kombat Gold does she use a longsword (similar to that of Scorpion in Mortal Kombat 4) as her primary physical weapon. Prior to the release of Mortal Kombat 2011, Mileena was one of the five [...] "legendary characters" [...] spotlighted by Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment, alongside the likes of Scorpion and Sub-Zero. Her MK2011 X-ray attack was altered to incorporate sai stabbings after fan feedback [...] "to fit Mileena as far as her style, her brutality." ...|$|E
