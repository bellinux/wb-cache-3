50|$|The {{most common}} fuel {{electrode}} material is a Ni doped YSZ, however, under high steam partial pressures and low hydrogen partial pressures at the Ni-YSZ interface caused oxidation of the nickel {{and leads to}} irreversible degradation. Perovskite-type lanthanum strontium manganese (LSM) is also commonly used as a cathode material. Recent {{studies have found that}} doping LSM with scandium to form LSMS promotes mobility of oxide ions in the cathode, increasing reduction kinetics at the interface with the electrolyte and thus leading to higher performance at low temperatures than traditional LSM cells. However, further development of the sintering process parameters is required to prevent precipitation of scandium oxide into the LSM lattice. These precipitate particles are problematic because they can impede electron and ion conduction. In particular, the processing temperature and concentration of scandium in the LSM latice are being researched to optimize the properties of the LSMS cathode. New materials are being researched such as lanthanum strontium <b>manganese</b> <b>chromate</b> (LSCM), which has proven to be more stable under electrolysis conditions. LSCM has high redox stability, which is crucial especially at the interface with the electrolyte. Scandium-doped LCSM (LSCMS) is also being researched as a cathode material due to its high ionic conductivity. However, the rare-earth element introduces a significant materials cost and was found to cause a slight decrease in overall mixed conductivity. Nonetheless, LCSMS materials have demonstrated high efficiency at temperatures as low as 700 °C.|$|E
40|$|Ferritic {{stainless}} steels are a leading candidate material {{for use as}} an SOFC interconnect, but have the problem of forming volatile chromia species that lead to cathode poisoning. This project has focused both on optimization of ferritic alloys for SOFC applications and evaluating {{the possibility of using}} alternative materials. The initial efforts involved studying the oxidation behavior of a variety of chromia-forming ferritic {{stainless steels}} in the temperature range 700 - 900 C in atmospheres relevant to solid oxide fuel cell operation. The alloys exhibited a wide variety of oxidation behavior based on composition. A method for reducing the vaporization is to add alloying elements that lead to the formation of a thermally grown oxide layer over the protective chromia. Several commercial steels form <b>manganese</b> <b>chromate</b> on the surface. This same approach, combined with observations of TiO{sub 2 } overlayer formation on the chromia forming, Ni-based superalloy IN 738, has resulted {{in the development of a}} series of Fe- 22 Cr-X Ti alloys (X= 0 - 4 wt%). Oxidation testing has indicated that this approach results in significant reduction in chromia evaporation. Unfortunately, the Ti also results in accelerated chromia scale growth. Fundamental thermo-mechanical aspects of the durability of solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) interconnect alloys have also been investigated. A key failure mechanism for interconnects is the spallation of the chromia scale that forms on the alloy, as it is exposed to fuel cell environments. Indentation testing methods to measure the critical energy release rate (Gc) associated with the spallation of chromia scale/alloy systems have been evaluated. This approach has been used to evaluate the thermomechanical stability of chromia films as a function of oxidation exposure. The oxidation of pure nickel in SOFC environments was evaluated using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) to determine the NiO scaling kinetics and a four-point probe was used to measure the area-specific resistance (ASR) to estimate the electrical degradation of the interconnect. In addition to the baseline study of pure nickel, steps were taken to decrease the ASR through alloying and surface modifications. Finally, high conductivity composite systems, consisting of nickel and silver, were studied. These systems utilize high conductivity silver pathways through nickel while maintaining the mechanical stability that a nickel matrix provides...|$|E

The chromium resistance was usually conferred by chrBACF operon from the transposable element or chromosome in many studies. The chromium efflux pump chrA conferred as high as 50  mM of resistance level against chromium. The chrBACF operon was strongly induced by chromate or dichromate, and this operon also resist to superoxide due to the superoxide dismutase activity of chrC (Branco et al. 2008; Morais et al. 2011). The chromium efflux related pumps were encoded by emrAB in Staphylococcus aureus LZ- 01, and this pump also extrudes <b>manganese.</b> The <b>chromate</b> reduction process was not observed in this study. Compared with the 50  mM resistant level of chrBACF operon, the emrAB of S. aureus LZ- 01 only has weak chromate resistant capacity of 6 - 10  mM.|$|R
