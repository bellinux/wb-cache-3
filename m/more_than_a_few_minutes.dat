5|$|Certain {{effects of}} light only {{last for a}} few minutes, thus the canvases documenting such ephemera {{received}} attention for no <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> a day. Further complicating matters, the light of subsequent sunrises, for example, could alter substantially and would require separate canvases within the series. Subsequently, different hues are evident in each painting, and in each work, color is used to describe not only direct but reflected light. At differing times of day and in various seasons stacks absorb the light from diverse parts of the color spectrum. As a result, the residual light that is reflected off of the stacks is seen as ever-changing, and manifests in distinctive coloring.|$|E
5|$|Myocardial {{infarction}} (MI), {{commonly known}} as a heart attack, occurs when blood flow decreases or stops to {{a part of the}} heart, causing damage to the heart muscle. The most common symptom is chest pain or discomfort which may travel into the shoulder, arm, back, neck, or jaw. Often it occurs in the center or left side of the chest and lasts for <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes.</b> The discomfort may occasionally feel like heartburn. Other symptoms may include shortness of breath, nausea, feeling faint, a cold sweat, or feeling tired. About 30% of people have atypical symptoms. Women more often have atypical symptoms than men. Among those over 75 years old, about 5% have had an MI with little or no history of symptoms. An MI may cause heart failure, an irregular heartbeat, cardiogenic shock, or cardiac arrest.|$|E
5|$|After Louise's death, {{and after}} bearing {{criticism}} of his war record from other Confederates for decades, Longstreet refuted most of their arguments in his memoirs entitled From Manassas to Appomattox, a labor of five years that was published in 1896. His final years were marked by poor health and partial deafness. In 1902 he suffered from severe rheumatism {{and was unable to}} stand for <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> at a time. His weight diminished from 200 to 135 pounds by January 1903. Cancer developed in his right eye, and in December he had X-ray therapy in Chicago to treat it. He contracted pneumonia and died in Gainesville on January 2, 1904, six days before his 83rd birthday. Longstreet's remains are buried in Alta Vista Cemetery. He outlived most of his detractors, and was one of only a few general officers from the Civil War to live into the 20th century.|$|E

25|$|Production of such {{materials}} at industrial scale {{had to be}} solved for nuclear power generation and weapons production to be accomplished. Up to 1940, {{the total amount of}} uranium metal produced in the USA was not <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> grams, and even this was of doubtful purity; of metallic beryllium not <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> kilograms; and concentrated deuterium oxide (heavy water) not <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> kilograms. Finally, carbon had never been produced in quantity with anything like the purity required of a moderator.|$|R

The number of surnames {{a person has}} is theoretically unlimited though it is rare to use <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> (and indeed <b>an</b> individual may not know <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> {{of his or her}} ancestors' names).|$|R
5|$|Twenty-five {{cents for}} no <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> of {{entertainment}} was hardly cheap diversion. For the same amount, one could purchase {{a ticket to}} a major vaudeville theater; when America's first amusement park opened in Coney Island the following year, a 25-cent entrance fee covered admission to three rides, a performing sea lion show, and a dance hall. The Kinetoscope was an immediate success, however, and by June 1, the Hollands were also operating venues in Chicago and San Francisco. Entrepreneurs (including Raff and Gammon, with their own International Novelty Co.) were soon running Kinetoscope parlors and temporary exhibition venues around the United States. New firms joined the Kinetoscope Company in commissioning and marketing the machines. The Kinetoscope exhibition spaces were largely, though not uniformly, profitable. After fifty weeks in operation, the Hollands' New York parlor had generated approximately $1,400 in monthly receipts against an estimated $515 in monthly operating costs; receipts from the Chicago venue (located in a Masonic temple) were substantially lower, about $700 a month, though presumably operating costs were lower as well. For each machine, Edison's business at first generally charged $250 to the Kinetoscope Company and other distributors, which would use them in their own exhibition parlors or resell them to independent exhibitors; individual films were initially priced by Edison at $10. During the Kinetoscope's first eleven months of commercialization, the sale of viewing machines, films, and auxiliary items generated a profit of more than $85,000 for Edison's company.|$|E

25|$|It is {{very hard}} to come up with another process that would produce {{deuterium}} other than by nuclear fusion. Such a process would require that the temperature be hot enough to produce deuterium, but not hot enough to produce helium-4, and that this process should immediately cool to non-nuclear temperatures after no <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes.</b> It would also be necessary for the deuterium to be swept away before it reoccurs.|$|E
25|$|Oxygen (O2) must {{be present}} in every {{breathing}} gas. This is because {{it is essential to}} the human body's metabolic process, which sustains life. The human body cannot store oxygen for later use as it does with food. If the body is deprived of oxygen for <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes,</b> unconsciousness and death result. The tissues and organs within the body (notably the heart and brain) are damaged if deprived of oxygen for much longer than four minutes.|$|E

25|$|Even {{though a}} rocket's non-propellant, dry mass is often only between 5-20% of total mass, {{nevertheless}} this cost dominates. For hardware {{with the performance}} used in orbital launch vehicles, expenses of $2000â€“$10,000+ per kilogram of dry weight are common, primarily from engineering, fabrication, and testing; raw materials amount to typically around 2% of total expense. For most rockets except reusable ones (shuttle engines) the engines need not function <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes,</b> which simplifies design.|$|E
25|$|Transient global amnesia is a well-described {{medical and}} {{clinical}} phenomenon. This form of amnesia is distinct in that abnormalities in the hippocampus {{can sometimes be}} visualized using a special form of magnetic resonance imaging of the brain known as diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI). Symptoms typically last {{for less than a}} day and there is often no clear precipitating factor or any other neurological deficits. The cause of this syndrome is not clear. The hypothesis of the syndrome includes transient reduced blood flow, possible seizure or an atypical type of migraine. Patients are typically amnestic of events <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> in the past, though immediate recall is usually preserved.|$|E
25|$|Territorial {{males of}} this species perch upon {{prominent}} vegetation at high elevation (1500m or higher) and chase intruders away. There is never more than one individual in each territory for <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes.</b> Every so often, the landowning male wasp will make short regular flights out from its perch. Intruding visitors are common among this species, as males jockey for the best territory. On occasion, the intruder engages in aerial combat with the territory owner over possession of the perch, a tree or bush. The two males will clash wings and spiral vertically upwards engaging in an aerial contest for the territory.|$|E

25|$|The {{aircraft}} was assembled {{in a few}} weeks, but Caproni still had to find an engine and a pilot. He tried to solve the first problem by buying an engine built by the recently founded Miller company of Turin; the engine wasn't expensive and the Trentine engineer was glad to use an Italian-built piece of technology, because of his irredentist sentiments; however, the four-cylinder W engine proved quite unreliable and was apparently unable to run smoothly for <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> at a time. As far as the second problem was concerned, Caproni decided to have Ugo Tabacchi, a Veronese-born Trentine chaffeur who had recently joined Caproni's team, pilot the maiden flight of his aircraft. Although some licensed pilots (mostly trained on Wright aircraft) were already available in Italy, Caproni couldn't afford to hire any of them.|$|E
25|$|Curtis {{had been}} using motion picture cameras in {{fieldwork}} for The North American Indian since 1906. He worked extensively with the ethnographer and British Columbia native George Hunt in 1910, which inspired his work with the Kwakiutl, but much of their collaboration remains unpublished. At the end of 1912, Curtis decided to create a feature film depicting Native American life, partly {{as a way of}} improving his financial situation and partly because film technology had improved {{to the point where it}} was conceivable to create and screen films <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> long. Curtis chose the Kwakiutl tribe, of the Queen Charlotte Strait region of the Central Coast of British Columbia, Canada, for his subject. His film, In the Land of the Head Hunters, was the first feature-length film whose cast was composed entirely of Native North Americans.|$|E
25|$|The {{most famous}} case {{reported}} {{is that of}} patient Henry Molaison, known as H.M., in March 1953. Molaison's chief complaint was the persistence of severe seizures and therefore had a bilateral lobectomy (both of his MTLs were removed). As a result, Molaison had bilateral damage to both the hippocampal formation and the perirhinal cortex. Molaison had average intelligence and perceptual ability and a decent vocabulary. However, he could not learn new words or remember things that had happened <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> earlier. He could remember anything from his childhood. If the memory was created from before his lobectomy, {{he still had the}} ability to retrieve it and remember. However, he was able to learn some new skills. He was the first well-documented case of severe anterograde amnesia, and was studied until his death in 2008.|$|E

25|$|Davros is {{from the}} planet Skaro, whose people, the Kaleds, {{were engaged in a}} bitter thousand-year war of {{attrition}} with their enemies, the Thals. He is horribly scarred and disabled, a condition that various spin-off media attribute to his laboratory being attacked by a Thal shell. He has one functioning hand and one cybernetic eye mounted on his forehead {{to take the place of}} his real eyes, which he is not able to open for long; for much of his existence he depends completely upon a self-designed mobile life-support chair in place of his lower body. It would become an obvious inspiration for his eventual design of the Dalek. The lower half of his body is absent and he is physically incapable of leaving the chair for <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> without dying. Davros' voice, like those of the Daleks, is electronically distorted. His manner of speech is generally soft and contemplative, but when angered or excited he is prone to ranting outbursts that resemble the hysterical, staccatissimo speech of the Daleks.|$|E
500|$|As the RFD {{completely}} {{wraps around}} and chokes off the tornado's air supply, the vortex begins to weaken, and become thin and rope-like. This is the [...] "dissipating stage", often lasting no <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes,</b> {{after which the}} tornado ends. During this stage {{the shape of the}} tornado becomes highly influenced by the winds of the parent storm, and can be blown into fantastic patterns. Even though the tornado is dissipating, it is still capable of causing damage. The storm is contracting into a rope-like tube and, due to conservation of angular momentum, winds can increase at this point.|$|E

Lennon's body was then taken to the city morgue at 520 First Avenue and autopsied. The cause of death was reported on his death certificate as [...] "hypovolemic shock, caused by the loss of more than 80% of blood volume due to multiple through-and-through gunshot wounds to the left shoulder and left chest resulting in damage to the left lung and left subclavian artery and aortic arch". The pathologist who performed the autopsy on Lennon also stated in his report that even with prompt medical treatment, no person could have lived for <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> with such multiple bullet injuries to all of the major arteries and veins around the heart.|$|E
