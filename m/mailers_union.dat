Among its key cases was In re Union Starch & Refining Co., 87 NLRB 779, (1949). [...] The Board held in Union Starch that unions were permitted to charge nonmembers agency fees that were nearly equal to full union dues so long as these agency fees were uniform in nature and no additional requirements were made in violation of NLRA Section 8(a)(3)(B) or §8(b)(2). A second important case, Teamsters Local No. 959, 167 NLRB 1042 (1967), the Board concluded that special assessments or fees could {{not be part of}} the agency fee. Reacting to the Supreme Court's ruling in Retail Clerks v. Schermerhorn, the Board held in Detroit <b>Mailers</b> <b>Union</b> No. 40, 192 NLRB 951 (1971) that certain fraternal activities may be included in the agency fee so long as they are not special assessments. The Board also ruled repeatedly {{on a number of issues}} associated with agency fees. It held in several cases that the NLRA does not permit the collection of assessments through the agency fee. The RLA, in contrast, does. The Board also held that when determining what an assessment is, facts (not labels) matter most.|$|E
25|$|Nearly 100 Mailer Locals {{would be}} {{chartered}} under the ITU. To mark {{the difference between}} the Printers and <b>Mailers</b> <b>Unions,</b> the ITU used the M before the local number. In New York City, Typographical #6 and Mailers, M-6. The position of the mailers was that of second class citizens in the ITU, with no voice on the executive council. Mailers Cary Weaver and Munro Roberts felt the needs of mailers fell on deaf printer ears on the ITU executive council.|$|R
25|$|The <b>Mailers</b> Trade District <b>Union</b> (MTDU) was an {{internal}} {{part of the}} ITU. Lawsuits from 1926-1944 were fought for mailer rights. The MTDU was eventually abolished by court injunction and referendum vote. In 1929, ITU president Charles P. Howard selected third vice-president C. N. Smith (a printer) to represent the MTDU. The mailers were allowed to vote in 1930 for their MTDU representative; John Mc Ardle and Harold Mitchell served in 1934. Munro Roberts was elected as MTDU member of the executive council, (19351937) {{but he had no}} voice or vote. After many heated arguments with ITU President Howard and Secretary Randolph, Roberts became committed to a separate <b>mailer</b> <b>union.</b> Moreover, the International Mailers' Union (IMU), was created and many shops would have two boards, ITU and IMU. With the departure of Roberts, Thomas J. Martin represented the MTDU (19381944). The MTDU continued by court order; however, the mailers were again without an observer to the executive council. The 1947 Cleveland convention {{paved the way for the}} demise of the MTDU and the election of a mailer to the executive council. Joe Bailey (San Francisco-Oakland Mailers #M-18), was elected third vice-president before the 1948 Milwaukee convention. ITU President Woodruff Randolph saw a way to appease mailers returning after service in World War II. The agreement made between ITU President Randolph and Joe Bailey: only a Printer would ever be President, first and second Vice-President or Secretary-Treasurer of the ITU. The position of third Vice-President would be held only by a Mailer. The IMU lost much power to draw new membership. The IMU finally was finally fully merged into the ITU only in 1982, only five years before the union's demise. Joe Bailey served on the ITU executive council until 1973. A mailer would remain ITU third vice-president: Robert F. Ameln, (19741975) and the Canadian mailer, Allen J. Heritage, (19761986).|$|R

5000|$|Of a Fire on the Moon, {{published}} in three installments by Life magazine, later becoming a full book, chronicles the U.S. moon launch of 1969 {{through the eyes}} of Norman Mailer’s third-person view of himself. Through this third-person view, Mailer describes the space launches {{from his point of view}} as seasoned reporter who has seen America ‘come of age’ since the end of the Second World War. Additionally, Mailer strings in short [...] "time machines" [...] (as made popular in his literary debut, The Naked and the Dead) which provide insight from fictional American families as they view the news coverage and actual moon launch. By providing the reader with multiple illustrations of the moon launch, the reader is able to see what the monumental moment means to different Americans. For some of the depicted characters, it is as simple as the epitome of American ingenuity and superiority in the context of the Cold War with the Soviet <b>Union.</b> <b>Mailer’s</b> third-person depiction illustrates an amalgamation of emotions that combines the awe of the scientific feat with the fear of the ever-increasing power of the human race. To Mailer, the moon launch is much more than an accomplishment of the United States, nor is it a move to conquer the Space Race with the Soviet Union. He sees it as a triumph for all humankind, a bold statement in the face of the [...] "creator". By landing men on a celestial object such as the moon, humans are seen as rejecting the omniscient power of a higher entity, almost saying, “Look how far we have come.” ...|$|R
