5|$|Schiavo {{describes}} how the FAA uses a formula ascribing specific <b>monetary</b> <b>value</b> to human lives, and how the agency allows numbers {{to decide whether the}} cost of extra safety is worth the additional expense. For example, if equipping an airline fleet with smoke detectors would cost $100 million, but would only save 10 lives each worth $1 million, then the expense is ruled out. Schiavo is similarly critical of the internal FAA politics and the FAA's administrators.|$|E

All the nominations have to be delivered to the Astronomical Society of the Pacific by December 15 of the nominating year and remain valid for three years. The winners are selected by the Awards Committee appointed by the Board of Directors. The committee have the right not to award any of the nominees if they do not consider their achievements exceptional enough, which has already happened several times.|$|E

Even after the old currencies ceased to be legal tender, they continued {{to be accepted by}} national central banks for periods ranging from several years to indefinitely (the latter for Austria, Germany, Ireland, Estonia and Latvia in banknotes and coins, and for Belgium, Luxembourg, Slovenia and Slovakia in banknotes only).

40|$|Agricultural {{researchers}} {{recognize the}} importance of the sustainability of agricultural systems and the need to develop appropriate ways to measure sustainability. The search for agroecosystem performance indicators (APIs) is an urgent task to develop understanding and to facilitate decision-making processes. The paper provides an input/output methodology for a farming system analysis in terms of both energy and <b>monetary</b> <b>values,</b> measurements that are sufficiently homogenizing and comprehensive to document patterns of agroecosystem transfers of bio-physical entities and socio-cultural values. This methodology was applied to two adjacent farms located in Central Italy, which differed in the farming system adopted (mixed farming and arable farming) and in the level of external input applied. A broad range of APIs (structural and functional, direct and crossed) was developed to analyze both the fundamental energy transfers (and associated allocation of <b>monetary</b> <b>values)</b> between the crucial agroecosystem components and the overall efficiency of the farming system in transforming different external input into output. This analysis shows that energy and <b>monetary</b> <b>values</b> do not offer a single, coherent account of the functioning of farm systems. The study stresses the need for the development of an environmental accounting method, which integrates ecological and economic aspects. For the present, it is recognized that structural and functional APIs calculated according to energy, rather than <b>monetary,</b> <b>values</b> are more meaningful in both the designing of sustainable farming systems and in decision-making processes. © 2000 Elsevier Science B.
