To {{determine the extent to which}} Ae. albopictus mosquitoes from the United States are capable of transmitting Zika virus and the influence of virus dose, virus strain, and mosquito species on vector competence, we evaluated multiple doses of representative Zika virus strains in Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus mosquitoes. Virus preparation (fresh vs. frozen) significantly affected virus infectivity in mosquitoes. We calculated 50 % infectious doses to be 6. 1 - 7. 5 log 10 PFU/mL; <b>minimum</b> <b>infective</b> <b>dose</b> was 4. 2 log 10 PFU/mL. Ae. albopictus mosquitoes were more susceptible to infection than Ae. aegypti mosquitoes, but transmission efficiency was higher for Ae. aegypti mosquitoes, indicating a transmission barrier in Ae. albopictus mosquitoes. Results suggest that, although Zika virus transmission is relatively inefficient overall and dependent on virus strain and mosquito species, Ae. albopictus mosquitoes could become major vectors in the Americas. 28430564 PMC 551247...|$|E
40|$|Earlier {{studies showed}} that the <b>minimum</b> <b>infective</b> <b>dose</b> (greater than 10 (6) organisms) of a virulent strain of Fusobacterium necrophorum could be greatly reduced by {{suspending}} the fusobacteria in sub-lethal doses of cultures of other bacteria such as Escherichia coli before inoculating mice subcutaneously.

Sterile faecal filtrate had no such effect. The sites of low grade infection produced by the prior subcutaneous injection of E. coli culture or gaur faecal suspension were susceptible to superinfection by doses of F. necrophorum far below those required to infect normal tissue. This work helps to explain the production of necrobacillosis by the faecal contamination of small wounds. It proved impossible, however, to produce necrobacillosis in mice by the subcutaneous injection of faecal suspensions from 33 farm cattle. This suggests that the proportion of cattle with virulent F. necrophorum in their faeces is low...|$|E
40|$|The {{isolation}} of Fusobacterium necrophorum present in small numbers in heavily contaminated material such as faeces or soil is {{hampered by the}} lack of an efficient selective medium and by the high <b>minimum</b> <b>infective</b> <b>dose</b> of the organism.

When necrobacillosis developed F. necrophorum was identified microscopically in tissue from the advancing edge of the lesion and isolated on a partly selective medium. The enhancement of fusobacterial infectivity produced by A. pyogenes and by S. aureus was high, but the latter was slightly the more efficient, enabling as few as 80 F. necrophorum organisms/g of faeces to be detected.

40|$|Pea aphids, Acyrthosiphon pisum, {{have the}} {{potential}} to increase reproduction as a defence against pathogens, though how frequently this occurs or how infection with live pathogens influences this response is not well understood. Here we determine the <b>minimum</b> <b>infective</b> <b>dose</b> of an environmentally common bacterium and possible aphid pathogen, Pseudomonas syringae, to determine the likelihood of pathogenic effects to pea aphids. Additionally, we used P. syringae infection to investigate how live pathogens may alter reproductive rates. We found that oral bacterial exposure decreased subsequent survival of aphids in a dose-dependent manner and we estimate that ingestion of less than 10 bacterial cells is sufficient to increase aphid mortality. Pathogen dose was positively related to aphid reproduction. Aphids exposed to low bacterial doses showed decreased, although statistically indistinguishable, fecundity compared to controls. Aphids exposed to high doses reproduced significantly more than low dose treatments and also more, but not significantly so, than controls. These results are consistent with previous studies suggesting that pea aphids may use fecundity compensation as a response to pathogens. Consequently, even low levels of exposure to a common plant-associated bacterium may therefore have significant effects on pea aphid survival and reproduction...|$|E

40|$|Infant {{botulism}} is {{a disease}} that occurs in infants between 1 and 52 weeks years of age when spores of Clostridium botulinum are ingested. These spores germinate and produce neurotoxins in the large intestine lumen. These toxins act at the neuromuscular junction blocking release of acetylcholine neurotransmitter. Clinical severity varies from a mild hipotony to systemic flaccid paralysis. It has even been considered {{as the cause of}} infant sudden death. C. botulinum spores are commonly found in soil samples and aquatic sediments throughout the world. Honey is the most well-documented food source of C. botulinum spores for infants although corn syrup, infant formulas, dry cereals, plants infusions and dust have been also associated with infant botulism. However, for the majority of cases the source of the causative spores remains unclear. Researchers have also stressed the importance of the child’s natural environment that may facilitate the exposure to C. botulinum spores. Contact with dust or soil in houses from rural areas, where farming activities are carried out, has also been cited as a risk factor. As well as urban areas with big areas under construction involving earthmoving or restoration works in buildings. It is considered that the <b>minimum</b> <b>infective</b> <b>dose</b> of spores of C. botulinum may be as low as 10 - 100 spores.

The colonization potential of two chicken and one human C. jejuni isolates, which were minimally passaged, have been investigated using a quantitative model of chicken colonization. There was no detectable difference between these strains but all were more efficient colonizers than a laboratory-adapted strain 81116. In addition, the colonization potential of C. jejuni strain 81116 following a passage in vivo was also determined. The results indicated this increased c. 10000 fold following a single passage in vivo, such that a dose of only 40 cfu caused maximal colonization.

Specific immune responses (gamma interferon [IFN-γ] and interleukin- 4 [IL- 4] responses) to mycobacterial antigens were monitored throughout the study, and the responses to the tuberculin skin test were assessed at two times. Rigorous post mortem examinations were performed to determine the presence of pathology, and samples were taken for microbiological and histopathological confirmation of M. bovis infection. One-half of the animals infected with 1 CFU of M. bovis developed pulmonary pathology typical of bovine tuberculosis. No differences in the severity of pathology were observed for the different M. bovis doses. All animals that developed pathology were skin test positive and produced specific IFN-γ and IL- 4 responses. No differences in the sizes of the skin test reactions, the times taken to achieve a positive IFN-γ result, or the levels of the IFN-γ and IL- 4 responses were observed for the different M. bovis doses, suggesting that diagnostic assays (tuberculin skin test and IFN-γ test) can detect cattle soon after M. bovis infection regardless of the dose.

The alternate hosts of the causative agent, Tetracapsuloides bryosalmonae (Myxozoa: Malacosporea), {{have been identified}} as freshwater bryozoans (Bryozoa: Phylactolaemata) within which spores capable of infecting salmonid fish develop. Currently, control of PKD relies upon complex management practices, with no licensed prophylaxis or treatment available. Assessment of the nutritional preferences of phylactolaemate bryozoans allowed development of an optimised laboratory culture system. Following laboratory maintenance, bryozoans collected from PKD-endemic sites were found to be infected with the malacosporean parasites T. bryosalmonae and Buddenbrockia plumatellae. Subsequent parasitic development was observed using light-, electron- and confocal-microscopy techniques. Methods of challenging rainbow trout with T. bryosalmonae spores were developed, with the <b>minimum</b> <b>infective</b> <b>dose</b> established. The presence of Thomsen-Friedenreich and Tn epitopes within the parasite was investigated, and experimental vaccine preparations based on either these specificities or T. bryosalmonae-infected bryozoans were efficacy tested in rainbow trout. In addition, salinomycin and amprolium were tested as prospective chemotherapeutants for PKD. Further insights into the development and subsequent release of malacosporean spores within their invertebrate hosts have been revealed.

Air was sampled at the outlet of electrical hand dryers and surface swabs of hand dryers were taken in toilets of five shopping centres. Air sampling was conducted using the MAS- 100 impactor. The number of mesophilic bacteria, fungi, actinomycetes, staphylococci and Escherichia coli was determined.

40|$|The {{number of}} {{pathogens}} {{that are required}} to infect a host, termed <b>infective</b> <b>dose,</b> varies dramatically across pathogen species. It has recently been predicted that <b>infective</b> <b>dose</b> will depend upon the mode of action of the molecules that pathogens use to facilitate their infection. Specifically, pathogens which use locally acting molecules will require a lower <b>infective</b> <b>dose</b> than pathogens that use distantly acting molecules. Furthermore, {{it has also been}} predicted that pathogens with distantly acting immune modulators may be more virulent because they have a large number of cells in the inoculums, which will cause more harm to host cells. We formally test these predictions for the first time using data on 43 different human pathogens from a range of taxonomic groups with diverse life-histories. We found that pathogens using local action do have lower <b>infective</b> <b>doses,</b> but are not less virulent than those using distant action.

In this study, we examined the role of CmeABC in bile resistance and its contribution to the adaptation of Campylobacter jejuni in the intestinal tract of the chicken, a natural host and a major reservoir for Campylobacter. Inactivation of cmeABC drastically decreased the resistance of Campylobacter to various bile salts. Addition of choleate (2 mM) in culture medium impaired the in vitro growth of the cmeABC mutants but had no effect on the growth of the wild-type strain. Bile concentration varied in the duodenum, jejunum, and cecum of chicken intestine, and the inhibitory effect of the intestinal extracts on the in vitro growth of Campylobacter was well correlated with the total bile concentration in the individual sections of chicken intestine. When inoculated into chickens, the wild-type strain colonized the birds as early as day 2 postinoculation with a density as high as 107 CFU/g of feces. In contrast, the cmeABC mutants failed to colonize any of the inoculated chickens throughout the study. The <b>minimum</b> <b>infective</b> <b>dose</b> for the cmeABC mutant was at least 2. 6 × 104 -fold higher than that of the wild-type strain. Complementation of the cmeABC mutants with a wild-type cmeABC allele in trans fully restored the in vitro growth in bile-containing media and the in vivo colonization to the levels of the wild-type strain. Immunoblotting analysis indicated that CmeABC is expressed and immunogenic in chickens experimentally infected with C. jejuni. Together, these findings provide compelling evidence that CmeABC, by mediating resistance to bile salts in the intestinal tract, is required for successful colonization of C. jejuni in chickens.

Anti-rPA, anti-FIS and lethal toxin neutralizing titres were superior after booster vaccinations, compared to single vaccinations. Qualitative analysis of humoral responses to rPA, rBclA and FIS antigens revealed a preponderance of anti-FIS IgG titres following either single or double vaccinations with the SLSV.

Rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and salmon mucus were not found to inhibit the growth of A. salmonicida supporting recent evidence that fish skin is a site of carriage. In vitro studies suggested that trout serum proteins do not confer protection from fish antibody on A. salmonicida in covert infections. Preliminary work was undertaken to develop a specific DNA probe for A. salmonicida which will allow its detection in environmental samples and carrier fish.

40|$|Abstract Background Shigellosis is a {{major public}} health concern worldwide, {{especially}} in developing countries. It is an acute intestinal infection caused by bacteria of the genus Shigella, with a <b>minimum</b> <b>infective</b> <b>dose</b> as low as 10 – 100 bacterial cells. Increasing prevalence of Shigella sonnei as the etiologic agent of shigellosis in Malaysia has been reported. As there is limited information on the genetic background of S. sonnei in Malaysia, this study aimed to characterize Malaysian S. sonnei and to evaluate the prospect of using multilocus variable-number tandem-repeat (VNTR) analysis (MLVA) for subtyping of local S. sonnei. Methods Forty non-repeat clinical strains of S. sonnei isolated during the years 1997 – 2000, and 2007 – 2009 were studied. The strains were isolated from stools of patients in different hospitals from different regions in Malaysia. These epidemiologically unrelated strains were characterized using biotyping, antimicrobial susceptibility testing, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and MLVA. Results The two biotypes identified {{in this study were}} biotype a (n[*]=[*] 29, 73 %) and biotype g (n[*]=[*] 11, 27 %). All the 40 strains were sensitive to kanamycin, ceftriaxone and ciprofloxacin. Highest resistance rate was observed for streptomycin (67. 5 %), followed by tetracycline (40 %) and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (37. 5 %). All the S. sonnei biotype g strains had a core resistance type of streptomycin - trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole - tetracycline whereas the 29 biotype a strains were subtyped into eight resistotypes. All the strains were equally distinguishable by PFGE and MLVA. Overall, PFGE analysis indicated that S. sonnei biotype a strains were genetically more diverse than biotype g strains. Cluster analysis by MLVA was better in grouping the strains according to biotypes, was reflective of the epidemiological information and was equally discriminative as PFGE. Conclusions The S. sonnei strains circulating in Malaysia throughout the period studied were derived from different clones given their heterogeneous nature. MLVA based on seven selected VNTR loci was rapid, reproducible and highly discriminative and therefore may complement PFGE for routine subtyping of S. sonnei. </p...|$|E

40|$|There {{are four}} major types of human {{pathogenic}} organisms found in biosolids: (1) bacteria, (2) viruses, (3) protozoa, and (4) helminths (parasitic worms). The concentration of organisms in biosolids {{depends on the}} type and concentration of pathogens present in the source sewage {{and the degree to}} which those organisms are removed or killed by the pre -treatment process. The hazard that is associated with Class B biosolids is a function of the number and type of pathogens in the treated sludge relative to the <b>minimum</b> <b>infective</b> <b>dose</b> and the exposure level. Under the EPA biosolids rule (40 CFR 503), Class B biosolids must contain less than two million colony forming units (CFU) of fecal coliform per gram of total solids (dry weight). To protect public health, the EPA rule prescribes a restricted period of up to one year to limit public access to lands where Class B biosolids have been applied. These EPA restrictions do not apply to occupational access. The risk of worker exposure to infectious agents is likely greatest during and immediately after land application of the biosolids. Because the concentration of pathogens decays through natural processes, the potential for pathogen exposure decreases over time. During investigations at a Class B biosolids land application and at a Class B biosolids storage site: NIOSH interviewed five employees at a Class B biosolids land application operation. All five employees reported at least one episode of gastrointestinal illness after working with the biosolids, either at the treatment plant or during land application. The environmental sampling results indicated that the gastrointestinal illnesses were possibly of occupational origin. NIOSH collected bulk samples from different locations within the biosolids storage site. The mean fecal coliform concentration of the bulk samples was 220, 000 CFU per gram of sample (wet weight). Fecal coliforms are used as an indicator for the presence of other enteric microorganisms. There remains a significant exposure risk. This example illustrates the importance of minimizing exposure to Class B biosolids during the restricted period. NIOSH collected air samples at the Class B biosolids land application and storage site. Enteric bacteria were detected in the air. The presence of enteric bacteria in air samples is sufficient justification to implement engineering controls and work practices that minimize employee exposure to biosolid aerosols. The detection of enteric bacteria in a limited number of air and bulk samples confirms the potential for workers to be exposed to organisms which have been associated with gastrointestinal symptoms and illness. Operations where employees are potentially exposed to Class B biosolids include transport, loading, unloading, and application activities. Other potentially exposed workers include compost workers, surface miners working around reclamation sites, and farmers. " - NIOSHTIC- 2 "August 2000. "Superseded by 2002 - 149...|$|E
40|$|Anthrax is a {{zoonotic}} disease affecting most warm-blooded mammals. Primarily {{recognized as a}} disease of herbivores, it {{is caused by a}} spore-forming, rod-shaped bacterium, Bacillus anthracis. The disease has a worldwide distribution though only of a sporadic nature in developed countries due to effective vaccination and control measures. The current anthrax live spore veterinary vaccine was developed by Max Sterne and its introduction in the 1940 s made the control of the disease possible. The principal virulence factors of the B. anthracis are located on two plasmids, pXO 1 and pXO 2. The pXO 1 encodes the toxic factors; protective antigen (PA), lethal and oedema factors (LF and EF) respectively while pXO 2 contains the encapsulation genes. Attenuated strains lack either of the two virulence plasmids and consequently have reduced virulence. The Sterne 34 F 2 strain (tox+, cap-) therefore produces the PA, LF and EF components of the anthrax toxin but lacks the plasmid pXO 2 encoding capsule formation and is therefore relatively safe, albeit with some residual virulence. During the development of the avirulent Sterne vaccine, few studies were conducted on the immunogenicity of the vaccine in the target animals. In vivo immunity tests (pathogenicity test) using guinea pigs were mainly used due to few and less sensitive serological diagnostic tools being available at that time. The need for serology in relation to anthrax only became apparent during the development of a human vaccine much after the introduction of the veterinary vaccine. Consequently, though anthrax is recognized as a primary disease of herbivores, there are no records of an in depth study on the immunogenicity and protectivity of the widely accepted strain 34 F 2 Sterne spore vaccine in any ruminant species. This study was undertaken to fill the present knowledge gap relating to the immunogenicity and duration of protectivity induced by vaccination with the Sterne live spore vaccine in a goat model, which are highly susceptible to the disease. Twenty-one age-matched Boer goats were procured and split into 3 groups of five animals each and vaccinated using different immunization regimens. Six goats served as negative controls utilized in determining the <b>minimum</b> <b>infective</b> <b>dose</b> (MID). Serum samples were collected at intervals for analysis in the laboratory. Bacillus anthracis virulent spore challenge was done not earlier than 3 weeks after the last vaccination and survival was monitored for 14 days. Our findings revealed the MID of virulent B. anthracis spores in naïve goats under experimental conditions to be below 36 spores using the subcutaneous route. Production of anti-anthrax immunoglobulins in the first month following Sterne vaccination was 400 -fold higher than pre-vaccination levels with subsequent decline over time to a 50 - fold difference, 14 months post vaccination. A similar trend was reflected in the toxin neutralizing antibody titres. There was a correlation between the toxin neutralizing antibody titres and protection against challenge with virulent anthrax spores (P = 0. 01). Goats challenged 6 and 62 weeks after vaccination showed a survival rate of 60 % and 80 % respectively. Those revaccinated one year after the first vaccination were fully protected from virulent anthrax spore challenge. Early pre-validation data of a quantitative indirect ELISA for the detection of anti-PA antibodies was promising and should be further investigated as a tool for anthrax vaccine studies in goats.

40|$|OBJECTIVE To {{determine}} whether hydrogen peroxide vapor (HPV) {{could be used}} to decontaminate caliciviruses from surfaces in a patient room. DESIGN Feline calicivirus (FCV) and murine norovirus (MNV) were used as surrogate viability markers to mimic the noncultivable human norovirus. Cell culture supernatants of FCV and MNV were dried in triplicate 35 -mm wells of 6 -well plastic plates. These plates were placed in various positions in a nonoccupied patient room that was subsequently exposed to HPV. Control plates were positioned in a similar room but were never exposed to HPV. METHODS Virucidal activity was measured in cell culture by reduction in 50 % tissue culture <b>infective</b> <b>dose</b> titer for FCV and by both 50 % tissue culture <b>infective</b> <b>dose</b> titer and plaque reduction for MNV. RESULTS Neither viable FCV nor viable MNV could be detected in the test room after HPV treatment. At least 3. 65 log reduction for FCV and at least 3. 67 log reduction for MNV were found by 50 % tissue culture <b>infective</b> <b>dose.</b> With plaque assay, measurable reduction for MNV was at least 2. 85 log units. CONCLUSIONS The successful inactivation of both surrogate viruses indicates that HPV could be a useful tool for surface decontamination of a patient room contaminated by norovirus.
