50|$|Joseph Cutter and Lilli Nielsen, {{pioneers in}} {{research}} {{on the development of}} blind and multiple-handicapped children, have begun to introduce new research on mobility in blind infants in children. Cutter's book, Independent Movement and Travel in Blind Children, recommends a cane to be introduced as early as possible, so that the blind child learns to use it and move around naturally and organically, the same way a sighted child learns to walk. A longer cane, between nose and chin height, is recommended to compensate for a child's more immature grasp and tendency to hold the handle of the cane by the side instead of out in front. <b>Mature</b> <b>cane</b> technique should not be expected from a child, and style and technique can be refined as the child gets older.|$|E

Results show that the rate of Roundup and the time of year at which application is made are the most important factors affecting the efficacy of Roundup. The addition of Frigate,and reduced spray volumes improve the efficacy of Roundup under certain circumstances and split applications are an effective means of ensuring complete cover of all the foliage.

40|$|Dispersal of spores was {{investigated}} for the Botryosphaeria {{species that are}} responsible for dieback in grapevines. Trapping for spores was carried out in a Canterbury vineyard during May 2008 –April 2009 to investigate spore availability during the year. No spores characteristic of the Botryosphaeriaceae were collected on Vaseline®-coated slides, which were considered suitable for wind dispersed spores, although spores of other fungi were collected. However, traps that collected rainwater runoff yielded conidia of the Botryosphaeriaceae. In haemocytometer counts of spores they were initially identified by morphology, and subsequently confirmed by PCR of rDNA followed by DNA sequencing. During the trapping period, 59. 8 % of the total Botryosphaeriaceae caught were Neofusicoccum spp. and 40. 2 % were Diplodia spp. These were present throughout the entire year, with most abundant conidia being detected during December, January and February, when summer temperatures were high and when routine trimming of <b>mature</b> <b>canes</b> provided the wounds needed for infection...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to investigate the potential of TerraSAR-X (X-band) in monitoring sugarcane growth on Reunion Island (located in the Indian Ocean). Multi-temporal TerraSAR data acquired at various incidence angles (17 °, 31 °, 37 °, 47 °, 58 °) and polarizations (HH, HV, VV) were analyzed in order to study the behaviour of SAR (synthetic aperture radar) signal as a function of sugarcane height and NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index). The potential of TerraSAR for mapping the sugarcane harvest was also studied. Radar signal increased quickly with crop height until a threshold height, which depended on polarization and incidence angle. Beyond this threshold, the signal increased only slightly, remained constant, or even decreased. The threshold height is slightly higher with cross polarization and higher incidence angles (47 ° in comparison with 17 ° and 31 °). Results also showed that the co-polarizations channels (HH and VV) were well correlated. High correlation between SAR signal and NDVI calculated from SPOT- 4 / 5 images was observed. TerraSAR data showed that after strong rains the soil contribution to the backscattering of sugarcane fields can be important for canes with heights of terminal visible dewlap (htvd) less than 50 cm (total cane heights around 155 cm). This increase in radar signal after strong rains could involve an ambiguity between young and <b>mature</b> <b>canes.</b> Indeed, the radar signal on TerraSAR images acquired in wet soil conditions could be of the same order for fields recently harvested and mature sugarcane fields, making difficult the detection of cuts. Finally, TerraSAR data at high spatial resolution were shown to be useful for monitoring sugarcane harvest when the fields are of small size or when the cut is spread out in time. The comparison between incidence angles of 17 °, 37 ° and 58 ° shows that 37 ° is more suitable to monitor the sugarcane harvest. The cut is easily detectable on TerraSAR images for data acquired less than two or three months after the cut. The radar signal decreases about 5 dB for images acquired some days after the cut and 3 dB for data acquired two month after the cut (VV- 37 °). The difference in radar signal becomes negligible (< 1 dB) between harvested fields and <b>mature</b> <b>canes</b> for sugarcane harvested since three months or more...|$|R
40|$|The use of {{insecticides}} {{against the}} borer Eldana saccharina Walker {{is one of}} four research programmes against this pest. This programme comprises projects examining field insecticide trials, seedcane protection trials, insecticide persistence studies and the examination of droplet distribution and penetration in the crop. In field trials, eldana damage was too low to show clear treatment effects. However, results from an aerial application trial, did show treatment differences and multiple applications were more effective than a single application. Trials investigating the dipping of seedcane in insecticide solutions, showed that the synthetic pyrethroids were the most effective insecticides tested. Studies investigating the persistence of insecticides in sugarcane show that mortality of neonate larvae exposed to synthetic pyrethroids remained high (70 %) after the treatments were exposed to sunlight for up to eight weeks.

40|$|Symptoms {{of yellow}} leaf {{syndrome}} (YLS) were first observed in South Africa in late 1994. Since mid- 1995, YLS {{has been found}} {{in most parts of the}} South African sugar industry in a wide range of commercial varieties on growers ' farms, new genotypes undergoing selection and a number of foreign varieties in variety collections. At the same time YLS was found to be widespread in the Swaziland sugar industry. The symptoms have been common in a number of varieties in most areas. Symptoms most frequently appeared in maturing cane during the cooler, drier months and in cane suffering stress or other damage. Varieties differed in the intensity of symptoms and the duration of symptom expression. Most South African commercial varieties appear to be relatively resistant or tolerant. Symptoms have not been or have only rarely been observed in varieties N 12, N 16 and N 21. In varieties N 14, N 19 and NC 0376, symptoms became less marked and eventually disappeared with the onset of better growing conditions in the spring and summer of 1995 - 96, even in <b>mature</b> <b>cane.</b> In other varieties conspicuous symptoms persisted until harvest.

40|$|Eldana saccMna Walker extends southwards into Natal in a {{relatively}} narrow coastal belt, which south of Durban becomes only a few kilometres wide. Its distribution is limited by winter temperature {{in the south of}} its range, and by low rainfall in the north. It extends further south in natural hosts than in cane. The true natural hosts of E. sacchorina are the larger Cyperaceae, but nearly all known hosts, crop or natural, appear to be C, plants. In the north of Natal ten true hosts were identified, falling to five in the Richards Bay to Umvoti River mouth region, and to one in the south of the insect's range. The insect lays its eggs in dead leaf material rather than live. In choice trials it preferred Cyperus immensus C. B. CI. : cane; and Cyperur latifolius Poir (usually a non-host) in that order. It laid no eggs in a dicotyledonous plant, A mthus spinosus L. Feeding sites in the Cyperaceae are generally in the rhizome, but the inflorescence of C. immensus is preferred during flowering. Papyrus (Cyperus papyrus L.) is attacked in the inflorescence, but unsubmerged rhizomes are heavily infested when available. The middle and base of <b>mature</b> <b>cane</b> stalks are most often attacked. Penetration of cane is usually via the node; cracks are also used. Analyses for percentage nitrogen suggested that exposed papyrus rhizomes were highly nutritious, as were inflorescences. Cane was not a nutritious host. The presence of gut-symbiotic nitrogen-fixing bacteria could not be demonstrated. The available evidence suggests that cane has been invaded because it provides attractive egg-laying sites. does the insect. In the centre and south of the cane belt, the distribution of the insect is apparently limited by the winter temperature. Mean daily temperature isotherms for July have been used as an index of winter temperature (Figure 1). However from Richards Bay north to the Swaziland border, the climate inland becomes too dry for natural hosts to be common, and even along the rivers natural hosts are scarce, because of the "all or nothing " nature of the water flow. ...|$|E

40|$|Movements of Polynesian rats (Rattus exulans) in a {{sugarcane}} {{field and}} adjacent gulch areas were determined both by livetrapping and radiotelemetry during {{various stages of}} the 2 -year crop cycle. Both types of data showed that the rats were relatively sedentary. The average distance traveled between successive trap captures was 104 feet, and 65 percent of the successive captures were made within 75 feet of each other. Eighty-six percent of the radiotelemetry bearings located the rats within 300 feet of their burrows. Females moved less than males, and the home ranges of both sexes decreased as sugarcane matured. Initially, all rats lived in the gulches, although they foraged into the cane field at night. As the <b>cane</b> <b>matured,</b> more and more rats dug cane-field burrows.

Nine-week-old one-eye cane transplants were set into a 5 -foot grid in Molokai Low Humic Latosol on 27 October, 1968. Water use approached a 1 : 1 ratio with a conventional class A pan by late March, 1969 for a 3. 5 leaf area index. Average values were 0. 25 in/day for the midsummer months. The cane was ratooned on 10 May, 1969 and water use {{was reduced to a}} 0. 33 fraction of pan evaporation. The cane regrew rapidly and water use was again equivalent to pan evaporation by July, 1969. Neither gypsum resistance blocks nor the neutron probe gave acceptable measurements of water withdrawal from Molokai Low Humic Latosol. Clear day net radiation over the canopy with a mid-day reflectance of 0. 21 was: net radiation = (1 - reflectance) sunlight - 0. 15 ly/min.

40|$|Tiruvadi Sambasiva Venkatraman (TSV) was a plant breeder. In {{response}} to a call from Pundit Madan Mohan Malaviya, he made it his mission to develop high-yielding varieties of sugarcane for manufacturing sugar and making it available as a sweetening agent and an energy source for the malnourished children of India. Using Saccharum officinarum, then under cultivation in India, as the female parent, he artificially fertilized it with pollen from S. barberi, which grew wild in Coimbatore. After 4 - 5 recurrent backcrossings of S. officinarum Chi wild Sorghum spontaneum with S. officinarum as the female parent, TSV selected the `rare' interspecies hybrid cane varieties that resembled sugarcane and had approximately 2. 5 cm thick juicy stems containing 16 - 18 % sucrose - nearly 35 times more than what occurred in parent stocks. The hybrid <b>canes</b> <b>matured</b> quickly, were resistant to waterlogging, drought, and to the red-rot disease caused by Glomerella tucumanensis (Sordariomycetes: Glomerellaceae), and to the sereh-virus disease. Most importantly, they were amenable for propagation using stem cuttings. In recognition {{of the development of}} high-yielding sugarcane varieties, TSV was conferred the titles Rao Bahadur, Rao Sahib, and Sir by the British Government, and Padma Bhushan by the Republic of India. In the next few decades, consequent to TSV's work, India turned into the second largest sugar producer in the world, after Brazil.

40|$|Graduation date: 1967 In 1960 {{tests were}} {{initiated}} on the Marion blackberry (Rubus hybrid) {{to study the}} effect of (1) plant spacing, (2) time of training canes to the trellis and (3) amount of cane to train to the trellis with regard to fruit bud formation and total yield. Plant spacing varied with 2. 5, 5 and 10 feet between plants in the row. Time of training the canes to the trellis was approximately {{the middle of the}} months of August, September, October and February. The amount of cane trained on the trellis was either the entire length of all sound canes or only enough of each cane to reach the adjacent plant. Total yield of fruit, fruit spur determinations, time of fruit bud formation, leaf size and number and carbohydrate:nitrogen ratio of leaves were studied and/or measured. Although yield differences were greatest {{in the early years of}} the planting, 4 -year averages indicate that closer spacing of plants resulted in highly significant increases. August-trained canes produced the highest yields, followed in order by February, September and October. Differences in yield between the length of canes trained were very small and generally non-significant. When more cane grox<rth was trained, a corresponding increase in training time was required, particularly at the closer plant spacings. August and September training of canes stimulated the axillary buds to elongate and produce lateral growth. These laterals on August-trained <b>canes</b> <b>matured</b> enough to allow the formation of fruit buds, while laterals on September-trained canes were generally too succulent to form fruit buds. August-trained canes produced more fruit spurs per foot of row than February-trained canes. No difference in number of flower buds per fruit spur occurred between August and February training. Leaf counts on November 1 indicated that trellis training done in August produced more trifoliate leaves per foot of row than when the canes remained on the ground. Trifoliate leaves from ground-level training were larger. Axillary buds were collected at 2 -week intervals starting on August 1 and continuing until November 15 for the purpose of determining the time of fruit bud formation. The canes were divided into three sections, (1) basal, (2) mid-and (3) terminal, and each sampled separately. Buds from trellis-level training changed little during August and September; however, on October 2, buds from the terminal area only of canes and laterals were showing elongation. By mid-October, buds from all areas of the cane were showing an elongation of the apex. The first and only floral structure, expressed as a broadening and flattening of the apex, was observed in terminal section buds sampled on November 15. In contrast, basal and mid-section buds from canes trained along the ground during the summer showed an elongation of the apex by October 2, and by November 15 well defined floral structures were observed. Buds from the terminal section of cane were beginning to show some elongation by mid-November. Carbohydrate and nitrogen determinations were made on trifoliate leaves sampled from various loci on the canes on November 1. Older leaves, regardless of plant spacing or time of training, had the lowest nitrogen content. Carbohydrate content of leaves was quite variable. The C:N ratio was lowest for the 5 -foot spacing in both trellis-level and ground-level training. Leaves from the terminal area of the. canes had the lowest C:N ratio...|$|R
