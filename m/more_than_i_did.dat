500|$|Along with Spears's {{performance}} specifically, [...] "Ten Sessions" [...] {{as a whole}} {{was generally}} well received by television critics. In television critics Alan Sepinwall and Matt Zoler Seitz's 2016 book TV (The Book), Sepinwall singles out this episode (along with Slap Bet) as episodes where he [...] "will still laugh, and be touched, and marvel at just how inventive a traditional-looking sitcom can be". [...] Bowman gave the episode a 'B' grade, and was more critical of [...] "Ten Sessions". She expressed: [...] "the timing wasn't spot-on all the way through 'Ten Sessions'. The episode was slow starting, and as with many of the series' 'Ted is a master of romance' attempts, the two-minute date seemed as likely to be annoying-quirky as endearing-quirky, if you were the one being wooed. I wanted to like it <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>did.</b> Maybe it almost works because Elliot on Scrubs would have really liked it, ditzy romantic that she is. But no — it's just an ounce heavy on the trying-too-hard scale." [...] In contrast, Zoromski gave the episode an 8.9 out of ten, signifying a [...] "great" [...] rating. He thought that the episode was superior to the previous episode, adding that the show returned to full form.|$|E
2500|$|Michael Slezak from Entertainment Weekly {{commented that}} [...] "the video {{actually}} makes {{me like the}} song <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> when I heard it on its own." [...] The video won two prizes at the 2007 MVPA Awards for Best Video and Best Direction of a Female Artist. It was also nominated for Video of the Year at the Juno Awards of 2007.|$|E
2500|$|With the {{suspension}} and then Pittsburgh's early elimination from the playoffs, Cooke had {{a considerable amount}} of free time. He spent much of the time with Penguins head coach Dan Bylsma reviewing each of his hits to learn how to change his game to hit within the rules. Cooke said, [...] "The way I played before was to get the biggest hit possible every time no matter what," [...] and that now in [...] "certain situations, I just approach differently. I try to get the puck <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> before." [...] Well into the 2011–12 season, teammate Craig Adams said of Cooke's play, [...] "I've noticed over the last month or so, he's been feeling more comfortable being physical again, obviously, within the rules. That {{was a big part of}} his game." [...] At season's end, he had scored a career-high 19 goals and posted only 44 penalty minutes, his lowest career total in a full NHL season.|$|E

6000|$|... "Don't say that, my son--it must {{be through}} a better Friend <b>than</b> <b>I</b> am-- who loves you <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>do.</b> <b>I</b> have not died for you--He did." ...|$|R

60|$|Mackintosh is, it seems, {{the writer}} of the {{defensive}} letter in the Morning Chronicle. If so, it is very kind, and <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> for myself.|$|E
6000|$|... 'That I don't know {{anything}} about,' she stammered. 'But Cytherea didn't, of course, dream any <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>did,</b> or {{others in the}} parish, that he was married.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I wanted Lawrence <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> the others," [...] grumbled Jason Sparr. He {{was doing}} some deep {{thinking}} and his face showed that he was much disturbed.|$|E
60|$|DAISY. You needn't {{hesitate}} {{to say anything}} about the Eurasians. You can't hate and despise them <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>do.</b>|$|R

6000|$|... "I'm {{not talking}} of lawyers," [...] said Anko reprovingly. [...] "I'm {{talking about my}} pain. I don't imagine anyone could suffer <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> with that stomach ache." ...|$|E
6000|$|I fancied Boone saw {{the drift}} of this, which was <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>did,</b> and the farmer nodded oracularly in his {{direction}} when I asked: [...] "What did you do instead?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ask him!" [...] said Aylward modestly, nodding towards Black Simon. [...] "He saw <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>did.</b> And yet, by {{the holy}} nails! there was not very much that I did not see either." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Sure," [...] {{chimed in}} Grierson, who was frightened, [...] "that's right, Hugh. I didn't mean anything. Nobody appreciates you <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>do,</b> old man." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He knows <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>do,</b> then. He knows <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> ever shall know. Ada, {{you should}} not have said so. It {{will have to be}} all unsaid." ...|$|R
6000|$|Jess laughed, and answered, [...] "Jantje {{does not}} like Frank Muller any <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>do,</b> but <b>I</b> don't know why. He will never tell me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But I've {{had to let}} {{out every}} one of my dresses AGAIN. I weigh four pounds <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> in July. Anne, WHERE will this end? Mrs. Morgan's heroines are all tall and slender." ...|$|E
60|$|Here {{she lived}} for about seven years, {{and the old}} gentleman, when she died, wept over her grave a great deal <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>did,</b> who was then too young to mind {{anything}} but toys or sweetmeats.|$|E
6000|$|... "Upon my word, Mrs. Greene, I must deny that," [...] said I, jumping up. [...] "What {{on earth}} could I have done <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> do? I {{have been to}} Milan and nearly fagged myself to death." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, Janet," [...] {{the guest}} may say (for he enjoys her {{interference}} <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>do),</b> [...] "you make him so comfortable that you spoil him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Good-evening, Mr. Holmes," [...] said he. [...] "I am sure I am {{very much}} obliged {{to you for}} coming round. No one ever needed your advice <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>do.</b> <b>I</b> suppose that Dr. Trevelyan has told you of this most unwarrantable {{intrusion}} into my rooms." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes, it's pretty fresh,' assented Pancks. 'As a {{stranger}} {{you feel the}} climate <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>do,</b> <b>I</b> dare say. Indeed I haven't got time to feel it.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "For you--very little. I wonder. For me--every thing. Yes--everything. You didn't mean it, Master; you didn't {{know any}} <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> when I began, but love {{between a man}} and a woman is {{sometimes}} very one-sided. Fearfully one-sided! That's all...." ...|$|E
6000|$|We were disappointed, {{and felt}} {{that we could not}} attain to the {{feelings}} in the Confirmation poem in the Christian Year--Mr. Castleford's gift to me. Still, I believe that, though encumbered with such a drag as myself, Clarence, <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>did,</b> ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Very well," [...] said Hans, [...] "if ye {{will have}} it, I will {{tell it to}} you; but, after all, it is not better than my own story, and the poor man in the end gets no <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> in my bargains." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I guess I could, if I wasn't {{afraid of}} uncle. He knows so much <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>do,</b> he'd laugh," [...] began Geordie, evidently {{puzzled by the}} question.|$|R
6000|$|... "What business?" [...] asked Sir Henry sharply. [...] "It {{seems to}} me that all you gentlemen know a great deal <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> about my own affairs." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I wish it hadn't, Tetterby, {{with all}} my heart and soul <b>I</b> <b>do</b> assure you," [...] said his wife. [...] "You can't wish it <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>do,</b> Tetterby." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, dear blessed sir, and {{you will}} send Sir John to pray with me? For I turned, sir, I turned: but I could not help it--I could not abear the torments: but she bore them, sweet angel--and <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>did.</b> Oh, dear me!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I say, that isn't fair, mother! Neither of {{them was}} new, and the boy needed the best <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>did,</b> and I wore the old one all winter, didn't I?" [...] asked Jack, who had rather exulted over Frank, and was now taken down himself.|$|E
6000|$|... "No man's {{principles}} {{can remain}} stable in an unstable world," [...] Miller pronounced. [...] "I still detest force and compulsion of every sort, but I recognise its necessity in our present civil life far <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> {{in a war}} which was, after all, a war of politicians." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{am quite}} {{accustomed}} to it," [...] said Pendleton, quietly. [...] "It happens {{once or twice}} a year, and when I go out--well--I miss <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> here." ...|$|R
