40|$|In {{heterogeneous}} wireless networks (HWNs), both single-homed and multi-homed terminals {{are supported}} to provide connectivity to users. A multiservice single-homed <b>multi-mode</b> <b>terminal</b> can support multiple types of services, such as voice call, file download and video streaming simultaneously on {{any one of the}} available radio access technologies (RATs) such as Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN), and Long Term Evolution (LTE). Consequently, a single-homed <b>multi-mode</b> <b>terminal</b> having multiple on-going calls may need to perform a vertical handover from one RAT to another. One of the major issues in HWNs is how to select the most suitable RAT for multiple handoff calls, and the selection of a suitable RAT for multiple-calls from a single-homed <b>multi-mode</b> <b>terminal</b> in HWNs is a group decision problem. This is because a single-homed <b>multi-mode</b> <b>terminal</b> can connect to only one RAT at a time, and therefore multiple handoff calls from the terminal have to be handed over to the same RAT. In making group decision for multiple-calls, the quality of service (QoS) requirements for individual calls needs to be considered. Thus, the RAT that most satisfies the QoS requirements of individual calls is selected as the most suitable RAT for the multiple-calls. Whereas most research efforts in HWNs have concentrated on developing vertical handoff decision schemes for a single call from a <b>multi-mode</b> <b>terminal,</b> not much has been reported in the literature on RAT-selection for multiple-calls from a single-homed <b>multi-mode</b> <b>terminal</b> in next generation wireless networks (NGWNs). In addition, not much has been done to investigate the sensitivity of RAT-selection criteria for multiple-calls in NGWNs. Therefore, this dissertation addresses these issues by focusing on following two main aspects: (1) comparative analysis of four candidate multi-criteria group decision-making (MCGDM) schemes that could be adapted for making RAT-selection decisions for multiple-calls, and (2) development of a new RAT-selection scheme named the consensus RAT-selection model. In comparative analysis of the candidate RAT-selection schemes, four MCGDM schemes namely: distance to the ideal alternative-group decision making (DIA-GDM), multiplicative exponent weighting-group decision making (MEW-GDM), simply additive weighting-group decision making (SAW-GDM), technique for order preference by similarity to Ideal solution-group decision making (TOPSIS-GDM) are considered. The performance of the multiple-calls RAT-selection schemes is evaluated using the MATLAB simulation tool. The results show that DIA-GDM and TOPSIS-GDM schemes are more suitable for multiple handoff calls than SAW-GDM and MEW-GDM schemes. This is because they are consistent and less-sensitive in making RAT-selection decision than the other two schemes, with regards to RAT-selection criteria (service price, data rate, security, battery power consumption and network delay) in HWNs. In addition, the newly developed RAT-selection scheme incorporates RAT-consensus level for improving RAT-selection decisions for multiple-calls. Numerical results conducted in MATLAB validate the effectiveness and performance of the newly proposed RAT-selection scheme for multiple-calls in HWNs...|$|E

The objective of our MDVT approach is to adapt the video transmission to a multi-radio environment where two or more independent transmission paths exist between the intermediate node and the receiver. The sender {{does not have to}} be aware of the transcoding process and the multi-path transmission. MDVT can for instance be applied for <b>multi-mode</b> <b>terminals</b> that are simultaneously connected to two wireless access technologies, e. g., UMTS and WLAN. We compare MDVT with multiple description coding at the sender (MDC-S) as well as with MDC at the intermediate node (MDC-I) where the incoming single description video is decoded and re-encoded into multiple descriptions and the transmission is optimized separately for each path. We present a fast greedy method that can be used to perform multiple description video transcoding in real-time at low complexity. Our experimental results show that we can achieve performance similar to MDC-S where the sender has to be aware of the availability of multiple paths.

In this work a new low power and low silicon area programmable baseband processor architecture aimed for <b>multi-mode</b> <b>terminals</b> is presented. The architecture {{is based on a}} customized DSP core and a number of hardware accelerators connected via a configurable network. The architecture offers a good tradeoff between flexibility and performance through an optimized instruction set, efficient hardware acceleration of carefully selected functions, low memory cost, and low control overhead. One main contribution of this work is a study of important issues in programmable baseband processing such as software-hardware partitioning, instruction level acceleration, low power design, and memory issues. Further contributions are a unique optimized instruction set architecture, a unique architecture for efficient integration of hardware accelerators in the processor, and mapping of complete baseband applications to the presented architecture. The architecture has been proven in a manufactured demonstrator chip for wireless LAN applications. Wireless LAN firmware has been developed and run on the chip at full speed. Silicon area and measured power consumption have proven to be similar to that of a non-programmable ASIC solution...|$|R
40|$|Real-time {{multi-media}} {{applications are}} increasingly being mapped onto MPSoC (multi-processor system-on-chip) platforms containing hardware-software IPs (intellectual property) along with a library of common scheduling policies such as EDF, RM. The choice of a scheduling policy for each IP is a key decision that greatly affects the design’s ability to meet real-time constraints, and also directly affects the energy consumed by the design. We present a cosynthesis framework for design space exploration that considers heterogenous scheduling while mapping multimedia applications onto such MPSoCs. In our approach, we select a suitable scheduling policy for each IP such that system energy is minimized – our framework also includes energy reduction techniques utilizing dynamic power management. Experimental results on a realistic <b>multi-mode</b> multi-media <b>terminal</b> application demonstrate that our approach enables us to select design points with up to 60. 5 % reduced energy for a given area constraint, while meeting all real-time requirements. More importantly, our approach generates a tradeoff space between energy and cost allowing designers to comparatively evaluate multiple system level mappings...|$|R
