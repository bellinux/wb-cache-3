5|$|Founded in 1936, the Bristol Historical Society is {{committed}} to saving, collecting, and promoting historical research and interest in southern New England, with a specific focus on the town of Bristol. Originally, the Bristol Historical Society was located in the Rogers Free Library, but a fire destroyed {{a part of the}} collections on July 27, 1957. The jail, which had been abandoned by the state in June of the same year, was selected by the Society as its new home and leased from the state. In 1972, the Bristol Historical Society was renamed to the Bristol Historical and Preservation Society to reflect its preservation interests. In 1973, the Society purchased the Bristol County Jail from the state.

5|$|While at college, Reed interned for Congressman Joseph Patrick KennedyII. During his {{internship}} {{he learned}} about a federal dollar-for-dollar <b>matching</b> <b>grant</b> program. In his senior year and as the undergraduate trustee on the University's Board of Trustees, he instituted a $15-per-semester student fee increase to be matched by the federal grant, with monies to be earmarked for the university's endowment. The fees were expected to total nearly $300,000 per semester. The estimate was conservative {{in the sense that}} it only assumes the fees from slightly more than 75% of the 12,000 students. The four-year totals would approach a $2.4million addition to the endowment. Reed earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in political science in 1991. He earned his juris doctorate from Howard University School of Law in 1995. In 2002 Reed was appointed as the youngest General Trustee to serve on Howard's Board of Trustees and continues to serve on that board.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{develops}} a theoretical explanation why {{it may be}} optimal for higher-level governments to pay categorical block <b>grants</b> or closed-ended <b>matching</b> <b>grants</b> to local governments. We consider a federation with two types of local governments which differ {{in the cost of}} providing public goods. The federal government redistributes between jurisdictions, but cannot observe the type of a jurisdiction. In this asymmetric information setting it is shown that the second-best optimum can be decentralized with the help of categorical block <b>grants</b> and closed-ended <b>matching</b> <b>grants,</b> but not with unconditional block <b>grants</b> or open-ended <b>matching</b> <b>grants.</b> asymmetric information, categorical block <b>grants,</b> closed-ended <b>matching</b> <b>grants...</b>|$|R
40|$|This paper {{questions}} {{the effectiveness of}} <b>matching</b> <b>grants</b> to correct for interjurisdictional spillovers {{in the light of}} Bernheim general neutrality result. Indeed this result suggests that the usual argument that <b>matching</b> <b>grants</b> are needed to internalize the externality arising from the existence of interjuridictional spillovers is an artifact of the assumption that jurisdictions neglect the impact that their decisions have on the federal budget. Relaxing this assumption and using a classical model where the arbitrage resulting from labor mobility implies that redistribution has the properties of a public good, we find that <b>matching</b> <b>grants</b> are relevant although much less effective. We also find that optimal matching rates are independent of the jurisdictions' choice of policy variable contrarily to the case where jurisdictions ignore the impact of their decisions on the federal budget.

40|$|Although {{decision}} processes at the EU {{level are}} highly complex and often require unanimity, explicit side payments among member states are unknown.

This paper considers the EU regional policy {{as a substitute}} for explicit side payments and asks – from a normative and a positive point of view – why <b>matching</b> <b>grants</b> instead of unconditional grants are used although at first sight regional policy is a national and not a union-wide task. It argues that the EU system of own resources creates positive vertical fiscal externalities. Hence, <b>matching</b> <b>grants</b> are part of an efficient grant system and, in so far as bargaining in EU bodies is efficient, <b>matching</b> <b>grants</b> are the natural outcome.
