25|$|What {{remains in}} <b>my</b> <b>memory</b> {{of this day}} is the {{constant}} taking up of new positions, followed by constant orders to retire, terrible blocks on the roads, inability to find anyone anywhere; by exceeding good luck almost complete freedom from shelling, a complete absence of food of any kind except what could be picked up from abandoned dumps.|$|E
25|$|At Brisbane, on a wicket {{that was}} the worst that I have ever seen, the Yorkshireman was superb. The head-high bouncer was safely ignored.

25|$|One common {{interpretation}} {{is that the}} possibility exists that one might misremember the sensation, and therefore {{one does not have}} any firm criterion for using S in each case. So, for example, I might one day focus on that sensation, and link it to the symbol S; but the next day, I have no criteria for knowing that the sensation I have now {{is the same as the}} one yesterday, except for my memory; and since <b>my</b> <b>memory</b> might fail me, I have no firm criteria for knowing that the sensation I have now is indeed S.|$|E
25|$|Many of {{the young}} Kashgari women were most {{attractive}} in appearance, {{and some of the}} little girls quite lovely, their plaits of long hair falling from under a jaunty little embroidered cap, their big dark eyes, flashing teeth and piquant olive faces reminding me of Italian or Spanish children. One most beautiful boy stands out in <b>my</b> <b>memory.</b> He was clad in a new shirt and trousers of flowered pink, his crimson velvet cap embroidered with gold, and as he smiled and salaamed to us I thought he looked like a fairy prince. The women wear their hair in two or five plaits much thickened and lengthened by the addition of yak's hair, but the children in several tiny plaits.|$|E
25|$|The {{dropping}} of McCosker angered Ian Chappell and {{his teammates}} and I copped the brunt of it. I {{may have been an}} unassuming guy at the time, but I was rudely awakened to the facts of life at test level – thanks, or rather no thanks to Chappell {{and the rest of the}} team. I was not exactly welcomed with open arms into the team. In fact, I was lucky to discover my locker in the Australian dressing rooms. To top it off, Chappell figured that if I was selected to replace McCosker, that's exactly what I would do... at Number 3. I suppose you could say it was an honour to bat ahead of Ian and Greg Chappell in a test. But I have no doubts that certain members of that team wanted me to fail and therefore prove that the selectors had erred. Normally, a new batsman could expect to be cradled into the side and be 'hidden' down the order until he gets the feel of the test atmosphere. There was no such deal for me. I was thrown into the deep end, to sink or swim, and that will live in <b>my</b> <b>memory</b> forever. While I am captain of a team, no batsman will be given the shoddy treatment I received on my test debut.|$|E

Writing in The Observer, the critic Ivor Brown said of Robey's portrayal: [...] "In no performance within <b>my</b> <b>memory</b> has the actor been more obviously the afflicted servant of his lines and more obviously the omnipotent master of the situation". Another journalist, writing in the Daily Mirror, thought that Robey [...] "gave 25 percent of Shakespeare and 75 percent of himself".|$|E

In the Kaióa Islands he finds some virgin forest where the beetles are more abundant than anywhere he ever saw in his life, with swarms of golden Buprestidae, rose-chafers, and long-horned weevils, as well as longicorn beetles.

If you think proper to make me a present of a new coat, you will then know exactly what it costs". [...] Another interested spectator claimed that since his entrance fee was paying for Lambert's clothing, he had the right to know about it; Lambert replied [...] "Sir, if I knew what part of my next coat your shilling would pay for, I can assure you I would cut out the piece". Lambert calculated in 1806 that a full suit of clothes cost him £20, about £ as of [...]|$|E
500|$|Around this period, the Ravens {{decided on}} a new, {{permanent}} name: the Kinks. Numerous explanations of the name's genesis have been offered. In Jon Savage's analysis, they [...] "needed a gimmick, some edge to get them attention. Here it was: 'Kinkiness'—something newsy, naughty but just on the borderline of acceptability. In adopting the 'Kinks' as their name at that time, they were participating in a time-honoured pop ritual—fame through outrage." [...] Manager Robert Wace related {{his side of the}} story: [...] "I had a friend... He thought the group was rather fun. If <b>my</b> <b>memory</b> is correct, he came up with the name just as an idea, as a good way of getting publicity... When we went to [...] with the name, they were... absolutely horrified. They said, 'We're not going to be called kinky! Ray Davies' account conflicts with Wace's—he recalled that the name was coined by Larry Page, and referenced their [...] "kinky" [...] fashion sense. Davies quoted him as saying, [...] "The way you look, and the clothes you wear, you ought to be called the Kinks." [...] "I've never really liked the name", Ray stated.|$|E

500|$|At Murfreesboro, Breckinridge's Division was {{assigned}} to Lieutenant General William J. Hardee's Corps and was stationed {{on the east side}} of the Stones River. When the Union Army of the Cumberland, commanded by Major General William Rosecrans, attacked on December 31, 1862, beginning the Battle of Stones River, Bragg's main force initially repelled the attack. Bragg ordered Breckinridge to reinforce him on the west side of the river, but Brigadier General John Pegram, who commanded a Cavalry brigade, erroneously reported that a large Union force was advancing along the east bank, and Breckinridge was slow to comply with Bragg's order. When he finally crossed the river, his attacks were ineffective, and Bragg ordered him back across the river. By January 2, Union forces had taken a ridge that ran along the river; against Breckinridge's advice, Bragg ordered the 2nd Division to launch a near-suicidal attack on the federal position. Prior to the attack, Breckinridge wrote to Preston, [...] "if [...] should result in disaster and I be among the killed, I want you to do justice to <b>my</b> <b>memory</b> and tell the people that I believed this attack to be very unwise and tried to prevent it." ...|$|E
500|$|Caine {{had mixed}} {{feelings}} about both the production and the final version. He thinks {{that it was a}} first for him to be involved with someone his own age in a film. He compares the relationship between two middle-aged people to the romance between two teenagers. Although disappointed {{not to be able to}} collect an Academy Award because of filming in the Bahamas, he was glad to be involved in the film. In the press release, he explains that [...] "it is part of movie history... the original was one of the great all-time thrillers. I thought it might be nice to be mixed up with that. I liked the script very much." [...] However, Caine later claimed: [...] "I have never seen it , but by all accounts it is terrible. However, I have seen the house that it built, and it is terrific!" [...] In his 1992 autobiography What's it All About?, he says that the film [...] "will go down in <b>my</b> <b>memory</b> as the time when I won an Oscar, paid for a house and had a great holiday.
