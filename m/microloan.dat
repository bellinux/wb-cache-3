Through Sri Lanka-based NGO Sudeesa (also {{known as the}} Small Fishers Federation of Lanka), Seacology is funding a significant expansion of that organization's existing <b>microloan</b> and job-training programs. In exchange, the beneficiaries of these programs must agree to assist in protecting their local mangrove habitats. The training is designed in part to give low-income women in these communities alternatives to harvesting mangroves, a subsistence activity that {{has contributed to the}} forests' degradation. The project also established three large nursery facilities to grow several species of mangroves, to be replanted in areas previously cleared for aquaculture and other unsustainable development, as well as several areas destroyed during the Sri Lankan Civil War.|$|E

40|$|A lack of {{financial}} means {{is viewed as}} a key reason why small businesses fail. Therefore, also in Germany several institutions tried to establish <b>microloans</b> as a financing tool. A first empirical study, building a benchmark for similar studies in Western Europe, shows that about 15 percent of all self-employed individuals would be interested in getting access to <b>microloans.</b> The study also demonstrates that these financial needs exist in target groups different from what was previously expected at least in Germany.

A corollary to this hypothesis is that food aid to developing nations will only exacerbate overpopulation. She has advocated in favor of <b>microloans</b> to women in the place of international aid, because she believes <b>microloans</b> allow improvement in the lives of families without leading to higher fertility.|$|R
