40|$|The {{discovery}} of <b>millisecond</b> pulsations from neutron stars in low mass X-ray binary (LMXB) systems has substantiated the theoretical prediction that links <b>millisecond</b> radio pulsars (MSRPs) and LMXBs. Since then, {{the process that}} produces <b>millisecond</b> radio pulsars from LMXBs, followed by spin-down due to dipole radiation has been conceived as the 'standard evolution' of <b>millisecond</b> pulsars. However, the question whether all the observed <b>millisecond</b> radio pulsars could be produced by LMXBs has not been quantitatively addressed until now. The standard evolutionary process produces <b>millisecond</b> pulsars with periods (P) and spin-down rates (Pdot) that are not entirely independent. The possible P-Pdot values that <b>millisecond</b> radio pulsars can attain are jointly constrained. In order to test whether the observed <b>millisecond</b> radio pulsars are the unequivocal descendants of <b>millisecond</b> X-ray pulsars (MSXP), we have produced a probability map that represents the expected distribution of <b>millisecond</b> radio pulsars for the standard model. We show with more than 95 % confidence that the fastest spinning <b>millisecond</b> radio pulsars with high magnetic fields, e. g.

40|$|We have {{monitored}} a {{large sample}} of <b>millisecond</b> pulsars using the 100 -m Effelsberg radio telescope {{in order to}} compare their radio emission properties to the slowly rotating population. With some notable exceptions, {{our findings suggest that}} the two groups of objects share many common properties. A comparison of the spectral indices between samples of normal and <b>millisecond</b> pulsars demonstrates that <b>millisecond</b> pulsar spectra are not significantly different from those of normal pulsars. There is evidence, however, that <b>millisecond</b> pulsars are slightly less luminous and less efficient radio emitters compared to normal pulsars. We confirm recent suggestions that a diversity exists among the luminosities of <b>millisecond</b> pulsars with the isolated <b>millisecond</b> pulsars being less luminous than the binary <b>millisecond</b> pulsars. There are indications that old <b>millisecond</b> pulsars exhibit somewhat flatter spectra than the presumably younger ones. We present evidence that <b>millisecond</b> pulsar profiles are only marginally more complex than those found among the normal pulsar population. Moreover, the development of the profiles with frequency is rather slow, suggesting very compact magnetospheres. The profile development seems to anti-correlate with the companion mass and the spin period, again suggesting that the amount of mass transfer in a binary system might directly influence the emission properties. The angular radius of radio beams of <b>millisecond</b> pulsars does not follow the scaling predicted from a canonical pulsar model which is applicable for normal pulsars. Instead they are systematically smaller. The smaller inferred luminosity and narrower emission beams will need to be considered in future calculations of the birth-rate of the Galactic population.

5|$|The {{companion}} {{which is}} supposed to have spun-up PSR B1937+21 is no longer present, making it one of few <b>millisecond</b> pulsars which does not have a stellar mass companion. The generally high occurrence of companions to <b>millisecond</b> pulsars is to be expected, considering a companion is necessary to spin-up <b>millisecond</b> pulsars to their short periods. However, <b>millisecond</b> pulsars do not actively accrete matter from a companion, but instead need to have only done this at some time in the past, and thus the lack of companion for PSR B1937+21 is not seen as a being in disagreement with the spin-up model.

Outside the radio band, the soft X-ray range (∼ 0. 1 – 10 keV) is {{most suitable for}} studying radiative mechanisms operating in these fascinating objects. X-ray observations revealed diverse properties of emission from <b>millisecond</b> pulsars. For the most of them, the bulk of radiation is of a thermal origin, emitted from small spots (polar caps) on the neutron star surface heated by relativistic particles produced in pulsar acceleration zones. On the other hand, a few other very fast rotating pulsars exhibit almost pure nonthermal emission generated, most probably, in pulsar magnetospheres. There are also examples of nonthermal emission detected from X-ray nebulae powered by <b>millisecond</b> pulsars, {{as well as from}} pulsar winds shocked in binary systems with <b>millisecond</b> pulsars as companions.

5|$|Typical pulsar periods {{for young}} pulsars {{are of the}} order of one second, and they {{increase}} with time; the very short periods exhibited by so-called millisecond pulsars are due to the transfer of material from a binary companion.

5|$|Due to the {{complexity}} of proteins' conformation or configuration space (the set of possible shapes a protein can take), and limits in computing power, all-atom molecular dynamics simulations have been severely limited in the timescales which they can study. While most proteins typically fold in the order of <b>milliseconds,</b> before 2010 simulations could only reach nanosecond to microsecond timescales. General-purpose supercomputers have been used to simulate protein folding, but such systems are intrinsically costly and typically shared among many research groups. Further, because the computations in kinetic models occur serially, strong scaling of traditional molecular simulations to these architectures is exceptionally difficult. Moreover, as protein folding is a stochastic process and can statistically vary over time, it is challenging computationally to use long simulations for comprehensive views of the folding process.|$|E

40|$|Basic {{ideas about}} the torques on the neutron star and the {{existence}} of an equilibrium rotation period followed from the recognition that most X-ray binaries contain accretion powered neutron stars. The evolution of binaries through a phase of accretion onto the neutron star, eventually leading to a post-accretion radio pulsar phase, was initially discussed as a way to understand the scarcity of binaries among the radio pulsars and the relatively short rotation periods of the first discovered binary radio pulsars in terms of magnetic fields that would be smaller than the familiar $ 10 ^{ 12 } G$ range. The discovery of the <b>millisecond</b> pulsars made us realize that the fields can be much lower in a new class of radio pulsars that have been spun up by accretion in LMXBs. The predicted spin-down rates of the <b>millisecond</b> pulsar was soon confirmed. The observers' search for <b>millisecond</b> X-ray periods was on, leading first to the discovery of QPOs, and eventually to the discovery of the X-ray <b>millisecond</b> pulsars.

40|$|The precise {{origins of}} the <b>millisecond</b> radio pulsars, {{discovered}} in the early 1980 s 1, remain uncertain until this day. They plausibly evolve from accreting low magnetic-field neutron stars in X-ray binary systems 2, 3. If so, these stars should spin at <b>millisecond</b> rates. In accordance with this idea, quasi-periodic oscillations discovered in X-ray binaries around 50 Hz 4 and 1 kHz 5, 6, and drifting oscillations at several 100 Hz in X-ray bursts 6 have all been interpreted in terms of <b>millisecond</b> spins of weakly magnetized neutron stars 7, 8.
