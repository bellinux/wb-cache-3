In hierdie artikel word verwysings na stieffamilieverhoudings beperk tot gevalle waar die biologiese ouer met haar of sy kinders in 'n huwelik of burgerlike vennootskap met 'n persoon wat nie 'n biologiese ouer is nie in 'n gemeenskaplike huishouding betrokke is. Sedert die beslissing van Heystek v Heystek, is hierdie aspek in Botha v Botha en in MB v NB in oënskou geneem. Die doel met hierdie artikel is om opnuut na die regsfundering van so 'n "aanspraak" binne die Suid-Afrikaanse reg te kyk. Die artikel word in vier hoofdele verdeel. Eerstens, sal die verskillende regsteoretiese funderings van die onderhoudsplig beskryf word. Daarna word die bespreking opgevolg deur 'n bondige bespreking van buitelandse reg, waarna die Suid-Afrikaanse reg as derde hoofdeel van nader beskou sal word. Die artikel word deur 'n slotbeskouing afgesluit. In {{this article}} the {{foundation}} of a step-child's claim for maintenance against a step-parent is investigated. Primarily three foundations for a child's <b>maintenance</b> <b>claim</b> are revealed namely the formalistic and status based justification; {{the best interests of the}} child justification; and the functional justification. The first mentioned justification does not apply as foundation for the <b>maintenance</b> <b>claim</b> of the stepchild against the step-parent because the step-parent is not the natural or putative parent. The second justification focuses on the economic needs of children and the economic dislocation they suffer when formerly relied support from a step-parent is lost. The last justification pays attention to the social reality of relationships rather than to the formal characteristics thereof. Two reasons are given why the last mentioned justification applies to the <b>maintenance</b> <b>claim</b> of step-children. One, harm and compensation may serve as basis for the liability to pay maintenance. Two, the case where the step-parent takes over the role of parent the in loco parentis principle may serve as a foundation. The comparative law investigation reveals that the majority of foreign country systems grounds the claim on the in loco parentis principle. Different foundations for the claim are found in South African case law. The fact that the parties are married makes them liable for the maintenance of the common household. Two foundational possibilities arise from this. One, the consortium of the marriage grounds the maintenance obligation which is without any foundation in our law. Two, the obligation is founded upon the purchase for household necessaries. In a legal theoretical sense this is unacceptable because there are fundamental differences between the capacity to purchase household necessaries and a claim for maintenance. Section 28 (1) (b) and (2) of the constitution are tabled as foundation for the claim. The fact that the step-parent acts in loco parentis grounds the obligation. Lastly, de facto adoption is also forwarded as foundation. The call on different justifications creates confusion and results in different answers. The maintenance of a child must primarily serve to satisfy the financial needs of the child and should focus less on the psychic and psychological support of the child. However, the economic reliance of the child on the support should also not be ignored. Therefore a combination of the reliance based justification and the in loco parentis foundation is advocated which I think is achieved in the MB case where section 28 (1) (b) of the constitution in combination with the in loco parentis principle was applied.

40|$|On 1 July 2007 section 17 of the Children’s Act 38 of 2005 {{came into}} operation. It lowered {{the age of}} {{majority}} from 21 years to 18 years and brought our law into alignment with the notion in international human rights law that 18 years {{marks the end of}} childhood (see Schäfer Child law in South Africa (2011) 16; Boezaart “Child law, the child and South African private law” in Boezaart (ed) Child law in South Africa (2009) 17). This reduction in the age of majority had several repercussions for young dependent adults between the ages of 18 to 20. This once protected group of people is now exposed to contractual liability, prescription may run against them and they must institute and defend legal proceedings in their own name (see Schäfer Child law in South Africa 23).

This article investigates certain aspects of the Dutch legal position with a view to commenting on, and suggesting solutions to, corresponding challenges in the South African context. Issues such as the effect of unworthiness to inherit on matrimonial property claims as well as <b>maintenance</b> <b>claims</b> against a deceased estate, the suitability and appropriateness for South African law of a “forgiveness provision” that eliminates unworthiness similar to the one included in the Book 4 of the Dutch Civil Code and the {{regulation of}} unworthiness to inherit in the context of euthanasia are analysed from a legal-comparative standpoint...|$|R

40|$|Software <b>maintenance</b> <b>claims</b> a large {{proportion}} of organizational resources. It is thought that many maintenance problems derive from inadequate software design and development practices. Poor design choices can result in complex software that is costly to support and difficult to change. However, it is difficult to assess the actual maintenance performance effects of software development practices because their impact is realized over the software life cycle. To estimate the impact of development activities in a more practical time frame, this research develops a two-stage model in which software complexity is a key intermediate variable that links design and development decisions to their downstream effects on software maintenance. The research analyzes data collected from a national mass merchandising retailer on 29 software enhancement projects and 23 software applications in a large IBM COBOL environment. Results indicate that the use of a code generator in development is associated with increased software complexity and software enhancement project effort. The use of packaged software is associated with decreased software complexity and software enhancement effort. These results suggest an important link between software development practices and maintenance performance.

40|$|Australia and New Zealand are {{currently}} reviewing the regulations governing nutrition function, health and related claims on foods. Health claims currently {{are not permitted}} on food labels, with one exception. The {{aim of this study}} was to describe the use of such claims on packaged food for sale in Australia (excluding nutrient content claims) prior to any changes to the regulations, and measure compliance with existing regulations. A survey was conducted of the labelling of 7850 products (including multiple pack sizes of individual foods) in 47 different food categories on sale in New South Wales in 2003. A total of 2098 nutrition function, health or related claims and 12 therapeutic claims were recorded. Fourteen percent of products carried some sort of claim. If nutrient function and general health <b>maintenance</b> <b>claims</b> are excluded, 8. 1 % of products carried a health or related claim. Using the claims categorisation proposed by Food Standards Australia New Zealand for a new standard on claims, general-level claims were found on 9. 8 % of products and high-level and therapeutic claims (illegal at the time) on 1. 2 %. The food categories with the highest proportion of products carrying claims were sports drinks (92 %), energy drinks (84 %), sports bars (57 %) and breakfast cereals (54 %). 118 high-level and therapeutic claims did not conform to current food standards and there were many general-level claims for ingredient benefits that were unlikely to be able to be scientifically substantiated. The results of this survey suggest that more than 5 % of claims were not complying with the current regulations and that the standards were not being fully enforced. To be effective, the new standard will need to be accompanied by clear guidelines for manufacturers on requirements for substantiating claims. Comprehensive education and enforcement frameworks also will be needed, to reduce the number of illegal or apparently unsubstantiated claims...|$|R

The literature review identifies the length of predetermined maintenance interval as an importance characteristic of scheduled maintenance strategy. A quantitative approach is adopted and carried out through questionnaire survey. Subsequently, descriptive analysis and correlation analysis are used to analyse the collected data. Then, research result demonstrates that the length of predetermined maintenance interval is significantly correlated to the maintenance performance. The length of predetermined maintenance interval {{must be considered in}} maintenance planning and execution. The research recommends continuous monitoring or regular inspection of building systems and components to identify their condition and update the length of predetermined maintenance interval regularly. Consequently, the effective maintenance execution helps to avoid systems failure occurs and optimises maintenance performance...|$|R

40|$|Software {{systems are}} subject to {{continuous}} changes to adapt to new and changing requirements. This phenomenon, known as software evolution, leads {{in the long term}} to software aging: The size and the complexity of systems increase, while their quality decreases. In this context, {{it is no wonder that}} software <b>maintenance</b> <b>claims</b> the most part of a software system's cost. The analysis of software evolution helps practitioners deal with the negative effects of software aging. With the advent of the Internet and the consequent widespread adoption of distributed development tools, such as software configuration management and issue tracking systems, a vast amount of valuable information concerning software evolution has become available. In the last two decades, researchers have focused on mining and analyzing this data, residing in various software repositories, to understand software evolution and support maintenance activities. However, most approaches target a specific maintenance task, and consider only one of the several facets of software evolution. Such approaches, and the infrastructures that implement them, cannot be extended to address different maintenance problems. In this dissertation, we propose an integrated view of software evolution that combines different evolutionary aspects. Our thesis is that an integrated and flexible approach supports an extensible set of software maintenance activities. To this aim, we present a meta-model that integrates two aspects of software evolution: source code and software defects. We implemented our approach in a framework that, by retrieving information from source code and defect repositories, serves as a basis to create analysis techniques and tools. To show the flexibility of our approach, we extended our meta-model and framework with e-mail information extracted from development mailing lists. To validate our thesis, we devised and evaluated, on top of our approach, a number of novel analysis techniques that achieve two goals: 1. Inferring the causes of problems in a software system. We propose three retrospective analysis techniques, based on interactive visualizations, to analyze the evolution of source code, software defects, and their co-evolution. These techniques support various maintenance tasks, such as system restructuring, re- documentation, and identification of critical software components. 2. Predicting the future of a software system. We present four analysis techniques aimed at anticipating the locations of future defects, and investigating the impact of certain source code properties on the presence of defects. They support two maintenance tasks: defect prediction and software quality analysis. By creating our framework and the mentioned techniques on top of it, we provide evidence that an integrated view of software evolution, combining source code and software defects information, supports an extensible set of software maintenance tasks...|$|R
