5|$|Rather than {{resume his}} medical {{practice}} in Adelaide, Burston chose {{to remain in}} Melbourne. In 1950, he delivered the Rupert Downes Memorial Lecture based on his book on Medical Aspects of Atomic Warfare. Burston served as director of several companies, including David Syme & Co. (the publisher of The Age newspaper), Western Mining Corporation, Great Western Consolidated, New Coolgardie, and Koolgardie Southern. He was a <b>medical</b> <b>advisor</b> to the Australian Red Cross and National Mutual Life Association.|$|E
5|$|An Associate Professor of Radiology at the University of Rochester School of Medicine, Stafford L. Warren, was {{commissioned}} as a {{colonel in the}} United States Army Medical Corps, and appointed as chief of the MED's Medical Section and Groves' <b>medical</b> <b>advisor.</b> Warren's initial task was to staff hospitals at Oak Ridge, Richland and Los Alamos. The Medical Section was responsible for medical research, {{but also for the}} MED's health and safety programs. This presented an enormous challenge, because workers were handling a variety of toxic chemicals, using hazardous liquids and gases under high pressures, working with high voltages, and performing experiments involving explosives, not to mention the largely unknown dangers presented by radioactivity and handling fissile materials. Yet in December 1945, the National Safety Council presented the Manhattan Project with the Award of Honor for Distinguished Service to Safety in recognition of its safety record. Between January 1943 and June 1945, there were 62 fatalities and 3,879 disabling injuries, which was about 62 percent below the rate of private industry.|$|E

40|$|This {{pilot study}} {{examined}} how closely general practitioners and employment <b>medical</b> <b>advisors</b> agreed when jointly investigating occupational dermatitis. The criterion for admitting {{a patient to}} the study was dermatitis on one or both hands. This presented most commonly among men aged 41 - 60 years and women aged 21 - 40 years. There was some reluctance among general practitioners {{to take part in}} the study, probably owing to the medico-legal problems associated with this condition. General practitioners and employment <b>medical</b> <b>advisors</b> were equally likely to attribute a case of dermatitis to occupational factors if the patient was employed in industry; but if the patient was in nonindustrial employment, general practitioners were more likely to consider the possibility of an occupational origin than employment <b>medical</b> <b>advisors.</b> These differences suggest that before initiating a wider study more information is required concerning the trigger mechanisms for dermatitis on the hands in order to reduce the diagnostic variability...|$|R

25|$|The {{match was}} played at Fenner's. Despite being badly hit by illness, Australia won inside two days, for their largest victory on tour. Hugh Trumble played his first match on tour after {{recovering}} from an injured thumb, {{and took the}} first four wickets of the game, as Cambridge University were bowled out for 108. The Australians, who included their <b>medical</b> <b>advisor,</b> Rowley Pope, who had not played first class cricket since 1891, replied with 337, of which Trumper made 128, and Hopkins then took seven for 10 as the students were all out for 46.|$|E

Lehman and Ommaya became friends when he cared for his daughter. They had many discussions focusing on the need for a center that emphasized injury prevention and research. Lehman, then chair of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Transportation, was responsible for the initial $10 million awarded to the CDC to establish a new Center for Injury Control. The FY 2008 budget for the center is $134 Million, and it funds basic and applied injury research. Ommaya served on the National Advisory Committee for the Center for 15 years.|$|E
500|$|Warren was duly {{commissioned}} as {{a colonel}} in the United States Army Medical Corps on November 3, 1943. He was appointed as chief of the MED's medical section and <b>medical</b> <b>advisor</b> {{to the director of}} the Manhattan Project, with Friedell as his deputy. Warren's office was initially located in New York City but moved to Oak Ridge, Tennessee soon after. Warren's initial task was to staff hospitals at Oak Ridge, Richland, Washington and Los Alamos, New Mexico. Warren's section was responsible for medical research, but also for the MED's health and safety programs. This presented an enormous challenge, because workers were handling a variety of toxic chemicals, using [...] hazardous liquids and gases under high pressures, working with high voltages used in novel ways, and performing experiments involving explosives, not to mention the largely unknown dangers presented by radioactivity and handling fissile materials. Yet in December 1945, the National Safety Council presented the Manhattan Project with the Award of Honor for Distinguished Service to Safety in recognition of its safety record. Between January 1943 and June 1945, there were 62 fatalities and 3,879 disabling injuries, which was about 62 percent below that of private industry.|$|E
500|$|To ensure {{accuracy}} in scriptwriting, the serial employs {{a team of}} researchers to advise writers on nursing issues and health service politics. One <b>medical</b> <b>advisor</b> was given a cameo role in the series as an orthopaedic surgeon, and another, recovery nurse Rachel Carter, appears in Holby City as a scrub nurse. Another adviser, a heart surgeon, has occasionally left open-heart surgery to advise Holby City writers over the telephone. The programme utilises surgeons from different disciplines, who check scripts for accuracy. Carter believes this is particularly important in case viewers copy procedures they have seen in the show, such as CPR. Series star Amanda Mealing commented: [...] "We pride ourselves on being realistic. You need to know what you are doing and why. It is a complex and foreign thing to act out an operation. For training, I watched a number of real ones." [...] Cast members are taught how to give realistic injections, monitor blood pressure and check a pulse, and some are given the opportunity to observe procedures in real hospitals. Original cast member George Irving observed coronary artery bypass surgery performed at Papworth and Middlesex Hospital in preparation for his role as Anton Meyer, while Edward MacLiam observed laparoscopic surgery being performed before joining the cast as Greg Douglas in series twelve.|$|E

500|$|Parsons {{witnessed}} the first explosion, Able, {{from the deck}} of the task force flagship, the command ship [...] An airburst like the Hiroshima blast, it was unimpressive, and even Parsons thought that it must have been smaller than the Hiroshima bomb. It failed to sink the target ship, the battleship , mainly because it missed it by a considerable distance. This made it difficult to assess the amount of damage caused, which was the objective of the exercise. Blandy then announced that the next test, Baker, would occur in just three weeks. This meant that Parsons had to carry out the evaluation of Able simultaneously with the preparations for Baker. This time he assisted with the final preparations on [...] before heading back to seaplane tender [...] for the test. The underwater Baker explosion was no larger than Able, but the dome and water column made it look far more spectacular. The real problem was the radioactive fallout, as Colonel Stafford L. Warren, the Manhattan Project's <b>medical</b> <b>advisor,</b> had predicted. The target ships proved impossible to decontaminate and, lacking targets, the test series had to be called off. For his part in Operation Crossroads, Parsons was awarded the Legion of Merit.|$|E
