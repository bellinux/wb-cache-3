40|$|Abstract—Accurate {{measurement}} of {{blood pressure is}} essential to classify individuals, to ascertain blood pressure–related risk, and to guide management. The auscultatory technique with a trained observer and mercury sphygmomanometer {{continues to be the}} method of choice for <b>measurement</b> in the <b>office,</b> using the first and fifth phases of the Korotkoff sounds, including in pregnant women. The use of mercury is declining, and alternatives are needed. Aneroid devices are suitable, but they require frequent calibration. Hybrid devices that use electronic transducers instead of mercury have promise. The oscillometric method can be used for <b>office</b> <b>measurement,</b> but only devices independently validated according to standard protocols should be used, and individual calibration is recommended. They have the advantage of being able to take multiple measurements. Proper training of observers, positioning of the patient, and selection of cuff size are all essential. It is increasingly recognized that <b>office</b> <b>measurements</b> correlate poorly with blood pressure measured in other settings, and that they can be supplemented by self-measured readings taken with validated devices at home. There is increasing evidence that home readings predict cardiovascular events and are particularly useful for monitoring the effects of treatment. Twenty-four-hour ambulatory monitoring gives a better prediction of risk than <b>office</b> <b>measurements</b> and is useful for diagnosing white-coat hypertension. There is increasing evidence that a failure of blood pressure to fall during the night may be associated with increased risk. In obese patients and children, the use of an appropriate cuff size is of paramount importance. (Hypertension. 2005; 45 : 142 - 161. ...|$|R

40|$|Office blood {{pressure}} measurement {{has been the}} basis for hypertension evaluation for almost a century. However, the evaluation of {{blood pressure}} {{out of the office}} using ambulatory or self-home monitoring is now strongly recommended for the accurate diagnosis in many, if not all, cases with suspected hypertension. Moreover, there is evidence that the variability of blood pressure might offer prognostic information that is independent of the average blood pressure level. Recently, advancement in technology has provided noninvasive evaluation of central (aortic) blood pressure, which might have attributes that are additive to the conventional brachial blood pressure measurement.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To provide updated, {{evidence-based}} {{recommendations for}} the diagnosis and assessment of adults with hypertension. OPTIONS AND OUTCOMES: The diagnosis of hypertension is dependent on appropriate blood pressure measurement, the timely assessment of serially elevated readings, the degree of blood pressure elevation, the method of <b>measurement</b> (<b>office,</b> ambulatory, home) and associated comorbidities. The presence of cardiovascular risk factors and target organ damage should be ascertained to assess global cardiovascular risk and determine the urgency, intensity and type of treatment required. EVIDENCE: MEDLINE searches were conducted from November 2007 to October 2008 {{with the aid of}} a medical librarian. Reference lists were scanned, experts were contacted, and the personal files of authors and subgroup members were used to identify additional studies. Content and methodological experts assessed studies using prespecified, standardized evidence-based algorithms. Recommendations were based on evidence from peer-reviewed full-text articles only. RECOMMENDATIONS: Recommendations for blood pressure measurement, criteria for hypertension diagnosis and follow-up, assessment of global cardiovascular risk, diagnostic testing, diagnosis of renovascular and endocrine causes of hypertension, home and ambulatory monitoring, and the use of echocardiography in hypertensive individuals are outlined. Key messages include continued emphasis on the expedited, accurate diagnosis of hypertension, the importance of global risk assessment and the need for ongoing monitoring of hypertensive patients to identify incident type 2 diabetes. VALIDATION: All recommendations were graded according to strength of the evidence and voted on by the 57 members of the Canadian Hypertension Education Program Evidence-Based Recommendations Task Force.

40|$|This is the post-print {{version of}} the Article. The {{published}} version can be accessed from the link below - Copyright @ 2011 IETThis study presents an H-shaped reconfigurable antenna for wireless applications. The antenna consists of an H-shape radiator and a CPW printed on a circuit board and a varactor diode connecting {{the upper and lower}} arms of the H-shape radiator for reconfigurability. The uniqueness of the antenna lies on the ability to select the operating mode and frequencies electronically using a varactor diode. By selecting the DC-bias voltages of 11. 5, 10 and 8 V across the varactor diode, which in turn selects the corresponding varactor capacitances of 2, 4 and 6 pF, the antenna can be controlled to operate in three different modes, namely a single-band mode to cover the GSM 1900, a dual-band mode at 1. 88 and 2. 4 GHz to cover the GSM 1900 and Bluetooth/WLAN, respectively and a tri-band mode at 1. 57, 1. 88 and 2. 4 GHz to cover the GSM 1900, WLAN and GPS, respectively. Furthermore, by varying the varactor capacitance from 7 to 13 pF, the GPS and WLAN bands can be tuned by 11. 44 % (1. 57 - 1. 4 GHz) and 6. 46 % (2. 4 - 2. 25 GHz), respectively, yet keeping the 1. 88 -GHz band unchanged.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: People of South Asian, African-Caribbean and Irish {{ethnicity}} {{are known}} to have worse cardiovascular outcomes than those from the white British group. While the reasons underpinning this are complex, the effect of hypertension is both significant and modifiable. In recent years, there has been increasing interest in and uptake of 'out-of-office' methods for blood pressure (BP) monitoring. However, guidance in this area has been largely based on research among the white population. This study aims to answer the following questions: (1) How often and in what ways does blood pressure (BP) monitoring occur and how does this differ between white and the above minority ethnic populations. (2) Are the thresholds for diagnosis of hypertension, and treatment targets in hypertension comparable for white British and minority ethnic populations using different measurement modalities: office blood pressure, ambulatory BP monitoring and home monitoring? (3) What preferences for BP measurement do people from white and minority ethnic populations have? METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A mixed methods approach will be used including the following: (1) A postal survey sent to 8000 hypertensive and not-known-to-be-hypertensive people from all four ethnic groups will determine current patterns of BP monitoring. (2) A validation study will compare BP measurement by ambulatory monitoring with office standard <b>measurement,</b> <b>office</b> research measurement and home monitoring in 200 people from each of the ethnic groups concerned. (3) Focus groups organised by ethnicity and gender will gather qualitative data regarding patient preferences for and experiences of BP measurement in each of the given modalities. The data collected from these phases will be analysed appropriately in order to answer the above research questions.

The direct photon signal was extracted for the transverse momentum range of 4 GeV/c < pT < 22 GeV/c, using a statistical method to subtract decay photons from the inclusive photon sample. The direct photon nuclear modification factor R-AA was calculated {{as a function of}} p(T) for different Au + Au collision centralities using the measured p + p direct photon spectrum and compared to theoretical predictions. R-AA was found to be consistent with unity for all centralities over the entire measured pT range. Theoretical models that account for modifications of initial direct photon production due to modified parton distribution functions in Au and the different isospin composition of the nuclei predict a modest change of R-AA from unity. They are consistent with the data. Models with compensating effects of the quark-gluon plasma on high-energy photons, such as suppression of jet-fragmentation photons and induced-photon bremsstrahlung from partons traversing the medium, are also consistent with this <b>measurement.</b> <b>Office</b> of Nuclear Physics in the Office of Science of the Department of EnergyNational Science FoundationAbilene Christian University Research CouncilResearch Foundation of SUNYDean of the College of Arts and Sciences, Vanderbilt University (USA) Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and TechnologyJapan Society for the Promotion of Science (Japan) Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (Brazil) Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (Brazil) Natural Science Foundation of China (P.
