25|$|<b>Musette</b> is a {{style of}} French music and dance that became popular in Paris in the 1880s. <b>Musette</b> uses the {{accordion}} as main instrument, and often symbolizes the French art of living abroad.

In 2001, the musette-style was a huge international success through the album Amélie composed by Yann Tiersen.|$|E

5000|$|The {{composer}} Joseph Boismortier was counted {{among his}} friends. Naudot's most widely available work is his flute concerto opus 17, number 5. His other works include [...] "babioles" [...] (baubles, trifles, toys) published about 1750. These are easy duets, {{described as being}} suitable for vielles (hurdy-gurdies) and <b>musettes</b> (bagpipes). The word [...] "babiole" [...] has not caught on in music circles, and later composers preferred the word Divertimento.|$|R
25|$|Nicolas Chédeville {{was born}} in Serez, Normandy; musicians Pierre Chédeville (1694–1725) and Esprit Philippe Chédeville (1696–1762) were his brothers. Louis Hotteterre was his great uncle and godfather, and may have given him {{instruction}} in music and turning instruments. He began playing the oboe and <b>musette</b> (a bagpipe-like instrument commonly used in French baroque music) in the Paris Opera orchestra in the 1720s. After Jean Hotteterre's death in 1732, he took over his post in Les Grands Hautbois, the royal oboe band. He retired from the opera in July 1748, though returned occasionally to play the <b>musette</b> there. When he was nearly 70, he married the younger daughter of a valet who had once worked for the Duc d'Orléans, and was still describing himself as <b>musette</b> player to the king. In his last years he experienced financial difficulties. His ten houses were signed over to creditors in 1774, following which he separated from his wife. He resigned from Les Grands Hautbois in 1777, petitioned for bankruptcy in 1778 and died in Paris four years later. Lawyers were still trying to settle his affairs in 1790.|$|E
25|$|His {{interest}} in Italian music {{led to his}} receiving, in August 1739, a privilege to publish arrangements for the <b>musette,</b> hurdy-gurdy or flute of concertos and sonatas by ten specific Italian composers, in addition to Johann Joachim Quantz and Antoine Mahaut. Le printems, ou Les saisons amusantes (1739) is a particularly amusing result of this privilege; it is an arrangement of Vivaldi's The Four Seasons for hurdy-gurdy or <b>musette,</b> violin, and flute (though the French flute could also mean the recorder). He replaced Vivaldi's original Summer with his op. 8 no. 9 concerto, transferred the middle movement of Winter to Autumn, and replaced Winter op. 8 no. 12. All this was quite freely arranged and combined with some added Vivaldian material by Chédeville.|$|E

2500|$|The {{composer}} Joseph Boismortier was counted {{among his}} friends. Naudot's most widely available work is his concerto op. [...] XVII,5, originally written for Danguy l'aîné (a parisian hurdy-gurdy virtuoso). His other works include [...] "babioles" [...] (baubles, trifles, toys) published about 1750. These are duets, {{described as being}} suitable for vielles (hurdy-gurdies) and <b>musettes</b> (bagpipes). The word [...] "babiole" [...] has not caught on in music circles, and later composers preferred the word Divertimento.|$|R

When this has been done, she returns home. She expects guests but cannot entertain them {{in any other way}} than by receiving them in the courtyard. Here the Bohemians, who arrive in large numbers, celebrate joyously. The neighbours, awakened from sleep, protest in vain and the scene ends in a general fight between the two factions.|$|R
50|$|The {{earliest}} <b>musettes</b> had up to nine coulisses {{and twelve}} layettes, {{so that you}} could play music in a range of modes and always have a drone using the home-note of the mode. As the chalumeaux developed and became fully chromatic, so it became possible to play music in different modes but starting on the same note; fewer possible drone-notes were needed, and the bourdon was simplified. Even so, the bourdon still contains four or more separate reeds that have to be kept adjusted and in tune.|$|R
25|$|In 1737 he made {{a secret}} {{agreement}} with Jean-Noël Marchand to publish a collection of his own compositions as Antonio Vivaldi's op. 13, entitled Il pastor fido. Chédeville supplied the money and received the profits, all of which was attested to in a notarial act by Marchand in 1749. This {{may have been an}} attempt to give his instrument, the <b>musette,</b> the endorsement of a great composer which it lacked.|$|E
25|$|The {{festival of}} Saint Jean, {{taking place in}} late June for five days (from Friday to Tuesday) {{annually}} attracts many people, and allows the animation of the entire town, thanks to the many events offered. Fireworks, concerts in {{all corners of the}} town, disco entertainment or <b>musette</b> following into the evening, many rides for children or excitement for those bigger, with activities offered by different associations, such as horse races or the demonstration by the firefighters of the plateau. This annual festival is launched with the famous fire of Saint Jean, which takes place in a different area each year.|$|E
25|$|His first {{published}} works were collections of pieces for <b>musette</b> or hurdy-gurdy, entitled Amusements champêtres (pastoral amusements), published in December 1729. He called himself 'Chedeville le jeune', and in later compositions referred {{to himself as}} 'Chedeville le cadet'. Another collection of Amusements champêtres followed, which were of a more advanced technical and musical substance. Some variety was found in op. 6, with pieces named after battles and expressing 'war-like images'; it {{was inspired by a}} military campaign he had gone on with the Prince of Conti. He turned briefly to more serious music with Italian influences in op. 7, which is his only collection written specifically for the flute, oboe or violin.|$|E
2500|$|Dance music: the danced interludes, {{which were}} {{obligatory}} even in tragédie en musique, allowed Rameau to give free rein to his inimitable sense of rhythm, melody, and choreography, acknowledged by all his contemporaries, including the dancers themselves.

Returning home, she is confronted by Rodolphe. She admits having worked in secret for him. He initially forgives her, until he finds out that she went out with Vicomte Paul and jumps to the conclusion she got the money from him. He hits her, but soon apologizes when he discovers she is very sick.|$|R
