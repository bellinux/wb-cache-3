The measured acceleration value is displayed in real time, moreover the actual value is stored for furthe offline processing on PC. The ADXL 320 module {{acts as a}} main sensor and two LED screens displays the actual value. The recorded data are transferred to permanent memory EEPROM. The entire device is operated by Atmel ATmega 8 <b>microprocessing</b> <b>unit</b> which is connected to PC by common RS 232 serial line. Further in the thesis there's presented suggestion of the final solution of the problem...|$|E
40|$|ISBN: 044486282 XA global fault-model of a <b>microprocessing</b> <b>unit</b> is presented. Fault {{hypothesis}} {{for both}} the data processing section and the control section are given, followed by the appropriate test methods. Functional testing of the control section is then performed rigorously, with strong hypotheses. General test procedures are determined {{as a function of}} the error consequences on the sequencing of the programs. The aim is mainly on-line on-current testing but a rearrangement could be made in order to fit for off-line testing. All procedures needed for on-line testing of the M 6800 have been studied and may be found in ibid., Rapport de Recherche IMAG, RR 203, 1980...|$|E
40|$|The {{need for}} rapid {{assessment}} {{of the state of}} critical and conventional civil structures such as bridges, control centers, airports, hospitals among many, has been amply demonstrated during recent natural disasters. This paper presents the overall framework of structural damage monitoring systems and summarizes current research efforts in the field. Such systems incorporate a sensing and <b>microprocessing</b> <b>unit,</b> data transmission and acquisition system, and damage diagnostic methods. Current advances in wireless communication, micromachined sensors, global positioning systems, and increased computational power provide the tools for potential new solution to many of the obstacles presented by such systems. Issues of communication, power requirements, data transmission, and damage analysis algorithms are addressed in the paper...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} a design and {{implementation}} of a <b>microprocessing</b> control <b>unit</b> {{which can be used}} e. g. for controlling a hydraulic loading crane. This multi-purpose control device contains commonly available computer peripheral components such as a serial line, a USB connection or Bluetooth. When specific sensors are added to this device it can be used for measurements as well as for adjustments. This device also enables to store measured data on an SD/MMC card...|$|R
