2500|$|A {{few weeks}} before Creighton's consecration as bishop at Westminster Abbey in late April 1891, he fell ill with <b>muscular</b> <b>rheumatism.</b> [...] Soon after his enthronement at Peterborough Cathedral in mid-May 1891, he fell ill again, this time with influenza. [...] Each time, the {{recovery}} was prolonged. [...] The Peterborough diocese, then comprising 676 parishes and including Leicester and Northampton, offered a vast ecclesiastical challenge. [...] Creighton met it in the manner he had employed in Embleton: he proceeded to visit every corner. [...] Travelling by train to distant parishes, staying overnight with the parish priests, and conducting services in their churches, Creighton spent very little time {{at home with his}} family during the first year. [...] However, his immersion among the clergy, treatment of them as equals, and dispatch in attending to their concerns, gradually increased his popularity. [...] The experience also helped him to work out his doctrinal stance. [...] Although he was personally liberal, he came firmly to believe that to be English was to be Anglican, and led him to regard dissenters as having lost their way, and Roman Catholics as disloyal.|$|E

40|$|Cimicifuga racemosa (black cohosh) is a {{herbaceous}} perennial plant, {{that has}} been traditionally used {{for a variety of}} ailments (dyspepsia, climacteric complaints, <b>muscular</b> <b>rheumatisms,</b> menstrual cramps). From laboratory and clinical studies, black cohosh seems to have a relatively good safety profile, even if a number of case reports of hepatotoxicity were a matter of recent concern. Aim: A number of case reports indicated that C. racemosa could induce hepatotoxicity. We evaluated the effects of black cohosh extract on liver morphology, and on levels of various hepatic function indices in rats. Methods: Wistar rats received 300 mg/kg/day of C. racemosa extract by gavage, for 30 days. Biochemical analysis of serum was conducted by an automated, random-access clinical chemistry analyzer. Liver samples were used for hystomorphological and immunohistochemical examination, for the detection of apoptosis (TUNEL assay), and for the determination of GSH level (spectrophotometrical analysis). Results: C. racemosa extract does not affect liver morphology and hepatic function indices, in rats. Conclusions: On the basis of experimental data, the use of 300 mg/kg/day of black cohosh appears quite safe in rats. Nevertheless, in humans the safety of C. racemosa should be further monitored, in terms of patient-related factors. (C) 2008 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved...|$|R

50|$|Psychotria poeppigiana {{has several}} uses in folk medicine; {{it is widely}} used as a {{painkiller}} besides having some more specialized applications. The Tiriyó of Surinam crush and boil the plant and use the resulting decoction to treat headaches, sprains, <b>rheumatism,</b> <b>muscular</b> pains and bruises. The Wayana, also of Surinam, grind the bark and apply it raw to a particular rash known to them as poispoisi. The bracts are crushed to release the sap, which is then applied into the ear canal to relieve earaches. The decoction from the inflorescence, boiled whole, is credited with antitussive qualities and used as a whooping cough remedy and more generally to treat respiratory tract infections, as are decoctions of the leaves of ssp. barcellana.|$|R

After the Great War, many ex-officers found that the rise in the cost of living in London precluded maintaining the style of life of a gentleman to which they had become accustomed; some looked beyond England. In 1922, the Mercers emigrated to France, where it was possible to live more cheaply, and where the climate was kinder to Mercer’s <b>muscular</b> <b>rheumatism.</b>|$|E

Her response was, [...] "Then blind I shall be—but I want something in my head to think about." [...] She graduated from University of Minnesota in 1913, still able to see, and began teaching chemistry at rural high schools. In 1915, Henrietta returned to Minneapolis to teach at Central High School and live with her sister. In Minneapolis, Henrietta attended the First Baptist Church where she was encouraged to apply educational standards to Sunday School programs. After teaching Sunday School for over a decade, in 1927, Henrietta took a sabbatical to California.

40|$|About 3. 7 million Americans have {{fibromyalgia}} (pronounced fie-bro-my-al-jia). It {{is one of}} {{the most}} common pain syndromes, and the second most common disorder seen by rheumatologists. It is most often seen in those ages 20 - 55. Women are ten times more likely than men to have it, but it can even effect children ("Personal Guide", 1997, p. 6). Sometimes more than one family member has it, but a herititary link has not been proven. Fibromyalgia is not a new condition. It was first described in the early 1800 s. Physicians then recognized and wrote about a condition they called <b>muscular</b> <b>rheumatism,</b> and described the signs and symptoms of what we now call fibromyalgia. It has also been called chronic rheumatism, myalgia, and fibrositis. Some in the medical profession thought, and may still think, that it is psychological in nature. In 1824, tender points were described by a doctor in Edinburgh. In 1880, a doctor described the same condition and then called it neurasthenia.

But we have {{naturally}} speculated among ourselves, {{and we have}} asked ourselves the following questions:— (1) Does the essential aetiology of fibrositis lie within the bone? (2) Does the marrow of the metaphysis of bone play a more important part and active part in the metabolism of the body than has been hitherto recognised? (3) Are the generally accepted symptoms and signs of fibrositis merely external manifestations of some disease whose true site does not lie where the symptoms are felt and the indefinite signs detected? (4) Are these symptoms and signs indications of some derangement of a normal physiological function or interplay between bone marrow and muscle? (5) Has this work pointed {{the way to the}} recognition of another sub-group of <b>muscular</b> <b>rheumatism?</b> The technique of this method is not difficult to acquire by starting with simple muscles such as the gluteal region, but since practical demonstra-tion is always more profitable preliminary arrangements have been made for demonstrating the technique by two of my collaborators—Mr. L.

40|$|Za period 1962 - 1965. god. analizirani su izostanci s posla u industriji u SR Hrvatskoj zbog odabrane grupe kroničnih bolesti: bronhijalne astme (šifra 241), šećerne bolesti (šifra 2 ti 0), psihoneuroza (šifra 310 - 318), arteriosklerotičnih i degenerativnih bolesti srca (šifra 420), hipertenzija (šifra 444 - 445), kroničnog bronhitisa (šifra 502), ulkusa želuca i dvanaestnika (šifra 540 - 542), kroničnog reumatizma (šifra 722 - 727) i posebno reumatizma mišića (šifra 726). Prikazane su stope izostanaka, odnosno dana bolovanja na broj uposlenih radnika, zatim učešće tih bolesti u ukupnom broju slučajeva izostanaka, odnosno dana bolovanja u odgovarajućim (njihovim) grupama bolesti (prema Međunarodnoj klasifikaciji bolesti iz 1965. god.), kao i odnos između izostanaka s posla zbog nabrojenih kroničnih bolesti prema ukupnom broju izostanaka s posla u industriji. Posebno su analizirani izostanci s posla zbog istih bolesti po pojedinim granama industrije u SR Hrvatskoj. Podaci su prikazani na ukupno 12 tablica. Analiza podataka upućuje na to da kronične bolesti zauzimaju sve značajnije mjesto u izostancima s posla. U nekim slučajevima može se pretpostaviti da njihova prevalencija i incidencija stoji dijelom u uzročno-posljedičnoj vezi s radom i radnim uvjetima. Ukazuje se na potrebu da se s više sistema prati i proučava morbiditet od kroničnih bolesti u radničkoj populaciji i ističe se značenje organizirane borbe s tim bolestima kao važnog uzroka izostanaka s posla i invalidnosti radnika. For {{the period}} 1962 - 1965 {{analysis}} {{was made of}} absences from work in industry in Croatia due to the following diseases: bronchial asthma (code 241), diabetes (260), psychoneuroses (310 - 318), arteriosclerotic and degenerative heart disorders (420), hypertension (444 - 445), chronic bronchitis (502), duodenal ulcus (540 - 542), and chronic rheumatism (722 - 727), with particular reference to <b>muscular</b> <b>rheumatism</b> (726). The absences {{and the number of}} days lost due to these diseases arc analysed by sex and industrial branches (branch 19 - codes 11 - 130). Data are presented as the rate of absences in relation to the number of the workers employed in the respective industrial branch. Although relating only to the causes of temporary work disability and a selected group of chronic degenerative diseases, these data indicate that the diseases analysed occupy an important place in the workers 2 ̆ 7 morbidity. This specially relates to some of them, e. g. psychoneuroses, duodenal and gastric ulcers, chronic bronchitis, and hypertension. The group of chronic rheumatism also plays an important role, but most absences and days lost in this group are due to muscular chronic rheumatism. The data analysed have also revealed some comparatively stable trends regarding the ratio of absences and days lost to the number of the workers employed. Some of the diseases analysed, e. g. arteriosclerotic and degenerative heart disorders, chronic bronchitis, duodenal and gastric ulcers, chronic rheumatism, and particularly its muscular form, are on the whole more frequent in men. Psychoneuroses and hypertension are, as a rule, more frequent in women. So is bronchial asthma (in 1963 and 1965), while diabetes is slightly more frequent in men than in women. The analysis of absences due to the above mentioned diseases according to industrial branches also shows certain specificities which are presented in tabular form and discussed in more detail. The data presented and the summarized analyses made clearly show the importance of an organized fight against chronic diseases as a very serious cause of absences and disability in workers. In addition to the need for a more systematic study of the morbidity due to these diseases in the workers 2 ̆ 7 populations, certain forms of health actions, specially that of the early detection of these diseases, have to be strongly emphasized. The etiology of chronic degenerative diseases connected with certain chronic progressive changes in individual organs and organic systems, is still unknown in a great many cases. Early diagnosis, by which systematic examinations of workers may play a very decisive role, still remains one o the principal, and most successful firms in the control and slowing down of the natural course of chronic degenerative diseases...|$|E
