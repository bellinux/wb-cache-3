First, the EU's choice of a specific trade defence measure – anti-dumping – was based on shaky arguments. Second, further trade disputes on green goods are very likely, in particular because China is increasingly implementing domestic support policies on green sectors, bringing down Chinese export prices. Third, trade defence measures could be adopted as an expensive option. Alternatively to this, the EU and China could consider setting up constructive and preventive mechanisms in order to stabilize trade and broaden their economic relationship. Policy relevance In July 2013 the EU accepted an undertaking by Chinese solar wafer, cell, and module manufacturers to fix <b>minimum</b> <b>import</b> <b>prices</b> for their products, along with a volume cap to be imposed on Chinese solar exports to the EU. In spite of the seemingly happy end of a trade dispute between the two {{major players in the}} renewables sector, we show that the possibility of trade disputes over low-carbon products in the near future cannot be ruled out. Drawing on the China–EU photovoltaic 'dumping case', we highlight some weaknesses in the EU's choice to resort to anti-dumping measures and emphasize the urgent need to invent new forms of trade dialogues between the EU and China as first-choice trade dispute settlement policies.

40|$|Nontariff {{barriers}} {{have become}} one of the key issues in agricultural trade policy and trade negotiations. Laws and regulations of a country, in addition to being directly protective, often give administrators wide leeway for interpretation which results in restrictive trade flows. The domestic agriculture of most developed countries is protected by {{one or more of the}} following: quantitative restrictions, licensing requirements, variable levies, export subsidies, <b>minimum</b> <b>import</b> <b>prices,</b> <b>import</b> calendars, state trading, mixing regulations, health and sanitary regulations, and standards and labelling. Ultimately, nontariff barriers must be negotiated like tariffs and other protective devices. Key words: agricultural trade, international trade policy, trade restriction. Agricultural trade negotiations have become increasingly complex. As the General Agree-ment on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) partici-pants prepared for the so-called Tokyo Round of negotiations after the U. S. Trade Act of 1974 was passed, it was evident that there were different forces at work and different players in the commercial policy game as compared to other rounds of bargaining since World War II (for a historical review, see Tontz). The complexity of this "new situa-tion " is due in large part to nontariff trade barriers originating from technology and the administrative bureaucracies, which have made commercial problems of the mid-twentieth century unique. Nontariff barrier problems, along with ag-ricultural policy issues, were pushed into the background during the Kennedy Round negotiations of 1962 - 67. There was an initial underestimation of the nature and level of the ultimate significance of such barriers to the countries involved. Moreover, a common ag-ricultural policy for the European Community was being evolved during that period. Not until after formal negotiations were completed did participants in the bargaining realize the real importance of the nontariff barrier issue...|$|R

By making cheap imports relatively more expensive than expensive <b>imports,</b> reference <b>prices</b> affect quality in three ways that appear not to have been analyzed before: 1) they can induce foreign firms to shift toward more expensive exports to the country with reference prices; 2) they can induce domestic producers in that country to shift production toward lower-quality, cheaper goods; and 3) because this decreases the relative price of the expensive varieties, domestic consumers may lean toward buying more expensive goods. Using the case of Uruguay, the authors estimate what protection the reference price procedures provide for Uruguayan industries and analyze how this protection affects Uruguay's economy.

This study investigates the relevance of the EPS per product and country of origin. We develop two indicators for the effectiveness of the EPS, which serve as variables in a cluster analysis identifying four classes differing in the relevance of the EPS. The relevance of the EPS is found to be heterogeneous among products as well as countries of origin. It is highest for artichokes, courgettes, cucumbers, lemons, plums and tomatoes. The influence of the EPS on apples, clementines and pears is significantly lower, and of least relevance for apricots, mandarins, oranges, peaches and nectarines and table grapes.

Our results suggest that the high relevance of the EPS for apples originating in China was of temporary nature, whereas the relevance of the EPS for pears originating in China is of a more general nature. In addition, the relevance of the EPS varies seasonally. Finally, we find that the production of pears in China is more competitive than the production of apples vis-à-vis the EU. Therefore, China's fresh fruit and vegetable (FFV) producers would benefit more from an improved EU market access for pears than for apples. Thus, China should put more effort in negotiating improved EU market access conditions for pears rather than for apples.

40|$|Although the WTO Agreement {{contained}} many {{provisions for}} 2 ̆ 018 special and differential 2 ̆ 019 treatment, {{it is now}} generally accepted that developing countries have yet received rather few real benefits from the Uruguay Round. The hunt is on {{to find ways to}} better address the needs of these countries in the new Round; some suggest the credibility and viability of the WTO itself is at stake. Several suggestions already exist about what further might be done. This paper proposes an additional step which might be taken in the agricultural field. Developing and transitional country governments have a need to protect their farmers (and, often, consumers) against external shocks, particular arising from world market price swings. Typically lacking fiscal resources, their only feasible approach to do this may be through the use of border measures to moderate price transmission to the domestic market. With non-tariff barriers and export subsidies now effectively removed from the choice set for most, what remains are variable tariffs, variable import subsidies and variable export taxes (and, to a limited extent, controls on export quantities). Many developing countries emerged from the Uruguay Round with bound tariffs quite high relative to applied tariffs. This gives them considerable 2 ̆ 018 room 2 ̆ 019 to vary the applied tariff as a domestic price stabilising measure. Some have formal policies in place to do so systematically. Others have done it on a more ad hoc basis. However, questions have been raised about the WTO-legality of such practices because the Agreement on Agriculture explicitly bans some types of variable tariffs (2 ̆ 018 variable import levies 2 ̆ 019 and 2 ̆ 018 <b>minimum</b> <b>import</b> <b>prices</b> 2 ̆ 019). The reality is that such 2 ̆ 018 banned 2 ̆ 019 schemes are still in operation in the EU and Japan, and some other existing forms of variable tariffs (e. g., 2 ̆ 018 seasonal 2 ̆ 019 tariffs) have not been challenged, and appear to be widely acceptable. It is concluded that clarification is needed about which types of variable tariff practices are to be allowed and which are not. Rather than opposing developing countries 2 ̆ 019 use of 2 ̆ 018 sliding scale 2 ̆ 019 tariff schemes and lamenting their high levels of tariff bindings, the OECD group could recognise these countries needs, not exaggerate the costs to themselves, and endorse the practice of varying the applied tariff as a stabilising measure for importcompeting agricultural producers and for consumers of the same commodities. As a 2 ̆ 018 special and differential 2 ̆ 019 concession, developing and transition countries could be allowed to retain tariff bindings at a level high enough to provide a capacity for using variable tariffs as a safety net measure. Conditions and incentives could be attached to ensure transparency, predictability, and a principally stabilising (not permanently protective) tariff use. Any new disciplines on export taxes or controls should take into consideration the logical linkage and be made consistent with such a concession...|$|R

40|$|The {{evolution}} of salmon trout farming in Finland provides an interesting {{example of how}} different trade policies can affect on the conditions of a small section of a primary industry in the global market. During the protectionist times in the 1980 s, Finland became the world-leading producer of salmon trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) (Saarni et al. 2003). During the global expansion of salmon aquaculture production and trade liberation, the Finnish fish farming industry faced fierce international competition. After Finland joined the European Union in 1995, the food industry was deregulated, and imported Norwegian salmon began to displace domestic salmon trout. In 1997, the import of salmon to the EU was restricted by the Salmon Agreement between the EU and Norway. At first, the <b>minimum</b> <b>import</b> <b>price</b> set for Norwegian salmon raised the import prices of salmon trout too, but it ultimately {{proved to be an}} even more serious problem for Finnish producers than that posed by free trade. After the world market price of salmonids dropped sharply in 2001, very inexpensive Norwegian salmon trout flooded the Finnish market, because salmon trout trade was not regulated in the agreement.

The hypothesis of this paper is that, in contrast to its complexity, the effectiveness of the EU import system for oranges is low with respect to its goals, i. e. protecting EU producers and creating imports from preference receiving countries. The comparison of import prices for oranges from extra-EU countries with the EU entry price shows that the former are about 40 % higher than the latter on average. Also, it is pointed out that at least 72 % of extra-EU orange imports during the EU harvest season enter the EU tariff free. As a conclusion, the contribution of the import regime to the protection of EU producers is low. Concordantly, the preferential entry price is not utilized by orange preference receiving countries. Besides, although orange quotas increased from 1991 to 2003, actual exports from Mediterranean countries and thus quota filling rates have decreased over the same period. It is shown that EU trade preferences for oranges were not decisive for the development of Mediterranean countries' orange exports to the EU. In the light of the low effectiveness of the entry price system for oranges along with high transaction costs involved, its abolishment should be considered. Yet, results cannot be generalized, even not for citrus fruit, as is demonstrated for mandarins. trade preferences, oranges, tariff rate quota, entry price, International Relations/Trade,...|$|E
40|$|On March 11, 1996, the Florida Fruit and Vegetable Association, the Florida Bell Pepper Growers Exchange, the Florida Farm Bureau, the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services {{and other}} U.

A second petition was filed with the U. S. Department of Commerce under Section 733 (a) of the U. S. Tariff Act of 1930, charging that Mexican tomatoes were being dumped on the U. S. market at prices less than fair market value (LTFV) and were the cause of material injury to the domestic industry. Florida growers blame their recent loss of market share and depressed prices during the 1995 - 96 winter season on NAFTA, the North American Free Trade Agreement. The reduction in trade barriers due to NAFTA allegedly resulted in a flood of Mexican tomato imports, which have depressed domestic prices and resulted in declining profits, employment and investments. These allegations constitute the legal criteria for a petition seeking economic relief from imports sold at less than fair market value. The ITC investigated the first petition and rejected it on July 2, 1996. The antidumping petition continued during the summer and fall, 1996, until trade negotiations resulted in a compromise agreement that suspended the investigation. On October 11, 1996, the U. S. and Mexican tomato growers reached an agreement suspending the dumping case and establishing a <b>minimum</b> <b>import</b> <b>price</b> for fresh tomatoes at $ 0. 2068 per pound ($ 0. 45 /kg) or $ 5. 17 per 25 -pound box.

Abstract 1 New Zealand and Australia have recently had large <b>import</b> <b>price</b> increases {{on the back}} of currency depreciations. Despite these large <b>import</b> <b>price</b> shocks, consumer prices have not risen as strongly as would be suggested by previously accepted relationships.

The data confirms that the estimated coefficients are smaller than previously thought: a 10 per cent increase in <b>import</b> <b>prices</b> will lead to a 0. 5 per cent increase in consumer prices within the first quarter, and to a 1. 5 per cent increase over the long-run. This result suggests that we should not necessarily expect the recent exchange rate depreciation to result in further consumer price increases. Similarly, if the exchange rate were to appreciate in the future, we should not expect large decreases in consumer prices as a direct result of the exchange rate appreciation. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper conducts {{specification}} {{tests to}} explore the dynamic relationship between the dollar and the U. S. terms of trade (TOT), {{as well as its}} components, U. S. <b>import</b> and export <b>prices.</b> Here <b>import</b> <b>prices</b> are found to respond to the dollar's value, but only after a substantial lag. Export prices display a somewhat weaker response that appears to partially offset the dollar's effect on <b>import</b> <b>prices,</b> muting its effect on the terms of trade. The result is a weak response in the terms of trade that mimics lags found in the dollar's pass-through into <b>import</b> <b>prices.</b> ...|$|R
50|$|Formally, exchange-rate {{pass-through}} is the {{elasticity of}} local-currency <b>import</b> <b>prices</b> {{with respect to}} the local-currency price of foreign currency, often measured as the percentage change, in the local currency, of <b>import</b> <b>prices</b> resulting from a one percent change in the exchange rate between the exporting and importing countries. A change in <b>import</b> <b>prices</b> affects retail and consumer prices. When exchange-rate pass-through is greater, there is more transmission of inflation between countries. Exchange-rate pass-through is also related to the law of one price and purchasing power parity.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the impact of}} exchange rates and <b>import</b> <b>prices</b> on the domestic PPI and CPI in selected industrialized economies. The empirical model is a VAR incorporating a distribution chain of pricing. Estimating the model over the post-Bretton Woods era, our results indicate that exchange rates have a modest effect on domestic <b>price</b> inflation while <b>import</b> <b>prices</b> have a stronger effect. Pass-through is larger and has a more prominent role in the inflation process in countries with a larger import share and more persistent exchange rates and <b>import</b> <b>prices.</b> ...|$|R
