40|$|A {{key element}} in {{developing}} high-performance planar solid oxide fuel-cell stacks is the hermetic seal between the metal and ceramic components. Two methods of sealing are commonly used: (a) rigid joining and (b) compressive sealing. Each method has {{its own set of}} advantages and design constraints. An alternative approach is currently under development that appears to combine some of the advantages of the other two techniques, including hermeticity, mechanical integrity, and minimization of interfacial stresses in the joint substrate materials, particularly the ceramic cell. The new sealing concept relies on a plastically deformable metal seal; one that offers a quasi-dynamic mechanical response in that <b>it</b> is <b>adherent</b> <b>to</b> both sealing surfaces, i. e., non-sliding, but readily yields or deforms under thermally generated stresses.

30|$|Religious economy theory {{consists}} of two parts: the supply-side theories focusing on religious regulation and competition {{as well as the}} productive capacity of congregations (Finke and Stark 1992), and the demand-side theories focusing on the preference dynamics and individual-level choices (Sherkat and Wilson 1995). The former indicates that religious groups or denominations develop two types of strategies to decrease the risk perceived by consumers. The first type is to endow formal membership and mobilize adherents as a community in order to produce religious service collectively. <b>It</b> requires <b>adherents</b> <b>to</b> input personal resources, such as time and money, formally and continuously. Religious attendance, doctrine studies, and personal connections are all built on and conditioned by salient denominational boundaries and formal memberships. The second type is the opposite. Religious groups separate production from consumption in order to make religious consumption informal and private. Neither the production of religious service nor the consumption of religious goods is constrained by membership (Iannaccone 1990, 1992, 1994). According to the typology given by Iannaccone (1990), institutional and congregational religions such as Christianity characterize the former type, while noninstitutional and nonexclusive religions like Daoism, Buddhism, and folk religions characterize the latter type.|$|R
30|$|Some {{risk factors}} like {{extremes}} of age, very {{high or low}} body mass index (BMI) and associated co-morbidities are common for all surgery. The specific risk factors for laparoscopic surgery include history of previous laparotomy, presence of adhesions, intra-operative technical difficulty, level of laparoscopic complexity, suspicion of malignancy, and surgeon’s experience [38]. To {{reduce the risk of}} entry-related complications, there is evidence-based advice [1]. However there is no single best method to avoid bowel injury when <b>it</b> is <b>adherent</b> <b>to</b> the abdominal wall.

The experience of the operating surgeon has been identified in many studies as an important modifying factor for risks associated with laparoscopy [20, 37, 38], so {{it goes without saying that}} the surgeon and their team performing laparoscopic surgery should have adequate training and be aware of preventative steps, early recognition and the appropriate management of complications. The importance of teamwork in laparoscopic surgery cannot be over-stressed. In principle, whenever a complication is identified that cannot be dealt with laparoscopically, there should be no delay in converting to an open laparotomy and seeking the help of appropriate colleagues from other specialities.|$|R
40|$|In {{this essay}} I examine the {{relation}} between religious non-realism and religious pluralism. Religious pluralism is celebrated by <b>it's</b> <b>adherents,</b> <b>to</b> be benevolent and tolerant towards other religions truth claims and practices. Religious non-realism is also, by its adherents, praised for its including way to look upon truth claims and differing opinions about reality. When it comes to questions like what there is and what is not, does God exist or does he not etc. the religious non-realist is prone to less dogmatism and definite answers than metaphysical realists. Or at least so does the non-realists themselves like to think. What I examine in this essay is whether religious non-realism pragmatically implies religious pluralism, or if a non-realist judiciously can dismiss religious pluralism and instead adopt a form of confessional view of a specifik religion. Religious exclusivism, like the one Alvin Plantinga defends, rejects the possibility of x being both true and false. If a religious claim is taken to be true then incompatible claims {{have to be considered}} false according to this view. This fits poorly whith religious non-realism since the latter does not embrace a correspondance theory of truth. Religious pluralism is strongly criticized, among others for leaving “God” or other religious entities empty and whithout characteristics or content. This, because if God is litterally indescribable and unreachable, we would {{have no reason to believe}} that God has the chatacteristics we think he has. If religious pluralism cannot answer to the criticism, and if non-realism can not help pluralism evade the problems, then we are in need of a religious inclusivism that does not depend on metaphysical realism. I propose, what I have called, a pragmatic non-realistic inclusivism as an answer to the problem. This is a non-realistic theory that evades metaphysical realism and reductionism of religion, but nevertheless can prefere one religion before others. Not because one religion is concidered to have metaphysical and objective truth while others do not, but because one could prefere a specific religious language and consider that religion to be the most adequate response to human lif...|$|R

BornAgain [1] is a free and open-source project that provides scientists with the means to simulate and fit their specular, off-specular and GISAS data within a single framework. The name of the software, BornAgain, indicates the central role of the distorted-wave Born approximation in the physical description of the scattering process. The software is capable of modeling multilayer samples with smooth or rough interfaces, various types of embedded nanoparticles and various models to treat finite size effects and the coupling between the type and position of a particle. In this way, it reproduces and enhances the functionality of the well known IsGISAXS software [2]. BornAgain goes beyond IsGISAXS by supporting an unrestricted number of layers and particles, the diffuse reflection from rough layer interfaces, particles with inner structures, neutron polarization and magnetic scattering. Carefully designed for a broad community of users, BornAgain offers a modern graphical user interface with the possibility to perform real-time simulations and to fit experimental data. An advanced Python API lets experienced users create complex models.

40|$|In {{skeletal}} {{muscles that}} have been damaged in ways which spare the basal lamina sheaths of the muscle fibers, new myofibers develop within the sheaths and neuromuscular junctions form at the original synaptic sites on them. At the regenerated neuromuscular junctions, as at the original ones, the muscle fibers are characterized by junctional folds and accumulations of acetylcholine receptors and acetylcholinesterase (AChE). The formation of junctional folds and the accumulation of acetylcholine receptors {{is known to be}} directed by components of the synaptic portion of the myofiber basal lamina. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine whether or not the synaptic basal lamina contains molecules that direct the accumulation of AChE. We crushed frog muscles in a way that caused disintegration and phagocytosis of all cells at the neuromuscular junction, and at the same time, we irreversibly blocked AChE activity. New muscle fibers were allowed to regenerate within the basal lamina sheaths of the original muscle fibers but reinnervation of the muscles was deliberately prevented. We then stained for AChE activity and searched the surface of the new muscle fibers for deposits of enzyme they had produced. Despite the absence of innervation, AChE preferentially accumulated at points where the plasma membrane of the new muscle fibers was apposed to the regions of the basal lamina that had occupied the synaptic cleft at the neuromuscular junctions. We therefore conclude that molecules stably attached to the synaptic portion of myofiber basal lamina direct the accumulation of AChE at the original synaptic sites in regenerating muscle.
