5|$|The {{complex of}} a rhodium ion with BINAP {{is a widely}} used chiral {{catalyst}} for chiral synthesis, as in the synthesis of <b>menthol.</b>|$|E
5|$|Another {{similarly}} colored Russula is R.nigricans, {{which can}} be distinguished from R.densifolia by its darker cap and widely spaced gills. Another lookalike, R.dissimulans, has a dry cap surface, and a mild taste. R.albonigra stains directly to black when injured, and has a taste reminiscent of <b>menthol.</b> R.densifolia is often confused with R.acrifolia, but the latter's gills do not change color when bruised. R.adusta, found with conifers, has a less acrid taste, and its cut flesh changes to light pink rather than red.|$|E
5|$|Even {{though most}} {{consumer}} items {{are in short}} supply in North Korea, there is a considerable variety of cigarettes available. In general, strong tobacco is preferred, and filters are rare. Western brands, particularly American, but also Chinese, Russian and Japanese are popular with the elite and preferred over domestic cigarettes. Foreign cigarettes and the domestic 727 brand, whose name stands for 27 July, the date of the Korean Armistice Agreement, are veritable status symbols. <b>Menthol</b> cigarettes are virtually non-existent, but there is competition among tobacco companies to introduce other attractive products, such as fruit-flavoured balls inside the filter to give the cigarette flavour.|$|E
5|$|The terpenoids, {{sometimes}} referred to as isoprenoids, are organic chemicals similar to terpenes, derived from five-carbon isoprene units. There are over 10,000 known types of terpenoids. Most are multicyclic structures which differ from one another in both functional groups, and in basic carbon skeletons. Monoterpenoids, continuing 2 isoprene units, are volatile essential oils such as citronella, limonene, <b>menthol,</b> camphor, and pinene. Diterpenoids, 4 isoprene units, are widely distributed in latex and resins, and can be quite toxic. Diterpenes are responsible for making Rhododendron leaves poisonous. Plant steroids and sterols are also produced from terpenoid precursors, including vitamin D, glycosides (such as digitalis) and saponins (which lyse red blood cells of herbivores).|$|E
25|$|<b>Menthol</b> is {{an organic}} {{compound}} made synthetically or obtained from corn mint, peppermint, or other mint oils. It is a waxy, crystalline substance, clear or white in color, which is solid {{at room temperature}} and melts slightly above. The main form of <b>menthol</b> occurring in nature is (−)-menthol, which is assigned the (1R,2S,5R) configuration. <b>Menthol</b> has local anesthetic and counterirritant qualities, and it is widely used to relieve minor throat irritation. <b>Menthol</b> also acts as a weak kappa opioid receptor agonist.|$|E
25|$|Menthol's {{analgesic}} {{properties are}} mediated through a selective activation of κ-opioid receptors. <b>Menthol</b> also blocks voltage-sensitive sodium channels, reducing neural activity that may stimulate muscles. A {{study showed that}} topical absorption of ibuprofen is not increased by <b>menthol,</b> but does note the complementary effect of the <b>menthol</b> as a pain reliever itself.|$|E
25|$|In organic chemistry, <b>menthol</b> {{is used as}} a chiral {{auxiliary}} in asymmetric synthesis. For example, sulfinate esters {{made from}} sulfinyl chlorides and <b>menthol</b> {{can be used to make}} enantiomerically pure sulfoxides by reaction with organolithium reagents or Grignard reagents. <b>Menthol</b> reacts with chiral carboxylic acids to give diastereomic menthyl esters, which are useful for chiral resolution.|$|E
25|$|Mentha arvensis is {{the primary}} species of mint used to make natural <b>menthol</b> {{crystals}} and natural <b>menthol</b> flakes. This species is primarily grown in the Uttar Pradesh region in India.|$|E
25|$|Some {{studies show}} that <b>menthol</b> acts as GABAA {{receptor}} positive allosteric modulator and increases GABAergic transmission in PAG neurons. <b>Menthol</b> also shares anaesthetic properties similar to propofol, by modulating same sites of GABAA receptor.|$|E
25|$|<b>Menthol</b> occurs {{naturally}} in peppermint oil (along {{with a little}} menthone, the ester menthyl acetate and other compounds), obtained from Mentha x piperita. Japanese <b>menthol</b> also contains {{a small percentage of}} the 1-epimer, neomenthol.|$|E
25|$|<b>Menthol</b> reacts in {{many ways}} like a normal {{secondary}} alcohol. It is oxidised to menthone by oxidising agents such as chromic acid or dichromate, though under some conditions the oxidation can go further and break open the ring. <b>Menthol</b> is easily dehydrated to give mainly 3-menthene, {{by the action of}} 2% sulfuric acid. Phosphorus pentachloride (PCl5) gives menthyl chloride.|$|E
25|$|In perfumery, <b>menthol</b> is used {{to prepare}} menthyl esters to {{emphasize}} floral notes (especially rose).|$|E
25|$|<b>Menthol</b> {{is widely}} used in dental care as a topical {{antibacterial}} agent, effective against several types of streptococci and lactobacilli.|$|E
25|$|As {{with many}} widely used natural products, {{the demand for}} <b>menthol</b> greatly exceeds the supply from natural sources. In the case of <b>menthol</b> it is also {{interesting}} to note that comparative analysis of the total life-cycle costs from a sustainability perspective has shown that production from natural sources actually results in consumption of more fossil fuel, produces more carbon dioxide effluent and has more environmental impact than either of the main synthetic production routes.|$|E
25|$|<b>Menthol,</b> either {{allowed to}} {{vaporize}} from crystal form or mixed into the grease patties, is also {{often used to}} treat acarine mites.|$|E
25|$|The town's {{largest and}} most {{prominent}} single employer is Lofthouse's of Fleetwood Ltd., manufacturers of Fisherman's Friend—a <b>menthol</b> lozenge popular worldwide and especially in Japan.|$|E
25|$|Today {{the main}} use of camphor is as a cough {{suppressant}} {{and as a}} decongestant. It is an active ingredient (along with <b>menthol)</b> in vapor-steam decongestant products, such as Vicks VapoRub.|$|E
25|$|Oral {{analgesic}} solutions, {{the active}} ingredient usually being phenol, but also less commonly benzocaine, cetylpyridinium chloride and/or <b>menthol.</b> Chloraseptic and Cēpacol are two examples of brands {{of these kinds of}} analgesics.|$|E
25|$|The two crystal {{forms for}} racemic <b>menthol</b> have melting points of 28°C and 38°C. Pure (−)-menthol has four crystal forms, {{of which the}} most stable is the α form, the {{familiar}} broad needles.|$|E
25|$|As {{a smoking}} tobacco {{additive}} in some cigarette brands, for flavor, {{and to reduce}} throat and sinus irritation caused by smoking. <b>Menthol</b> also increases nicotine receptor density, increasing the addictive potential of tobacco products.|$|E
25|$|The (+)- and (–)-enantiomers of <b>menthol</b> are {{the most}} stable among these based on their {{cyclohexane}} conformations. With the ring itself in a chair conformation, all three bulky groups can orient in equatorial positions.|$|E
25|$|Mouthwashes with {{essential}} oils are also useful. For example, American Dental Association approved plaque reducers and anti-inflammatory agents such as thymol, <b>menthol,</b> eucalyptol, and methyl salicylate are originally derived from thyme, mint, eucalyptus, and willow, respectively.|$|E
25|$|The {{biosynthesis}} of <b>menthol</b> {{has been}} investigated in M. x piperita and the enzymes involved in have been identified and characterized. It begins with the synthesis of the terpene limonene, followed by hydroxylation, and then several reduction and isomerization steps.|$|E
25|$|Another {{commercial}} {{process is}} the Haarmann-Reimer process. This process starts from m-cresol which is alkylated with propene to thymol. This compound is hydrogenated in the next step. Racemic <b>menthol</b> is isolated by fractional distillation. The enantiomers are separated by chiral resolution in reaction with methyl benzoate, selective crystallisation followed by hydrolysis.|$|E
25|$|Creamy snuffs are tobacco paste, {{consisting}} of tobacco, clove oil, glycerin, spearmint, <b>menthol,</b> and camphor, {{and sold in}} a toothpaste tube. It is marketed mainly to women in India, and is known by the brand names Ipco (made by Asha Industries), Denobac, Tona, and Ganesh. It is locally known as mishri {{in some parts of}} Maharashtra.|$|E
25|$|Initial {{treatment}} {{is similar to}} atrophic rhinitis, namely keeping the nasal mucosa moist with saline or oil-based lubricants and treating pain and infection as they arise; adding <b>menthol</b> to lubricants may be helpful in ENS, as may be use of a cool mist humidifer at home. For people with anxiety, depression, or who are obsessed with {{the feeling that they}} can't breathe, psychiatric or psychological care may be helpful.|$|E
25|$|Although the {{manufacturer}} {{claimed that the}} formula for Bile Beans {{was based on a}} vegetable source known only to Aboriginal Australians, its actual ingredients, which included cascara, rhubarb, liquorice and <b>menthol,</b> were commonly found in pharmacies of the period. A court case initiated in Scotland in 1905 found that the Bile Bean Manufacturing Company's business was based on a fraud and conducted fraudulently, but Bile Beans continued to be sold until the 1980s nevertheless.|$|E
25|$|Potassium {{dichromate}} is an {{oxidising agent}} in organic chemistry, and is milder than potassium permanganate. It {{is used to}} oxidize alcohols. It converts primary alcohols into aldehydes and, under more forcing conditions, into carboxylic acids. In contrast, potassium permanganate tends to give carboxylic acids as the sole products. Secondary alcohols are converted into ketones. For example, menthone may be prepared by oxidation of <b>menthol</b> with acidified dichromate. Tertiary alcohols cannot be oxidized.|$|E
25|$|In the Netherlands, {{liquorice}} confectionery (drop) {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular forms of sweets. It is sold in many forms. Mixing it with mint, <b>menthol,</b> aniseed, or laurel is quite popular. Mixing it with ammonium chloride (salmiak) is also popular. A popular liquorice in the Netherlands is known as zoute drop (salty liquorice), but contains very little salt, i.e., sodium chloride. The salty taste is due to ammonium chloride. Strong, salty sweets are also popular in Nordic countries.|$|E
25|$|Racemic <b>menthol</b> {{can also}} be formed by {{hydrogenation}} of pulegone. In both cases with further processing (crystallizative entrainment resolution of the menthyl benzoate conglomerate) {{it is possible to}} concentrate the L enantiomer, however this tends to be less efficient, although the higher processing costs may be offset by lower raw material costs. A further advantage of this process is that d-menthol becomes inexpensively available for use as a chiral auxiliary, along with the more usual l-antipode.|$|E
25|$|Rampur has {{a largely}} agriculture-based economy. It has very fertile land, but little industry, and {{virtually}} no mineral extraction. The main industries of Rampur are wine-making, sugar processing, textile weaving, and {{the manufacture of}} agricultural implements. An inoperative sugar mill still stands in Rampur; it was closed down in 1999 amidst political rivalry, but work has since begun on restarting the mill after state government approval. The major cash crop {{of the city is}} mentha, and <b>menthol</b> oil manufacturing also flourishes there.|$|E
25|$|After using toothpaste, {{orange juice}} and other juices have an {{unpleasant}} taste. Sodium lauryl sulfate alters taste perception. It can break down phospholipids that inhibit taste receptors for sweetness, giving food a bitter taste. In contrast, apples are known to taste more pleasant after using toothpaste. Distinguishing between the hypotheses that the bitter taste of orange juice results from stannous fluoride or from sodium lauryl sulfate is still an unresolved issue and {{it is thought that}} the <b>menthol</b> added for flavor may also take part in the alteration of taste perception when binding to lingual cold receptors.|$|E
500|$|The classic {{profile of}} Cabernet Sauvignon {{tends to be}} {{full-bodied}} wines with high tannins and noticeable acidity {{that contributes to the}} wine's aging potential. In cooler climates, Cabernet Sauvignon tends to produce wines with blackcurrant notes that can be accompanied by green bell pepper notes, mint and cedar which will all become more pronounced as the wine ages. In more moderate climates the blackcurrant notes are often seen with black cherry and black olive notes while in very hot climates the currant flavors can veer towards the over-ripe and [...] "jammy" [...] side. In parts of Australia, particularly the Coonawarra wine region of South Australia, Cabernet Sauvignon wines tend to have a characteristic eucalyptus or <b>menthol</b> notes.|$|E
500|$|The episode makes several {{references}} to {{popular culture and}} history. One of the opening scenes sees Principal Skinner knocking out {{a man in a}} very similar manner to Mick Dundee in Crocodile Dundee. The episode includes a scene based on Francis Ford Coppola's Apocalypse Now, where Lisa and Bob Hope escape the Fort Springfield stage. It also makes two {{references to}} Star Wars, where the caricature artist displays a caricature of Darth Vader and a montage shows Lisa with a double-bun hairdo like Princess Leia. The Springfield Waxworks' Chamber of Horrors contains Mr. T, Ronald Reagan and Dr. Ruth, and Laramie's mascot <b>Menthol</b> Moose is a parody of Joe Camel. Musically, Homer mournfully sings a song, [...] "Blimpy Boy", to the tune of The Seekers' [...] "Georgy Girl". Historically, there is a parody of the Hindenburg disaster, when the Duff Blimp crashes into the radio tower, to which Kent Brockman quotes [...] "Oh, the humanity!" [...] When Lisa is sworn in as Little Miss Springfield on her front lawn, Marge is to her left wearing a pink suit-dress in a pose similar to that of Jacqueline Kennedy in the famous photo of Lyndon B. Johnson being sworn in on Air Force One after John F. Kennedy's assassination.|$|E
