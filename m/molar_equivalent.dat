Results NHS ester of succinic monoester or carbonate of mPEG of 5, 000 Da was synthesized and reacted with excessive ethanolamine in dimethylformamide at 25 °C for 15 min. Residual ethanolamine was subsequently quantified by absorbance at 420 nm after reaction with 2, 4, 6 -trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS) at pH 9. 2 for 15 min at 55 °C followed by cooling with tap water. Reaction products of ethanolamine and NHS esters of mPEG caused no interference with TNBS assay of residual ethanolamine. Reaction between ethanolamine and NHS acetate ester follows 1 : 1 stoichiometry. By the new method, <b>molar</b> <b>equivalents</b> of NHS esters of carbonate and succinic monoester of mPEG in their preparations were about 90 % and 60 % of their theoretical values, respectively. During storage at 37 °C in humid air, the new method detected spontaneous hydrolyses {{of the two}} NHS esters of mPEG more sensitively than the classical spectrophotometric method based on absorbance at 260 nm of NHS released by reaction with ammonia in aqueous solution.

The three component synthesis of the direct etonitazene precursor, 2-(4-Ethoxybenzyl)-5-nitro-1H-benzoimidazole, consists of a 2-Bromo- or 2-Iodo-5-nitro-phenylamine (1.0 <b>molar</b> <b>equivalent),</b> a 4-substituted benzaldehyde (1.2 equiv), and sodium azide (2 equiv). The 2-Halo-5-nitro-phenylamine requires a bromo or iodo group for optimal activity. 2-Chloro-phenylamines are completely unreactive. In addition to these three components, the reaction was optimized in the presence of 0.05 molar equivalents (5 mol%) of a catalyst, copper(I) chloride, and 5 mol% of ligand, TMEDA (tetramethylethylenediamine). After heating these components at 120 °C for 12 hours in DMSO, the direct etonitazene precursor, 2-(4-Ethoxybenzyl)-5-nitro-1H-benzoimidazole, was formed in an approx 80-90% yield. The secondary amine nitrogen of 2-(4-Ethoxybenzyl)-5-nitro-1H-benzoimidazole was then alkylated with (2-Chloroethyl)diethylamine to form etonitazene. A diagram of this synthesis is shown below.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Candida {{antarctica}} lipase is inactivated in a mix-ture {{of vegetable}} oil {{and more than}} 1 : 2 <b>molar</b> <b>equivalent</b> of methanol against the total fatty acids. We have revealed that the inactivation was eliminated by three successive additions of 1 : 3 <b>molar</b> <b>equivalent</b> of methanol and have developed a three-step methanolysis by which over 95 % of the oil triacylglycerols (TAG) were converted to their corresponding methyl esters (ME). In this study, the lipase was not inactivated even though 2 : 3 <b>molar</b> <b>equivalent</b> of methanol was present {{in a mixture of}} acylglycerols (AG) and 33 % ME (AG/ME 33). This finding led to a two-step methanolysis of the oil TAG: The first-step was conducted at 30 °C for 12 h with shaking in a mixture of the oil, 1 : 3 <b>molar</b> <b>equivalent</b> of methanol, and 4 % immobilized lipase; the second-step reac-tion was done for 24 h after adding 2 : 3 <b>molar</b> <b>equivalent</b> of methanol (36 h in total). The two-step methanolysis achieved more than 95 % of conversion. When two-step reaction was re-peated by transferring the immobilized lipase to a fresh substrate mixture, the enzyme could be used 70 cycles (105 d) without any decrease in the conversion. From the viewpoint of the industrial production of biodiesel fuel production, the two-step reaction was conducted using a reactor with impeller. However, the en-zyme carrier was easily destroyed, and the lipase could be used only several times. Thus, we attempted flow reaction using a col-umn packed with immobilized Candida lipase. Because the li-pase packed in the column was drastically inactivated by feeding a mixture of AG/ME 33 and 2 : 3 <b>molar</b> <b>equivalent</b> of methanol, three-step flow reaction was performed using three columns packed with 3. 0 g immobilized lipase. A mixture of vegetable oil and 1 : 3 <b>molar</b> <b>equivalent</b> of methanol was fed into the first col-umn at a constant flow rate of 6. 0 mL/h. The eluate and 1 : 3 <b>molar</b> <b>equivalent</b> of methanol were mixed and then fed into the second column at the same flow rate. The final step reaction was done by feeding a mixture of eluate from the second column and 1 : 3 <b>molar</b> <b>equivalent</b> of methanol at the same flow rate. The ME con-tent in the final-step eluate reached 93 %, and the lipase could be used for 100 d without any decrease in the conversion...|$|E
