5|$|Following the <b>Mexican</b> Revolution, the new {{government}} began persecuting the Church. To destroy the Church's influence over the <b>Mexican</b> people, anti-clerical statutes were inserted into the Constitution, beginning a 10-year persecution of Catholics {{that resulted in the}} deaths of thousands, including several priests who were also knights of Columbus. Known as the <b>Mexican</b> martyrs, these men have been canonized.|$|E
5|$|Many {{immigrants}} openly flouted <b>Mexican</b> law, {{especially the}} prohibition against slavery. Combined with United States' attempts to purchase Texas, <b>Mexican</b> authorities decided in 1830 to prohibit continued immigration from the United States. New laws {{also called for}} the enforcement of customs duties angering both native <b>Mexican</b> citizens (Tejanos) and recent immigrants.|$|E

5000|$|In 1910 the State of Michigan {{had fewer}} than 100 <b>Mexicans.</b> In the 20th Century the {{original}} <b>Mexicans</b> arriving in Detroit {{came from the}} central portion of Mexico. <b>Mexicans</b> moved to Detroit to get industrial jobs, including Henry Ford's $5 per day jobs. The community of Mexicantown, originally known as [...] "La Bagley", was established to provide Mexican-oriented goods and services. Historians estimated that in reality Detroit alone had over 4,000 <b>Mexicans</b> even though the U.S. Census of 1920 only counted 1,268 <b>Mexicans</b> in the entire state.

5|$|The <b>Mexican</b> {{government}} {{declared the}} region in Nayarit near the landfall of Kenna as a disaster area, allowing for the usage of emergency funds.

The <b>Mexican</b> government deployed the <b>Mexican</b> Army to the area to remove fallen trees and establish water treatment plants to assist the affected population. The <b>Mexican</b> Navy was sent to assist to support medical personnel in the San Blas area, and the government Department for Family Development assisted the <b>Mexican</b> Red Cross in delivering food. Grupo Modelo, brewers of Corona beer, sent 6,600gallons (25,000liters) of drinking water and 1000food sets for the San Blas area.|$|E

5|$|Under President Antonio López de Santa Anna, the <b>Mexican</b> {{government}} began to {{shift away from}} a federalist model. The increasingly dictatorial policies, including the revocation of the Constitution of 1824 in early 1835, incited many federalists to revolt. The border region of <b>Mexican</b> Texas was largely populated by immigrants from the United States. These people were accustomed to a federalist government and to extensive individual rights, and they were quite vocal in their displeasure at Mexico's shift towards centralism. Already suspicious after previous American attempts to purchase <b>Mexican</b> Texas, <b>Mexican</b> authorities blamed much of the Texian unrest on American immigrants, most of whom had made little effort {{to adapt to the}} <b>Mexican</b> culture.|$|E
5|$|With the {{darkness}} and fog, <b>Mexican</b> soldiers could not estimate how many men had surrounded them. They withdrew 300 yards (meters) to a nearby bluff. At about 6am, Texians emerged from the trees and began firing at the <b>Mexican</b> soldiers. Lieutenant Gregorio Pérez counterattacked with 40 mounted soldiers. The Texians fell back to the trees and fired a volley, injuring a <b>Mexican</b> private. According to some accounts, the cannon {{fell out of the}} wagon upon the shot. Unable to safely maneuver among the trees, the <b>Mexican</b> horsemen returned to the bluff.|$|E
5|$|After an {{erroneous}} scouting {{report of}} approaching <b>Mexican</b> troops, Baker burned San Felipe de Austin {{to the ground}} on March 30. When Baker claimed Houston had given him an order to do so, Houston denied it. Houston's account was that the residents burned their own property {{to keep it out}} of the hands of the <b>Mexican</b> army. San Felipe de Austin's residents did as those before them in escaping the <b>Mexican</b> army, and fled to the east.|$|E

50|$|In {{the late}} 1970s and early 1980s tens of {{thousands}} of <b>Mexicans</b> arrived in Houston due to increased economic opportunities from an increase in the oil business. In the 1970s 63,000 <b>Mexicans</b> arrived in the Houston metropolitan area. In the more recent immigrant wave, the <b>Mexicans</b> tended to work in informal labor markets. Most <b>Mexicans</b> in the immigrant wave in the 1970s and 1980s originated from Coahuila, Nuevo León, and Tamaulipas, states along the U.S.-Mexico border. In 1980, according to the U.S. census, there were 93,718 <b>Mexicans</b> who were born outside of the United States. 68% of the <b>Mexicans</b> in that figure had immigrated since 1970. In the early 1980s there was an estimation of 80,000 illegal immigrants from Mexico, along with 300,000 native Hispanics.|$|R
5|$|After the Taft-Díaz summit, Burnham led {{a team of}} 500 men in {{guarding}} mining properties {{owned by}} Hammond, J. P. Morgan, and the Guggenheims in the <b>Mexican</b> state of Sonora. Just as the irrigation and mining projects were nearing completion in 1912, {{a long series of}} <b>Mexican</b> revolutions began. The final blow to these efforts came in 1917 when Mexico passed laws prohibiting the sale of land to foreigners. Burnham and Hammond carried their properties until 1930 and then sold them to the <b>Mexican</b> government.|$|E
5|$|Although some in {{the front}} of the <b>Mexican</b> ranks wavered, {{soldiers}} in the rear pushed them on. As the troops massed against the walls, Texians were forced to lean over the walls to shoot, leaving them exposed to <b>Mexican</b> fire. Travis became one of the first defenders to die, shot while firing his shotgun into the soldiers below him, though one source says that he drew his sword and stabbed a <b>Mexican</b> officer who had stormed the wall before succumbing to his injury. Few of the <b>Mexican</b> ladders reached the walls. The few soldiers who were able to climb the ladders were quickly killed or beaten back. As the Texians discharged their previously loaded rifles, however, they found it increasingly difficult to reload while attempting to keep <b>Mexican</b> soldiers from scaling the walls.|$|E

5|$|Between 1830 and 1832 the <b>Mexican</b> Congress {{passed a}} series of laws that seemed to {{discriminate}} against Anglo colonists {{in the province of}} Coahuila y Tejas, increasing tension between the Anglo citizenry and <b>Mexican</b> officials. In response to the rumblings, <b>Mexican</b> troops established military posts in several locations within the province, including San Antonio de Béxar. Although much of the military supported the administration of President Anastasio Bustamante, Antonio López de Santa Anna led an insurrection against him in 1832. Anglo colonists in Texas supported Santa Anna and General José Antonio Mexía, who led soldiers into Texas to oust commanders loyal to Bustamante.|$|E
5|$|By 6:30a.m. {{the battle}} for the Alamo was over. <b>Mexican</b> {{soldiers}} inspected each corpse, bayoneting any body that moved. Even with all of the Texians dead, <b>Mexican</b> soldiers continued to shoot, some killing each other in the confusion. <b>Mexican</b> generals were unable to stop the bloodlust and appealed to Santa Anna for help. Although the general showed himself, the violence continued and the buglers were finally ordered to sound a retreat. For 15minutes after that, soldiers continued to fire into dead bodies.|$|E

5|$|For the {{remainder}} of 1913, Yorktown conducted local operations out of San Diego and San Francisco. In January 1914, though, the gunboat returned to <b>Mexican</b> waters and investigated local conditions at Ensenada between 3 and 6 January before moving, in subsequent months, to a succession of <b>Mexican</b> ports: Mazatlán, San Blas, Miramar, Topolobampo, and La Paz. Following an overhaul at Mare Island from 24 June to 2 September 1914, Yorktown served in <b>Mexican</b> waters again into June 1915. From that point until the entry of the United States into World War I in April 1917, Yorktown continued her routine of patrols off <b>Mexican,</b> Nicaraguan, and Honduran ports with occasional repairs at Mare Island and maneuvers out of San Diego.|$|E
5|$|Given the {{superficial}} {{similarities between the}} two flags, the Italian flag and the <b>Mexican</b> flag have been compared over time. However, the Italian tricolour actually uses lighter shades of green and red and the two have different aspect ratios; the Italian flag's aspect ratio is 2:3, while the <b>Mexican</b> flag's aspect ratio of 4:7 results in a more elongated rectangular shape. When Italy became a republic in 1946, the <b>Mexican</b> naval ensign was a plain tricolour; for this reason, on demand of the international naval authorities, Italy could not adopt a sole national flag similar to France as it wished.|$|E
