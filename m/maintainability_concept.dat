40|$|This paper {{develops}} improved stochastic {{models for}} the description of a large variety of fatigue crack growth phenomena that occur in components of considerable importance to the functionality and reliability of complex engineering structures. In essence, the models {{are based on the}} McGill-Markov and Closure-Lognormal stochastic processes. Not only do these models have the capability of predicting the statistical dispersion of crack growth rates, they also, by incorporating the concept of crack closure, have the capability of transferring stochastic crack growth properties measured under ideal laboratory conditions to situations of industrial significance, such as those occurring under adverse loading and/or environmental conditions. The primary data required in order {{to be in a position}} to estimate the pertinent parameters of these stochastic models are obtained from a statistically significant number of replicate tests. In this paper, both the theory and the experimental technique are illustrated using a Ti- 6 Al- 4 V alloy. Finally, important structural integrity, reliability, availability and <b>maintainability</b> <b>concepts</b> are developed and illustrated...|$|R
25|$|<b>Maintainability</b> {{includes}} <b>concepts</b> of modularity, understandability, changeability, testability, reusability, and transferability {{from one}} development team to another. These {{do not take}} the form of critical issues at the code level. Rather, poor maintainability is typically the result of thousands of minor violations with best practices in documentation, complexity avoidance strategy, and basic programming practices that make the difference between clean and easy-to-read code vs. unorganized and difficult-to-read code.|$|R
40|$|Reliability and Maintainability (R&M) {{issues are}} {{discussed}} which pertain to Fire Protection (FP) systems. Although R&M {{technology has been}} developed primarily for military and electronic systems, the philosophies and methodolo-gies are applicable {{to the field of}} Fire Protection. To illustrate this, the reliability of a representative system for a high rise building is analyzed. Chance of failure and MTBF (Mean Time Between Failure) indices are calculated for a sub-set of equipment which delivers electrical power to a pump automatic-ally. The system power depends upon redundant Diesel Generators (DG's) which back-up the electric Utility Line. Actual failure data is derived for each equipment. The results raise concern over the appreciable chance of failure of such systems. The case where only one back-up DG is used (typically) repre-sents a condition which is worse. Several <b>Maintainability</b> <b>concepts</b> are pre-sented. These include specification design requirements, fault detection, isolation, built-in test, automatic test equipment, and schemes utilizing Com-puter Management Systems for periodic exercise and monitoring of FP equipment. Overviews of several adaptable contemporary R&M programs are provided. These include the treatment of purely mechanical equipment. The authors highly rec...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{develops}} improved stochastic {{models for}} the description of a large variety of fatigue crack growth phenomena that occur in structural and mechanical components of fundamental importance to the functionality and reliability of complex and modern engineering structures. In essence, the models are based upon the recently available McGill-Markov and the newly developed Closure-Lognormal stochastic processes. These models have not only the capability of predicting the statistical dispersion of the crack growth rate, which {{is dependent on the}} inherent crack resistance characteristics of the material being examined, but also, by incorporating the concept of crack closure into the Paris-Erdogan law through the use of the effective stress intensity range factor, have the capability of transferring the stochastic properties of crack growth rates measured under ideal laboratory conditions to situations of industrial significance, such as those occurring under adverse loading and/or environmental conditions. The primary data required in order {{to be in a position}} to estimate the pertinent parameters of these stochastic models are obtained, as is fully discussed in this thesis, from a statistically significant number of replicate tests. The application of both the theory and the experimental technique are illustrated using a Ti- 6 Al- 4 V alloy of considerable importance to the aerospace industry. The application of these {{models for the}} assessment of component reliability is detailed in the latter stages of the investigation reported in this thesis. Important reliability, availability and <b>maintainability</b> <b>concepts</b> are developed and thoroughly illustrated. In this way, fundamental models developed during the course of this investigation will in the future, have the capability of predicting reliability and maintenance parameters of considerable significance to the assessment of component reliability...|$|R
40|$|Design for {{maintenance}} {{is concerned with}} achieving good design that considers the general care and maintenance of equipment and the repair actions that follow a failure. This thesis gives an overview about the theoretical background of maintainability respectively design {{for maintenance}} and presents how companies in the Swedish manufacturing sector are dealing with design for maintenance for their machines. This work discusses the behavior {{and dealing with the}} topic design for maintenance {{from the perspective of the}} users.   In order to answer the research questions of this thesis, a literature review and expert interviews were used. Industrial experts from maintenance departments of Swedish industrial companies answered the interview questions for this research which serve as a foundation for the results and the analysis.   The results of the research questions and the conclusion are summarized on the basis of the expert interviews. It enables the reader to know to what extent design for maintenance is considered, how important it is, how communication affects the design and therefore the maintainability and finally a rating of how important a range of maintainability attributes are for them.   For the Swedish manufacturing industry design for maintenance is a topic which is considered as important, but a lot of effort in improving maintainability due to the design is not conducted. Improving maintainability with the help of adapting <b>maintainability</b> <b>concepts</b> or recording data especially for design issues are examples for the potential. Swedish companies have the opportunity to create an appropriate relation to the suppliers to utilize benefits in order to improve maintainability. The rating of maintainability attributes turns out as very difficult for the interview experts because of the strong relation between them...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} a tokamak design concept which could provide solutions {{to some of}} the possible problems of using a pulsed tokamak as a commercial power reactor, namely effects of pulsed operation, complexity and <b>maintainability.</b> The design <b>concept</b> is a device which provides very long pulses (several hours- 1 day) with the voltsecond capability of the ohmic heating transformer. It operates at low beta with a near circular plasma and a simple equilibrium field system. The superconducting toroidal field coils are individually removable and the tokamak is completely modularized. Illustrative parameters are a major radius of 15 m, an aspect ratio of 6, magnetic field on axis of 7. 2 T, an average toroidal beta of 0. 017, and a pulse length of 14 hours. ...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, the {{concepts}} of data encapsulation and data abstraction are applied to Petri nets. Encapsulation is realized by enclosing a data object inside a high level Petri net. Access to the data object is permitted only via exported operations. Abstraction is realized by separating a definition net and an implementation net. This separation is a well known concept of modules, used to handle the complexity problem of large systems and to increase the reusability and <b>maintainability.</b> But this <b>concept</b> {{has not yet been}} applied to a modelling technique with Petri nets. Two new hierarchy concepts are introduced to establish the connection between the implementation net and the definition net of one module and between different modules, respectively. Together with the new methodical concepts, a graphical notation of the Petri net model is introduced, which results in an intuitive visualization of Petri net modules. Keywords: High level Petri nets, data abstraction, encapsula [...] ...|$|R
40|$|The OMG 2 ̆ 7 s model-driven {{architecture}} is quickly attracting attention {{as a method}} of constructing systems that offers advantages over traditional approaches in terms of reliability, consistency, and <b>maintainability.</b> The key <b>concepts</b> in the MDA are models that are related by model transformations. However, for the MDA to provide an adequate alternative to existing approaches, it must offer comparable support for software engineering processes such as requirements analysis, design and testing. This paper attempts to explore the application of the last of these processes, testing, to the most novel part of the MDA, that of model transformation. We present a general view of the roles of testing in the different stages of model-driven development, and a more detailed exploration of approaches to testing model transformations. Based on this, we highlight the particular issues for the different testing tasks, including adequacy criteria, test oracles and automatic test data generation. We also propose possible approaches for the testing tasks, and show how existing functional and structural testing techniques can be adapted for use in this new development context...|$|R
40|$|Despite allocating huge budgets {{to civil}} {{engineering}} projects, detailed planning, and employing human resources, project managers still face time, cost, and quality constraints. Most of these challenges {{are due to}} a lack of integration of different project phases and the limitations of the presence of construction and maintenance contractors in the initial stages of the project. Considering the benefits of applying constructability, operability, and <b>maintainability</b> (COM) <b>concepts,</b> many problems caused by lack of coordination, or duplications and weakness in management, and also time and extra costs due to lack of presence of construction and maintenance contractors in the early stages of the project are resolvable. In this regard, various studies have investigated the benefits of applying these concepts; however, there has been no comprehensive analysis of the benefits of COM. As a result of focus on the benefits of implementation of these concepts and evaluating the effect of each of these strategies and benefits, from different perspectives during various time periods, managers can increase project efficiency and productivity, and improve their performance, through using concepts and strategies of their implementation. This research aims to evaluate the trend of studies on the benefits of implementing constructability, operability, and maintainability in the construction industry. For that, the in-depth literature review method is applied. For qualitative analysis of the obtained information, descriptive analysis has been used. Then, the data was coded, and classified using Excel Software for quantitative data analysis. Finally, the charts presented were evaluated according to the classified fields of study. The necessity of performing such a study is significant because of the fact that a large share of a project’s problems, such as lack of plans’ integration and weakness of administrative system, and increasing time and cost, are due to lack of exchange of information and ineffective relationship between the design people and the construction and maintenance stakeholders, and ignoring the effects of design decisions on constructability and operability and maintainability implementation...|$|R
40|$|Construction {{managers}} in infrastructure projects in different societies offer and use approaches that can conclude each project’s triangle of cost, time, and {{quality in the}} most optimal mode, satisfying important needs of the projects. One of these approaches is benefiting from concepts of Constructability, Operability, and <b>Maintainability</b> (the threefold <b>concepts</b> of COM), which can satisfy such need in infrastructure projects. In order to implement each approach, while the desired approach is innovative, as well, there are some barriers. It is significantly required to offer solutions to obtain desired results from that approach. Therefore, {{the aim of this}} research is presenting solutions to overcome existing barriers in implementing the threefold concepts of COM in infrastructure projects. For that, the Meta-Synthesis method is applied, which is placed in qualitative research category. In order to analyze collected data, descriptive and pattern coding techniques have been used. As the result of this study, a systematic classification of the solutions to overcome barriers of implementing the threefold concepts of COM in infrastructure projects is presented. The aim of construction managers is successful delivery of projects, for that, it is suggested to use such approaches that result in integration of different project life cycle phases. This facilitates optimization of project time and cost, aiming to provide a better quality of constructions. Therefore, in order to achieve infrastructure projects main objectives, such approaches are to be used, and in order to overcome barriers in implementing them, some solutions are to be identified, classified and presented...|$|R
