5|$|At {{the same}} time, the {{aircraft}} {{industry as a}} whole was becoming increasingly interested in VTOL aircraft. It was expected that any future European war would start with a nuclear exchange that would destroy most airbases, so aircraft would need to operate from limited airbases, roads or even unprepared fields. Considerable research effort was put into various solutions to securing a second-strike capability. Some of these solutions included rocket-launched aircraft like the zero-length launch concept, while <b>many</b> <b>companies</b> started work on VTOL aircraft as a more appropriate long-term solution.|$|E

5|$|Before the Beatles {{achieved}} nationwide {{success in}} Britain, Epstein had permitted a company (run by his cousins and initially catering to fan club members), to produce Beatles' sweaters for 30 shillings (£1.50) and badges for 6 pence (6d) (2½p). It sold 15,000 sweaters and 50,000 badges as the group's popularity grew. When Beatlemania swept the UK in November 1963, Epstein was besieged by novelty goods companies desperate {{to use the}} Beatles' name on plastic guitars, drums, disc racks, badges, belts and other merchandise. Epstein refused to allow the Beatles to endorse any product directly, but through NEMS Enterprises he granted discretionary licences to companies {{who were able to}} produce quality products at a fair price, even though <b>many</b> <b>companies</b> were already selling products without a licence.|$|E

5|$|Beyond the band's {{specific}} {{legal issues}} and {{insight into the}} making of the new album, the film also examines the state of the modern music industry as a whole, focusing on the complex relationships between major labels and their artists. Other musicians give their first-hand accounts of their own experiences in the business. The logistics and economics of how a record company works are explained by music industry insiders, including former EMI employees, music producers and music journalists. They trace the impact of the growing American economic recession on the industry, wherein <b>many</b> <b>companies</b> were taken over by larger groups who thought they could save them. In this instance, Terra Firma Capital Partners sought to rescue EMI despite having little experience in music management.|$|E
5|$|During {{the late}} 1940s, {{in the face}} of the {{emerging}} Cold War scenario, the RAF came to recognise that it would urgently require the development and procurement of fighters equipped with features such as swept wings. By this time, it had also become apparent that newly developed jet propulsion would form the future of fighter aircraft development. <b>Many</b> <b>companies</b> were quick to devise their own designs to harness this means of propulsion. Hawker Aviation's chief designer, Sydney Camm, had proposed the Hawker P.1040 for the RAF, but the demonstrator failed to interest them. Further modifications to the basic design resulted in the Hawker Sea Hawk carrier-based fighter. However, the Sea Hawk possessed a straight wing and was powered by the Rolls-Royce Nene turbojet engine, both features that rapidly became obsolete.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, NBN's Perth-based owner, Parry Corporation, spun off NBN Limited {{into a new}} company, NBN Enterprises, and took a 40% stake in the new company, with Security Pacific Capital Corporation buying 60%. Parry sold their stake soon after, holding onto Papua New Guinea {{television}} station NTN, which NBN had helped to set up. Fulcrum Media's move to later purchase the station was a source for confusion, as {{it was revealed that}} <b>many</b> <b>companies,</b> including the NSW State Superannuation Board and Westpac Banking Corporation, held substantial stakes in Fulcrum Media. Parry Corp's new owner CityWest issued a court challenge to re-acquire NBN, but it was revealed that CityWest was held by Hong Kong company Hung Lung Corporation, thereby violating foreign ownership laws.

5|$|Seattle in {{this period}} {{attracted}} widespread attention as home to these <b>many</b> <b>companies,</b> but also by hosting the 1990 Goodwill Games and the APEC leaders conference in 1993, {{as well as through}} the worldwide popularity of grunge, a sound that had developed in Seattle's independent music scene. Another bid for worldwide attention—hosting the World Trade Organization Ministerial Conference of 1999—garnered visibility, but not in the way its sponsors desired, as related protest activity and police reactions to those protests overshadowed the conference itself. The city was further shaken by the Mardi Gras Riots in 2001, and then literally shaken the following day by the Nisqually earthquake.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after the}} end of the American Revolution in 1783, a surge of westward {{migration}} into Central and Western New York began. At the time, most travel west of the Albany area was by water. While rudimentary roads were laid out following the Mohawk River, there were no major land routes west of Fort Schuyler (present day Utica), except for an old east–west Iroquois trail that was a simple foot path. By the late 1780s <b>many</b> <b>companies</b> began to set up their operations in the new settlements in the Central and Western New York.

5|$|The {{first half}} of the story takes place {{primarily}} at Hikarizaka Private High School, a fictional school located in Japan.

This world is devoid of all life except for a young girl, though she later makes a body out of junk pieces through which the player can interact with her. The remaining half of the story takes place in the same city, after the conclusion of the first half. While the town's name was never directly mentioned, one can infer that the town's name is Hikarizaka based on the <b>many</b> <b>companies</b> and establishments that share this name.|$|E

5|$|The general {{atmosphere}} of enrichment and satisfaction {{during the period}} of economic growth in Côte d'Ivoire made it possible for Houphouët-Boigny to maintain and control internal political tensions. His easygoing authoritarian regime, where political prisoners were almost nonexistent, was well accepted by the population. However, the economic crisis that began in the 1980s caused a sharp decline in living conditions for the middle class and underprivileged urban populations. According to the World Bank, the population living below the poverty threshold went from 11% in 1985 to 31% by 1993. Despite the implementation of certain measures, such as the reduction of the number of young French workers (who worked abroad while serving in the military) from 3,000 to 2,000 in 1986, allowing many jobs to go to young Ivorian graduates, the government failed to control the rising rates of unemployment and bankruptcy in <b>many</b> <b>companies.</b>|$|E
5|$|Western Australia has a {{significant}} share of the Australia's uranium reserves, but between 2002 and 2008, a statewide ban on uranium mining was in force. The ban was lifted when the Liberal Party was voted into power in the state and, as of 2010, <b>many</b> <b>companies</b> are exploring for uranium in Western Australia. One of the industry's major players, the mining company BHP Billiton, planned to develop the Yeelirrie uranium project in a 17billion dollar project. Two other projects in Western Australia are further advanced then BHP's Yeelirrie, these being the Lake Way uranium project, which is pursued by Toro Energy, and the Lake Maitland uranium project, pursued by Mega Uranium.

5|$|With {{the fuel}} price {{increases}} of the 2000s, the EPA and <b>many</b> <b>companies</b> {{have sought to}} increase diesel truck fuel economy. One such example is the hydraulic hybrid vehicle, which stores energy in hydraulic tanks and hydraulic motors (as opposed to the electric hybrid vehicle which uses batteries and regenerative brakes). Electric hybrid vehicles are another option, with savings of 35 to 60 percent over traditional vehicles. Drivers themselves may improve fuel efficiency by using a method called progressive shifting, in which the driver shifts through the gears (typical trucks may have between 10 and 18 gears) {{in such a manner}} as to optimize the power range of the engine.|$|E
