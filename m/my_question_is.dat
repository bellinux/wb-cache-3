500|$|... "A Time Machine Is My New Girlfriend" [...] is a frenetic rocker with a Bo Diddley rhythm, {{and lyrics}} cautioning {{listeners}} that relationships can come with [...] "late fees". Hunt explained its lyrics to be {{a metaphor for}} his lover making him feel younger. The title track features metronomic drumming and chicken scratch riffs. It is about people from different economic classes falling in love after social and economic conditions moved them into the same neighborhood. The setting is described in the first verse, [...] "It's the end of white flight / even tycoons are licking their wounds / economic blight got the neighborhood looking gap-toothed / end of white flight / maybe now you see something you like / money tight and you're hating your life". Hunt said that writing the song was [...] "essentially a response {{to some of the}} things I have seen {{as a result of the}} global recession we are going through. I wasn't trying to make any political statement. I was more making a philosophical comment that essentially says we have all these unspoken issues in our society. But I see a collision of those ideas and unresolved issues. <b>My</b> <b>question</b> <b>is</b> what could you have been hoping for when we make the kind of decisions in our society that we have made." ...|$|E
2500|$|You pledged {{during the}} last debate {{that you would not}} raise taxes on those making less than $200,000 a year. But the price of {{everything}} is going up, and we all know it. Health care costs, as you all talking about, is skyrocketing, the cost of the war. <b>My</b> <b>question</b> <b>is,</b> how can you or any president, whoever is elected next time, keep that pledge without running this country deeper into debt and passing on more of the bills that we're running up to our children? ...|$|E
60|$|Well and good! On {{that issue}} every Socialist is with them. But their answer to <b>my</b> <b>question</b> <b>is</b> none the less wrong.|$|E
60|$|Our {{interview}} {{was a long}} one. All <b>my</b> <b>questions</b> <b>were</b> answered fully and frankly.|$|R
60|$|Benjamin started. <b>My</b> <b>question</b> <b>was</b> {{certainly}} a strange one, {{after what he}} had just said to me.|$|R
60|$|I {{thanked him}} {{and made my}} way thither across the {{reception}} hall. The answer to <b>my</b> <b>question</b> <b>was</b> given at once.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Was it {{with your}} {{knowledge}} and permission that Ferrari used your name?' she asked. 'The whole soul of <b>my</b> <b>question</b> <b>is</b> in that. For God's sake answer me--Yes, or No!' ...|$|E
6000|$|Gloucester {{spoke with}} much feeling, but Edward {{did not show}} himself touched; he only said, [...] "All this may be very well, but <b>my</b> <b>question</b> <b>is</b> not answered--Why was my squire put in ward?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Leo Vincey, yes, Leo Vincey," [...] he repeated, {{as though}} the name were {{familiar}} to him but had slipped his mind. [...] "But you have not answered <b>my</b> <b>question.</b> <b>Is</b> it needful that I should repeat the warning?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Stop one minute, if you please. <b>My</b> <b>questions</b> <b>are</b> these--Have you {{put an end}} to that acquaintance? And are {{you ready}} to give a promise that it shall never be resumed?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I was not wishing {{you to give}} me so {{much your}} own ideas, as the common talk of the town; but I see that <b>my</b> <b>question</b> <b>was</b> indiscreet, and I ask your pardon." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm sure I am very sorry," [...] {{he assured}} her. [...] "I didn't imagine that <b>my</b> <b>questions</b> <b>were</b> {{in any way}} offensive. I told you from the first that I was always {{interested}} in invalids and cases of illness." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not at all," [...] Hodder disavowed. [...] "Perhaps <b>my</b> <b>question</b> <b>is</b> too personal, but I didn't intend it to be. I {{was merely}} {{wondering}} whether any event or {{series of events}} had transformed a mere knowledge of these conditions into feeling." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Exactly," [...] Wrayson answered, [...] "and <b>my</b> <b>question</b> <b>is</b> this. I cannot ask you why you and she parted, but {{at least}} you can tell me if you know of any reason why I should not ask her to be my wife." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She fleed at him, and, {{to cut a}} {{long story}} short, he owned to having carried off five sack altogether, upon her {{promising}} not to persecute him. Well, he's turned out neck and crop, and <b>my</b> <b>question</b> <b>is,</b> who's going to be baily now?" ...|$|E
60|$|The woman's story hung coherently together, and all <b>my</b> <b>questions</b> <b>were</b> {{unable to}} shake it. I could only check it by finding if she had, indeed, instituted divorce {{proceedings}} against {{her husband at}} or {{about the time of}} the tragedy.|$|R
6000|$|... "You or any and I or any--what sort {{of speech}} is that? Is it a compliment, think you, to be {{mixed with a}} drove in that fashion? <b>My</b> <b>question</b> <b>was</b> of you and me. If I were wronged would you be my man?" ...|$|R
60|$|I was {{prepared}} for him again to set aside <b>my</b> <b>question,</b> and <b>was</b> surprised at the readiness of his reply.|$|R
6000|$|... "A {{little while}} ago you spoke of your indignation at the inequalities and injustices of the world, and when I asked you if you had always felt this, you replied that this feeling had grown upon you. <b>My</b> <b>question</b> <b>is</b> this: whether that indignation would be present at all {{if it were not}} meant to be turned into action." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's only worth talking about, mio caro," [...] she smiled, [...] "from your having begun it. <b>My</b> <b>question</b> <b>is</b> only reasonable--so {{that your}} idea may stand or fall by {{your answer to}} it. If I should pin {{one of these things}} on for you would it be, to your mind, that I might go home and show it to Maggie as your present?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Stop!" [...] said Midwinter. [...] "Don't {{trust me}} with any secrets {{which are not}} your own. If you have given a promise, don't trifle with it, even in {{speaking}} to such an intimate friend as I am." [...] He laid his hand gently and kindly on Allan's shoulder. [...] "I can't help seeing that I have made you a little uncomfortable," [...] he went on. [...] "I can't help seeing that <b>my</b> <b>question</b> <b>is</b> not so easy a one to answer as I had hoped and supposed. Shall we wait a little? Shall we go upstairs and breakfast first?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Cosmopolites always do. Now answer <b>my</b> <b>questions.</b> What <b>were</b> you up to?' and Dare as {{he spoke}} played with the pistol again.|$|R
6000|$|Lawton: [...] "I've {{no doubt}} he wishes I had a glass eye--two of them, for that matter. But that isn't {{answering}} <b>my</b> <b>question.</b> Where <b>is</b> Mrs. Somers?" ...|$|R
5000|$|In 1967 {{he asked}} several {{university}} graduates to name two red-flowered tree or an exclusively Indian animal. Nobody passed his test {{and he wrote}} [...] is there something radically wrong with the education and culture of our {{young men and women}} that they should not know the answers to these reasonable <b>questions,</b> or <b>is</b> it that I have become a monomaniac and am therefore unable to perceive how unfair <b>my</b> <b>questions</b> <b>are</b> ? ...|$|R
6000|$|Mackay {{was a hot}} bigot. He {{would not}} hear of religion. I have seen him waste hours of time in {{argument}} {{with all sorts of}} poor human creatures who understood neither him nor themselves, and he had had the boyishness to dissect and criticise even so small a matter as the riddler's definition of mind. He snorted aloud with zealotry and the lust for intellectual battle. Anything, whatever it was, that seemed to him likely to discourage the continued passionate production of corn and steam-engines he resented like a conspiracy against the people. Thus, when I put in the plea for literature, that it was only in good books, or in the society of the good, that a man could get help in his conduct, he declared I was in a different world from him. [...] "Damn my conduct!" [...] said he. [...] "I have given it up for a bad job. <b>My</b> <b>question</b> <b>is,</b> 'Can I drive a nail?'" [...] And he plainly looked upon me as one who was insidiously seeking to reduce the people's annual bellyful of corn and steam-engines.|$|E
6000|$|So {{this is the}} why and {{wherefore}} of its {{coming to}} pass my dear that we called him Jemmy, being after the Major his own godfather with Lirriper for a surname being after myself, and never was a dear child such a brightening thing in a Lodgings or such a playmate to his grandmother as Jemmy to this house and me, and always good and minding what he was told (upon the whole) and soothing for the temper and making everything pleasanter except when he grew old enough to drop his cap down Wozenham's Airy and they wouldn't hand it up to him, and being worked into a state I put on my best bonnet and gloves and parasol with the child {{in my hand and}} I says [...] "Miss Wozenham I little thought ever to have entered your house but unless my grandson's cap is instantly restored, the laws of this country regulating the property of the Subject shall at length decide betwixt yourself and me, cost what it may." [...] With a sneer upon her face which did strike me I must say as being expressive of two keys but {{it may have been a}} mistake and if there is any doubt let Miss Wozenham have the full benefit of it as is but right, she rang the bell and she says [...] "Jane, is there a street-child's old cap down our Airy?" [...] I says [...] "Miss Wozenham before your housemaid answers that question you must allow me to inform you to your face that my grandson is not a street-child and is not in the habit of wearing old caps. In fact" [...] I says [...] "Miss Wozenham I am far from sure that my grandson's cap may not be newer than your own" [...] which was perfectly savage in me, her lace being the commonest machine-make washed and torn besides, but I had been put into a state to begin with fomented by impertinence. Miss Wozenham says red in the face [...] "Jane you heard <b>my</b> <b>question,</b> <b>is</b> there any child's cap down our Airy?" [...] "Yes Ma'am" [...] says Jane, [...] "I think I did see some such rubbish a-lying there." [...] "Then" [...] says Miss Wozenham [...] "let these visitors out, and then throw up that worthless article out of my premises." [...] But here the child who had been staring at Miss Wozenham with all his eyes and more, frowns down his little eyebrows purses up his little mouth puts his chubby legs far apart turns his little dimpled fists round and round slowly over one another like a little coffee-mill, and says to her [...] "Oo impdent to mi Gran, me tut oor hi!" [...] "O!" [...] says Miss Wozenham looking down scornfully at the Mite [...] "this is not a street-child is it not! Really!" [...] I bursts out laughing and I says [...] "Miss Wozenham if this ain't a pretty sight to you I don't envy your feelings and I wish you good-day. Jemmy come along with Gran." [...] And I was still in the best of humours though his cap came flying up into the street as if it had been just turned on out of the water-plug, and I went home laughing all the way, all owing to that dear boy.|$|E
5000|$|Paracha: Your honor, <b>my</b> <b>question</b> <b>is</b> {{that your}} {{executive}} order is applicable around the earth? ...|$|E
30|$|In the field, <b>my</b> <b>questions</b> <b>were</b> {{initially}} and exclusively devoted {{in determining}} the geographical transhumance routes of the sheperds and recording their family (tribe membership or isolated family), religious affiliations, forms of managing livestock (transhumant, seminomadic, or nomadic), and what they produced. Secondly, I gleaned more general information on pastoral practices, including the number of animals owned, the type of sheep they kept, and why these types were kept.|$|R
6000|$|Yet my informant, {{this ancient}} and {{singularly}} intelligent old man, a gamekeeper all his life, who knows his jackdaw, {{could not tell}} me why gamekeepers no longer persecute so injurious a bird I He will not allow a sparrow-hawk to exist in his woods, yet all he could say when I repeated <b>my</b> <b>question</b> <b>was,</b> [...] "No keeper ever thinks of hurting a jack now, but I can't say why." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Shut up, you young scamp," [...] O'Grady said. [...] "How is it {{that you}} have not {{answered}} <b>my</b> <b>question?</b> Why <b>are</b> you wearing staff-officer's uniform instead of your own?" ...|$|R
5000|$|In 1978, Faurisson {{authored}} a French-language text, [...] "The Diary of Anne Frank Is It Authentic?". It {{appeared in}} Dutch-language translation in 1985, with the modified title, [...] "The Diary of Anne Frank A Forgery". The text questioned various {{elements of the}} Diary of Anne Frank, {{including the use of}} a vacuum cleaner by the family while in hiding. Faurisson continued,"Vacuum cleaners at that time were exceptionally noisy. I must ask: 'Is this credible?' <b>My</b> <b>question</b> <b>is</b> not just a formality. It is not rhetorical. Its purpose is not to astonish. <b>My</b> <b>question</b> <b>is</b> simply a question. An answer will have to be found." ...|$|E
50|$|En Kelvikku Enna Bathil (What is {{the answer}} for <b>my</b> <b>question)</b> <b>is</b> a 1978 Tamil film that is {{directed}} by P.Madhavan. It stars Rajinikanth and Sripriya in the lead roles. The movie was a failure at the box office.|$|E
5000|$|<b>My</b> <b>question</b> <b>is,</b> we here at Planned Parenthood support {{comprehensive}} {{sex education}} and I'd {{like to know}} if any of you as candidates have talked to your children about sex and used medically accurate and age-appropriate information? (Anne, Pennsylvania) ...|$|E
6000|$|He indulgently {{shook my}} hand again, and I felt <b>my</b> <b>questions</b> to <b>be</b> crude and my distinctions pitiful. [...] "Good-night, my dear boy--don't bother about it. After all, you do like a fellow." ...|$|R
60|$|But Mr. Greg felt <b>my</b> <b>question</b> to <b>be</b> {{insidious}} {{because it}} made him partly conscious that he had only examined {{one half of the}} subject he was discussing, and even that half without precision.|$|R
60|$|So <b>my</b> <b>question</b> <b>was</b> {{answered}} unexpectedly. Unk Wunk was out for {{fun that}} afternoon, and had {{rolled down the}} hill for {{the joy of the}} swift motion and the dizzy feeling afterwards, as other wood folk do. I have watched young foxes, whose den was on a steep hill side, rolling down one after the other, and sometime varying the programme by having one cub roll as fast as he could, while another capered alongside, snapping and worrying him in his brain-muddling tumble.|$|R
