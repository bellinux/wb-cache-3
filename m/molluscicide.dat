40|$|Schistosomiasis {{control was}} {{impossible}} without effective tools. Synthetic <b>molluscicides</b> {{developed in the}} 1950 s spearheaded community level control. Snail eradication proved impossible but repeated <b>mollusciciding</b> to manage natural snail populations could eliminate transmission. Escalating costs, logistical complexity, its labour-intensive nature and possible environmental effects caused some concern. The arrival of safe, effective, single-dose drugs in the 1970 s offered an apparently better alternative but experience revealed the need for repeated treatments to minimise reinfection in programmes relying on drugs alone. Combining treatment with <b>mollusciciding</b> was more successful, but broke down if <b>mollusciciding</b> was withdrawn to save money. The provision of sanitation and safe water to prevent transmission is too expensive in poor rural areas where schistosomiasis is endemic; rendering ineffective public health education linked to primary health care. In the tropics, moreover, children (the key group in maintaining transmission) will always play in water. Large scale destruction of natural snail habitats remains impossibly expensive (although proper design could render many new man-made habitats unsuitable for snails). Neither biological control agents nor plant <b>molluscicides</b> have proved satisfactory alternatives to synthetic <b>molluscicides.</b> Biologists can develop effective strategies for using synthetic <b>molluscicides</b> in different epidemiological situations if only, like drugs, their price can be reduced...|$|R

40|$|Purpose Methiocarb and {{metaldehyde}} are {{the most}} common <b>molluscicides</b> applied in agricultural and horticultural fields in Portugal and elsewhere in Europe. The application of molluscicidal baits to control slug and snail populations can pose a threat to non-target organisms like terrestrial isopods, because they are detritivorous and may feed on the toxic baits applied to the soil surface. The aim of this work was to evaluate the effects and understand the modes of action of these <b>molluscicides</b> to terrestrial isopods. Materials and methods In this study, the terrestrial isopod Porcellionides pruinosus was exposed to these two <b>molluscicides,</b> and the time to lethality was evaluated. Biochemical indicators (biomarkers) are known to provide early warning signs of environmental pollution or stress conditions to the organisms, by measuring cellular or molecular responses of the target organism to xenobiotic agents. Therefore, to evaluate modes of action and effects and also to see if biomarkers can be used as early warning tools in molluscicidal exposures, three different enzymes, glutathione S-transferase (GST), acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and catalase (CAT), were analysed upon single exposures and binary mixtures tests. Results and discussion These two <b>molluscicides</b> showed to be of extreme concern regarding terrestrial isopods, as all animals died after 24 h of exposure to methiocarb, and only 20 % survived after 56 h of exposure to metaldehyde. Results indicate that the carbamate methiocarb inhibited significantly AChE activity, but no effects were observed in CAT and GST levels. The exposure to metaldehyde had no effects on AChE, but a decrease in GST activity as well as a general increase in CAT activity was observed at the higher exposure period tested (32 h). The combined exposure of the two <b>molluscicides</b> resulted in a general decrease in AChE and CAT activity, but no visible effects were observed in terms of GST activity. Conclusions The LT 50 values found in the single exposures to both <b>molluscicides</b> were very low, {{especially in the case of}} the carbamate methiocarb. The use of several biomarkers was a suitable tool to understand the mode of action of these two <b>molluscicides</b> in this isopod species...|$|R

40|$|Background: Schistosoma mansoni {{infection}} is a persistent {{public health problem}} in many Kenyan communities. Although praziquantel is available, re-infection after chemotherapy treatment is inevitable, especially among children. Chemotherapy followed by intermittent <b>mollusciciding</b> of habitats of Biomphalaria pfeifferi, the intermediate host snail, may have longer term benefits, especially if timed to coincide with natural fluctuations in snail populations. Methods: In this cohort study, the Kambu River (Intervention area) was <b>molluscicided</b> intermittently for 4 years, after mass chemotherapy with praziquantel in the adjacent community of Darajani in January 1997. The nearby Thange River was selected as a control (Non-intervention area), and its adjacent community of Ulilinzi was treated with praziquantel in December 1996. Snail numbers were recorded monthly at 9 – 10 sites along each river, while rainfall data were collected monthly, and annual parasitological surveys were undertaken in each village. The <b>mollusciciding</b> protocol was adapted to local conditions, and simplified to improve prospects for widespread application. Results: After the initial reduction in prevalence attributable to chemotherapy, there was a gradual increase in the prevalence and intensity of infection in the non-intervention area, and significantly lower levels of re-infection amongst inhabitants of the intervention area. Incidence ratio between areas adjusted for age and gender at the first follow-up survey, 5 weeks after treatment in the non-intervention area and 4 months after treatment in the intervention area was not significant (few people turned positive), while during the following 4 annual surveys these ratios were 0. 58 (0. 39 - 0. 85), 0. 33 (0. 18 - 0. 60), 0. 14 (0. 09 - 0. 21) and 0. 45 (0. 26 - 0. 75), respectively. Snail numbers were consistently low in the intervention area {{as a result of}} the <b>mollusciciding.</b> Following termination of the <b>mollusciciding</b> at the end of 2000, snail populations and infections in snails increased again in the intervention area. Conclusion: The results of this study demonstrate that in the Kenyan setting a combination of chemotherapy followed by intermittent <b>mollusciciding</b> can have longer term benefits than chemotherapy alone...|$|R
