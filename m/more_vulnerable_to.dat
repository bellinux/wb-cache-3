5|$|Increasing ozone {{pollution}} is causing tissue {{damage to the}} massive giant sequoia trees in the park, making them <b>more</b> <b>vulnerable</b> <b>to</b> insect infestation and disease. Since the cones of these trees require fire-touched soil to germinate, historic fire suppression has reduced these trees' ability to reproduce. The current policy of setting prescribed fires is expected to help the germination issue.|$|E
5|$|It is {{also worth}} {{mentioning}} that sea shells, after collecting, {{need to be}} washed thoroughly in freshwater to remove the salt that is on and in the shell, and then dried thoroughly before they are stored. Salt attracts moisture and makes shells <b>more</b> <b>vulnerable</b> <b>to</b> Bynesian decay.|$|E
50|$|Disruptions of {{submarine}} communications cables {{may cause}} blackouts or slowdowns to large areas. Countries {{with a less}} developed Internet infrastructure are <b>more</b> <b>vulnerable</b> due <b>to</b> small numbers of high-capacity links.|$|R
50|$|After the Grenfell Tower fire in June 2017 {{letters were}} sent to around 17,000 care homes, {{hospitals}} and hospices requesting that they review fire safety processes, paying {{particular attention to the}} sarety of service users who were <b>more</b> <b>vulnerable</b> due <b>to</b> mobility issues or learning disabilities.|$|R
30|$|The {{standard}} security {{mechanisms are}} in place (such as ACLs) for data security.

Thus, proper security measures must be built-in features of tomorrow’s DFSs.|$|R
5|$|The Dorniers were {{to carry}} twenty 110-lb bombs each {{fitted with a}} fuse that would allow for {{function}} if released from 50 feet or higher; the type of bomb previously used by the Staffel had to release from twice this height, making the unit's Do 17s correspondingly <b>more</b> <b>vulnerable</b> <b>to</b> ground fire.|$|E
5|$|A {{hurricane}} in 1844 {{is said to}} have {{wiped out}} the population of Cuban macaws from Pinar del Río. Subsequent hurricanes in 1846 and 1856 further destroyed their habitat in western Cuba and scattered the remaining population. In addition, a tropical storm hit the Zapata Swamp in 1851. With a healthy macaw population, such events could have been beneficial by creating suitable habitat. However, given the species' precarious position, it may have resulted in fragmented habitat and caused them to seek food in areas where they were <b>more</b> <b>vulnerable</b> <b>to</b> hunting.|$|E
5|$|A woman's {{fertility}} is {{also affected}} by her age. As a woman's total egg supply is formed in fetal life, to be ovulated decades later, {{it has been}} suggested that this long lifetime may make the chromatin of eggs <b>more</b> <b>vulnerable</b> <b>to</b> division problems, breakage, and mutation than the chromatin of sperm, which are produced continuously during a man's reproductive life. However, despite this hypothesis, a similar paternal age effect has also been observed.|$|E
50|$|Resident Evil: Revelations 2 is a {{survival}} horror game which supports cooperative gameplay on console platforms. The game has stealth elements as {{only one of}} the players uses guns.

50|$|American {{planters}} {{responded to}} increased European demand by expanding {{the size and}} output of their plantations. The number of man-hours needed to sustain larger operations increased, which forced planters to acquire and accommodate additional slave labor. Furthermore, they had to secure larger initial loans from London, which increased pressure to produce a profitable crop and made them <b>more</b> financially <b>vulnerable</b> <b>to</b> natural disasters.|$|R
50|$|From South, West and North {{the citadel}} is {{protected}} by sharp cliffs of about 150 m, very hard to climb. The whole superior precinct is defended by exterior towers gathered in the northern flank and western corner. Because of its u-shape, {{the eastern side of}} the citadel was <b>more</b> <b>vulnerable</b> due <b>to</b> less natural obstacles. To boost its defensive capacity, the citadel holds in this sector the heaviest fortifications.|$|R
5|$|Cleph {{kept his}} throne for only 18 months before being assassinated by a slave. An {{important}} {{success for the}} Byzantines was that no king was proclaimed to succeed him, opening a decade of interregnum and making the Lombards who remained in Italy <b>more</b> <b>vulnerable</b> <b>to</b> attacks from Franks and Byzantines. It was only {{when faced with the}} danger of annihilation by the Franks in 584 that the Lombard dukes elected a new king in the person of Authari, son of Cleph, who began the definitive consolidation and centralization of the Lombard kingdom.|$|E
5|$|During {{the winter}} and spring, when the water levels were higher, otters had a greater {{tendency}} to prey upon crayfish (73% of scats had crayfish remains) rather than fish. However, when water levels are lower, crayfish will seek out shelter while fish become more highly concentrated and susceptible to predation. Therefore, fish are <b>more</b> <b>vulnerable</b> <b>to</b> being preyed upon by otters because the crayfish have become more difficult to obtain.|$|E
5|$|Habitat {{modification}} or {{destruction is}} one of the most dramatic issues affecting amphibian species worldwide. As amphibians generally need aquatic and terrestrial habitats to survive, threats to either habitat can affect populations. Hence, amphibians may be <b>more</b> <b>vulnerable</b> <b>to</b> habitat modification than organisms that only require one habitat type. Large scale climate changes may further be modifying aquatic habitats, preventing amphibians from spawning altogether.|$|E
40|$|Bushmeat {{is a large}} but largely {{invisible}} {{contributor to}} the economies of west and central African countries. Yet the trade is currently unsustainable. Hunting is reducing wildlife populations, driving <b>more</b> <b>vulnerable</b> species <b>to</b> local and regional extinction, and threatening biodiversity. This paper uses a commodity chain approach to explore the bushmeat trade and to demonstrate why an interdisciplinary approach is required if the trade is to be sustainable in the future...|$|R

50|$|Mortality on {{breeding}} grounds: small, insect eating birds {{contribute to}} the majority of post-arrival deaths, but many other birds including waders and waterfowls are also distressed by weather changes on breeding grounds. Since young birds are inexperienced, they are <b>more</b> <b>vulnerable</b> than adults <b>to</b> extreme weather conditions.|$|R
5|$|Horizontal orb webs {{are fairly}} common, despite being less {{effective}} at intercepting and retaining prey and <b>more</b> <b>vulnerable</b> <b>to</b> damage by rain and falling debris. Various researchers {{have suggested that}} horizontal webs offer compensating advantages, such as reduced vulnerability to wind damage; reduced visibility to prey flying upwards, because of the back-lighting from the sky; enabling oscillations to catch insects in slow horizontal flight. However, {{there is no single}} explanation for the common use of horizontal orb webs.|$|E
5|$|Iron ships {{had first}} been {{proposed}} for military {{use in the}} 1820s. In the 1830s and 1840s, France, Britain and the United States had all experimented with iron-hulled but unarmored gunboats and frigates. However, the iron-hulled frigate was abandoned {{by the end of}} the 1840s, because iron hulls were <b>more</b> <b>vulnerable</b> <b>to</b> solid shot; iron was more brittle than wood, and iron frames more likely to fall out of shape than wood.|$|E
5|$|Once {{they have}} {{collected}} nectar and pollen, female workers {{return to the}} nest and deposit the harvest into brood cells, or into wax cells for storage. Unlike honeybees, bumblebees only store a few days' worth of food, so are much <b>more</b> <b>vulnerable</b> <b>to</b> food shortages. Male bumblebees collect only nectar and do so to feed themselves. They may visit quite different flowers from the workers because of their different nutritional needs.|$|E
40|$|The {{differences}} between fishes in their size, behavior and food make them <b>more</b> or less <b>vulnerable</b> <b>to</b> fishing pressure.

50|$|The vast {{biodiversity}} {{of coral}} reefs consequently create an abundant fishing area for locals. This leads to overfishing of reef herbivore organisms {{which makes the}} coral reefs <b>more</b> <b>vulnerable</b> and unable <b>to</b> recover from large environmental disturbances. Unfortunately, most marine ecologists expect future oceans to be more overfished than now.|$|R
5|$|Research in 2009 {{has found}} that an {{indicator}} for an impaired protein production is common among all bees affected by CCD, a pattern consistent with IAPV infection. It is conjectured that Dicistroviridae, like the IAPV, cause degradation of the ribosomes, which are responsible for protein production of cells, and that this reduced ribosomal function weakens the bees, making them <b>more</b> <b>vulnerable</b> <b>to</b> factors that might not otherwise be lethal.|$|E
5|$|Zero Mission is {{the first}} game in the Metroid series to include a {{sequence}} in which the player controls Samus without her Power Suit. In {{this portion of the}} game, Samus is <b>more</b> <b>vulnerable</b> <b>to</b> damage, must crawl through ducts {{on her hands and knees}} without the help of her Morph Ball mode, and has a weak pistol that briefly stuns enemies as her only weapon. However, Samus retains all energy tanks she acquired previously.|$|E
5|$|Even if without direct predation, {{the giant}} otter must still {{compete with other}} predators for food resources. Duplaix {{documented}} interaction with the neotropical otter. While the two species are sympatric (with overlapping ranges) during certain seasons, {{there appeared to be}} no serious conflict. The smaller neotropical otter is far more shy, less noisy, and less social; at about a third the weight of the giant otter, it is <b>more</b> <b>vulnerable</b> <b>to</b> predation, hence, a lack of conspicuousness is to its advantage. The neotropical otter is active during twilight and darkness, reducing the likelihood of conflict with the diurnal giant otter. Its smaller prey, different denning habits, and different preferred water types also reduce interaction.|$|E

5|$|Both {{species are}} listed as {{vulnerable}} by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Anthropogenic threats include pollution, entanglement in fishing nets, and direct harvesting for their gill rakers for use in Chinese medicine. Their slow reproductive rate exacerbates these threats. They are protected in international waters by the Convention on Migratory Species of Wild Animals, but are <b>more</b> <b>vulnerable</b> closer <b>to</b> shore. Areas where mantas congregate are popular with tourists. Only a few public aquariums are large enough to house them.|$|R
40|$|An energy based approacb {{has been}} used to {{investigate}} the seismic behavior of code-designed, asymmetric-plan systems. The presented results demonstrate that the total input energy is about the same whether the system plan is symmetric or asymmetric. Furthermore, elements on the flexible-side in asymmetric-plan systems are <b>more</b> <b>vulnerable</b> compared <b>to</b> the same elements in symmetric-plan systems. The stiff-side elements, on the other hand, are expected to suffer no more damage in asymmetric-plan systems. This observation correlates well with the damage observed during several earthquakes...|$|R
5|$|Further, young giraffes {{are much}} <b>more</b> <b>vulnerable</b> <b>to</b> {{predation}} than adults: between 60% and 75% of calves die within a year. Mothers hide their calves, which {{spend much of}} the time lying down in cover. Since the presence of a mother does not affect survival, Mitchell suggests that young giraffes must be extremely well camouflaged. This is supported by the fact that coat markings are strongly inherited. Conversely, far from hiding, adult giraffes move about to gain the best view of an approaching predator, relying on their size and ability to defend themselves even from lions.|$|E
5|$|In 1833, his son Minh Mạng {{was faced}} with a {{rebellion}} led by Lê Văn Khôi, which started after the tomb of Khôi's father Lê Văn Duyệt was desecrated by imperial officials. The rebels took control of the citadel and the revolt continued until the imperial forces took control of the citadel in 1835. Following the capture of the citadel, Minh Mang ordered its razing and replacement with a smaller square stone-built structure, that was <b>more</b> <b>vulnerable</b> <b>to</b> attacks. On February 17, 1859, the citadel was captured during the French invasion after less than a day of battle and significant amounts of military supplies were seized. Realising {{that they did not have}} the capacity to hold the fort against Vietnamese attempts to recapture it, the French razed it with explosives, before withdrawing their troops.|$|E
5|$|Many of {{the more}} seriously damaged homes were of simple construction, with walls made of mud, adobe, or brick packed 40–50cm (16–20in) thick. These {{materials}} are generally <b>more</b> <b>vulnerable</b> <b>to</b> {{the force of the}} earthquake, but some of the traditionally constructed homes sustained little or no damage. This was due to a range of factors, possibly including the height-to-width ratio, the lack of windows, {{and the quality of the}} materials used. In general, reinforced concrete-framed homes, built after the 1979 earthquake, were better able to withstand the earthquake. Those near the epicenter still sustained severe damage due to the weight of the roofs and the weak joint connections between major structural elements of the buildings.|$|E
50|$|A {{small number}} of tank {{destroyer}} battalions served in the South-West Pacific; {{due to the lack}} of Japanese armor, these were employed almost entirely in the infantry support role, effectively acting as highly mobile artillery.

40|$|Research {{has shown}} that people {{perceive}} others as <b>more</b> <b>vulnerable</b> thanthemselves <b>to</b> media communication, and their political out-group as <b>more</b> <b>vulnerable</b> thantheir political in-group. In the present study, the authors predicted that the same two biaseswould appear with respect to another kind of influence—conformity—but that participants’judgments would display a different pattern according to their political orientations. Rightwingand left-wing university {{students were asked to}} evaluate conformity and to estimatehow conformist they, their political in-group, their political out-group, and other groups are. As hypothesized, right-wingers expressed more ambivalence toward conformity and viewedit less negatively than did left-wingers. Political orientation had no impact on the discrepancybetween self and others, but it did moderate the in-group–out-group discrepancy...|$|R
50|$|According to Kaufman, this {{handicap}} is intermediate {{between the}} 6-Piece handicap {{and the usual}} 5-Piece (Right Knight) handicap mentioned above. It is a more severe handicap for White since Black's major pieces (the rook and bishop) are targeted toward White's left side. Therefore, removing White's left knight leaves White in a <b>more</b> <b>vulnerable</b> state compared <b>to</b> the Right Knight 5-Piece handicap.|$|R
