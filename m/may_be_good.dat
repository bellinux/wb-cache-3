While this <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>good</b> news in terms of conservation and demand-side management (C) objectives, it has made competitive markets unpopular among consumers and politically troublesome. For example, as consumer prices rose during Ontario's experiment with deregulation, Premier Ernie Eves, under surmounting political pressure, intervened into the market by freezing retail prices in November 2002.|$|E

Surprised by the relatively lackluster reviews Electra Heart received upon its release, Rich Juzwiak from Gawker recognized [...] "Power & Control" [...] as a highlight from its parent record; {{he felt that}} the exaggerated pronunciation of the word [...] "make" [...] in the refrain provided the track with [...] "at least half of its hookiness", and praised the line [...] "you <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>good</b> looking but you're not a piece of art" [...] as [...] "the best take-down I've heard in a pop song all year."

[...] American Book Review was critical, writing: [...] "Overall, Heins's guide to the censorship wars is biased and woefully superficial ... I do not find her arguments for free-speech absolutism either logically or legally compelling."

500|$|Starfish are {{widespread}} in the oceans, but [...] are only occasionally used as food. There <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>good</b> reason for this: the bodies of numerous species are dominated by bony ossicles, and the body wall of many species contains saponins, which have an unpleasant taste, and others contain tetrodotoxins which are poisonous. Some species that prey on bivalve molluscs can transmit paralytic shellfish poisoning. Georg Eberhard Rumpf found few starfish being used for food in the Indonesian archipelago, other than as bait in fish traps, but {{on the island of}} [...] "Huamobel" [...] the people cut them up, squeeze out the [...] "black blood" [...] and cook them with sour tamarind leaves; after resting the pieces for a day or two, they remove the outer skin and cook them in coconut milk. Starfish are sometimes eaten in China, Japan and in Micronesia.|$|E

500|$|The Lord Chancellor had, {{since the}} 15th century, been tasked with {{administering}} estates where the estate {{was to be}} used for charitable purposes. In Bailiff of Burford v Lenthall, Lord Hardwicke suggested that the jurisdiction of the Court over charity matters came from its jurisdiction over trusts, {{as well as from the}} Charitable Uses Act 1601. Carne suggests that, as the Court had long been able to deal with such situations, the 1601 act was actually just the declaration of pre-existing custom. This is illustrated by the Chancellor's original jurisdiction over feoffments to uses, which came from his original status as a clergyman, as charity had been originally enforced by the Church and the ecclesiastical courts. Essentially, an owner of land could dispose of it by granting the right to use it and collect fees to another, not just by selling it. This was not valid at the common law courts but was in the Court of Chancery; the Lord Chancellor is reported as having said, in 1492, [...] "where there is no remedy at common law there <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>good</b> remedy in conscience, as, for example, by a feoffment upon confidence, the feoffor has no remedy by common law, and yet by conscience he has; and so, if the feoffee transfers to another who knows of this confidence, the feoffor, by means of a subpoena, will have his rights in this Court". After the reign of Edward IV, if the charitable land were to be sold (or land were to be sold to create the charity) the Court of Chancery was the only place this could be done, as ecclesiastical and probate courts did not have a valid jurisdiction.|$|E
