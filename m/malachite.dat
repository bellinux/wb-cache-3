5|$|File:Pietro Perugino cat67a.jpg|In this 1503 {{painting}} by Perugino, <b>malachite</b> pigment {{was used to}} paint the bright green garments of the worshippers, while the background greens were painted in green earth pigments.|$|E
5|$|Several {{variations}} of the Maunsell green, Urie sage green and Bulleid <b>malachite</b> green liveries were tried with black, white/black, and yellow lining, some sporting a green panel on the smoke deflectors. However, from 1942 to 1946, during the Second World War, {{members of the class}} under overhaul were turned out in unlined-black livery as a wartime economy measure, with green-shaded sunshine yellow lettering. The final Southern livery used from 1946 reverted to <b>malachite</b> green, with yellow/black lining, and sunshine yellow lettering. Some of the class (Nos.782 and 800, Sir Brian and Sir Persant) did not receive this livery.|$|E
5|$|The {{pigments}} {{available to}} painters were more varied; monks in monasteries used verdigris, made by soaking copper in fermenting wine, to color medieval manuscripts. They also used finely-ground <b>malachite,</b> which made a luminous green. They used green earth colors for backgrounds.|$|E
5|$|The Hohokam {{were the}} first people known to have lived and farmed near Jerome from 700 to 1125 BCE. Later, long {{before the arrival of}} Europeans, it is likely that other native peoples mined the United Verde ore body for the {{colorful}} copper-bearing minerals <b>malachite</b> and azurite. The top of the ore body was accessible because it was visible on the surface. In 1585, Spanish explorers made note of the ore but did not mine it because their government had sent them to find gold, not copper.|$|E
5|$|In the Roman era, copper was principally mined on Cyprus, {{the origin}} of the name of the metal, from aes сyprium (metal of Cyprus), later {{corrupted}} to сuprum, from which the words copper (English), cuivre (French), Koper (Dutch) and Kupfer (German) are all derived. The commonly encountered compounds are copper(II) salts, which often impart blue or green colors to such minerals as azurite, <b>malachite,</b> and turquoise, and have been used widely and historically as pigments. Copper used in buildings, usually for roofing, oxidizes to form a green verdigris (or patina). Copper is sometimes used in decorative art, both in its elemental metal form and in compounds as pigments. Copper compounds are used as bacteriostatic agents, fungicides, and wood preservatives.|$|E
5|$|Several {{minerals}} {{used for}} paint pigments were excavated from Chetro Ketl, including charcoal, shale, <b>malachite,</b> iron oxides, hematite, limonite, gypsum, and azurite. Twined sandals, and bones from the ferruginous hawk {{and the great}} horned owl have been found there. The relative lack of exotic material uncovered at Chetro Ketl, such as shells, copper bells, and macaw feathers, may indicate its lesser importance compared to Pueblo Bonito, where those items {{have been found in}} abundance. Because Chetro Ketl has only been partially excavated definitive conclusions remain elusive. In 1937, W. W. Postlethwaite, who had for three seasons directed Hewett's excavation of Chetro Ketl's great kiva, oversaw the final work at the site conducted by the University of New Mexico and the School of American Research.|$|E
5|$|The {{greens are}} mostly verdigris, {{although}} those predominant {{in the landscape}} are mostly blends of blue and yellow pigments, and the green of the cloth worn by Mary Salome is <b>malachite</b> mixed with yellow lake. The browns are blends of reds and blacks. John's red robe is composed from cinnabar and vermilion made from rubia and insect dyes. Some of the reds are mixed with earth colours not susceptible {{to the effects of}} light, and have thus survived close to their original appearance. The black pigments are generally bone blacks but in places from charcoal. The blacks are mixed with chalk in areas, producing a red to brownish 'earthy' appearance.|$|E
5|$|Its {{main body}} is solid {{sterling}} silver and silver gilt, while its plinth {{is made of}} <b>malachite,</b> a semi-precious stone. The plinth has a silver band around its circumference, upon which {{the names of the}} title-winning clubs are listed. Malachite's green colour is also representative of the green field of play. The design of the trophy is based on the heraldry of Three Lions that is associated with English football. Two of the lions are found above the handles {{on either side of the}} trophy – the third is symbolised by the captain of the title-winning team as he raises the trophy, and its gold crown, above his head at the end of the season. The ribbons that drape the handles are presented in the team colours of the league champions that year.|$|E
5|$|Many {{minerals}} provide pigments {{which have}} been used in green paints and dyes over the centuries. Pigments, in this case, are minerals which reflect the color green, rather that emitting it through luminescent or phosphorescent qualities. The large number of green pigments makes it impossible to mention them all. Among the more notable green minerals, however is the emerald, which is colored green by trace amounts of chromium and sometimes vanadium. Chromium(III) oxide (Cr2O3), is called chrome green, also called viridian or institutional green when used as a pigment. For many years, the source of amazonite's color was a mystery. Widely thought to have been due to copper because copper compounds often have blue and green colors, the blue-green color is likely to be derived from small quantities of lead and water in the feldspar. Copper {{is the source of the}} green color in <b>malachite</b> pigments, chemically known as basic copper(II) carbonate.|$|E
5|$|The Egyptians worked {{deposits}} {{of the lead}} ore galena at Gebel Rosas to make net sinkers, plumb bobs, and small figurines. Copper {{was the most important}} metal for toolmaking in ancient Egypt and was smelted in furnaces from <b>malachite</b> ore mined in the Sinai. Workers collected gold by washing the nuggets out of sediment in alluvial deposits, or by the more labor-intensive process of grinding and washing gold-bearing quartzite. Iron deposits found in upper Egypt were utilized in the Late Period. High-quality building stones were abundant in Egypt; the ancient Egyptians quarried limestone all along the Nile valley, granite from Aswan, and basalt and sandstone from the wadis of the eastern desert. Deposits of decorative stones such as porphyry, greywacke, alabaster, and carnelian dotted the eastern desert and were collected even before the First Dynasty. In the Ptolemaic and Roman Periods, miners worked {{deposits of}} emeralds in Wadi Sikait and amethyst in Wadi el-Hudi.|$|E
25|$|From 15 to 22 March 1941 she was {{deployed}} in the Kythira Strait. On the night of March 19, <b>Malachite</b> sighted a cruiser escorted by several destroyers. At 01:19 she launched two torpedoes but they both miss. <b>Malachite</b> was forced to dive and undergo lengthy depth charge attack.|$|E
25|$|The co-smelting of oxidic and sulphidic ores such as <b>malachite</b> and {{arsenopyrite}} together.|$|E
25|$|Between 1938 and 1940 <b>Malachite</b> was {{training}} and exercising {{for long periods}} around Tobruk. Upon her return to Italy, she was assigned to 47th Squadron (IV Submarine Group) based at Taranto. At the time of Italy's entrance into World War II, <b>Malachite</b> was reassigned to the X Submarine Group based at Augusta. Her commander {{at the time was}} captain Renato d'Elia.|$|E
25|$|The {{wreck of}} <b>Malachite</b> {{was located in}} September 1999 {{at a depth of}} 117 to 124 meters.|$|E
25|$|Ancient Egyptians mined <b>malachite</b> at Maadi. At first, Egyptians {{used the}} bright green <b>malachite</b> stones for ornamentations and pottery. Later, between 2613 and 2494 BC, large {{building}} projects required expeditions abroad {{to the area}} of Wadi Maghareh in order to secure minerals and other resources not available in Egypt itself. Quarries for turquoise and copper were also found at Wadi Hammamat, Tura, Aswan and various other Nubian sites on the Sinai Peninsula and at Timna.|$|E
25|$|In Southern Railway {{days the}} O2s were painted in Maunsell lined Olive Green and then {{subsequently}} Bulleid <b>Malachite</b> Green with Sunshine lettering.|$|E
25|$|<b>Malachite</b> {{was built}} by OTO at their {{shipyard}} in Muggiano, laid on 31 August 1935 and launched on 15 July 1936.|$|E
25|$|<b>Malachite</b> {{was heading}} to her base in Cagliari, when already {{in view of}} the Sardinian coast she was spotted by the Dutch {{submarine}} HNMS Dolfijn in the morning of February 9, 1943. At approximately 11:00, HNMS Dolfijn launched a salvo of 4 torpedoes at <b>Malachite.</b> The Italian submarine managed to avoid three of them by deftly maneuvering, but the fourth one hit her on the stern, and she sank within a minute taking down 35 crew with her. Commander Cinti, three other officers, and nine NCOs and sailors managed to escape.|$|E
25|$|A study {{published}} in 2015 on the La Quinta Formation, shows the presence of 1.45 % of copper, present mainly in <b>malachite</b> mineralisations in the volcanoclastic beds of the formation.|$|E
25|$|The core of <b>malachite</b> green aptamer {{is also a}} kind of base {{quadruplex}} with {{a different}} hydrogen bonding pattern (See Figure). The quadruplex can repeat several times consecutively, producing an immensely stable structure.|$|E
25|$|On {{the night}} of June 19, 1941 while patrolling off Crete, <b>Malachite</b> sighted a British cruiser escorted by a destroyer. She {{launched}} two torpedoes at the target, but they both missed her by the stern.|$|E
25|$|From 1 June to 9 June, 1942 {{and then}} again from June 15 to 18, 1942 <b>Malachite</b> was posted {{northwest}} of Algiers. She was then relocated to patrol off Cape Blanc from 22 to 24 June.|$|E
25|$|On May 20, 1941 <b>Malachite</b> {{together}} with numerous other submarines was deployed {{to an area}} between Crete, Alexandria and Sollum, to support the German invasion of Crete (Operation Merkur). Malachites area operation was south of the island of Gaidaro.|$|E
25|$|Minerals such as gaspeite, hellyerite, otwayite, widgiemoolthalite {{and related}} hydrous nickel carbonates are {{diagnostic}} of nickel gossans, but are exceedingly rare. More usually, <b>malachite,</b> azurite, chalcocite and cobalt compounds are more persistent in boxworks and may provide diagnostic information.|$|E
25|$|From 10 to 18 April 1941 she {{was posted}} {{northeast}} of the Gulf of Sollum. At 23:37 on April 14 <b>Malachite</b> sighted a large convoy but was prevented from attacking it due to preemptive action by the escorts.|$|E
25|$|From 18 to 21 December 1940 <b>Malachite</b> patrolled {{northeast}} of Derna. On December 15, while {{en route to}} the area of operations, she was attacked by an aircraft but the attack was beaten back with her anti-aircraft weapons.|$|E
25|$|A {{high quality}} {{turquoise}} promoted as Bisbee Blue was {{a by-product of}} the copper mining. Many high-quality mineral specimens have come from Bisbee area mines and {{are to be found}} in museum collections worldwide. Some of these minerals include cuprite, aragonite, wulfenite, <b>malachite,</b> azurite, and galena.|$|E
25|$|Nos.777, D6535 and 70013 are {{all part}} of the National Collection and are owned by the National Railway Museum. No.777 emerged from a lengthy {{overhaul}} in British Railways Brunswick green livery, under the BR number 30777 and has just been refinished in Southern <b>Malachite</b> Green with running number 777.|$|E
25|$|On January 21 <b>Malachite</b> was {{deployed}} {{to an area}} between Cape Carbon and Cape Bougaroun. At 4:55 on January 22 she sighted an incoming convoy heading to Bona. At 05:18 she fired four torpedoes, and dove to avoid an attack by the escorts. Two explosions were heard, but again British post-war documents contain no mention of this attack.|$|E
25|$|After delivery, <b>Malachite</b> was {{assigned}} to the 13th Squadron based at La Spezia. In 1937 she undertook a training campaign near the Greek coast, in the Dodecanese and around Tobruk. During the Spanish Civil War, the submarine conducted a special mission between 24 August and 4 September 1937, and on August 29 she was subject to a anti-submarine search and attack.|$|E
25|$|Already, suspicions ran {{high that}} Marie had indeed {{poisoned}} her husband, but Marie seemed unfazed. While word went about regarding this, Marie {{went to her}} notary with the will, not knowing that it was invalid. Only Emma Pontier would go near her and, already torn by doubts, told Marie that Lafarge's brother-in-law {{was going to the}} police at Brive. Then the young girl took possession of Marie's <b>malachite</b> box.|$|E
25|$|The rat's tail babiana (Babiana ringens) is {{a species}} of plant that {{produces}} a strong stalk within the inflorescence {{that serves as a}} perch for the <b>malachite</b> sunbird as it visits the flower. Heliconias have special sticky threads that help in the adhesion of pollen to smooth structures such as the bill of a hummingbird. Some African orchids of the genus Disa have pollinaria that stick to the feet of visiting sunbirds.|$|E
25|$|Two of {{the first}} {{synthetic}} pigments were white lead (basic lead carbonate, (PbCO3)2Pb(OH)2) and blue frit (Egyptian Blue). White lead is made by combining lead with vinegar (acetic acid, CH3COOH) {{in the presence of}} CO2. Blue frit is calcium copper silicate and was made from glass colored with a copper ore, such as <b>malachite.</b> These pigments were used as early as the second millennium BCE Later premodern additions to the range of synthetic pigments included vermillion, verdigris and lead-tin-yellow.|$|E
25|$|Methylene blue {{is used in}} {{aquaculture}} and by tropical fish hobbyists as {{a treatment}} for fungal infections. It can also be effective in treating fish infected with ich although a combination of <b>malachite</b> green and formaldehyde is far more effective against the parasitic protozoa Ichthyophthirius multifiliis. It is usually used to protect newly laid fish eggs from being infected by fungus or bacteria. This is useful when the hobbyist wants to artificially hatch the fish eggs.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} rooms was the Palace's Grand Church (16). Granted cathedral status, it was of greater religious significance than the chapels of most European royal palaces. It was here that Romanov weddings were usually celebrated with a rigid and unchanging tradition and protocol. Even the bride's dress, and the manner of donning it, was dictated by tradition. Dressed by the Empress, the bride and her procession would pass from the <b>Malachite</b> Drawing Room to the church through the state rooms.|$|E
