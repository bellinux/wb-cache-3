40|$|AbstractThere is {{considerable}} {{interest in the}} mechanisms that drive and control the spread of morphogens in developing animals. Although much attention is given to events occurring after release from expressing cells, release itself could be an important modulator of range.

We find that, in Drosophila embryos, much Wingless (as well as a GFP-Wingless fusion protein) remains tightly associated with secreting cells. Retention occurs both within the secretory pathway and at the cell surface and requires functional heparan sulfate proteoglycans.

In this study the main aim was to characterize how the microparticle retention systems affect the retention, dewatering, and formation of a non-wood pulp furnish and how these effects and mechanisms differ when compared to normal wood pulp. The performance of several commercially available retention aids was studied by making dynamic sheet forming tests for reference and an organosolv wheat straw furnish. The emphasis in the experiments was on drainage enhancement. The maximum drainage gain obtained with the bentonite-CPAM retention aid system was about 5 %.

40|$|International audienceNumerous {{studies have}} shown that {{riparian}} wetlands are able to reduce nitrate concentration both by plant uptake and by denitrification. Although this function of nitrate removal by riparian wetlands is well established, it remains difficult to quantify, especially at the catchment scale. This paper discusses the nitrate budget approach used to estimate nitrate retention in the riparian zones and related streams. The method is applied in sub-catchments of the Seine basin using data sets available at this scale. As a result, retention rates were computed in 174 embedded catchments, each catchment being defined downstream by a well monitored measurement station of riverine nitrate concentration. Catchments receiving more than the equivalent of 20 hab/km 2 in point source pollution were excluded. The <b>mean</b> <b>of</b> <b>retention</b> rates computed over these 174 catchments is equal to 35 %, a value that is in the range <b>of</b> <b>retention</b> rates previously estimated in the Seine river basin. Interpolations of nitrate fluxes are an important source <b>of</b> <b>retention</b> rate estimate uncertainty. To assess the significance level of our results, we changed the input parameters by ± 10 %. These 10 % variations result in an uncertainty range of ± 18 % of the original rate. The statistical analysis conducted on retention rate confirmed the importance of land cover of the river corridor in the denitrification process, which is favoured by the presence of water and forest. The spatial distribution <b>of</b> <b>retention</b> rates shows a reduction <b>of</b> the <b>retention</b> variability in the most downstream catchments, which is likely linked to the nesting of the catchments.

40|$|The PDZ target motifs {{located in}} the C-terminal end of many receptors and ion {{channels}} mediate protein-protein interactions by binding to specific PDZ-containing proteins. These interactions {{are involved in the}} localization of surface proteins on specialized membrane domains of neuronal and epithelial cells. However, the molecular mechanism responsible for this PDZ protein-dependent polarized localization is still unclear. This study first demonstrated that the epithelial gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) transporter (BGT- 1) contains a PDZ target motif that mediates the interaction with the PDZ protein LIN- 7 in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells, and then investigated the role of this interaction in the basolateral localization of the transporter. It was found that although the transporters from which the PDZ target motif was deleted were still targeted to the basolateral surface, they were not retained but internalized in an endosomal recycling compartment. Furthermore, an interfering BGT peptide determined the intracellular relocation of the native transporter. These data indicate that interactions with PDZ proteins determine the polarized surface localization of target proteins by <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>retention</b> and not targeting mechanisms. PDZ proteins may, therefore, act as a sort of membrane protein sorting machinery which, by recognizing retention signals (the PDZ target sequences), prevents protein internalization...|$|E
40|$|Large maxillofacial defects from {{malignant}} tumor {{treatment are}} rarely rehabilitated by surgical reconstruction alone. Ameloblastic carcinoma, a rare aggressive odontogenic malignant tumor, requires wide surgical excision {{to gain a}} tumor-free margin. In the post-surgical defect, prosthetic rehabilitation is the treatment of choice to restore function and esthetics. Moreover, an intra-oral prosthesis such as an obturator restores speech, mastication and deglutition. Retention of the obturator {{is a major problem}} while rehabilitating large defects. The existing anatomical structures from the defect with the help of magnet attachments are suitable to enhance retention, stability and support of the prostheses. This case report presents a patient with an intraoral and extra-oral combination defect following surgical resection of ameloblastic carcinoma and describes the prosthetic techniques and design considerations for a magnet-retained obturator and mid-facial prosthesis. An implant-retained mid-facial prosthesis was fabricated. The retention of combined prostheses was obtained from the remaining right posterior teeth only. The patient had an unfavorable defect due to the large size and presence of scar contracture that vertically tends to dislodge the obturator. Magnet attachments were used to combine the facial and oral prosthesis, minimize the vertical dislodging forces and enhance retention. In addition, the retention was also gained from the scar band at lower border of mid-facial defect that avoided the need for more implants surgery.

Moreover, overviews of the retention chemicals and methods for retention measurement were done; special attention was paid to the mechanisms of retention and drainage. Finally, factors affecting on the drainage and retention of non-wood pulps were considered holistically. Particular emphasis was put on the possibility of enzyme treatment for drainage improvement. It was stated that retention aids can significantly improve dewatering of non-wood pulps. In the experimental part the goal was to investigate influence of various microparticle retention aids on the drainage, retention and formation of furnish containing wheat straw pulp, obtained by novel pulping process (Formico™Fib). The parallel test were performed with reference furnish containing only wood pulps.

The sample for the study was 1, 296 first-year students enrolled at the University of Texas at San Antonio during the 2002, 2003, and 2004 academic years. Data used for the study included student responses to the Cooperative Institutional Research Program (CIRP) : Freshman Survey (to identify each participant?s Astin type), gender, ethnicity, SAT scores, rank in high school class, first-generation status, financial need, first-semester residence, entry-college, semester credit hours attempted, academic course difficulty, participation in Supplemental Instruction, and enrollment in a first-year seminar course. Both descriptive and univariate statistics were used to describe the sample population, as well as the similarities and differences found to exist among the seven Astin types. Three separate logistic regression analyses organized by Astin?s I-E-O framework were conducted to develop a predictive model for retention from the first-to-second year of college. Subsequent analyses were conducted to identify the specific factors that were useful for predicting retention for each of the seven Astin types. The major findings of this study were: ? The most frequent Astin type identified within the sample population was Status Striver ? The model that included both Input and Environmental factors was the most accurate model for predicting retention ? Students who were classified as Hedonist, Status Striver, and Uncommitted were less likely to be retained at this institution when all other input and environmental factors were controlled. ? Environmental factors were most useful for predicting retention, in particular, semester credit hours attempted that had an inverse relationship with retention for all Astin types ?

40|$|Most sample-enrichment {{procedures}} {{currently available}} rely on adsorption of the analytes of interest by a suitable adsorbent material. Although good performance {{can be obtained}} for many practical problems, {{in some cases the}} applicability of adsorptive sample preparation falls short, particularly for the enrichment of polar and/or high-molecular-weight compounds, especially in combination with thermal desorption. Because of the very strong <b>retention</b> <b>of</b> adsorbent materials, undesired effects such as incomplete desorption and artifact formation are observed. Polar solutes are easily adsorbed but readily undergo surface-catalyzed reactions and on desorption yield compounds different than those originally sampled. High-molecular-weight compounds cannot be desorbed because of extremely strong interactions with the adsorbent and their low volatility. To overcome some of these problems sample-preparation techniques based on polydimethylsiloxane sorption have been developed over the past 15 years. In contrast with adsorptive trapping, sorption is based on dissolution of the analytes in a liquid polymeric material. This is a much more inert <b>means</b> <b>of</b> solute <b>retention</b> which overcomes some of the limitations encountered when working with adsorbents. In this contribution, the basic principles of sorption, the different instrumentation used, and applications of the technique will be reviewed. The review covers the sorptive sample-preparation techniques, open-tubular trapping (OTT), solid-phase microextraction (SPME), gum-phase extraction (GPE), equilibrium gum-phase extraction (EGPE), and stir-bar-sorptive extraction (SBSE). Because of the nature of sorptive sample-preparation techniques, which perform particularly well in combination with thermal desorption, this review focuses strongly on gas chromatography as the <b>means</b> <b>of</b> chemical analysis...|$|R
40|$|This study aims to {{evaluate}} the role of surface treatments performed on plain carbon fiber posts, in relation to serrated carbon fiber posts, in the <b>retention</b> <b>of</b> the composite core. Fifty carbon fiber posts received surface treatments in order to verify their influence on the <b>retention</b> <b>of</b> the core material. An acrylic resin mold was developed in order to precisely fit the post, leaving a machined space to accommodate a self-curing composite resin. After the surface treatment, a primer was applied on the coronal portion of all posts, which were then dried. They were fitted to the mold and received a 3 mm composite core. All specimens were thermocycled and then stored in distilled water for a week. Tension test was performed at a speed of 0. 5 mm/min until there was lack of adhesion or fracture of the core. The conclusions were: a) the values <b>of</b> <b>retention</b> related to aluminum oxide spray (group A), depth cutter diamond burs (group C) and posts with machined coronal portion (group D) were {{comparable to those of}} serrated posts (group E), although no statistically significant difference between these groups was found; b) the <b>mean</b> values <b>of</b> core <b>retention</b> in group B (medium grit diamond burs) were statistically lower than those of other groups...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: There {{is limited}} {{data on the}} factors {{affecting}} the <b>retention</b> <b>of</b> cemented fixed prostheses to implant abutment. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the effect of screw access channel filling method and cement type on <b>retention</b> <b>of</b> implant-supported fixed restorations.   Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, 40 implant analogs were mounted in autopolymerizing acrylic resin blocks, and two-piece titanium abutments were placed in each implant analog. Twenty abutment samples were completely filled with silicone, and 20 other samples were filled partially. In each of the study groups, Temp Bond® eugenol-containing temporary cement was used for 10 samples, while in another 10 samples non-eugenol temporary cements were utilized. Prior to the retention test, samples were placed in the rmocycling machine with 1000 cycles for 24 h. Each sample was stretched using a Universal Pull-out Test Machine with a force of 5000 N. The required load for removing the crown was recorded. The data was analyzed USING two-way ANOVA and least square difference (α= 0. 05). Results: Among the four groups, the highest retention rate was observed in the group of partial screw access channel filling with eugenol cement. Also, the rate <b>of</b> <b>retention</b> in the group of complete screw access channel filling with non-eugenol cement was significantly lower than in any other group. A significant difference was observed between all the groups except for the groups of complete screw access channel filling with eugenol cement and partial screw access channel filling with non-eugenol cement (P= 0. 27). Conclusion: The <b>mean</b> rate <b>of</b> <b>retention</b> in partial access cavity filling group was greater than that of the complete access cavity filling group; moreover, this rate was higher in the eugenol cement group than the non-eugenol cement group...|$|R
40|$|The rate of gastric {{emptying}} of two antacids, magaldrate and Maalox, {{was investigated}} using scintigraphy. Successful labelling of the antacids {{was carried out}} with 99 mTc. The stability of the 99 mTc-labelled antacids was satisfactory {{and there was no}} difference in antacid capacity between the labelled and unlabelled antacids. The studies were carried out on 15 healthy male volunteers. After an eight hour fast each subject ingested a standardised meal of 95. 7 MJ (400 kcal). One hour later 10 ml of one of the two antacids previously labelled with 99 mTc was administered. Serial detection by anterior and posterior projection of the amount of antacid retained in the stomach was performed to determine gastric emptying of antacid. One week later the study was repeated under the same conditions with the other antacid also labelled with 99 mTc. The <b>mean</b> (SD) percentages <b>of</b> antacid retained in the stomach fit a linear model with a t 1 / 2 of 86. 6 (15. 3) minutes for magaldrate and 52. 3 (5. 2) minutes for Maalox (p less than 0. 01). When the <b>mean</b> percentages <b>of</b> <b>retention</b> at six time intervals were compared for both antacids, it was found that Maalox emptied much faster (p less than 0. 01 at 15 and 30 minutes, p less than 0. 02 at 45, 60, 75, and 90 minutes) ...|$|R
