40|$|This {{research}} work describes {{development of a}} glazed red clay cookware body with adequate thermal shock resistance. Two red clay deposits were investigated (Malwana and Hambanthota region) which are currently used for pottery industry. X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD), chemical analysis, differential thermal analysis (DTA) and scanning electron microscopic investigation (SEM) {{were used to determine}} the clay properties. Thermal compatibility of red clay and different fritted glazes were investigated using thermal expansion and thermal shock resistance of individual body/glaze components. This investigation revealed that the coefficient of thermal expansion of red clay was lower than all tested glazes. Therefore it was difficult to formulate a suitable glaze to match the red clay body. Quartz was incorporated into red clay to increase the thermal expansion of the body. According to the results, thermal shock resistance decreased with increasing quartz content of the body. The thermal shock resistance and coefficient of thermal expansion of red clay body were investigated with different proportions of quartz asl 0 %, 20 %, 30 %, 35 % and 40 % at a firing temperature of 10500 C and isothermal holding time 30 minutes. The behaviours of the thermal conductivity, thermal shock resistance and important mechanical properties such as modulus of rupture and modulus of elasticity of each formulated body were studied. The results revealed that thermal conductivity increased with increasing quartz content of the body. Modulus of rupture and modulus of elasticity were decreased with increasing quartz content of the body. Initially to preserve the red colour appearance of the product, it was decided to use a transparent glaze and three transparent glazes were investigated. Coefficients of thermal expansion of these transparent glazes were theoretically compatible with body composition having a quartz content of 30 %. Actual size cookware samples were fabricated and required properties were tested under actual domestic conditions. But they were not successful on direct heating test. Body compositions with 35 % and 40 % quartz were investigated and they also gave the same results. Hence it was necessary to develop a body with better thermal shock resistance having low quartz content. For this purpose glaze with low coefficient of thermal expansion was required and a semi <b>matt</b> <b>glaze</b> was selected by partially sacrificing the red colour appearance of the body. Malwana red clay body with 25 % quartz hewing a coefficient of thermal expansion 60. 31 xl 0 · 7 x' and thermal shock resistance 0. 97 kJ m- 1 s- 1 and the glazes having coefficient of thermal expansion in the range of (49 - 51) xl 0 - 7 K- 1 and thermal shock resistance in the range of (1. 10 - 1. 20) kJ m- 1 s- 1 could be effectively used to manufacture a glazed red clay cookware product. It can be concluded that a suitable body composition for glazed cookware production could be formulated by incorporating quartz in correct proportion to kaolinitic type red clay.

Output ranged from animals (including mice, cats, dogs, sheep, pigs, birds, fish and mythological creatures) to humans (including schoolchildren, judicial figures and classical busts) together with more practical tableware (throwing or moulding primarily by Richard). Highly stylised, distorted, flattened or elongated forms were finished with Susan's monochromatic graphic designs achieved with wax resist techniques, brown and later green-black pigments and gloss or <b>matt</b> <b>glazes.</b> At its peak, {{there were several}} assistants, production took place around the clock and Parkinson Pottery was being sold not only in British department stores such as Heal's, Liberty, and Dunns of Bromley but across the Atlantic in America.|$|R
5000|$|Early pieces at the Pottery closely {{reflected}} {{the arts and}} crafts era in which the Pottery was operating. The pottery often depicted Louisiana's local flora, done in blue, yellow and green high glazes. The high point of Newcomb is generally considered to be from 1897 to 1917. During that period the Pottery experimented with various glazes and designs, and won numerous awards at various exhibitions throughout the country and in Europe. As the school entered the 1920s, new professors arrived and began to introduce influences from the 1913 International Exhibition of Modern Art. Highly carved pieces done in <b>matt</b> <b>glazes</b> of blue, green and pink marked this period. Perhaps {{one of the most famous}} Newcomb Pottery designs, the [...] "Moon & Moss" [...] style was introduced in this period.|$|R

40|$|In the paper, the lime-barium and lime-zinc glazes used in Southern and Eastern Africa Mineral Center (SEAMIC) {{ceramic unit}} in Tanzania were {{investigated}} {{for the production}} of high temperature raw glazes in Cameroon. The base Seger formula used was 0. 3 KNaO, 0. 3 CaO, 0. 4 ZnO or BaO; xAl 2 O 3 and ySiO 2 . Different Al 2 O 3 /SiO 2 formula ratios for glossy and <b>matt</b> <b>glazes</b> were tested with raw materials from Cameroon and Tanzania. In the Cameroonian glazes, a local pegmatite (quartz, microcline, albite) with low coloured oxides replaced an albitic feldspar in the Tanzanian glazes. The other materials were kaolin, limestone, silica and barium carbonate or zinc oxide. The glazes were tested at Seger Cone 7 (1240 ℃) on stoneware slabs (made up of the same feldspathic glaze material: 18 %, silica sand or quartz 27 %, ball clay 40 % and kaolin 15 %) from both Tanzania and Cameroon materials. From results obtained, zinc oxide acted as a more vigorous flux than barium carbonate at cone 7, which is obvious in the glazes with pegmatite (with high quartz content). At a Seger formula of Al 2 O 3 /SiO 2 1 : 10, transparent glazes were obtained. In these glazes the alumina content was lower and when increased to higher Seger ratios 1 : 4. 7 - 8. 7, the gloss was lowered to matt-luster due to fine crystal formation...|$|R
40|$|It {{is widely}} known that {{ready-made}} glazes are hugely expensive, {{in spite of}} their widespread availability in Oman. Most students of ceramic art, at various levels of education, depend on foreign materials rather than local materials, which has resulted in high production costs. As an environmentally diverse country, Oman has great potential to take advantage of local crop waste plant waste by using it to make attractive ceramic glazes. Ann experimental study conducted at the ceramic studio in Sultan Qaboos University (SQU) {{led to the development of}} some excellent recipes for ceramic glazes using 20 % to 30 % ash. This study has helped to convert Omani plant waste into textured <b>matt</b> ceramic <b>glazes,</b> which are otherwise expensive to procure for educational and commercial purposes...|$|R
50|$|The {{new design}} team was quickly put into action {{designing}} new earthenware dinnerware shapes and patterns {{to be included}} in the Gladding, McBean & Co.’s 1954 Franciscan Ware marketing promotion Modern Americana. The Modern Americana promotion included a group of seven new patterns on three different shapes, to compliment Franciscan’s popular hand-painted embossed dinnerware lines; Apple, Desert Rose, and Ivy. Two new lines with unique shapes were designed for Modern Americana; the 1800 Eclipse shape designed by George T. James and the 1900 Flair shape designed by Mary Jane Winans. The only shape not designed for Modern Americana was the Metropolitan shape. The Metropolitan shape was designed for Gladding, McBean & Co. by Morris B. Sanders {{to be included in}} the Metropolitan Museum of Art's 1940 Exhibition of Contemporary American Industrial Art. The shape was adapted into a dinnerware line sold by the company as the <b>matt</b> <b>glazed</b> Metropolitan Service from 1940-42. From 1948-54, the shapes were sold in gloss glazes as the dinnerware line Tiempo. Surface patterns for the Modern Americana dinnerware group were Eclipse White, Pomegranate, and Starburst on the Eclipse shape; Flair White, Echo, and Woodlore on the Flair shape; and Trio on the Metropolitan shape. Mary C. Brown, a contract designer, designed the surface patterns Starburst and Pomegranate for the Eclipse shape. For the Flair shape, Brown designed the surface pattern Echo and Woodlore was designed by the contract design group, The Millers. George T. James’ wife Esta James, a ceramist whose ceramics were exhibited at The Egg & The Eye gallery in Los Angeles, designed the surface pattern Trio for the Metropolitan shape. The Modern American group of dinnerware patterns was marketed in the company’s promotions in 1954; however the promotion of this grouping ceased in 1955 with all the patterns being folded into the general earthenware lines sold by the Company.|$|R
