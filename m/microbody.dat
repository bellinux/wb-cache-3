40|$|Abstract. The diaminobenzidine {{method for}} {{catalase}} showed two distinct morphologi-cal populations of renal <b>microbodies</b> in healthy mature cats of both sexes. <b>Microbodies</b> in the proximal convoluted tubules, {{which in this}} species also contain abundant neutral lipids, were polyhedral and had distinct marginal plates. Those in the remaining renal tubules, which are lipid-free, were rounder and less uniform in size. Both forms of micro-bodies had homogenous granular matrices without nucleoids. The morphological varia-tions of the <b>microbodies</b> may depend on their association with renal lipids. The cat {{may serve as a}} model to explore functional or pathological relationships between <b>microbodies</b> and fat metabolism. It is now well established that <b>microbodies</b> (peroxisomes) are a distinct group of membrane-bound cytoplasmic structures that contain oxidative-reductive enzymes [3, 101. They have been shown to vary morphologically depending on the animal species or the organ, or both, in which they are found [lo, 1 I].

40|$|In hepatocytes {{of fetal}} rats, cytoplasmic organelles {{identifiable}} as <b>microbodies</b> appeared, although {{only a few}} of them showed nucleoids and most of them generally had an electronlucent appearance due to the low density of their matrices. Some of these <b>microbodies,</b> especially those lacking the nucleoid, showed a substantial connection with granular endoplasmic reticulum (ER), suggesting that <b>microbodies</b> might be formed from granular ER. Agranular tubular profiles projecting from the surface of <b>microbodies</b> were found with a high frequency in fetal and neonatal rats; however, this phenomenon may not provide crucial evidence suggestive of the derivation of <b>microbodies</b> from agranular ER. Growth and maturation of <b>microbodies</b> are considered to be brought about by an enlargement of these organelles, an increase in their matrices, an appearance and enlargement of the nucleoids, and an increase in the enzyme involved. The specific activity of urate oxidase in the isolated nucleoid fraction was significantly lower in the earlier stages of postnatal growth than later. Increases in the enzyme activity per nucleoid (maturation of the nucleoid), in the number of <b>microbodies</b> containing nucleoids (formation of the nucleoid), and in the size of nucleoids (growth of the nucleoid), may contribute to increases in the enzyme activity of the tissues...|$|R

40|$|Male {{wild-type}} mice (Csa strain) {{were treated}} with ethyl-α-p-chlorophenoxyisobutyrate (CPIB), a hypolipidemic drug which enhances hepatic catalase synthesis and induces rapid and {{significant increase in the}} number of <b>microbody</b> (peroxisome) profiles in liver cells. Numerous <b>microbody</b> profiles, several of them appearing in clusters and retaining membranous continuities, were observed in liver cells of CPIB-treated mice. They showed a significant variation in size and configuration, and the presence or absence of the nucleoid or core did not appear to bear any relation to the size or shape of <b>microbody</b> profiles. Nucleoids were encountered frequently in <b>microbody</b> profiles measuring as small as 0. 1 μ in diameter. Numerous continuities between two or more anucleoid and/or nucleoid-containing <b>microbody</b> profiles of different sizes and shapes were seen. These findings are inconsistent with the concept that the smaller peroxisomes are the possible precursors or progenitors of their larger counterparts. Detailed examination of numerous electron micrographs revealed irregular dilatations and tortuosities of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) containing electron-opaque peroxisomal material displaying the characteristic appearance of matrix and usually containing irregular cores. Transitions of rough ER to smooth ER in which <b>microbody</b> proteins accumulated were also apparent. Numerous continuities between several <b>microbody</b> profiles and continuities between <b>microbody</b> profiles and ER are interpreted as accumulations of peroxisomal proteins in dilated tortuous channels of ER. These observations strongly suggest that the <b>microbody</b> proteins constitute a common pool, circulating constantly in the dilated ER channels. The size, shape and number of <b>microbody</b> profiles appear to reflect the amount of peroxisomal proteins present in the pool.

In all groups of animals, administration of nafenopin at dietary levels of 0. 125 % and 0. 25 % produced a significant and sustained {{increase in the number}} of peroxisomes. The hepatic <b>microbody</b> proliferation in both male and female rats and wild type Csa strain mice treated with nafenopin was of the same magnitude and was associated with a two-fold increase in catalase activity and in the concentration of catalase protein. The increase in <b>microbody</b> population in acatalasemic mice, although not accompanied by increase in catalase activity, was associated with a twofold increase in the amount of catalase protein. The absence of sex difference in <b>microbody</b> proliferative response in nafenopin-treated rats and wild type mice is of particular significance, since ethyl-α-p-chlorophenoxyisobutyrate (CPIB) -induced <b>microbody</b> proliferation and increase in catalase activity occurred only in males. Nafenopin can, therefore, be used as an inducer of <b>microbody</b> proliferation and of catalase synthesis in both sexes of rats and mice. The serum glycerol-glycerides were markedly lowered in all the animals given nafenopin, which paralleled the increase in liver catalase. All the above effects of nafenopin were fully reversed when the drug was withdrawn from the diet of male rats. During reversal, several <b>microbody</b> nucleoids were seen free in the hyaloplasm or in the dilated endoplasmic reticulum channels resulting from a rapid reduction in <b>microbody</b> matrix proteins after the withdrawal of nafenopin from the diet.

Thyroidectomy abolishes the hypolipidemic effect of CPIB in rats, but <b>microbody</b> proliferation and increase in catalase activity persists in thyroidectomized male rats, indicating that <b>microbody</b> proliferation can be independent of hypolipidemia. Adrenalectomy does not alter appreciably the microbody-catalase response to CPIB. These experiments demonstrate that (1) in adult rats, hepatic <b>microbody</b> proliferation is dependent to a significant degree upon male sex hormone but is largely independent of thyroid or adrenal gland hormones; (2) hepatic <b>microbody</b> proliferation is independent of the hypolipidemic effect of CPIB; (3) displacement of thyroxine from serum protein may not be sufficient cause for stimulation of <b>microbody</b> formation...|$|E

A study employing light-grown seedlings showed that when the leaves are still below ground and achlorophyllous, <b>microbodies</b> are present as small organelles (e. g., 0. 3 µm in diameter) associated with endoplasmic reticulum, and that after the leaves have turned green and expanded fully, the <b>microbodies</b> occur as much larger organelles (e. g., 1. 5 µm in diameter) associated with chloroplasts. Specific activities of the peroxisomal enzymes increase 3 - to 10 -fold during this period.

This conclusion is based on electrophoretic behavior, chromatographic elution from DEAE-cellulose, molecular weight, kinetic behavior, and immunological identity. In most cases, the distinct {{properties of}} the other MDH isozymes in the tissue during development provide additional support for an unchanging <b>microbody</b> isozyme.

Deposition of oxidized DAB occurred only in <b>microbodies</b> {{due to the}} presence of catalase, and in cell walls associated with peroxidase activity. Seedling development paralleled the disappearance of spherosomes (lipid bodies) and matrix of aleurone grains in endosperm cells. 6 to 7 days after germination, a cross-section through the endosperm contained cells in all stages of development and senescence beginning at the seed coat and progressing inward to the cotyledons. Part of this aging process involved vacuole formation by fusion of aleurone grain membranes. This coincided with an increase in <b>microbodies</b> (glyoxsomes), mitochondria, plastids with an elaborate tubular network, and the formation of a new protein body referred to as a dilated cisterna, which is structurally and biochemically distinct from <b>microbodies</b> although both apparently develop from rough endoplasmic reticulum (ER).
