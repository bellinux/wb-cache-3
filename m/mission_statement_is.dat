40|$|Objective: This paper’s {{objective}} {{was to examine the}} <b>mission</b> <b>statements</b> of the sponsoring boards and professional organizations of the primary care specialties. Methods: <b>Mission</b> <b>statements</b> <b>were</b> obtained from the Web sites of the specialty boards and academies {{for each of the four}} primary care specialties of pediatrics, obstetrics-gynecology, general internal medicine, and family medicine. The <b>mission</b> <b>statements</b> <b>were</b> analyzed by two investigators, and the components of each <b>mission</b> <b>statement</b> <b>were</b> identified and categorized. Results: There were 29 distinct characteristics defined among all the <b>mission</b> <b>statements.</b> Three of the four primary care specialty organizations listed 10 components, while the American Academy of Pediatrics contained the fewest, with three components. The most commonly named characteristics were commitment to public health and education along with assuring high-quality standards. There was little overlap among the <b>mission</b> <b>statements.</b> Several qualities listed by the Institute of Medicine were not included in the <b>mission</b> <b>statements</b> and three—patient trust, integration of services, and personalized treatment—were missing from all sources. Conclusions: The <b>mission</b> <b>statements</b> of the primary care specialties vary widely in their values and goals.

40|$|Background: This study {{investigated}} which concepts regarding “the good life” <b>are</b> used in <b>mission</b> <b>statements</b> {{of nursing homes}} providing care for demented patients. Method: All 317 Dutch nursing homes caring for demented patients were asked to participate; of these, 69 % responded. Their <b>mission</b> <b>statements</b> <b>were</b> qualitatively analyzed on content. Whether different types of nursing home differed significantly {{in the content of}} their <b>mission</b> <b>statements</b> <b>was</b> investigated by means of χ 2 analyses. Results: Six main concepts were found that are considered important for a good life: 1) autonomy and freedom, 2) individuality and lifestyle, 3) relationships and social networks, 4) warmth and safety and familiarity, 5) developing capacities and giving meaning to life and 6) subjective experience and feelings of well-being. It <b>was</b> found that <b>mission</b> <b>statements</b> specifically developed for demented patients attach less importance to the concepts 1) autonomy and freedom and 2) individuality and lifestyle, than <b>mission</b> <b>statements</b> which <b>are</b> also aimed at non-demented residents. Most <b>mission</b> <b>statements</b> turned out to be highly eclectic in content. Conclusion: Nursing homes with a separate statement for demented residents seem to acknowledge the special position of demented residents and the tension between dementia and the ideal of autonomy. Although the eclecticism found in <b>mission</b> <b>statements</b> <b>is</b> understandable, a coherent view on the good life for demented residents should aim for a sound internal structure, and make choices between values. Only then can <b>mission</b> <b>statements</b> provide real guidance for everyday care...|$|R
