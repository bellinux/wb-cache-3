30|$|Fraser (1996) {{classified}} pragmatic <b>markers</b> in four subtypes: basic <b>markers</b> (<b>markers</b> {{signaling the}} force of the basic message); commentary <b>markers</b> (<b>markers</b> commenting on some aspect of the basic message); parallel <b>markers</b> (<b>markers</b> signaling an entire message in addition to the basic message); discourse <b>markers</b> (expressions marking the relationship between the messages). Then, Fraser (1997) provided a categorization of commentary <b>markers,</b> including assessment, manner of speaking, evidential, perlocutionary, mitigation, and emphasis <b>markers.</b> Erman (2001) recognized three domains for pragmatic markers: Textual-monitors, social monitors, and meta-linguistic monitors. Text-monitors include discourse <b>markers,</b> and editing <b>markers.</b> Editing <b>markers</b> in turn included repair and hesitation <b>markers.</b> Social monitors also involve Interactive <b>markers</b> and comprehension securing <b>markers.</b> Metalinguistic monitors include approximators, hedges, emphasisers.|$|R

30|$|In total, 113 (50.45  %) of the 224 tested SRAP primer pairs {{generated}} 320 polymorphic <b>markers</b> in the F 1 population. Of the 320 <b>markers,</b> 209 (65.31  %) and 111 (34.69  %) segregated in 1 : 1 and 3 : 1 ratios, respectively. Among the 209 <b>markers</b> with a 1 : 1 ratio, 150 (71.77  %) {{originated from}} the female parent and 59 (28.23  %) originated from the male parent (Table  3). The number of polymorphic <b>markers</b> per primer combination ranged from 1 to 5, {{with an average}} of 2.83.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the discourse <b>markers</b> used by 104 elementary-level prep class students studying at Namık Kemal University in Turkey. Students were required to write a paragraph with 80 - 100 words as part of their mid-term exam in the academic year of 2013 - 2014. A small-size corpus was constructed by using these writings. The corpus was analyzed via a software program called as AntConc 3. 2. 4. in order to find out the types and frequency of discourse <b>markers.</b> It was revealed that 180 discourse <b>markers</b> were used by elementary-level students: ‘and’ was used 98 times, but occurred 51 times, ‘because’ was written 18 times and other discourse <b>markers</b> of ‘then’, ‘so’, ‘also’, ‘too’ and ‘still’ were used 7, 2, 2, 1, 1 times respectively. Furthermore, according to Fraser’s (1999) taxonomy of discourse <b>markers,</b> 180 discourse <b>markers</b> were grouped into four categories. It was found out that 101 <b>markers</b> were elaborative <b>markers,</b> 52 were contrastive <b>markers,</b> 18 were causative <b>markers</b> and 9 were inferential <b>markers...</b>|$|R

40|$|Biological <b>markers</b> for {{depression}} are {{of great interest}} to aid in elucidating the causes of major depression. We assess currently available biological <b>markers</b> to query their validity for aiding in the diagnosis of major depression. We specifically focus on neurotrophic factors, serotonergic <b>markers,</b> biochemical <b>markers,</b> immunological <b>markers,</b> neuroimaging, neurophysiological findings, and neuropsychological <b>markers.</b> We delineate the most robust biological <b>markers</b> of major depression. These include decreased platelet imipramine binding, decreased 5 -HT 1 A receptor expression, increase of soluble interleukin- 2 receptor and interleukin- 6 in serum, decreased brain-derived neurotrophic factor in serum, hypocholesterolemia, low blood folate levels, and impaired suppression of the dexamethasone suppression test. To date, however, none of these <b>markers</b> are sufficiently specific to contribute to the diagnosis of major depression. Thus, with regard to new diagnostic manuals such as DSM-V and ICD- 11 which are currently assessing whether biological <b>markers</b> may be included in diagnostic criteria, no biological <b>markers</b> for major depression are currently available for inclusion in the diagnostic criteria...|$|R
40|$|This study {{reports on}} a number of highly {{significant}} differences found between English, German, and Dutch hesitation <b>markers.</b> English and German native speakers used significantly more vocalic-nasal hesitation <b>markers</b> than Dutch native speakers, who used predominantly vocalic hesitation <b>markers.</b> English hesitation <b>markers</b> occurred most frequently when preceded by silence and followed by a lexical item, or when surrounded by silence. German and Dutch hesitation <b>markers</b> occurred most frequently surrounded by lexical items. In Dutch, vocalic-nasal hesitation <b>markers</b> dominated only when surrounded by silence. Vocalic-nasal hesitation <b>markers</b> dominated in all positions in English and German, although in the former language this was more salient than in the latter. Nasal hesitation <b>markers</b> were used significantly more frequently in German than in English or Dutch. In addition to overall language trends, speaker-specific differences, especially within German and Dutch, were observed. These results raise questions in terms of the symptom versus signal hypotheses regarding the function of hesitation <b>markers.</b> * 1. The Function of Hesitation <b>Markers...</b>|$|R

40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} identify <b>markers</b> linked to Fusarium wilt disease resistance, Parents namely TTB 7 and ICP 8863 were screened using 151 SSRs <b>markers</b> and 16 AFLP primer combinations. Parental screening revealed five SSR primers and 12 AFLP primer combinations polymorphic between parents. Bulk segregant analysis identified five AFLP primer combinations generating seven <b>markers</b> polymorphic between resistant and susceptible bulks while, none of the SSR <b>markers</b> were polymorphic. This indicates that, these <b>markers</b> are putatively linked to wilt disease. Screening of F 2 segregating population of cross TTB 7 x ICP 8863 with these putatively linked <b>markers</b> revealed four <b>markers</b> (E-AAT/M-CTG 850, ETCG/M-CTT 650, E-TCG/M-CTA 730 and E-TCG/M-CTT 230) which segregated in 3 : 1 mendelian pattern.
