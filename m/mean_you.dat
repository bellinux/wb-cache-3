25|$|These {{qualifications}} {{are deemed}} {{to be at a}} higher AQF level than a bachelor and generally <b>mean</b> <b>you</b> have graduated from a bachelor prior to undertaking studies. Therefore, you usually require a completed bachelor's degree or higher to gain entry or have significant skills and abilities in the field of study meaning that technically you have completed the requirements to exceed a bachelor through your work experience. Certificates take months to complete, while Diplomas take 12 months.|$|E
25|$|In fact, it was Black {{who was the}} {{original}} target of the Pittsburgh Pirates' June 1, 1954 scouting trip to Richmond. Conducted by pitching coach Clyde Sukeforth, the mission's focus quickly shifted when he witnessed Clemente's throwing and batting prowess in pre-game drills. Nonetheless, Clemente barely played during Sukeforth's three-day visit. With his suspicions further aroused by manager Max Macon's dismissive remarks ("You <b>mean</b> <b>you</b> want him?!") {{and the fact that}} Clemente took batting practice with the pitchers rather than his fellow position players, Sukeforth made inquiries and soon ascertained Clemente's status as an unprotected bonus baby. Before leaving Richmond, he informed Macon that such subterfuge was pointless since the Pirates, well {{on their way to a}} fourth consecutive last-place finish, would thereby secure first pick in the winter draft.|$|E
25|$|While {{promoting}} the band's 2013 box set, Sound System, which Jones says {{will be the}} final time he works on Clash music, he discussed the band reuniting prior to Strummer's death.There were a few moments at the time I was up for it (Hall of Fame reunion in 2003), Joe was up for it. Paul wasn't. And neither, probably, was Topper Headon, who didn't wind up even coming in the end. It didn't look like a performance {{was going to happen}} anyway. I <b>mean,</b> <b>you</b> usually play at that ceremony when you get in. Joe had passed by that point, so we didn't. We were never in agreement. It was never at a point where all of us wanted to do it at the same time. Most importantly for us, we became friends again after the group broke up, and continued that way {{for the rest of the}} time. That was more important to us than the band.|$|E

500|$|The {{presence}} of the RLI's two conflicting reputations—excellent in the field, but appalling at home—is evident from the line of reporting taken by The Rhodesia Herald on 25 July 1975. Alongside the front-page article announcing the award and the day's parade through Salisbury, there prominently appears a cartoon satirising the RLI's off-duty antics. Two RLI officers in dress uniform are portrayed in a Salisbury street, both turning angrily to see a uniformed RLI trooper chasing a crowd of terrified, screaming young women across the road. One of the officers barks his disapproval, which is spelt out in the caption underneath: [...] "Freedom of the City doesn't <b>mean</b> <b>you</b> can do that, Van Schalkwyk!" ...|$|E

Which is amazing, I <b>mean</b> <b>you</b> don't usually get that with a pilot, because they're sort of sight unseen." [...] There were reports of two WB pilots in contention for the new CW network, one being Aquaman, which was a frontrunner. On May 18, 2006, when The CW announced its fall lineup Aquaman was not on the list. Dawn Ostroff, The CW's president of entertainment, stated that it was still a midseason contender.|$|E

Lawrence was the most highly regarded young saxophonist at the time, while Gaumont was enlisted by Davis in response to incumbent guitarist Reggie Lucas's demand for a pay raise. Although it was unexpected, Liebman later characterized the move as typical of the trumpeter: [...] "What he was doing—which he often does at big kinda gigs like that—is change the shit up, by doing something totally out. Totally unexpected. I mean, we had been a band together {{on the road for}} a year...

The vehicle headlights were turned on to provide a possible ignition source. The fuel tank was completely filled with gasoline rather than partially filled with non-flammable Stoddard fluid as was the normal test procedure.

[...] This comment undermined his campaign as soon as it began and significantly damaged his fund-raising capabilities; it later took second place on Time magazine's list of Top 10 Campaign Gaffes for 2007. Biden had earlier been criticized in July 2006 for a remark he made about his support among Indian Americans: [...] "I've had a great relationship. In Delaware, the largest growth in population is Indian-Americans moving from India. You cannot go to a 7-Eleven or a Dunkin' Donuts unless you have a slight Indian accent. I'm not joking." [...] Biden later said the remark was not intended to be derogatory.|$|E

Inventure added a third flavor, onion rings, in 2008. A second licensed product, the company's child-oriented BK Fresh Apple Fries, was licensed for sale in supermarkets in 2009 to the Cruch Pak company. The company stated that while the products are important in providing brand identity, they will not be concentrating their resources on them, and will be investing the licensing fees into the company's marketing fund.
