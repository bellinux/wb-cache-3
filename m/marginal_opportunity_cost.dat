However, the problem of measuring <b>marginal</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>costs</b> is difficult at best, and few electricity-pricing schemes that have been proposed set prices equal to <b>marginal</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>costs.</b> Furthermore, there are costs involved in using price signals: monitoring hourly electricity consumption involves further capital expenditures; consumer acceptance and understanding of complex pricing schemes is questionable; and, even if the "correct" signals are given, {{it is not clear}} that residential (and other) consumers are responsive to higher prices during periods of peak usage, and this ambiguity complicates the electric utility planning process. ...|$|R

40|$|Combined hydro-economic {{models of}} river basins are {{fundamental}} tools for assessing management and infrastructure strategies {{to improve the}} economic efficiency of water use {{in a context of}} competition over scarce water resources. Integrated hydro-economic models have to be capable to properly reproduce the physical behavior of the system, with a realistic representation of the different surface and groundwater resources, including their interaction, and the spatial and temporal variability of resource availability. On the other hand, such models must incorporate the value of water for different urban, agricultural and industrial uses and users. Economic values for water use are defined according to the marginal residual value of water for production (for agricultural and industrial uses) or the aggregated willingness-to-pay (WTP) for urban supply and other final water uses. In this paper, we present a systematic approach to estimate the marginal economic value of surface and groundwater resources at different locations within a complex water resources system.

40|$|The {{object of}} this paper is to perform an {{analysis}} of the economic efficiency of methane generation on a typical 65 -cow dairy farm, juxtaposed against prices and costs of auxiliary energy supplied by rural electrification. The most efficiently sized methane generation option examined is the use of methane to fuel a 30 kW generator with sales of surplus energy fed back to the utility. Whereas this option is still more expensive than present prices for electricity, this would not be the case under assumptions of escalations in relative fuel prices. On an individual farm basis, the economy is made better off by methane generation under this option by $ 195 per year, assuming electricity is priced at its <b>marginal</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>costs.</b> The utility would incur $ 734 in revenue losses, but this figure represents the commensurate decrease in utility capacity and fuel. The merits of setting electricity tariffs equal to marginal costs are evidently part of the incentive for farmers to install this option. Given several scenarios of differently sized methane generators, the utility would promote the smallest facility for the farm, which in turn may be the least efficacious for the economy as a whole. This may conflict with national efficiency criteria so, therefore, regulation at the interface between the farmer and utility would have to be exercised...|$|R

40|$|Within the German "Research Alliance on Agroecosystems Munich" (Forschungsverbund Agrarökosysteme München, FAM) optimal {{land use}} {{strategies}} are investigated since 1990 {{in terms of}} minimization of environmental impacts and maximization of profit from agricultural lands (Auerswald et al. 2000). For this purpose a conventional agricultural land use system was converted into two more sustainable forms of land use. One part of the farm was converted into an integrated land use system with reduced tillage, direct seeding methods and catch crops to minimize nutrient losses and to prevent soil erosion hazards. The {{other part of the}} farm was converted into a biological land use system with the omission of mineral fertilizers and pesticides and the enrichment of crop rotation. In order to evaluate changes {{in the state of the}} agroecosystem a goal and indicator system was elaborated which was aimed to represent important issues of sustainable agriculture. With the help of the goal and indicator system the impact of land use on issues of sustainability can be assessed. The indicators are furthermore integrated into a farm model to assess the implications of the realization of environmental issues in agriculture. For this purpose the model system MODAM (Zander & Kächele 1999) was used to compare different land use options at the farm level. The model system simulates agricultural land use, calculates the economic returns and runs farm optimizations with a linear programming tool. The integration of agro-environmental indicators in the model framework enables a multiple goal optimization and the calculation of trade-offs. For this study soil erosion was assessed with the algorithms of a site-specifically adapted version of the USLE (ABAG, Schwertmann et al. 1987). Optimization runs show, that e. g. soil conservation measures may not only improve soil conservation, but also the economic situation. A slight improvement of soil conservation results in <b>marginal</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>costs</b> for the farm.

In 1974 the Austrian School had been on hiatus for almost a quarter of a century. For more than 60 years before the 1940 s, the Austrian economists had been considered some of the most original contributors to economic theory and policy. They were among the leading developers of the theories of <b>marginal</b> util-ity, <b>opportunity</b> <b>cost,</b> value and price, capital and interest, markets and competition, money and the business cycle, and comparative economic systems – capitalism ver-sus socialism versus the interventionist welfare state. But the rise and triumph of the Keynesian explanation of and prescription for the Great Depression eclipsed all com-peting approaches to the problems of economic depression and high unemployment. Despite all that, however, fundamental Austrian insights about man and the market exposed in this article are still corner-stones of a unique Austrian approach which is incompatible with the positivist, historicist, and neoclassical economic views of the world.

40|$|The {{principles}} of full cost recovery and polluters pay {{contained in the}} Water Framework Directive (WFD 2000 / 60) were approved well over a decade ago. Recently there has been greater debate in transferring these principles to national policies in EU member states following the economic recession, the difficulties in financing water and wastewater infrastructure through public finances and the impacts on {{the environment of the}} growing population. With the approval of the new water tariff (Metodo Tariffario Idrico), the Italian Regulatory Body for Electricity, Gas and Water (AEEGSI) is attempting to translate the WFD principles into a water pricing scheme that recognises environmental and resource costs as components of the tariff structure. The recognition of these costs in the tariff structure is an important step but there are evident difficulties in determining how these costs can be calculated and transferred to tariffs without compromising the ability of users to pay. In {{the first part of the}} paper, different options for calculating these costs have been analysed, from the unit cost of pollutant per quantity of pollutant removed and the unit cost of water abstraction, to cost-benefit analysis combined with environmental value transfer strategies. The recent stance taken by the governing bodies in the United Kingdom has reestablished environmental priorities in both consumption and management of the resource. It has been at the root of the changes that Ofwat has undertaken to improve upstream catchment management and introduce an outcome based approach in ensuring the best value to consumers and society as a whole. The final part of the paper examines proposals on how environmental and resource costs can be transferred to water tariffs: for resource costs, a two-tier tariff approach is proposed with the fixed part of the tariff ensuring adequate coverage of the <b>marginal</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>costs</b> associated with use and the variable part providing the incentive to consumers to use less of the resource. This is because resource costs are recognised as a consequence of scarcity and of the <b>opportunity</b> <b>cost</b> associated with the resource but they are not necessarily incurred by the water and wastewater companies. Environmental costs to remove and/or prevent environmental damage are generally incurred by the companies and these could therefore be charged to users ex ante or ex post to cover the costs of the removal/prevention activity undertaken, whether operating or capital in nature.

Comparative advantage was first described by David Ricardo who explained it in his 1817 book On the Principles of Political Economy and Taxation in an example involving England and Portugal. In Portugal it is possible to produce both wine and cloth with less labour than it would take to produce the same quantities in England. However the relative costs of producing those two goods are different in the two countries. In England {{it is very hard to}} produce wine, and only moderately difficult to produce cloth. In Portugal both are easy to produce. Therefore, while it is cheaper to produce cloth in Portugal than England, it is cheaper still for Portugal to produce excess wine, and trade that for English cloth. Conversely England benefits from this trade because its cost for producing cloth has not changed but it can now get wine at a lower price, closer to the cost of cloth. The conclusion drawn is that each country can gain by specializing in the good where it has comparative advantage, and trading that good for the other.|$|R

Since ISO NE’s real-time ancillary service market co-optimizes both energy and reserve products, ex post pricing is needed for both energy and reserve. A co-optimization approach for ex post pricing requires defining com-plex pricing rules and implementing heuristics to ensure consistent binding constraints with the ex ante dispatch. In order to avoid com-plexity and uncertainty of required heuristics, a new ex post pricing schema is proposed to calculate the ex post energy and reserve prices in a decoupled way while recognizing the coupling effect of energy and reserve.

40|$|We {{study the}} impact of fuel taxes and {{kilometer}} taxes on households' choices of vehicle quality, on their demand for kilometers driven, and on fuel consumption. Moreover, embedding this information in {{a model of the}} car market, we analyze the implications of these taxes for the <b>opportunity</b> <b>costs</b> of owning cars of different quality. Higher quality raises the fixed cost of car ownership, but it may raise (engine size, acceleration speed, etc.) or reduce (fuel technology, etc.) the variable user cost. Our results show that kilometer charges and fuel taxes have very different implications. For example, a higher fuel tax raises household demand for more fuel efficient cars, provided that the demand for car use is inelastic; it reduces the demand for characteristics that raise variable user costs. Surprisingly, however, a kilometer tax unambiguously reduces the demand for more fuel efficient cars. Incorporating price adjustments at the market level, we find that fuel taxes raise the <b>marginal</b> fixed <b>opportunity</b> <b>cost</b> of better fuel efficiency at all quality levels. Total annual <b>opportunity</b> <b>costs</b> of owning highly fuel efficient cars increase, while they decline for cars of low fuel efficiency. We further find that both a fuel tax and a kilometer charge reduce the total annual fixed ownership cost for car attributes that raise the variable cost of driving (engine power, acceleration speed, etc.). There is thus in general a trade-off between fixed and variable car costs: if the latter increase - due to higher fuel prices or a kilometer charge - total demand for cars decreases and a return to equilibrium is only possible by a decrease in fixed costs. All theoretical results are illustrated using a numerical version of the model. The analysis shows that modeling the effect of tax changes on household behavior alone can produce highly misleading results...|$|R

What will be the consequences on the economics of interconnection and its settlements? These are important questions that arise with {{the evolution of the}} Internet as a network of QoS networks that support a variety of performance requirements. The convergence of various telecommunications networks relies critically on the interconnections of various networks and related QoS management and assurance. Furthermore, the heterogeneity of the proposed QoS support mechanisms intensifies the importance and integrity of these research questions related to the network interconnection.

Nonetheless, the basic ingredient of accounting information {{continues to be the}} measurable transaction, actual or budgeted, rather than the more subjective concepts of <b>marginal</b> <b>cost</b> or <b>opportunity</b> <b>cost</b> favored by economic theory. This paper studies the design of a {{management accounting}} information system as a mechanism design problem for a decentralized firm, where the mechanism is constrained to use messages consisting of actual or proposed transactions, or reports compiled exclusively from such messages. The firm is modeled as a network of productive activities, some of which produce revenue while others produce goods or services used by other activities. The firm seeks a budget, that is, a proposed action for each activity, that maximizes profit. An accounting information system includes a performance measure for each activity, and each activity manager is assumed to act to maximize measured performance. Several accounting information systems are constructed and compared according to the profitability of the budgets they generate. Although accounting information is not sufficient to ensure profit-maximization, activity-based costing (ABC) is shown to be useful in identifying products that should be dropped and internally produced inputs that should be purchased from external sources.
