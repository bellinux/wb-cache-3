The driver of the light engine and two passengers from the express were hospitalised but quickly discharged.|$|E
5|$|The rain {{continued}} {{throughout the}} second session, so most teams concentrated on their wet weather setups {{in preparation for}} a wet race. About halfway through the session the No. 7 Peugeot in the hands of Marc Gené missed the turn at Arnage and hit a tire barrier. The car was unable to return to the pits and was taken behind the wall by the marshals. This was soon followed by the No. 73 Luc Alphand Corvette missing the same turn as well, but it continued on without significant damage. The No. 70 PSI Corvette had a <b>minor</b> <b>accident</b> in the last five minutes of the session, bringing out the only red flag of the day and ending all of qualifying.|$|E

25|$|The Friday {{practice}} session started in wet conditions {{which resulted in}} most of the drivers venturing out {{in the latter half of}} the hour, some of them, such as Lewis Hamilton, emerging only during final minutes of the session. Ferrari's Felipe Massa recorded the fastest lap in this session, followed by Robert Kubica and Heikki Kovalainen. In the second session of the day, Lewis Hamilton aced while Kubica continued to record good timings at number two. Kimi Räikkönen recorded third fastest lap time compared to his fifth fastest in the earlier session. Timo Glock suffered a <b>minor</b> <b>accident</b> after he hit the wall on turn four. Nico Rosberg, however, sprung a surprise by topping the Saturday session ahead of Räikkönen and Hamilton. The session was red flagged 45 minutes in when Toro Rosso's Sebastian Vettel hit the wall after losing control at turn nine, resulting in a number of drivers being unable to complete their flying laps. Further, Vettel's teammate Sébastien Bourdais suffered a crash at turn five.|$|E

25|$|The Lebanese Air Forces have a {{long history}} {{operating}} Hawker Hunter jets since 1958. A Lebanese Hawker Hunter shot down an Israeli jet over Kfirmishki in the early 1960s and its pilot was captured by the Lebanese Armed Forces. One Lebanese Hawker Hunter was shot down {{on the first day of}} the Six-Day War by an Israeli Air Force Mirage IIICJ. The Hawker Hunters have not flown any combat sorties since September 17, 1983. This was at a time when the French and Americans were rebuilding the Lebanese Army. Three F.Mk.70s were made airworthy, and resumed combat operations on September 15. Because the main airfield, Rayak Air Base, had been shelled by Syrian forces, the Hunters had to operate from an airfield in Byblos. The Hunters were finally grounded in 1994 after a <b>minor</b> <b>accident</b> with one of the T.66 trainers during landing and the remaining 8 were stored in Rayak. The last loss took place in 1989 near Batroun during routine training, when the undercarriage failed to lower, causing the jet to crash. The pilot ejected safely from the doomed aircraft and landed in the Mediterranean sea, where he was promptly rescued by the Syrian Army, which then handed him over to Suleiman Frangieh, who in turn handed him over to the Lebanese Army at the al-Madfoun crossing.|$|E
500|$|On graduation, Born {{was obliged}} to perform his {{military}} service, which he had deferred while a student. He found himself drafted into the German army, and posted to the 2nd Guards Dragoons [...] "Empress Alexandra of Russia", which was stationed in Berlin. His service was brief, as he was discharged early after an asthma attack in January 1907. He then travelled to England, where he was admitted to Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, and studied physics for six months at the Cavendish Laboratory under J. J. Thomson, George Searle and Joseph Larmor. After Born returned to Germany, the Army re-inducted him, and he served with the elite 1st (Silesian) Life Cuirassiers [...] "Great Elector" [...] until he was again medically discharged after just six weeks' service. He then returned to Breslau, where he worked {{under the supervision of}} Otto Lummer and Ernst Pringsheim, hoping to do his habilitation in physics. A <b>minor</b> <b>accident</b> involving Born's black body experiment, a ruptured cooling water hose, and a flooded laboratory, led to Lummer telling him that he would never become a physicist.|$|E
500|$|Stunt {{coordinator}} and second unit director David Leitch {{compared it to}} a [...] "Jackie Chan hybrid of comedy and action." [...] Prior to the filming, Leitch organized a month-long boot camp in order to prepare Renner and Arterton (who said she was also glad that at least she could use her prior training that she received while studying at RADA) with extensive weapons, fight and stunt training. Janssen said she enjoyed [...] "flying", something that she always wanted to do, adding that despite her reputation as an action star {{it was the first}} film where she really had to do something physical (including suffering a <b>minor</b> <b>accident</b> on the set), because she could not use a double in the close-up scenes where she had the makeup on. During one of the scenes, where Gretel is thrown through a wall and falls down several meters, a stunt double for Arterton was dangerously injured when a nail got lodged in her skull close to the brain; Arterton said she initially wanted to do this stunt herself but Wirkola would not let her. Arterton herself suffered an injury when she sprained her ankle while running through the forest. Stunts for the more aggressive witches were done by New Zealander stuntwoman and actress Zoë Bell. Renner did practically all of his stunt scenes himself.|$|E
40|$|<b>Minor</b> bicycle <b>{{accidents}}</b> {{are defined}} as "bicycle accidents not involving death or heavily injured persons, implying that possible hospital visits last less than 24 hours". Statistics about these accidents and related injuries are very poor, because they are mostly not reported to police, hospitals or insurance companies. Yet, they form a major share of all bicycle accidents. Official registrations underestimate the number of <b>minor</b> <b>accidents</b> and do not provide cost data, nor the distance cycled. Therefore related policies are hampered {{by a lack of}} accurate data. This paper provides more insight into the importance of <b>minor</b> bicycle <b>accidents</b> and reports the frequency, risk and resulting costs of <b>minor</b> bicycle <b>accidents.</b> Direct costs, including the damage to bike and clothes as well as medical costs and indirect costs such as productivity loss and leisure time lost are calculated. We also estimate intangible costs of pain and psychological suffering and costs for other parties involved in the accident. Data were collected during the SHAPES project using several electronic surveys. The weekly prospective registration that lasted a year, covered 1187 persons that cycled 1. 474. 978 km. 219 <b>minor</b> bicycle <b>accidents</b> were reported. Resulting in a frequency of 148 <b>minor</b> bicycle <b>accidents</b> per million kilometres. We analyzed the economic costs related to 118 <b>minor</b> bicycle <b>accidents</b> in detail. The average total cost of these accidents is estimated at 841 euro (95 % CI: 579 - 105) per accident or 0. 125 euro per kilometre cycled. Overall, productivity loss is the most important component accounting for 48 % of the total cost. Intangible costs, which in past research were mostly neglected, are an important burden related to <b>minor</b> bicycle <b>accidents</b> (27 % of the total cost). Even among <b>minor</b> <b>accidents</b> there are important differences in the total cost depending on the severity of the injury...|$|R

As a result, both the race and the record were flown by S1595 (now in the Science Museum, London). The engines were swapped for this attempt though, from the [...] "reliable" [...] race tune to the ultimate performance [...] "sprint" [...] engine and its special fuel. Flight Lieutenant Stainforth then achieved a record of 407.5mph, {{the first person to}} travel faster than 400mph; [...] "the mark that matters", in the words of Ernest Hives.

2500|$|... "Bollocks" [...] {{is a word}} of Middle English origin, meaning [...] "testicles". The word {{is often}} used figuratively in colloquial British English and Hiberno-English as a noun to mean [...] "nonsense", an expletive {{following}} a <b>minor</b> <b>accident</b> or misfortune, or an adjective to mean [...] "poor quality" [...] or [...] "useless". Similarly, common phrases like [...] "Bollocks to this!" [...] and [...] "That's a load of old bollocks" [...] generally indicate contempt for a certain task, subject or opinion. Conversely, the word also figures in idiomatic phrases such as [...] "the dog's bollocks", [...] "top bollock(s)", or more simply [...] "the bollocks" [...] (as opposed to just [...] "bollocks"), which will refer to something which is admired, approved of or well-respected.|$|E

[...] Although the team did not reach the summit of Mt. Makalu on this expedition due to illness, the weather, and a <b>minor</b> <b>accident,</b> the team spent more than six months living and performing laboratory experiments in the Eureka Draw-Tite tents on the Himalayan mountains.

40|$|This study {{analysed}} {{the relationship}} between major and <b>minor</b> <b>accidents,</b> and major accidents involving a moving vehicle, and behavioural and emotional factors in children, aged 4 - 15 years, using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), and adjusting for demographic, socio-economic and family type factors. Data from a large representative national sample of about 6000 children were analysed using simple and multiple logistic regression. The analysis shows that the prevalence of SDQ scales, such as hyperactivity and conduct disorder were significantly higher in boys, lower social classes and step- and single-parent families. After adjusting for the demographic, socio-economic and family type factors, children who scored borderline or high for hyperactivity were almost two {{times more likely to}} report having major accidents. Children who scored high for hyperactivity and emotional symptoms were one and a half times more likely to report having <b>minor</b> <b>accidents.</b> For major accidents involving moving vehicles, the relationships with the behavioural and emotional factors were generally stronger than for major accidents in general. Hyperactivity, in particular, was significantly associated with the occurrence of major and <b>minor</b> <b>accidents,</b> and major accidents involving moving vehicles. The behavioural risk factors were significantly more common in the lower social classes, families receiving benefits and step- and single-parent families. No Full Tex...|$|R
