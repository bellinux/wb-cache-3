50|$|The metal traces {{shown in}} the figure for {{conducting}} electric current into the thermal bump {{may or may not}} be directly connected to the circuitry of the chip. In the case where there are electrical connections to the chip circuitry, on-board temperature sensors and driver circuitry can be used to control the thermal bump in a closed loop fashion to maintain optimal performance. Second, the heat that is pumped by the thermal bump and the additional heat created by the thermal bump in the course of pumping that heat will need to be rejected into the substrate or board. Since the performance of the thermal bump can be improved by providing a good thermal path for the rejected heat, it is beneficial to provide high thermally conductive pathways on the backside of the thermal bump. The substrate could be a highly conductive ceramic substrate like AlN or a metal (e.g., Cu, CuW, CuMo, etc.) with a dielectric. In this case, the high thermal conductance of the substrate will act as a natural pathway for the rejected heat. The substrate might also be a <b>multilayer</b> <b>substrate</b> like a printed wiring board (PWB) designed to provide a high-density interconnect. In this case, the thermal conductivity of the PWB may be relatively poor, so adding thermal vias (e.g. metal plugs) can provide excellent pathways for the rejected heat.|$|E

40|$|Methodology for extracting an {{effective}} dielectric constant of microstrip transmission lines on <b>multilayer</b> <b>substrates,</b> from measured or simulated S-parameters data, using on-chip test structures, has been demonstrated.

40|$|Abstract—All {{plastics}} can {{be divided}} into two groups called thermoplastics and thermosets, and each group exhibits very different behaviors. Unlike thermosets, thermoplastics are em-pirically known by the viscoelastic behavior of the thermoplastic layers; the stress generated by building subsequent layers can be significantly relieved in a multilayer structure. In this study, we quantitatively investigated the stress relaxationf effect of thermoplastics in lamination-based <b>multilayer</b> <b>substrates.</b> As an increasing number of layers were laminated using either ther-moplastic or thermoset adhesives, the maximum bow values were measured layer-by-layer using a laser profilometry during thermal cycling. When analyzed through an analytical model, the measured thermal behavior of thermoplastics exhibited as much as 70 % stress relaxation in the multilayer structures, and highly contrasted with that of thermoset adhesives. The result provides an important design guideline that thermoplastics {{can be used as a}} stress relaxation layer in lamination-based <b>multilayer</b> <b>substrates.</b> Index Terms—Composite beam analysis, lamination, laser pro-filometry, multichip module, multilayer, stress relaxation, ther-moplastic adhesives, thermoset adhesives.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{influence}} of <b>multilayer</b> <b>substrate</b> configuration in horizontal subsurface flow constructed wetlands (HSCWs) on their treatment performance, biofilm development, and solid accumulation. Three pilot-scale HSCWs were built to treat campus sewage and have been operationalfor three years. The HSCWs included mono-layer (CW 1), three-layer (CW 3), and six-layer (CW 6) substrate configurations with hydraulic conductivity of the substrate increasing from the surface to bottom in the multilayer CWs. It was demonstrated the pollutants removal performance after 3 -year operation improved in the multilayer HSCWs (49 - 80 %) compared to the mono layer HSCW (29 - 41 %). Simultaneously, the multilayer HSCWs exhibited significant features that prevented clogging compared to the monolayer configuration. The amount of accumulated solids was notably higher in the monolayer CW compared to multilayer CWs. Further, multilayer HSCWs could delay clogging by providing higher biofilm development for organics removal and consequently, lesser solid accumulations. Principal component analysis strongly supported the visualization of the performance patterns {{in the present study}} and showed that <b>multilayer</b> <b>substrate</b> configuration, season, and sampling locations significantly influenced biofilm growth and solid accumulation. Finally, the present study provided important information to support the improved multilayer configured HSCW implication in the future...|$|E

This dissertation describes the optimization and characterization of self-assembled monolayer (SAM) <b>multilayer</b> SERS <b>substrates</b> for improving performance {{of different types of}} substrates. SERS substrates derived from metal film on nanostructures were modified with multiple metal films interspaced with SAM dielectric spacers to achieve <b>multilayered</b> SERS <b>substrates.</b> The fundamental concept of this substrate geometry exploited the cumulative effect of the multiple electromagnetic fields and various properties of SAMs to optimize SERS enhancement of <b>multilayer</b> SERS <b>substrates</b> to about 20 -fold compared to conventional substrates. SAMs of less bulky terminal groups of alkylthiols with relatively small dielectric constant, strong attractive interaction, and good electron donating ability enhanced multilayer SERS. Compared to SFON SERS substrates, alkyl-terminated SAM substrates exhibited about 7 -fold SERS enhancement. SAM formation conditions that enhanced strong intermolecular interactions improved SERS enhancement. Thus, -COOH-terminated SAM <b>multilayer</b> <b>substrates</b> fabricated in acidic conditions exhibited SERS enhancement up to 10 -fold compared to similar substrates fabricated in basic conditions. It was observed that the distance of separation of the adjacent metal films (< 2 nm) was important for optimum interaction of EM fields generated on these metal films. SAM <b>multilayer</b> SERS <b>substrates</b> formed from 7 or 8 carbon atoms of alkyl-terminated alkylthiols with separation distances of 1. 2 and 1. 4 nm respectively exhibited about 14 to 16 -fold SERS enhancement relative to SFON. A systematic increase of the separation distance between adjacent metal films beyond 2 nm led to a decrease in the SERS enhancement, indicating decreasing interactive effect between the adjacent EM fields. In general, there was an increase in the SERS enhancement with {{increase in the number of}} SERS-active layers. Correspondingly, the relative standard deviation decreased to about 5 % for <b>multilayered</b> <b>substrates</b> compared to 14 % for conventional single layered <b>substrates,</b> thereby improving <b>multilayer</b> SERS reproducibility while increasing the SERS enhancement. Overall, SERS enhancement of conventional SERS substrates can be optimized using multiple SERS-active surfaces well separated with appropriate dielectric spacers and optimum separation distance...|$|R
