30|$|The word “mammal” is {{from the}} {{scientific}} name Mammalia derived from the Latin mamma (“teat”). All female mammals suckle their young with milk which is secreted from apocrine mammary glands. Only the young are fed mother’s milk, {{and the process of}} suckling cessation is called weaning. For human infants, supplementation of maternal nursing is called complementary feeding or beikost [1]. The German word beikost translates as “infant foods other than milk or formula.” Starchy foods are the first offered as beikost in most cultures [2]. The introduction of beikost begins the weaning process and introduces environmental vectors stressing the maternal-infant dyad. The presently recommended age for introduction of complementary feedings to the suckling infant is 6  months [2]. One of the arguments for this controversial recommendation offered by learned committees is the physiologic delay of amylase production and secretion in normal infants. Pediatricians worldwide know that many mothers start offering beikost in the first months of life and that this common practice is usually rewarded by infant behavior. On the other hand, it is believed that in developing counties, much of the stunting of infant growth is due to poor nutritional quality and environmental contamination of complementary feedings [3]. With a general hypothesis that the starch offered in complementary foods is nutritionally available to in the suckling infant, we designed the following set of experiments in a mouse model. As in the human infant, developmental amylase insufficiency is present in the mouse. In suckling rodents, amylase and <b>mucosal</b> <b>glucoamylase</b> insufficiency are well documented [4]. This led to our experimental hypothesis that the suckling mouse can digest starch before the age of formal weaning, 21  days. The maltase-glucoamylase (Mgam) gene was ablated at the N-terminal expressing the membrane binding domain [5], and this hypothesis was tested in mucosal Mgam knockout (KO) and wild-type (WT) mice before and after weaning. In these experiments, it was shown that suckling mice begin to consume the adult diet by 15  days and that they can digest food starch before that age. The source of the starch digesting glucosidase activity was shown to be maternal milk which is expressed from the lactating alveolar cells of the mammary gland in a smaller molecular weight soluble form when compared to the membrane-bound form of the wild-type adult mouse jejunum.|$|E
