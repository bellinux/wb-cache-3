50|$|The {{history of}} the concept of <b>matter</b> <b>is</b> a {{history of the}} {{fundamental}} length scales used to define matter. Different building blocks apply depending upon whether one defines matter on an atomic or elementary particle level. One may use a definition that <b>matter</b> <b>is</b> atoms, or that <b>matter</b> <b>is</b> hadrons, or that <b>matter</b> <b>is</b> leptons and quarks depending upon the scale at which one wishes to define matter.|$|R

5|$|A {{controversy}} that has occupied scholars {{for more than}} a century concerns whether Cabral's discovery was by chance or intentional. If the latter, that would mean that the Portuguese had at least some hint that a land existed to the west.

5|$|An autopsy was {{performed}} on August 16, 1983, {{but was unable to}} determine cause of death. New Haven police investigated the death, but were unable to find evidence of foul play. In November 1983, the office of the Connecticut state medical examiner issued a report stating that Slee's death may have been related to stress. The police investigation into the <b>matter</b> <b>was</b> closed the same month.|$|E
5000|$|In physics, exotic <b>matter</b> <b>is</b> <b>matter</b> {{that somehow}} {{deviates}} from normal matter and has [...] "exotic" [...] properties. A more broad definition of exotic <b>matter</b> <b>is</b> {{any kind of}} non-baryonic matter—that is not made of baryons, the subatomic particles, such as protons and neutrons, of which ordinary <b>matter</b> <b>is</b> composed. Exotic mass has been considered a colloquial term for matters such as dark matter, negative mass, or complex mass.|$|R

5|$|His {{practice}} of dividing {{his time between}} Britain and America caused Wodehouse difficulties with the tax authorities of both countries. Both the UK Inland Revenue and the US Internal Revenue Service sought to tax him as a resident.

5|$|In 1741 Adam {{was forced}} to {{initiate}} legal proceedings against William, Lord Braco, to retrieve unpaid fees arising from his work at Duff House.

However, Braco was a stubborn opponent, and dragged out the proceedings, which were not resolved until just before Adam's death.|$|E
5|$|In Australia, however, {{public opinion}} about the <b>matter</b> <b>was</b> divided with many Australians opposed to the issue on moral grounds, feeling that the {{situation}} was not desperate enough to require such a drastic measure, while others felt it {{necessary in order to}} achieve final victory. The Hughes Labor government decided to hold a plebiscite on the matter and on 28 October 1916 the <b>matter</b> <b>was</b> decided by a narrow margin of 51 per cent to 49 per cent, with the no vote prevailing. Despite the result, the issue split the Labor Party and the pro-conscription prime minister, Billy Hughes, ultimately left the party and joined with members of the opposition that supported conscription to form a new party, known as the Nationalist Party.|$|E

50|$|Strange <b>matter</b> <b>is</b> a {{particular}} form of quark matter, usually {{thought of as a}} liquid of up, down, and strange quarks. It is contrasted with nuclear <b>matter,</b> which <b>is</b> a liquid of neutrons and protons (which themselves are built out of up and down quarks), and with non-strange quark <b>matter,</b> which <b>is</b> a quark liquid that contains only up and down quarks. At high enough density, strange <b>matter</b> <b>is</b> expected to be color superconducting. Strange <b>matter</b> <b>is</b> hypothesized to occur in the core of neutron stars, or, more speculatively, as isolated droplets that may vary in size from femtometers (strangelets) to kilometers (quark stars).|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe chiral nucleon-meson model, {{previously}} {{applied to}} systems with {{equal number of}} neutrons and protons, is extended to asymmetric nuclear <b>matter.</b> Fluctuations <b>are</b> included {{in the framework of}} the functional renormalization group. The equation of state for pure neutron <b>matter</b> <b>is</b> studied and compared to recent advanced many-body calculations. The chiral condensate in neutron <b>matter</b> <b>is</b> computed as a function of baryon density.

50|$|As seen in {{the above}} discussion, many early {{definitions}} of what can <b>be</b> called ordinary <b>matter</b> <b>were</b> based upon its structure or building blocks. On the scale of elementary particles, a definition that follows this tradition can be stated as: ordinary <b>matter</b> <b>is</b> everything that is composed of quarks and leptons, or ordinary <b>matter</b> <b>is</b> everything that is composed of any elementary fermions except antiquarks and antileptons. The connection between these formulations follows.|$|R

5|$|Once a vote occurred, and {{a measure}} passed, {{he could do}} nothing, since his promise to {{physically}} interpose his person against the senators was now meaningless. In addition, during a couple of instances {{between the end of}} the Second Punic War in 201 BC {{and the beginning of the}} Social War in 91 BC, although they had no legal power to do so, several Consuls were known to have vetoed acts of the Senate. Ultimately, if there was no veto, and the <b>matter</b> <b>was</b> of minor importance, it could be voted on by a voice vote or by a show of hands. If there was no veto, and the <b>matter</b> <b>was</b> of a significant nature, there was usually a physical division of the house, where senators voted by taking a place on either side of the chamber.|$|E
5|$|Sorkin {{collaborated with}} Warren Beatty {{on a couple}} of scripts, one of which was Bulworth. Beatty, known for {{occasionally}} personally financing his film projects through pre-production, also hired Sorkin to rewrite a script titled Ocean of Storms which never went into production. At one point Sorkin sued Beatty for proper compensation for his work on the Ocean of Storms script; once the <b>matter</b> <b>was</b> settled, he resumed working on the script.|$|E
50|$|Programmable <b>matter</b> <b>is</b> <b>matter</b> {{which has}} the ability to change its {{physical}} properties (shape, density, moduli, conductivity, optical properties, etc.) in a programmable fashion, based upon user input or autonomous sensing.

50|$|Patentable, {{statutory}} or patent-eligible subject <b>matter</b> <b>is</b> subject <b>matter</b> which <b>is</b> susceptible of patent protection. The laws or patent {{practices of}} many countries provide that certain subject-matter is excluded from patentability, {{even if the}} invention is novel and non-obvious. Together with novelty, inventive step or nonobviousness, utility, and industrial applicability, {{the question of whether}} a particular subject <b>matter</b> <b>is</b> patentable is one of the substantive requirements for patentability.|$|R

5|$|A $30,000 supersedeas bond {{was issued}} in August 1965 as the United Bond Insurance Company {{continued}} to dispute {{the payment of}} Kinne's original $25,000 bond. The supersedeas bond allowed the company to defer payment of the $25,000 bond until a ruling on the <b>matter</b> <b>was</b> handed down by the Missouri Supreme Court, but when that court upheld the bond's forfeiture, the $25,000 was paid to the State of Missouri in October 1965.

5|$|A {{day after}} announcing the attempt on his life, Nasser {{established}} a new provisional constitution proclaiming a 600-member National Assembly (400 from Egypt and 200 from Syria) and {{the dissolution of}} all political parties. Nasser gave each of the provinces two vice-presidents: Boghdadi and Amer in Egypt, and Sabri al-Asali and Akram al-Hawrani in Syria. Nasser then left for Moscow to meet with Nikita Khrushchev. At the meeting, Khrushchev pressed Nasser to lift the ban on the Communist Party, but Nasser refused, stating it was an internal matter which was not a subject of discussion with outside powers. Khrushchev was reportedly taken aback and denied he had meant to interfere in the UAR's affairs. The <b>matter</b> <b>was</b> settled as both leaders sought to prevent a rift between their two countries.|$|E
5000|$|Active <b>matter</b> <b>is</b> {{composed}} {{of large numbers}} of active [...] "agents", each of which consumes energy in order to move or to exert mechanical forces. Due to the energy consumption, these systems are intrinsically out of thermal equilibrium. Examples of active <b>matter</b> <b>are</b> schools of fish, flocks of birds, bacteria, artificial self-propelled particles, and self-organising bio-polymers such as microtubules and actin, both of which are part of the cytoskeleton of living cells. Most examples of active <b>matter</b> <b>are</b> biological in origin; however, a great deal of current experimental work is devoted to synthetic systems.
