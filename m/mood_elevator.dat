It was also reviewed favorably in People, in which its music was described as almost identical to that of Bulk, and which concluded, [...] "Logan and company may not get high marks for originality, but something's working here." [...] Other favorable reviews included one in SF Weekly, where James Sullivan wrote that on <b>Mood</b> <b>Elevator,</b> [...] "He Logan and his group identify {{the finer points of}} rock's more indulgent styles and condense them into hard, memorable nuggets," [...] and one in the Boston Phoenix, which described the album's songs as [...] "fascinating fragments of stories and thoughts that are too real to ignore." [...] This critical acclaim led the Georgia House of Representatives to pass a bill commending Logan and Liquor Cabinet on March 15, 1996. Geoffrey Himes wrote in the Washington Post that <b>Mood</b> <b>Elevator</b> [...] "...lacks the breathtaking breadth of [...] "Bulk," [...] but it does boast half a dozen of Logan's finest efforts", and cited [...] "Just Babies" [...] and [...] "Vintage Man" [...] as among the album's best songs.|$|E

5000|$|The {{album was}} co-produced by Peter Jesperson, who {{originally}} discovered Logan and picked out his favorite songs {{out of more}} than 600 to release as Logan's debut album, Bulk. This became Logan's big break, leading to appearances on The Today Show and Late Night With Conan O'Brien. The other producer on <b>Mood</b> <b>Elevator</b> was Kelly Keneipp, who also performed guitar and keyboard on the album.|$|E
5000|$|His first {{release was}} the {{critically}} acclaimed Bulk which contained 42 {{songs from the}} approximately 600 Logan had recorded from 1979 to 1993.

50|$|After {{finishing}} {{the recording of}} Fire, three members left in June, leaving Dick Valentine, M, and Tait Nucleus? (Christopher Tait). Johnny Na$hinal (John Nash, guitar, member of The Volebeats, The Witches and solo effort The Alphabet), The Colonel (Zach Shipps, guitar, ex member of Brendan Benson, The Atomic Numbers and <b>Mood</b> <b>Elevator),</b> John R. Dequindre (Chris Peters, bass/guitar) and Frank Lloyd Bonaventure (Mark Dundon, bass) (both-ex members of Ann Arbor's whirlingRoad, Getaway Cruiser and Six Clips) subsequently joined the group, although The Colonel had {{to opt out of}} early performances due to prior touring commitments. In time, Dequindre switched from guitar to bass and Bonaventure left to attain a law degree.|$|E
50|$|Logan {{began writing}} {{songs in the}} 1980s, when {{virtually}} no one but him and his close friends knew about his musical career. He became famous after he was introduced to Peter Jesperson, the former manager of the Replacements, by Peter Buck, who picked 42 of his favorite songs of the hundreds Logan had written at that point. These songs were then released on Twin/Tone Records, {{in the form of}} the 1994 album Bulk. This same pool of songs was tapped into for the 17 tracks on <b>Mood</b> <b>Elevator.</b> With regard to songwriting, Logan has said he considers his own life too uninteresting to write songs about, and so focuses on writing songs based on fictional characters instead.|$|E
5000|$|Unlike Logan's debut album, Bulk, the 17 {{songs on}} <b>Mood</b> <b>Elevator</b> were {{recorded}} in a 16-track studio {{that had been set}} up in a friend's barn {{in the small town of}} Royal Center, Indiana. During the first night of recording, Logan recalls wanting to test out the equipment, after which a member of Liquor Cabinet soon wrote a guitar part. Logan then wrote some lyrics to go with it, and the session ended up producing three of Mood Elevators songs, which Logan wanted to record then because he was [...] "aching to go". Logan and Liquor Cabinet recorded a total of 36 songs in 10 days during the sessions. Half the album's songs were written prior to the start of recording, and the other half were written in the studio.|$|E
50|$|During {{the summer}} of 2000, local {{songwriter}} and accomplished folk artist Alicia Gbur, inspired by the thriving Detroit Rock scene wrote several songs {{with the intent to}} record and start a rock band. She asked mutual musician friends Zach Shipps (Electric Six) and Matt Aljian (<b>Mood</b> <b>Elevator)</b> to come to the studio and play on the initial recordings. Rehearsals started with Rich Griffith from Ann Arbor on bass. That same month, she met guitarist Matt Lannoo at a party. During the fall of 2000 Gbur, Lannoo and Griffith wrote and rehearsed while auditioning drummers eventually finding Nick Gerhardt (Plain). A handful of new songs were written and recorded. In early 2001 the first few shows were at the legendary Gold Dollar club in Detroit's Cass Corridor under the name The Nice Device. A few months later, Griffith was replaced on bass with Zach Shipps.|$|E
