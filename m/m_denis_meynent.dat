But Hübner had misidentified Fabricius' species, which was in reality a tineid moth known today as Nemaxera betulinella.

An upper case F portrayed {{on a computer screen}} was to be imagined standing up {{in the center of the}} clock. In Expt. 1, an adjustment task was used to verify that the discrimination of clock directions rendered by this perspective drawing was quite accurate. Precision was not affected by the imaginary size of the clock. In Expt. 2, subjects either (1) indicated the clock location pointed by the F given their viewing position (VC condition), or (2) their location at the periphery of the clock given the location pointed by the F (OC condition). Response latencies were proportional to the explored imaginary distance and increased with the size of the imagined environment. We found an additional mean processing time of at least 2 s in the OC condition with respect to the VC condition. Results are interpreted within Kosslyn's (Kosslyn, S.

5000|$|But {{this name}} {{had already been}} used for a genus of {{northern}} hakes by P. Artedi in his catalogue of fishes (Petri Artedi sueci genera piscium), edited and published posthumously by J. Walbaum in 1792. When this name was replaced, Fabricius' earlier description of the type species was overlooked, eventurally rendering it a nomen oblitum. In any case, the same moth had been first described as Phalaena (Tinea) roborella by <b>M.</b> <b>Denis</b> and I. Schiffermüller in 1775, and thus their species name has priority over that of Fabricius. Replacement names for Fabricius' Phycis were proposed at almost {{the same time in}} 1828 by J. Curtis and L. Thienemann, but the latter's proposal Ceratium was also unavailable, having been established for a dinoflagellate genus by F. v. Schrank in 1793. To add further confusion, some authors have claimed that Ceratium was again established for the present genus in 1848 by J. v. Gistel, but this is not correct [...] - [...] Gistel merely discussed Thienemann's and v.

A new selective chromogenic plate, YECA, was tested for its specificity, sensitivity, and accuracy to detect pathogenic Y. enterocolitica from pig tonsils. We tested a panel of 26 bacterial strains on YECA and compared it to PCA, CIN, and YeCM media. Detection of pathogenic Y. enterocolitica was carried out on 50 pig tonsils collected in one slaughter house. Enrichment was done in PSB and ITC broths. Streaking on YECA and CIN was done in direct, after 24 H incubation of ITC, after 48 H incubation of PSB and ITC. All the plates were incubated at 30 ◦ C during 24 hours. Presence of typical colonies on CIN and YECA was checked, and isolates were biotyped. Pathogenic Y. enterocolitica strains showed an important growth on YECA with small and red fuchsia colonies while biotype 1 A exhibited very few violet colonies. Enrichment in ITC during 48 H gave the best performance for detecting positive samples in pathogenic Y. enterocolitica, and YECA could detect directly pathogenic Y. enterocolitica strains (2, 3, and 4).

40|$|Since {{heterotrophic}} prokaryotes play {{an important}} biogeochemical role in aquatic ecosystems and have a high capacity to survive in extreme environments, easy-to-perform protocols that probe their physiological states {{and the effects of}} environmental variables on those states are highly desired. Some methodologies combine a general nucleic acid stain with a membrane integrity probe. We calibrated one of these, the nucleic acid double-staining (NADS) protocol (G. Grégori, S. Citterio, A. Ghiani, M. Labra, S. Sgorbati, S. Brown, and <b>M.</b> <b>Denis,</b> Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 67 : 4662 - 4670, 2001), determining the optimal stain concentrations in seawater and the response to conditions that generate prokaryote death (such as heat) and to conditions that are known to produce death in plankton, such as nutrient limitation or flagellate grazing. The protocol was validated by comparison to two methods used to detect viability: active respiration by 5 -cyano- 2, 3 -ditolyl tetrazolium chloride (CTC) and incorporation of tritiated leucine. We show that concentrations in the range of 5 to 20 μg ml− 1 of propidium iodide, simultaneous to a 10 × concentration of Sybr green I, are best for detecting two separated populations of “live” (green cells) and “dead” (red cells) organisms. During exposure to heat and UVC, we observed that the number of live cells declined concurrently with that of actively respiring cells (CTC positive) and with total leucine incorporation. In seawater mesocosms, the NADS protocol allowed detection of bacterioplankton starvation-related death and flagellate predation. The protocol was also tested in deep profiles in the northwest Atlantic, demonstrating its potential for routine characterization of this fraction of the physiological diversity of marine heterotrophic prokaryotic plankton...|$|R

40|$|The {{caterpillars}} of Maculinea butterflies are obligate parasites of nests of Myrmica (or {{in certain}} cases Aphaenogaster) ants during most of their development. Manica rubida (LATREILLE, 1802) {{is closely related to}} ants of the genus Myrmica, and can occur on Maculinea sites. Laboratory colonies of M. rubida were therefore tested for their ability to raise caterpillars of Maculinea rebeli (HIRSCHKE, 1904) and <b>M.</b> alcon (<b>DENIS</b> & SCHIFFERMÜLLER, 1775). After introduction into the foraging arenas of these colonies, all caterpillars were taken into the nest by worker ants, where they were often carried and licked. Several caterpillars of both butterflies survived and increased in size for a number of weeks, up to one and a half months. These results suggest that M. rubida could potentially act as a host for Maculinea caterpillars, although whether any local populations have evolved to specialise on this potential host remains to be demonstrated in the fields...|$|R

40|$|Effectiveness of {{therapeutic}} communities: a systematic review. Malivert <b>M.,</b> Fatséas <b>M.,</b> <b>Denis</b> C. et al. European Addiction Research: 2012, 18, p. 1 – 11 Methodological shortcomings {{in the original}} studies prevented this review from reaching a firm conclusion on the lasting benefits of residential therapeutic communities, though {{it was clear that}} while residents stayed, substance use was significantly reduced. Summary Therapeutic communities are a type of drug-free residential service. Their objectives include maintaining abstinence and socially rehabilitating drug users. Unlike some other residential facilities with similar aims, in these communities the therapeutic system is based on treatment stages which afford residents increasing degrees of personal and social responsibility for the running of the service. Peer influence mediated through group processes is used to help individuals assimilate social norms and develop social skills, and social rehabilitation is promoted by daily activities. Residents have the opportunity to progress in the hierarchy to themselves managing group activities as a peer leader. A previous systematic review found little evidence that therapeutic communities significantly improved on outcomes from other types of residential treatment, or that one type {{of therapeutic}} community was more effective than another. However, this review included services in prison or offered as an alternative to prison, possibly not comparable to those voluntary entered outside prison. It was also limited to studies which randomly allocated participants to therapeutic communities versus alternative or no treatments, and did not seek to establish which types of substance users might be best suited to therapeutic communities. Using a similar methodology, the featured review focused on therapeutic communities for adult substance users outside the criminal justice system. Aims were to assess their effectiveness in terms of completion and retention in treatment as well as substance use, and to determine if any characteristics were associated with greater success in achieving abstinence. Studies had to report relevant outcomes and be available in English or French up to the end of January 2011, but not necessarily to have randomly allocated participants to therapeutic communities versus an alternative. Twelve such studies were found investigating outcomes from 61 therapeutic communities and 3271 participants. All but two studies were conducted in the Americas, and in all but two cocaine was the dominant problem drug. Differences between the studies were such that it was not appropriate to combine their findings in a meta-analysis...|$|R
