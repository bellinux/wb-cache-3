500|$|Jackson herself would {{comment on}} the album's legacy on her 2015 album Unbreakable. In the song [...] "Shoulda Known Better", she {{reflects}} on her optimistic wish that Rhythm Nation 1814 could have profoundly changed the world, noting that there are many, deeper issues to fix and that broad strokes aren't enough. The chorus includes the line, [...] "Cause I don't want <b>my</b> <b>face</b> <b>to</b> be / That poster child for being naive"; and Rhythm Nations title {{is referred to as}} [...] "an epiphany", with Jackson mentioning that [...] "next time, I'll know better." [...] Album co-producer Jimmy Jam told the BBC: [...] "When you're young, you feel like: 'I can change the world! I'm going to lead the revolution!' And then you look 25 years later and you go: 'OK, I should have known better. The same problems still exist but there's a different way to go about tackling it. It still involves mobilising people, but I can't do it by myself.' It's just a wiser, more mature look at the reality of trying to make a positive change, a social change." ...|$|E
2500|$|Losses on {{both sides}} were severe; among the {{casualties}} was Col. Avery, who was struck in the neck by a musket ball, felling him from his horse, where he was discovered after the charge by several of his soldiers and Major Tate of the 6th North Carolina. Unable to speak from his mortal wound, Avery scribbled a simple note for Tate: [...] "Major, tell my father I died with <b>my</b> <b>face</b> <b>to</b> the enemy. I. E. Avery." [...] He died the following day.|$|E

2500|$|One of the {{identified}} dead, Isaac E. Avery, died in action on July 2, 1863, at the Battle of Gettysburg. On that evening, his brigade stormed Cemetery Hill, trying to dislodge the Union forces. Halfway up the hill, {{he was hit}} in the throat by a musket ball. Mortally wounded, he fell from his horse. He scrawled his final words on a piece of paper: [...] "Tell my father I died with <b>my</b> <b>face</b> <b>to</b> the enemy." [...] Avery's body was carried as far as Williamsport, Maryland and buried there, but moved to the Washington Confederate Cemetery. A plaque was placed in the cemetery for him in 2007.|$|E
2500|$|Trinny and Susannah {{then take}} their pink box {{in search of}} older women {{to talk about their}} clothing. They find that many of them feel a lack of {{confidence}} and hide themselves behind clothing, and do not have any knowledge of what to wear. Then the process of Susannah being aged through prosthetics begins. To give an accurate depiction of how Susannah would look at the age of 70 years, a plastic surgeon and prosthetic expert take details of her lifestyle and examine past pictures to see how she is aging. When the face mask and body suit are fitted, Susannah is clearly distressed and states [...] "There is no way I'm going to look like this when I'm 70. I will not dress like this and I will not allow <b>my</b> <b>face</b> <b>to</b> become like this." [...] An elderly woman, Shirly Tripe, then takes Susannah shopping to find her some clothing from her own favourite shops. Susannah comments on Shirley's choice: [...] "It's a sack. This is a testament that older women, or mature women, benefit so much from tailoring." [...] Susannah then meets a shocked Trinny with her new appearance. The two fashionistas then aim to tackle what they believe older women should avoid; wearing loose fitting clothes. They take Shirley shopping to get some tighter fitting clothes, although Shirley shows much resistance and claims she looks like 'mutton dressed as lamb'.|$|E
2500|$|Richard Loncraine's 1995 filmic {{adaptation}} of Richard Eyre's 1990 stage production of Richard III features considerably less material from 3 Henry VI than had Olivier's film. Starring Ian McKellen as Richard (reprising his role {{from the stage}} production), John Wood as Edward, Nigel Hawthorne as George and Annette Bening as Queen Elizabeth, the film begins prior to the Battle of Tewkesbury, with Henry VI (portrayed by Edward Jewesbury) still in power. The opening scene depicts Henry and his son Edward (played by Christopher Bowen) preparing for the forthcoming battle. However, a surprise attack is launched on their headquarters by Richard, and both are killed. This scene is without dialogue. The last line of 3 Henry VI is also used in the film; Edward's [...] "For here I hope begins our lasting joy" [...] appears as a subtitle after the coronation of Edward and is altered to read [...] "And now, they hope, begins their lasting joy", with [...] "they" [...] referring to the House of York. The film then moves on to the coronation of Edward IV (again without dialogue), before Richard delivers the opening speech of Richard III as an after-dinner toast to the new king. Like Olivier's film, Loncraine includes several characters in the coronation scene who are not present {{in the text of}} 3 Henry VI; Buckingham (played by Jim Broadbent), Richmond (played by Dominic West) and Elizabeth Plantagenet (played by Kate Steavenson-Payne). Richmond will later go on to be Henry VII, and Elizabeth (King Edward's daughter) will become his queen. As with Jane Shore, Elizabeth is mentioned several times in Richard III, although she never appears in the text. Loncraine's film also used a line from 3 Henry VI in its poster campaign – [...] "I can smile and murder whiles I smile" [...] (3.2.182), although [...] "whiles" [...] was changed to [...] "while." [...] This line is also included in the film – after Richard concludes his opening speech to Edward, he enters the men's room and continues in soliloquy form to line twenty-seven of Richard III before then referring back to the earlier play [...] "Why, I can smile and murder while I smile/And wet my cheeks with artificial tears/And frame <b>my</b> <b>face</b> <b>to</b> all occasions" [...] (ll. 182-185). The film then moves on to the arrest of George.|$|E

6000|$|But oh, {{it is not}} enough, it is all no good.

60|$|At length Mr. Ravenor {{turned his}} head {{slightly}} and looked towards me. The eagerness which he saw in <b>my</b> <b>face</b> seemed <b>to</b> strike some grim vein of humour in him, for his lips parted a dreary, fleeting smile.|$|R
