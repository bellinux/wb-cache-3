5|$|In December 1954, 162 Puerto Ricans of the 65th Infantry were arrested, 95 were court martialed, and 91 {{were found}} guilty and sentenced to prison terms ranging from 1 to 18 years of hard labor. It was the largest mass court martial of the Korean War. The Secretary of the Army Robert T. Stevens <b>moved</b> <b>quickly</b> <b>to</b> remit the {{sentences}} and granted clemency and pardons to all those involved. Though {{the men who were}} court martialed were pardoned, there is currently a campaign for a formal exoneration.|$|E
5|$|In June 1945, Bradman faced a {{financial}} crisis when the firm of Harry Hodgetts collapsed due to fraud and embezzlement. Bradman <b>moved</b> <b>quickly</b> <b>to</b> set up his own business, utilising Hodgetts' client list and his old office in Grenfell Street, Adelaide. The fallout led to a prison term for Hodgetts, and left a stigma attached to Bradman's name in the city's business community for many years.|$|E

5|$|Michael II in Epirus was {{not part}} of the brothers' agreement, and {{continued}} to pursue his own policies independently of his uncles. In 1241, when Manuel died, Michael <b>moved</b> <b>quickly</b> <b>to</b> occupy Thessaly. In June of the same year, John Asen died, leaving the throne to his seven-year-old son Kaliman (r. 1241–46). Coupled with the increasingly deteriorating situation of the Latin Empire, this development left John Vatatzes of Nicaea as the pre-eminent ruler of the region, and the obvious candidate for the capture of Constantinople.|$|E
5|$|Roosevelt {{had been}} {{stricken}} with polio, {{and was one}} of the moving forces of the March of Dimes. The ten-cent coin could be changed by the Mint without the need for congressional action, and officials <b>moved</b> <b>quickly</b> <b>to</b> replace the Mercury dime. Chief Engraver John R. Sinnock prepared models, but faced repeated criticism from the Commission of Fine Arts. He modified his design in response, and the coin went into circulation in January 1946.|$|E
5|$|The Byzantines <b>moved</b> <b>quickly</b> <b>to</b> take {{advantage}} of their victory: a Byzantine army invaded Arab-held Armenia, and sometime in October or November, defeated and killed the emir Ali ibn Yahya. Thus, within a single campaigning season, the Byzantines had eliminated the three most dangerous opponents on their eastern border. In retrospect, these successes proved decisive, as the battle permanently destroyed the power of Melitene. The Byzantine victory at Lalakaon altered the strategic balance in the region, and heralded the beginning of Byzantium's century-long offensive in the East.|$|E

5|$|William was {{promptly}} excommunicated and Henry <b>moved</b> <b>quickly</b> <b>to</b> suppress the revolt. The barons {{in the north}} were ordered to besiege William's castles, including Skipsea, and William shortly surrendered himself to the King and was ultimately pardoned. Following the rebellion, Henry ordered Skipsea Castle to be destroyed, although it is uncertain to what extent this order was actually carried out. William passed on the castle to his own son, another William, but {{on the death of}} his son's widow, Isabella, it passed to the Crown in 1293.|$|E
5|$|After the {{approval}} of the legislation, the Vermont Sesquicentennial Commission <b>moved</b> <b>quickly</b> <b>to</b> secure designs to be used for the half dollar. Members decided to have the coin show Ira Allen on the obverse, and the Battle of Bennington Monument on the reverse. They commissioned Sherry Fry, who had created a statue of Allen for the University of Vermont, to design the coin. On July 1, 1925, Fry wrote to Charles Moore, chairman of the Commission of Fine Arts (charged by a 1921 executive order by President Warren G. Harding with rendering advisory opinions on public artworks, including coins), informing him that the models would be ready in about a week.|$|E
5|$|Anglo-Saxon London, called Lundenwic, {{was located}} a mile west of Roman Londinium, but Lundenwic was undefended, and the {{restoration}} {{was carried out}} inside {{the walls of the}} old Roman city, especially an area close to the River Thames now called Queenhithe, but which was then known as Æthelred's Hythe after its Mercian ruler. Æthelred <b>moved</b> <b>quickly</b> <b>to</b> restore the area; in 889 he and Alfred granted property there to the Bishop of Worcester, and in 899 they made another grant to the Archbishop of Canterbury. Both bishops were, like Æthelred, Mercians and strong allies of King Alfred, who had the right to all tolls from markets along the river bank.|$|E

5|$|Fearing the Dutch {{would attempt}} to re-establish their {{authority}} over Indonesia, the new Republican Government and its leaders <b>moved</b> <b>quickly</b> <b>to</b> strengthen the fledgling administration. Within Indonesia, the newly formed government, although enthusiastic, was fragile and focused in Java (where focused at all). It was rarely and loosely {{in contact with the}} outer islands, which had more Japanese troops (particularly in Japanese naval areas), less sympathetic Japanese commanders, and fewer Republican leaders and activists. In November 1945, a parliamentary form of government was established and Sjahrir was appointed Prime Minister.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to this emerging threat, Brock <b>moved</b> <b>quickly</b> <b>to</b> bolster Canadian defences. He strengthened the fortifications of Quebec by building walls and an elevated battery. Brock succeeded in creating a formidable defensive position due largely to his military reading, which included several volumes on the science of running and setting up artillery. He also rearranged and strengthened the Provincial Marine (responsible for transport on the lakes and rivers). He ordered warships to be built and developed a naval force capable of holding the Great Lakes. This was to be pivotal during the war. But Brock's appropriation of civilian lands and labour for military use brought him into conflict with the civilian authorities led by Thomas Dunn.|$|E
5|$|Knowing {{that his}} {{reputation}} {{was at stake}} following the much publicised Tora! Tora! Tora! debacle, Kurosawa <b>moved</b> <b>quickly</b> <b>to</b> a new project to prove he was still viable. To his aid came friends and famed directors Keisuke Kinoshita, Masaki Kobayashi and Kon Ichikawa, who together with Kurosawa established in July 1969 a production company called the Club of the Four Knights (Yonki no kai). Although the plan was for the four directors to create a film each, {{it has been suggested}} that the real motivation for the other three directors was to make it easier for Kurosawa to successfully complete a film, and therefore find his way back into the business.|$|E

Units of the Airlanding Artillery and Divisional HQ headed into Wolfheze and Oosterbeek where medical officers {{set up a}} Regimental Aid Post {{at the home of}} Kate ter Horst.|$|E
5|$|The Italians {{handed over}} the {{administration}} of eastern Herzegovina to the NDH government on 20 May 1941, following {{the signing of the}} Treaties of Rome, which ceded formerly Yugoslav territory along the Adriatic coast to Italy. The Italians did not immediately withdraw all their troops from the region. The NDH <b>moved</b> <b>quickly</b> <b>to</b> establish its authority in the towns and districts of eastern Herzegovina, which included appointing mayors and prefects, the creation of local units of the Ustaše Militia, and deploying hundreds of gendarmes, Croatian Home Guards and Ustaše Militia units from outside eastern Herzegovina. These forces were brought in to maintain order. The academic Professor Alija Šuljak was appointed the Ustaše commissioner for eastern Herzegovina.|$|E
5|$|When the Buffalo nickel {{had been}} struck for 25 years and could be {{replaced}} without an act of Congress, the Mint <b>moved</b> <b>quickly</b> <b>to</b> replace it. Although the Fraser design is popular today among numismatists, it did not enjoy that status in 1938, {{and there was no}} public outcry at the decision. In January 1938, the Mint announced an open competition for the new nickel design, with the winner to receive a prize of $1,000. Anticipating the 1943 bicentennial of Jefferson's birth, competitors were to place his portrait on the obverse, and a depiction of his house Monticello on the reverse.|$|E

5|$|With the {{outbreak}} of fresh fighting in 1648, a Royalist army of 8,000 fresh recruits was mustered {{under the command of}} General Rowland Laugharne and Sir Edward Stradling, with the intent of retaking Cardiff. Parliamentary forces in Brecon under the command of Colonel Thomas Horton <b>moved</b> <b>quickly</b> <b>to</b> reinforce the castle, although with only 3,000 men they were content to wait until a larger army under Oliver Cromwell could arrive from Gloucester. With time against them, the Royalist army attacked, leading to the battle of St Fagans just to the west of Cardiff, and a heavy Royalist defeat.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} four months of 1945, III Corps <b>moved</b> <b>quickly</b> <b>to</b> the offensive. On 25 February, the corps, now as part of the First Army, {{established}} a bridgehead over the Roer River, which, in turn, led to the capture of the Ludendorff Bridge at Remagen, on the Rhine River, on 7 March. On 30 March, the Edersee Dam was captured intact by Task Force Wolfe of the 7th Armored Division, and the corps, now commanded by Major General James Van Fleet after Millikin's relief, continued the attack to seize the Ruhr Pocket on 5 April 1945. In late April, III Corps reformed and launched a drive through Bavaria towards Austria. On 2 May 1945, III Corps was ordered to halt at the Inn River on the Austrian border, just days before V-E Day, when the German forces surrendered, bringing an end of World War II in Europe.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{outbreak}} of war Australian forces <b>moved</b> <b>quickly</b> <b>to</b> reduce the threat to shipping posed by the proximity of Germany's Pacific colonies. The Australian Naval and Military Expeditionary Force (AN), a 2000-man volunteer force—separate from the AIF—and consisting of an infantry battalion plus 500 naval reservists and ex-sailors, was rapidly formed {{under the command of}} Colonel William Holmes. The objectives of the force were the wireless stations on Nauru, and those at Yap in the Caroline Islands, and at Rabaul in German New Guinea. The force reached Rabaul on 11 September 1914 and occupied it the next day, encountering only brief resistance from the German and native defenders during fighting at Bita Paka and Toma. German New Guinea surrendered on 17 September 1914. Australian losses were light, including six killed during the fighting.|$|E
