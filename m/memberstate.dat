40|$|This paper {{compares the}} changes in the structures, process, and {{outcomes}} related to tobacco control and population health between (1) the “old EU” 15 members and (2) the recent 12 accession members, mainly from Central and Eastern Europe. Based on the stages of the Tobacco Epidemic Model and coercive policy transfer through the EU, we expect to find that policies in these two sets of countries will increasingly converge and that establishment of stronger tobacco control policies will improve population health indicators in both parts of Europe, but more rapidly in Accession members than in old-EU members. Utilizing a large data set from WHO Europe, we compare both groups from 1990 to the present. In the old EU, more restrictive tobacco control policies have been adopted over time through both internal <b>memberstate</b> processes and through policy transfer from the EU. Accession countries had few discernible tobacco control policies in place, but increased their policies enacted through having to adhere to the acquis communautaire of the EU as well as through other processes. We find convergence between Older and Accession countries both in number of policies adopted and in several smoking and population health outcomes although longer-term {{differences between men and women}} remain in Accession countries. Europeanization in tobacco control appears in both groups of countries, but the ”coercive policy transfer” of the Accession process apparently acts to speed up policy learning and outcomes in CEE countries...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to explain the paradox of the <b>memberstates</b> {{willingness}} to surrender power of important issues such as asylum and refugee policy and therefore partly abandon its sovereignty. We also discuss the relation between internationalization, regionalization and globalization since these processes form the context in which our research problem is found. A case study is used as a method in this paper. In our quest for answers we use a theory of internationalization that we place in its context by primarily discussing the relation between globalization and regionalization. The theory is used as an explanatory force and to give it a concrete form we operationalised its three processes; internationalization of problems, internationalization of the societies and internationalization of the descisionmaking. The result of the case study shows that the increase in asylumseekers leads to a higher risk of negative competition wich give rise to the <b>memberstates</b> need to coordinate their politics. We found that when societies and problems are being internationalized, the state finds it difficult to resolve problems on their own and this leads to the internationalization of the dedescisionmaking. The internationalization of the decision-making process is therefore natural, which in this case means the decisions are taken by the EU rather than by the member states...|$|R

As a result of litigations regardingthe applications with a reduced value arising among physical or legal persons, it was felt the need for acommunity legislation that would guarantee identical conditions, both for creditors and debtors throughoutthe entire European Union territory. The European procedure regarding the debts recovery of reducedvalue facilitates the access to justice and it is characterized by simplifying and expediting the settling of thetransboundary litigations, reducing costs, the recognition and execution of the court order in a <b>MemberState</b> given in another Member State. This procedure is available to litigants {{as an alternative to}} theprocedures provided by the laws of Member States. The Regulation (EC) no. 861 / 2007 establishing aEuropean procedure regarding the applications with reduced value applies in civil and commercial matters inthe transboundary cases, regardless the nature of the court when the application value, without taking intoaccount the interest, expenditures and other costs, does not exceed 2000 Euro at the time of receiving theapplication form by the competent court. This procedure does not apply to revenue, customs oradministrative matters or in regard to state responsibility for acts or omissions in exercising the publicauthority, and other matters specifically referred to in the Regulation.

40|$|This study aims {{to address}} the longstanding {{questions}} surrounding the consistently low levels of support articulated towards the European Union (EU) by British citizens. Existing studies highlight that political identities {{are closely related to}} the levels of support citizens across the EU express for the process of European integration. Citizens who define their identity in exclusively national terms tend also to oppose the process of European integration and their country’s participation in this process. Present studies, however, fail to provide an adequate account of the emergence of exclusively national identities and their prevalence in member-states such as the UK. The citizens of the UK have expressed consistently low levels of support for the process of European integration and for British membership of what is now the EU, since Britain’s accession to the European Economic Community (EEC) over 30 years ago. Similarly, the UK {{has one of the highest}} proportions of citizens who define their identity in exclusively national terms of any EU <b>memberstate.</b> The argument presented in this thesis is that the low levels of support for the EU and the prevalence of exclusively national identity constructions amongst UK citizens must be understood in the context of British discourses about the EU. I employ the conception of subjectivity developed by post-structuralist discourse theory in order to examine the emergence of an exclusively national form of British identity within media debates on the EU treaty reform process. Discourse theory offers a set of concepts and logics through which it is possible to investigate the structure of eurosceptic discourses. Furthermore, drawing on the insights from Lacanian psychoanalysis, it is able to account also for the strength and longevity of these constructions of national identity. This thesis identifies a eurosceptic discourse of British national identity characterised by an underlying logic of nationalism, according to which nations are seen as natural political communities and the nation-state the most logical unit of political organisation. This is evident not only in debates about the powers of the EU, but also in the relationship constructed between the UK and other member-states in the EU. In addition, the EU is itself constructed as a quasi-state and functions in these discourses as the ‘other’ against which Britain is defined. The former is seen as a hostile, foreign power bent on assuming ever greater control over the UK. These constructions of Britain and the EU feed into fantasmatic constructions of subjugation and oppression, which help account for the strength and resilience of eurosceptic discourses. The final part of the thesis examines the pro-European voices in the British media. However, it is not possible to discern a coherent pro-European discourse in the same way in which it is possible to identify the eurosceptic discourse. I outline the extent to which these pro-European voices challenge the predominant eurosceptic discourse, and offer alternative constructions of Britain’s relationship with the EU which may form the basis of more inclusive identity constructions.

40|$|With a {{focus on}} the role of the European Commission it is argued, why the process of European {{integration}} shows a parallel development with an enlargement of competences and an increasing scope of political options for the Commission. These options are not simply legal competences. From a political science perspective it is more interesting to study how the Commission manages to overcome obstacles and legal restrictions. This leads to wider and deeper Europeanization of national politics and policies. The process of European integration is described in the perspective of permanence and change. Than theoretical approaches to explain the role of the Commission are discussed. As a result a new approach is presented. It starts with two background variables, the qualities of the analyzed actor and the preconditions for self-running processes. Self-interest orientation and the main aim to create a supranational actor like the Commission are widely overlapping. This leads to an explanation of strategic indifference as an orientation for the Commission`s work. As an additional source for a wider range of options functional relations like spill-overs and external effects are discussed. The European Commission plays a central role in the process of European integration for several reasons: her position in the EU polity, the range and depth of her tasks, the functioning of European law with a bias in favour of integration, especially the Commission`s freedom to choose between different arenas of actors and different strategies. This result is presented by several case studies. The study offers a more general explanation beyond the conditions of the different European policies. The analysis of the process of "widening competences partout" shows that more political options do not lead to a higher quality of European politics. <b>Memberstates</b> react on their deminished influence with an insufficient supply of ressources for the European level. The aims for European integration stay underdetermined. The Commission`s success in Europeanization creates problems in terms of efficiency and legitimacy. This is less a problem for the Commission and more a question of responsibility for the <b>memberstates.</b> They have to decide, how much national control over European developement they accept to give up for the sake of a more effective and legitimate European system of decision-making...|$|R
40|$|In this project, I {{analyze and}} discuss {{a number of}} issues related to the basis of {{transnational}} identity and legitimacy at European Union level. The European Union has often been criticized for its ’democratic deficit’ and lack of popular support. At a time when the economic crisis increases the interdependence of the EU <b>memberstates,</b> it seems more urgent than ever for the EU to develop a transnational sense of cohesion and ensure democratic legitimacy. The newly opened European Citizen’s Initiative (since April 1, 2012) thus appears like a much-needed political response to this central issue. Nevertheless I conclude on the basis of my analysis, that a so-called European identity is still a weak concept largely due to the nation state’s historical monopoly on a cultural-based and unifying collective identity. Furthermore I claim, that EU's democratic legitimacy will continue to be dominated by a performance-based output legitimacy, whereby the degree of democracy depends on the European Commission's ability to incorporate external political discourses in realistic and effective legislative proposals...|$|R

40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{analysis}} „Political Participation and Placement on Left-Right Scale based on European Social Survey Data“ is to describe the relation between political participation and political views on left-right scale. Socio-economical variables are also added to demonstrate their influence on the previously mentioned relation. Political participation is often understood and analyzed in terms of voting behavior. In this paper broader definition of participation is used. Political participation is an attempt of an individual or a group to influence the process of political decision-making. Taken from the European Social Survey 2011, three possibilities of political participation are considered: singing petition, participating lawful public demonstration and working in another organization. To view political views of individuals, their self-placement on left-right scale is used. At {{the beginning of this}} paper I constructed an argument based on theories of Robert E. Lane, David O. Sears and Giovanni Sartori about extreme views and political participation. I claim that people with extreme views tend to be politically more active than people with moderate political views. This claim did not get asserted in this paper. It came out that only people with left-extreme views are politically more active than moderates and right-wing extremists in general are not. The only exception occurred in working in another organization where in some cases there were more active participants among right-wing extremists than among people with moderate views. Higher level of education influenced participation as theory suggested. Participation level was higher among people with 15 years and more education than people with less education. Influence was similar inside all political viewgroups: left-wing extremist, moderates and right-wing extremists as well. Theory also suggests that people with higher level of household income participate more. It also got confirmed as participation rates gradually rise when family income increases. When considering the age of the most active participation, it should be middle age, somewhere between forties and fifties. Current analysis confirms that and shows that people who participate are on an average younger than people who have not participated in last 12 months in specific form of political participation. When looking data about states separately, the main trend is that citizens of European Union old <b>memberstates</b> participate more than people from new <b>memberstates.</b> In addition, in countries where the participation rates are high in general, participation rates of left-wing extremists are extremely high. On the other hand when looking into an example of working in other organizations, participation rate among people who consider themselves right-wing extremists is quite high when compared to signing petitions and attending demonstrations...|$|R

40|$|Prior {{research}} on citizen support for European integration has primarily focused on individuals' {{evaluations of the}} process of integration or its institutions, with emphasis on the importance of direct benefits and costs integration can confer. These models do not consider individuals' evaluations of other European nationalities or of the member states. This paper will fill the gap in the research by formulating and testing a political cohesion model, which is complementary to preexisting models. The analysis synthesizes systems theory with political psychology to produce a core claim that the probability of supporting integration and developing a European identity increases with greater levels of political cohesion among European citizens and among these citizens and the European Union <b>memberstates.</b> The development of political cohesion, as measured by the amount of trust in Europeans and member-states, is assumed to be reflective of positive images of these two types of subjects. Political cohesion is especially critical when individuals consider nationalities of the southern periphery given their lower economic development. Therefore, trust in southern EU nationalities improves the probability that an individual will have a European identity and support integration, more so than rust in the northern EU nationalities. In addition, integration's development is marked by changes in the allocation of sovereignty that is determined by the relatively more powerful European member-states...|$|R

Although the result isthat the trade agreement with Singapore is‘mixed’, and therefore {{also needs to be}} ratified by all the 28 member states, this Opinion may actually contribute to the credibility and effectiveness of the EU’s trade policy. In line with the EU’s broadened trade competences, brought about by the Treaty of Lisbon, the Court confirmed that the EU has the exclusive competences to realise almost all its broad trade-related objectives in ‘EU-only’ FTAs, covering trade in goods, services, intellectual property rights, public procurement and sustainable development. If investor-state dispute settlement and portfolio investment are excluded, such future EU FTAs will not be jeopardised by 28 additional – and sometimes unpredictable – ratification procedures in the <b>memberstates.</b> The Commission should therefore pursue ‘EU-only’ FTAs and cover portfolio investment and investor-state dispute settlement, such as the new Investment Court System, in separate agreements, or not at all. Member states on the other hand should refrain from deliberately making EU FTAs mixed, as this would contradict the spirit of the Lisbon Treaty and the Court’s case-law...|$|R
