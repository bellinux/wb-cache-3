40|$|Lunar impact melt {{deposits}} have unique physical properties. They have {{among the}} highest observed radar returns at S-Band (12. 6 cm wavelength), implying that they are rough at the decimeter scale. However, they are also observed in high-resolution optical imagery to be quite smooth at the meter scale. These characteristics distinguish them from well-studied terrestrial analogues, such as Hawaiian pahoehoe and a a lava flows. The morphology of impact melt deposits {{can be related to}} their emplacement conditions, so understanding the origin of these unique surface properties will help to inform us as to the circumstances under which they were formed. In this work, we seek to find a terrestrial analogue for well-preserved lunar impact <b>melt</b> <b>flows</b> by examining fresh lava flows on Earth. We compare the radar return and high-resolution topographic variations of impact <b>melt</b> <b>flows</b> to terrestrial lava flows with a range of surface textures. The lava flows examined in this work range from smooth Hawaiian pahoehoe to transitional basaltic flows at Craters of the Moon (COTM) National Monument and Preserve in Idaho to rubbly and spiny pahoehoe-like flows at the recent eruption at Holuhraun in Iceland. The physical properties of lunar impact <b>melt</b> <b>flows</b> appear to differ from those of all the terrestrial lava flows studied in this work. This may be due to (a) differences in post-emplacement modification processes or (b) fundamental differences in the surface texture of the <b>melt</b> <b>flows</b> due to the melts' unique emplacement and/or cooling environment. Information about the surface properties of lunar impact melt deposits will be critical for future landed missions that wish to sample these materials...|$|R
40|$|Impact <b>melt</b> <b>flows</b> are {{observed}} within the continuous and discontinuous ejecta blanket of the 9  km lunar crater Pierazzo, from the crater rim {{to more than}} 40  km away {{from the center of}} the crater. Our mapping, fractal analysis, and thermal modeling suggest that melt can be emplaced ballistically and, upon landing, can become separated from solid ejecta to form the observed flow features. Our analysis is based on the identification of established melt morphology for these in-ejecta flows and supported by fractal analysis and thermal modeling. We computed the fractal dimension for the flow boundaries and found values of D =  1. 05 – 1. 17. These are consistent with terrestrial basaltic lava flows (D =  1. 06 – 1. 2) and established lunar impact <b>melt</b> <b>flows</b> (D =  1. 06 – 1. 18), but inconsistent with lunar dry granular flows (D =  1. 31 – 1. 34). <b>Melt</b> <b>flows</b> within discontinuous ejecta deposits are noted within just 1. 5 % of the mapping area, suggesting that the surface expression of impact melt in the extended ejecta around craters of this size is rare, most likely due to the efficient mixing of melts with solid ejecta and local target rocks. However, if the ejected fragments (both, molten and solid) are large enough, segregation of melt and its consequent flow is possible. As most of the flows mapped in this work occur on crater-facing slopes, the development of defined <b>melt</b> <b>flows</b> within ejecta deposits might be facilitated by high crater-facing topography restricting the flow of ejecta soon after it makes ground contact, limiting the quenching of molten ejecta through turbulent mixing with solid debris. Our study confirms the idea that impact melt can travel far beyond the continuous ejecta blanket, adding to the lunar regolith over an extensive area...|$|R

40|$|The Mini-RF radar on the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter's {{spacecraft}} {{has revealed}} {{a great variety}} of crater ejecta <b>flow</b> and impact <b>melt</b> deposits, some of which were not observed in prior radar imaging. The craters Tycho and Glushko have long <b>melt</b> <b>flows</b> that exhibit variations in radar backscatter and circular polarization ratio along the flow. Comparison with optical imaging reveals that these changes are caused by features commonly seen in terrestrial lava flows, such as rafted plates, pressure ridges, and ponding. Small (less than 20 km) sized craters also show a large variety of features, including <b>melt</b> <b>flows</b> and ponds. Two craters have flow features that may be ejecta flows caused by entrained debris flowing across the surface rather than by melted rock. The circular polarization ratios (CPRs) of the impact <b>melt</b> <b>flows</b> are typically very high; even ponded areas have CPR values between 0. 7 - 1. 0. This high CPR suggests that deposits that appear smooth in optical imagery may be rough at centimeter- and decimeter- scales. In some places, ponds and flows are visible with no easily discernable source crater. These melt deposits may have come from oblique impacts that are capable of ejecting melted material farther downrange. They may also be associated with older, nearby craters that no longer have a radar-bright proximal ejecta blanket. The observed morphology of the lunar crater flows has implications for similar features observed on Venus. In particular, changes in backscatter along many of the ejecta flows are probably caused by features typical of lava flows...|$|R

30|$|Self-secondaries {{formed on}} normal ejecta {{deposits}} have been unambiguously confirmed, but their occurrence on different-sized melt pools {{needs to be}} confirmed. The morphology and geometry of many small craters on the melt pools of Tycho are consistent with being self-secondaries, but this hypothesis needs to be tested by comparing the possible trajectory time of spall fragments, the movement time of <b>melt</b> <b>flows</b> considering the initial outward momentum, and the cooling time of melt pools (Xiao et al. 2016). The occurrence and possible dominance of self-secondaries on melt pools would reveal the emplacement sequence of self-secondaries {{in the frame of}} the formation of continuous ejecta deposits. On the other hand, it has been frequently quoted that self-secondaries that are located at larger distances from the parent crater rim have larger crater densities (Zanetti et al. 2015, 2017). This possible trend is established after studying the whole crater populations on the continuous ejecta deposits of Tycho and Aristarchus. However, {{it should be noted that}} continuous ejecta deposits of complex craters are composed of different ejecta facies, as impact <b>melt</b> <b>flows</b> that postdate the modification stage have altered the local density of self-secondaries to different degrees (e.g., Fig.  3).
