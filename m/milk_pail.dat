One day he noticed a bee tree and returned from hunting early to get the wash tub and <b>milk</b> <b>pail</b> to collect the honey.

500|$|Bret Hart came to {{the ring}} for his match with Jerry Lawler. Lawler, however, {{appeared}} on crutches and claimed {{that he had been}} injured in a car accident. He announced that his court jester, Doink the Clown (portrayed by Matt Osborne), would wrestle Hart in his place. Doink threw a bucket of water on Bret's brother, Bruce Hart, prompting Bret to attack Doink outside of the ring. The match consisted of angry brawling until Doink slowed the pace with a couple of submission holds. After Doink missed a Whoopie Cushion attempt, Bret took full control of the match and locked Doink in the Sharpshooter. With Doink in the sharpshooter, Lawler then attacked Bret with a crutch, revealing that he was not injured and thus causing an unofficial disqualification(no official announcement was made). WWF President Jack Tunney {{came to the}} ring and had Howard Finkel announce that Lawler would be given a lifetime ban if he refused to compete in the scheduled match. The match between Lawler and Hart consisted almost exclusively of brawling. The two attacked each other with a <b>milk</b> <b>pail</b> and crutches and traded punches and kicks. Bret used Lawler's signature move, the piledriver, before putting him in the Sharpshooter. Lawler submitted, but Bret refused to release him {{for three and a half}} minutes. The referee then reversed his decision and gave the victory and title of [...] "Undisputed King of the World Wrestling Federation" [...] to Lawler.|$|E

The initial name of the family was Schöchter(t). In the Moselle Franconian dialect (the base of the German dialect spoken by the Transylvanian Saxons), Schöchtert means a wooden <b>milking</b> <b>pail</b> and a Schöchter is a cooper who manufactures <b>milking</b> <b>pails.</b>|$|R
40|$|Aim: The {{present study}} was carried out to explore the {{potential}} source of contamination and the efficacy of different washing practices towards quality milk production. Materials and Methods: Probable sources of contamination viz. stored water, potable water, milker’s hands, <b>milking</b> <b>pail,</b> udder of individual buffalo and milk cans were subjected to different types of bacterial counts before the actual experiment to start. Twenty milch buffaloes thereafter were divided randomly into four treatment groups where washing was performed in each step viz. milker hands, udder of individual buffalo, <b>milking</b> <b>pail</b> and <b>milk</b> cans before milking either with water (T 0 : stored water, T 1 : potable water) or sanitizers (T 2 : 200 ppm chlorine solution, T 3 : 50 ppm iodophore solution) for 60 days. Bacterial counts again were performed for last 5 alternate days for all the sources involved along with the microbial load of raw milk. Data obtained were subjected to standard statistical analysis. Results: It was found that for all bacterial count stored water contributed significantly higher {{as compared to the}} potable water. Among the other potential sources of contamination (log/ 6 cm 2), standard plate count (SPC) and coliform count were significantly highest for <b>milking</b> <b>pail</b> (6. 73 ± 0. 02) and udder of milch buffaloes (3. 77 ± 0. 12), respectively, while for Staphylococci count both <b>milking</b> <b>pail</b> (3. 24 ± 0. 02) and milking can (3. 22 ± 0. 04) were contributed maximally (p 0. 05) for most of the parameters, even for the raw milk quality. Conclusion: Study revealed that milker hands, <b>milking</b> <b>pails,</b> udder of animals, milk cans and stored water used for washing of equipment are the potential source of contamination in raw milk. These were counted as critical point which needs attention for the production of high-quality milk. Potable water was found to be better than stored water. The use of either chlorine 200 ppm and iodophor 50 ppm is highly effective in reducing the bacterial population for quality milk production...|$|R

6000|$|The {{furniture}} is simple as the building. Three stones and a hole form the fireplace, near which sleep the children, kids, and lambs: there being no chimney, {{the interior is}} black with soot. The cow-skin couches are suspended during the day, like arms and other articles which suffer from rats and white ants, by loops of cord to the sides. The principal ornaments are basket-work bottles, gaily adorned with beads, cowris, and stained leather. Pottery being here unknown, the Bedouins twist the fibres of a root into various shapes, and make them water-tight with the powdered bark of another tree. [22] The Han is a large wicker-work bucket, mounted in a framework of sticks, and used to contain water on journeys. The Guraf (a word derived from the Arabic [...] "Ghurfah") is a conical-shaped vessel, used to bale out {{the contents of a}} well. The Del, or <b>milk</b> <b>pail,</b> is shaped like two cones joined at the base by lateral thongs, the upper and smaller half acting as cup and cover. And finally the Wesi, or water bottle, contains the traveller's store for drinking and religious ablution.|$|E

50|$|By {{the end of}} the 1930s, {{roadside}} eateries {{were spread}} throughout most major highways. To stay competitive, restaurants needed to provide variety for their patrons, to stand out from other establishments. The Country Tea Room initially struggled with this change, but was able to reinvent itself as the <b>Milk</b> <b>Pail</b> Restaurant, a full restaurant with unique entrees. Part of the property was converted into The Fin 'n Feather Catalogue, which sold smoked game, some of which featured on the <b>Milk</b> <b>Pail</b> menu. McGraw bought the surrounding land, named it the McGraw Wildlife Foundation, and opened it as a private game preserve. The main building was added to the National Register of Historic Places on February 25, 1999. Today, the <b>Milk</b> <b>Pail</b> remains open and is a popular local location for wedding receptions.|$|E

The men would bring up their <b>milking</b> <b>pails,</b> their pans, their churns, their cheese presses, and their kettles for cooking, and thus live in a sort of encampment while the grass lasted, and make butter and cheese to carry down the mountain with them when they returned.|$|R

The chickens seemed depressed, but the irrepressible bluejay screamed amid it all, with the same insolent spirit, his plumage untarnished by the wet.

He learned first to make cake stamps (cookie cutters), pill boxes and other simple items. Next, he formed objects such as <b>milk</b> <b>pails,</b> basins, cake and pie pans.
