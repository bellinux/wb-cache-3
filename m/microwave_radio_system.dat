40|$|This paper {{presents}} an algorithm {{to determine the}} coefficients of a general data-predistorter with memory for compensation of high-power amplifier (HPA) nonlinearities in digital <b>microwave</b> <b>radio</b> <b>system.</b> That technique is based on modeling the predistorter-modulaWr -HPA system as a neural network with memory. It is shown that by extending the optimization algorithm of back-propagation to complex signals and with neurons modeled as FIR filters, the proposed algorilhm determines automatically the predistorter with the objective that the overall transmitter behaves as a linear system willa a prescribed pulse shape. The novelty with respect to previous techniques is that in our scheme a control on the spectrum of the signal after the HPA is exercised. This minimizes the interference between adjacent channels. The algotithm as been tested successfully in several radio system employing QAM signal formats and some exam-. ples of application will be reported...|$|E

40|$|Wireless {{communication}} is observing a fast development in today’s communication era. In mobile communication the Base Transceiver Station (BTS) to Base Station Controller (BSC) or Mobile Switching Centre (MSC) link {{is based on}} microwave link. Therefore, analysis and planning of a microwave link is very much important. The microwave equipment can be installed after a careful planning and detailed analysis a <b>microwave</b> <b>radio</b> <b>system.</b> A poorly designed path can result in periodic system outages, resulting in increased system latency, decreased throughput, or worst case, a complete failure of the system. Planning a good, stable and reliable microwave network can be quite challenging. At the same time, it poses several interesting optimization problems.

This paper presents measurements of fading on the modulated signal backscattered from a transponder for backscatter <b>radio</b> <b>systems</b> that use multiple antennas at the interrogator and transponder. Measurements were performed at 5. 8 GHz and estimates of the backscatter channel envelope distributions and fade margins were calculated. Results show that multipath fading can be re-duced using multiple transponder antennas, bistatic interrogators with widely separated transmitter and receiver antennas, and conventional diversity combining at the interrogator receiver. The measured envelope distribution estimates are compared to previously derived distributions and show good agreement.
