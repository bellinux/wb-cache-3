5|$|History <b>may</b> <b>never</b> <b>know</b> {{the true}} story of Lee's {{intentions}} at Gettysburg. He never published memoirs, and his after-action report from the battle was cursory. Most of the senior commanders of the charge were casualties and did not write reports. Pickett's report was apparently so bitter that Lee ordered him to destroy it, and no copy has been found.|$|E
5|$|Their mission completed, Gabe and Lian {{call in the}} U.S. Army Chemical and Biological Defense Command (CBDC) {{to secure}} the area. They {{do not know how}} far Markinson was {{cooperating}} with Rhoemer and Phagan, but Gabe believes they <b>may</b> <b>never</b> <b>know.</b> In a post-credits scene, Aramov approaches a mysterious man inside the Agency headquarters and whispers something in his ear. He congratulates her while the camera pulls back to show PharCom boxes in the office.|$|E
25|$|While {{the family}} <b>may</b> <b>never</b> <b>know</b> what has {{happened}} to Caylee Marie Anthony, they now have closure for this chapter of their life. They will now begin the long process of rebuilding their lives. Despite the baseless defense chosen by Casey Anthony, the family believes that the Jury made a fair decision based on the evidence presented, the testimony presented, the scientific information presented and the rules that were given to them by the Honorable Judge Perry to guide them. The family hopes that they will be given the time by the media to reflect on this verdict and decide the best way to move forward privately.|$|E

25|$|Rumors also {{circulated}} that Hinrichs {{intended to}} detonate his homemade bomb inside the stadium; these included {{allegations that he}} tried to enter the stadium that evening but was denied entry after he refused to be searched. Hinrichs was not a student football season ticket holder; {{there was no evidence that}} Hinrichs tried to enter the stadium, and Hinrichs apparently neither bought nor tried to buy a game ticket. Agents scoured hundreds of hours of security camera tapes and found no images of Hinrichs, but, since not all entrances had cameras, they conceded they <b>may</b> <b>never</b> <b>know</b> if Hinrichs wanted to enter or tried to enter the stadium that night. Boren noted that Hinrichs waited until the game was underway and pre-game fans and students had cleared the South Oval; there would have been injuries or deaths to bystanders had Hinrichs detonated his device in the same area prior to or after the game.|$|E
25|$|Mandy and Adam {{were later}} shown the entire suicide note. Mandy reports that Adam {{immediately}} voiced {{that he did}} not see anything on the letter than indicated it was written by Daniel, and the note appeared to be 'cold' and 'matter-of-fact'. The note also stated 'don't blame the guy I was with last night'. When Mandy and Adam asked the Police if they had looked into who the note was referring to, the Police said they didn't know, <b>may</b> <b>never</b> <b>know,</b> and that they weren't ever going to find out all the answers. Mandy reported that in hindsight, she doesn't feel Dagenham Police were investigating properly, and they wouldn't have had to look very far to find out Port was behind it, and save another family from emotional turmoil. When Mandy wished to challenge the open verdict or continue investigation, she reported that she was told that nothing more could be done, and she felt there was an attitude of 'it is what it is, deal with it'.|$|E
500|$|Barrymore {{may have}} {{appeared}} in his first films in 1912. In four short films, a cast member is listed as [...] "Jack Barrymore"; this is probably John Barrymore, although Norden notes that [...] "we <b>may</b> <b>never</b> <b>know</b> for certain if [...] are in fact Barrymore movies." [...] The four films were Dream of a Motion Picture Director, The Widow Casey's Return, A Prize Package (all 1912) and One on Romance (1913). The films were produced by the Philadelphia-based Lubin Manufacturing Company and were lost in an explosion and fire at the Lubin vaults in 1914.|$|E

If Spider-Girl has any {{children}} in the future, they too would have an Uncle Ben - May's baby brother. Ironically {{in the aftermath of}} Spider-Verse, the Earth-3145's Ben Parker himself would stay on her world, and has a chance to be his grandfather, something that the other Ben Parkers were unable to achieve on account of their deaths.|$|R

2500|$|One {{of the few}} {{sources for}} numbers of abductions across {{international}} borders is the United States Department of State which acts as the United States Central Authority for the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction, although even they preface these numbers with the warning that [...] "Under the Convention, return applications may also be filed either directly with the Central Authority of the state where the child is located or with a foreign court with jurisdiction to hear the return request. The left-behind parent may pursue return without involving the U.S. Central Authority. In these circumstances, the U.S. Central Authority <b>may</b> <b>never</b> <b>know</b> about such a request and its disposition". [...] Although the State Department published compliance reports for 1998 through 2008 it only began publishing the number of [...] "new cases" [...] {{in a given year}} in 2007. [...] In 2009, an article published by a State Department public outreach coordinator also listed the totals for years 2006-2008.|$|E
2500|$|For three months, UN officials, the CDC, {{and others}} argued against {{investigating}} {{the source of}} the outbreak. Gregory Hartl, a spokesman for the World Health Organization (WHO), said finding the cause of the outbreak was [...] "not important". [...] "Right now, there is no active investigation. I cannot say one way or another [...] It is not something we are thinking about at the moment. What we are thinking about is the public health response in Haiti." [...] Jordan Tappero, the lead epidemiologist at the CDC, said the main task was to control the outbreak, not to look for {{the source of the}} bacteria and that [...] "we <b>may</b> <b>never</b> <b>know</b> the actual origin of this cholera strain." [...] A CDC spokesperson, Kathryn Harben, added that [...] "at some point in the future, when many different analyses of the strain are complete, {{it may be possible to}} identify the origin of the strain causing the outbreak in Haiti." ...|$|E

2500|$|Critics have {{described}} dril's voice as an amalgamation of ordinary Internet users, {{most of all}} those who are arrogant, ignorant, or hapless. According to The A.V. Clubs Clayton Purdom, dril is a sort of patron saint of Internet users, or [...] "your uncle's search history come to life and filtered through a scabrous comic sensibility, and ... possibly the most popular, beloved man on the entire internet (after, maybe, The Rock)." [...] Will Shaw of The Oxford Student noted the familiarity of dril's [...] "naive appeals to moderation" [...] and [...] "flame war posturing," [...] and said dril [...] "is the internet's collective id, given form. He's the internet equivalent of the Beowulf-poet; we <b>may</b> <b>never</b> <b>know</b> who he really is, but we recognise when he is being channelled." [...] Christine Erickson at Mashable said dril's character was like [...] "a spambot equivalent to the kind of crazy that Clint Eastwood portrays." [...] At Kotaku, Gita Jackson called dril a [...] "joke account that also inadvertently catalogues ... every way to be mad online." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{employment}} of the disenfranchised female as visual icon within {{the art world}} {{is a fact that}} feminist critics have diagnosed, as the avant-garde's testing of cultural limits, where the female body, as symptomatic of a visual regime where [...] "Woman" [...] serves as [...] "the very ground of representation, both object and support of a desire which, intimately bound up with power and creativity, is the moving force of culture and history." [...] The ability of male artists to form new expressive modes of representation filled with dynamic power is not a new concept within art history; Duncan in particular emphasizes and exposes the relationship between art historians and the avant-garde painters of the post modern era in that art historians emphasize the notion: âthat avant-garde art consists of so many movements of individual artistic freedom, a freedom evidenced in the artistâs capacity for innovationâ and in this freedom both artist and historian are freed to analyze and construct work in a larger structure without recognizing the social constraints and responsibilities of the past and their impact on contemporary society. Duncan questions where does this innovation arise? Is it completely unmotivated? A gift from God? We <b>may</b> <b>never</b> <b>know.</b> Picasso in discussing the work was often resistant to acknowledge any guidance in context; favouring instead to address it in a way which ranged from vague, humorous and sarcastic. For example, when âspeaking to Kahnweiler in December 1933, Picasso recalled the jokes he and his friends bandied about the women in the Demoiselles painting, identifying one of them as Picasso's girlfriend, Fernande, another as Marie Laurencin, a third as the grandmother of his poet friend Max Jacob-"all in a brothel in Avignon!â ...|$|E
