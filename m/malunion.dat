30|$|<b>Malunions</b> of {{fractures}} in {{children have a}} natural tendency to remodel. However, quantitative data of this well-known process are scarce.

30|$|This {{study has}} several limitations. Due to the {{retrospective}} {{nature of this}} study, there was no predefined protocol for selecting patients. The decision to perform a computer-assisted 3 D planned corrective osteotomy {{was made by the}} surgeon. Only patients with complex <b>malunions</b> were selected for this type of treatment. This approach has resulted in a selection bias and potentially limits the generalisability of our results. Due to the retrospective nature of this study, {{we were not able to}} acquire preoperative grip strength or functional questionnaires (e.g. DASH, PRWE), thus limiting the evaluation of functional outcome of the procedure. Another limitation is the heterogeneity of the population. We included subjects with both diaphyseal and extra-articular distal radius <b>malunions.</b> Distal <b>malunions</b> commonly show axial malalignment in pronation [25], whereas diaphyseal <b>malunions</b> typically involve angular deformation [23]. Individual cases require different goals of correction. As mentioned, an oblique single-cut rotation osteotomy (OSCRO) aims to correct rotational deformities and is limited in providing ulnoradial or volodorsal shifts. This phenomenon—in combination with the low number of cases—may explain the lack of statistically significant improvement in individual directional parameters.|$|R

Background: Diaphyseal non-unions and <b>malunions</b> constitute significant morbidities in fracture care. Fracture treat-ment modalities seek to restore anatomic orientation and functional rehabilitation {{as soon as possible}} after a fracture incident. <b>Malunions</b> and non unions present a treatment challenge with the need for prolonged hospitalization, multiple surgical interventions and economic burden. In the developing world, traditional bonesetting practices are popular and these often result in a host of preventable complications. The added socioeconomic costs of treating these complications present a considerable strain on the resources of these already fragile economies and households. Aim: To document the risk factors, treatment options and outcomes for diaphyseal non-unions and <b>malunions</b> in our environment. Patients and Methods: Fifty-two consecutive patients comprising 37 non-unions and 15 <b>malunions</b> who presented in the ortho-paedic unit of a tertiary hospital in Southern Nigeria were evaluated. Information sought included biodata, location of pathology, type of incident fracture, local risk factors including traditional bonesetting; treatment options and final out-comes. Information obtained was analyzed using SPSS version 20 (IBM, New York). Results are presented in simple frequency tables.

50|$|An X-ray is {{essential}} for the proper diagnosis of a <b>malunion.</b> The doctor will look into the patient’s history and the treatment process for the bone fracture. Oftentimes a CT scan and probably a MRI are also used in diagnosis. MRI are used to check of cartilage and ligament issues that developed due to the <b>malunion</b> and misalignment. CT scans are used to locate normal or abnormal structures within the body and to help during procedures to guide the placement of instruments and/or treatments.|$|E

30|$|In conclusion, the {{remodeling}} {{process of}} distal radius <b>malunions</b> in {{children can be}} described as an exponential function, with its starting speed dependent on the initial angulation. The current modified model proves to be more accurate than the model derived from the findings of Friberg. In addition, a formula for the prediction of remodeling time, based on the modified model, was described. These models add to our insight of the remodeling process and allow for more evidence-based patient information and optimal planning of eventual surgical intervention. Furthermore, the postulated model could serve as a basis for the description of the correction of other <b>malunions</b> by adaptation of the coefficients in this model.|$|R

40|$|Long-bone {{fractures}} {{are common}} {{in the field of}} orthopedic trauma and require careful treatment to avoid refractory disabil-ities. Through advancements of modern medicine and technolo-gy, many excellent techniques and devices are continually being invented. Currently, the success rates of treatment have markedly increased while complication rates have been greatly lowered. Even so, complications of failed fracture treatment still occasionally occur. Among these complications, <b>malunions</b> and nonunions are relatively common and disturbing. However, both complications can be reduced if the principles of fracture treatment are strictly followed. All fractures may be treated with nonoperative or operative methods according to individual advantages and disadvantages. In principle, nonoperative meth-ods should be given priority.

50|$|A <b>malunion</b> {{is when a}} {{fractured}} bone doesn’t heal properly. Some ways that it shows is by having the bone being twisted, shorter, or bent.

30|$|We used {{data from}} two {{published}} cohorts {{of children with}} distal radius fractures with dorsovolar angulation. Cohort A is from {{a study on the}} remodeling of <b>malunions</b> of forearm fractures which presents a table with patient data on 36 children [4]. From this table, were selected the <b>malunions</b> in the distal third of the forearm in dorsovolar dislocation (n =  31). Cohort B was derived from a study on the remodeling speed of distal radius fractures with dorsovolar angulation more than 15 ° (n =  32) [7]. Angle measurements in both cohorts were identical: the central longitudinal intramedullary axis was determined in both the proximal and (angulated) distal fragment. The angle between these two axes was used as the angulation angle. This method was described by Hansen et al. [8].|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{analyze the}} {{feasibility}} of combining computer-assisted 3 -dimensional planning with patient-specific drill guides and to evaluate this technology's surgical outcomes for distal radius intra-articular <b>malunions.</b> METHODS: Six symptomatic patients with intra-articular <b>malunions</b> of the distal radius with a stepoff of more than 2 mm were treated with an outside-in corrective osteotomy. The described cases consist of 2 malunited volar Barton fractures, 2 radial styloid fractures, 1 AO-type C 1 fracture, and 1 die-punch fracture. The osteotomies were guided by 3 -dimensionally generated aiming guides that allowed precise cutting and the reduction of up to 2 fragments. All 6 patients were examined clinically and radiologically after 1 year. The surgical outcomes were quantitatively analyzed by comparing the preoperative and postoperative computed tomographic data. RESULTS: In all 6 cases, the osteotomies were consolidated 8 weeks postoperatively. After 1 year, 4 patients were pain-free, 1 had mild pain, and 1 experienced moderate pain during heavy work. Wrist motion and grip strength were improved in all patients. The postoperative radiographs showed no articular stepoff or degenerative changes. CONCLUSIONS: Patient-specific aiming guides provided a reliable method to correct intra-articular <b>malunions</b> of the distal radius. This technique allows the surgeon to safely perform difficult intra-articular osteotomies and may help limit the need for salvage procedures such as partial or complete wrist arthrodesis...|$|R
50|$|Once {{diagnosed}} {{and located}} surgery {{is the most}} common treatment for a <b>malunion.</b> The surgery consists for the surgeon re-breaking the bone and realigning it to the anatomically correct position. There are different types and levels of extremity where {{it is possible that the}} bone will trimmed to allow full orientation at the fractured spot. Most often, either screws, plates or pins are used secure the new alignment. It is possible that a bone graft could be used to help with healing.|$|E
50|$|In most cases, {{patients}} are discharged from an emergency department with pain medicine and a cast or sling. These fractures are typically minor and heal naturally {{over the course}} of a few weeks. Fractures of the proximal region, especially among elderly patients, may limit future shoulder activity. Severe fractures are usually resolved with surgical intervention, followed by a period of healing using a cast or sling. Severe fractures often cause long-term loss of physical ability. Complications in the recovery process of severe fractures include osteonecrosis, <b>malunion</b> or nonunion of the fracture, stiffness, and rotator cuff dysfunction, which require additional intervention in order for the patient to fully recover.|$|E
5000|$|Treatment {{involves}} {{pain medication}} and immobilization at first; later, physical therapy is used. Ice over {{the affected area}} may increase comfort. Movement exercises are begun within {{at least a week}} of the injury; with these, fractures with little or no displacement heal without problems. Over 90% of scapular fractures are not significantly displaced; therefore, most of these fractures are best managed without surgery. [...] Fractures of the scapular body with displacement may heal with <b>malunion,</b> but even this may not interfere with movement of the affected shoulder. [...] However, displaced fractures in the scapular processes or in the glenoid do interfere with movement in the affected shoulder if they are not realigned properly. [...] Therefore, while most scapular fractures are managed without surgery, surgical reduction is required for fractures in the neck or glenoid; otherwise motion of the shoulder may be impaired.|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{treatment}} of complex diaphyseal <b>malunions</b> is challenging, requiring extensive preoperative plan-ning and precise operative technique. We {{have developed a}} simpler method to treat some of these deformities. Methods: Ten patients with complex diaphyseal <b>malunions</b> (including four femoral and six tibial <b>malunions)</b> underwent a clamshell osteotomy. The indications for surgery included pain at adjacent joints and deformity. After surgical exposure, the malunited segment was transected perpendicular to the normal diaphysis proximally and distally. The transected segment was again osteotomized along its long axis and was wedged open, similar to opening a clamshell. The proximal and distal segments of the diaphysis were then aligned with use of an intramedullary rod as an anatomic axis template and with use of the contralateral extremity as a length and rotation template. The patients were assessed clinically and radiographically at a mean of thirty-one months (range, six to fifty-two months) after the osteotomy. Results: Complete angular correction was achieved in each case; the amount of correction ranged from 2 to 20 in the coronal plane, from 0 to 32 in the sagittal plane, and from 0 to 25 in the axial plane (rotation). Correction of length ranged from 0 to 5 cm, and limb length was restored to within 2 cm in all patients. All osteotomy sites were healed clinically by six months. While no deep infections occurred, superficial wound dehiscence occurred in two patients along the approach for the longitudinal portion of the osteotomy, emphasizing the importance of careful soft-tissue handling and patient selection...|$|R
