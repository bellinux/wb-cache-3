30|$|The {{values of}} pH and {{electrical}} conductivity (EC) were {{measured in the}} field, using their portable meters (Systronics make). The EC was {{used to calculate the}} total dissolved solids (TDS), following the procedure suggested by Hem (1991). Total hardness (TH) as CaCO 3 and calcium (Ca 2 +) were estimated by volumetric titrations, using standard EDTA. Bicarbonate (HCO 3 −) and chloride (Cl−) were analysed volumetrically, using standard HCl and AgNO 3, respectively. Magnesium (Mg 2 +) was computed, taking the difference between TH and Ca 2 +. Sodium (Na+) and potassium (K+) were analysed using flame photometer. Sulphate (SO 4 2 −), nitrate (NO 3 −) and fluoride (F−), using turbidimetric, colorimetric and ion-selective electrode methods, respectively. All chemical variables (except pH) are expressed in milligrams per litre (mg/L) and also in <b>milliequivalents</b> <b>per</b> <b>litre</b> (me/L).|$|E
50|$|In practice, {{the amount}} of a {{substance}} in equivalents often has a very small magnitude, so, especially in medicine, it is routinely {{described in terms of}} milliequivalents (meq or mEq, despite the correct symbol would be mequiv), the prefix milli denoting that the measure has been multiplied by 1000. Very often, the measure is used in terms of <b>milliequivalents</b> of solute <b>per</b> <b>litre</b> of solvent (or milliNormal, where meq/L = mN). This is especially common for measurement of compounds in biological fluids; for instance, the healthy level of potassium in the blood of a human is defined between 3.5 and 5.0 meq/L.|$|R

40|$|This is the Limnological {{survey of}} the Cheshire, Shropshire, and Staffordshire Meres: Interim data report {{produced}} by the University of Liverpool in 1992. This report looks at the Limnological survey data from Cheshire, Shropshire and Staffordshire Meres. Limnological data of the report covers: changes in water conductivity, Phenolphthalein Alkalinity, Total Alkalinity, pH, Chloride concentrations, Soluble reactive Phosphorus, Total Phosphorus, Nitrate Nitrogen, Ammonium Nitrogen, Silicate, Chlorophyll, Carotenoids, Secci disk depth, changes in Trophic Score, changes in DAFOR scores for submerged and floating plants and Oxygen saturation during summer.
