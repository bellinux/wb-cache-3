40|$|Abstract—The {{expression}} of dystrophin, the dystrophin-associated proteins and utrophin {{has been studied}} immunocytochemically in three young, <b>manifesting</b> carriers of Duchenne muscular dystrophy, aged 3, 5 and 12 yrs, one adult <b>manifesting</b> carrier, aged 60 yrs, and one presumptive carrier with a raised serum creatine kinase, aged 24 yrs, {{the mother of the}} 5 -yr-old <b>manifesting</b> carrier. The <b>manifesting</b> carriers had variable degrees of weakness; the presumptive carrier had no weakness. Morphological abnormalities were also variable and were most marked in the young <b>manifesting</b> carriers. The three young <b>manifesting</b> carriers and the presumptive carrier had a mosaic pattern of dystrophin-positive and dystrophin-negative fibres. All the dystrophin-associated proteins were reduced in the dystrophin-deficient fibres, giving a similar mosaic pattern to dystrophin. Expression of dystrophin and the dystrophin-associated proteins was normal in the adult <b>manifesting</b> carrier. Utrophin was detected on the sarcolemma of fibres both with and without dystrophin and the dystrophin-associated proteins. Thus, dystrophin and utrophin are co-expressed in several fibres in carriers. The results emphasize the close association between dystrophin and the glycoprotein complex and their role in the pathogenesis of muscle damage. In addition, the presence of utrophin in fibres with greatly reduced glycoprotein...|$|R

5|$|According to Jains, the {{consequences}} of karma are inevitable. The consequences may {{take some time to}} take effect but the karma is never fruitless. The latent karma becomes active and bears fruit when the supportive conditions arise. A great part of attracted karma bears its consequences with minor fleeting effects, as generally most of our activities are influenced by mild negative emotions. However, those actions that are influenced by intense negative emotions cause an equally strong karmic attachment which usually does not bear fruit immediately. It takes on an inactive state and waits for the supportive conditions—like proper time, place, and environment—to arise for it to <b>manifest</b> and produce effects. If the supportive conditions do not arise, the respective karmas will <b>manifest</b> at the end of maximum period for which it can remain bound to the soul. These supportive conditions for activation of latent karmas are determined by the nature of karmas, intensity of emotional engagement at the time of binding karmas and our actual relation to time, place, surroundings. There are certain laws of precedence among the karmas, according to which the fruition of some of the karmas may be deferred but not absolutely barred.|$|E

Non-divine beings also undergo sex-changes through the actions of the gods, as the result of curses or blessings, or as the natural outcome of reincarnation.|$|E

50|$|Dualistic Petri nets {{are capable}} of {{modeling}} any process system at its <b>manifested</b> level. When reverse engineering a <b>manifested</b> process, dPNs have a one-to-one correspondence of dPN construct to any <b>manifested</b> process piece, that is, it is isomorphic to the implementation language of the <b>manifested</b> process. For example, several lines of software code could be represented by one dPN transformation construct. Once the <b>manifested</b> process is completely represented by a network of dPNs, small, well-coupled groups of dPN constructs can be lumped together to form higher level dPN constructs - creating a network of dPNs {{at a higher level}} of hierarchical abstraction. Each level of abstraction is consistent with its adjacent levels of abstraction and the rules governing them at each level are the exactly the same because PN abstractions are homomorphic. Now the process design can be considered at various levels of abstraction as deemed appropriate by the process architect, allowing for studies in its dynamic behavior and performance.|$|R
