Before the holes can be plated through, this smear must be removed by a chemical de-smear process, or by plasma-etch. The de-smear process ensures that a good connection is made to the copper layers when the hole is plated through. On high reliability boards a process called etch-back is performed chemically with a potassium permanganate based etchant or plasma.

With this technique, a new variant of filament formation in glass/epoxy composites: vertical filament formation (VFF) was identified. The conductive filaments found at the failure sites were observed during cross-sectioning techniques, verifying that the failures were due to CFF. A test standard to identify and quantify hollow glass fibers, potential paths for filament formation in laminated PWBs, was created. It was observed that board types, which show the longest time to failure due to CFF in PTH-PTH configuration, might not offer the best protection for PTH-plane geometry. Based on insulation resistance measurements, it was seen that the IPC-TM- 650 test specification of monitoring every 24 hours could allow intermittent failures to go undetected. It was demonstrated that PTH-PTH dielectric breakdown voltage values followed the same trend as the time to failure observed for the PTH-PTH CFF failure data, suggesting that dielectric breakdown voltage can be an indicator of CFF susceptibility, saving considerable time and cost...|$|R
