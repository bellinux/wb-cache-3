50|$|Early trials {{showed a}} {{statistical}} trend towards an improved survival rate amongst vaccinated test subjects. A direct {{correlation between the}} level of antibodies that a vaccinated patient raises against EGF and survival has been observed in several trials, {{and in one of}} the largest trials there was also an age-dependence, with only subjects under the age of 60 benefiting in terms of survival. More antibodies are raised when the vaccine is formulated with <b>Montanide</b> ISA 51 rather than aluminum hydroxide as an adjuvant, and when patients receive a low dose of cyclophosphamide three days before vaccine administration. Cyclophosphamide is thought to temporarily block the body's natural immune tolerance to EGF, thereby increasing antibody titers.|$|E
50|$|CimaVax is {{an active}} vaccine with which {{patients}} are immunized with epidermal growth factor (EGF), thus raising antibodies targeting EGF itself. The product is also formulated with the Neisseria meningitidis outer protein P64k and <b>Montanide</b> ISA 51 as adjuvants to potentiate the immune response. The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is hijacked by many types of cancer, including cancers of the lung, colon, kidney, and head and neck. By raising antibodies against EGF, which is EGFR's major ligand, the concentrations of EGF in the blood are reduced. Thus CimaVax does not target the cancer cells directly, but is expected to work against these cancers by denying the cancers the growth stimulus they require. For this reason, the Roswell Park group thinks that it may prove most useful as a preventive vaccine {{rather than as a}} cancer therapy per se.|$|E
40|$|Adjuvants {{are crucial}} {{components}} of vaccines. They significantly improve vaccine efficacy by modulating, enhancing, or extending the immune response {{and at the}} same time reducing the amount of antigen needed. In contrast to previously licensed adjuvants, current successful adjuvant formulations often consist of several molecules, that when combined, act synergistically by activating a variety of immune mechanisms. These “combination adjuvants” are already registered with several vaccines, both in humans and animals, and novel combination adjuvants are in the pipeline. With improved knowledge of the type of immune responses needed to successfully induce disease protection by vaccination, combination adjuvants are particularly suited to not only enhance, but also direct the immune responses desired to be either Th 1 -, Th 2 - or Th 17 -biased. Indeed, in view of the variety of disease and population targets for vaccine development, a panel of adjuvants will be needed to address different disease targets and populations. Here, we will review well-known and new combination adjuvants already licensed or currently in development—including ISCOMs, liposomes, Adjuvant Systems <b>Montanides,</b> and triple adjuvant combinations—and summarize their performance in preclinical and clinical trials. Several of these combination adjuvants are promising having promoted improved and balanced immune responses...|$|R

To increase the effectiveness of the candidate vaccine, adjuvants such as <b>Montanide</b> Gel 01 or chitosan were included in its composition. Immunization of cattle (heifers aged 1 – 1. 5 years, 5 animals per group) with the viral constructs vaccine formulation only, or its combination with adjuvants <b>Montanide</b> Gel 01 or chitosan, was conducted via the conjunctival method using cross prime (influenza virus subtype H 5 N 1) and booster (influenza virus subtype H 1 N 1) vaccination schedules at an interval of 28 days. Vaccine candidates were evaluated in comparison with the positive (B. abortus S 19) and negative (PBS) controls. The viral constructs vaccine formulations, particularly in combination with <b>Montanide</b> Gel 01 adjuvant promoted formation of IgG antibodies (with a predominance of antibodies of isotype IgG 2 a) against Brucella L 7 /L 12 and Omp 16 proteins in ELISA. Moreover, these vaccines in cattle induced a strong antigen-specific T-cell immune response, as indicated by a high number of CD 4 + and CD 8 + cells, as well as the concentration of IFN-γ, and most importantly provided a high level of protectiveness comparable to the commercial B. abortus S 19 vaccine and superior to the B. abortus S 19 vaccine in combination with <b>Montanide</b> Gel 01 adjuvant.

40|$|Aim: To {{detect the}} proper time for {{vaccination}} of infected calves after the onset of clinical signs and revaccination for previously vaccinated animals with bivalent FMD <b>montanide</b> ISA 206 inactivated vaccine. Materials and Methods: Twenty calves naturally infected with {{foot and mouth disease}} (FMD) showing clinical signs represented by lesions on the tongue, buccal mucosa and feet. Samples were collected from these calves including tongue epithelial and oropharyngeal fluid (OP). The causative virus was isolated from such samples through inoculation of baby mice and typed by indirect Sandwich ELISA and was confirmed in 2 tongue epithelia samples using PCR. Results: The serum antibody titers were determined using SNT and ELISA in the sera of the 20 infected calves revealing that the infected farms should be vaccinated with inactivated bivalent FMD vaccine for (type O and A) Adjuvanted with <b>montanide</b> ISA 206 after 32 weeks from the appearance of clinical signs.

Herein we compare different adjuvant and carrier systems in a murine model for induction of interferon gamma (IFN-γ) producing CD 8 T cells to the minimal immuno-dominant peptide epitope from the circumsporozoite protein (CSP) of Plasmodium berghei, pb 9 (SYIPSAEKI, referred to as KI). Two pro-inflammatory adjuvants, <b>Montanide</b> and Poly I:C, and a non-classical, non-inflammatory nanoparticle based carrier (polystyrene nanoparticles, PSNPs), were compared side-by-side {{for their ability to}} induce potentially protective CD 8 T cell responses after two immunisations. KI in <b>Montanide</b> (<b>Montanide</b> + KI) or covalently conjugated to PSNPs (PSNPs-KI) induced such high responses, whereas adjuvanting with Poly I:C or PSNPs without conjugation was ineffective. This result was consistent with an observed induction of an immunosuppressed environment by Poly I:C in the draining lymph node (dLN) 48 hours post injection, which was reflected by increased frequencies of myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSC) and a proportion of inflammation reactive regulatory T cells (Treg) expressing the tumour necrosis factor receptor 2 (TNFR 2), as well as decreased dendritic cell (DC) maturation. The other inflammatory adjuvant, <b>Montanide,</b> also promoted proportional increases in the TNFR 2 + Treg subpopulation, but not MDSCs, in the dLN. By contrast, injection with non-inflammatory PSNPs did not cause these changes.

All adverse events resolved. There were no vaccine-related serious adverse events. Humoral responses were highest in the AS 02 groups. Antibodies showed activity in an in vitro growth inhibition assay up to 80 %. Upon stimulation with the vaccine, peripheral mononuclear cells from all groups proliferated and secreted IFNgamma and IL- 5 cytokines. All formulations showed distinct reactogenicity profiles. All formulations with PfAMA 1 were immunogenic and induced functional antibodies. (Clinicaltrials. gov) NCT 00730782...|$|E
40|$|The Toll-like {{receptor}} (TLR) 7 / 8 agonist resiquimod {{has been}} used as an immune adjuvant in cancer vaccines. We evaluated the safety and immunogenicity of the cancer testis antigen NY-ESO- 1 given in combination with <b>Montanide</b> (Seppic) with or without resiquimod in patients with high-risk melanoma. In part I of the study, patients received 100 mg of full-length NY-ESO- 1 protein emulsified in 1. 25 mL of <b>Montanide</b> (day 1) followed by topical application of 1, 000 mg of 0. 2 % resiquimod gel on days 1 and 3 (cohort 1) versus days 1, 3, and 5 (cohort 2) of a 21 -day cycle. In part II, patients were randomized to receive 100 -mg NY-ESO- 1 protein plusMontanide (day 1) followed by topical application of placebo gel [(arm A; n 8) or 1, 000 mg of 0. 2 % resiquimod gel (armB;n 12) ] using thedosing regimen established in part I. The vaccine regimens were generally well tolerated. NY-ESO- 1 –specific humoral responses were induced or boosted in all patients, many of whom had high titer antibodies. In part II, 16 of 20 patients in both arms hadNY-ESO- 1 –specific CD 4 þ T-cell responses. CD 8 þ T-cell responses were only seen in 3 of 12 patients in arm B. Patients with TLR 7 SNP rs 179008 had a greater likelihood of developing NY-ESO- 1 –specific CD 8 þ responses. In conclusion, NY-ESO- 1 protein in combination with <b>Montanide</b> with or without topical resiquimod is safe and induces both antibody and CD 4 þ T-cell responses in themajorityofpatients; the small proportionofCD 8 þ T-cell responses suggests that the addition of topical resiquimod to <b>Montanide</b> isnot sufficient to induceconsistentNY-ESO- 1 –specific CD 8 þ T-cell responses.

40|$|EGFR (HER 1) {{highlights}} {{as one of}} {{the most}} relevant tumor associated antigen in epithelial malignant cells. Monoclonal antibodies and tyrosine kinase inhibitors against EGFR remain as the most advanced approaches in clinical trials. More recently, an active immunotherapy using the HER 1 extracellular domain (ECD) adjuvated in very small size proteoliposomes (VSSP) and emulsified in <b>Montanide</b> ISA- 51 demonstrated its strength to inhibit tumor cell line proliferation by arresting cells in G(0) /G(1) stage and induction of apoptosis. In this study, we present a simpler HER 1 -ECD-based formulation, which is lacking the oily component <b>Montanide</b> ISA- 51. Generated antibodies following non-emulsive formulation immunization recognized membrane EGFR; avoid EGF and TGFalpha coupling to EGFR leading to a marked abrogation of EGFR phosphorylation levels. Non-emulsive formulation also arrests cell cycle in G(0) /G(1) stage, demonstrating it preserves previous formulation quality in a newer and simpler formulation. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Increasing {{the breadth}} of the {{functional}} antibody response through immunization with Plasmodium falciparum apical membrane antigen 1 (Pf AMA 1) multi-allele vaccine formulations has been demonstrated in several rodent and rabbit studies. This study assesses the safety and immunogenicity of three Pf AMA 1 Diversity-Covering (DiCo) vaccine candidates formulated as an equimolar mixture (DiCo mix) in CoVaccine HT™ or <b>Montanide</b> ISA 51, {{as well as that of}} a Pf AMA 1 -MSP 1 19 fusion protein formulated in <b>Montanide</b> ISA 51. Methods Vaccine safety in rhesus macaques was monitored by animal behaviour observation and assessment of organ and systemic functions through clinical chemistry and haematology measurements. The immunogenicity of vaccine formulations was assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays and in vitro parasite growth inhibition assays with three culture-adapted P. falciparum strains. Results These data show that both adjuvants were well tolerated with only transient changes in a few of the chemical and haematological parameters measured. DiCo mix formulated in CoVaccine HT™ proved immunologically and functionally superior to the same candidate formulated in <b>Montanide</b> ISA 51. Immunological data from the fusion protein candidate was however difficult to interpret as four out of six immunized animals were non-responsive for unknown reasons. Conclusions The study highlights the safety and immunological benefits of DiCo mix as a potential human vaccine against blood stage malaria, especially when formulated in CoVaccine HT™, and adds to the accumulating data on the specificity broadening effects of DiCo mix. </p...|$|E
40|$|We {{evaluated}} {{the side effects}} induced by injection of Freund's adjuvant (FA) and alternative adjuvants combined with different antigens. Rabbits and mice were injected subcutaneously, intramuscularly (rabbits) and intraperitoneally (mice) with different adjuvants (FA, Specol, RIBI, TiterMax, <b>Montanide</b> ISA 50) in combination with several types of antigens (synthetic peptides, autoantigen, glycolipid, protein, mycoplasma or viruses). The effects of treatment on the animals' well-being were assessed by clinical and behavioural changes (POT and LABORAS assays) and gross and histopathological changes. In rabbits, treatment {{did not appear to}} induce acute or prolonged pain and distress. Mice showed behavioural changes immediately after (predominantly secondary) immunization. Injection of several adjuvant/antigen mixtures resulted in severe pathological changes, depending on adjuvant, type of antigen, animal species used and route of injection. Both rabbits and mice showed pathological changes ranging from marked to severe after injection of FA, and ranging from minimal to marked after Specol and <b>Montanide</b> injections. Pathological changes after RIBI injections were severe in rabbits, though slight in mice. After TiterMax injections pathological changes were moderate in rabbits, though severe in mice. In conclusion, injection of FA according to present guidelines resulted mostly in severe pathological changes, whereas only very few clinical and behavioural signs indicated prolonged severe pain. Our findings indicate that <b>Montanide</b> ISA 50 and Specol induce acceptable antibody titres, and cause fewer pathological changes than FA. Thus they are effective alternatives to FA...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Macaca mulatta monkeys were immunized {{with the}} {{candidate}} transmission-blocking vaccine against Plas-modium vivax, Pvs 25, combined with alum or <b>Montanide</b> ISA 720. Efficacy {{was measured by}} combining post-immunization sera with gametocytes obtained from infections induced in chimpanzees using membrane-feeding tech-niques. The results indicate that immunization of M. mulatta monkeys with Pvs 25 and <b>Montanide</b> ISA 720 was more effective than with alum in efficacy and resulted in {{the maintenance of a}} lasting transmission-blocking immunity to P. vivax. This was evident two weeks after the second immunization, and more strongly demonstrable 62 and 152 days after the second immunization. This transmission-blocking activity was strongly reinforced by a third immunization given 181 days after the primary immunization, as measured three weeks later by indirect membrane feeding. The use of game-tocytes of P. vivax derived from infections induced in chimpanzees can contribute to the selection of appropriate constructs, formulations, and immunization regimens for the development of effective transmission-blocking vaccines...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Aotus monkeys {{were used}} to {{determine}} the immunogenicity of Pvs 25 protein expressed in the zygote/ ookinete surface. Animals were immunized in three times with 100 g of Pvs 25 formulated in <b>Montanide</b> ISA- 720. Antibodies to Pvs 25 detected by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay appeared by day 30 after the first immuniza-tion, with a peak of antibodies levels on day 150. These antibodies were still detectable on day 300. Plasma samples on day 150 from experimental group were able to completely block the development of the parasite in Anopheles albimanus mosquitoes artificially fed with human isolates of Plasmodium vivax. Immunized Aotus monkeys were infected with blood forms of the P. vivax Salvador I strain and no boosting effect of blood infection on titers of antibodies to Pvs 25 was observed despite the presence of infective gametocytes. In conclusion, Pvs 25 protein formulated in <b>Montanide</b> ISA- 720 induces efficient and long-lasting transmission-blocking antibodies that cannot be boosted by parasite infection...|$|E
40|$|Following {{spinal cord}} injury (SCI), the {{pathological}} sequelae which ensue through the secondary mechanisms of degeneration produce myelin deposits which are potent inhibitors of endogenous neuroregeneration. We have enhanced the immune-mediated response following a hemisection lesion by immunizing adult C 57 B 1 / 6 female mice against the inhibitor of neurite outgrowth Nogo-A(623 - 640) peptide. Moderate anti-Nogo-A(623 - 640) antibody titre levels were obtained by using <b>Montanide</b> as the adjuvant. However, this antibody response was not obtained using incomplete Freund&# 039;s adjuvant (IFA). Significant benefit in locomotor performance was demonstrated only in animals which were vaccinated with IFA and not with <b>Montanide.</b> No further benefit could be demonstrated with the Nogo-A(623 - 640) peptide beyond that seen for adjuvant alone. These data imply that generating antibodies against Nogo-A(623 - 640) in vivo alone {{is not sufficient to}} enhance locomotor recovery and that subcutaneous injection of IFA prior to SCI can enhance locomotor performance...|$|E
40|$|The C-terminal conserved {{region of}} Plasmodium falciparum {{merozoite}} surface protein 3 (MSP 3) is the trigger antigen of a protective immune response mediated by cytophilic antibodies. In an open, randomized, two-adjuvant (<b>Montanide</b> ISA 720, aluminum hydroxide) phase I clinical trial we evaluated the safety and immunogenicity of increasing doses of a long synthetic peptide construct spanning the conserved region of MSP 3 targeted by biologically active antibodies (MSP 3 -LSP). Thirty-five healthy volunteers were randomized to receive three subcutaneous injections on days 0, 30, and 120. Of the 100 injections given, 10 caused severe local reactions, 62 caused transient mild to moderate local reactions, and 28 caused no reaction. On the basis of preestablished exclusion criteria, use of the <b>Montanide</b> formulation led to withdrawal of five volunteers after the second injection. This led {{to a reduction in}} the subsequent vaccine doses in four of the groups. No vaccine-related serious adverse events occurred throughout the trial. After the third injection, volunteers displayed a marked specific anti-MSP 3 -LSP antibody response (23 / 30 individuals, compared with 29 / 34 individuals for plasma from an area where malaria is endemic), an anti-native MSP 3 antibody response (19 / 30 individuals), a T-cell-antigen-specific proliferative response (26 / 30 individuals), and gamma interferon production (25 / 30 individuals). In conclusion, the MSP 3 -LSP vaccine was immunogenic with both adjuvants, although it was unacceptably reactogenic when it was combined with <b>Montanide.</b> The potential usefulness of the candidate vaccine is supported by the induction of a strong cytophilic response (i. e., the type of anti-MSP 3 antibodies involved in antibody-dependent, monocyte-mediated protective mechanisms in areas where malaria is endemic) ...|$|E
40|$|In {{this thesis}} we {{describe}} our studies aimed at optimizing {{the efficacy of}} synthetic long peptide (SLP) vaccines via the encapsulation in Poly-(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) particles. Immunotherapy based on SLP-vaccines has resulted in strong tumor specific immune response and importantly, improved clinical benefit in patients with pre-malignant lesions. One important drawback associated with SLP-vaccines is their current form of administration in <b>Montanide,</b> a clinical grade water-in-oil emulsion. The aim of this Ph. D project was to device an alternative method of delivery which overcomes the drawbacks {{associated with the use}} of <b>Montanide.</b> For this purpose we explored the use of PLGA (nano) particles (NP) as a delivery vehicle for SLP. Several important aspects for vaccination were assessed in this thesis; from the pharmaceutical formulation to the immunological characterization of different PLGA-SLP preparations. Together, the data presented in this thesis show that PLGA-NP mediated delivery of SLP is a very efficient method to target, load and mature Dendritic cells (DCs) as immune stimulatory compounds can be co-encapsulated with the vaccine A...|$|E
