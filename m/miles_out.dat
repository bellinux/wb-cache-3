5|$|Hope {{was still}} {{in command of the}} Bellerophon three months later when he was heavily engaged in the van of Howe's fleet at the Glorious First of June, when an equally sized French fleet was {{defeated}} 200 <b>miles</b> <b>out</b> in the Atlantic Ocean. At the start of 1795, Hope joined HMS Tremendous, but within two months was requested onboard HMS Venerable by Admiral Duncan. However, while visiting aboard a Russian ship in 1796, Hope suffered a serious accidental head injury that left him an invalid for two years, consequently missing Duncan's victory at the Battle of Camperdown.|$|E
5|$|Manning's {{father took}} a job as an {{information}} technology (IT) manager for a rental car agency, which required travel. The family lived several <b>miles</b> <b>out</b> of town, and Manning's mother was unable to drive. She spent her days drinking, while Manning was left largely to fend for herself, playing with Legos or on the computer. Brian would stock up on food before his trips, and leave pre-signed checks that Casey mailed to pay the bills. A neighbor said that whenever Manning's elementary school went on field trips, she would give her own son extra food or money so he could make sure Manning had something to eat. Friends and neighbors considered the Mannings a troubled family.|$|E
5|$|At over 80, Mondragón {{was still}} able to mount on horseback, though he had to be helped by two men and could only wear light armour. He first came to {{prominence}} at the Battle of Mühlberg, in 1547, {{and was one of the}} few Spanish officers of good fame in the rebel provinces, being portrayed in a positive light by contemporaneous Dutch authors such as Hugo Grotius and Pieter Corneliszoon Hooft. Mondragón planned not only to relieve Groenlo, but also to lure Maurice into a pitched battle. The Dutch general, however, on receiving news of his enemy's march, set fire to supplies, tools and ammunitions gathered for the siege and retreated two <b>miles</b> <b>out</b> of Groenlo. Mondragón could therefore ressuply the town unmolested.|$|E

5|$|This {{conversation}} {{coincided with}} the Gotha Raids in which German heavy bombers attacked London. He attempted interceptions against the high-flying machines and on 13 June finally got to within range of one. He fired but it swerved and resumed course. He chased the formation 21 <b>miles</b> <b>out</b> to sea but could not get closer than 500 feet. On 7 July he succeeded in hitting the Gotha crewed by Leutnant Erwin Kollberg and Walter Aschoff (of bomber unit Bogohl 3). He damaged a second and narrowly avoided a collision with the machine as he flew by. On one raid a Gotha gunner's bullet struck his windshield. The raids continued and British aerial defences did not gain {{more than a handful}} of successes against the Gothas.|$|E

25|$|Then {{in early}} 1842 an {{intermittent}} (flashing) light replaced the fixed light, and a lightship was towed to a station of the Knobben, off Anholt.

25|$|Consequently, {{the very}} {{features}} that made Bermuda such a prized {{base for the}} Royal Navy (its headquarters in the North Atlantic and West Indies 'til after the Second World War, also meant it was perpetually threatened by US invasion, as the US {{would have liked to}} both deny the base to an enemy, {{and use it as a}} way to extend its defences hundreds of <b>miles</b> <b>out</b> to sea, which would not happen 'til the Second World War.|$|E
25|$|An {{incandescent}} vapour light, {{the first}} of its kind in Queensland, was purchased from Chance Brothers and installed in 1910 and by 1912 its 1400 candle power was visible at least 22 to 25 <b>miles</b> <b>out</b> to sea. Many mariners considered it the best light on the Queensland coast and the key to successfully traversing Moreton Bay. As a result, by 1920 all vessels entering and leaving the Port of Brisbane at night had to use the North West Channel.|$|E

25|$|Four of {{the seven}} crew members of the bomber managed to {{parachute}} to safety: additional pilot Major Messinger, aircraft commander Captain Charles F. Wendorf, copilot First Lieutenant Michael J. Rooney and radar-navigator Captain Ivens Buchanan. Buchanan received burns from the explosion {{and was unable to}} separate himself from his ejection seat, but he was nevertheless able to open his parachute, and he survived the impact with the ground. The other three surviving crew members landed safely several <b>miles</b> <b>out</b> to sea.|$|E
25|$|The Javelin entered {{service with}} the RAF in 1956 with 46 Squadron based at RAF Odiham, England. The Javelins were {{immediately}} {{put to use}} in an intensive flying programme, to rapidly familiarise crews with the type. The introduction of the Javelin was eased by {{the establishment of a}} partial Operational Conversion Unit, a specialised team to assist the members of other squadrons in converting to the type. During RAF trials, the type proved readily capable of intercepting jet bombers such as the English Electric Canberra and modern jet fighters, over a hundred <b>miles</b> <b>out</b> to sea.|$|E
25|$|After informing Carrie of his success, Brody {{goes with}} her to a safe house 100 <b>miles</b> <b>out</b> of Tehran. There, she tells him she is {{pregnant}} with his child. Saul assures her that Brody will be safely extracted, but his successor as CIA Director, Senator Andrew Lockhart (Tracy Letts), betrays their location to Javadi, who arranges their capture. Brody is convicted of treason and sentenced to death. Carrie tries desperately to secure his release, but to no avail. When she calls him in his cell, he asks her not {{to come to his}} execution. She goes anyway, however, and calls out his name as he is hanged in a public square.|$|E

25|$|At the time, {{accounts}} blamed strong currents. Later it {{was discovered}} that Apollo had taken on board an iron tank, but that no one had adjusted her compass for the influence of this large magnetic mass. Consequently, a small error in direction accumulated {{over the course of the}} five days; at the time Apollo struck Dixon thought she was forty or so <b>miles</b> <b>out</b> to sea. Because the convoy had endured bad weather since leaving Cork, no one had taken sightings that would have enabled them to correct their estimates of their position. Instead, they had relied on an approximately known speed and a biased heading for their estimate.|$|E
25|$|New York State Route32A (NY32A) is a {{state highway}} in the Hudson Valley region of New York in the United States. It serves as a {{connector}} between NY32 {{in the town of}} Saugerties and NY23A in the town of Catskill. The road allows traffic from the Saugerties area, particularly from the New York State Thruway, to directly reach the interior of the Greene County portion of Catskill Park. The majority of traffic is tourism-oriented, from hikers in summer to skiers bound for Hunter Mountain in winter. If NY32A did not exist, drivers would have to go several <b>miles</b> <b>out</b> of their way to the intersection of NY32 and NY23A.|$|E
25|$|McIntosh {{had planned}} to envelop Sigel's force from the {{northwest}} while Gates closed the trap on the south. However, McIntosh mistakenly took his 3,000-man cavalry brigade too far up a northerly road. After marching three <b>miles</b> <b>out</b> of his way, he turned his troopers onto the road leading east into the Little Sugar Creek valley. By {{the time they reached}} the site where Sigel's northeast road met McIntosh's east-bound road, the Federal general's men had already passed the intersection thus avoiding a disaster. When the 3rd Texas Cavalry charged, they ran smack into Sigel's main line. The Confederates lost 10 killed and about 20 wounded to Federal artillery and rifle fire and the Union position held.|$|E

25|$|Colonists, sent to {{the island}} in the mid-1930s to {{establish}} possession claims by the United States, built the Earhart Light , named after Amelia Earhart, as a day beacon or navigational landmark. It is shaped somewhat like a short lighthouse. It was constructed of white sandstone with painted black bands and a black top meant to be visible several <b>miles</b> <b>out</b> to sea during daylight hours. It is located near the boat landing at {{the middle of the}} west coast by the former site of Itascatown. The beacon was partially destroyed during early World War II by the Japanese attacks, but it was rebuilt in the early 1960s by men from the U.S. Coast Guard ship Blackhaw. By 2000, the beacon was reported to be crumbling and it had not been repainted in decades.|$|E
25|$|By 1592 Kempe {{was one of}} Lord Strange's Men, {{listed in}} the Privy Council {{authorisation}} for that troupe to play seven <b>miles</b> <b>out</b> of London. In 1594, upon the dissolution of Strange's Men, Kempe, along with Burbage and Shakespeare, joined the Lord Chamberlain's Men and remained with that company until early 1599, when a still-unclear sequence of events removed him from the company. Although {{he had been a}} sharer in the plans to construct the Globe Theatre, he appeared in no productions in the new theatre, which was open by mid-1599, and evidence from Shakespeare's Henry V, {{in which there is no}} promised continued role for Falstaff, and Hamlet, containing its famous complaint at improvisational clowning (Act 3, Scene 2), indicates some of the circumstances in which Kempe may have been dropped. Kemp played his last role for Shakespeare in 1598.|$|E

In {{the event of a}} major terrorist, hijacking or hostage incident, the ARW may be called to aid the Garda ERU, and in the past they have been put on standby to assist the Irish Prison Service during major prison riots. The ARW have also provided security at Ireland's maximum-security Portlaoise Prison. The Wing has on occasion been tasked for search and rescue (SAR) operations, as the ARW have trained Arctic survival specialists.|$|E
