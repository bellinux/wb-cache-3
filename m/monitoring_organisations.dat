In general, copyright holders canperformmonitoringusingtwoapproaches:indirect monitoring,where indirect clues of the sharing activity of a peer are considered (e. g., its presence in the peer list of a tracker), and direct monitoring, which establishes connectionswithpeerstoestimate theirparticipationinsharingactivity. Previous research has focused exclusively on indirect monitoring. We provide a broader characterisation of the monitoring of BitTorrent activity by considering both indirect and direct monitoring. In particular, we review previous work on indirect monitoring, provide features to detect peers engaged in such monitoring, and apply them to identify a number of <b>monitoring</b> <b>organisations.</b> Additionally, we introduce features that detect direct monitors, and provide the first ever measurements of direct monitoring, showing {{that it is now}} occurring...|$|E
40|$|Environmental {{monitoring}} {{is essential}} for assessing {{the current state of}} the environment, measuring impacts of environmental pressures and providing evidence to government. Recent UK government announcements have indicated an increased role for ‘Big Society’ in monitoring. In this paper, we review available literature concerning the use of citizen science for monitoring, present examples of successful volunteer monitoring work and highlight important issues surrounding the use of volunteers. We argue that in order to ensure that environmental monitoring continues to be effective it is important to learn from examples where volunteers are currently used, acknowledging constraints and identifying potential approaches which will help to maximise both their engagement and data quality. Effective partnerships between environmental <b>monitoring</b> <b>organisations</b> and volunteers may thus aid the UK in developing robust coordinated monitoring systems that will be less vulnerable to funding variances...|$|E

40|$|Despite {{increased}} {{academic and}} practitioner interest in codes of conduct, {{there has been}} little research into the actual compliance of suppliers in developing countries with the codes of conduct of multinational corporations (MNCs). This paper addresses this lack by analysing Chinese suppliers’ level of compliance with Swedish toy retailers’ codes of conduct. Based on unannounced and unofficial interviews with employees of Chinese suppliers, the study shows that all of the nine studied suppliers breached some of the standards in the toy retailers’ codes, with over two thirds of the suppliers not complying with the majority of the studied standards. While there are different explanations of this lack of compliance, the main explanation seems to be that Chinese suppliers successfully deceive toy retailers’ <b>monitoring</b> <b>organisations</b> by decoupling the formal monitored part of their organisation from the actual operational part of their organisation. The paper concludes with a discussion of how to increase compliance with MNCs’ codes of conduct...|$|E
30|$|Following these global traditions, {{voluntary}} {{guidelines for}} CSR {{have been issued}} by the SECP (SECP 2013). Javaid Lone et al. (2016) noted that that these guidelines are directed at business in Pakistan with the aim to better motivate them towards socially responsible conduct. Furthermore, the guidelines recommend that businesses have a CSR policy incorporated by their board, reflected {{in the form of}} their commitment to reporting CSR-related activities. The SECP is now playing a pivotal role in promoting a culture of socially responsible business (Ahmad et al. 2015) because the presence of independent <b>monitoring</b> <b>organisations</b> and state regulation are likely to stimulate CSR-related activities (Campbell 2007). For example, Ahmed Haji (2013) argued that the initiation of the Silver Book for Malaysian publicly owned companies resulted in a drastic increase in CSR disclosure in that jurisdiction. Similarly, Javaid Lone et al. (2016) observed that companies disclosed more CSR related activities in Pakistan following the introduction of CSR guidelines. But the extent of these disclosures appears to vary considerably across industrial sectors.|$|E
40|$|An {{increasing}} {{stream of}} monitoring activities {{has entered the}} public sector. In the Netherlands {{there are hundreds of}} monitors on a wide range, so it can be stated that monitoring is fashionable in the Netherlands. But monitoring seems to be functional, too. Without <b>monitoring,</b> <b>organisations</b> would not even survive. Research about the use of research information and evaluations makes clear that information is not always used in a direct and transparent way. This statement raises three, interrelated research questions, which we try to answer in our paper: (1) What is the amount and the character of (intragovernmental) monitors in the public sector in the Netherlands? (2) What forms of utilisation can be distilled and how are intragovernmental monitors used in practice? (3) How do these functions of monitors relate to recent insights in the complexity of governmental performance and the role information can play in complex systems? The paper concludes with the observation that the current mode of monitoring is dominated by rationalistic assumptions. Important functions from a complexity perspective, as learning and communicating, seem to be underestimated. Monitoring is fashionable, but it seems to be less functional...|$|E

40|$|This {{presentation}} will unpack some of {{the challenges}} found in both researching histories of the British extreme right, and communicating these findings to relevant audiences outside academia. It will start by reflecting on the benefits that can come from working with partners, such as watchdog and <b>monitoring</b> <b>organisations,</b> who have a vast knowledge base and datasets that many academics can use for their own research. As an example, will highlight {{the relationship between the}} University of Northampton and Searchlight magazine, which has resulted in a major new archive for researchers in this field. It will then explain what types of new research can be developed by historians from such resources, especially allowing for fresh commentaries on issues such as the groupuscular dynamics of the extreme right and its transnational activity – both themes that are becoming increasingly important for those analysing the recent history and current dynamics of the extreme right. Finally, it will discuss {{some of the}} challenges encountered with using these new histories to engage wider organisations, especially those linked to the Prevent Agenda such as the police and local authorities. With these issues in mind, it will close by exploring the role that historians of the extreme right can play by engaging with contemporary debates over tackling ‘radicalisation’ and promoting ‘British values’...|$|E
40|$|The Water Protection Act ('Wasserhaushaltsgesetz'-WHG), {{relating}} to process installations, defines {{a requirement that}} some specific activities may only be performed by 'qualified enterprises' ('Fachbetriebe'). These enterprises must have knowledge, personnel and equipment to use the technical methods to protect the water from hazardous substances. The regulations have been in force in their current form since 1986. This research was instigated due to the reportedly high frequency of audit Faults at process installations where these 'qualified enterprises' had been employed. A survey of the current opinion of involved parties (including authorities, operating companies and expert bodies) {{was carried out by}} means of questionnaires. General support for the concept of 'qualified enterprises' was confirmed from this. The WHG allows two implementation routes; using the Technical <b>Monitoring</b> <b>organisations</b> recognised in Water Protection legislation, or using the Goods- and Monitoring Associations acknowledged in construction regulations. On the other hand the analysis showed that the two types of organisation are generally equal in terms of effectiveness. However instances were found where significant differences can exist between the two types of organisations. The consensus of the participants clearly endorsed preservations of both forms of organisations because each demonstrates specific advantages. (orig.)

40|$|Inter-organisational {{relationships}} {{are at the}} heart of economic activity and the benefits of inter-organisational collaboration are widely reported. However, theoretical understanding of how inter-organisational {{relationships are}} coordinated and why they encounter coordination problems remains limited. I address these questions through a study of seven social housing projects in England, completed between 2008 and 2011. Drawing on the richness of data from over 3, 900 pages of minutes from meetings and project reports, I integrate social network analysis techniques (SNA) used to map dynamic inter-organisational relationships with content analysis, through which I explore coordination-related aspects. Surprisingly, coordination proved not to be (directly) related to administrative mechanisms. Instead, I show that coordination stems from the interplay between administrative mechanisms and the structure of the inter-organisational relationships, as shown by two theoretical mechanisms: organising and relating. The former captures the finding that the use of contracting fosters hierarchy, while the latter shows that <b>monitoring</b> <b>organisations</b> foster density of inter-organisational relationships. I discover that inter-organisational relationships are coordinated through the juggling of these mechanisms over time. Furthermore, my analysis demonstrates that coordination problems stem from: contractual bottlenecks and organisational expertise-driven homophily. Interestingly, this exposes a tension between mechanisms intended to aid coordination and the manifestation of coordination problems. Theorising on this tension, I am led to a framework of coordination voids – discontinuities in the fabric of inter-organisational relationships resulting from mechanisms intended to aid coordination, but in fact hampering coordination under certain conditions. I discuss a set of theoretical contributions to the strategic management and organisational and management theory, alongside a methodological contribution. I conclude my discussion of the contributions of this thesis by drawing practical implications for managers and policy-makers. I hope that my study will stimulate a research agenda on the coordination of inter-organisational relationships, preferably one that also engages with societal challenges...|$|E
