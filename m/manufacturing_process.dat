One of the major challenges faced by biological production processes is that many chemicals are toxic to microorganisms (at high concentration), killing microorganisms and therefore stopping the production processes.

In this paper, energy consumption of <b>manufacturing</b> <b>processes</b> is calculated. During the <b>manufacturing</b> <b>processes,</b> usually several stages are needed, which are rough machining, semi-finish machining and finish machining. After each stage is finished, the components are inspected and classified into three groups: (1) those below the specification, (2) those within the specification, (3) those above the specification.

40|$|Process {{management}} and innovation arguably remain among the concepts under focus of recent researches {{since there is}} no significantly outstanding method to measure and monitor the level of innovation in the <b>manufacturing</b> <b>processes</b> over a particular time period taking the fundamental activities of <b>manufacturing</b> <b>processes</b> into account. Although there are various studies relevant to <b>process</b> improvement, <b>manufacturing</b> <b>processes</b> are not focused on in the literature. This paper presents a novel performance indicator, called degree of process innovation, for monitoring and measuring innovation in <b>manufacturing</b> <b>processes</b> based on the four most important components among the fundamental activities of a manufacturing system. The components are namely Average Labour Utilisation, Cumulative Bottleneck Ratio, Unit Production Time and Unit Production Cost. The idea behind this approach has flourished on the basis of an indicator proposed in the literature to measure the general organisational improvements. The scope of that indicator has been narrowed down to <b>manufacturing</b> <b>processes</b> to accurately reflect the state of the <b>manufacturing</b> <b>processes.</b> The proposed approach has been verified with a case study in manufacturing industry, where each of the four sub-indicators was calculated based on the data provided and aggregated into the degree of process innovation. The innovation degree is successfully indicated...|$|R

5|$|Aurion {{takes its}} doors, windows, roof panels, body sides (except front quarters) from the Camry XV40. However, the other panels are unique {{from the regular}} Camry. This {{component}} sharing also means that Aurion has the same wheelbase, front and rear axle tracks, and interior dimensions. Interior design also largely parallels the Camry. Notable differences include the redesigned upper dashboard portion and restyled centre console, plus the substitution of the Australian Camry's hand-operated parking brake with a foot-operated equivalent (as shared with the Camry for Japan and North America). The reasoning behind this component sharing strategy was to reduce costs and to allow the car to be built alongside the Camry, thus simplifying the <b>manufacturing</b> <b>process.</b>|$|E

5|$|Believing that {{it would}} be an {{advantage}} for his son to gain a greater technical knowledge, Lilly sent Josiah to the Philadelphia College of Pharmacy in 1880. Upon returning to the family business in 1882, Josiah was named superintendent of the laboratory. In 1890, Lilly turned over the day-to day management of the business to Josiah, who ran the company for thirty-four years. The company flourished despite the tumultuous economic conditions in the 1890s. In 1894, Lilly purchased a manufacturing plant to be used solely for creating capsules. The company made several technological advances in the <b>manufacturing</b> <b>process,</b> including the automation of capsule production. Over the next few years, the company annually created tens of millions of capsules and pills.|$|E
5|$|Despite their {{technical}} complexity, neither {{device was}} revolutionary {{by the standards}} of the time. However, the total vision of their design was. Evans was attempting a radical shift in thinking about the <b>manufacturing</b> <b>process,</b> treating it as a continuous integrated whole rather than a series of isolated processes. Thus, manufacturing could be a fully automated production line. The missing link was materials handling, and Evans's mill designs sought to feed materials continuously through a system without the need for any human intervention. This was the first fully automated industrial process, and the idea of continuous production was proved to be a critical ingredient of the industrial revolution, and would ultimately lay the foundation for modern mass production.|$|E
5|$|Hafted {{tools are}} further {{representative}} of human innovation. The large cutting {{tools of the}} Acheulian technocomplex become smaller, as more complex tools are better suited towards the needs of highly diversified environments. Composite tools represent {{a new level of}} innovation in their increased efficacy and more complex <b>manufacturing</b> <b>process.</b> The ability to conceptualize beyond the mere reduction of stone cores demonstrates cognitive flexibility, and the use of glue, which was often processed with ochre, to attach flakes to hafts demonstrates an understanding of chemical changes that can be utilized beyond the simple use of color. Adhesives were used to construct hafted tools by 70ka at Sibudu Cave in South Africa.|$|E

The specifications cover all the essential requirements of the manufacture of the Indian flag including sizes, dye colour, chromatic values, brightness, thread count and hemp cordage. The guidelines are covered under civil and criminal laws and defects in the <b>manufacturing</b> <b>process</b> can result in punishments that include fines or jail terms.|$|E

5|$|The PV {{industry}} has seen drops in module prices since 2008. In late 2011, factory-gate prices for crystalline-silicon photovoltaic modules dropped below the $1.00/W mark. The $1.00/W installed cost, is often regarded in the PV industry as marking {{the achievement of}} grid parity for PV. These reductions have taken many stakeholders, including industry analysts, by surprise, and perceptions of current solar power economics often lags behind reality. Some stakeholders still have the perspective that solar PV remains too costly on an unsubsidized basis to compete with conventional generation options. Yet technological advancements, <b>manufacturing</b> <b>process</b> improvements, and industry re-structuring, mean that further price reductions are likely in coming years.|$|E
5|$|Carbon fibre is {{actually}} a carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer, and is a strong, light-weight material used {{in a number of}} applications, including sporting goods like baseball bats, car parts, helmets, sailboats, bicycles and other equipment where rigidity and high strength-to-weight ratio is important. The polymer used for this equipment is normally epoxy, but other polymers are also used, depending on the application, and other reinforcing fibres may also be included. In the blade <b>manufacturing</b> <b>process,</b> sheets of impregnated material are cut into square sheets and pressed onto a form to produce the final shape. From 30 to 90 sheets may be layered, depending on the expected weight of the athlete, and the mold is then autoclaved to fuse the sheets into a solid plate. This method reduces air bubbles that can cause breaks. Once the result is cooled, it is cut into the shape of the blades. The finished blade is bolted to a carbon fibre socket that is an intimate fit to each of Pistorius' legs. These are custom made and make up the bulk of the total cost, along with the assessment and setting up of the finished prostheses. Each limb costs between $15–18,000 USD.|$|E
5|$|GMAW {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular welding methods, {{especially}} in industrial environments. It is used extensively by the sheet metal industry and, by extension, the automobile industry. There, the method is often used for arc spot welding, thereby replacing riveting or resistance spot welding. It is also popular for automated welding, in which robots handle the workpieces and the welding gun to speed up the <b>manufacturing</b> <b>process.</b> GMAW can be difficult to perform well outdoors, since drafts can dissipate the shielding gas and allow contaminants into the weld; flux cored arc welding is better suited for outdoor use such as in construction. Likewise, GMAW's use of a shielding gas does not lend itself to underwater welding, which is more commonly performed via shielded metal arc welding, flux cored arc welding, or gas tungsten arc welding.|$|E
