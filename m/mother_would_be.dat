25|$|Shortly {{after the}} Elizabeth Key trial and similar challenges, in 1662 the Virginia royal colony {{approved}} a law adopting {{the principle of}} partus sequitur ventrem (called partus, for short), stating that any children born in the colony would take {{the status of the}} mother. A child of an enslaved <b>mother</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> born into slavery, regardless if the father were a freeborn Englishman or Christian. This was a reversal of common law practice in England, which ruled that children of English subjects took the status of the father. The change institutionalized the skewed power relationships between slaveowners and slave women, freed the white men from the legal responsibility to acknowledge or financially support their mixed-race children, and somewhat confined the open scandal of mixed-race children and miscegenation to within the slave quarters.|$|E

2500|$|At sixteen, then {{living on}} her own, Streisand's youth and {{ambition}} worked in her favor, but she lacked a mature woman's physical features which were needed for serious female roles.

2500|$|According to this text, the Vipassī Buddha was {{the first}} of six incarnations to precede Gautama. The others listed are Sikhī, Vessabhū, Kakusandha, Koṇāgamana, and Kassapa.

2500|$|Xylophones {{are widely}} used in music of west and central Africa. The name marimba stems from Bantu marimba or malimba, 'xylophone'. According to some Western sources, the word 'marimba' is formed from ma 'many' and rimba 'single-bar xylophone,' however {{the use of the}} term marimba and/or {{derivative}} terms is not present in any West African language. The instrument itself is present, but is called balafon or heri in Mali and/or Guinea, while it is known as gyil among the Akan peoples in and around Ghana. The word marimba and derivative words is used widely in East, Central and Southern Africa. A survey of the literature on the African marimba and related instruments, like the Xylorimba, likembe and ilimba indicate a relationship between the word marimba and the various lamellaphones found all over Central and East Africa. Other sources credit the creation of the marimba and the kalimba to Queen Marimba of the Wakambi people, who live south of Lake Victoria. In the Shona language [...] "imba" [...] means song. Kuimba is to sing. Marimba, is said to be the [...] "mother of song" [...] and the creator of all the instruments, including the marimba. Mama means mother in Kiswahili, so it makes perfect sense that the word <b>mother</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> combined with the word [...] "imba" [...] which is the unconjugated verb for 'sing'. The karimba is also said to have been created by Queen Marimba. In much of East & Central Africa the karimba is seen as a hand-held version of the marimba.|$|E
