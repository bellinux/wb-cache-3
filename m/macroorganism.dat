40|$|Recent {{analyses}} revealed {{that most of the}} biodiversity observed in marine microbial communities is represented by organisms with low abundance but, nonetheless essential for ecosystem dynamics and processes across both temporal and spatial scales. Surprisingly, few studies have considered the effect of macroorganism-microbe interactions on the ecology and distribution dynamics of rare microbial taxa. In this review, we synthesize several lines of evidence that these relationships cannot be neglected any longer. First, we provide empirical support that the microbiota of <b>macroorganisms</b> represents a significant part of marine bacterial biodiversity and that host-microbe interactions benefit to certain microbial populations which are part of the rare biosphere (i. e., opportunistic copiotrophic organisms). Second, we reveal the major role that <b>macroorganisms</b> may have on the dispersal and the geographic distribution of microbes. Third, we introduce an innovative and integrated view of the interactions between microbes and <b>macroorganisms,</b> namely sustaining the rares, which suggests that <b>macroorganisms</b> favor the maintenance of marine microbial diversity and are involved in the regulation of its richness and dynamics. Finally, we show how this hypothesis complements existing theories in microbial ecology and offers new perspectives about the importance of <b>macroorganisms</b> for the microbial biosphere, particularly the rare members...|$|R

40|$|Whatever {{their size}} and the {{ecosystem}} they live in, all organisms may disperse at some stage of their life cycle. Dispersal dynamics are to a varying extent dependent on organismal size, life history, ecological niche, survival capacities and phylogeny. Moves towards a synthesis in dispersal ecology have focused primarily on vertebrates and higher plants, yet recent {{studies suggest that the}} dispersal of microorganisms and <b>macroorganisms</b> has much more in common than previously assumed. The dispersal of one organism enables co-dispersal for many others, smaller in size. There is an increasing need for a more integrated approach to study dispersal within the context of organismal interactions and their environments. Such an approach is facilitated by recent developments of powerful indirect techniques that enable tracking of microorganisms and <b>macroorganisms</b> over multiple spatial and temporal scales. Likewise, dispersal modelling and theoretical models of the consequences of dispersal can inspire empirical studies across the entire size spectrum. Simultaneously studying the relationships between dispersal of microorganisms and <b>macroorganisms,</b> and accounting for dispersal through time and space, will allow us to better understand the functioning and dynamics of communities and ecosystems, and to make better predictions of future dispersal patterns, changes in biodiversity and connectivity. 16 page(s...|$|R

The aim {{of the present study was}} to investigate the diversity of bacteria and fungi isolated from eight marine invertebrate and one algae samples. Data derived from ARDRA and sequencing analyses allowed the identification of marine-derived microorganisms isolated from those samples. Microbial strains identified up to the genus level revealed 144 distinct ribotypes out of 256 fungal strains and 158 distinct ribotypes out of 181 bacterial strains. Filamentous fungi were distributed among 24 different genera belonging to Ascomycota, Zygomycota and Basidiomycota, some of which had never been reported in the literature as marine invertebrate-inhabiting fungi (Pestalotiopsis, Xylaria, Botrysphaeria and Cunnninghamella). Bacterial isolates were affiliated to 41 different genera, being Bacillus, Ruegeria, Micrococcus, Pseudovibrio and Staphylococcus the most abundant ones. Results revealed an unexpected high microbial diversity associated to the <b>macroorganisms</b> which have been collected and suggested the selection of certain microbial taxonomic groups according to the host.

40|$|The {{focus of}} this {{dissertation}} is {{the extension of the}} innate immune response in wound healing and non-wound healing contexts. I am interested in interactions at the interface between macroorganisms and microorganisms from marine/aqueous environments. This dissertation explored two aspects of the interactions: 1) the presence and function of <b>macroorganism</b> secretions and 2) the role of secretions in managing microfouling on <b>macroorganism</b> surfaces. Particularly of interest are how barriers are biochemically reinforced to mitigate microfouling and the potential consequences of a breach in those barriers. The innate immune response, an evolutionary conserved system in vertebrates and invertebrates, provides an evolutionary context for developing the hypotheses. In this dissertation the biochemical composition and uses of crustacean secretions are explored for barnacles, fiddler crabs and blue crabs. Fluids of interest were secretions released during barnacle settlement and metamorphosis and those collected from living adult barnacles, fluids on fiddler crab sensory appendages including dactyl washings and buccal secretions, and fluids from blue crab egg masses. The biochemical composition was determined using a combination of fluorescent probes and confocal microscopy, proteomics, and enzyme-specific substrates with a spectrophotometer. I demonstrated that self-wounding is inherent to the critical period of settlement and metamorphosis, in barnacles. Wounding occurs during cuticle expansion and organization and generates proteinaceous secretions, which function as a secondary mode of attachment that facilitates the transition to a sessile juvenile. I showed extensive proteomic evidence for components of all categories of the innate immune response, especially coagulation and pathogen defense during attachment and metamorphosis. This work provides insight into wound healing mechanisms that facilitate coagulation of proteinaceous material and expands the knowledge of potential glue curing mechanisms in barnacles. In order to test <b>macroorganism</b> secretions in a non-wound healing context, I examined fluids sampled from body parts that macroorganisms must keep free of microorganisms. I showed that two types of decapod crustaceans can physically manage microorganisms on most parts of their body, but certain parts are particularly sensitive or difficult to clean mechanically. I examined sensory regions on the fiddler crab, including dactyls that are important for chemoreception and the buccal cavity that is used to remove microorganisms from sand particles, and blue crab egg mass fluids that protect egg masses from fouling through embryo development. This dissertation explores organismal interactions across scales in size, space, and time. The findings from the barnacle work inform mechanisms of attachment and glue curing, both central to understanding bioadhesion. The work on fiddler crabs and blue crabs contributes to our understanding of chemoreception of feeding and reproductive behaviors. The work presented here highlights how biological secretions from macroorganisms serve multifaceted roles. In cases of physical breaches of barriers, or wounding, secretions coagulate to obstruct loss of hemolymph and have antimicrobial capabilities to prevent infection by microorganisms. In non-wounding cases, secretions remove microorganisms from surfaces, whether that is on the body of the <b>macroorganism</b> or in the immediate environment. Dissertatio...|$|E

40|$|The {{mechanisms}} that underpin the varied spatial genetic structures exhibited by free-living marine microorganisms remain controversial, with most studies emphasizing a high dispersal capability that should redistribute genetic diversity {{in contrast to}} most <b>macroorganisms</b> whose populations often retain a genetic signature of demographic response to historic climate fluctuations.
