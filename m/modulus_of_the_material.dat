40|$|AbstractA novel re-defining <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{orthotropic}} <b>material</b> {{properties in}} terms of a so-called associated geometric mean isotropic (GMI) material is used to develop a thorough buckling analysis of an axially-loaded orthotropic circular cylinder. A membrane prebuckling condition is assumed and an expression for the buckling stress is derived {{in terms of}} cylinder geometry, orthotropic <b>material</b> properties, and <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> waves in <b>the</b> buckling deformation pattern in the axial and circumferential directions. By assuming <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> waves in each direction are real-valued variables, as opposed to integers, conditions which result in stationary values <b>of</b> <b>the</b> buckling stress are sought, and once found, examined for their character as regards representing minima, maxima, or saddle points. Three quite different buckling characteristics are predicted, the particulars depending on <b>the</b> shear <b>modulus</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> orthotropic <b>material</b> relative to that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> associated GMI <b>material.</b> It is shown that if <b>the</b> shear <b>modulus</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> orthotropic <b>material</b> is greater than <b>the</b> shear <b>modulus</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> associated GMI <b>material,</b> <b>the</b> cylinder buckles into a unique axisymmetric deformation pattern. If <b>the</b> shear <b>modulus</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> orthotropic <b>material</b> is less than <b>the</b> shear <b>modulus</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> associated GMI <b>material,</b> <b>the</b> cylinder buckles into a unique nonaxisymmetric deformation pattern. If <b>the</b> shear <b>modulus</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> orthotropic <b>material</b> is exactly equal to <b>the</b> shear <b>modulus</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> associated GMI <b>material</b> (this is <b>the</b> situation for an isotropic cylinder), the cylinder can buckle into either axisymmetric or nonaxisymmetric deformation patterns. Moreover it is shown that, in this case, there exists a number of deformation patterns, all at essentially the same stress level. Closed-form lower-bound expressions for the buckling stress are developed using the adopted notation, <b>the</b> value <b>of</b> <b>the</b> shear <b>modulus</b> relative to <b>the</b> shear <b>modulus</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> GMI <b>material</b> determining which expression is applicable. <b>The</b> results <b>of</b> this analysis are applied to a circular cylinder constructed of a lattice structure consisting of helical and circumferential ribs, a so-called orthogrid lattice cylinder, where it is assumed that <b>the</b> ribs <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lattice structure are dense {{enough to be able to}} represent <b>the</b> elastic properties <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lattice with an equivalent homogenized orthotropic material. An isogrid cylinder, where the helical rib angle is 30 ° relative to the axial direction, is a special case. The orthotropic cylinder analysis is reformulated in terms <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>material</b> properties <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ribs and <b>the</b> angle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> helical ribs. For this situation the isogrid case is <b>the</b> GMI <b>material,</b> and <b>the</b> rib angle determines whether <b>the</b> shear <b>modulus</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> equivalent orthotropic <b>material</b> is greater than or less than <b>the</b> GMI <b>material.</b> This translates into <b>the</b> character <b>of</b> <b>the</b> buckling deformations depending directly on the rib angle...|$|R
