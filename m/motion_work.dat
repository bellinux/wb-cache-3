5|$|The {{transition}} from 2D graphics to 3D environments overlaid on pre-rendered backgrounds {{was accompanied by}} a focus on a more realistic presentation. In previous entries, the sizes for characters and environments were fixed, and the player saw things from a scrolling perspective. This changed with Final Fantasy VII; environments shifted with camera angles, and character model sizes shifted depending on both their place in the environment and their distance from the camera, giving a sense of scale. The choice of this highly cinematic style of storytelling, contrasting directly with Square's previous games, was attributed to Kitase, who was a fan of films and had an interest in the parallels between film and video game narrative. Character movement during in-game events was done by the character designers in the planning group. While designers normally cooperate with a motion specialist for such animations, the designers taught themselves <b>motion</b> <b>work,</b> resulting in each character's movements differing depending on their creators—some designers liked exaggerated movements, while others went for subtlety. Much of the time was spent on each character's day-to-day, routine animations. Motion specialists were brought in for the game's battle animations. The first characters the team worked with were Cloud and Barret. Some of the real-time effects, such as an explosion near the opening, were hand-drawn rather than computer animated.|$|E
25|$|The PRR {{was looking}} to rid itself of the money-losing LIRR, its most costly subsidiary, {{but no one was}} willing to buy it. Various plans, {{including}} turning it into a monorail or abandoning the eastern extremities and turning the rest into part of the New York City Subway, had been proposed. On January 20, 1965, the purchase of the Long Island Rail Road by the State of New York was decided. Governor Nelson A. Rockefeller set in <b>motion</b> <b>work</b> that was need to draft the enabling legislation, to determine a realistic value for the property. The Pennsylvania Railroad submitted a very high initial estimate, and the result of negotiations was a direct payment of $65 million and a similar amount of relief for unpaid taxes. In return, all shares of stock were surrendered to the State along with the property, rolling stock, and infrastructure. The organization that was formed to acquire the railroad from the PRR in August 1966 was the Metropolitan Commuter Transportation Authority (now the MTA). However, trimming the LIRR from its system did not provide the relief the PRR sought; after the 1968 merger into Penn Central Transportation it was bankrupt in 1970.The MCTA set out to improve the LIRR by instituting massive capital improvements {{in the form of a}} strengthened electric traction substation system, accelerated track improvements, and new rolling stock.|$|E
500|$|Tim Burton {{initially}} {{intended to}} use stop motion animation to feature the Martians, viewing it as a homage {{to the work of}} Ray Harryhausen, primarily Jason and the Argonauts. Similar to his own Beetlejuice, Burton [...] "wanted to make [...] look cheap and purposely fake-looking as possible." [...] He first approached Henry Selick, director of The Nightmare Before Christmas, to supervise the stop <b>motion</b> <b>work,</b> but Selick was busy directing James and the Giant Peach, also produced by Burton. Despite the fact that Warner Bros. was skeptical of the escalating budget and had not yet greenlit the film for production, Burton hired Barry Purves to shepherd the stop-motion work. Purves created an international team of about 70 animators, who worked on Mars Attacks! for eight months and began compiling test footage in Burbank, California. The department workers studied Gloria Swanson's choreography and movement as Norma Desmond in Sunset Boulevard for inspiration on the Martians' movement.|$|E

The force of the mainspring turns the barrel. The barrel has gear teeth around the outside that turn the center wheel once per hour — this wheel has a shaft that goes through the dial.

5000|$|Used in watches, the keyless {{work are}} the gears that wind the {{mainspring}} when the crown is turned, {{and when the}} crown is pulled out allow the hands to be set. The term originated because, before the modern form of keyless work was invented by the French watchmaker Adrien Philippe in 1843, watches were wound and set by inserting a separate key into holes {{in the back and}} turning it. [...] The core of the keyless mechanism is a gear on the watch's winding stem, the clutch (or castle wheel in Britain), with two sets of axial gear teeth on it, which slides in and out. When the stem is pushed in, a lever slides the clutch out, and the outer set of teeth engages a small wheel train which turns the mainspring arbor, winding the mainspring. When the stem is pulled out, the clutch slides in, and the inner teeth engage another wheel, which turns the hour wheel in the <b>motion</b> <b>work,</b> turning the watch's hands.|$|E
