50|$|Acer monspessulanum (<b>Montpellier</b> <b>maple)</b> is {{a species}} of maple native to the Mediterranean region from Morocco and Portugal in the west, to Turkey, Syria, Lebanon, and Israel in the east, and north to the Jura Mountains in France and the Eifel in Germany.|$|E
50|$|The {{area has}} 1015 {{different}} plant species including the Atlas Cedar (Cedrus Atlantica), the Evergreen Oak (Quercus Ilex), the Algerian Oak (Quercus Canariensis), the Maritime Pine (Pinus Pinaster), and the Spanish Juniper (Juniperus Thunifera). Other tree species {{that exist in}} the park include the <b>Montpellier</b> <b>maple,</b> the yew, and the holly.|$|E
5000|$|Maples are {{a popular}} {{choice for the}} art of bonsai. Japanese maple (Acer palmatum), Trident maple (A. buergerianum), Amur maple (A. ginnala), Field maple (A. campestre) and <b>Montpellier</b> <b>maple</b> (A. monspessulanum) are popular choices and respond well to {{techniques}} that encourage leaf reduction and ramification, but most species can be used.|$|E
50|$|The {{types of}} {{vegetation}} differ {{due to the}} municipality's fluctuation in altitude. In its lower altitudes, about 3,000 ft, there are pastures with narrow-leafed ash (Fraxinus angustifolia); and in the forest of La Herrer√≠a grow Pyrenean oaks (Quercus pyrenaica), sweet chestnuts (Castanea sativa) and <b>Montpellier</b> <b>maples</b> (Acer monspessulanum).|$|R
50|$|In the {{altitude}} between 300 and 500 metres occurs the evergreen broadleaf trees' zone (maquis. Along with oak (Quercus ilex) and Greek strawberry tree there occur kermes oak, strawberry tree, Phillyrea latifolia, bay laurel, cedar and others. Of the deciduous species most common are flaxinus ulmus, <b>Montpellier</b> <b>maple,</b> Judas tree, terebinth, Cotinus coggygria and others.|$|E
5000|$|At lower altitudes, the Guerrouch {{forest is}} largely {{dominated}} by cork oaks, but higher up Algerian chestnut-leaved oak (Quercus afares) and Algerian oak (Quercus canariensis) are also present {{and there is}} a plentiful understorey of bird cherry (Prunus avium), Mediterranean willow (Salix pedicellata), European alder (Alnus glutinosa), <b>Montpellier</b> <b>maple</b> (Acer monspessulanum) and narrow-leaved ash (Fraxinus angustifolia).|$|E
50|$|In its Asian {{home range}} the host plants are Acer japonicum and A. palmatum. In other places it readily adapts to other Maple species, which no doubt assists its spread. In Europe the main food plant is field maple (Acer campestre), {{and it has}} been {{recorded}} from box elder, Norway maple, sycamore, silver maple, <b>Montpellier</b> <b>maple,</b> Acer buergerianum, A. truncatum and red maple.|$|E
50|$|Veiga do Seixo {{is home to}} many rich {{species of}} flora and fauna. Flora include the holm oak (Quercus ilex), {{turpentine}} tree (Pistacia terebinthus), <b>Montpellier</b> <b>Maple</b> (Acer monspessulanum). Among the fauna are the European bee-eater (Merops apiaster), red-rumped swallow (Hirundo daurica), European roller (Coracias garrulus), and a rare type of gecko, (Tarentola mauritanica), which is especially difficult to find {{in other parts of}} Galicia.|$|E
50|$|Much of {{the town}} is covered with the Alepo pine (Pinus halepensis). These had belonged the Counts of Fuentes for centuries, but were later grown on {{municipal}} property. Holm oaks (Quercus ilex) dot the hills. Romeral, the Mediterranean scrub, with plenty of black juniper (Juniperus indica), lavender, sage, and other sclerophyllous shrubs, share the territory with kermes oak. There are deep gorges carved into the hard limestone of the Jurassic era caused by glacial runoff. These gorges harbor a surprising variety of flora given Fuendetodos' dry environment including: deciduous forests of hackberry, <b>Montpellier</b> <b>maple,</b> turpentine tree can be found as well as five species of fern.|$|E
50|$|Across Orjen {{vegetation}} {{varies with}} climate and altitude. While the sub-adriatic range exhibits evergreen deciduous forests, the vegetation graduates to temperate forests, conifers and tundra {{in the northern}} and upper regions. The ridges also {{have a variety of}} Mediterranean alpine vegetation - oromediterranean pastures.The typical karst country with bare limestone rochocks interspersed with parches of wood is found on lower altitudes. White Oak, Hop-hornbeam and <b>Montpellier</b> <b>Maple,</b> or the characteristic scrub of the maquis shrubland and garrigue are notable. There are stony meadows in the sunken dolina of the karst that contrast vividly with the stony slopes and rocky scrubland all round.Higher altitudes are characterised by heavy beech forest with occasional open grassy pastures. On northern branches silver fir accompanies beech. Above the beech and fir-beech forests are scattered open stands of pure Dinaric calcareous Silver Fir forests and Bosnian pine with deep-purple young cones set among stiff light-green needles. Open stony screes and rocks are exposed to the jagged ridges and summits. They are very rich in species.|$|E
