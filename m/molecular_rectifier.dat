5000|$|The {{concept of}} {{molecular}} electronics {{was first published}} in 1974 when Aviram and Ratner suggested an organic molecule that could work as a rectifier. [...] Having both huge commercial and fundamental interest, much effort was put into proving its feasibility, and 16 years later in 1990, the first demonstration of an intrinsic <b>molecular</b> <b>rectifier</b> was realized by Ashwell and coworkers for a thin film of molecules.|$|E
5000|$|A {{unimolecular}} rectifier is {{a single}} organic molecule which functions as a rectifier (one-way conductor) of electric current. The idea was first proposed in 1974 by Arieh (later Ari) Aviram, then at IBM, and Mark Ratner, then at New York University. Their publication was the first serious and concrete theoretical proposal in the new field of molecular electronics (UE).Based on the mesomeric effect of certain chemical compounds on organic molecules, a <b>molecular</b> <b>rectifier</b> was built by simulating the pn junction {{with the help of}} chemical compounds.|$|E
5000|$|In their {{treatment}} of so-called donor-acceptor complexes in the 1940s, Robert Mulliken and Albert Szent-Györgyi advanced {{the concept of}} charge transfer in molecules. They subsequently further refined the study of both charge transfer and energy transfer in molecules. Likewise, a 1974 paper from Mark Ratner and Ari Aviram illustrated a theoretical <b>molecular</b> <b>rectifier.</b> In 1988, Aviram described in detail a theoretical single-molecule field-effect transistor. Further concepts were proposed by Forrest Carter of the Naval Research Laboratory, including single-molecule logic gates. A wide range of ideas were presented, under his aegis, at a conference entitled Molecular Electronic Devices in 1988. [...] These were all theoretical constructs and not concrete devices. The direct measurement of the electronic traits of individual molecules awaited the development of methods for making molecular-scale electrical contacts. This was no easy task. Thus, the first experiment directly-measuring the conductance of a single molecule was only reported in 1995 on a single C60 molecule by C. Joachim and J. K. Gimzewsky in their seminal Physical Revie Letter paper and later in 1997 by Mark Reed and co-workers on a few hundred molecules. Since then, this branch of the field has advanced rapidly. Likewise, as it has grown possible to measure such properties directly, the theoretical predictions of the early workers have been confirmed substantially.|$|E

As an example, we show that acceptor C_ 48 B_ 12 and donor C_ 48 N_ 12 are promising components for <b>molecular</b> <b>rectifiers,</b> carbon nanotube-based p-type, n-type, n-p-n and p-n-p transistors and p-n junctions.

50|$|<b>Molecular</b> <b>rectifiers</b> are mimics {{of their}} bulk {{counterparts}} {{and have an}} asymmetric construction so that the molecule can accept electrons in one end but not the other. The molecules have an electron donor (D) in one end and an electron acceptor (A) in the other. This way, the unstable state D+ - A− will be more readily made than D− - A+. The result is that an electric current can be drawn through the molecule if the electrons are added through the acceptor end, but less easily if the reverse is attempted.|$|R
40|$|The mercury-drop {{electrode}} technique, {{when used}} to measure the current/voltage characteristics of thin films of <b>molecular</b> <b>rectifiers,</b> is a useful, if awed method of analysis. Current/voltage plots taken from a number of samples confirm previous studies taken using the scanning tunnelling microscope (STM), but indicate significant levels of penetration of the mercury into the sample or stabilising monolayer. Quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) studies of the adsorption of 7, 7, 8, 8 °- tetracyanoquinodimethane (TCNQ) onto clean gold indicate small but significant adsorption, with possible formation of a salt, via conversion of TCNQ into the radical anion. This has implications for the results of previous experiments, which indicate alternative sources for the rectification observed from donor-bridge-acceptor systems, but also suggest use of the TCNQ radical anion as a electron donor when used to replace the counterion present in a number of self-assembled systems. Previous STM- based measurements confirming this latter suggestion are supported by mercury-drop studies. The results support conclusions previously drawn by a number of authors, removing much of the ambiguity surrounding their interpretation, whilst clarifying the adsorption characteristics of thiol-based molecules that contain a terminal TCNQ group, and to some extent, TCNQ itself. It is suggested that the mercury-drop technique should never be used in isolation to quantify rectification in monolayers of <b>molecular</b> <b>rectifiers,</b> but that it is suitable for use only i confirming and checking results from more established procedures...|$|R

At finite voltage additional non-equilibrium electron-hole pair excitations involving both electrodes become possible, {{and contribute to}} the stimulated emission and absorption of phonons. We point out a generic mechanism for D-A molecules, where the stimulated emission can dominate beyond a certain voltage due to inverted position of the D and A quantum resonances. This leads to current-driven amplification (negative damping) of the phonons similar to laser-action.

Electron tunneling was found to occur locally from an electron-donating moiety of the porphyrin to the fullerene through charge-transfer interaction between them. In addition, electron tunneling within the single fullerene–porphyrin pair exhibited rectifying behavior in which electrons can be driven only at the direction from the porphyrin to the fullerene. It is demonstrated that localized electron tunneling enables us to spatially visualize the frontier orbital of the porphyrin involved in electron tunneling.

40|$|Three {{rules for}} {{creating}} highly effective unimolecular rectifiers that utilize asymmetric anchoring {{groups have been}} proposed by Van Dyck and Ratner [Ratner et al., Nano Lett., 2015, 15, 1577 – 1584]. This study investigates their proposed rectification mechanism in a functionalised azafullerene system (4 TPA–C 60) and identifies a fourth rule. NEGF-DFT shows that 4 TPA–C 60 fulfills the three design rules and finds that a saturated bridge {{is not required to}} fulfil the third rule, contrary to previous belief. Instead a twisted-π bridge decouples the donor and acceptor states whilst still providing a high conductance pathway. The molecular junction has a calculated rectification ratio of 145 at a bias of ± 1 V and the U-type rectification mechanism is driven by the pinning of the HOMO to the LUMO when the device is forward biased, but not when reverse biased. The switching behaviour is a result of a charge dipole forming at different interfaces for different bias directions. An additional design rule is thus proposed: charge transport should allow bias dependent coupling of filled to unfilled states. The findings in this work not only help in understanding charge transport in <b>molecular</b> <b>rectifiers,</b> but also have wider implications for the design of molecular resonant tunneling devices...|$|R

The rigid BCO spacer keeps the TTF donor and exTCNQ acceptor moieties apart, as demonstrated by X-ray analysis. The photophysical properties of the TTF-BCO-exTCNQ dyads were investigated by UV/Vis and EPR spectroscopy, electrochemical studies, and theoretical calculations. Langmuir–Blodgett films were prepared and used in the fabrication and electrical studies of junction devices. One dyad showed the asymmetric current–voltage (I–V) curve characteristic for rectification, unlike control compounds containing the TTF unit but not the exTCNQ moiety or comprising the exTCNQ acceptor moiety but lacking the donor TTF part, which both gave symmetric I–V curves. The direction of the observed rectification indicated that the preferred electron current flows from the exTCNQ acceptor to the TTF donor.

40|$|The {{unimolecular}} rectifier is {{a fundamental}} building block of molecular electronics.

Applications based on supramolecular concepts for developing catalysts, <b>molecular</b> wires, <b>rectifiers,</b> photochemical sensors have been evolved during recent years. Mimicking natural photosynthesis to build energy harvesting devices has become important for generating energy and solar fuels that could be stored for future use. In this dissertation, supramolecular chemistry is being explored for creating light energy harvesting devices. Photosensitization of semiconductor metal oxide nanoparticles, such as titanium dioxide (TiO 2) and tin oxide (SnO 2,), via host-guest binding approach has been explored. In the first part, self-assembly of different porphyrin macrocyclic compounds on TiO 2 layer using axial coordination approach is explored. Supramolecular dye sensitized solar cells built based on this approach exhibited Incident Photon Conversion Efficiency (IPCE) of 36 % for a porphyrin-ferrocene dyad.

We demonstrate the large-area fabrication of an array of well-ordered 15 nm wide conducting polymer nanowires by using an etch mask consisting of self-assembled patterns of cylinder-forming poly(styrene-b-dimethylsiloxane) diblock copolymer confined in topographic templates. The poly(3, 4 -ethylenedi-oxythiophene) :poly(styrenesulfonate) nanowires operated as an ethanol vapor sensor, suggesting that the electronic properties of the organic film were preserved during the patterning processes. The higher sensitivity to ethanol vapor, compared to an unpatterned film with the same thickness, was attributed to the enhanced surface-to-volume ratio of the nanowire array.

40|$|The {{trend of}} {{decreasing}} {{the size of}} top-down fabricated silicon based electronic devices led to an increasing interest in alternative concepts which allow overcoming physical but also economical limits. The concept of integrating functional molecules into electronic devices, referred to as molecular electronics, might be a concept to fabricate smaller and cheaper devices in the future. The goal of this thesis was the design and synthesis of new functional molecules for molecular junctions. To achieve molecular electronic devices, molecules need to perform functions. Among them the most appealing ones are rectification and switching. However, to enable the design of electronic functions on a molecular level, it is equally important to develop a thorough comprehension {{of the relationship between}} the molecule’s structure and its transport properties. The contents of this thesis thus contribute to various aspects of molecular electronics. A row of model compounds consisting of a non-varying oligo(phenylene ethynylene) (OPE) backbone was synthesized. As a reference molecule, an OPE with two terminal thiol anchor groups was inspected in a mechanical controllable break junction (MCBJ) on a single molecule level. Certain components were systematically varied to examine the role of contacts and intermolecular interactions in molecular junctions. After the basic investigations the molecule’s function was further enriched and molecular switches and molecule based rectifiers moved into the focus of interest. Two redox switches based on ferrocene were proposed. In both switches, the ferrocene was functionalized in the 1, 1 ’-position with two linkers comprising thiol anchor groups. Whereas in the first model compound the linkers consist of rather poor conducting alkyl groups, the linkers of the second switch are conjugated vinyl groups to provide an efficient electronic coupling to the electrodes. The latter switch was electrochemically characterized and a fully reversible redox reaction was observed. It was possible to immobilize single molecules of the switch in an MCBJ setup. Combining the MCBJ setup with an electrochemical cell, the conductance of the immobilized molecule was investigated in relation to an applied potential with respect to a reference electrode. Indeed, a change in the conductance correlating with the oxidation state was observed, thus the molecular junction can be considered as a reversible single molecule redox switch. Furthermore a new switching concept based on the interplay of electrode and molecule was proposed. Therefore, different pathways for electrons in a cruciform type structure consisting of two crossed rods were considered. One of the rods bears terminal sulphur groups, whereas the second transversal rod is functionalized terminally with pyridine subunits. In an electrochemically controllable MCBJ the coordination of the pyridine nitrogen is expected to bind to the gold surface in dependence of the surface potential of the electrodes. The synthesis and characterization of several cruciform model compounds were synthesized to investigate the proposed coordination induced switch. The model compounds were investigated on a single molecule level in a MCBJ setup. No switching behaviour was obtained yet, nevertheless, the obtained results revealed that the molecules are functional and that electron transport is possible through both of the crossed rods. Further a <b>molecular</b> <b>rectifier</b> based on two meta-substituted benzene units, one functionalized with an electron donating group, the other with an electron withdrawing group was proposed. The synthesis was performed, but no integration experiments have yet been performed. An additional signal from a molecule other than the electrical response would be very appealing to obtain information from integrated molecules. We propose to profit from electroluminescence (EL) of a molecule connected to two electrodes. EL as signal from molecules is very appealing as it indicates that molecules are bridging the electrodes and the emitted light is characteristic for the fluorophore. Three target structures possessing fluorophores were designed to bridge a 5 nm gap of two single-walled carbon nanotube electrodes. The synthesis and characterization of three target structures with a length of around 7. 5 nm was described. The photophysical investigations in solution confirmed the possibility of tuning the absorption and emission bands. The integration into a single-walled carbon nanotube device was successfully performed and the nanotube-molecule-nanotube junction was characterized by its I/V-characteristics. Furthermore, the characteristic emission signal of integrated molecules was detected upon electrical excitation. The main work of this thesis was from synthetic nature, but in collaboration with physicists, it was contributed to several aspects of molecular electronics. ...|$|E
40|$|A Clever Combination : Organic Molecules & Nanoparticles In view {{of current}} and future {{technological}} developments, Si-based mi- croelectronics faces a constant need for miniaturisation. However, its evolution towards nanoelectronics presents severe physical and economic limitations. Several potential alternatives to supplement or to replace the current technology have been investigated, like silicon MOSFETs 1, 2, 3, or techniques based on novel materials such as carbon nanotubes 4, 5. An- other alternative {{is based on the}} use of single organic molecules, acting as electronic switches and storage elements 6. Indeed, molecules exhibit inherent advantages over the current devices, making them appear as the ideal object for designing future high-density electronic devices. They are several orders of magnitude smaller than present feature sizes. They may be produced in large amounts absolutely identically and in a cheap way by chemical synthesis. Their physical properties are tunable by their struc- tures. In addition, they have the potential to self-organise into regular 2 D or 3 D patterns. Therefore, complete systems for information processing may be built from basic functional units consisting of molecules acting as logic devices. The use of molecules to perform electronic functions was first pro- posed in 1971 by Kuhn 7, followed by Aviram and Ratner 8 in 1974, who, based on theoretical assumptions, envisioned the use of a donor-acceptor molecule to produce a <b>molecular</b> <b>rectifier.</b> At this time, any realisation of a molecular device was technologically absolutely unfeasible. Nowadays, the development of this visionary concept and its extension into the ex- perimental domain has become the broad research area called Molecular Electronics 9, as demonstrated by the increasing number of citations of this early paper (Figure 1. 1). The real beauty of this concept is the per- spective that specific electronic functions of a device may be adjusted by the design of the chemical structure of the molecules 10, 11. Moreover, additional tunability by other stimuli, like voltage, light or magnetic field can be envisioned. In this research area, two very di®erent approaches are under exten- sive investigation: the bulk molecular systems and the single molecular systems. The first one is defined by characteristic dimensions which are much larger than the sizes of the molecules. Consequently, most of the molecules are in contact with other molecules, making them not individ- ually addressable. The properties of this ensemble must be considered as a whole. In contrast, single molecular systems aim for individual contact to single molecules or small arrays of perfectly ordered molecules. This second approach strongly di®ers from the first one, as it tries to utilise the physical properties of single molecules for nanosized electronic devices. A basic requirement for Molecular Electronics is the connection of the molecules to the outside world. In the case of bulk molecular systems, this is achievable thanks to conventional UV or electron-beam lithogra- phy, which enables the fabrication of micrometre-scale contact patterns (down to 20 nm). For single molecular systems, an electrode pair with nanometre-sized spacing to contact a single molecule is needed. Although the development of such a device is challenging, the technological advance would provide the possibility to address one or few molecules. Several techniques were investigated, such as STM 12, 13, 14, mechanically control- lable break junctions (MCBJ) 15, 16, cross-bar arrays 17, 18, 19, electromigra- tion 20, 21 or mercury droplet 22. Quantum phenomena such as Coulomb blockade 20, Kondo e®ect 21 and negative di®erential conductance 10 have already been observed. However, reproducibility and stability of such re- sults still remain uncertain 23. Indeed, the mobility of electrodes' atoms makes the metal-molecule junction unstable, strongly a®ecting the prop- erties of the device, meaning that large ensembles of molecules would therefore be more suitable for technological applications. Devices devel- oped using this second approach are already present on the market, such as for example liquid crystal displays or organic light emitting diodes. Although tremendous progress was achieved on both approaches {{over the past few decades}} 24, 25, 26, the understanding of current transport through molecules remains uncomplete. Both experimental and theoretical evi- dence show that the electronic properties of molecular junctions are not only dictated by the molecules contacted, but also depend on the anchor- ing groups and on the electrodes forming the junction 23, 27. Thus, along with the properties of the molecule itself, those of the block - molecule-contact" also have to be considered. Introducing such building blocks into functional electronic circuits remains a demanding task, re- quiring innovative approaches in fabrication philosophy and circuit struc- ture 17, 28. Nanometre-size metallic nanoparticles as intermediate elec- trodes can be used as an elegant solution to build molecular junctions with well-defined geometry and electronic properties. Indeed, combin- ing metallic nanoparticles with molecules to form such building blocks would overcome the size mismatch between nanometre-scale molecules and micrometre-scale electrodes 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35. We propose in this PhD Thesis a multidisciplinary study, interlink- ing chemistry (synthesis of nano-objects constituting building blocks), engineering (design of circuits based on the assembly of such building blocks) and physics (understanding of the ensemble properties). Con- cretely, two projects based on the assembly of nanoparticles were per- formed, on one hand, one-dimensional assembly, and on the other hand, two-dimensional assembly. The first one combines nanolithography and electrostatic trapping of colloids to achieve the fabrication of conducting nanoparticle chains. The second project consists of the self-assembly and the micro-contact printing of ligand-protected nanoparticles, followed by in-situ ligand exchange reactions. This fabrication method enables the preparation of stable two-dimensional networks of molecular junctions. Remarkably, this approach, combining the single molecular approach and the bulk molecular approach introduced above, takes the advantages of addressability of the first one and stability of the second one...|$|E
40|$|This thesis studies {{electronic}} {{properties of}} molecular devices in the limiting cases of strong and weak electrode-molecule coupling. In these two limits, {{we use the}} complementary techniques of X-Ray spectroscopy and Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM) to understand the mechanisms for electrode-molecule bond formation, the energy level realignment due to metal-molecule bonds, the effect of coupling strength on single-molecule conductance in low-bias measurements, {{and the effect of}} coupling on transport under high-bias. We also introduce molecular designs with inherent asymmetries, and develop an analytical method to determine the effect of these features on high-bias conductance. This understanding of the role of electrode-molecule coupling in high-bias regimes enables us to develop a series of functional electronic devices whose properties can be predictably tuned through chemical design. First, we explore the weak electrode-molecule coupling regime by studing the interaction of two types of paracyclophane derivates that are coupled `through-space' to underlying gold substrates. The two paracyclophane derivatives differ in the strength of their intramolecular through-space coupling. X-Ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) and Near-Edge X-ray Absorbance Fine Structure (NEXAFS) spectroscopy allows us to determine the orientation of both molecules; Resonant Photoemission Spectroscopy (RPES) then allows us to measure charge transfer time from molecule to metal for both molecules. This study provides a quantititative measure of charge transfer time as a function of through-space coupling strength. Next we use this understanding in STM based single-molecule current-voltage measurements of a series of molecules that couple through-space to one electrode, and through-bond to the other. We find that in the high-bias regime, these molecules respond differently depending on the direction of the applied field. This asymmetric response to electric field direction results in diode-like behavior. We vary the length of these asymmetrically coupled molecules, and find that we can increase the rectifying characteristics of these molecules by increasing length. Next, we explore the strong-coupling regime with an X-Ray spectroscopy study of the formation of covalent gold-carbon bonds using benzyltrimethyltin molecules on gold surfaces in ultra high vacuum conditions. Through X-ray Photoemission Spectroscopy (XPS) and X-ray absorption measurements, we find that the molecule fragments at the Sn-Benzyl bond when exposed to gold and the resulting benzyl species only forms covalent Au-C bonds on less coordinated Au surfaces like Au(110). We also find spectroscopic evidence for a gap state localized on the Au-C bond that results from the covalent nature of the bond. Finally, we use Density Functional Theory based Nudged Elastic Band methods to find reaction pathways and energy barriers for this reaction. We use our knowledge of the electronic structure of these bonds to create single-molecule junctions containing Au-C bonds in STM-based break junction experiments. In analogy with our approach for the weakly coupled `through-space' systems, we study the high-bias current-voltage characteristics of molecules with one strong Au-C bond, and one weaker donor-acceptor bond. These experiments reveal that the `gap state' created due to the covalent nature of the Au-C bond remains essentially pinned to the Fermi level of its corresponding electrode, and that most of the electric potential drop in the junction occurs on the donor-acceptor bond; as a result, these molecules behave like rectifiers. We use this principle to create a series of three <b>molecular</b> <b>rectifiers,</b> and show that the unique properties of the Au-C bond allow us to easily tune the rectification ratio by modifying a single electronic parameter. We then explore the process of molecular self-assembly to create organic electronic structures on metal surfaces. Specifically, we study the formation of graphene nanoribbons using a brominated precursor deposited on Au(111) surface in ultra high vacuum. We find that the halogen atoms cleave from the precursors at surprisingly low temperatures of < 100 C, and find that the resulting radicals bind to Au, forming Au-C and Au-Br bonds. We show that the Br desorbs at relatively low temperatures of < 250 C, and that polymerization of the precursor molecules to form nanoribbons proceeds only after the debrominization of the surface. Finally, with Angle-Resolved Photoemission and Density Functional Theory calculations, we quantify the interaction strength of the resulting nanoribbons with the underlying gold substrate. Taken together, the results presented in this thesis offer a mechanistic understanding of the formation of electrode-molecule bonds, and also an insight into the high-bias behavior of molecular junctions as a function of electrode-molecule coupling. In addition, our work in developing tunable, functional electronic devices serves as a framework for future technological advances towards molecule-based computation...|$|R
40|$|Molecular {{electronics}} {{is an area}} of micro/nanoelectronics with {{a number}} of farreaching goals and challenges: denser implementation of electronic memory and logic, less expensive manufacturing, smaller or more sensitive measurement devices, selfassembly of devices and systems and, last but not least, exploring new science and applications. In recent years, molecular electronics has expanded into a broader field of molecular-scale electronics, partly because molecular components have to be defined in solid-state contexts via lithography and self-assembly, and effectively become hybrid devices with new and interesting properties. This thesis therefore provides an overview and critical assessment of recent experimental and theoretical development in the field of molecular-scale electronics, with focus on molecular-scale components for circuits and systems capable of performing information processing. The central part of this thesis is an in-depth investigation of one such device, the Nanocell, a self-assembled multi-terminal nanoelectronic switching network built from molecular (scale) linker elements with strongly non-linear and hysteretic current-voltage characteristics (IVC). The non-linearity involves negative differential resistance (NDR). The ground breaking generic new result is a demonstration, by programming from the edges without direct external access to individual links, how to configure the untrained Nanocell after fabrication and also how to reconfigure an already configured Nanocell to becoming a specific type of logic gate. The thesis also makes credible that the reconfiguration scheme is robust to most variations in the initial network topology. The thesis also contributes two theoretical investigations of normal and superconducting electron transport through molecular scale objects. One study demonstrates the importance of the molecular adsorption site (metal-molecule contact) for electron transport through a gold-sulfur-benzene-sulfur-gold (Au-DTB-Au) single-molecule junction. In particular, DTB and similar molecules with the terminal S-atoms buried in Au-vacancies shows prominent narrow transmission peaks close to the Fermi level, suggesting opportunities for devicing <b>molecular</b> switches and <b>rectifiers.</b> In the other transport investigation, it is shown that a quantum dot coupled to a phonon and positioned between two superconductors, can be used for Andreev Level spectroscopy. </p...|$|R
40|$|LANKA D. W. WICKRAMASINGHE ARACHCHILAGE August 2014 Advisor: Professor Cláudio N. Verani Major: Chemistry (Inorganic) Degree: Doctor of Philosophy The silicon-based microelectronic {{industry}} has made remarkable technological advancements. Among these, new generation consumer electronics, telecommunication devices, and high performance data processing smart devices are of special interest. At present, electronic components existing {{on a single}} silicon chip grow rapidly, and soon the miniaturization process of electrical components will face limitations due to heat dissipation. Therefore, as an advanced alternative for silicon-based electronic components, the investigation of nanoscale molecular electronic devices is of great importance. This dissertation research {{is focused on the}} development of redox-active asymmetric metallosurfactants as potential candidates for molecule-based electronics. Asymmetric donor-acceptor type [D-A] molecules are promising candidates to study the current rectification behavior. In order to address this phenomenon, a series of ligands with phenolate moieties and, their gallium(III), iron(III), and manganese(III) complexes with [N 2 O 3] and [N 2 O 2] coordination environments were synthesized and structurally characterized using multiple methods. Ligands were designed with different electron-donating and electron-withdrawing substituents, to modulate structural, chemical, and physical properties, such as geometry, spectroscopic, redox, film formation, and electrical properties. As an initial attempt, low symmetry gallium(III) and iron(III) complexes with [N 2 O 3] binding moieties were developed. Different alkyl substituents are introduced to the phenylenediamine moiety of the main ligand structure to allow for film formation of the metal complexes. The electrochemical properties of gallium(III) complexes show ligand-based redox processes, while the iron(III) complexes show metal- and ligand-centered redox processes. The EPR data of iron(III) complexes indicate the formation of high spin species under [N 2 O 3] coordination environment. Metal complexes with methoxy and methoxyethoxy substituents on the phenylenediamine moiety, show formation of homogeneous conformal thin films at the air/water and air/solid interfaces. However, a possible amine/imine conversion is observed for gallium(III) and iron(III) complexes at the air/water interface. This interconversion is evident in the spectroscopic data of gallium(III) and iron(III) thin films. This study exhibits promising results in merging surfactant and redox properties into a single molecule. The iron(III) complexes indicate, that phenolate moieties act as donors when coordinated trivalent metal ions and the iron(III) center acts as an electron-acceptor moiety. These data suggest further investigations for iron(III) complexes to study their electrical properties followed by device fabrication. When designing a current rectifier, energy of frontier molecular orbitals should be comparable to energy of the metal Fermi levels. Then, the potential candidate can show an efficient electron transfer between the molecule and metal electrodes. In addition, if the molecule shows lower HOMO-LUMO energy gap, a unimolecular current rectification mechanism is applicable. Such situations facilitate efficient internal electron transfer pathways. The best possible way to modulate the HOMO-LUMO energy difference is the introduction of electron-withdrawing substituents into the molecular design. If these substituents are redox-active, then the overall redox properties of the molecule can be enhanced. In order to achieve this goal, two nitro substituted iron(III) complexes with [N 2 O 3] and [N 2 O 2] coordination environments were investigated. Both complexes showed pentacoordinate geometry around the metal ion. These two iron(III) complexes showed excellent redox properties with lower potential differences between the first oxidation and reduction peaks, when compared to alkyl substituted iron(III) complexes. However, the iron(III) complex with [N 2 O 3] donor set was found to be a better redox candidate when compared to the other. The density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggest, that the first cathodic process to be iron(III) /(II) redox couple, and the other cathodic and anodic redox processes to be nitro reductions and phenolate oxidations, respectively. Both complexes form mono and multilayers at the air/solid interface. Spectroscopic and surface analyses of these two complexes show formation of well-ordered conformal LB films with intact molecular structures. Therefore, this investigation suggests that nitro substituted iron(III) complexes are successful in obtaining more redox accessible states with low HOMO-LUMO energies when compared to iron(III) complexes with electron-donating substituents. The modulation of HOMO and LUMO energies is important when designing <b>molecular</b> <b>rectifiers.</b> Device fabrication studies were performed to investigate the feasibility of applying iron(III) complexes with [N 2 O 3] environments in molecule-based electronics. An iron(III) complex [FeIIIL 4] with methoxyethoxy substituents was investigated, and this complex showed the iron(III) /(II) reduction process at - 1. 49 V vs. Fc+/Fc. The iron(III) complex formed well-organized uniform thin films at air/water and air/solid interfaces with a collapse pressure of ~ 60 mN/m. The device with gold|LB-monolayer|gold configuration shows asymmetrical current responses with rectification ratios varying from 4. 52 to 12 between - 2 and + 2 V and from 2. 95 to 36. 7 between - 4 and + 4 V, respectively. Therefore, this study showed that triphenolate coordinated iron(III) complexes are able to act as potential current rectifiers. Further studies are performed to identify the possibility of using iron(III) complexes with [N 2 O 2] donor sets for current rectification. This study also examined a probable current rectifying mechanism for iron(III) systems. In order to address this, two iron(III) complexes with salophen-type ligands were synthesized and structurally characterized. These iron(III) complexes have substituted phenolate moieties (tert-butyl and nitro) to facilitate different physical and chemical properties. The nitro substituted iron(III) complex forms a μ-oxo bridged species due to electronic and steric effects. The tert-butyl substituted iron(III) complex showed current rectifying properties with rectification ratios ranging from 3. 99 to 28. 6 between - 2 and + 2 V and from 2. 04 to 31 between - 4 and + 4 V, respectively. This study also showed, that the asymmetrical nature of the iron(III) complex is fundamental for the observed current rectification. The tert-butyl substituted iron(III) complex displays metal-centered, singly occupied molecular orbitals (SOMO), and ligand-centered, highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMO). Additionally, the electrochemical and DFT calculations of this system suggest, that the SOMO energy level is closer to the metal Fermi level when compared to the HOMO energy level. Therefore, electron transfer through SOMO energy level is energetically more favorable than electron transfer through the HOMO energy level. According to this data, an asymmetric current rectification mechanism is plausible for this [D-A] type iron(III) complex. Manganese(III) complexes that are immobilized onto solid surfaces are another important class of compounds {{that can be used in}} electronic applications. Therefore, a series of manganese complexes with [N 2 O 3] and [N 2 O 2] donor sets were investigated. These complexes show metal-based manganese(III) /(II) and ligand-based oxidation redox processes in their cyclic voltammograms. The majority of manganese(III) complexes form well-ordered uniform LB films. The LB film analyses, also suggest that the molecular structure remains intact during the film formation processes. These manganese(III) complexes display possible [D-A] structures, nevertheless gold|LB-monolayer|gold devices of the most promising candidate show asymmetric current responses with poor current amplitudes, thus behaved as an insulator. The observed current insulating behavior could be due to structural and/or electronic parameters of manganese(III) complex and further investigations are necessary to identify the foundation. This dissertation research presented new classes of saloph-type and triphenolate ligand systems and their gallium(III), iron(III), and manganese(III) complexes, which can merge redox and amphiphilic properties together. More importantly, this project facilitated the understanding of geometric, electronic, redox, and amphiphilic properties of different classes of metal complexes. Finally, this project allowed the study electrical properties of iron(III) complexes with [N 2 O 3] and [N 2 O 2] donor sets and reveled directional flow of electrical current to denote the rectifying behavior...|$|R
