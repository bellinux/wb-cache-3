30|$|In {{the present}} paper, we propose an {{efficient}} modulo-like FFT scheduling for VLIW processors. Our implemented methodology allows better core-level resource balance, exploiting {{the fact that}} the twiddle factors can be calculated recurrently using multipliers and entirely generated in <b>masked</b> <b>time.</b> The resulting scheme created a vital balance between the computation capability and the data bandwidth that are required by the FFT algorithm, taking into account the VLIW architecture. Moreover, an important amount of input buffers can be freed since twiddle factors are no longer stored, nor referenced from memory, avoiding significant memory stalls. Since the recurrent computation of twiddle factors using multipliers induces a processing error, a tradeoff parameter between accuracy and speed is introduced.|$|E

Donning the <b>Mask</b> of <b>Time,</b> Vakama confronts Makuta, but, unable to fully control {{the power of the}} mask, he only slows time down, {{rendering}} him unable to dodge the Makuta's next attack.

With a single shot from his Kanoka disk launcher, Vakama knocks the <b>Mask</b> of <b>Time</b> out of Makuta's hands and into the sea. The enraged Makuta attempts to kill Vakama, but is defeated when he accidentally grabs a humongous boulder, causing him to be embedded into the Great Barrier. Vakama's fellow Toa join him, and they combine their powers to seal Makuta in a protodermis prison. Vakama glances back towards Metru Nui one last time, and then continues with the other Toa towards the light, arriving on the island of Mata Nui.|$|R

40|$|We {{introduce}} {{the concept of}} <b>time</b> <b>mask,</b> which {{is a type of}} temporal filter suitable for selection of multiple disjoint time intervals in which some query conditions fulfil. Such a filter can be applied to time-referenced objects, such as events and trajectories, for selecting those objects or segments of trajectories that fit in one of the selected time intervals. The selected subsets of objects or segments are dynamically summarized in various ways, and the summaries are represented visually on maps and/or other displays to enable exploration. The <b>time</b> <b>mask</b> filtering can be especially helpful in analysis of disparate data (e. g., event records, positions of moving objects, and time series of measurements), which may come from different sources. To detect relationships between such data, the analyst may set query conditions on the basis of one dataset and investigate the subsets of objects and values in the other datasets that co-occurred in time with these conditions. We describe the desired features of an interactive tool for <b>time</b> <b>mask</b> filtering and present a possible implementation of such a tool. By example of analysing two real world data collections related to aviation and maritime traffic, we show the way of using <b>time</b> <b>masks</b> in combination with other types of filters and demonstrate the utility of the <b>time</b> <b>mask</b> filtering...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Inverse {{lithography}} technology �ILT � is {{a procedure}} that optimizes the mask layout to produce an image at the wafer with the targeted aerial image. For an illumination condition optimized for dense pitches, ILT inserts model-based subresolution assist features �AF � to improve the imaging of isolated features. ILT is ideal for random contact hole patterns, in which the AF are not at intuitive locations. The raw output of ILT consists of very complex smooth shapes that must be simplified for an acceptable <b>mask</b> write <b>time.</b> It is challenging for ILT to quickly converge to the ideal pattern {{as well as to}} simplify the pattern to one that can be manufactured quickly. ILT has many parameters that effect process latitude, background suppression, conversion run <b>time,</b> and <b>mask</b> write <b>time.</b> In this work, an optimization procedure is introduced to find the best tradeoff between image quality and run time or write time. A conversion run time reduction of 4. 7 � is realized with the outcome of this optimization procedure. Simulations of <b>mask</b> write <b>time</b> quantify the ability of ILT to be used for full chip applications. The optimization procedure is also applied to alternate mask technologies to reveal their advantages over commonly used 6 % attenuated phase shif...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND [...] Continuous {{positive}} airway pressure (CPAP) {{therapy is}} {{the treatment of}} choice for the sleep apnoea/hypopnoea syndrome. Compliance with this relatively obtrusive therapy has not been well studied. METHODS [...] Usage of CPAP was investigated in 54 patients with sleep apnoea/hypopnoea syndrome (median 36 (range 7 - 129) apnoeas + hypopnoeas/hour slept) over the first 1 - 3 months after starting CPAP therapy. In all cases CPAP usage was monitored by hidden time clocks that indicated for how long the machines were switched on [...] that is, the CPAP run time. In 32 patients the time at which the CPAP mask pressure was at the therapeutic level of CPAP pressure set for that patient [...] that is, the <b>mask</b> <b>time</b> [...] was also monitored. In all patients objective daytime sleepiness was assessed by multiple sleep latency before and after CPAP therapy. RESULTS [...] The mean (SE) nightly CPAP run time was 4. 7 (0. 4) hours. There was no correlation between run time and severity of the sleep apnoea/hypopnoea syndrome as assessed by apnoea + hypopnoea frequency or multiple sleep latency, and no correlation between CPAP usage and improvement in multiple sleep latency. Thirty two patients in whom <b>mask</b> <b>time</b> was recorded had therapeutic CPAP pressures for 89 % (3 %) of their CPAP run times. Patients who experienced side effects from CPAP used their CPAP machines significantly less {{than those who did}} not. CONCLUSIONS [...] Patients with sleep apnoea/hypopnoea syndrome used CPAP for less than five hours/night on average with no correlation between severity of sleep apnoea/hypopnoea syndrome and CPAP usage. Patients who complained of side effects used their CPAP therapy less. It is recommended that, as a minimum, CPAP run time should be regularly recorded in all patients receiving CPAP therapy...|$|R

We manipulated the visibility of masked stimuli and contrasted it with their influence on the speed of motor actions, comparing the temporal dynamics of visual awareness in metacontrast masking with that of action priming under the same conditions. We observed priming with identical time course for reportable and invisible prime stimuli, despite qualitative changes in the <b>masking</b> <b>time</b> course. Our findings indicate that experimental variations that modify the subjective visual experience of masked stimuli have no effect on motor effects of those stimuli in early processing.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the theoretical blueprint {{of a new}} secure token called the Externalized Microprocessor (X_P). Unlike a smartcard, the X_P contains no ROM at all. While exporting all the device's executable code to potentially untrustworthy terminals poses formidable security problems, the advantages of ROM-less secure tokens are numerous: chip <b>masking</b> <b>time</b> disappears, bug patching becomes a mere terminal update and hence does not imply any roll-out of cards in the field. Most importantly, code size ceases to be a limiting factor. This is particularly significant given the steady increase in on-board software complexity. After describing the machine's instruction-set we introduce a public-key oriented architecture design which relies on a new RSA screening scheme and features a relatively low communication overhead. We propose two protocols that execute and dynamically authenticate arbitrary programs, provide a strong security model for these protocols and prove their security under appropriate complexity assumptions...|$|R

40|$|Office {{buildings}} are key energy consumers and thus require attention to achieve efficient operation. While individual office spaces are dynamically used, current building automation does not receive information on utilisation {{that could be}} used to adaptively adjust energy consumption. In this work, we propose an approach to estimate people count per office space using distributed strategically placed PIR sensors and algorithms that can process the distributed sensor information. We detail our sensing node and evaluate its performance in an office installation. A sensor model was subsequently used in a floor-wide simulation of realistic occupant behaviours to investigate two algorithms to estimate people count per office space. The occupant behaviour simulations confirmed that our estimation algorithms can accurately predict people count in different office use scenarios. The errors introduced by the PIR <b>masking</b> <b>time</b> after a detection can be partially compensated when using distributed sensor information.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the localization of deformation acceleration {{in the period}} prior to dynamic failure in hornblende schist rock under triaxial compression using acoustic emission (AE) monitoring. Rather than stabilize the failure process by controlling axial stress to maintain a constant rate of AE (for monitoring AE hypocenters) as in previous works [e. g., Lockner et al., 1991], we have instead developed a rapid multichannel data collection system. This enables us to elucidate the dynamics of fault nucleation under condition of constant stress (creep) loading, which is a better approximation to low strain rate condition in the Earth and allows both quasistatic and dynamic crack growth to occur. The waveforms of more than 8000 AE events which occurred mainly during a 15 s period were recorded on 32 channels, with a sampling rate of 50 ns and <b>mask</b> <b>time</b> of 200 s.

40|$|Time-reversed masker {{processed}} {{from the}} target speech, which is different from other maskers because of its unsteadiness, has the highest <b>masking</b> efficiency. For <b>time</b> and economical reason, other than subjective measurement, appropriate objective measurements of speech intelligibility for speech <b>masked</b> by <b>time</b> reversed masker processed {{from the target}} speech should be considered. Four objective evaluation methods are analyzed in this paper to find which of them has the highest correlation with speech intelligibility of speech masked by time-reversed masker processed from the target speech in open-plan offices. Results showed that although STI has high correlation with speech intelligibility for masking speech by steady noise, it cannot represent the subjective speech intelligibility very well for <b>masking</b> speech by <b>time</b> reversed signal. A Short-Time Objective Intelligibility (STOI), Modified normalized covariance method (mNCM) and Perceptually Evaluation of Speech Quality (PESQ) all has high efficiency to predict speech intelligibility of speech masked by time-reversed masker processed from the target speech. We further applied STOI to investigate the effect of two parameters (reversed frame length and Target-to-Masker Ratio) in this masker on speech intelligibility. The experiment results showed that reversed frame length between 120 ms and 240 ms and Target-to-Masker Ratio lower than - 5 dB will lead to poor speech intelligibility...|$|R

40|$|Quantifying the {{distributions}} of disease risk {{in space and}} time jointly is a key element for understanding spatio-temporal phenomena while also having the potential to enhance our understanding of epidemiologic trajectories. However, most studies to date have neglected time dimension and focus instead on the "average" spatial pattern of disease risk, thereby <b>masking</b> <b>time</b> trajectories of disease risk. In this study we propose a new idea titled "spatio-temporal kernel density estimation (stKDE) " that employs hybrid kernel (i. e., weight) functions to evaluate the spatio-temporal disease risks. This approach not only can make full use of sample data but also "borrows" information in a particular manner from neighboring points both {{in space and time}} via appropriate choice of kernel functions. Monte Carlo simulations show that the proposed method performs substantially better than the traditional (i. e., frequency-based) kernel density estimation (trKDE) which has been used in applied settings while two illustrative examples demonstrate that the proposed approach can yield superior results compared to the popular trKDE approach. In addition, there exist various possibilities for improving and extending this method...|$|R
