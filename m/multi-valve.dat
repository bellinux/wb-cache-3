25|$|Ducati's liquid-cooled, <b>multi-valve</b> V-twins, {{made from}} 1985 on, {{are known as}} Desmoquattro ("desmodromic valve four"). These include the 851, 916 and 996, 999 and a few {{predecessors}} and derivatives.|$|E
25|$|The {{overhead}} camshaft design adds more valvetrain components that ultimately {{result in more}} complexity and higher manufacturing costs, but this is easily offset by many advantages over the older design: <b>multi-valve</b> design, higher RPM limit, and design freedom to better place valves, spark plugs (Spark-ignition engine), and intake/exhaust ports.|$|E
25|$|Within a few years, {{a dizzying}} {{assortment}} of technologies {{were being used}} by hundreds of producers all over the western world. Steam, electricity, and petrol/gasoline-powered automobiles competed for decades, with petrol/gasoline internal combustion engines achieving dominance in the 1910s. Dual- and even quad-engine cars were designed, and engine displacement ranged {{to more than a}} dozen litres. Many modern advances, including gas/electric hybrids, <b>multi-valve</b> engines, overhead camshafts, and four-wheel drive, were attempted, and discarded at this time.|$|E
50|$|In 1986 Volkswagen {{introduced}} a <b>multi-valved</b> Golf GTI 16V. The 16-valve 1.8-liter straight-4 produced 139 PS (102 kW; 137 bhp) or 56.7 kW/liter, almost 25% {{up from the}} 45.6 kW/liter for the previous 8-valve Golf GTI engine.|$|R
50|$|Rorippa barbareifolia {{can easily}} be {{distinguished}} from other species in the genus by its <b>multi-valved</b> fruits. Rorippa barbareifolia fruits have 3-6 valves, usually 4, while other species generally have 2, rarely 3. The plants are annual herbs with yellow, 4-parted flowers.|$|R
50|$|The {{engine family}} utilises twin {{overhead}} camshafts and <b>multi-valves,</b> single or twin turbochargers with an air-to-air intercooler, and innovative compacted graphite iron (CGI) block construction {{that leads to}} a low weight of 202 kg dry. Fuel supply is high-pressure common rail direct injection.|$|R
25|$|Power: Because each {{cylinder}} on a {{radial engine}} {{has its own}} head, it is impractical to use a multivalve valvetrain on a radial engine. Therefore, almost all radial engines use a two valve pushrod-type valvetrain which may result in less power for a given displacement than <b>multi-valve</b> inline engines. The limitations of the poppet valve were largely overcome {{by the development of}} the sleeve valve, but at the cost of increased complexity, maintenance costs and reduced reliability.|$|E
25|$|Until the mid-1940s, the {{traditional}} horizontal four-stroke single-cylinder 500cc engines were fitted with one overhead and one side valve but {{contrary to the}} usual practice of having inlet over exhaust (IOE), this employed the side valve for induction and the overhead valve for exhaust. Also unusual was the adoption of only one hairspring (type of valve spring) to close the exhaust valve. These were the highest performance engines Moto Guzzi sold to the general public. By contrast, the company supplied the official racing team and private racers with higher performance racing machines with varying overhead cam, <b>multi-valve</b> configurations and cylinder designs.|$|E
25|$|The vintage era {{lasted from}} the end of World War I (1918), through to the Wall Street Crash at the end of 1929. During this period the front-engined car came to {{dominate}} with closed bodies and standardised controls becoming the norm. In 1919, 90% of cars sold were open; by 1929, 90% were closed. Development of the internal combustion engine continued at a rapid pace, with <b>multi-valve</b> and overhead camshaft engines produced at the high end, and V8, V12, and even V16 engines conceived for the ultra-rich. Also in 1919, hydraulic brakes were invented by Malcolm Loughead (co-founder of Lockheed); they were adopted by Duesenberg for their 1921 Model A. Three years later, Hermann Rieseler of Vulcan Motor invented the first automatic transmission, which had two-speed planetary gearbox, torque converter, and lockup clutch; it never entered production. (Its like would only become an available option in 1940.) Just {{at the end of the}} vintage era, tempered glass (now standard equipment in side windows) was invented in France. In this era the revolutionary ponton design of cars without fully articulated fenders, running boards and other non-compact ledge elements was introduced in small series but mass production of such cars was started much later (after WWII).|$|E
5000|$|Powertrain {{development}} {{for diesel engines}} involves the following: exhaust gas recirculation (EGR), and advanced combustion. Spark ignition engine development include: fuel injection, including the gasoline direct injection variant, as well as improving volumetric efficiency by using <b>multi-valves</b> per cylinder, variable valve timing, variable length intake manifolds, and turbocharging. Changes also include new fuel qualities (no sulphur or aromates) to allow new combustion concepts. So-called [...] "combined combustion systems" [...] (CCV) or [...] "diesotto" [...] cycles are based on synthetic fuels (synthetic diesel, biomass to liquid (BTL) or gas to liquid (GTL)).|$|R
50|$|In {{building}} services {{the water quality}} of various pumped fluid systems, including for heating, cooling, and condensate water, will be regularly checked and topped up with chemicals manually as required to suit the required water quality. Most commonly inhibitors {{will be added to}} protect the pipework and components against corrosion, or a biocide will be added to stop the growth of bacteria in lower temperature systems. The required chemicals will be added to the fluid system by use of a dosing pot; a <b>multi-valved</b> chamber in which the chemical can be added, and then introduced to the fluid system in a controlled manner.|$|R
40|$|International audienceElucidating cardiac {{evolution}} has been frustrated {{by lack of}} fossils. One celebrated enigma in cardiac evolution involves {{the transition from a}} cardiac outflow tract dominated by a <b>multi-valved</b> conus arteriosus in basal actinopterygians, to an outflow tract commanded by the non valved, elastic, bulbus arteriosus in higher actinopterygians. We demonstrate that cardiac preservation is possible in the extinct fish Rhacolepis buccalis from the Brazilian Cretaceous. Using X-ray synchrotron microtomography, we show that Rhacolepis fossils display hearts with a conus arteriosus containing at least five valve rows. This represents a transitional morphology between the primitive, multivalvar, conal condition and the derived, monovalvar, bulbar state of the outflow tract in modern actinopterygians. Our data rescue a long-lost cardiac phenotype (119 - 113 Ma) and suggest that outflow tract simplification in actinopterygians is compatible with a gradual, rather than a drastic saltation event. Overall, our results demonstrate the feasibility of studying cardiac evolution in fossil...|$|R
2500|$|The I-1430 {{featured}} cylinders with [...] "hemispherical" [...] {{combustion chambers}} and, like the 1936-designed Junkers Jumo 211 inverted V12 German aviation powerplant, using twin exhaust valves, with the I-1430 adding sodium-filled exhaust valves {{in its own}} <b>multi-valve</b> design. [...] Although it retained separate cylinders, the change to a V-layout allowed the individual cylinder heads to be cast as a single piece. Mounted at either end, a Y-shaped plate provided stiffness, while containing the camshaft drives. Continental built the first I-1430 engine in 1938 and successfully tested it in 1939. [...] At {{the time it was}} an extremely competitive design, offering at least [...] from a 23-liter displacement; the contemporary Rolls-Royce Merlin offered about [...] from 27l displacement, while the contemporary German competitor to the 35 litre displacement Junkers Jumo 211 engine, the Daimler-Benz DB 601 inverted V12, offered slightly more power at , but was much larger, at 33l displacement, with some 19,000 examples produced in its various versions.|$|E

50|$|<b>Multi-valve</b> engines {{continued}} to be popular in racing and sports engines. Robert M. Roof, the chief engineer for Laurel Motors, designed his <b>multi-valve</b> Roof Racing Overheads early in the 20th century. Type A 16-valve heads were successful in the teens, Type B was offered in 1918 and Type C 16-valve in 1923. Frank Lockhart drove a Type C overhead cam car to victory in Indiana in 1926.|$|E
5000|$|As {{a result}} of the use of this engine, the Dolomite Sprint has been claimed to be [...] "the world's first mass-{{produced}} <b>multi-valve</b> car". While other <b>multi-valve</b> engines (notably the Lotus 907) were produced in volume, they were not used in mass production vehicles until after the introduction of the Dolomite Sprint. The design of the cylinder head won a British Design Council award in 1974.|$|E
50|$|A <b>multi-valve</b> engine design {{typically}} has three, four, or five valves per cylinder {{to achieve}} improved performance. Any four-stroke {{internal combustion engine}} needs at least two valves per cylinder: one for intake of air and fuel, and another for exhaust of combustion gases. Adding more valves increases valve area and improves the flow of intake and exhaust gases, thereby enhancing combustion, volumetric efficiency, and power output. <b>Multi-valve</b> geometry allows the spark plug to be ideally located within the combustion chamber for optimal flame propagation. <b>Multi-valve</b> engines tend to have smaller valves that have lower reciprocating mass, which can reduce wear on each cam lobe, and allow more power from higher RPM without the danger of valve bounce. Some engines are designed to open each intake valve at a slightly different time, which increases turbulence, improving the mixing of air and fuel at low engine speeds. More valves also provide additional cooling to the cylinder head. The disadvantages of <b>multi-valve</b> engines are an increase in manufacturing cost and a potential increase in oil consumption due to the greater number of valve stem seals. Some SOHC <b>multi-valve</b> engines (such as the Mazda B8-ME) use a single fork-shaped rocker arm to drive two valves (generally the exhaust valves) so that fewer cam lobes will be {{needed in order to}} reduce manufacturing costs.|$|E

50|$|Bentley used <b>multi-valve</b> engines {{from the}} beginning. The Bentley 3 Litre, {{introduced}} in 1921, used a monobloc straight-4 with aluminium pistons, pent-roof combustion chambers, twin spark ignition, SOHC, and four valves per cylinder. It produced appr. 70 bhp (0.38 bhp per cubic inch). The 1927 Bentley 4½ Litre was of similar engine design. The NA racing model offered 130 bhp (0.48 bhp per cubic inch) and the 1929 supercharged 4½ Litre (Blower Bentley) reached 240 bhp (0.89 bhp per cubic inch). The 1926 Bentley 6½ Litre added two cylinders to the monobloc straight-4. This <b>multi-valve</b> straight-6 offered 180-200 bhp (0.45-0.50 bhp per cubic inch).
