5|$|In 2003, Wave Race 64 was {{released}} in China for the iQue Player console. A 1-hour demo of the game was also included with the console. On August 6, 2007, the game {{was released}} on the Wii's Virtual Console. Unlike the Nintendo 64 version, the Virtual Console release does not feature Kawasaki banners due to expired licensing deals. These were replaced by Wii and Nintendo DS advertisements. However, when the game was released on the Wii U's Virtual Console in 2016, the Kawasaki banners were restored. The Virtual Console versions of the game were generally very well received, with reviewers considering the game {{to be just as}} <b>much</b> <b>fun</b> <b>as</b> it was on the Nintendo 64.|$|E
25|$|Englishman Lord Hesketh, in {{partnership}} with Anthony 'Bubbles' Horsley as driver, entered various Formula Three events around Europe in 1972, with the mission objective simply to have as <b>much</b> <b>fun</b> <b>as</b> possible. Due partly Horsley's lack of experience, there were few results.|$|E
25|$|Lead {{singer and}} guitarist Mikey Heppner had formed the punk rock group the Dropouts {{in the early}} 2000s merely {{as a way of}} having fun {{performing}} at shows, but after all his bandmates left for New York City to perform as the successful rock band the Stills full-time, he had an epiphany that he could take his own music more seriously, achieve that kind of success, and still have as <b>much</b> <b>fun</b> <b>as</b> he hoped. This, coupled with his first exposure to Tricky Woo (which he enjoyed for their resemblance to Black Sabbath and Deep Purple), led him to re-establish the Dropouts with a different musical style - hard rock - and a more earnest pursuit of success.|$|E
5000|$|AllMusics James Christopher Monger {{praised the}} album as [...] "impressive stuff, {{and that it}} feels like {{the work of a}} much more {{seasoned}} crew of bandmates suggests that they had <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>fun</b> making it <b>as</b> the listener will have devouring it".|$|R
5000|$|Reviewer Allan Ulrich, {{writing for}} The San Francisco Examiner, {{declared}} that [...] "one could scarcely {{imagine a more}} energizing or enlightening introduction to Wagner's Der Ring des Nibelungen than Jon Else's 60-minute documentary". Oxford University Press called the film [...] "as <b>much</b> <b>fun</b> for opera-haters <b>as</b> for opera-lovers".|$|R
5000|$|Jiffy Pop has run {{television}} commercials dating {{back at least}} to 1967. In one commercial, a genie appears and gives two children Jiffy Pop to eat.

500|$|On {{the other}} hand, Mary Brennan of Film {{thought that the}} movie was [...] "A {{lot of fun to}} watch, and easy to {{surrender}} to in the moment." [...] Houston Chronicle editor Louis B. Parks said [...] "The film is a marvel, a well-photographed feast of visual imagery", while Richard Schickel of Time wrote that it was [...] "Less frightening, but as <b>much</b> <b>fun</b> <b>as</b> ever." [...] Washington Post contributor Desson Thomson felt it [...] "satisfactorily recycles the great surprises that made the first movie so powerful. And most significantly, it makes a big hoot of the whole business." ...|$|E
500|$|Deusner {{gave the}} album {{a rating of}} 7 out of 10, complimenting the release by adding that, [...] "Madonna is an ideal {{candidate}} for the tribute album treatment, having already inspired several {{in the past but}} none [...] quite as sturdy or as <b>much</b> <b>fun</b> <b>as</b> Through the Wilderness". However he felt that few of the songs were [...] "uninspired", like Drag's version of [...] "Oh Father" [...] and Bubonic Plague's rendition of Who's That Girl. Jon Caramanica from Spin also gave a positive review, saying that the album captures [...] "Madonna's vivacious side, but [...] desperate too". He particularly commended [...] "Crazy for You", saying that [...] "the last 30 seconds of [...] chilling—frontwoman Ariana Delawari and her traditional Afghan backing accelerate feverishly, breaking the sweat Madonna never quite did, or could".|$|E
5000|$|Lerner {{said this}} of Loewe:"There {{will never be}} another Fritz...

But I loved him more than I understood or misunderstood him and I know he loved me more than he understood or misunderstood me." ...|$|R
5000|$|Ashu {{has been}} praised by critics for his charismatic and {{communicative}} performance style. The Chicago Tribune {{stated that he}} [...] "possesses a deep musicality which pours through his playing and hooks the audience" [...] and the Dallas Morning News claimed [...] "he’s just <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>fun</b> to watch <b>as</b> to listen to." ...|$|R

500|$|Cybermats {{are shown}} {{for the first}} time in the revived series. In the classic series, they {{appeared}} in The Tomb of the Cybermen (1967), The Wheel in Space (1968), and Revenge of the Cybermen (1975). The Doctor examines a toy and remarks, [...] "Robot dog; not as <b>much</b> <b>fun</b> <b>as</b> I remember," [...] alluding to K-9, a robot dog who accompanied the Fourth Doctor. The Doctor claims to be able to [...] "speak 'baby'", as he did in [...] "A Good Man Goes to War". The Doctor expresses his dislike for Craig's [...] "redecorated" [...] house by using a line from the Second Doctor (Patrick Troughton) in The Three Doctors (1973) and The Five Doctors (1983). The Doctor recites the mini-poem [...] "Not a rat, a cybermat" [...] from the novelization of Revenge of the Cybermen.|$|E
500|$|The BBC {{described}} Whyte's {{music as}} [...] "a little difficult to handle" [...] {{but that the}} album [...] "shows {{just the right amount}} of restraint to prevent total disarray. Even if the album weren't half as <b>much</b> <b>fun</b> <b>as</b> it is, that feat would be worthy of celebration in itself." [...] Exclaim! noted that [...] "songs like [...] "Hover Traps," [...] "Death Mountain" [...] and [...] "All Nite" [...] are, at their core, extremely primitive. But it's in the way that Rustie builds, deconstructs and sequences his songs that allows Glass Swords to work its way into your psyche" [...] and that [...] "after a couple of listens, one may come to the conclusion that Rustie might just be a one-trick-pony. But, man, that one trick is perfect." [...] Mojo referred to the album as [...] "easy to admire but hard to love".|$|E
500|$|The {{muffled sound}} of the album's {{production}} has attracted criticism; Stevie Chick disparaged the lack of character in Ginn's bass-playing on [...] "My War" [...] {{when compared to the}} 1982 demo of the same song with Dukowski on bass. [...] Michael Azerrad praised the strength of the material while denigrating the [...] "frustrating lack of ensemble feel" [...] as the album was recorded without a full lineup. [...] Critic Clay Jarvis commended the album, emphasizing the risks taken on it and its influence, calling it [...] "more a test than an album", and saying, [...] "independent music is stronger because Black Flag formulated it". [...] John Dougan at AllMusic called the A-side of the album [...] "quite good", but described the B-side as [...] "self-indulgence masquerading as inspiration and about as <b>much</b> <b>fun</b> <b>as</b> wading through a tar pit". [...] Robert Christgau considered the B-side a [...] "waste".|$|E

5000|$|Critical {{response}} to the album has been generally favorable. Billboard stated Jordin brought [...] "a first effort that's all over the map—and works" [...] while sounding [...] "like exactly what she should be singing at this age and juncture in her career." [...] Entertainment Weekly gave the album a B+ saying her debut [...] "is <b>as</b> <b>much</b> effervescent <b>fun</b> <b>as</b> any post-Idol bow" [...] and added [...] "Idol has crowned winners with even bigger voices, but it hasn't given us one who's any easier on the ears." ...|$|R
5000|$|William W. Connors comments: [...] "There's so {{much detail}} and careful thought {{in every aspect}} of Dynasty League Baseball, it can only be {{described}} as a labor of love.

500|$|Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times {{wrote that}} [...] "Mars Attacks! is all 1990s cynicism and disbelief, mocking the {{conventions}} that Independence Day takes seriously. This all sounds clever enough but in truth, Mars Attacks! {{is not as}} <b>much</b> <b>fun</b> <b>as</b> it should be. Few of its numerous actors make a lasting impression and Burton's heart and soul {{is not in the}} humor". Desson Thomson from The Washington Post said [...] "Mars Attacks! evokes plenty of sci-fi classics, from The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951) to Dr. Strangelove (1964), but it doesn't do much beyond that superficial exercise. With the exception of Burton's jolting sight gags (I may never recover from the vision of Sarah Jessica Parker's head grafted on to the body of a chihuahua), the comedy is half-developed, pedestrian material. And the climactic battle between Earthlings and Martians is dull and overextended." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} critics. Gary Cole's return was highly praised, {{as well as}} the scene in which Sarah imitates the face Chuck makes when the Intersect has a [...] "flash". HitFix Senior Editor Alan Sepinwall wrote, [...] "Cole's return was as <b>much</b> <b>fun</b> <b>as</b> I hoped it would be - in some ways, even better than his first appearance in season two's 'Chuck vs. the Delorean,' where I liked Sarah and Jack's interaction but thought the actual con job was a bit thin. 'Chuck vs. the Wedding Planner' had its own flaw in the section where Sarah and Chuck are illegally using government resources to catch the con woman and wind up getting more government 'help' than they bargained for... But once Jack turned up in Burbank to help his daughter and her schnook of a fiance be heroes and get back in the good graces of General Beckman, 'Wedding Planner' was really very strong, both as a comedy piece (loved Yvonne Strahovski's accent as she impersonated Daphne) and another story about Sarah's colorful but ultimately sad past." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{her first}} appearance, Laura San Giacomo plays Harmony Chase, {{a woman who}} hires Keith to {{investigate}} her cheating husband. The two were both series regulars on the NBC sitcom Just Shoot Me!. The two actors had maintained a close friendship after their sitcom was cancelled, and when Rob Thomas brought up a romantic storyline for Keith to Colantoni, he suggested Giacomo for the role. Giacomo accepted the role, later stating, [...] "It {{was kind of a}} no-brainer situation for me. I love Rico, love working with him, and it was just as <b>much</b> <b>fun</b> <b>as</b> I thought it would be." [...] In addition to sharing in-jokes about Just Shoot Me! while on set, Colantoni also remembered what a good actress he thought she was in their earlier days. After the first appearance, both Colantoni and Giacomo lobbied for more storylines together. Thomas was open to the possibility, saying, [...] "I wouldn't hesitate to go back to this, because I was really happy with how it played out." [...] Giacomo would go on to appear on three episodes of the show.|$|E

500|$|Piliero had {{the concept}} nearly {{finished}} {{by the time}} he met with Spears. Both wanted to explore fun ways for Spears to be inappropriate in the video, who had several ideas, such as a cop frisking her. Having seen Spears on How I Met Your Mother and Saturday Night Live, Piliero felt that none of her videos had really taken advantage of her comedic timing, saying, [...] "She never had a music video where she could show her acting chops and have fun with comedy while being super badass. That was my goal from day one: I wanted her to be funny, badass and super cool.". During {{the first day of the}} shoot, he requested Spears to [...] "have as <b>much</b> <b>fun</b> <b>as</b> possible over these next two days". Pilliero also stated that the Crossroads (2002) reference [...] "s a fun Easter egg for fans. Plus, [...] is the most ridiculously awesome way to title a sequel. It just felt like the right thing to do. When Britney saw it, she loved it." ...|$|E
500|$|Several reviewers re-watched {{the episode}} {{after the end}} of the series. Keith DeCandido {{reviewed}} it on behalf of Tor.com, comparing it to [...] "The Naked Time" [...] and stating that [...] "there's nothing in this episode as entertaining as Sulu bare-chested with an epee, and Wesley being nerdy in the engine room is nowhere near as <b>much</b> <b>fun</b> <b>as</b> Riley singing." [...] He gave the episode a score of two out of ten, remarking that [...] "it's rarely a good idea to do an episode where everyone acts out of character as only the second one out of the gate, since we don't know enough about these people for their acting strange to be meaningful." [...] Cast member Wil Wheaton re-watched the episode for AOL TV, and summed it up saying [...] "whether it was the worst episode ever or not probably rested upon the viewer's expectations. Trekkies who were looking for reasons to hate The Next Generation found plenty" [...] while [...] "viewers who were willing to watch it with an open mind saw flashes of things they came to love watching," [...] and gave it a score of D+.|$|E
500|$|Not all reviewers {{gave the}} film {{positive}} reviews. New York magazine's David Edelstein claimed {{in his review}} to [...] "have no idea what {{so many people are}} raving about. It's as if someone went into their heads while they were sleeping and planted the idea that Inception is a visionary masterpiece and—hold on ... Whoa! I think I get it. The movie is a metaphor for the power of delusional hype—a metaphor for itself." [...] Rex Reed of The New York Observer explained the film's development as [...] "pretty much what we've come to expect from summer movies in general and Christopher Nolan movies in particular ... doesn't seem like much of an accomplishment to me." [...] A. O. Scott of The New York Times commented [...] "there is a lot to see in Inception, there is nothing that counts as genuine vision. Mr. Nolan's idea of the mind is too literal, too logical, and too rule-bound to allow the full measure of madness." [...] David Denby, writing in The New Yorker, considered the film not nearly as <b>much</b> <b>fun</b> <b>as</b> Nolan imagined it to be, concluding, [...] "Inception is a stunning-looking film that gets lost in fabulous intricacies, a movie devoted to its own workings and to little else." ...|$|E

5000|$|Game Informer's Andrew Reiner {{scored the}} game a 7.5 out of 10, enjoying the Lego {{adaptation}} of the DC Comics Universe, but disliking the excessive exploration and out-of-place celebrity cameos. He praised the overall sound, particularly liking the blend of powerful orchestral scores and TV show theme songs, but called the voice acting a [...] "mixed bag". Reiner also liked the gameplay tweaks, calling the item collecting process [...] "more rewarding" [...] and enjoying the suit transformation mechanic, {{even though it is}} sometimes tedious. [...] "The act of smashing Lego constructs and gathering studs hasn't changed since the first Lego game", Reiner said, [...] "and I gotta say, it's still just <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>fun</b> now <b>as</b> it was back in the day." ...|$|R

500|$|Bowyer {{appeared}} in Victory Lane {{to celebrate his}} first win {{of the season in}} front of 95,000 people who attended the race. Bowyer also earned $248,250 in race winnings. Stewart took his last-minute loss of the race with good humor, saying, [...] "We went down swinging. I think I ran me out of fuel." [...] In the subsequent post-race press conference, Hamlin said, [...] "First thing I asked is how many cars on the lead lap, because I wanted to see how bad our day was going to be. I set a goal (of) top 15, and then it was top eight and then top six and, 'Holy cow, we can win this thing.' We just made a heck of a charge at the end." [...] Bowyer was delighted with his victory: [...] " [...] Shane [...] built a brand new race car and we came here and we were fast right off the truck, and everybody had a lot of confidence, a pep in their step. And we showed it from the time we unloaded to qualifying, practice, we were one of the fastest cars here. That’s what it takes to run at this level, {{to be a part of}} that Chase, if we can go and continue to have as <b>much</b> <b>fun</b> <b>as</b> we did this weekend. I know it’s the key, I know it is to my success." ...|$|E

Robert Canning of IGN {{reviewed the}} episode, {{giving it a}} 7.4 out of 10 rating and opining the episode had [...] "a few audible chuckles and several silent smiles", and that the tone of it [...] "was just off." [...] He cited that the Liz and Jack characters on opposing sides [...] "was not as <b>much</b> <b>fun</b> <b>as</b> seeing them working together", and that Jenna and Tracy's antics throughout the series have been [...] "funny most of the time", though [...] "very little clicked in this episode." [...] Television columnist Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger said that the Tracy and Jenna team [...] "often seems too far {{out of the realm}} of reality... to enjoy them." [...] Sepinwall was positive about Cheyenne Jackson's debut, noting he [...] "fit in well his first time out." [...] Sean Gandert of Paste magazine called the episode the [...] "best so far in the season" [...] but admitted he was [...] "disappointed in it" [...] for not coming [...] "close to greatness and we all know [...] done it before and can do it again." [...] Gandert, who has not been a fan of Liz's [...] "Dealbreakers" [...] storyline, commented her plot here was [...] "somewhat annoying, generally not that interesting", and concluded [...] "it's hard to really care" [...] that Liz get her talk show.|$|E
500|$|Filming {{began in}} February 2011, and {{concluded}} {{in the late}} summer (from the Northern Hemisphere's perspective). Filming largely took place in South Africa, particularly in Cape Town, but also in Durban and Springbok, Northern Cape. Outside South Africa the series was also filmed in Budapest, Hungary, and the UK. Among the separate locations the series takes place in, the New Delhi hotel in the first two episodes were shot in Cape Town, and the suburbs of Hout Bay doubled as Mozambique. Throughout the shoot the actors were allowed to perform the majority of their own stunts. Military advisors were on hand to teach the actors how to perform certain stunts, and to tell them what they did wrong during the take. The series includes a number of sex scenes, many of which were performed by Stapleton. In an interview with the British newspaper Metro, the actor stated [...] "I've done my fair share of nude scenes in the past {{but not as much as}} this – not as risqué, anyway," [...] adding that while he got used to it, he was always [...] "a bit nervous running around in front of 50 people with no clothes on. The sex scenes were usually with an actress I'd just met, so it's like: 'How's it going? I'm Sullivan and this is me nude.' It's nerve-racking at first but you have as <b>much</b> <b>fun</b> <b>as</b> you can with it." ...|$|E

500|$|Among {{retrospective}} {{assessments of}} the song, Chip Madinger and Mark Easter, writing in their book on the former Beatles' solo careers, admire it as [...] "a hoedown stomper which was as country {{as any of the}} tracks on Beaucoups of Blues". Ian Inglis writes of [...] "Sunshine Life for Me": [...] "The result is a convincing piece of good-time folk-rock that would have been at home on Fairport Convention's groundbreaking album Liege & Lief, which was itself hugely influenced by the spirit of the Band's Music from Big Pink... he impression lingers that the track was <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>fun</b> to make <b>as</b> it is to hear." ...|$|R

But what we didn't know until tonight was how well those two things would go together. There are very few shows on television that can have <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>fun</b> with format <b>as</b> Supernatural, and tonight was another example — one of the best, in my opinion — of the great storytelling that {{can come out of}} such rule-bending.
