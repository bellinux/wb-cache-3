The stigmata are fuscous, <b>in</b> <b>males</b> distinct, <b>in</b> females very indistinct, the plical obliquely beyond the first discal, a similar dot close beneath the second discal.

50|$|The {{advertisement}} call, made by <b>males</b> <b>in</b> {{the breeding}} season, is a loud repetitive duck-like quacking.

5|$|The {{affected}} {{animals are}} mostly young Asian elephants {{that had been}} born in captivity, with half the cases in North America being between the ages of one and four years (and three-quarters between one and eight years old). Some cases have affected newborns or adult elephants born in the wild (oldest aged 40 years), and three recorded cases have affected African elephants. The first documented fatal case for African elephants was Kijana, an eleven-month-old <b>male</b> <b>in</b> 1996. Since 2008, a number of cases have been attributed to EEHV1 among wild Asian elephants.|$|E
5|$|The female has, on average, a {{narrower}} black back band, slightly duller upperparts and buffer underparts than the male. Her cap may be gray, but many females have black caps and cannot be reliably {{distinguished from the}} <b>male</b> <b>in</b> the field. In the northeastern United States, at least 10% of females have black caps, but the proportion rises to 40–80% in the Rocky Mountains, Mexico and the southeastern U.S. Juveniles {{are similar to the}} adult, but duller plumaged.|$|E

40|$|Abstract]: <b>Males</b> <b>in</b> nursing {{undoubtedly}} {{represent a}} minority group. However {{there have been}} relatively few studies which have investigated their unique experiences, compared with women <b>in</b> <b>male</b> dominated professions. This study conducted in an undergraduate nursing program, analysed the experience of <b>males</b> <b>in</b> nursing regarding (1) decision to enter the profession, during the course, both academic and clinical and (2) methods appropriate for recruiting more males to the profession. In general the results indicate overall positive acceptance of <b>males</b> <b>in</b> nursing, but several factors explored, indicate that change is essential if males are to remain and flourish in the profession. ...|$|R

5|$|The {{ring-tailed lemur}} is polygynandrous, {{although}} the dominant <b>male</b> <b>in</b> the troop typically breeds with more females than other males. Fighting is most common during the breeding season. A receptive female may initiate mating by presenting her backside, lifting her tail {{and looking at}} the desired male over her shoulder. Males may inspect the female's genitals to determine receptiveness. Females typically mate within their troop, but may seek outside males.|$|E
5|$|Today, four mounted skins of the bluebuck remain: {{the adult}} <b>male</b> <b>in</b> Leiden, a young female at the Zoological Museum of Stockholm, an adult female in the Vienna Museum of Natural History, and an adult <b>male</b> <b>in</b> the Museum of Natural History in Paris. A mounted skin was {{housed in the}} Zoological Museum in Uppsala until the 19th century, but now only the horns remain. There are also records of a skin in Haarlem, but its current {{whereabouts}} are unknown. Several of these skins {{have been identified in}} various 18th-century illustrations. A female skull is part of the collection at both the Hunterian Museum and the Zoological Museum of Amsterdam, though {{it has been suggested that}} the Hunterian's belongs to a sable antelope (H.niger). A pair of horns is present at both the Natural History Museum, London, and the South African Museum. Skeletal remains have been found in both archaeological and palaeontological contexts.|$|E
5|$|Wander's horse, Agro, plays a {{large role}} in the game. In {{addition}} to serving as a means of transportation, fighting from horseback is vital to defeat some of the colossi. There are, however, many environments that cannot be traversed by horse, and colossi often inhabit areas within deep water or beyond large obstacles that must be scaled. Agro cannot travel beyond these, and when separated from Wander by such obstacles, cannot participate in the following battle. Agro is referred to as a <b>male</b> <b>in</b> the English-language version of the game, though director Fumito Ueda said that he saw Wander's horse as female.|$|E

5|$|Adherents of Heathenry can {{be found}} in Europe, North America, and Australasia. They are mostly found in those areas with a Germanic {{cultural}} inheritance, although they are present in several other regions. In 2007, the religious studies scholar Graham Harvey stated {{that it was impossible to}} develop a precise figure for the number of Heathens across the world. A self-selected census in 2013 found 16,700 members in 98 countries, the bulk of whom lived in the United States. In 2016, Schnurbein stated that there were probably no more than 20,000 Heathens globally. She noted that, while there were some exceptions, most Heathen groups were 60–70% <b>male</b> <b>in</b> their composition.|$|E
5|$|An {{observational}} study by Logan {{demonstrates that the}} female is continuously {{evaluating the quality of}} the male and his territory. The assessment is usually triggered by the arrival of a new <b>male</b> <b>in</b> a neighboring territory {{at the beginning of a}} new breeding season. In those cases, the mated female is constantly seen flying over both the original and the new male’s territory, evaluating the qualities of both territories and exchanging calls with both males. The social mate displays aggressive behaviors towards the female, while the new male shows less aggression and sings softer songs. At the same time, both the mated male and the new male will fly over other territories to attract other females as well. Divorce, mate switching and extra-pair matings do occur in northern mockingbirds.|$|E
5|$|At the 12th Daytime Emmy Awards held in 1985, Brian Bloom was {{the first}} winner of this award for his {{portrayal}} of Dusty Donovan on As the World Turns. The awards ceremony had not been aired on television for the prior two years, having been criticized for voting integrity. The award category was originally called Outstanding Young Man or Outstanding Juvenile <b>Male</b> <b>in</b> a Drama Series, and began using its current title in 1991. Years before this category was introduced, networks declined to broadcast the show {{during a time of}} voting integrity rumors and waning interest. Confusion rose around the criteria of the new category due to the varying ages of the nominees. Within the first set of nominees, Bloom became the youngest actor nominated for a Daytime Emmy Award at the time at age 15, while the other actors nominated in the category were over 25. The criteria were later altered, requiring that the actor be aged 25 or below.|$|E
