40|$|Abstract Background A 5 -day {{fathead minnow}} (FHM) {{spawning}} assay {{is used by}} industry to monitor pulp <b>mill</b> effluent <b>quality,</b> with some <b>mill</b> effluents capable of completely inhibiting spawning. The purpose of this report is to characterize the effect of an inhibitory effluent on egg and milt production in FHM. Methods Eight tanks were treated with an inhibitory effluent while eight were kept with clean water. Each tank contained two males and four females as per the 5 -day FHM spawning assay used by industry. Females were stripped of ovulated eggs and males of milt in four effluent-exposed and four control tanks. Eggs oviposited in every tank were also counted and checked for fertilization and data analyzed with 2 -way ANOVA. Results We show that female, but not male, fathead minnow reproductive function is impaired in the 5 -day fathead minnow spawning assay used by industry to evaluate pulp <b>mill</b> effluent <b>quality</b> in Canada. Milt production was not changed in the control or exposed males mid-way {{and at the end}} of the five day exposure (p[*]>[*] 0. 05; n[*]=[*] 8). Total egg production (stripped[*]+[*]oviposited) was impaired (p[*]<[*] 0. 05) in fathead minnows exposed to effluent (288 eggs/tank, n[*]=[*] 4 tanks) compared to those in control tanks (753 eggs/tank, n[*]=[*] 4 tanks). Conclusions Our results indicate that males are able to detect female signals and prepare appropriately for spawning while in females inhibition of ovulation is occurring somewhere along the hypothalamus-pituitary-gonad reproductive axis.

Past analyses of high-temperature stress on rice production have focused on paddy yield and have failed {{to account for the}} detrimental impact of high temperatures on <b>milling</b> <b>quality</b> outcomes, which ultimately determine edible (marketable) rice yield and market value. Using genotype specific rice yield and <b>milling</b> <b>quality</b> data on six common rice varieties from Arkansas, USA, combined with on-site, half-hourly and daily temperature observations, we show a nonlinear effect of high-temperature stress exposure on yield and <b>milling</b> <b>quality.</b> A 1 °C increase in average growing season temperature reduces paddy yield by 6. 2 %, total milled rice yield by 7. 1 % to 8. 0 %, head rice yield by 9. 0 % to 13. 8 %, and total milling revenue by 8. 1 % to 11. 0 %, across genotypes. Our results indicate that failure to account for changes in <b>milling</b> <b>quality</b> leads to understatement of the impacts of high temperatures on rice production outcomes. These dramatic losses result from reduced paddy yield and increased percentages of chalky and broken kernels, which together decrease the quantity and market value of milled rice. Recently published estimates show paddy yield reductions of up to 10 % across the major rice-producing regions of South and Southeast Asia due to rising temperatures. The results of our study suggest that the often-cited 10 % figure underestimates the economic implications of climate change for rice producers, thus potentially threatening future food security for global rice producers and consumers...|$|E
40|$|Harvest {{moisture}} contents (HMCs) {{have been}} proven {{to play a role}} in rice quality, especially affecting head rice yield (HRY) due to fissuring or immature kernels. Differences in milling characteristics between samples having high and low level <b>milling</b> <b>quality</b> were studied in this experiment. Two hybrid, long-grain cultivars (CL XL 729 and CL XL 745) and two pureline, long-grain cultivars (CL 181 and Wells) were harvested at near optimal and low HMCs, representing high and low <b>milling</b> <b>quality,</b> respectively.

Low quality rice also reached a given surface lipid content (SLC) at a faster rate as supported by greater SLC reduction rates.

40|$|Although {{the wheat}} grain {{comprises}} 82 - 86 % starchy endosperm, only approximately 76 - 78 % {{is able to}} be separated using current milling technology. Suitability for primary processing depends on three main characteristics that are in turn influenced to varying degrees by the genetic origin of wheat and agro-climatic conditions during plant development: the endosperm to bran ratio, kernel hardness and ease of separation of bran and endosperm. Among these, hardness {{appears to be an}} essential factor in wheat milling behavior also important to the food processing industries. Accumulated evidence supports the prominent influence of the puroindoline (pin) proteins on grain hardness though additional factors influence <b>milling</b> <b>quality.</b> The general aim of this project was to increase the understanding of grain characteristics in hard wheat varieties that influence flour yield. The first research question involved the validation of the rheological information derived from the Single Kernel Characterisation System (SKCS) as the most suitable indicator of <b>milling</b> <b>quality</b> for small sample quantities. The methodologies initially involved correlation of fragment/particle size distribution of conditioned and unconditioned hard wheat varieties produced by first break rolls and the SKCS. The use of the SKCS for studies in <b>milling</b> <b>quality</b> was validated (Chapter 4). This was followed by a process relating qualitative observations gained from light microscopy, conventional and environmental electron microscopy with the crush response profiles produced by the SKCS. This study generated an hypothesis involving starch granule size distribution (SGSD) which was tested by correlating quantitative data produced by a laser diffraction technique with small scale milling and SKCS data. SGSD has generally been disregarded as having a significant influence on hardness or <b>milling</b> <b>quality</b> with much investigative effort instead directed towards the puroindolines. However the results presented indicate the contrary with significant correlations with hardness and flour yield across a range of hard varieties. This is partially a reflection of positive relationships between bonding area and cohesion within composite materials (Chapter 5). Finally, standard DNA sequencing methods were used to screen puroindoline sequence variation in 120 varieties from the Australian Winter Cereal Collection harvested and milled from two different environments. Further SGSD analysis indicated significant correlations with flour yield though differing between pin genotypes. In addition quantitative analysis of starch granule-bound puroindoline using a micro-capillary electrophoresis method (Lab-on-chip) demonstrated a significant negative correlation with flour yield in the premium <b>milling</b> <b>quality</b> varieties with pin genotype, Pina-D 1 a, Pinb-D 1 b (Chapter 6). Several alternative influences on <b>milling</b> <b>quality</b> such as lipid content, cell wall characteristics, the regulation of the hardness locus (Ha) and function of the grain softness proteins require further investigation. Also as expected results suggested that seed weight itself has a significant influence on flour yield...|$|E
