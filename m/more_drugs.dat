There are several possible explanations for this gap between evidence and clinical practice. One major factor may be the lack of adequately trained dietitians, who are needed to administer a ketogenic diet programme.|$|E

5|$|Lethal {{injection}} is {{the practice}} of injecting one or <b>more</b> <b>drugs</b> into a person by a government {{for the express purpose}} of causing immediate death. While Nazi Germany was known to execute enemies of the state using an injection of lethal drugs, the first country to legalize and formally implement what is referred to today as lethal injection was the United States. The state of Texas adopted it as its form on capital punishment in 1977 and executed the first person by it, Charles Brooks Jr., in 1982. The practice was subsequently adopted by the other U.S. states using capital punishment. As of 2017, the method is being used by 31 U.S. states, as well as by their federal government and military.|$|E

Tanya's daughter, Abi Branning (Lorna Fitzgerald), wants Rainie to stay and Max agrees. She steals money out of Max's sister Carol Jackson's (Lindsey Coulson) purse, which she uses to buy crack cocaine. Max catches her with the drugs and throws her out. She starts looking for her drugs where a drunken Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden) approaches, finds Rainie's crack cocaine and is tempted to try some after she says it helps her block out her memories. Phil and Rainie get high at Phil's home. Rainie goes to get <b>more</b> <b>drugs</b> when Phil steals money from The Queen Victoria public house, but is mugged by a drug dealer.

5|$|Fenmore was befriended by Carmine Basco (Marco Dapper), the {{man whom}} Lauren {{was having an}} affair with, while also trying to win over Summer again, who was {{crushing}} on Kyle Abbott (Hartley Sawyer). Fenmore asked Summer to their senior prom, and instead of going, Summer threw a party at her mother's penthouse. During a game of truth or dare, Fenmore was dared to kiss Summer, who had text messaged Kyle that she was in trouble. Kyle later punched Fenmore in the face; footage was caught on video and uploaded online, weakening Fenmore's social status. Afterward, he is befriended by Raven (Amanda Leighton); they go to a graduation party, do drugs and talk about their social struggles. When Fenmore discovers Carmine's affair with his mother, he isolates himself from his family and continues to do drugs. Afterward, he asks Carmine to help him obtain <b>more</b> <b>drugs,</b> and while he refuses, he finds Fenmore unconscious {{in the back of the}} local restaurant. When he awakens in the hospital, he tells his parents that Carmine gave him the drugs that he overdosed on, but he later confesses that this was a lie. After stealing drugs from the hospital and getting caught, Michael and Lauren send Fenmore to rehab. After being released for an event in which Lauren would be crowned businesswoman of the year, Carmine is shot to death in an alleyway. Fenmore is convinced he murdered Carmine but admits to being high on drugs at the time and can't remember clearly. Michael decides to confess to the murder to protect his family, and he is sent to prison. Knowing that his father did not kill Carmine, Fenmore steals drugs and purposely gets caught so he can be put in prison as well. While in prison, Fenmore tries to make deals with other prisoners to get his father's sentence reduced, as Paul Williams (Doug Davidson) and Christine Blair (Lauralee Bell) try to uncover the truth behind Carmine's death. Michael is later released after Fen confesses to killing Carmine, worrying his parents.|$|E

25|$|A {{large area}} of {{interest}} in nanomedicine is the transdermal patch because {{of the possibility of}} a painless application of therapeutic agents with very few side effects.

25|$|In recent years, drug {{companies}} {{have worked together}} to combine these complex regimens into simpler formulas, termed fixed-dose combinations. For instance, there are now several options that combine 3 or 4 drugs into one pill taken once daily. This greatly increases {{the ease with which}} they can be taken, which in turn increases the consistency with which medication is taken (adherence), and thus their effectiveness over the long-term. Not taking anti-retrovirals regularly is a cause of resistance development in people who have started taking them previously. Patients who take medications regularly can stay on one regimen without developing resistance. This greatly increases life expectancy and leaves <b>more</b> <b>drugs</b> available to the individual should the need arise.|$|E
25|$|Vandenbroucke made {{headlines}} in 1999 {{for the first}} of many drug problems, arrested by Paris police but then released. In 2001 he was stopped on the E17 motorway in Belgium in a speeding car shared with Bernard Sainz, the so-called Dr Mabuse of cycling. Sainz was jailed in 2008 for falsely practising medicine. Sainz could not produce the insurance documents the law insisted he carry and police searched the car and found drugs later identified as clenbuterol, morphine and EPO, which is used in sport as a blood-booster. Sainz insisted they were homeopathic products. After Sainz said he had spent the night at Vandenbroucke's house, police acquired a search warrant from a court in Termonde and searched Vandenbroucke's house with drugs specialists. There they found small quantities of <b>more</b> <b>drugs</b> which Vandenbroucke claimed were for his dog. Vandenbroucke was handcuffed and taken to a police station. Two and a half thousand fans signed a petition complaining about his treatment. Among them was his rival, Peter van Petegem.

40|$|Introduction: Proven {{resistance}} against HIV drugs, either by phenotyping or genotyping {{is a rare}} event in clinical trials. The overall assumption of drug resistance disappearing is additionally driven by the recommendations to screen for transmitted drug resistance, leading to large numbers of examinations with relatively low rates of resistance. Goal of our analysis was to assess if drug resistance in treatment failure is also decreasing outside of clinical trials. Materials and Methods: The MIB database at timepoint of analysis consists of data from 2876 HIV infected patients. Besides various laboratory parameters, clinical data and treatment history is included. HIV- 1 protease and reverse transcriptase sequences were analyzed using the HIV-GRADE drug resistance algorithm. As in {{only a small number}} of patients genotypic resistance testing for integrase inhibitors was performed, mainly due to reimbursement reasons, it was assumed that failing treatment on a previous integrase inhibitor containing regimen is equate to resistance. Results: Of the 2876 patients in the database, 220 had a treatment change due to treatment failure between 2009 and 2012, a genotypic resistance testing at an appropriate timepoint of maximum four weeks before treatment change and a treatment duration of at least six months before treatment failure. In 2009, 61 % of patients showed no drug resistance while 39 % showed {{resistance against}} one or <b>more</b> <b>drug</b> classes (two or <b>more</b> <b>drug</b> classes: 19. 5 %; three or <b>more</b> <b>drug</b> classes: 2. 4 %, four drug classes 2. 4 %). In 2012, no resistance was found in 52 % of patients while resistance against three or <b>more</b> <b>drug</b> classes was found in nearly 14 % of patients (one or more: 48 %; two or more 23 %; four classes: 4. 5 %). Conclusions: Treatment failure with viral load sufficiently high for drug resistance testing was not frequently observed in our database. Nevertheless, treatment failure was often associated with drug resistance against at least one <b>drug</b> class. With <b>more</b> use of the newer drug classes, resistance against those new classes will become more common and rates of multiclass resistance will be increasing...|$|R
