40|$|CMOS image sensors (CIS) are {{promising}} candidates {{as part of}} optical imagers for the plasma diagnostics devoted {{to the study of}} fusion by inertial confinement. However, the harsh radiative environment of <b>Megajoule</b> Class <b>Lasers</b> threatens the performances of these optical sensors. In this paper, the vulnerability of CIS to the transient and mixed pulsed radiation environment associated with such facilities is investigated during an experiment at the OMEGA facility at the Laboratory for Laser Energetics (LLE), Rochester, NY, USA. The transient and permanent effects of the 14 MeV neutron pulse on CIS are presented. The behavior of the tested CIS shows that active pixel sensors (APS) exhibit a better hardness to this harsh environment than a CCD. A first order extrapolation of the reported results to the higher level of radiation expected for <b>Megajoule</b> Class <b>Laser</b> facilities (<b>Laser</b> <b>Megajoule</b> in France or National Ignition Facility in the USA) shows that temporarily saturated pixels due to transient neutron-induced single event effects will be the major issue for the development of radiation-tolerant plasma diagnostic instruments whereas the permanent degradation of the CIS related to displacement damage or total ionizing dose effects could be reduced by applying well known mitigation techniques...|$|R

The final optic assembly of these systems, operating at 351 nm is made of large fused silica optics working in transmission. When submitted to laser at the wavelength of 351 nm, fused silica optics can exhibit damage, induced by the high amount of energy traversing the part. The created damage is a set of micro-chips that appear on the optic surface. Current researches have shown that this damage could be initiated on pre-existing sub-surface damages created during the optics manufacturing process. It is then very important to understand, for various set of manufacturing parameters, what are the key parameters for sub-surface damage. The presented work details the development of a simplified model to investigate the polishing process. Both silica (the material to be polished) and the abrasive particles are modeled using a discrete element approach. This numerical tool allows following the evolution of micro-cracks inside the material during the abrasion process.

Modeling calculations are likely to be an important component of this effort. Some work in this area has been performed by French workers, who are collaborating with the LLNL on many issues relating to target chamber, experiment-component, and diagnostics survival. Experiments have been performed at the PhCbus laser in France to measure shrapnel produced by laser-driven targets; among these shots were experiments that accelerated spheres of a size characteristic of some of the more damaging shrapnel. These spheres were stopped in polyethylene witness plates. The penetration depth is characteristic of the velocity of the shrapnel. Experimental calibration of steel sphere penetration into polyethylene was performed at the CESTA facility. The penetration depth has been reported (ref. 1) and comparisons with modeling calculations have been made (ref. 2). There was interest in a comparison study of the modeling of these experiments to provide independent checks of the calculations.

These phase variations lead to beam steering which may affect frequency conversion as well as energy-on-target.

40|$|Thomson {{scattering}} {{has been}} developed at the Nova laser facility as a direct and accurate diagnostic to characterize inertial confinement fusion plasmas. Flat disks coated with thin multilayers of gold and beryllium were with one laser beam to produce a two ion species plasma with a controlled amount of both species. Thomson scattering spectra from these plasmas showed two ion acoustic waves belonging to gold and beryllium. The phase velocities of the ion acoustic waves are {{shown to be a}} sensitive function of the relative concentrations of the two ion species and are in good agreement with theoretical calculations. These open geometry experiments further show that an accurate measurement of the ion temperature can be derived from the relative damping of the two ion acoustic waves. Subsequent Thomson scattering measurements from methane-filled, ignition-relevant hohlraums apply the theory for two ion species plasmas to obtain the electron and ion temperatures with high accuracy. The experimental data provide a benchmark for two-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations using LASNEX, which is presently in use to predict the performance of future <b>megajoule</b> <b>laser</b> driven hohlraums of the National Ignition Facility (NIF). The data are consistent with modeling using significantly inhibited heat transport {{at the peak of the}} drive. Applied to NIF targets, this flux limitation has little effect on x- ray production. The spatial distribution of x-rays is slightly modified but optimal symmetry can be re-established by small changes in power balance or pointing. Furthermore, we find that stagnating plasma regions on the hohlraum axis are well described by the calculations. This result implies that stagnation in gas-filled hohlraums occurs too late to directly affect the capsule implosion in ignition experiments...|$|E

We studied the major mechanisms governing the amplitude of this degradation, focusing our discussion on the transient radiation-induced attenuation (RIA) phenomena that is often the limiting factor for LMJ applications. The amplitude and growth and decay kinetics of RIA are affected by different parameters related to the fibers themselves but also depend on the application and irradiation characteristics. We particularly investigated the fiber transient radiation responses when the optical links have to operate during the pulsed and mixed environment associated with ignition shots.
