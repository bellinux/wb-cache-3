40|$|Hepatocellular {{carcinoma}} (HCC) is {{a well-known}} consequence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection mainly in cirrhotic patients. Associations of other <b>malignancies</b> such as cholangiocellular carcinoma and B-cell <b>malignancies</b> with HCV are less well known. Here we review pathophysiological aspects of <b>malignancies</b> associated with HCV infection. A case report of HCV-related HCC and B-cell lymphoma illustrates the increased risk for HCV-infected patients to develop other <b>malignancies</b> besides HC...|$|R
40|$|In rare instances, {{patients}} may {{be diagnosed with}} two different primary <b>malignancies.</b> Though such synchronous <b>malignancies</b> have been documented in sporadic case reports, {{the overwhelming majority of}} <b>malignancies</b> involving multiple organs can be attributed to a primary source. Papillary thyroid carcinoma and lung adenocarcinoma are rarely diagnosed within the same year. Our case report presents a patient who was diagnosed with these two <b>malignancies</b> during her same hospital visit. Biopsies results proved that the two <b>malignancies</b> were in fact separate entities and not a consequence of metastasis from a primary source...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{number of}} {{patients}} with second <b>malignancies</b> is growing and they represent about one in six out of all new cancers. Second <b>malignancies</b> can be categorized into three major groups according to the predominant etiological factor(s) : (i) treatment-related, (ii) part of a syndrome and (iii) those due to shared etiologic exposures. Patients and Methods: This article focuses on radiation-induced <b>malignancies</b> with illustrative cases of thyroid, rectal cancer and sarcoma. Results: The detection and management of radiation-induced <b>malignancies</b> of some case scenarios are presented. Second <b>malignancies</b> are detected within previous radiation field and the time intervals from previous tumor vary from 8 to 21 years. Conclusion: Clinicians should aim to reduce radiation-induced <b>malignancies</b> by careful selection of patients and radiation techniques before radiotherapy. Subsequent vigilant followup and investigations can detect these radiation-induced <b>malignancies</b> early and, hence, result in successful treatment...|$|R

5|$|Hsp90 is {{exploited}} by cancer cells to support activated oncoproteins, including many kinases and transcription factors. These clients are often mutated, amplified or translocated in <b>malignancy,</b> and Hsp90 works to buffer these cellular stresses induced by malignant transformation. Inhibition of Hsp90 {{leads to the}} degradation or instability of many of its client proteins. Thus, Hsp90 has become an attractive target for cancer therapy.|$|E
5|$|Some viruses cause no {{apparent}} {{changes to the}} infected cell. Cells in which the virus is latent and inactive show few signs of infection and often function normally. This causes persistent infections and the virus is often dormant for many months or years. This {{is often the case}} with herpes viruses. Some viruses, such as Epstein–Barr virus, can cause cells to proliferate without causing <b>malignancy,</b> while others, such as papillomaviruses, are established causes of cancer.|$|E
5|$|Lambert–Eaton myasthenic {{syndrome}} (LEMS) {{is a rare}} autoimmune disorder {{characterized by}} muscle weakness of the limbs. It {{is the result of}} an autoimmune reaction in which antibodies are formed against presynaptic voltage-gated calcium channels, and likely other nerve terminal proteins, in the neuromuscular junction (the connection between nerves and the muscle that they supply). The prevalence is 3.4 cases per million. Around 60% of those with LEMS have an underlying <b>malignancy,</b> most commonly small-cell lung cancer; it is therefore regarded as a paraneoplastic syndrome (a condition that arises as a result of cancer elsewhere in the body).|$|E

40|$|Introduction. LeFort colpocleisis (LFC) is a {{safe and}} {{effective}} obliterative surgical option for older women with advanced pelvic organ prolapse who no longer desire coital activity.

We present the first case of endometrioid ovarian cancer diagnosed after LFC and review all reported gynecologic <b>malignancies</b> post-LFC in the English medical literature. Results. This is the second reported ovarian cancer post-LFC and {{the first of the}} endometrioid subtype. A total of nine other gynecologic <b>malignancies</b> post-LFC {{have been reported in the}} English medical literature. Conclusions. Gynecologic <b>malignancies</b> post-LFC are rare.

25|$|When melanomas {{have spread}} to the lymph nodes, {{one of the most}} {{important}} factors is the number of nodes with <b>malignancy.</b> Extent of <b>malignancy</b> within a node is also important; micrometastases in which <b>malignancy</b> is only microscopic have a more favorable prognosis than macrometastases. In some cases micrometastases may only be detected by special staining, and if <b>malignancy</b> is only detectable by a rarely employed test known as the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), the prognosis is better. Macrometastases in which <b>malignancy</b> is clinically apparent (in some cases cancer completely replaces a node) have a far worse prognosis, and if nodes are matted or if there is extracapsular extension, the prognosis is worse still. In addition to these variables, expression levels and copy number variations of a number of relevant genes may be used to support assessment of malignant melanoma prognosis.|$|E

40|$|Multiple primary {{malignant}} neoplasms are {{two or more}} <b>malignancies</b> in an individual without any relationship between the tumors. Multiple primary <b>malignancies</b> are relatively rare but have increased in recent decades. Two cancers are commonly observed among those with multiple primary <b>malignancies,</b> but two <b>malignancies</b> of stomach and liver are relatively rare to be reported. Mechanisms of the tumors were unclear; we described a patient who had stomach carcinoma presenting with a synchronous liver cancer and investigated his family history; we suggest that family history may be a key risk factor and early detection for additional primary <b>malignancies</b> should be needed for patients who had specific cancer history in their pedigree. Early diagnosis {{may be the key}} risk factor affecting prognosis...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Recent {{studies have}} {{addressed}} the prevalence and prognostic impact of thrombocytosis in various gynecologic and non-gynecologic <b>malignancies.</b> Thrombocytosis appears to be of prognostic value in certain patients with gynecologic <b>malignancies.</b> In this survey we review the published data and attempt to analyze the prognostic implications of thrombocytosis in patients with gynecologic <b>malignancies.</b> The association between thrombocytosis and <b>malignancies</b> was first described over 100 years ago (1). Recent studies {{have addressed the}} prevalence and prognostic impact of thrombocytosis in various gynecologic and non-gynecologic <b>malignancies</b> (2 - 8).

25|$|Certain benign liver tumors, such as {{hepatocellular}} adenoma, {{may sometimes}} {{be associated with}} coexisting malignant HCC. There is limited evidence for the true incidence of <b>malignancy</b> associated with benign adenomas; however, the size of hepatic adenoma is considered to correspond to risk of <b>malignancy</b> and so larger tumors may be surgically removed.
