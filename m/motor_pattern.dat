50|$|Because the mockingbird has {{the ability}} to mimic the songs of other species, it has been useful in {{determining}} whether the vocal motor patterns employed by particular species in producing their unique song types are constrained by acoustic properties or whether the unique song types may also be produced by different motor patterns generated by the same songbird vocal system. When juvenile mockingbirds were tutored with the recorded or synthesized song of a cardinal or cowbird, the mockingbirds employed the same respiratory and lateralized vocal pattern as the original species to produce its mimicked song. When the mockingbird <b>motor</b> <b>pattern</b> differed from the tutor <b>motor</b> <b>pattern,</b> the song output also differed, suggesting that the vocal <b>motor</b> <b>pattern</b> is largely determined by the acoustic restraints of the song type. Even though the mockingbird was able to mimic the FM sweeps of cardinals by employing the same motor pattern—switching mid-syllable from right syrinx to left syrinx—the mockingbird did not perform the transition seamlessly. This indicates that precise unilateral control of song production in the syrinx of certain birds, such as cardinals, has allowed them to become unique vocal specialists.|$|E
5000|$|Additionally, {{the effect}} of the sensory input varies {{depending}} on the phase of the pattern in which it occurs. For example, during walking, resistance {{to the top of the}} swinging foot (e.g., by a horizontal stick) causes the foot to be lifted higher to move over the stick. However, the same input to the standing foot cannot cause the foot to lift or the person would collapse. Thus, depending on the phase, the same sensory input can cause the foot to be lifted higher or held more firmly to the ground.

40|$|Muscular {{strength}} and power generating ability decline with advancing age. Older adults adapt their lower limb <b>motor</b> <b>patterns</b> {{to cope with}} these declines in muscle function. When mechanical demands approach limits of lower limb muscular capacity, <b>motor</b> <b>patterns</b> must be adapted to produce a desired movement. The term “motor pattern” is used to broadly represent the kinematic and kinetic profile of a person accomplishing a given task. Generally, these adaptations involve higher reliance on stronger proximal muscles to compensate for limitations or weakness of distal muscles. Three studies were conducted to examine factors affecting differences between older and young adults in lower extremity mechanics for walking and cycling. In the first two studies, the effects of physical activity status, walking speed, and step length on lower extremity <b>motor</b> <b>patterns</b> of older and young adults were examined. As walking speed and step length increased, lower extremity muscular effort, as reflected by joint moments and power, increased. Differences in <b>motor</b> <b>patterns</b> between older and young participants, were preserved for multiple speed and step length conditions. In general, older adults showed higher reliance on hip musculature to compensate for lower muscle strength of plantarflexors. Moreover, sedentary and older groups, who had lower leg strength, exhibited similar lower limb <b>motor</b> <b>patterns</b> during walking. Likewise, physically active and young participants, who had higher lower extremity strength, displayed similar lower limb <b>motor</b> <b>patterns.</b> Consistent with the 2008 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans, {{these results suggest that}} adopting and maintaining a physically active life-style can help maintain walking abilities in older adults. When cycling at a submaximal intensities, both older and young participants showed higher reliance on muscles about the knee and had higher rates of energy cost for higher power outputs and cadences. Older adults had higher rates of energy cost and higher co-activation of thigh antagonistic muscles during cycling than young adults.

50|$|From infancy, {{the only}} oral <b>motor</b> <b>pattern</b> {{appreciated}} is suck-swallow-breathe. This reflexive way of eating allows infants to feed from birth (from a breast or bottle) while protecting their airway and meeting their nutritional needs (Case-Smith & Humphry, in Case-Smith, 2005). The oral motor patterns required for eating and swallowing solids include tongue lateralization, tongue elevation, and munching/chewing, {{and unlike the}} suck-swallow-breathe sequence, coordination of these oral motor patterns is learned, not reflexive (Morris & Dunn Klein, 2000). When an infant is offered a spoon of puree, the practiced or familiar oral <b>motor</b> <b>pattern</b> is sucking. As purees are thicker than formula or breastmilk, puree is sucked off of a presented spoon and moved in the mouth {{in a similar fashion}} as liquid.

Conversely, current research supports that early negative experiences with eating leads to poor food acceptance in later years (Courtland, Harris, & Emmett,2009). Through playful exploration, BLW provides an opportunity for infants to practice new oral motor patterns. Through this method, infants gradually develop the oral motor patterns required for mature bolus manipulation, chewing, and swallowing, as well as allow the infant to be in charge of what goes in their mouth, how it goes in, and when.

The phase relationships between these oscillators are established by the emergent properties of the oscillators and the coupling between them. [...] Forward swimming can by accomplished by a series of coupled oscillators in which the anterior oscillators have a shorter endogenous frequency than the posterior oscillators.

40|$|The {{efficacy}} of any animal signal is {{constrained by the}} range over which it remains above the sensory threshold of potential receivers. The spatial area in which reliable detection occurs defines active space; this is influenced by signal structure, the signalling environment and the sensory characteristics of receivers. Identification of the factors influencing active space has provided valuable insights into signal design, particularly in bioacoustics, in which signal distortion and degradation can be easily quantified. In the present study, we consider whether active space can similarly help to explain {{the design of a}} movement-based visual signal. The Jacky dragon (Amphibolurus muricatus) threat display is composed of five distinct <b>motor</b> <b>patterns</b> delivered in an obligatory sequence: tail-flicks, backward and forward foreleg waves, a push-up and a 'body-rock'. In contrast to other communication systems, the introductory element is characterized by reduced intensity (average speed) but greater duration than subsequent <b>motor</b> <b>patterns.</b> Furthermore, the tail-flick sweeps a three-dimensional (3 D) space around the lizard, whereas the <b>motor</b> <b>patterns</b> that follow are largely restricted to a single plane. Structural properties thus suggest that the active space of the tail-flick might be greater than that of the other <b>motor</b> <b>patterns</b> in the display, which would provide a parsimonious explanation for its use as an alerting component. We tested this prediction in a playback experiment incorporating 3 D animations of lizard displays, comparing response probabilities to the factorial combination of three <b>motor</b> <b>patterns,</b> three viewing angles and three distances. Results suggest that the tail-flick does not have a greater active space than other display <b>motor</b> <b>patterns,</b> but that each degrades predictably with distance, thereby providing potential ranging cues. In addition, display components are remarkably robust to variation in receiver orientation, so that efficacy should be maximized in most potential signalling situations. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that duration is the principal determinant of signal efficacy in this system. 8 page(s...|$|R

50|$|In rabbits, nest {{building}} occurs {{towards the}} last third of pregnancy. The mother digs and builds a nest of straw and grass, which she lines with hair plucked from her body. This sequential <b>motor</b> <b>pattern</b> is produced by changes in estradiol, progesterone, and prolactin levels. Six to eight days pre-partum, high levels of estradiol and progesterone lead to a peak in digging behavior. Both estradiol and progesterone are produced and released by the ovaries. One to three days pre-partum, straw-carrying behavior is expressed as a function of decreasing progesterone levels, maintenance of high estradiol levels, and increasing prolactin levels. This release of prolactin (from the anterior pituitary) is likely caused by the increase in estrogen-to-progesterone ratio. One day pre-partum to four days post-partum, hair loosening and plucking occur as a result of low progesterone and high prolactin levels, together with a decrease in testosterone. In house mice and golden hamsters, nest-building takes place earlier, at the start or middle of pregnancy. For these species, nest-building coincides with high levels of estrogen and progestin.|$|E

The level of detail gained in this work was claimed to be unique in that it allowed changes in behaviour to be related to changes occurring at the cellular and network level, such that the cellular basis of locomotion, steering and posture is understood in this biological model system. Given the issues and difficulties of linking cellular effects to behaviour, these claims are unique. However, the claims lack the necessary experimental support, even for the simplest aspect, the organisation of the locomotor network output, where connections that are incorporated into models have not been identified in the actual system. The gaps in the proposed network organisation necessarily weaken any claims to understanding the cellular mechanisms of behaviour (see Parker 2006, 2010).|$|E

Results: Study of the pan-colonic spatiotemporal organization of <b>motor</b> <b>patterns</b> revealed: fluid-induced or spontaneous rhythmic propulsive long distance contractions (LDCs, 0. 4 – 1. 5 /min, involving the whole colon), rhythmic propulsive motor complexes (RPMCs) (0. 8 – 2. 5 /min, dominant in distal colon), ripples (10 – 14 /min, dominant in proximal colon), segmentation and retrograde contractions (0. 1 – 0. 8 /min, prominent in distal and mid colon).

With these inputs intact, in control saline, the <b>motor</b> <b>patterns</b> {{produced by}} the stomatogastric nervous system of embryonic and larval lobsters are slower and less regular than those of adult lobsters. We studied {{the effects of the}} hormonal modulator, crustacean cardioac-tive peptide (CCAP) on the discharge <b>patterns</b> of STG <b>motor</b> <b>patterns</b> in embryos, larvae, and adult Maine lobsters, Homarus americanus, with the anterior inputs present and absent. In adults, CCAP initiated robust pyloric rhythms from STGs isolated from their descend-ing control and modulatory inputs. Likewise, CCAP initiated robust activity in isolated embryonic and larval STGs. Nonetheless, quantitative analyses revealed that the frequency and regularity of the STG motor neuron discharge seen in the presence of CCAP in isolated STGs from embryos were significantly lower than those seen late in larval life and in adults under the same condi-tions. In contrast, when the descending control and mod-ulatory pathways to the STG were left intact, the em-bryonic and larval burst frequency seen in the presence of CCAP was increased by CCAP, whereas the burst frequency in adults was decreased by CCAP, so that in CCAP the frequencies at all stages were statistically indistinguishable.

The interdigestive antral cumulative motility index, computed for 30 minutes before the appearance of duodenal activity fronts, {{and the number of}} activity fronts with an antral component were significantly less in patients with ulcers and those with non-ulcer dyspepsia compared with asymptomatic controls. The patient groups also had a reduced antral motor response to a solid-liquid test meal compared with healthy controls. Intestinal motor abnormalities (bursts of non-propagated phasic pressure activity and discrete clustered contractions) were recorded in a minority of patients, all with associated irritable bowel symptoms. In conclusion, antral hypomotility is a frequent but nonspecific motor abnormality in dyspepsia; abnormal <b>motor</b> <b>patterns</b> of the small bowel are less frequent and seem to be confined to patients with concomitant irritable bowel syndrome...|$|R

Our knowledge of how CPG networks generate <b>motor</b> <b>patterns</b> in complex nervous systems remains incomplete, despite decades of work in a variety of model organisms. Substrate borne locomotion in Drosophila larvae is driven by waves of muscular contraction that propagate through multiple body segments. We use the motor circuitry underlying crawling in larval Drosophila as a model to try to understand how segmentally coordinated rhythmic <b>motor</b> <b>patterns</b> are generated. Whereas muscles, motoneurons and sensory neurons have been well investigated in this system, far less is known about the identities and function of interneurons. Our recent study identified a class of glutamatergic premotor interneurons, PMSIs (period-positive median segmental inter-neurons), that regulate the speed of locomotion. Here, we report on the identification of a distinct class of glutamatergic premotor interneurons called Glutamatergic Ventro-Lateral Interneurons (GVLIs). We used calcium imaging to search for interneurons that show rhyth-mic activity and identified GVLIs as interneurons showing wave-like activity during peristal...|$|R
50|$|Acquiring <b>motor</b> <b>patterns</b> is {{the most}} primal {{learning}} process in animal development - in evolution and maturation. The primacy of the learning process {{led to the development}} of instincts. The primary instinct in any encounter with a new environment of forces is to overcome and adjust in order to achieve results. In the process of adjustment - learning of new <b>motor</b> <b>patterns</b> is gradually achieved.Adaptation is sometimes viewed as a process in which the nervous system learns to predict and cancel effects of a novel environment, returning movements to near baseline (unperturbed) conditions. During motor adaptation the nervous system constantly uses error information to improve future movements.|$|R
