5000|$|The <b>magnetomotive</b> {{force can}} often be quickly {{calculated}} using Ampère's law. For example, the <b>magnetomotive</b> force [...] of long coil is: ...|$|E
5000|$|... and [...] {{represent}} the <b>magnetomotive</b> force (complex effective amplitude) ...|$|E
50|$|The unit of <b>magnetomotive</b> {{force is}} the {{ampere-turn}} (At), {{represented by a}} steady, direct electric current of one ampere flowing in a single-turn loop of electrically conducting material in a vacuum. The gilbert (Gb), established by the IEC in 1930, is the CGS unit of <b>magnetomotive</b> force and is a slightly smaller unit than the ampere-turn. The unit is named after William Gilbert (1544-1603) English physician and natural philosopher.|$|E
5000|$|Similar to the {{way that}} {{electromotive}} force (EMF) drives a current of electrical charge in electrical circuits, <b>magnetomotive</b> force (MMF) 'drives' magnetic flux through magnetic circuits. The term 'magnetomotive force', though, is a misnomer since {{it is not a}} force nor is anything moving. It is perhaps better to call it simply MMF. In analogy to the definition of EMF, the <b>magnetomotive</b> force [...] around a closed loop is defined as: ...|$|E
5000|$|For the AlNiCo magnet we can {{calculate}} the <b>magnetomotive</b> force (MMF), the reluctance [...] and the magnetic flow over that magnet as: ...|$|E
5000|$|... using Hopkinson's law (magnetic circuit {{analogue}} of Ohm's law {{for electric}} circuits) and {{the definition of}} <b>magnetomotive</b> force (magnetic analogue of electromotive force): ...|$|E
5000|$|Because oersteds {{are used}} to measure {{magnetizing}} field strength, they are also related to the <b>magnetomotive</b> force (mmf) of current in a single-winding wire-loop: ...|$|E
5000|$|For the NdFeB magnet we can {{calculate}} the <b>magnetomotive</b> force (MMF), the reluctance [...] and the magnetic flow over that magnet {{in the same}} way: ...|$|E
50|$|Variable {{air gaps}} {{can be created}} in the cores by a movable keeper to create a flux switch that alters the amount of {{magnetic}} flux in a magnetic circuit without varying the constant <b>magnetomotive</b> force in that circuit.|$|E
5000|$|In physics, the <b>magnetomotive</b> {{force is}} a {{quantity}} {{appearing in the}} equation for the magnetic flux in a magnetic circuit, sometimes known as Hopkinson's law. It is the property of certain substances or phenomena {{that give rise to}} magnetic fields: ...|$|E
5000|$|... where [...] is the {{magnetic}} flux in the circuit, [...] is the <b>magnetomotive</b> force {{applied to the}} circuit, and [...] is the reluctance of the circuit. Here the reluctance [...] is a quantity similar in nature to resistance for the flux.|$|E
5000|$|This is a {{nonlinear}} equation, {{because the}} permeability of the core, μ, {{varies with the}} magnetic field B. For an exact solution, the value of μ at the B value used must {{be obtained from the}} core material hysteresis curve. [...] If B is unknown, the equation must be solved by numerical methods. However, if the <b>magnetomotive</b> force is well above saturation, so the core material is in saturation, the magnetic field will be approximately the saturation value Bsat for the material, and won't vary much with changes in NI. For a closed magnetic circuit (no air gap) most core materials saturate at a <b>magnetomotive</b> force of roughly 800 ampere-turns per meter of flux path.|$|E
5000|$|A first {{approximation}} is {{an ideal}} transformer model as presented in the two images. [...] An ideal transformer is a theoretical, linear transformer that is lossless and perfectly coupled. Perfect coupling implies infinitely high core magnetic permeability and winding inductances and zero net <b>magnetomotive</b> force.|$|E
5000|$|The {{ampere-turn}} (At) is the MKS (Metres, Kilograms, Seconds) unit of <b>magnetomotive</b> force (MMF), {{represented by}} a direct current of one ampere flowing in a single-turn loop in a vacuum. [...] "Turns" [...] refers to the winding number of an electrical conductor comprising an inductor.|$|E
5000|$|Magnetic complex {{reluctance}} (SI Unit: H−1) is {{a measurement}} of a passive magnetic circuit (or element within that circuit) dependent on sinusoidal <b>magnetomotive</b> force (SI Unit: At·Wb−1) and sinusoidal magnetic flux (SI Unit: T·m2), {{and this is}} determined by deriving the ratio of their complex effective amplitudes.1-3 ...|$|E
5000|$|... where Φ is the {{magnetic}} flux and R is {{the reluctance of}} the circuit. It {{can be seen that}} the <b>magnetomotive</b> force plays a role in this equation analogous to the voltage V in Ohm's law: V = IR, since it is the cause of magnetic flux in a magnetic circuit: ...|$|E
50|$|All fluxes (e.g. {{magnetic}} flux, electric flux, vortex flux) make {{reference to}} a surface (S), all variables expressed by a line integral (e.g. electromotive force, velocity circulation, <b>magnetomotive</b> force) {{make reference to}} a line (L) and all contents (e.g. of energy, mass, entropy, etc.) make reference to a volume (V). Lastly all potentials (e.g. electric potential, velocity potential, temperature) make reference to a point (P).|$|E
5000|$|The {{magnetic}} field created by an electromagnet {{is proportional to}} both the number of turns in the winding, N, and the current in the wire, I, hence this product, NI, in ampere-turns, is given the name <b>magnetomotive</b> force. For an electromagnet with a single magnetic circuit, of which length Lcore of the {{magnetic field}} path is in the core material and length Lgap is in air gaps, Ampere's Law reduces to: ...|$|E
50|$|While {{today he}} is {{generally}} referred to as William Gilbert, he also went {{under the name of}} William Gilberd. The latter was used in both his and his father's epitaphs, in the records of the town of Colchester, in the Biographical Memoir that appears in De Magnete, and in the name of The Gilberd School in Colchester. A unit of <b>magnetomotive</b> force, also known as magnetic potential, was named the Gilbert in his honour.|$|E
5000|$|For most core materials, [...] [...] So in {{equation}} (1) above, {{the second}} term dominates. Therefore, in magnetic circuits with an air gap, {{the strength of the}} magnetic field B depends strongly on the length of the air gap, and the length of the flux path in the core doesn't matter much. Given an air gap of 1mm, a <b>magnetomotive</b> force of about 796 Ampere-turns is required to produce a magnetic field of 1T.|$|E
50|$|In a {{magnetic}} circuit, magnetic inductance (inductive magnetic reactance) is the analogy to inductance in an electrical circuit. Magnetic inductance {{is a concept}} in the gyrator-capacitor model for magnetic systems.In the SI system, it is measured in units of -Ω−1. This model makes <b>magnetomotive</b> force (mmf) the analog of electromotive force in electrical circuits, and time rate of change of magnetic flux the analog of electric current. The gyrator-capacitor model is a lumped-element model for analysis of magnetic fields.|$|E
5000|$|... where [...] is the <b>magnetomotive</b> force (MMF) {{across a}} {{magnetic}} element, [...] is the magnetic flux through the magnetic element, and [...] is the magnetic reluctance of that element. (It {{will be shown}} later that this relationship {{is due to the}} empirical relationship between the H-field and the magnetic field B, B=μH, where μ is the permeability of the material). Like Ohms law, Hopkinsons law can be interpreted either as an empirical equation that works for some materials, or it may serve as a definition of reluctance.|$|E
50|$|A common {{analogy of}} {{magnetic}} circuits maps <b>magnetomotive</b> force (mmf) to voltage and magnetic flux (φ) to electrical current. However, mmf and φ are not power conjugate variables. The product {{of these is}} not in units {{of power and the}} ratio, known as magnetic reluctance, does not measure the rate of dissipation of energy so is not a true impedance. Where a compatible analogy is required, mmf can be used as the effort variable and dφ/dt (rate of change of magnetic flux) will then be the flow variable. This is known as the gyrator-capacitor model.|$|E
50|$|PM {{machines}} have {{permanent magnets}} in the rotor which {{set up a}} magnetic field. The <b>magnetomotive</b> force in a PM (caused by orbiting electrons with aligned spin) is generally much higher than what is possible in a copper coil. The copper coil can, however, be filled with a ferromagnetic material, which gives the coil much lower magnetic reluctance. Still the magnetic field created by modern PMs (Neodymium magnets) is stronger, which means that PM machines have a better torque/volume and torque/weight ratio than machines with rotor coils under continuous operation. This may change with introduction of superconductors in rotor.|$|E
5000|$|Magnetic {{circuits}} can {{be solved}} for the flux in each branch by application of the magnetic equivalent of Kirchhoff's Voltage Law (KVL) for pure source/resistance circuits. Specifically, whereas KVL states that the voltage excitation applied to a loop {{is equal to the}} sum of the voltage drops (resistance times current) around the loop, the magnetic analogue states that the <b>magnetomotive</b> force (achieved from ampere-turn excitation) is equal to the sum of MMF drops (product of flux and reluctance) across the rest of the loop. (If there are multiple loops, the current in each branch {{can be solved}} through a matrix equation—much as a matrix solution for mesh circuit branch currents is obtained in loop analysis—after which the individual branch currents are obtained by adding and/or subtracting the constituent loop currents as indicated by the adopted sign convention and loop orientations.) Per Ampère's law, the excitation is the product of the current and the number of complete loops made and is measured in ampere-turns. Stated more generally: ...|$|E
50|$|A {{variety of}} heaters {{can be used}} for zone melting, with their most {{important}} characteristic being the ability to form short molten zones that move slowly and uniformly through the ingot. Induction coils, ring-wound resistance heaters, or gas flames are common methods. Another method is to pass an electric current directly through the ingot while it is in a magnetic field, with the resulting <b>magnetomotive</b> force carefully set to be just equal to the weight in order to hold the liquid suspended. Optical heaters using high powered halogen or xenon lamps are used extensively in research facilities particularly for the production of insulators, but their use in industry is limited by the relatively low power of the lamps, which limits the size of crystals produced by this method. Zone melting can be done as a batch process, or it can be done continuously, with fresh impure material being continually added at one end and purer material being removed from the other, with impure zone melt being removed at whatever rate is dictated by the impurity of the feed stock.|$|E
50|$|The primary design {{factors of}} a high {{efficiency}} glandless circulating pump include an electronically commutated synchronous motor, a permanent magnet rotor, and canned rotor technology. An electronically commutated synchronous motor is used to convert the energy current from a DC energy source into an AC current which is supplied to the drive motor. It utilizes the <b>magnetomotive</b> force which is generated by surface currents placed on the surfaces of the stator and rotor and the permanent magnets to generate the electric current which is in output to the drive motor. The canned rotor technology {{eliminates the need for}} a shaft seal that many conventional pumps must use through its unique design. Whereas standard pumps with shaft seals have multiple chambers with different rotating parts in each, canned rotor technology allows all of the rotating parts within the pump to exist in a single chamber. This increases the overall efficiency since the liquid used to lubricate the shaft bearings is also used to cool the motor. The electronic components of the motor are attached outside this system by means of an encapsulated motor cartridge, which is an independent metal compartment used solely for housing the electronic components.|$|E
50|$|The Magnicon, {{developed}} by Macfarlane's in Scotland, {{is similar to}} the Metadyne, but whereas the latter has a two-pole armature winding, the Magnicon has a four-pole lap winding, and is sometimes referred to a Metadyne with a short-pitched armature winding. They have been supplied to operate hoists and winches on ships. The stator of a Magnicon has four polar projections, spaced at 90 degrees, and one pair of them is excited. The pair of brushes which are on the same axis as the excited poles are short-circuited, resulting in a large current. The <b>magnetomotive</b> force (MMF) of this current acts on the non-excited poles, creating a working flux (Φ) and the output voltage. As with a full-pitch Metadyne, the armature reaction of the output current is 90 degrees out of phase, and therefore opposes the original excitation. Advantages over the normal Metadyne are that the number of exciting and compensating coils is halved to two each per cycle, and the shorter pitch of the coils results in less overhang at the ends of the windings. However, the design creates idle currents in the armature, which result in losses, and on larger machines, where interpoles are required, each interpole must be fitted with two coils, one for each of the brush circuits. Tustin argues that there is little advantage of the Magnicon over the Metadyne for smaller machines, and for larger machines, which require interpoles to be fitted, insufficient analysis has been carried out to make a judgement.|$|E
30|$|To {{choose a}} {{reasonable}} mode of three-phase winding {{for the improvement}} of the operating efficiency of cascaded linear induction motor, the time and space characteristics of <b>magnetomotive</b> force were investigated. The ideal model of the cascaded linear induction motor was built, in which the B and C-phase windings are respectively separated from the A-phase winding by a distance of d and e slots pitch and not overlapped. By changing the values of d and e from 1 to 5, we can obtain 20 different modes of three-phase winding with the different combinations of d and e. Then, the air-gap <b>magnetomotive</b> forces of A-, B-, and C-phase windings were calculated by the <b>magnetomotive</b> force theory. According to the transient superposition of <b>magnetomotive</b> forces of A-, B-, and C-phase windings, the theoretical and simulated synthetic fundamental <b>magnetomotive</b> forces under 20 different arrangement modes were obtained. The results show that the synthetic <b>magnetomotive</b> force with d =  2 and e =  4 is close to forward sinusoidal traveling wave and the synthetic <b>magnetomotive</b> force with d =  4 and e =  2 is close to backward sinusoidal traveling wave, and their amplitudes and wave velocities are approximately constant and equal. In both cases, the motor could work normally with a high efficiency, but under other 18 arrangement modes (d =  1, e =  2; d =  1, e =  3; d =  1, e =  4;…), the synthetic <b>magnetomotive</b> force presents obvious pulse vibration and moves with variable velocity, which means that the motor did not work normally and had high energy loss.|$|E

40|$|In this thesis, a {{catheter}} design is proposed for endoscopic <b>magnetomotive</b> {{optical coherence tomography}} (MM-OCT). <b>Magnetomotive</b> optical coherence tomography is a novel technique which uses targeted magnetic contrast agents for contrast enhancement of OCT imaging. In MM-OCT, microspheres and magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) are introduced into tissue and an electromagnet is used to generate a small modulated magnetic field within the tissue during OCT imaging. The magnetic field will introduce mechanical displacement of the MNPs, which can be detected, and the MM-OCT signal can be measured. The current bench-top set-up {{does not allow for}} in vivo MM-OCT imaging because the magnetic field is provide by a solenoid with an outer diameter of ~ 18 mm and an axial thickness of ~ 9 mm. A <b>magnetomotive</b> catheter design was developed by wrapping small coil around the distal end of a standard OCT catheter to combine the novel MM-OCT technology and catheter-based OCT. The coil has a small size while providing a local magnetic field for MM-OCT imaging.

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a {{reliable}} and robust method for <b>magnetomotive</b> optical coherence tomography (MM-OCT) imaging of single cells labeled with iron oxide particles. This method employs modulated longitudinal and transverse magnetic fields to evoke alignment and rotation of anisotropic magnetic structures in the sample volume. Experimental evidence suggests that magnetic particles assemble themselves in elongated chains when exposed to a permanent magnetic field. Magnetomotion in the intracellular space was detected and visualized by means of 3 D OCT as well as laser speckle reflectometry as a 2 D reference imaging method. Our experiments on mesenchymal stem cells embedded in agar scaffolds show that the <b>magnetomotive</b> signal in rotational MM-OCT is significantly increased {{by a factor of}} ~ 3 compared to previous pulsed MM-OCT, although the solenoid’s power consumption was 16 times lower. Finally, we use our novel method to image ARPE- 19 cells, a human retinal pigment epithelium cell line.
