25|$|Rivers {{had already}} formed {{a career in}} {{physiology}} and psychology. But now he moved more definitively into anthropology. He wanted a demographically small, fairly isolated people, comparable to the island societies of the Torres Strait, where he <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> genealogical data on each and every individual. The Todas in the Nilgiri Hills of Southern India, with their population then about 700 plus, suited Rivers’s criteria. And they had speciﬁc features of social organization, such as polyandrous marriage and a bifurcation of their society into so-called moieties that had interested historical evolutionists. Whether his fieldwork was initially so single-minded is questionable, however, since at first he looked at other local communities and studied their visual perception before fixing all his attention on the Todas.|$|E
2500|$|... §182 StGB {{contains}} numerous terms without precise, clear legal definitions; {{critics have}} raised concerns that families can misuse this law to criminalize socially disapproved sexual relationships (e.g., {{a family that}} disapproved of a young person's homosexual relationship <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> that person's partner prosecuted). In Austria an analogous situation exists: like the German §175 StGB, the Austrian §209 StGB was stricken from the legal code; like the German §182 StGB, the Austrian §207b StGB is perceived by critics as having potential to be abused as a surrogate for the stricken law.|$|E
2500|$|If {{our society}} were {{to follow in}} the {{footsteps}} of other countries who allow paid time off for taking care of sick children or even for having children our country <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> rid of the welfare program. Mothers wouldn’t need welfare because they could have a job and be able to take care of children. Employers would have to allow parents to leave work to take care of children and they would have to pay them for it as well. [...] When the parent is still getting a paycheck there would be no need for welfare programs to supplement another income or for a lack of income.|$|E

2500|$|It {{has long}} been {{recognized}} that the huge supply of agricultural cellulose, the lignocellulosic material {{commonly referred to as}} [...] "Nature's polymer", would be an ideal source of material for biofuels and many other products. Composed of lignin and monomer sugars such as glucose, fructose, arabinose, galactose, and xylose, these constituents are very valuable in their own right. To this point in history, there are some methods commonly used to coax [...] "recalcitrant" [...] cellulose to separate or hydrolyse into its lignin and sugar parts, treatment with; steam explosion, supercritical water, enzymes, acids and alkalines. All these methods involve heat or chemicals, are expensive, have lower conversion rates and produce waste materials. In recent years the rise of [...] "mechanochemistry" [...] has resulted in the use of ball mills and other mill designs to reduce cellulose to a fine powder {{in the presence of a}} catalyst, a common bentonite or kaolinite clay, that will hydrolyse the cellulose quickly and with low energy input into pure sugar and lignin. Still currently only in pilot stage, this promising technology offers the possibility that any agricultural economy <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> rid of its requirement to refine oil for transportation fuels. This would be a major improvement in carbon neutral energy sources and allow the continued use of internal combustion engines on a large scale.|$|E
2500|$|Papen {{hoped to}} be reappointed by Hindenburg, fully expecting that the aging {{president}} would find Hitler's demands unacceptable. [...] Indeed, when Schleicher suggested on 1 December that he <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> support from the Nazis, Hindenburg blanched and told Papen to try to form another government. Papen told his cabinet {{that he planned to}} pursue his [...] "fighting programme" [...] for constitutional and economic reforms even at the risk of civil war, and to circumvent the problem of a hostile Reichstag, which could pass a motion of no-confidence in his government or cancel his laws issued under Article 48, by having martial law declared, which would allow him to rule as a dictator. However, at a cabinet meeting the next day, Papen was informed {{that there was no way}} to maintain order against the Nazis and Communists as Schleicher's associate General Eugen Ott presented the results of a war games study to the cabinet showing the Reichswehr could not handle the various paramilitary groups if martial law were declared. As Ott was one of Schleicher's closest associates, Papen suspected the war games study had been rigged to suggest that martial law was not an option, an impression reinforced to historians by the fact that a month later in January 1933, Schleicher was to tell Hindenburg that the Reichswehr could easily defeat all of the paramilitary groups if martial law were declared. Realizing that Schleicher was deliberately trying to undercut him, Papen asked Hindenburg to fire Schleicher as defence minister.|$|E
