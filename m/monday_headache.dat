60|$|The {{next morning}} Mrs. Forsyth was paying for her Sunday tea with a <b>Monday</b> <b>headache,</b> and more things must be got {{out for the}} country. Charlotte had again {{no choice but to}} go alone to the storage, and yet again no choice but to be {{pleasant}} to Peter when she found him next door listing the contents of his mother's trunks and tagging them as before. He dropped his work and wanted to help her. Suddenly they seemed strangely well acquainted, and he pretended to be asked which pieces she should put aside as goods selected, and chose them for her. She hinted that he was shirking his own work; he said it was an all-summer's job, but he knew her mother was in a hurry. He found the little old trunk of her playthings, and got it down and opened it and took out some toys as goods selected. She made him put them back, but first he catalogued everything in it and synopsized the list on a tag and tagged the trunk. He begged for a broken doll which he had not listed, and Charlotte had so much of her original childish difficulty in parting with that instead of something else that she refused it.|$|E
