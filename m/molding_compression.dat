Quiescent, non-isothermal crys- tallization kinetics of two polypropylene resins were investigated using a new method, based on fast cooling of thin samples with air/water sprays and optical detection of the crystallization phenomenon. The range of cooling rates attained in this experimental study is considerably larger than that achieved by traditional methods. Quiescent crystal- lization kinetics of the resins is also investigated by the means of DSC, operated under isothermal conditions with a limited degree of under-cooling and for constant cooling rates up to about 1 K s 1.

The purpose of this master thesis is to evaluate the possibility and feasibility of redesigning a high volume metal chassis part in composite materials.   To accomplish this the thesis work was divided into two parts. The first part consists of a composite study which explores the available composite technologies in the industry such as implemented chassis components and available manufacturing methods. The composite study shows that almost no high volume chassis component in the market are made out of composites, with exception to leaf springs. In the industry {{there are many different}} composite manufacturing methods but in general the most ready for high volume production are Injection <b>molding,</b> <b>compression</b> molding and RTM. A method was also explored to efficiently evaluate different material and manufacturing methods against each other. By knowing the critical requirement both materials and manufacturing methods can be evaluated separately against each other. The second part consists of a design phase where the knowledge from the composite study was used to choose and redesign a chassis component in composite. A motor mount was chosen and redesigned using injection molding. The new design shows that a weight decrease of at least 38 % is possible without significant cost differences. ...|$|E

With future iteration, and more focus on design for loading, the process could yield parts which could carry much higher loads. In addition, the use of chopped fiber around the bearings regions was a success, ultimately showing that a combination of chopped and cloth fiber was a useful load carrying combination.
