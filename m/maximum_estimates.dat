In the absence of personal dosimetry badges, the study authors relied on measurements of sodium activation in the victims' blood and urine samples as their primary source of data. This activation would have been caused by neutron radiation, but they converted all doses to equivalent doses of gamma or X-ray radiation. They concluded that Daghlian and Slotin had probably received doses equivalent to 290 and 880 rem (respectively) of gamma rays. Minimum and <b>maximum</b> <b>estimates</b> varied from about 50% to 200% of these values. The authors also calculated doses equivalent to a mix of soft 80keV X-rays and gamma rays, which they believed gave a more realistic picture of the exposure than the gamma equivalent. In this model the equivalent X-ray doses were much higher, but would be concentrated in the tissues facing the source, whereas the gamma component penetrated the whole body. Slotin's equivalent dose was estimated to be 1930R (roentgen) of X-ray with 114R of gamma, while Daghlian's equivalent dose was estimated to be 480R of X-ray with 110R of gamma.

40|$|An {{important}} drawback of {{the electron}} microprobe is its inability to quantify Fe 3 +/Fe 2 + ratios in routine work. Although these ratios can be calculated, there is no unique criterion {{that can be applied}} to all amphiboles. Using a large data set of calcic, sodic-calcic, and sodic amphibole analysis from A-type granites and syenites from southern Brazil, weassess the choices made by the method of Schumacher (1997, Canadian Mineralogist, 35 : 238 - 246), which uses the average between selected maximum and minimum estimates. <b>Maximum</b> <b>estimates</b> selected most frequently are: 13 cations excluding Ca, Na, and K (13 eCNK - 66 %); sum of Si and Al equal to 8 (8 SiAl - 17 %); 15 cations excluding K (15 eK - 8 %). These selections are appropriate based on crystallochemical considerations. Minimum estimates are mostly all iron as Fe 2 + (all Fe 2 - 71 %), and are clearly inadequate. Hence, <b>maximum</b> <b>estimates</b> should better approximate the actual values. To test this, complete analyses were selected from the literature, and calculated and measured values were compared. 13 eCNK and <b>maximum</b> <b>estimates</b> are precise and accurate (concordance correlation coefficient- r c " 0. 85).
