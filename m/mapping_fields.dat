The evaluation data include more than 60, 000, 000 subscribers, {{together with their}} services. The subscribers used 3000 services and all the subscribers’ activities were considered in the evaluation. The mobile operator needs accurate information about their customers’ favourites {{to be able to}} provide appropriate VAS suggestions. Due to the high volume of information, existing association rule algorithms would {{take a long time to}} execute and, therefore, are not suitable. In this evaluation, high-dimensional data items were used. If all the combinations of rules were applied, 23000 [*]−[*] 1 <b>mapping</b> <b>fields</b> would have to be added to each rule that is generated in the rule generation layer. Such a large number of rules is neither necessary nor calculable. Based on additional information obtained about the services, a maximum of ten services is required for recommending VAS. Thus, rules with a maximum length of ten must be generated.|$|E

40|$|There {{are many}} {{attempts}} at map’s content explanation. We show one more attempt for expounded its content by semiological point of view. The map’s content is divided in three groups: <b>Map’s</b> <b>field</b> is {{a mathematical model}} of the represented part of the reality. It has some properties: a scale; plane and elevation co-ordinate systems; a surface of reference; a cartographic projection; physic sizes. It is shown that positional reference frame, contours, and co-ordinate lines are components of the <b>map’s</b> <b>field.</b> <b>Map’s</b> <b>field</b> is strictly determined by a) frame on the map or b) by map’s object boundaries. Internal components are cartographical signs that represent definite objects from reality. They are situated on the <b>map’s</b> <b>field</b> and they get their own specific location. This location connects the sings with their objects. The internal components have been received properties from <b>map’s</b> <b>field,</b> specially its scale and co-ordinate systems. Out of the field the internal components are geometrical shapes, pictograms, images and so on. When they are positioned on the <b>map’s</b> <b>field</b> on a specific location, they get field’s properties and become cartographical signs.

They are sign vehicles, written or graphical, {{but they are not}} cartographic signs because they are not connected to the <b>map’s</b> <b>field.</b> Different kind of maps can have various external components, but most important internal components are the legend of the map, map title, contour interval specification and scale representation. A map to be usable it must consist at least one element of each component. <b>Map’s</b> <b>field,</b> some cartographical signs and at least one of external components are necessary to create a simple map.

40|$|An {{accuracy}} {{digital map}} must satisfy the users for two main requirements, first, map must be visually readable and second, all the map elements {{must be in}} a good representation. These two requirements hold especially true for map generalization which aims at simplifying the representation of cartographic data. Different scales of maps are very important for any decision in any maps with different scales such as master plan and all the infrastructures maps in civil engineering. Cartographer cannot project the data onto a piece of paper, {{but he has to}} worry about its readability. The map layout of any geodatabase is very important, this layout is help to read, analyze or extract information from the map. There are many principles and guidelines of generalization that can be find in the cartographic literature. A manual reduction method for generalization depends on experience of map maker and therefore produces incompatible results.

This study presents integration methods to increase the level of automation in building recognition and reconstruction. Aerial imagery {{has been used as}} a major source in <b>mapping</b> <b>fields</b> and, in recent years, LIDAR data became popular as another type of mapping re-source. Regarding their performances, aerial imagery has the ability to delineate object boundaries but omits much of these boundaries during feature extraction. LI-DAR data provide direct information about heights of object surfaces but have limi-tations with respect to boundary localization. Efficient methods to generate building boundary hypotheses and localize object features are described. Such methods use complementary characteristics of two sensors. Graph data structures are used for interpreting surface discontinuities. Buildings are recognized by analyzing contour graphs and modeled with surface patches from LIDAR data. Building model hy-potheses are generated as a combination of wing models and are verified by assessing the consistency between corresponding data sets. Experiments using aerial imagery and LIDAR data are presented. Three findings are noted: First, building boundaries are successfully recognized using the proposed contour analysis method. Second, the wing model and hypothesized contours increase the level of automation in building ii hypothesis generation/verification. Third, the integration of aerial images and LI-DAR data enhances the accuracy of reconstructed buildings in the horizontal and vertical directions. iii Dedicated to my parents and my wife, Jae-Eun i...|$|E
40|$|Automated generalization, rooted from {{conventional}} cartography, {{has become an}} increasing concern in both geographic information system (GIS) and <b>mapping</b> <b>fields.</b> All geographic phenomenon and the processes are bound to the scale, as {{it is impossible for}} human being to observe the Earth and the processes in it without decreasing its scale. To get optimal results, cartographers and map-making agencies develop set of rules and constraints, however these rules are under consideration and topic for many researches up until recent days. Reducing map generating time and giving objectivity is possible by developing automated map generalization algorithms (McMaster and Shea, 1988). Modification of the scale traditionally is a manual process, which requires knowledge of the expert cartographer, and it depends on the experience of the user, which makes the process very subjective as every user may generate different map with same requirements. However, automating generalization based on the cartographic rules and constrains can give consistent result. Also, developing automated system for map generation is the demand of this rapid changing world. The research that we have conveyed considers only generalization of the roads, as {{it is one of the}} indispensable parts of a map. Dehradun city, Uttarakhand state of India was selected as a study area. The study carried out comparative study of the generalization software sets, operations and algorithms available currently, also considers advantages and drawbacks of the existing software used worldwide. Research concludes with the development of road network generalization tool and with the final generalized road map of the study area, which explores the use of open source python programming language and attempts to compare different road network generalization algorithms. Thus, the paper discusses the alternative solutions for automated generalization of linear objects using GIS-technologies.

40|$|Use of non-sprayed buffer zones is {{a widely}} used method to protect {{sensitive}} objects within or adjacent to fields treated with pesticides. These buffer zones should protect the objects from pesticide residues caused by spray drift and leakage. The use of untreated buffer zones has been mandatory for Swedish farmers since 1997. E. g. recommended minimum safe distances to sensitive areas for spray situations are 12 m to wells, 6 m to streams, ponds or lakes, and 1 m to ditches and drainage wells. Studies have shown that buffer zones are not always respected {{and that there is}} a need to improve the protection of sensitive objects. On a typical sprayer, all nozzles on a section of the boom are either on or off. A higher resolution in sprayer control would reduce the untreated area but still be able to respect the buffer zones. German and Dutch research have shown how GNSS-controlled (Global Navigation Satellite System) application of pesticides can be targeted to defined areas in the field. GIS (Geographic Information System) was used to define the areas to be sprayed. The objectives of this study were to develop and evaluate a system that automatically could shut off single nozzles along the spray boom to avoid pre-defined areas in the field. Such a system could improve management of buffer zones, reduce the risk for mistakes and improve record keeping from spraying activities. At the time of project start, there were commercial controllers that could fulfil parts of the requirements involved in the project. A commercial spray controller, Legacy 6000 (Teejet), could consider pre-defined areas by using the field boundary features. During 2006 and 2007, the system was used in practice on a conventional trailed sprayer with a 24 m boom and 7 boom sections. Experiences from mapping and spraying were documented. Also accuracy of the system was studied in an experiment using video recorder and analysis of the video frame by frame. Results were communicated with several manufacturers of sprayer controllers to improve development of coming products. The following season, 2008, a small sprayer with a 6 m boom and individual nozzle control was constructed. This year, the study of accuracy focused on small circular buffer zones, e. g. close to drainage wells. Spraying was done on an asphalt surface during a sunny day, leaving wet and dark marks when nozzles were activated. The whole buffer zone was photographed directly after spraying, and the pictures were later analysed manually to determine the accuracy of the sprayer. Different controller settings, spray nozzles and GPS receivers were used. The accuracy of a conventional sprayer with DGPS was found to be about +/- 1 m. Accuracy of the sprayer with solenoid valves and RTK GPS was about half of this, i. e. +/- 0, 5 m. This is probably better than the possibilities with manual control. Different methods for <b>mapping</b> <b>fields</b> and creation of boundary files were evaluated and compared. Mapping could be done through digitalisation of an aerial photograph or when spraying the field for the first time. Best accuracy is achieved if mapping could be done with a RTK GPS on e. g. an ATV. A method for calculation of double-sprayed area has been developed in the project. The mapped fields in the project have served as a base for a simplified tool that can be used by farmers and advisors to determine the advantages with more accurate sprayer control. In general terms, a farmer can save 1 - 5 % of the pesticide cost if a GNSS-controlled sprayer with individual nozzle control is used, instead of a conventional sprayer. The project sprayers have been demonstrated on several field shows and other activities with farmers. The number of controllers for automatic boom control on the Swedish market has increased during the project time...|$|E
