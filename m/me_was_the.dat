500|$|One thing I {{remember}} {{having had a}} really depressing effect on <b>me</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> first Ramones album. When I heard it , I mean {{it was a great}} record... but I hated it because I knew we'd been doing this sort of stuff for years. There was even a chord progression on that album that we used... and I thought, [...] "Fuck. We're going to be labeled as influenced by the Ramones", when nothing could have been further from the truth.|$|E

Lister later {{commented on the}} storyline, {{deciding}} it was her most memorable: [...] "The most memorable for <b>me</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> one with my weird boyfriend Will who stalked me. Like I said, {{it was a bit}} weird, but I quite liked it as a storyline." [...] During a fire safety promotion undertaken with co-star Lena Kaur, who plays Leila Roy, Lister referenced the storyline, commenting: [...] "It's much easier to test your smoke alarm once a week and plan your escape from fire than it is to escape from a psycho!".|$|E
500|$|Bergkamp {{attracted}} the attention of several European clubs {{as a result of his}} performances for Ajax. Johan Cruyff advised him not to join Real Madrid, one of the teams said to have been interested in him. But Bergkamp was insistent on playing in Italy.

500|$|Kate Capshaw {{called her}} {{character}} [...] "not {{much more than}} a dumb screaming blonde." [...] Steven Spielberg said in 1989, [...] "I wasn't happy with Temple of Doom at all. It was too dark, too subterranean, and much too horrific. I thought it out-poltered Poltergeist. There's not an ounce of my own personal feeling in Temple of Doom." [...] He later added during the Making of Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom documentary, [...] "Temple of Doom is my least favorite of the trilogy. I look back and I say, 'Well the greatest thing that I got out of that was I met Kate Capshaw.'

500|$|The {{inspiration}} behind Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham... {{came from}} Yash Chopra's Kabhi Kabhie (1976). On being {{inspired by the}} classic, Karan quoted, [...] "What appealed to <b>me</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> fact that the love story stretched out across generations. It began with youth and went on as the people grew older. You could say that Kabhi Kabhie is {{the starting point for}} my new film, that I am inspired by it. But the film, I am sure, will be very different. It will look different, feel different." [...] Similarly, Karan added an extra [...] "e" [...] to the second Kabhi in the title of his film, due to numerological reasons. In an interview with The Times of India, Karan dispelled comparisons with Kuch Kuch Hota Hai and said that while his debut film was [...] "frothy and bubble-gummish", this one was [...] "more classy and sophisticated". He added that there would be [...] "plenty of drama" [...] in this film too, but handled more maturely.|$|E
500|$|The {{musical score}} for [...] "The Winds of Winter" [...] was {{composed}} by Ramin Djawadi. Djawadi {{has worked on}} the series since its inception, and additionally composed the show's main theme. In an interview, Djawadi spoke about the score he created {{for the beginning of}} the episode, titled [...] "Light of the Seven", which largely consisted of piano, something unusual for the series. Djawadi stated, [...] "The interesting thing to <b>me</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> use of the piano. When we started the season, showrunners David Benioff and Dan Weiss, and Miguel Sapochnik, the director of the episode, reached out to me and said, 'There's something coming up in episode 10.' We talked about 'The Light of the Seven', and how it needed to be a new piece of music. Any kind of character theme could tip it, and we didn't want to tip the audience. Miguel brought it up: 'What about the piano?' We discussed it. The piano is not really {{in the language of the}} Game of Thrones score." ...|$|E
500|$|This {{episode was}} the most-watched Fox program on its airdate among adults 18 to 49; 5.75 million viewers watched. In {{his review of}} the Family Guy volume 3 DVD, Francis Rizzo III of DVD Talk wrote [...] "But if any moment stands out among this run, it's the {{supermarket}} scene in [...] "Breaking Out is Hard to Do." [...] When Chris is pulled into the [...] "Take On Me" [...] video by a-ha, it's a perfect blend of what this show does best, combining nonsense, the '80s and some neat animation. The lead-in, the punchline and {{the execution of the}} whole scene is handled so well that it might be one of the show's most memorable ever." [...] In her review of the episode, Kim Voynar of TV Squad wrote [...] "This was, overall, a very funny episode. Lots of funny references—the Trix Rabbit, Karl Malden, MASH, Star Wars, [...] "Three's Company" [...] The funniest moment for <b>me,</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> bit with Stewie walking in on Brian cross-dressing. That alone was worth the price of admission." ...|$|E
