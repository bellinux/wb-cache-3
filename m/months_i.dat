5|$|For {{the last}} nine <b>months</b> <b>I</b> have kept silence and treated with disdain the charges of disloyalty and {{suggestions}} of treachery made against me in the Press and elsewhere. But I can keep silence no longer, for these charges and suggestion have now been repeated by public men who have not scrupled to use their position to inflame the overstrained feelings of the people.|$|E
5|$|We had Belzer in {{the band}} for six <b>months.</b> <b>I</b> {{want to believe it}} was purely musical, and I {{honestly}} believe that it wasn't working musically. I also believe that we weren't emotionally mature enough to be close friends with a gay person at that point in our lives... And Bill was and is a very proud and righteous gay person, very open about his homosexuality.|$|E
5|$|As I {{look back}} on it today, I see the whole picture very differently. It's true that I hated missing out on Sexton. And the first few <b>months,</b> <b>I</b> was miserable at Everett. But being bused to Everett {{turned out to be one}} of the best things that ever {{happened}} to me. It got me out of my own little world and taught me how to understand white people, how to communicate and deal with them.|$|E
60|$|To add to my misfortunes, I am {{the miserable}} {{possessor}} of a demon time-table that I cannot get rid of, a Bradshaw for August, 1887. Regularly, {{on the first}} of each <b>month,</b> <b>I</b> buy and bring home with me a new Bradshaw and a new A.B.C. What becomes of them after the second of the <b>month,</b> <b>I</b> do not know. After the second of the <b>month,</b> <b>I</b> never see either of them again. What their fate is, I can only guess. In their place is left, to mislead me, this wretched old 1887 corpse.|$|R

This present month is only the sixth, and I am already in portraits! ...|$|R
5|$|Also in 1990, the U.S. {{intervened in}} the Middle East with Operation Desert Storm. During that intervention, Fort Lewis {{deployed}} 34 active and 25 reserve component units to Saudi Arabia. I Corps {{also contributed to}} the command structure, with the I Corps Commander, LTG Calvin A. H. Waller and the Deputy I Corps Commander, MG Paul R. Schwartz, assisting General H. Norman Schwarzkopf, the Commander of the American Forces. I Corps expanded its contingency missions and became a quick-response corps. For several <b>months,</b> <b>I</b> Corps was the nation's worldwide contingency corps, while the XVIII Airborne Corps was engaged in the Gulf War. This caused a good deal of activity on Fort Lewis, as the post restructured itself to support the corps' new mission, and to insure that it had a smooth, rapid departure in case they were needed anywhere in the world. This duty was returned to XVIII Airborne Corps upon its return to the United States. The corps then began to convert to a permanently structured, no-mobilization contingency corps and was placed under the operational control of the United States Army Forces Command. This entailed the addition of a number of active component corps units.|$|E

25|$|I {{must say}} that in all my conversations with you...during the last nine <b>months</b> <b>I</b> have never uttered one word of untruth. This is borne out {{absolutely}} by the record. In all my fifty years of public service I {{have never seen a}} document that was more crowded with infamous falsehoods and distortions--infamous falsehoods and distortions on a scale so huge that I never imagined until today that any Government on this planet was capable of uttering them.|$|E

25|$|But {{after seven}} <b>months</b> <b>I</b> {{dropped out of}} Dune, by then Rudy Wurlitzer {{had come up with}} a first-draft script which I felt was a decent {{distillation}} of Frank Herbert's. But I also realised Dune was {{going to take a lot}} more work—at least two and a half years' worth. And I didn't have the heart to attack that because my older brother Frank unexpectedly died of cancer while I was prepping the De Laurentiis picture. Frankly, that freaked me out. So I went to Dino and told him the Dune script was his.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to pursuing {{a wide variety}} of local issues, I have attempted to question, probe and scrutinise the Government in the House of Commons on important national and international topics which concern people. Over the last 12 <b>months,</b> <b>I</b> have constantly pressed the case for reform of world trade rules to give the poorest people on the planet a chance to sell their products and improve their quality of life. The plight of the people of Darfur, Western Sudan, has also been a regular theme. They have suffered too much for too long with too little done about the situation. I shall go on arguing for Britain {{to take the lead in}} the international community in seeking decisive action for peace and justice.|$|E
25|$|Murray became Chief of the Imperial General Staff on 26 September 1915. He was {{promoted}} to permanent lieutenant general on 28 October 1915. After the war he wrote to Ian Hamilton, criticising Kitchener in harsh terms, writing that “He seldom told the absolute the truth and the whole truth” {{and that it was}} not until Kitchener left for his inspection of the Dardanelles that Murray was able to inform the Cabinet that volunteering had fallen far below the level needed to maintain a BEF of 70 divisions, requiring the introduction of conscription. The Cabinet insisted on proper General Staff papers being presented in Kitchener's absence. Murray wrote that “I have never in my forty years’ service done better work than I did during the three <b>months</b> <b>I</b> was CIGS”. Cabinet Secretary Maurice Hankey praised Murray highly as a real “St John the Baptist” to Sir William Robertson, his successor as CIGS.|$|E

500|$|I love New York. But if I'm there, I {{want to go}} out, friends come to the studio, {{the phone}} rings constantly. But in Capri, I am in a remote place, {{and there is no}} one I can run into. I felt that in Capri I would be able to {{effectively}} finish the album on a shorter schedule. And I did. I made it in three <b>months,</b> <b>I</b> was like 'Get me off this label!' I couldn't take it. The situation there [...] was becoming increasingly difficult.|$|E
500|$|Three {{months into}} his loan spell, in early October, Rehman {{said of his}} move to play for Blackpool: [...] "I'm quite glad {{to get away from}} all the hustle and bustle of London. I really like it up here in Blackpool; it's a good club with an ambitious young manager. Hopefully, over the next few <b>months</b> <b>I</b> can {{convince}} Simon Grayson I'm worthy of a long-term contract." [...] On 31 December he returned to QPR after having made three league appearances, all of which were as a substitute.|$|E
500|$|On her Christmas Day 2007 {{television}} show, Martha Stewart {{exhibited the}} nativity scene she made in pottery {{classes at the}} Alderson Federal Prison Camp in Alderson, West Virginia while serving a 2005 sentence. She remarked, [...] "Even though every inmate was only allowed to do one a month, and I was only there for five <b>months,</b> <b>I</b> begged because I said I was an expert potter—ceramicist actually—and could I please make the entire nativity scene." [...] She supplemented her nativity figurines on the show with tiny artificial palm trees imported from Germany.|$|E

500|$|A 163-minute {{version of}} the film competed in the main {{competition}} of the 2009 Cannes Film Festival. The Cannes cut lacked much of the finished film's sound design, and some visual effects were not fully in place. Noé said about the version: [...] "the film was like a baby of three <b>months.</b> <b>I</b> took {{it out of my}} belly to show it, flattered by [...] Thierry Frémaux's invitation, but it was still in gestation. So I had to put it back into my belly, that is to say to tweak many details." ...|$|E
500|$|Asked in May 2014 if Aerosmith {{will release}} a sixteenth studio album anytime soon, bassist Tom Hamilton replied, [...] "I hope soon. But I really don't {{know what we}} are doing because we no longer have a record contract. We are {{finished}} with Columbia. So, there is nothing written in stone. We'll see what the fans want." [...] In an interview with Rolling Stone about what the future holds, Joe Perry admitted that, [...] "I don't even know if making new albums makes sense anymore. Maybe we'll just release an EP every six <b>months.</b> <b>I</b> don't know what the future looks like." ...|$|E

With 51.1% of the popular vote, Obama became the first Democratic president since Franklin D. Roosevelt to win the majority of the popular vote twice. President Obama addressed supporters and volunteers at Chicago's McCormick Place after his reelection and said: [...] "Tonight you voted for action, not politics as usual. You elected us to focus on your jobs, not ours. And in the coming weeks and <b>months,</b> <b>I</b> am looking forward to reaching out and working with leaders of both parties." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{first thing}} for a private {{secretary}} {{to do is to}} study her employer. After I went to work for Mr. Roosevelt, for <b>months</b> <b>I</b> read carefully all the letters he dictated ... I learned what letters he wanted to see and which ones it was not necessary to show him ... I came to know exactly how Mr. Roosevelt would answer some of his letters, how he would couch his thoughts. When he discovered that I had learned these things it took a load off his shoulders, for instead of having to dictate the answers to many letters he could just say yes or no and I knew what to say and how to say it.|$|E
500|$|In late November, Benzema began {{appearing}} mainly {{as a substitute}} as manager Manuel Pellegrini preferred Gonzalo Higuaín in the lead striker role. To coincide with his benching, the striker was also being criticized by the Spanish media for his under-performance and difficulties settling in the country as {{he had not yet}} begun learning the Spanish language. He was even declared the [...] "new Anelka" [...] by a Spanish newspaper Marca blogger, referring to former Real Madrid striker Nicolas Anelka who had a tumultuous year at the club before being sold. Benzema was defended by his compatriot Zinedine Zidane, who admitted [...] "after two <b>months,</b> <b>I</b> was also criticized" [...] and that Benzema was [...] "a talented player and talented players in Madrid must win".|$|E
500|$|The country's sole {{female athlete}} at the 2016 Games was Bibiro Ali Taher, who {{competed in the}} 5000 metres. She participated on 16 August in the second heat of the competition. Taher was towards {{the back of the}} field as she passed the line on her second to last lap, when she heard the bell {{indicating}} the final lap. This was not meant for her, but instead for runners who were a full lap ahead of her. She mistakenly thought the bell indicated that it was her final lap, and so pulled up after another 400 metres. As such, she did not finish her race. She later said in an interview, [...] "I gave everything I could. I worked like crazy these past twelve <b>months.</b> <b>I</b> have no regrets, but I had tears in my eyes because I wanted to leave Rio with a new record." ...|$|E
