5|$|In June 1942, the Japanese {{occupied}} some of {{the western}} Aleutian islands, and hoped to occupy Amchitka. Eager to remove the Japanese, the Joint Chiefs of Staff agreed to <b>move</b> <b>quickly</b> <b>to</b> regain the territory. American planners decided to build a series of airfields {{to the west of}} Umnak, from which bombers could attack the invading forces.|$|E
5|$|Fender fielded mainly at slip. He possessed quick {{reactions}} and could <b>move</b> <b>quickly</b> <b>to</b> catch balls hit {{some distance from}} him. His technique was unorthodox; he crouched low when waiting for the ball with one leg stretched behind him, like a sprinter ready to begin a race. Good catching was vital in a Surrey side which possessed weak bowling, making his contributions even more important, and critics regarded {{him as one of}} the best slip fielders in England.|$|E
5|$|From the 24th Infantry Division, one {{battalion}} {{was assigned}} to be airlifted into Korea via C-54 Skymaster transport aircraft and <b>move</b> <b>quickly</b> <b>to</b> block advancing North Korean forces while {{the remainder of the}} division could be transported to South Korea on ships. The 21st Infantry Regiment was determined to be the most combat-ready of the 24th Infantry Division's three regiments, and the 21st Infantry's 1st Battalion was selected because its commander, Lieutenant Colonel Charles B. Smith, was the most experienced, having commanded a battalion at the Battle of Guadalcanal during World War II. On July 5, Task Force Smith engaged North Korean forces at the Battle of Osan, delaying over 5,000 North Korean infantry for seven hours before being routed and forced back.|$|E

5|$|On 22 October the British 18th (Eastern) Division of XVIII Corps {{attacked}} {{the east end}} of Poelcappelle. XIV Corps on the left attacked with the 34th Division between the Watervlietbeek and Broenbeek streams and the 35th Division northwards into Houthulst Forest, supported by a regiment of the French 1st Division. Poelcappelle was captured but the attack at the junction between the 34th and 35th divisions was repulsed. German counterattacks also pushed back the 35th Division in the centre as the French attack captured all its objectives. Attacking on ground cut up by bombardments, soaked by rain and churned into deep mud, the British had struggled to advance in places and could not <b>move</b> <b>quickly</b> <b>to</b> outflank pillboxes. Troops of the British 35th Division, reached the edge of Houthulst Forest but in several other places were pushed back. Counterattacks made by the Germans after 22 October, were at an equal disadvantage and were costly failures. The German 4th Army was prevented from transferring troops away from the Fifth Army or from concentrating its artillery-fire on the Canadians as they prepared to attack Passchendaele Ridge.|$|E
5|$|The 1st Battalion, 35th Infantry {{held the}} regiment's left flank west of Komam-ni, while the 2nd Battalion held the {{right along the}} Nam River. 3rd Battalion, redesignated from the 1st Battalion, 29th Infantry, was in reserve on the road south of Chirwon from where it could <b>move</b> <b>quickly</b> <b>to</b> {{any part of the}} line. To the south was the US 24th Infantry Regiment and west of Chindong-ni, the 5th Regimental Combat Team was on the {{division}}'s left flank. On division orders, the 5th Regimental Combat Team first held the ground above the Chindong-ni coastal road only as far as Yaban-san. Kean soon decided, however, that the 5th RCT should close the gap northward between it and the 24th Infantry. When the 5th sent a South Korean unit of 100 men under American officers to the higher slope of Sobuk-san, North Korean troops already there drove them back. Kean then ordered the 5th RCT to take this ground, but it was too late.|$|E
5|$|On 22 October the 18th (Eastern) Division of XVIII Corps {{attacked}} {{the east end}} of Polecappelle as XIV Corps to the north attacked with the 34th Division between the Watervlietbeek and Broenbeek streams and the 35th Division attacked northwards into Houthulst Forest. (The 35th Division was supported by a regiment of the French 1st Division on the left flank.) The attack was intended to push forward the left flank of the Fifth Army, to guard against a German counter-attack on the flank of the Canadian Corps, when it attacked Passchendaele. The artillery of the Second and Fifth armies conducted a bombardment to simulate a general attack as a deception. Poelcappelle was captured but the attack at the junction between the 34th and 35th divisions was repulsed. German counter-attacks pushed back the 35th Division in the centre but the French captured all their objectives. Attacking on ground cut up by bombardments and soaked by rain, the British had struggled to advance in places and lost the ability to <b>move</b> <b>quickly</b> <b>to</b> outflank pillboxes. The 35th Division infantry reached the fringes of Houthulst Forest but were pushed back in places after being outflanked in turn. German counter-attacks after 22 October, had an equal disadvantage and were costly failures. The German 4th Army was prevented from transferring troops away from the Fifth Army and from concentrating its artillery-fire on the Canadians as they prepared for the Second Battle of Passchendaele (26 October – 10 November 1917).|$|E

25|$|LDDC {{had very}} little money, but it did have three crucial levers to deliver regeneration. First of all it had land ownership: this enabled it to enter into {{commercial}} deals with developers. Secondly it had planning powers: this was a controversial move, which angered local boroughs, but which allowed, for example, the outline planning permission for Canary Wharf to specify only the height and footprint of buildings, enabling the development to <b>move</b> <b>quickly</b> <b>to</b> satisfy demand. Finally LDDC {{had the power to}} broker and enter into contracts.|$|E
25|$|In the Yom Kippur War, the {{military}} police greatly assisted in {{the chaos of the}} surprise attack on Israel, guiding reserve reinforcements to their intended destinations. In the Sinai Peninsula, large quantities of military vehicles were to <b>move</b> <b>quickly</b> <b>to</b> the front lines, but the narrow roads and lack of direction created major traffic jams. MPs conducted battlefield circulation control operations in order to guide vehicle movement throughout the battlefield. The preventing of looting was also a major task, this was due to the chaos that was created {{as a result of the}} surprise attack during the initial stages of the war.|$|E
25|$|Animals {{move for}} a variety of reasons, such as to find food, a mate, a {{suitable}} microhabitat, or to escape predators. For many animals, the ability to move is essential for survival and, as a result, natural selection has shaped the locomotion methods and mechanisms used by moving organisms. For example, migratory animals that travel vast distances (such as the Arctic tern) typically have a locomotion mechanism that costs very little energy per unit distance, whereas non-migratory animals that must frequently <b>move</b> <b>quickly</b> <b>to</b> escape predators are likely to have energetically costly, but very fast, locomotion.|$|E

Grouchy at once began gathering additional divisions {{and headed to}} Limal, arriving at 23:00, where he found that Pajol's cavalry had forced the bridge there. Prussian scouting cavalry noticed the strong French columns moving to Limal and the Prussian 12th Brigade moved covering forces to the area. The Prussians made a bayonet charge {{in an attempt to}} retake Limal, but without success. Night closed the major actions of the battle of Wavre, although outposts fired on each other all night.|$|E
25|$|In his {{successful}} Tullahoma Campaign {{in the summer}} of 1863, Rosecrans moved southeast from Murfreesboro, Tennessee, outmaneuvering Bragg and forcing him to abandon Middle Tennessee and withdraw to the city of Chattanooga, suffering only 569 Union casualties along the way. General-in-chief Maj. Gen. Henry W. Halleck and President Abraham Lincoln were insistent that Rosecrans <b>move</b> <b>quickly</b> <b>to</b> take Chattanooga. Seizing the city would open the door for the Union to advance toward Atlanta and the heartland of the South. Chattanooga was a vital rail hub (with lines going north toward Nashville and Knoxville and south toward Atlanta), and an important manufacturing center for the production of iron and coke, located on the navigable Tennessee River. Situated between Lookout Mountain, Missionary Ridge, Raccoon Mountain, and Stringer's Ridge, Chattanooga occupied an important, defensible position.|$|E
25|$|Sheridan and two cavalry {{divisions}} left on June 7 {{for their}} raid against the Virginia Central Railroad and {{to link up}} with Hunter. In the first two days, plagued by heat and humidity, and by irregular mounted raiding parties, the Federal column advanced only about 40 miles. Scouts passed word of Sheridan's movements to Maj. Gen. Wade Hampton, the senior Confederate cavalry commander, {{on the morning of}} June 8. He correctly guessed that the Union targets were the railroad junctions at Gordonsville and Charlottesville, and knew {{that he would have to}} <b>move</b> <b>quickly</b> <b>to</b> block the threat. His division and the division of Maj. Gen. Fitzhugh Lee began to move in pursuit early on June 9. Although the Federals had a two-day head start, the Confederates had the advantage of a shorter route (about 45 miles versus 65) and terrain that was more familiar to them. By the evening of June 10, both forces had converged around Trevilian Station. The Federals had crossed over the North Anna River at Carpenters Ford and camped at locations around Clayton's Store.|$|E
