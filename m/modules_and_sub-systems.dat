40|$|Modularization {{refers to}} the {{opportunity}} for mixing-and-matching of components in a modular product design in which the standard interfaces between components are specified {{to allow for a}} range of variation in components to be substituted in a product architecture. It is through mixing-and-matching of these components, and how these components interface with one another, that new systems are created. Consequently, the degree of modularization inherent in a system is highly dependent upon the components and the interface constraints shared among the components, <b>modules,</b> <b>and</b> <b>sub-systems.</b> In this paper, a mathematical model is derived for analyzing the degree of modularization in a given product architecture by taking into consideration the number of components, number of interfaces, the composition of new-to-the-firm (NTF) components, and substitutability of components. An analysis of Chrysler windshield wipers controller suggests that two product architectures may share similar interface constraints, but the opportunity for modularization of one module is significant higher than the other due to th...|$|E
40|$|The readout {{electronics}} in PHOS and TPC - {{two of the}} major detectors of the ALICE experiment at the LHC - consist {{of a set of}} Front End Cards (FECs) that digitize, process and buffer the data from the detector sensors. The FECs are connected to a Readout Control Unit (RCU) via two sets of custom made PCB backplanes. For PHOS, 28 FECs are connected to one RCU, while for TPC the number is varying from 18 to 25 FECs depending on location. The RCU {{is in charge of the}} data readout, including reception and distribution of triggers and in moving the data from the FECs to the Data Acquisition System. In addition it does low level control tasks. The RCU consists of an RCU Motherboard that hosts a Detector Control System (DCS) board and a Source Interface Unit. The DCS board is an embedded computer running Linux that controls the {{readout electronics}}. All the mentioned devices are implemented in commercial grade SRAM based Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). Even if these devices are not very radiation tolerant, they are chosen because of their cost and flexibility, and most importantly the possibility to easily do future upgrades of the electronics. Since physical shielding of the electronics is not possible in ALICE due to the architecture of the detector, the radiation related errors need to be handled with other techniques such as firmware mitigation techniques. The main objective of this thesis has been to make firmware modules for the FPGAs reciding in different parts of the readout electronics. Because of the flexibility of the designs, some of them have, with minor adaptations, been applied in different devices surrounding the readout electronics. Additionally, effort has been put into testing and integration of the system. In detail, the work presented in this thesis can be summarized as follows: - Firmware design for radiation environments. All firmware modules that are designed are to be used in a radiation environment, and then special precautions need to be taken. Additionally, a state-of-the-art solution has been designed for protecting the main FPGA on the RCU Motherboard against radiation induced functional failures. - Implementation of Trigger Handling for the TPC/PHOS Readout Electronics. The triggers are received from the global trigger system via an optical link and are handled by an Application Spesific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) on the DCS board. The problem is that the DCS board might have occasional down time 6 due to radiation related errors, so a special interface module is designed for the main FPGA on the RCU Motherboard. This module decodes and verifies the information received from the trigger system. As it is a generic design it has also been implemented as part of the BusyBox. The BusyBox is an important device in the trigger path of the TPC and PHOS sub-detectors. - Testing and Verification of all firmware modules. All firmware modules have been extensively verified with computer simulation before being tested in real hardware. - Maintenance of the DCS board for TPC/PHOS and of the different Fee firmware modules in general. - System Integration and System Level Tests. A big contribution has been done integrating and testing all the <b>modules</b> <b>and</b> <b>sub-systems.</b> This concern both locally on the RCU and the BusyBox, as well as making all the devices play together on a larger scale. - Testing and Verification of all firmware modules.

40|$|Dell Inc. is {{a company}} {{headquartered}} in Round Rock, TX founded by entrepreneur Michael Dell in 1984. In its 20 + years of history, Dell has revolutionized the PC industry by deploying the "Dell Direct" model [...] eliminating the "middleman" retailers in the PC supply chain-and achieved the Number 1 market share in the PC market. In managing its supply chain, Dell also utilizes its direct model and owns strategic relationships {{with many of the}} contract manufacturers, most of which have factories in China. For desktop PCs, these contract manufacturers produce semi-completed products and ship these products to Dell's U. S. and Ireland factories, and then Dell factory workers complete the remainder of the desktop PC assembly process by installing the components that are customized by Dell's customers. In order for Dell to remain low-cost and readily respond to customer demand, Dell's suppliers maintain a minimum amount of semi-completed goods inventory in a hub near each of Dell's manufacturing facilities. Foxconn (Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., Ltd.) was founded in 1974 by Taiwanese entrepreneur Tai-ming Terry Gou. Besides its home base in Taiwan, Foxconn has major manufacturing operations in mainland China, U. S., and Europe. (cont.) Originally a maker of plastic parts, connectors and cable assemblies, Foxconn has since established manufacturing facilities worldwide that produce a variety of high-tech products, including electrical and mechanical components, <b>modules</b> <b>and</b> <b>sub-systems</b> for PCs, consumer electronics, handsets, networking, and display products. Foxconn's eCMMS (e-enabled components, modules, move and service) model and its high degree of vertical integration in supply chain allow Foxconn to address clients' needs from a single source. Foxconn services name-brand clients, such as Dell. Similar to Dell's inventory management strategies, Foxconn also requires its suppliers to keep a minimum amount of raw materials at its inbound warehouse. Dell and Foxconn's shared strategy is to maintain a minimum level of inventory while balancing it with a continuity of supply, in order to maximize sales and minimize the inventory-holding cost. However, this inventory management policy has been disrupted by a continuous shortage of chipset supply from Dell's chipset manufacturer since July 2004. A chipset is a critical component of the desktop motherboard manufactured by Foxconn in China. (cont.) After manufacturing the motherboard, Foxconn is also responsible for installing the motherboard into the desktop chassis before shipping the motherboard-inside chassis from China to U. S. or Ireland by ocean. The chipset supply shortage has caused Foxconn {{not to be able to}} procure chipsets in order to manufacture the motherboards in China. As a result, some chassis are shipped empty by ocean first, and motherboards are air-freighted later. This leads Dell to utilize Third-Party Integrators (3 PI) in the U. S. to install the motherboards into the chassis. The continuous shortfall of chipset supply increases the volume of motherboard-chassis integration in the U. S. and further increases Dell's overall manufacturing costs. Thus, the goal of this thesis is to create a framework for improving the flexibility of the Desktop PC Supply Chain. This framework examines how the various players contribute to the supply chain, the dynamics among these players that led to the current supply chain design, and how Dell can work with its suppliers and other strategic partners to more effectively balance demand and supply. (cont.) This thesis will explain the symptoms as well as the root causes of the problem, present the original direction of my internship and the exogenous factors that caused the direction to change, and describe the renewed direction. It will also examine Dell's decision-making process, organizational processes, and leadership issues involved. In addition, it will discuss how other industries structure their manufacturing given a supply shortage and the importance of trust and innovating contracting in cultivating more collaborative relationships in a supply chain. by Johnson Wu.

ACE consists of a suite of instruments in which the primary element is an infrared Fourier Transform Spectrometer (FTS) coupled with an auxiliary 2 -channel visible (525 nm) and near infrared imager (1020 nm). A secondary instrument, MAESTRO, provides spectrographic data from the near ultra-violet to the near infrared, including the visible spectral range. In combination the instrument payload covers the spectral range from 0. 25 to 13. 3 micron. A comprehensive set of simultaneous measurements of trace gases, thin clouds, aerosols and temperature {{will be made by}} solar occultation from a satellite in low earth orbit. The ACE mission will measure and analyze the chemical and dynamical processes that control the distribution of ozone in the upper troposphere and stratosphere.

40|$|Modularity {{refers to}} the scheme by which {{interfaces}} shared among components in a given product architecture are standardized and specified to allow for greater reusability and commonality sharing of components among product families. The management of innovation through modular product architecture strategies is gaining increasing importance for firms, not only in practice but also from a theoretical perspective. It is argued {{that the degree of}} modularity inherent in a given product architecture is sensitive and highly dependent upon the number of components and the interface constraints shared among the components, <b>modules,</b> <b>sub-systems,</b> <b>and</b> systems. This paper applies a mathematical model, termed modularization function, for analyzing dynamics and the degree of modularity of a given product architecture by taking into account the following variables: number of components, number of interfaces, new-to-the-firm component composition, and substitutability factor. The application of the modularization function is illustrated with two elevator systems from Schindler Lifts of Switzerland: traction and hydraulic elevators. The comparative analysis of the elevators captures the sensitivity and dynamics of product architecture modularity created by three types of components (standard, neutral, and unique) and two types of interfaces (fundamental and optional) ...|$|R

The HDU previously {{served as a}} test bed for testing technologies <b>and</b> <b>sub-systems</b> in a terrestrial surface environment. in 2010 in the Pressurized Excursion Module (PEM) configuration. Due {{to the amount of}} work involved to make the HDU project successful, the HDU project has required a team to integrate a variety of contributions from NASA centers and outside collaborators The size of the team and number of systems involved With the HDU makes Integration a complicated process. However, because the HDU shell manufacturing is complete, the team has a head start on FY [...] 11 integration activities and can focus on integrating upgrades to existing systems as well as integrating new additions. To complete the development of the FY- 11 HDU from conception to rollout for operations in July 2011, a cohesive integration strategy has been developed to integrate the various systems of HDU and the payloads. The highlighted HDU work for FY- 11 will focus on performing upgrades to the PEM configuration, adding the X-Hab as a second level, adding a new porch providing the astronauts a larger work area outside the HDU for EVA preparations, and adding a Hygiene module. Together these upgrades result in a prototype configuration of the Deep Space Habitat (DSH), an element under evaluation by NASA's Human Exploration Framework Team (HEFT) Scheduled activates include early fit-checks and the utilization of a Habitat avionics test bed prior to installation into HDU. A coordinated effort to utilize modeling and simulation systems has aided in design and integration concept development. Modeling tools have been effective in hardware systems layout, cable routing, sub-system interface length estimation and human factors analysis. Decision processes on integration and use of all new subsystems will be defined early in the project to maximize the efficiency of both integration and field operations. In addition a series of tailored design reviews are utilized to quickly define the systems and their integration into the DSH configuration. These processes are necessary to ensure activities, such as partially reversing integration of the X-Hab second story of the HDU and deploying and stowing the new work porch for transportation to the JSC Rock Yard and to the Arizona Black Point Lava Flow Site are performed with minimal or no complications. In addition, incremental test operations leading up to an Integrated systems test allows for an orderly systems test program. For FY- 11 activities, the HDU DSH will act as a laboratory utilizing a new X-Hab inflatable second floor with crew habitation features. In addition to the day to day operations involving maintenance of the HDU and exploring the surrounding terrain, testing and optimizing the use of the new X-Hab, work porch, Hygiene <b>Module,</b> <b>and</b> other <b>sub-system</b> enhancements will be the focus of the FY- 11 test objectives. The HDU team requires a successful integration strategy using a variety of tools and approaches to prepare the DSH for these test objectives.

In this paper, we design a hierarchical computing system that utilizes processing elements distributed across the storage hierarchy, {{with the objective of}} reducing the data movement between the storage subsystem and the processing units. The computing elements can be commodity processing elements or specialized devices similar to active memory <b>modules</b> <b>and</b> active disk devices emerging from other research groups. Database queries are partitioned across the different layers of the hierarchy depending on the anity of code to a particular layer. Commands percolate down into the lower layers of the hierarchy and partially processed information flows up into the higher layers, where if necessary subsequent operations are performed. All layers actively participate in the processing of the transaction by doing tasks for which they are particularly suited. We evaluate the effectiveness of the hierarchical computing model using the SimOS full system simulator. On TPC-H queries, hierarchical computing systems with 4 <b>and</b> 8 memory <b>modules</b> can yield speedups in the range of 1. 18 x to 1. 5 x when compared with equivalent shared-memory multiprocessor systems.
