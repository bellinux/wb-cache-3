5|$|Owing to Hurricane Belle's {{proximity}} to <b>many</b> <b>states</b> along the Eastern Seaboard, hurricane watches and warnings were issued {{for the entire}} coast from Georgia to Maine. Accordingly, evacuations took place in numerous states with an estimated 500,000 people evacuating overall.|$|E
5|$|States that {{rejected}} the Medicaid expansion could maintain their Medicaid eligibility thresholds, which in <b>many</b> <b>states</b> were significantly below 133% {{of the poverty}} line. <b>Many</b> <b>states</b> did not make Medicaid available to childless adults at any income level. Because subsidies on exchange insurance plans were not available to those below the poverty line, such individuals had no new options. For example, in Kansas, where only able-bodied adults with children and with an income below 32% of the poverty line were eligible for Medicaid, those with incomes from 32% to 100% of the poverty level ($6,250 to $19,530 {{for a family of}} three) were ineligible for both Medicaid and federal subsidies to buy insurance. Absent children, able-bodied adults were not eligible for Medicaid in Kansas.|$|E

5|$|A reptile {{becomes the}} {{official}} state symbol {{after it is}} voted in by the state legislature. Although <b>many</b> <b>states</b> require the bill to be signed by the governor, in some the enabling act is a resolution (legislature vote only). In 2004, Illinois held a popular vote to pick the painted turtle, but legislation was still required in 2005 to make the choice official.|$|E
5|$|American Sign Language {{is growing}} in {{popularity}} among <b>many</b> <b>states.</b> Many people {{in high school and}} colleges wanting to take it as a foreign language, but until recently, it was not a creditable foreign language elective. The issue was that many didn't consider it a foreign language. ASL users, however, have a very distinct culture and way they interact when talking. Their facial expressions and hand movements reflect what they are conveying. They also have their own sentence structure which sets the language apart.|$|E

5|$|In the United States, laws {{regulating}} physician licenses {{are governed}} by the states. Between 1901 and 1989, osteopathic physicians lobbied state legislatures to pass laws giving those with a D.O. degree the same legal privilege to practice medicine as those with an M.D. degree. In <b>many</b> <b>states,</b> the debate was long and protracted. Both the AOA and the AMA were heavily involved in influencing the legislative process. The first state to pass such a law was California in 1901, the last was Nebraska in 1989.|$|E
5|$|NEPA {{has been}} emulated, {{in one form}} or another, by more than one hundred other countries, and <b>many</b> <b>states</b> have also {{established}} “mini NEPAs.” When national government agencies first started to prepare EISs, there were no professional associations dedicated to the planning and problem solving that NEPA demanded. Subsequently, Caldwell's efforts in formulating NEPA, and later promoting it, led to formation of the National Association of Environmental Professionals (NAEP), a national professional association of persons who prepare EISs.|$|E
5|$|Official state {{horses are}} one of many state symbols officially {{designated}} by states. Each state has its own flag and state seal, and <b>many</b> <b>states</b> also designate other symbols, including animals, plants, and foods. Such items usually are designated because of their ties to the culture or history of that particular state. In addition to being state symbols in their own right, horses have also appeared in state symbols; for example, a horse's head appears on the Seal of New Jersey.|$|E

5|$|Stochastic {{matrices}} are square matrices whose rows are probability vectors, that is, whose {{entries are}} non-negative and sum up to one. Stochastic matrices {{are used to}} define Markov chains with finitely <b>many</b> <b>states.</b> A row of the stochastic matrix gives the probability distribution for the next position of some particle currently in the state that corresponds to the row. Properties of the Markov chain like absorbing states, that is, states that any particle attains eventually, can be read off the eigenvectors of the transition matrices.|$|E
5|$|The {{extensive}} {{environmental damage}} {{that resulted from}} usage of the herbicide prompted the United Nations to pass Resolution 31/72 and ratify the Environmental Modification Convention. <b>Many</b> <b>states</b> do not regard this as a complete ban {{on the use of}} herbicides and defoliants in warfare but it does require case-by-case consideration.|$|E
5|$|The {{national}} {{conservation status}} of the great white shark is reflected by all Australian states under their respective laws, granting the species full protection throughout Australia regardless of jurisdiction. <b>Many</b> <b>states</b> had prohibited the killing or possession of great white sharks prior to national legislation coming into effect.

About 6 million people were helped {{at a cost of}} $7 billion a year but that amount was expected to double in 10 years. State officials claimed the action caused insurance premiums to go up dramatically. <b>Many</b> <b>states</b> sued in federal court on the grounds that Trump was not legally allowed to take the action.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} factors, {{including}} the bizarre facts and Cardozo's outstanding reputation, {{made the case}} prominent in the legal profession, and it remains so, taught to {{most if not all}} American law students in torts class. Cardozo's conception, that tort liability only occurs when a defendant breaches a duty of care the defendant owes to a plaintiff, causing the injury sued for, has been widely accepted in American law. In dealing with proximate cause, <b>many</b> <b>states</b> have taken the approach championed by the Court of Appeals' dissenter in Palsgraf, Judge William S. Andrews.

5|$|Although {{setting the}} state budget is a {{legislative}} function in <b>many</b> <b>states,</b> Kentucky governors are required by statute to present a proposed biennial budget to the General Assembly for approval shortly after the beginning of its even-year sessions. The governor's budget has often been approved with few changes, but since the Republicans {{took control of the}} state senate {{for the first time in}} 1999, approval has become a much more contentious process. The General Assembly failed to pass a budget before the end of its session in both 2002 and 2004. In both cases, the state operated under an executive spending plan drafted by the governor until the legislature could re-convene and pass a budget. In 2005 the Kentucky Supreme Court ruled that the governor had no authority to expend funds without legislative approval, and that if legislators failed to pass a budget in the future, only expenditures explicitly authorized in the state constitution could be made.|$|E
5|$|Another American {{tradition}} {{is that of}} an apolitical military, although this custom was of more recent origin, dating back only to the period after the American Civil War. Few officers voted in the 19th century, {{but not so much}} from a lack of interest in politics as because frequently moving from state to state and living on Federal land effectively disenfranchised them under the laws of <b>many</b> <b>states.</b> Under General of the Army William T. Sherman, the Commanding General of the United States Army from 1869 to 1883, who hated politics, this custom of an apolitical military became firmly established.|$|E
5|$|As of November 2014, 28 {{states have}} enacted medical {{marijuana}} laws, removed jail time {{for possession of}} small amounts of marijuana, and/or have legalized the possession, distribution, and sale of marijuana outright. The factors which have led to this change are many, {{but some of them}} could include increased support from the medical community for legalization, viable regulatory systems modeled off of alcohol regulation, and the potential for state financial gains from decreased criminal justice costs and increased tax revenues. Although outright legalization for non-medical use of marijuana has only occurred in four states in the Union, in view of the movements in <b>many</b> <b>states,</b> it is possible that those states will not be alone for long.|$|E
