40|$|We {{demonstrate}} that spectrally diverse multiple <b>magnetic</b> dipole <b>resonances</b> can be excited in all-dielectric structures lacking rotational symmetry, {{in contrast to}} conventionally used spheres, disks or spheroids. Such multiple <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonances</b> arise from hybrid Mie-Fabry-Pérot modes, and can constructively interfere with induced electric dipole moments, thereby leading to novel multi-frequency unidirectional scattering. Here we focus on elongated dielectric nanobars, whose <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonances</b> can be spectrally tuned by their aspect ratios. Based on our theoretical results, we suggest all-dielectric multimode metasurfaces and verify them in proof-of-principle microwave experiments.

40|$|URL] TJ-II {{stellarator}} is a mid-size Heliac design (high rotational transform, low magnetic shear) {{that allows}} for external control of the rotational transform profile. The long experience with locating diverse <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonances</b> at different plasma radii has assessed their reliability as transport controllers: in low density electron cyclotron heating plasmas, a "transport barrier effect" is found {{in most of the}} confinement zone accompanying magnetic resonances; in higher density and beta plasmas under neutral-beam heating operation, resonant layers show a clear incidence on the access to the H-mode of confinement or, likewise, on the back transition to L-mode. Moreover, confinement events similar to tokamak phenomenology have been also related with magneto-hydrodynamic activity around the <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonances</b> and are, consequently, amenable to external control. All in all, the TJ-II experience posits <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonances</b> as natural transport and stability controllers in toroidal plasmas. Further studies must either confirm or set operational limits to these findings.

We explore an exemplary structure for which surface-plasmon-polaritons offer – assuming sufficiently good conductivity – pronounced extraordinary transmission and strong multiple <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonances</b> with negative permeability. We analyze the dependence of these signatures on the type of metallization. Studying five different metals, we find that the metallization is important for achieving the multiple resonances.

40|$|We propose {{generalized}} magnetic mirrors {{that can}} be achieved by excitations of sole electric resonances. Conventional approaches to obtain magnetic mirrors rely heavily on exciting the fundamental magnetic dipoles, whereas here we reveal that besides <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonances,</b> electric resonances of higher orders can be also employed to obtain highly efficient magnetic mirrors.

5|$|Given that {{ascending}} cholangitis usually {{occurs in}} the setting of bile duct obstruction, various forms of medical imaging may be employed to identify the site and nature of this obstruction. The first investigation is usually ultrasound, as this is the most easily available. Ultrasound may show dilation of the bile duct and identifies 38% of bile duct stones; it is relatively poor at identifying stones farther down the bile duct. Ultrasound can help distinguish between cholangitis and cholecystitis (inflammation of the gallbladder), which has similar symptoms to cholangitis but appears differently on ultrasound. A better test is <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> cholangiopancreatography (MRCP), which uses <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> imaging (MRI); this has a comparable sensitivity to ERCP. Smaller stones, however, can still be missed on MRCP depending {{on the quality of the}} hospital's facilities.|$|E

In this work, we experimentally demonstrate that an asymmetric dielectric dimer made of silicon can lead to highly directional scattering depending on the excitation wavelength, due to the interference of the excited <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonances.</b> A back focal plane imaging system combined with a prism coupling technique enables us to explore the scattering profile parallel to the substrate. The directivity of scattering along the substrate is high enough to produce selective guiding of light along the substrate.
