5|$|In such {{circumstances}} Eden's {{adherence to the}} Homburg seemed fresh and dashing. He {{is one of only}} two British Prime <b>Ministers</b> <b>to</b> have had an item of clothing named after him, the other being the Duke of Wellington (his boot).|$|E
5|$|After resigning, Rudd {{stated that}} he did not think Gillard could defeat the Coalition at the next {{election}} and that, since his resignation, he had received encouragement from Labor MPs and Cabinet <b>Ministers</b> <b>to</b> contest the leadership. Gillard responded to these developments by announcing a leadership ballot for the morning of 27 February 2012, saying that if she lost the vote she would return to the backbench and renounce any claims to the leadership. She asked that Rudd make the same commitment.|$|E
50|$|In June 1917, King Constantine abdicated, the {{previous}} British <b>Minister</b> <b>to</b> the Greek Government, Sir Francis Elliot, departed and Granville became official <b>Minister</b> <b>to</b> Greece in Athens.

Macdonald (1867–1873, 1878–1891) and John Thompson (1892–1894) are the only serving Prime <b>Ministers</b> <b>to</b> have died in office.|$|E
5|$|By the 11th century, the I Ching {{was being}} {{read as a}} work of {{intricate}} philosophy, as a jumping-off point for examining great metaphysical questions and ethical issues. Cheng Yi, patriarch of the Neo-Confucian Cheng–Zhu school, read the I Ching as a guide to moral perfection. He described the text as a way to for <b>ministers</b> <b>to</b> form honest political factions, root out corruption, and solve problems in government.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} the palace was destroyed, {{separation}} of crown and state had become important, with Parliament being necessary to control military requirements and pass laws. The government wanted to be {{some distance from the}} monarch, and the buildings around Whitehall, physically separated from St James's Palace by St James's Park, seemed to be a good place for <b>ministers</b> <b>to</b> work.|$|E

5|$|Parliament {{was summoned}} in 1559 to {{consider}} the Reformation Bill {{and to create a}} new church. The Reformation Bill defined the Communion as a consubstantial celebration as opposed to a transubstantial celebration, included abuse of the pope in the litany, and ordered that ministers should not wear the surplice or other Roman Catholic vestments. It allowed <b>ministers</b> <b>to</b> marry, banned images from churches, and confirmed Elizabeth as Supreme Governor of the Church of England.|$|E
5|$|Popery is {{favourable}} to ceremony; {{and among}} the ignorant nations ceremony is the only preservative of tradition. Since Protestantism was extended to the savage parts of Scotland, it has perhaps {{been one of the}} chief labours of the <b>Ministers</b> <b>to</b> abolish stated observances, because they continued the remembrance of the former religion.|$|E
5|$|The {{work of the}} Westminster Assembly was repudiated by the Church of England {{during the}} Restoration in 1660. The Act of Uniformity 1662, a law {{requiring}} even greater adherence to the Book of Common Prayer and support for episcopalianism than had previously been required, forced Puritan <b>ministers</b> <b>to</b> leave the Church. Though some presbyterians continued to desire to be readmitted to the established church, restrictions on worship for non-conformists led to presbyterians putting aside differences with congregationalists and adopting congregational church orders.|$|E
50|$|Finlator was succeeded as {{pastor in}} 1983 by M. Mahan Siler Jr., who would serve until 1998. During his tenure, the church staff {{expanded}} <b>to</b> include a <b>minister</b> <b>to</b> children, a <b>minister</b> <b>to</b> youth, a <b>minister</b> <b>to</b> the community, and a church administrator.|$|R

5|$|Chamberlain had disliked what he {{considered}} to be an overly sentimental attitude of both Baldwin and MacDonald on Cabinet appointments and reshuffles. Although he had worked closely with the President of the Board of Trade, Walter Runciman over the tariff issue, Chamberlain dismissed him from his post, offering Runciman the token position of Lord Privy Seal, which an angry Runciman declined. Runciman, a member of the Liberal National Party, was thought by Chamberlain to be lazy. Soon after taking office, Chamberlain instructed his <b>ministers</b> <b>to</b> prepare two-year policy programmes. These reports were to be integrated with the intent of co-ordinating the passage of legislation through the current Parliament, the term of which was to expire in November 1940.|$|E
5|$|In February 1959, formal {{authority}} for beginning construction was granted. However, while Menzies was on holiday, some {{officials from the}} Department of Treasury convinced <b>ministers</b> <b>to</b> withhold money needed for the lake, so {{the start of the}} construction was delayed. Once it started, progress was fast. At its peak, the number of people physically working on the construction in the lakes was between 400 and 500. John Overall, the Commissioner of the NCDC, promised Menzies that the work would be finished within four years, and he succeeded, despite the Prime Minister's scepticism. Equipment was quickly requisitioned.|$|E
5|$|In the 1999 {{legislative}} election the FPÖ won 26.9% of the vote, its best-ever {{result in a}} nationwide election, and came ahead of the Austrian People's Party (ÖVP) by a small margin. This led the ÖVP to agree to form a coalition government with the FPÖ in 2000. The FPÖ soon became uncomfortable with governing and fell sharply in the 2002 {{legislative election}}, in which it obtained only 10.0% of the vote; however, the two parties agreed to continue their coalition following the election. In 2005 increasing internal disagreements in the FPÖ led Haider and several leading members (including all the party's <b>ministers)</b> <b>to</b> defect and form the Alliance for the Future of Austria (BZÖ), which replaced the FPÖ as government partner.|$|E

5|$|Tension grew {{between the}} Pelham {{ministry}} and George, {{as he continued}} to take advice from Carteret and rejected pressure from his other <b>ministers</b> <b>to</b> include William Pitt the Elder in the Cabinet, which would have broadened the government's support base. The king disliked Pitt because he had previously opposed government policy and attacked measures seen as pro-Hanoverian. In February 1746, Pelham and his followers resigned. George asked Lord Bath and Carteret to form an administration, but after less than 48 hours they returned the seals of office, unable to secure sufficient parliamentary support. Pelham returned to office triumphant, and George was forced to appoint Pitt to the ministry.|$|E
5|$|The Ministry of Justice {{was headed}} by a Minister who was elected by the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet between seasons, and {{authenticated}} by a Supreme Soviet convocation. Deputy Ministers were elected by the Council of Ministers; allocation of the deputies was decided by the Ministry of Justice. Each deputy usually headed {{his or her own}} department. The minister, the deputies, and other senior officials formed the leadership circle, known as the Board of the Ministry of Justice. The members of this board were approved by the Council of Ministers. The Board of the Ministry held meetings regularly to discuss legal matters nationwide. Decisions made by the board were as a rule implemented nationwide. If the board disagreed they sought the assistance of the Council of <b>Ministers</b> <b>to</b> solve the problem.|$|E
5|$|The National Assembly by a {{proposal}} of the President of Vietnam elects the prime minister. The {{prime minister is}} responsible to the National Assembly, and the Assembly elects all <b>ministers</b> <b>to</b> government. Activity reports by the prime minister {{must be given to}} the National Assembly, while the Standing Committee of the National Assembly supervises the activities of the Central Government and the prime minister. Finally, the deputies of the National Assembly have the right to question the prime minister and other members of government.|$|E

5|$|The {{eighteenth century}} saw the {{beginnings}} of a fragmentation of the Church of Scotland that had its foundation in the Reformation. These fractures were prompted by issues of government and patronage, but reflected a wider division between the Evangelicals and the Moderate Party over fears of fanaticism by the former and the acceptance of Enlightenment ideas by the latter. Ecclesiastical patronage, the right of local lairds or other notables to appoint <b>ministers</b> <b>to</b> a parish, had been abolished at the Glorious Revolution, but it was reintroduced in the Patronage Act of 1711, resulting in frequent protests from the kirk.|$|E
5|$|Under severe {{pressure}} from his <b>ministers</b> <b>to</b> resolve this issue, Field travelled to England in March 1964 to pursue sovereign statehood, but returned empty-handed a month later. He resigned {{his position on}} 13 April; this {{came as no surprise}} to many government insiders, but appeared sudden to most sections of the general public. Smith promptly accepted the cabinet's invitation to take over, though he expressed surprise at the nomination. A farmer and erstwhile British Royal Air Force pilot from the rural town of Selukwe, Smith was Southern Rhodesia's first native-born head of government. He immediately promised to take a harder line on independence than his predecessor.|$|E
5|$|A First Deputy Premier {{was usually}} given {{responsibility}} over one specific area. For example, Kirill Mazurov {{was responsible for}} industry, and Dmitry Polyansky was agriculture. However, after Polyansky's departure in 1973 Mazurov was left the sole First Deputy Premier until Tikhonov was appointed in 1976. An officeholder could also be responsible for coordinating the activities of ministries and state committees and other subordinate bodies of the Council of <b>Ministers.</b> <b>To</b> do this the First Deputy Premier had to give these bodies guidance in an expeditious manner to ensure the implementation of plans for {{economic and social development}} and to check if the orders and decisions of the Council of Ministers were being followed. If the Premier could not perform his duties one of the First Deputy Premiers would take on the role of acting Premier until the Premier's return. During the late 1970s, when the health of Premier Alexei Kosygin deteriorated, Nikolai Tikhonov, the First Deputy Premier, acted on his behalf during his absence. When Tikhonov took command of the Soviet economy, Kosygin served in a standby role. At a Central Committee plenum in June 1980, the Soviet economic development plan was outlined by Tikhonov, and not Kosygin.|$|E
50|$|Benjamin Franklin, {{who was the}} U. S. <b>Minister</b> <b>to</b> France, {{had been}} {{appointed}} additionally as <b>Minister</b> <b>to</b> Sweden. He did not proceed to Stockholm and was not officially received by the court; thus he was not officially the <b>Minister</b> <b>to</b> Sweden. Nevertheless, he negotiated a treaty of friendship and recognition with Sweden.|$|R
5000|$|In 1897, President William McKinley named Rockhill U.S. <b>Minister</b> <b>to</b> Greece, a {{position}} he held from September 25, 1897, to April 27, 1899.
