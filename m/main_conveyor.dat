40|$|Of {{the sensory}} organs, {{the eyes are}} the most {{important}} and the most symbolic. They are usually interpreted as the gateway to the soul and regarded as the <b>main</b> <b>conveyors</b> of human emotions. The dark rings under the eyes, usually associated with physical tiredness, can also suggest a state of depression. However, in Byzantine and romantic portraits, such dark rings seem to increase the significance of the eyes as indicative of the intensity of spiritual life (Nanu, 2001 : 94). The eyes may also stand for clairvoyance or omniscience; they may be used as symbols of knowledge and creativity, light, vigilance, moral guidance and truth. Being organs of perception, the eyes represent one of the ways through which people have access to knowledge. In other words, seeing is equivalent to knowing (and knowing to having power). Through prayer, the eye turns into an organ of perception of the transcendental, divine world (de Souzenelle, 1999 : 372). Prayers or meditation can lead to the opening of a third and inner eye, symbolic of the intensification of spiritual life. In Hindu culture, and also in Buddhism, the third eye (also known as “the eye of Buddha”) is represented by the small dot between the eyes, its purpose being that of indicating spiritual awakenin...|$|R

40|$|Estimation of reliability, {{maintainability}} {{and availability}} assumes {{an important role}} in performance evolution of mining system or equipment. Reliability forecasts are necessary for every type of the machinery, similar to maintenance planning, production planning, reliability assessment, fault detection in the production system of mine, and risk evaluation. The mining system’s reliability, maintainability and availability have assumed great significance in present years due to a competitive environment and overall operating condition and production purpose. The performance of the system depends on reliability and availability of the machinery used, working environment, maintenance, operation process and specialized skill of operators, etc. The aim of the proposed study is to analyze operating reliability, maintainability and availability of the <b>main</b> <b>conveyor</b> system in an underground coal mine. The study uses the failure and repair data of the <b>main</b> <b>conveyor</b> system of Churcha (RO) coal mine in India. The <b>main</b> <b>conveyor</b> system in the mine has seven subsystems. This analysis has developed a method to identify the critical and sensitive subsystems or components of the <b>main</b> <b>Conveyor</b> system that need more attention for improvement. In this research work, we suggest the way to improve the reliability and availability of a repairable system. In the way, the concept of importance measures must be used to prioritize the components or subsystems for availability improvement processes. Availability significance measures the criticality of each component based on different points of view such as availability, failure rate, and repair rate of each subsystem. The reliability and availability of repairable systems can be enhanced by applying proper maintenance strategies. For each subsystem, best fit models were selected for reliability and maintainability analyses. The empirical data of the conveyor system at Churcha (RO) mine of SECL are used as a case study for reliability, availability and maintainability strategies analysis. The study shows that the reliability and maintainability analysis is greatly helpful for deciding maintenance intervals, planning and organizing maintenance of <b>main</b> <b>conveyor</b> system in the mine.

40|$|Effective use of {{machinery}} and maintenance planning requires improving of situational awareness and knowing {{the condition of}} the machinery. In mineral and aggregate industry, the maintenance is traditionally performed according to fixed time intervals or when the machines break down. One implemented solution for improving situational awareness is different kind of remote monitoring solutions. Knowing {{the condition of the}} machines improves the up-time and helps to prevent unexpected failures of the machines that work in difficult conditions. There are various condition monitoring products and services on the market, but they may not fulfil directly all of the requirements of this industry. It may therefore be a risk that the condition monitoring may not be comprehensive enough, if they are implemented with those commercial services. The goal of this work is divided in three research questions. The focus of the work is on the first one. The question number one is associated with searching of condition monitoring applications, which are application specific for mineral and aggregate industry. In this context, this work reviews different condition monitoring methods, but the actual measurements are implemented by using vibration sensors. The found application specific condition monitoring methods are tested by designing and implementing measurement setup. The measurement setup is installed on a mobile crushing unit – Metso Lokotrack LT 106. The measurement setup includes measuring of machine orientation, monitoring of a frame bearing of the crusher and monitoring vibration of machine’s <b>main</b> <b>conveyor.</b> The used data-analysis methods are calculating the machine frame orientation by using the measured direction of gravity, monitoring of vibration root-mean-square velocity, envelope analysis of bearing high-frequency vibration and analysis of vibration frequency spectrum. The second research question estimates the minimum hardware requirements for the measurements, so that the desired phenomena can be reliably detected. The third question is to assess the economic feasibility of the selected measurements. Based on the results of this work, the current single point measurement of unit orientation is insufficient solution. Elastic frame may twist too much during use of the machine, and the operator may not notice it. On the other hand, inclination of the machine may change excessively during the use, if the ground under the machine sinks. In case of the crusher frame bearing, the result of envelope analysis indicates developing faults in a rolling element and inner race of the bearing. In turn, monitoring of the vibration root-mean-square velocity of the <b>main</b> <b>conveyor</b> does detect excessive vibration during the monitoring period, which is quite expected result, because the conveyor is accurately designed by using Finite element method. Based on the results, the orientation of the machine would be worthwhile to implement as commercial product, as well as the crusher bearing condition monitoring...|$|E
40|$|The {{field of}} {{reliability}} engineering is developing, as {{needed in the}} industry. This is especially in arctic regions which now are being explored and vast recourses and opportunities are found. The reliability research is limited in the arctic, little knowledge is known about operating in the arctic regions. This research study will analyze equipment in an arctic region, Svalbard. It calculates the effects of operational conditions {{and the availability of}} a conveyor system found in a coal mine in Svalbard. The aim of the thesis is to understand the availability for the system and try to make a practical impact on the operations in the coal mine. The study has used two types of reliability methods – parametric and non-parametric method. These approaches can be used to find the reliability with and without the operational conditions included in the analysis. Similar for both methods are that they depend heavily on the data available. It seems that the operational conditions data collection is rare or non-existing. The study has produced two papers in order to analyze the <b>main</b> <b>conveyor</b> systems and a Stacker. It found for one year of operation (2010) that the availability was 96, 44 %. Although this is a high availability, {{it was found that the}} reliability was low. A second analysis was done on the Stacker with consideration of operational conditions. It was found that during the winter season the hazard rate increased by 4, 78 times the design conditions. It was also found that if the Stacker’s performance operated like the other conveyors, this could save the company more than 3 million dollars.

40|$|A multi-scale {{approach}} {{was used to}} evaluate which spatial gradient of environmental variability is the most important in structuring zooplankton diversity in the West Spitsbergen Current (WSC). The WSC is the <b>main</b> <b>conveyor</b> of warm and biologically rich Atlantic water to the Arctic Ocean through the Fram Strait. The data set included 85 stratified vertical zooplankton samples (obtained from depths up to 1000 metres) covering two latitudinal sections (76 ° 30 'N and 79 °N) located across the multi-path WSC system. The results indicate that the most important environmental variables shaping the zooplankton structural and functional diversity and standing stock variability are those associated with depth, whereas variables acting in the horizontal dimension are of lesser importance. Multivariate analysis of the zooplankton assemblages, together with different univariate descriptors of zooplankton diversity, clearly illustrated the segregation of zooplankton taxa in the vertical plane. The epipelagic zone (upper 200 m) hosted plentiful, Oithona similis-dominated assemblages with a high proportion of filter-feeding zooplankton. Although total zooplankton abundance declined in the mesopelagic zone (200 - 1000 m), zooplankton assemblages in that zone were more diverse and more evenly distributed, with high contributions from both herbivorous and carnivorous taxa. The vertical distribution of integrated biomass (mg DW m- 2) indicated that the total zooplankton biomass in the epipelagic and mesopelagic zones was comparable. Environmental gradients acting in the horizontal plane, such as the ones associated with different ice cover and timing of the spring bloom, were reflected in the latitudinal variability in protist community structure and probably caused differences in succession in the zooplankton community. High abundances of Calanus finmarchicus in the WSC core branch suggest the existence of mechanisms advantageous for higher productivity or/and responsible for physical concentration of zooplankton. Our results indicate that regional hydrography plays a primary role in shaping zooplankton variability in the WSC {{on the way to the}} Arctic Ocean, with additional effects caused by biological factors related to seasonality in pelagic ecosystem development, resulting in regional differences in food availability or biological production between the continental slope and the deep ocean regions...|$|E
40|$|A {{climatology}} {{of moisture}} sources linked with Central American precipitation was computed based upon Lagrangian trajectories {{for the analysis}} period 1980 – 2013. The response of the annual cycle of precipitation in terms of moisture supply from the sources was analysed. Regional precipitation patterns are mostly driven by moisture transport from the Caribbean Sea (CS). Moisture supply from the eastern tropical Pacific (ETPac) and northern South America (NSA) exhibits a strong seasonal pattern but weaker compared to CS. The regional distribution of rainfall is largely influenced by a local signal associated with surface fluxes during {{the first part of}} the rainy season, whereas large-scale dynamics forces rainfall during the second part of the rainy season. The Caribbean Low Level Jet (CLLJ) and the Chocó Jet (CJ) are the <b>main</b> <b>conveyors</b> of regional moisture, being key to define the seasonality of large-scale forced rainfall. Therefore, interannual variability of rainfall is highly dependent of the regional LLJs to the atmospheric variability modes. The El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) was found to be the dominant mode affecting moisture supply for Central American precipitation via the modulation of regional phenomena. Evaporative sources show opposite anomaly patterns during warm and cold ENSO phases, as a result of the strengthening and weakening, respectively, of the CLLJ during the summer months. Trends in both moisture supply and precipitation over the last three decades were computed, results suggest that precipitation trends are not homogeneous for Central America. Trends in moisture supply from the sources identified show a marked north–south seesaw, with an increasing supply from the CS Sea to northern Central America. Long-term trends in moisture supply are larger for the transition months (March and October). This might have important implications given that any changes in the conditions seen during the transition to the rainy season may induce stronger precipitation trends...|$|R
40|$|International audience[1] The Ganga River {{is one of}} the <b>main</b> <b>conveyors</b> of sediments {{produced}} by Himalayan erosion. Determining the flux of elements transported through the system is essential to understand the dynamics of the basin. This is hampered by the chemical heterogeneity of sediments observed both in the water column and under variable hydrodynamic conditions. Using Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) acquisitions with sediment depth profile sampling of the Ganga in Bangladesh we build a simple model to derive the annual flux and grain size distributions of the sediments. The model shows that ca. 390 (± 30) Mt of sediments are transported on average each year through the Ganga at Haring Bridge (Bangladesh). Modeled average sediment grain size parameters D 50 and D 84 are 27 (± 4) and 123 (± 9) mm, respectively. Grain size parameters are used to infer average chemical compositions of the sediments owing to a strong grain size chemical composition relation. The integrated sediment flux is characterized by low Al/Si and Fe/Si ratios that are close to those inferred for the Himalayan crust. This implies that only limited sequestration occurs in the Gangetic floodplain. The stored sediment flux is estimated to c. a. 10 % of the initial Himalayan sediment flux by geochemical mass balance. The associated, globally averaged sedimentation rates in the floodplain are found to be ca. 0. 08 mm/yr and yield average Himalayan erosion rate of ca. 0. 9 mm/yr. This study stresses the need to carefully address the average composition of river sediments before solving large‐scale geochemical budgets. Citation: Lupker, M., C. France‐Lanord, J. Lavé, J.

40|$|The current {{backlash}} in Latin America against neoliberalism and its <b>main</b> <b>conveyors</b> {{present the}} International Financial Institutions (IFIs) with an inexorable dilemma to their financial and ideological authority. The book attempts {{to understand the}} implications of the current changes in Latin American political economy for the (power) relationships between the IFIs and the local actors. It does so by exploring the risks associated with the narrow approach and practices of the IFIs in their promotion of political and economic governance in developing countries. The book argues that ‘good’ governance can be an area of contestation {{at the same time that}} can become an area of political engagement between local actors and the IFIs. As such it is expected that the ways IFIs staff interact with the local actors will affect the likelihood of policy change. Drawing on the lessons from the power relations involving the IFIs and the local actors in the promotion of governance reforms in Argentina since the 1990 s, the book extends the analysis to the current challenges and dilemmas for the IFIs in face of the most recent redefinition of political and economic governance at the regional scale. Four guiding questions are covered in this book: to what extent the IFIs can affect models of the state and development? Can ‘good governance’ be imposed from outside? Who is governance good for? To what extent have the current political and economic trends in Latin America actually transformed power relationships between donors and recipient countries? In answering these questions, the book explores what ‘power’ currently means in the relationship between the IFIs and local actors in developing countries and the analytical implications for broader analysis of the complexities and tensions between sovereign authority, domestic policy processes and externally-driven demand...|$|R
40|$|M. Phil. The {{study was}} {{undertaken}} at Bosjesspruit, {{one of the}} Sasol Collieries, to investigate aspects {{that contribute to the}} degradation of coal. Bosjesspruit is penalised with more than nine million rands per year for fine coal that exceeds the set limits. Compliance to quality is the main reason. The cost is directly deducted from the profit. The quality of coal is of importance for the effectiveness of the gasifying process. A feasibility study has indicated that this study is viable. Various factors in the process were studied to identify the system deviations such as: coal bunkers, section and <b>main</b> <b>conveyor</b> belts, geology, production section activities and coal production equipment. A literature study was done and time was spent to become conversant with the coal transport system. The process is described from where the coal is mined, through the handling action up to where it is fed into the Sasol plant gasifiers. Several coal samples of the identified bottleneck areas were taken and analysed. The four main areas that were studied are: Loading actions at East 700 bunker. Incline shaft transfer chute. The horizontal bunker on surface. The South section conveyor chutes. The free-flow technology was researched and developed for an acceptable chute design. The design is now computerised and in use at Sasol Collieries. The current design and its restrictions are compared with the proposed designs to indicate the improvements. A detailed cost analysis was done to determine the expenditures such as: Penalties for fine coal. The cost of adaptability and redesign. - Forecast cost savings after the redesigns are implemented. - Cost to produce coal as well as the income for Bosjesspruit. An economical evaluation indicates that all the suggested solutions are economically justifiable. The results of the study indicate several suggested solutions to overcome the identified bottlenecks. It is further suggested that results of this study are also implemented at the other Sasol mines as well as the mines that are being developed...|$|E

Induction motor has a high starting torque while separately i n d u c t i o n motor can operate above the base speed in the line starting current. This paper compares study and highlights the effectiveness of the different proposed vector controlled methods for a line starting performance of induction motor model parameter, using both simulation and manufacturers measured experimental data. Simulation studies are conducted to the induction motor drives as to obtain the performance of DC series motor below base speed and the separately excited DC motor above speed[4]. A steady state and transient analysis of the induction motor is performed below and above base line starting current...|$|R
40|$|Based on Indonesian National Standard (SNI) No 3926 : 2008, {{egg weight}} is {{classified}} into three classifications: small (60 g). Nowadays egg grading process in Indonesia was still done manually. The {{objective of this}} research was for designing, constructing, and performance testing of egg sorting machine. The machine testing includes performance accuracy, machine capacity, and egg crack of the sorting result. The egg sorting machine consisted of five <b>main</b> parts: <b>conveyor</b> system, steering conveyor system, sorting conveyor system, and exit conveyor system. Test result showed that the machine could sort the egg with accuracy of 83 % without any cracking in eggshell. The machine capacity was most affected by the speed of sorting conveyor system. The variables which influence the speed of sorting conveyor system were initial speed rotation (Na), work speed rotation (Nb), and length of the track on initial speed rotation path (L). The maximum machine capacity was 61 eggs per minute and obtained by configuration of Na, Nb, and L of 15. 5 rpm, 24. 5 rpm, and 6 cm respectively...|$|R
