40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Mucopolysaccharidosis</b> type <b>I</b> is an {{autosomal}} recessive disorder caused by deficiency of α-L-iduronidase and {{characterized by a}} progressive course with multisystem involvement. Clinically, <b>Mucopolysaccharidosis</b> type <b>I</b> is classified into two forms: severe (Hurler syndrome), which presents in infancy and is characterized by rapid progressive neurological involvement and attenuated (Hurler/Scheie and Scheie syndromes), which presents with slower progression and absent to mild nervous system involvement. The specific treatment for attenuated <b>Mucopolysaccharidosis</b> type <b>I</b> consists of enzyme-replacement therapy with laronidase (human recombinant α-L-iduronidase, Aldurazyme). We present here the clinical and laboratory results in an 12 -year-old patient affected by the attenuated form of <b>Mucopolysaccharidosis</b> type <b>I</b> treated by enzyme-replacement therapy {{from the age of}} 5 months, compared with his 17 year old affected sister, who started therapy at 5 years of age. CASE PRESENTATION: Clinical evaluation of these siblings shows that initiation of therapy prior of the onset of clinically detectable disease resulted in considerable improvement in outcome in the young sibling. After 12 years of enzyme-replacement therapy, facial appearance, linear growth rate, and liver and spleen volumes were normal; moreover, the degree of joint disease, vertebral, and cardiac valvular involvement were only minimal compared with those of his sister. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that early diagnosis and early initiation of enzyme-replacement therapy substantially modify the natural history of the attenuated form of <b>Mucopolysaccharidosis</b> type <b>I...</b>|$|R
40|$|<b>Mucopolysaccharidosis</b> Type <b>I</b> is a {{lysosomal}} storage disorder {{with varying}} degrees of phenotypic severity caused by mutations in IDUA. Over 200 disease-causing variants in IDUA have been reported. We describe the profile of disease-causing variants in 291 individuals with <b>Mucopolysaccharidosis</b> Type <b>I</b> for whom IDUA sequencing was performed, focussing on the UK subset of the cohort.

Gene expression in carotid artery, ascending, and descending aortas from four non-tolerized, non-enzyme treated 19 month-old <b>mucopolysaccharidosis</b> type <b>I</b> dogs was compared with expression in corresponding vascular segments from three normal, age-matched dogs. Data were analyzed using R and whole genome network correlation analysis, a bias-free method of categorizing expression level and significance into discrete modules.

Expression of clusterin, a protein implicated in other etiologies of cardiovascular disease, was assessed in canine and murine <b>mucopolysaccharidosis</b> type <b>I</b> aortas via Western blot and in situ immunohistochemistry. Gene families with more than two-fold, significant increased expression involved lysosomal function, proteasome function, and immune regulation.

40|$|<b>Mucopolysaccharidosis</b> <b>I</b> is a {{lysosomal}} storage disorder {{caused by}} a deficiency of the lysosomal hydrolase alpha-l-iduronidase, which {{is required for the}} degradation of heparan sulphate and dermatan sulphate. Given the wide spectrum of disease severity in <b>mucopolysaccharidosis</b> <b>I</b> patients, one of the challenges for managing the disorder is to accurately predict clinical phenotype. Enzyme replacement therapy by intravenous infusion is unlikely to make a significant impact on central nervous system pathology and patients displaying this clinical manifestation may respond better to bone marrow transplantation. In order to predict whether <b>mucopolysaccharidosis</b> <b>I</b> patients are going to develop central nervous system pathology, we investigated a number of biochemical parameters in cultured skin fibroblasts from patients of different genotype/phenotype. Residual levels of alpha-l-iduronidase activity and protein were determined using sensitive immune-quantification assays and fibroblast cell extracts from patients with central nervous system pathology generally had lower levels of alpha-l-iduronidase than patients with no evidence of central nervous system disease. A total of 15 oligosaccharides, derived from heparan sulphate and dermatan sulphate, was measured in fibroblast extracts using electrospray-ionisation tandem mass spectrometry and all were shown to discriminate <b>mucopolysaccharidosis</b> <b>I</b> from controls. Of these, two trisaccharides were able to group patients based on the presence/absence of central nervous system disease. Moreover, a ratio of alpha-l-iduronidase activity to these trisaccharides provided clear discrimination between <b>mucopolysaccharidosis</b> <b>I</b> patients with and without central nervous system pathology.

40|$|The {{catabolism}} of glycosaminoglycans {{begins with}} endo-hydrolysis of polysaccharides to oligosaccharides {{followed by the}} sequential action of an array of exoenzymes to reduce these oligosaccharides to monosaccharides and inorganic sulfate. In a lysosomal storage disorder known as mucopoly-saccharidosis I, caused by a deficiency of the exohydrolase a-L-iduronidase, fragments of two different glycosamino-glycans,dermatansulfateandheparan sulfate,havebeenshown to accumulate. Oligosaccharides isolated from the urine of a <b>mucopolysaccharidosis</b> <b>I</b> patient using anion exchange and gel filtration chromatography were identified as di-, tri-, tetra-, penta-, and hexasaccharides using electrospray ionization± tandem mass spectrometry and shown to have nonreducing terminal a-L-iduronate residues, susceptible to digestion with a-L-iduronidase. The presence of odd and even oligosacchar-ides suggests both endo-b-glucuronidase and endo-N-acetyl-hexosaminidase activities toward both glycosaminoglycans. Cultured skin fibroblasts from <b>mucopolysaccharidosis</b> <b>I</b> patients accumulate the same dermatan sulfate ± and heparan sulfate±derived di- and trisaccharides as identified in urine, and supplementation of culture medium with recombinant a-L-iduronidase reduced their level to that of unaffected control fibroblasts.

We compared the values for patients' samples with those for samples from normal human controls. FINDINGS: Before enzyme-replacement therapy, all patients had low serum antibody titres to recombinant human alpha-L-iduronidase that were within the control range. Five of the ten patients produced higher-than-normal titres of antibody to the replacement protein during the treatment course (serum antibody titres 130000 - 500000 and high-affinity epitope reactivity).

We aimed to investigate whether the mass spectrometry methodology for lysosomal storage disease screening, originally developed for newborns, can also discriminate between affected patients and controls of various ages. METHODS: A total of 205 control individuals were grouped according to age and subjected to mass spectrometry quantification of lysosomal &# 945;-glucosidase, &# 946;-glucocerebrosidase, &# 945;-galactosidase, acid sphingomyelinase, galactocerebrosidase, and &# 945;&# 8722;L-iduronidase activities.

However, {{in previous studies}} we failed to attain reliable long-term alpha-L-iduronidase expression in immunocompetent mice. Here, we focused on achieving sustained high-level expression in immunocompetent C 57 BL/ 6 mice. In our standard liver-directed treatment we hydrodynamically infuse mice with plasmids containing a SB transposon-encoding human alpha-L-iduronidase, along with a source of SB transposase. We sought to 1) minimize expression of the therapeutic enzyme in antigen-presenting cells, while avoiding promoter shutdown and gender bias, 2) increase transposition efficiency and 3) improve immunosuppression. By using a liver-specific promoter to drive IDUA expression, the SB 100 X hyperactive transposase and transient cyclophosphamide immunosuppression we achieved therapeutic-level (> 100 wild-type) stabilized expression for 1 year in 50 % of C 57 BL/ 6 mice.

The available treatments - enzyme replacement therapy and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT) - can ameliorate most disease manifestations, but their outcome on the skeletal and brain disease could be further improved. We here demonstrate that hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) gene therapy based on lentiviral vectors (LV) completely corrects the disease manifestations in the mouse model. Of note, the therapeutic benefit provided by gene therapy on critical MPS I manifestations, such as the neurological and skeletal disease, greatly exceeds the one exerted by HCT, the standard of care treatment for Hurler patients. Interestingly, therapeutic efficacy of HSC gene therapy is strictly dependent from the achievement of supra-normal enzyme activity in the hematopoietic system of transplanted mice, which allows enzyme delivery to the brain and skeleton for disease correction.
