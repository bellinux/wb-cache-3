This {{variety of}} performances is often related {{to differences in}} sucrose responsiveness, which determines learning performance. Sucrose responsiveness is partly determined genetically. We studied {{for the first time}} effects of paternal genes on associative learning independent of sucrose responsiveness. To do this, we used wild-type workers stemming from five unrelated patrilines. Bees of the patrilines were first tested for sucrose responsiveness. Only bees with equal sucrose responsiveness were analysed for associative olfactory learning, memory and discrimination. The bees of different patrilines did not differ in their acquisition, <b>memory</b> or discrimination <b>of</b> <b>odours</b> when they had similar sucrose responsiveness. But patrilines differed significantly in their sucrose responsiveness. This shows genetic effects on sensory responsiveness but no independent effects on associative learning...|$|R
40|$|Learning {{can rely}} on {{stimulus}} quality, stimulus intensity, {{or a combination of}} these. Regarding olfaction, the coding <b>of</b> <b>odour</b> quality is often proposed to be combinatorial along the olfactory pathway, and working hypotheses are available concerning short-term associative <b>memory</b> trace formation <b>of</b> <b>odour</b> quality. However, it is less clear how odour intensity is coded, and whether olfactory memory traces include information about the intensity <b>of</b> the learnt <b>odour.</b> Using odour-sugar associative conditioning in larval Drosophila, we first describe the dose-effect curves <b>of</b> learnability across <b>odour</b> intensities for four different odours (n-amyl acetate, 3 -octanol, 1 -octen- 3 -ol and benzaldehyde). We then chose odour intensities such that larvae were trained at an intermediate odour intensity, but were tested for retention with either that trained intermediate odour intensity, or with respectively higher or lower intensities. We observed a specificity of retention for the trained intensity for all four odours used. This adds to the appreciation of the richness in 'content' <b>of</b> olfactory short-term <b>memory</b> traces, even in a system as simple as larval Drosophila, and to define the demands on computational models <b>of</b> associative olfactory <b>memory</b> trace formation.

40|$|The {{ability of}} salmon to home {{accurately}} to their natal stream to spawn has long intrigued biologists and has important {{consequences for the}} maintenance of population structure in these species. It is known that olfaction is crucial to homing, and that the transition from the freshwater to the marine environment (the parrâ€“smolt transformation; PST) is a period of increased olfactory sensitivity and learning, resulting in a permanent <b>memory</b> <b>of</b> natal site <b>odours</b> that is retained, at least in part, in peripheral sensory neurones. These odours are then used as cues by sexually maturing fish on their homeward migration. We used quantitative polymerase chain reaction techniques to demonstrate transient increases in expression of odorant receptor transcripts (of up to fifty-fold over pre-PST levels) coincident with PST. Both olfactory (SORB) and vomeronasal receptors (SVRA and SVRC) are involved, which suggests that the fish learn both environmental odours and semiochemicals (pheromones). Receptor expression varies between families and changes over time indicating both genetic differences in odour stimuli and multiple periods of olfactory sensitivity.

This dissertation, taking as its corpus Les Rougon-Macquart, explores this issue. The working hypothesis is that Zola reveals his impressionist tendencies {{in this type of}} description. The first chapter presents a brief history of the status of olfaction and description <b>of</b> <b>odour</b> in its philosophical, social as well as in literary context. The following chapter, after having defined a few concepts (notions from Hamon and Adam), presents the status of the description <b>of</b> <b>odour</b> in Zola's work. Four recurrent devices emerge: redundancy, multi-sensorial description, clausulae and turning points. The third chapter begins the study of the internal working of the description by examining the lexicon <b>of</b> <b>odour.</b> The lexicon <b>of</b> <b>odour</b> as used by Zola resorts mostly to the emotional and poetical functions of language. The final chapter continues the examination of modes of structuration, using Adam's notion of plan of text.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the representation <b>of</b> <b>odour</b> throughout European literary modernism and other, interrelated fields of cultural production. While the introduction acknowledges Western cultureâ€™s traditional subordination of olfaction and smellâ€™s ostensible alienation from language, this study argues that odour and language simultaneously display compelling similarities. Chapter One examines Freudâ€™s influence {{in determining the}} modern conception of olfaction, as a figure of comparison with D. H. Lawrence and Bronislaw Malinowski. Freudâ€™s placement <b>of</b> <b>odour</b> as culturally and evolutionarily retrograde is questioned in Chapter Two, which notes the projected technological mastery of olfaction as a trope of utopian fiction, demonstrated {{in the writing of}} Aldous Huxley and John Gloag. Chapter Three shifts away from the identification of malodour as a source of modern anxiety to consider the dual commercial and aesthetic significance of perfume. However, these divergent encodings <b>of</b> <b>odour</b> are unified by literary modernismâ€™s persistent recruitment of olfaction as a metaphorical resource; the language <b>of</b> <b>odour</b> denotes a perceived inarticulable quiddity {{at the heart of the}} aesthetic object, a feature offered theoretical context by the writing of Walter Benjamin. Chapters Four and Five develop the congruence between the formal properties <b>of</b> <b>odour</b> and language by addressing â€˜canonicalâ€™ modernist literary encodings of olfaction. Proustâ€™s elision of the role of the sensorily-informed writer with that of the translator supports the consonance <b>of</b> language and <b>odour,</b> a contention further extended in Chapter Five, which considers the olfactory representations of Joyce, and his recognition of the ambiguous semiology <b>of</b> <b>odour</b> as a marker of personal identity. Finally, a conclusion emphasises this studyâ€™s extension of the field of modernist olfactory representation beyond Joyce and Proust. The shared semiological instability exhibited by odours and language supports the broader recuperation of olfaction as a particularly apposite modernist sense modality...|$|R
40|$|Odour {{emissions}} are episodic, characterised by periods of high emission rates, interspersed with periods of low emissions. It is frequently the short term, high concentration peaks {{that result in}} annoyance in the surrounding population. Dispersion modelling is accepted as {{a useful tool for}} odour impact assessment, and two approaches can be adopted. The first approach of modelling the hourly average concentration can underestimate total odour concentration peaks, resulting in annoyance and complaints. The second modelling approach involves the use of short averaging times. This study assesses the appropriateness of using different averaging times to model the dispersion <b>of</b> <b>odour</b> from a landfill site. We also examine perception <b>of</b> <b>odour</b> in the community in conjunction with the modelled odour dispersal, by using community monitors to record incidents <b>of</b> <b>odour.</b> The results show that with the shorter averaging times, the modelled pattern of dispersal reflects the pattern <b>of</b> observed <b>odour</b> incidents recorded in the community monitoring database, with the modelled odour dispersing further in a north easterly direction. Therefore, the current regulatory method of dispersion modelling, using hourly averaging times, is less successful at capturing peak concentrations, and does not capture the pattern <b>of</b> <b>odour</b> emission as indicated by the community monitoring database. The use of short averaging times is therefore of greater value in predicting the likely nuisance impact <b>of</b> an <b>odour</b> source and in framing appropriate regulatory controls...|$|R

40|$|Continuous odour {{measurements}} are seldom realised, {{mainly because of}} their high costs. They are therefore often substituted by chemical concentration measurements of odorous substances. Then a conversion of the chemical concentrations C (mg m- 3) into odour concentrations OC (ouE m- 3) is necessary. Several methods are in use for the conversion: the chemical concentration C, the sum <b>of</b> <b>odour</b> activity value SOAV, the sum <b>of</b> <b>odour</b> intensity SOI, the equivalent odour concentration EOC, and the sum <b>of</b> <b>odour</b> activity factor SOAF.

Results from the proposed approach confirmed the likelihood to adopt odour dispersion modeling, not only in the authorization phase, but as a tool for driving technical and managing actions in plant upgrade so to reduce impacts and improve the public acceptance. The upgrade actions in order to achieve the expected efficiency are reported as well...|$|R
40|$|The {{presence}} <b>of</b> background <b>odour</b> {{was found}} to have a small but significant effect on the sensitivity of the antennal olfactory system of houseflies, Musca domestica Linnaeus (Diptera: Muscidae), to new pulses <b>of</b> <b>odour.</b> We show that cross-adaptation and cross-sensitization between a background <b>odour</b> <b>of</b> (+/-) - 1 -octen- 3 -ol and pulses of (+/-) - 1 -octen- 3 -ol, 2 pentanone and R-(+) -limonene can occur, confirming that olfactory receptor cells are sensitive to different odours. Background odour can increase the responses to low concentration odour pulses and decrease the responses to higher concentration odour pulses. It is suggested that background odour has a larger effect on olfactory receptor cells that respond with a tonic increase of spike frequency, giving information about the level <b>of</b> <b>odour</b> concentration, i. e. the 'static' environment. Cells that respond in a phasic way only provide information on the dynamics of the olfactory environment...|$|R
40|$|When {{searching for}} {{resources}} in heterogeneous environments, animals {{must rely on}} their abilities to detect the resources via their sensory systems. However, variation in {{the strength of the}} sensory cue may be mediated by the physical size of the resource patch. Patch detection of insects are often predicted by the scaling of sensory cues to patch size, where visual cues has been proposed to scale proportional to the diameter of the patch. The scaling properties of olfactory cues are, however, virtually unknown. Here, we investigated scaling rules for olfactory information in a gradient <b>of</b> numbers <b>of</b> <b>odour</b> sources, relevant to odour-mediated attraction under field conditions. We recorded moth antennal responses to sex pheromones downwind from pheromone patches and estimated the slope in the scaling relationship between the effective length <b>of</b> the <b>odour</b> plumes and the number <b>of</b> <b>odour</b> sources. These measurements showed that the effective plume length increased proportional to the square root of the number <b>of</b> <b>odour</b> sources. The scaling relationship, as estimated in the field experiment, was then evaluated against field data of the slope in the relationship between trap catch and release rate of chemical attractants {{for a wide range of}} insects. This meta-analysis revealed an average slope largely consistent with the estimated scaling relationship between the effective plume length and the number <b>of</b> <b>odour</b> sources. This study is the first to estimate the scaling properties of olfactory cues empirically and has implications for understanding and predicting the spatial distributions of insects searching by means of olfactory cues in heterogeneous environments...|$|R
40|$|The issue <b>of</b> <b>odour,</b> {{greenhouse}} gas emissions and indoor air quality in swine buildings have become a great concern for the neighbouring communities as well as governments. Air dispersion models have been adopted widely as an approach to address these problems which determine science-based distance between livestock production site and neighbours. However, no existing model considers the diurnal and seasonal variations <b>of</b> <b>odour,</b> gas (ammonia, hydrogen sulphide, {{greenhouse gas}}), and dust concentrations and emissions, which may cause great uncertainty. The primary objective of this project is to monitor and model the diurnal and seasonal variations <b>of</b> <b>odour,</b> gases, and dust concentrations and emissions from nursery, farrowing, and gestation rooms. Additionally, this study tried to quantify the greenhouse gas contribution from swine buildings and evaluate the indoor air quality of swine barns. Strip-block experimental design {{was used to measure}} the diurnal variation <b>of</b> <b>odour</b> and gas concentrations and emissions in PSC Elstow Research Farm. It was found that: 1) odour and gas concentrations in winter were significantly higher than those in mild and warm weather conditions for all three rooms (P 0. 05); 3) significant diurnal variations occurred in August and April (P 0. 05); 4) apparent diurnal variation patterns were observed in August and April for NH 3, H 2 S and CO 2 concentrations, being high in the early morning and low in the late afternoon; 5) positive correlation was found between odour concentrations and NH 3, H 2 S, and CO 2 concentrations, respectively. A whole year (August 2006 to July 2007) monitoring <b>of</b> <b>odour,</b> gas and dust concentrations and emissions revealed that: 1) significant seasonal effect on odour and gas concentrations and emissions, total dust concentrations and dust depositions were observed (...|$|R
