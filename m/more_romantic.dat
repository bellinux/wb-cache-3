Aloya's death caused Arogo much pain and misery, and in his sorrow he could not stop crying. When his tears dried, the Chocolate Hills were formed.|$|E
25|$|The tone of {{the book}} is far <b>more</b> <b>romantic</b> and tragic than the average Simon Templar books. In most books of the series, the reader can know in advance that no matter what terrible threats and perils Templar would face, he would survive them all and live to have new adventures in the next book and the next.|$|E

500|$|In October 1868, La Périchole {{marked a}} {{transition}} in Offenbach's style, with less exuberant satire and <b>more</b> human <b>romantic</b> interest. Lamb calls it Offenbach's [...] "most charming" [...] score. There was some critical grumbling at the change, but the piece, with Schneider in the lead, did good business. It was quickly produced in Europe and both North and South America. Of the pieces that followed {{it at the}} end of the decade, Les brigands (1869) was another work that leaned <b>more</b> to <b>romantic</b> comic opera than to opéra bouffe. It was well received, but has not subsequently been revived as often as Offenbach's best-known operettas.|$|R

25|$|By the mid-seventies, much of Lee's work {{displayed}} a <b>more</b> <b>romantic,</b> soft-focus approach, {{similar to that}} of Sarah Moon and Deborah Turbeville, such as the hazy Selfridges/Bathers 1976 and the poignant Reflections 1975. Often displaying a surreal aspect, his Austin Reed/Rome 1976 appears to show men diving out of a swimming pool, whilst Ossie Clark/Aeroplane 1969 has the model wearing a floaty Ossie Clark dress, flying towards her mirror image flanked by a pair of fighter aircraft.|$|E
25|$|Deol {{has mostly}} acted in thriller films, often playing antiheroic {{characters}} who {{are forced to}} commit crime to avenge the deaths of loved ones. Examples of such films include Badal, Gupt, Jurm and Bichhoo. His films commonly involve themes of jealousy, deceit and revenge and his <b>more</b> <b>romantic</b> thrillers often involve him caught in love triangles. Some of his successful films are Barsaat (1995), Gupt (1997), Soldier (1998), Badal (2000), Bichhoo (2000), Ajnabee (2001), Humraaz (2002), Tango Charlie (2005), Apne (2007), and Yamla Pagla Deewana (2011).|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} other obelisks, many located in the south central portion near Ellicott's. Most are in a {{classical}} mode, with the Gothic cross on the grave of David Evans, Ellicott's nephew, a notable exception. The majority of the graves have markers typical of the 19th century, from simple marble headstones for the earlier graves to <b>more</b> <b>Romantic</b> markers later on {{with a wide variety}} of motifs in their funerary art. There are also polished granite markers from the early 20th century, and one of white zinc.|$|E
50|$|Along with A South Sea Bubble (1928), {{the film}} marked a {{significant}} change in the role played by Novello. He had previously appeared as unsettled, outsider figures in films such as The Lodger, but from now on played <b>more</b> well-balanced <b>romantic</b> figures.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{relationship}} between sexual orientation, self-described gender expression and preferred levels of gender expression in romantic partners with ischemic pain performance in healthy young women. It was hypothesized that lesbian and bisexual women would be less sensitive to pain than heterosexual women. It was also hypothesized that regardless of sexual orientation, women who endorse a preference for <b>more</b> feminine <b>romantic</b> partners and who describe themselves as more masculine would report higher pain thresholds, higher pain tolerance, and lower pain intensity levels than women who report attraction to <b>more</b> masculine <b>romantic</b> partners and rate themselves as possessing more feminine dispositions. A total of 172 women completed multiple assessments of identity and gender expression followed by an ischemic pain task. The study demonstrated that ischemic pain performance is associated with sexual orientation, dispositional gender expression, and preferred gender expression in romantic partners in healthy young women. Compared to heterosexual women, lesbian and bisexual women reported lower pain intensity ratings. Among heterosexual women, attraction to <b>more</b> feminine <b>romantic</b> partners was associated with lower pain intensity ratings early into the ischemic discomfort task, and there was a slight association between self-described masculinity and lower pain intensity ratings for heterosexual women. Similar associations emerged between attraction to <b>more</b> feminine <b>romantic</b> partners and higher pain tolerance in the heterosexual group and for dispositional masculinity and higher pain threshold and tolerance levels in the combined lesbian and bisexual group. These findings provide preliminary support for the hypothesis that, irrespective of biological sex, various other aspects of sexual identity are associated with ischemic pain performance...|$|R

25|$|Throughout the 1980s, {{question}} marks formed a constant motif, usually on the shirt collars or, {{in the case}} of the Seventh Doctor, on his sleeveless jumper and the handle to his umbrella. The idea was grounded in branding considerations, as was the movement starting in Tom Baker's final season toward an unchanging costume for each Doctor, rather than the variants on a theme employed over the first seventeen years of the programme. When the Eighth Doctor regenerated, he clad himself in a 19th-century frock coat and shirt based on a Wild Bill Hickok costume, reminiscent of the out-of-time quality of earlier Doctors and emphasising the Eighth Doctor's <b>more</b> <b>Romantic</b> persona.|$|E
25|$|In 2008 {{the city}} of Amsterdam started a project to improve the red light {{district}} in the old city centre. Noten participated with a street vending machine that sold red rings {{with a wide variety}} of designs for only €2.50. The rings were intended to be bought for the neighbourhood prostitutes by their clients. Noten called the project Be nice to a girl, buy her a ring and hoped it would improve the mutual respect between prostitutes and clients, and that it might even introduce a <b>more</b> <b>romantic</b> atmosphere in the red light district. Afterwards he offered the red rings, cased and numbered in a limited edition of 250 pieces, as true art objects for €310.00 each.|$|E
25|$|Natural {{history in}} India was made more popular through {{publications}} {{in the mass}} media. In southern India M. Krishnan who was a pioneering black-and-white wildlife photographer and artist wrote articles on various aspects {{of natural history in}} Tamil and English. His articles were well illustrated with his photographs and artwork. He wrote in a humorous style much like that of EHA before him. Professor K. K. Neelakantan was another writer who popularised the study of birds in Kerala by writing books and articles in Malayalam. Others like Harry Miller wrote in English in the local newspapers. Some others like Ruskin Bond wrote about the wilderness, the hills and the wildlife in a <b>more</b> <b>romantic</b> style.|$|E

25|$|However Tu felix Austria nube {{was perhaps}} <b>more</b> <b>romantic</b> than {{strictly}} realistic, since Maximilian was not slow {{to wage war}} when it suited his purpose. Having settled matters with France in 1493, he was soon involved in the long Italian Wars against France (1494–1559). In addition to the wars against the French, there were the wars for Swiss independence. The Swabian War of 1499 marked the last phase of this struggle against the Habsburgs. Following defeat at the Battle of Dornach in 1499, Austria was forced to recognise Swiss independence at the Treaty of Basel in 1499, a process that was finally formalised by the Peace of Westphalia in 1648. This was significant as the Habsburgs had originated in Switzerland, their ancestral home being Habsburg Castle.|$|E
25|$|The poem {{was rewritten}} from 1790 until 1834 and had six versions, with the 1834 version being the edition that is {{commonly}} {{provided for the}} poem. These were not corrections to the original poem, but instead a development of the themes and ideas along with changes in style, genre, and structure. These changes parallel Coleridge's own changing view of Chatterton. The original version, from 1790, was an imitation of 18th-century poetry written for school and follows the Pindaric ode form that ignores many of the structures of the Pindaric ode. The versions in-between shift to a <b>more</b> <b>Romantic</b> structure and then finally become Augustinian in the final version. As a whole, the poems can be broken into three sets: the 1790 Pindaric ode, the Romantic odes from 1794 until 1829, and the elegy from 1829 until the final publication in 1834.|$|E
25|$|Henze's {{music has}} {{incorporated}} neoclassicism, jazz, the twelve-tone technique, serialism, and some rock or popular music. Although he did study atonalism {{early in his}} career, after his move to Italy in 1953, Henze's music became considerably more Neapolitan in style. His opera König Hirsch ("The Stag King") contains lush, rich textures. This trend is carried further in the opulent ballet music that he wrote for English choreographer Frederick Ashton's Ondine, completed in 1957. While Mendelssohn and Weber were important influences, the music for Ondine contains some jazz and there is much in it redolent of Stravinsky—not only Stravinsky the neo-classical composer, but also the composer of The Rite of Spring. His Maratona di danza, on the other hand, required much tighter integration of jazz elements, complete with an on-stage band, which {{was very different from}} the <b>more</b> <b>romantic</b> Ondine. Henze received much of the impetus for his ballet music from his earlier job as ballet adviser at the Hessisches Staatstheater Wiesbaden.|$|E

25|$|On 16 February 1943, the Service du Travail Obligatoire (STO) {{organisation}} was created, {{requiring the}} call up of able-bodied French men {{to work in}} Germany. In the Reich, with so many men had been called up for service with the Wehrmacht and the very sexist Nazi regime reluctant to have German women work in factories as Hitler believed working damaged a woman's womb, so throughout the war the German state had a policy of bringing foreign workers to Germany to replace the men serving in the Wehrmacht. Reports had reached France (which were true) that at the Dora works near the Buchenwald concentration camp, about 10,000 slave workers, mostly French and Russian, had to work on building V2 rockets in a vast subterranean factory in living quarters meant to house only 2, 500 people, were allowed to sleep only four and half hours every night and were regularly brutalized by the guards. The chief pleasure of the slaves, both French and Russian, at the Dora works was urinating on the machinery when the guards were not looking. The underground press gave much coverage to the conditions at the Dora works, pointed out those Frenchmen who {{went to work in}} Germany were not paid the generous wages promised by the Organisation Todt and instead were turned into slaves, all of which the underground papers used as reasons for why the French should not go to work in Germany. Under the law of 16 February 1943 all able-bodied Frenchmen aged 20–22 who were not miners, farmers and university students had to report to the STO to do two years labour in Germany. As the occupation went on, service with the STO was widened with farmers and university students losing their exempt status until the point in 1944 was reached that all fit men aged 18–60 and women aged 18–45 were being called up for service with the STO. Men over 45 and all women serving in the STO were guaranteed not to go to Germany and many were called up with the STO were put to work building the Atlantic Wall for the Organisation Todt, but those called up with the STO {{had no way of knowing}} where they would go when they entered the ranks of the STO. The so-called réfractaires attempted to avoid being called up for the STO and often went into hiding rather work in the Reich. At least 40,000 Frenchmen (80% of the resistance were people under the age of thirty) fled to the countryside, becoming the core of the maquis guerrillas. Those who fled into the countryside rejected the term réfractaire with its connotations of laziness and called themselves the maquis, which originated as Corsican Italian slang for bandits, whose root word was macchia, which was the term for the scrubland and forests of Corsica. Those who lived in the macchia of Corsica were usually bandits, and those men fleeing to the countryside chose the term maquis as a <b>more</b> <b>romantic</b> and defiant term than réfractaire. By June 1943, the term maquis which had been a little known word borrowed from the Corsican dialect of Italian at the beginning of 1943 become widely known all over France. It was only in 1943 that guerilla warfare emerged in France as opposed to the more sporadic attacks against the Germans that had been going since the summer of 1941 and the resistance changed from an urban movement to a rural movement that was most active in central and southern France.|$|E

500|$|In Offenbach's last decade, he {{took note}} {{of a change in}} public taste: a simpler, <b>more</b> <b>romantic</b> style was now preferred.

[...] Offenbach followed suit in a series of 20 operettas; the conductor and musicologist Antonio de Almeida names the finest of these as La fille du tambour-major (1879).|$|E

500|$|Paul Sandby (1731–1809), often {{considered}} the [...] "father of British watercolour painting", visited Scotland {{as part of}} the military survey that followed the 1745 Jacobite rebellion and undertook a number of studies of Scottish scenes. His abandonment of traditional pen and ink drawing, using washes of colour in order to paint directly in watercolours without pen outlines, opened the way for the creation of powerful Romantic landscapes. Alexander Runciman (1736–1785) was probably the first artist to paint Scottish landscapes in watercolours in the <b>more</b> <b>romantic</b> style that was emerging {{towards the end of the}} eighteenth century.|$|E
