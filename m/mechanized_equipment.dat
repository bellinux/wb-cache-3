5|$|During World War I, Trait du Nord {{horses were}} among those confiscated by Germans from Belgium and France {{for use in the}} war. In 1919, these horses were {{returned}} to their homeland, allowing the reconstruction of the breed. During World War II, the armed forces used all stocks of fuel, and the draft horse was used to continue agricultural production in France. After the war, farmers quickly equipped themselves with <b>mechanized</b> <b>equipment.</b> The decline in the breeding of the Trait du Nord became noticeable in the early 1950s, and by 1960 breed numbers had collapsed completely. By the early 1970s, breeding had slowed so much that the Trait du Nord, along with other French draft breeds, was in danger of extinction.|$|E

Some other fires were too remote or in too steep terrain for the safe operation of heavy equipment, and bulldozers were prohibited from many areas because of the impact they have on surface features. Additionally, the thin, unstable ground near the park's geothermal features could not be trusted to support the weight of heavy equipment. Bulldozers are rarely used on fires in U.S. National Parks.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe Malaysian {{construction}} industry {{is vital for}} the country economy and always {{played a key role}} towards the development of national infrastructure. The ever-increasing market competitiveness and the widespread adoption of Industrialized Building System (IBS) by the local contractors derive the industry to improve the existing processes for achieving higher levels of quality and products. This transition from traditional methods of construction give a momentum to the deployment of onsite <b>mechanized</b> <b>equipments.</b> The utilization of <b>mechanized</b> <b>equipments</b> increases construction productivity and as well as reduces the dependency on foreign labour. However, a large amount of construction company's capital is also invested in procuring these equipments. In addition to this, varieties of construction equipments are also required for carrying out these operations. Therefore, the aim {{of this paper is to}} investigate the current awareness and application of onsite mechanization in Malaysian {{construction industry}}. A questionnaire survey was conducted among a classified group of Construction Industry Development Board of Malaysia (CIDB) G 7 Class ‘A’ contractors. The results of the survey show that there is a good understanding of Malaysian contractors towards mechanization. It is also revealed that the adoption of IBS have a direct correlation with the usage of onsite machineries and equipments. Results further indicate that excavation, earthworks, pilling works and structural works have high utilization of <b>mechanized</b> construction <b>equipments.</b> The study will help to find out the existing level of mechanization practices in Malaysian construction industry...|$|R

500|$|The peak use of {{the breed}} for {{agriculture}} was quite short, running from 1880 to around 1960 (ending due to increased use of <b>mechanized</b> <b>equipment),</b> but it allowed significant progress in agriculture in northern France. The stamina and energy of the breed allows them to perform well in the heavy and compact soils {{in the region of}} Nord-Pas-de-Calais and recover quickly after exercise. The nature of soils in Hainaut required a horse weighing more than [...] for effective plowing. Since the 1950s, the Trait du Nord has been the preferred breed for farmers who practiced intensive cropping of cereals and beets in the Northern Great Plains of France.|$|E

On August 8, Quebec premier Robert Bourassa had announced at a press conference that he had invoked Section 275 of the National Defence Act to requisition [...] military support in [...] "aid of the civil power". A right available to provincial governments that was enacted after one police officer and two Mohawk were killed during the conflict. The Chief of the Defence Staff, General John de Chastelain placed Federal, Quebec-based troops in support of the provincial authorities. During Operation Salon some 2,500 regular and reserve troops were mobilized. Troops and <b>mechanized</b> <b>equipment</b> mobilized at staging areas around Oka and Montreal, while reconnaissance aircraft staged air photo missions over Mohawk territory to gather intelligence.

2500|$|The {{subcontracting}} of MSW {{collection to}} foreign companies had an immediate negative {{impact upon the}} Zabbaleen community as documented in Mai Iskander's film, Garbage Dreams. Contracting out MSW to foreign companies meant that the Zabbaleen would lose access to garbage, which was {{the basis of their}} recycling and sorting activities. In the documentary Garbage Dreams, Laila, a social worker in Mokattam Village, says, [...] "The city contracted with foreign waste disposal companies because they perceived the Zabbaleen to be old-fashioned. But they didn't come tell us, [...] "You need to modernize your ways." [...] This was all done behind our backs. [...] "we're replacing you with the companies." [...] So we can be like the developed countries." [...] In contrast, because officials from the Cairo Cleaning and Beautification Authority (CCBA) regarded the Zabbaleen recycling methods as unhygienic and backwards, they were optimistic about the process and hoped for a positive impact on Cairo's environment. However, because the <b>mechanized</b> <b>equipment</b> of the foreign companies are too large for the streets of Cairo, citizens were required to bring their trash to designated collection centers and bins, which were not always placed in easily accessible locations. Therefore, residents preferred to continue to have their trash picked up from their doors by the Zabbaleen, who were able to come directly to their doors even if their homes were located in narrow alleys. Eventually, the foreign companies realized that they needed the Zabbaleen and thus, subcontracted them. This system failed, however, because the companies underpaid the Zabbaleen. According to Fahmi and Sutton, [...] "while company sources mention salaries ranging between LE 300 to LE 450 per month (US $50–$75), some Zabbaleen claim that the salaries on offer are actually closer to LE 150 per month." [...] One Zabbal with eight children gave a similar figure: whereas he used to make LE 10 a day (US $1.60), foreign contractors offered him LE 5 a day.|$|E
