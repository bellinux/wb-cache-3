50|$|The average {{monaural}} {{sound system}} {{around the time}} of the production of Fantasia had a number of disadvantages. Their limited range in volume was ineffective as symphonic music was impaired by excessive ground noise and amplitude distortion. Their single point source of sound, though suitable for dialogue and action at the centre of the screen, caused music and sound effects to suffer from acoustic phase distortion which is absent when sound originates from multiple sources. Led by William E. Garity, the chief audio engineer at the Disney studios, technicians developed a <b>multi-channel</b> <b>reproduction</b> system that was dubbed Fantasound, a process that was to be a desirable alternative sound system.|$|E

Only exaggerated channel permutations produced significant downgrade of both qualities, furthermore without introducing appreciable changes of the apparent listening position. These results suggest that an accurate <b>multi-channel</b> <b>reproduction</b> of the frontal waves may not be crucial for determining the perceived quality of a digital piano...|$|E

This paper {{proposes a}} new sound field <b>reproduction</b> system. <b>Multi-channel</b> sound field <b>reproduction</b> {{is one of}} the most {{promising}} methods to realize a sound reproduction system robustly against a head movement. <b>Multi-channel</b> sound field <b>reproduction</b> can reproduce the same acoustic field as the recording area by using several controlled points. However, such sound field reproduction systems have not been developed due to poor understanding of the behavior of multiple channel systems. In this paper, we first investigate the accuracy of the reproduced sound of a <b>multi-channel</b> sound <b>reproduction</b> system. In particular we investigate the optimal loudspeaker arrangement and the optimal number of controlled points using computer simulation.

40|$|This article {{describes}} {{an approach to}} the problem of upmixing one-channel audio signals for <b>multi-channel</b> <b>reproduction.</b> The proposed method separates an ambient signal from an audio signal by computing the difference between the audio signal and a suitable approximation of the audio signal in the time-frequency domain. The approximation is derived by means of Non-negative Matrix Factorization minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence. A surround audio signal is generated by feeding the separated ambient signal into the rear channels. Results of extensive listening tests confirm the listeners' preference of the upmixed audio compared to unprocessed audio and competing upmix algorithms when played back on a 5. 0 system...|$|E

40|$|WESTPRAC VII 2000 : the 7 th West Pacific Regional Acoustics Conference, October 3 - 5, 2000, Kumamoto, Japan. In {{order to}} realize the <b>multi-channel</b> sound field <b>reproduction</b> system, it is {{indispensable}} to design inverse filters that remove the effect of room transfer functions. The design method in the frequency domain based on the least-norm-solution (LNS) is less memory and less calculation than the design method in the time domain. However, the LNS method cannot guarantee the causality and stability of the filters. In this paper, a design method of a time domain inverse filter using iterative processing in the frequency domain for <b>multi-channel</b> sound field <b>reproduction</b> is proposed, and the numerical analysis result is described. The proposed method can decrease the squared error for every sensor by 3 - 12 dB. Furthermore, the reproduced sound by this method attains over 13 dB improvement in the segmental SNR compared with one designed by the LNS method for real environment impulse responses...|$|R
40|$|During recent years, auralization {{methods have}} evolved towards using more {{interactive}} measures. The use of interactive elements, like navigation in static sound fields, {{has proven to}} be very significant in order to better integrate the listener with the simulated soundscape. In this study the possibility of engaging the user by actively contributing to the sound field is explored. Enabling the subject to act as a sound source and allowing communication within the environment, utilizing real-time synthesis of an acoustic environment's response. Auralization allows for a psychoacoustic evaluation of the acoustical space and therefore plays an important part in a wider understanding of different environmental characteristics. With an auralization framework adapting this kind of interaction, experience of the acoustical response is enabled and can thus be used as a tool in the process of subjectively assessing the acoustical space. Real-time convolution software implementing this mode of procedure has been designed. A subjective evaluation has been performed using a listening room equipped with an ambisonics <b>multi-channel</b> <b>reproduction</b> system, and a directional microphone with feedback control. Evaluation results indicate a positive response from the subjects to the added control over the simulated space...|$|E

40|$|Perception of the {{acoustic}} environment places all sound {{events in a}} three-dimensional soundfield, surrounding us wherever we are and changing as we move through acoustic space. Creating music for electronic reproduction requires a detailed understanding of sound in space, how it evolves over time, how it interacts with the physical space and how acoustic space itself may become a compositional tool. This paper will review human spatial perception and the physical parameters that must be understood and controlled to create clarity, depth, spatial impression and envelopment in an electro-acoustic recording, with particular reference to <b>multi-channel</b> surround <b>reproduction</b> environments. Methods for creating natural, or even unnatural, acoustic spaces in a recording will be presented.

40|$|A {{very fast}} FFT-based {{deconvolution}} method, which combines the well-known principles of least squares optimisation and regularisation, {{can be used}} for inverting systems comprising any number of inputs and outputs. The method was developed for the purpose of designing digital filters for <b>multi-channel</b> sound <b>reproduction.</b> It is typically several hundred times faster than a conventional steepest descent algorithm implemented in the time domain. A matrix of causal inverse FIR (finite impulse response) filters is calculated by optimising the performance of the filters at a large number of discrete frequencies. Consequently, this deconvolution method is useful only when it is feasible in practice to use relatively long inverse filters. The circular convolution effect in the time domain is controlled by zeroth-order regularisation of the inversion problem. It is necessary to set the regularisation parameter β to an appropriate value, but the exact value of β is usually not critical. For single-channel systems, a reliable numerical method for determining β without the need for subjective assessment is given. The deconvolution method is based on the analysis of a matrix of exact least squares inverse filters. The positions of the poles of those filters are shown to be particularly important...|$|R
40|$|The {{perceived}} spread (or width) of a {{sound source}} is an important attribute of an audio object that should be controlled by a <b>multi-channel</b> audio <b>reproduction</b> system. It is desirable to either synthesize a plausible spread {{of a sound}} object or to maintain a constant spread when the virtual source moves. Existing sound spreading techniques such as Multiple Direction Amplitude Panning (MDAP) or time-frequency decomposition typically do {{not account for the}} specific loudspeaker arrangement and the inherent source spread generated by this layout. In this paper we propose an optimization-based sound field control approach, termed the ` 1 /` 2 method, to adjust the spread of a sound source. To this end we use the velocity vector magnitude to quantify the desired source spread. Based on the equivalence between amplitude panning and the maximization of this vector, the control of the source spread is formulated as a convex optimization problem. We show how the velocity objective function and additional constraints affect the resulting loudspeaker gain distribution. The proposed approach can be integrated into amplitude panning systems, and allows for either a position-independent spread of moving sources or for a smooth and continuous control of the spread parameter...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe World Soundscape Project (WSP) was {{established}} {{as an educational}} and research group at Simon Fraser University during the early 1970 s and documented soundscapes in Canada and Europe {{as part of an}} over-arching concern {{to draw attention to the}} importance of the sonic environment. One unique feature of the WSP collection of recordings is its longitudinal documentation of the Vancouver Soundscape over a 40 -year period, with recordings from the 1970 s, 1990 s and the present day. Over that same period, soundscape composition practices have evolved from a documentary mode to an artistic practice. <b>Multi-channel</b> audio <b>reproduction</b> currently provides listeners with a highly immersive auditory experience that has greatly benefitted the practice of soundscape composition by creating esthetically enhanced experiences that are based in real-world experience but move the listener into an abstracted or even a completely imaginary space. The concept and perception of acoustic space is discussed, as well as issues of creating such spaces electroacoustically, with examples drawn from the composers practice. The presentation discusses how the artistic use of created acoustic space can relate to (and potentially enhance) our understanding of the human relationships to real-world soundscapes, and hence acoustic ecology...|$|R
40|$|In {{the context}} of {{spectral}} color image <b>reproduction</b> by <b>multi-channel</b> inkjet printing a key challenge is to accurately model the colorimetric and spectral behavior of the printer. A common approach for this modeling is {{to assume that the}} resulting spectral reflectance of a certain ink combination can be modeled as a convex combination of the so-called Neugebauer Primaries (NPs); this is known as the Neugebauer Model. Several extensions of this model exist, such as the Yule-Nielsen Modified Spectral Neugebauer (YNSN) model. However, as the number of primaries increases, the number of NPs increases exponentially; this poses a practical problem for <b>multi-channel</b> spectral <b>reproduction.</b> In this work, the well known Kubelka-Munk theory is used to estimate the spectral reflectances of the Neugebauer Primaries instead of printing and measuring them, and subsequently we use these estimated NPs as the basis of our printer modeling. We have evaluated this approach experimentally on several different paper types and on the HP Deskjet 1220 C CMYK inkjet printer and the Xerox Phaser 7760 CMYK laser printer, using both the conventional spectral Neugebauer model and the YNSN model. We have also investigated a hybrid model with mixed NPs, half measured and half estimated. Using this approach we find that we achieve not only cheap and less time consuming model establishment, but also, somewhat unexpectedly, improved model precision over the models using the real measurements of the NPs...|$|R
