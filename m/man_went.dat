5|$|A {{tropical}} storm watch was issued for Bermuda on August27 but swiftly canceled {{the next day}} as Danielle steered well clear of the island. Swells from the powerful hurricane reached the East Coast of the United States, leading to the rescues of 250 people in Ocean City, Maryland and an additional 70 people {{off the coast of}} Central Florida. The body of a man—whose death appeared to have been from drowning—was pulled from the waters of Satellite Beach, Florida; a second <b>man</b> <b>went</b> missing in Ocean City, but his body was never recovered and the search was eventually called off. Researchers examining the wreckage of RMS Titanic were forced to seek refuge in St. John's, Newfoundland; swells as large as 10ft (3m) impacted the coastline of Newfoundland.|$|E
500|$|Scott Wells, {{a racing}} correspondent, wrote in The Speedhorse Magazine that <b>Go</b> <b>Man</b> <b>Go</b> [...] "grew up lean and hard-boned, long-bodied and long-hipped, {{but not the}} best looking horse in the world. Not the best looking, just the best." [...] <b>Go</b> <b>Man</b> <b>Go</b> had a {{reputation}} for being difficult to handle. His trainer once told Walt Wiggins, Sr. that <b>Go</b> <b>Man</b> <b>Go</b> was [...] "jes plain mean as a bear most of the time". Throughout his racing career, <b>Go</b> <b>Man</b> <b>Go</b> stayed mean. One of his jockeys, Robert Strauss, recalled later that <b>Go</b> <b>Man</b> <b>Go</b> [...] "was ornery from the day I met him, but he was the greatest horse I ever rode".|$|R
500|$|In 1955, when <b>Go</b> <b>Man</b> <b>Go</b> was a two-year-old, A.B. Green bragged that he {{intended}} to buy the horse from Ferguson. [...] Although Ferguson did not want to sell, he felt he had to at least set a price. [...] After hearing rumors that Green was prepared with a cashier's check for $40,000 (approximately $ as of [...] ), Ferguson set the price at $42,000 cash (approximately $ as of [...] ) and twenty-onebreedings to the stallion. To Ferguson's surprise, Green had that much cash available; Ferguson felt compelled to sell <b>Go</b> <b>Man</b> <b>Go.</b> Two years later, at a Los Alamitos race meet, Green claimed that his newest horse, Double Bid, could outrace <b>Go</b> <b>Man</b> <b>Go.</b> This incensed Ferguson, who had just entered <b>Go</b> <b>Man</b> <b>Go's</b> full brother Mr Mackay in a race with Double Bid. Ferguson bet Green $42,000 (approximately $ as of [...] ) against <b>Go</b> <b>Man</b> <b>Go</b> that Mr Mackay would beat Double Bid in the upcoming race. Mr Mackay won the race, and Ferguson regained ownership of <b>Go</b> <b>Man</b> <b>Go.</b> Later in 1960, because he also owned <b>Go</b> <b>Man</b> <b>Go's</b> full brother, father, and mother, he sold <b>Go</b> <b>Man</b> <b>Go</b> to Frank Vessels Sr. and Bill and Harriet Peckham for $125,000 (approximately $ as of [...] ).

After hearing from Wright that he would not call the police because he feared for his life, Curtis Jones placed a call to the Leflore County sheriff, and another to his mother in Chicago. Distraught, she called Emmett's mother Mamie Till Bradley. Wright and his wife Elizabeth drove to Sumner, where Elizabeth's brother contacted the sheriff.|$|E
5|$|On 22 May 1816, a {{group of}} 56{{residents}} met at The Globe Inn in Littleport to discuss the lack of work and rising grain costs. Fuelled by alcohol, the residents directed their anger at local farmer Henry Martin. He had been overseer of the poor in 1814 and was not well liked by the parishioners. One <b>man</b> <b>went</b> to get a horn from Burgess, the lighterman, and started blowing it outside The Globe Inn, gathering hundreds of villagers to join the first group, and the riot commenced.|$|E

500|$|As a {{breeding}} stallion, <b>Go</b> <b>Man</b> <b>Go</b> {{continued to have}} {{a reputation as a}} scoundrel, although Kathlyn Green, wife of A. B. Green, disputed that image.

However, she said of him [...] "he absolutely hated getting his feet dirty". <b>Go</b> <b>Man</b> <b>Go</b> passed through a number of hands after Green owned him, including Les Gosselin, Frank Vessels, and Harriett Peckham, who was his owner by 1972. In 1967, when Vessels sold his half-interest in <b>Go</b> <b>Man</b> <b>Go</b> to Briarwood Farms, the deal was said to be a record price for a Quarter Horse. <b>Go</b> <b>Man</b> <b>Go</b> died in 1983 and was buried near the headquarters of the Buena Suerte Ranch in Roswell, New Mexico.

5|$|Green {{ran into}} {{problems}} with <b>Go</b> <b>Man</b> <b>Go's</b> registration. At that time, the AQHA had {{two types of}} registration, the Appendix and the Tentative. Appendix-registered horses were the offspring of Thoroughbreds and either Tentative-registered Quarter Horses or Appendix-registered Quarter Horses. <b>Go</b> <b>Man</b> <b>Go</b> was originally registered in the Appendix, as his dam was an Appendix-registered mare. The way to advance out of the Appendix into the Tentative registry was to qualify on performance grounds and pass a conformation examination conducted by the AQHA. <b>Go</b> <b>Man</b> <b>Go</b> certainly qualified under the performance criteria, but his conformation was such that he resembled a Thoroughbred more than he resembled a Quarter Horse. Green knew {{that in order to}} increase his stud fees—the price paid for the right to breed a mare to a stallion—Go <b>Man</b> <b>Go</b> needed to acquire a regular registration number instead of his Appendix number. So Green appealed to the Executive Committee of the AQHA, which had the authority to award Tentative numbers to horses regardless of conformation exam results. In both 1956 and 1957, the committee declined to take action, waiting to evaluate the quality of <b>Go</b> <b>Man</b> <b>Go's</b> first foals before making a decision. Finally, in 1958, they awarded <b>Go</b> <b>Man</b> <b>Go</b> number 82,000 in the Tentative registry.|$|R

25|$|How far {{his love}} of <b>man</b> <b>went</b> may be seen from an example that shows that benevolence must be given {{with regard to the}} needs of the poor.

25|$|The first boxing rules, {{called the}} Broughton's rules, were {{introduced}} by champion Jack Broughton in 1743 to protect fighters {{in the ring}} where deaths sometimes occurred. Under these rules, if a <b>man</b> <b>went</b> down and could not continue after a count of 30 seconds, the fight was over. Hitting a downed fighter and grasping below the waist were prohibited. Broughton encouraged the use of 'mufflers', a form of padded bandage or mitten, {{to be used in}} 'jousting' or sparring sessions in training, and in exhibition matches.|$|E

25|$|In the {{continuation}} of the reading, Moses instructed that when the Israelites had settled in the land, they were to divide the land into three parts and set aside three Cities of Refuge, so that any manslayer could have a place to which to flee. And if the Israelites faithfully observed all the law and God enlarged the territory, then they were to add three more towns to those three. Only a manslayer who had killed another unwittingly, without being the other's enemy, might flee there and live. For instance, if a <b>man</b> <b>went</b> with his neighbor into a grove to cut wood, and as he swung an axe, the axe-head flew off the handle and struck and killed the neighbor, then the man could flee to one of the cities of refuge and live. The second open portion ends here.|$|E
25|$|By 1881, {{having been}} {{exempted}} from his compulsory {{term in the}} Romanian Land Forces as the eldest son of a widow, the young <b>man</b> <b>went</b> on to study at the University of Bucharest's Faculty of Letters. Taught and regarded with admiration by academic Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu, Șăineanu was primarily a student of etymology, stylistics and semantics (which {{formed the basis of}} his first three studies, published in 1882 and 1887). He published his first study, the 1883 Câteva specimene de etimologie populară română ("A Few Samples of Romanian Folk Etymology"), in Hasdeu's magazine Columna lui Traian. By then, Șăineanu had begun contributing to Anuar pentru Israeliți ("The Yearbook for Israelites"), the Hebraist magazine edited by his friends and fellow scholars Moses Gaster and Moses Schwartzfeld, which mainly published articles on Jewish history and espoused a moderate assimilationist agenda (Haskalah). Gaster also sent Șăineanu's various studies on folklore and linguistics also published in Revista pentru Istorie, Arheologie și Filologie, a review founded and led by Romanian historian Grigore Tocilescu. The direct contacts between the two scholars ended in 1885, when Gaster was expelled from Romania for protesting against the antisemitic measures condoned by the National Liberal Party cabinet of Ion Brătianu.|$|E
25|$|In an oral history, Lopez-De La Cruz remembered some {{circumstances}} {{of being a}} female labor organizer. “It was very hard being a woman organizer. Many of our people my age and older were raised with the old customs where the husband rules and the wife obeys… Neighbors in Parlier were for the union, {{but they were not}} taking orders from women.” She suggested reforms to make the union more inclusive to women, for example her “suggestion” to add women to the all male ranch committee of Christian Brothers Wine Company, and her push to end a ban on women pruning, making higher paying work available to women’s crews at the Christian Brothers Wine Company. She also remembered how women took the lead in volunteering for store front picket lines and engaging customers in conversations about the struggle. Aside from being an efficient and passionate organizer, Lopez-De La Cruz is remembered for her incredible wit. Many stories have survived of her ability to invoke humor and justice in situations. For example, after being red bated at a picket line at a Fresno Safeway in the mid 1960s and being asked by a white man “how do you say communists in Spanish?”, she responded “Ustedes Ganaran” (You shall win), and the <b>man</b> <b>went</b> on to passionately shout the phrase while UFW members looked on and laughed.|$|E
