This, together with a high shear modulus and a very low figure for Poisson's ratio (the relationship of longitudinal to lateral strain), indicate {{the high degree of}} stiffness and resistance to deformation that have rendered its fabrication into useful components a matter of great difficulty. Despite these limitations and iridium's high cost, a number of applications have developed where <b>mechanical</b> <b>strength</b> is an essential factor in some of the extremely severe conditions encountered in modern technology.|$|E

The tooth met the jaw at a steep angle, similar to the great white shark. The tooth was anchored by connective tissue fibers, and the roughness of the base may have added to <b>mechanical</b> <b>strength.</b> The lingual side of the tooth, the part facing the tongue, was convex; and the labial side, {{the other side of}} the tooth, was slightly convex or flat.

It was also found that the experimental cement exhibited significantly higher <b>mechanical</b> <b>strengths</b> than commercial Fuji II LC. The experimental cement was 51 % in CS, 55 % in compressive modulus, 118 % in DTS, 82 % in FS, 18 % in FT and 85 % in KHN higher than Fuji II LC. The experimental cement was only 6. 7 % of abrasive and 10 % of attritional wear depths of Fuji II LC in each wear cycle. It appears that this novel experimental cement is a clinically attractive dental restorative and may potentially be used for high-wear and high-stress-bearing site restorations...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Due to {{the drive}} from legislations, fuel efficiency, and CO 2 emission, the {{application}} of aluminium lightweight structures in automotive industry have been increased significantly. Self piercing riveting (SPR) {{has been one of}} the major joining technologies for aluminium structures due to its advantages to some traditional joining technologies. There are some standard parameters that will influence the joint quality and <b>mechanical</b> <b>strengths</b> of an SPR joint. However, even for the same parameters used, sometimes the joint quality and <b>mechanical</b> <b>strengths</b> of SPR joints could still be significantly different, which may cause joint failure or strength reduction. One reason found is the variation of rivet specifications between different batches. In this paper, the influence of rivet tip geometry on the joint quality and <b>mechanical</b> <b>strengths</b> was studied. The results showed that rivets with sharper tips flared more during riveting process, and joints with sharper rivets had higher lap shear strength; however, the influence of rivet geometry on T peel strength could be different for different rivets, and rivet tip geometry did not have an obvious influence on joint fatigue strengths...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of {{study was to}} investigate the correlation between the <b>mechanical</b> <b>strengths</b> [insertion torque (IT); resonance frequency (RF); and horizontal pullout strength (HPS) ] and gripping volume (GV) of mini-implants. Thirty mini-implants of three types (Type A: 2  mm ×  10  mm, cylindrical, titanium alloy; Type B: 2  mm ×  10  mm, tapered, stainless steel; and Type C: 2  mm ×  11  mm, cylindrical, titanium alloy) were inserted 7  mm into artificial bones. One-way analysis of variance and Spearman's test were applied to assess intergroup comparisons and intragroup correlations. The null hypothesis was that no statistically significant correlations exist between the GV and <b>mechanical</b> <b>strengths</b> (IT, RF, and HPS). In the IT test, Type C (14. 2  Ncm) had significantly (p= 0. 016) greater values than did Type A (12. 4  Ncm). In the RF analysis, no significant difference was observed among the three types of mini-implants. In the HPS test, Type C (388. 9  Ncm) was significantly larger than both Type B (294. 5 Ncm) and Type A (286  Ncm). In the GV measurement, Type C (14. 4  mm 3) was significantly larger than Type B (11. 4  mm 3) and Type A (9. 2  mm 3). Type A and Type B exhibited no significant correlations among the tests. Therefore, the null hypothesis was accepted. Although no significant correlation was noted between the GV and <b>mechanical</b> <b>strengths</b> (IT, RF, and HPS), we observed a trend that the <b>mechanical</b> <b>strengths</b> (IT, RF, and HPS) of the mini-implants corresponded to the order and values of GV (Type C > Type B > Type A) ...|$|R

Polymer concrete is a new advanced composite material which is used in construction industry due to its superior properties in comparison with ordinary Portland cement concrete such as: higher <b>mechanical</b> <b>strengths</b> and chemical resistance. The paper characterizes the polymer concrete obtained by adding different types of wastes, such as: argillaceous powder, calcareous powder, marble powder and fly ash to a witness mix obtained by mixing epoxy resin and aggregates in two sorts (0 - 4 mm and 4 - 8 mm).

The finite-element method {{is used to}} {{study the effects of}} plate-support conditions, aspect ratio, and hole size on the <b>mechanical</b> buckling <b>strength</b> of the perforated plates subjected to linearly varying loading. Results show that increasing the hole size does not necessarily reduce the <b>mechanical</b> buckling <b>strength</b> of the perforated plates. It is also concluded that the clamped boundary condition increases the <b>mechanical</b> buckling <b>strength</b> of the perforated plates more than the simply-supported boundary condition and the free boundary conditions enhance the <b>mechanical</b> buckling <b>strength</b> of the perforated plates more effectively than the fixed boundary conditions. Furthermore, for the bending cases, the critical buckling load of perforated plates with free edges is less than perforated plates with fixed edges.

40|$|Belite Calcium SulfoAluminate (BCSA) eco-cements were {{developed}} as OPC substitutes since in their production release 22 % less CO 2 than OPC. BCSA eco-cements contain belite as main phase (> 50 wt%) and ye'elimite as secondary main phase (~ 30 wt%). However, these materials develop low <b>mechanical</b> <b>strengths</b> at intermediate hydration ages (3, 7 and 28 days). A {{solution to this}} problem may involve the design and preparation of clinker/cement with the highest percentage of coexisting alite and ye'elimite. These materials are known as Belite-Alite Calcium SulfoAluminate (BACSA) clinkers/cements. Their manufacture may produce 15 % less CO 2 than OPC. Alite is the main component of OPC and is responsible for early <b>mechanical</b> <b>strengths.</b> The reaction of alite and ye´elimite with water will develop cements with high <b>mechanical</b> <b>strengths</b> at early ages, while belite will contribute to later curing times. This work is focused on the design and optimisation of all the parameters evolved in the preparation of BACSA eco-clinkers that develop <b>mechanical</b> <b>strengths</b> comparable to those of OPC with a reduction in CO 2 emissions of at least 15 % when compared to OPC production. These parameters include the selection of the raw materials (lime, gypsum, kaolin and sand), milling conditions of the crude, clinkering temperature (from 1280 to 1300 ºC) and holding time at every temperature, and final composition. The clinker with the targeted composition (belite ~ 60 wt%, alite ~ 13 wt% and ye'elimite ~ 10 wt%) was chosen to perform the scaling-up (2 kg). BACSA eco-clinkers were chemically and mineralogically characterised through X-ray fluorescence and laboratory X-ray powder diffraction (LXRPD), the latter in combination with the Rietveld methodology to obtain the full phase assemblage including Amorphous and Crystalline non-quantified, ACn, contents. Finally, the hydration of the selected BACSA cement paste (prepared with the scaled-up clinker and anhydrite) was studied mainly through rheological measurements (at very early hydration time) and LXRPD in combination with the Rietveld methodology and G-factor method.
