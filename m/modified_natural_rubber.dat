40|$|Abstract. <b>Modified</b> <b>natural</b> <b>rubber</b> latex {{can be used}} as {{paperboard}} barrier coating {{in order}} to replace unrecyclable wax coating material. Natural rubber latex (NRL) was prevucanized in different time interval and the efficiency of crosslinking were determined by swelling ratio test. Prevulcanized natural rubber latex (Pre-VNRL) was blended with modified lignin dispersion to decrease sticking tendency of the coatings. Particle size of lignin dispersion was reduced by Mannish reaction using octylamine which can increase hydrophobility in lignin. Compared with Pre-VNRL coating, a reduction of water vapour transition rate (WVTR) was observed in blending-coated paper. Such moisture-barrier behaviour is attributable to a good compatibility of the nano-sized modified lignin particles with rubber.

Experimented <b>natural</b> <b>rubber</b> latex compounds were pre vulcanized with sulphur and ionization radiation. Radiation vulcanization was performed using 60 Co source irradiator, originally designed for sterilization of medical products, with reduced gamma rays dose rate. Its suitability for radiation vulcanization of locally produced <b>natural</b> <b>rubber</b> latex was confirmed experimentally. Obtained results showed that the peel off test device was acceptable for evaluation of <b>natural</b> <b>rubber</b> latex -filler interaction irrespective of the vulcanization system used with latex compound. Peel test results displayed the influence of modified fillers on the peel strength values of tested laminates. Increased peel strength values of the samples containing modified kaolin were attributed to better interaction of the filler with rubber polymer. It was investigated, that facilitated interaction observed with <b>natural</b> <b>rubber</b> latex and <b>modified</b> kaolin resulted in improved properties of filled <b>natural</b> <b>rubber</b> latex compounds of both vulcanization system, and irradiated one was more susceptible within the experiment performed. Preference in mechanical stability time, viscosity factor and tensile was given to radiation vulcanization <b>natural</b> <b>rubber</b> latex (RVNRL). Reinforcing effect of <b>modified</b> filers in <b>natural</b> <b>rubber</b> latex compounds was lower of that observed earlier with dry rubber compounds. The reason for it could be associated with partial deactivation of the active centres initially brought by modification the phenomenon that have to be studied and overcome in the future.

40|$|A {{series of}} <b>modified</b> <b>natural</b> <b>rubber</b> latexes (NELs) grafted with poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) were {{prepared}} by seeded emulsion polymerization with NRL as the seed polymer. Two different redox systems, cumene hydroperoxide (CHP) /tetraethylene pentamine (TEPA) and tert-butyl hydroperoxide (t-BHP) /TEPA, {{were used to}} initiate polymerization, and phase mixing was promoted {{by the addition of}} vinyl neo-decanoate (VneoD). The CHP/TEPA system was more efficient than t-BHP/TEPA for the grafting of secondary polymers in <b>modified</b> <b>natural</b> <b>rubber</b> (NR). The enhanced phase mixing in the presence of VneoD was attributed to the solubility parameter of the VneoD-rich methyl methacrylate-VneoD copolymer formed late in the reaction, lying between that of PMMA and NR, {{and the extent to which}} this polymer was grafted to the NR backbone. The viscoelastic properties of the polymers were investigated as a function of composition, temperature, and frequency:, changes in viscoelastic behavior consistent with the presence of a high-T-g PMMA phase (where T-g is the glass-transition temperature) were observed. This suggested a degree of phase mixing that increased with increasing VneoD content and increasing flux of oxygen-centered radicals within the NR particles. More phase mixing resulted in poorer film formation, which was consistent with the localization of a high-Tg secondary polymer phase near the particle surface. The apparent concentration of PMMA near the surface of the particles was also observed with transmission electron microscopy. The localization of PMMA near the particle surfaces was consistent with the presumed locus of radical generation in these systems: the redox couple used to initiate the polymerization consisted of an oil-soluble hydroperoxide and a water-soluble amine that reacted predominantly at the water/particle interface. The viscoelastic properties of the modified NFLs that were prepared suggest that these synthetic procedures provide a means of controlling phase mixing and branching, such as for improving the suitability of these modified rubbers in pressure-sensitive-adhesive formulations.

The number of degranulated mast cells in <b>natural</b> <b>rubber</b> latex-sensitized skin sites was significantly higher compared with control sites treated with phosphate-buffered saline. The expression of interleukin- 1 β and interleukin- 4 mRNA was markedly increased in <b>natural</b> <b>rubber</b> latex-sensitized skin sites.

Freeze-fracture TEM micrographs indicate strong interactions between the surface of the modified NRL and starch.

It is known that degradation features of <b>natural</b> <b>rubber</b> are cleavage of C=C double bonds and changes of 3 D cross-link structure. The degradation mechanism is investigated by many spectroscopic methods, for example, FT-IR and NMR. By using Raman spectroscopy, some information about C=C double bonds, characteristic to <b>natural</b> <b>rubber</b> can be obtained.

40|$|<b>Natural</b> <b>rubber</b> as a {{composite}} of poly cis-isoprene and minor components <b>Natural</b> <b>rubber</b> is a biopolymer consisting of isoprene units (C 5 H 8) n linked together in a 1, 4 cis-configuration. Various latex-producing plants synthesize <b>natural</b> <b>rubber</b> in their specifically differentiated cells in a manner such that C 5 -monomer units, isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP) molecules, are sequentially condensed into allylic primers, like FPP or GPP by cis-prenyltransferase (Figure 1) (Takahashi 2006). Not only poly cis-isoprene molecules, but also other cellular components, {{are included in the}} latex. Namely, <b>natural</b> <b>rubber</b> is, in a sense, {{a composite}} of these components, while synthetic rubber is almost simply composed of poly-isoprene with not more than 90 % of cis-bond. Because of its molecular structure (high cis-bond content of over 99. 5 %) and high molecular weight (more than 1106 Da) of polymer component and yet-to-be-defined contributions of minor components in the latex, such as proteins, minerals, carbohydrates and lipids, <b>natural</b> <b>rubber</b> has superior resilience, elasticity, abrasion resistance, efficient heat dispersion and impact resistance to synthetic <b>rubber.</b> Uses of <b>natural</b> <b>rubber</b> and its importance in tire production <b>Natural</b> <b>rubber</b> is used in over 40, 000 products, including tires, medical devices, surgical gloves and various engineering and consumer products (Mooibroek 2000). Of these end-use markets for <b>natural</b> <b>rubber,</b> tire products accounts for over 50 % of <b>natural</b> <b>rubber</b> consumption. <b>Natural</b> <b>rubber</b> continues to hold an important position in tire consumption, competing with synthetic rubber.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to analyze the {{development}} of Indonesia 2 ̆ 7 s <b>natural</b> <b>rubber</b> exports and analyze the competitiveness of Indonesian <b>natural</b> <b>rubber</b> in the International market. The data used in this study was a secondary data export raw <b>natural</b> <b>rubber</b> Indonesia, Thailand, and Malaysia during the period 1996 - 2010. The data was taken from the value and volume of exports of <b>natural</b> <b>rubber</b> in the International market. The analytical method used was the Revealed Comparative Advantage (RCA) and Constant Market Share (CMS). The results of this study indicate that the development of Indonesia 2 ̆ 7 s <b>natural</b> <b>rubber</b> exports tend to increase every year. The level of the comparative advantage of Indonesia 2 ̆ 7 s <b>natural</b> <b>rubber</b> exports relatively higher than Malaysia.
