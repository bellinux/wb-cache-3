The main problem associated with them is filter clogging, which induces an increasinglymarked pressure drop with time and thus imposes regular <b>media</b> <b>cleaning</b> or replacement. This contexthas prompted the idea of investigating bubble columns, which operate at constant pressure drop, asalternatives to fibrous filters. This study examines the influence of different operating conditions, suchas liquid height, air flow rate, bubble size and presence of granular beds on ultrafine particle collection. Experimental results show that bubble columns are characterised by high collection efficiency, whenthey feature a large liquid height and small diameter bubbling orifices, while their efficiencies remainlower than those of fibrous filters. Gas velocity does not greatly influence collection efficiency, but theinclusion of a granular bed, composed of beads, increases the bubble residence time in the column,thereby increasing the column collection efficiency...|$|E
40|$|When Congress {{created the}} Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) they {{mandated}} {{that the agency}} promote economic development and protect the natural resources within the Tennessee Valley. TVA’s Industrial Waste Reduction (IWR) program helps meet two of TVA's goals; economic development and protecting the environment. IWR coordinates with EPA’s pollution prevention (P 2) programs in Region IV and the nation and with state P 2 programs. TVA developed and pioneered with Tennessee the concept of using retired engineers and scientists to provide P 2 assistance to industries in a very cost-effective program. A study done by the Tennessee program {{with many of the}} industries they had assisted showed $ 36 dollars in annual savings by the industries for each $ 1 used to provide the assistance. IWR also occasionally provides direct assistance at the request of our distributors or with one of our partners in P 2. For many industries an increasing problem is managing their wastewater in a costeffective manner. Water is used for many purposes: heat transfer, reaction <b>media,</b> <b>cleaning,</b> transport media, and others. One reason that water is so useful is that many things are soluble in water.

40|$|Background: In {{the light}} of {{increasing}} childhood obesity, the role of food advertisements relayed on television (TV) is of high interest. There is evidence of food commercials {{having an impact on}} children's food preferences, choices, consumption and obesity. We describe the product categories advertised during kids programmes, the type of food promoted and the characteristics of food commercials targeting children. Methods: A content analysis of the commercials aired during the kids programmes of six Swiss, one German and one Italian stations was conducted. The commercials were collected over a 6 -month period in 2006. Results: Overall, 1365 h of kids programme were recorded and 11 613 advertisements were found: 3061 commercials (26. 4 %) for food, 2696 (23. 3 %) promoting toys, followed by those of <b>media,</b> <b>cleaning</b> products and cosmetics. Regarding the broadcast food advertisements, 55 % were for fast food restaurants or candies. Conclusion: The results of the content analysis suggest that food advertising contributes to the obesity problem: every fourth advertisement is for food, half of them for products high in sugar and fat and hardly any for fruit or vegetables. Long-term exposure to this distortion of the pyramid of recommended food should be considered in the discussion of legal restrictions for food advertising targeting childre...|$|E

In the disk drive industry, freon products have been extensively used in ultra-sonic cleaning of the metallic and polymeric {{components of the}} head disk assembly.

40|$|In this {{reporting}} period, {{a fundamental}} filtration study was started {{to investigate the}} separation of Fischer-Tropsch Synthesis (FTS) liquids from iron-based catalyst particles. Slurry-phase FTS in slurry bubble column reactor systems is the preferred mode of production since the reaction is highly exothermic. Consequently, heavy wax products must be separated from catalyst particles before being removed from the reactor system. Achieving an efficient wax product separation from iron-based catalysts {{is one of the}} most challenging technical problems associated with slurry-phase FTS. The separation problem is further compounded by catalyst particle attrition and the formation of ultra-fine iron carbide and/or carbon particles. Existing pilot-scale equipment was modified to include a filtration test apparatus. After undergoing an extensive plant shakedown period, filtration tests with cross-flow filter modules using simulant FTS wax slurry were conducted. The focus of these early tests was to find adequate mixtures of polyethylene wax to simulate FTS wax. Catalyst particle size analysis techniques were also developed. Initial analyses of the slurry and filter permeate particles will be used by the research team to design improved filter <b>media</b> and <b>cleaning</b> strategies...|$|R
40|$|Today {{cleaning}} {{with carbon}} dioxide pellets similar to sand blasting is an established technology. It {{is used for}} cleaning buildings outsides, rusty contamination or even to remove paint from airplanes. In any of these cases, the treated contamination is of a rough and macroscopic character. For the cleaning challenges of the Semiconductor Industry of the Microelectromechanical Systems (MEMS) with submicron particle contamination and thin film contamination this process {{is not at all}} suitable. On the other hand, established cleaning methods for the above mentioned problems, such as wet cleaning with water or chemicals, are often inconvenient, costly and are followed by the necessary disposal of <b>cleaning</b> <b>media.</b> At the Fraunhofer IPA, Stuttgart, Germany, experiments have been performed to develop an optimized cleaning system with carbon dioxide snow. High purity carbon dioxide is highly compressed and afterwards expands through a specially formed nozzle. Like this the carbon dioxide creat es a mix of snowflakes and gas. The effect of cleaning is a result of an almost gentle but very effective momentum transfer by the snowflakes on the contamination and the resulting shock wave which is induced by the sublimating carbon dioxide. The main advantages of this cleaning method can be described as follows: - cleaning of hybrid structures with a very high local resolution - minimal consumption of carbon dioxide - dry cleaning - no contaminated <b>cleaning</b> <b>media</b> (compared to wet cleaning with water or chemicals - disposal-free cleaning - cleaning of particle and filmic contamination - effective cleaning of submicron contamination at a high performance.

30|$|The {{choice of}} the <b>cleaning</b> <b>media,</b> which may be a solvent (e.g. acetone, ethanol, isopropanol, etc.), a gas (e.g. ozone, {{ethylene}} oxide), {{or a combination of}} different solvents/gases, is clearly very important, as they should be: i) effective in the removal of both chemical and microbiological impurities, ii) easy to be removed from the system {{after the end of the}} cleaning procedures, iii) non-toxic, iv) inert with respect for the interested internal surfaces, and v) they should not yield additional impurities. For instance, acetone is suitable in solubilizing chemical impurities, due to its polar characteristics, and it’s easy to be removed, due to its low boiling point, but it is not very effective with microbiological impurities, and ethanol, isopropyl alcohol or a mixture of the above solvents might be preferable.|$|R

50|$|After {{degating}} {{and heat}} treating, sand or other molding media may remain {{adhered to the}} casting. To remove any mold remnants, the surface is cleaned using a blasting process. This means a granular media will be propelled against {{the surface of the}} casting to mechanically knock away the adhering sand. The media may be blown with compressed air, or may be hurled using a shot wheel. The <b>cleaning</b> <b>media</b> strikes the casting surface at high velocity to dislodge the mold remnants (for example, sand, slag) from the casting surface. Numerous materials may be used to clean cast surfaces, including steel, iron, other metal alloys, aluminium oxides, glass beads, walnut shells, baking powder, and many others. The blasting media is selected to develop the color and reflectance of the cast surface. Terms used to describe this process include cleaning, bead blasting, and sand blasting. Shot peening may be used to further work-harden and finish the surface.|$|R

40|$|Solidified CO 2 pellets are an {{effective}} blast <b>media</b> for the <b>cleaning</b> {{of a variety}} of materials. CO 2 is obtained from the waste gas streams generated from other manufacturing processes and therefore does not contribute to the greenhouse effect, depletion of the ozone layer, or the environmental burden of hazardous waste disposal. The system is capable of removing as much as 90 percent of the contamination from a surface in one pass or to a high cleanliness level after multiple passes. Although the system is packaged and designed for manual hand held cleaning processes, the nozzle can easily be attached to the end effector of a robot for automated cleaning of predefined and known geometries. Specific tailoring of cleaning parameters are required to optimize the process for each individual geometry. Using optimum cleaning parameters the CO 2 systems were shown to be capable of cleaning to molecular levels below 0. 7 mg/sq ft.

Achievable Emission Limits/Reductions: Older existing cartridge collector types have a range of actual operating efficiencies of 99 to 99. 9 % for PM 10 and PM 2. 5. Typical new equipment design efficiencies are between 99. 99 and 99. 999 + % (EPA, 1998 b). In addition, commercially available designs are able to control submicron PM (0. 8 µm in diameter or greater) with a removal efficiency of 99. 999 + % (AAF, 1999; Torit, 1999). Several factors determine cartridge filter collection efficiency including gas filtration velocity, particle characteristics, filter <b>media</b> characteristics, and <b>cleaning</b> mechanism. In general, collection efficiency increases with increasing filtration velocity and particle size. For a given combination of filter design and dust, the effluent particle concentration from a cartridge collector is nearly constant, whereas the overall efficiency is more likely to vary with particulate loading.

30|$|We {{have tested}} {{different}} cleaning procedures by quantifying surface cleanliness electrochemically in situ and using surface science techniques ex situ. Based on results published by Fischer et al. [21], {{we tested the}} following cleaning protocols: 1. Electrochemical sweep of the gold coated cantilever in 50  mM potassium hydroxide (KOH) from − 0.2 to 1.2  V (vs. Ag/AgCl (sat. KCl)), 2. Electrochemical sweep in 50  mM potassium perchlorate (KClO 4) from − 0.8 to 1.4  V (vs. Ag/AgCl (sat. KCl)) and 3. Piranha solution (Three parts concentrated sulfuric acid (H 2 SO 4) and one part hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2); note that great caution is necessary when using piranha solution) treatment of the cantilever for 5  min. We find that the KClO 4 and KOH- mediated processes result in the cleanest surface as monitored using ex situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and in situ cyclic voltammetry. The atomic percent surface composition measured from XPS results of the survey scan for the piranha cleaning method results in 40.2 % gold, 33.6 % carbon and 26.1 % oxygen. A huge improvement of these value, i.e. higher gold percentage can be seen for the KOH sweep {{as well as the}} KClO 4 sweep. For KOH the composition is 65.3 % gold, 30.0 % carbon and 4.74 % oxygen, which is very comparable to the values for the KClO 4 sweep with 61.7 % gold, 33.8 % carbon and 4.5 % oxygen. The KClO 4 sweep is chosen to be the primary cleaning step for all further experiments, as this is a standard <b>media</b> for electrochemical <b>cleaning</b> of gold. Additionally, perchlorate has a very small affinity for gold and will not adsorb onto the gold surface.|$|R
40|$|Tomco Equipment Company {{has participated}} in the dry ice (solid carbon dioxide, CO 2) {{cleaning}} industry for over ten years as {{a pioneer in the}} manufacturer of high density, dry ice cleaning pellet production equipment. For over four years Tomco high density pelletizers have been available to the dry ice cleaning industry. Approximately one year ago Tomco introduced the DI- 250, a new dry ice blast unit making Tomco a single source supplier for sublimable <b>media,</b> particle blast, <b>cleaning</b> systems. This new blast unit is an all pneumatic, single discharge hose device. It meters the insertion of 1 / 8 inch diameter (or smaller), high density, dry ice pellets into a high pressure, propellant gas stream. The dry ice and propellant streams are controlled and mixed from the blast cabinet. From there the mixture is transported to the nozzle where the pellets are accelerated to an appropriate blasting velocity. When directed to impact upon a target area, these dry ice pellets have sufficient energy to effectively remove most surface coatings through dry, abrasive contact. The meta-stable, dry ice pellets used for CO 2 cleaning, while labeled 'high density,' are less dense than alternate, abrasive, particle blast media. In addition, after contacting the target surface, they return to their equilibrium condition: a superheated gas state. Most currently used grit blasting media are silicon dioxide based, which possess a sharp tetrahedral molecular structure. Silicon dioxide crystal structures will always produce smaller sharp-edged replicas of the original crystal upon fracture. Larger, softer dry ice pellets do not share the same sharp-edged crystalline structures as their non-sublimable counterparts when broken. In fact, upon contact with the target surface, dry ice pellets will plastically deform and break apart. As such, dry ice cleaning is less harmful to sensitive substrates, workers and the environment than chemical or abrasive cleaning systems. Dry ice cleaning system components include: a dry ice pellet supply, a non-reactive propellant gas source, a pellet and propellant metering device, and a media transport and acceleration hose and nozzle arrangement. Dry ice cleaning system operating parameters include: choice of propellant gas, its pressure and temperature, dry ice mass flow rate, dry ice pellet size and shape, and acceleration nozzle configuration. These parameters may be modified to fit different applications. The growth of the dry ice cleaning industry will depend upon timely data acquisition of the effects that independent changes in these parameters have on cleaning rates, with respect to different surface coating and substrate combinations. With this data, optimization of cleaning rates for particular applications will be possible. The analysis of the applicable range of modulation of these parameters, within system component mechanical constraints, has just begun...|$|R
