In a statement released to the press after the meeting he said: [...] "In <b>my</b> <b>conversation</b> <b>with</b> the Turkish prime minister, I told him that if Israeli planes indeed penetrated Turkish airspace, then there was no intention thereby, either in advance or in any case, to—in any way—violate or undermine Turkish sovereignty, which we respect." ...|$|E
2500|$|In his memoir, Courage and Consequence, Rove devotes three {{chapters}} to Wilson's New York Times op-ed {{and subsequent}} grand jury investigation. Rove writes that before his third {{appearance before the}} grand jury, Robert Luskin went back and looked through all of Rove's saved emails from April through September 2003. Luskin, according to Rove, uncovered an email Rove had written to Steve Hadley in which Rove discussed a conversation he had had with Matt Cooper concerning Wilson's op-ed. Rove writes that while the [...] "email didn't jog any better recollection of the call", he immediately told Fitzgerald, after being sworn in, {{that he wanted to}} [...] "set the record straight." [...] After presenting the email to Fitzgerald, Rove writes that [...] "it was as if I'd detonated a bomb in the shabby little room." [...] Rove writes that before his fourth appearance before the grand jury he received a [...] "target warning" [...] by Fitzgerald. Rove describes his fourth appearance as [...] "brutal from the first moment", and that the grand jury [...] "hung on Fitzgerald's every word." [...] After Rove's testimony, Fitzgerald told Luskin [...] "All things being equal, we are inclined to indict your client." [...] According to Rove, Luskin and Fitzgerald meet for hours in Chicago on October 20 to discuss the matter. At some point during the meeting, [...] "Fitzgerald turned to what was really bothering him: <b>my</b> <b>conversation</b> <b>with</b> Matt Cooper. Was I lying {{about not being able to}} recall my phone conversation with him the morning of July 11, 2003?" [...] Specifically, Rove writes, Fitzgerald wanted to know why [...] "in December 2003 or January 2004 did I ask my aides...to find any evidence of contact with Matt Cooper." [...] It was at this moment, according to Rove, that Luskin revealed his conversation with Viveca Novak in which Luskin learned that Cooper [...] "had insisted around Times Washington bureau that he had talked to [...]" [...] Luskin then revealed to Fitzgerald that it was he who instructed Rove to have his aides find any records of that contact. According to Rove, Fitzgerald was [...] "stunned", and stated to Luskin, [...] "You rocked my world." [...] Rove writes that it [...] "was clear Fitzgerald had originally intended to indict Libby and me on the same day." [...] Rove also writes that in the end, Luskin had a [...] "charitable view of Fitzgerald...the prosecutor never leaked, and he treated Luskin with respect and was forthcoming about his evidence and concerns." ...|$|E
