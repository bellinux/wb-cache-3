5|$|Agriculture, {{largely based}} on livestock, has {{traditionally}} been the <b>main</b> <b>occupation</b> in the central and western parts of the county.

5|$|Farming was the <b>main</b> <b>occupation</b> in Urmston {{until the}} early 19th century, when weaving became a {{significant}} source of employment, although this later declined due to competition from large industry. In 1848, the population was recorded as being 771, with around 80% of the land being farmed. The opening of the Cheshire Lines Railway in 1873 allowed the town to grow as a commuter town: between 1871 and 1901 the population grew by over 650%, from 996 to 6,594. By 1901, farming had virtually died out, and the town became a residence for the middle classes.|$|E
5|$|In the {{following}} years, Northumberland occasionally {{served with the}} king in France, but his <b>main</b> <b>occupation</b> was {{the protection of the}} border to Scotland. At the same time, a feud with the Neville family was developing, particularly with Richard Neville, Earl of Salisbury. This feud became entangled with the conflict between the Duke of York and the Duke of Somerset over control of national government. The conflict culminated in the first battle of the Wars of the Roses, at St Albans, where both Somerset and Northumberland were killed.|$|E
5|$|The vast {{majority}} of the people lived in villages and agriculture was their <b>main</b> <b>occupation.</b> The economy of the kingdom was based on agriculture. Grains, pulses, vegetables and flowers were cultivated. Commercial crops included sugarcane and cotton. The agrarian population consisted of landlords (gavunda, zamindar, heggadde) who tilled the land by employing a number of landless labourers, usually paying them in grain. Minor cultivators were also willing to hire themselves out as labourers if the need arose. It was due to the availability of these landless labourers that kings and landlords were able to execute major projects such as palaces, temples, mosques, anicuts (dams) and tanks. Because land was abundant and the population relatively sparse, no rent was charged on land ownership. Instead, landowners paid tax for cultivation, which amounted to up to one-half of all harvested produce.|$|E

5|$|Ultimately, {{the region}} was {{repopulated}} by Orthodox Bulgarians, beginning in the 1720s. In 1737–1738, the sultan amnestied the rebels and permitted {{the return of the}} insurgents' property in 1741, though none of the former residents is known to have returned. In the 1720s–1730s, Chiprovtsi had only 12 inhabited houses; by the 1750s, those had reached 150. The Orthodox Chiprovtsi Monastery had been reestablished in 1703 by a certain Zhivko who took the ecclesiastical name of Zoticus. As the interrupted mining was apparently not continued after the uprising and the international trade links had been severed, the locals switched to cattle breeding, agriculture, fur trade and later carpet weaving as their <b>main</b> <b>occupation.</b>|$|E

25|$|Historians {{have decided}} that between the tenth and thirteenth centuries, {{agricultural}} production in Lijiang replaced livestock breeding as the <b>main</b> <b>occupation</b> of the people. The production of agricultural, handicraft, mineral, and livestock products led to considerable prosperity, and during this period a number of slave-owning groups in Ninglang, Lijiang, and Weixi counties developed into a feudal caste of lords. Tibetan Buddhism took hold in the Lijiang region following visits from the Karmapas from the fourteenth century onwards.|$|E

25|$|In Chhattisgarh, rice, {{the main}} crop, is grown on about 77% {{of the net}} sown area. Only about 20% of the area is under irrigation; the rest depends on rain. Of the three {{agroclimatic}} zones, about 73% of the Chhattisgarh plains, 97% of the Bastar plateau and 95% of the northern hills are rainfed. The irrigated area available for double cropping is only 87,000ha in Chhattisgarh plains and 2300ha in Bastar plateau and northern hills. Due to this, the productivity of rice and other crops is low, hence the farmers are unable to obtain economic benefits from agriculture and it has remained as subsistence agriculture till now, though agriculture is the <b>main</b> <b>occupation</b> of more than 80% of the population.|$|E
