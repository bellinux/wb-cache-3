40|$|DE 102006016326 A 1 UPAB: 20080102 NOVELTY - The {{determination}} of the <b>microbiological</b> <b>state</b> of a sample, comprises placing the biological material from the sample on a carrier, positioning the carrier {{with respect to a}} sample chamber with two electrodes, setting a specified temperature in the sample chamber and carrying out an electrochemical measurement using the electrodes. During the electrochemical measurement, the carrier is positioned in or at the sample chamber. The placement of the biological material comprises a contacting step of the sample with a gel strip serving as the carrier. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The {{determination of}} the <b>microbiological</b> <b>state</b> of a sample, comprises placing the biological material from the sample on a carrier, positioning the carrier with respect to a sample chamber with two electrodes, setting a specified temperature in the sample chamber and carrying out an electrochemical measurement using the electrodes. During the electrochemical measurement, the carrier is positioned in or at the sample chamber. The placement of the biological material comprises a contacting step of the sample with a gel strip serving as the carrier. The positioning of the carrier comprises an insertion of the gel strip into the sample chamber. The insertion of the gel strip takes place in such a manner that the gel strip contacts the two electrodes. The determination further comprises an opening of a sterile packaging of the gel strip before the contacting of the sample with the gel strip. The sterile packaging of the gel strip is opened or partially removed, so that a handling region is covered by a remaining part of the sterile packaging after opening or partial removal of the sterile packaging. The placement of the biological material on the gel strip takes place using the opening in the sterile packaging. The positioning of the gel strip in the sample chamber comprises a positioning the gel strip including a remaining section of the sterile packaging, in such a manner that the gel strip contacts the two electrodes. The positioning of the gel strip takes place in such a manner that the remaining portion of the sterile packaging does not contact the electrodes. The placement of the biological material comprises a contacting step of the sample with an adhesive strip or non-woven fiber material serving as a carrier. The positioning of the carrier comprises a positioning of the adhesive strip in the sample chamber. The adhesive strip or the non-woven fiber material is attached to a lid for closing the sample chamber that the adhesive strips or the non-woven fiber material, is after closing positioned within the sample chamber. The determination further comprises a closing step of the sample chamber with the lid, so that the adhesive strip or the non-woven fiber material is positioned within the sample chamber after closing. The placement of the biological material comprises an insertion of a micro-filter serving as the carrier in a gas or liquid flow. The positioning of the carrier comprises a positioning of the micro-filter in the sample chamber. The micro-filter is attached to a lid for closing the sample chamber and partially comprises an area, in which the lid consists of an opening, so that the gas or the liquid flow flows through the opening in the lid through the micro-filter. The determination further comprises the closing step of the opening in the lid and the closing of the sample chamber with the lid, so that the micro-filter is positioned within the sample chamber after closing. The insertion comprises a pumping of the liquid growth medium from a storage tank into the sample chamber. The pumping of the liquid growth medium comprises an exertion of force on an elastic region of the storage tank, so that the liquid growth medium flows into the sample chamber, over a liquid connection with a valve. The pumping of the liquid growth medium comprises the exertion of force on an elastic region of the sample chamber or the lid of the sample chamber, so that the volume of the sample chamber reduces and a fluid present in the closed sample chamber flows out of the chamber. The pumping also comprises a releasing of the stress of the elastic region, so that the volume of the sample chamber increases. The determination further comprises reading of a temperature/time-integration unit to obtain a temperature/time-integral between a point of time before the implementation of the electrochemical measurement and the reading of the temperature/time-integration unit, evaluating the electrochemical measurement to get a quantity or concentration of the biological material at a point of time of the implementation of the electrochemical measurement, and calculating the amount or concentration of the biological material at the point of time before the implementation of the electrochemical measurement, using the temperature/time-integral. INDEPENDENT CLAIMS are included for: (1) gel strip for the {{determination of the}} <b>microbiological</b> <b>state</b> of a sample; and (2) sample container for the determination of the <b>microbiological</b> <b>state</b> of a sample. USE - For monitoring the bacterial growth in the field of pharmaceutical- and food industry. ADVANTAGE - The determination of <b>microbiological</b> <b>state</b> of sample is more efficient and easily applicable. The procedure saves time and cost by avoiding the release of microbiological material in a separate step, thus leads reduction of effort for the determination of a <b>microbiological</b> <b>state</b> of the sample...|$|E

In the present study, the natural microbial community of well and pool waters in Gellért bath was studied in detail by cultivation-based techniques. To isolate bacteria, 10 % R 2 A and minimal synthetic media (with “bath water”) with agar–agar and gellan gum were used after prolonged incubation time; moreover, polyurethane blocks covered with media were also applied. Strains were identified by sequencing their 16 S rRNA gene after grouping them by amplified rDNA restriction analysis. From each sample, the dominance of Alphaproteobacteria was characteristic though their diversity differed among samples. Members of Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, Beta- and Gamma-proteobacteria, Deinococcus–Thermus, and Bacteroidetes were also identified. Representatives of Deinococcus–Thermus phylum appeared only in the pool water. The largest groups in the pool water belonged to the Tistrella and Chelatococcus genera.

40|$|Honey is {{the natural}} sweet {{substance}} produced by bees from the nectar or secretions of plants or from excretions of plant-sucking insects, which the bees collect, transform by combining with specific substances of their own, deposit, dehydrate, store, and leave in honeycombs to ripen and mature. The physical properties of honey make it versatile and applicable to several industries. High consumer demand for honey consequently leads to widespread adulteration. In the present study, fifteen honey samples were collected from various parts of Kerala, India and classified into three categories: market samples, raw/wild samples, and industrial samples. The samples were then analysed for the following parameters: organoleptic features, physicochemical properties, biochemical characteristics, and <b>microbiological</b> <b>state.</b> The values obtained for physicochemical and biochemical analysis were compared to Standard values provided by the Bureau of Indian Standards.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to evaluate the <b>microbiological</b> <b>state</b> and the dynamics of the mammary infections of organic farms in North Spain to discover if the high somatic cell count (SCC) observed in these farms is associated to a high incidence of mastitis. Microbiological cultures and SCC were performed in 8, 496 foremilk samples collected from 160 cows in five representative organic farms from February 2006 to January 2008. Even though 79. 3 % of cultures were positive, only 21. 2 % of the total fit our diagnosis of mastitis (clinical, subclinical and chronic). The great prevalence of Corynebacterium bovis (teat canal-region pathogen) in the positive cultures that did not fit the mastitis diagnosis criteria (nearly 70 %) compared with those that did (27 %) was found to be related to lack of post-milking teat disinfection. The study prevalence of mastitis was 69. 2 % (66. 7 % subclinical mastitis, 27. 8 % clinical mastitis); the mean monthly prevalence was 47. 4 %; the mean monthly incidence was 12. 9 % and the mean duration of infection was 3. 84 ± 3. 98 months The high SCC in foremilk samples from old cows (three or more lactations) not diagnosed as mastitis compared to the heifers, reflects a worsening health status of the animals over time.

40|$|BACKGROUND: In February 2012, the National Cardiovascular Homograft Bank (NCHB) {{became the}} first tissue bank outside of North America to receive {{accreditation}} from the American Association of Tissue Banks. From 2008 to 2009, NCHB had been decontaminating its cardiovascular homografts with penicillin and streptomycin. The antibiotic decontamination protocol was changed in January 2010 as amikacin and vancomycin were recommended, in order to cover bacteria isolated from post-recovery and post- antibiotic incubation tissue cultures. AIM: The objective {{of this study is}} to determine the optimal incubation conditions for decontamination of homografts by evaluating the potencies of amikacin and vancomycin in different incubation conditions. Retrospective reviews of microbiological results were also performed for homografts recovered from 2008 to 2012, to compare the effectiveness of penicillin-streptomycin versus the amikacin-vancomycin regimens. METHODS: Based on <b>microbiological</b> assays <b>stated</b> in United States Pharmacopeia 31, potency of amikacin was evaluated by turbidimetric assay using Staphylococcus aureus, while vancomycin was by diffusion assay using Bacillus subtilis sporulate. Experiments were performed to investigate the potencies of individual antibiotic 6 -hours post incubation at 4 °C and 37 °C and 4 °C for 24 hours, after the results suggested that amikacin was more potent at lower temperature. FINDINGS: Tissue incubation at 4 °C for 24 hours is optimal for both antibiotics, especially for amikacin, as its potency falls drastically at 37 °C. CONCLUSION: The decontamination regimen of amikacin-vancomycin at 4 °C for 24 hours is effective. Nevertheless, it is imperative to monitor microbiological trends closely and evaluate the efficacy of current antibiotics regimen against emerging strains of micro-organisms...|$|R

For this, water and gills were collected from fish farming at six locations in Itapecuru- Mirim County, Maranhão <b>State.</b> <b>Microbiological</b> water analyses revealed contamination by total coliforms, Escherichia coli and heterotrophic bacteria. In the gills, we observed a diversity of Gram-positive and Gramnegative bacteria. The tissue lesions were: lamellar fusion, interlamellar hyperplasia, sub-epithelial edema and telangiectasia. Inflammatory lesions were not observed. Significant statistical difference (p > 0. 05) was not detected when comparing different gills lesions during rainy and dry season. The correlation between lesion and pond type was statistically different (p < 0. 05) for lamellar fusion and interlamellar hyperplasia which occurred more frequently at ground ponds. Regarding the frequency of lesions in the different fish species, there was statistical difference (p < 0. 05), and the tambacu was more sensitive to lamellar fusion while tilapia was more sensitive for the other lesions. In relation to the sampling stations, there was statistical difference for all the gill lesions. In conclusion, tissue lesions are nonspecific and function as a defense mechanism against polluted aquatic environments, without infectious character...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis was to study the interactions of microbial activity, biocide usage and creation, and chemical changes in the papermaking process. The main focus was on oxidative biocide systems. In addition, new measurement and biocide production methods were applied to papermaking, and evaluated for the monitoring {{and control of the}} <b>microbiological</b> <b>state</b> and biocide usage. The measurement methods were based on portable handheld online equipments whereas the biocide production was based on electrochemical generation of biocides. The trials were mainly performed in pilot scale with actual process samples and complemented with a few laboratory trials. Most of the pilot results were verified in several field studies at paper machines. In the studies also the applicability of monitoring tools were evaluated. Biocide dosing itself, paper machine breaks, and poor management of broke generated chemical variations, which were detrimental to the papermaking process. Spoilage of broke due to poor broke management and poor biocide performance decreased the system pH, increased the conductivity, and caused the defects to the web. These chemical variations were also observed to cause variations in the cationic demand values. This probably caused unwanted particle flocculation generating the spots and holes to the web. Base paper defects were observed to cause runnability problems also at the coating machine. This cyclicity, where chemical variations cause breaks and breaks cause chemical variations, should be eliminated in order to restore good runnability. When revealing many such cause-effect relations and hidden phenomena, hand-held instrumentation gives additional references for existing basic measurements such as pH, conductivity, and redox potential. This work also took in use measurements which have not been traditionally used in papermaking such as measurement of halogens, dissolved calcium, and dissolved oxygen contents. ATP content measurement using a portable luminometer was found to be useful and easy-to-use method for evaluating microbial activity and optimizing biocide performance at paper mills. This thesis introduces a new biocide concept which can be used to prevent both microbial and biocidal problems described above. The results demonstrate how electrochemical on-site production can decrease chemical variations and improve biocide performance compared to current best practices offering an efficient and economically attractive alternative for microbial control...|$|E
40|$|A {{microbiota}} é um fator de grande importância na qualidade e conservação de vegetais minimamente processados. Muitos microrganismos podem afetar adversamente a qualidade e a segurança desses produtos, {{considerando que}} microrganismos patogênicos, que normalmente não estariam presentes, passam a compor a microbiota contaminante decorrente do manuseio a que são submetidos. Objetivou-se, neste trabalho, determinar a qualidade microbiológica de hortaliças, anterior e posteriormente ao processo de sanitização, como também o período final da vida-de-prateleira dos produtos sanitizados, avaliando-se a presença de Listeria sp., Listeria monocytogenes e Salmonella sp. Foram analisadas amostras de agrião, alface, cenoura ralada, espinafre, repolho verde ralado e rúcula minimamente processados. As amostras não sanitizadas foram analisadas no dia da coleta, e as sanitizadas analisadas a 1, 5 e 8 dias após o processamento, a fim de determinar a condição microbiológica dos produtos. As hortaliças foram armazenadas sob temperatura de 5 ºC. Salmonella sp. foi detectada em 12, 7 % das amostras, enquanto L. monocytogenes não foi encontrada em nenhuma delas, embora outras espécies de Listeria tenham sido isoladas de alface e cenoura. A presença de Salmonella sp. tornaram 16 amostras impróprias para o consumo humano, de acordo com a RDC nº 12.

40|$|The {{main goal}} of this work – {{determine}} the influence of storage to the quality and microbiology of meat, when storage is conducted according to regalement rules, or the storage is conducted breaking the rules by storing meat together with vegetables in the freezer with 4 °C and 6 °C° temperature during 30 days period. The tasks of this work: 1. To research the pH changes when the storage regime is changing. 2. To determine the common microbiology pollution (BMS and pH), when the storage conditions are optimal, and when the storage conditions are deliberately broken. 3. To determine bacteria of salmonella and jersinia, storing meat is determined conditions, and then changing the conditions deliberately. The research shown, that storing meat at reglamented conditions for 14 days period at 4 °C, the example held out very well, with pH 5. 54, and the example stored at 6 °C held out worse (pH 5. 55), than the example stored at 4 °C. That could influence the fact, that lower temperature influenced the holding out of meat. Conclusions: 1. Meat {{is more likely to be}} damaged, when it is stored together with another food products, and the <b>microbiological</b> <b>state</b> of meat was especially damaged, when it was stored with vegetables. When meat has been stored together with vegetables at 4 °C temperature, the amount of microorganisms after 14 days increased from 9, 6 mil 1 cm 3. to 890 mil. 1 cm 3, and after 30 days the amount of microorganisms increased from 9, 6 mil. 1 cm 3. to 8, 9 milij. 1 cm 3,comparing with starting value. 2. Storing meat with fruits keeping all process steps (packing, temperature, humidity), it can be held out at good quality, but the SVT control is not possible. When meat has been stored together with vegetables at 6 °C temperature, the amount of microorganisms after 14 days increased from, 6 mil. 1 cm 3. to 89 mil, 1 cm 3, and after 30 days the amount of microorganisms increased from 9, 6 mil. 1 cm 3. to 980 milij. 1 cm 3. 3. Holding meat in freezers, compatible with all hygiene requirements, it was noticed, that at 4 °C temperature microorganisms propagated 9 - 10 times slower, then at 6 °C temperature. When the starting amount of microorganisms is 980 thousand/ 1 cm 3, after 14 days at 4 °C temperature the amount was 9, 8 mil/ 1 cm 3, and after 30 days the amount was 89 mil 1 cm 3. At 6 °C temperature the amount was accordingly 87 mil. 1 cm 3. and 980 mil 1 cm 3. 4.

40|$|AbstractVibrio cholerae {{can enter}} into a viable but non-culturable (VBNC) state {{in order to survive}} in {{unfavourable}} environments. In this study, we studied the roles of five physicochemical and <b>microbiological</b> factors or <b>states,</b> namely, different strains, growth phases, oxygen, temperature, and starvation, on the development of VBNC of V. cholerae in artificial sea water (ASW). Different strains of the organism, the growth phase, and oxygen levels affected the progress of VBNC development. It was found that the VBNC state was induced faster in V. cholerae serogroup O 1 classical biotype strain O 395 than in O 1 El Tor biotype strains C 6706 and N 16961. When cells in different growth phases were used for VBNC induction, stationary-phase cells lost their culturability more quickly than exponential-phase cells, while induction of a totally non-culturable state took longer to achieve for stationary-phase cells in all three strains, suggesting that heterogeneity of cells should be considered. Aeration strongly accelerated the loss of culturability. During the development of the VBNC state, the culturable cell count under aeration conditions was almost 106 -fold lower than under oxygen-limited conditions for all three strains. The other two factors, temperature and nutrients-rich environment, may prevent the induction of VBNC cells. At 22 °C or 37 °C in ASW, most of the cells rapidly died and the culturable cell count reduced from about 108 CFU/mL to 106 – 105 CFU/mL. The total cell counts showed that cells that lost viability were decomposed, and the viable cell counts were the same as culturable cell counts, indicating that the cells did not reach the VBNC state. VBNC state development was blocked when ASW was supplied with Luria-Bertani broth (LB), but it was not affected in ASW with M 9, suggesting that specific nutrients in LB may prevent the development of VBNC state. These results revealed that the five factors evaluated in this study had different roles during the progress of VBNC induction. Changing a single factor could influence and even block the development of the VBNC state. These findings provide new insight to help design further studies to better understand the mechanisms which trigger the development and regulation of the VBN...|$|R

The {{drinking water}} samples were collected in the farm milk storage rooms of 30 farms with subsequently made analyses. The pre – selected chemical and <b>microbiological</b> indicators were <b>stated</b> according to the regulation No. 252 / 2004 Coll. (pH, conductivity, chemical oxygen demand, colour, turbidity, Fe, ammonia ions, nitrites, nitrates, colony count growing at 36 °C, colony count growing at 22 °C, coliform bacteria, Escherichia coli, Ca, Mg, Na, K, Zn, Cu, Mn, Pb, Cr and Ni). The statistical evaluation was performed in the obtained data file and these data were compared with the limit va­lues given by the regulation. The nitrate content ranged between 1 and 40. 7 mg L− 1 with an average of 15. 6 mg L− 1. The pH values varied from 5. 71 to 8. The chloride concentration geometrical means was 7. 57 mg L− 1 1. The Ca average concentration 58. 5 mg L− 1 {{was in the middle of}} the recommended interval 40 – 80 mg L− 1. The geometric means in Mg content was 7. 9 mg L− 1 being under the recommended va­lue 20 – 30 mg L− 1. The Cu, Pb, Cr and Ni limit values were not exceeded. The limit values in microbiological analyses were exceeded 18 x in coliform bacteria, 10 x in enterococci, 5 x in Escherichia coli. The microbiological colonies growing at 36 °C exceeded limit 9 x, those growing at 22 °C 5 x. Further, differences are compared between the organic and conventional farms, and between farms producing milk in different type of LFAs (less favourable areas) and farms not included in these ­areas. The difference found out between the chloride concentrations in organic (6. 56 mg L− 1) and conventional farms (18. 2 mg L− 1; p < 0. 05) was statistically significant. Locality or altitude, where a given far is situated, were another classifying criterion. A significant dependence was only found out in nitrate content, which decreased (p < 0. 05) with increasing altitude (the correlation coefficient value − 0. 39). It can correspond with the soil use decrease – a lesser fertilization intensity. Statistically significant dif­fe­ren­ces were found out in hardness value as well as in Ca, Mg contents connected with that in all reference criterions. The hardness was clearly lower (1. 13 mmol L− 1) in organic farms as compared with concentration 2. 27 mmol L− 1 in conventional ones. It is, however, only a supplementary indicator according to the respective regulation. No statistical significance was found among microbiological finding va­lues in any case...|$|R
