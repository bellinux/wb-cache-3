5|$|De Materia Medica is {{the prime}} {{historical}} {{source of information about}} the medicines used by the Greeks, Romans, and other cultures of antiquity. The work also records the Dacian names for some plants, which otherwise would have been lost. The work presents about 600 plants in all, along with some animals and <b>mineral</b> <b>substances,</b> and around 1000 medicines made from these sources. Botanists have not always found Dioscorides' plants easy to identify from his short descriptions, partly because he had naturally described plants and animals from southeastern Europe, whereas by the sixteenth century his book was in use all over Europe and across the Islamic world. This meant that people attempted to force a match between the plants they knew and those described by Dioscorides, leading to what could be catastrophic results.|$|E

DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The {{sealing material}} (5) comprises a water-swellable durable-elastic polymer and/or a water-swellable durable-elastic <b>mineral</b> <b>substance,</b> which are present in a pre-swollen gel state before introducing into the voids. The pre-swelling degree of the polymer and/or <b>mineral</b> <b>substance</b> before introducing into the voids is 10 : 1 - 14 : 1 related to the non-swollen state. The remaining swelling degree of the polymer and/or <b>mineral</b> <b>substance</b> is 15 : 1 - 30 : 1 related to pre-swollen state. The particles (25 wt. %) of the polymer and/or <b>mineral</b> <b>substance</b> in a dry non-swollen state have a grain size of 50 - 350 mu m. The maximum grain size of the polymer and/or <b>mineral</b> <b>substance</b> in the dry non-swollen state is less than 500 mu m. The swelling pressure of the polymer and/or <b>mineral</b> <b>substance</b> is 10 - 70 bar during swelling in water in a closed void. The sealing material has a natural polymer and a synthetic polymer. An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is included for a method for sealing voids in building materials and/or building parts. USE - Sealing material useful in a cartridge, for sealing voids in building materials and/or building parts (claimed), and for horizontal and/or vertical sealing of masonry walls. ADVANTAGE - The sealing material economically provides simple, reliable, safe and complete sealing against the outside water in a maintenance-free manner, effectively prevents moisture coming from the outside through cracks, can be economically and efficiently produced with high durability, high degree of flexibility and improved vapor diffusion resistance, and completely suppresses the water transport process through the capillary and/ or pore system of the building materials and/or building parts...|$|R

60|$|I {{spent the}} rest of the morning in charmed {{transition}} between the hot yellow streets and the cool grey interiors of the churches. The greyness everywhere was lighted up by the scintillation, on vault and entablature, of mosaics more or less archaic, but always brilliant and elaborate, and everywhere too by the same deep amaze of the fact that, while centuries had worn themselves away and empires risen and fallen, these little cubes of coloured glass had stuck in their allotted places and kept their freshness. I have no space for a list of the various shrines so distinguished, and, to tell the truth, my memory of them has already become a very generalised and undiscriminated record. The total aspect of the place, its sepulchral stillness, its absorbing perfume of evanescence and decay and mortality, confounds the distinctions and blurs the details. The Cathedral, which is vast and high, has been excessively modernised, and was being still more so by a lavish application of tinsel and cotton- velvet in preparation for the centenary feast of St. Apollinaris, which befalls next month. Things on this occasion are to be done handsomely, and a fair Ravennese informed me that a single family had contributed three thousand francs towards a month's vesper- music. It seemed to me hereupon that I should like in the August twilight to wander into the quiet nave of San Apollinare, and look up at the great mosaics through the resonance of some fine chanting. I remember distinctly enough, however, the tall basilica of San Vitale, of octagonal shape, like an exchange or custom-house--modelled, I believe, upon St. Sophia at Constantinople. It has a great span of height and a great solemnity, as well as a choir densely pictured over on arch and apse with mosaics of the time of Justinian. These are regular pictures, full of movement, gesture and perspective, and just enough sobered in hue by time to bring home their remoteness. In the middle of the church, under the great dome, sat an artist whom I envied, making at an effective angle a study of the choir and its broken lights, its decorated altar and its incrusted twinkling walls. The picture, when finished, will hang, I suppose, on the library wall of some person of taste; but even if it is much better than is probable--I did n't look at it--all his taste won't tell the owner, unless he has been there, in just what a soundless, mouldering, out-of-the-way corner of old Italy it was painted. An even better place for an artist fond of dusky architectural nooks, except that here the dusk is excessive and he would hardly be able to tell his green from his red, is the extraordinary little church of the Santi Nazaro e Celso, otherwise known as the mausoleum of Galla Placidia. This is perhaps on the whole the spot in Ravenna where the impression is of most sovereign authority and most thrilling force. It consists of a narrow low-browed cave, shaped like a Latin cross, every inch of which except the floor is covered with dense symbolic mosaics. Before you and on each side, through the thick brown light, loom three enormous barbaric sarcophagi, containing the remains of potentates of the Lower Empire. It is as if history had burrowed under ground to escape from research and you had fairly run it to earth. On the right lie the ashes of the Emperor Honorius, and in the middle those of his sister, Galla Placidia, a lady who, I believe, had great adventures. On the other side rest the bones of Constantius III. The place might be a small natural grotto lined with glimmering <b>mineral</b> <b>substances,</b> and there is something quite tremendous in being shut up so closely with these three imperial ghosts. The shadow of the great Roman name broods upon the huge sepulchres and abides for ever within the narrow walls.|$|E
