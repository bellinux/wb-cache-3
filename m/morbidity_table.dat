The national TB case rate also steadily decreased during this period (Table 1). In 2000, 6 % of cases were reported in children under 15 years old, 10 % in persons aged 15 - 24 years, 34 % in persons aged 25 - 44 years, 28 % in persons aged 45 - 64 years, and 22 % in persons aged 65 years and older (Table 2). During 1992 - 2000, there was a decline in both the number of cases reported in each of these age groups and the respective TB case rates.

40|$|The MMWR week is {{the week}} of the {{epidemiologic}} year for which the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS) disease report is assigned by the reporting local or state health department for the purposes of MMWR disease incidence reporting and publishing.

Since MMWR week may be based on any of several dates relevant to calculating disease incidence and that assignment may vary by state or condition, analyses defining temporal notifiable disease incidence patterns should determine whether analysis by MMWR week or another epidemiologically-relevant date type is more appropriate for their needs. MMWR week is used to support public health reporting in the MMWR weekly <b>morbidity</b> <b>tables</b> and the annual Summary of Notifiable Diseases, United States.

5000|$|In {{order to}} price {{insurance}} products, and ensure the solvency of insurance companies through adequate reserves, actuaries must develop projections of future insured events (such as death, sickness, and disability). To do this, actuaries develop mathematical {{models of the}} rates and timing of the events. They do this by studying the incidence of these events in the recent past, and sometimes developing expectations of how these past events will change over time (for example, whether the progressive reductions in mortality rates in the past will continue) and deriving expected rates of such events in the future, usually based on the age or other relevant characteristics of the population. An actuary's job is to form a comparison between people at risk of death and people who actually died {{to come up with}} a probability of death for a person at each age number, defined as qx in an equation. When analyzing a population, one of the main sources used to gather the required information is insurance by obtaining individual records that belong to a specific population.

40|$|In 2005, infants {{admitted}} for {{intensive care}} were less mature and of lower birth weight. More infants received surfactant and fewer survivors had received post-natal steroids (table 2). There {{was no difference}} in the median (range) length of stay for survivors (101 (86 – 278) days in 2005 vs 90 (76 – 237) in 1995) but the cumulative total increased to 2483 days from 1358. This study suggests that the survival of extremely preterm infants has significantly improved in the last decade. This will require confirmation in larger UK/Irish populations, but the results are similar to those from other European populations. 4 In 2005 we observed that (1) more mothers received antenatal steroids, (2) the intensive care infants were less mature and of lower birth weight and (3) more infants received surfactant. This is suggestive of a more proactive approach to perinatal care, which {{is an important factor in}} improving out-comes but not a consistent finding across European populations. 1 5 Interpretation of trends in short term <b>morbidities</b> (<b>table</b> 2) is difficult due to the small number of survi-vors in this cohort, but the trends are similar to those from other European populations. 5 It is important to regularly redefine the outcomes at extremely low gestations. Such data should not be dependant on research projects, for example EPICure 2, which are dependant on time-constrained, competitive funding. Rather, such data should be avail-able from routinely collected national peri-natal statistics or perinatal information networks. We suggest the development of a register of extremely preterm infants born in the UK and Ireland, similar to that used in Finland, to facilitate provision of data on both short and long term outcomes. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we have {{described}} {{the first part of}} an experimental study of the epidemiology of mouse typhoid. One set of data has been presented on the basis of which little or no analysis has been attempted. The immediate object has been rather to collect materials than to undertake to account for the phenomena encountered. It is obvious that the factors involved in the inquiry are intricate, but it is believed that they are not necessarily or all beyond disentanglement. About 500 mice in all have been studied in an experimental village, brought together in increments among a population in which mouse typhoid experimentally induced was prevailing. The results have been presented according to two phenomena; namely, mortality or death rate, and bacillus carriage rate. The material does not lend itself to consideration according to morbidity rates. If it were established that every instance of attack, when not fatal, was attended by carrier production for the bacillus of mouse typhoid, reliable <b>morbidity</b> <b>tables</b> could be constructed. In the absence of this certain criterion, the materials here presented can be dealt with only as mortality data. This fact is attended with obvious disadvantages in respect to the epidemiological material assembled regarding infectious disease in man. In spite, however, of the drawbacks, it is already evident that the results obtained by the sort of inquiry here described may come to throw no inconsiderable light on moot problems on the origin, mode of spread, and manner of decline of epidemic diseases in general. The analysis of the strains by selecting single cells and thus establishing substrains has yielded results which may eventually have value in explaining fluctuations in virulence. Among the positive data arising from the experiments with such cultures are, first, that there have been obtained by mechanical means from the ordinary bacteriologically pure culture, single cell strains exhibiting slightly different pathogenic activity, whether administered by mouth or parenterally, and second, that more regular results are obtained with intraperitoneal injections of these strains than with the parent strain. Among the negative results to be recorded are the failures of two single cell strains to incite an epidemic among mice under conditions known to be suitable when the parent strain is used...|$|R

Results In our conviction we consider the excision of tumors with total obstruction of esophageal lumen palliative,even if the surgical procedure is apparently complete.

40|$|This {{report is}} one of several {{appearing}} as Healthy People Statistical Notes that evaluate methodological issues pertaining to summary measures.

40|$|This article {{integrates}} {{two methods}} that analyze {{the implications of}} various causes of death for life expectancy. One of the methods attributes changes in life expectancy to various causes of death; the other method examines the effect of removing deaths from a particular cause on life expectancy. This integration is accomplished by new formulas that make clearer the interactions among causes of death in determining life expectancy. We apply our approach to changes in life expectancy in the United States between 1970 and 2000. We demonstrate, and explain analytically, the paradox that cancer is responsible for more years of life lost in 2000 than in 1970 {{despite the fact that}} declines in cancer mortality contributed to advances in life expectancy between 1970 and 2000. causes of death, decomposition method, decomposition technique, demography, life expectancy, life <b>tables,</b> <b>morbidity,</b> mortality...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND. The {{national}} objectives in Healthy People 2000, drafted by health professionals aware of currently available public health interventions, represent {{a wealth of}} information about near-term future mortality and <b>morbidity.</b> METHODS. Life <b>table</b> methods were used to calculate the impact of projected changes in mortality and activity limitation rates on life expectancy and expected disability years. RESULTS. Meeting the mortality objectives would increase life expectancy at birth by 1. 5 to 2. 1 years, raising life expectancy to 76. 6 to 77. 2 years. In addition, meeting the target for disability from chronic conditions would increase the number of years of life without activity limitations from 66. 8 years to 69. 3 - 69. 7 years. If the targets for coronary heart disease and unintentional injury were changed to reflect recent trends, a greater improvement in life expectancy at birth would be achieved: from 1. 8 to 2. 7 years to 76. 9 to 77. 8 years. CONCLUSION. Meeting the targets would have an important demographic impact. Including changes in the coronary heart disease and injuries targets, life expectancy in the year 2000 would be above the middle of the ranges used in current Census Bureau projections...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to {{validate}} new rapid diagnostic tests and to investigate if improving microbiological diagnostics influences patient outcome and management. Therefore a short introduction in the underlying clinical syndrome is warranted. Sepsis is a major complication of infection with a high <b>morbidity</b> and mortality. <b>Table</b> 1 shows the diagnostic criteria of sepsis and severe sepsis (20). In their review Angus and Wax (3) cited several studies that reported mortality rates varying from 20 to 52 %. From a point prevalence survey of Van Gestel et al. (66) it was calculated that the annual number of admissions for severe sepsis in Dutch ICUs was 8643 ± 929 cases/year, which represents 0. 054 % of the Dutch population, 0. 61 % of hospital admissions and 11 % of ICU admissions. In 2008 Surviving Sepsis Campaign published international guidelines for management of severe sepsis and septic shock (20). They used the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system for assessment of quality of evidence from high (A) to very low (D) and to determine the strength of recommendations. Their key recommendations, relevant for microbiologists and clinicians alike were among others: obtain blood cultures before starting antibiotic therapy (1 C); administer broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy within 1 h of diagnosis of severe sepsis with or without septic shock (1 B, 1 D); reassess antibiotic therapy with microbiology and clinical data to narrow coverage, when appropriate (1 C) ...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE—To {{examine whether}} {{eliminating}} smoking {{will lead to}} a {{reduction in the number of}} years lived with disability (that is, absolute compression of <b>morbidity).</b>  DESIGN—Multistate life <b>table</b> calculations based on the longitudinal GLOBE study (the Netherlands) combined with the Longitudinal Study of Aging (LSOA, United States of America).  SETTING—the Netherlands.  SUBJECTS—Dutch nationals aged 30 - 74 years living in the city of Eindhoven and surrounding municipalities (GLOBE) and United States citizens age 70  and over (LSOA).  MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES—Life expectancy with and without disability and total life expectancy at ages 30  and 70.  RESULTS—A non-smoking population on balance spends fewer years with disability than a mixed smoking-non-smoking population. Although non-smokers have lower mortality risks and thus are exposed to disability over a longer period of time, their lower incidence of disability and higher recovery from disability yield a net reduction of the length of time spent with disability (at age 30 : − 0. 9 years in men and − 1. 1 years in women) and increases the length of time lived without disability (2. 5  and 1. 9  years, for men and women, respectively). These outcomes indicate that elimination of smoking will extend life and the period of disability free life, and will compress disability into a shorter period.  CONCLUSIONS—Eliminating smoking will not only extend life and result in an increase in the number of years lived without disability, but will also compress disability into a shorter period. This implies that the commonly found trade off between longer life and a longer period with disability does not apply. Interventions to discourage smoking should receive high priority.    Keywords: smoking; morbidit...|$|R
