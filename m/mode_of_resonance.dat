50|$|When an {{external}} forcing is applied directly (parallel {{to the plane}} of the oscillatory displacement) to the system around the frequency of its natural frequency, then the fundamental <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> <b>resonance</b> can be achieved. The oscillatory amplitude outside this frequency region is typically smaller than the resonant peak and the input amplitude. The amplitude of the resonant peak and the bandwidth of resonance is dependent on the damping conditions and is quantified by the dimensionless quantity Q factor. Higher resonant modes and resonant modes at different planes (transverse, lateral, rotational and flexural) are usually triggered at higher frequencies. The specific frequency vicinity of these modes depends on the nature and boundary conditions of each mechanical system. Additionally, subharmonics, superharmonics or subsuperharmonics of each mode can also be excited at the right boundary conditions.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{investigates the}} use of chains of spheres to produce impulses. An {{ultrasonic}} horn is used to generate high amplitude sinusoidal signals. These are then input into chains of spheres, held together using a minimal force. The result is a non-linear, dispersive system, within which solitary waves can exist. The authors have discovered that resonances can be created, caused by the multiple reflection of solitary waves within the chain. The multiply-reflecting impulses can have a wide bandwidth, due to the inherent nonlinearity of the contact between spheres. It is found that the effect only occurs for certain numbers of spheres in the chain for a given input frequency, {{a result of the}} creation of a nonlinear normal <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> <b>resonance.</b> The resulting impulses have many applications, potentially creating high amplitude impulses with adjustable properties, depending on both the nature and number of spheres in the chain, and the frequency and amplitude of excitation...|$|E
40|$|Harmonic Resonance Mode Analysis (HRMA) is a {{technique}} developed to study harmonic resonance in a power system. Compared to conventional resonance analysis techniques, HRMA is a powerful method that can indicate the origin and the locations most affected by a given <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> <b>resonance.</b> The method {{has been shown to}} be effective for large scale resonance studies. However, very simplified models are used for representing power converters. With the proliferation of power converter interfaced energy sources in the future power system, there is a need to correctly model power converters in such studies. The main challenge is to correctly represent the control loops. The controllers are mostly designed in dq domain while the study is performed in phase domain. To address this problem, this paper proposes extension of HRMA to dq domain. Formulation of the problem in dq domain is presented in detail followed by verification using simple test cases. A detailed model of a voltage source converter for the aforementioned analysis is also developed and analysed using the test cases...|$|E

40|$|The {{conformal}} mapping technique (CMT) is effectively utilized in obtaining exactly the {{effective dielectric constant}} of a multilayer dielectric structure of microstrip transmission lines.

This paper presents the application of this technique in determining the closed form expressions for the resonant frequencies of higher order modes as well. The formula for resonant frequency is modified to include a mode ratio, which works on the characteristic equation of the patches of circular geometry as processed by the cavity model. Thus, an effective, simple and straightforward approach in evaluating the resonant frequencies of various modes of complex structures with multilayer dielectric of circular geometry has been proposed.

40|$|The resonating-valence-bond {{theory of}} metals {{discussed}} in this paper differs from the older theory in making use of all nine stable outer orbitals of the transition metals, for occupancy by unshared electrons and for use in bond formation; the number of valency electrons is consequently considered to be much larger for these metals than has been hitherto accepted.

40|$|This {{contribution}} {{presents the}} analysis of an earlier proposed double membrane sensor for measuring mass density and rheological properties of liquids with respect to different driving modes. Concerning practical implementation the sensor mounting and {{the stability of the}} polyethylene foil, currently used as membrane material, are investigated. The sensor is based on two opposed membranes vibrating in parallel where a sample liquid is enclosed between the membranes. The excitation and read-out mechanisms of the membrane vibration are based on Lorentz forces induced in a static magnetic field. Each membrane carries three conductive paths for excitation, which can be separately connected to the excitation currents. This allows the excitation of the first and second modes of vibration and enables prestressing the second mode of oscillation. Analyzing the material-stability of the used polyethylene foil shows a strong long-term drift of the modulus of elasticity and an increase of internal damping with increasing temperature. Comparing the resonance frequency of the fundamental mode with earlier measurements achieved with the second <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> <b>resonance</b> indicates an increased sensitivity to density featuring a reasonably sustained quality factor for high viscosities.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{measurements of}} a small-scale, high-frequency pulsed detonation tube. The device utilized {{a mixture of}} H 2 fuel and air, which was injected into the device at frequencies of up to 1200 Hz. Pulsed detonations were demonstrated in an 8 -inch long combustion volume, at about 600 Hz, for the quarter wave <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> <b>resonance.</b> The primary objective of this experiment was to measure the generated thrust. A mean value of thrust was measured up to 6. 0 lb, corresponding to H 2 flow based specific impulse of 2970 s. This value is comparable to measurements in H 2 -fueled pulsed detonation engines (PDEs). The injection and detonation frequency for this new experimental case was much higher than typical PDEs, where frequencies are usually less than 100 Hz. The compact size of the device and high frequency of detonation yields a thrust-per-unit-volume of approximately 2. 0 pounds per cubic inch, and compares favorably with other experiments, which typically have thrust-per-unit-volume of order 0. 01 pound per cubic inch. This much higher volumetric efficiency results in a potentially much more practical device than the typical PDE, {{for a wide range}} of potential applications, including high-speed boundary layer separation control, for example in hypersonic engine inlets, and propulsion for small aircraft and missiles...|$|E
40|$|In {{the arena}} of {{vibration}} energy harvesting, the key technical challenges continue to be low power density and narrow operational frequency bandwidth. While the convention has relied upon the activation of the fundamental <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> <b>resonance</b> through direct excitation, this article explores a new paradigm through the employment of parametric resonance. Unlike the former, oscillatory amplitude growth is not limited due to linear damping. Therefore, the power output can potentially build up to higher levels. Additionally, it is the onset of non-linearity that eventually limits parametric resonance; hence, this approach can also potentially broaden the operating frequency range. Theoretical prediction and numerical modelling have suggested an order higher in oscillatory amplitude growth. An experimental macro-sized electromagnetic prototype (practical volume of ~ 1800 cm 3) when driven into parametric resonance, has demonstrated around 50 % increase in half power band and {{an order of magnitude}} higher peak power density normalised against input acceleration squared (293 mW cm 23 m 22 s 4 with 171. 5 mW at 0. 57 m s 22) in contrast to the same prototype directly driven at fundamental resonance (36. 5 mW cm 23 m 22 s 4 with 27. 75 mW at 0. 65 m s 22).
