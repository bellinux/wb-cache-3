Because Butler's mother received little formal education herself, she made sure that young Butler was {{given the opportunity to}} learn by bringing her reading materials that her white employers threw away, from magazines to advanced books. She also encouraged Butler to write. She bought her daughter her first typewriter when she was 10 years old, and, seeing her hard at work on a story, casually remarked that <b>maybe</b> one day <b>she</b> <b>could</b> become a writer, causing Butler to realize {{that it was possible to}} make a living as an author.

So Abby was shocked when Ashley hired Ben as a chemist for Jabot, despite Abby's objections.
