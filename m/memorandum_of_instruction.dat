These documents were “designed to pollute {{the minds of the}} junior officers.” The first is a supposed <b>Memorandum</b> <b>of</b> <b>Instructions</b> addressed to the Secretary of National Defense dated February 11, 2003, directing the full implementation of “Oplan Greenbase.” The document, purportedly signed by the President, contains a plan to capture Hashim Salamat dead or alive and to occupy the Buliok Complex at the Liguasan Marsh area in North Cotabato. Secretary Eduardo Ermita of the Office of the Presidential Adviser on the Peace Process (OPAPP) purportedly signed the other document entitled “The President’ s Four-Point Policy Framework in Addressing the Southern Philippines Secessionist/MILF Problem," [...] allegedly pursuant to the February 11 Presidential <b>Memorandum</b> <b>of</b> <b>Instructions.</b> This latter document purports to show that [...] "there is apparently a plan by the government to hold the MILF responsible for AFP-backed bombings in urban areas in Mindanao."
