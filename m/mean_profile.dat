50|$|The {{air-water}} interface is now {{endowed with}} a surface roughness {{due to the}} capillary-gravity waves, and a second phase of wave growth takes place. A wave established on the surface either spontaneously as described above, or in laboratory conditions, interacts with the turbulent mean flow in a manner described by Miles. This is the so-called critical-layer mechanism. A critical layer forms at a height where the wave speed c equals the mean turbulent flow U. As the flow is turbulent, its <b>mean</b> <b>profile</b> is logarithmic, and its second derivative is thus negative. This is precisely the condition for the mean flow to impart its energy to the interface through the critical layer. This supply of energy to the interface is destabilizing and causes the amplitude of the wave on the interface to grow in time. As in other examples of linear instability, {{the growth rate of}} the disturbance in this phase is exponential in time.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} create {{high-resolution}} gravity maps in oceanic areas, all type of data have to be used and merged to preserve each specific knowledge. For this purpose, we use marine gravity data and satellite altimetric data. Each type of measurements gives information on a specific bandwidth of the gravity spectrum. The problem of mixing such heterogeneous data {{is to keep the}} information given by the most accurate and the best spatial resolution data. Altimetric dataset is composed of the 3 year Topex/Poseidon (T/P) <b>mean</b> <b>profiles,</b> the 2 year ERS 1 <b>mean</b> <b>profiles</b> and the 2 year GEOSAT <b>mean</b> <b>profiles.</b> The data of the 168 day ERS 1 geodetic cycle are also processed and adjusted to T/P. Marine dataset consists of data acquired with a KSS 31 marine gravimeter from Bodenseewerk during special gravity surveys along regular tracks. The processing of satellite data has been already explained in details in various papers. Thus, we will focus in that paper on the pre-processing of marine data with the estimations of accuracy and large wavelength bias. This paper presents the collocation method used to merge satellite and marine data and compute free air anomaly. The quality of the estimation at the points located on the borderline between gravity and altimetric data is analysed and the effects of the sampling on the estimation are studied...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a complete theoretical framework for plasma turbulence and transport in tokamak plasmas. The fundamental scale separations present in plasma turbulence are codified as an asymptotic {{expansion in the}} ratio of the gyroradius to the equilibrium scale length. Proceeding order-by-order in this expansion, a framework for plasma turbulence is developed. It comprises an instantaneous equilibrium, the fluctuations driven by gradients in the equilibrium quantities, and the transport-timescale evolution of <b>mean</b> <b>profiles</b> of these quantities driven by the fluctuations. The equilibrium distribution functions are local Maxwellians with each flux surface rotating toroidally as a rigid body. The magnetic equillibrium is obtained from the Grad-Shafranov equation for a rotating plasma and the slow (resistive) evolution of the magnetic field is given by an evolution equation for the safety factor q. Large-scale deviations of the distribution function from a Maxwellian are given by neoclassical theory. The fluctuations are determined by the high-flow gyrokinetic equation, from which we derive the governing principle for gyrokinetic turbulence in tokamaks: the conservation and local cascade of free energy. Transport equations for the evolution of the mean density, temperature and flow velocity profiles are derived. These transport equations show how the neoclassical corrections and the fluctuations act back upon the <b>mean</b> <b>profiles</b> through fluxes and heating. The energy and entropy conservation laws for the <b>mean</b> <b>profiles</b> are derived. Total energy is conserved and there is no net turbulent heating. Entropy is produced by the action of fluxes flattening gradients, Ohmic heating, and the equilibration of mean temperatures. Finally, this framework is condensed, in the low-Mach-number limit, to a concise set of equations suitable for numerical implementation. Comment: 113 pages, 3 figure...|$|R

To achieve this, a linear temporal stability analysis and a spatio-temporal stability analysis of a low-density round gas jet injected vertically upwards into a high-density ambient gas were performed by assuming three different sets of mean velocity and density profiles. The flow was assumed to be isothermal and locally parallel. Viscous and diffusive effects were ignored. The mean flow parameters were represented as the sum of the mean value and a small normal-mode fluctuation. A second order differential equation governing the pressure disturbance amplitude was derived from the basic conservation equations.
