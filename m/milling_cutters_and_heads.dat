40|$|Milling is {{a process}} of {{producing}} flat and complex shapes with the use of multi-tooth cutting tool, which is called a <b>milling</b> <b>cutter</b> <b>and</b> the cutting edges are called teeth. The axis of rotation of the cutting tool is perpendicular to the direction of feed, either parallel or perpendicular to the machined surface. The machine tool that traditionally performs this operation is a milling machine. Milling is an interrupted cutting operation: the teeth of the <b>milling</b> <b>cutter</b> enter <b>and</b> exit the work during each revolution. This interrupted cutting action subjects the teeth to a cycle of impact force and thermal shock on every rotation. The tool material <b>and</b> <b>cutter</b> geometry must be designed to withstand these conditions. Cutting fluids are essential for most milling operations.

40|$|Abstract:- Milling {{machine is}} one of the {{important}} machining operations. In this operation the work piece is fed against a rotating cylindrical tool. The rotating tool consists of multiple cutting edges (multipoint cutting tool). Normally axis of rotation of feed given to the work piece. Milling operation is distinguished from other machining operations on the basis of orientation between the tool axis and the feed direction; however, in other operations like drilling, turning, etc. the tool is fed in the direction parallel to axis of rotation. The cutting tool used in milling operation is called <b>milling</b> <b>cutter,</b> which consists of multiple edges called teeth. The machine tool that performs the milling operations by producing required relative motion between work piece and tool is called milling machine. It provides the required relative motion under very controlled conditions. These conditions will be discussed later in this unit as milling speed, feed rate and depth of cut. Normally, the milling operation creates plane surfaces. Other geometries can also be created by milling machine. Milling operation is considered an interrupted cutting operation teeth of <b>milling</b> <b>cutter</b> enter <b>and</b> exit the work during each revolution.
