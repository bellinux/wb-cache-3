30|$|In the {{background}} of cloud computing, the <b>medical</b> data <b>administrator</b> in the outsourced database model cancels his data center, entrusts the database to the cloud service provider instead of the <b>medical</b> data <b>administrator</b> to manage and maintain the database, and provides the remote database service for the <b>medical</b> data <b>administrator</b> and the <b>medical</b> personnel or the patient personnel. Outsourcing databases [4] have many advantages over local databases; on the one hand, <b>medical</b> data <b>administrators</b> can save the cost of purchasing database hardware and software, hiring professionals to manage the database, and handing the database to cloud service providers for less service costs; on the other hand, because the cloud service provider has the resource concentration advantage, so <b>medical</b> data <b>administrators</b> outsource the database to cloud service providers and can efficiently share resources with other medical personnel or patients. However, for <b>medical</b> data <b>administrators</b> and <b>medical</b> personnel or patients, the local database is trustworthy and the cloud service provider may not be trusted, so the use of outsourced database services will face many security threats, such as data loss, tampering, and leakage.|$|R
