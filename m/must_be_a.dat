They attacked, crippling Yorktown with two torpedoes; she lost all power and developed a 23-degree list to port. Five torpedo bombers and two fighters were shot down in this attack.|$|E

5|$|At {{the heart}} of this epic, Lee relays another {{personal}} story that impacts intensely, especially as the song breaks during the bridge and her voice takes flight like never before.

5|$|Common {{chemical}} theory {{at that time}} held that an acid {{is a compound that}} contains oxygen (remnants of this survive in the German and Dutch names of oxygen: sauerstoff or zuurstof, both translating into English as acid substance), so a number of chemists, including Claude Berthollet, suggested that Scheele's dephlogisticated muriatic acid air <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> combination of oxygen and the yet undiscovered element, muriaticum.|$|E

A 'blocking minority' can only be formed by at least 4 member states representing at least 35% of the EU population.|$|E

5|$|The {{observed}} {{power output}} of 4.7 gigawatts is challenging to explain from tidal heating alone, so {{the main source}} of heat remains a mystery. Most scientists think the observed heat flux of Enceladus is not enough to maintain the subsurface ocean, and therefore any subsurface ocean <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> remnant of a period of higher eccentricity and tidal heating, or the heat is produced through another mechanism.|$|E
