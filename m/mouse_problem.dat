40|$|In this thesis, I {{address the}} problem of {{tracking}} multiple identical mice through severe occlusions from video of a side of their cage. A solution to this problem would greatly benefit medical research because of the key role animal testing plays in medical research. As the majority of visual tracking algorithms are intended for tracking people or cars, they are not directly applicable to the <b>mouse</b> tracking <b>problem.</b> Mice are extremely deformable, unconstrained three-dimensional objects. They have few trackable features, and their motion is extremely erratic. In addition, the mice are visually indistinguishable. Thus, to keep track of identities one must track the mice through sometimes complete occlusions. Furthermore, because of the constraints of the application, we had little control over the content of the video sequence. Thus, the bedding of the cage was hard to distinguish from the mice, and the mice were also occluded by scratches {{on the front of the}} cage. In this thesis, I break up the tracking problem into parts: defining a state representation for the mice, defining an appearance model, defining a motion model, and inferring statistics of the positions of the mice for a novel video sequence given the defined model. Because of the difficulty and uniqueness of the <b>mouse</b> tracking <b>problem,</b> it was necessary to understand, modify, combine, and invent state-of-the-art approaches to each of these parts of the tracking problem.

50|$|The National Institutes of Health {{discusses}} {{some important}} {{limitations of this}} technique.While knockout mouse technology represents a valuable research tool, some important limitations exist. About 15 percent of gene knockouts are developmentally lethal, {{which means that the}} genetically altered embryos cannot grow into adult <b>mice.</b> This <b>problem</b> is often overcome through the use of conditional mutations. The lack of adult mice limits studies to embryonic development and often makes it more difficult to determine a gene's function in relation to human health. In some instances, the gene may serve a different function in adults than in developing embryos.Knocking out a gene also may fail to produce an observable change in a mouse or may even produce different characteristics from those observed in humans in which the same gene is inactivated. For example, mutations in the p53 gene are associated with more than half of human cancers and often lead to tumours in a particular set of tissues. However, when the p53 gene is knocked out in mice, the animals develop tumours in a different array of tissues.|$|R

Below certain physical workspace dimensions such indexing methods become cumbersome to the operator and therefore different control paradigms are required. This paper presents a new approach referred to as Workspace Drift Control which progressively relocates the physical workspace of the device mapped inside the virtual environment towards the area of interest of the operator without disturbing his or her perception of the environment.

40|$|The {{mismatch}} repair protein, MSH 3, together with MSH 2, forms the MutSbeta heterodimer which recognizes and repairs base pair mismatches and larger insertion/deletion loops in DNA. Lack of specific antibodies against mouse MSH 3 has hampered studies of its expression and localization. Mouse MSH 3 is not immunogenic in normal <b>mice.</b> This <b>problem</b> {{was overcome by}} immunizing msh 3 -knockout mice and generating a panel of ten monoclonal antibodies, two of which localize MSH 3 specifically in cultured mouse cells and bind to an epitope containing amino-acids 33 - 37.

The mouse MSH 3 -specific antibodies show that MSH 3 is a nuclear protein with a finely-granular nucleoplasmic distribution, largely absent from areas of condensed heterochromatin. Specificity of the localization was demonstrated by absence of immunostaining in a cell line from the msh 3 -knockout mouse.

40|$|The {{increased}} {{prevalence of}} multidrug-resistant bacterial pathogens motivated us {{to attempt to}} enhance the therapeutic efficacy of bacteriophages. The therapeutic application of phages as antibacterial agents was impeded by several factors: (i) the failure to recognize the relatively narrow host range of phages; (ii) the presence of toxins in crude phage lysates; and (iii) a lack of appreciation for the capacity of mammalian host defense systems, particularly the organs of the reticuloendothelial system, to remove phage particles from the circulatory system. In our studies involving bacteremic <b>mice,</b> the <b>problem</b> of the narrow host range of phage was dealt with by using selected bacterial strains and virulent phage specific for them. Toxin levels were diminished by purifying phage preparations. To reduce phage elimination by the host defense system, we developed a serial-passage technique in mice to select for phage mutants able {{to remain in the}} circulatory system for longer periods of time. By this approach we isolated long-circulating mutants of Escherichia coli phage lambda and of Salmonella typhimurium phage P 22. We demonstrated that the long-circulating lambda mutants also have greater capability as antibacterial agents than the corresponding parental strain in animals infected with lethal doses of bacteria. Comparison of the parental and mutant lambda capsid proteins revealed that the relevant mutation altered the major phage head protein E. The use of toxin-free, bacteria-specific phage strains, combined with the serial-passage technique, may provide insights for developing phage into therapeutically effective antibacterial agents...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{ability to}} {{contribute}} to the germ line is the most important experimental feature of embryonic stem (ES) cells. Using ES cells, it is possible to introduce targeted muta-tions into any gene and to derive the correspond-ing mutant <b>mice.</b> A common <b>problem</b> with this technology is that the ES cells often lack or have only a low efficiency of germ line transmission. To address this issue, we examined the relationship between the growth rate and karyotype of ES cells, and their ability {{to contribute to}} the germ line. We found that chromosomal abnormalities occurred rather frequently in ES cells. Cells hav-ing an abnormal number of chromosomes, in particular trisomy 8,were found in three indepen-dently derived ES cell lines, and this abnormality conferred a selective growth advantage on these cells. Selection of abnormal cells led to depletion and eventual loss of normal ES cells during con-secutive passages. In comparison with parental ES cells, ES cells with trisomy 8 contributed rarely to the germ line. This realization allowed us to select, based uponES cell clonemorphology, those clones with the highest probability of con-tributing to the germ line. This insight is of practical value for any given gene targeting ex-periment as it permits optimization of the rate of success without having to rely on more elaborate tests such as karyotyping individual clones prior to blastocyst injection.

40|$|The sialic acids N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu 5 Ac) and N- glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu 5 Gc) are {{commonly}} found in the glycolipids and glycoproteins that cover all vertebrate cell surfaces. The brain, which has a higher concentration of sialic acids than any other tissue, exhibits some interesting features of sialic acid biology with evolutionary implications. In the brain of all vertebrate species tested to date, Neu 5 Ac is present at high quantities, whereas Neu 5 Gc is very low or even absent. This conserved exclusion suggests a selective pressure against Neu 5 Gc expression in the vertebrate brain. We have hypothesized that the mechanism for this pressure may be that Neu 5 Gc presence inhibits the appropriate enzymatic degradation of polysialic acid (polySia), a polymer of alpha 2 - 8 linked sialic acid. PolySia is primarily found in brain tissue, and has been implicated in {{a wide array of}} important developmental processes including migration, neurite outgrowth, plasticity, and repair. In Chapter 3, we test the viability of this hypothesis in vitro. We demonstrate that Neu 5 Gc present in polySia does in fact exhibit a relative resistance to degradation by vertebrate and bacterial sialidases. To determine whether this process is meaningful in vivo, and to further understand the presumed detrimental effects of Neu 5 Gc on the vertebrate brain, we have developed transgenic mouse models that overexpress Neu 5 Gc in brain tissue. In Chapter 4, we describe these ongoing efforts. Studies in the near future will determine whether these <b>mice</b> exhibit <b>problems</b> with polySia degradation, and comprehensively characterize their behavioral and anatomical phenotypes. Lastly, in Chapter 5, we explore the potential role of polySia in human brain evolution. We focus on the effects of a single human-specific mutation in one of the biosynthetic enzymes of polySia, ST 8 Sia-II. Preliminary work suggests that this mutation decreases the stability of the enzyme while increasing the length of its synthesized polySia product. These effects may have implications for the regulation of polySia, and its associated processes, in the human brain. Together, the work discussed here examines potential roles that sialic acid metabolism may have played in mammalian brain evolutio...|$|R

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references (leaves 20 - 21). Tottering mice have a mutation in the calcium channel protein, alpha- 1 A, which decreases calcium entry into neurons through P- and Q-type high-voltage activated calcium ion channels. Because calcium is an important signaling molecule for learning and memory, these mice are appropriate models to study disorders concerning learning and memory. Homozygous tottering (tg/tg) mice exhibit three specific neurological disorders: absence epilepsy, ataxia and paroxysmal dyskinesia. Calcium ions mainly enter neurons through calcium channels that are multisubunit complexes composed of a pore-forming alpha- 1 protein subunit and several regulatory subunits. Channels containing alpha- 1 A subunits (P- and Q-type calcium channels) are highly expressed in the cerebellum, hippocampus, olfactory bulb, cerebral cortex, and thalamus. Since the alpha- 1 A subunit is found in the hippocampus, and the hippocampus is critical in spatial learning, we postulated that there is a decrease in spatial learning and memory in tottering mice because of the defects in the alpha- 1 A subunit that they express. However, no investigation of spatial learning has been done on tottering <b>mice.</b> One <b>problem</b> that needed to be considered is that recurring seizures can interfere with learning and daily tasks. Mice in general swim very well. Swimming seems to eliminate the occurrence of absence seizures and the paroxysmal dyskinesia in tottering mice while the mice are swimming. Therefore, using a swimming maze emphasized potential learning deficits and not physical impairments of tottering mice. We compared male, wildtype (+/+; control) and homozygous tottering mice (tg/tg) using the Morris water maze as a spatial learning and memory test. After training, we counted the number of direct swims (DS) toward the region where the platform was located (NE quadrant) in one category, and noted random swims (RS) as well. The results showed 62. 5 % +/+ and 30. 77 % tg/tg mice fit the DS/NE category. With this evidence, the low percentage of tg/tg mice in the DS/NE category supports our hypothesis that these calcium channel-deficient mice have reduced spatial learning and memory...|$|R
