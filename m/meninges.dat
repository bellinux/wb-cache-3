5|$|A {{sample of}} CSF {{can be taken}} via lumbar puncture. This can reveal the {{intracranial}} pressure, as well as indicate diseases including infections of the brain or its surrounding <b>meninges.</b> Although noted by Hippocrates, {{it was only in}} the eighteenth century that Emanuel Swedenborg is credited with its rediscovery, and as late as 1914 that Harvey W. Cushing demonstrated CSF was secreted by the choroid plexus.|$|E
5|$|Chondrostean fish (sturgeons, paddlefish, and bichirs) {{possess a}} major {{site for the}} {{production}} of granulocytes within a mass that is associated with the <b>meninges</b> (membranes surrounding the central nervous system.) Their heart is frequently covered with tissue that contains lymphocytes, reticular cells and a small number of macrophages. The chondrostean kidney is an important hemopoietic organ; where erythrocytes, granulocytes, lymphocytes and macrophages develop.|$|E
5|$|The brain, {{although}} {{protected by}} the blood-brain barrier, can be affected by infections including viruses, bacteria and fungi. Infection may be of the <b>meninges</b> (meningitis), the brain matter (encephalitis), or within the brain matter (such as a cerebral abscess). Rare prion diseases including Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease and its variant, and kuru may also affect the brain.|$|E
5|$|Cerebrospinal fluid is {{produced}} by the choroid plexus in the ventricles {{of the brain and}} contained by the dura and arachnoid layers of the <b>meninges.</b> The brain floats in CSF, which also transports nutrients to the brain and spinal cord. As holes form in the spinal dura mater, CSF leaks out into the surrounding space. The CSF is then absorbed into the spinal epidural venous plexus or soft tissues around the spine. Due to the sterile conditions of the soft tissues around the spine there is no risk of meningitis.|$|E
5|$|Meningitis is {{an acute}} {{inflammation}} of the protective membranes covering the brain and spinal cord, known collectively as the <b>meninges.</b> The most common symptoms are fever, headache, and neck stiffness. Other symptoms include confusion or altered consciousness, vomiting, and an inability to tolerate light or loud noises. Young children often exhibit only nonspecific symptoms, such as irritability, drowsiness, or poor feeding. If a rash is present, it may indicate a particular cause of meningitis; for instance, meningitis caused by meningococcal bacteria may {{be accompanied by a}} characteristic rash.|$|E
5|$|Pugs {{can suffer}} from necrotizing meningo{{encephalitis}} (NME), {{also known as}} Pug dog encephalitis (PDE), an inflammation {{of the brain and}} <b>meninges.</b> NME also occurs in other small dogs, such as the Yorkshire Terrier, Maltese, and Chihuahua. There is no known cure for NME, which is believed to be an inherited disease. Dogs usually die or have to be put to sleep within a few months of onset, which, in those susceptible to this condition, is typically between six months and seven years of age.|$|E
5|$|The Edwin Smith Papyrus, {{an ancient}} Egyptian medical {{treatise}} {{written in the}} 17th century BC, contains the earliest recorded reference to the brain. The hieroglyph for brain, occurring eight times in this papyrus, describes the symptoms, diagnosis, and prognosis of two traumatic injuries to the head. The papyrus mentions the external surface of the brain, the effects of injury (including seizures and aphasia), the <b>meninges,</b> and cerebrospinal fluid.|$|E
5|$|The cerebrum, brainstem, cerebellum, {{and spinal}} cord {{are covered by}} three {{membranes}} called <b>meninges.</b> The membranes are the tough dura mater; the middle arachnoid mater and the more delicate inner pia mater. Between the arachnoid mater and the pia mater is the subarachnoid space, which contains the cerebrospinal fluid. In the cerebral cortex, close to the basement membrane of the pia mater, is a limiting membrane called the glia limitans; this is the outermost membrane of the cortex.|$|E
5|$|When tumors compress, invade or inflame {{parts of}} the nervous system (such as the brain, spinal cord, nerves, ganglia or plexa), they can cause pain and other symptoms. Though brain tissue {{contains}} no pain sensors, brain tumors can cause pain by pressing on blood vessels or the membrane that encapsulates the brain (the <b>meninges),</b> or indirectly by causing a build-up of fluid (edema) that may compress pain-sensitive tissue.|$|E
5|$|Another {{approach}} to brain {{function is to}} examine the consequences of damage to specific brain areas. Even though it is protected by the skull and <b>meninges,</b> surrounded by cerebrospinal fluid, and isolated from the bloodstream by the blood–brain barrier, the delicate nature of the brain makes it vulnerable to numerous diseases and several types of damage. In humans, the effects of strokes and other types of brain damage have been a key source of information about brain function. Because there is no ability to experimentally control the nature of the damage, however, this information is often difficult to interpret. In animal studies, most commonly involving rats, it is possible to use electrodes or locally injected chemicals to produce precise patterns of damage and then examine the consequences for behavior.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, {{scientists}} reconstructed an endocast (replica) of an Acrocanthosaurus {{cranial cavity}} using computed tomography (CT scanning) {{to analyze the}} spaces within the holotype braincase (OMNH 10146). In life, much of this space would have been filled with the <b>meninges</b> and cerebrospinal fluid, {{in addition to the}} brain itself. However, the general features of the brain and cranial nerves could be determined from the endocast and compared to other theropods for which endocasts have been created. While the brain is similar to many theropods, it is most similar to that of allosauroids. It most resembles the brains of Carcharodontosaurus and Giganotosaurus rather than those of Allosaurus or Sinraptor, providing support for the hypothesis that Acrocanthosaurus was a carcharodontosaurid.|$|E
5|$|Niccolò Massa {{discovered}} in 1536 that the ventricles {{were filled with}} fluid. Archiangelo Piccolomini of Rome {{was the first to}} distinguish between the cerebrum and cerebral cortex. In 1543 Andreas Vesalius published his seven-volume De humani corporis fabrica. The seventh book covered the brain and eye, with detailed images of the ventricles, cranial nerves, pituitary gland, <b>meninges,</b> structures of the eye, the vascular supply to the brain and spinal cord, and an image of the peripheral nerves. Vesalius rejected the common belief that the ventricles were responsible for brain function, arguing that many animals have a similar ventricular system to humans, but no true intelligence.|$|E
5|$|The {{brains of}} {{vertebrates}} {{are made of}} very soft tissue. Living brain tissue is pinkish {{on the outside and}} mostly white on the inside, with subtle variations in color. Vertebrate brains are surrounded by a system of connective tissue membranes called <b>meninges</b> that separate the skull from the brain. Blood vessels enter the central nervous system through holes in the meningeal layers. The cells in the blood vessel walls are joined tightly to one another, forming the blood–brain barrier, which blocks the passage of many toxins and pathogens (though at the same time blocking antibodies and some drugs, thereby presenting special challenges in treatment of diseases of the brain).|$|E
5|$|Known as viremia, the {{presence}} of a virus in the bloodstream enables it to be widely distributed throughout the body. Poliovirus can survive and multiply within the blood and lymphatics for long periods of time, sometimes as long as 17 weeks. In a small percentage of cases, it can spread and replicate in other sites, such as brown fat, the reticuloendothelial tissues, and muscle. This sustained replication causes a major viremia, and leads to the development of minor influenza-like symptoms. Rarely, this may progress and the virus may invade the central nervous system, provoking a local inflammatory response. In most cases, this causes a self-limiting inflammation of the <b>meninges,</b> the layers of tissue surrounding the brain, which is known as nonparalytic aseptic meningitis. Penetration of the CNS provides no known benefit to the virus, and is quite possibly an incidental deviation of a normal gastrointestinal infection. The mechanisms by which poliovirus spreads to the CNS are poorly understood, but it appears to be primarily a chance event—largely independent of the age, gender, or socioeconomic position of the individual.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} cancers {{in the brain}} come from {{elsewhere}} in the body – most commonly the lung, breast and skin. Cancers of brain tissue can also occur, and originate from any tissue {{in and around the}} brain. Meningioma, cancer of the <b>meninges</b> around the brain, is more common than cancers of brain tissue. Cancers within the brain may cause symptoms related to their size or position, with symptoms including headache and nausea, or the gradual development of focal symptoms such as gradual difficulty seeing, swallowing, talking, or as a change of mood. Cancers are in general investigated through the use of CT scans and MRI scans. A variety of other tests including blood tests and lumbar puncture may be used to investigate for the cause of the cancer and evaluate the type and stage of the cancer. The corticosteroid dexamethasone is often given to decrease the swelling of brain tissue around a tumour. Surgery may be considered, however given the complex nature of many tumours or based on tumour stage or type, radiotherapy or chemotherapy may be considered more suitable.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fifth}} century BC, Alcmaeon of Croton in Magna Grecia, first {{considered}} the brain to be {{the seat of the}} mind. Also in {{the fifth century}} BC in Athens, Hippocrates believed the brain to be the seat of intelligence. Aristotle, in his biology initially believed the heart to be the seat of intelligence, and saw the brain as a cooling mechanism for the blood. He reasoned that humans are more rational than the beasts because, among other reasons, they have a larger brain to cool their hot-bloodedness. Aristotle did describe the <b>meninges</b> and distinguished between the cerebrum and cerebellum. Herophilus of Chalcedon in the fourth and third centuries BC distinguished the cerebrum and the cerebellum, and provided the first clear description of the ventricles; and with Erasistratus of Ceos experimented on living brains. Their works are now mostly lost, and we know about their achievements due mostly to secondary sources. Some of their discoveries had to be re-discovered a millennium after their deaths. Anatomist physician Galen in the second century AD, {{during the time of the}} Roman Empire, dissected the brains of sheep, monkeys, dogs, and pigs. He concluded that, as the cerebellum was denser than the brain, it must control the muscles, while as the cerebrum was soft, it must be where the senses were processed. Galen further theorized that the brain functioned by movement of animal spirits through the ventricles.|$|E
25|$|Lymphoma {{can also}} {{spread to the}} central nervous system, often around the brain in the <b>meninges,</b> known as lymphomatous {{meningitis}} (LM).|$|E
25|$|In some {{subdural}} bleeds, the arachnoid {{layer of}} the <b>meninges</b> is torn, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood both expand in the intracranial space, increasing pressure.|$|E
25|$|If the <b>meninges</b> are affected, CSF {{will show}} {{abnormally}} low glucose levels in CSF, an increased level of protein in the CSF, and lymphocytic pleocytosis. Rarely, CSF eosinophilia is present.|$|E
25|$|Tuberculosis {{may affect}} {{the central nervous system}} (<b>meninges,</b> brain or spinal cord) in which case it is called TB meningitis, TB cerebritis, and TB {{myelitis}} respectively; the standard treatment is 12 months of drugs (2HREZ/10HR) and steroid are mandatory.|$|E
25|$|Brain tissue itself {{contains}} no nociceptors; brain tumors cause pain by pressing on blood vessels or the membrane that encapsulates the brain (the <b>meninges),</b> or indirectly by causing a build-up of fluid (edema) that may compress pain-sensitive tissue.|$|E
25|$|The ophthalmic, maxillary and mandibular {{branches}} {{leave the}} skull through three separate foramina: the superior orbital fissure, the foramen rotundum and the foramen ovale, respectively. The ophthalmic nerve (V1) carries sensory {{information from the}} scalp and forehead, the upper eyelid, the conjunctiva and cornea of the eye, the nose (including {{the tip of the}} nose, except alae nasi), the nasal mucosa, the frontal sinuses and parts of the <b>meninges</b> (the dura and blood vessels). The maxillary nerve (V2) carries sensory information from the lower eyelid and cheek, the nares and upper lip, the upper teeth and gums, the nasal mucosa, the palate and roof of the pharynx, the maxillary, ethmoid and sphenoid sinuses and parts of the <b>meninges.</b> The mandibular nerve (V3) carries sensory information from the lower lip, the lower teeth and gums, the chin and jaw (except the angle of the jaw, which is supplied by C2-C3), parts of the external ear and parts of the <b>meninges.</b> The mandibular nerve carries touch-position and pain-temperature sensations from the mouth. Although it does not carry taste sensation (the chorda tympani is responsible for taste), one of its branches—the lingual nerve—carries sensation from the tongue.|$|E
25|$|About 3 per 100,000 people {{develop the}} disease a year. It most often begins around 64 {{years of age}} and occurs more {{commonly}} in males than females. It is the second most common central nervous system cancer after meningiomas, which arise from the <b>meninges.</b>|$|E
25|$|Subarachnoid hemorrhage, {{which is}} {{basically}} bleeding that occurs outside of the brain tissue but still within the skull, and precisely between the arachnoid mater and pia mater (the delicate innermost layer of the three layers of the <b>meninges</b> that surround the brain).|$|E
25|$|In 1970, Upledger {{observed}} during a surgical procedure {{on the neck}} {{what he described as}} a slow pulsating movement within the spinal <b>meninges.</b> He attempted to hold the membrane still and found that he could not due to the strength of the action behind the movement.|$|E
25|$|A {{minority}} {{of individuals with}} hand, {{foot and mouth disease}} may require hospital admission due to complications such as inflammation of the brain, inflammation of the <b>meninges,</b> or acute flaccid paralysis. Non-neurologic complications such as inflammation of the heart, fluid in the lungs, or bleeding into the lungs may also occur.|$|E
25|$|The {{brain and}} spinal cord {{are covered by}} the <b>meninges,</b> the three {{protective}} membranes of the tough dura mater, the arachnoid mater and the pia mater. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) within the skull and spine provides further protection and also buoyancy, and {{is found in the}} subarachnoid space between the pia mater and the arachnoid mater.|$|E
25|$|Spina bifida is a {{congenital}} {{disorder in}} which there is a defective closure of the vertebral arch. Sometimes the spinal <b>meninges</b> and also the spinal cord can protrude through this, and this is called Spina bifida cystica. Where the condition does not involve this protrusion it is known as Spina bifida occulta. Sometimes all of the vertebral arches may remain incomplete.|$|E
25|$|At {{least five}} {{characteristics}} {{are present in}} CNS tissues of MS patients: Inflammation beyond classical white matter lesions, intrathecal Ig production with oligoclonal bands, an environment fostering immune cell persistence, Follicle-like aggregates in the <b>meninges</b> and a disruption of the blood–brain barrier also outside of active lesions. The scars that give the name to the condition are produced by the astrocyte cells healing old lesions.|$|E
25|$|Meningioma, {{also known}} as meningeal tumor, is {{typically}} a slow-growing tumor that forms from the <b>meninges,</b> the membranous layers surrounding the brain and spinal cord. Symptoms depend on the location and occur {{as a result of}} the tumor pressing on nearby tissue. Many cases never produce symptoms. Occasionally seizures, dementia, trouble talking, vision problems, one sided weakness, or loss of bladder control may occur.|$|E
25|$|The {{internal}} {{carotid artery}} is a major paired artery, {{one on each side}} of the head and neck, in human anatomy. They arise from the common carotid arteries where these bifurcate into the internal and external carotid arteries at cervical vertebral level 3 or 4; the {{internal carotid artery}} supplies the brain, while the external carotid nourishes other portions of the head, such as face, scalp, skull, and <b>meninges.</b>|$|E
25|$|All sensory {{information}} from the face, both touch-position and pain-temperature, {{is sent to the}} trigeminal nucleus. In classical anatomy most {{sensory information}} from the face is carried by the fifth nerve, but sensation from parts of the mouth, parts of the ear and parts of the <b>meninges</b> is carried by general somatic afferent fibers in cranial nerves VII (the facial nerve), IX (the glossopharyngeal nerve) and X (the vagus nerve).|$|E
25|$|The brain {{itself is}} not {{sensitive}} to pain, because it lacks pain receptors. However, several areas {{of the head and}} neck do have pain receptors and can thus sense pain. These include the extracranial arteries, middle meningeal artery, large veins, venous sinuses, cranial and spinal nerves, head and neck muscles, the <b>meninges,</b> falx cerebri, parts of the brainstem, eyes, ears, teeth and lining of the mouth. Pial arteries, rather than pial veins are responsible for pain production.|$|E
25|$|In 2009, Harper was {{diagnosed}} with lung cancer. She announced on March 6, 2013, that tests from a January hospital stay revealed she has leptomeningeal carcinomatosis, a rare condition in which cancer cells spread into the <b>meninges,</b> the membranes surrounding the brain. She said her doctors had given her as little as three months' life expectancy. Although the disease {{was reported to be}} incurable, her doctors said they were treating her with chemotherapy in an effort to slow its progress. In April 2014, Harper said she was responding well to the treatment. On July 30, 2015, Harper was hospitalized in Maine after falling unconscious, and taken via medevac to a larger hospital for further treatment. She was later discharged.|$|E
25|$|Servetus was {{the first}} European to {{describe}} the function of pulmonary circulation, although his achievement was not widely recognized at the time, for a few reasons. One was that the description appeared in a theological treatise, Christianismi Restitutio, not in a book on medicine. However, the sections in which he refers to anatomy and medicines demonstrate an amazing understanding {{of the body and}} treatments. Most copies of the book were burned shortly after its publication in 1553 because of persecution of Servetus by religious authorities. Three copies survived, but these remained hidden for decades. In passage V, Servetus recounts his discovery that the blood of the pulmonary circulation flows from the heart to the lungs (rather than air in the lungs flowing to the heart as had been thought). His discovery was based on the colour of the blood, the size and location of the different ventricles, {{and the fact that the}} pulmonary vein was extremely large, which suggested that it performed intensive and transcendent exchange. However, Servetus does not only deal with cardiology. In the same passage, from page 169 to 178, he also refers to the brain, the cerebellum, the <b>meninges,</b> the nerves, the eye, the tympanum, the rete mirabile, etc., demonstrating a great knowledge of anatomy. In some other sections of this work he also talks of medical products.|$|E
500|$|A {{spontaneous}} {{cerebrospinal fluid}} leak (SCSFL) {{is a medical}} condition in which the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) held {{in and around the}} human brain and spinal cord leaks out of the surrounding protective [...] dural sac, for no apparent reason. The dura, a tough, inflexible tissue, is the outermost of the three layers of the <b>meninges,</b> the system of membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord.|$|E
