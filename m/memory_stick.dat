25|$|On June 15, 2005, hackers {{disassembled}} {{the code}} of the PSP and distributed it online.

Sony responded to this by repeatedly upgrading the software.Homebrew were custom made PSP applications consisting of different types of features including calculator, remote, file manager, android simulator etc. Over time people were able to unlock the firmware and allow users to run more custom content and more protected software. One of the ways hackers were able to run protected software on the PSP was through the creation of ISO loaders which could load copies of UMD games from the <b>memory</b> <b>stick.</b> Custom firmware is also commonly seen in the PSP systems; the most famous ones include the M33 Custom Firmware, Minimum Edition (ME/LME) CFW and the PRO CFWl.|$|E

A supplementary app for the Nintendo 3DS, with functions connected to both the 3DS functions in in-game messaging, released for free on August 22. Following the initial release, Square Enix doubled the amount of active servers to cope with crowding issues, while they worked on creating a larger permanent server increase. Support for the Wii version ended in 2017.|$|E

500|$|Released in October , the PSP Go is {{the biggest}} {{redesign}} of the PlayStation Portable to date. Unlike previous PSP models, the PSP Go does not feature a UMD drive but instead has 16GB of internal flash memory to store games, videos and other media. This can be extended by up to 32GB {{with the use of}} a <b>Memory</b> <b>Stick</b> Micro (M2) flash card. Also unlike previous PSP models, the PSP Go's rechargeable battery is not removable or replaceable by the user. The unit is 43% lighter and 56% smaller than the original PSP-1000, and 16% lighter and 35% smaller than the PSP-3000. It has a 3.8" [...] 480×272 LCD (compared to the larger 4.3" [...] 480×272 pixel LCD on previous PSP models). The screen slides up to reveal the main controls. The overall shape and sliding mechanism are similar to that of Sony's mylo COM-2 internet device. The PSP Go is being produced and sold concurrently with its predecessor the PSP-3000 although it will not replace it. All games on the PSP Go must be purchased and downloaded from the PlayStation Store as the handheld is not compatible with the original PSP's physical media, the Universal Media Disc. The handheld also features connectivity with the PlayStation 3's controllers the Sixaxis and DualShock 3 via Bluetooth connection.|$|E

40|$|The LHCb Event Filter Farm {{consists}} {{of more than}} 1500 server nodes with a total amount of roughly 65 TB operating memory. The memory is crucial {{for the success of}} the LHCb experiment, since the proton-proton collisions are temporarily stored on these memory modules. Unfortunately, the aging nodes of the server farm occasionally suffer losses of their memory modules. The lower the available memory, the lower performance we can get out of it. Inducing the users or administrators to pay attention to this matter is inefficient. One needs to upgrade it to an acceptable way. The aim of this project was to develop a software to monitor a set of test machines. The software stores the data of the <b>memory</b> <b>sticks</b> in advance in a database which will be used for future reference. Then it checks the <b>memory</b> <b>sticks</b> at a future time instant to find any failures. In the case of any such losses the software looks up in the database to find out which <b>memory</b> <b>sticks</b> have lost and displays all information of those sticks in a log file. The software is scalable and tested for a couple of test machines...|$|R
