40|$|The need {{to drive}} {{communities}} into being self-reliant requires strategies that can enable communities {{to take control}} of their own need. This requires effective interaction between institutions that are involved in promoting such strategies. This thesis begins by examining the interaction between the multiple stakeholders involved in housing development projects in <b>marginalised</b> <b>communities</b> in Nigeria. However, there are factors that impede on effective community development in housing in <b>marginalised</b> <b>communities</b> in Nigeria. This research identified three main factors namely the 'leadership and strategic direction' of the community housing projects, 'community structure' and 'resources and capabilities' within the communities that is key to determining effective longer term sustainable capability development of housing within <b>marginalised</b> <b>communities.</b> The aim of this research is to recommend strategies to improve effective and meaningful engagement between the multiple stakeholders in housing development projects in building self-sustaining capacity in <b>marginalised</b> <b>communities</b> in Nigeria. A conceptual framework was developed from literature review from relevant literature. The case studies investigate the level of stakeholders' interaction in the project cycle at the conceptualisation and feasibility phase, the physical manifestation phase and the maintenance phase of community housing projects. An in-depth multiple case study approach was adopted to examine and investigate the research problem. Case study approach of development housing projects in two <b>marginalised</b> <b>communities</b> in Nigeria was conducted for this research. Data analysis was done through the use of content analysis and influence / relationship maps. The empirical testing of the propositions illustrated that {{there is a lack of}} effective and efficient interaction among the stakeholders involved in the housing project. The results revealed that there is a lack of community participation and that participation of the multiple stakeholders' decreases as the project cycle progresses from the conceptualisation and feasibility phase of the project cycle to the maintenance phase of the project cycle. The study further ensures that the initial framework is robust by linking the barriers and enablers of capacity building to show how these influence the project outcome. The research also highlighted recommendations which include the involvement of the community members in all the stages of the project cycle and particular attention should be given to the implications of leadership fragmentation within the different stakeholders involved in the housing development projects. These recommendations will help the leadership of DNGOs in housing projects to effectively engage with <b>marginalised</b> <b>communities.</b> The research contributed to knowledge by developing a dynamic framework as well as providing recommendations that will be used within community housing projects in <b>marginalised</b> <b>communities</b> in Nigeria.

40|$|This {{research}} {{examines the}} relationship between community participation in public space decisions and the wellbeing of <b>marginalised</b> <b>communities.</b> A cross-disciplinary literature review and four New Zealand case studies investigate if community participation in public space design enhances the wellbeing of <b>marginalised</b> <b>communities,</b> and if so, how this is best done. The findings from the literature review, case study interviews and surveys show strong evidence that participation in place-making does enhance the wellbeing of <b>marginalised</b> <b>communities</b> in New Zealand. Furthermore, four aspects of community wellbeing stand out as being most significantly enhanced by participatory processes. These are an increased empowerment, enhanced vision-making and advocacy capabilities, an increased collective action and an enhanced sense of pride, belonging and connectedness to community. The findings also identify a comprehensive range of processes that are critical to effective participatory projects. The range includes community-led support initiatives, community involvement in social analysis, celebration events, engagement processes for visioning and decision-making, work-group collaboration, involvement in implementing, partnerships with stakeholders and post-project involvements. Two actions that are critical to gaining authentic engagement in these processes is participant involvement in the initial preparation processes and {{the appointment of a}} community advocate to plan and facilitate the participatory process. This research is distinguished by identifying effective participatory processes that are typically under-utilised or not considered in conventional public consultation work. Furthermore, it provides strong evidence that these participatory processes enhance the wellbeing of <b>marginalised</b> <b>communities...</b>|$|R

40|$|Skills {{development}} {{remains on}} the international development agenda but fails to get adequate attention. Based on prolonged fieldwork with a particularly <b>marginalised</b> <b>community</b> of {{children and young adults}} in the northern Nigerian state of Kano, this article shows how in contexts of extreme poverty the demand for skills training can supersede that for basic education. Further, by drawing on results of a six-month-long skills-training intervention, the article documents the scope for increased experimentation in the delivery of low-cost community-based skills-training programmes and identifies factors that influence programme completion. It also demonstrates that participation in skills-training programmes can dramatically increase entrepreneurial aspirations among marginalised youth; but that without access to credit most fail to pursue their aspirations. Below certain poverty thresholds, the dire resource constraints make change in aspirations an unreliable predictor of possible improvement in future outcomes...|$|E

The kit contains a video camera, disposable camera and a set of task cards to prompt them to capture certain experiences. We applied this method with 13 participants from a community care centre and found the self-reported experiences to reveal both useful and insightful perspectives around the lives of women in crisis situations. Through this methodology the women shared different aspects of their lives, challenged stereotypes, and were empowered to share their stories and experiences. This methodology is useful in sensitive settings as it includes participants in the design process, and supports their privacy by enabling agency. It also allows for digital inclusion in terms of interacting with and using the camera technology...|$|E

40|$|The article {{examines}} the work of women’s non-governmental organisations (NGOs) on West Bank radio as they represent women, a <b>marginalised</b> <b>community,</b> within a patriarchal, traditional and religious society. It also examines the commercial and societal difficulties faced by radio stations in their interactions with NGOs. Using a quantitative and qualitative approach, it analyses data from six commercial, rather than state-owned or community, radio stations in four West Bank cities and discusses the frustrations of both parties as they work together. Contributing to the limited literature {{on the role of}} radio in the West Bank, the article also draws on interviews with representatives from the chosen stations and the NGOs that broadcast material on radio stations. The findings suggest that, for the NGOs and in contrast to other media, radio plays an important, albeit currently limited, role as amplifiers for their campaigns. Yet the radio stations do not contribute substantively, if at all, to encouraging NGO community-building activities and, in fact, restrict themselves to a commercial-based association...|$|E
40|$|There are {{limitations}} to traditional ethical approaches and procedures when engaged in assistive technology (AT) research for Deaf {{people in a}} developing region. Non-traditional issues arise {{as a consequence of}} employing action research, including but not limited to how informed consent is construed and obtained; empowerment of participants to become involved in co-design; awareness of unfamiliar cultural issues of participants (as opposed to subjects); and accommodating community-centred, as opposed to person-centred, nuances. This chapter describes AT research with an entity called Deaf Community of Cape Town (DCCT), a disabled people’s organisation (DPO) that works on behalf of a <b>marginalised</b> <b>community</b> of under-educated, under-employed and semi-literate Deaf people across metropolitan Cape Town.
