Though {{there were}} plans for mass production and several field trials with different bomblet concepts, the end conclusion {{was that it}} was no more economical than using phosgene. This conclusion was based on comparison of the final weapons, rather than ricin's toxicity (LCt50 ~40mg·min/m3). Ricin was given the <b>military</b> <b>symbol</b> W or later WA. Interest in it continued for a short period after World War II, but soon subsided when the U.S. Army Chemical Corps began a program to weaponize sarin.|$|E
25|$|C. immitis was {{considered}} by the United States during the 1950s and 1960s as a potential biological weapon. The strain selected for investigation was designated with the <b>military</b> <b>symbol</b> OC, and initial expectations were for its deployment as a human incapacitant. Medical research suggested that OC might have had some lethal effects on the populace, and C. immitis started to be classified by the authorities {{as a threat to}} public health. However, C. immitis was never weaponized, and most of the military research in the mid-1960s was concentrated on developing a human vaccine. Currently, it is not on the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' (HHS) or Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's list of select agents and toxins.|$|E

5000|$|Military symbols evolved {{out of the}} First World War {{from the}} British in part for secrecy, and to simplify {{reference}} to chemicals by {{something other than a}} chemical name. These symbols were sometimes applied as marking on weapons to indicate the agent contents. Military symbols constantly changed and had transitory definitions. For example, mustard gas was assigned the <b>military</b> <b>symbol</b> originally HS for [...] "Hun Stuff". Later in the First World War the S in HS signified mustard gas that had about 25% solvent added to it. This was only in England, as HS was adopted as the <b>military</b> <b>symbol</b> by the United States - signifying crude mustard. In the Second World War the purity of mustard gas was improved through distillation, and this purified chemical warfare agent was designated HD. When it was mixed with a thickener (Agent VV), it was given the symbol HV. Today mustard gas is indicated by the single capital letter H, but HD is still in common use.|$|E

Field trials with lewisite during World War II demonstrated that casualty concentrations were not achievable under high humidity due to its rate of hydrolysis and its characteristic odor and lacrymation forced troops to don masks and avoid contaminated areas. The United States produced about 20,000 tons of lewisite, keeping it on hand primarily as an antifreeze for mustard gas or to penetrate protective clothing in special situations.|$|E

Military symbols applied to the CB agent fill, and not to the entire weapon. A chemical or biological weapon designation would be, for example, [...] "Aero-14/B", which could be filled with GB, VX, TGB, or with a biological modification kit - OU, NU, UL, etc. A CB weapon is an integrated device of (1) agent, (2) dissemination means, and (3) delivery system.|$|E
