40|$|We present {{detailed}} {{estimates of}} ``type-I'' <b>migration</b> <b>rates</b> for low-mass proto-planets embedded in steady-state T-Tauri alpha-disks, based on Lindblad torque calculations ignoring {{feedback on the}} disk. Differences in <b>migration</b> <b>rates</b> for several plausible background disk models are explored and we contrast results obtained using the standard two dimensional formalism of spiral density wave theory with those obtained from a simple treatment of three-dimensional effects. Opacity transitions in the disk result in sudden radial variations of the <b>migration</b> <b>rates.</b> Regions with minimal <b>migration</b> <b>rates</b> may be preferred sites of gravitational interactions between proto-planets. Three-dimensional torques are significantly weaker than two-dimensional ones and they {{are sensitive to the}} surface density profile of the background disk. We find that migration times in excess of runaway envelope accretion times or T-Tauri disk lifetimes are possible for Earth-mass proto-planets in some background disk models, even at sub-AU distances. We conclude that an understanding of the background disk structure and ``viscosity'', as well as a proper treatment of three-dimensional effects in torque calculations, are necessary to obtain reliable estimates of ``type-I'' <b>migration</b> <b>rates...</b>|$|R

40|$|We {{calculate}} radial <b>migration</b> <b>rates</b> of protoplanets in laminar minimum mass solar nebula discs using three-dimensional self-gravitating radiation hydrodynamical (RHD) models. The protoplanets {{are free}} to migrate, whereupon their <b>migration</b> <b>rates</b> are measured. For low mass protoplanets (10 - 50 M_⊕) we find increases in the migration timescales of up to {{an order of magnitude}} between locally-isothermal and RHD models. In the high-mass regime the <b>migration</b> <b>rates</b> are changed very little. These results are arrived at by calculating <b>migration</b> <b>rates</b> in locally-isothermal models, before sequentially introducing self-gravity, and radiative transfer, allowing us to isolate the effects of the additional physics. We find that using a locally-isothermal equation of state, without self-gravity, we reproduce the <b>migration</b> <b>rates</b> obtained by previous analytic and numerical models. We explore the impact of different protoplanet models, and changes to their assumed radii, upon migration. The introduction of self-gravity gives a slight reduction of the <b>migration</b> <b>rates,</b> whilst the inertial mass problem, which has been proposed for high mass protoplanets with circumplanetary discs, is reproduced. Upon introducing radiative transfer to models of low mass protoplanets (≈ 10 M_⊕), modelled as small radius accreting point masses, we find outward <b>migration</b> with a <b>rate</b> of approximately twice the analytic inward rate. However, when modelling such a protoplanet in a more realistic manner, with a surface which enables the formation of a deep envelope, this outward migration is not seen.

Range shift rates were estimated by means of species distribution modelling (SDM).
