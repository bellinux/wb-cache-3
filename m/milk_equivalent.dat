40|$|From the {{beginning}} of the 1970 s to the mid 1990 s, consumption of meat in developing countries increased by 70 million metric tons (MMT), almost triple the increase in developed countries, and consumption of milk by 105 MMT of liquid <b>milk</b> <b>equivalents</b> (LME), more than twice the increase that occurred in developed countries. The market value of that increase in meat and milk consumption totaled approximately $ 155 billion (1990 US$), more than twice the market value of increased cereals consumption under the better-known “Green Revolution ” in wheat, rice and maize. The population growth, urbanization, and income growth that fueled the increase in meat and milk consumption are expected to continue well into the new millennium, creating a veritable Livestock Revolution. As these events unfold, many people's diets will change, some for the better, but others for the worse, especially if food contamination is not controlled.

Locally produced fresh milk, factory reconstituted milk and directly imported readily usable milk were among the most frequently consumed dairy products. Financial difficulty was cited as the most important reason for the low level and irregularity of consumption of dairy products by the poor households. Consumers considered convenience in terms of proximity, favorable terms of purchase and product quality when acquiring dairy products.

40|$|The {{national}} {{strategies for}} the irrigated intensive agricultural system in developing countries should focus upon Producing less expensive milk from dairy buffaloes that, efficiently, utilize the limited expensive produced feed resources. Therefore, planning for the least cost feeds combination is the most recommended approach to keep buffalo milk price at a competitive level and being low enough to make milk available for the major proportion of the low-income households, particularly “Vulnerable Groups”. Estimation of the least cost feed ration combination of the limited expensive feed resources were conducted from a recent farm survey of the dairy buffalo performances and the feed use pattern in Egypt. The estimated average production elasticity of fodder, concentrate feeds mix and straw, implies that their shares in generated buffalo milk income are 41. 7 %, 35 %, and 23. 3 %, respectively [...] The response of the human labor was of negative direction and statistically insignificant. This means that the labor used per dairy buffalo was beyond the economic level, that reflects the excess farm-family labor involved in such activity, because they have almost nil opportunity income of off farm work. The other capital inputs have small positive effect on milk production, The average marginal return from milk per onedollar expenditure reached $. 1. 08 for fodder, and $ 1. 04 for concentrated feed mix, i. e. it is feasible to expand the usage of fodder more than concentrates. The wheat straw has shown uneconomic efficiency. Therefore, it is recommended to limit its level in the ration.

40|$|Inter{{national}} {{trade is}} one of the hot topics in dairy circles these days. Look at the record of key dairy issues at the national level last year. First it was humanitarian assistance to the for-mer Soviet Union, under which over $ 100 million worth of U. S. dairy products were shipped to the former Soviet republics last winter. During the spring, U. S. dairy interests successful-ly opposed increased imports of Goya cheese under the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) program and stopped domestic price udercutting by imported Swiss cheese. Summer saw the conclusion of negotiations for a North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which would progressively open up trade in dairy products between the U. S. and Mexico. By last fall, commercial exports of U. S. dairy products under the Dairy Export Incentive Program (DEIP) began to reach levels that attracted widespread attention. Under the DEIP, contracts to commercially export about 2. 65 billion pounds (<b>milk</b> <b>equivalent)</b> of U. S. dairy products were signed during 1992. By winter, an agreement on agriculture reached between the U. S. and the European Community (EC) seemed to pave the way to wrap up the 6 -year-old Uruguay Round multilateral trade negotiations under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). While the GATT negotiations are not moving as fast as was thought late last year, nevertheless an eventual GATT deal would bring further changes to the U. S. dairy industry, both in terms of additional imports as well as additional export opportunities. Involving such things as DEIP, GATT, NAFTA, GSP, GSM, and the EC, this may all appear more like alphabet soup than serious matters U. S. dairy farmers should pay attention to. But international trade has come to the U. S. dairy industry to stay, and it will have an increasing impact on all our bottom lines. In my comments, I want to focus on free trade agreements, such as NAFTA and the Uruguay Round negotiations under GATT. How will they fit into this overall picture of a greater inter-national orientation for the U. S. dairy industry? How will they effect the industry...|$|E

In Trial 2, milk offtake for human use (MOF), calf daily gain (ADG), <b>milk</b> <b>equivalent</b> of growth (MEQ), and total yield, TOT (=MOF+MEQ) were significantly (P< 0. 001) influenced by time and treatment interaction. Polynomial contrasts showed that MOF was only significant at linearity (P< 0. 05), while ADG, MEQ and TOT were significant up to the quadratic component (P< 0. 05). LSM for TOT were 0. 73, 1. 76, 2. 15, 2. 13 and 3. 36 1 /d (S. E= 0. 235). Results suggest that on input ouput basis it may not be profitable to provide full feed greater than 5. 5 kg TDN (approx. 9 kg, DM 20 percent CP) for Bunaji cattle in stall feeding schemes. On the other hand supplementary feeding rate up to 4 kg TDN/d for grazing cattle of average weight of 250 kg and producing about 3 1 /d of milk (5 percent fat) would make economic sense...|$|E
40|$|This report {{assesses the}} cost {{structures}} of businesses {{operating in the}} Australian dairy product manufacturing industry, including costs relative to international competitors. Key points: 	Australian dairy product manufacturers face some cost pressures (such as energy and labour) relative to their competitors, but also some advantages, including highly competitive raw milk costs (the largest single input cost). 	Some cost pressures may warrant government corrective action, but most costs are largely driven by market factors and the commercial decisions of businesses. Manufacturers and farmers will need to continue innovating and improving the efficiency of their operations {{in the face of}} a potential expansion in global supply (for example, once EU milk production quotas are removed in 2015). 	Suggestions that Australian dairy manufacturing should emulate the so-called New Zealand model, with a ‘national champion’, are often based on an overly simplistic comparison of the export performance of the two countries’ dairy industries; tend to gloss over the regulatory arrangements that underpin the New Zealand dairy industry (for example, domestic price regulation); and overemphasise the role of plant scale. 	On-farm investment is crucial to increasing Australia’s raw milk supply (and dairy product manufacturing output). Manufacturers may need to share more of the investment risks in order to increase raw milk production. 	 		Farmgate price incentives to encourage ‘new’ milk, or reduce the seasonal variability of milk supply, are already in play where it is commercially desirable. 	 	 	In 2012 - 13, Australian dairy product manufacturing generated a total industry value added of more than $ 2. 4 billion (roughly 0. 15 per cent of GDP) and employed over 17 500 people. 	About 40 per cent of Australia’s dairy output (in <b>milk</b> <b>equivalent</b> terms) is exported (predominantly as cheese and milk powder), with China and Japan the largest markets. 	 		This level of integration of Australian dairy manufacturers into world markets means that domestic dairy product prices (and farmgate milk prices) are strongly influenced by international markets and prices. 	 	 	Hourly labour costs in the Australian food, beverage and tobacco manufacturing sector in 2012 exceeded those in New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the United States of America (in common currency terms). In addition, Australia’s measured productivity performance in the food, beverage and tobacco manufacturing sector between 2000 and 2011 has been relatively poor. 	Wholesale prices of electricity and natural gas in Australia have risen sharply since 2006. For manufacturers of energy-intensive dairy products such as milk powder, this would have had a relatively substantial bearing on cost-competitiveness. 	 		Energy cost increases in recent years are mainly due to spiralling network costs — partly driven by flaws in the regulatory frameworks governing electricity markets — and to a lesser extent, policies designed to reduce carbon emissions and promote renewable energy. While some reforms have occurred, further alterations to incentives in electricity network investment programs would be of value to the dairy and other industries. 	 	 	Distortionary forms of drought assistance, biofuel subsidies and genetically modified crop regulations in some states and territories reduce adjustment and innovation, affecting the efficiency of the dairy industry and the rest of the economy...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Lactase-deficient adults {{demonstrate}} improved lactose absorption {{and fewer}} symptoms when consuming yogurt than when consuming <b>milk</b> containing <b>equivalent</b> amounts of lactose. To examine this effect and its mechanisms in children, we compared symptoms and hydrogen production as {{an index of}} lactose malabsorption after typical servings of milk, pasteurized yogurt, and yogurt containing active live culture in 14 lactose-malabsorbing children (mean age 9. 5 y). Symptoms and interval breath-hydrogen concentrations were recorded for 8 h after inges-tion of 12 g lactose served as milk and yogurts. Lactose-malab-sorbing children experienced significantly fewer symptoms after consuming yogurt containing active cultures than after consuming milk (P < 0. 005). Pasteurized yogurt showed an intermediate effect. Lactose from yogurt was not better absorbed than was lactose from milk, as indicated by similar areas under the hydrogen curve; however, yogurt {{was associated with a}} delayed time to rise and lower rate of rise of the hydrogen curve. The rate of hydrogen rise correlated with the degree of symptoms. In children, mecha-nisms other than enhanced lactose absorption from yogurt may bead to changes in the kinetics of hydrogen production, which in turn are associated with improved tolerance.

40|$|In adults, {{overweight}} {{is associated}} with increased bone mineral density (BMD) and reduced risk of osteoporosis. However, overweight children experience fractures more often than healthy weight children. Given adequate calcium (Ca) intake, children with a higher body mass index (BMI) {{have been shown to}} have greater Ca retention than children with a lower BMI. Dairy foods are an excellent source of Ca and a good source of other essential nutrients needed to increase bone mineral content (BMC) and decrease fracture risk in children. The Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommends three cups of low fat <b>milk</b> or <b>equivalent</b> daily for these reasons. We hypothesized that children who were overweight, as compared to those who were healthy weight, would accrue more bone mass and grow larger bones making them less vulnerable to fracture if provided with three servings of dairy daily. Additionally, we hypothesized that the additional dairy would not be associated with an increase in body fat or weight while providing a positive effect on bone. ^ We recruited 240 low dairy consuming healthy boys and girls age 8 to 15. 9 y (11. 8 ± 1. 5 y mean ± SD) between years 2008 and 2011. Half were healthy weight (5 th - 70 th BMI percentile for age (...|$|R
