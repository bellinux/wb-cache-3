40|$|The {{increase}} in atmospheric concentration {{of carbon dioxide}} (CO₂) is contributing to global climate change. Agroforestry systems, such as shelterbelts, {{can contribute to the}} mitigation of increasing CO₂ levels, through carbon (C) sequestration in plant biomass and soils. However, little information is available on the storage and dynamics of soil organic carbon (SOC) for shelterbelt systems. The objective of this research was to examine the effect of shelterbelt plantings on the storage, physical stabilization and chemical composition of SOC for major shelterbelt species across Saskatchewan compared to adjacent agricultural fields. Soil and litter samples were collected for six major shelterbelt species including green ash (Fraxinus pennsylvanica), hybrid poplar (Populus spp.), <b>Manitoba</b> <b>maple</b> (Acer negundo), white spruce (Picea glauca), Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) and caragana (Caragana arborescens) and the adjacent agricultural fields at 59 sampling sites across the agricultural region of Saskatchewan. Measurement of SOC concentration for soil samples was preceded by fumigation with concentrated HCl (12 N), which was determined to be the efficient method for SOC determination in carbonate-rich soils. Physical stabilization of SOC was characterized by using the density fraction technique to separate SOC into uncomplexed, plant-derived debris (i. e. light fraction) and mineral-associated organic matter (i. e. heavy fraction). Changes in SOC composition due to shelterbelt plantation were studied using attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy and synchrotron based carbon K-edge X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy. Concentration of SOC for shelterbelts was significantly higher compared to agricultural fields throughout the soil profile (0 - 50 cm). Sequestration of SOC for shelterbelts varied from 6 - 38 Mg C ha⁻¹ under different shelterbelt species, along with 3 - 8 Mg C ha⁻¹ stored in the litter layer. Shelterbelts led to an {{increase in}} SOC content for both the labile light fraction and the mineral-associated heavy fraction. The increase in the heavy fraction was higher in coniferous shelterbelt species including white spruce and Scots pine, while the increase in the light fraction C was higher in hybrid poplar, <b>Manitoba</b> <b>maple,</b> green ash and caragana. These trends were attributed to differences in quality and decomposition rate of litter among shelterbelt species. Maximum amount of SOC was sequestered at the 10 - 30 cm soil depth, and the majority (70 %) of it was in the stable mineral-associated form. Light fraction C was predominant in the surface layer (0 - 10 cm), where it accounted for 92 % of the total sequestered C. Younger shelterbelts tended to lose SOC {{in the early years of}} shelterbelt establishment, but eventually resulted in net addition of C after about 20 years of age. SOC sequestration potential of shelterbelts was positively related to shelterbelt characteristics including stand age, tree height, diameter and crown width and density of litter layer. These variables together explained 56 - 67 % of the inter-site variability in the amount of SOC sequestered. Analysis of molecular composition of SOC revealed shelterbelts had higher abundance of processed forms of C such as aromatic and conjugated carboxyl groups for hybrid poplar and white spruce shelterbelts and aromatic and aliphatic C moieties for <b>Manitoba</b> <b>maple</b> shelterbelts. In contrast, agricultural field soils were enriched in easily degradable C forms such as polysaccharides. These results revealed a strong effect of initial litter quality and extent of decomposition on SOC composition. Together, these findings indicate that shelterbelt planting leads to sequestration of SOC, resulting in the decrease of atmospheric CO₂ concentration. Additionally, shelterbelts also influence organo-mineral association and molecular composition of SOC, which may affect stabilization and dynamics of sequestered SOC...|$|E
40|$|PresentationCompetition between {{trees and}} crops in alley {{cropping}} systems for soil moisture, light and nutrients, especially N {{can lead to}} decreased crop yield. However, there is tree-crop interactions in alley cropping the Canadian prairies are poorly understood. This study {{examined the effects of}} light and soil moisture conditions in the alleyways on yield and nutrition of forage crops. The experiment was conducted using a 9 -yeald old <b>Manitoba</b> <b>maple</b> alley cropping site with oats inter-planted in the alleys at the experimental site of the Agroforestry Development Centre, Indian Head, SK. Apart from crude protein (CP) and total nitrogen (TN) in the oats plant, dry matter content (DM), and acid detergent fiber (ADF) were not affected by distance from the tree row, orientation of oats plots and their interactions. Apparently, soil moisture (SMC) influenced yield and nutrition of oats in the northern orientation since DM, TN and CP were also higher in north facing plots. Producers may integrate trees on farm to diversify production cycles without comprising forage crop production and nutrition because no significant adverse effects were noted within 6 m from the tree row...|$|E
40|$|We used multivariate {{analysis}} to model boreal forest stand structure and dynamics at Riding Mountain National Park, Manitoba {{based on data}} from 202 sampled stands. Eight forest stand-types were recognized based on canopy composition: black spruce on peat substrates, jack pine - black spruce, bur oak, eastern deciduous (green ash - American elm - <b>Manitoba</b> <b>maple),</b> balsam fir, trembling aspen - paper birch - mountain maple, trembling aspen - balsam poplar, and white spruce. The first four stand-types occur in edaphically distinct environments, while the four remaining boreal mixedwood stand-types occur in edaphically similar environments. We found that the composition and abundance of advance regeneration were best predicted by current canopy composition (redundancy = 54. 4 %); this reflects both the limited dispersal of conifer seeds and the strong vegetative reproductive capacity of hardwoods. Biotically-controlled site factors such as bareground, herb and shrub cover, ungulate browsing intensity, and stand age were also reasonably good predictors f advance regeneration (redundancy = 31. 7 %). Edaphic variables such as soil pH, conductivity, particle size, organic horizon depth and slope proved to be poor predictors of advance regeneration, however (redundancy = 18. 1 %). Size-class ordination indicated that many stand-types have relatively short successional trajectories, suggesting limited change in forest canopy composition over time. There are two exceptions: in the jack pine - black spruce stand-type, black spruce will increase over time, and in the trembling aspen - paper birch - mountain maple stand-type, eastern deciduous species (green ash, American elm, <b>Manitoba</b> <b>maple,</b> and bur oak) are forecast to become increasingly dominant. We also describe a synoptic model of mixedwood boreal forest stand dynamics for the Riding Mountain area. The model includes a number of factors that we consider to be critical determinants of forest dynamics, such as seed source availability, small and large-scale disturbances, species life-history characteristics, and environmental gradients. Our succession model is more similar those described for eastern than western Canada, which may reflect the lower frequency of catastrophic fires in the Riding Mountain area compared to boreal forests further west. Our model emphasizes that successional trajectories do not converge towards a single self-perpetuating "climax". Instead, successional vectors may diverge, converge or remain cyclical, and multiple potential pathways are possible for each stand-type. Our results also illustrate that species assemblages, and the propensity for canopy change in the absence of fire, are governed by the cumulative and synergistic effects of climate, topography, disturbance frequency, size and intensity, edaphic conditions, and the proximity of parental seed sources. Fire suppression in the southern boreal forest has resulted in a paradigm shift in disturbance regime, from large, synchronous catastrophic fires to small-scale, asynchronous gap formation. A major challenge for boreal forest ecologists is to determine the long-term consequences of this paradigm shift on the composition, structure and health of boreal forest stands and landscapes...|$|E
40|$|The {{agroforestry}} {{practice of}} establishing shelterbelts and/or windbreaks composed of tree and shrub species that include buffaloberry (Shepherdia argentea Nutt.), caragana (Caragana arborescens Lam.) and sea buckthorn (Hippophae rhamnoides L.) is widespread within Saskatchewan. Shelterbelts play major roles in reducing wind speed, trapping snow, improving land-use efficiency and increasing economic returns. However, {{the practice of}} alley cropping within Saskatchewan is not popular. Also, apart from the protective roles the tree species offer in shelterbelts, some species have atmospheric nitrogen (N 2) -fixation capabilities through biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) that are potentially important. The simultaneous integration of trees and crops on the same land management unit may lead to competition between crops and trees for growth resources such as nutrients, soil moisture and incoming radiation, the latter leading to limited access of light for understory crops. Understanding {{the contributions of the}} trees in supplying nitrogen (N) through BNF and in modifying microclimatic conditions in the alleyways would generate information needed to know their impacts on yield and nutrition of associated crops. In order to assess the contribution of the tree species in supplying N and minimizing interspecific competition while maximizing the benefits of tree-based intercropping systems, the thesis quantified the BNF capabilities of each species under greenhouse conditions using 15 N dilution techniques and assessed how much of the fixed N 2 is transferred to associated triticale (Triticale hexaploide Lart.) and oats (Avena sativa L.) under field conditions. Growth and yield of oats was also studied by measuring photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and soil moisture in a <b>Manitoba</b> <b>maple</b> (Acer negundo var. negundo L.) -oats alley cropping system at Indian Head, SK. The BNF results showed that each of the test species fixes a substantial amount of N and there was a high transfer of N to associated triticale and oats. Results from the interspecific interaction study also showed that soil moisture was the primary factor affecting oats yields followed by light, with the south-lying oat plants affected more than north-lying. It can be concluded that alley cropping systems can be a practical and beneficial agroforestry practice within Saskatchewan. However, the distance between tree rows should be wide enough to permit farm machinery operations...|$|E
40|$|The Cypress Hills are a {{prominent}} landmark on the Canadian Great plains. Their sudden and considerable {{rise above the}} general landscape brings with it an equally abrupt vegetal transformation from tawny, semi-arid prairies to green, mesic forests and other, more luxuriant grasslands. The composition of these highland forests and prairies is dissimilar {{to that of the}} surrounding vegetations and has its nearest counterpart 200 miles away in the Rocky Mountains of Alberta and in the Aspen Grove Region adjacent to the Boreal Forest. This outlier is relict of at least early post glacial time and covers a landscape that, in part at least, was spared glacial occupation. The forces which isolated these relicts have eliminated all but 6 tree species of which Pinus contorta var. latifolia (lodgepole pine) and Populus tremuloides (trembling aspen) are by far the most abundant. Picea glauca var. albertiana (white spruce) and Ponulus balsamifera (balsam poplar) are common but less abundant, and Betula papyrifera var. subcordata (white birch) and Acer negundo (<b>Manitoba</b> <b>maple)</b> are rare. For convenience, the first 4 species will be referred to as pine, aspen, spruce and balsam poplar respectively. Particularly noticeable is the absence of the genus Abies, an important constituent of most coniferous regions. Festuca scabrella is the most abundant grass of this elevated prairie and, together with Potentilla fruticosa, is largely responsible for its physiognomy. Numerous spring-fed streams emanate from these uplands, providing the only available surface water for many miles. The lush vegetation of the Cypress Hills sustains this brook flow by stabilizing its watersheds and is, in turn, sustained by these same waters. Man, attracted to the hills by the timber and grazing land they offer, and needing this source of water, has sought to exploit their resources and to manage them for his own purposes. The variety and inconstancy of past management efforts attests to a lack of basic knowledge concerning the relationships of this vegetation to its components and to its habitat. A working knowledge of the climate, soils and vegetation of the Cypress Hills has yet to be synthesized.
