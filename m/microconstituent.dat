Diffusional transformations like austenite transforming to a cementite and ferrite mixture can be explained using the sigmoidal curve; For example the beginning of pearlitic transformation {{is represented by the}} pearlite start (Ps) curve. This transformation is complete at Pf curve. Nucleation requires an incubation time. The rate of nucleation increases and the rate of <b>microconstituent</b> growth decreases as the temperature decreases from the liquidus temperature reaching a maximum at the bay or nose of the curve. Thereafter, the decrease in diffusion rate due to low temperature offsets the effect of increased driving force due to greater difference in free energy. As a result of the transformation, the microconstituents, Pearlite and Bainite, form; Pearlite [...] forms at higher temperatures and bainite at lower.|$|E
40|$|Eutectoid {{decomposition}} in steels {{can result}} in either a lamellar (pearlite) or non-lamellar (bainite) <b>microconstituent.</b> Similarly, in Ti-X alloys, both a lamellar and non-lamellar <b>microconstituent</b> have been observed following eutectoid decomposition. It {{has been suggested that}} the lamellar and non-lamellar microconstituents observed in Ti-X alloys are synonymous with pearlite and bainite in steels. This thesis presents a thorough review of all relevant literature on eutectoid decomposition in Ti-X alloys as well as pearlite and bainite in steels. A programme of experimental work has been conducted covering nine Ti-X alloys; a hypoeutectoid, eutectoid and hypereutectoid alloy of each Ti-Co, Ti-Cr and Ti-Mn. Various heat treatments were completed including isothermal, slow cooling and thermomechanical treatments. Only eutectoid and hypereutectoid Ti-Co contained the lamellar <b>microconstituent.</b> All remaining alloys contained a non-lamellar <b>microconstituent.</b> The lamellar <b>microconstituent</b> formed from both plates of alpha(Ti) and allotriomorphs of Ti 2 Co. Heat treatment at progressively higher undercooling resulted in the lamellar <b>microconstituent</b> being increasingly replaced by a spheroidal <b>microconstituent.</b> The non-lamellar <b>microconstituent</b> consisted of plates of alpha(Ti) separated by beta(Ti) with the intermetallic phase at alpha(Ti); beta(Ti) boundaries. Once the reaction had reached completion no beta(Ti) remained. Definitions for pearlite and bainite have been presented based upon well documented experimental evidence. The Ti-X lamellar and non-lamellar microconstituents {{have been shown to be}} synonymous with pearlite and bainite in steels based upon these definitions. Pearlite and bainite have also been shown to form by distinct mechanisms and it is therefore incorrect for them to be considered as products which are in any sense opposites to each other. A new hypothesis has been proposed suggesting that it is not pearlite and bainite that are competing processes in Ti-X alloys, but pearlite and the formation of alpha(Ti) plates. This can be extended to decomposition in any eutectoid system that might be viewed as the competition between pearlite and plate formation...|$|E
40|$|The {{relative}} electrochemical {{properties of}} second phases {{compared to the}} surrounding matrix gives rise to localization of corrosion on magnesium (Mg) alloys. Localized corrosion and its subsequent propagation in Mg alloys is largely driven by so-called ‘microgalvanic coupling’ of microstructural constituents within the alloy microstructure. In the present work, atomic force microscopy (AFM) imaging coupled with scanning Kelvin probe force microscopy (SKPFM) were used to generate surface Volta potential maps {{of a range of}} Mg alloys. In this manner, the relative Volta potential difference(s) between the respective alloy matrix phase and the <b>microconstituent</b> phase(s) of each sample were determined. Correlations between relative Volta potentials and phase composition were then inferred based on comparison of AFM optical and topographical images with corresponding scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images and energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDS) maps of the same or similar features. Sample preparation technique, testing conditions, and proper calibration of the SKPFM were all seen to influence the Volta potentials acquired. Because the relative Volta potential difference is known to serve as an index for local corrosion—particularly under thin electrolyte layers and in chloride solutions—a review of published SKPFM data was conducted to provide a critical assessment of the surface Volta potential differences between different <b>microconstituent</b> phases in a variety of Mg alloys to aid in understanding and in the future improvement of the atmospheric corrosion of Mg alloys...|$|E

40|$|A lot of {{attention}} has been paid to trace amounts of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) and endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) in drinking water supplies. Current water and wastewater treatment techniques, such as coagulation, flocculation, and sedimentation for water treatment and the conventional activated sludge process for wastewater treatment, have shown only limited success in their removal. Although there is a lack of evidence linking these emerging <b>microconstituents</b> to adverse human health effects, not a lot is known about the effects of long term exposure to these compounds and more research is still needed. This study examined advanced wastewater treatment processes, such as membrane bioreactors (MBRs), along with processes that are not normally used for treating wastewater to remove these emerging contaminants. The processes include oxidation with ozone coupled with biological active filtration (BAF) to increase the removal efficiencies of these compounds. A pilot scale membrane bioreactor (MBR) was set up at the Albuquerque Bernalillo County Water Utility Authority (ABCWUA) Southside Water Reclamation Plant (SWRP). The MBR was continuously fed primary treated wastewater. The MBR effluent was used to feed an ozone contactor, which then fed a BAF column. The MBR was operated at an SRT of 10 days throughout the duration of the experiments. Three ozone doses where examined. The applied ozone doses were 2, 4, and 8 mg/L, which correspond to a ratio of 0. 5, 1, and 2 mg ozone/mg TOC. After ozone treatment, the water was pumped to the BAF column. The BAF column used anthracite media that was seeded with MLSS and soaked in MBR feedwater for a week to establish a bio-growth prior to the experiments. The system was run for at least one week between sampling events to establish steady state conditions at each new ozone dose. To determine steady state conditions, TOC, UV 254, SUVA, and BDOC removal were evaluated. This study also investigated the removal of <b>microconstituents</b> using a reverse osmosis (RO) system that ran concurrent to the Ozone/BAF treatment train for two of the ozone doses. The concentrations of the compounds of interest were tested in the effluents of the MBR, ozone, BAF, and RO. Significant removal of the selected compounds was observed at all selected ozone doses. Although removal of <b>microconstituents</b> increased with increasing ozone dose, little additional removal occurred at ozone concentrations greater than 4 mg/L. The change in percent removal of both organics and <b>microconstituents</b> was larger going from an ozone dose of 2 to 4 mg/L than going from 4 to 8 mg/L. The BAF column did not dramatically decrease the concentrations of these compounds after the initial decrease due to ozonation, although additional TOC removal was achieved. This can be contributed to oxidation breaking the compounds down to smaller, more biodegradable compounds. Bulk organic analysis such as TOC, UV 254 absorbance, SUVA, and BDOC show that organic compounds are not mineralized to CO 2 and H 2 O by ozonation alone. However, the data also shows that additional destruction of TOC occurred in the BAF column following ozonation. Although the organic analyses do not indicate the fate of individual <b>microconstituents,</b> the <b>microconstituents</b> can be expected to have the same fate as other organics.

40|$|Abstract. Hypostoichiometric Fe-Pd binary alloys (35 - 45 at % Pd) were {{severely}} deformed (> 90 %) {{and subsequently}} aged to induce concomitant recrystallization, precipitation, and ordering. This thermomechanical processing strategy was articulated by Hornbogen [1] {{over thirty years}} ago. The resulting exchange-coupled ferromagnets contain ferrite precipitates and a complex metastable two-phase lamellar transformation product comprised of ordered L 10 and a metastable FCC phase. The later duplex <b>microconstituent</b> is suggested to form {{in conjunction with a}} so-called pseudospinodal reaction [2] involving emerging cubic and tetragonal phases, whereby phase separation and ordering result from continuous changes in composition and a reduction in symmetry, cubic to tetragonal. The deformation texture of the parent austenite is substantially retained in the transformation product, resulting in anisotropy of the magnetic properties as determined by magnetometry (VSM).

40|$|The present {{article is}} {{concerned}} with a theoretical and experimental study of the growth kinetics of pearlite in a 0. 4 C- 1. 6 Mn medium carbon steels. Factors controlling the isothermal formation of this <b>microconstituent</b> are explored in this work. In this sense, the transition temperature between local equilibrium (LE) and no partition local equilibrium (NPLE) growth mechanisms is theoretically determined. Moreover, the nucleation of pearlite has been considered as a cementite precipitation process on a moving austenite-ferrite interface. Finally, a theoretical model is presented in this work to calculate the evolution of austenite-to-pearlite transformation with time at a very wide temperature range.

40|$|Transmission {{electron}} microscopy study of brazed joint microstructure in a Ni 3 Al-based intermetallic alloy IC 6 was performed. A continuously distributed <b>microconstituents</b> consisting of 3 ̆b 3 solid-solution, M 3 B 2 -type and M 23 B 6 -type borides, which were likely formed by eutectic-type reaction(s) from residual liquated insert during cooling from brazing temperature, were observed along the joint centreline. Consideration of possible incipient melting due to eutectic-type transformation reaction of these phases is pertinent to development of post braze heat treatment for modifying the brazement microstructure. 9 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

40|$|Abstract. Microstructural and {{mechanical}} characterization of Nitinol gas tungsten arc weld (GTAW) and furnace brazing (FB) welds for grade 1 titanium plates {{are carried out}} in order to study the microstructure developed after welding {{and its effect on}} the mechanical properties of welds. The GTAW process yields the highest hardness weld. The constituents for this weld consist of a dendritic structure of NiTi and NiTi 2 intermetallic phases. The FB process promotes a change of the welds chemical composition due to atomic diffusion of Ti. The weld <b>microconstituents</b> consist of a mixture of a Ti-rich and NiTi 2 eutectic and a proeutectic Ti-rich phase...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} the {{microstructure}} of reaction bonded silicon nitride on strength is examined. The morphologies of the various <b>microconstituents</b> (alpha-matte, beta-spikes, residual silicon and porosity) each {{play a role in}} determining the strength of the material. While density and hence percent porosity greatly affect strength, it is shown that the pore size and pore size distribution affect strength with equal importance. By minimizing the pore size and distribution and maximizing the alpha-beta ratio, a reaction bonded material (2. 4 kg/cu m) has been produced with a room temperature modulus of rupture (three-point bending) of 297 MPa from a low green density starting material (1. 5 kg/cu m) ...|$|R
