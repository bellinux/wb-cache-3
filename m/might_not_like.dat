500|$|Writers Steve Pemberton and Reece Shearsmith, who had {{previously}} co-written and starred in The League of Gentlemen and Psychoville, took inspiration for Inside No. 9 from [...] "David and Maureen", episode 4 of the first series of Psychoville, which was in turn inspired by Alfred Hitchcock's Rope. [...] "David and Maureen" [...] took place entirely in a single room, and was filmed in only two shots. At the same time, the concept of Inside No. 9 was a [...] "reaction" [...] to Psychoville, with Shearsmith saying that [...] "we'd been so involved with labyrinthine over-arcing, {{we thought it would}} be nice to do six different stories with a complete new house of people each week. That's appealing, because as a viewer you <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>like</b> this story, but you've got a different one next week."

But I don't know whether the risk–reward [...] is worth it." [...] The Daily Telegraph writer Douglas Murray said the entry only gave [...] "200" [...] more legitimacy, writing, [...] " [...] of course just confirms the point that the South Park boys were making. [...] I'd have said that was point proved. South Park 1: Islamists 0." [...] On the April 22, 2010, episode of Comedy Central's The Daily Show, host Jon Stewart went into a ten-minute tirade about the alleged death threats, expressing disgust at the alleged hypocrisy of Revolution Muslim's speech while its members enjoy the American lifestyle and freedom of speech.|$|E
500|$|Tatiana {{fell in love}} on {{at least}} one occasion. In an article in the December 2004 edition of the {{magazine}} Royalty Digest: A Journal of Record Peter de Malama wrote that his cousin, Dmitri Yakovlevich Malama, an officer in the Imperial Russian Cavalry, met Tatiana when he was wounded in 1914 and a romance later developed between Tatiana and the young man when he was appointed an equerry to the court of the Tsar at Tsarskoye Selo. Dmitri Malama gave Tatiana a French bulldog she named [...] "Ortipo" [...] in September 1914. [...] "Forgive me about the little dog," [...] Tatiana wrote to her mother on 30 September 1914. [...] "To say the truth, when he asked should I like to have it if he gave it to me, I at once said yes. You remember, I always wanted to have one, and only afterwards when we came home I thought that suddenly you <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>like</b> me having one. But I really was so pleased at the idea that I forgot about everything." [...] The dog died, but Malama gave her a replacement puppy. Tatiana took it with her to Yekaterinburg, where it died {{with the rest of the}} family. Malama paid the imperial family a visit some eighteen months after he gave Tatiana the first dog. [...] "My little Malama came for an hour yesterday evening," [...] wrote Alexandra to Nicholas on 17 March 1916. [...] "...Looks flourishing more of a man now, an adorable boy still. I must say a perfect son in law he w(ou)ld have been – why are foreign P(rin)ces not as nice!" [...] Malama was killed in August 1919 while commanding a unit of the White Russians fighting the civil war against the Bolsheviks in the Ukraine, according to Peter de Malama.|$|E

500|$|Pemberton and Shearsmith took {{inspiration}} for Inside No. 9 from [...] "David and Maureen", episode 4 {{of the first}} series of Psychoville, which was in turn inspired by Alfred Hitchcock's Rope. This episode took place entirely in a single room, and was filmed in only two shots. The writers were keen to explore other stories in this bottle episode or TV play format, and Inside No. 9 allowed them to do this. At the same time, the concept of Inside No. 9 was a [...] "reaction" [...] to Psychoville, with Shearsmith saying {{that the two of}} them had [...] "been so involved with labyrinthine over-arcing, we thought it would be nice to do six different stories with a complete new house of people each week. That's appealing, because as a viewer you <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>like</b> this story, but you've got a different one next week." [...] Elsewhere, Shearsmith explained that the pair returned to writing macabre stories as they [...] "always feel slightly unfulfilled if [...] write something that's purely comedic, [...] it just feels too frivolous and light". The first story that the pair wrote specifically for Inside No. 9 was about a birthday party. BBC producers felt that this story would work as the opening episode of a sitcom, but, given the script's events, Pemberton and Shearsmith were not happy to develop the idea into its own programme. The script was consequently shelved and revisited during the planning process for the second series, becoming [...] "Nana's Party", the fifth episode of the series and eleventh overall. During the filming Inside No. 9, Shearsmith professed excitement to be working on the programme, saying that [...] "eing in the middle of filming a third series of Psychoville would be utterly depressing". Pemberton and Shearsmith aimed for a simpler experience with Inside No. 9 than they had experienced with Psychoville, describing [...] "Sardines", Inside No. 9s first episode, by saying that it was [...] "just about some good actors in a wardrobe with a good story." ...|$|E

[...] "Free Speech" [...] points at [...] "Censorship" [...] and says: [...] "All history, all reason condemns you: GO!". In his pamphlet, Griffith called censorship [...] "this malignant pygmy" [...] who had mutated into a fully grown [...] "Caliban" [...] (a character from William Shakespeare's play The Tempest who is often depicted as a black man). When Sherwin Lewis of The New York Globe wrote a piece that expressed criticism of the film's distorted portrayal of history and said that it was not worthy of constitutional protection because its purpose was to make a few [...] "dirty dollars", Griffith responded that [...] "the public should not be afraid to accept the truth, even though it <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>like</b> it".
