40|$|Abstract: At present, {{the pump}} setting depth of machine wells in Tahe Oilfield is universally too deep as the {{reservoir}} is buried deep, viscosity of heavy oil is high, and the producing energy weakened. This {{will increase the}} input of sucker rod, oil tube material and lead to enlarge suspension point load of pumping unit <b>mule</b> <b>head</b> and energy consumption. According to the problems, {{on the basis of}} the regularity of distribution of wellbore pressure field, viscosity field, temperature field, this paper puts forward a new matching lifting technology: moving down the point of blending and picking up the pump setting depth. Moving down the point of blending can reduce the producing energy loss and enforce the crude oil’s fluidity in the wellbore,and picking up the pump depth can reduce the cost and energy consumption, Field test shows that after the new type matching lifting technology implement, test wells are normal in operation. The pump setting depth is partly picked up and pumping unit load decreases. The single well saves thin oil by more than 10 %. ...|$|E

Its owner followed, yelling like a madman. He {{might as well have}} chased the wind; and it is probable that he would never have mounted his steed again had not the vaquero come to his aid. This man, leaping on his own horse, which was a very fine one, dashed after the runaway, with which he came up in a few minutes; then grasping the long coil of line that hung at his saddle-bow, he swung it round once or twice, and threw the lasso, or noose, adroitly over the <b>mule's</b> <b>head,</b> and brought it up.|$|R

It was still some distance from the spot under the hatchway where the band and tackle were to be attached. Towards this Tom and Dick dragged the beast by the head, while Harry assisted with the tail. No power on earth could have made that mule walk! With its ears back and all its legs planted stiffly forward, it was made to slide in the required direction by main force. The place of execution reached, Dick jammed its head against the barrier, Tom hauled its tail taut over the same and made fast. There was no intentional cruelty in their actions, but difficult work had to be quickly done, and they could not afford to be squeamish. Obstinate violence had to be overcome by resolute vigour. The mule was now helplessly fixed, with its tongue hanging out and its eyes protruding. Nevertheless, in that condition it continued, without ceasing, to struggle and try to kick, and flatten its ears. It was a magnificent exhibition of determination to resist to the very death!--a glorious quality when exercised in a good cause, thought I--my mind reverting to patriots and martyrs.|$|R
