However, thegreatest choice often starts where the evidence finishes—namely between drugs of the same class. This article seeks therefore to offer the principles which govern when and how it is appropriate to differentiate drugs within a class, and discuss topical examples among the drugs commonly used in cardiology. c GENERAL OVERVIEW The parameters which can reasonably be compared between drugs are shown in table 1. If this were all, {{it might be possible to}} devise semi-automatic algorithms to calculate which drug(s) have the highest score for any given indication. However, the relatively factual answers that could be filled in each cell of the table for a given drug are only part of the decision <b>making</b> <b>process,</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> judgemental are: (1) the strength of evidence for each of the answers; and (2) the second order issues of how to compare, for example, one drug of apparently superior efficacy with another which is better tolerated. Compliance is sometimes cited as a reason for choosing one drug rather than another; compliance is not itself a property of the drug, but a composite phenomenon reflecting the interplay between efficacy, tolerability, frequency or route of administration, and cost. Particularly contentious are questions of cost effectiveness. For example, the quality of the evidence for effec...|$|E

The particular focus of this paper is the university sector. Our analysis of this sector revealed that both men and women clearly believed that the presence of women in senior roles had changed management cultures. We explore participants' descriptions of the nature of that change. Inherent to this discussion are notions of 'critical mass' and 'critical acts'. We define these notions and explore the influences that a critical mass of women in senior roles appears to have had on management cultures in the university sector. We found when women at senior levels reach a critical mass, both women and men believed that women encouraged greater collaboration, <b>more</b> consultative decision <b>making</b> <b>processes</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> collegial workplaces.

40|$|Abstract: Data mining {{techniques}} are becoming <b>more</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> important for assisting decision <b>making</b> <b>processes</b> <b>and,</b> <b>more</b> generally, to extract hidden knowledge from massive data collections {{in the form}} of patterns, models, and trends that hold in the data collections. During this extraction of hidden knowledge from this massive data collection, privacy of data is a big issue. PPDM (Privacy Preserving Data Mining) approaches protect data by modifying them to mask or erase the original sensitive data that should not be revealed. PPDM approaches based on principle- loss of privacy, measuring the capacity of estimating the original data from the modified data, and loss of information, measuring the loss of accuracy in the data. The main goal of these approaches is therefore to provide a trade-off between privacy and accuracy. In this paper we show that l-diversity has a number of limitations. In particular, it is neither necessary nor sufficient to prevent attribute disclosure. We propose a novel privacy notion called t-closeness, which requires that the distribution of a sensitive attribute in any equivalence class is close to the distribution of the attribute in the overall table (i. e., the distance between the two distributions should be no more than a threshold t) ...|$|R
40|$|In Belgium, the {{long-term}} management of radioactive waste {{is under the}} exclusive competence of the Belgian Agency for Radioactive Waste and Enriched Fissile Materials (knew as ONDRAF/NIRAS). Unlike low-level waste, no institutional policy has yet been formally approved for {{the long-term}} management of high level and/or long-lived radioactive waste (knew as B&C waste). In this context, ONDRAF/NIRAS considers the public and stakeholders’ participation as an essential factor {{in the formulation of}} an effective and legitimate policy. This is why it has decided to integrate them in different ways during the elaboration of the Waste Plan (ONDRAF/NIRAS-document containing guidelines to make a principled policy decision about nuclear waste management). To do so, social scientists have been regularly mobilized either as external evaluators, follow-up committee members, or participatory observants. Hence, the Waste Plan is only {{the first step in a}} long decision-making process. For a PhD student under contract with ONDRAF/NIRAS, this mandate consists of thinking out a way to construct an inter-organizational innovative communication system that would be participative, transparent and embedded in a long- term perspective, thus integrating all the further legal steps to take throughout the decision-making process. In this regard, two paradoxical constraints must be taken into account: on the one hand, my own influence on the legal decision-making process should remain limited, because of a series of constraints, lock-ins and previous decisions which have to be respected; on the other hand, ONDRAF/NIRAS expects the research conclusions to be policy relevant and useful. In this paper, the purpose is twofold. Firstly, the issues raised by this policy mandate is an opportunity to question the performative dimensions of the social scientist in the decision- <b>making</b> <b>process</b> <b>and,</b> <b>more</b> specifically, to have a reflexive view on our position as PhD Student. Secondly, assuming the role of “embarked” social scientist, numerous of answers will discuss to face the different dilemmas of the researcher “in action”.

Single neuron recordings in non-human primates and functional imaging in humans suggest the intraparietal sulcus {{is an important}} neuroanatomical locus of numerical estimation. Other lines of inquiry implicate the IPS in numerous other functions, including attention and decision making. Here we provide a direct test of whether IPS has functional specificity for numerosity judgments.

Inactivation of either area caused parallel impairments in both tasks and {{no evidence of a}} selective deficit in numerical processing. These findings do not support a causal role for the IPS in numerical discrimination, except insofar as it also has a role in the discrimination of color.

Understanding risk is vital for military leaders that prepare their forces to operate in risky environments against adversaries that seek to impose risk upon their enemies. Furthermore, the decisions of military leaders affect those subordinates under their command and ultimately {{the will of the}} nation that has sent them abroad. It is paramount, therefore, that we utilize a decision process to reveal how emotions can affect our judgment. Frequently, cultural forces in the military can result in ill-informed and emotionally biased decisions that are an irresponsible execution of duty. We address this problem by defining the objective components of risk using mathematical concepts then characterizing the nature of risk in different military environments using those concepts. Our approach uses economic principles, game theory, and decision theory to illustrate how calculations of risk should influence decision-making. Objectively defining risk will aid in revealing the subjective components of risk, where the mathematical principles explain both how decisions are effectively made and how to make decisions effectively. Risk in training and risk in combat pose two very different problems; but to be fully understood both environments must be viewed together.

The quality of data sources is frequently very poor, therefore a cleansing process is required before using such data for decision <b>making</b> <b>processes.</b> When alternative (<b>and</b> <b>more</b> trusted) data sources are not available data can be cleansed only us-ing business rules derived from domain knowledge. Business rules focus on fixing inconsistencies, but an inconsistency can be cleansed in different ways (i. e. the correction can be not deterministic), therefore the choice on how to cleanse data can (even strongly) affect the aggregate values computed for decision making purposes. The paper proposes a methodology exploiting Finite State Systems to quantitatively estimate how computed variables and indicators might {{be affected by the}} uncertainty related to low data quality, indepen-dently from the data cleansing methodology used.

This thesis examines the findings of a study into decision <b>making</b> <b>processes</b> which determine the provision and legitimacy of secure accommodation for young people in one local authority area in Scotland. The thesis begins by investigating the legislative and policy context, arguing that policy confusion in this area means secure accommodation is likely to face an uncertain future. It goes on to provide an overview of relevant research and contends {{that there is a need}} to better understand the <b>processes</b> <b>and</b> factors influencing local decision making. The case study methodology employed is explicated which included the use of interviews, questionnaires, observations, and focus groups in order to gain the perspectives of managers, social workers, children’s panel members, residential workers and young people. The thesis explores the range of factors which were found to influence local decision makers including: their role in the decision making system and the operation of that system; their use of legislation and guidance; their subjective understanding of risk and risk assessment; their personal and collective ‘thresholds of risk’ which were linked to ideas about gender, age and vulnerability; the quality of ‘evidence’ about risks and needs which was influenced by who and how this ‘evidence’ of risk was presented; available resources and perceptions about the suitability of those resources to meet the needs of particular young people and the resident group already in secure placement. Participant conceptualisations of risk are analysed. In contrast to adult decision makers, this thesis demonstrates that young people often understand their own ‘risky’ behaviour as an attempt to communicate with social work systems within which they feel disempowered. The thesis concludes by making a number of recommendations for improvements to decision making policy and practice, including the need for greater transparency in relation to decision <b>making</b> systems <b>and</b> <b>processes</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> opportunities for service user participation at every level of local decision making.

Failure to detect the crowd behaviour at the right time could lead to unnecessary injuries and fatalities. Over the past decades there have been many incidents of crowd which caused major injuries and fatalities and lead to physical damages. Examples of crowd disasters occurred in past decades include the tragedy of Hillsborough football stadium at Sheffield where at least 93 football supporters have been killed and 400 injured in 1989 in Britain's worst-ever sporting disaster (BBC, 1989). Recently in Cambodia a pedestrians stampede during the Water Festival celebration resulted in 345 deaths and 400 injuries (BBC, 2010) and in 2011 at least 16 people were killed and 50 others were injured in a stampede in the northern Indian town of Haridwar (BBC, 2011). Such disasters could be avoided or losses reduced by using different technologies. Crowd simulation models have been found effective in the prediction of potential crowd hazards in critical situations and thus help in reducing fatalities. However, {{there is a need to}} combine the advancement in simulation with real time crowd characterisation such as the estimation of real time density in order to provide accurate prognosis in crowd behaviour and enhance crowd management and safety, particularly in mega event such as the Hajj.

40|$|ENGLISH ABSTRACT: The aim of {{this study}} is to {{investigate}} the feasibility of implementing an MBA Oath in a South African context for Business Professionals to utilise in their Professional careers, across industries within the economy. The idea of formulating and implementing an MBA Oath to shape the ethical outlook of Business Professionals graduating with MBA degrees was brought into existence at Harvard in 2009. This movement quickly spread throughout internationally acclaimed Universities garnering both widespread support and criticism. This paper will examine the topics relating to Business Ethics, the implementation of Codes of Ethics and other Professional Codes of Ethics in a detailed literature review in order to better understand the context and relevance of the study in the South African setting. Through abstraction of what the Top 40 listed entities on the JSE by market capitalising prescribe to be the most fundamental values and core guiding principles, combined with insight assembled from numerous interviews with subject matter experts in the field, a survey will be tabulated. The survey will look broadly at ethics within the South African economy and industry context to frame the current issues. It will then navigate down to a company compliance level to discover how people perceive the ethical structures within their organisations. It will look to explore the possibility of implementing an MBA Oath through Business Schools within South Africa and investigate the associated challenges. Finally, it will seek to identify a road forward; promoting ethical behaviour in local companies for generations to come. The final phase will look to analyse and synthesise all of the data that has been collected to form meaningful conclusions. The research paper provides a solid starting point for further investigation into initiating and implementing meaningful ethical frameworks aimed at increasing awareness, influencing people’s decision <b>making</b> <b>processes</b> <b>and</b> for promoting <b>more</b> ethically sound organisations in the South African economy...|$|R

Genuine CAD/CAM integration is necessary to make products of higher quality with lower cost and shorter lead times. Although CAD and CAM have been extensively used in industry, effective CAD/CAM integration has not been implemented. The major obstacles of CAD/CAM integration are the representation of design <b>and</b> <b>process</b> knowledge <b>and</b> the adaptive ability of computer aided process planning (CAPP). This research is aimed to develop a feature-based CAD/CAM integration methodology. Artificial intelligent techniques such as neural networks, heuristic algorithms, genetic algorithms and fuzzy logics are used to tackle problems. The activities considered include: 1) Component design based {{on a number of}} standard feature classes with validity check. A feature classification for machining application is defined adopting ISO 10303 -STEP AP 224 from a multi-viewpoint of design and manufacture. 2) Search of interacting features and identification of features relationships.

Therefore, they have identified a need for support in the quotation process {{in order to reduce the}} quotation lead-time and ensure a higher level of accuracy in the cost estimations. The Quotation Calculator, an application program, has been developed as part of the degree thesis which was carried out at AB Norrahammars Mekaniska Verkstad, NMW 2006 / 07. This Quotation Calculator can be operated to calculate the material and manufacturing costs of a new product.

NMW wants to generate the data needed from the machining module for the cost calculations. Hence this project was initiated in order to extract data from CATIA V 5 for further use in Quotation Calculator or other computer system in NMW. This work has resulted in a system developed with a common hosted programming language to extract and transfer information. The system retrieves model geometry from CAD <b>and</b> information on <b>process</b> planning from CAM, then matches the information in the application for the purpose of cost estimation. The system once developed, is supposed to be used for every new product. For this approach, the relationship of the data from CATIA V 5 and the Quotation Calculator has been analyzed. Within this thesis, the focus is on production cost estimation. The method used here is programming in Visual Basic Editor to extract information from the machining module in CATIA V 5 and then import them to Microsoft Excel. With standard operations, tables of data and several inputs, the cost calculation and hence the quotation process can be automatically implemented. This work has been generated with the Quotation Calculator. With the correct input data to <b>process</b> planning <b>and</b> this new quotation system, the machining time and the costs can be estimated <b>more</b> accurately <b>and</b> easier.

40|$|Hong Kong’s sub-degree {{sector has}} grown at a {{tremendous}} speed since its emergence in 2001. There {{are now more}} than twenty colleges offering a host of Associate Degree and Higher Diploma programmes. In this highly competitive sub-degree sector, college administrators and faculty members are increasingly concerned with the quality of their educational services as well as their students’ perceptions of these services. Current literature on this sector of the Hong Kong education system provides scant analysis on the issue of students’ perception of education quality while the foci of their management strategies are very diverse (Huang, 2003; Choy, 2004; Law, 2010, 2011). To fill these knowledge gaps a conceptual framework was developed to investigate the relationship between management strategies and students’ perception of education quality in Hong Kong’s sub-degree colleges. To ensure reliability and validity of the findings, a multiple case-study approach with a comparative research strategy was used in this study. Four sub-degree colleges with differences in their organizations’ natures and modes of programme operation were purposefully selected. Information was collected primarily from in-depth, individual interviews and focus group discussions with programme administrators, lecturers, and students in the sample colleges. The collected data were analyzed using the proposed conceptual framework, with the aim of identifying policies and practices that are commonly used in the sub-degree colleges that took part in this study to ensure the quality of their educational services, as well as their effectiveness from students’ perspective. The findings in this study show that all sample colleges have to work with two interrelated variables: institutional reputation and diversity in students’ educational goals and academic ability. A College Quality Alignment Model was developed to describe the four different stages of institutional development and to illustrate how different management strategies should be applied to enhance students’ perception of education quality. As revealed from the present study, students with different educational goals perceive education quality differently. Students with high levels of educational aspiration show a trend of applying for Associate Degree programmes. These students generally regard sub-degree programmes as their second chance to progress to the local government-funded universities. They treat examinations as a competition in which fairness is of utmost importance. To them everything about the college they are attending should be well structured and all learning materials and examination procedures must be standardized. They also prefer to study at colleges affiliated with high ranking local universities. They believe that this will enhance their chance of transferring to the affiliated university. Hence, Associate Degree students focus on the structural and symbolic management strategies in the programmatic organization. Students who are associated with high levels of occupational aspiration are most likely to apply for Higher Diploma programmes. As there is more diversity in their levels of ability and motivation, they focus more on the learning <b>process</b> <b>and</b> prefer lecturers who are patient <b>and</b> offer <b>more</b> help. As these students are keen to acquire practical skills, they desire lecturers to share their work experience. They are eager to participate in the policy <b>making</b> <b>process</b> <b>and</b> demand <b>more</b> flexibility in their assessments. As such, Higher Diploma students focus on the human resources and political management strategies in the programmatic organization. This study contributes to the understanding of education quality in sub-degree colleges from the organizational perspective in higher education. The proposed College Quality Alignment Model enriches theoretical perspectives as well as offering practical recommendations in the field of management and organizational studies in higher education. published_or_final_versionEducationDoctoralDoctor of Educatio...|$|R
