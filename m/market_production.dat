25|$|In the 1980s and 1990s, the Amarone wines of Valpolicella {{experienced}} {{a spike in}} popularity on the world's wine <b>market.</b> <b>Production</b> of Amarone jumped from 522,320 US gallons (19,772 hectoliters) in 1972 to 1.2 million gallons (46,500 hl) by 1990. By 2000 Amarone production grew to over 3.9 million (148,000 hl). By this point, the price for grapes destined for Amarone production was nearly three times higher than what a comparable quantity of grapes would fetch for basic Valpolicella production. This sparked renewed interest in planting vineyards in the high altitude hillside locations that produced lower yields of grapes better suited for Amarone production. In the 21st century, the reputation of Valpolicella wines continued to expand on the world's wine market, as ambitious winemakers began to invest more in advanced viticultural and winemaking techniques that produce higher quality wines. In 2003, the DOC regulations were adjusted to eliminate mandatory blending requirements for sub-quality grapes such as Molinara. At the end of 2009, the production of both Amarone and recioto dessert wines in the Valpolicella zone received Italy's highest quality wine designation as a DOCG zones.|$|E
500|$|In California, Cabernet Sauvignon has {{developed}} its characteristic style and reputation, recognizable in the world's <b>market.</b> <b>Production</b> and plantings of the grape in California {{are similar in}} quantity to those of Bordeaux. The 1976 Judgment of Paris wine tasting event helped to catapult Californian Cabernet Sauvignons onto the international stage when Stag's Leap Wine Cellars' 1973 Stags Leap District Cabernet Sauvignon beat out classified Bordeaux estates like Château Mouton Rothschild, Château Montrose, Château Haut-Brion and Château Léoville-Las Cases in a blind tasting conducted by French wine experts. In the 1980s, a new epidemic of phylloxera hit California, devastating many vineyards, which needed replanting. There was some speculation that ravaged Cabernet vineyards would be replanted with other varietals (such as those emerging from the Rhone Rangers movement) but in fact California plantings of Cabernet Sauvignon [...] doubled between 1988 and 1998; many wine regions— such as Napa Valley north of Yountville and Sonoma's Alexander Valley— were almost completely dominated by the grape variety. It also started to gain a foothold in Dry Creek Valley, Sonoma Mountain and Mendocino County. Cabernet from Sonoma County has shown a tendency to feature anise and black olive notes while Napa County Cabernets are characterized by their strong black fruit flavors.|$|E

2500|$|South African wine has {{a history}} dating back to 1659 with Constantia, a {{vineyard}} near Cape Town. [...] Access to international markets led to new investment in the South African wine <b>market.</b> <b>Production</b> is concentrated around Cape Town, with major vineyard and production centres at Paarl, Stellenbosch and Worcester. There are about 60 appellations within the Wine of Origin (WO) system, which was implemented in 1973 with a hierarchy of designated production regions, districts and wards. WO wines must only contain grapes from the specific area of origin. [...] "Single vineyard" [...] wines must come from a defined area of less than 5 hectares. An [...] "Estate Wine" [...] can come from adjacent farms if they are farmed together and wine is produced on site. A ward is an area with a distinctive soil type or climate and is roughly equivalent to a European appellation.|$|E
2500|$|Boeing {{cited the}} 747-8F {{as the main}} driver behind {{potential}} future 747-8 orders. To help reduce production costs in the meantime and maintain the 747 production line's viability, {{the company plans to}} integrate the 747 and 767 production lines more closely with each other. Boeing expected the cargo market to improve by mid-2019 and were planning to increase the 747's production rate back to 1/month from then on. However, in July 2016, this production rate increase was cancelled, i.e. 747 production remained at 0.5 per month. At the same time, the company announced another after tax charge of $814 million, reflecting a lower estimation of frames to be produced and revenue realised. In an SEC filing submitted at the same time, Boeing stated that if they were [...] "unable to obtain sufficient orders and/or <b>market,</b> <b>production</b> and other risks cannot be mitigated, [...] it is reasonably possible that we could decide to end production of the 747." ...|$|E
