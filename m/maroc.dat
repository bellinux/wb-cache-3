5|$|In 1988 and 1989, Mouton {{participated in}} rally raids {{as part of}} Peugeot's service team for Ari Vatanen and Jacky Ickx. At the 1988 Rally of Tunisia, Mouton drove a 205 T16 Grand Raid chase car and transported spare parts for Vatanen and Henri Pescarolo, but also {{classified}} sixth overall.

5|$|The {{problems}} were only transient, however, {{and by the}} time 1984 had come to a close, Le Grand Tour du Cirque du Soleil was a success. Having only $60,000 left in the bank, Laliberté went back to the Canadian government to secure funding for a second year. While the Canadian federal government was enthusiastic, the Quebec provincial government was resistant to the idea. It was not until Quebec's premier, René Lévesque, intervened on their behalf that the provincial government relented. The original big top tent that was used during the 1984 Le Grand Tour du Cirque du Soleil tour can now be seen at Carnivàle Lune Bleue, a 1930s-style carnival that is home to the Cirque <b>Maroc</b> acrobats.|$|E

25|$|Within {{the same}} month that the last Delta jet {{departed}} Liberia, most scheduled flights, including those of British Airways, Kenya Airways, Air Côte d'Ivoire, Arik Air, and Gambia Bird were suspended due to the rapidly-spreading Ebola outbreak. Royal Air <b>Maroc</b> and Brussels Airlines both remained flying through the crisis, albeit with reduced schedules.|$|E
25|$|Edmond Destaing (1872–1940) greatly {{advanced}} {{our knowledge}} of the Shilha lexicon with his Etude sur la tachelḥît du Soûs. Vocabulaire français-berbère (1920) and his Textes berbères en parler des Chleuhs du Sous (<b>Maroc)</b> (1940, with copious lexical notes). Destaing also planned a grammar which was to complete the trilogy, but this was never published.|$|E
25|$|After {{the end of}} {{the civil}} war in 2003, {{commercial}} air service was slow to return to Liberia, and only gathered momentum after the inauguration of President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf in January 2006. Royal Air <b>Maroc</b> started flights to Mohamed V International Airport in November 2007, and Virgin Nigeria added Monrovia to its network, from Lagos via Accra twice per week, in October 2008.|$|E

Two deicing vehicles {{that were still}} in place in front of both horizontal stabilizers were knocked down, causing fatal injuries for three de-icing crew members and serious injuries to the two drivers.|$|E
25|$|The {{software}} {{has been}} criticized {{by a number of}} special interest groups, including national officials, as being an invasion of privacy or posing a threat to national security. The typical argument is that the software provides information about military or other critical installations that could be used by terrorists. Google Earth has been blocked by Google in Iran and Sudan since 2007, due to United States government export restrictions. The program has also been blocked in Morocco since 2006 by <b>Maroc</b> Telecom, a major service provider in the country.|$|E
25|$|The {{government}} {{introduced a}} series of structural reforms in recent years. The most promising reforms {{have been in the}} liberalization of the telecommunications sector. In 2001, the process continued with the privatization of 35% of the state operator <b>Maroc</b> Telecom. Morocco announced plans to sell two fixed licenses in 2002. Morocco also has liberalized rules for oil and gas exploration and has granted concessions for many public services in major cities. The tender process in Morocco is becoming increasingly transparent. Many believe, however, that the process of economic reform must be accelerated in order to reduce urban unemployment below the current rates above 20%.|$|E
25|$|Discussing {{the issue}} in Morocco has been taboo for decades. However, human rights {{organizations}} and some liberal media outlets and left-wing political parties led by the Front of Democratic Forces have been attempting to start a capital punishment debate.

The main and the newly created (2003) civil entity Coalition nationale pour l’abolition de la peine de mort au <b>Maroc</b> (CNAPM) (National coalition for the abolition of capital punishment in Morocco) which represents seven associations carrying the slogan Ensemble pour l'abolition de la peine de mort (Together against capital punishment) is also leading the debate.|$|E

The number of Moroccan internet subscribers in 2007 amounted to 526,080, representing {{an increase of}} 31.6% compared to the previous year and a 100% increase compared to 2005. The national penetration for internet subscription remains low, even though it increased from 0.38% in 2004 to 1.72% in 2007.

25|$|Morocco's {{road network}} {{effectively}} integrates the country's diverse regions. Established {{during the colonial}} period, the network has been well maintained and gradually expanded since. The railway system connects the principal urban centres of the north, and new rail links, together with improved roads, are being established to Laâyoune in Western Sahara. Morocco has some two dozen ports along its lengthy coastline. Casablanca alone accounts for {{about half of all}} port tonnage handled, although port facilities in Tangier are of increasing significance. Other major ports include Safi, Mohammedia, Agadir, Nador, Kenitra, and El Jorf Lasfar. About a dozen airports capable of accommodating large aircraft service the country; the principal international airport is located near Casablanca.

500|$|Huré died in December 1949 at Saint-Valéry-sur-Somme in France. [...] In 1952 {{a book he}} had written, La Pacification du <b>Maroc.</b> Dernière étape : 1931–1934 (The Pacification of Morocco.

500|$|Morocco blocked {{access in}} May 2007, {{possibly}} {{as a result}} of videos critical of Morocco's actions in Western Sahara. YouTube became accessible again on May 30, 2007, after <b>Maroc</b> Telecom unofficially announced that the denied access to the website was a mere [...] "technical glitch".|$|E
500|$|Huré {{returned}} to France {{to serve on}} the Supreme Council of War in 1935 and also sat on Louis Franchet d'Espèrey's African Friendship Committee, an organisation established to encourage the loyalty of North Africa to France in case of war. [...] By 1936 he was inspector general of French North African troops and in 1938 was appointed inspector general of engineers. [...] He was appointed grand cross of the Legion of Honour on 8 July 1938 and in the same year co-wrote Lyautey du Tonkin au <b>Maroc</b> par Madagascar et le Sud-Oranais (Lyautey in Tonkin and Morocco by way of Madagascar and South Oran [...] ) with British historian Sonia E.

500|$|From {{medieval times}} until around the {{beginning}} of the 20th century, the entire country of Morocco was known as the [...] "Kingdom of Marrakesh", as the kingdom's historic capital city was often Marrakesh. The name for Morocco is still [...] "Marrakesh" [...] to this day in Persian and Urdu (مراكش) as well as many other South Asian languages. Various European names for Morocco (Marruecos, Marrocos, <b>Maroc,</b> Marokko, etc.) are directly derived from the Berber word Murakush. Conversely, the city itself was in earlier times simply called Marocco City (or similar) by travelers from abroad. The name {{of the city and the}} country diverged after the Treaty of Fez divided Morocco into a French protectorate in Morocco and Spanish protectorate in Morocco, but the old interchangeable usage lasted widely until about the interregnum of Mohammed Ben Aarafa (1953–1955). The latter episode set in motion the country's return to independence, when Morocco officially became al-Mamlaka al-Maġribiyya (المملكة المغربية) ("The Maghreb Kingdom"), its name no longer referring to the city of Marrakesh. Marrakesh is known by a variety of nicknames, including the [...] "Red City", the [...] "Ochre City" [...] and [...] "the Daughter of the Desert", and has been the focus of poetic analogies such as one comparing the city to [...] "a drum that beats an African identity into the complex soul of Morocco." ...|$|E
