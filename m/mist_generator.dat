The main antagonist is Prince Cort, the son of King Nebular and Queen Minea, and Noa's older brother, who owns the evil Ra-Seru Rogue and the <b>Mist</b> <b>Generator.</b> He is assisted by Gala's rival Songi and Karisto Kingdom's female ruler Zora.|$|E
5000|$|Oil mist {{lubrication}} oils {{are applied to}} rolling element (antifriction) bearings as an oil mist. Neither oil rings nor constant level lubricators are used in pumps and drivers connected to plant-wide oil mist systems. Oil mist is an atomized amount of oil carried or suspended in a volume of pressurized dry air. The oil mist, actually a ratio of one volume of oil suspended or carried in 200,000 volumes of clean, dry air, moves in a piping system (header). The point of origin is usually a mixing valve (the oil <b>mist</b> <b>generator),</b> connected to this header. Branch lines often feed oil mist to hundreds of rolling elements in the many pumps and drivers connected to a plant-wide system.|$|E
50|$|Vahn, Noa and Gala {{set on a}} {{quest to}} revive ten Genesis Trees {{throughout}} the world {{in an attempt to}} vanquish the evil Mist and save the world. They join up with entities known as Ra-Seru, which grant them powers like Seru but are immune to the effects of the Mist. They travel across three continents, reviving the trees and remove the Mist from small areas, and destroying the Mist Generators. Later, they confront Songi. At Conkram, the heroes travel back in time to locate the origins of the Mist {{to put an end to}} it once and for all. They discover that Cort uses it as a biological weapon. They fail to save the city and Noa's parents in the past, but when they return to the present, they destroy the final <b>Mist</b> <b>Generator</b> and defeat Cort. However, before the dying Cort merges with Juggernaut, a Seru that has grown gargantuan through exposure to the Mist. Songi and the giant Seru Juggernaut devastate Rim Elm, but the heroes defeat him, travel inside the beast and defeat Cort again. With the world restored, the reincarnated Cort becomes a baby whom Noa takes care of.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{represents}} {{the results of}} the design of functional nanocrystalline powders and nanocomposites using chemical reactions in aerosols. The process involves ultrasonic aerosol formation (<b>mist</b> <b>generators</b> with the resonant frequencies of 800 kHz, 1. 7 and 2. 5 MHz) from precursor salt solutions and control over the aerosol decomposition in a high-temperature tubular flow reactor. During decomposition, the aerosol droplets undergo evaporation/drying, precipitation and thermolysis in a single-step process. Consequently, spherical, solid, agglomerate-free submicronic particles are obtained. The particle morphology, revealed as a composite structure consisting of primary crystallites smaller than 20 nm was analysed by several methods (XRD, DSC/DTA, SEM, TEM) and discussed in terms of precursor chemistry and process parameters. Following the initial attempts, a more detailed aspect of nanocrystalline particle synthesis was demonstrated for the case of nanocomposites based on ZnO-MeO (MeO=Bi Cr+), suitable for electronic applications, as well as an yttrium-aluminum base complex system, suitable for phosphorus applications. The results imply that parts of the material structure responsible for different functional behaviour appear through in situ aerosol synthesis by processes of intraparticle agglomeration, reaction and sintering in the last synthesis stage...|$|R
40|$|Where water {{conservation}} is concerned, central air-conditioning systems in commercial buildings are installed with air-cooled chillers for comfort cooling. This study examines evaporative cooling technologies for air-cooled chillers {{to improve their}} energy performance. Two common devices for cooling air intake to condensers are evaporative coolers and <b>mist</b> <b>generators.</b> Depending on weather conditions and packing materials, evaporative coolers can enhance the refrigeration effect and chiller energy performance at various degrees. Yet, different configurations and designs for air-cooled condensers call for tailor-made design of the coolers. The coolers also impose additional flow resistance to condenser air and, in turn, additional fan power. Mist generated {{in front of the}} condensers brings no flow resistance to condenser air and allows the dry bulb temperature approach closely the corresponding wet bulb temperature. The cooling effectiveness can be maximized with lesser water consumption. The benefit of evaporative cooling for air-cooled chillers is more appealing in future climate scenarios in a subtropical climate, considering the higher difference between the dry bulb and wet bulb temperatures. Integration of control and optimization strategies with mist precooling has been discussed. Department of Building Services EngineeringHong Kong Community Colleg...|$|R
40|$|AquaPym, a {{water based}} product {{containing}} synergised pyrethrins {{for use in}} the control of public health and hygiene pests. This product is highly flexible and can be applied undiluted through Ultra Low Volume (ULV) sprayers, o r can be diluted with water for use in <b>mist</b> <b>generators,</b> thermal foggers or compression sprayers for surface applications. One of the major advantages of this formulation over existing pyrethrin containing products is the extremely low mineral hydrocarbon content which makes it ideally suited for use in food handling areas and in commodity stores, such as tobacco bonds. When applied indoors as a ULV in large scale trials against a wide range of stored product and hygiene insects, the biological performance of this water-based formulation was at least equivalent and often superior to comparable oil based products. Field trials were also conducted against infestations of Bluttellu gerrnunicu. Application of water diluted product as a surface spray gave good flushout and knockdown, and rapidly achieved control, with insect numbers falling by 97 % within one day. However, due to the short persistence of pyrethrins cockroach numbers had increased to 33 %) of pre-treatment levels after 54 days. Control was maintained for over 90 days following re-treatment with AquaPy applied alongside slower acting hydramethylon gel baits. These results demonstrate how this formulation can be used in an integrated approach, making it ideal for use in insecticide sensitive locations...|$|R

40|$|Background and aim: The {{chromium}} <b>mist</b> <b>generator</b> is {{an essential}} tool for research and for making evidence-based recommendations in evaluating air pollution and its control systems. The {{purpose of this study}} was to design and construct a homogeneous chromium <b>mist</b> <b>generator</b> and to look at the effects of factors such as sampling height and distance between samplers in side-by-side sampling on the chromium mist sampling method. Material and Methods: First we developed a <b>mist</b> <b>generator,</b> using a chromium electroplating bath in pilot scale. Concentrations of CrO 3 and sulfuric acid in plating solution were 125 g L- 1 and 1. 25 g L- 1, respectively. To set up permanent air sampling locations, a Plexiglas cylindrical chamber (75 cm height, 55 cm i. d) was installed as the bath overhead. Sixty holes were made on the chamber in 3 rows (20 in each row). The distance between rows and holes was 15 and 7. 5 cm, respectively. Homogeneity and the related factors were studied using a side-by-side air sampling method. Forty-eight clusters of samples were collected on polyvinyl chloride (PVC) filters contained in sampling closed-face cassettes. Cassettes were located 35, 50, and 65 cm above the solution surface with < 7. 5 and/or 7. 5 - 15 cm distance between heads. All samples were analyzed by the NIOSH method 7600. Results: ANOVA tests showed no significant differences between locations in side-by-side sampling (P= 0. 82) or between different sampling heights or sampler distances (P= 0. 86 and 0. 86, respectively). However, there were notable differences between means of coefficients of variation (CV) in various heights and distances. Conclusion: We conclude that the most chromium mist homogeneity could be obtained at a height of 50 cm from the bath solution surface and with a distance of < 7. 5 cm between samplers...|$|E

40|$|Background The {{essential}} {{factor for}} {{diagnosis and treatment}} of diseases in head and neck endoscopy is the visibility of the image. An anti-fogging agent can reduce this problem by minimizing surface tension to prevent the condensation of water in the form of small droplets on a surface. There is no report on the use of hibiscrub ® or baby shampoo to reduce fogging in the literature. The objective {{of this study was to}} compare the efficacy between commercial anti-fogging agent, hibiscrub ® and baby shampoo to reduce fogging for the use in head and neck endoscopy. Methods The study was conducted at the Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Faculty of Medicine, Khon Kaen University in August 2010. Commercial anti-fogging agent, baby shampoo and hibiscrub ® were applied on rigid endoscope lens before putting them into a <b>mist</b> <b>generator.</b> The images were taken at baseline, 15 seconds, 30 seconds and 1 minute. The images' identifiers were removed before they were sent to two evaluators. A visual analogue scale (VAS) was used to rate the image quality from 0 to 10. Results The difference in mean VAS score between anti-fogging agent, baby shampoo and hibiscrub ® versus no agent were 5. 46, 4. 45 and 2. 1 respectively. The commercial anti-fogging agent and baby shampoo had most protective benefit and performed significantly better than no agent (P < 0. 05). Conclusions Baby shampoo is an effective agent to prevent fogging during head and neck endoscopy and compares favourably with commercial anti-fogging agent...|$|E
