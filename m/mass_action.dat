5|$|Michaelis–Menten {{kinetics}} {{relies on}} the law of <b>mass</b> <b>action,</b> which is derived from the assumptions of free diffusion and thermodynamically driven random collision. Many biochemical or cellular processes deviate significantly from these conditions, because of macromolecular crowding and constrained molecular movement. More recent, complex extensions of the model attempt to correct for these effects.|$|E
5|$|Sodium {{chromate}} {{is produced}} industrially by the oxidative roasting of chromite ore with calcium or sodium carbonate. The dominant species is therefore, {{by the law}} of <b>mass</b> <b>action,</b> determined by the pH of the solution. The change in equilibrium is visible by a change from yellow (chromate) to orange (dichromate), such as when an acid is added to a neutral solution of potassium chromate. At yet lower pH values, further condensation to more complex oxyanions of chromium is possible.|$|E
5|$|Following the Bisho massacre, {{in which}} 28 ANC {{supporters}} and one soldier were shot dead by the Ciskei Defence Force during a protest march, Mandela realised that <b>mass</b> <b>action</b> was leading to further violence and resumed negotiations in September. He {{agreed to do}} so on the conditions that all political prisoners be released, that Zulu traditional weapons be banned, and that Zulu hostels would be fenced off, the latter two measures intended to prevent further Inkatha attacks; de Klerk reluctantly agreed. The negotiations agreed that a multiracial general election would be held, resulting in a five-year coalition {{government of national unity}} and a constitutional assembly that gave the National Party continuing influence. The ANC also conceded to safeguarding the jobs of white civil servants; such concessions brought fierce internal criticism. The duo agreed on an interim constitution based on a liberal democratic model, guaranteeing separation of powers, creating a constitutional court, and including a US-style bill of rights; it also divided the country into nine provinces, each with its own premier and civil service, a concession between de Klerk's desire for federalism and Mandela's for unitary government.|$|E

25|$|The {{first step}} in the {{derivation}} applies the law of <b>mass</b> <b>action,</b> which is reliant on free diffusion. However, in the environment of a living cell where there is a high concentration of proteins, the cytoplasm often behaves more like a gel than a liquid, limiting molecular movements and altering reaction rates. Although the law of <b>mass</b> <b>action</b> can be valid in heterogeneous environments, it is more appropriate to model the cytoplasm as a fractal, in order to capture its limited-mobility kinetics.|$|E
25|$|For many {{systems of}} {{physical}} and chemical kinetics, detailed balance provides sufficient conditions for the strict increase of entropy in isolated systems. For example, the famous Boltzmann H-theorem states that, according to the Boltzmann equation, the principle of detailed balance implies positivity of entropy production. The Boltzmann formula (1872) for entropy production in rarefied gas kinetics with detailed balance served as a prototype of many similar formulas for dissipation in <b>mass</b> <b>action</b> kinetics and generalized <b>mass</b> <b>action</b> kinetics with detailed balance.|$|E

This is possible because a kinetic law is known and relations between the rates of the elementary processes at equilibrium can be transformed into relations between kinetic constants which are used globally. For the Wegscheider conditions this kinetic law is the law of <b>mass</b> <b>action</b> (or the generalized law of <b>mass</b> <b>action).</b>|$|E

25|$|Because mass actions operate {{outside the}} {{detailed}} procedures {{laid out for}} class actions, they can pose special difficulties for both plaintiffs, defendants, and the court. For example, settlement of class actions follows a predictable path of negotiation with class counsel and representatives, court scrutiny, and notice. There {{may not be a}} way to uniformly settle all of the many claims brought via a <b>mass</b> <b>action.</b> Some states permit plaintiff's counsel to settle for all the <b>mass</b> <b>action</b> plaintiffs according to a majority vote, for example. Other states, such as New Jersey, require each plaintiff to approve the settlement of that plaintiff's own individual claims.|$|E

He called this <b>mass</b> <b>action</b> and he believed that it was a general rule that governed how brain tissue would respond, independent of the type of learning. But we know now that <b>mass</b> <b>action</b> was true for these rats, because learning to run a maze is known as complex learning and it requires multiple cortical areas, so cutting into individual parts alone will not erase the memory from the rats' brains, but taking large sections removes multiple cortical areas at one time and so they can forget.|$|E

25|$|In June 1988, {{after nearly}} a year of guided {{scrutiny}} from its editors, Nature published a controversial and seemingly anomalous paper detailing Dr. Jacques Benveniste and his team's work studying human basophil degranulation {{in the presence of}} extremely dilute antibody serum. In short, their paper concluded that less than a single molecule of antibody could trigger an immune response in human basophils, defying the physical law of <b>mass</b> <b>action.</b> The paper excited substantial media attention in Paris, chiefly because their research sought funding from homeopathic medicine companies. Public inquiry prompted Nature to mandate an extensive, stringent and scientifically questionable experimental replication in Benveniste's lab, through which his team's results were categorically disputed.|$|E
25|$|In two journal {{articles}} published in 1904–05, German sociologist Max Weber propounded a thesis that Reformed (i.e., Calvinist) Protestantism had engendered the character traits and values that under-girded modern capitalism. The English translation of these articles were published in book form in 1930 as The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism. Weber argued that capitalism in northern Europe evolved because the Protestant (particularly Calvinist) ethic influenced {{large numbers of people}} to engage in work in the secular world, developing their own enterprises and engaging in trade and the accumulation of wealth for investment. In other words, the Protestant work ethic was a force behind an unplanned and uncoordinated <b>mass</b> <b>action</b> that influenced the development of capitalism.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} {{speculative}} mechanisms have been advanced to counter this, {{the most widely}} discussed being water memory, though this is now considered erroneous since short-range order in water only persists for about 1 picosecond.
