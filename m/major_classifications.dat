The fundamental principle of lever mechanism is governed by the following ratio, dating back to Archimedes.|$|E
50|$|The NYSFBC {{has gone}} through two major methods of {{classification}} for the bands that participate in sponsored competitions.

50|$|Chromalveolata is a {{eukaryote}} supergroup {{present in}} a <b>major</b> <b>classification</b> of 2005, then {{regarded as one of}} the six major groups within the eukaryotes. It is a refinement of the kingdom Chromista, first proposed by Thomas Cavalier-Smith in 1981. Chromalveolata was proposed to represent the organisms descended from a single secondary endosymbiosis involving a red alga and a bikont. The plastids in these organisms are those that contain chlorophyll c.|$|R
50|$|There are two <b>major</b> <b>classifications</b> {{based on}} the {{geographical}} location {{where they can be}} found. Central Tagbanwas are found in the western and eastern coastal areas of central Palawan. They are concentrated in the municipalities of Aborlan, Quezon, and Puerto Princesa. Calamian Tagbanwa, on the other hand, are found in Baras coast, Busuanga Island, Coron Island and in some parts of El Nido. These two Tagbanwa sub-groups speak different languages and do not exactly have the same custom.|$|E
5000|$|Humberto Calzada's art can, generally, {{be divided}} into phases or categories, but not into periods. They are phases in the sense that, during a {{specific}} time he painted primarily that category of painting, though not {{to the exclusion of}} all else. But they are [...] "categories" [...] in the sense that, throughout his career, he has produced works that have characteristics of any of the different classifications or will revisit any past phase. The general <b>major</b> <b>classifications</b> are: ...|$|E
50|$|Low-cardinality {{refers to}} columns with few unique values. Low-cardinality column values are {{typically}} status flags, Boolean values, or <b>major</b> <b>classifications</b> such as gender. An {{example of a}} data table column with low-cardinality would be a CUSTOMER table with a column named NEW_CUSTOMER. This column would contain only two distinct values: Y or N, denoting whether the customer was new or not. Since {{there are only two}} possible values held in this column, its cardinality type would be referred to as low-cardinality.|$|E
50|$|Bacteria {{can enter}} the {{bloodstream}} {{in a number of}} different ways. However, for each <b>major</b> <b>classification</b> of bacteria (gram negative, gram positive, or anaerobic) there are characteristic sources or routes of entry into the bloodstream that lead to bacteremia. Causes of bacteremia can additionally be divided into healthcare-associated (acquired during the process of receiving care in a healthcare facility) or community-acquired (acquired outside of a health facility, often prior to hospitalization).|$|R

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with accelerating the flow of empty cars in a <b>major</b> <b>classification</b> railyard in North America. Due to fluctations in inbound traffic, empty cars experience long delays at the yard. Such delays can be prevented by dynamic car reassignments. We describe a procedure using a sliding time window {{in order to reduce}} the time that empty cars spend in the yard and present the associated computational results...|$|R
