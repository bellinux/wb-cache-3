25|$|A <b>multiple</b> <b>pregnancy</b> may be {{the result}} of the {{fertilization}} of a single egg that then splits to create identical fetuses, or it {{may be the}} result of the fertilization of multiple eggs that create fraternal fetuses, or it may be a combination of these two. A <b>multiple</b> <b>pregnancy</b> from a single zygote is called monozygotic, from two zygotes is called dizygotic, or from two or more zygotes is called polyzygotic.|$|E
25|$|Women with a <b>multiple</b> <b>pregnancy</b> {{are usually}} seen more {{regularly}} by midwives or doctors {{than those with}} singleton pregnancies because of the higher risks of complications. However, there is currently no {{evidence to suggest that}} specialised antenatal services produce better outcomes for mother or babies than ‘normal’ antenatal care.|$|E
25|$|The risk of {{twin birth}} can vary {{depending}} on what types of fertility treatments are used. With in vitro fertilisation (IVF), this is primarily due to the insertion of multiple embryos into the uterus. Ovarian hyperstimulation without IVF has a very high risk of multiple birth. Reversal of anovulation with clomifene (trade names including Clomid) has a relatively less but yet significant risk of <b>multiple</b> <b>pregnancy.</b>|$|E
40|$|Background. Because of {{complications}} related to <b>multiple</b> <b>pregnancies</b> after {{in vitro fertilization}} this pathology represent a real problem. Intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) may lead to higher risk in developing monozygotic pregnancies. We sought to investigate whether the <b>multiple</b> <b>pregnancies</b> after ICSI differ of those consecutive to classical in vitro fertilization (IVF) and if counseling for transfering one or at most two embryos is efficient in preventing <b>multiple</b> <b>pregnancies.</b> Methods. We analyzed retrospectively data concerning the incidence of <b>multiple</b> <b>pregnancies</b> {{before and after the}} transfer of limited number of embryos. Results. In transfering two cleaving-stage embryos (day 2) or blastocysts (day 5), when pregnancy rate is high, the incidence of <b>multiple</b> <b>pregnancies</b> is 25 and 17 %. After transfer of one blastocyst the highest the pregnancy rate and the lowest the incidence of <b>multiple</b> <b>pregnancies.</b> Conclusions. The best way to avoid <b>multiple</b> <b>pregnancies</b> consist in transferring one or at most two embryos. The monozygotic twin pregnancy we observed was consecutive to the transfer of frozen-thawed blastocyst. </p...|$|R

To identify possible risk indicators we also compared age, parity, method of conception, onset of labour and mode of delivery for <b>multiple</b> <b>pregnancies</b> using the Netherlands Perinatal Registry as reference. RESULTS: 2552 cases of severe acute maternal morbidity were reported during the two-year study period. Among 202 <b>multiple</b> <b>pregnancies</b> (8. 0 %), there were 197 twins (7. 8 %) and five triplets (0. 2 %).

40|$|Background <b>Multiple</b> <b>pregnancies</b> are an {{important}} complication of assisted reproductive technology (ART). The present study aims to indentify the risk factors for <b>multiple</b> <b>pregnancies</b> independent {{of the number of}} transferred embryos. Materials and Methods This retrospective study reviewed the medical records of patients who underwent intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) cycles in Royan Institute between October 2011 and January 2012. We entered 12 factors that affected the number of gestational sacs into the poisson regression (PR) model. Factors were obtained from two study populations-cycles with double embryo transfer (DET) and cycles that transferred three embryos (TET). We sought to determine the factors that influenced the number of gestational sacs. These factors were entered into multivariable logistic regression (MLR) to identify risk factors for <b>multiple</b> <b>pregnancies.</b> Results A total of 1000 patients referred to Royan Institute for ART during the study period. We included 606 eligible patients in this study. PR analysis demonstrated that the quality of transferred embryos and woman’s age had a significant effect on the number of observed sacs in patients who underwent ICSI with DET. There was no significant predictive variable for <b>multiple</b> <b>pregnancies</b> according to MLR analysis. Our findings demonstrated that both regression models (PR and MLR) had the same outputs. A significant relation existed between age and fertilization rate with <b>multiple</b> <b>pregnancies</b> in patients who underwent ICSI with TET. Conclusion Single embryo transfer (SET) should be considered with the remaining embryos cryopreserved to prevent <b>multiple</b> <b>pregnancies</b> in women younger than 35 years of age who undergo ICSI cycles with high fertilization rates and good or excellent quality embryos. However, further prospective studies are necessary to evaluate whether SET in women with these risk factors can significantly decrease <b>multiple</b> <b>pregnancies</b> and improve cycle outcomes...|$|R
2500|$|Today many {{multiple}} pregnancies are {{the result}} of in vitro fertilisation (IVF). In a study in 1997 of 2,173 embryo transfers performed as part of in vitro fertilisation (IVF), 34% were successfully delivered pregnancies. The overall <b>multiple</b> <b>pregnancy</b> rate was 31.3% (24.7% twins, 5.8% triplets, and [...]08% quadruplets). Because IVFs are producing more multiples, a number of efforts are being made {{to reduce the risk of}} multiple births- specifically triplets or more. Medical practitioners are doing this by limiting the number of embryos per embryo transfer to one or two. That way, the risks for the mother and fetuses are decreased.|$|E
2500|$|Pregnancy, {{also known}} as gestation, is the time during which one or more {{offspring}} develops inside a woman. A <b>multiple</b> <b>pregnancy</b> involves more than one offspring, such as with twins. Pregnancy can occur by sexual intercourse or assisted reproductive technology. Childbirth typically occurs around 40weeks from the last menstrual period (LMP). This is just over ninemonths, where each month averages 29½ days. When measured from conception it is about 38 weeks. An embryo is the developing offspring during the first eight weeks following conception, after which, the term fetus is used until birth. Symptoms of early pregnancy may include [...] missed periods, tender breasts, nausea and vomiting, hunger, and frequent urination. Pregnancy may be confirmed with a pregnancy test.|$|E
2500|$|Reasons for {{procuring}} induced abortions {{are typically}} characterized as either therapeutic or elective.

METHODS: We conducted a case-control study using population-based data from the Paris Registry of Congenital Malformations for the period 1987 - 2009 and a cohort study of congenital heart defects (EPICARD). The study population included 395 cases of TOF and 4104 malformed controls with no known associations with ART.

POPULATION: 497, 979 Danish women and 803, 019 pregnancies, 1980 - 94. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: National rates of <b>multiple</b> <b>pregnancies,</b> infant mortality, and stillbirths controlled for maternal age and parity. Special emphasis on primiparous women > or = 30 years of age, {{who are most likely}} to undergo fertility treatment. RESULTS: The national incidence of <b>multiple</b> <b>pregnancies</b> increased 1. 7 -fold during 1980 - 94, the increase primarily in 1989 - 94 and almost exclusively in primiparous women aged > or = 30 years, for whom the adjusted population based twinning rate increased 2. 7 -fold and the triplet rate 9. 1 -fold. During 1989 - 94, the adjusted yearly increase in <b>multiple</b> <b>pregnancies</b> for these women was 19 % (95 % confidence interval 16 % to 21 %) and in dizygotic twin pregnancies 25 % (21 % to 28 %).

DESIGN: A prospective cohort study between January 2002 and December 2006. SETTING: A subfertility clinic in a large regional training hospital in the Netherlands. POPULATION: A total of 1, 001 continuing pregnancies, of which 63 (6. 3 %) were multiple. METHODS: Of all pregnancies, mode of conception, outcome and type of <b>pregnancy</b> (singleton or <b>multiple)</b> were documented. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Proportions of continuing and <b>multiple</b> <b>pregnancies</b> caused by the different modes of conception. RESULTS: Of all subfertility related continuing pregnancies, 46 % were conceived spontaneously, 16 % were induced by clomiphene citrate (CC), 2. 4 % by follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and 14 % by intra-uterine insemination combined with controlled hyperstimulation (IUI/(COH)). In vitro fertilization (IVF) and its related techniques resulted in about a fifth of all continuing pregnancies (n = 212), but were responsible for more than half (n = 36) of the <b>multiple</b> <b>pregnancies.</b> Furthermore, 18 % of the <b>multiple</b> <b>pregnancies</b> were induced by IUI/(COH), 3 % by FSH, 11 % by CC, whereas about 11 % were conceived spontaneously.
