The fall of Amin's government in 1979 brought a revival of foreign development assistance to Uganda, some of which was channelled through Uganda Commercial Bank, leading to an increase in its share of <b>medium-term</b> <b>financing</b> and its loan portfolio.

The Banking Act of 1936 established a clear separation between short term and medium-to-long term financing and the major banks had opted for specializing in short-term loans and there was the institution that would deal with financing for the flotation of companies that wished to obtain a stock market listing. In addition to granting consolidated loans against certificates of deposit and savings books, Mediobanca developed its activity of placement of bonds and shares issued by Italian companies. The professionalism developed by the bank under the, some would say brilliant, guidance of Enrico Cuccia enabled it to quickly acquire a position of leadership in the field of investment banking in Italy. In the mid-1950s, Mediobanca entered into agreements with important foreign partners (Lazard Group, Berliner Händel-Gesellschaft, Lehman Brothers, Sofina) that enabled the bank to play a role on the international market and obtained a Stock Exchange listing in 1956.|$|E

40|$|In most {{developing}} countries, {{capital markets}} are relatively undeveloped and banks are often {{unable or unwilling}} to undertake term lending. And banks prefer to lend to larger, established business with well-developed balance sheets and credit histories. Operations in microenterprises and small businesses are cash-flow-oriented but rarely have organized historical financial records or the assets needed for collateral for conventional bank financing. The author explores the potential of leasing as an option to expand small businesses'access to <b>medium-term</b> <b>financing</b> for capital equipment and new technology. In a lease-financing contract, the lessor-financier retains ownership of the asset, lease payments can be tailored to fit the cash-flow generation patterns of the lessee-borrower's business, and the security deposit is smaller than the equity stake required in conventional bank financing. Different types of small businesses require different financial services. It would be worthwhile to encourage development of a range of institutions using special methods to service particular market niches. Most small businesses that generate extra income for a household or employ nonfamily members need simple access to financing to augment their working capital needs. Microfinance appropriate to their needs will feature short cycles of repayment and borrowing. Other small businesses require <b>medium-term</b> <b>financing</b> to acquire the tools and equipment needed to support production growth and expansion. For these businesses, leasing is an attractive new financing option. The author examines and compares the Bank's experience: 1) Lease financing was used to promote the development of small businesses in Pakistan, as part of a microenterprise development loan project. 2) For a Bank-supported alternative-energy project in Indonesia, a variant of lease financing [...] the hire-purchase contract [...] is being used in marketing and distribution by private distributorsof photovoltaic solar home systems. 3) Lease financing was used by Grameen Trust in Bangladesh to finance the purchase of small tools and equipment and in other countries to promote the growth of alternative energy systems.

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} financing structure and bank liquidity risk. We compare the findings between Islamic and conventional banks for the case of Malaysia. We adopt four measures to represent financing structure; namely 1) real estate financing, 2) financing concentration, 3) stability of short-term financing structure and 4) stability of <b>medium-term</b> <b>financing</b> structure. Two BASEL III liquidity risk measures are tested; namely, liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) and the net stable funding ratio (NSFR) to measure short- and long-term liquidity risk, respectively. Based on panel data regression comprising 27 conventional and 17 Islamic banks from 1994 to 2014, our findings show that real estate financing and stability of short-term financing structure for Islamic banks are positively related to both liquidity risk measures. This implies that {{an increasing number of}} real estate financing and a stable short-term financing structure may increase Islamic banks’ short- and long-term liquidity risks. However, although real estate financing does not affect conventional banks’ liquidity risks, a stable short-term financing structure and increasing financing concentration can positively influence bank long-term liquidity risk. Our findings shed light crucial policy implications for regulatory bodies and market players in the context of liquidity risk management framework as well as the need to develop a separate framework between conventional and Islamic banking institutions...|$|E

40|$|Nearly all governments {{intervene}} in housing finance markets, primarily {{for social and}} political reasons. The availability of debt finance for housing is {{a critical component of}} a housing system. Housing {{is one of the largest}} investments in an economy, often the most significant parts of a household budget, and a key barometer of social well-being. When societies urbanize and real incomes increase, housing expectations and standards also increase. But standard housing is expensive relative to household incomes or investor resources, and the degree of access to long and <b>medium-term</b> <b>financing</b> to pay for a house over time is especially important unless the state assumes that responsibility or pays for the housing asset directly. Lack of an efficient system of housing finance that includes existing and unfinished houses impedes low- and moderate-income housing markets in particular. Without access to debt finance, whether long or medium-term, households have to finance their homes from savings or family support. They must build their homes over long periods or settle for a lower quality structure, often extra-legal, which often translates to inadequate access to clean water, sanitation and community services. In addition, the absence of ready buyers means that households will not be able to sell their homes at prices that permit them to recover their investments. This inability to sell hinders thei...|$|E

TesisEn la actualidad, el sector de los Micro y Pequeñas empresas constituyen más del 80 % de la actividad económica del país, y como eje principal en la producción nacional, mueven una gran cantidad de dinero en el mercado financiero, utilizando diferentes fuentes de financiación que les proporcionan las entidades especializadas en ese sector. Existen diferentes opciones con las que cuenta las Micro y Pequeñas empresas para su financiación, en la mayoría de los casos éstas son empleadas para solventar la expansión de sus operaciones o para invertirlo en capital de trabajo. No obstante, aun se observa que los empresarios optan por reinvertir sus utilidades en el giro del negocio, ya que persiste una cierta desconfianza por adquirir préstamos, a causa de no estar informados sobre las modalidades de financiación existentes. En tal sentido, debido a la importancia del sector micro y pequeña empresa en el crecimiento y desarrollo del país, permite presentar al Leasing como una alternativa de financiación a mediano plazo que facilita adquirir activos fijos sin la necesidad de tener liquidez, optimizando el manejo financiero y tributario de los negocios. Así, cuando realice una operación de leasing, el empresario podrá registrar como gasto la depreciación del activo más los intereses financieros; así mismo podrá acelerar la depreciación de los bienes en forma lineal hasta en el plazo del contrato.

40|$|More than {{a decade}} after {{substantial}} macroeconomic reforms were initiated in many Africancountries, aggregate growth, has at best remained inconsistent in many of those reforming countries. While the reasons for poor aggregate performance vary across countries, there is substantial evidencethat in many countries, poor private sector investment response in the medium-to-long term has delayedlong term growth. The poor response {{of the private sector}} might generally be attributed to varyingfactors in different countries. Indeed, various surveys suggest that a more vigorous response from theprivate sector in many countries has been impeded by a number of institutional, structural, and financialconstraints. (See Box 1). The apparent dearth of <b>medium-term</b> <b>financing,</b> the rudimentary nature of capital markets and theweaknesses in financial intermediation in general have made it difficult for private businesses to find themeans of financing other than short term bank credit. On the other hand, the generally low profitabilityof many private firms and the low overall level of domestic savings limit the prospects for investmentfinancing from their own resources. While the obstacles to private sector development are many, the financial constraints have receivedthe most attention from both governments and donors. Throughout the 1980 s, it was fashionable toblame the financing constraints of the private sector on the inadequacies of banking systems and theirpoor perceptions of the creditworthiness of the small ventures that dominate African economies. Increasingly, however, possible solutions to the underlying factors behind the reluctance of commercialand other banks to lend to small enterprises are being sought, as more and more people begin tounderstand the problems of banks in relation to their structures and policy bottlenecks. In view of the continuing problems with finance, {{it is not surprising that}} reform of the financialsector became a major component of economic reform programmes in many countries. Reforms werenecessitated by the observation that various policy regimes shifted the allocation of investible fundsfrom the market to the government. In many countries, banking institutions simply became institutionsfor financing the budget deficit or covering operating losses incurred by parastatals. Reforms were alsomade necessary by the fact that financial repression generally hindered the development of the institutionalcapacity of financial institutions in their development of the commercial viability of their operations. As banks failed to develop the capacity for risk assessment and monitoring of optimal management of theirloan portfolio, they became uninterested in investing in information capital which is crucial for thedevelopment of financial systems. The reform of financial markets has taken the form of significant liberalization as countries shiftedfrom the ‘repressive’ regimes, characteristic of the pre-adjustment era. Governments are no longerrequired to play major roles in determining credit flows through a system of subsidies, interest rateceilings, credit allocation and direct intervention. ...|$|E

40|$|This book {{describes}} {{the history and}} current capabilities of Ethiopia’s leading industrial companies (agribusiness, manufacturing and construction), focusing on 50 key large and mid-size firms. The motivation for the study is {{to help with the}} expansion of economic capabilities in the country by first understanding where the capabilities of the existing successful companies came from. The fifty firms chosen for this study represent almost all the largest firms in their respective sectors. An early observation is that around half the leading firms in Ethiopia have emerged from the import/export (trading) sector – where the deepest and most acute knowledge of local and international market conditions is already at hand. A common and unfortunate tendency among many observers of developing economies is to see the trading sector as separate from and irrelevant to the growth of manufacturing industry. The authors find that these firms have a vital role in seeding successful manufacturing firms. A second important observation is that, among the fifty leading firms, only two can trace their origins back to a small domestic firm. The second private-sector source of Ethiopia’s leading industrial companies is foreign companies. This is likely to be an increasingly important route to future industrial growth – and the inflow of foreign direct investment (FDI) in the past decade has been increasing significantly from a very low base. Four countries are leading this phenomenon: China, India, Saudi Arabia and Italy. These FDI projects span every sector of Ethiopian industry. The authors conclude that a careful monitoring and development of FDI ventures should be a key focus of policy concern over the next decade. Another crucial issue of economic policy identified here is import substitution (i. e. developing local industry to provide substitutes for expensive imports), and the need to nurture this on a level playing field with export projects, which are tending to be given preferential treatment. Finally the authors address issues of access to <b>medium-term</b> <b>finance</b> for growth, and the availability of land for industrial use.

40|$|In Malaysia, {{the role}} of small {{businesses}} is not only recognised as a seed-bed for entrepreneurial talent, but they also act as generators for employment and anciallary to the larger industries. They tend to complement the larger firms in supplying the required intermediaries and inputs, and serving the markets that are not attractive to the larger firms.

Finance companies were only established in the 1960 s to complement the activities of commercial banks, and specialised in short- to <b>medium-term</b> business <b>finance</b> and consumer loans.

40|$|Honduras has {{for almost}} two decades embraced {{economic}} integration as a way to achieve sustained economic growth. The DR-CAFTA agreement signed in 2004 represents another step towards economic openness. The agreement generated a heated debate about the benefits and costs to the Honduran economy. Previous assessments suggest that Honduras will have a marginal aggregate benefit from DR-CAFTA. The findings from this study suggest that the agreement might actually yield a marginal loss vis-à-vis the counterfactual. Previous studies also stress the potential for large losses resulting from the agreement, particularly for some traditional and sensitive agricultural sectors. The findings from this study suggest that, in aggregate, the welfare of basic grain households will decrease only marginally as a result of DR-CAFTA. This study contributes to the existing literature by providing a new assessment of the agreement on the Honduran economy, employing a new Social accounting matrix and a dynamic computable general equilibrium model particularly developed for this study. Furthermore, this study expands the previous literature, assessing the feasibility of alternative interventions, and developing a policy proposal that could serve as a road map for future public intervention aimed at easing the transition to more competitive domestic agricultural markets.

40|$|The leasing housing {{contract}} {{intended for}} family dwelling purposes was enforced in Colombia {{for nearly a}} decade, being quite useful for developing the country economy, in particular {{for the purchase of}} home. Despite the usefulness when executing it, several conflicts have arisen, reason why it is mandatory to build a legal regulation harmonized with its philosophy, such as “Creating new long and <b>medium-term</b> home <b>financing</b> mechanisms in Colombia”. All the foregoing in order to give a wide development to the postulate set forth in article 51 of the Political Constitution of 1991 that ensures the right to access to a decent housing. Since the legal regulation of housing leasing intended to family dwelling has been scarce and keeping in mind its atypical nature, it is required to identify what are the liabilities that arise to the contracting parties, in particular to the lessee, taking into account that between him and the good given in leasing there is a tenure relation. The leasing housing contract intended for family dwelling purposes besides of being an atypical contract is also a finance nature contract for which reason the entities authorized to enter into such type of transactions impose to the lessee several clauses that might be unrelated to the holder quality of the lessee; and thus, {{could turn out to be}} abusive in the light of the Political Constitution, the law and the doctrine regarding to the protection to the consumer. In conformity with the above mentioned reality, both the legislator and the Constitutional Court have set forth the guidelines to implement the mechanisms that seek for the protection of the lessee, bearing in mind that the subject matter of the housing leasing contract intended to family dwelling falls on a human right. Therefore, it is helpful to identify which are the liabilities of the lessee that are not related to his quality as holder in order to be able to assess them and conclude that they are in conflict with the protection policies provided to the lessee...|$|R
