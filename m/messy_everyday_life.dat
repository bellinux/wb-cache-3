40|$|Despite some {{dismissal}} of the research value of its idiosyncratic materials, a substantial body of scholarly publications now uses first-phase Mass Observation papers (1937 – 50 s). An emerging body of literature also draws upon the post- 1981 papers of the Mass Observation Project. While Mass Observation’s significance as a historical source is demonstrable through its vast scale, unique holdings and acknowledged international standing, how the eclectic form and content of such materials might best be interpreted is less clear. This article provides a summary of and engagement with the issues of methodological concern to researchers using the archival materials generated by the Mass Observation Project, in particular {{at the point of}} its thirtieth anniversary, and also reflects on methods of historical interpretation more generally. Core debates considered include the complex legacies of the original organization and ongoing concern with the demographic ‘representativeness’ of the volunteer panel. The sometimes challenging form and scale of the archival material, and the always interdisciplinary nature of the project (and its researchers), lead to a range of differences in how the material is characterized, {{as well as in the}} sampling and interpretive models employed. Through an exploration of debates raised in the recent University of Brighton research network Methodological Innovation: Using Mass Observation, alongside a review of publications that reflect, methodologically, on the use and value of the Mass Observation Project, this article evaluates varied and cross-disciplinary research practices and approaches to present a defence of Mass Observation material as a unique means of accessing the difficulties and complexities of <b>messy</b> <b>everyday</b> <b>life.</b> Consisting of an impressive list of contributors, the four volumes discuss the history, development and current debates alive in the field, such as the biographical turn in social science, the theoretical underpinnings to using human documents in social research and the epistemological, substantive and practical concerns with the process of analyzing data from human documentary sources. Comprehensive, illuminating and dynamic, this collection will have appeal accross all social science disciplines, especially sociology, social psychology, criminology, politics and international relations, management and business studies, human geography, media and communication studies...|$|E

Its narrative is lively and engaging, and materials can be adapted for any level of study. Raw Life, New Hope is the stoy of one community's efforts to secure a decent life in post-apartheid South Africa. For residents of The Park, a squalid shantytown on the outskirts of Cape Town, life was hard and they described their social world as raw. Efforts {{to get on with the}} <b>messy</b> business of <b>everyday</b> <b>life</b> were often underut by cruel poverty. Despite inhospitable conditions, they sought to create respectable lives. The opportunity of formal housing fired them with enthusiasm as they saw the possibilities of living respectably with stable families, decent work, enduring social relations and the trappings of consumerism. The book traces their experiences as people struggled with sense-making in a complex world. Based on nearly two decades of research, Raw Life, New Hope examines how everyday lives are fashioned through relationships, reciprocity and language. It offers a rare glimpse into the complex and contradictory ways of life of people living on the margins of society...|$|R

This thesis studies {{different ways of}} handling <b>everyday</b> <b>life</b> in late modernity to understand where cracks of sustainability in <b>everyday</b> <b>life</b> might appear. We develop four different condensations of stories about <b>everyday</b> <b>life</b> handlings, which we term Everyday Handlings. Everyday Handlings is a concept, {{which can be used}} as a methodological tool to understand the differentiated ways that individuals explain their handlings of <b>everyday</b> <b>life</b> in late modernity. The theoretical starting point for this thesis is presented through the mobilities paradigm and a sustainability paradigm. We understand mobilities as fundamental for <b>everyday</b> <b>life</b> and social activities in late modernity and therefore that social sciences must understand the importance of mobilities to understand societies. The question of sustainability is more present than ever and we argue that sustainability must be part of social sciences because of the consequences of human behaviour such as climate changes. Through qualitative interviews with nine members of two organisations based on sharing economies, LetsGo and The Bicycle Library, we gain insight to the choices, dilemmas and paradoxes the interviewees experience on a daily basis and into their views on sustainability and mobilities and how they think about this in <b>everyday</b> <b>life.</b> We use the four condensations to understand the different ways these individuals handle the complexity of <b>everyday</b> <b>life</b> and the dilemmas concerning sustainability and mobilities. Furthermore, we discuss how economy and new forms of politics and communities of sharing economy can be seen as cracks of sustainability in <b>everyday</b> <b>life.</b> Through these stories of <b>everyday</b> <b>life</b> we find that individuals handle the specific problems they encounter in <b>everyday</b> <b>life</b> before the abstract or global problems such as climate change.

40|$|Objective: The {{objective}} {{was to create a}} new measure of <b>everyday</b> <b>life</b> functioning by developing a computerized real-life activity task where participants are asked to prepare a room for a meeting. Background: Difficulties in <b>everyday</b> <b>life</b> activities are core features of persons diagnosed with schizophrenia. However, <b>everyday</b> <b>life</b> functioning is usually evaluated with questionnaires, performance-based or observation assessments, all of which contain a number of limits. Method: Twenty-one individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia and 21 matched healthy controls completed the computerized meeting preparation task. Patients were also evaluated with an extensive cognitive battery and several measures of symptomatology and <b>everyday</b> <b>life</b> functioning. Results: Results showed that performance on the computerized task significantly differentiated patients and controls for a certain number of variables. These variables, summarized in a global score, were significantly correlated with both cognitive and <b>everyday</b> <b>life</b> functioning. Moreover, this composite score significantly predicted 39 % of <b>everyday</b> <b>life</b> functioning, whereas a cognitive composite score only predicted 22 %.

Different theoretical approaches and methods from three bodies of literature are explored, that have a bearing on the primary research question: How can the interpretation, collection, and display of <b>everyday</b> <b>life</b> through present day everyday objects be enhanced in museums and galleries? By synthesizing ideas from different bodies of literature, Material Culture Studies, <b>Everyday</b> <b>Life</b> Studies and Museum Studies, the research brings a new theoretical contribution to the way everyday mass-produced things are curated in museums. A diverse range of approaches documenting present day <b>everyday</b> <b>life</b> with objects is explored through three studies: contemporary art, contemporary collecting in museums, and an exhibition. Methods used include interviews with artists and curators and mounting an exhibition. The first study analyses the meanings and materiality of artworks revealing deeper understandings of the subjective experience of <b>everyday</b> <b>life.</b> The second study evaluates the ethnographic approach to collecting the home by Swedish museums. The third study demonstrates how cultural diversity can be displayed through clothes and personal possessions of twelve individuals, in an exhibition as 'contact zone'. The conclusions are that: documentation of present day <b>everyday</b> <b>life</b> in museums can incorporate the subjective experience of everyday life; concepts of proximity and materiality can contribute to a better understanding of everyday things, and a social history curator of contemporary life can become a bricoleur - an active, creative collector and maker of meanings about <b>everyday</b> <b>life</b> using things.

Abstract: This paper {{discusses}} the relationship between Chinese intellectual and political elites and common people, {{as well as that}} between the ideological sphere and <b>everyday</b> <b>life.</b> A brief narration of two transformations between <b>everyday</b> <b>life</b> and cultural survivals in China will {{serve as the basis for}} representing such relationships. One is the modern transformation of traditional <b>everyday</b> <b>life</b> into folklore (1840 - 1950) which was then followed by its degeneration into cultural survivals after the socialist elimination of “outdated ” folklore (1950 - 1976); the other is the postmodern transformation of the survivals first into the folklore of the peasantry and then into <b>everyday</b> <b>life</b> as public culture (since 1976). In this process, folklore also moved like a pendulum between <b>everyday</b> <b>life</b> and archives. A case study of Chinese traditional festivals which first degenerated into cultural survivals and were then revived as intangible heritage will substantiate my point of view. Based on the scrutiny of this whole process, the ultimate concern of this paper is to explore the new orientation for the development of Chinese folklore studies. Justifying the legitimacy of <b>everyday</b> <b>life</b> with the aid of postmodern ideas, folklorists in today’s China are contributing to the challenging and promising undertaking to create an <b>everyday</b> <b>life</b> with more positive significance...|$|R

40|$|The Concept of <b>everyday</b> <b>life</b> in the {{philosophy}} of Emmanuel Levinas in dialogue with Martin Heidegger By analysing <b>everyday</b> <b>life</b> with Levinas I try to reveal that the « familiar » or the « ordinary » world {{does not have to be}} considered as impersonal, as a decline or as a deficiency, but on the contrary, that such a naif situation can gain an essential status for the concept of a man as such. Confrontation between Levinas and Heidegger shows us, that the gravity of Dasein remains inside of him and for that reason the <b>everyday</b> <b>life</b> seeks to relieve, whereas what Levinas tries to do is exactly to remove from the very beginning this gravity from the subject into his dependence and responsiblity for the Other.

40|$|The {{history of}} <b>everyday</b> <b>life</b> {{constitutes}} a politically relevant research concept when the investigated micro- phenomena are affiliated with political problems, structures and processes. As political history of <b>everyday</b> <b>life,</b> it explores the cultural {{conditions of the}} generation and the everyday consequences of the implementation of general engagement within social groups. Historical-political learning can be reflected in terms of "participation", "acquisition", "mediation" and "development". While the participation and internalisation dimensions represent the pedagogic side of subject- specific didactics, the technical aspects stand in the foreground. In {{each of the four}} dimensions, history of <b>everyday</b> <b>life</b> determines various didactic functions. In the participation dimension, history of <b>everyday</b> <b>life</b> has the function of improving the learners' participation in the process of learning. It enables them to learn by experience. Through historical-political learning of history of everyday life: 	 reference can be made to the learners' living world, 	 the starting point and end of learning processes can be orientated towards the subjects, 	 learning content can be chosen under the pupils terms, 	 life stories can be made available as learning stories. In the acquisition dimension, history of <b>everyday</b> <b>life</b> has the function of directing the internalisation process with historical-political learning. The learning of history of <b>everyday</b> <b>life</b> guides the thinking processing of experiences, involving: 	 the establishment of problem situations, 	 the facilitation of thought-processes that are being discovered and researched, 	 the provision of active and project-like learning chances. In the mediation dimension, history of <b>everyday</b> <b>life</b> has the function of providing historical-political issues/content. The following perceptions can be acquired from it: 	 that power/domination/authority is based on the everyday "will to obey" and "legitimacy beliefs", 	 that resistance and conformity are built up on everyday interrelations, 	 that historical political turning points and continuities are connected with everyday moments of dissent and assent, 	 that through everyday politics, gender categories are formed and changed. In the development dimension, history of <b>everyday</b> <b>life</b> has the function of enabling the acquisition of historical- political competence in educational meaning. 	 In the learning of pre-modern history of <b>everyday</b> <b>life,</b> thought structures are acquired that legitimise autocratic or electoral democratic power/domination/authority. 	 In the learning of modern history of <b>everyday</b> <b>life,</b> thought structures are acquired that legitimate representative-democratic power/domination/authority. 	 In the learning of post-modern history of <b>everyday</b> <b>life,</b> thought structures are acquired that legitimise plebiscite-democratic power/domination/authority.
