5000|$|A {{protective}} trim for <b>mitre</b> <b>cut</b> kitchen worktops {{has been}} patented and created by Pepr products. The product {{is similar to}} aluminium trims for straight worktop joints, but shaped to fit <b>mitre</b> <b>cut</b> corner worktops.|$|E

50|$|In mitred {{sticking}}, {{the profile}} (known as the sticking) {{is applied to}} the edges of both the rail and stile and then a section of the sticking at the ends of each stile is removed leaving a mitred edge which aligns to a similar <b>mitre</b> <b>cut</b> on the ends of the sticking on each rail. This traditional method is more time consuming to complete, hence the popularity of cope and stick for manufactured items.|$|E

50|$|The Soundproof Headboard - The contestants must install {{soundproof}} panels {{the size}} of a headboard. This involves precision <b>mitre</b> <b>cuts</b> for a frame as well as fitting fibreglass panelling between the frame panelling. Everyone <b>cuts</b> the <b>mitre</b> <b>cuts</b> incorrectly, and only Rob does not have any troubles with the stapler or adhesives used to attach the framing pieces to the wall. He passes easily. Dan fails due to the panels lacking internal supports (admitting that the entire headboard must be redone on his own time), while both Matt and Ajay build their framework too large; Matt gives up after this, but Ajay is able to complete the task by cutting the fibreglass into small chunks and building a patchwork panel. Charlene falls behind again, and only has a frame up with no panelling installed when time runs out.|$|R

"In the hall, {{over the}} chimney, I find Abington arms cut in stone--namely, a patonee between four martletts; and also another escutcheon--namely, a lion rampant, and several <b>mitres</b> <b>cut</b> in stone about the house. There {{is also in}} the said house a chamber called Dudley's chamber, where the Earl of Leicester's wife was murdered, of which this is the story following:-- ...|$|R
50|$|Pipe cutting, or pipe profiling, is a {{mechanized}} {{industrial process}} that removes material from pipe or tube {{to create a}} desired profile. Typical profiles include straight <b>cuts,</b> <b>mitres,</b> saddles and midsection holes. These complex cuts are usually required to allow a tight fit between two parts {{that are to be}} joined via arc welding.|$|R
50|$|The {{most common}} form of a mitre box is a 3-sided box which is open at the top and the ends. The box is made wide enough to {{accommodate}} the width of the boards to be cut. Slots are cut in the walls of the box at the precise angle at which the cut is to be made. These slots provide the guide for the saw to follow. Most commonly, the slots in the <b>mitre</b> box are <b>cut</b> at 45 degrees and 90 degrees.|$|R
