50|$|Low {{specific}} thrust {{is achieved by}} replacing the <b>multi-stage</b> <b>fan</b> with a single-stage unit. Unlike some military engines, modern civil turbofans {{do not have any}} stationary inlet guide vanes in front of the fan rotor. The fan is scaled to achieve the desired net thrust.|$|E
50|$|A high-specific-thrust/low-bypass-ratio {{turbofan}} normally has a <b>multi-stage</b> <b>fan,</b> {{developing a}} relatively high pressure ratio and, thus, yielding a high (mixed or cold) exhaust velocity. The core airflow needs to {{be large enough to}} give sufficient core power to drive the fan. A smaller core flow/higher bypass ratio cycle can be achieved by raising the (HP) turbine rotor inlet temperature.|$|E
50|$|A {{turborocket}} {{is a type}} {{of aircraft}} engine combining elements of a jet engine and a rocket. It typically comprises a <b>multi-stage</b> <b>fan</b> driven by a turbine, which is driven by the hot gases exhausting from a series of small rocket-like motors mounted around the turbine inlet. The turbine exhaust gases mix with the fan discharge air, and combust with the air from the compressor before exhausting through a convergent-divergent propelling nozzle.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the most}} unusual {{features}} of this military engine is the single stage fan; most trainer and combat engines have <b>multi-staged</b> <b>fans,</b> single stage fans normally being the preserve of civil and military transport turbofans. Ivchenko Lotarev chose a very low specific thrust (net thrust/airflow) cycle for the DV-2, so a single stage fan is sufficient to develop the desired fan pressure ratio. Even so, the pressure ratio produced is somewhat higher than that normally developed by a single stage fan. Owing to the low specific thrust, the bypass ratio for the engine is higher than normal for a military turbofan.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. A novel fully {{integrated}} dynamic thermal management circuit for system-on-chip design is proposed. Instead of worst-case thermal management used in conventional systems, this design yields continual monitoring of thermal activity and reacts to specified conditions. With the above system, {{we are able}} to incorporate on-chip power/speed modulation and integrated <b>multi-stage</b> <b>fan</b> controllers, which allows us to achieve nominal power dissipation and ensure operation within specification. Both architecture and circuitry are optimized for modern system-on-chip designs. This design yields intricate control and optimal mangement with little system overhead and minimum hardware requirements, as well as provides the flexibility to support different thermal mangement algorithms.

40|$|A systems {{analysis}} was performed with experimental jet noise data, engine/aircraft performance codes and aircraft noise prediction codes to assess takeoff noise levels and mission range for conceptual supersonic commercial aircraft. A parametric study was done to identify viable engine cycles that meet NASAs N+ 2 goals for noise and performance. Model scale data from offset jets was used as input to the aircraft noise prediction code to determine the expected sound levels for the lateral certification point where jet noise dominates over all other noise sources. The noise predictions {{were used to determine}} the optimal orientation of the offset nozzles to minimize the noise at the lateral microphone location. An alternative takeoff procedure called programmed lapse rate was evaluated for noise reduction benefits. Results show {{there are two types of}} engines that provide acceptable range performance; one is a standard mixed-flow turbofan with a single-stage fan, and the other is a three-stream variable-cycle engine with a <b>multi-stage</b> <b>fan.</b> The engine with a single-stage fan has a lower specific thrust and is 8 to 10 EPNdB quieter for takeoff. Offset nozzles reduce the noise directed toward the thicker side of the outer flow stream, but have less benefit as the core nozzle pressure ratio is reduced and the bypass-to-core area ratio increases. At the systems level for a three-engine N+ 2 aircraft with full throttle takeoff, there is a 1. 4 EPNdB margin to Chapter 3 noise regulations predicted for the lateral certification point (assuming jet noise dominates). With a 10 reduction in thrust just after takeoff rotation, the margin increases to 5. 5 EPNdB. Margins to Chapter 4 and Chapter 14 levels will depend on the cumulative split between the three certification points, but it appears that low specific thrust engines with a 10 reduction in thrust (programmed lapse rate) can come close to meeting Chapter 14 noise levels. Further noise reduction is possible with additional reduction in takeoff thrust using programmed lapse rate, but studies are needed to investigate the practical limits for safety and takeoff regulations...|$|E
