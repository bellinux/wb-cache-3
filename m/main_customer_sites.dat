40|$|Abstract: This article {{reports about}} {{investigations}} on a transport scheduling scenario. The generated schedule requires a repeated revision {{in order to}} incorporate additionally released requests. Neither the release time nor {{the location of the}} associated <b>customer</b> <b>site</b> can be forecasted. Special attention is paid to keep the generated schedules stable, which means that once made scheduling decisions should be maintained (announced arrival times at <b>customer</b> <b>sites,</b> etc.) Initially, several measures for the nervousness degree are proposed. In computational simulations it turns out that a very high nervousness degree appears if the same schedule update strategies are applied for different workloads. As a remedy, the adaptation of the used schedule update strategy to the current schedule performance is proposed. A prototypic algorithm framework is presented and assessed is comprehensive numerical simulation experiments. The adaptation of the schedule update strategies contributes to a significant reduction of some observed nervousness degrees. It reinforces the preservation of once fixed arrival times at <b>customer</b> <b>sites...</b>|$|R

40|$|Web-based IT {{systems have}} become very popular among {{corporations}} being a strategic part of their business approach. However, the success of web-based IT systems is very dependent on the performance at the customer end. Today, IT departments {{are responsible for the}} performance and the availability of their web-based business applications. They often receive complaints about the performance degradation of these applications at <b>customer</b> <b>sites,</b> thus IT departments need to provide answers with evidence to their customer why they are experiencing bad performance. In order to answer their customers, they need a very quick and easy way to determine the possible causes of the performance degradation at <b>customer</b> <b>sites.</b> To do this, they must first identify in which part of the end-to-end client-server communication the problem lies. The main focus of this thesis is {{to address the problem of}} performance degradation that is experienced by web-based IT systems at <b>customer</b> <b>sites,</b> by identifying the part of the end-to-end client-server communication in which the problem might exist. In this study, we propose a model that aims to measure response time for different web servers by generating simple web requests and then to provide statistical analysis to identify whether the problem lies in Local Area Network (LAN) at the <b>customer</b> <b>site,</b> Wide Area Network (WAN) or LAN at the server site. The proposed model is based on findings from the literature review and interviews in the IT industry. We have performed a case study at Volvo IT in order to validate the usability and practicality of the proposed model. The results of the case study provide a way to quickly identify the part of the end-to-end client-server communication where the problem lies. The results of the case study also reveal the possibility of determining the LAN status at <b>customer</b> <b>sites</b> of the web-based IT systems...|$|R
