25|$|The Tokyo Conference on Afghanistan, held on 8 July 2012 was the civilian-diplomatic bookend to NATO’s 2012 May {{summit in}} Chicago, where the {{alliance}} confirmed plans to withdraw foreign combat troops {{by the end}} of 2014 and pledged about $4 billion a year to pay for ongoing training, equipment and financial support for Afghanistan’s security forces. In exchange for pledges from the Afghan government to combat corruption $16 billion {{over the next four years}} for civilian projects such as roads to schools or projects aimed to strengthen the rule of law were pledged by the some 70 nations attending the conference. The reconstruction and development aid was pledged for the timeframe through 2015, but under the condition that the Afghan government reduce corruption before receiving all of the money. In the so-called Tokyo Framework of <b>Mutual</b> <b>Accountability</b> foreign governments will assure Afghanistan a steady stream of financing in exchange for stronger anticorruption measures and the establishment of the rule of law. Up to 20 percent of the money would depend on the government meeting governance standards according to the Tokyo Framework of <b>Mutual</b> <b>Accountability.</b>|$|E

Some users {{who belong to}} same {{service provider}} {{do not want to}} reveal their identities while using some privacy-related services such as location information, printing, browsing web pages, etc. In addition, we should consider lightweight cryptographic protocols because UCE can be constructed by lots of resource and energy constrained devices. In this paper we propose a lightweight privacy-preserving authentication and access control scheme for UCE. Compared to the previous schemes [13, 14], our proposed scheme which was designed {{to reduce the number of}} public key operations and to improve non-linkability feature is found to be more secure and requires less memory on the user’s device. Moreover the proposed scheme provides <b>mutual</b> authentication, <b>accountability</b> and differentiated access control. ...|$|R

40|$|In this article, {{we study}} which {{institutional}} factors shape citizens’ {{views of the}} local accountability of their public officials. Our departing assumption is that evaluations of local accountability do not merely reflect citizens’ poltical attitudes and beliefs, but also whether local institutions contribute to an environment of <b>mutual</b> trust, <b>accountability</b> and ultimately democratic legitimacy. Combining public opinion data from a large-N citizen survey (N= 10, 651) with contextual information for 63 local governments in Ethiopia, we look at access to information, participatory planning and the publicness of basic services as potential predictors of citizens’ evaluations of local public officials. Our findings suggest that local context matters. Jurisdictions that provide access to information on political decision-making are perceived to have more accountable officials. Moreover, when local governments provide public fora that facilitate citizens’ stakes in local planning processes, it positively affects citizens’ evaluations of the accountability of their officials. Our study adds to the empirical literatrure by showing that establishing local institutions that can foster citizen-government relations {{at the local level}} through inclusive processes is crucial for improving public perceptions of accountability...|$|R

5000|$|Transparency can {{be defined}} as a basic {{expression}} of <b>mutual</b> <b>accountability.</b> <b>Mutual</b> <b>accountability</b> can only work if there is a global culture of transparency that demands provision of information through a set of rules and behavioral norms, which are difficult to enforce in the case of official development cooperation. In particular for emerging economy donors and private development assistance, these norms are only at a nascent stage. Kharas suggest to adopt the [...] "regulation through information" [...] approach, which as been developed and has proven its effectiveness {{in the case of the}} European integration. In fact, at the international level, when the enforcement of mandatory rules is difficult, the solution could be to provide and make available transparent, relevant, accurate and reliable information, which can be used to reward or sanction individual aid agencies according to their performances. This means establishing a strong culture of accountability within aid, which rewards aid successes but penalizes failures.|$|E

30|$|The {{study also}} affirmed that {{financial}} services {{are vital to}} the growth of women entrepreneurs’ businesses. However, the study revealed that a number of huddles barred women entrepreneurs from getting access to financial services. The study found out, for example, that rigid eligibility criteria in accessing financial services, which include having a registered business, trading license, and business plans make the process of acquiring finance stressful (see also Okuruf & Ama, 2013; Magesa et al., 2013). The study found that most women entrepreneurs women were not entitled to assets that could be used as collaterals because of strong cultural norms (Magesa et al., 2013; Ascher, 2012). Nevertheless, the study noted a number of initiatives by the government to ensure equal ownership of the property at the household level. All the same, the analysis suggests that more effort is still needed to enforce the initiatives and financial institutions to reduce conditions of lending in order allow more women to access financial services. Moreover, the study sees the need to reverse conservative banking practice by replacing collateral with <b>mutual</b> trust, <b>accountability,</b> participation, and creativity (see, Kumar et al., 2013).|$|R
40|$|Most {{frameworks}} for ‘Corporate Social Responsibility’ posit stakeholder dialogue as essential tool for firms {{to be in}} touch with society’s needs and expectations. Successful and sustained dialogue requires integrity and some degree of <b>mutual</b> understanding and <b>accountability.</b> This case describes a situation in which achieving mutual understanding between a firm and environmental groups was not possible. Radical innovation led to re-organization, and this process undermined the firm’s integrity in that period. Moreover, not all environmental groups successful in influencing public opinion can claim the necessary integrity for such dialogue. Second, corporate and environmental groups used disparate modes of cognition, relying on different principles for establishing and verifying truth. In instances where a group’s identity and strategic objectives are deeply linked to just one mode of thought, self-reflection and understanding of the other may be too difficult. Dialogue with ‘translators’ may then be one option...|$|R
30|$|It was {{observed}} that women entrepreneurs acquired their initial capital for starting a business from various financial institutions. The {{majority of the}} participants obtained their capital from official financial institutions while few of them did so from individual sources. This is a new and interesting perspective related to women entrepreneurs in the food processing business as previous literature has pointed out that women SMEs from rural areas “fear to face FIs (financial institutions) for loans” (Majenga and Mashenene 2015). Servings and Credits Corporative Society (SACCOS) and local banks provided loans to women entrepreneurs upon submission of business plans and their security. During the focus group discussions, women entrepreneurs pointed out that “we get a small amount of loans as we were limited by the financial capacity to borrow more from the financial institutions”. The collateral for women who are doing business in a group was their contributions in terms of shares, while individual women entrepreneurs had to surrender some of their fixed properties like a piece of land, house or animals, although this has to be approved by the Village Executive Officer (VEO) or any other leaders authorized by the village. This is contrary to previously reported work as in the study of Kumar et al. (2013) who reported that a Grameen bank in Bangladesh had reverse conservative banking practice by removing the need for collateral and created a banking system based on <b>mutual</b> trust, <b>accountability,</b> participation and creativity.|$|R

40|$|The {{research}} project measured {{the influence of}} lean culture elements as well as power distance elements {{on the success of}} lean manufacturing implementations. The literature review revealed that lean transformations are not always successful and sustainable since organisation see these as quick win opportunities to improve short term profits. Lean, however, is a long term philosophy that entails not just quick changes but a fundamental change in the way that business is done. The elements that were measured in the study were organisational awareness, employee engagement, managerial consistency, <b>accountability,</b> <b>mutual</b> respect and autocratic behaviour. The study revealed a strong relationship between these factors and the success of lean implementations. The results indicated that there is a positive relationship between lean culture and the other lean elements. The study also indicated that autocratic behaviour has a positive relationship to lean implementation. The study showed that tools that were developed in the past are valid across various industries and that power distance does play a role in lean implementations...|$|R
40|$|Today’s {{computers}} {{become increasingly}} social tools. Beyond {{the field of}} computer-supported cooperative work (CSCW), they have advanced to means supporting social interaction. Socially Translucent Systems are an approach to designing these tools, which visualize the presence and social activity of users to generate <b>mutual</b> awareness and <b>accountability.</b> Thus they try to transfer typically social phenomena to digital systems (Erickson et al., 2002). To create awareness, plenty of information is needed. However, {{on the one hand}} the amount of incoming information originating from the activities of others is overwhelming. On the other hand privacy concerns demand for regulations regarding the information being sent to others. This situation is usually referred to as the dual tradeoff between awareness and disturbance and awareness and privacy (Hudson and Smith, 1996 : 248). An instance managing awareness information seems to be an obvious need to reduce disturbance and to regard privacy concerns in these digital systems. However, existing solutions in the field of CSCW rather focus on efficient event distribution, information overload, and the system’s performance and scalability. Other areas considering privacy issues (e. g. identity management) lack...|$|R
