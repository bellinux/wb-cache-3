The game marked career-high scoring efforts by Dawkins (31) and Chatman (13), career-high assist efforts by Bielfeldt (3) and Albrecht (9) and a career-high rebounding effort by Bielfeldt (13).

40|$|A {{design of}} {{experiments}} approach was used to describe process parameter—spray pattern relationships in the Twin Wire Arc process using zinc feed stock in a TAFA 8835 (Praxair, Concord, NH, USA) spray torch. Specifically, the effects of arc current, primary atomizing gas pressure, and secondary atomizing gas pressure on spray pattern size, spray pattern flatness, spray pattern eccentricity, and coating deposition rate were investigated. Process relationships were investigated {{with the intent of}} maximizing or minimizing each coating property. It was determined that spray pattern area was <b>most</b> affected <b>by</b> primary gas pressure and secondary gas pressure. Pattern eccentricity was <b>most</b> affected <b>by</b> secondary gas pressure. Pattern flatness was <b>most</b> affected <b>by</b> primary gas pressure.

5|$|A {{number of}} English players and {{commentators}} noted Bradman's discomfort in playing the short, rising delivery. The revelation {{came too late}} for this particular match, but was to have immense significance in the next Ashes series. Australia won the match by an innings and regained the Ashes. The victory made an impact in Australia. With the economy sliding toward depression and unemployment rapidly rising, the country found solace in sporting triumph. The story of a self-taught 22-year-old from the bush who set a series of records against the old rival made Bradman a national hero. The statistics Bradman achieved on the tour, and in the Test matches in particular, broke records {{for the day and}} some have stood the test of time. In all, Bradman scored 974runs at an average of 139.14 during the Test series, with four centuries, including two double hundreds and a triple. As of 2012, no-one has matched or exceeded 974runs or three double centuries in one Test series; the record of 974runs exceeds the second-best performance by 69runs and was achieved in two fewer innings. Bradman's first-class tally, 2,960runs (at an average of 98.66 with 10centuries), was another enduring record: the <b>most</b> <b>by</b> any overseas batsman on a tour of England.|$|E
