Using first-principles methods we investigate the point defect thermodynamics and phase segregation in the technologically-important metastable alloy GaAsBi. Our calculations predict defect energy levels in good agreement with abundant previous experiments and clarify the defect structures {{giving rise to}} these levels. We find that vacancies in some charge states become metastable or unstable with respect to antisite formation, and this instability is a general characteristic of zincblende semiconductors with small ionicity. The dominant point defects degrading electronical and optical performances are predicted to be As$_G$$_a$, Bi$_G$$_a$, Bi$_G$$_a$+Bi$_A$$_s$, As$_G$$_a$+Bi$_A$$_s$, V$_G$$_a$ and V$_G$$_a$+Bi$_A$$_s$, of which the first-four and second-two defects are minority-electron and minority-hole traps, respectively. V$_G$$_a$ is also found to {{play a critical role}} in controlling the metastable Bi supersaturation through mediating Bi diffusion and clustering.

40|$|In {{this paper}} heavy negative-ion sources which we {{developed}} and their applications for materials science are reviewed. Heavy negative ions can be effectively {{produced by the}} ejection of a sputtered atom through the optimally cesiated surface of target with a low work function. Then, enough continuous negative-ion currents for materials-science applications can be obtained. We developed several kinds of sputter-type heavy negative-ion sources such as neutral- and ionized-alkaline metal bombardment-type heavy negative-ion source and rf-plasma sputter type. In the case where a negative ion is irradiated on a material surface, surface charging seldom takes place because incoming negative charge of the negative ion is well balanced with outgoing negative charge of the released secondary electron. In the negative-ion implantation into an insulator or insulated conductive material, high precision implantation processing with charge-up free properties can be achieved. Negative-ion implantation technique, therefore, {{can be applied to}} the following novel material processing systems: the surface modification of micrometer-sized powders, the nanoparticle formation in an insulator for the quantum devices, and the nerve cell growth manipulation by precise control of the biocompatibility of polymer surface. When a negative ion with low kinetic energy approaches the solid surface, the kinetic energy causes the interatomic bonding (kinetic bonding), and formation of a <b>metastable</b> <b>material</b> is promoted.

Metastable materials represent a new frontier for studies, since even simple binary non ground state compounds of common elements may be awaiting discovery. However, there are significant research challenges related to non-equilibrium thin film synthesis and crystal structure predictions, such as small strained crystals in the experimental samples and energy minimization based theoretical algorithms. Here we report on experimental synthesis and characterization, as well as theoretical first-principles calculations of a previously unreported mixed-valent binary tin nitride. Thin film experiments indicate that this novel material is N-deficient SnN with tin in the mixed II/IV valence state and a small low-symmetry unit cell. Theoretical calculations suggest that the most likely crystal structure has the space group 2 (SG 2) related to the distorted delafossite (SG 166), which is nearly 0. 1 eV/atom above the ground state SnN polymorph.

40|$|International audienceLaser {{ablation}} in liquids is now {{commonly used}} to produce colloidal nanoparticles (NPs) that have found numerous applications in different areas. In the experiments, NPs of different materials can be rather easily produced by using laser systems with various pulse durations, shape, wavelengths, and fluence. Here, we focus our attention on metal (gold) nanoparticles produced by ultra-short laser pulses due to their unique plasmonic properties. To better understand the mechanisms of the NPs formation, we perform modeling of ultra-short laser interactions with gold target {{in the presence of}} a liquid (water). The model is similar to that presented in Ref. [1]. In the model, we vary laser fluence. Simulation results show that for smaller laser fluence, gold target is heated to moderate temperatures, so that metastable melted layer is then fragmented into particles (Fig. 1 a). In addition, a shock wave, a void/bubble is formed in front of the target [2], so that the particles are ejected into the bubble. They rapidly reach the bubble's front, and all the ablated material can be found near the border of the bubble by ~ 3 - 4 ns. For larger laser fluences (Fig. 1 b), meta-stable liquid decomposes in the vicinity of the critical point forming liquid-gas mixture. The enhanced ablation creates much higher pressure. The bubble is also formed but is rapidly stopped by the hot liquid-gas phase (at ~ 3 ns after the pulse). At that time, the ablated material is composed of two zone, liquid-gas and liquid, which are then compressed and pushed back. The bubble collapses as soon as at ~ 7. 5 ns due to strong backpressure from the liquid. As a result of the interaction with the ablated material, the target is re-heated and is melted down to as deep as ~ 0. 5 µm under initial target's surface. Thus, the obtained results demonstrate that {{in the presence of a}} liquid, the fragmentation of <b>metastable</b> <b>material</b> leads to the NPs ejection. At moderate fluences, liquid just limits material expansion. At larger fluences, liquid pushes the ablated material back enhancing target's temperature, so that more NPs can later originate from this region...|$|E

40|$|In {{science and}} {{technology}} there is a steadily increased demand of new materials and new materials production processes since they create new application areas as well as improved production technology and economy. This thesis includes development and studies of a chemical vapour deposition (CVD) process for growth of thin films of the <b>metastable</b> <b>material</b> copper nitride, Cu 3 N, which is a semiconductor and decomposes at around 300 oC. The combination of these properties opens {{for a variety of}} applications ranging from solar cells to sensor and information technology. The CVD process developed is based on a metal-organic compound copper hexafluoroacetylacetonate, Cu(hfac) 2, ammonia and water and was working at about 300 oC and  5 Torr. It was found that a small amount of water in the vapour increased the growth rate considerably and that the phase content, film texture, chemical composition and morphology were strongly dependent on the deposition conditions. In-situ oxygen doping during the CVD of Cu 3 N to an amount of 9 atomic % could also be accomplished by increasing the water concentration in the vapour. Oxygen doping increases the band gap of the material as well as the electrical resistivity and changes the stability. The crystal structure of Cu 3 N is very open and contains several sites which can be used for doping. Different spectroscopic techniques like X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy and near edge X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy were used to identify the oxygen doping site(s) in Cu 3 N. Besides the properties, the oxygen doping also affected the morphology and texture of the films. By combining thin layers of different materials several properties can be optimized at the same time. It has been demonstrated in this thesis that multilayers, composed of alternating Cu 3 N and Cu 2 O layers, i. e. a metastable and a stable material, could be grown by CVD technique. However, the stacking sequence affected the texture, morphology and chemical composition. The interfaces between the different layers were sharp and no signs of decomposition of the initially deposited metastable Cu 3 N layer could be detected...|$|E
40|$|Disordered {{multicomponent}} nitride {{thin film}} {{can be used}} for various applications. The focus of this Licentiate Thesis lies on the theoretical study of piezoelectric properties, phase stability and surface diffusion in multifunctional hard coating nitrides using density functional theory (DFT). Piezoelectric thin films show great promise for microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), such as surface acoustic wave resonators or energy harvesters. One of the main benefits of nitride based piezoelectric devices is the much higher thermal stability compared to the commonly used lead zirconate titanate (PZT) based materials. This makes the nitride based material more suitable for application in, e. g., jet engines. The discovery that alloying AlN with ScN can increase the piezoelectric response more than 500 % due to a phase competition between the wurtzite phase in AlN and the hexagonal phase in ScN, provides a fundamental basis for constructing highly responsive piezoelectric thin films. This approach was utilized on the neighboring nitride binaries, where ScN or YN was alloyed with AlN, GaN, or InN. It established the general role of volume matching the binaries to easily achieve a structural instability in order to obtain a maximum increase of the piezoelectric response. For Sc 0. 5 Ga 0. 5 N this increase is more than 900 %, compared to GaN. Y 1 -xInxN is, however, the most promising alloy with the highest resulting piezoelectric response seconded only by Sc 0. 5 Al 0. 5 N. Phase stability and lattice parameters (stress-strain states) of the Y 1 -xAlxN alloy have been calculated in combination with experimental synthesis. Hard protective coatings based on nitride thin films have been used in industrial applications for a long time. Two of the most successful coatings are TiN and the metastable Ti 1 -xAlxN. Although these two materials have been extensively investigated both experimentally and theoretically, at the atomic level little is known about Ti 1 -xAlxN diffusion properties. This is in large part due to problems with configurational disorder in the alloy, because Ti and Al atoms are placed randomly at cation positions in the lattice, considerably increasing the complexity of the problem. To deal with this issues, we have used special quasi-random structure (SQS) models, as well as studying dilute concentrations of Al. One of the most important mechanisms related to the growth of Ti 1 -xAlxN is surface diffusion. Because Ti 1 -xAlxN is a <b>metastable</b> <b>material</b> it has to be grown as a thin film with methods such as physical vapor deposition (PVD), in which surface diffusion plays a pivotal role in determining the microstructure evolution of the film. In this work, the surface energetics and mobility of Ti and Al adatoms on a disordered Ti 0. 5 Al 0. 5 N(001) surface are studied. Also the effects on the adatom energetics of Ti, Al, and N by the substitution of one Ti with an Al surface atom in TiN(001), TiN(011), and TiN(111) surfaces is studied. This provides an indepth atomistic understanding of how the energetics behind surface diffusion changes as TiN transitions into Ti 0. 5 Al 0. 5 N. The investigations revealed many interesting results. i) That Ti adatom mobilities are dramatically reduced on the TiN and Ti 0. 5 Al 0. 5 N(001) surfaces while Al adatoms are largely unaffected. ii) The reverse effect is found on the TiN(111) surface, Al adatom migration is reduced while Ti adatom migration is unaffected. iii) The magnetic spin polarization of Ti adatoms is shown to have an important effect on binding energies and diffusion path, e. g., the adsorption energy at bulk sites is increased by 0. 14 eV...|$|E
40|$|Whilst much {{research}} effort {{was spent on}} optimisation of catalyst performance, less attention has been drawn to problems concerning catalyst preparation. It is commonly known that catalyst research is facing two problems: the Materials gap and the Pressure gap. The “Materials gap” describes the discrepancy between commercial catalyst material that is often too complex to be successfully characterised and (single crystal) model catalysts that are often not able to achieve good product rates. The “Pressure gap” addresses the problem that surface investigations are commonly performed under UHV conditions whereas commercial processes are carried out at ambient or high pressure. As a consequence information of reaction mechanisms or the “real structure” under reaction conditions is very limited. Although catalysis experiments on single crystals led to new information about catalyst behaviour, it is now commonly believed that the main catalytic processes happen on centres with a high- but often unidentified- number of defects. A major task for catalyst preparation is therefore to produce highly defective <b>metastable</b> <b>material.</b> New syntheses have to be developed that fulfil many more requirements such as to ensure high reproducibility and products easy to characterise. Whilst the former {{can be achieved by}} monitoring each reaction step in-situ, the latter is taken care of by preparing thin films on a substrate. These new preparation methods will be demonstrated on the example of MoVW supported catalysts, which are used in industry for the synthesis of acrylic acid [1 - 5]. Despite this industrial importance, there is still a lack of information concerning structure formation during synthesis and the atomic arrangements with respect to different preparation routes and element ratios. Earlier work [6 - 9] showed a significant increase in selectivity for partial oxidation products {{in the presence of a}} Mo 5 O 14 type structure. This structure, which was first identified by Kihlborg et. al. [10], is built up by pentagonal bipyramids and octahedrally coordinated metal centres [Figure 1]. It is metastable until crystallisation and oxidative decomposition into binary oxide phases occurs under high oxygen partial pressure (air and above). The element ratio is (Mo 0. 68 V 0. 23 W 0. 09) 5 O 14. At the same time binary molybdenum based oxides doped with different elements such as Nb, W and Ta have been synthesised and their structure was identified as that of the Mo 5 O 14 -type [11, 12]. These phases were found to be stable at a wide temperature range. For the synthesis of this oxide, solutions of ammonium heptamolybdate, ammonium metatungstate, and vanadyl oxalate were spray-dried and subsequently calcined in air and helium. The Mo 5 O 14 structure is an idealised endpoint that is formed under reduced oxygen partial pressure during the organisation process of a mixture of oligo anions, which are generated in solution. It is therefore necessary to characterise not only the structure itself but also the full preparation process with all intermediates. It seems plausible that different thermal treatments of the precursor solutions affect a) the composition of the usually mixed phase catalysts and b) the crystallite sizes of the different constituting phases. Thus, the understanding of the aqueous precursor chemistry is required to control the preparation of such mixed oxide catalysts. Furthermore, subsequent drying and activation procedures from the liquid precursor to the active and selective catalyst are of paramount importance for the development of the optimal catalytic performance. A preparation that is based on understanding of the system would allow precise control of the phase composition of the mixed oxide catalyst, the crystallite size, the crystallinity, and the morphology of the active phase. A developed synthesis routine thus could lead to defined crystallite sizes or even nano-crystalline (MoVW) 5 O 14 mixed oxide catalysts. Moreover, it offers a versatile path to control its elementary composition. Effects of crystallite size / morphology and elemental composition could be studied separately on the catalytic performance. To this end, some steps of the developed aqueous preparation procedure are characterised by in situ micro Raman spectroscopy. The important, subsequent drying process as well as further activation and formation procedures are investigated by in situ Raman spectroscopy, HREM and XRD. Comparison with Raman spectra of well defined, single-crystalline reference oxides [13] can be used to assign the obtained spectra during these catalyst preparation routes to certain oxides, such as MoO 2, Mo 4 O 11, Mo 8 O 23, MoO 3, or Mo 5 O 14. A different approach is currently carried out to synthesize the MoVW oxide by a Sol gel method. The Sol-gel chemistry is widely used to synthesize metal oxides by inorganic polymerisation of molecular precursors in organic media (alcohols, hydrocarbons). The low synthesis temperatures often lead to the formation of oxides with amorphous or metastable phases, which are not observed using other synthesis routes. The sol-gel synthesis of molybdenum oxides has received little attention, especially in comparison with transition metal oxides such as TiO 2, V 2 O 5 and WO 3. The overall aim of this work is the rational preparation of molybdenum-based oxides via sol-gel synthesis of alkoxide precursors. The work concentrates on the mechanisms of solid formation from solution by in-situ measurements (Raman and UV-vis) in order to find new synthesis methods for high surface molybdenum oxides...|$|E

Metastable networks [Ag(µ-NO 2) (pyz) ] (1, 2) are composed of dimerised (1) and delaminated (2) AgNO 2 /pyrazine, which convert to the ground-state [Ag(κ 2 -NO 2) (pyz) ] form 3 with 3 D connectivity. The metastable phases show responsiveness to solvent vapour and temperature. This work shows how anion···π interactions influence solid-state structure with support from computational modelling and highlights how <b>metastable</b> <b>materials</b> may harness anion···π interactions to deliver large structural and property changes...|$|R
40|$|This {{invention}} {{relates to}} a noncontact imagine pyrometer system for obtaining the true temperature {{image of a}} given substance in a contactless fashion without making assumptions about localized emissivity of the substance or the uniformity of the temperature distribution. Such a contactless temperature imaging system has particular application {{in the study and}} production of many materials where the physical contact required to make a conventional temperature measurement drastically effects or contaminates the physical process being observed. Two examples where accurate temperature profiles are of critical interest are: (1) the solid-liquid phase change interface in the production of electronic <b>materials</b> and (2) <b>metastable</b> <b>materials</b> in the undercooling region. The apparent novelty resides in the recognition that an active pyrometer system may be advantageously adapted to perform contactless temperature imaging so that an accurate temperature profile can be obtained...|$|R
40|$|The {{complexity}} of materials aging {{may be seen}} {{as a result of the}} interplay between several activation processes operating on multiple spatial and temporal scales. Though the disciplines involved may seem disparate at first, material aging fundamentally could be linked by the same set of underlying activations and responses of the system. We examine how recent studies of shear-induced deformation and rheological flow initiated in the soft-matter community can be leveraged to probe the mechanisms of radiation damage in nuclear materials. Bridging these two traditionally separate areas of research demonstrates the emerging notions of mesoscale science as a research frontier concerned with linking macroscale behavior to microscale processes in driven systems. We suggest the combining of microstructure-sensitive measurements with fundamental theories and mechanism-specific simulations is essential to addressing <b>metastable</b> <b>materials</b> responses of strongly activated states.

40|$|Predicting the {{conditions}} in which a compound adopts a metastable structure when it crystallizes out of solution is an unsolved and fundamental problem in materials synthesis, and one which if understood and harnessed, could enable the rational design of synthesis pathways towards or away from metastable structures. Although metastable phases are ubiquitous in both nature and technology, only a heuristic understanding of their underlying thermodynamics and formation mechanisms exists. In this thesis, we aim to address two important outstanding questions regarding the fundamental nature of metastability: Which metastable phases can form? Under which conditions will they form? We will employ a variety of computational and theoretical approaches to elucidate quantitative insights to these two questions. To better predict which <b>metastable</b> <b>materials</b> can be made, we first seek to understand the <b>metastable</b> <b>materials</b> that have been made. We data-mine the Materials Project, a high-throughput database of DFT-calculated energetics of ICSD structures, to explicitly quantify the energy scale of metastability for 29, 902 inorganic crystalline phases. We reveal the influence of chemistry and composition on the accessible range of crystalline metastability, and identify motifs characteristic of highly metastable compounds. We further assert that not all low-energy <b>metastable</b> <b>materials</b> can necessarily be made, and argue for a concept of "remnant metastability" - that observable metastable phases are remnants of thermodynamic conditions where they were once the lowest free-energy phase. Recently, exciting thermochemistry experiments have demonstrated that for many compounds, as metastability of a phase increases, its surface energy decreases. This effect is significant enough to trigger a reversal of relative phase stability in nanoparticles. Because nucleation and growth starts at the nanoscale, we hypothesize that the direct precipitation of metastable phases during crystallization may be 'remnant metastability' of size-dependent nanoscale phase stability. We develop algorithms for the automated, efficient, and high-throughput calculation of surface energies via DFT. We combine these algorithms with prior theoretical frameworks to predict solid-aqueous equilibria, enabling the calculation of nucleation barriers of competing polymorphs as a function of solution chemistry, thereby predicting the solution conditions governing polymorph selection. We apply this approach to resolve the long-standing 'Calcite-Aragonite Problem' - the observation that calcium carbonate precipitates as the metastable aragonite polymorph in marine environments, rather than the stable phase calcite - which is of tremendous relevance to biomineralization, carbon sequestration, paleogeochemistry, and the vulnerability of marine life to ocean acidification. We identify a direct relationship between the calcite surface energy and solution Mg/Ca ion concentrations, showing that the calcite nucleation barrier surpasses that of metastable aragonite in solutions with Mg/Ca ratios consistent with modern seawater, allowing aragonite to dominate the kinetics of nucleation. Our ability to quantify how solution parameters distinguish between polymorphs marks an important step towards the ab initio prediction of materials synthesis pathways in solution. by Wenhao Sun.

40|$|A {{large number}} of nonequilibrium {{processes}} for synthesizing <b>metastable</b> <b>materials</b> use mechanical energy for driving the process. The mechanical energy can also alter chemical reactions in a significant manner. In {{order to understand the}} role of mechanical energy we have initiated a program of research to explore basic processes behind the mechanical energy induced changes by designing experiments using simple systems. We show that milling leads to both the enhancement of the thermodynamic driving force and the transport kinetics. The former is achieved through reduction in length scale and possible breaking of the bonds. The defects also enhance kinetics. The relative importance of these two factors depends on the system being studied. Analysis of mechanochemical reactions using simple electrochemical replacement reactions involving ionic bonds elucidates the roles of thermodynamics and kinetics. Finally, it is shown that under certain conditions, it is possible to induce reverse reaction by mechanical milling...|$|R
40|$|While {{thermodynamically}} stable {{metal oxides}} and other solids could be prepared by conventional high-temperature (ceramic) methods, syntheses {{of the more}} important <b>metastable</b> oxide <b>materials</b> of current interest, such as the zeolites and other microporous solids as well as layered and framework oxides of various kinds require mild, chemistry-based routes that occur at relatively low temperatures. In this review, we present a brief survey of the emerging chimie douce (soft-chemical) routes which enable synthesis {{of a wide variety of}} <b>metastable</b> oxide <b>materials.</b> A distinction is made between topochemical and onomatopoetically routes. Ion exchange, intercalation, redox insertion/extraction, and pillaring are examples of topochemical routes; syntheses using sol-gel, hydrothermal conditions, molten salt media, and acid leaching of appropriate precursor oxides belong to the nontopochemical prefabricated by a high-temperature route, which is then transformed into a metastable phase by an appropriate soft-chemical route. Several examples of synthesis of metastable oxides, drawn from the recent literature as well as from the author's work, are discussed...|$|R

For the model material system of V 0. 26 Al 0. 74 N, a complete transition from hexagonal to supersaturated cubic structure is achieved by tuning the incident energy, hence subplantation depth, of Al+ metal ions during reactive hybrid high power impulse magnetron sputtering of Al target and direct current magnetron sputtering of V target in Ar/N- 2 gas mixture. These findings enable the phase selective synthesis of novel <b>metastable</b> <b>materials</b> that combine excellent mechanical properties, thermal stability, and oxidation resistance.
