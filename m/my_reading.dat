[...] He further stated, [...] "From his own public comments and <b>my</b> <b>reading</b> of the record, it is apparent that Karl Rove has modeled the Bush presidency on that of William McKinley ... and modeled himself on Mark Hanna, the man who virtually manufactured McKinley", a man whose primary [...] "passion" [...] was attending to corporate and imperial power.|$|E

2500|$|In 1932, {{he founded}} the Hollywood Cricket Club and created a pitch with {{imported}} English grass. He attracted fellow expatriates such as David Niven, Laurence Olivier, Nigel Bruce (who served as captain), Leslie Howard and Boris Karloff to the club {{as well as local}} American players. Smith's stereotypical Englishness spawned several amusing anecdotes: while fielding at slip for the Hollywood Club, he dropped a difficult catch and ordered his English butler to fetch his spectacles; they were brought on to the field on a silver platter. The next ball looped gently to slip, to present the kind of catch that [...] "a child would take at midnight with no moon." [...] Smith dropped it and, snatching off his lenses, commented, [...] "Damned fool brought <b>my</b> <b>reading</b> glasses." [...] Decades after his cricket career had ended, when he had long been a famous face in films, Smith was spotted in the pavilion on a visit to Lord's. [...] "That man over there seems familiar", remarked one member to another. [...] "Yes", said the second, seemingly oblivious to his Hollywood fame, [...] "Chap called Smith.

2500|$|In addition, “he {{is often}} {{mentioned}} by writers like Montaigne and Lessing... {{but he made}} no major contribution to intellectual history, and by the nineteenth century he seemed to be... rather little read and rarely edited” [...] However, in his celebrated Autobiography, John Stuart Mill (arguably the nineteenth-century's most influential English intellectual) spoke highly of Quintilian as a force in his early education. He wrote that Quintilian, while little-read in Mill's day due to [...] "his obscure style and to the scholastic details of which many parts of his treatise are made up," [...] was [...] "seldom sufficiently appreciated." [...] "His book," [...] Mill continued, [...] "is a kind of encyclopaedia of the thoughts of the ancients on the whole field of education and culture; and I have retained through life many valuable ideas which I can distinctly trace to <b>my</b> <b>reading</b> of him..." [...] He was also highly praised by Thomas De Quincey: [...] "or elegance and as a practical model in the art he was expounding, neither Aristotle, nor any less austere among the Greek rhetoricians, has any pretensions to measure himself with Quintilian. In reality, for a triumph over the difficulties of the subject, and as a lesson {{on the possibility of}} imparting grace to the treatment of scholastic topics, naturally as intractable as that of Grammar or Prosody, there is no such chef-d'oeuvre to this hour in any literature, as the Institutions of Quintilian" [...] In more recent times, Quintilian appears to have made another upward turn. He is frequently included in anthologies of literary criticism, and {{is an integral part of}} the history of education. He is believed to be the “earliest spokesman for a child-centered education” (141), which is discussed above under his early childhood education theories. As well, he has something to offer students of speech, professional writing, and rhetoric, because of the great detail with which he covers the rhetorical system. His discussions of tropes and figures also formed the foundation of contemporary works on the nature of figurative language, including the post-structuralist and formalist theories. For example, the works of Jacques Derrida on the failure of language to impart the truth of the objects it is meant to represent would not be possible without Quintilian’s assumptions about the function of figurative language and tropes.|$|E
