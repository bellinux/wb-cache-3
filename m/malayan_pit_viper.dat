25|$|On the Indian subcontinent, {{almost all}} snakebite deaths have {{traditionally}} been attributed to the Big Four, consisting of the Russell's viper, Indian cobra, saw-scaled viper, and the common krait. However, {{studies have shown that}} the hump-nosed viper, previously considered essentially harmless and misidentified as the saw-scaled viper, is capable of delivering a fatal bite. In regions of Kerala, India, it may be responsible for nearly 10% of venomous bites. Commonly used antivenoms in India do not appear to be effective against hump-nosed viper bites. According to the most conservative estimates, at least 81,000 snake envenomings and 11,000 fatalities occur in India each year, making it the most heavily affected country in the world. The <b>Malayan</b> <b>pit</b> <b>viper</b> and banded krait are two other species involved in a significant number of venomous bites.|$|E
500|$|Some {{traditional}} hypotheses of {{snake venom}} evolution {{have supported the}} idea that most snakes inject far more venom into their prey than is required to kill them; thus, venom composition would {{not be subject to}} natural selection. This is known as the [...] "overkill" [...] hypothesis. However, recent studies of the molecular history of snake venom have contradicted this, instead finding evidence of rapid adaptive evolution in many different clades, including the carpet vipers, Echis, the ground rattlesnakes, Sistrurus, and the <b>Malayan</b> <b>pit</b> <b>viper,</b> as well as generally in the diversification of PLA2 proteins. There is phylogenetic evidence of positive selection and rapid rates of gene gain and loss in venom genes of Sistrurus taxa feeding on different prey. Several studies have found evidence that venom and resistance to venom in prey species have evolved in a coevolutionary arms race. For example, wood rats of the genus Neotoma have a high degree of resistance to the venom of rattlesnakes, suggesting that the rats have evolved in response to the snake venom, thus renewing selection pressure upon the snakes. The selection pressure on snake venom is thought to be selecting for functional diversity within the proteins in venom, both within a given species, and across species. The genes that code for venom proteins in some snake genera have a proportion of synonymous mutations that is lower than would be expected if venom were evolving through neutral evolutionary processes. In addition, snake venom is metabolically costly for a snake to produce, which scientists have suggested as further evidence that a selection pressure exists on snake venom (in this case, to minimize the volume of venom required). The use of model organisms, rather than snakes' natural prey, to study prey toxicity, has been suggested as a reason why the [...] "overkill" [...] hypothesis may have been overemphasized. However, the pitviper genus Agkistrodon {{has been found to be}} an exception to this; the composition of venom in Agkistrodon has been found to be related to the position of the species within the phylogeny, suggesting that those venoms have evolved mostly through neutral processes (mutation and genetic drift), and that there may be significant variation in the selection pressure upon various snake venoms.|$|E

40|$|Snakes {{which had}} been killed and brought to {{hospital}} with the patients they had bitten were collected in 80 district and provincial hospitals throughout 67 provinces in Thailand {{in order to establish}} the geographical distribution and relative medical importance of the venomous species. Of the 1631 snakes collected, 1145 were venomous: <b>Malayan</b> <b>pit</b> <b>vipers</b> (Calloselasma rhodostoma), green <b>pit</b> <b>vipers</b> (Trimeresurus albolabris) and Russell's vipers (Daboia russelii) were the most numerous, while T. albolabris, C. rhodostoma and spitting cobras ('Naja atra') were the most widely distributed. In 22 cases, non-venomous species were mistaken for venomous ones and antivenom was used unnecessarily. The Malayan krait (Bungarus candidus) was confused with B. fasciatus in 5 cases and B. fasciatus antivenom was used inappropriately. The study extended the known ranges of most of the medically-important venomous species in Thailand. Correct identification of venomous snakes is especially important in Thailand because the locally-produced antivenoms are monospecific.

40|$|Snake venom {{been studied}} for its {{lethality}} and various benefits for mankind. The latter been studied a plenty of recent but none related to {{coagulation of milk}} to curd. The coagulation time of milk by samples were done using visible parameters i. e. change in viscosity, colour changes, white spot formation (separation between curd and whey) and finally observing a drop of coagulating fluid under magnification of a light microscope. Optimum parameters determined included concentration of coagulants, temperature and pH. Microscopic viewing included observing after centrifugation, under light microscope and SEM. Screening eleven venoms mostly predominantly found in tropical region singled out one with the most rapid coagulating timei. e by Calloselasma rhodostoma (CR). Optimization of CR venom related to several parameters provided venom concentration, 0. 07 (w/v%); pH, 7. 0; temperature, 45. 50 C while that of rennet were determined to be 0. 04 ± 0. 02 (w/v%); pH, 7. 0; temperature, 45. 50 C, respectively. Under these ideal conditions for both coagulants, comparison of their milk coagulation time found CR superior i. e. 0. 41 ± 0. 02 min compared to 4. 23 ± 0. 05 min for rennet. Milk coagulating assay guided fractionation of CR venom by using HiTrap SP FF and consecutively followed by HiPrep 26 / 60 Sephacryl S 200 HR pre-packed columns led to a single band on coomassie stained SDS-PAGE gel. Next by LCMS analysis on the SDS PAGE band identified the presence of metalloproteinase kistominwithin the venom. EDTA inactivated the venom presumably chelating zinc hence suggesting further towards identifying kistomin as the likely protease within this venom with milk-clotting activity.

Following intramuscular venom injection (2 micrograms/g body weight), serial blood samples were taken from the femoral vein for measurement of whole blood clotting time and AT-III activity.
