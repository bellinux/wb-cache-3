50|$|Many {{retailers}} sell devices which {{exploit the}} discomforting effects of in-air ultrasound. These devices are usually {{combined with a}} motion sensor which is triggered by movement within the sensors range. This causes the device to emit high frequency noise which is uncomfortable to the cats, and inaudible to most humans (although they can still experience unpleasant subjective effects and, potentially, shifts in the hearing threshold). The devices are available in both battery and <b>mains</b> <b>operated</b> forms, the latter generally having a higher output, greater range and requiring less attention.|$|R

An observer simultaneously recorded locomotor behaviour using a manually <b>operated</b> event <b>recorder.</b> Both data streams were recorded directly to hard disk to ensure accurate synchrony. Leaps were modelled using a y = x 2 – x 3 formu-lation for the take-off acceleration, to link peak acceleration to leap distance. Cyclic locomotor modes were analysed using power spectra and the modal fre-quency used to estimate stride periodicity. Comparison of the dual data shows that leaping behaviour can be recorded reliably, and acceleration magnitude provides accurate predictions of the distance travelled. Cyclic activities were less well characterised, but calibration should permit travel distance estimations equalling or bettering those from conventional techniques...|$|R
