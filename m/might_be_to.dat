25|$|An example: Suppose {{there is}} a library {{function}} whose purpose is to parse a single syslog file entry. What should this function do if the entry is malformed? There is no one right answer, because the same library could be deployed in programs for many different purposes. In an interactive log-file browser, {{the right thing to}} do <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>to</b> return the entry unparsed, so the user can see it—but in an automated log-summarizing program, {{the right thing to do}} <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>to</b> supply null values for the unreadable fields, but abort with an error, if too many entries have been malformed.|$|E
25|$|One {{approach}} to the problem <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>to</b> run the program for some number of steps and check if it halts. But if the program does not halt, it is unknown whether the program will eventually halt or run forever.|$|E
25|$|The {{least squares}} estimators are point {{estimates}} of the linear regression model parameters β. However, generally {{we also want to}} know how close those estimates <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>to</b> the true values of parameters. In other words, we want to construct the interval estimates.|$|E

25|$|Others opposed Romanization on {{practical}} grounds, as was no suitable {{adaptation of}} the Latin script {{that could be used}} for Turkish phonemes. Some suggested that a better alternative <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>to</b> modify the Arabic script to introduce extra characters for better representing Turkish vowels.|$|E
25|$|An {{example of}} {{delivering}} {{a project to}} requirements might be agreeing to deliver a computer system that will process staff data and manage payroll, holiday and staff personnel records.

50|$|In The 16 Strivings for God Reiss {{develops}} {{the theory that}} people embrace religion because it provides them with opportunities to satisfy all 16 basic desires both in strong form and in weak form. For example, {{a person with a}} weak basic desire for social contact <b>might</b> <b>be</b> attracted <b>to</b> religious retreats, while a person with a strong basic desire for Social Contact <b>might</b> <b>be</b> attracted <b>to</b> religious festivals. A person with a weak basic desire for Vengeance <b>might</b> <b>be</b> attracted <b>to</b> passages in scriptures that speak of peace and forgiveness, while a person with a strong basic desire for Vengeance <b>might</b> <b>be</b> attracted <b>to</b> passages that speak of revenge.|$|R
50|$|If the {{engineering}} project <b>were</b> <b>to</b> design a vehicle, statics <b>might</b> <b>be</b> employed <b>to</b> design {{the frame of}} the vehicle in order to evaluate where the stresses will be most intense. Dynamics <b>might</b> <b>be</b> used when designing the car's engine to evaluate the forces in the pistons and cams as the engine cycles. Mechanics of materials <b>might</b> <b>be</b> used <b>to</b> choose appropriate materials for the manufacture of the frame and engine. Fluid mechanics <b>might</b> <b>be</b> used <b>to</b> design a ventilation system for the vehicle or to design the intake system for the engine.|$|R
25|$|The {{goals of}} tone mapping can be {{differently}} stated {{depending on the}} particular application. In some cases producing just aesthetically pleasing images is the main goal, while other applications might emphasize reproducing as many image details as possible, or maximizing the image contrast. The goal in realistic rendering applications <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>to</b> obtain a perceptual match between a real scene and a displayed image even though the display device {{is not able to}} reproduce the full range of luminance values.|$|E
25|$|Many radio {{frequencies}} penetrate Earth's atmosphere quite well, {{and this}} led to radio telescopes that investigate the cosmos using large radio antennas. Furthermore, human endeavors emit considerable electromagnetic radiation as a byproduct of communications such as television and radio. These signals {{would be easy to}} recognize as artificial due to their repetitive nature and narrow bandwidths. If this is typical, one way of discovering an extraterrestrial civilization <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>to</b> detect artificial radio emissions from a location outside the Solar System.|$|E
25|$|Besides being {{compatible}} with the mere order relations, functions between posets may also behave well with respect to special elements and constructions. For example, when talking about posets with least element, it may seem reasonable to consider only monotonic functions that preserve this element, i.e. which map least elements to least elements. If binary infima ∧ exist, then a reasonable property <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>to</b> require that f(x ∧ y) = f(x) ∧ f(y), for all x and y. All of these properties, and indeed many more, may be compiled under the label of limit-preserving functions.|$|E
50|$|The {{self-awareness}} required <b>to</b> practice rhetoric <b>might</b> <b>be</b> difficult <b>to</b> {{notice and}} acknowledge in some animals. However, some animals {{are capable of}} acknowledging themselves in a mirror, and therefore, they <b>might</b> <b>be</b> understood <b>to</b> <b>be</b> self-aware and engaged in rhetoric when practicing some form of language, and therefore, rhetoric.|$|R

25|$|Use of the Latin script {{had been}} {{proposed}} before. In 1862, during Tanzimat, the statesman Münuf Pasha advocated a {{reform of the}} alphabet. At {{the start of the}} 20th century, similar proposals were made by several writers associated with the Young Turks movement, including Hüseyin Cahit, Abdullah Cevdet, and Celâl Nuri. The issue was raised again in 1923 during the first Economic Congress of the newly founded Turkish Republic, sparking a public debate that was to continue for several years. Some suggested that a better alternative <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>to</b> modify the Arabic script to introduce extra characters to better represent Turkish vowels.|$|E
25|$|When Mazuz asked Metzger {{to resign}} in 2005, the story {{initially}} sparked some {{debate over the}} necessity of having two Israeli Chief Rabbis at all, or of maintaining the Chief Rabbinate as an institution. Some suggested that one way of preserving the integrity and relevance of the office <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>to</b> convince the religious Ashkenazi communities of Israel to decline to hold elections to replace Metzger, should he resign. This move would have consolidated the post from two seats to one, and help eliminate {{one of the most}} public representations of the office's perceived anachronism often cited by its critics. However, since then there has been little follow-up.|$|E
25|$|While economists widely {{cite the}} Big Mac index as a {{reasonable}} real-world measurement of purchasing power parity, the burger methodology has some limitations. In many countries, eating at international fast-food chain restaurants such as McDonald's is relatively expensive {{in comparison to}} eating at a local restaurant, {{and the demand for}} Big Macs is not as large in countries such as India as in the United States. Social status of eating at fast food restaurants such as McDonald's in a local market, what proportion of sales <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>to</b> expatriates, local taxes, levels of competition, and import duties on selected items may not be representative of the country's economy as a whole.|$|E
50|$|Because {{of these}} limits (address management, bus configuration, {{potential}} faults, speed), few I²C bus segments have even a dozen devices. It {{is common for}} systems to have several such segments. One <b>might</b> <b>be</b> dedicated <b>to</b> use with high-speed devices, for low-latency power management. Another <b>might</b> <b>be</b> used <b>to</b> control a few devices where latency and throughput are not important issues; yet another segment <b>might</b> <b>be</b> used only <b>to</b> read EEPROM chips describing add-on cards (such as the SPD standard used with DRAM sticks).|$|R

25|$|Swapping of {{the wing}} men: Sometimes, a team with two {{flexible}} (position wise) wide men {{will allow them to}} interchange as the game progresses. The aim of this is to confuse the defenders who are assigned to mark them, thus maybe leading to opportunities as the defender tries to find their man in set pieces (corners, free kicks etc., where the man may be in a totally different position and thus evade his grasp). Also, if the wingers are different types of player (one favouring crossing from deep positions whilst the other is prone to trying to dribble past their marker for example), then it <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>to</b> exploit a weakness in the opposing defender.|$|E
25|$|Of course, Lord King LC {{was worried}} that {{trustees}} might exploit opportunities to use trust property for themselves instead of looking after it. Business speculators using trusts had just recently caused a stock market crash. Strict duties for trustees {{made their way into}} company law and were applied to directors and chief executive officers. Another example of a trustee's duty <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>to</b> invest property wisely or sell it. This is especially the case for pension funds, the most important form of trust, where investors are trustees for people's savings until retirement. But trusts can also be set up for charitable purposes, famous examples being the British Museum or the Rockefeller Foundation.|$|E
25|$|A {{key feature}} of ObjC is {{its support for}} categories, methods that {{can be added to}} extend classes at runtime. Categories allow {{extending}} classes in-place to add new functions with no need to subclass or even have access to the original source code. An example <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>to</b> add spell checker support to the base NSString class, which means all instances of NSString in the application gain spell checking. The system is also widely used as an organizational technique, allowing related code to be gathered into library-like extensions. Swift continues to support this concept, although they are now termed extensions, and declared with the keyword extension. Unlike ObjC, Swift can also add new properties accessors, types and enums to extant instances.|$|E
50|$|Initially, nüzül {{was seen}} as an {{alternative}} <b>to</b> avarız; nuzul <b>was</b> (in principle) a payment of food, in kind. In times of war, villages <b>might</b> <b>be</b> required <b>to</b> supply food to army supply points, or they <b>might</b> <b>be</b> required <b>to</b> supply cash; but never both. Over time, this relationship changed, and both <b>might</b> <b>be</b> demanded (whilst nüzül also became a cash tax).|$|R

25|$|Political {{and popular}} debate {{concerning}} {{the existence and}} cause of climate change includes {{the reasons for the}} increase seen in the instrumental temperature record, whether the warming trend exceeds normal climatic variations, and whether human activities have contributed significantly to it. Scientists have resolved these questions decisively in favour of the view that the current warming trend exists and is ongoing, that human activity is the cause, and that it is without precedent in at least 2000 years. Public disputes that also reflect scientific debate include estimates of how responsive the climate system <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>to</b> any given level of greenhouse gases (climate sensitivity), how global climate change will play out at local and regional scales, and what the consequences of global warming will be.|$|E
25|$|The formal {{definition}} of distributions exhibits {{them as a}} subspace {{of a very large}} space, namely the topological dual of D(U) (or S(Rd) for tempered distributions). It is not immediately clear from the definition how exotic a distribution <b>might</b> <b>be.</b> <b>To</b> answer this question, it is instructive to see distributions built up from a smaller space, namely the space of continuous functions. Roughly, any distribution is locally a (multiple) derivative of a continuous function. A precise version of this result, given below, holds for distributions of compact support, tempered distributions, and general distributions. Generally speaking, no proper subset of the space of distributions contains all continuous functions and is closed under differentiation. This says that distributions are not particularly exotic objects; they are only as complicated as necessary.|$|E
25|$|There are {{two kinds}} of intent analysis, {{reflecting}} two meanings of the word intent. The first, a rule of common law construction during the Founding Era, is functional intent. The second is motivational intent. To understand the difference, one can use the metaphor of an architect who designs a Gothic church with flying buttresses. The functional intent of flying buttresses is to prevent the weight of the roof from spreading the walls and causing a collapse of the building, which can be inferred from examining the design as a whole. The motivational intent <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>to</b> create work for his brother-in-law who is a flying buttress subcontractor. Using original intent analysis of the first kind, we can discern that the language of Article III of the U.S. Constitution was to delegate to Congress the power to allocate original and appellate jurisdictions, and not to remove some jurisdiction, involving a constitutional question, from all courts. That would suggest that the decision was wrong in Ex Parte McCardle.|$|E
