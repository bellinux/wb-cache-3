Psychosocial interventions include education (addressing among other things the correct use of analgesic medications and effective communication with clinicians) and coping-skills training (changing thoughts, emotions, and behaviors through training in skills such as problem solving, relaxation, distraction and cognitive restructuring).

5|$|A {{commonly}} studied {{variation of}} the problem involves networks of interior-disjoint smooth curves, with junctions where three {{or more of the}} curves meet. When the junctions all have exactly three curves meeting at angles of 2/3 (the same conditions seen in an optimal Steiner tree or two-dimensional foam of soap bubbles) the flow is well-defined for the short term. However, it may eventually reach a singular state with four or more curves meeting at a junction, and there <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> than one way to continue the flow past such a singularity.|$|E
5|$|A {{few days}} after the murders, the Ministry of Interior {{announced}} its deliberation about making the gun license registry accessible to psychiatrists in order to give them the ability to report to police possible changes of mental state of their patients having an impact on their eligibility to possess firearms.

5|$|Chemistry {{experiments}} {{have confirmed that}} lawrencium behaves as a heavier homolog to lutetium in the periodic table, and is a trivalent element.

This means that lawrencium <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> volatile than expected for its position in the periodic table and have a volatility comparable to that of lead.|$|E
