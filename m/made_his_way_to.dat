5|$|At {{the end of}} the 14th century, {{the castle}} was used as a refuge by Richard II from the forces of his rival, Henry Bolingbroke.

The king was then taken to London and died later in captivity at Pontefract Castle.|$|E

It was during one of those visits in 1962 that he met his wife, whose family had also fled from Jaffa. The couple had a son and two daughters.|$|E
5|$|Isolated {{inside the}} Tower, the royal {{government}} {{was in a}} state of shock at the turn of events. The King left the castle that morning and <b>made</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> negotiate with the rebels at Mile End in east London, taking only a very small bodyguard with him. The King left Sudbury and Hales behind in the Tower, either for their own safety or because Richard had decided it would be safer to distance himself from his unpopular ministers. Along the way, several Londoners accosted the King to complain about alleged injustices.|$|E
5|$|On 10 April 1919, Towner {{attended}} an investiture ceremony {{in the ballroom}} of Buckingham Palace, during which he was decorated with his Victoria Cross and Military Cross by King George V.

5|$|On November 19, the British {{flotilla}} was captured, but Carleton narrowly escaped and <b>made</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> Quebec City. Montgomery's kind treatment {{toward the}} captured British prisoners caused several officers {{to express their}} concern. Montgomery saw this {{as a challenge to}} his authority and this, along with the lack of discipline in the army, caused Montgomery to threaten resignation. Letters from Washington in which Washington also expressed his troubles with the discipline of troops convinced Montgomery to continue his command.|$|E
5|$|Robert escaped and <b>made</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> Chester, {{where in}} 1645 {{he was made}} High Sheriff of the county of Cheshire.

This time he made for Oxford, where King Charles I was in residence, but it fell only a few months later on 24 June 1646, effectively ending the war.|$|E
5|$|Superman pursues Luthor, who has <b>made</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> {{the growing}} land mass.

Luthor's thugs beat Superman into submission as {{he is unable to}} fight back. Luthor impales Superman with a kryptonite shard and allows him to fall into the ocean, presumably to die.|$|E

5|$|By 13 January {{most of the}} {{survivors}} of the fleet had limped back to France in a state of disrepair. One ship of the line that remained at sea, the 74-gun Droits de l'Homme, was commanded by Commodore Jean-Baptiste Raymond de Lacrosse and carried over 1,300men, 700–800 of them soldiers, including General Jean Humbert. Detached from {{the main body of the}} fleet during the retreat from Bantry Bay, Lacrosse <b>made</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> the mouth of the Shannon alone. Recognising that the weather was still too violent for a landing to be made, Lacrosse acknowledged the failure of the operation and ordered the ship to return to France, capturing the British privateer Cumberland en route.|$|E

5|$|By March, however, Brooks' {{unit had}} grown to 110 men and he was {{promoted}} to Second Lieutenant and put in charge of a band of 40 soldiers, including Duncan. His guerrilla activities expanded to include larger raids, reprisal attacks, and the assassination of more important members of the Nazi regime. He would later earn the Polish Cross of Valor for helping lead over 100 of his men out of a German encirclement to safety without a single casualty. He <b>made</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> the Russian front line in January 1945, and was eventually transferred from Lviv to Odessa, Port Said, Cairo, and finally London, where he arrived in March 1945.|$|E
5|$|During a {{subsequent}} confrontation with thirteen Japanese aircraft on 1 December, Armidale {{was struck by}} two torpedoes and a bomb, and began to sink; the order to abandon ship was given. After helping to free a life-raft, Sheean was wounded by two bullets. He <b>made</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> the aft Oerlikon 20mm cannon and began to fire on the Japanese aircraft to protect those in the water. Sheean managed to shoot {{down one of the}} Japanese bombers, but was killed when Armidale sank. Many of the survivors credited their lives to Sheean and he was posthumously mentioned in despatches. In 1999, the submarine HMAS Sheean was named in his honour, and efforts have been made to have Sheean belatedly awarded the Victoria Cross for Australia.|$|E
5|$|Escorted by {{elements}} of the 3rd Krajina Brigade, Tito <b>made</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> Potoci, where he was met by a battalion of the 1st Proletarian Brigade. At Potoci, they were met by {{the staff of the}} Allied military missions. The British mission signals officer had brought the only surviving radio. Initially, Tito had been in favour of continuing the attack on the SS paratroopers, but after reassessing the situation, he cancelled further attacks. As the German intention to encircle the Supreme Command in a small area around Drvar with approaching units, and then destroy it with land forces had become apparent by now, serious reorganisation of Partisan dispositions was now required. After German troops were observed in the area of Potoci, Tito and his companions were escorted towards Kupres.|$|E
