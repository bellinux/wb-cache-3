60|$|At daybreak the Lighthouse yacht, {{attended}} by a boat from the floating light, again stood towards the Bell Rock. The weather felt extremely cold this morning, the thermometer being at 34 degrees, {{with the wind}} at east, accompanied by occasional showers of snow, and the <b>marine</b> <b>barometer</b> indicated 29.80. At half-past seven the sea ran with such force upon the rock that it seemed doubtful if a landing could be effected. At half-past eight, when it was fairly above water, the writer took {{his place in the}} floating light's boat with the artificers, while the yacht's boat followed, according to the general rule of having two boats afloat in landing expeditions of this kind, that, in case of accident to one boat, the other might assist. In several unsuccessful attempts the boats were beat back by the breach of the sea upon the rock. On the eastern side it separated into two distinct waves, which came with a sweep round to the western side, where they met; and at the instance of their confluence the water rose in spray to a considerable height. Watching what the sailors term a smooth, we caught a favourable opportunity, and in a very dexterous manner the boats were rowed between the two seas, and made a favourable landing at the western creek.|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} 1770s, Edward Nairne {{constructed}} {{the first successful}} <b>marine</b> <b>barometer</b> by constricting the glass tube between the cistern and register plate. The instrument was suspended from gimbals mounted within a freestanding frame to provide additional stability. Nairne’s first <b>marine</b> <b>barometer</b> was sent on James Cook’s second voyage to the South Pacific.|$|E
5000|$|Adie {{supplied}} lenses to Joseph Hooker, Charles Darwin and Sir David Brewster and was optician to William IV and to Queen Victoria. He {{invented the}} sympiesometer or <b>marine</b> <b>barometer</b> {{and had a}} small observatory erected long {{before there was a}} public observatory in Edinburgh. [...] He was elected as Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh on 25 January 1819, upon the proposal of Lord F Gray, Sir David Brewster and James Russell.|$|E
5000|$|On 17 August, 26 August, 21 October, and 10 November 1852 Welsh made, for the Kew committee, four ascents from Vauxhall, {{with the}} {{assistance}} of Charles Green, in his balloon the Great (or Royal) Nassau. The purpose was to make meteorological observations, and a detailed description was published in Philosophical Transactions in 1853. In March and May 1854 he made for the committee an investigation on the [...] "pumping" [...] of <b>marine</b> <b>barometers,</b> an artefact of the rolling motion of ships. In 1855 Welsh went to the Exposition Universelle in Paris for the exhibit of magnetic and meteorological instruments used at Kew. In 1856 he began at Kew a series of monthly determinations of magnetic field intensity and magnetic dip with instruments provided by Edward Sabine. In the same year Welsh was directed to construct self-recording magnetic instruments on models devised originally by Ronalds and improved by himself.|$|R
40|$|Matthew Flinders {{began his}} Private Journal {{on the day}} his active career as an {{explorer}} and navigator finished, {{the day he was}} detained on Mauritius by Governor Decaen. He kept the journal almost daily until 9 days before his death. In this paper I will trace his inner journey - the ways he changed and developed over the decade covered by the journal, and how this is reflected in the Journal. During the {{six and a half years}} of detention on Mauritius he broadened his intellectual and cultural horizons considerably. He learned French, and read many classics of French literature and science. After some initial shyness in mixed society, he participated freely in the French plantation society of Mauritius and befriended French naval officers who were officially his enemies. With time on his hands, he undertook projects such as his biographical tribute to Trim, a study of the history of Madagascar, and observations on the <b>marine</b> <b>barometer.</b> By sheer force of will he conquered the black depression which threatened to engulf him as his detention extended indefinitely. Back in England, reunited with his wife after 9 years, he set to work on his major work, Voyage to Terra Australis, which he worked on practically without a break until his death in July 1814. Although in many ways the Private Journal shows Flinders mellowing and maturing as a result of his ordeals, he also lost much of the optimistic and adventurous spirit which spurred him on to the achievements for which he is famous...|$|E
