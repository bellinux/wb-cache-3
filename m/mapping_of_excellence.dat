40|$|As {{research}} {{becomes an}} ever more globalized activity, there is growing interest in national and international comparisons of standards and quality in different countries and regions. A sign for this trend is the increasing interest in rankings of universities according to their research performance, both inside but also outside the scientific environment. New methods presented in this paper, enable us to <b>map</b> centers <b>of</b> <b>excellence</b> around the world using programs that are freely available. Based on Scopus data, field-specific excellence can be identified and agglomerated in regions and cities where recently highly cited papers were published. Differences in performance rates can be visualized on the map using colours and sizes of the marks...|$|R
40|$|Using {{assessment}} {{processes and}} results for program improvement {{is what makes}} program assessment meaningful. Even though the assessment leaders on campus such as assessment coordinators and department chairs understand this ultimate purpose of assessment, they often need concrete strategies to facilitate faculty collaborative work in interpreting and using assessment for program improvement. In this session, the presenter introduces how academic programs in a large research oriented university used assessment for improvement. The presenter offers concrete strategies for the program level assessment leaders to use assessment results, such as intriguing result presentation, presenting results with diagnostic information (e. g., on a curriculum map), and peer sharing of successful pedagogical strategies. In the end, the presenter provides a set of strategies with examples that illustrate how institutional-level assessment leaders can facilitate and promote use-of-results on campus. Strategies include showcasing (e. g., scholarship, awards, workshop training, <b>map</b> <b>of</b> <b>excellence),</b> packaging low-hanging fruit, using facilitation strategies to guide institutional committees’ actions, and building grassroots assessment leaders. Using assessment processes and results for program improvement is what makes program assessment meaningful. The presentation describes major ways that academic programs in a large research oriented university used assessment processes and results for improvement. The presenter offers practical strategies to facilitate use of assessment results for leaders at the program and at the institutional level...|$|R
40|$|This report {{analyses}} {{the productivity}} {{and the impact}} of the scientific work of the Joint Research Centre (JRC) in specific scientific areas by means of publications and citations analysis in order to identify and <b>map</b> areas <b>of</b> <b>excellence.</b> The <b>excellence</b> <b>mapping</b> is structured as two volumes: the first volume concentrates on benchmarking the scientific publications and the second one on aspects of scientific collaborations. In order to benchmark the JRC impact, five indicators based on citations and size-independent metrics are used. On the basis of these indicators, the JRC performance is compared with the Top- 15 organisations in the world having the highest absolute number of citations in a given scientific area, and against the world average.

40|$|We report {{experimental}} results on laser-driven electron acceleration with low divergence. The electron beam was generated by focussing 750 mJ, 42 fs laser pulses into a gas-filled capillary discharge waveguide at electron densities {{in the range}} between 10 ^ 18 and 10 ^ 19 cm^- 3. Quasi-monoenergetic electron bunches with energies as high as 500 MeV have been detected, with features reaching up to 1 GeV, albeit with large shot-to-shot fluctuations. A more stable regime with higher bunch charge (20 - 45 pC) and less energy (200 - 300 MeV) could also be observed. The beam divergence and the pointing stability are around or below 1 mrad and 8 mrad, respectively. These {{findings are consistent with}} self-injection of electrons into a breaking plasma wave.
