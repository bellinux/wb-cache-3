A vacuum belt press filter (VBPF) manufactured by Technopulp of Brazil was purchased and installed at Pioneer Mill in September/October 2012 and commissioning trials undertaken over a five week period commencing in early November. There are no vacuum belt press filters currently in use in Australian sugar mills for <b>mud</b> <b>processing.</b> The Technopulp filter is a relatively common and well accepted technology with over 600 units installed.

40|$|A {{reception}} strategy {{involving the}} concepts of multiuser detection, macrodiversity, and iterative decoding {{is applied to the}} uplink of a convolutionally coded time division multiple-access (TDMA) cellular net- work composed of K asynchronous cochannel trans- mitters (mobiles) and M geographically separated receivers (base stations). At each receiver, a softoutput multiuser detector (MUD) is implemented using the Log-MAP algorithm. The outputs of the M base stations are combined and passed to a bank of K soft-output convolutional decoders, also implemented using the Log-MAP algorithm. The outputs of the decoders are fed back to the base stations {{to be used as a}} priori information during the next iteration of <b>MUD.</b> <b>Processing</b> continues in an iterative manner analogous to the decoding of turbo codes. Simulation results are shown for the first tier of cochannel interferers in a fully-interleaved Rayleigh fiat-fading channel with 120 degree sectorized antennas at the base stations. The results indicate significant perfonnance gains in the presence of severe cochannel interference, and suggest a possible reduction in the frequency reuse distance...|$|E

40|$|A novel minimum {{bit-error rate}} (MBER) space–time {{equalization}} (STE) -based multiuser detector (MUD) is proposed for multiple-receive-antenna-assisted space-division multiple-access systems. It is {{shown that the}} MBER-STE-aided MUD significantly outperforms the standard minimum mean-square error design {{in terms of the}} achievable bit-error rate (BER). Adaptive implementations of the MBER STE are considered, and both the block-data-based and sample-by-sample adaptive MBER algorithms are proposed. The latter, referred to as the least BER (LBER) algorithm, is compared with the most popular adaptive algorithm, known as the least mean square (LMS) algorithm. It is shown that in case of binary phase-shift keying, the computational complexity of the LBER-STE is about half of that required by the classic LMS-STE. Simulation results demonstrate that the LBER algorithm performs consistently better than the classic LMS algorithm, both in terms of its convergence speed and steady-state BER performance.

40|$|THE HIGH {{moisture}} content of mill mud (typically 75 – 80 % for Australian factories) results in high transportation {{costs for the}} redistribution of mud onto cane farms. The high transportation cost relative to the nutrient value of the mill mud results in many milling companies subsidising {{the cost of this}} recycle to ensure a wide distribution across the cane supply area. An average mill would generate about 100 000 t of mud (at 75 % moisture) in a crushing season. The development of <b>mud</b> <b>processing</b> facilities that will produce a low moisture mud that can be effectively incorporated into cane land with existing or modified spreading equipment will improve the cost efficiency of mud redistribution to farms; provide an economical fertiliser alternative to more farms in the supply area; and reduce the potential for adverse environmental impacts from farms. A research investigation assessing solid bowl decanter centrifuges to produce low moisture mud with low residual pol was undertaken and the results compared to the performance of existing rotary vacuum filters in factory trials. The decanters were operated on filter mud feed in parallel with the rotary vacuum filters to allo...|$|E
40|$|An {{advanced}} mud {{system was}} designed and key components were built that augment a coiled tubing drilling (CTD) rig that is designed specifically to drill microholes (less than 4 -inch diameter) with advanced drilling techniques. The mud system was tailored to the hydraulics of the hole geometries and rig characteristics required for microholes and is capable of mixing and circulating mud and removing solids while being self contained and having zero discharge capability. Key components of this system are two modified triplex mud pumps (High Pressure Slurry Pumps) for advanced Abrasive Slurry Jetting (ASJ) and a modified Gas-Liquid-Solid (GLS) Separator for well control, flow return and initial processing. The system developed also includes an additional component of an advanced version of ASJ which allows cutting through most all materials encountered in oil and gas wells including steel, cement, and all rock types. It includes new fluids and new ASJ nozzles. The jetting mechanism does not require rotation of the bottom hole assembly or drill string, which is essential for use with Coiled Tubing (CT). It also has low reactive forces acting on the CT and generates cuttings small enough to be easily cleaned from the well bore, which is important in horizontal drilling. These cutting and <b>mud</b> <b>processing</b> components and capabilities compliment the concepts put forth by DOE for microhole coiled tubing drilling (MHTCTD) and should help insure the reality of drilling small diameter holes quickly and inexpensively with a minimal environmental footprint and that is efficient, compact and portable. Other components (site liners, sump and transfer pumps, stacked shakers, filter membranes, etc [...] ) of the overall mud system were identified as readily available in industry {{and will not be}} purchased until we are ready to drill a specific well...|$|E
40|$|The {{remediation}} {{of contaminated}} sites, legacies of past industrial activities, requires {{more or less}} complex and costly measures depending on {{the nature and extent}} of contamination, the environmental protection legislation currently in force, the anticipated future use and the commercial value of the land. Remedial action involves implementing techniques capable of removing or containing the contaminants to prevent them from migrating to surrounding areas. Here we explore the possibility of using red <b>muds,</b> bauxite ore <b>processing</b> waste, and/or fly ash produced by coal fired power stations for immobilizing the heavy metals contained in severely contaminated soils. The results of laboratory column leaching demonstrate that relatively small additions of fly ash or red muds, or a combination of the two, to the contaminated soils drastically reduces the heavy metal content in the effluent...|$|R

40|$|Novel {{concepts}} are introduced for finding {{the relationship between}} multiuser detection (MUD) and multiuser transmission (MUT), so that the study in MUT can benefit from the well-built theory in MUD. Our study shows that, for any given linear MUD scheme, there exists a counterpart linear MUT scheme, which can be readily designed from the original linear MUD. Based on our observations, a range of MUT algorithms are derived in correspondence with the well-known linear processing schemes {{in the fields of}} <b>MUD</b> and array <b>processing,</b> including minimum mean-square error (MMSE), minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR), minimum power distortionless response (MPDR) and maximum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (MSINR), respectively. Furthermore, the physical principles behind the considered MUT schemes are explained with the aid of the concepts built in this contribution. In order to gain insight into the effect of noise power on the achievable performance of a MUT scheme, a noise-suppression factor is introduced to those MUT schemes, such as MMSE, requiring the knowledge of noise variance. Our study shows that the achievable performance of the MUT is generally loosely depended on the noise-suppression factor. This finding may result in extremely low-complexity wireless transceivers in time-division duplex (TDD) cellular systems, where the uplink MUD and downlink MUT can be implemented based on one adaptive signal processing scheme...|$|R
