40|$|We {{report a}} {{computer}} simulation of the visuospatial delayed-response experiments of Funahashi et al. (1989), using a firing-rate model that combines intrinsic cellular bistability with the recurrent local network {{architecture of the}} neocortex. In our model, the visuospatial working memory is stored {{in the form of}} a continuum of network activity profiles that coexist with a spontaneous activity state. These neuronal firing patterns provide a population code for the cue position in a graded manner. We show that neuronal persistent activity and tuning curves of delay-period activity (<b>memory</b> <b>fields)</b> can be generated by an excitatory feedback circuit and recurrent synaptic inhibition. However, if the <b>memory</b> <b>fields</b> are constructed solely by network mechanisms, noise may induce a random drift over time in the encoded cue position, so that the working memory storage becomes unreliable. Furthermore, a "distraction" stimulus presented during the delay period produces a systematic shift in the encoded cue position. We found that the working memory performance can be rendered robust against noise and distraction stimuli if single neurons are endowed with cellular bistability (presumably due to intrinsic ion channel mechanisms) that is conditional and realized only with sustained synaptic inputs from the recurrent network. We discuss how cellular bistability at the single cell level may be detected by analysis of spike trains recorded during delay-period activity and how local modulation of intrinsic cell properties and/or synaptic transmission can alter the <b>memory</b> <b>fields</b> of individual neurons in the prefrontal cortex...|$|R

50|$|In {{addition}} to the enormous usage of neurostimulation for clinical applications, it is also used widely in laboratories started dates back to 1920s by people link Delgado who used stimulation as an experimental manipulation to study basics of how the brain works. The primary works were on the reward center of the brain in which stimulation of those structures led to pleasure that requested more stimulation. Another most recent example is the electrical stimulation of the MT area of primary visual cortex to bias perception. In particular, the directionality of motion is represented in a regular way in the MT area. They presented monkeys with moving images on screen and monkey throughput was to determine what the direction is. They found that by systematically introducing some errors to the monkey's responses, by stimulating the MT area {{which is responsible for}} perceiving the motion in another direction, the monkey responded to somewhere in between the actual motion and the stimulated one. This was an elegant use of stimulation to show that MT area is essential in the actual perception of motion. Within the <b>memory</b> <b>field,</b> stimulation is used very frequently to test the strength of the connection between one bundle of cells to another by applying a small current in one cell which results in the release of neurotransmitters and measuring the postsynaptic potential.|$|E

40|$|The {{hippocampus}} {{is necessary}} for normal memory in rodents, birds, monkeys, and people. Damage to the hippocampus can result in the inability to learn new facts, defined by the relationship among stimuli. In rodents, spatial learning involves learning about the relationships among stimuli, and exemplifies the kind of learning the requires the hippocampus. Therefore, understanding the neural mechanisms underlying spatial learning may elucidate basic memory processes. Many hippocampal neurons fire when behaving rats, cats, or monkeys are in circumscribed regions (place fields) of an environment. The neurons, called place cells, fire in relation to distal stimuli, but can persist in signaling location when the stimuli are removed or lights are turned off (<b>memory</b> <b>fields).</b> In this thesis, computational models of spatial information processing simulated many of the defining properties of hippocampal place cells, including <b>memory</b> <b>fields.</b> Furthermore, the models suggested a neurally plausible mechanism of goal directed spatial navigation which involved the encoding of distances in the connections between place cells. To navigate using <b>memory</b> <b>fields,</b> the models required an excitatory, distributed, and plastic association system among place cells. Such properties are well characterized in area CA 3 of the hippocampus. In this thesis, a new electrophysiological study provides evidence that a second system in the dentate gyrus has similar properties. Thus, two circuits in the hippocampus {{meet the requirements of}} the models. Some predictions of the models were then tested in a single-unit recording experiment in behaving rats. Place fields were more likely to occur in information rich areas of the environment, and removal of single cues altered place fields in a way consistent with the distance encoding mechanism suggested by the models. It was concluded that a distance encoding theory of rat spatial navigation has much descriptive and predictive utility, but most of its predi...|$|R

The more a spin {{has been in a}} given state, the less the spin-flip probability is. We numerically studied the growth and persistence properties of such a system on a two dimensional square lattice. The memory introduces energy barriers which freeze the system at zero temperature. At finite temperature we can observe an apparent arrest of coarsening for low temperature and long memory length. However, since the energy barriers introduced by memory are due to local effects, there exists a timescale on which coarsening takes place as for the Ising model. Moreover the two point correlation functions of the Ising model with and without memory are the same, indicating that they belong to the same universality class. ...|$|E

40|$|Dorsolateral {{prefrontal cortex}} has an {{essential}} role in the cognitive process of working memory, dysfunction of which {{is considered to be a}} core deficit in schizophrenia. Although this cortical region is densely innervated with 5 -HT 2 A receptors to which atypical antipsychotic drugs bind with high affinity, little is known of the influence of this serotonin receptor subtype on prefrontal function. We addressed this issue by examining the effects of iontophoresis of selective receptor ligands on prefrontal neurons possessing spatially tuned delay activity, or “memory fields, ” in monkeys performing a delayed-response task. <b>Memory</b> <b>fields</b> of putative pyramidal cells were attenuated by iontophoresis of 5 -HT 2 A antagonists, which primarily produced a reduction in delay activity for preferred target locations. Conversely, 5 -HT 2 A stimulation by �-methyl- 5 -HT or 5 -HT itself, accentuated the spatial tuning of these neurons by producing a modest increase in activity for preferred target locations and/or a reduction in activity for nonpreferred locations. The agonist effects could be reversed by the selective antagonist MDL 100, 907, and were dose-dependent, such that high levels attenuated spatial tuning by profoundly reducing delay activity. A role for feedforward inhibitory circuitry in these effects was supported by the finding that 5 -HT 2 A blockade also attenuated the <b>memory</b> <b>fields</b> of putative interneurons. We conclude that prefrontal 5 -HT 2 A receptors have a hitherto unrecognized role in the cognitive function of working memory, which involves actions at both excitatory and inhibitory elements within local circuitry.
