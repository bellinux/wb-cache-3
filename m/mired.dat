40|$|This book {{presents}} a transect of Finnish <b>mire</b> nature from Forest Lapland {{in the north}} to the hemiboreal <b>mires</b> on the southern coast of Finland. It has been compiled {{in connection with the}} International <b>Mire</b> Conservation Group field symposium in Finland in July 2006, and it gives an overview of the biodiversity of Finnish <b>mires</b> on <b>mire</b> system, massif, site and species levels as well as about the ecology, utilization, conservation and restoration of Finnish <b>mires.</b> A special topic is the primary succession of <b>mires</b> on the land uplift coast of the Bothnian Bay, which is a globally unique phenomenon in the boreal zone. Most of the <b>mires</b> presented here are protected as national parks or <b>mire</b> reserves. Thus this book gives a positive view over Finnish <b>mires.</b> We must remember, however, that about 75 % of Finnish <b>mires</b> have been destroyed by forestry drainage, agriculture, peat mining or reservoir building. The aim of this book is to emphasize the great diversity and high conservation value of Finnish <b>mires.</b> During the compiling of this book it was revealed that despite a long <b>mire</b> research tradition and intensive inventories conducted in nature reserves recently, we know surprisingly little about our <b>mires.</b> This emphasizes the importance of <b>mire</b> research in Finland - land of <b>mires...</b>|$|R

5|$|Since {{the early}} 20th century, {{excavations}} at the La Brea Tar Pits in Los Angeles have yielded 100 tonnes of fossils from 600 species of flora and fauna, including several Columbian mammoths. Many of the fossils are {{the remains of}} animals that became stuck in asphalt puddles which seeped {{to the surface of}} the pits, 40,000 to 11,500 years ago. Dust and leaves likely concealed the liquid asphalt, which then trapped unwary animals. <b>Mired</b> animals died from hunger or exhaustion; their corpses attracted predators, which sometimes became stuck themselves. The tar pits' fossil record is dominated by the remains of predators, such as large canids and felids. Fossils of different animals are found stuck together when they are excavated from the pits. The tar pits do not preserve soft tissue, and a 2014 study concluded that asphalt may degrade the DNA of animals <b>mired</b> in it after an attempt was made to extract DNA from a Columbian mammoth.|$|E

40|$|We {{examined}} how hydrology influenced water chemistry, vegetation, nutrient status, aboveground {{net primary production}} (ANPP) and litter decomposition rates in two <b>mires</b> on the South-Eastern Alps of Italy. One of the <b>mires</b> had a modest hydraulic gradient and prevalently acted as a recharge system, although there were short phases of vertical flow reversal during dry periods. This <b>mire</b> was, therefore, prevalently fed by rainwater and was covered by bog-like vegetation, mainly hummocks and scrubs with a ground layer rich in Sphagnum mosses. The other <b>mire</b> presented a steeper hydraulic gradient, with the surface being fed by mineral water either by surface runoff or by vertical, upwards directed ground water flow. Compared to the bog-dominated <b>mire,</b> the pore water was less acidic and richer in telluric cations. This <b>mire</b> was covered by fen-like vegetation, prevalently fen meadows. Nitrogen (N) content in the vegetation was very similar in the two <b>mire</b> sites, while phosphorus (P) content was lower in the fen-dominated site. Contrary to our expectations, ANPP {{did not differ significantly}} between the two <b>mire</b> sites while litter decomposition rates were significantly lower in the fen-dominated <b>mire,</b> presumably because of P limitation of decomposers. This suggests that the development of ombrogenous <b>mires</b> in this region need not be due to increased accumulation of peat during succession from mineralwater-fed to rainwater-fed conditions...|$|R

40|$|As an {{important}} {{dissolved organic carbon}} (DOC) reservoir, the <b>mires</b> in the Sanjiang Plain, Northeast China, have been suffering from large scale of reclamation, and thus elevated loss and degradation since the 1960 s. This study compares the export dynamics of the dissolved carbons, {{as well as the}} chemical characteristics of DOC, in the natural <b>mire,</b> degraded <b>mire</b> and drainage ditches during the growing seasons from 2008 to 2010 with the aim to clarify the final effects of the longterm reclamation on the export dynamics of the dissolved carbons. Results show that the average concentrations of total dissolved carbon (TC) and DOC are much higher in natural <b>mires</b> than that in degraded <b>mire</b> and drainage ditches. The DOC concentration for natural <b>mires,</b> about 35. 53 ± 5. 15 mg l− 1 on average, is nearly 2. 39 times of that in degraded <b>mire</b> (14. 84 ± 4. 21 mg l− 1 ) and 2. 77 times of the average value in ditches (12. 84 ± 4. 49 mg l− 1 ). Similarly, the hydrophobic fraction and SUVA 254 of DOC also represent lower values in the degraded <b>mire</b> and ditches, which suggests that <b>mire</b> reclamation has resulted not only in the reduced DOC concentrations but also in the reduced chemical stability. Whereas the inorganic dissolved carbons (DIC) exhibits obvious increased trends in drainage ditches in comparison to natural <b>mires.</b> Analyses of exitation-emission fluorescence spectra reveal that the reclamation has greatly altered the DOC composition with more biological organic substances exporting from the Sanjiang Plain. The presence of protein- and tryptophan-like substances in the ditches indicates there has been extensive agricultural pollution in the surface waters. Changes in the hydrological regime of the <b>mire</b> landscapes by sustained agriculture activities are deemed the prodominant reason, and the trends in the export dynamics of dissolved carbons will keep on if <b>mire</b> reclamation continues in the future...|$|R
40|$|In 2007, a {{field visit}} {{by members of}} the International <b>Mire</b> Conservation Group (IMCG) to the Atlantic coast of Peninsula Mitre (the easternmost part of Isla Grande de Tierra del Fuego, Argentina) {{gathered}} information on <b>mire</b> diversity in this remote wild area with largely pristine <b>mires.</b> Our expedition showed that Peninsula Mitre hosts a wide variety of habitats across two exciting ecological gradients: (i) a regional west-east gradient from Sphagnum magellanicum dominated <b>mires</b> in the west to Astelia pumila dominated <b>mires</b> in the east; and (ii) a gradient from extremely acid to extremely carbonate rich <b>mire</b> types induced by local bedrock. The large variety of hydromorphological <b>mire</b> types comprises raised bogs, blanket bogs, sloping fens, string fens, flat fens and calcareous spring fens. In the Atlantic coastal area, the abundance of Sphagnum magellanicum in the ombrogenic systems decreases conspicuously from west to east with the species being almost absent in the east. However, the fossil record shows thick layers of Sphagnum peat close beneath <b>mire</b> surfaces everywhere, indicating that substantial hydrological and ecological changes have taken place in the recent past. We observed large scale erosion in the <b>mires</b> along the Atlantic coast. Locally, well-developed fen systems are present, including calcareous spring fens with active travertine (tufa) deposition. The regional vegetation can be regarded as a parallel to that of boreal oceanic regions in the northern hemisphere. The <b>mires</b> and peatlands of the peninsula are of global significance. They are impressive, peculiar, extensive and largely pristine <b>mires</b> in a globally very rare climatic and biogeographical context embedded in a landscape with significant natural dynamics. The damaging impact of free-roaming cattle on the <b>mires</b> and upland vegetation is, however, conspicuous and needs urgent attention.

40|$|The major {{environmental}} gradients underlying plant species distribution were outlined in two climatically and biogeographically contrasting mires: a Swedish bog in the boreo-nemoral zone, and an Italian bog in the south-eastern Alps. Data on <b>mire</b> morphology, surface hydrology, ﬂoristic composition, peat chemistry and pore-water chemistry were collected along transects from the <b>mire</b> margin (i. e., the outer {{portion of the}} <b>mire</b> {{in contact with the}} surrounding mineral soil) towards the <b>mire</b> expanse (i. e., the inner portion of the <b>mire).</b> The delimitation and the extent of the minerotrophic <b>mire</b> margin were related to the steepness of the lateral <b>mire</b> slope which, in turns, controls the direction of surface water ﬂow. The mineral soil water limit was mirrored in geochemical variables such as pH, alkalinity, Ca 2 +, Mg 2 +, Al 3 +, Mn 2 +, and SiO 2 concentrations in pore-water, as well as Ca, Al, Fe, N and P contents in surface peat. Depending on regional requirements of plant species, different species were useful as fen limit indicators at the two sites. The main environmental factors affecting distribution of habitat types and plant species in the two <b>mires</b> were the acidity-alkalinity gradient, and the gradient in depth to the water table. The <b>mire</b> margin - <b>mire</b> expanse gradient corresponds to a complex gradient mainly reﬂected in a differentiation of vegetation structure in relation to the aeration of the peat substrate...|$|R
