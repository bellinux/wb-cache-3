40|$|This paper {{develops}} a stock-flow consistent macrodynamic {{model in which}} firms’ and banks’ desired <b>margins</b> <b>of</b> safety {{play a central role}} in macroeconomic performance. The model incorporates an active banking sector and pays particular attention to the leverage of both firms and banks. It is shown that the endogenous change in the desired <b>margins</b> <b>of</b> safety of firms and banks is likely to transform an otherwise stable debt-burdened economy into an unstable one. The endogeneity <b>of</b> the desired <b>margins</b> <b>of</b> safety can also produce, under certain conditions, investment and leverage cycles during which investment and leverage move both in the same and in the opposite direction. Furthermore, the paper investigates the potential stabilising role of fiscal policy. It is indicated that fiscal policy can reduce the destabilising forces in the macroeconomy when government expenditures adjust adequately to variations in the divergence between the actual and the desired <b>margins</b> <b>of</b> safety...|$|R
