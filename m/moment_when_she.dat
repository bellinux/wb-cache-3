Bacon kept a close-up still of the screaming nurse, at the <b>moment</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> has {{been shot in the}} eye. He referred to the still in paintings throughout his career.|$|E

After the collapse of her employers, Nina no longer required a viable reason to pursue her target. It was also revealed that she remained emotionally impassive about the discovery of her biological son, but the fact that she did not kill him when the chance presented itself shows otherwise for some.|$|E

500|$|Oliver Sava of The A.V. Club graded {{the episode}} a 'B+', {{feeling that the}} series was [...] "getting better with each new episode, and now that it’s been picked up for a full season, I’m {{genuinely}} excited {{to see where the}} show goes from here. “Eye Spy” is a big step in the right direction, delving further into the history of these characters while laying groundwork for future stories. S.H.I.E.L.D. doesn’t need superheroes to be a captivating TV series, and making sure the human elements are developed {{is the best way to}} guarantee the show’s success." [...] He felt that Armand [...] "does impressive work depicting the mental toll of Akela’s experience, and her intensity early in the episode makes for a poignant final <b>moment</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> lays down in her prison cell, finally at peace after years of torment." [...] Eric Goldman of IGN scored the episode 7.9 out of 10, praising the [...] "darker and edgier elements" [...] of the episode, the Akela/May fight, and Ward's storyline, pointing out that [...] "some viewers have found [...] to be dull. I actually quite enjoyed Ward’s material in the pilot, and this episode was an especially nice spotlight for him ... He got some nice action beats along the way and one of the funnier moments of the episode". He did, however, criticize the fact that half of the team members are unready for combat, stating [...] "3 out of 6 team members being unready for combat is 2 too many." ...|$|E
500|$|When an {{interviewer}} {{asked him to}} describe himself as a child, he replied that he was [...] "probably well-meaning and naive like all kids." [...] His passion for sea life {{can be traced to}} his childhood, when several films by French oceanographer Jacques Cousteau made a strong impression on him. He has said that Cousteau [...] "provided a view into that world", which he did not know existed. He liked to explore tide pools as a child, bringing home objects that [...] "should have been left there and that ended up dying and smelling really bad." [...] Also at a young age, Hillenburg developed his interest in art. His first drawing was of an orange slice. An illustration that he drew in third grade depicting [...] "a bunch of army men... kissing and hugging instead of fighting" [...] marked the first praise that he received for his work after his teacher commended it. [...] "Of course, this is 1970... She liked it because, I mean, obviously that {{was in the middle of}} [...] She was, I would imagine, not a hundred percent for the war like a lot of people then. ...I had no idea about the implications, really, because I just thought it was a funny idea. I remember that still, that <b>moment</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> said, 'oh my gosh, look at that,'" [...] Hillenburg elaborated. It was then when he knew that he [...] "had some [...] skill". Hillenburg asserted that his artistry comes from his mother's side, despite his father being a draftsman, noting that his maternal grandmother was [...] "really, really gifted" [...] and a [...] "great painter". In the 1970s, someone took him to the International Tournée of Animation at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. Hillenburg was [...] "knocked out" [...] by the foreign animated films that were screened at the festival, including Dutch animator Paul Driessen's The Killing of an Egg (1977). [...] "That was the film that I thought was uniquely strange and that lodged itself in my head early on," [...] he recounted.|$|E

2500|$|Martin Luther, who {{initiated}} the Protestant Reformation, said: [...] "Mother Mary, like us, {{was born in}} sin of sinful parents, but the Holy Spirit covered her, sanctified and purified her so that this child was born of flesh and blood, but not with sinful flesh and blood. The Holy Spirit permitted the Virgin Mary to remain a true, natural human being of flesh and blood, just as we. However, he warded off sin from her flesh and blood so that she became {{the mother of a}} pure child, not poisoned by sin as we are. For in that <b>moment</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> conceived, she was a holy mother filled with the Holy Spirit and her fruit is a holy pure fruit, at once God and truly man, in one person."
