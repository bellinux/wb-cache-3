6000|$|... "Voluntarily!" [...] {{repeated}} Caroline; [...] "I am sure <b>my</b> <b>will</b> <b>had</b> {{very little}} to do with it. I found myself in the midst of it, without knowing how, before I had made up my mind one way or the other. O, Marian! if you had but been with me that morning." ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{doctor was}} about to speak, but Sir Richmond {{interrupted}} him. [...] "What's got hold of me? What's got hold of me? I used to work well enough. It's as if <b>my</b> <b>will</b> <b>had</b> come untwisted and was ravelling out into separate strands. I've lost my unity. I'm not a man but a mob. I've got to recover my vigour. At any cost." ...|$|E
60|$|No. <b>My</b> <b>will</b> <b>had</b> {{nothing to}} do with it. Indeed, no sooner had I made that fateful noise than I became {{extremely}} sorry for it. Had the man stopped and faced me I would have had to retire in disorder. For I had no notion to carry out Captain Giles' idiotic joke, either at my own expense or {{at the expense of the}} Steward.|$|E
5000|$|In {{spite of}} Daphne’s rejection, Apollo vowed {{to love her}} forever: “Always <b>my</b> hair <b>will</b> <b>have</b> you, <b>my</b> lyres <b>will</b> <b>have</b> you, <b>my</b> quivers <b>will</b> <b>have</b> you, laurel tree. You will be present to two Latin places, when the happy voice will sing a triumph and they will visit the great ceremonies at the Capitoline Hill.” ...|$|R

6000|$|He {{lay there}} {{in silence for}} a while, still quickly breathing, Then started up and walked about the room resentfully: [...] "O woman, witch, whom I, in sooth, against <b>my</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> wedded, [...] Why castedst thou thy spells on me? ...|$|R
6000|$|To {{this day}} I don't know {{what made me}} call after him. [...] "I say! Wait a minute." [...] Perhaps it was the sidelong glance he gave me; or {{possibly}} I was yet {{under the influence of}} Captain Giles' mysterious earnestness. Well, it was an impulse of some sort; an effect of that force somewhere within our lives which shapes them this way or that. For if these words had not escaped from my lips (<b>my</b> <b>will</b> <b>had</b> nothing to do with that) my existence would, to be sure, have been still a seaman's existence, but directed on now to me utterly inconceivable lines.|$|E
60|$|Eliz. Lewis, I am too happy! {{floating}} higher Than e'er <b>my</b> <b>will</b> <b>had</b> {{dared to}} soar, though able; But circumstance, {{which is the}} will of God, Beguiled my cowardice to that, which, darling, I found most natural, when I feared it most. Love {{would have had no}} strangeness in mine eyes, Save from the prejudice which others taught me-- They should know best. Yet now this wedlock seems A second infancy's baptismal robe, A heaven, my spirit's antenatal home, Lost in blind pining girlhood--found now, found! [Aside] What have I said? Do I blaspheme? Alas! I neither made these thoughts, nor can unmake them.|$|E
60|$|These {{pages are}} not the record of my wanderings and my dangers away from home. The motives which led me from my country and my friends to a new world of {{adventure}} and peril are known. From that self-imposed exile I came back, as I had hoped, prayed, believed I should come back--a changed man. In the waters of a new life I had tempered my nature afresh. In the stern school of extremity and danger <b>my</b> <b>will</b> <b>had</b> learnt to be strong, my heart to be resolute, my mind to rely on itself. I had gone out to fly from my own future. I came back to face it, as a man should.|$|E

60|$|I don't {{remember}} how I answered him. In {{spite of the}} superficiality of his own arguments, which I was not learned enough to detect, I was ingloriously routed. Darwin had kicked over the bucket, {{and that was all}} there was to it.... After we had left the club both Conybear and Laurens admitted they were somewhat disturbed, declaring that Ralph had gone too far. I spent a miserable night, recalling the naturalistic assertions he had made so glibly, asking myself again and again how it was that the religion to which I so vainly clung had no greater effect on my actions and on <b>my</b> <b>will,</b> <b>had</b> not prevented me from lapses into degradation. And I hated myself for having argued upon a subject that was still sacred. I believed in Christ, {{which is to say that}} I believed that in some inscrutable manner he existed, continued to dominate the world and had suffered on my account.|$|E
6000|$|Well, I {{could never}} have loved him, but when he sought me and [...] asked me,-- [...] When to the men that offered their lives, {{the love of a}} woman [...] Seemed so little to give!--I promised the love that he asked me, [...] Sent him to war with my kiss on his lips, and thought him my hero. [...] Afterward came the doubt, and out of long question, self-knowledge,-- [...] Came that great defeat, and the heart of the nation was withered; [...] Mine leaped high with the awful relief won of death. But the [...] horror, [...] Then, of the crime that was wrought in that guilty moment of [...] rapture,-- [...] Guilty as if <b>my</b> <b>will</b> <b>had</b> winged the bullet that struck him,-- [...] Clung to me day and night, and dreaming I saw him forever, [...] Looking through battle-smoke with sorrowful eyes of upbraiding, [...] Or, in the {{moonlight}} lying gray, or dimly approaching, [...] Holding toward me his arms, that still held nearer and nearer, [...] Folded about me at last ... and I would I had died in the fever!-- [...] Better then than now, and better than ever hereafter! ...|$|E
60|$|I {{was still}} in the room, seated in the chair. I had on my {{respirator}} and knew that I breathed freely. The Nurse sat in her chair with her back toward me. She sat quite still. The sick man lay as still as the dead. It was rather like the picture of a scene than the reality; all were still and silent; and the stillness and silence were continuous. Outside, in the distance I could hear the sounds of a city, the occasional roll of wheels, the shout of a reveller, the far-away echo of whistles and the rumbling of trains. The light was very, very low; the reflection of it under the green-shaded lamp was a dim relief to the darkness, rather than light. The green silk fringe of the lamp had merely the colour of an emerald seen in the moonlight. The room, for all its darkness, was full of shadows. It seemed in my whirling thoughts as though all the real things had become shadows--shadows which moved, for they passed the dim outline of the high windows. Shadows which had sentience. I even thought there was sound, a faint sound as of the mew of a cat--the rustle of drapery and a metallic clink as of metal faintly touching metal. I sat as one entranced. At last I felt, as in nightmare, that this was sleep, and that in the passing of its portals all <b>my</b> <b>will</b> <b>had</b> gone.|$|E

6000|$|... "Shall I {{tell you}} what it is I lack?" [...] he {{answered}} suddenly. [...] "Incentive. I think <b>my</b> <b>will</b> <b>has</b> suddenly grown flabby, the ego in me unresponsive. You know the moods in which one asks oneself whether it is worth while, whether anything is worth while. Well, I am there at the crossroads. I think I feel more inclined to look for a seat than to go on." ...|$|R
