40|$|Determining how animals achieve {{seemingly}} complex behaviours {{is central}} {{to our understanding of}} the evolution of cognition. Complexity in behaviour is itself not sufficient for confirming a role for learning and memory. For example, although the nests some birds build appear structurally complex, they may, like the structures built by ants and termites, be achieved through relatively simple building processes. We attempted to use observations of nest building by male Southern <b>Masked</b> <b>Weavers</b> to determine whether one aspect of nest building, the completion of a nest, could be described usefully by either of two rule-based explanations that explain the construction of complex physical structures by invertebrates. The first possibility, stigmergy, is that birds use feedback from local nest cues to determine the building sequence and nest completion. The second possibility is that birds follow a stereotypical series of behaviours. We found that male Southern <b>Masked</b> <b>Weavers</b> returned to work on apparently complete nests even when they had begun to build a new nest. Neither stigmergy nor stereotypy explains our observations of nest building behaviour in Southern <b>Masked</b> <b>Weavers.</b> If weaverbirds do complete their nests using a set of rules, those rules are not the simple ones that have been used to describe building by invertebrates. This leaves open the possibility that learning and memory play a greater role in nest building than is currently thought to be the case...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical references. Patterns {{of renewal}} of {{feathers}} are poorly known in African birds. Moult is energetically costly {{and is thus}} {{an important part of}} a bird's annual cycle; moult needs to be fitted in with breeding activities, and in some species, migration. Ringers in southern Africa have been submitting primary moult data to SAFRING, the South African Bird Ringing Unit, since 1998, providing a large amount of data that the author has been curating and checking on an on-going basis as Ringing Coordinator. May main interest is in the weaverbirds and I have ringed several thousand Southern <b>Masked</b> <b>Weavers</b> Ploceus velatus and many other species. Les Underhill and Walter Zucchini developed a statistical model to analyse timing and duration of primary moult in a standardized way in 1988.

40|$|Nest {{building}} in birds {{has long been}} {{assumed to be a}} behaviour that is not learned, despite suggestive evidence to the contrary. In this thesis I investigated the role of learning in nest {{building in}} birds. I focused primarily on the choice of nest material made by zebra finches, in particular between two or more colours of nesting material. Using this aspect of behaviour, I found that adult nest building birds changed their preference for a particular colour of nesting material depending on their own nesting and breeding experience: males that built a nest using material of their less preferred colour later preferred that colour following a successful breeding attempt in that nest. In contrast to this role for learning in adults, in two other experiments I found no evidence that juvenile birds learned about the nest from which they had fledged or that birds learned about what material to nest with from conspecifics. Using wild Southern <b>masked</b> <b>weavers,</b> I also addressed variability in a particular aspect of nest building: the attachment of the very first blade of grass knotted onto a branch. I found that birds did not construct the same attachment each time they did it, even when building at the same location, but that males generally used more loops in their attachments as they built more nests, and when using longer pieces of grass. Finally, I tested zebra finches on a nest building ‘task’, using a paradigm often used to test cognitive abilities among tool-users. Birds were presented with two lengths of nest material, one of which was more appropriate for one of two sizes of nest box entrance. I found that nesting birds could choose the appropriate length of material and that the birds’ handling of material and their choice of material changed with experience. Taking these results together, it seems that there is a greater role for learning in nest construction than is generally acknowledged and that nest building might involve the same underlying cognitive processes as tool manufacture and use...|$|R

40|$|It is {{generally}} assumed that birds build nests {{according to a}} genetic ‘template’, little influenced by learning or memory. One way to confirm the role of genetics in nest building is to assess the repeatability of nest morphology with repeated nest attempts. Solitary weaver birds, which build multiple nests in a single breeding season, are a useful group with which to do this. Here we show that repeatability of nest morphology was low, but significant, in male Southern <b>Masked</b> <b>weaver</b> birds and not significant in the Village weavers. The larger bodied Village weavers built larger nests than did Southern Masked weavers, but body size did not explain variation in Southern <b>Masked</b> <b>weaver</b> nest dimensions. Nests built by the same male in both species got shorter and lighter as more nests were constructed. While these data demonstrate {{the potential for a}} genetic component of variation in nest building in solitary weavers, {{it is also clear that}} there remains plenty of scope in both of these species for experience to shape nest construction...|$|E
40|$|The {{cellular}} {{composition of}} the testicular capsule, seminiferous peritubular tissue, the epithelia as well as periductal muscle cell layers of the excurrent ducts was studied, in sexually mature and active <b>Masked</b> <b>Weaver</b> (Ploceus velatus) birds of the passerine family, Ploceidae. Ultrastructure of the contractile cells in the testicular capsule, peritubular and periductal tissues showed that these cells were smooth muscles of typical morphological characteristics. Variability in the immunohistochemical co-expression of microfilaments and intermediate filaments in the different tissues was evident. Actin and desmin proteins were co-expressed immunohistochemically in the testicular capsule and seminiferous peritubular smooth muscle layer. Actin was singly and very weakly expressed in the rete testis epithelium while cytokeratins and desmin were co-expressed in the epithelium of the excurrent ducts. The periductal muscle layer of all ducts of the epididymis, the ductus deferens {{as well as the}} seminal glomus, strongly co-expressed actin and desmin. Vimentin was absent in all cells and tissue types studied. There is clear evidence that the tissues of the male gonad and its excurrent ducts in the <b>Masked</b> <b>Weaver,</b> as has been reported for members of the Galloanserae and Ratitae, contain well-formed contractile tissues whose function would include the transportation of luminal through-flow from the testis into, and through, its excurrent ducts. The microtubule helix in the head and of the mid-piece, of elongating spermatids, {{as well as of the}} mature spermatozoa in the various excurrent ducts, including some spermatozoa in the seminal glomus, also co-expressed these three proteins.

40|$|In this radio broadcast, Dieter Oschadleus {{discusses}} weavers, from nest-building {{patterns to}} {{the different kinds of}} weavers (<b>masked</b> <b>weaver,</b> widow and bishop birds, and sparrow weavers, scaly-feathered finch, etc.) and their respective habitats. Weaver nest sites also attract a variety of predators (snakes, birds of prey) and obligate nesters such as the pygmy falcon who do not create their own nests, and thus weaver sites create their own ecologies through provision of shade and concentration of droppings. Citizen scientists can get involved by photographs of weaver sites which are then used to build up a database of weaver sites which provide demographic information very useful to avian zoologists.

40|$|The {{fate of the}} {{proximal}} centriole in passeridan birds {{is an area of}} controversy and relative lack of knowledge in avian spermatogenesis and spermatology. This study examines, for the first time, spatiotemporal changes in the centriolar complex in various phases of spermiogenesis in a passerine bird, the <b>Masked</b> <b>weaver</b> (Ploceus velatus). It also describes the configuration of the centriolar complex and the relationship between it and the granular body in both intra- and extra-testicular spermatozoa. It is shown that {{the proximal}} centriole is retained and attaches, at its free end, to the granular body of spermatids in every step of spermiogenesis, as well as in mature intra-testicular and post-testicular spermatozoa, including those in the lumen of the seminal glomus. As the centriolar complex, along with its attached granular body, approaches the nucleus in the early spermatid, the proximal centriole articulates with the distal centriole at an acute angle of about 45 ◦, and thereafter, both centrioles, still maintaining this conformation, implant, by means of their articulating proximal ends, at the implantation fossa of the nucleus. In the mature spermatid and spermatozoon, the granular body winds itself helically around the centriolar complex in the neck/midpiece region of the cell, and, thus, becomes the granular helix. The significance of this observation must await future studies, including possible phylogenetic re-evaluation and classification of birds. [URL]...|$|E
40|$|M. Sc. The {{recognition}} of the occurrence, importance and effects of contaminants on food chains and ecosystems {{has led to the}} development of biomonitoring programmes that use indicator species to estimate the levels in other parts of the ecosystem. There has been an increased awareness of potential pollution of ecosystems in Gauteng, South Africa, because of increased formal and informal urbanization, industrialization and mining activities. It is essential to obtain clear indications of metal pollution cause-effect relationships at ecosystem level in order to carry out effective management of these ecosystems. The objective was to investigate the application of an ecotoxicologically-based investigation of metals in selected bird species as bioindicators of metal pollution of ecosystems in Gauteng. Three passerine species were used, the Southern <b>Masked</b> <b>Weaver</b> (Ploceus velatus), the Red Bishop (Euplectes orix) and the Red-billed Quelea (Quelea quelea). The sites were selected to represent a theoretical pollution gradient from severely contaminated wetlands in the Vaal Triangle, to moderately contaminated wetlands in the Witwatersrand and Pretoria. A nature reserve in North West Province was chosen as reference site. The sites were Rietvlei in Tshwane, Roodekrans and Olifantsvlei in Johannesburg, Holfontein in the Vaal Triangle and Barberspan in North West Province. Two sampling surveys were carried out, one in 2002 and one in 2005. Feathers were collected for metal analyses. Blood samples were collected for biomarker (oxidative stress and DNA damage) and haematological analyses. The samples were digested using the microwave destruction technique. The metal analyses were carried out using ICP-MS. Oxidative stress enzymes (reduced glutathione content and catalase activity) were analysed in plasma samples and DNA damage was evaluated in red blood cells using the average base-pair length comparisontechnique. Haematological studies were done on the blood samples. The results were compared between the sites and surveys. The levels of stress correlated well with the levels of metals in the feathers. Sites with higher metal levels had higher levels of organism stress. Thus the study showed that the feathers can indeed be used in biomonitoring. Internationally there is a trend to incorporate Ecological Quality Objectives (EcoQOs) into legislation, especially when dealing with metal contamination. Within the framework of EcoQOs developed for birds the monitoring of contaminants forms a specific category of EcoQOs. However, due to a lack of available data, Reference and Target Levels still need to be set. The development of EcoQOs is especially important at this stage in South Africa. The recently promulgated National Biodiversity Act (10 of 2004) specifically provides for the preparation of conservation plans for identified ecosystems that are important because of their goods and services that they provide. Since there is no management tool available at present to develop a suitable management plan, the setting of EcoQOs that are in line with international standards and practices will be of immeasurable value to implementing the Act. Feathers from museum specimens were used to determine the Reference Levels for the various metals in the feathers. The Target Levels were calculated from the Reference Levels. These were compared to the Current Levels and the EcoQOs were determined for the metal levels in the feathers in weaver in Gauteng, South Africa. Prof. V. Wepene...|$|E
