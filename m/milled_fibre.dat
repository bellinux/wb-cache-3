Starting from epoxy based systems {{suited for}} high temperatures, {{different}} dispersed materials, like aluminium particles, milled carbon and glass fibres {{were added to}} the polymeric matrix for Rapid Tooling applications. Aluminium is intended to increase the thermal conductivity of the tool, while the milled fibres improve the wear resistance of the composite tool. In this communication mathematical models for mechanical behaviour of these epoxy matrix composites are discussed. The research is essentially focused on the elastic modulus, because the properties related with the material failure are difficult to analyse due to the complexity of the mechanism that controls the failure of polymer based composite materials. Halpin-Tsai-Nielsen and Halpin-Tsai models were applied to the particulate filled and fibre reinforced epoxy systems, respectively. A critical analysis of the mismatches detected between the experimental and the theoretical values allowed us to propose a semi-empirical model more suited to the results obtained. Parameters related with the particle-matrix and fibre-matrix interface influence the mechanical behaviour of the particulate and <b>milled</b> <b>fibre</b> reinforced composites...|$|E

40|$|In {{the present}} work, <b>milled</b> carbon <b>fibre</b> with high {{mechanical}} properties {{was used to}} reinforce silicon carbide, and Csf/SiC multilayer composites were prepared by tape casting and pressureless sintering. The <b>milled</b> C <b>fibres</b> were firstly dispersed in solvents {{with the aid of}} dispersant (Triton X- 100) and then mixed with SiC slurry to make green Csf/SiC tapes to limit fibre breakage. The average length of C fibres slightly decreased with the increase of mixing time in the present duration, indicating that mixing the SiC slurry with the fibre-predispersed solution is an effective method for adding fibres with limited breakage. Fibres were homogeneously distributed in the tapes and tended to align fairly well along the tape casting direction. The relative density of the composite containing <b>milled</b> C <b>fibres</b> decreased with the fibre amount. The Csf/SiC multilayer composites demonstrated significant anisotropic shrinkage behaviour in different directions, while the addition of short C fibres hindered the shrinkage in the plane containing the fibres during sintering. Elastic modulus and bending strength decreased with increased porosity, which implies that bending properties are affected more significantly by residual porosity rather than fibres' propertie...|$|R

Hence, in this research it is was aimed to study the effect of NaOH pretreatment on the insoluble remaining lignin structures. Hereto, SCB <b>milled</b> <b>fibres</b> were pretreated using different dosages of NaOH at different temperatures and residence times. Of untreated SCB about 63 % of the lignin compounds were assigned as p-coumarates and ferulates, analysed by pyrolysis-GC/MS as 4 -vinyl phenol and 4 -vinyl guaiacol, and designated as non-core lignin (NCL) compounds. More severe NaOH pretreatments resulted in lower xylan and lower lignin recoveries in the insoluble residues. Especially, the relative abundance of NCL decreased and this decrease followed a linear trend with the decrease in xylan. Core lignin compounds, analysed as phenol, guaiacol and syringol, accumulated in the residues. The decrease in residual xylan and NCL correlated positively with the enzymatic hydrolysis of the residual glucan...|$|R

40|$|AbstractScoring of {{the outer}} layers of a {{workpiece}} with small engagement (ae) using circular saws is a well known method to avoid unwanted delamination of these layers, such as coatings of wooden particle boards. In edge <b>milling</b> <b>fibre</b> reinforced plastics (FRP), delamination also occurs in the top or bottom layer of the component and requires time intensive rework or scrapping of material. A combined process of scoring and milling is {{presented in this paper}} as a means to avoid delamination during machining of FRP structures such as aircraft carbon FRP parts. For the scoring process a diamond electroplated circular wheel is used. To guarantee a constant width of the scored slot, a constant depth of engagement is needed due to the shape of the grinding wheel. Therefore the profile of the scoring path on the workpiece surface is measured with respect to the machine coordinate system to correct a variation in the workpiece thickness and to compensate for uneven clamping. Next, the workpiece is scored with constant depth of engagement (ae,s 50 μm) at an increased feed velocity (vf,m = 4. 5 m/min). Without scoring, flawed workpiece edges have been obtained with cutting edge radii beyond rn > 23 μm (progressive uniform wear stage) and a feed velocity of vf,m = 1. 5 m/min. Hence, high performance cutting (HPC) edge milling of composites may be realized by an initial scoring step to fulfil quality requirements of the machined edges and simultaneously increase the tool life of the milling tool...|$|R

40|$|Fibre {{sourcing}} is {{a critical}} strategic question for all sawmills and pulpmills, but the degree of supply integration though long-term contracts and forest ownership varies widely. The purpose {{of this research was}} to investigate the extent to which forest-mill integration patterns {{can be explained by the}} transaction cost economics (TCE) theory. TCE theory holds that organizations will choose transaction governance forms that minimize transaction costs. The TCE factors expected to influence that choice can be grouped into three categories; transaction frequency, market uncertainty, and asset specificity. Interviews with various industry representatives suggested that factors from all three categories are relevant to the question of forest-mill integration. A survey was conducted of mills in New Zealand and Sweden, providing data on their supply mix and various TCE factors. Of an estimated population of approximately 450 mills, 136 mills were sampled and 88 responded to the survey. Fractional logit models were developed to explore the factors that may influence the integration decision. Considerable evidence was found for the importance of TCE factors in driving fibre supply integration. The evidence was strongest for factors related to asset specificity, including forest owner concentration and the specificity of a <b>mill's</b> <b>fibre</b> requirements. Transaction frequency appears less important; while integration was found to be significantly associated with the number of mills an organisation has within the supply basin, the influence of mill capacity was found to vary. There was weak evidence for the importance of uncertainty, and perhaps only through the impact of forest owner concentration on market conduct. Integration was found significantly higher for pulpmills than sawmills, and higher in Sweden than in New Zealand. The latter result is difficult to explain by TCE theory, and suggests that non-TCE factors play a significant role. Survey responses also indicated that non-TCE factors are important. Further research is required to enlarge the sample size and better understand the role of TCE factors in forest-mill integration...|$|R

40|$|Pulp {{and paper}} mills {{generate}} biosolids as {{a by-product of}} their effluent treatment systems. These biosolids show excellent potential as a soil conditioner. However, the detection of high levels of E. coli (10 2 to 105 CFU/gdw), {{in the absence of}} any significant fecal loading, has caused concern among effluent treatment system operators, land applicators and regulators. This research examines the sources and ecology of E. coli strains comprising the population of E. coli in the biosolids of an eastern Ontario pulp and paper mill by applying the molecular microbial source-tracking tool repetitive sequence-based polymerase chain reaction. Confirmed E. coli were successfully isolated from 2 forested sites, treated mill process feed water, storm effluent, <b>mill</b> <b>fibres,</b> wood chips, primary and secondary clarifier effluents and sludges, and biosolids. While laboratory isolates could be accurately distinguished from forest and industrial isolates, cluster and jackknife analyses were incapable of differentiating reliably among isolates from the forest, on-site inputs, effluent treatment system and biosolids (average rates of correct classification values ranged from 43. 9 % to 72. 9 %). No input could be excluded as a source of E. coli to the effluent treatment system. Many fingerprint types were unique to the primary and secondary clarifiers; however, only a subset of the fingerprint types recovered from the primary and secondary clarifiers were detected in the biosolids. This suggests that the E. coli strains found in mill biosolids were those able to survive the hot, desiccating conditions of dewatering. Highly similar fingerprint types (> 80 % similarity) were recovered repeatedly over an 8 -month period from the effluent treatment system (primary and secondary clarifiers) and biosolids. These results are consistent with growth within the effluent treatment system and biosolids, rather than fecal loading. Over a 3 -year period the pulp and paper mill effluent treatment system underwent large-scale changes, including a 50 % reduction in effluent volume upon the elimination of on-site pulping activities. New fingerprint types were detected in the biosolids following the restructuring, and the Shannon index of diversity increased. Disruption of established operating conditions could have opened niches, allowing new strains to colonize the mill effluent treatment system successfully...|$|R

40|$|Wood, {{composed}} of cellulose, lignin and hemicelluloses, {{is the main}} raw material used to produce cellulosic <b>fibres.</b> <b>Mills</b> producing cellulosic <b>fibres,</b> also called kraft mills, look {{very much like a}} “biorefinery ” plant: isolated cellulose is almost pure, and then exploited today mainly as paper; hemicelluloses and lignin are degraded and solubilised during the process as a very complex mixture, called “black liquor”, which is burnt in a recovery boiler. The heat thus produced covers largely the energy needs of the kraft mill, which may then become a net producer of electricity. The aim {{of this paper is to}} present two examples of research pathways aiming at enlarging the products portfolio a pulp mill could offer. The first example deals with the definition of hemicelluloses extraction from softwood, prior to its transformation into cellulosic paper pulp by the kraft process. The hemicelluloses fraction (in the case of softwood species, mainly {{composed of}} C 6 sugars) should be extracted in a relatively pure form, whereas the cellulose fraction would continue to be obtained as fibres for papermaking. Thus, lignin becomes the main component of the “black liquor ” and might continue to be used as fuel for the energy needs of the mill. The extracted hemicelluloses are hydrolysed into hexoses and then fermented into bio-ethanol. This type of second generation bio-ethanol should eventually substitute the first bio-ethanol generation produced today from food raw materials.

More ductile process failure was found for the epoxy after modification and significant improvements of E-modulus and tensile strength were evidenced when the MCF weight ratio was larger than 1. 5 %. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed that the failure mechanism of short MCFs pulled out from the epoxy matrix contributed to the enhancement of the mechanical performance of the epoxy. The electrical resistivity of the epoxy with MCF weight ratio of 5 % was reduced by at least four orders of magnitude compared to the original epoxy, due to the conductive network formed by MCFs.

Before <b>milling,</b> single <b>fibre</b> strength tests were conducted on silk fibres degummed under different conditions.
