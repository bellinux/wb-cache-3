5|$|Black's <b>majority</b> <b>opinion</b> in McCollum v. Board of Education (1948) {{held that}} the {{government}} could not provide religious instruction in public schools. In Torcaso v. Watkins (1961), he delivered an opinion which affirmed that the states could not use religious tests as qualifications for public office. Similarly, he authored the <b>majority</b> <b>opinion</b> in Engel v. Vitale (1962), which declared it unconstitutional for states to require the recitation of official prayers in public schools.|$|E
5|$|Harlan {{wrote the}} <b>majority</b> <b>opinion</b> Leary v. United States—a case that {{declared}} Marijuana Tax Act unconstitutional {{based on the}} Fifth Amendment protection against self-incrimination.|$|E
5|$|Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg {{wrote the}} <b>majority</b> <b>opinion,</b> which held that §8772 does not {{infringe}} on {{the separation of}} powers between the legislative and judicial branches of government, considering also that the law is an exercise of congressional authority regarding foreign affairs. Justice Anthony Kennedy, Justice Clarence Thomas, Justice Stephen Breyer, Justice Samuel Alito, and Justice Elena Kagan joined the <b>majority</b> <b>opinion</b> (however, Justice Thomas did not join as to Part II-C of the opinion).|$|E

5|$|The four Democratic judges concurred on the <b>majority</b> <b>opinion.</b> Two Republican judges, in a {{separate}} opinion, concurred with the <b>majority</b> <b>opinion,</b> but declared that Taylor and Marshall had been done an irreparable injustice. The lone dissent, authored by the court's third Republican, held that the contest board had acted outside its legal authority. Republicans turned to the Supreme Court of the United States as their final option.|$|E
5|$|The <b>majority</b> <b>opinion</b> by Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. {{recognized}} the Oneida's federal common law cause of action, and rejected all the counties' affirmative defenses.|$|E
5|$|The <b>majority</b> <b>opinion</b> {{says that}} Justice Scalia's {{argument}} concerning the jurisdiction-stripping statute (section 1005e(1)) ignores the effective date provision {{of that very}} statute (section 1005(h)).|$|E
50|$|The Court {{answered}} {{both questions}} in the negative. There were two <b>majority</b> <b>opinions</b> in the case, written by Gérard La Forest and Beverley McLachlin, with Claire L'Heureux-Dubé and Charles Gonthier concurring with both. Both <b>majority</b> <b>opinions</b> referred to Kindler v. Canada (1991), where the Court considered the same question and {{found that there was}} no Charter violation.|$|R
50|$|While on the Court, Richardson wrote 212 dissenting <b>opinions</b> and 182 <b>majority</b> <b>opinions.</b>|$|R
50|$|During {{his court}} tenure, Fournet participated in some 17,500 cases and wrote 1,239 opinions. Of these, 1,043 were <b>majority</b> <b>opinions.</b> Of the 525 rehearings sought from his opinions, only 19 {{obtained}} a rehearing. Of those, just seven were reversed. Of his <b>majority</b> <b>opinions,</b> only forty-one were {{appealed to the}} United States Supreme Court; nine were granted, and four were reversed.|$|R
5|$|The <b>majority</b> <b>opinion</b> {{says that}} the government's {{contention}} that the war started on September 11, 2001 undercuts Justice Thomas' argument that it started in 1996.|$|E
5|$|The <b>majority</b> <b>opinion</b> {{notes that}} {{language}} in the Congressional Record that the Scalia dissent cites was inserted into the Record after the legislation had been enacted, by Senators Lindsey Graham (R-SC) and Jon Kyl (R-AZ), and includes falsified quotations attributed to other persons.|$|E
5|$|Chief Justice Melville Fuller {{delivered}} {{the opinion of}} the court on May 21, 1900. This opinion held that there were no federal issues in question in the case, and that the court lacked jurisdiction. The opinion affirmed the state court of appeals' assertion that an elective office was not property. Justices Gray, White, Shiras, and Peckham concurred with the <b>majority</b> <b>opinion.</b>|$|E

5|$|In a 5-4 decision, the Court {{overturned}} the silver platter doctrine and Elkins' conviction. Associate Justice Potter Stewart wrote the <b>majority</b> <b>opinion,</b> while Associate Justices Felix Frankfurter and John M. Harlan II dissented. By giving {{a rationale for}} a broader interpretation of Fourth Amendment rights, the decision prepared the way for Mapp v. Ohio (1961), which applied the exclusionary rule to the states.|$|E
5|$|The Supreme Court granted certiorari in January 1987, and {{the case}} was argued on October 13, 1987. On January 13, 1988, the court handed down its decision, {{overturning}} the circuit court in a 5-3 ruling. Its <b>majority</b> <b>opinion</b> set a precedent that school-sponsored activities, including student newspapers and drama productions, are not normally protected from administrative censorship under the First Amendment.|$|E
5|$|Whenever {{the emperor}} was absent from a court conference but sought its advice, he {{relied on the}} {{chancellor}} to direct it and inform him of the resulting <b>majority</b> <b>opinion.</b> If the attending ministers were split into opposing factions of roughly equal size, the chancellor would listen to the positions of both sides and count {{the exact number of}} ministers who supported either opposing opinion.|$|E
30|$|To {{facilitate}} {{efficient use}} of congestion information, and {{to increase the speed}} of the A* search algorithm, the implementation post-processes traffic information to form <b>majority</b> <b>opinions</b> so that the information can be immediately retrieved during algorithm execution. This means that <b>majority</b> <b>opinions</b> are calculated every time new information is retrieved, which is then stored in a local hash table for constant time (O(1)) retrieval by the A* algorithm.|$|R

5|$|Finally, {{after the}} {{workshop}} concluded, an 1884 {{edition of the}} Cyrus Cylinder by E. A. Wallis Budge came to Irving Finkel's attention. This publication used an idiosyncratic typeface and featured a handcopy for only {{a section of the}} whole cylinder. However the typeface in that edition matched the paleography on the bone inscriptions and the extract of the cylinder published in the book matched that of the bone as well. This convinced Finkel that the bone inscriptions were early modern forgeries and that has remained the <b>majority</b> <b>opinion</b> since then.|$|E
5|$|Furthermore, the Court held that, {{due to the}} Eleventh Amendment, {{federal courts}} could not {{exercise}} ancillary jurisdiction over cross-claims by counties against states. Although only two other justices agreed with the entirety of Justice Powell's <b>majority</b> <b>opinion,</b> Brennan and Marshall agreed with Parts I-IV and VI (the Oneida's claims against the counties) and Burger, White, and Rehnquist agreed with Part V (the counties claims against the state), thus forging separate majorities.|$|E
5|$|However, Black {{wrote the}} <b>majority</b> <b>opinion</b> in Korematsu v. United States, which upheld Japanese {{internment}} during World War II. Black also consistently opposed {{the doctrine of}} substantive due process (the anti-New Deal Supreme Court's interpretation of this concept {{made it impossible for}} the government to enact legislation that interfered with the freedom of business owners) and believed that there was no basis {{in the words of the}} Constitution for a right to privacy, voting against finding one in Griswold v. Connecticut.|$|E
50|$|During Justice Sharp's 17-year tenure on the Supreme Court, {{she wrote}} 459 <b>majority</b> <b>opinions,</b> 124 concurring opinions, and 45 dissenting opinions.|$|R

5|$|In Multani v. Marguerite-Bourgeoys (Commission scolaire) (2006), {{the issue}} was whether a ban {{in a public school}} on Sikh {{students}} carrying kirpans (ceremonial daggers) for religious purposes was justifiable. Justice Louise Charron, who delivered the Court's <b>majority</b> <b>opinion,</b> applied the Oakes test to section 2(a) of the Charter. She held that the school could not discharge its burden of proving that prohibiting the kirpan was a reasonable limit on the student's constitutional freedom of religion.|$|E
5|$|On April 6, 1900, the Court of Appeals upheld Judge Field's {{decision}} {{by a vote}} of 6–1. The <b>majority</b> <b>opinion</b> held that an elected office is not property and thus not subject to the protections guaranteed in the Fourteenth Amendment. As a creation of the Kentucky Constitution, the court held, any elective office is conferred and held only subject to the provisions of that constitution. This put the matter beyond the reach of any judicial review, according to the court.|$|E
5|$|To sum up: The {{lines of}} {{cleavage}} between Pablo's revisionism and orthodox Trotskyism are {{so deep that}} no compromise is possible either politically or organizationally. The Pablo faction has demonstrated {{that it will not}} permit democratic decisions truly reflecting <b>majority</b> <b>opinion</b> to be reached. They demand complete submission to their criminal policy. They are determined to drive all orthodox Trotskyists out of the Fourth International or to muzzle and handcuff them.|$|E
50|$|Considered a federalist and a {{moderate}} Republican, O'Connor tended to approach each case narrowly without arguing for sweeping precedents. She most frequently {{sided with the}} court's conservative bloc, although in the latter years of her tenure, she was regarded as having the swing opinion in many cases. She often wrote concurring opinions that limited {{the reach of the}} majority holding. Her <b>majority</b> <b>opinions</b> in landmark cases include Grutter v. Bollinger and Hamdi v. Rumsfeld. She also wrote in part the per curiam <b>majority</b> <b>opinions</b> in Planned Parenthood v. Casey and Bush v. Gore.|$|R
