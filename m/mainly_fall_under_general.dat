40|$|The {{proliferation}} of network enabled mobile devices is creating an extraordinary opportunity for designing of new applications. This paper describes {{the development and}} evaluation of a mobile facsimile application (ClikiFax) for the construction industry.

From similar studies conducted in literature, we adopt a theoretical framework consisting of multi-dimensional factors that could predominantly influence the usability of the ClikiFax system. These factors <b>mainly</b> <b>fall</b> <b>under</b> three categories such as, job-related, user behavioural and environmental determinants. Field testing of the ClikiFax system was conducted based on these three-dimensional factors.
