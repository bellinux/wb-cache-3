However, the physical processes of magnetization imply that stable NRMs can be preserved that are many orders of magnitude below our present measurement abilities. Recent advances in reducing the noise level of superconducting magnetometer systems, particularly the introduction of DC-SQUID sensors and development of a low-noise sample handling system using thin-walled quartz-glass vacuum tubes, have solved many of these instrumentation problems, increasing the effective sensitivity by a factor of nearly 50 over the previous techniques of SQUID moment magnetometry. Here we report the successful isolation of a two-polarity characteristic remanent magnetization from MiddleâLate Permian limestone formed in the atoll of a mid-oceanic paleo-seamount, now preserved in the Jurassic accretionary complex in Japan, which had proved difficult to analyze in past studies.

40|$|Direct, {{real time}} domain {{observations}} in electrical steel during its magnetisation at 50 Hz and 75 Hz was limited due to low the limited sensitivity and frame sampling {{rate of the}} camera systems available. In this work, a high efficiency Kerr magneto-optic microscope was coupled to a recent commercially available high speed intensified camera. The superior efficiency of the developed system enabled domain dynamics measurement to be made at magnetisation frequencies up to 100 Hz in the real time mode and up to 1. 8 kHz in stroboscopic mode. The application of the system was focussed {{on the study of}} grain-oriented electrical steel. Observations in this work revealed that the behaviour of the domain walls under sinusoidal excitation is far from being ideal sinusoidal motion. The deviations from the ideal behaviour can be summarised as non-sinusoidal, non uniform and non-repetitive domain wall motion. The dependence of the non- uniformity of wall motion and cycle-to-cycle non-repeatability on magnetisation conditions studied by direct real-time observation revealed that under certain conditions the non-uniformity and non-repeatability is much higher. Recommendations have been made on how to reduce losses by adjusting the magnetisation conditions and "magnetic history" of the steel core. The observations confirmed previous researchers' suggestions that the perfection of grain-to-grain orientation and grain size uniformity would improve wall motion uniformity, hence reducing power loss in the material. In addition to Kerr-microscopy observations, the application of a <b>magnetic</b> <b>indicator</b> imaging technique was demonstrated. Moving domains under the insulating, opaque coating on commercial grain-oriented electrical steel were observed using this method. The influence of surface roughness and the effect of coating tension on the domain structure and distortion of bar domains under dynamic magnetisation was observed.

40|$|Magnetic {{activity}} {{cycles of}} a convective {{star in a}} close binary system may lead to orbit period changes through tidal spin-orbit coupling. An increase in the mean magnetic field throughout the convection zone provides an additional pressure support and increases the star's moment of inertia. In order for the system to conserve angular momentum instantaneously, the convective star must reduce its rotation rate. When this happens, the system is no longer synchronous; in particular, the equilibrium tide now suffers a phase lag. A tidal torque must act, transferring angular momentum from the star's rotation to the orbit, lengthening the period. When the field decays, these events reverse and the period shortens. Observed period changes in RS CVn-like systems are of the order delta p/p = 10 to the - 6 th, implying variations in the mean field strength {{at the base of}} the convection zone of approximately 1000 G over time scales of 10 - 30 yr.

Three standard analysis techniques are applied to analyze the hemispheric coupling (north-south asymmetry and phase asynchrony) of monthly averaged values of solar HÎ± flare activity over the past 49 years (from 1966 January to 2014 December). The prominent results are as follows: (1) from a global point of view, solar HÎ± flare activity on both hemispheres are strongly correlated with each other, but the northern hemisphere precedes the southern one with a phase shift of 7 months; (2) the long-range persistence indeed exists in solar HÎ± flare activity, but the dynamical complexities in the two hemispheres are not identical; (3) the prominent periodicities of HÎ± flare activity are 17 years full-disk activity cycle and 11 years Schwabe solar cycle, but the short- and mid-term periodicities cannot determined by monthly time series; (4) by comparing the non-parametric rescaling behavior on a point-by-point basis, the hemispheric asynchrony of solar HÎ± flare activity are estimated to be ranging from several months to tens of months with an average value of 8. 7 months.

40|$|Observations of <b>magnetic</b> {{activity}} <b>indicators</b> in solar-type stars {{exhibit a}} relationship with rotation with an increase until a "saturation" level and a moderate decrease in activity in the very fastest rotators ("supersaturation"). While X-ray data have suggested that this relationship is strongly violated in ultracool dwarfs (UCDs; spectral type >M 7), {{the limited number of}} X-ray detections has prevented firm conclusions. In this paper, we analyze the X-ray activity-rotation relation in 38 ultracool dwarfs. Our sample represents the largest catalog of X-ray active ultracool dwarfs to date, including seven new and four previously-unpublished Chandra observations presented in a companion paper. We identify a substantial number of rapidly-rotating UCDs with X-ray activity extending two orders of magnitude below the expected saturation level and measure a "supersaturation"-type anticorrelation between rotation and X-ray activity. The scatter in UCD X-ray activity at a fixed rotation is ~ 3 times larger than that in earlier-type stars. We discuss several mechanisms that have been proposed to explain the data, including centrifugal stripping of the corona, and find them to be inconsistent with the observed trends. Instead, we suggest that an additional parameter correlated with both X-ray activity and rotation is responsible for the observed effects. Building on the results of Zeeman-Doppler imaging of UCD magnetic fields and our companion study of radio/X-ray flux ratios, we argue that this parameter is the magnetic field topology, and that the large scatter in UCD X-ray fluxes reflects the presence of two dynamo modes that produce distinct topologies.
