5|$|Velázquez {{uses this}} light {{not only to}} add volume and {{definition}} to each form but also to define the focal points of the painting. As the light streams in from the right it brightly glints on the braid and golden hair of the female dwarf, who is nearest the light source. But because her face is turned from the light, and in shadow, its tonality does not <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> of particular interest. Similarly, the light glances obliquely on the cheek of the lady-in-waiting near her, but not on her facial features. Much of her lightly coloured dress is dimmed by shadow. The Infanta, however, stands in full illumination, and with her face turned towards the light source, even though her gaze is not. Her face is framed by the pale gossamer of her hair, setting her apart from {{everything else in the}} picture. The light models the volumetric geometry of her form, defining the conic nature of a small torso bound rigidly into a corset and stiffened bodice, and the panniered skirt extending around her like an oval candy-box, casting its own deep shadow which, by its sharp contrast with the bright brocade, both emphasises and locates the small figure as the main point of attention.|$|E

25|$|In 1925, Tatum {{moved to}} the Columbus School for the Blind, where he studied music and learned braille. He {{subsequently}} studied piano with Overton G. Rainey at either the Jefferson School or the Toledo School of Music. Rainey, who was also visually impaired, probably taught Tatum in the classical tradition, as Rainey did not improvise and discouraged his students from playing jazz. In 1927, Tatum began playing on Toledo radio station WSPD as 'Arthur Tatum, Toledo's Blind Pianist', during interludes in Ellen Kay's shopping chat program and soon had his own program. By the age of 19, Tatum was playing at the local Waiters' and Bellmens' Club. As word of Tatum spread, national performers passing through Toledo, including Duke Ellington, Louis Armstrong, Joe Turner and Fletcher Henderson, would <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> to drop in to hear the piano phenomenon.|$|E

2500|$|While Fellini was for {{the most}} part {{indifferent}} to politics, he had a general dislike of authoritarian institutions, and is interpreted by Bondanella as believing in [...] "the dignity and even the nobility of the individual human being". In a 1966 interview, he stated, [...] "I <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> to see if certain ideologies or political attitudes threaten the private freedom of the individual.
