40|$|OBJECTIVE: Deficiency {{of vitamin}} B complex, vitamin C, vitamin D, calcium, and {{magnesium}} {{has been associated}} with periodontal disease. This article systematically reviews the currently available literature on the feasible association of vitamin B complex, vitamin C, vitamin D, calcium, and <b>magnesium</b> <b>deficiencies</b> with periodontal disease in elderly people. METHODS: We performed a systematic review of relevant English- and Dutch-language medical literature published from January 1990 to May 2007, with critical appraisal of those studies evaluating the association of vitamin B complex, vitamin C, vitamin D, calcium, and <b>magnesium</b> <b>deficiencies</b> with periodontal disease in elderly people. RESULTS: None of the studies meeting the selection criteria included institutionalized elderly people. In the studies on non-institutionalized elderly people, no significant or consistent association was found between vitamin B complex, vitamin C, vitamin D, calcium, and magnesium dietary intakes and serum levels and periodontal disease. Although in those studies decreased dietary vitamin C intake was found to be associated with increased risk of periodontal disease, no conclusive evidence could be demonstrated. CONCLUSION: There is no evidence of an association of vitamin B complex, vitamin C, vitamin D, calcium, and <b>magnesium</b> <b>deficiencies</b> with periodontal disease in non-institutionalized elderly people. To produce conclusive evidence on the subject of this systematic literature review, longitudinal cohort studies and follow-up randomized controlled trials are needed...|$|R

40|$|<b>Magnesium</b> <b>deficiencies</b> {{have been}} shown to be {{particularly}} dangerous to short cycled crops, both on sandy and clay soils. Such deficiencies may be corrected by foliar fertilisations, but in French bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) no experimental data may be found to support this hypothesis. Therefore this paper was aimed at studying the effect of foliar Mg-applications (56, 112 and 224 g ha- 1 in single application at flowering or splitted half dose at 4 -leaf stage and half at flowering) alone and with Zn (200 g ha- 1) on yield and quality of two French bean genotypes (Bronco, Cadillac). Foliar Mg-applications significantly increased pod yield and, considering the highest rate with respect to the untreated, such an increase was 78 % and 32 % for Bronco and Cadillac, respectively. Split applications were also more effective, with yield increases of 109 % and 50 % for the two genotypes. Concerning quality, foliar Mg applications showed a significant effect particularly on sugars, calcium, phosphate, sulphate and Mg contents in pods. On the other hand, a significant effect on the accumulation of nitrates was noted, especially with split applications (144 % increase vs. unfertilised) and, in some cases, an antagonistic effect on K content (10 - 20 % decrease on average). Foliar Mg fertilisation of French bean seemed to be a promising practice with reference to human health and nutrition, tough some care is needed to avoid the accumulation of nitrates in pods. Split applications seemed to be more effective, while the addition of Zn to the fertiliser mix did not give any relevant effect...|$|R

Gypsum addition {{has been known to}} assist in alleviating these problems in other countries. However, there is no experience or published information on red mud rehabilitation under Irish conditions. Red mud with organic and inorganic waste-derived ameliorants as well as selected grassland species were examined under laboratory controlled environment conditions as well as in field plot trials. Also, in order that it would be economically achievable, the research utilised locally available waste products as the organic amendments. Screening trials found that physical constraints severely limit plant germination and growth in red mud. Gypsum addition effectively lowers pH, exchangeable sodium percentage and the availability of A 1 and Fe in the mud. A strong relationship between pH, ESP and A 1 levels was also found. Gypsum addition increased germination percentages and plant growth for all species investigated. Greenhouse trials demonstrated that organic wastes alone did not greatly improve conditions for plant growth but when used in conjunction with gypsum plant performances for all species investigated was significantly increased. There was a high mortality rate for grasses in non-gypsum treatments. An emerging trend of preferential iron uptake and calcium deficiency in non-gypsum treatments was found at pot screening stage.

40|$|During nearly 19 {{years of}} {{clinical}} practice I {{have had the}} opportunity to observe the health effects of drinking different types of water. Most of you would agree that drinking unfiltered tap water could be hazardous to your health because of things like parasites, chlorine, fluoride and dioxins. Many health fanatics, however, are often surprised to hear me say that drinking purified water on a regular, daily basis is potentially dangerous. Paavo Airola wrote about the dangers of purified water in the 1970 's when it first became a fad with the health food crowd. Distillation is the process in which water is boiled, evaporated and the vapor condensed. Purified or reverse osmosis water is free of dissolved minerals and, because of this, has the special property of being able to actively absorb toxic substances from the body and eliminate them. Studies validate the benefits of drinking purified water when one is seeking to cleanse or detoxify the system for short periods of time (a few weeks at a time). Fasting using purified water can be dangerous because of the rapid loss of electrolytes (sodium, potassium, chloride) and trace minerals like <b>magnesium,</b> <b>deficiencies</b> of which can cause heart beat irregularities and high blood pressure. Cooking foods in purified water pulls the minerals out of them and lowers their nutrient value. Purified water is an active absorber and when it comes into contact with air, it absorbs carbon dioxide, making it acidic. The more purified water a person drinks, the higher the body acidity becomes. According to the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency, "Purified " water, being essentially mineral-free, is very aggressive, in that it tends to dissolv...|$|R

Production Method (3) Peppers are a warm season crop, which produce best during a long growing season.

Peppers grow well in a loam or sandy loam soil, with a pH between 6. 0 and 6. 8. Acid soils can lead to calcium and <b>magnesium</b> <b>deficiencies</b> and fruit damaged with blossom end rot. Peppers are usually planted in Ohio as greenhouse grown, plug transplants. The ideal planting date for transplants is mid to late May, but is typically delayed due to spring rainfall. Transplants should be only slightly hardened before planting. Over hardened transplants are slow to develop once in the field. Transplants should be set with a starter fertilizer high in phosphorus. Transplants are placed in rows 4 feet apart with 12 - 18 inches between plants. Many growers of fresh-market peppers in Ohio, plant under black plastic mulch with trickle irrigation laid under the plastic. This provides uniform moisture and fertility during the growing season. A constant water supply is necessary for adequate production. Bell peppers are harvested either when immature and green but have reached full size and maximum wall thickness, or when fully ripened and turned red.
