5|$|Classical {{music was}} brought to the United States with some of the first colonists. European {{classical}} music is rooted in the traditions of European art, ecclesiastical and concert music. The central norms of this tradition developed between 1550 and 1825, centering on {{what is known as the}} common practice period. <b>Many</b> <b>American</b> classical composers attempted to work entirely within European models until late in the 19th century. When Antonín Dvořák, a prominent Czech composer, visited the United States from 1892 to 1895, he iterated the idea that American classical music needed its own models instead of imitating European composers; he helped to inspire subsequent composers to make a distinctly American style of classical music. By the beginning of the 20th century, <b>many</b> <b>American</b> composers were incorporating disparate elements into their work, ranging from jazz and blues to Native American music.|$|E

50|$|There {{were also}} Darwinian-inspired excuses for the {{discrimination}} of the Irish in America. <b>Many</b> <b>Americans</b> believed {{that since the}} Irish were Celts and not Anglo-Saxons, they were racially inferior and deserved second-hand citizenship. The Irish being of inferior intelligence was a belief held by <b>many</b> <b>Americans.</b> This notion was held {{due to the fact}} that the Irish topped the charts demographically in terms of arrests and imprisonment. They also had more people confined to insane asylums and poorhouses than any other group. The racial supremacy belief that <b>many</b> <b>Americans</b> had at the time contributed significantly to Irish discrimination.|$|R

5|$|A liberal {{is someone}} who favors {{censorship}} of Christianity plus increased government spending and power, as in ObamaCare. Increasingly liberals side with the homosexual agenda, including same-sex marriage. Many liberals favor a welfare state where people receive endless entitlements without working. Liberals are often anti-Christian, or otherwise disagree with moral or social principles held by <b>many</b> <b>American</b> Christians. The liberal ideology has worsened {{over the years and}} degenerated into economically delusional views and intolerant ideology. Some liberals simply support, in knee-jerk fashion, the opposite of conservative principles without having any meaningful values of their own.|$|E

5|$|King {{supported}} {{the ideals of}} democratic socialism, although {{he was reluctant to}} speak directly of this support due to the anti-communist sentiment being projected throughout the United States at the time, and the association of socialism with communism.

5|$|<b>Many</b> <b>American</b> {{pilots who}} took part in World War II grew up during the 1930s enthusiastically reading flying pulps such as Flying Aces, and were captivated by the {{adventure}} stories, an experience that no doubt played a part in their decision to become military aviators themselves. Joseph W. Rutter, a pilot in the Army Air Force in 1944, recalls this vividly in his book Wreaking Havoc: A Year in an A-20, as does First Blue, the biography of Roy Marlin Voris, World War II ace and two-time commander of the Blue Angels.|$|E

However, the most recent housing crash stripped <b>many</b> <b>Americans</b> of much of their wealth, as home values plummeted and millions of homes went into foreclosure. These losses were especially painful for homeowners of color, who lost a greater share of wealth in the crash and have rebuilt their wealth more slowly in the recovery.

5|$|Another {{interpretation}} {{was that}} the North Vietnamese were planning to work both ends against the middle. This strategy {{has come to be}} known as the Option Play. If the NVA could take Khe Sanh, all well and good for them. If they could not, they would occupy the attention of as <b>many</b> <b>American</b> and South Vietnamese forces in I Corps as they could to facilitate the Tet Offensive. This view was supported by a captured (in 1969) North Vietnamese study of the battle. According to it, the NVA would have taken Khe Sanh if they could, but there were limits to the price they were willing to pay. Their main objectives were to inflict casualties on US troops and to isolate them in the remote border regions.|$|E
5|$|As England imposed its {{series of}} acts upon the colonists, {{changes in the}} American colonists' {{purchases}} and trades eventually altered the American diet.

Whiskey became the spirit of choice for <b>many</b> <b>American</b> colonists who wished to thumb their noses at England. In the northern colonies, whiskey was made with rye, while the southern colonies preferred corn. Rye was seen as a more civilized grain, while corn whiskey was presented as a more patriotic version as it was produced from an indigenous American crop.|$|E
