40|$|Abstract — In {{this paper}} a novel {{approach}} to learning by demonstration (LbD) is presented. A <b>multimodal</b> <b>service</b> robot is taught grasping skills by a human instructor who demonstrates a grasping action. Our approach contributes novel solutions to the aspects of robustly tracking the demonstrator’s hands in real {{time as well as}} to the transformation of tracking results into grasping skills. To track the demonstrator’s hands in stereoscopic images a Mean-Shift-like algorithm is adapted. For the very first time this algorithm is applied to local binary patterns (LBP) and color histograms. To retrieve the hand configuration we use view-based Principal Component Analysis (PCA). To develop grasping skills from tracking results the robot repetitively tracks the demonstrator’s grasping actions and transforms the results into three-dimensional self organizing maps (SOMs). The SOMs give a spatial description of the collected data and serve as data structures for a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm which optimizes trajectories for use by the robot. The approach is applied to a <b>multimodal</b> <b>service</b> robot. Experiments show the effectiveness of the LBP-enhanced Mean-Shift-like tracking and the robustness of LbD based on SOMs and RL I...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a mobile <b>multimodal</b> <b>service</b> platform, which enable users {{to interact with}} automated services using a standard mobile terminal in a user friendly and efficient way. The concept of multimodality {{was introduced to the}} world of mobile devices and services because one saw the limitations that conventional interaction methods posed. There is a merging trend that people want to be more mobile and have access to different services when on the move. To adapt to the user needs, the service providers try to develop mobile services. The problem is that these services are becoming ever more complex and requires more interaction from the user. The paradox is that the mobile devices these new services are accessible from has not evolved in the same speed. Most of the mobile devices sold on the market today basically comprise of a display and a simple keypad. Thus, to navigate in and operate a mobile service, requires both patience and handiness using a mobile handset. The multimodal system worked on in this thesis is a speech-centric multimodal platform based on a client-server architecture. The user connect the multimodal client part with the multimodal server part and can thereafter interact with a <b>multimodal</b> <b>service</b> using both speech commands and touch-sensitive display to point at objects etc. in the graphical user interface. As a response to the user queries the system can present the results using both graphics and synthesized speech. This may not sound as a revolutionizing new concept, but what the multimodal interface provides is the possibility to give simultaneous input. I. e. the user may point at a icon on the display while simultaneously input speech commands. These two inputs interpreted one by one will give no meaning, but interpreted together they constitute a reasonable user query. In this way, the user can do interaction based on own preferences. The result of the query is also multimodal, i. e. the system present the results according to the user preference, and the user will hopefully have a better user experience. The thesis look into multimodality and relevant technology. Further it specifies requirements for the mobile <b>multimodal</b> <b>service.</b> Based on the requirements, a mobile multimodal solution is elaborated. The implementation and the presented solution elaborated in the thesis is based upon a multimodal platform which among others Telenor R&D has contributed to. The original multimodal platform base the communication between client and server on a WLAN connection. To improve the mobility, functionality for connecting client and server using third generation mobile network technology referred to as 3 G, or more specific UMTS, is implemented. Further an analysis on how well the implementation cover the specified requirements is performed. Finally, considerations about the multimodality and the presented solution is discussed, with emphasize on reliability, usability and openness. </p...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to design and pilot test ICT-supported {{rehabilitation}} services across twelve health care institutions and four different diagnosis groups (i. e. acute hip, arthritis, cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) starting from a <b>multimodal</b> <b>service</b> platform that offers four different telemedicine technologies: 1) teleconsultation, 2) activity coaching, 3) web-based exercising and 4) health monitoring. Results showed that using the same technologies, different telemedicine services can be developed with different clinical purposes. Results also show that different implementation strategies are needed for different patient groups, or even within different patient groups, to get the services implemented in everyday care. Evaluation of the ICT-supported rehabilitation services in everyday care showed that the ICT support is being accepted and highly used by the patient. However, the use of the ICT support by care professionals was dramatically low. Future studies should focus on full-scale implementation in clinical practice, on education of the health care professionals as well as large-scale trials...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The global {{diffusion}} of the Internet has enabled {{the distribution of}} informative content through dynamic media such as RSS feeds and video blogs. At the same time, the decreasing cost of electronic devices has increased the pervasive availability of the same informative content {{in the form of}} digital audiovisual data. This paper presents a system for the large-scale unsupervised acquisition, segmentation and indexing of TV newscasts. In particular, it discusses the principles and performance of the parts of the system dedicated to the detection and segmentation of programmes from the acquired stream. In addition to the core technology, we also introduce and discuss a novel method for assessing the results of story boundaries segmentation algorithms, based on a user-validated measurement. Due to the heterogeneity of current news distribution channels, a further innovative aspect of this paper is the description of a framework for multimodal information aggregation. The core of this framework is a cross-modal clustering process for which a novel, asymmetric similarity measure is provided. The implemented prototype uses online news articles and TV news programmes as information sources, and provides a <b>multimodal</b> <b>service</b> integrating both contributions.

40|$|Multimodal {{interfaces}} make {{it possible}} to communicate with services in many different ways, and it is claimed that this freedom is particularly useful for disabled persons. To test this hypothesis we have developed a flexible multimodal interface to a public web-based bus-route information service for the Oslo area. The original service is text-based. Our new interface running on a PDA converts the service to a map-based <b>multimodal</b> <b>service</b> supporting speech, graphic/text and pointing modalities. Here users can choose to use speech or point on the map or even use a combination of tap and talk simultaneously (so-called composite multimodality) to specify the required information including arrival and departure stations. The response from the system is read aloud by speech synthesis while the same information is shown textually on the screen. We have carried out two rounds of user-evaluation for this multimodal interface. The first one was a scenario-based evaluation carried out for five disabled users. The main conclusion was that these users ’ attitude towards the multimodal system was positive and they recognized the advantages and the potential of such systems. Then we carried out an in-depth evaluation of how a dyslectic and an aphasic used our system. These two could neither use the corresponding public speech-based telephone service nor the text-based web-service, but they found the new multimodal interface very useful.

40|$|This report {{serves to}} inform the City of Holyoke about {{compelling}} features in its downtown district as they would pertain to the creation and management of a transit-oriented development district around the recently created Intermodal Transportation Center, a hub for bus service between Holyoke and other communities in the Pioneer Valley. These features were developed through literature and interview surveys and are described in a SWOT analysis, identifying strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats as existing and future advantages and disadvantages related to transit-oriented development. Some of the more compelling strengths include a municipal reputation for attracting planning grants for large-scale projects to improve the district; a competitive location efficiency in the historic business district, the area 2 ̆ 7 s accommodation for <b>multimodal</b> <b>service</b> - particularly pedestrian and transit traffic, and national trends correlating the city 2 ̆ 7 s demographic profile to transit ridership support. With little expectation for change, all of these features should translate to the near future in Holyoke. Challenges cited in this report include bus-based transit-oriented development 2 ̆ 7 s unproven and unfamiliar reputation with stakeholders in the Pioneer Valley, the rustbelt community 2 ̆ 7 s tough-luck image in the development community, lagging leadership for the planning technique from state and regional planning officials, the City 2 ̆ 7 s zoning regulations that oblige a suburban development model, and excessive parking that presently challenges a comfortable pedesrian environment. These challenges have solutions. Opportunities discussed in this report speak to financing options typical to transit-oriented development projects to generate a favorable reputation, ongoing strategies to increase and highlight the City 2 ̆ 7 s accomplishments, recommendations for zoning amendments to encourage pedestrian-friendly development, and popular methods to improve transit 2 ̆ 7 s viability as a competitive alternative to car use. Some issues are simply beyond the City 2 ̆ 7 s hands and will persist as threats to successsful downtown transit-oriented development. These issues include market hesitation to invest in transit-oriented development and Holyoke in general, a challenging reputation established for decades, and persistently lagging support from Beacon Hill for the unique issues confronting communities like Holyoke in the Pioneer Valley. Transit-oriented development presents a myriad of benefits and challenges for Holyoke and its stakeholders. Overall, the development technique offers compelling reasons for political and business leaders in Holyoke to adopt policies intended to realize its goals to create a vibrant, economically viable downtown district.

PERSSILAA project is structured in six workpackages. The objective of WP 3 is the development and validation of the various service modules focused on nutrition, physical and cognitive functioning. The task screening modules aims to develop an easy to use multidimensional screening tool integrating different domains important for frailty, specifically cognitive, physical and nutritional status to generate a quick, reliable and integrated assessment of a person’s health status. For nutrition, the Mini Nutritional Assessment (MNA®) will be used. Under WP 3, one of the tasks is Nutrition, which focuses {{on the development of}} training services to promote healthy behaviour in terms of healthy nutrition, and can be offered via different service configurations, such as a health literacy program, health promoting self management tools or as (in) formal care supported service. An interactive website that offers various modules, 15 in total, will be developed. Examples are: 1) clinical nutrition and 2) nutritional labelling. In the 1 st module the objective is: with the intervention of a nutritionist, with experience in clinical practice and a patient, we will simulate what happens in a real nutritional intervention. Therefore during this intervention we will show how to assess the following topics: family history, lifestyle habits, nutritional assessment, nutritional status (including anthropometric data), and dietary plan. The 2 nd module, regarding nutritional labelling, aims to provide information to consumers about the characteristics of packaged food products so that after reading it, they make appropriate food choices for each case as well as a proper preparation, consumption, storage and conservation. For this purpose, we intend to help the general public to better interpret food labels, giving them comprehensive information and education on the current legislation (Regulation EU n. º 1169 / 2011). With these modules, we intend that in the near future elderly people can learn how to make healthier choices and improve food habits, providing them tools to allow people to easily evaluate themselves.

Inevitably, collaborative relationships between shippers and operators have received considerable attention in determining the effectiveness of Multimodal Transport. The term of'relationship' in the context of transport has always been a critical pillar in strategic business environment. However, in the Asian context, especially in China or other Asian countries like Thailand, the term 'relationship' is an ambiguous business concept, which exceeds more than just elements of long-term business relationship or short- term transactions found in the Western literature. The term 'Guartxi briefly translated as personal connections/relationships, is deeply embedded in the mindset of most Asian people and in every aspect of their personal and organisational interactions.

In this study, an evaluation of the causal relationships among <b>Multimodal</b> Transport <b>Service</b> (MTS), Logistics Service Value (LSV), Relationship Quality (RQ) and Guanxi (GX) on shippers' Business Performance (BP) is examined. A research model is developed to validate these measurement models and to rigorously test the relationships in the form of structural model. This study uses Structure Equation Modeling (SEM) to analyse data collected from Thai shippers listed in the Thai National Shippers' Council (TNSC). The result of the structural model has shown that both MTS and LSV has significant impact on BP through RQ, and GX has shown support on all of its related hypothesised paths. In summary, this thesis empirically develops a structural model to prove the significance of MTS, LSV, RQ and GX on Business Performance in a Multimodal Transport environment...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — <b>Multimodal</b> routing <b>services</b> {{with public}} {{transportation}} are already present in many large {{cities across the}} globe. In this paper we describe a mobile guide that goes beyond existing solutions, mainly due to its service personalization and its dynamic routing algorithm. Personalization is based on knowledge engineering principles and Semantic Web technologies. The dynamic routing algorithm is based on short term history and estimators and supports cities with pre-installed fleet management systems in the public transport means...|$|R
