Charles sought the other European powers' approval for disinheriting his nieces. They exacted harsh terms: in the Treaty of Vienna (1731), Great Britain demanded that Austria abolish the Ostend Company in return for its recognition of the Pragmatic Sanction. In total, Great Britain, France, Saxony-Poland, United Provinces, Spain, Venice, the Papal States, Prussia, Russia, Denmark-Norway, Savoy-Sardinia, Bavaria and the Diet of the Holy Roman Empire recognised the sanction. France, Spain, Saxony-Poland, Bavaria and Prussia later reneged.|$|E

500|$|In 1996, Madonna {{starred in}} the film Evita, playing the titular role. For a long time, Madonna had desired to play Eva and even {{wrote a letter to}} {{director}} Alan Parker, explaining how she would be perfect for the part. After securing the role, she underwent vocal training with coach Joan Lader since Evita required the actors to sing their own parts. Lader noted that the singer [...] "had to use her voice in a way she's never used it before. Evita is real musical theater— its operatic, in a sense. Madonna developed an upper register that she didn't know she had." [...] From the <b>moment</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> signed in the film, Madonna had expressed interest in recording a dance version of [...] "Don't Cry for Me Argentina". According to her publicist Liz Rosenberg, [...] "since [...] didn't write the music and lyrics, she wanted her signature on that song...

[...] Langford also expressed shock at her exit, saying that soaps rarely ever surprise him due to there predictability.

It was swift and out of nowhere, yet her death not only made perfect sense, it has galvanized this show in a way that has been missing for so long.
