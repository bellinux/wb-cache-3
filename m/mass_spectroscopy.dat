5|$|Bainbridge {{was elected}} a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1937. His {{interest}} in <b>mass</b> <b>spectroscopy</b> led naturally to {{an interest in}} the relative abundance of isotopes. The discovery of nuclear fission in uranium-235 led to an interest in separating this isotope. He proposed using a Holweck pump to produce the vacuum necessary for this work, and enlisted George B. Kistiakowsky and E. Bright Wilson to help. There was little interest in their work because research was being carried out elsewhere. In 1943, their cyclotron was requisitioned by Edwin McMillan for use by the U. S. Army. It was packed up and carted off to Los Alamos, New Mexico.|$|E

25|$|Argon ionises at 15.76eV, {{which is}} higher than hydrogen, but lower than helium, neon or fluorine. Molecules {{containing}} argon can be van der Waals molecules held together very weakly by London dispersion forces. Ionic molecules can be bound by charge induced dipole interactions. With gold atoms there can be some covalent interaction. Experimental methods used to study argon compounds have included inert gas matrices, infrared spectroscopy to study stretching and bending movements, microwave spectroscopy and far infrared to study rotation, and also visible and ultraviolet spectroscopy to study different electronic configurations including excimers. <b>Mass</b> <b>spectroscopy</b> is used to study ions. Computation methods {{have been used to}} theoretically compute molecule parameters, and predict new stable molecules. Computational ab initio methods used have included CCSD(T), MP2 (Møller–Plesset perturbation theory of the second order), CIS and CISD. For heavy atoms, effective core potentials are used to model the inner electrons, so that their contributions {{do not have to be}} individually computed. More powerful computers since the 1990s have made this kind of in silico study much more popular, being much less risky and simpler than an actual experiment.

2500|$|The word {{spectrograph}} {{had become}} part of the international scientific vocabulary by 1884. Early spectrometry devices that measured the mass-to-charge ratio of ions were called mass spectrographs which consisted of instruments that recorded a spectrum of mass values on a photographic plate. A mass spectroscope is similar to a mass spectrograph except that the beam of ions is directed onto a phosphor screen. A mass spectroscope configuration was [...] used in early instruments when it was desired that the effects of adjustments be quickly observed. Once the instrument was properly adjusted, a photographic plate was inserted and exposed. The term mass spectroscope continued to be used even though the direct illumination of a phosphor screen was replaced by indirect measurements with an oscilloscope. The use of the term <b>mass</b> <b>spectroscopy</b> is now discouraged due to the possibility of confusion with light spectroscopy. Mass spectrometry is often abbreviated as mass-spec or simply as MS.|$|E

[...] A 2200 sample study of the dioxin levels in the city of Bien Hoa, a populous city in southern Vietnam located in the proximity of an air base used for spray missions, indicated noticeably elevated blood dioxin levels despite a 20-year period of peace with Agent Orange specifically being found in the blood samples. [...] Emigrants to the city and even children born {{after the end of the}} Agent Orange spraying operations had blood samples indicating a presence of dioxin (Schecter et al., 2001).
