5|$|The {{black-throated blue warbler}} forages {{actively}} in low vegetation, sometimes hovering or catching insects in flight. It often forages in one area {{for a while before}} <b>moving</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>next.</b> It mainly eats invertebrates such as caterpillars, crane flies, and spiders. It may supplement its diet with seeds, berries, and fruit in the winter.|$|E
5|$|Conquest, the single-player tournament career mode, pits the player's team {{against the}} ranked {{hierarchy}} {{en route to}} the championship. Up to three additional human players can join in the single-player. Players initially choose between four teams, though 13 total are unlockable. Teams begin with four players with no alternates for substitution, and fight their way from fourth place in the Rookie Division to first place against each team in between. Players can continue to take challenges within the division before irrevocably <b>moving</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> division.|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} {{for the song}} premièred on August 26, 2010 on Vevo, and was {{directed}} by Hiro Murai. The video begins in a club environment, with misplaced furniture and a shattered glass bottle. The scene goes in reverse motion, people instantly appear, frozen in a raving action. As the scene is still reversing a DJ is spinning his booth, and the shattered glass bottle forms into its original state, the clubbers and the scene then start to move in forward but slow motion and the song begins with Usher approaching from a set of stairs. Usher sings and dances, whilst moving past clubbers who are still moving in slow motion whilst he is in moving normally. Once the chorus comes in, the clubbers begin dancing and raving in normal motion, periodically slowing down; Usher is krumping pass them, <b>moving</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> scene. Usher slides into {{a room with a}} large lit up window as a back drop. He performs choreography backed-up by female dancers for the second verse, and then returns to the original room with the second chorus coming in. A similar scene is involved to the first chorus, but this time Usher is dancing with the clubbers, who are still alternating in motion speed. Pitbull then begins his verse, and is sat in a V.I.P. area with three females, with the camera alternating between him, the clubbers and Usher. The video ends with its final scene, in a dance off, with Usher dancing adjacent to some of the clubbers. Once the climax of the chorus comes in, Usher jumps in the air and starts freely dancing along with the clubbers, with everyone in the same motion speed; Usher is primarily crip-walking. Usher and the clubbers then perform a final organised choreography, mainly krumping, and the video ends.|$|E

25|$|Played from an {{isometric}} perspective, {{the game}} consists {{of more than}} 500 levels, with each level being {{a piece of land}} which contains the player's followers and the enemy's followers. The player is tasked with defeating the enemy followers and increasing their own followers' population using a series of divine powers before <b>moving</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> level. The game was designed by Peter Molyneux, and Bullfrog developed a gameplay prototype via a board game they invented using Lego.|$|E
25|$|The {{rebels were}} often tactically well led and {{made use of}} the mountainous terrain to conduct guerrilla warfare. However, they lacked a central {{leadership}} and coherent strategy. This was partly caused by the previous Castilian policy of encouraging and facilitating the Granadan upper class {{to leave the country}} or convert and be absorbed into the Christian upper class. The rebels' lack of strategic command allowed the Christian forces to proceed by defeating the rebels in one area separately, then <b>moving</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>next.</b>|$|E

25|$|As {{mentioned}} above, each taekwondo {{club and}} school is different therefore {{there is not}} single way to teach taekwondo. However, {{there are a few}} basic training techniques that can help students achieve certain skills in tae kwon do. Forms are usually practiced through repetition. Learning one half of the form and then <b>moving</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> half is the technique that is most often used. Then of course, even after students complete the form, it is necessary to critique them on the specifics. Students should master all of the stances in the current form before <b>moving</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> form. Chambering should be emphasized and it is helpful to explain why chambering is necessary and how each initial position helps execute force. For kicking, teaching snapping is extremely important for learning how to do proper kicks. Students typically line up against a wall or something they can place their hand on for balance, lift their knee up, and repeatedly practicing bending the leg in and snapping it out. This helps students gain the necessary muscles to have stronger, clean, and more accurate kicks. This general strategy can also be used for different kicks. Students can lean against the wall, lift their legs up close to their belly button and repeatedly shoot their leg out to practice side kick or they can shift the angle of their hips downwards and repeat the same thing to practice back kick. This type of practice is about building the muscle and carefully practicing the proper technique. By using targets, students can practice the accuracy of their kicks as well as transitioning from one kick to the other. You can either do target training to practice one kick over and over and carefully critique it so to get the proper technique or you can do a combination of kicks to improve balance and transitioning. It is also important to practice agility and endurance.|$|E
25|$|The Stanley Cup playoffs, {{which go}} from April to the {{beginning}} of June, is an elimination tournament where two teams play against each other to win a best-of-seven series in order to advance to the next round. The final remaining team is crowned the Stanley Cup champion.

25|$|Dumbledore's spirit {{appears to}} Harry {{towards the end}} of the book in a limbo-like King's Cross, after Harry is struck with the Killing Curse which was conjured by Voldemort. During the last book, Harry finds out that he must die because he is a Horcrux. When Voldemort conjures the Killing Curse, Harry does not fight back, which stops him from dying. When they meet again, the boy comforts Dumbledore as he confesses all of his many regrets. Dumbledore then informs Harry of the choice he still has: of <b>moving</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> life or {{returning}} to his body to face Voldemort one last time. After returning from the mystical King's Cross and defeating Voldemort for good, Harry has a short conversation with Dumbledore's portrait in the Headmaster's office about the fate of each of the three Deathly Hallows. He keeps the Cloak, leaves the Stone in the Forbidden Forest where he dropped it, and returns the Elder Wand to Dumbledore's tomb (from which Voldemort had stolen it). In the epilogue, it is revealed that Harry names his second son Albus Severus Potter after Dumbledore and Snape.|$|E

500|$|The album {{consists}} of 22 songs, {{most of which}} are short, under 3 minutes, and contain no hooks or choruses. Sam Samuelson of AllMusic compared the album to a comic book, [...] "sometimes segued with vignettes sampled from 1940s movies and broadcasts or left-field -toting skits". He also noted that some instrumentals on the album [...] " [...] to be so out of time or step with a traditional hip-hop direction". The A.V. Club compared the album to a buffet, where [...] "Madlib and Doom are interested in throwing out ideas as fast as they have them, giving them as much attention as they need, and <b>moving</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> thing". Tim O'Neil of PopMatters praised Madlib's instrumentals and said that they [...] "make the album a sonic feast".|$|E
500|$|Guitar Hero On Tour: Modern Hits was {{announced}} on March 5, 2009, and released on June 9, 2009. Reflecting its title, Modern Hits incorporates songs published {{within the last}} five years of its release, and the developers had to balance what songs were included {{in order to make a}} setlist with a wide appeal. The engine of the game has no major changes, but Vicarious Visions stated that it has continued to work on strum detection on the DS touchpad to meet a wide range of playstyles. The interface, however, has been revised over the previous two On Tour titles to feature a more modernized look (particularly in-game on the touch screen side). The game includes a new single player career progression using [...] "Fan Requests" [...] to create a new non-linear progression through the songs in the games. These were added to help move away from gameplay that was [...] "just going, playing a venue, and then <b>moving</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> one" [...] and instead to [...] "open the world up". The developers also noted that the Fan Requests helped to tap into the way that players had previously played games in the series, setting their own personal goals for certain songs. Audio designer Jason Willey created the game's theme song (titled [...] "S.U.P.R.A.H.U.M.A.N.") through his two-man band, Protoshredanoid, to capture the Modern Hits theme of the game, and after demonstrating a sampling of the song to the rest of the team, were asked to create the whole song. The theme song was released as a free download for Guitar Hero World Tour the week before the game's release.|$|E
500|$|In January 2003, {{the band}} rented {{a home in}} the San Diego luxury {{community}} of Rancho Santa Fe, planning to record the entire album there. In addition to the home being converted into a studio, pay-per-view pornography was on continuous play, and it included a space to [...] "smoke hella weed" [...] in the garage. The trio ditched their typical previous recording process (writing and demoing several songs and recording them in a studio one instrument at a time) and instead approached each song together. The band [...] "attacked" [...] each song and worked on three to four songs per day, simply <b>moving</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> one when feeling [...] "burned out" [...] on a track. The band also had fun at the home studio; DeLonge commented, [...] "If I wasn’t smoking half of Colombia I probably ran up $3 million in adult film charges." [...] The band recorded at the home until April 2003, when the owners of the house [...] "kicked them out." [...] Barker, unwilling to leave Moakler, would drive from Los Angeles to San Diego each day. He subsequently left that spring to tour with Transplants, leaving the band with a variety of drum tracks to listen to while he was gone. The band regrouped after being [...] "kicked out" [...] by the owners of the house they were recording in and began recording at Rolling Thunder studios until the band left to perform a couple of summer shows in Canada and Japan, where they premiered several songs live. The in-studio antics and behind the scenes moments were recorded and posted on the official Blink-182 website throughout 2003, as well as on a MTV album release segment.|$|E

2500|$|In a {{retrospective}} piece by Levi Buchanan of IGN, he praised the graphics and gameplay as being {{great for the}} aging Sega Genesis, but also asserted that the platform hurt the game's ability to succeed with sales and visibility, stating [...] "Ristar never stood a chance.

Sega was concentrating on the impending release of the Saturn and Sonic was still a monster success. And so Ristar was put to pasture." ...|$|E

2500|$|In modern {{dressage}} competition, successful {{training at}} the various levels is demonstrated through the performance of [...] "tests", prescribed series of movements ridden within a standard arena.
