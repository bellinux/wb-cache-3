40|$|The use of enzymes for hydrolysing starch in cane juices {{has been}} applied in South Africa for some years. Bacterial amylases, notably those derived from Bacillus subtilis, have the {{advantage}} of stability at higher temperatures. Factory trials have shown that application of less than 10 ppm of bacterial amylase can destroy over 85 % of the starch in mixed juice in fifteen minutes. Applications of enzymes to syrup and clarified juice have also yielded promising results. Historical The process of decomposition of starch in cane juice {{has been applied}} many times during the history of sugar production. Haddon and de Sornay reported on the high starch content of Uba cane in 1927. 9, 10 A year later Haddon reported the removal of starch from sorghum and Uba juice by the use of a malt amylase. " ^ l 2 Feuilherade reported on the experimental use of an enzyme "Uba~e". ~ Though the source of this enzyme was not disclosed, it appears that the price was in the region of four rand per pound. The enzyme was apparently of low activity as it had to be used at a rate of 100 ppm on juice. Feuilherade assumed that the starch was completely transformed into glucose, and based a quantitative determination on this assumption. Boyes 2 used malt enzyme for the decomposition of cane starch in juices and <b>massecuites,</b> but found that the price remained prohibitive for general application. In 1958 Nicholson and Horsley published the presence of an amylase in cane juice, and described a method for the elimination of cane starch in juice. 14 These authors reported a degree of starch decomposition of 80 - 90 %, and occasionally even higher, at a temperature of 70 °C and a pH 5. 7 to 5. 9. The "natural enzyme " method was used experimentally at various sugar factories in Natal and adopted as a standard practice by The Tongaat Sugar C~mpany. ~ Carter 6 published results with this process in which 50 to 60 % of the starch originally present was decomposed at a pH of 6. 5 in eight minutes. In the 1967168 season the average amount of starch decomposition was 70 % 4. During the 1967168 season several other South African sugar factories started to apply the natural enzyme process...|$|R

40|$|The {{practical}} {{possibility of}} using a straight two-boiling system was suggested to the author by the unexpected results obtained with a new battery of centrifugals during the 1957 grinding season.

The results obtained so far confirmed that, under controlled conditions, the machine produced a sugar which showed no significant difference (at 95 % confidence level) in purity and grain size analysis in comparison with the conventional. batch centrifugals. The average throughput for a locally acceptable VHP sugar was 2 12 metric tons of <b>massecuite</b> per hour. History Since 1968, Fives Cail Babock has manufactured and tested continuous centrifugals for the sugar industry. Initially these machines, equipped with 34 ' and 30 ' baskets, were designed to handle low purity <b>massecuite</b> and refinery magma respectively. However, in 1973, a machine equipped with a 30 ' basket was tested on 'B ' <b>massecuite,</b> and the results were encouraging. They confirmed that granulometric degradation, due to erosion of the crystal over the screens, was always negligible when compared to the destruction caused by the impact of the crystal on the monitor casing at high speed. Furthermore, the results obtained from these tests allowed the development of a mathematical correlation between <b>massecuite</b> granulometry, speed of impact and crystal destruction, and the forecast of optimum conditions to prevent destruction on impact. This empirical assessment prompted full scale research on the existing machines to extend this application to other higher grade products. Soon a wide range of commercial continuous machines made their appearance on the market, viz:-the FC 1000 GC 3 in 1975, the FC ZOO 0 SE 25 ' in 1977 and eventually, the FC 1000 GCV SE 25 O in 1979 for {{operating on}} 'A ' <b>massecuite</b> from cane.

A key feature of the design is the unique configuration of the fins, which ensures close proximity of every part of the <b>massecuite</b> to a heated surface.

40|$|The heat {{transfer}} and condensation of steam within the steam belt and the steam chest surrounding the calandria tubes of vacuum pans and evaporators were investigated using {{computational fluid dynamics}} (CFD) modelling techniques. The flow of steam in evaporators and vacuum pans is an aspect that is not usually given much attention but it can influence the productivity of these vessels. The latent heat of the steam provides the heat to the juice or <b>massecuite</b> which induces the formation of vapour bubbles and drives the circulation of the fluid within the vessel. Strong and uniform circulation of the <b>massecuite</b> in vacuum pans increases the production capacity and improves {{the quality of the}} sugar produced. Non-uniform heating by the steam {{on the outside of the}} calandria tubes can contribute to uneven and inconsistent {{heat transfer}} to the juice or <b>massecuite</b> within the vessel. As a consequence under these circumstances the installed heating surface is not effectively utilised. Inconsistent heating can affect the performance of vacuum pans since it influences the circulation of <b>massecuite</b> and the crystallisation rate of sugar. The CFD modelling investigation into the steam side operation of the calandria of vacuum pans and evaporators was preliminary in nature but has shown promising results. The results of the CFD simulations were compared against measured data to determine the applicability of the CFD model. The condensation physics of the CFD model currently has limitations, yet despite these, the CFD model has identified some deficiencies in the flow of steam within the calandria.

40|$|This chapter {{presents}} an {{experimental study of}} trajectory and shape of air bubbles and their effect on water, polymeric and <b>massecuite</b> equivalent non-Newtonian crystal suspensions when the bubbles rise. <b>Massecuite</b> is a fluid made from sugar crystals and sugar syrup (molasses) and is an important phase in raw sugar processing where vacuum pan (large cylindrical vessels with steam bubble rising through vertical heating surfaces) is used for sugar crystallisation. To study the bubble rise characteristics and their effect on flow in vacuum pan, various-suspensions were made by using different concentration of xanthan gum solutions with polystyrene crystal particles. The rheological properties for the solutions were measured using an Advanced Rheometric Expansion System (ARES) and the bubble size and bubble trajectory were measured {{using a combination of}} non-intrusive-high speed photographic method and digital image processing. A combination of different concentration of xanthan gum solutions with different concentrations of polystyrene crystal mixed with water were tested and characterized for the selection of the <b>massecuite</b> equivalent non-Newtonian fluid. The rheological results indicated that xanthan gum crystal suspensions exhibited shear thinning Power-Law flow behaviour and the solution with a concentration of 0. 05 % xanthan gum and 1 % crystal showed the closest similarities to the rheological properties of <b>massecuite</b> at low shear rate. The viscous effects of the xanthan gum solutions were more pronounced than elastic effects and this phenomenon was observed for a high grade <b>massecuite</b> solution. The loss modulus (G’’) and storage modulus (G’) of crystal suspensions were investigated. The effects of the crystal suspensions on the bubble rise flow characteristics are discussed. In particular, how the bubble trajectory and the bubble shape are affected is reported. Bubble trajectory inside the stagnant liquids in water, polymeric solutions and crystal suspension are investigated corresponding to a 1. 0 m height of liquid in the tube. The chapter also delineates the shapes observed in different liquids at three heights of liquid column when bubbles rise. The influences of the dimensionless numbers on the bubble trajectory and shape are reported and verified with the published literature.

The jigger system offers benefits to the pan’s performance throughout the entire pan cycle.
