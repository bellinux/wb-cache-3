50|$|Evaporites: Large {{evaporite}} {{reserves are}} present in the Sandling mountain, formed {{as a result of a}} major period of marine lowstand, when the sea level was low and the sea dried out. Panning and surface-level drift mining of the deposits dates back to Roman times, thanks to evidence from archaeological excavations in the 1990s, followed by similar local works from 200-400 AD. By 1147 the mines had become a commercial venture, controlled by the Rein Abbey near Graz. In 1211 the mines were nationalised by Leopold VI, Duke of Austria, who transferred control to Unterlupitsch. With operations later transferred to Bad Aussee, investment in 1319 allowed the opening of the Steinberg tunnel. Followed by further periods on investment, by 1334, the mines were operated under license by the private Hallinger Union who employed 120 people, producing about 10,000 <b>tonnes</b> <b>of</b> <b>product</b> per annum. Renationalised by Frederick III in 1445, 120 people produced circa 10,00 <b>tonnes</b> <b>of</b> <b>product</b> per annum until the early 20th century.
