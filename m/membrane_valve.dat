50|$|The {{people of}} Zigong have been {{drilling}} {{in the area for}} Salt since before the Han Dynasty (76-88 A.D.) to extract salt from brine. Some historian estimates are that China has been active in producing salt since about 6000 BC. The brine aquifers in the area have salinity of at least 50 grams per liter. The classical method of drilling and production was the following: a drilling rig is erected and a borehole is drilled using a drilling bit and rope. Brine is extracted by dropping a long tube down the borehole. A <b>membrane</b> <b>valve</b> then captures the brine for retrieval on the surface. Once the brine is retrieved it's then piped to flat pans for boiling. In the boiling process some water and crushed yellow soybean is added. The soybean absorbs the impurities in the salt. Once boiled, a yellow layer is formed - this is scraped off leaving absolutely pure salt. The salt is a medium grain salt with different size flakes which have a very strong and unique salt taste. This salt has no additives so it does clump. Locals use grains of rice in the salt to keep the salt from clumping.|$|E

The SMV {{is a system}} consisting of two mobile gas phases, one mobile liquid phase, and two membranes acting as interfaces between gas and liquid. Such a membrane system has supplementary variable parameters and is designated for the separation of multicomponent gas mixtures. System permeability for individual gases (CO 2, O 2, and H 2) and its dependence on a flow rate of a liquid phase are studied.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Microbubbles {{are used}} as {{contrast}} enhancing agents in ultrasound sonography and more recently have shown great potential as theranostic agents that enable both diagnostics and therapy. Conventional production methods lead to highly polydisperse microbubbles, which compromise the effectiveness of ultrasound imaging and therapy. Stabilizing microbubbles with surfactant molecules that can impart functionality and properties that are desirable for specific applications would enhance the utility of microbubbles. Here we generate monodisperse microbubbles with a large potential for functionalization by combining a microfluidic method and recombinant protein technology. Our microfluidic device uses an air-actuated <b>membrane</b> <b>valve</b> that enables production of monodisperse microbubbles with narrow size distribution. The size of microbubbles can be precisely tuned by dynamically changing the dimension of the channel using the valve. The microbubbles are stabilized by an amphiphilic protein, oleosin, which provides versatility in controlling the functionalization of microbubbles through recombinant biotechnology. We show that {{it is critical to}} control the composition of the stabilizing agents to enable formation of highly stable and monodisperse microbubbles that are echogenic under ultrasound insonation. Our protein-shelled microbubbles based on the combination of microfluidic generation and recombinant protein technology provide a promising platform for ultrasound-related applications. 1...|$|E
40|$|The mechanosensitive channel MscS is a {{ubiquitous}} bacterial <b>membrane</b> <b>valve</b> {{that opens}} by increased {{tension in the}} event of osmotic down-shock, releasing small internal osmolytes and thus preventing the cell from excessive hydration and possible lysis. This osmolyte release is accompanied by a reduction of osmotic pressure and volume of the cell, which simultaneously increases crowding. The large catalogue of MscS homologs in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes makes the study of this channel enticing to the field of physical biochemistry. Here are the results of three different studies, two of which focus on the gating of MscS in the presence of large osmolytes and amphipathic compounds and a third which describes the first electrophysiological examination of the inner membrane of the facultative pathogen Vibrio cholerae. The first study in Chapter 2 describes the sensitivity of gating transitions in MscS to large intracellular macromolecules. This sensitivity originates at the cytoplasmic cage domain and the perceived crowding alters the rate of opening, closing and inactivation. Chapter 3 details the utilization of MscS as a sensor for changes in the lateral pressure profile of native bilayers and how this technique can be used to resolve the potential of antibacterial agents to partition into the membrane. The third and final study describes our development of a procedure to generate giant spheroplasts of Vibrio cholerae and the subsequent characterization of its two major mechanosensitive channels in terms of gating, inactivation, conductivity, and compatible osmolyte sensitivity as well as the durability of the pathogen in response to osmotic shock. These contributions to the field of mechanobiology and channel biophysics suggest that environmental feedback during osmoregulation is recognized by the cell, provide a potential method to monitor the partitioning of antibiotics into a cell membrane, and lastly detail the mechano-electrical response of a relevant, disease-causing bacteria...|$|E

40|$|The {{development}} of MEMS requires deliberate designs for controlling fluids {{in the low}} Reynolds number regime. Arranging surface charges in rectangular channels to obtain inplane or out-of-plane vortices have been studied by previous researchers. However, previous surface modification techniques require different signs of zeta potentials from the other wall surfaces which made it difficult in selecting and coating microchannels. Previously, the opposite polarities are usually adjusted by changing the pH value of the solution with acid chemicals in other researches which made the solution complicated and difficult to simulate a real application. Meanwhile the acid chemicals may also destroy the coating. It is convenient to use same polarity patches if a vortex flow can also be generated. However, {{it is not clear}} if the patterned surface charges have the same polarity of zeta potentials as the other walls, what kind flow pattern will be generated and what mechanism behind the flow pattern. Furthermore, the cross-section of previously studied microchannels is usually limited to a rectangular shape. Therefore, the surface charge patterns are usually in 2 D since the sidewalls of the rectangular microchannels are difficult to be patterned. However, a channel with round cross-section has better leak-proof performance of the <b>membrane</b> <b>valve.</b> Furthermore, a round channel is also advantageous in mimicking the human vein when a vascular structure is needed in tissue scaffolding, the round microfluidic channel is considered as a good candidate for an artificial capillary vessel. It is anticipated {{that there will be no}} stagnation occurs at the corner edges, which occurs at the corners of a rectangular channel, for a round microchannel owing to the perfectly symmetrical velocity profile. This is important when the microfluidic chip is subjected to a separation process such as liquid chromatography. In this paper, effects of patterned surface modification on 3 D vortex flows generation in a micro capillary tube under very low Reynolds number have been investigated. Microfabrication technology was successfully employed to pattern surface charges on inner surfaces of round capillary tubes, which form non-uniform zeta-potentials. This technique extends the heterogeneous surfaces from flat surface to curved surface. 3 D vortices are visualized and measured at the vicinity of tube walls when an electric field is applied across the surfaces utilizing micro resolution PIV. It demonstrated that 3 D vortices can also be generated by the patterned surface charges with a same polarity. Experimental results have been compared with the numerical simulations using CFD-ACE+.
