60|$|Cole fumbled in {{the dark}} until he found a flashlight. Power failure. He could hear {{crackling}} flames. Abruptly the lights came on again, an ugly yellow, then faded back out. Cole bent down and examined the door with his flashlight. A <b>magnetic</b> <b>lock.</b> Dependent on an externally induced electric flux. He grabbed a screwdriver and pried at the door. For a moment it held. Then it fell open.|$|E
50|$|Before using a <b>magnetic</b> <b>lock,</b> the Fire Marshal or {{appropriate}} authority should be consulted. There are emergency egress issues {{that must be}} addressed before using a <b>magnetic</b> <b>lock.</b>|$|E
50|$|The <b>magnetic</b> <b>lock</b> {{should always}} be {{installed}} on the secure side of the door. Most installations are surface mounted. For safety, <b>magnetic</b> <b>lock,</b> cables, and wires should be routed through the door frame or flush mount with wire moulding.|$|E
5000|$|Remote operation: <b>Magnetic</b> <b>locks</b> can {{be turned}} on and off {{remotely}} by adjusting the power source.|$|R
50|$|Many exit control locks {{are based}} on <b>magnetic</b> <b>locks</b> also delayed egress <b>magnetic</b> <b>locks</b> which will not allow the door to open immediately, this allows a guard {{to get to the}} door before the door opens (see ROFU Delayed Egress 8011-004), it will also release if there is a fire alarm or power failure, but {{otherwise}} these locks hold the exit doors shut. These units are also common in Alzheimer units.|$|R
5000|$|Easy to install: <b>Magnetic</b> <b>locks</b> are {{generally}} easier to install than other locks {{since there are}} no interconnecting parts.|$|R
50|$|Although {{the actual}} {{performance}} of a <b>magnetic</b> <b>lock</b> may differ substantially due to various losses (such as flux leakage between the electromagnet and the conductor), the equations give a good insight into {{what is necessary to}} produce a strong <b>magnetic</b> <b>lock.</b> For example, the force of the lock is proportional to the square of the relative permeability of the magnetic core. Given the relative permeability of a material can vary from around 250 for cobalt to around 5000 for soft iron and 7000 for silicon-iron, the choice of magnetic core can therefore have an important impact upon the strength of a <b>magnetic</b> <b>lock.</b> Also relevant is the choice of current, number of loops and effective length of the electromagnet.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>magnetic</b> <b>lock</b> has a {{metal plate}} {{surrounded}} by a coil of wire that can be magnetized. The number of coils determines the holding force which characterizes the lock: ...|$|E
50|$|Noticed by the {{abnormal}} {{situation on}} the thrust lever, investigators then examined it. The power levers should have prevented to move from flight idle to ground idle during flight by the function of Electric <b>Magnetic</b> <b>Lock</b> Systems and Mechanical Power Lever Stop Slot. At the accident aircraft {{was found that the}} electric <b>magnetic</b> <b>lock</b> system (Power Lever lock) was on open position. With power lever lock on open position, the solenoid of the electric <b>magnetic</b> <b>lock</b> system disengage and allow the power lever moves to ground idle in flight whenever the mechanical power lever stop slots lifted. Based on simulator test conducted by the NTSC, if the engine entered this condition, the aircraft would lose lift and eventually descended rapidly. The movement of power lever to ground idle will result to the propeller pitch angle changes to low pitch angle which produces significant drag. The NTSC stated that because it happened on 112 ft, it was impossible to not crash.|$|E
5000|$|Quick to operate: <b>Magnetic</b> <b>locks</b> unlock {{instantly}} {{when the}} power is cut, allowing for quick release in comparison to other locks.|$|R
50|$|<b>Magnetic</b> <b>locks</b> {{possess a}} number of {{advantages}} over conventional locks and electric strikes. For example, their durability and quick operation can make them valuable in a high-traffic office environment where electronic authentication is necessary.|$|R
50|$|Some {{sliding doors}} contain a motor and {{activation}} system to open them. These are called sliding door operators. Automatic sliding doors are {{commonly found in}} offices and shop entrances. These doors contain a <b>magnetic</b> <b>locking</b> mechanism that automatically unlocks during emergencies.|$|R
50|$|Other {{variations}} {{and improvements}} on the electromagnetic locks have been developed. The most remarkable is the shear lock, where the armature {{does not directly}} pull off the face, but the load is instead in shear, like a mechanical stop. The shear <b>magnetic</b> <b>lock</b> allows a door to swing in both directions, {{as opposed to the}} original (and now ubiquitous) direct pull type, which normally works either in an in-swing or out-swing configuration. In order to provide the shear <b>magnetic</b> <b>lock</b> with the appropriate holding force, then two pins lock the armature onto the magnet itself, and ensure that the magnet locks into place.|$|E
5000|$|Sturdy: Magnetic locks {{may also}} suffer less damage from {{multiple}} blows than do conventional locks. If a <b>magnetic</b> <b>lock</b> is forced {{open with a}} crowbar, it will often do little or no damage to the door or lock. There are no moving parts in an electromagnetic lock to break.|$|E
5000|$|Fail-safe. Also called fail-open. In this configuration, {{applying}} {{electric current}} to the strike will {{cause it to}} lock. It operates {{the same as a}} <b>magnetic</b> <b>lock</b> would. If there is a power failure, the door opens merely by being pushed or pulled. Fail-safe units are always operated with direct current.|$|E
50|$|<b>Magnetic</b> <b>locks</b> {{are almost}} always part of a {{complete}} electronic security system. Such a system may simply consist of an attached keycard reader or may be more complex, involving connection to a central computer that monitors the building's security. Whatever the choice of locking system, fire safety is an important consideration.|$|R
40|$|We {{review the}} <b>magnetic</b> <b>locking</b> {{of the white}} dwarf and the {{companion}} star in AM Herculis-type binaries for various white dwarf magnetic field structures, and compare the theoretical results with observations. The model in which the white dwarf has a dipole plus a quadrupole field {{is found to be}} in closest agreement with the recent observations...|$|R
50|$|In 1857 Sargent had {{designed}} the Sargent's <b>Magnetic</b> Bank <b>Lock,</b> {{said to be}} the first successful key changeable combination lock.|$|R
50|$|There {{are many}} {{manufacturers}} of electric strikes, {{and there are}} many things that have to be considered when buying one, i.e., type of jamb, type of locking hardware, whether one requires fail-secure or fail-safe, length of latch, depth of jamb, voltage requirements and the length of the faceplate. In some cases it is a good option to choose a <b>magnetic</b> <b>lock.</b>|$|E
50|$|The <b>magnetic</b> <b>lock</b> is {{suitable}} for both in-swinging and out-swinging doors. Brackets (L bracket, LZ bracket, U bracket) are used to orient the armature for use with both applications. Filler plates are also used to provide a large, flat mounting area on the door frame when the electromagnet {{is larger than the}} available mounting space on the door frame due to the frame's geometry.|$|E
5000|$|Unlike IP readers, most IP {{controllers}} do {{not support}} PoE. This, however, may change if the PoE technology is improved to deliver more power, or low-power controllers and locks are introduced. Based on the current PoE standards power that can be carried by a single network cable is enough for one IP reader and an electric strike or a <b>magnetic</b> <b>lock,</b> but connecting an IP controller and 2 or more electric locks would require more power than available via PoE.|$|E
50|$|A <b>magnetic</b> keyed <b>lock</b> is a locking {{mechanism}} whereby the key utilizes magnets {{as part of}} the locking and un{{locking mechanism}}.|$|R
5000|$|The {{second most}} common risk is from levering a door open. This is {{relatively}} difficult on properly secured doors with strikes or high holding force <b>magnetic</b> <b>locks.</b> Fully implemented access control systems include forced door monitoring alarms. These vary in effectiveness, usually failing from high false positive alarms, poor database configuration, or lack of active intrusion monitoring. Most newer access control systems incorporate some type of door prop alarm to inform system administrators of a door left open longer than a specified length of time.|$|R
50|$|Boxes called secret boxes or puzzle {{boxes with}} secret opening {{mechanisms}} extremely popular in Japan, {{are included in}} this category. These caskets contain more or less complex, usually invisible opening mechanisms which reveal a small hollow space on opening. There is a vast variety of opening mechanisms, such as hardly visible panels which need to be shifted, inclination mechanisms, <b>magnetic</b> <b>locks,</b> movable pins which need to be rotated into a certain position up and even time locks in which an object has {{to be held in}} a given position until a liquid has filled up a certain container.|$|R
5000|$|The {{power for}} an {{electromagnet}} lock is DC (Direct Current), around 5-6 W. The current is around 0.5 A when the voltage supply is 12VDC and [...]25A when using 24VDC (varies between manufacturers {{and if there}} are one or two coils in the block). It is also recommended to verify that the <b>magnetic</b> <b>lock</b> carries the UL mark. Generally, the specification of the electromagnet lock is dual voltage of 12/24 VDC.. If using a rectifier to convert AC power, a full wave bridge rectifier should be used.|$|E
50|$|An {{improved}} 'shear' electromagnetic lock was patented on May 2, 1989, by Arthur, Richard and David Geringer of Security Door Controls, {{an access}} control hardware manufacturing firm. The device outlined in their designs {{was the same}} in principle as the modern <b>magnetic</b> <b>lock</b> consisting of an electromagnet and an armature plate. The patent did not make any reference to the manufacturing methods of the electromagnet and detailed several variations on the design, including one that used a spring-loaded armature plate to bring the armature plate closer to the electromagnet. The patent expired on May 2, 2009.|$|E
50|$|The <b>magnetic</b> <b>lock</b> relies {{upon some}} of the basic {{concepts}} of electromagnetism. Essentially it consists of an electromagnet attracting a conductor with a force large enough to prevent the door from being opened. In a more detailed examination, the device makes use of the fact that a current through one or more loops of wire (known as a solenoid) produces a magnetic field. This works in free space, but if the solenoid is wrapped around a ferromagnetic core such as soft iron the effect of the field is greatly amplified. This is because the internal magnetic domains of the material align with each other to greatly enhance the magnetic flux density.|$|E
50|$|A {{number of}} {{inexpensive}} safes sold to households for under $100 use mechanical locking mechanisms that {{are vulnerable to}} bouncing. Many cheap safes use a <b>magnetic</b> <b>locking</b> pin to prevent lateral movement of an internal locking bolt, and use a solenoid to move the pin when the correct code is entered. This pin can also be moved by {{the impact of the}} safe being dropped or struck while on its side, which allows the safe to be opened. One security researcher taught his three-year-old son how to open most consumer gun safes. More expensive safes use a gear mechanism that is less susceptible to mechanical attacks.|$|R
50|$|In the 2011-2012 {{school year}} {{security}} was {{increased in the}} building {{with the addition of}} new security cameras and <b>magnetic</b> <b>locks</b> installed on exterior doors, allowing exterior doors to be unlocked during class changes and locked automatically after. Building wide Wi-Fi was also added for student use on school-given computers, but is not available for individual cell phone usage. BHS is also experimenting with textbook free classes, loaning students MacBook Airs to use in the classroom and to complete classwork assignments at home (online, in lieu of going to the classroom). At the current time this school does not use textbooks in math classes. All other classes use textbooks.|$|R
50|$|Security in the Newcombe wing is {{considerably}} tighter {{than that of}} its Eddy and Annex counterparts. Access to Newcombe is controlled by doors featuring Dalcard (student ID) card readers and <b>magnetic</b> <b>locks.</b> The increased security is to prevent non-Newcombe residents from entering the house without an escort. A strict male escort policy is in effect, requiring all male visitors to remain at most one arm's length from their host while in the hallways between 8pm and 10am each night. In the {{years leading up to}} Shirreff Hall becoming co-ed, the escort policy was in place at all times throughout the building. Prior to that, other policies were in place, including a guest sign-in policy.|$|R
5000|$|Typical {{single door}} {{electromagnetic}} locks {{are offered in}} both 600 lbs.(272 kg) and 1200 lbs. (544 kg) dynamic holding force capacities. A [...] "fail safe" [...] <b>magnetic</b> <b>lock</b> requires power to remain locked and typically is not suitable for high security applications because {{it is possible to}} disable the lock by disrupting the power supply. Despite this, by adding a magnetic bond sensor to the lock and by using a power supply that includes a battery backup capability, some specialized higher security applications can be implemented. Electromagnetic locks are well suited for use on emergency exit doors that have fire safety applications because they have no moving parts and are therefore less likely to fail than other types of electric locks, such as electric strikes.|$|E
5000|$|An {{electromagnetic}} lock, <b>magnetic</b> <b>lock,</b> or maglock is a {{locking device}} {{that consists of}} an electromagnet and an armature plate. There are two main types of electric locking devices. Locking devices can be either [...] "fail safe" [...] or [...] "fail secure". A fail-secure locking device remains locked when power is lost. Fail-safe locking devices are unlocked when de-energized. Direct pull electromagnetic locks are inherently fail-safe. Typically the electromagnet portion of the lock {{is attached to the}} door frame and a mating armature plate is attached to the door. The two components are in contact when the door is closed. When the electromagnet is energized, a current passing through the electromagnet creates a magnetic flux that causes the armature plate to attract to the electromagnet, creating a locking action. Because the mating area of the electromagnet and armature is relatively large, the force created by the magnetic flux is strong enough to keep the door locked even under stress.|$|E
5000|$|The {{most basic}} type of {{electronic}} lock is a <b>magnetic</b> <b>lock</b> (informally called a [...] "mag lock"). A large electro-magnet {{is mounted on}} the door frame and a corresponding armature is mounted on the door. When the magnet is powered and the door is closed, the armature is held fast to the magnet. Mag locks are simple to install and are very attack-resistant. One drawback is that improperly installed or maintained mag locks can fall on people, and also that one must unlock the mag lock to both enter and to leave. This has caused fire marshals to impose strict rules {{on the use of}} mag locks and access control practice in general. Additionally, NFPA 101 (Standard for Life Safety and Security), as well as the ADA (Americans with Disability Act) require [...] "no prior knowledge" [...] and [...] "one simple movement" [...] to allow [...] "free egress". This means that in an emergency, a person must be able to move to a door and immediately exit with one motion (requiring no push buttons, having another person unlock the door, reading a sign, or [...] "special knowledge").|$|E
50|$|The {{strength}} of today's <b>magnetic</b> <b>locks</b> compares well {{with that of}} conventional door locks and they cost less than conventional light bulbs to operate. There are additional pieces of release hardware installed in a typical electromagnetic locking system. Since electromagnetic locks do not interact with levers or door knobs on a door, typically a separate release button that cuts the lock power supply is mounted near the door. This button usually has a timer that, once the button is pressed, keeps the lock unlocked for either 15 or 30 seconds in accordance with NFPA fire codes. Additionally a second release is required by fire code. Either a motion sensor or crash bar with internal switch is used to unlock to door on the egress {{side of the door}} automatically.|$|R
50|$|The stator of an {{induction}} motor consists of poles carrying supply current to induce {{a magnetic field}} that penetrates the rotor. To optimize {{the distribution of the}} magnetic field, windings are distributed in slots around the stator, with the magnetic field having the same number of north and south poles. Induction motors are most commonly run on single-phase or three-phase power, but two-phase motors exist; in theory, {{induction motor}}s can have any number of phases. Many single-phase motors having two windings can be viewed as two-phase motors, since a capacitor is used to generate a second power phase 90° from the single-phase supply and feeds it to the second motor winding. Single-phase motors require some mechanism to produce a rotating field on startup. Cage induction motor rotor's conductor bars are typically skewed to avoid <b>magnetic</b> <b>locking.</b>|$|R

We suggest an analysis in terms of two distinct magnetic couplings, associated with two ferromagnetic media involved into a collective state...|$|R
