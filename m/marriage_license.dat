5|$|By 1944, Skelton {{was engaged}} to actress Muriel Morris, who was also known as Muriel Chase; the couple had {{obtained}} a <b>marriage</b> <b>license</b> and told the press they intended to marry within a few days. At the last minute, the actress decided not to marry him, initially saying she intended to marry a wealthy businessman in Mexico City. She later recanted the story about marrying the businessman, but continued to say that her relationship with Skelton was over. The actress further denied {{that the reason for}} the breakup was Edna's continuing to manage her ex-husband's career; Edna stated that she had no intention of either getting {{in the middle of the}} relationship or reconciling with her former husband.|$|E
5|$|Davis {{contacted}} Beshear, {{asking for}} an executive order to protect clerks who have moral objections against personally issuing such marriage licenses, as Kentucky law requires county clerks to issue marriage licenses in their names. She began turning away gay couples from her county office who were seeking marriage licenses. David Ermold and David Moore, a same-sex couple from Morehead, Kentucky and alumni of Morehead State University, released video footage on July 7, 2015 of Davis refusing to issue them a <b>marriage</b> <b>license</b> and requesting that they turn off their camera. The video went viral overnight.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} law was passed, {{questions}} arose about {{the legal status of}} marriage to non-Spaniards after a Spaniard and an Indian national living in Catalonia were denied a <b>marriage</b> <b>license</b> on the grounds that India did not permit same-sex marriage. However, on 22 July, another judge in Catalonia married a Spanish woman and her Argentinian national partner (the first same-sex marriage between women in Spain). This judge disagreed with his colleague's decision and gave preference to the right of marriage over Argentinian law at the time not allowing same-sex marriage.|$|E
50|$|Cook County Clerk David Orr {{announced}} his office would accept applications for <b>marriage</b> <b>licenses</b> immediately. His office fulfilled 46 requests for <b>marriage</b> <b>licenses</b> from same-sex couples that day. On February 26, 2014, Champaign County clerk officials, citing the ruling in Lee v.

5|$|According to the New England Historical Genealogical Society, {{several members}} of Warren's {{maternal}} family claim Cherokee heritage; the Society found a family newsletter that alluded to a <b>marriage</b> <b>license</b> application that listed Elizabeth Warrenâ€™s great-great-great grandmother as a Cherokee, but {{could not find the}} primary document and found no proof of Warren's Native American heritage. The Oklahoma Historical Society stated that finding a definitive answer about Native American heritage can be difficult because of intermarriage and deliberate avoidance of registration. Some members of the Cherokee Nation protested her claim to Native American ancestry and questioned whether she benefitted from it. Former colleagues and supervisors at the universities where she had worked (including Charles Fried, former Solicitor General under President Ronald Reagan) said Warren's ancestry was either not mentioned, or played no role in her hiring.|$|E
5|$|Davis {{returned}} to work a week later, on , 2015. She said that, while she would not interfere with any deputy clerk who issues marriage licenses, she would not personally issue or authorize any of the forms. She created several altered versions of the Kentucky <b>marriage</b> <b>license</b> form and instructed her deputy clerks to use them, which had her name and reference to the clerk's office removed. The ACLU sued Davis separately for these form alterations, which they found to be of questionable legality. Governor Steve Beshear was asked by Bunning to brief the court on {{the validity of the}} licenses. Governor Beshear acknowledged that Kentucky would recognize the licenses being issued, but he could not verify the legality of the licenses issued or the means by which the marriage licenses were altered. Bunning ultimately denied the ACLU's separate suit, stating the altered forms were likely legal and that Davis was now abiding by the court's order.|$|E
5|$|Marriage {{plans were}} {{confirmed}} and Poe returned to Baltimore {{to file for}} a <b>marriage</b> <b>license</b> on September 22, 1835. The couple might have been quietly married as well, though accounts are unclear.

Poe was 27 and Virginia was 13, though her age was listed as 21. This marriage bond was filed in Richmond and included an affidavit from Thomas W. Cleland confirming the bride's alleged age. The ceremony {{was held in the}} evening at the home of a Mrs. James Yarrington, the owner of the boarding house in which Poe, Virginia, and Virginia's mother Maria Clemm were staying. Yarrington helped Maria Clemm bake the wedding cake and prepared a wedding meal. The couple then had a short honeymoon in Petersburg, Virginia.|$|E
2500|$|Immediately {{following}} {{the decision in}} Kitchen, the Boulder County clerk immediately began issuing <b>marriage</b> <b>licenses</b> despite the stay. After a state district court refused to stop the clerk (see Colorado ex rel. Suthers v.

The court order came hours after Martinez said she would not issue same-sex <b>marriage</b> <b>licenses</b> unless ordered to do so, declaring, [...] "I have to follow the law, and the law requires that <b>marriage</b> <b>licenses</b> state the male and female." ...|$|R

5|$|Sharon Elizabeth Hall {{was born}} on November 30, 1939, in Independence, Missouri. When she was in junior high, Doris and Eugene Hall moved the family to Washington, {{but by the time}} Sharon was fifteen they had {{returned}} to Missouri, where Sharon attended William Chrisman High School. Sixteen-year-old Sharon met twenty-two-year-old college student James Kinne at a church function in the summer of 1956, and the couple dated regularly until Kinne returned to Brigham Young University in the fall. Sharon, reportedly deeply interested in finding a partner with prospects and who could take her away from Independence, soon wrote a letter to Kinne at school informing him that she was pregnant by him. Kinne took leave from his college and returned to Independence, where he married Sharon on October 18, 1956. The couple's <b>marriage</b> <b>license</b> identified sixteen-year-old Sharon as being eighteen and a widow; though she later refused to address the assertion, Sharon told people at the time that she had been married when she lived in Washington, to a man who later died in a car accident. The new couple held a second, more formal wedding the next year in the Salt Lake Temple, after Sharon had completed the process of converting to Mormonism.|$|E
25|$|In May 2009, the Alameda County Clerk-Registrar, Patrick O'Connell, denied Kristin Perry and Sandra Stier a <b>marriage</b> <b>license</b> {{because they}} are a {{same-sex}} couple.

25|$|Before December 2013 New Mexico law neither {{explicitly}} allowed nor prohibited same-sex marriage. Policy {{concerning the}} issuance of <b>marriage</b> <b>licenses</b> to same-sex couples was determined at the county level; that is, some county clerks issued <b>marriage</b> <b>licenses</b> to same-sex couples, while others did not. In December 2013, the New Mexico Supreme Court issued a unanimous ruling directing all county clerks to issue <b>marriage</b> <b>licenses</b> to same-sex couples, thereby making New Mexico the 17th state to recognize same-sex marriage at the statewide level.|$|R
50|$|On November 5, 2014, a {{state court}} ruling {{striking}} down Missouri's same-sex marriage ban ordered the City of St. Louis to issue <b>marriage</b> <b>licenses</b> to same-sex couples. In {{response to this}} ruling, St. Louis County also began issuing <b>marriage</b> <b>licenses</b> to same-sex couples. On November 7, 2014, a federal court ruling striking down Missouri's same-sex marriage ban stayed its order directing Jackson County to issue licenses to same-sex couples.

25|$|All {{of these}} marriages were {{authorized}} {{by calling the}} banns in the spouses' churches.

50|$|At least 1,640 {{same-sex}} couples married in Minnesota from August to September 2013, representing {{one-third of all}} marriages celebrated during that time. 75% of same-sex <b>marriage</b> <b>licenses</b> were issued in Hennepin County and Ramsey County. Approximately 1,433 <b>marriage</b> <b>licenses</b> were issued in the twelve counties that rejected Minnesota Amendment 1 in 2012, the constitutional amendment which sought to ban same-sex marriage. Of the counties that favored the amendment, Clay County issued the most <b>marriage</b> <b>licenses</b> with 31.

Coosa County continued to deny <b>marriage</b> <b>licenses</b> specifically to same-sex couples, citing [...] "technical difficulties" [...] but admitting that it had no plans to remedy the situation.|$|R
50|$|In August 2013, County Clerk Lynn Ellins {{announced}} he will begin granting <b>marriage</b> <b>licenses</b> to same-sex couples. Ellins {{said in a}} statement explaining his decision: After careful review of New Mexico's laws {{it is clear that the}} state's marriage statutes are gender neutral and do not expressly prohibit DoÃ±a Ana County from issuing <b>marriage</b> <b>licenses</b> to same-gender couples. Any further denial of <b>marriage</b> <b>licenses</b> to these couples violates the United States and New Mexico Constitution and the New Mexico Human Rights Act. DoÃ±a Ana County is upholding New Mexico law by issuing these <b>marriage</b> <b>licenses,</b> and I see no reason to make committed couples in DoÃ±a Ana County wait another minute to marry. Several Republican state legislators vowed to file suit against Ellins in a bid to halt the licenses from being issued.|$|R
