500|$|Scott Lasley, a {{political}} science professor at Western Kentucky University and chairman of the Warren County Republican Party, criticized Bevin's appearance at the rally, saying, [...] "Either they were totally unvetted and unprepared for it, which says a lot about the campaign and its ability to compete at this level, or...they think that message is going to be receptive. Otherwise you don't go there." [...] On April 25, 2014, Bevin apologized for attending the event, saying [...] "I am genuinely sorry that my attendance at an event which, other than <b>my</b> <b>comments,</b> appears to have primarily involved a discussion of cockfighting, has created concern on the part of many Kentucky voters. I understand that concern. I am not and have never been a supporter of cockfighting or any other forms of animal cruelty." [...] The Daily Beast said the issue could be the [...] "nail in the coffin" [...] for Bevin's campaign, while The Washington Post wrote, [...] "On its own, the cockfighting story isn't enough to sink Bevin's campaign. But viewed in the context of the string of other distractions he's had to deal with, it reinforces the reality that his campaign is in serious need of repairs down the stretch." ...|$|E

2500|$|During a {{visit to}} Germany in January 2013, Morsi again stated that his remarks were taken out of context, insisting that they were {{intended}} as a criticism of Israel's policies toward the Palestinians. Addressing reporters, Morsi stated that [...] " [...] not against the Jewish faith or the Jewish people. <b>My</b> <b>comments</b> were about conduct that sheds blood and kills innocent people– things neither I... nor anyone condones... <b>My</b> <b>comments</b> were about the conduct and manners, the killings and the aggression by tanks and warplanes and cluster bombs and internationally banned weapons against innocent people."

2500|$|On 28 June 2010, {{following}} England's {{departure from}} the 2010 FIFA World Cup competition in South Africa, the UK's Culture and Sport Secretary Jeremy Hunt praised the England fans for their behaviour during the competition, saying [...] "I mean, not a single arrest for a football-related offence, and the terrible problems {{that we had in}} Heysel and Hillsborough in the 1980s seem now to be behind us." [...] He later apologised and said [...] "I know that fan unrest played no part in the terrible events of April 1989 and I apologise to Liverpool fans and the families of those killed and injured in the Hillsborough disaster if <b>my</b> <b>comments</b> caused any offence." [...] Margaret Aspinall, chairperson of the Hillsborough Family Support Group, asked for a face to face meeting with Hunt before deciding if she would accept the apology.|$|E

40|$|The Legal Structure of the Firm {{presents}} two core points. First, it {{argues that}} economic {{reality of the}} modern business enterprise, what it calls the firm, is different from and much broader than the legal entity or entities into which it is organized. <b>My</b> <b>comment</b> will argue that this first point is correct, well presented here, and a real contribution to our understanding. Second, The Legal Structure of the Firm argues that this separation between the legal entity and the business reality is a good thing, enabling positive asset partitioning and other positive attributes of capital formation which should be preserved. <b>My</b> <b>comment</b> will argue that this point is at best incompletely supported and most likely misdirected. ...|$|R

40|$|<b>My</b> <b>Comment,</b> “Is Tiger Woods’s Swing Really a Work of Art? Defining the Line Between the Right of Publicity and the First Amendment,” {{focuses on}} the {{controversial}} “right of publicity,” a legal doctrine which is now recognized {{in the majority of}} states either at common law or by statute. The right of publicity allows athletes and celebrities to exclude others from using an entertainer’s likeness or image absent express permission. Although advocates claim that the right is needed to allow celebrities to profit from their own labor and goodwill, <b>my</b> <b>Comment</b> outlines how the right of publicity endangers traditional First Amendment liberties.

60|$|I {{have added}} a few more {{chapters}} {{in the manner of}} the old ones, and would have added others, but one loses, as one grows older, something of the lightness of one's dreams; one begins to take life up in both hands, and to care more for the fruit than the flower, and that is no great loss per haps. In these new chapters, as in the old ones, I have invented nothing but <b>my</b> <b>comments</b> and one or two deceitful sentences that may keep some poor story-teller's commerce with the devil and his angels, or the like, from being known among his neighbours. I shall publish in a little while a big book about the commonwealth of faery, and shall try to make it systematical and learned enough to buy pardon for this handful of dreams.|$|E
60|$|She {{turned at}} once and we made a few paces; not too far to take us {{out of sight of}} the hotel door, but very nearly. I could just keep my eyes on it. After all, I had not been so very long with the girl. If you were to {{disentangle}} the words we actually exchanged from <b>my</b> <b>comments</b> you would see that they were not so very many, including everything she had so unexpectedly told me of her story. No, not so very many. And now it seemed as though there would be no more. No! I could expect no more. The confidence was wonderful enough in its nature as far as it went, and perhaps not to have been expected from any other girl under the sun. And I felt a little ashamed. The origin of our intimacy was too gruesome. It was as if listening to her I had taken advantage of having seen her poor bewildered, scared soul without its veils. But I was curious, too; or, to render myself justice without false modesty--I was anxious; anxious to know a little more.|$|E
60|$|Mrs Monnerie yawned her way on--though <b>my</b> <b>comments</b> {{on these}} marvels of human {{enterprise}} occasionally amused her. I made amends, too, by accompanying her to less well-advertised show-places, and patiently {{sat with her}} while she fondled unset and antique gems in a jeweller's, or inspected the china, miniatures, and embroideries in private collections. If the mere look of the books in the British Museum gave me a headache, it is curious that the Chamber of Horrors at Madame Tussaud's Wax Works did not. And yet I don't know; life itself had initiated me into this freemasonry. I surveyed the guillotine without a shudder, and eyed Mr Hare and Charles Peace with far less discomposure than General Tom Thumb, or even Robert Burns in the respectable gallery above. My one misfortune was that I could look at no murderer without instantly recomposing the imaginary scene of his crime within my mind. And as after a while Mrs Monnerie decided to rest on a chair set for her by the polite attendant under the scaffold, {{and we had the}} Chamber nearly to ourselves, I wandered on alone, and perhaps supped rather too full of horrors for one evening.|$|E

40|$|After several {{rounds of}} revisions, the American Economic Review has {{accepted}} a Reply to <b>my</b> <b>Comment</b> (Rothstein, forthcoming) on Caroline Hoxbys Does Competition Among Public Schools Benefit Students and Taxpayers (Hoxby 2000). The Reply (Hoxby, forthcoming) is deeply flawed. It badly misstates {{the import of}} my comment; only briefly addresses my primary argument; and gets many important facts wrong. In this rejoinder, I attempt to clarify matters. Although Hoxby purports to refute <b>my</b> <b>Comment,</b> <b>my</b> central conclusions are undisputed: 1) Hoxby has not made available the data that were used for her original paper. 2) Hoxbys basic result holds only when we rely on her specific construction of the larger streams variable. She has never presented estimates that do not rely on this variable; all such estimates that I have computed yield small, insignificant effects of choice on test scores. 3) There are several odd aspects of Hoxbys particular larger streams variable that cast doubt on its validity. 4) There are serious errors in both the program code and data that Hoxby has distributed. Hoxby has not released the code {{that was used in}} her Reply, but she offers no indication that these errors have been repaired. The Replys discussion of these issues is circuitous and masked by extensive, combative digressions about irrelevant points, and even careful readers who lack access to the underlying data may be misled. This rejoinder attempts to clarify these issues. Tables 1 - 3 present the primary estimates that underlie my claims. Section I details the case {{for each of the four}} basic facts. Section II discusses Hoxbys Reply, nearly all of which is irrelevant to the core claims of <b>my</b> <b>Comment.</b> I do not take up the issue of Hoxbys aspersions against my motives and character that appeared in earlier drafts o...|$|R
