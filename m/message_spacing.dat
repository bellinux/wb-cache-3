RAMS protocol data units are encapsulated in ION bundles and are forwarded to the neighboring RAMS gateways identified in the source gateway s AMS management information base.

40|$|Group {{communication}} (or multicast) is {{a powerful}} abstraction {{that can be used}} whenever groups of distributed processes cooperate for the execution of a given task. Due to the uncertainties inherent to distributed systems (emerging from communication or process failures), multicast messages may arrive in an inconsistent order at different destination processes. Further complications will arise when groups overlap (i. e. a process is allowed to belong to distinct groups). In this paper, we address the problem of causal order violation in message delivery. We present three causal order protocols for overlapping groups with different trade-offs between <b>message</b> <b>space</b> overhead and <b>message</b> delivery delays.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the informational requirements of resource allocation processes for convex production economies. First, we establish a lower bound of the <b>message</b> <b>space</b> of an informationally decentralized mechanism that realizes Pareto e±-cient allocations over the class of classical production economies. Then, it is shown that this lower bound is exactly the size of the <b>message</b> <b>space</b> of the competitive (Walrasian) mechanism, and thus the competitive mechanism is informationally e±cient for general neo-classical production economies in the sense that it uses the smallest <b>message</b> <b>space</b> among the class of resource allocation processes that are informationally decentralized and real-ize Pareto optimal allocations. Further, it is shown that the competitive mechanism is the unique informationally e±cient decentralized mechanism that realizes Pareto e±cient and individually rational allocations.

40|$|Abstract. The Data Encryption Standard (DES) defines an indexed set of {{permutations}} {{acting on}} the <b>message</b> <b>space</b> ~ = { 0, 1 } 64. If this set of permutations were closed under functional composition, then the two most popular proposals for strengthening DES through multiple encryption would be equivalent to single encryption. Moreover, DES would be vulnerable to a known-plaintext attack that runs in 22 s steps on the average. It is unknown in the open literature whether or not DES has this weakness. Two statistical tests are presented for determining if an indexed set of permutations acting on a finite <b>message</b> <b>space</b> forms a group under functional composition. The first test is a "meet-in-the-middle " algorithm which uses O(v/K) time and space, where K {{is the size of}} the key space.

We provide practical instantiations of automor-phic signatures under appropriate assumptions {{and use them to}} construct the first efficient round-optimal blind signatures. By combining them with Groth-Sahai proofs, we moreover give practical instantiations of various other cryptographic primitives, such as fully-secure group signatures, non-interactive anonymous credentials and anonymous proxy signatures.

For small <b>message</b> <b>spaces,</b> our VRF’s proofs and keys have constant size.

40|$|Abstract. Proxy {{signatures}} {{allow an}} entity (the delegator) to delegate his signing capabilities to other entities (called proxies), who can then produce signatures {{on behalf of}} the delegator. Typically, a delegator may not want to give a proxy the power to sign any message on his behalf, but only messages from a well defined <b>message</b> <b>space.</b> Therefore, the so called delegation by warrant approach has been introduced. Here, a warrant is included into the delegator’s signature (the so called certificate) to describe the <b>message</b> <b>space</b> from which a proxy is allowed to choose messages to produce valid signatures for. Interestingly, in all previously known constructions of proxy signatures following this approach, the warrant is made explicit and, thus, is an input to the verification algorithm of a proxy signature. This means, that a verifier learns the entire <b>message</b> <b>space</b> for which the proxy has been given the signing power. However, it may be desirable to hide the remaining messages in the allowed <b>message</b> <b>space</b> from a verifier. This scenario has never been investigated in context of proxy signatures, but seems to be interesting for practical applications. In this paper, we resolve this issue by introducing so called warrant-hiding proxy signatures. We provide a formal security definition of such schemes by augmenting the well established security model for proxy signatures by Boldyreva et al. Furthermore, we discuss strategies how to realize this warrant-hiding property and we also provide two concrete instantiations of such a scheme. They enjoy different advantages, but are both entirely practical. Moreover, we prove them secure with respect to the augmented security model...|$|R
