500|$|Initially, {{scenes were}} filmed at the Seymour Demonstration Forest in North Vancouver. Although the typical {{shooting}} {{time for an}} episode of The X-Files is eight days, [...] "Detour" [...] took nineteen days to film. Second unit director Brett Dowler later recounted that it [...] "rained every day". This put a strain on {{the cast and crew}} because almost every <b>main</b> <b>shot</b> needed was intended to be outdoors in the daylight. Because of the massive delays, changes were made: the actors' schedules were rearranged and Kim Manners was brought in to assist Dowler in finishing the second unit of the episode. Filming later moved to a soundstage to avoid the incessant rain. Spotnitz later noted that [...] "I thought I'd come up with a very simple concept. Literally, one that was easy for the props people and all the other departments." ...|$|E
500|$|Visual {{effects for}} the film were {{provided}} by Industrial Light & Magic (ILM), Lola VFX, Double Negative, Luma Pictures, and Method Studios, with previsualization by The Third Floor. Double Negative handled the scenes featuring shrunken characters, incorporating the macro photography and motion capture performances shot in principal photography with digital models of the characters. Double Negative also worked on Ant-Man's shrinking effect, in coordination with ILM {{to be used by}} all vendors, which showed the outline of his body – an element from the comics. Visual effects supervisor Alex Wuttke said, [...] "It's like a little time echo. As Ant-Man shrinks in almost a stop motion way he would leave behind outlines of the poses he'd been in as he shrinks down... We'd have two CG cameras rendering the action from different points along the timeline with slightly different framings. One would be the <b>main</b> <b>shot</b> camera, the other would be a utility camera that would provide renders of static poses of Ant-Man at different points along the timeline." ...|$|E

By confirming device integrity, operational reliability, and environmental safety, LHD has been successfully started up with intensive discharge cleaning without doing high-temperature baking. Evacuation of about 100 molecular layers of surface contaminants is found to be the key to start up the target plasma by ECH for NBI injection. Importance of combination between mild baking, GDC, ECR-DC and <b>main</b> <b>shots</b> is experimentally confirmed. ...|$|R

5000|$|Fisher cites visual artists, such as Sol LeWitt and Andy Warhol, as influences. His {{most recent}} film, ( [...] ), {{consists}} {{of a series of}} inserts -- shots from an alternate angle, usually of details, actions, or objects that clarify the action of the <b>main</b> <b>shots</b> -- harvested from 16 mm commercial films and assembled according to a system influenced by LeWitt, allowing the order of the shots to be determined by this system. Fisher explains in the film's program notes: [...] "A rule, or a method, underlies ( [...] ), and I have obeyed it, even if the rule and my obedience to it are not visible." ...|$|R
50|$|The cricket match {{shown at}} the start of the episode was filmed at four {{different}} locations with the <b>main</b> sequences <b>shot</b> at Eltisley in Cambridgeshire, and stock footage at Meopham Green, Meopham, Kent on the A227 Gravesend to Tonbridge Road.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>main</b> <b>shots</b> played are the volley, {{forehand}} and the backhand all {{similar to}} the way one plays these in squash; because the game of squash rackets (now known as [...] "squash") began in the 19th century as an offshoot of rackets, the sports were similar in manner of play and rules. However, the rules and scoring in squash have evolved in the last hundred years or so. Rackets has changed little; the main difference today is that players are now allowed brief rest periods between games. In the past, leaving the court could mean forfeiting the match, so players kept spare rackets, shirts, and shoes in the gutter below the telltale on the front wall.|$|R
50|$|The player's {{firepower}} {{consists of}} a <b>main</b> <b>shot,</b> up to 4 Options called Gambits, {{and a number of}} bombs. Power-ups are available for the <b>main</b> <b>shot,</b> as well as extra Gambits and bombs, can be found throughout the game. There are 2 types of Gambits: a forward-firing laser type, and a rapid-firing vulcan type which moves and aims at enemies when firing. The player begins with 3 bombs, which can deploy near-instantly, negate most enemy fire, and do moderate damage in a large radius around the player's ship.|$|E
5000|$|A [...] "lazy shot" [...] is a shot {{which is}} {{suspended}} above the bottom. It may be {{tethered to the}} <b>main</b> <b>shot</b> line at a convenient depth. It is used for decompression and frees the <b>main</b> <b>shot</b> line for other divers. The lazy shot's line {{does not need to}} be longer than the decompression depth and is often only deep enough for the longer stops. It only needs a weight heavy enough to provide diver buoyancy control and sufficient buoyancy to avoid being dragged down under reasonably foreseeable circumstances.|$|E
50|$|In {{film and}} {{television}} production, B-roll, B roll, B-reel or B reel is supplemental or alternative footage intercut with the <b>main</b> <b>shot.</b> The term A-roll referring to the main footage has fallen out of usage.|$|E
50|$|Varvatos {{credits his}} early {{obsession}} with rock 'n' roll as {{the catalyst for}} his interest in fashion. The ad campaigns for the <b>main</b> collection, <b>shot</b> by Danny Clinch, have featured such musicians and bands such as Iggy Pop, Alice Cooper, Velvet Revolver, Chris Cornell, Dave Matthews, The Roots and Green Day.|$|R
50|$|The game {{contains}} five color-coded {{classes of}} power-up. The pink item powers up the main weapon, green powers {{up the side}} weapons, blue regenerates and/or improves the force shield, orange gives one extra Silver Hawk, and yellow destroys all enemies on-screen. At two points in the game, the player can find a red power-up with a special purpose. It switches the <b>main</b> weapon <b>shot</b> style between that seen in Darius and Darius II.|$|R

50|$|Pressing A fires the <b>main</b> <b>Shot</b> and, if the {{requisite}} powerups have been collected, the player's Options. Pressing B fires the Bomb, and pressing nothing powers up the Aura, a small energy {{field at the}} front of the player which causes damage.|$|E
5000|$|The player {{controls}} an insect-sized warrior named [...] "Kai", {{who takes}} on a vast army of cyborg insects to free the insect world from the dark ruler queen. The game uses two buttons: an upgrade-able <b>main</b> <b>shot</b> and a seemingly random selection of secondary weapons.|$|E
5000|$|The mitger (also called galotxer) is {{positioned}} {{in the middle}} of his teams' field and his <b>main</b> <b>shot</b> is on the air, when the ball hasn't bounced on the ground.

5000|$|... 1969: The {{final scene}} of Easy Rider, {{starring}} Peter Fonda and Dennis Hopper, was filmed {{a few miles}} north of there, in which the two <b>main</b> characters are <b>shot</b> by two local residents, David C. Billodeau and Johnny David, on Louisiana Highway 105.|$|R
5000|$|The Apostle is a 1997 American drama film {{written and}} {{directed}} by Robert Duvall, who stars in the title role. John Beasley, Farrah Fawcett, Billy Bob Thornton, June Carter Cash, Miranda Richardson and Billy Joe Shaver also appear. It was filmed on location in and around Saint Martinville and Des Allemands, Louisiana with some establishing shots done in the Dallas, Texas area by a second unit before principal photography began. And <b>main</b> opening <b>shots</b> filmed in Grand Coteau and Lafayette Louisiana.|$|R
5000|$|This suit is {{combined}} using White Blows, Blue Braiver and Yellow Crasher. White Blows forms the head, body and {{arms of the}} combined suit while the other two suits forms the legs. Its battle power can be evenly matched with the Dark Prince's [...] "Blizzard Abel", and fires with its Combined <b>Main</b> <b>Shot</b> [...] "Blaster Cannon".|$|E
5000|$|They go: Triple shot, {{which gives}} a {{secondary}} beam {{on either side}} of the <b>main</b> <b>shot</b> → mini ship, which flank the player ship in a [...] "V" [...] pattern (up to four per side) → main cannon upgrade, which increases the size of the <b>main</b> <b>shot</b> → Spread shot, which adds a bullet that fires outward from the center of the ship in a [...] "V" [...] shape → speed boost, which increases the player ship's movement speed on screen. → and a wildcard power up that can either max out all player ship shots, give the player a full complement of mini ships, destroy everything on screen, or add a shield to the front of the player ship that will stop bullets. All power ups [...] "stack" [...] to give an increased effect with multiple pick ups of the same power up. Increased size in the case of player bullet/beam power ups, more mini-ships, or faster move speed.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to the player's <b>main</b> <b>shot,</b> picking up green Option power-ups will add up to four support pods to the craft. The formation of these Options can be changed to one of five presets and there are additional secret formations that can be accessed by dropping {{a certain number of}} power-ups before picking up the next. Both shot and options are fired by holding the A button.|$|E
40|$|A {{challenging}} {{task that}} is required to modern injection systems {{is represented by the}} enhanced control of the injected quantities, especially when small injections are considered, such as, pilot and <b>main</b> <b>shots</b> in the context of multiple injections. The propagation of the pressure waves triggered by the nozzle opening and closure events through the high-pressure hydraulic circuit can influence and alter the performance of the injection apparatus. For this reason, an investigation of the injection system fluid dynamics in the frequency domain has been proposed. A complete lumped parameter model of the high-pressure hydraulic circuit has been applied to perform a modal analysis. The visualization of the main vibration modes of the apparatus allows a detailed and deep comprehension of the system dynamics. Furthermore, the possible resonances, which are induced by the action of the external forcing terms, have been identified. These forcing terms are the pump delivered flow-rate, the leakages through the injector pilot-valve, the injected flow-rate and the pressure control valve operation. On the basis of the developed methodology, it is possible to design injection systems with an optimized dynamic response. The sensitivity of the modes of vibration to a relevant geometrical parameter of the injection system has been analyzed and discussed in order to illustrate the practical application of the proposed approac...|$|R
50|$|The music video, {{set on a}} drag racing strip, was {{directed}} by Brycen Horne, and depicts lead singer Justin Burford strolling down the <b>main</b> strip, alternating <b>shots</b> of racing cars with shots of various attendees to the race, in addition to various shots of the band's instruments.|$|R
60|$|A {{short run}} down the road brought her to a horrified stand, for there before her was another wall of flame. An arm of the <b>main</b> {{conflagration}} had <b>shot</b> out a half mile south of its parent to embrace this tiny strip of road in its implacable clutches.|$|R
5000|$|The mitger is {{positioned}} {{in the middle}} of his teams' field and his <b>main</b> <b>shot</b> is on the air, when the ball hasn't bounced on the ground.

50|$|The Aleste {{initially}} {{starts out}} {{with nothing but}} the <b>main</b> <b>shot</b> and these sideships, and will return to this state whenever the player loses a life. To powerup the main weapon, the player must collect small power chips dropped from {{a certain type of}} friendly ship. As more chips are collected, the number of knives in a shot increases (up to four), and eventually the Aleste can start throwing stronger fireballs instead.|$|E
50|$|The main kunai {{shot and}} the three subweapons from Musha Aleste return, joined by new power levels for the <b>main</b> <b>shot</b> and a new subweapon. The sideship system has been {{completely}} redesigned: you now have two indestructible units with you at all times, which also fire your subweapons themselves. The ability to give the sideships commands has been replaced with a new subweapon that hits in many different directions. Additionally, the sideships can be launched at enemies.|$|E
5000|$|HMS Wakeful and HMS Troubridge {{were both}} {{used in the}} filming of the 1965 cold-war drama The Bedford Incident, to depict the fictional [...] "USS Bedford". The <b>main</b> {{exterior}} <b>shots</b> used a large model of a US Farragut-class destroyer, but Wakefuls Type 15 outline and F159 pennant number are clearly visible inthe opening sequence, when Sidney Poitier arrives in a Whirlwind helicopter. Many of the interior shots were filmed in Troubridge, and British military equipment, including a rack of Lee-Enfield rifles and Troubridges novel forward-sloping bridge windows, can be seen.|$|R
