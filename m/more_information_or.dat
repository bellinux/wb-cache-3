25|$|The main {{difference}} between opencaching and traditional listing sites {{is that all}} services {{are open to the}} users at no cost. Generally, most geocaching services or websites offer some basic information for free, but users may have to pay for premium membership that allows access to <b>more</b> <b>information</b> <b>or</b> advanced searching capabilities. This is not the case with opencaching; every geocache is listed and accessible to everyone for free.|$|E
25|$|If a {{compression}} {{scheme is}} lossless—that is, {{you can always}} recover the entire original message by decompressing—then a compressed message has the same quantity of information as the original, but communicated in fewer characters. That is, it has <b>more</b> <b>information,</b> <b>or</b> a higher entropy, per character. This means a compressed message has less redundancy. Roughly speaking, Shannon's source coding theorem says that a lossless compression scheme cannot compress messages, on average, {{to have more than}} one bit of information per bit of message, but that any value less than one bit of information per bit of message can be attained by employing a suitable coding scheme. The entropy of a message per bit multiplied by the length of that message is a measure of how much total information the message contains.|$|E
500|$|Final Fantasy II {{features}} gameplay {{similar to}} that of its predecessor, Final Fantasy. The player can freely roam an overworld containing several towns and dungeons. A menu-based system allows the player to outfit each character with equipment and up to two—often disposable—items for battle. Magic spells are assigned to the character from the item menu, and certain spells, such as [...] "Cure", can be used outside of battle. The player can also save their progress on the overworld. Weapons, armor, items, and magic spells can be purchased at shops, and townspeople provide useful information for the player's progression through the game. One new feature is the [...] "Word Memory" [...] system: when in conversation with non-player characters (NPCs), the player can [...] "ask" [...] about and [...] "memorize" [...] special keywords or phrases, which can later be repeated to other NPCs to gain <b>more</b> <b>information</b> <b>or</b> unlock new actions. Similarly, there exist a handful of special items that can be shown to NPCs during conversation or used on certain objects, which have the same effect. Characters and monsters are no longer separated into separate windows in the battle screen {{as they were in the}} first Final Fantasy, and players can see their current and total hit points below the battle. Players can also fight with less than four characters in their party, which was not possible in the first game. Final Fantasy II introduced the chocobo, the signature Final Fantasy mascot, which lets characters ride to a location at great speed without being attacked by enemies. The recurring character Cid was also introduced in II; a character of the same name has appeared in every main-series game since.|$|E
