5|$|A {{complication}} seen in untreated Addison's {{disease and}} other types of primary adrenal insufficiency is the adrenal crisis, a <b>medical</b> <b>emergency</b> in which low glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid levels result in hypovolemic shock and symptoms such as vomiting and fever. An adrenal crisis can progressively lead to stupor and coma. The management of adrenal crises includes the application of hydrocortisone injections.|$|E
40|$|Introduction: In-flight <b>medical</b> <b>emergencies</b> on {{commercial}} aircraft {{are common in}} both domestic and international flights. We hypothesized that fourth-year medical students feel inadequately prepared to lend assistance during in-flight <b>medical</b> <b>emergencies.</b> This multicenter study of two U.

5|$|Another risk is {{autonomic}} dysreflexia (AD), a <b>medical</b> <b>emergency</b> involving dangerously high blood pressure. People {{at risk for}} AD can take medications to help prevent it before sex, {{but if it does}} occur they must stop and seek treatment. Mild signs of AD such as slightly high blood pressure frequently do accompany sexual arousal and are not cause for alarm. In fact, some interpret the symptoms of AD that occur during sexual activity as pleasant or arousing, or even climactic.|$|E
5|$|Bound for Glory was {{scheduled}} to feature nine professional wrestling matches and one pre-show match, however, due to a <b>medical</b> <b>emergency</b> TNA was forced to change the main event of the show, resulting in ten overall matches. Each of these matches involved wrestlers from pre-existing scripted feuds and storylines portraying villains, heroes, or less distinguishable characters; these scripted events built tension and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches.|$|E
5|$|Cholangitis can be life-threatening, and is {{regarded}} as a <b>medical</b> <b>emergency.</b> Characteristic symptoms include yellow discoloration of the skin or whites of the eyes, fever, abdominal pain, and in severe cases, low blood pressure and confusion. Initial treatment is with intravenous fluids and antibiotics, but there is often an underlying problem (such as gallstones or narrowing in the bile duct) for which further tests and treatments may be necessary, usually in the form of endoscopy to relieve obstruction of the bile duct. The word is from Greek chol-, bile + ang-, vessel + -itis, inflammation.|$|E

5|$|During the luncheon, Senator Ted Kennedy {{collapsed}} {{after suffering}} a seizure, and he was transported to a hospital for medical treatment. Early reports about the <b>medical</b> <b>emergency</b> suggested erroneously that Senator Robert Byrd, the oldest member of the Senate, also fell ill during the luncheon.

5|$|Lead {{encephalopathy}} is a <b>medical</b> <b>emergency</b> {{and causes}} permanent brain damage in 70–80% of children affected by it, {{even those that}} receive the best treatment. The mortality rate for people who develop cerebral involvement is about 25%, and of those who survive who had lead encephalopathy symptoms by the time chelation therapy was begun, about 40% have permanent neurological problems such as cerebral palsy.|$|E
5|$|Prolonged convulsive epileptic {{seizures}} are a <b>medical</b> <b>emergency</b> {{that can}} usually be dealt with effectively by administering fast-acting benzodiazepines, which are potent anticonvulsants. In a hospital environment, intravenous clonazepam, lorazepam, and diazepam are first-line choices, clonazepam due to its stronger and more potent anticonvulsant action, diazepam due to its faster onset and lorazepam for its longer duration of action. In the community, intravenous administration is not practical and so rectal diazepam or (more recently) buccal midazolam are used, with a preference for midazolam as its administration is easier and more socially acceptable.|$|E

50|$|<b>Emergency</b> <b>medical</b> {{responders}} {{are people}} who are specially trained to provide out-of-hospital care in <b>medical</b> <b>emergencies.</b> There are many different types of <b>emergency</b> <b>medical</b> responders, each with different levels of training, ranging from first aid and basic life support. <b>Emergency</b> <b>medical</b> responders have a very limited scope of practice and have the least amount of comprehensive education, clinical experience or clinical skills of EMS personnel. The EMR is not meant to replace the roles of <b>emergency</b> <b>medical</b> technicians, <b>emergency</b> <b>medical</b> technologists or paramedics and their wide range of specialties. <b>Emergency</b> <b>medical</b> responders typically assist in rural regions providing basic life support where pre-hospital health professionals are not available due to limited resources or infrastructure.|$|R
40|$|The Flying Squad of the Accident and Emergency Department, of the Derbyshire Royal Infirmary, was {{established}} in 1955 by Collins. The initial function was to provide emergency care to victims of industrial accidents. However, the spectrum of emergencies they now respond to has expanded and includes predominantly road traffic accidents and <b>medical</b> <b>emergencies.</b> Despite the proliferation of Flying Squads their benefit {{has been difficult to}} quantify even in a trauma setting (Robertson & Steedman, 1985; Gorman & Coals, 1983). The outcome in <b>medical</b> <b>emergencies</b> is reported as dismal (Robertson & Steedman, 1985; Rowley & Collins, 1979) yet the number of calls for the flying squad to attend <b>medical</b> <b>emergencies</b> are many. Previous reports have recorded 20 - 30 % of Squad calls responding to <b>medical</b> <b>emergencies</b> (Gorman & Coals, 1983; Rowley & Collins, 1979; Steedman & Robertson, 1986; Harrop & Bodiwala, 1983) ...|$|R
5|$|The {{symptoms}} of pneumothorax can be vague and inconclusive, especially {{in those with}} a small PSP; confirmation with medical imaging is usually required. In contrast, tension pneumothorax is a <b>medical</b> <b>emergency</b> and may be treated before imaging – especially if there is severe hypoxia, very low blood pressure, or an impaired level of consciousness. In tension pneumothorax, X-rays are sometimes required if there is doubt about the anatomical location of the pneumothorax.|$|E

Sub-Commander T'Pol reveals that the Vulcans are unaware of the species, but she agrees with Captain Archer to help them.

On August 2, 2015, during a concert in Hartford, Connecticut, {{the band was}} forced to stop performing after Venturella was suddenly rushed to hospital, after undergoing a <b>medical</b> <b>emergency.</b> After 20 minutes, singer Taylor told the audience the band would continue the concert, performing without Venturella. It was later discovered that Venturella had collapsed because of extreme dehydration. During the band's following three concerts, Venturella played bass from backstage, returning to the stage on August 8.|$|E
5|$|Owing to {{the close}} {{similarity}} between play and hunting, cats prefer {{to play with}} objects that resemble prey, such as small furry toys that move rapidly, but rapidly lose interest (they become habituated) in a toy they have played with before. Cats also tend to play with toys more when they are hungry. String is often used as a toy, {{but if it is}} eaten, it can become caught {{at the base of the}} cat's tongue and then move into the intestines, a <b>medical</b> <b>emergency</b> which can cause serious illness, even death. Owing to the risks posed by cats eating string, it is sometimes replaced with a laser pointer's dot, which cats may chase.|$|E
5|$|A {{midazolam}} overdose {{is considered}} a <b>medical</b> <b>emergency</b> and generally requires the immediate attention of medical personnel. Benzodiazepine overdose in healthy individuals is rarely life-threatening with proper medical support; however, the toxicity of benzodiazepines increases when they are combined with other CNS depressants such as alcohol, opioids, or tricyclic antidepressants. The toxicity of benzodiazepine overdose and risk of death is also increased in the elderly and those with obstructive pulmonary disease or when used intravenously. Treatment is supportive; activated charcoal can be used {{within an hour of}} the overdose. The antidote for an overdose of midazolam (or any other benzodiazepine) is flumazenil. While effective in reversing the effects of benzodiazepines it is not used in most cases as it may trigger seizures in mixed overdoses and benzodiazepine dependent individuals.|$|E

Raven did not receive a rematch for the title. Instead, Jarrett was scheduled to defend the championship against a returning Kevin Nash at Bound for Glory. Nash could not attend the event due to a legitimate <b>medical</b> <b>emergency,</b> with TNA holding a Ten-Man Gauntlet match to find his replacement at the show. Rhino won the match and took Nash's place in the main event. There, Rhino defeated Jarrett to win the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. Rhino also competed in a Four Way Monster's Ball match at Bound for Glory against Abyss, Jeff Hardy, and Sabu. Rhino was the victor in this encounter as well.|$|E
5|$|If {{a seizure}} lasts longer than 5minutes {{or if there}} are more than two {{seizures}} in an hour without a return to a normal level of consciousness between them, it is considered a <b>medical</b> <b>emergency</b> known as status epilepticus. This may require medical help to keep the airway open and protected; a nasopharyngeal airway may be useful for this. At home the recommended initial medication for seizure of a long duration is midazolam placed in the mouth. Diazepam may also be used rectally. In hospital, intravenous lorazepam is preferred. If two doses of benzodiazepines are not effective, other medications such as phenytoin are recommended. Convulsive status epilepticus that does not respond to initial treatment typically requires admission to the intensive care unit and treatment with stronger agents such as thiopentone or propofol.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} {{findings}} {{in people with}} tension pneumothorax are chest pain and respiratory distress, often with an increased heart rate (tachycardia) and rapid breathing (tachypnea) in the initial stages. Other findings may include quieter breath sounds {{on one side of}} the chest, low oxygen levels and blood pressure, and displacement of the trachea away from the affected side. Rarely, there may be cyanosis (bluish discoloration of the skin due to low oxygen levels), altered level of consciousness, a hyperresonant percussion note on examination of the affected side with reduced expansion and decreased movement, pain in the epigastrium (upper abdomen), displacement of the apex beat (heart impulse), and resonant sound when tapping the sternum. This is a <b>medical</b> <b>emergency</b> and may require immediate treatment without further investigations (see below).|$|E
