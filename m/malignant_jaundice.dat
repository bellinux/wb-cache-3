40|$|BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIMS: Various {{types of}} self-expandable metal stents have been {{introduced}} for biliary drainage in patients with <b>malignant</b> <b>jaundice,</b> showing prolonged patency compared with plastic endoprostheses. However, there has only been prolonged experience with a meaningful number of patients using the Wallstent. We evaluated the Diamond stent, a self-expanding uncoated biliary metal stent, in a prospective uncontrolled multicenter setting. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The eligibility criterion was obstructive jaundice due to inoperable malignant disease. Between August 1995 and January 2000, 126 patients, who received a total of 134 Diamond stents in four European centers, were followed prospectively. RESULTS: Technical and clinical success rates were 96 % and 98 %, respectively. No major procedure-related complications occurred. The 30 -day mortality rate was 13 %. Stent occlusion occurred in 28 patients (22 %). Overall median stent patency was 477 days; overall median survival was 173 days. Stent occlusion, confirmed by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, was successfully treated with plastic stents in all patients. Cost analysis revealed estimated costs of 3440 euros per patient for palliative treatment with the Diamond stent. CONCLUSIONS: The Diamond stent compares favorably with other biliary metal stents for patients requiring biliary drainage of <b>malignant</b> <b>jaundice.</b> Clinical TrialComparative StudyJournal ArticleMulticenter StudyResearch Support, Non-U.

40|$|To compare {{clinical}} {{effectiveness of}} Viabil-covered stents versus uncovered metallic Wallstents, for palliation of <b>malignant</b> <b>jaundice</b> due to extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, 60 patients {{were enrolled in}} a prospective and randomized study. In half of the patients a bare Wallstent was used, {{and in the other}} half a Viabil biliary stent. Patients were followed up until death. Primary patency, survival, complication rates, and mean cost were calculated in both groups. Stent dysfunction occurred in 9 (30 %) patients in the bare stent group after a mean period of 133. 1 days and in 4 (13. 3 %) patients in the covered stent group after a mean of 179. 5 days. The incidence of stent dysfunction was significantly lower in the covered stent group (P = 0. 046). Tumor ingrowth occurred exclusively in the bare stent group (P = 0. 007). Median survival was 180. 5 days for the Wallstent and 243. 5 days for the Viabil group (P = 0. 039). Complications and mean cost were similar in the two groups.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: This {{endoscopic}} retrograde cholangiopancreatography-(ERCP) based study {{estimates the}} potential role of laparoscopic cholecystojejunostomy for palliation {{of patients with}} <b>malignant</b> obstructive <b>jaundice.</b> SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Traditional treatment of <b>malignant</b> obstructive <b>jaundice</b> has used a standard bilioenteric anastomosis. Laparoscopic biliary bypass via a gallbladder conduit currently is an established technique; it provides a low initial morbidity alternative to open procedures, similar to endoscopic stenting. No study has specifically addressed anatomic factors relevant to cholecystojejunostomy, such as prior cholecystectomy, stricture location {{in reference to the}} hepatocystic junction, and cystic duct patency in patients with <b>malignant</b> obstructive <b>jaundice.</b> METHODS: Retrograde cholangiograms were reviewed from consecutive patients with <b>malignant</b> obstructive <b>jaundice</b> and a control group without biliary disease who underwent ERCP during a 2 -year period. Patients with either prior biliary surgery or hilar tumors were excluded. The presence of gallbladder or cystic duct filling was assessed. In patients with patent cystic ducts, the distance from obstruction to the cystic duct takeoff was classified as either greater or less than 1 cm. RESULTS: Nearly half the patients with <b>malignant</b> obstructive <b>jaundice</b> were ineligible for cholecystojejunostomies because of prior biliary surgery (29 %) or hilar tumors (17 %). Half (50 of 101) of the remaining potential candidates had patent hepatocystic junctions. Patients with ampullary carcinoma and patent hepatocystic junctions (5 of 9) were all ideal candidates for cholecystojejunostomies, having biliary obstruction more than 1 cm from the cystic duct takeoff. Two thirds of the remaining eligible patients (28 of 45) had obstructions less than 1 cm from patent hepatocystic junctions. CONCLUSIONS: Palliation of <b>malignant</b> obstructive <b>jaundice</b> by laparoscopic cholecystojejunostomy should only be attempted after direct cholangiography demonstrates a patent hepatocystic junction that is well separated from the malignant stricture. The majority of patients with <b>malignant</b> obstructive <b>jaundice</b> are ineligible for cholecystojejunostomies because of prior cholecystectomies, hilar obstructions, or tumor involvement of the hepatocystic junction.

40|$|Objective: To {{study the}} {{clinical}} effect and prognosis of percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage (PTBD) treatment {{of patients with}} <b>malignant</b> obstructive <b>jaundice.</b> Methods: A total of 112 patients with <b>malignant</b> obstructive <b>jaundice</b> treated in our hospital from April 2009 to February 2014 were retrospectively analyzed. All patients were randomly divided into control group (42 cases) and observation group (70 cases), control group received drainage of laparotomy and observation group received PTBD intervention. All patients were followed up for 3 to 23 months. Clinical effect, complication and length of stay were observed and counted after two groups received different treatment, {{and the results were}} compared and analyzed. Results: After two groups received different treatment, serum AIL, AST, TBIL and DBIL levels significantly decreased than before treatment, but serum AIL, AST, TBIL and DBIL levels of observation group were lower than those of control group. The levels of WBC and NE of both groups were lower than before treatment, but differences in WBC, NE and PT between the two groups were without statistical significance after treatment. Meanwhile, the incidence of adverse reaction and length of stay of observation group were lower than those of control group, and the differences were statistically significant. Conclusion: Interventional treatment of <b>malignant</b> obstructive <b>jaundice</b> can effectively improve the clinical symptoms, lower incidence of adverse reactions and shorten the length of stay, which is the preferred method for medically inoperable <b>malignant</b> obstructive <b>jaundice</b> and worth clinical popularization...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare the {{clinical}} effectiveness of expanded polytetrafluoroethylene/fluorinated-ethylene-propylene (ePTFE/FEP) -covered stents with that of uncovered nitinol stents for the palliation of <b>malignant</b> <b>jaundice</b> caused by inoperable pancreatic head cancer. Eighty patients were enrolled in a prospective randomized study. Bare nitinol stents were used in half of the patients, and ePTFE/FEP-covered stents were used in the remaining patients. Patency, survival, complications, and mean cost were calculated in both groups. Mean patency was 166. 0 ± 13. 11 days for the bare-stent group and 234. 0 ± 20. 87 days for the covered-stent group (p = 0. 007). Primary patency rates at 3, 6, and 12 months were 77. 5, 69. 8, and 69. 8 % for the bare-stent group and 97. 5, 92. 2, and 87. 6 % for the covered-stent group, respectively. Mean secondary patency was 123. 7 ± 22. 5 days for the bare-stent group and 130. 3 ± 21. 4 days for the covered-stent group. Tumour ingrowth occurred exclusively in the bare-stent group in 27. 5 % of cases (p = 0. 002). Median survival was 203. 2 ± 11. 8 days for the bare-stent group and 247. 0 ± 20 days for the covered-stent group (p = 0. 06). Complications and mean cost were similar in both groups. Regarding primary patency and ingrowth rate, ePTFE/FEP-covered stents have shown to be significantly superior to bare nitinol stents for the palliation of <b>malignant</b> <b>jaundice</b> caused by inoperable pancreatic head cancer and pose comparable cost and complications. Use of a covered stent does not significantly influence overall survival rate; nevertheless, the covered endoprosthesis seems to offer result in fewer reinterventions and better quality of patient life...|$|E
40|$|Patients with obstructive {{jaundice}} {{have an increased}} incidence of peri-operative complications and immune dysfunction. This {{study was to investigate}} interleukin (IL) - 12 (a cellular immunity stimulant), levels in jaundiced patients. 23 jaundiced patients and 17 controls were studied.

40|$|Endoscopic {{insertion}} of a self-expanding metal stent (SEMS) through a malignant {{common bile duct}} stricture is {{the first line of}} palliation for <b>malignant</b> <b>jaundice.</b> Patency of these stents remains a major concern. SEMS dysfunction can result from tumor ingrowth, overgrowth and/or clogging. Initial SEMS modifications involved covering {{the central part of the}} stent in order to reduce ingrowth and ultimately increase patency. Fully covered stents became available shortly after reports of their use in human patients. The potential removability and radial strength of SEMS have led to evaluation of their use in new indications including benign biliary strictures, post sphincterotomy bleeding and perforation. Other aspects of development include the addition of features such as anti-reflux valves, drug elution and spontaneous biodegradability.

Patients and methods: Sixty eight patients with <b>malignant</b> obstructive <b>jaundice</b> secondary to pancreatobiliary or metastatic disease not amenable to surgery were retrospectively included. Two groups were created: group A (covered self-expandable metallic stents) (n = 22) and group B (uncovered self-expandable metallic stents) (n = 46).

40|$|Traditionally, {{pre-operative}} biliary drainage (PBD) {{was believed}} to improve multi-organ dysfunction, and for this reason, was practiced worldwide. Over the last decade, this concept was challenged by many reports, including meta-analyses that showed no difference in morbidity and mortality between surgery with, and surgery without PBD, in operable <b>malignant</b> <b>jaundice.</b> The main disadvantages of PBD are seen to be the additional cost of the procedure itself, {{and the need for}} longer hospitalization. In addition, many studies showed the significance of specific complications resulting from PBD, such as recurrent jaundice, cholangitis, pancreatitis, cutaneous fistula, and bleeding. However, the results of these studies remain inconclusive as to date there has been no perfect study that equally randomized comparable patients according to the level of obstruction and technique used for PBD. Generally, endoscopic stent insertion (ES) is preferred for common duct obstruction, whereas endoscopic nasobiliary drainage and percutaneous biliary drainage is reserved for hilar obstruction, since ES in hilar block confers a high rate of cholangitis. Although, there is no guideline which either supports or refutes this approach, certain subgroups of patients, including those with symptomatic jaundice, cholangitis, impending renal failure, hilar block requiring preoperative portal vein embolization, and those who need pre-operative neoadjuvant therapy, are suitable candidates for PBD...|$|E
40|$|The {{endoscopic}} {{insertion of}} an endoprosthesis {{is now a}} standard procedure in the ultimate palliation of malignant obstructing upper gastrointestinal and biliary malignancy. The commercially available prostheses and introducing devices are adequate {{for the majority of}} upper intestinal cancers. For some stricturing lesions, especially when associated with fistula formation, individual adaptation of a tygon prosthesis with extra widening rings is often necessary. Nd: Yag laser vaporisation of mainly exophytic cancerous tissue is mainly indicated for those circumstances which are less amenable to prosthesis insertion such as total luminal obstruction, noncircumferential tumorous involvement, polypoid cancers, excessively necrotic and chronically bleeding tumors, lesions extending within 2 cm of the upper esophageal sphincter, markedly angulated cancers of the cardia with almost horizontal tube positioning and cancerous overgrowth occluding the funnel opening. Overall successful insertion occurs in over 90 % of patients. Main complications are perforation 5 - 8 % and early or late dislocation. The procedure related mortality fluctuates around 2 to 4 %. Overall results with laser application are roughly comparable. The dysphagia free intervall after laser is only around 6 weeks {{for the majority of the}} patients. Transpapillary insertion of a straight Amsterdam-type prosthesis rapidly became a standard procedure for palliation of <b>malignant</b> <b>jaundice.</b> For many patients with pancreatic cancer this endoscopic approach competes favorably with corresponding surgical palliative alternatives. Disappearance of jaundice is to be expected in the vast majority of the patients.

40|$|AIM: To find a {{possible}} relationship between inflammation and CA 19 - 9 tumor marker by analyzing data from patients with benign jaundice (BJ) and <b>malignant</b> <b>jaundice</b> (MJ). METHODS: All patients admitted for obstructive jaundice, {{in the period}} 2005 - 2009, were prospectively enrolled in the study, obtaining a total of 102 patients. On admission, all patients underwent complete standard blood test examinations including C-reactive protein (CRP), bilirubin, CA 19 - 9. Patients were considered eligible for the study when they presented obstructive jaundice confirmed by instrumental examinations and increased serum bilirubin levels (total bilirubin > 2. 0 mg/dL). The standard cut-off level for CA 19 - 9 was 32 U/mL, whereas for CRP this was 1. 5 mg/L. The CA 19 - 9 level was adjusted by dividing it by the value of serum bilirubin or by the CRP value. The patients were divided into 2 groups, MJ and BJ, and after the adjustment a comparison between the 2 groups of patients was performed. Sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive values were calculated {{before and after the}} adjustment. RESULTS: Of the 102 patients, 51 were affected by BJ and 51 by MJ. Pathologic CA 19 - 9 levels were found in 71. 7 % of the patients. In the group of 51 BJ patients there were 29 (56. 9 %) males and 22 (43. 1 %) females with a median age of 66 years (range 24 - 96 years), whereas in the MJ group there were 24 (47 %) males and 27 (53 %) females, {{with a mean age of}} 70 years (range 30 - 92 years). Pathologic CA 19 - 9 serum level was found in 82. 3 % of MJ. CRP levels were pathologic in 66. 6 % of the patients with BJ and in 49 % with MJ. Bilirubin and CA 19 - 9 average levels were significantly higher in MJ compared with BJ (P = 0. 000 and P = 0. 02), while the CRP level was significantly higher in BJ (P = 0. 000). Considering a CA 19 - 9 cut-off level of 32 U/mL, 82. 3 % in the MJ group and 54. 9 % in the BJ group were positive for CA 19 - 9 (P = 0. 002). A CA 19 - 9 cut-off of 100 U/mL increases the difference between the two groups: 35. 3 % in BJ and 68. 6 % in MJ (P = 0. 0007). Adjusting the CA 19 - 9 value by dividing it by serum bilirubin level meant that 21. 5 % in the BJ and 49 % in the MJ group remained with a positive CA 19 - 9 value (P = 0. 003), while adjusting the CA 19 - 9 value by dividing it by serum CRP value meant that 31. 4 % in the BJ group and 76. 5 % in the MJ group still had a positive CA 19 - 9 value (P = 0. 000004). Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive values of CA 19 - 9 > 32 U/mL were 82. 3 %, 45 % and 59. 1 %; when the cut-off was CA 19 - 9 > 100 U/mL they were, respectively, 68. 6 %, 64. 7 % and 66 %. When the CA 19 - 9 value was adjusted by dividing it by the bilirubin or CRP values, these became 49 %, 78. 4 %, 69. 4 % and 76. 5 %, 68. 6 %, 70. 9 %, respectively.

40|$|AIM: To {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} preoperative biliary drainage (PBD) on obstructive <b>jaundice</b> resulting from <b>malignant</b> tumors. METHODS: According {{to the requirements of}} Cochrane systematic review, studies in the English language were retrieved from MEDLINE and Embase databases from 1995 to 2009 with the key word “preoperative biliary drainage”. Two reviewers independently screened the eligible studies, evaluated their academic level and extracted the data from the eligible studies confirmed by cross-checking. Data about patients with and without PBD after resection of malignant tumors were processed for meta-analysis using the Stata 9. 2 software, including postoperative mortality, incidence of postoperative pancreatic and bile leakage, abdominal abscess, delayed gastric emptying and incision infection. RESULTS: Fourteen retrospective cohort studies involving 1826 patients with <b>malignant</b> obstructive <b>jaundice</b> accorded with our inclusion criteria, and were included in meta-analysis. Their baseline characteristics were comparable in all the studies. No significant difference was found in combined risk ratio (RR) of postoperative mortality and incidence of pancreatic and bile leakage, abdominal abscess, delayed gastric emptying between patients with and without PBD. However, the combined RR for the incidence of postoperative incision infection was improved better in patients with PBD than in those without PBD (P < 0. 05).

40|$|ObjectiveTo {{investigate}} the clinical effect of different nutritional therapies on the immune function {{of patients with}} <b>malignant</b> obstructive <b>jaundice</b> after percutaneous transhepatic cholangiodrainage (PTCD). MethodsA total of 50 patients with <b>malignant</b> obstructive <b>jaundice</b> who were admitted to our hospital from January 2009 to March 2013 were randomly {{divided into two groups}} according to the admission order. The patients in group A (n= 25) received enteral nutritional support after PTCD, and those in group B (n= 25) received total parenteral nutritional support after PTCD. Intra-group and inter-group comparisons were made in terms of jaundice clearance, nutritional indices, and body’s immune function on preoperative day 1 and postoperative day 7; comparison between the two groups was made by t test. ResultsAmong the 50 patients who underwent PTCD, 39 (78 %) had good drainage, while 11 (22 %) did not reach the expectation, of which, 5 (10 %) were in group A and 6 (12 %) in group B. In both groups, the nutritional indices on postoperative day 7 were significantly higher than those on preoperative day 1 (P＜ 0. 05), but no significant difference in these indices was observed between group A and group B on postoperative day 7 (P＞ 0. 05). The immune function of patients in both groups was significantly improved following PTCD and nutritional support (P＜ 0. 05), but {{there was no significant difference}} between the two groups (P＞ 0. 05). Although the same scheme of nutritional support was used, there were 11 patients who did not achieve the expected jaundice clearance after PTCD and had limited improvement in immune function compared with those who had complete jaundice clearance (all P＜ 0. 05).

40|$|Background: Immunoglobulin A is the {{predominant}} immunoglobulin in the bile. Data {{on the effects}} of biliary obstruction on IgA secretion are few. Methods: The serum and bile IgA levels in patients with common duct stones (n = 27) or with <b>malignant</b> obstructive <b>jaundice</b> (n = 20) were collected by insertion of nasobiliary catheters. Single samples of common duct bile from patients with gallstones (n = 24) were collected as controls. Bile samples collected were measured for total IgA, secretory IgA, and free secretory component levels by sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Results: Bile total IgA, secretory IgA, and free secretory component in the common duct stones group (82. 7 ± 11. 4 μg/ml, 18. 4 ± 1. 7 μg/ml, 0. 74 ± 0. 15 μg/ml) and the <b>malignant</b> obstructive <b>jaundice</b> group (81. 6 ± 10. 7 μg/ml, 18. 2 ± 2. 4 μg/ml, 0. 57 ± 0. 12 μg/ml) were found to be significantly lower than those of the control gallstone patients (104. 8 ± 3. 4 μg/ml, 33. 2 ± 2. 9 μg/ml, 1. 03 ± 0. 12 μg/ml) (P < 0. 05). Serum secretory IgA levels in the common duct stones (26. 53 ± 1. 75 μg/ml) and <b>malignant</b> obstructive <b>jaundice</b> groups (26. 03 ± 3. 48 μg/ml) were significantly higher than the gallstone group (18. 45 ± 4. 56 μg/ml). The bile-to-serum concentration ratio of total IgA, secretory IgA, and free secretory component levels rose significantly within 48 hours after relief of obstruction. Conclusions: Biliary obstruction secondary to both calculus or malignancy of the hepatobiliary system causes suppression of bile IgA secretion and elevated serum level of secretory IgA.

The average hospitalization cost was (28359 ± 4523) yuan. ConclusionLCD treatment of advanced <b>malignant</b> obstructive <b>jaundice</b> can quickly reduce the level of bilirubin with relatively low-risk of complications. The shorter durations of hospitalization and rehabilitation associated with this procedure make LCD a low-cost, as well as effective, clinical treatment...|$|R

40|$|When {{advanced}} biliary or pancreatic malignancies preclude {{application of}} surgery or stent placement for relief of jaundice, the remaining option is percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage (PTBD). However, it {{is associated with}} problems such as loss of biliary fluid and minerals, malabsorption of fat, and discomfort. A new surgical method for palliative biliary drainage in <b>malignant</b> obstructive <b>jaundice</b> consists of connection of PTBD catheter to a jejunostomy catheter. With this configuration, external drainage converts to internal drainage type. This is a safe method with minimal morbidities and several advantages. It will improve the patient's quality of life, minimize loss of fluid and electrolytes and permit normal enterohepatic circulation...|$|R
40|$|AbstractPreoperative biliary {{drainage}} (PBD) {{has been}} a matter of controversy for years. It was initially aimed to improve the clinical status of patients with <b>malignant</b> obstructive <b>jaundice</b> prior to surgery. However, its efficacy and safety have not been proven by randomized controlled trials. Most drawbacks of PBD are related to the increase in procedure-related adverse events and inappropriate biliary decompression. Current trends in PBD show that using self-expanding metallic stents (SEMSs) may reduce the high incidence of stent-related complications with improved outcomes. The aim {{of this study was to}} review the current literature regarding PBD in patients with resectable distal pancreaticobiliary and hilar tumors...|$|R
40|$|ObjectiveTo {{investigate}} {{the safety and}} feasibility of percutaneous intraductal radiofrequency ablation (palliative therapy) {{in the treatment of}} <b>malignant</b> obstructive <b>jaundice.</b> MethodsThis study included 20 patients with unresectable <b>malignant</b> obstructive <b>jaundice,</b> who were treated in the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University from January 2013 to March 2014. Nine of them (test group) underwent percutaneous intraductal radiofrequency ablation plus metallic biliary stent placement. The other 11 similar cases (control group) underwent metallic biliary stent placement alone after successful percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography. Operative complications and remission of jaundice were observed, and the stent patency after at 3 and 6 months after operation was evaluated and compared between the two groups. ResultsAll patients were followed completely by outpatient or telephone. The stent patency rate at 3 months after operation was 9 / 9 in the test group and 8 / 11 in the control group (χ 2 = 2. 888, P= 0. 218), and the stent patency rates at 6 months were 7 / 8 and 3 / 11, respectively (χ 2 = 6. 739, P= 0. 02). During follow-up, one case in the test group died of gastrointestinal bleeding at 113 d after operation; one case in the control group died of liver failure at 57 d after operation and one case died of disseminated intravascular coagulation at 142 d. ConclusionPercutaneous intraductal radiofrequency ablation is safe and feasible in the treatment of malignant biliary obstruction, and the preliminary efficacy in prolonging the patency of self-expanding metallic stent is satisfactory. However, this therapy needs to be further verified via large-sample randomized controlled studies...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Obstructive {{jaundice}} poses {{diagnostic and}} therapeutic challenges to general surgeons practicing in resource-limited countries. This study was undertaken {{to highlight the}} etiological spectrum, treatment outcome of obstructive jaundice in our setting and to identify prognostic factors for morbidity and mortality. Methods This was a descriptive prospective study which was conducted at Bugando Medical Centre between July 2006 and June 2010. All patients with a clinical diagnosis of obstructive jaundice were, after informed consent for the study, consecutively enrolled into the study. Data were collected using a pre-tested structured questionnaire and analyzed using SPSS computer software version 11. 5. Results A total of 116 patients were studied. Females outnumbered males by a ratio of 1. 3 : 1. Patients with <b>malignant</b> obstructive <b>jaundice</b> were older than those of benign type. Ca head of pancreas was the commonest <b>malignant</b> cause of <b>jaundice</b> where as choledocholithiasis was the commonest benign cause. Abdominal ultrasound was the only diagnostic imaging done in all patients and revealed dilated intra and extra-hepatic ducts, common bile stones and abdominal masses in 56. 2 %, 78. 9 %, 58. 1 % and 72. 4 % of the cases respectively. A total of 110 (94. 8 %) patients underwent surgical treatment and the remaining 6 (5. 2 %) patients were unfit for surgery. The complication rate was 22. 4 % mainly surgical site infections. The mean hospital stay and mortality rate were 14. 54 days and 15. 5 % respectively. A low haematocrit and presence of postoperative sepsis were the main predictors of the hospital stay (P 60 years, prolonged duration of <b>jaundice,</b> <b>malignant</b> causes and presence of postoperative complications mainly sepsis significantly predicted mortality (P Conclusion Obstructive jaundice in our setting is more prevalent in females and the cause is mostly malignant.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{chemical}} composition and clinical significance of white bile {{in patients with}} <b>malignant</b> obstructive <b>jaundice</b> were evaluated in a prospective study. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 115 consecutive patients with inoperable malignant biliary obstruction underwent endoscopic placement of 10 Fr straight, plastic biliary stents, Amsterdam-type. Bile was aspirated during the endoscopic procedure and a blood sample was taken. Patients {{were divided into two}} groups: those with white bile and those with yellow bile. The groups were compared for decremental fall in bilirubin, cholangitis after stent insertion, and survival. RESULTS: Thirty-five patients (15 men, 20 women; mean age 54 years) underwent endoscopic drainage for malignant obstruction (29 hilar, 6 distal bile duct). Eighteen patients had white bile. Refractory jaundice (p > - 0. 025) was seen in nine (50...|$|R
40|$|Endoscopic {{retrograde}} cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) {{is one of}} {{the most}} technically demanding and highest-risk procedures performed by gastrointestinal endoscopists. Hence, it requires significant focused training and experience to maximize success and safety (1, 2). ERCP has evolved from a purely diagnostic to a predominately therapeutic pro-cedure (3). ERCP and ancillary interventions are effective in the nonsurgical management of a variety of pancreaticobil-iary disorders, most commonly removal of bile duct stones and relief of <b>malignant</b> obstructive <b>jaundice</b> (4). The Ameri-can Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ASGE) has pub-lished specific criteria for the training and granting of clinical privileges for ERCP (5, 6) The ASGE/American College of Gastroenterology task force has established the following in-dicators to aid in the recognition of ERCP examinations o...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe role of {{preoperative}} biliary drainage in <b>malignant</b> obstructive <b>jaundice</b> {{has been}} controversial. Laboratory {{studies suggest that}} relief of jaundice prior to major pancreatic resection {{would be associated with}} improved morbidity and mortality. However, clinical experience has not supported the laboratory results. Obstructive jaundice can be relieved preoperatively via an endoprosthesis introduced either percutaneously or endoscopically. Cohort studies have not shown any clinical benefit and in some the endoprostheses have been implicated in postoperative complications. The only randomized study has shown no benefit in preoperative drainage, but one recent study has confirmed that endoscopic drainage, whilst not conferring an advantage, did no harm. Hence, whilst preoperative drainage is not recommended, if for any reason operation needs to be delayed, endoscopic drainage via an endoprosthesis can be used without fear of adversely influencing the outcome...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: {{to analyse}} {{survival}} {{and quality of}} life of patients with <b>malignant</b> obstructive <b>jaundice</b> after palliative treatment, comparing endoscopic stent insertion and palliative surgical (palla-tive resection and bypass surgical). Patients and method: eighty and seven patients were included in a trial. They were distributed to endoscopic stent (50) and palliati-ve surgical (37). It analysed survival, quality of life and comfort index of jaundiced patients. The good quality of life was defined by absence of jaundice, pruritus and cholangitis after the initial treatment. Results: the median survival of the patients treated to endos-copic stent was 9, 6 months whereas the patients to surgical treat-ment survived a median of 17 months. The time free of disease was 4 months in stented patients and 10, 5 months in surgical pa-tients. There {{was no significant difference in}} comfort index betwe...|$|R
40|$|Background: Surgery for {{patients}} with <b>malignant</b> obstructive <b>jaundice</b> carries high morbidity and mortality rates. Preoperative biliary drainage (PBD) {{has been used in}} an attempt to improve the outcome in these patients. Aim: To review the evidence in the literature on whether PBD improves postoperative morbidity and mortality in obstructive jaundice patients. Method: Using Medline a literature search was performed for papers published in English from January 1980 to October 2000, using the text words 'obstructive jaundice', 'preoperative', 'drainage' and 'stent'. All retrieved papers which reported experimental or clinical observations relevant to the study aim were carefully analysed and the findings are summarised in this review. Results and Conclusion: There is no evidence in the literature to support the view that routine PBD improves postoperative morbidity and mortality in patients with obstructive jaundice undergoing resection. PBD has its own complications that cancel out its benefits. However, PBD could be beneficial in patients presenting with sepsis, coagulation abnormalities or malnutrition...|$|R
