Schreiner also broke the national news story of graffiti artist <b>Mr.</b> <b>André's</b> vandalism of Joshua Tree National Park. <b>Mr.</b> <b>André</b> attempted to threaten Modern Hiker with legal action for outing his actions, but the threats were eventually dropped when Saraiva paid a fine to the park.|$|R

40|$|In Agassi v Robinson (Her Majestyʹs Inspector of Taxes), a {{majority}} of the House of Lords found that payments under two sponsorship contracts between a company owned and controlled by <b>Mr</b> <b>Andre</b> Agassi, (Agassi Enterprises Inc) and Nike Inc and Head Sport AG were assessable under UK tax law. This was so despite (i) none of the parties to the contracts was resident, nor domiciled, in the United Kingdom and (ii) none of the payer companies conducted business, directly or indirectly, through branches/agencies in the United Kingdom. The article considers whether the Australian Taxation Office could similarly assess non‐resident sports‐persons, like Mr Agassi, personally, and/or entities they control, on payments made under sponsorship agreements with a company such as Nike Inc.

40|$|Fine {{titanium}} dioxide particles were hydrothermally {{treated in a}} sodium hydroxide aqueous solution. The treatment extended from 1 to 6 days leading to belt-like and wire-like structures of a metastable phase of sodium titanate, with typical widths and diameters between 8 and 40 nm, and lengths from 100 nm to several micrometers. These conclusions are supported by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy and high resolution transmission electron microscopy. The latter method revealed two set of space fringes with characteristic distances of 0. 29 and 0. 34 nm. These distances could correspond to the lattice spacing of Â½# 2; 311 # 3; and Â½# 2; 111 # 3; planes in Na 2 Ti 6 O 13 compounds.
