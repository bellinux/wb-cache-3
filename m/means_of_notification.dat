Findings {{confirm that the}} rate of retractions remains low but is increasing. The most commonly cited reason for retraction was research error or inability to reproduce results; the rate from research misconduct is an underestimate, since some retractions necessitated by research misconduct were reported as being due to inability to reproduce.

In a randomized controlled design, 1076 OPs were divided into three groups based on previous reporting behaviour: precontemplators not considering reporting, contemplators considering reporting and actioners reporting occupational diseases. Precontemplators and contemplators {{were randomly assigned to}} receive stage-matched, stage-mismatched or general information. Actioners were randomly assigned to receive personalized or standardized feedback upon notification. Outcome measures were the number of OPs reporting and the number of reported occupational diseases in a 180 -day period before and after the intervention. Precontemplators were significantly more male and self-employed compared to contemplators and actioners. There was no significant effect of stage-matched information versus stage-mismatched or general information on the percentage of reporting OPs and on the <b>mean</b> number <b>of</b> <b>notifications</b> in each group. Receiving any information affected reporting more in contemplators than in precontemplators.

40|$|Vehicle {{drivers are}} {{nowadays}} {{responsible for a}} large number of driving related and side activities in parallel. This results in more and more attention required for their observation and operation, and distracts from the primary task of driving. To cope with the rising demand, explicit and attentive interaction is increasingly replaced by implicit <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>notification.</b> The problem, however, is that the trend of rising information, supported by context- and activity-aware assistance systems, is still ongoing and implicit methods for information delivery hit their limits. To avoid occurrence of cognitive overload, new solutions are required to deal with the bunch of concurrent information. Subliminal interaction techniques are considered a promising approach to deliver information or warning signals to the driver without causing any supplementary workload. By starting with a review of related work on subliminal feedback, we try to identify potential fields of application of subliminal methods in the car domain. Identified solutions are discussed and recommendations are given of how to apply a specific technique while driving. We see great potential in this timely, relevant and important field of research and are quite confident that subliminal messaging will find its way into the automotive domain in the near future...|$|E

40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{evaluate}} {{the role of}} deep vein thrombosis {{as a cause of}} leg ulcers. Patients and methodsA population-based, case-control study was conducted in Central and North Auckland, New Zealand. Cases comprised 241 people aged 40 to 99 years and on the electoral roll, with current leg ulcers (all types). Cases were identified by <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>notification</b> from health professionals and by self-referral. Controls were 224 people in the same age group, without leg ulcers, who were selected from the electoral roll by using a stratified random sampling process. Main outcome measuresThe occurrence of leg ulceration as a consequence of exposure to deep vein thrombosis or being at high risk of deep vein thrombosis (that is, people with a family history of deep vein thrombosis, and/or a history of leg fracture and/or hip, leg, or foot surgery). ResultsAfter adjustment for age, sex, and other potential confounding factors, people who had a diagnosed thromboembolism were at almost three times higher risk of having a leg ulcer (odds ratio, 2. 92; 95 % confidence interval (CI), 1. 47 to 6. 08). In addition, people who had been at high risk of a venous thrombosis but were not diagnosed with this condition (eg, people with a history of major leg surgery) were also at increased risk of ulceration (odds ratio, 2. 25; 95 % CI, 1. 49 - 3. 42). Overall, 56 % (95 % CI, 33 % - 71 %) of leg ulcers were attributed to being at high risk of deep vein thrombosis. ConclusionsDeep vein thrombosis and factors that place people at high risk of deep vein thrombosis are an important cause of leg ulcers in older people.

There is {{a paucity of}} information on the government's mandatory TB notification order from the perspective of private medical practitioners (PPs). To understand the awareness, perception and barriers on TB notification among PPs in Chennai, India. Total of 190 PPs were approached in their clinics by trained field staff who collected data using a semi-structured and pre-coded questionnaire after getting informed consent. The data collected included PPs' specialization, TB management practices, awareness about the TB notification order, barriers in its implementation and their suggestions to improve notification. Of 190 PPs from varied specializations, 138 (73 %) had diagnosed TB cases in the prior three months, of whom 78 % referred these patients to government facilities. Of 138 PPs, 73 % were aware of the order on mandatory TB notification, of whom 46 (33 %) had ever notified a TB case. Of 120 PPs, 63 % reported reasons for not notifying TB cases. The main reasons reported for not notifying were lack of time (50 %), concerns regarding patients' confidentiality (24 %) and fear of offending patients (11 %). Of 145 PPs, 76 % provided feedback about information they felt uncomfortable reporting during notification. PPs felt most uncomfortable reporting patient's government-issued Aadhar number (77 %), followed by patient's phone number (37 %) and residential address (26 %). The preferred <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>notification</b> was through mobile phone communication (24 %), SMS (18 %) and e-mail (17 %). This study highlights that one-fourth of PPs were not aware of the TB notification order and not all those who were aware were notifying.

NOP provides a new manner to conceive, structure, and execute software, which allows better performance, causal-knowledge organization, and entity decoupling than standard solutions based upon current paradigms. These paradigms are essentially Imperative Paradigm (IP) and Declarative Paradigm (DP). In short, DP solutions are considered {{easier to use}} than IP solutions thanks {{to the concept of}} high-level programming. However, they are considered slower to execute and lesser flexible to program than IP. Anyway, both paradigms present similar drawbacks like causal-evaluation redundancies and strongly coupled entities, which decrease software performance and processing distribution feasibility. These problems exist due to an orientation to monolithic inference mechanism based upon sequential evaluation by <b>means</b> <b>of</b> searches over passive computational entities. NOP proposes another manner to structure software and make its inferences, which is based upon small, smart, and decoupled collaborative entities whose interaction happen by <b>means</b> <b>of</b> precise <b>notifications.</b> This paper discusses NOP as a paradigm and presents certain comparison of NOP against IP.

50|$|A death {{notification}} is {{the delivery}} of the news of a death to someone. A death notice describes the moment a person receives the news of someone’s death. There are many roles {{that contribute to the}} death notification process. The notifier is the person who delivers the death notice. They can be volunteers, medical personnel, or law enforcement. The receiver is the designated person receiving the information about the deceased. Typically, the receiver is a family member or friend of the one who has died. Death education is provided for multiple types of jobs to deliver the news efficiently for each situation. A proper death notification allows the receiver to begin the grieving process. The history <b>of</b> death <b>notification</b> dates back to the existence of humankind but there has always been different <b>means</b> <b>of</b> death <b>notification.</b> Before modern technology death notification would be done through telegram, there were not the same <b>means</b> <b>of</b> transportation today that allow for a more formal notification that is required. During the 1800s and early 1900s death notification was not as complex of a process. There were not the means to deliver a written notification, so notices were left inside funeral homes. Now as the world is constantly advancing, there are more requirements to follow. One of these requirements being that the name of the deceased is not released to any outside sources until after 24 hours of the survivors being notified. One key reason being that the survivors are the first to find out in the formal manner.|$|R
40|$|Adaptive control {{technologies}} that incorporate learning algorithms {{have been proposed}} to enable autonomous flight control and to maintain vehicle performance {{in the face of}} unknown, changing, or poorly defined operating environments [1 - 2]. At the present time, however, it is unknown how adaptive algorithms can be routinely verified, validated, and certified for use in safety-critical applications. Rigorous methods for adaptive software verification end validation must be developed to ensure that. the control software functions as required and is highly safe and reliable. A large gap appears to exist between the point at which control system designers feel the verification process is complete, and when FAA certification officials agree it is complete. Certification of adaptive flight control software verification is complicated by the use of learning algorithms (e. g., neural networks) and degrees of system non-determinism. Of course, analytical efforts must be made in the verification process to place guarantees on learning algorithm stability, rate of convergence, and convergence accuracy. However, to satisfy FAA certification requirements, it must be demonstrated that the adaptive flight control system is also able to fail and still allow the aircraft to be flown safely or to land, {{while at the same time}} providing a <b>means</b> <b>of</b> crew <b>notification</b> <b>of</b> the (impending) failure.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{identification}} of suitable patients {{is a common}} problem in clinical trials that is especially evident in tertiary care hospitals. Methods We developed and analysed a workflow, which uses routine data captured during patient care in a hospital information system (HIS), to identify potential trial subjects. Study nurses or physicians are notified automatically by email and verify eligibility. Results As a case study we implemented the system for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) trials in Münster. During a test period of 50 days 41 patients were identified by the system. 13 could be included as new trial patients, 7 were already included during earlier visits. According to review of paper records no AML trial patient was missed by the system. In addition, the hospital information system further allowed to preselect patients for specific trials based on their disease status and individual characteristics.
