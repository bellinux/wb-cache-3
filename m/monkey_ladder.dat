2500|$|Plants used {{to treat}} snakebites in Trinidad and Tobago are made into tinctures with alcohol or olive oil and kept in rum flasks called 'snake bottles'. Snake bottles contain several {{different}} plants and/or insects. The plants used include the vine called <b>monkey</b> <b>ladder</b> (Bauhinia cumanensis or Bauhinia excisa, Fabaceae) which is pounded {{and put on the}} bite. Alternatively a tincture is made with a piece of the vine and kept in a snake bottle. [...] Other plants used include: mat root (Aristolochia rugosa), cat's claw (Pithecellobim unguis-cati), tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum), snake bush (Barleria lupulina), obie seed (Cola nitida), and wild gri gri root (Acrocomia aculeata). Some snake bottles also contain the caterpillars (Battus polydamas, Papilionidae) that eat tree leaves (Aristolochia trilobata). Emergency snake medicines are obtained by chewing a three-inch piece of the root of bois canôt (Cecropia peltata) and administering this chewed-root solution to the bitten subject (usually a hunting dog). This is a common native plant of Latin America and the Caribbean which makes it appropriate as an emergency remedy. Another native plant used is mardi gras (Renealmia alpinia)(berries), which are crushed together with the juice of wild cane (Costus scaber) and given to the bitten. Quick fixes have included applying chewed tobacco from cigarettes, cigars or pipes. Making cuts around the puncture or sucking out the venom had been thought helpful in the past, but this course of treatment is now strongly discouraged, due to the risk of self-envenomation through knife cuts or cuts in the mouth (suction cups from snake bite kits can be used, but suctioning seldom provides any measurable benefit).|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Spatial {{cognition}} is {{an essential}} literacy for human beings. It enables people to recognize landmarks, identify spatial pattern, and make spatial decisions. To evaluate spatial cognitive abilities, way-finding has been widely adopted in previous studies. In the process of way-finding, one has to keep destination in memory, keep track of path, decide direction by checking surrounding environment, and head to the destination. However, research involving way-finding test in real-world situation is difficult to conduct, if {{a large amount of}} samples is required. Therefore, this study developed a way-finding test by using Google Maps Street View. Taking advantage of the Google Maps API, participants could navigate in areal-world environment on computer while behavior data were recorded. In this test, sixty five participants in Taipei area were recruited. The participants first read a paper map showing the start point and destination and then started to navigate in Google Maps Street View with a five minute limit. After the way-finding test, the participants continued with two psychological tasks, namely “mental rotation” and “Monkey Ladder”. <b>Monkey</b> <b>Ladder</b> measures the capacity of spatial working memory capacity, while mental rotation requires maintaining and matching information in different perspective. Furthermore, Santa Barbara Sense of Direction Scale (SBSOD), and GeoSpatial Thinking Ability Test (GSTAT) developed by this research team were given. The results of way-finding performances were categorized into arrival at destination (11 / 65), seeking and approaching destination (16 / 65) and fail to arrive (38 / 65). For quantitative analysis, two measures were calculated fo...|$|E
