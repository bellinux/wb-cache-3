5|$|In Batesian mimicry, {{the mimic}} {{effectively}} copies the coloration of an aposematic animal, {{known as the}} <b>model,</b> to deceive predators into behaving {{as if it were}} distasteful. The success of this dishonest display depends on the level of toxicity of the <b>model</b> and the abundance of the <b>model</b> in the geographical area. The more toxic the <b>model</b> is, {{the more likely it is}} that the predator will avoid the mimic. The abundance of the <b>model</b> species is also important for the success of the mimic because of frequency dependent selection. When the <b>model</b> is abundant, mimics with imperfect <b>model</b> patterns or slightly different coloration from the <b>model</b> are still avoided by predators. This is because the predator has a strong incentive to avoid potentially lethal organisms, given the likelihood of encountering one. However, in areas where the <b>model</b> is scarce or locally extinct, mimics are driven to accurate aposematic coloration. This is because predators attack imperfect mimics more readily where there is little chance that they are the <b>model</b> species. Frequency dependent selection may also have driven Batesian mimics to become polymorphic in rare cases where a single genetic switch controls appearance, as in the swallowtail butterflies (the Papilionidae).|$|E
