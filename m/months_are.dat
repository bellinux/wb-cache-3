In contrast, the winter <b>months</b> <b>are</b> dry. Eastern and southeastern areas of the region receive more precipitation than the western areas since they receive more summer rainfall. Precipitation is highly variable {{from year to year}} and appears to follow a cycle between dry and wet years in periods of about 2, 4–5, 6–8, and 16–22 years. In wet years, easterly winds caused by the subtropical South Atlantic High are stronger, causing moisture to flow towards this region; during dry years, these winds are weaker.|$|E

5|$|Oral {{antibiotics}} {{are recommended}} for {{no longer than}} three months as antibiotic courses exceeding this duration {{are associated with the}} development of antibiotic resistance and show no clear benefit over shorter courses. Furthermore, if long-term oral antibiotics beyond three <b>months</b> <b>are</b> thought to be necessary, it is recommended that benzoyl peroxide and/or a retinoid be used {{at the same time to}} limit the risk of P. acnes developing antibiotic resistance. Dapsone is not a first-line topical antibiotic due to higher cost and lack of clear superiority over other antibiotics. Topical dapsone is not recommended for use with benzoyl peroxide due to yellow-orange skin discoloration with this combination.|$|E
5|$|Several factors {{combine to}} create the dump months, most of them {{circumstances}} particular to the United States and Canada, the primary market for most major Hollywood releases. Both periods immediately follow the times of {{year in which the}} distributors concentrate films they expect to be the biggest critical and/or commercial successes, periods of increased spending on entertainment generally. While this often means that moviegoers have less disposable income afterwards, economics alone does not explain the dump months. The weather and competition from other forms of mass entertainment, especially professional sports, also play a part; the winter dump <b>months</b> <b>are</b> further affected by the Academy Awards eligibility rules.|$|E
5|$|The dump <b>months</b> <b>are</b> {{what the}} film {{community}} calls the two periods {{of the year}} when there are lowered commercial and critical expectations for most new releases. Audiences during these periods are smaller {{than the rest of the}} year, so no tentpole movies are released. January and February are usually most commonly described this way, with August and September sometimes included. Releases during those times primarily include films that would have been released at other times of year had they done better at test screenings, films with less prominent stars, genre films (particularly horror), movies that cannot be easily marketed and films intended for a teenage audience, which has fewer entertainment options outside the home.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, the {{discrepancy}} between the molad interval and the mean synodic <b>month</b> <b>is</b> accumulating at an accelerating rate, since the mean synodic <b>month</b> <b>is</b> progressively shortening due to gravitational tidal effects. Measured on a strictly uniform time scale, such as that provided by an atomic clock, the mean synodic <b>month</b> <b>is</b> becoming gradually longer, but since the tides slow Earth's rotation rate even more, the mean synodic <b>month</b> <b>is</b> becoming gradually shorter in terms of mean solar time.|$|R
