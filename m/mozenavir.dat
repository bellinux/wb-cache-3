40|$|Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) is the causative {{agent of}} the {{pandemic}} disease Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS). HIV acts to disrupt the immune system which makes the body susceptible to opportunistic infections. Untreated, AIDS is generally fatal. Twenty years of research by countless scientists around the world {{has led to the}} discovery and exploitation of several targets in the replication cycle of HIV. Many lives have been saved, prolonged and improved {{as a result of this}} massive effort. One particularly successful target has been the inhibition of HIV protease. In combination with the inhibition of HIV reverse transcriptase, protease inhibitors have helped to reduce viral loads and partially restore the immune system. Unfortunately, viral mutations leading to drug resistance and harmful side-effects of the current medicines have identified the need for new drugs to combat HIV. This study presents computational efforts to understand the interaction of inhibitors to HIV protease. The first part of this study has used molecular modelling and Comparative Molecular Field Analysis (CoMFA) to help explain the structure-active relationship of a novel series of protease inhibitors. The inhibitors are sulfamide derivatives structurally similar to the cyclic urea candidate drug <b>mozenavir</b> (DMP- 450). The central ring of the sulfamides twists to adopt a nonsymmetrical binding mode distinct from that of the cyclic ureas. The energetics of this twist has been studied with ab initio calculations to develop improved empirical force field parameters for use in molecular modelling. The second part of this study has focused on an analysis of the association and dissociation kinetics of a broad collection of HIV protease inhibitors. Quantitative models have been derived using CoMFA which relate the dissociation rate back to the chemical structures. Efforts have also been made to improve the models by systematically varying the parameters used to generate them...|$|E
40|$|Virtually all the {{compounds}} {{that are currently}} used or are subject of advanced clinical trials {{for the treatment of}} HIV infections, belong to one of the following classes: (i) nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) : i. e., zidovudine, didanosine, zalcitabine, stavudine, lamivudine, abacavir, emtricitabine and nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NtRTIs) (i. e., tenofovir disoproxil fumarate); (ii) non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) : i. e., nevirapine, delavirdine, efavirenz, emivirine; and (iii) protease inhibitors (PIs) : i. e., saquinavir, ritonavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, amprenavir, and lopinavir. In addition to the reverse transcriptase and protease reaction, various other events in the HIV replicative cycle can be considered as potential targets for chemotherapeutic intervention: (i) viral adsorption, through binding to the viral envelope glycoprotein gp 120 (polysulfates, polysulfonates, polycarboxylates, polyoxometalates, polynucleotides, and negatively charged albumins); (ii) viral entry, through blockade of the viral coreceptors CXCR 4 (i. e., bicyclam (AMD 3100) derivatives) and CCR 5 (i. e., TAK- 779 derivatives); (iii) virus-cell fusion, through binding to the viral envelope glycoprotein gp 41 (T- 20, T- 1249); (iv) viral assembly and disassembly, through NCp 7 zinc finger-targeted agents [2, 2 '-dithiobisbenzamides (DIBAs), azadicarbonamide (ADA) ]; (v) proviral DNA integration, through integrase inhibitors such as 4 -aryl- 2, 4 -dioxobutanoic acid derivatives; (vi) viral mRNA transcription, through inhibitors of the transcription (transactivation) process (flavopiridol, fluoroquinolones). Also, various new NRTIs, NNRTIs, and PIs have been developed that possess, respectively: (i) improved metabolic characteristics (i. e., phosphoramidate and cyclosaligenyl pronucleotides by-passing the first phosphorylation step of the NRTIs), (ii) increased activity ["second" or "third" generation NNRTIs (i. e., TMC- 125, DPC- 083) ] against those HIV strains that are resistant to the "first" generation NNRTIs, or (iii), {{as in the case of}} PIs, a different, modified peptidic (i. e., azapeptidic (atazanavir)) or non-peptidic scaffold (i. e., cyclic urea (<b>mozenavir),</b> 4 -hydroxy- 2 -pyrone (tipranavir)).

In addition to the reverse transcriptase (RT) and protease reaction, various other events in the HIV replicative cycle can be considered as potential targets for chemotherapeutic intervention: (i) viral adsorption, through binding to the viral envelope glycoprotein gp 120 (polysulfates, polysulfonates, polycarboxylates, polyoxometalates, polynucleotides, and negatively charged albumins); (ii) viral entry, through blockade of the viral coreceptors CXCR 4 [bicyclam (AMD 3100) derivatives] and CCR 5 (TAK- 779 derivatives); (iii) virus–cell fusion, through binding to the viral envelope glycoprotein gp 41 (T- 20, T- 1249); (iv) viral assembly and disassembly, through NCp 7 zinc finger-targeted agents [2, 2 ′-dithiobisbenzamides (DIBAs), azadicarbonamide (ADA) ]; (v) proviral DNA integration, through integrase inhibitors such as 4 -aryl- 2, 4 -dioxobutanoic acid derivatives; (vi) viral mRNA transcription, through inhibitors of the transcription (transactivation) process (flavopiridol, fluoroquinolones).

Nonpeptidic PIs may be expected to inhibit HIV mutant strains that have become resistant to peptidomimetic PIs. Given the multitude of molecular targets with which anti-HIV agents can interact, one should be cautious in extrapolating the mode of action of these agents from cell-free enzymatic assays to intact cells. Two examples in point are l-chicoric acid and the nonapeptoid CGP 64222, which were initially described as an integrase inhibitor or Tat antagonist, respectively, but later shown to primarily act as virus adsorption/entry inhibitors, the latter through blockade of CXCR 4...|$|E
