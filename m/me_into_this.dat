500|$|After {{his father}} left, Shirley took many odd jobs {{to support the}} family, up to four at the same time. In his 1997 {{biography}} Bad As I Wanna Be, he expresses his feelings for his father: [...] "I haven't seen my father in more than 30 years, so what's there to miss... I {{just look at it}} like this: Some man brought <b>me</b> <b>into</b> <b>this</b> world. That doesn't mean I have a father". (He would not meet his father again until 2012.) ...|$|E
500|$|In January 1996, Madonna {{travelled}} to Buenos Aires {{to research}} Eva's life, {{and met with}} several people who had known her before her death. During filming, she fell sick many times due to the intense emotional effort required, and midway through production, she discovered she was pregnant. Her daughter Lourdes was born on October 14, 1996. Madonna published a diary of the film shoot in Vanity Fair. She said of the experience, [...] "This is the role I was born to play. I put everything of <b>me</b> <b>into</b> <b>this</b> because {{it was much more}} than a role in a movie. It was exhilarating and intimidating at the same time... And I am prouder of Evita than anything else I have done." ...|$|E
500|$|In June 2013, fellow {{state senator}} Don Benton filed a {{complaint}} against Rivers, claiming she had broken a senate floor rule by swearing at him during a floor discussion. Benton also claimed that Rivers had screamed at him on one other occasion, during a Republican caucus. He claimed that he had felt physically threatened, saying, [...] "It was a very uncomfortable feeling. I {{have been on the}} receiving end of many heated comments over the years, but I have never before felt the threat of physical violence." [...] Rivers responded with an apology; he took issue with some of the wording in the apology and he filed the complaint. Many have come out in support of Rivers, who claims that Benton was harassing her, adding she will, [...] "stand my ground against anyone who attempts to bully, intimidate or threaten me." [...] Some have labeled Benton a hypocrite, as he recently lifted sanctions against Pam Roach, who had been seen screaming on the floor and had mistreated staff. In a January 2014 decision, officials in the Washington State Legislature have decided both Senators were at fault for the spat. They determined that Benton had harassed Rivers, which provoked her. On the decision, Rivers stated, [...] "I have to conclude that he was trying to bait <b>me</b> <b>into</b> <b>this</b> reaction, which unfortunately he did.” ...|$|E

500|$|In the 1996 musical, Evita, Madonna {{played the}} title role of Eva Perón. For a long time, Madonna had desired to play Perón and wrote to {{director}} Alan Parker to explain why she would be perfect for the part. She said later, [...] "This is the role I was born to play. I put everything of <b>me</b> <b>into</b> <b>this</b> because {{it was much more}} than a role in a movie. It was exhilarating and intimidating at the same time. And I am prouder of Evita than anything else I have done." [...] After securing the role, she had vocal training and learned about the history of Argentina and Perón. During shooting she became ill several times due to the intense emotional effort required. However, as she told Oprah Winfrey, she was also pregnant during the filming: [...] "I was winded after every take. I had to lie on the couch every ten minutes so I could recover from dizzy spells, I was worried that I was shaking the baby around too much and that would injure it in some way." [...] Madonna wrote in her personal diary at the time: [...] "Ironically, this feeling of vulnerability and weakness is helping me in the movie. I'm sure Evita felt this way every day of her life once she discovered she was ill." ...|$|E

[...] "He wowed <b>me</b> <b>into</b> <b>this</b> horrible film, selling it as some {{intellectual}} comment on the sex industry. I walked out after 45 minutes. The screen went dead every time that woman was on it." [...] (Select magazine, August 1996) ...|$|E

60|$|When Dr. Cunningham {{had made}} up his mind that nothing more could be done for me he put bags of hot ashes all over me.
