5|$|The <b>main</b> <b>task</b> of the Ministry was {{to develop}} {{proposals}} on issues linked to the judicial system; the election of judges, elect the judiciary, organising the judiciary, studying and summarising of the jurisprudence in coordination with the Supreme Court, and to organise work {{for the maintenance of}} judicial statistics. According to Soviet law, the Ministry could propose various measures to improve the Soviet court system. According to Article 1 of the People's Commissariat for Justice, the commissariat's <b>main</b> <b>task</b> was to supervise the legal activities of the Soviet central agencies and the people's procurator.|$|E
5|$|As the Allied {{offensive}} gained steam, Whitehead's <b>main</b> <b>task</b> was {{to shift}} his aircraft forward, advancing the bomb line incrementally towards Japan. When the P-38 Lightning {{arrived in the}} theater in late 1942, Whitehead at last received a fighter that could match the Japanese A6M Zero. To speed up the Allied advance, the Fifth Air Force developed a number of technical and tactical innovations that extended the range of its aircraft, thus increasing the distance of each Allied advance, which was dependent on the range of Whitehead's aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Charles R. Forbes, the {{energetic}} {{director of the}} Veterans' Bureau, sought to consolidate control of veterans' hospitals and their construction in his bureau. At the start of Harding's presidency, this power was vested in the Treasury Department. The politically-powerful American Legion backed Forbes and denigrated those who opposed him, like Secretary Mellon, and in April 1922, Harding agreed to transfer control to the Veterans' Bureau. Forbes' <b>main</b> <b>task</b> was to ensure that new hospitals were built {{around the country to}} help the 300,000 wounded World War I veterans.|$|E

5|$|During the {{formation}} of the Soviet state, in the late 1910s and early 1920s, the People's Commissariat for Finance of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (RSFSR) was created. The commissariat did not differ greatly from that of Imperial Russia's Ministry of Finance and its system. The Soviet finance ministry was a heavily centralised structure, while its predecessor was not. During its humble beginnings, the <b>main</b> <b>task</b> of the People's Commissariat of Finance were: confiscation of property, robbery and requisition; printing and creating money; and taxation.|$|E
5|$|Nansen {{accepted}} {{the position of}} curator of the Royal Frederick University's zoology collection, a post which carried a salary but involved no duties; the university was satisfied by the association with the explorer's name. Nansen's <b>main</b> <b>task</b> in the following weeks was writing {{his account of the}} expedition, but he found time late in June to visit London, where he met the Prince of Wales (the future King Edward VII), and addressed a meeting of the Royal Geographical Society (RGS).|$|E
5|$|Sverdrup's <b>main</b> <b>task</b> now was to {{keep his}} crew busy. He ordered a {{thorough}} spring cleaning, and set a party to chip {{away some of the}} surrounding ice which was threatening to destabilise the ship. Although there was no immediate danger to Fram, Sverdrup oversaw the repair and overhaul of sledges, and the organisation of provisions should it after all be necessary to abandon ship and march to land. With the arrival of warmer weather as the 1895 summer approached, Sverdrup resumed daily ski practice. Amid these activities a full programme of meteorological, magnetic and oceanographic activities continued under Scott Hansen; Fram had become a moving oceanographic, meteorological and biological laboratory.|$|E

5|$|The Mongols {{comprehensively}} plundered {{the eastern}} territories of the Kingdom of Hungary, including Transylvania, during both their invasion in 1241 and their withdrawal the following year. The {{consolidation of the}} province was the <b>main</b> <b>task</b> of Lawrence of the Aba clan, who was appointed by Béla IV and held the office for 10 years from 1242. One of his successors, also appointed by Béla IV, banus Ernye of the Ákos clan, was dismissed in 1260 by the king's son, Stephen who had just taken over Transylvania with the title of duke. The duke's action showed emerging tensions between father and son, rather than conflicts between the duke and the banus.|$|E
5|$|Within these {{premises}} Bruce housed his meteorological and oceanographic equipment, {{in preparation}} for future expeditions. He also met there with fellow-explorers, including Nansen, Shackleton, and Roald Amundsen. His <b>main</b> <b>task,</b> however, was masterminding {{the preparation of the}} SNAE scientific reports. These, at considerable cost and much delay, were published between 1907 and 1920, except for one volume—Bruce's own log—that remained unpublished until 1992, after its rediscovery. Bruce maintained a wide correspondence with experts, including Sir Joseph Hooker, who had travelled to the Antarctic with James Clark Ross in 1839–43, and to whom Bruce dedicated his short book Polar Exploration.|$|E
5|$|After the Fall of France, some French {{scientists}} {{escaped to}} Britain with their stock of heavy water. They were temporarily {{installed in the}} Cavendish Laboratory at the University of Cambridge, where they worked on reactor design. The MAUD Committee was uncertain whether this was relevant to the <b>main</b> <b>task</b> of Tube Alloys, that of building an atomic bomb, although there remained a possibility that a reactor {{could be used to}} breed plutonium, which might be used in one. It therefore recommended that they be relocated to the United States, and co-located with the Manhattan Project's reactor effort. Due to American concerns about security (many of the scientists were foreign nationals) and patent claims by the French scientists and Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI), it was decided to relocate them to Canada instead.|$|E

5|$|During the Second World War, Wilkinson {{served in}} Churchill's wartime {{coalition}} {{as a junior}} minister, mainly at the Ministry of Home Security where she worked under Herbert Morrison. She supported Morrison's attempts to replace Clement Attlee as the Labour Party's leader; nevertheless, when he formed his postwar government, Attlee appointed Wilkinson as Minister of Education. By this time, her health was poor, a legacy of years of overwork. She saw her <b>main</b> <b>task</b> in office as {{the implementation of the}} wartime coalition's 1944 Education Act, rather than the more radical introduction of comprehensive schools favoured by many in the Labour Party. Much of her energy was applied to organising the raising of the school-leaving age from 14 to 15. During the exceptionally cold weather of early 1947, she succumbed to a bronchial disease, and died after an overdose of medication, which the coroner at her inquest declared was accidental.|$|E
5|$|Generally, {{the player}} starts {{out with a}} Dungeon Heart and some Imps. The Dungeon Heart has the same purpose as the {{original}} game: it serves as the dungeon's life force. If destroyed, the player loses. In Dungeon Keeper 2, the heart has additional functions: regenerating mana (used to cast spells), doubling as a gold-storage area, producing Imps, and sending certain creatures to investigate threats it detects. Gold is the currency used to construct rooms, traps, and doors, and pay minions. Gold is obtained primarily by digging gold and gem seams, the latter providing an unlimited supply. This is performed by the Imps, the main workforce of the dungeon, who dig and claim tiles for the player to control. Another <b>main</b> <b>task</b> Imps perform is the fortification of walls adjacent to tiles owned by the player, although this no longer makes them impenetrable to enemies, but merely makes digging take longer.|$|E
5|$|In 1966, Gowing became Reader in Contemporary History {{at the new}} University of Kent, Canterbury, {{covering}} scientific, technical, {{economic and}} social history. The UKAEA retained her as a consultant, paying her £1,000 per annum for three years. Her <b>main</b> <b>task</b> was to write a two-volume sequel to Britain and Atomic Energy 1939–1945 covering the period from 1945 to 1952. To help out, the UKAEA brought in Lorna Arnold from its Health and Safety Division in 1967 to become the Departmental Records Officer (DRO) and Gowing's Assistant Historian. Despite their being accredited as official historians, the Atomic Weapons Establishment would not let them take their notes away, {{so they had to}} do their writing on site, {{under the watchful eye of}} Aldermaston's DRO. To get there Gowing had to catch the train each day from Canterbury to London Waterloo station, and then the Tube to Paddington and the railway to Reading, where Arnold picked Gowing up in her car and drove to Harwell.|$|E

5|$|Northumberland served {{occasionally}} in Henry V's wars in France {{over the following}} years. He joined the king on an expedition to the Continent in 1416, and sent a minor contingent of soldiers the next year. His <b>main</b> <b>task,</b> however, was the defence of the Scottish Borders, and on 16 December 1416 he was appointed Warden of the East March. In late August 1417, the Scots invaded northern England; while Albany laid siege to Berwick Castle, the Earl of Douglas attempted to take Roxburgh Castle. Percy lifted the siege of Berwick, and forced both Albany and Douglas across the border. At the same time, he was also involved in national political affairs, and acted as steward at the coronation of Henry's queen Catherine on 24 February 1421.|$|E
5|$|Once the {{revolution}} concluded following the Dutch–Indonesian Round Table Conference of 1949, Soeman was recalled to Pekanbaru {{and made the}} head of the regional branch of the Department of Education and Culture. His <b>main</b> <b>task</b> was reestablishing and reinvigorating the education system in Riau following three years of the Japanese occupation and four years of revolution. Desks had been used for firewood, school buildings had been razed to prevent enemy forces from using them, and much of the population had been unable to attend regular classes. Furthermore, the department did not have sufficient funding to support reconstruction. Over the next three years Soeman led communal work projects dedicated to restoring Riau's education facilities, relying on voluntary contributions from the populace.|$|E
5|$|The mayor's main duties are {{to liaise}} with the {{municipal}} council, district councils {{and the entire}} administrative apparatus of the canton, and to approve and implement the decisions taken by the municipal council. The number {{of members of the}} municipal council varies from one canton to another, and they are elected by local elections held every four years. The head of the council is titled the municipal president (presidente municipal). The council's <b>main</b> <b>task</b> is to manage the canton at the local level, and is responsible for planning basic policies and establishing budgets. More specifically, the responsibilities include urban and agricultural planning and organizing cultural affairs, health care, education and industry. Each municipal president appoints a number of working commissions that deal with issues specific to the municipality.|$|E

5|$|The mission {{failed in}} its <b>main</b> <b>task</b> of {{rallying}} Afghanistan, under Emir Habibullah Khan, to the German and Turkish war effort, but it influenced other major events. In Afghanistan, the expedition triggered reforms and drove political turmoil {{that culminated in}} {{the assassination of the}} Emir in 1919, which in turn precipitated the Third Afghan War. It influenced the Kalmyk Project of nascent Bolshevik Russia to propagate socialist revolution in Asia, with one goal being the overthrow of the British Raj. Other consequences included the formation of the Rowlatt Committee to investigate sedition in India as influenced by Germany and Bolshevism, and changes in the Raj's approach to the Indian independence movement immediately after World War I.|$|E
5|$|At a {{professional}} level, most matches produce {{only a few}} goals. For example, the 2005–06 season of the English Premier League produced an average of 2.48 goals per match. The Laws of the Game do not specify any player positions other than goalkeeper, {{but a number of}} specialised roles have evolved. Broadly, these include three main categories: strikers, or forwards, whose <b>main</b> <b>task</b> is to score goals; defenders, who specialise in preventing their opponents from scoring; and midfielders, who dispossess the opposition and keep possession of the ball to pass it to the forwards on their team. Players in these positions are referred to as outfield players, to distinguish them from the goalkeeper. These positions are further subdivided according to the area of the field in which the player spends most time. For example, there are central defenders, and left and right midfielders. The ten outfield players may be arranged in any combination. The number of players in each position determines the style of the team's play; more forwards and fewer defenders creates a more aggressive and offensive-minded game, while the reverse creates a slower, more defensive style of play. While players typically spend most of the game in a specific position, there are few restrictions on player movement, and players can switch positions at any time. The layout of a team's players is known as a formation. Defining the team's formation and tactics is usually the prerogative of the team's manager.|$|E
5|$|For Operation Barbarossa, {{initially}} four Einsatzgruppen were created, each numbering 500–990 men {{to comprise}} a total force of 3,000. Einsatzgruppen A, B, and C {{were to be}} attached to Army Groups North, Centre, and South; Einsatzgruppe D {{was assigned to the}} 11th Army. The Einsatzgruppe for Special Purposes operated in eastern Poland starting in July 1941. The Einsatzgruppen were {{under the control of the}} RSHA, headed by Heydrich and later by his successor, SS-Obergruppenführer Ernst Kaltenbrunner. Heydrich gave them a mandate to secure the offices and papers of the Soviet state and Communist Party; to liquidate all the higher cadres of the Soviet state; and to instigate and encourage pogroms against Jewish populations. The men of the Einsatzgruppen were recruited from the SD, Gestapo, Kriminalpolizei (Kripo), Orpo, and Waffen-SS. Each Einsatzgruppe was under the operational control of the Higher SS Police Chiefs in its area of operations. In May 1941, General Wagner and SS-Brigadeführer Walter Schellenberg agreed that the Einsatzgruppen in front-line areas were to operate under army command, while the army provided the Einsatzgruppen with all necessary logistical support. Given their <b>main</b> <b>task</b> was defeating the enemy, the army left the pacification of the civilian population to the Einsatzgruppen, who offered support as well as prevented subversion. This did not preclude their participation in acts of violence against civilians, as many members of the Wehrmacht assisted the Einsatzgruppen in rounding up and killing Jews of their own accord.|$|E
