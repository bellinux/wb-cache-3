500|$|Mathias' {{disagreements}} {{with the administration}} became well-known, causing columnists Rowland Evans and Robert Novak to name him the [...] "new supervillain... in President Nixon's doghouse". Evans and Novak also commented that [...] "not since [...] was defeated with White House connivance has any Republican so outraged <b>Mr.</b> <b>Nixon</b> and his senior staff as Mathias. The senator's liberalism and tendency to bolt party lines have bred animosity in the inner sanctum". Due to their differing ideologies, there was speculation that Mathias {{was going to be}} [...] "purged" [...] from the party by Nixon in a similar manner as Goodell in 1971, but these threats disappeared after the Watergate scandal escalated. By the numbers, Mathias sided with the Nixon administration 47% of the time, and voted with the majority of his Republican colleagues in the Senate 31% of the time, during his first term.|$|E
500|$|Author J. C. Furnas {{regretted that}} [...] "a Presidential year always makes Dooleyites feel frustrated. [...] In 1960 we need Mr. Dooley to deal {{adequately}} with {{such things as}} public-opinion polls; Mr. Truman's opinion of primaries; the spring swarming of the Kennedys in Minnesota; [...] the problem [...] whether <b>Mr.</b> <b>Nixon</b> should invite Checkers back into the act". Writing again in 1991, Furnas suggested potential Dooley targets might include the Bork and Souter confirmation hearings, and the omnipresence of blue jeans; but that an impediment to a revival of interest in Dooley was the present-day view of dialect works as demeaning. English professor John W. Lowe stated that Dooley [...] "set the model for an ethnic spokesman who could be entertaining and informative {{at the same time}} using humor to mask a subversive form of humor and get a message across. Then, the Irish made it, and they found his brogue and dialect embarrassing." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{securing}} the Republican nomination in 1980, Ronald Reagan considered his former rival Ford {{as a potential}} vice-presidential runningmate, but negotiations between the Reagan and Ford camps at the Republican National Convention were unsuccessful. Ford conditioned his acceptance on Reagan's agreement to an unprecedented [...] "co-presidency", giving Ford the power to control key executive branch appointments (such as Kissinger as Secretary of State and Alan Greenspan as Treasury Secretary). After rejecting these terms, Reagan offered the vice-presidential nomination instead to George H. W. Bush. Ford did appear in a campaign commercial for the Reagan-Bush ticket, in which he declared that {{the country would be}} [...] "better served by a Reagan presidency rather than a continuation of the weak and politically expedient policies of Jimmy Carter". On October 8, 1980, Ford said President Nixon's involvement in the general election potentially could negatively impact the Reagan campaign: [...] "I {{think it would have been}} much more helpful if <b>Mr.</b> <b>Nixon</b> had stayed in the background during this campaign. It would have been much more beneficial to Ronald Reagan." ...|$|E

2500|$|In his memoirs, Holloway III {{complained that}} [...] "there {{has often been}} a tacit {{presumption}} {{that my father was}} in a position to advance my career as I gained seniority in the Navy. On the contrary, as a retired officer he had little or no influence over his own future, much less mine." [...] As an example of this presumption, when President Richard M. Nixon approved Holloway III's nomination to succeed Admiral Elmo R. Zumwalt Jr. as chief of naval operations, Zumwalt believed that Nixon acquiesced mainly to avoid overruling the recommendation of his secretary of defense, but that, [...] "In addition, and I really think this was a factor, <b>Mr.</b> <b>Nixon</b> remembered Jimmy's father from his own period of naval service." ...|$|E

40|$|Susan Nixon died in 1881 {{following}} a surgical error. Her surgeon, Dr W. E. Warren, excised a normal 7 -month gravid uterus under the misapprehension {{that he was}} removing a tubular pregnancy. It is believed that <b>Mrs</b> <b>Nixon</b> {{was the first woman}} in Australia to have an abdominal hysterectomy and the second to have a live Caesarean section. The surgical misadventure that resulted in <b>Mrs</b> <b>Nixon</b> 2 ̆ 7 s death became a public scandal, which gained currency through both parliamentary debate and the popular press. The purpose of referring to this case is to explore the mechanisms of accountability that surgeons faced in the 1880 s − a decade of rapid change in the practice of surgery. The response of late nineteenth century society to surgical error and the resultant reaction of the medical profession have resonances that are relevant to surgeons practising today. <br /...|$|R
