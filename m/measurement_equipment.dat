5|$|The Norwegian Institute for Air Research (NILU) {{maintains}} air {{and atmospheric}} <b>measurement</b> <b>equipment</b> at Troll. Combined {{with a similar}} measuring station, Zeppelin in Ny-Ålesund, Svalbard, Norway. This allows the institute to collect such data from both polar regions. In particular, the facility measures aerosols, organic and inorganic pollution, ozone and ultraviolet (UV) radiation. NILU also creates air samples annually to generate data for trend analysis. The weekly air pollution measurements are compared to equivalent measurements at Zeppelin. Ground measurements are taken of ozone and mercury, two of the greatest pollution threats in the polar regions. Stratosphere measurements are conducted to measure ozone and UV levels, in particular to gain additional information about ozone depletion and the Antarctic ozone hole.|$|E
25|$|Likewise, UV {{intensity}} can {{be higher}} or lower for surfaces at different angles to the horizontal. For example, if people are walking or standing outdoors, UV exposure to the eyes and vertical surfaces of skin, such as the face, can actually be more severe {{when the sun is}} lower (though UVB:UVA ratio can also differ), such as the end of a summer's day, or winter afternoons on a ski trail. This is partly a consequence {{of the fact that the}} <b>measurement</b> <b>equipment</b> upon which the index is based is a flat horizontal surface.|$|E
25|$|Accelerator-based light-ion fusion is a {{technique}} using particle accelerators to achieve particle kinetic energies sufficient to induce light-ion fusion reactions. Accelerating light ions is relatively easy, and {{can be done in}} an efficient manner—requiring only a vacuum tube, a pair of electrodes, and a high-voltage transformer; fusion can be observed with as little as 10 kV between the electrodes. The key problem with accelerator-based fusion (and with cold targets in general) is that fusion cross sections are many orders of magnitude lower than Coulomb interaction cross sections. Therefore, the vast majority of ions expend their energy emitting bremsstrahlung radiation and the ionization of atoms of the target. Devices referred to as sealed-tube neutron generators are particularly relevant to this discussion. These small devices are miniature particle accelerators filled with deuterium and tritium gas in an arrangement that allows ions of those nuclei to be accelerated against hydride targets, also containing deuterium and tritium, where fusion takes place, releasing a flux of neutrons. Hundreds of neutron generators are produced annually for use in the petroleum industry where they are used in <b>measurement</b> <b>equipment</b> for locating and mapping oil reserves.|$|E

500|$|As {{discussed}} in the Structure and organization section, the hydrophobic attraction of lipid tails in water is the primary force holding lipid bilayers together. Thus, the elastic modulus of the bilayer is primarily determined by how much extra area is exposed to water when the lipid molecules are stretched apart. It is not surprising given this understanding of the forces involved that {{studies have shown that}} Ka varies strongly with osmotic pressure [...] but only weakly with tail length and unsaturation. Because the forces involved are so small, it is difficult to experimentally determine Ka. Most techniques require sophisticated microscopy and very sensitive <b>measurement</b> <b>equipment.</b>|$|E
500|$|A {{method of}} {{establishing}} precise geodetic baselines, invented by Yrjö Väisälä, exploited the low coherence length of white light. Initially, white light was split in two, with the reference beam [...] "folded", bouncing back-and-forth six times between a mirror pair spaced precisely 1 m apart. Only if the test path was precisely 6 times the reference path would fringes be seen. Repeated applications {{of this procedure}} allowed precise measurement of distances up to 864 meters. Baselines thus established were used to calibrate geodetic distance <b>measurement</b> <b>equipment,</b> leading to a metrologically traceable scale for geodetic networks measured by these instruments. (This method has been superseded by GPS.) ...|$|E
500|$|After the war, Urey became {{professor}} of chemistry at the Institute for Nuclear Studies, {{and then became}} Ryerson {{professor of}} chemistry at the University of Chicago in 1952. He did not continue his pre-war research with isotopes. However, applying the knowledge gained with hydrogen to oxygen, {{he realized that the}} fractionation between carbonate and water for oxygen-18 and oxygen-16 would decrease by a factor of 1.04 between [...] The ratio of the isotopes could then be used to determine average temperatures, assuming that the <b>measurement</b> <b>equipment</b> was sufficiently sensitive. The team included his colleague Ralph Buchsbaum. Examination of a 100-million-year-old belemnite then indicated the summer and winter temperatures that it had lived through over a period of four years. For this pioneering paleoclimatic research, Urey was awarded the Arthur L. Day Medal by the Geological Society of America, and the Goldschmidt Medal of the Geochemical Society.|$|E

500|$|While {{the number}} of storms in the Atlantic has {{increased}} since 1995, there is no obvious global trend. The annual number of tropical cyclones worldwide remains about 87±10. However, the ability of climatologists to make long-term data analysis in certain basins {{is limited by the}} lack of reliable historical data in some basins, primarily in the Southern Hemisphere. In spite of that, {{there is some evidence that}} the intensity of hurricanes is increasing. In 2006, Kerry Emanuel stated, [...] "Records of hurricane activity worldwide show an upswing of both the maximum wind speed in and the duration of hurricanes. The energy released by the average hurricane (again considering all hurricanes worldwide) seems to have increased by around 70% in the past 30years or so, corresponding to about a 15% increase in the maximum wind speed and a 60% increase in storm lifetime." [...] At the time, Emanuel theorized that increased heat from global warming was driving this trend, however, some argue that Emanuel's own research in 2008 refuted this theory. Others contend that the trend does not exist at all, but instead is a figment created by faulty readings from primitive 1970s-era <b>measurement</b> <b>equipment.</b> Vecchi and Knutson (2008) found a weakly positive, although not statistically-significant trend in {{the number of}} North Atlantic tropical cyclones for 1878–2006, but also a surprisingly strong decrease in cyclone duration over this period.|$|E
