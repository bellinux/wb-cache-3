25|$|Laurence Krieg, a young fan, {{wrote to}} Lewis, {{asking him to}} {{adjudicate}} between his views of the correct sequence of reading the novels – according to the sequence of events, with The Magician's Nephew being placed first – {{and that of his}} mother, who thought the order of publication was more appropriate. Lewis wrote back, appearing to support the younger Krieg's views, although he did point out that the views of the author <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> guidance, and that perhaps it would not matter what order they were read in.|$|E
500|$|The song's {{accompanying}} {{music video}} was filmed in November 2012 and premiered on 5 December 2012. The video has a metaphorical theme, and features Lewis {{in a giant}} bird cage in a dimly lit room, wearing the long ivory sleeved dress and [...] "jewelled eye decorations". Some scenes show the singer in a shadow and darker settings, while others are light and colourful. For most of the video, Lewis ponders {{about being able to}} escape her cage and experience freedom. At the end of the video, she realises that the cage is in fact unlocked and she is able to leave her confine, and leaves. Lucy Buckland for the Daily Mail felt that Lewis looks [...] "positively mournful" [...] in the video, and that while it <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> advert for feminism, she looks [...] "beautiful".|$|E

500|$|In {{contrast}} to the game's negative response, GameZone said {{that even though the}} game does not feature continuous play, [...] "the action flows well once into an event". GameZone's review praised the game's audio track, and thought it was [...] "fun" [...] because the comedy is straight from the television show, and the characters will [...] "bring a smile to your face". Reiner also commented positively on the soundtrack and that the game <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> wrestling game available, [...] "but it delivers what the cover advertises". GameSpot's Frank Provo said that [...] "wit" [...] and [...] "charm" [...] are the two most redeeming features of The Simpsons Wrestling, and in spite of the game's weak gameplay, it has [...] "plenty of laughs in store" [...] that devoted fans of The Simpsons will enjoy. The BBC's David Gibbon wrote that the end result of the track is one that will not [...] "fail to impress fans".|$|E
500|$|Myles McNutt of The A.V. Club, Gillette's former employer, {{awarded the}} episode a [...] "B–" [...] {{and noted that}} he did not like Todd Packer, nor the episodes where his {{character}} is intentionally supposed to be vile. He did, however, enjoy the fact that Packer's antics caused Jim and Dwight to unite {{in the face of a}} common enemy, a plot that McNutt said [...] "had a scrappy feel to it". McNutt also called Kevin being [...] "slowly broken by Packer's cruelty" [...] an effective way to show how terrible Packer was to the morale of the office. He was, however, more critical about the fact that Holly seemed unaware that [...] "Michael <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> judge of whether or not someone is funny". At the end of his review, McNutt reminded readers that The A.V. Club specifically selected him as their new reviewer for the show because he did not know Gillette, thus avoiding a conflict of interest.|$|E
500|$|The A.V. Club critic Hayden Childs {{was more}} negative, giving the episode a C− rating and criticizing the two plots {{and the lack}} of good jokes. He wrote that while there was [...] "some comic potential" [...] in the premise, the writers failed to deliver funny material. Commenting on the plot with Homer and Roz, Childs {{explained}} that [...] "there’s some comic possibility and resonance in having Homer stabbed in the back at work. Many people have been stabbed in the back by an ambitious colleague. Unfortunately, Homer <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> character to give this sort of storyline a heart. Homer is a bad employee who deserves to be ratted out by his subordinate. The fact that she is selfish and mean doesn’t add to this story. Yes, that is {{the sort of person who}} would stab someone in the back for their own gain, but yes, Homer also had it coming. Where is the joke?" ...|$|E

500|$|The episode {{originally}} {{aired on}} the Fox {{network in the}} United States on November 23, 2003, and on January 9, 2004 in the United Kingdom on Sky One. IGN.com named the episode {{the best of the}} fifteenth season, saying that [...] "It <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> episode ever, but hell if it isn't a lot of fun", as well as calling it [...] "extremely funny" [...] and a [...] "high point for the past few seasons". Tony Blair received criticism from a number of commentators for his appearance in the episode {{due to the fact that}} he recorded his part at the height of the war in Iraq. Sunday Telegraph journalist Jack Roberts noted that it was [...] "not [...] finest hour". On the other hand, Simon Crerar of The Times named Blair's appearance as one of the 33 best guest appearances in the show's history, and the BBC classified his appearance as a [...] "PR masterstroke". The episode is included on the Around the World in 80 D'ohs DVD.|$|E
500|$|James Poniewozik of Time observed, [...] "NBC's public {{troubles}} {{have been}} 30 Rocks greatest blessing this season, providing it with satiric fodder from The Jay Leno Show to the Comcast acquisition. The show <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> sitcom on TV now, but it's definitely {{the best work}} of NBC-criticism." [...] In regards to the main plot, he said it [...] "could have done even more with {{the premise of the}} Jaypocalypse re-enacted with janitors, but it gets {{a lot of credit for}} the inspired idea." [...] IGN contributor Robert Canning gave the episode an 8.3 out of 10 rating, writing that the janitor plot [...] "came at a perfect time" [...] in regards to the Leno and O'Brien controversy. He, however, did not like the other two plots, noting they were [...] "less impressive". Meredith Blake from the Los Angeles Times said that the Khonani and Subhas plot was [...] "supremely clever and self-referential", and that the show's take on it was [...] "decidedly neutral, albeit very funny".|$|E

[...] Pitchfork reviewer Grayson Currin remarked that [...] "Life Is People and the tale that accompany it are strong enough...to at last make [...] reputation among many match his legacy among few", saying that [...] "at the risk of overstating the case, Life Is People—the work of a 69-year-old family man, {{and the work of}} a lifetime—confirms its maker's own thesis." [...] Critic Maria Schurr of PopMatters wrote that [...] "one half of Fay's Life Is People proves worthy of such a long wait...those who Life Is People touches are unlikely to hear a more inspiring album this year." [...] Prefix magazine's Matthew Fiander stated that while it [...] "does have its missteps...Life is People <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> Bill Fay, but hearing this {{there is no doubt about}} one thing: it's great to have him back. And hopefully this record is just the start of that return." ...|$|E

2500|$|Many green {{building}} certification {{programs do not}} require a building to have net zero energy use, only to reduce energy use a few percentage points below the minimum required by law.

2500|$|In 1956, Gómez and Galvan studied factors {{associated}} with death {{in a group of}} malnourished (undernourished) children in a hospital in Mexico City, Mexico and defined categories of malnutrition: first, second, and third degree. The degrees were based on weight below a specified percentage of median weight for age. The risk of death increases with increasing degree of malnutrition. An adaptation of Gomez's original classification is still used today. While it provides a way to compare malnutrition within and between populations, the classification has been criticized for being [...] "arbitrary" [...] and for not considering overweight as a form of malnutrition. Also, height alone <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> indicator of malnutrition; children who are born prematurely may be considered short for their age even if they have good nutrition.|$|E
2500|$|Matt Risley of Total Film {{gave the}} film 5 stars and wrote: [...] "Sumptuously shot, {{perfectly}} paced and flat-out exhilarating, The Raid 2 cements Evans {{as the best}} action director working today and <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> action, gangster, or even martial-arts movie ever made. But as {{a combination of all}} three, it's unparalleled in recent memory and offers a tantalising glimpse into a post-Bayhem action-movie world. Brutal, beautiful and brilliant" [...] and also wrote, [...] "The sheer imagination on show, both in the cinematography and choreography, guarantees each brawl is instantly iconic. Immaculately edited, each traumatic, tensely tactile fight would blur into chaos if not for Evans's pinpoint pacing something that refreshes all the more in the face of modern blockbusting's tendency to start big and just keep getting bigger, until burnout." ...|$|E
2500|$|While Bill Naito's {{business}} ventures were often financially risky, {{it was clear}} that the potential for profit was not his primary motive, or at least not his only motive. [...] He was widely recognized for taking on ventures that were at least as beneficial to the community as they were potentially moneymaking. When asked about his own salary by The Oregonian in 1985, he replied, [...] "I'm a little crazy. My pay <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> in town, but I offer good economic advice. My objective is not to make a pile of money. That's one objective, but another is satisfaction." [...] In the early 1980s he built the 300-unit McCormick Pier Apartments along the Willamette River waterfront, just north of Old Town, replacing a derelict warehouse district and providing needed middle-income housing in an area where other developers had concluded it could not succeed. [...] He lobbied in favor of a proposal for historic Union Station to be acquired by the city (and thereby preserved), which came to fruition in 1987.|$|E

2500|$|Gameplay was {{compared}} by several critics to , while the weapon system was likened to Vagrant Story. GameSpot's Shane Satterfield and IGN's David Zdyrko both felt the Georama mode borrowed elements from ActRaiser. GameSpot, IGN and Game Informers Andrew Reiner all praised {{the game for}} blending different types of gameplay together successfully. Satterfield argued [...] "no game has blended all these compelling and unrelated ideas together into one highly addictive and surprisingly cohesive experience until now." [...] Zdyrko called the game [...] "a highly-enjoyable and insanely addictive role-playing experience that wouldn't {{have been able to}} stand alone with just its story, just its battle system, or any single one of its gameplay elements. The game works because each element aids in the enjoyment of the other parts." [...] Reiner wrote [...] "The overall design <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>best,</b> yet you'll be completely engrossed with Dark Clouds play. Completists [...] will want to obtain every item and weapon. Action fans will drool over the combat. Sim junkies will admire the town building.

This continues that tradition, with kind of a nod to the dance music of the '80s." [...] Virgin Records' president Roy Cooper stated, [...] "The new album is very bright, it's very upbeat and dynamic. She wanted to make an album that was rhythmically strong as well as melodically strong. She also wanted as explosive and strong a start as possible, and this certainly qualifies."

2500|$|In {{their book}} Hate Crimes: Criminal Law and Identity Politics, James B. Jacobs and Kimberly Potter criticize hate crime {{legislation}} for exacerbating conflicts between groups. [...] They assert that by defining crimes as being committed by one group against another, {{rather than as}} being committed by individuals against their society, the labeling of crimes as [...] "hate crimes" [...] causes groups to feel persecuted by one another, and that this impression of persecution can incite a backlash and thus lead to an actual increase in crime. Some have argued hate crime laws bring the law into disrepute and further divide society, as groups apply to have their critics silenced. Some have argued that {{if it is true}} that all violent crimes are the result of the perpetrator's contempt for the victim, then all crimes are hate crimes. Thus, if there is no alternate rationale for prosecuting some people more harshly for the same crime based on who the victim is, then different defendants are treated unequally under the law, which violates the United States Constitution. American forensic psychologist Karen Franklin said that the term hate crime is somewhat misleading since it assumes there is a hateful motivation which is not present in many occasions; in her view, laws to punish people who commit hate crimes <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> remedy for preventing them because the threat of future punishment does not usually deter such criminal acts. [...] Some on the political left have been critical of hate crime laws for expanding the criminal justice system and dealing with violence against minority groups through punitive measures.|$|E
