The new supports present bulk densities between 0. 88 and 1. 15 g cm(- 3) <b>moisture</b> <b>retention</b> <b>capacities</b> close to 50 % and 70 %, and water cohesion capacities greater than six months for the material with 20 % binder.

The biodegradation of different substrates (sodium sulfide and ammonia) and the support colonization by the biomass were evaluated. Finally, UP 20 was chosen and tested in a hydrogen sulfide or ammoniac biofiltration process. This showed that, for H 2 S concentrations greater than 100 mg m(- 3), UP 20 has a real advantage over pine bark or pozzolan. (C) 2067 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

The primary focus of this report is the measurement of <b>moisture</b> <b>retention</b> curves of tuff {{as a function of}} temperature for both drying and re-wetting conditions. This work is a continuation of work described in MOL 80 (UCRL-ID- 119033), Hydrological Property Measurements of Topopah Spring Tuff (Roberts and Lin, 1995). Knowledge of unsaturated transport properties is critical for understanding the movement of water through the unsaturated zone. Evaluation of the performance of a potential nuclear waste repository also depends on these properties. <b>Moisture</b> <b>retention</b> data are important input for models of moisture movement in unsaturated porous media. Also important is the effect of sample history on the <b>moisture</b> <b>retention</b> curves, whether or not a complete saturation cycle at elevated temperature affects the <b>moisture</b> <b>retention</b> curve at subsequent lower temperature cycles. This report addresses initial observations regarding this aspect of the research...|$|R
