Seventy clinical isolates identified as M. avium from human immunodeficiency virus-negative patients with <b>MAC</b> <b>infections</b> were used. MATR-VNTR typing using 15 loci distinguished 56 patterns of different allele profiles, yielding a Hunter-Gaston discriminatory index (HGDI) of 0. 990.

Moreover, concomitant use of the MATR-VNTR method and IS 1245 -RFLP typing increased the HGDI to 0. 999.
