5|$|The term double burden {{arises from}} the fact that many women, as well as some men, are {{responsible}} for both domestic labor and paid labor. However, due to the thinking that a woman's time spent in domestic work is <b>more</b> <b>valuable</b> <b>than</b> a woman's time spent doing paid work, and that a man's time spent doing paid work is <b>more</b> <b>valuable</b> <b>than</b> a man's time spent doing domestic work, there is the issue of women having to do a large amount of both paid and unpaid work, leading to the double burden. Some alternative terms for double burden include : double day, second shift, and double duty.|$|E

Most A318 aircraft retired from airline service have been scrapped due to the engine and components being <b>more</b> <b>valuable</b> <b>than</b> whole aircraft. Frontier Airlines, the launch customer that acquired A318 aircraft between 2003 and 2007, retired their last A318 by 2013.|$|E
5|$|Frank Spedding's Ames Project had {{developed}} the Ames process, {{a method of}} producing uranium metal on an industrial scale, but Cyril Stanley Smith, the CM Division's associate leader in charge of metallurgy, was concerned about using it with highly enriched uranium due to the danger of forming a critical mass. Highly enriched uranium was also far <b>more</b> <b>valuable</b> <b>than</b> natural uranium, {{and he wanted to}} avoid the loss of even a milligram. He recruited Richard D. Baker, a chemist who had worked with Spedding, and together they adapted the Ames Process for use at the Los Alamos laboratory. In February Baker and his group made twenty 360 gram reductions and twenty-seven 500 gram reductions with highly enriched uranium tetrafluoride.|$|E

5|$|Aphilas {{introduced}} {{a number of}} different standards for all three metals, some of which lasted through to the 7th century, while the use of others ended with his reign. His new gold coins (issued in conjunction with the older) of a quarter aureus and eighth aureus were soon abandoned (each are known from only one specimen), and 1/16 aureus coins have been found, though these {{are more likely to be}} deliberate debasements to increase profit (Aksumite gold was generally very pure, however). Aphilas's silver coin, however, issued at half the weight of the former, became the new Aksumite standard for silver up until the end of coinage. The older coin was presumably <b>more</b> <b>valuable</b> <b>than</b> needed, and the new coin remedied the problem. Aphilas's bronze issue, however, was instead doubled to 4.83grams. The coin's rarity may attest to its quick withdrawal from the market, as is assumed with his quarter-aureus. These two issues are the only one of Aphilas's issues to portray him frontally, rather than in profile.|$|E
5|$|Former Idaho Territory Governor {{and former}} U.S. House of Representative Thomas W. Bennett made an {{application}} to the U.S. Army’s Signal Service to establish stations at Boise on February 9, 1876. On May 21, 1877, the application was granted and Sergeant Barnet E. Light was order per S. O. No. 62 to establish a station by July 1877. On June 22, 1877, the station was established {{on the second floor}} of the Overland Hotel on the northwest corner of 8th and Main Street. Weather observations began at the station on July 1st, 1977. The station was moved to a third story addition to the Hotel shortly after Hosea Eastman bought it in 1878. The station was moved twice, next door to the Davis building in September 1880 and the Perrault Building on the southeast corner of Capital and Main Streets in January 1888. The weather instruments were on the roof except for the thermometers which were in a window shelter from 1877 to 1885. The thermometers placed in a Cotton region shelter on December 1, 1885. A lack of funding and Chief Signal Officer Adolphus Greely opening of a new station in Baker City, Oregon lead to the closure of the Boise station on June 30, 1890. Greenly felt the Baker City Station would be <b>more</b> <b>valuable</b> <b>than</b> the Boise station which was not supported by his forecasters in Washington. Barnet Light, James Kenealy, Henry Boynton and William Korts were the only four observers during the stations 13 years in Boise.|$|E
5|$|The {{meeting on}} 17 January was crowded. Many {{attendees}} were not electors, as franchise {{was attached to}} land ownership in excess of £50, or yearly rental over £10, and the resulting roll was only about 160 names long, including absentee owners in England. There had been rumours beforehand that somebody would come forward to oppose Sewell. William Thomson was elected to chair the meeting. Sewell spoke at length about various issues: {{that he should be}} elected because of the service that he had given Canterbury as their representative when in financial crisis, that he even delayed his departure to England to resolve the issues, that he had no conflict of interest with the steam ship company that provided New Zealand's postal service with England, {{that he did not have}} land holdings in the North Island <b>more</b> <b>valuable</b> <b>than</b> holdings in Canterbury, that he gave qualified support to the Lyttelton Rail Tunnel project and he gave his reasons for leaving the Stafford Ministry so soon after his return to the colony last year. He disagreed with Stafford's government on some issues. The two most important disagreements were land policy, where Sewell wanted the land revenue to be retained by the provincial governments, rather than the southern provinces pay a high proportion of their revenue to enable purchase of land in the north, and native policy, where Sewell predicted that the land policy being pursued would result in strong conflict with Māori; in fact, the First Taranaki War started in March 1860. As a solution, Sewell suggested the possible separation of the North Island and the South Island into separate countries; this was the first time, as far as the editor of the Lyttelton Times was aware, that such a suggestion had been made in public by a politician. The politician who is today known to have favoured separation is Julius Vogel, and he started campaigning for this idea in 1862. The Lyttelton Times argued, against the objection of many, that such an idea had merit for further consideration.|$|E

25|$|Currency had not {{yet been}} invented, so Assyrian merchants used gold for {{wholesale}} trade and silver for retail trade during this time. Gold was considered eight times <b>more</b> <b>valuable</b> <b>than</b> silver. But there was one more metal, amutum, which was even <b>more</b> <b>valuable</b> <b>than</b> gold. Amutum is thought to be the newly discovered iron and was forty times <b>more</b> <b>valuable</b> <b>than</b> silver. The most important Anatolian export was copper, and the Assyrian merchants sold tin and clothing to Anatolia.|$|E
