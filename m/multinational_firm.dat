The interplay of these three forces determines whether {{national or}} <b>multinational</b> <b>firms</b> produce more, depending on such parameters as the potential environmental damages, transportation costs {{and the influence of}} the firm.

The paper assumes that the foreign plants of <b>multinational</b> <b>firms</b> face higher communication costs with headquarters than their domestic plants, and shows that <b>multinational</b> <b>firms</b> therefore systematically assign more knowledge to both their foreign and domestic plants than non-multinationals. This helps explain why <b>multinational</b> <b>firms</b> pay higher wages to their production workers than non-multinational firms, and why their sales and their investment probability decrease across space.
