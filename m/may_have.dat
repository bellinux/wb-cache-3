5|$|Many {{meanings}} {{have been}} suggested for the advent and nature of prehistoric art. It <b>may</b> <b>have</b> helped develop human solidarity in its early stages. Open air rock art <b>may</b> <b>have</b> acted as signposts for the route of animal migrations. Cave art <b>may</b> <b>have</b> had a ritual role in rites of initiation, vision quests or totemic ceremonies. Portable objects <b>may</b> <b>have</b> acted as notation systems and anthropomorphic figures <b>may</b> <b>have</b> {{had a role in}} religious rituals. However, most artifacts can only be understood in their context, which is often lost or poorly understood.|$|E
5|$|A Scout Group {{consists}} {{of one or}} more units for different age groups: a Cub Pack, a Scout Troop, and less commonly a Rover Crew. Large Groups <b>may</b> <b>have</b> more than one of each section, or <b>may</b> <b>have</b> separate units for boys and girls. Rover Crews can also be associated with a Region or District.|$|E

5|$|According to Simon Goldhill, the {{evidence}} is fundamentally inconclusive. Goldhill writes that the theatre {{can be seen as}} a social and political event analogous with the Assembly and the courtroom, and women <b>may</b> <b>have</b> been excluded. David Kawalko Roselli writes that although Goldhill's perspective is valuable, he does not sufficiently consider the theatre's ritual purpose. If women did attend the theatre, they <b>may</b> <b>have</b> sat separately from the men.|$|E

5|$|After its {{discovery}} in 1897, {{it has never}} been recorded again and it is now considered extinct; the presence of introduced black rats on María Madre <b>may</b> <b>have</b> contributed to its extinction. Oryzomys nelsoni was a large species, distinguished in particular by its long tail, robust skull, and large incisors. It was reddish to yellowish above and mostly white below. Its diet <b>may</b> <b>have</b> included plant material and small animals.|$|E
5|$|Alternatively, the {{ancestor}} of Oryzomys peninsulae <b>may</b> <b>have</b> arrived by rafting {{during the late}} Miocene, about six million years ago, when {{the southern tip of}} the Baja California peninsula was an island located near what is now Nayarit and Jalisco in western Mexico. Some plants and birds from the area <b>may</b> <b>have</b> a similar biogeographic heritage.|$|E

5|$|Although the Brut y Tywysogion (The Chronicle of the Princes), a Latin {{chronicle of}} events, which survives in Welsh translations, <b>may</b> <b>have</b> been written at Strata Florida Abbey, it <b>may</b> <b>have</b> been kept in Llanbadarn in the {{eleventh}} century, due to Llanbadarn’s scriptorium and {{its reputation as}} a centre of learning.|$|E
5|$|Amenemhat <b>may</b> <b>have</b> died {{without a}} male heir, which {{could explain why}} he was succeeded by Sobekneferu. However, some egyptologists, such as Aidan Dodson and Kim Ryholt, have {{proposed}} that the first two rulers of the 13th Dynasty, Sobekhotep I and Amenemhat Sonbef, were his sons. Amenenmhat IV <b>may</b> <b>have</b> been Sobeknefru's spouse, but no evidence currently substantiates this hypothesis.|$|E

5|$|Archibald {{and colleagues}} {{suggested}} the life habits of extinct Myrmeciinae ants including Prionomyrmex <b>may</b> <b>have</b> been similar to extant ants within the subfamily. These ants foraged {{on the ground}} and possibly onto trees and low vegetation while preying on arthropods. These ants <b>may</b> <b>have</b> collected plant nectar, as Myrmecia species use this as a food source. Workers <b>may</b> <b>have</b> not recruited nest mates to food sources or lay down pheromone trails, as these ants were solitary hunters. Workers would have relied on their vision to hunt for prey and help themselves navigate.|$|E

5|$|As deduced {{from the}} {{presence}} of freshwater molluscs, Lake Cahuilla was a freshwater lake during its highstand, while lower lake level stages show fossil evidence of increased salinity.

5|$|As initial {{cause for}} glacier retreat {{in the alps}} since 1850, a {{decrease}} of the glaciers albedo, caused by industrial black carbon can be identified.
