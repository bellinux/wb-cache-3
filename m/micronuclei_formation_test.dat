Here a possible relationship between a disturbance in cell cycle progression and micronucleus fonnation is investigated by exposing Syrian hamster embryo (SHE) cells to DES. Continuous bromodeoxyuridine labeling followed by bivariate Hoechst 33258 /ethidium bromide flow cytometry was employed for analysis of cell cycle transit and related to the time course of <b>micronucleus</b> <b>formation.</b> Treatment of SHE cells with DES resulted in delayed and impaired cell activation (exit from the GO/G 1 phase), impaired S-phase transit and, mainly, G 2 -phase traverse. Cells forming micronuclei, on the other hand, were predominantly in G 2 phase during DES treatment. These results suggest that impairment of Sand G 2 transit may involve a process ultimately leading to <b>micronucleus</b> <b>formation...</b>|$|R

FISH allowed us to observe chromosome nondisjunction and <b>micronucleus</b> <b>formation</b> in binucleate cells, using DNA probes specific to B chromosomes (B's), knobbed chromosomes, and the chromosome 6 (NOR) of maize. All chromosome types seem {{to be involved in}} <b>micronucleus</b> <b>formation,</b> but the B's form more micronuclei than do knobbed chromosomes and knobbed chromosomes form more than do chromosomes without knobs. Micronuclei were more frequent in 1 B plants and in a genotype selected for low B transmission rate. Nondisjunction was observed in all types of FISH-labeled chromosomes. In addition, unlabeled bridges and delayed chromatids were observed in the last telophase before binucleate cell formation, suggesting that nondisjunction might occur in all chromosomes of the maize complement. B nondisjunction is known to occur in the second pollen mitosis and in the endosperm, but it was not previously reported in other tissues. This is also a new report of nondisjunction of chromosomes of the normal set (A's) in tapetal cells.

Sixty female Sprague–Dawley rats were distributed over six groups (control group and the exposure groups with whole-body exposure for 2 h/day, 7 days/week for 15, 30 and 60 continuous days). The study investigated the oxidative stress, 8 -hydroxy- 2 -deoxyguanosine enzyme, <b>micronuclei</b> <b>formation</b> and histopathological changes in ovarian tissue.

In the present work, the CHO-k 1 micronucleus assay in combination with cellular imaging was further evaluated. Firstly, {{the effect of a}} range of S 9 concentrations on <b>micronucleus</b> <b>formation</b> and cytotoxicity was investigated. Subsequently, the reproducibility and predictivity of the micronucleus assay on CHO-k 1 cells was investigated with a set of four compounds. Then, a larger set of compounds (n= 44) was tested on CHO-k 1 cells and inter-laboratory correlation was calculated. Finally, cellular imaging was compared with flow cytometry for in vivo assessment of <b>micronucleus</b> <b>formation.</b> The concentration of S 9 {{had a significant impact on}} <b>micronucleus</b> <b>formation</b> and cytotoxicity. In addition, calculations of relative cell count (RCC) and cytokinesis-block proliferation index (CBPI) showed to be complementary to cytotoxicity assessment. The CHO-k 1 micronucleus assay correctly classified the four reference compounds, with a dose-response relationship and low variability. Based on a larger set of compounds, the assay proved to be reliable with a sensitivity of 94 % (n = 31) and a specificity of 85 % (n = 13). A correlation coefficient of 97 % was obtained when the lowest observable adverse effect levels (LOAELs) from our study were compared with those published by Diaz et al. (2007) [10]. In conclusion, the in vitro CHO-k 1 micronucleus assay combined with cellular imaging is a predictive assay appropriate for genotoxicity screening at early stages of drug development. In addition, for in vivo assessment of <b>micronucleus</b> <b>formation,</b> we preferred to use flow cytometry rather than cell imaging. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Background: As {{time goes}} by, {{there is a}} {{significant}} increase on number of vehicle, particularly motorcycle. This condition results on higher vehicle emission released on air. Motorcycle emission produced from imperfect engine combustion contains dangerous substances that may harm genes configuration on human bodies, such as lead and polyaromatic hydrocarbon. Those substances are called genotoxic substances. A person whose occupation is connected with vehicle gas {{is more likely to be}} exposed with the emission than the one who is not on the vehicle-related occupation. Emission inhaled regularly would accumulate on nasal and mouth cavities of the exposed person. The accumulation of genotoxic substances could damage the cell nuclei. Nucleus damage could manifest as micronucleus, or additional nucleus in smaller size than the original nucleus. The effect of motorcycle emission to the frequency of <b>micronucleus</b> <b>formation</b> needs to be found as this would give rise to cancer prevalence, particularly on mouth cavity. Aim: To understand the effect of exposure on motorcycle emission to the increase of <b>micronucleus</b> <b>formation</b> frequency in mouth cavity on the motorcycle mechanics. Method: This research was conducted using cross-sectional study with primary data, which is the mucosal swab of mouth cavity. The case group was motorcycle mechanics, while the control group was citizen of Jogjakarta, with 35 samples for each group.

40|$|Carbon {{nanotubes}} (CNT) {{are one of}} {{the most}} promising engineered nanomaterials. CNT are tubular fiber shaped engineered graphites and produced in two common types: single wall carbon nanotube (SWCNT) and multi wall carbon nanotube (MWCNT). Unfortunately, their unique properties, making CNT valuable in a large number of applications, can be problematic for their potential toxicity. Moreover, CNT share some physic-chemical properties with asbestos, a known carcinogen fiber if inhaled. In the current presentation, the genotoxicity of CNT in vitro will be discussed along with specific consideration concerning the validity of the FpG comet assay in CNT exposure. We have exposed MWCNT and SWCNT in human bronchial epithelial cell line (16 HBE) and in human monocytic cell line (THP- 1). FpG comet assay and micronucleus assay were performed in order to determine oxidative DNA strand breaks and aberrant <b>micronuclei</b> <b>formation</b> induced by CNTs. CNT can induce strand breaks and oxidative DNA damage. Both types of CNT induced a significant increase in % Tail DNA and Tail Moment in both cell types, whether or not in the presence of FpG. The <b>micronuclei</b> <b>formation</b> in the presence of cytochalasin B was apparent in all exposed 16 HBE cultures, but not in THP- 1 cultures. Without cytochalasin B, only MWCNT exposed 16 HBE cells and the highest dose of SWCNT in THP- 1 showed a significant increase in micronuclei. In conclusion we have observed both DNA damage and aberrant <b>micronuclei</b> <b>formation</b> in 16 HBE cells. In THP- 1 cells, although oxidative DNA damage and strand breaks occurred, aberrant <b>micronuclei</b> <b>formation</b> occurred in less extent.

A threshold and an optimum adapting dose were observed. This adaptive response (AR) at the survival level {{was accompanied by a}} decreased number of chromosomal breaks due to the challenge dose, as indicated by a reduction in the frequency of <b>micronucleus</b> <b>formation.</b> The frequency of <b>micronucleus</b> <b>formation</b> was further reduced when an incubation period at 37 ∘C separated the challenge dose and the adapting dose delivered at either low- or high-dose-rate. The rate of reduction of <b>micronucleus</b> <b>formation</b> was higher for the low dose-rate as compared to the high dose-rate adapting dose, suggesting that the ability of human cells to adapt to radiation increases with decreasing rates of damage. A certain amount of damage per unit time with which the cell can cope appears to be necessary to trigger the AR to IR. The rate of repair of DNA double-strand breaks, as indicated by the frequency of <b>micronucleus</b> <b>formation,</b> was higher in adapted cells, suggesting that the mechanism of adaptation could include increased repair capacity and/or an increased ease of access of repair enzymes to the lesion. Adapted cells also showed a much longer delay in reaching the binucleate state than non-adapted cells, suggesting a second mechanism of adaptation which may increase the time available for DNA repair. The analysis of RNA from adapted cells showed a decreased level of cyclin A and cyclin B transcripts consistent with a mechanism leading to a delay in the progression of the cells in the cell cycle. The transcript levels of other genes possibly involved in the cellular response to IR were also altered. Rodent C 3 H 10 T 12 cells showed a similar adaptation when assayed for <b>micronucleus</b> <b>formation.</b> The adapted cells were also protected against transformation to malignancy by a subsequent high dose of radiation. Transformation frequency was reduced about two-fold by low-dose-rate adapting doses ranging from 0. 1 to 1. 5 Gy.

We investigated the occurrence of mitotic disturbances induced by asbestos (amosite, crocidolite, chrysotile) in an in vitro approach using Syrian hamster embryo (SHE) fibroblast cells. The following endpoints were investigated: <b>micronucleus</b> <b>formation</b> {{as a result of}} mitotic disturbances and characterization of the induced micronucleus population by kinetochore staining and visualization of the spindle apparatus. Supravital UV-microscopy was used to analyze changes in interphase chromatin structure, impaired chromatid separation, and blocked cytokinesis. All three asbestos fiber types induced a high frequency of <b>micronucleus</b> <b>formation</b> in SHE cells (> 200 / 2000 cells) in a dose-dependent manner (0. 1 - 5. 0 micrograms/cm 2), with a maximum between 48 hr and 66 hr exposure time.

Kinetochore staining of micronuclei revealed that 48 +/- 2 % of asbestos-induced micronuclei reacted positively with CREST (antikinetochore) serum.

40|$|To whom {{correspondence}} {{should be}} addressed Unrepaired or misrepaired radiation damage in mamma-lian chromosomes can result in <b>micronucleus</b> <b>formation</b> at the first cell division. This represents loss of genomic information which may cause cell death. To improve {{our understanding of the}} mechanism of radiation-induced <b>micronucleus</b> <b>formation,</b> we characterized <b>micronucleus</b> ultrastructure and identified the origin of micronucleus DNA. Immunofluorescence microscopy showed that micronuclei were structurally similar to main nuclei since they contained nuclear lamins A and C and were encapsul-ated by a network of vimentin intermediate filaments. The contents of radiation-induced micronuclei were character-ized using fluorescence in situ hybridization to probe for DNA originating from chromosomes 2, 7, 11 and 16. We postulated that if incorporation of DNA into micronuclei were random, then the probability of chromosomal DNA in micronuclei would be related to the target, i. e. chromo-some size. Our results demonstrated that incorporation of DNA from smaller chromosomes (11 and 16) was not different from expected values but incorporation of DNA from the larger chromosomes (2 and 7) was significantly greater than expected. Not all chromosomes in the human genome, therefore, were equally susceptible to genomic loss by micronucleus encapsulation. In conclusion, radiation-induced micronuclei have similar structural characteristics to main nuclei, chromosome damage and/or repair after ionizing radiation may be non-random, and <b>micronucleus</b> <b>formation</b> may reflect this variability...|$|R

40|$|Folic acid plays a {{critical}} role in the prevention of chromosome breakage and hypomethylation of DNA. This activity is compromised when Vitamin B 12 (B 12) concentration is low because methionine synthase activity is reduced, lowering the concentration of S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) which in turn may diminish DNA methylation and cause folate to become unavailable for the conversion of dUMP to dTMP. The most plausible explanation for the chromosome-breaking effect of low folate is excessive uracil misincorporation into DNA, a mutagenic lesion that leads to strand breaks in DNA during repair. Both in vitro and in vivo studies with human cells clearly show that folate deficiency causes expression of chromosomal fragile sites, chromosome breaks, excessive uracil in DNA, <b>micronucleus</b> <b>formation</b> and DNA hypomethylation. In vivo studies show that Vitamin B 12 deficiency and elevated plasma homocysteine are significantly correlated with increased <b>micronucleus</b> <b>formation.</b> In vitro experiments indicate that genomic instability in human cells is minimised when folic acid concentration in culture medium is > 227 nmol/l. Intervention studies in humans show: (a) that DNA hypomethylation, chromosome breaks, uracil misincorporation and <b>micronucleus</b> <b>formation</b> are minimised when red cell folate concentration is > 700 nmol/l folate; and (b) <b>micronucleus</b> <b>formation</b> is minimised when plasma concentration of Vitamin B 12 is > 300 pmol/l and plasma homocysteine is < 7. 5 micromol/l. These concentrations are achievable at intake levels in excess of current RDIs i. e. more than 200 - 400 microgram folic acid per day and more than 2 microgram Vitamin B 12 per day. A placebo-controlled study with a dose-response suggests that based on the micronucleus index in lymphocytes, an RDI level of 700 microgram/day for folic acid and 7 microgram/day for Vitamin B 12 would be appropriate for genomic stability in young adults. Dietary intakes above the current RDI may be particularly important in those with extreme defects in the absorption and metabolism of these Vitamins, for which ageing is a contributing factor...|$|R

Following co-treatment with either 10 – 9 M ß-oestradiol, 10 – 8 M oestrone or 10 – 8 M oestriol, 2 - to 3 -fold increases in micronuclei were observed with 10 – 8 M B[a]P. When MCF- 7 cells were pre-incubated for 96 h with 10 – 9 M ß-oestradiol, 10 – 8 M oestrone or 10 – 8 M oestriol prior to the addition of B[a]P for 24 h, up to a 5 -fold enhanced sensitivity to <b>micronucleus</b> <b>formation</b> was observed with ß-oestradiol and oestrone, while oestriol appeared to reduce levels of <b>micronucleus</b> <b>formation.</b> B[a]P-induced decreases in cell proliferation (per cent binucleate cells) and plating efficiency were reversed by all three oestrogens. Analysis of cell cycle distributions revealed that treatment with oestrogens or B[a]P alone did not induce marked effects on cell cycle distributions. However, in combination oestrogen and B[a]P induced increases in G 0 /G 1, decreases in S phase and increases in G 2 /M. This work suggests that whilst oestrogens appear to enhance carcinogen-induced DNA damage, they also appear, paradoxically, to trigger mechanisms that facilitate clonogenic survival, which may be relevant to breast cancer initiation...|$|R
40|$|The cytokinesis-block {{micronucleus}} (CBMN) assay {{was originally}} developed {{as an ideal}} system for measuring micronuclei (MNi) however {{it can also be}} used to measure nucleoplasmic bridges (NPBs), nuclear buds (NBUDs), cell death (necrosis or apoptosis) and nuclear division rate. Current evidence suggests that (a) NPBs originate from dicentric chromosomes in which the centromeres have been pulled to the opposite poles of the cell at anaphase and are therefore indicative of DNA mis-repair, chromosome rearrangement or telomere end-fusions, (b) NPBs may break to form MNi, (c) the nuclear budding process is the mechanism by which cells remove amplified and/or excess DNA and is therefore a marker of gene amplification and/or altered gene dosage, (d) cell cycle checkpoint defects result in <b>micronucleus</b> <b>formation</b> and (e) hypomethylation of DNA, induced nutritionally or by inhibition of DNA methyl transferase can lead to <b>micronucleus</b> <b>formation</b> either via chromosome loss or chromosome breakage. The strong correlation between <b>micronucleus</b> <b>formation,</b> nuclear budding and NPBs (r= 0. 75 - 0. 77, P< 0. 001) induced by either folic acid deficiency or exposure to ionising radiation is supportive of the hypothesis that folic acid deficiency and/or ionising radiation cause genomic instability and gene amplification by the initiation of breakage-fusion-bridge cycles. In its comprehensive mode, the CBMN assay measures all cells including necrotic and apoptotic cells as well as number of nuclei per cell to provide a measure of cytotoxicity and mitotic activity. The CBMN assay has in fact evolved into a "cytome" method for measuring comprehensively chromosomal instability phenotype and altered cellular viability caused by genetic defects and/or nutrional deficiencies and/or exogenous genotoxins thus opening up an exciting future for the use of this methodology in the emerging fields of nutrigenomics and toxicogenomics and their combinations...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Kacip Fatimah {{also known}} as Labisia pumila (Myrsinaceae), is a {{traditional}} herbal medicine {{with a long history}} in the Malay community. It has been used by many generations of Malay women to induce and facilitate childbirth as well as a post-partum medicine. We tested the genotoxic potential of Kacip Fatimah in bone marrow cells obtained from Sprague-Dawley rats using <b>micronuclei</b> <b>formation</b> as the toxicological endpoints. Five groups of five male rats each were administered orally for two consecutive days with doses of 100, 700 and 2000 mg/kg body weight of Kacip Fatimah extract dissolved in distilled water. Micronucleus preparation was obtained from bone marrow cells of the animals following standard protocols. No statistically significant increase in micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes (MNPCEs) was observed at any dose level and sacrifice/harvest time point (24, 48 and 72 h). However, a significant decrease in polychromatic erythrocytes/normochromatic erythrocytes (PCE:NCE) ratio was observed from the highest dose level (2000 mg/kg of body weight) at 48 h harvest time point. In this study, we investigated the effect of Kacip Fatimah on mammalian bone marrow cells using <b>micronuclei</b> <b>formation</b> to assess the genotoxicity of the herb...|$|R
40|$|Silver {{nanoparticles}} (Ag NPs) {{are one of}} {{the most}} common nanomaterials (NM) present in nanotechnology-based products. In this work, the physical chemical properties of Ag NPs suspensions of 44 nm, 84 nm and 100 nm sizes and synthesized in our laboratory were characterized. The NM- 300 material (average size of 17 nm), supplied by the Joint Research Centre Nanomaterials Repository was also included in the present study. In addition, their potential cytotoxicity was tested on Balb 3 T 3 cell line by the Colony Forming efficiency, while their carcinogenic potential and genotoxicity were tested by the assessment of morphological transformation induction and <b>micronuclei</b> <b>formation</b> respectively. After 24 h of exposure, NM- 300 showed cytotoxicity with an IC 50 of 8 µM while for the other NM tested, values of IC 50 were higher than 10 µM. After 72 h of exposure, Ag NPs showed size-dependent cytotoxic effect with IC 50 values of 1. 5 µM (NM- 300), 1. 7 µM (Ag 44 nm), 1. 9 µM (Ag 84 nm) and 3. 2 µM (Ag 100 nm). None of the Ag NPs tested was able to induce either morphological transformation or <b>micronuclei</b> <b>formation.</b> JRC. I. 4 -Nanobioscience...|$|R
