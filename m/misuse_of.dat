40|$|AbstractThe {{present study}} was {{conducted}} to investigate the <b>misuses</b> <b>of</b> two main categories of metadiscourse markers used by a group of university students. To this end, 50 EFL learners of intermediate language proficiency level were chosen by means of administering a TOEFL proficiency test. The participants were female junior students majoring in English literature at Kerman Azad University. These learners were regarded as intermediate ones scoring 400 - 550 in the proficiency test. Then, the learners were provided with an argumentative topic to write a 250 -word essay in 45 minutes. The number <b>of</b> <b>misuses</b> <b>of</b> metadiscourse markers were counted with regard to their use of textual and interpersonal markers of this kind, and the subcategories of textual (logical connectives, frame markers, endophoric markers, evidentials, and code glosses), and the subcategories of interpersonal metadiscourse markers (hedges, emphatics, attitude markers, relational markers, and person markers). Moreover, different classifications <b>of</b> <b>misuses</b> were explored. The results of Chi-square analysis indicated that <b>misuses</b> <b>of</b> metadiscourse makers can be due to overuse of these markers (e. g. logical connective and person markers), punctuation,interlingua, and intralinguaerrors. Finally, using a Pearson correlation to investigate the correlation between the participants’ TOEFL score and essay score, it was concluded that language proficiency has a positive relationship with the uses of metadiscourse markers and essays quality...|$|R

5|$|Mitchell and Galle were {{terminated}} from WCMH in June 2009. A {{few days}} later, both nurses were arrested.

5|$|Nonpolar {{antioxidants}} such as eugenol—a {{major component}} of oil of cloves—have toxicity limits that can be exceeded with the <b>misuse</b> <b>of</b> undiluted essential oils. Toxicity associated with high doses of water-soluble antioxidants such as ascorbic acid are less of a concern, as these compounds can be excreted rapidly in urine. More seriously, very high doses of some antioxidants may have harmful long-term effects. The beta-carotene and Retinol Efficacy Trial (CARET) study of lung cancer patients found that smokers given supplements containing beta-carotene and vitamin A had increased rates of lung cancer. Subsequent studies confirmed these adverse effects.|$|E
