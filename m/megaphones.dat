5|$|Following {{the sudden}} {{shift in the}} {{projected}} track, {{a state of emergency}} was declared on September14 in La Paz, Los Cabos, Comondú, Loreto and Mulegé. In Cabo San Lucas, 2,100marine workers were set up to start evacuations. In La Paz, classes were suspended. Throughout the peninsula, 164shelters were opened capable of harboring 30,000people, but only 3,500persons used these shelters. At the time of landfall, hotels in the state were at 46%of capacity, equal to 30,000tourists, 26,000of whom were foreigners. The ports of La Paz, Los Cabos, San José del Cabo, and Loreto were closed. Around 800marine officers were placed on standby. Police with <b>megaphones</b> walked through vulnerable areas in Cabo San Lucas urging people to evacuate.|$|E

50|$|Studies {{carried out}} in the 1960s {{demonstrated}} that an alcoholic extract of the ground root of Aniba megaphylla inhibited, in vitro, growth of cells derived from human carcinoma of the nasopharynx. In 1978, the active components of the extract were isolated using silica gel chromatography, characterized and named as <b>megaphone</b> (C22H30O6, solid), <b>megaphone</b> acetate (C24H32O7, oily liquid) and megaphyllone acetate (C23H28O7, oily liquid). For comparison, <b>megaphone</b> acetate was also produced synthetically by reacting <b>megaphone</b> with acetic anhydride at 50 °C for 6 hours. Stirring an alcoholic solution of <b>megaphone</b> (<b>megaphone</b> acetate), with added palladium catalyst, in hydrogen atmosphere, followed by evaporation of the solvent yields tetrahydromegaphone (tetrahydromegaphone acetate) as an oil. Millimeter-sized crystals of <b>megaphone</b> can be grown from an ether-chloroform solution. They have monoclinic symmetry with space group P21, lattice constants a = 0.8757 nm, b = 1.1942 nm and c = 1.0177 nm and two formula units per unit cell. <b>Megaphone</b> and <b>megaphone</b> acetate molecules are chiral and the reported extraction and synthesis procedures yielded their racemic mixtures. <b>Megaphone</b> acetate was also isolated from the root of Endlicheria dysodantha, another plant of Laurel family, using chromatography of ethanolic solution. It showed inhibitory activity against cells of crown gall tumor and human lung, breast and colon carcinomas.|$|R

25|$|On Mount Echo were {{installed}} <b>megaphones,</b> called “echophones” which visitors {{could use to}} bellow into the back canyons and receive a number of echoes.

The study of the sweet spot has even been used as boy scout projects.|$|E
25|$|Horn {{loudspeakers}} are {{the oldest}} form of loudspeaker system. The use of horns as voice-amplifying <b>megaphones</b> dates {{at least to}} the 17th century, and horns were used in mechanical gramophones as early as 1857. Horn loudspeakers use a shaped waveguide in front of or behind the driver to increase the directivity of the loudspeaker and to transform a small diameter, high pressure condition at the driver cone surface to a large diameter, low pressure condition {{at the mouth of the}} horn. This improves the acoustic—electro/mechanical impedance match between the driver and ambient air, increasing efficiency, and focusing the sound over a narrower area.|$|E
25|$|The main {{advantage}} of horn loudspeakers {{is they are}} more efficient; they can typically produce 10 times (10 dB) more sound power than a cone speaker from a given amplifier output. Therefore horns are widely used in public address systems, <b>megaphones,</b> and sound systems for large venues like theaters, auditoriums, and sports stadiums. Their disadvantage is that their frequency response is more uneven because of resonance peaks, and horns have a cutoff frequency below which their response drops off. To achieve adequate response at bass frequencies horn speakers must be very large and cumbersome, so they are more often used for midrange and high frequencies. The first practical loudspeakers, introduced {{around the turn of}} the 20th century, were horn speakers. Due to the development in recent decades of cone loudspeakers which have a flatter frequency response, and the availability of inexpensive amplifier power, the use of horn speakers in high fidelity audio systems over the last decades has declined.|$|E

25|$|On March 3, a {{confrontation}} broke {{out between the}} student protesters and the police {{when a group of}} female students went to sit in front of the monks who were on hunger strike. The police misinterpreted the move as the students attempting to push through the line and came charging toward the students. The issue was later resolved when student leaders came to calm down the situation. Earlier that day, students negotiated with Bago Region Border and Security Affairs Minister Col. Thet Htun who urged them to halt their march. The students offered a compromise and stated that they would disperse in Yangon if the minister agreed on the eight-point conditions: to march to Tharawaddy, the nearest town; to fly banners and use <b>megaphones</b> after they embarked on vehicles to Yangon; and to have the police forces keep a distance from them. However, they did not receive any response from the minister.|$|E

Nothing came of the proposal, though the two continued to meet; Driberg received from Crowley manuscripts and books that he later sold for sizeable sums. These various extracurricular activities resulted in neglect of his academic work. He failed his final examinations and, in the summer of 1927, he left Oxford without a degree.|$|E

500|$|Known {{for taking}} the stage at early concerts with {{hundreds}} of clothespins attached to his hair and clothes, Haynes would often strip throughout a show until he was down to his underwear, or less, by the end. Other attire included flasher-style trench coats over his nakedness, ridiculously home-styled wigs and cross-dressing; often enjoying a skirt made of an American flag and a large '60s torpedo-style stuffed bra. At other times he would hide condoms full of stage blood in his clothes and repeatedly fall to the floor, appearing to bleed profusely. Some of Haynes' other favorite tricks involved throwing handfuls of photocopied cockroach images into the crowd, rolls and rolls of toilet paper tossed across the audience, as well as filling an inverted cymbal with lighter fluid, setting it (and sometimes his hand) on fire, and repeatedly hitting it with a mallet. As previously mentioned he would sing through almost anything that would alter his voice, including toilet paper rolls and <b>megaphones</b> early on, which eventually evolved into [...] "Gibby's kit", a.k.a. [...] "Gibbytronix," [...] a rack of vocal effects stacked as high as he could reach, before which he would often stand {{for the majority of}} the show in later performances. He also often utilized various foot switches which would be used to activate certain vocal effects, and when thought to be dancing during some performances he would actually be stepping on his various pedals. Adding to the spectacle were Coffey and Nervosa, who played in unison on stand-up drum kits; behind which they would collapse onto the floor and out of eyeshot, to collect their breath and strength before rising just in time to play the next song. Finally, the whole band would often tear apart stuffed animals while on stage, throwing the stuffing through the air, creating a rather disturbing throbbing effect, caused by the stroboscopes that were always on.|$|E

5000|$|A <b>megaphone,</b> speaking-trumpet, bullhorn, or {{loud hailer}} is a portable, usually hand-held, {{cone-shaped}} acoustic horn used to amplify a person’s voice or other sounds and direct it {{in a given}} direction. The sound is introduced into the narrow end of the <b>megaphone,</b> by holding {{it up to the}} face and speaking into it, and the sound waves radiate out the wide end. A <b>megaphone</b> increases the volume of sound by increasing the acoustic impedance seen by the vocal cords, matching the impedance of the vocal cords to the air, so that more sound power is radiated. It also serves to direct the sound waves in the direction the horn is pointing. It somewhat distorts the sound of the voice because the frequency response of the <b>megaphone</b> is greater at higher sound frequencies.|$|R
