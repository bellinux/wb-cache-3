5000|$|Split leather is leather {{created from}} the fibrous {{part of the}} hide left once the top-grain of the rawhide has been {{separated}} from the hide. During the splitting operation, the top-grain and drop split are separated. The drop split can be further split (thickness allowing) into a <b>middle</b> <b>split</b> and a flesh split. In very thick hides, the <b>middle</b> <b>split</b> can be separated into multiple layers until the thickness prevents further splitting. Split leather then has an artificial layer applied {{to the surface of}} the split and is embossed with a leather grain (bycast leather). Splits are also used to create suede. The strongest suedes are usually made from grain splits (that have the grain completely removed) or from the flesh split that has been shaved to the correct thickness. Suede is [...] "fuzzy" [...] on both sides. Manufacturers use a variety of techniques to make suede from full-grain. A reversed suede is a grained leather that has been designed into the leather article with the grain facing away from the visible surface. It is not considered a true suede.|$|E

Side splits are called straddle <b>splits</b> (or <b>middle</b> <b>splits)</b> in dance and yoga, and may be referred to as Chinese splits in martial arts. Other names for side splits are box splits and center splits.|$|R

50|$|Today's Bischoffen was, in the <b>Middle</b> Ages, <b>split</b> {{into the}} two {{municipalities}} of Oberbischoffen and Niederbischoffen (Ober- = Upper; Nieder- = Lower). Oberbischoffen died {{out during the}} Plague and other epidemics and was forsaken. Niederbischoffen was then, in later documents, called simply Bischoffen.

40|$|In long {{distance}} swimming competitions, the optimal pacing strategy {{is not well}} established. The objective {{of this study was}} to characterize the pacing strategy adopted by international level athletes in 800 -m (female) and 1500 -m (male) crawl swimming events. We analyzed the time of each 50 m splits for semi-finalists and finalists athletes of the last three world swimming championships from 2006 to 2010. The data analysis was performed through the statistic method named CHAID (Chi-Squared Automatic Interaction Detection), which is a statistic χ 2 to detect a homogeneity behavior among the variables. The main results found were: for the two events analyzed, the velocity-versus-distance curve was similar to the parabolic pacing strategy (U-shaped), characterized by a significantly faster start (p< 0. 05) than mean velocity for the race, followed by a gradual decline invelocity in the <b>middle</b> <b>splits,</b> when athletes increase the velocity again (p< 0. 05) to produce an end spurt. In conclusion, these findings indicate that this pacing strategy profile can be classified as optimal for the {{long distance}}s wimming events since it was preferentially adopted by international level athletes...|$|R

A CTM cell has pins in the <b>middle</b> which <b>split</b> the over-the-cell routing region into {{top and bottom}} parts. Our router routes nets in both the channel (if needed) and overthe-cell. The router uses a combined constraint graph and tile expansion algorithm. It achieves channelless solutions for the Primary 1 circuit by routing over the cell in three layers. For classical channel routing examples, it achieves solutions at density for Deutsch’s difficult example in two, three, four and five metal layers. It also generates equal or better results compared {{to the best of}} the previous channel routers for all the examples we have tried. ...|$|R

50|$|The {{conflict}} between the Guelphs and Ghibellines began {{as part of the}} secular-papal struggle. Guelf (also spelled Guelph) and Ghibelline, were members of two opposing factions in German and Italian politics during the <b>Middle</b> Ages. The <b>split</b> between the Guelfs, who were sympathetic to the papacy, and the Ghibellines, who were sympathetic to the German (Holy Roman) emperors, contributed to chronic strife within the cities of northern Italy in the 13th and 14th centuries.|$|R
2500|$|In medieval European cities, small natural {{waterways}} {{used for}} carrying off wastewater were eventually covered over and functioned as sewers. London's River Fleet {{is such a}} system. Open drains, or gutters, for waste water run-off ran along the center of some streets. These were known as [...] "kennels" [...] (i.e., canals, channels), and in Paris were sometimes known as “split streets,” as the waste water running along the <b>middle</b> physically <b>split</b> the streets into two halves. The first closed sewer constructed in Paris was designed by Hugues Aubird in 1370 on Monmartre Street, and was 300 meters long. The original purpose of designing and constructing a closed sewer in Paris was less-so for waste management {{as much as it}} was to hold back the stench coming from the odorous waste water.|$|R

50|$|Home to Diocletian's Palace, {{built for}} the Roman emperor in 305 CE, the city was founded as the Greek colony of Aspálathos (Aσπάλαθος) in the 3rd or 2nd century BC. It became a {{prominent}} settlement around 650 CE when it succeeded the ancient capital of the Roman province of Dalmatia, Salona. After the Sack of Salona by the Avars and Slavs, the fortified Palace of Diocletian was settled by the Roman refugees. Split became a Byzantine city, to later gradually drift into the sphere of the Republic of Venice and the Kingdom of Croatia, with the Byzantines retaining nominal suzerainty. For much of the High and Late <b>Middle</b> Ages, <b>Split</b> enjoyed autonomy as a free city, {{caught in the middle}} of a struggle between Venice and the King of Hungary for control over the Dalmatian cities.|$|R

The player moves the character about the bottom area of the screen with a trackball and fires laser shots at a centipede advancing from the top of the screen down through a field of mushrooms.

50|$|The {{skeleton}} of Fenestella colonies consists of stiff branches that are interconnected by narrower crossbars (or dissepiments). Between two and eight individuals {{of the colony}} inhabit each of the opposing front sides of the approximately rectangular openings between the branches (or fenestule) in one row, and the void they left when they died can be recognized as two rows of small rimmed pores (or apertures) {{on the front of}} each branch. In well-preserved specimens these are closed by centrally perforated lids. In Fenestella, the front of the branches may carry small nodes in a row in the <b>middle.</b> Branches <b>split</b> (or bifurcate) from time to time giving the colonies a fan-shaped appearance. The internal structure of the branches is of decisive importance in the assignment of specimens to genera and species, which greatly hampers identification of intact fossils. Compared to other fenestellids with two rows of apertures, Fenestella is relatively fine, with large apertures and wide dissepiments. The distance between apertures in Fenestella remains the same as colonies grow and individuals (or zooids) will have had equal size lophophores.|$|R
