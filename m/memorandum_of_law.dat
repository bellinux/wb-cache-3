The {{purpose of this study was}} to analyze 1. How <b>Memorandum</b> <b>of</b> Understanding is legally regulated in Indonesia if one of the parties breaches the contract during the implement process <b>of</b> the <b>Memorandum</b> <b>of</b> Understanding, 2. How the dispute occured due to the breach of contract found in the <b>Memorandum</b> <b>of</b> Understanding made by PT. Matahari Anugerah Perkasa and CV. Ponorogo is settled, and 3. What legal sanctions should be imposed to the party that do not perform his/her obligations as agreed in the <b>Memorandum</b> <b>of</b> Understanding. The data for this analytical prescriptive study with empirical juridical approach were obtained through documentation study and interviewing related respondents. The data obtained were analyzed through descriptive data analysis. The conclusion drawn from the result of this study is that I. If there is a breach of contract in the <b>Memorandum</b> <b>of</b> Understanding, it is legally regulated based on the content <b>of</b> the <b>Memorandum</b> <b>of</b> Understanding, meaning, if the contents <b>of</b> the <b>Memorandum</b> <b>of</b> Understanding meet the elements found in Article 1320 of the Indonesian Civil Codes, the regulation refers to the Article 1338 of the Indonesian Civil Codes stating that it can be applied as a law for those who made the Memorandung of Understanding which means that the agreement stated in the <b>Memorandum</b> <b>of</b> Understanding has a legal power in accordance with Article 1338 paragraph (1) of the Indonesian Civil Codes. Yet, if the agreement stated in the <b>Memorandum</b> <b>of</b> Understanding was made as a letter <b>of</b> intent (<b>memorandum</b> <b>of</b> agreement) only, the legal sanction for it is only a moral sanction, 2.
