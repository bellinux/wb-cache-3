Warner posted three relatively mediocre performances before injuring his groin and being replaced by former starter Josh McCown. McCown performed well enough in the two games Warner <b>missed</b> <b>that</b> McCown remained the starter.|$|E

Mary (bless her heart) recorded {{a few of my}} compositions (never released), but she did an excellent job as always. Mary divorced Les Paul and later married her old school friend from Monrovia, California, namely Don Hatfield, who owned a large construction company in California. He is still with us, and I see him occasionally. Doing great, but he misses Mary.|$|E
25|$|On {{his second}} patrol (2–28 November 1942), Brandi {{was ordered to}} the Mediterranean Sea where he was placed {{under the command of}} the 29th U-boat Flotilla. His mission in the Mediterranean theater of {{operations}} was to help secure the supply routes for the Afrikakorps in North Africa. To get to his destination Brandi had to traverse the heavily guarded Strait of Gibraltar. Brandi made the passage on 8 November 1942 submerged. Nevertheless, U-617 was discovered by a British Short Sunderland bomber which dropped two depth charges, but <b>missed.</b> <b>That</b> day, British-American forces invaded French North Africa in Operation Torch (8–16 November 1942). At 11:27 on 21 November, Brandi attacked a strong British naval task force, firing a spread of four torpedoes at distance. Following the assault, U-617 came under attack. Over four hours, 80 depth charges were dropped on U-617. At 16:00 on 23 November, Brandi unsuccessfully attacked a cruiser before arriving in La Spezia on 28 November 1942. Although no ships were actually sunk that day, the Führer der Unterseeboote Italy (FdU—Leader of U-boat Operations) later credited Brandi with the sinking of one cruiser of French or American origin, and one destroyer. Additionally the FdU acknowledged that Brandi had torpedoed two freighters, their sinking was assumed. The FdU denied him credit for having severely damaged a battleship.|$|E

500|$|The S-100 bus {{was used}} {{throughout}} the 1980s until it was overtaken by the IBM PC ISA bus. Seattle Computer Products (SCP) was a manufacturer of S-100 memory boards. The company's engineer, Tim Paterson, designed an Intel 8086 CPU system on two S-100 boards in 1979. Microsoft, then in nearby Bellevue, Washington, used the prototype machine to test their 8086 version of BASIC. Digital Research had promised to deliver an 8086 version of their CP/M operating system by December 1979 but <b>missed</b> <b>that</b> date. SCP needed a disk operating system to sell its 8086 products so Patterson wrote QDOS, a [...] "Quick and Dirty Operating System" [...] in three months. Microsoft would later purchase QDOS from SCP for $50,000 {{and use it as}} the basis for the IBM PC DOS.|$|E

[...] Tyler Foster of DVD Talk called Ricardio {{one of the highlights of}} the season. The A.V. Club reviewer Oliver Sava, in a review for [...] "Lady & Peebles", wrote that Ricardio is [...] "always welcome on this series, largely due to Takei’s delightful voice work." [...] Furthermore, he praised the way that Takei delivered his lines, noting that [...] "there’s a theatrical smarminess to his vocals that is a stark contrast to the Ice King’s nasality", and that [...] "Takei always sounds like he’s having a great time reading the ridiculous lines that are written for him." ...|$|E
500|$|The Violin Concerto was Elgar's last popular triumph. The {{following}} year he presented his Second Symphony in London, but was disappointed at its reception. Unlike the First Symphony, it ends {{not in a}} blaze of orchestral splendour but quietly and contemplatively. Reed, who played at the premiere, later wrote that Elgar was recalled to the platform several times to acknowledge the applause, [...] "but <b>missed</b> <b>that</b> unmistakable note perceived when an audience, even an English audience, is thoroughly roused or worked up, as it was after the Violin Concerto or the First Symphony." [...] Elgar asked Reed, [...] "What is the matter with them, Billy? They sit there like a lot of stuffed pigs." [...] The work was, by normal standards, a success, with twenty-seven performances within three years of its premiere, but it did not achieve the international furore of the First Symphony.|$|E
500|$|Despite his careful {{planning}} {{and attention to}} detail, the bureau felt strongly that Cooper lacked crucial skydiving skills and experience. [...] "We originally thought Cooper was an experienced jumper, perhaps even a paratrooper," [...] said Special Agent Larry Carr, leader of the investigative team from 2006 until its dissolution in 2016. [...] "We concluded {{after a few years}} this was simply not true. No experienced parachutist would have jumped in the pitch-black night, in the rain, with a 200-mile-an-hour wind in his face, wearing loafers and a trench coat. It was simply too risky. He also <b>missed</b> <b>that</b> his reserve 'chute was only for training, and had been sewn shut—something a skilled skydiver would have checked." [...] He also failed to bring or request a helmet, chose to jump with the older and technically inferior of the two primary parachutes supplied to him, and jumped into a [...] wind chill without proper protection against the extreme cold.|$|E

500|$|The death scenes {{attracted}} over 250 complaints, 154 {{of them to}} {{the television}} watchdog, the Broadcasting Standards Commission, the highest number of complaints for a television programme in 2002. In the wake of the complaints, BBC insiders had admitted that the scenes [...] "clearly disturbed" [...] some of the viewers, but also defended their decision to show the scene as it would show the audience [...] "the kind of threat which might be faced by agents engaged in the fight against terrorism." [...] The Broadcasting Standards Commission stated that despite the shocking content; [...] "in the context was acceptable and important for the later narrative," [...] however the watchdog still criticised the BBC for failing to warn viewers of the violence to come. Garrett refuted this, stating: [...] "Not only was there a clear warning before the programme began, but for anyone who <b>missed</b> <b>that,</b> {{the subject matter of the}} episode (a conspiracy to stir up inter-racial violence perpetrated by a man who clearly beat his wife) was hardly the stuff of which chirpy little bucolic fantasies are made." ...|$|E
500|$|McFall {{spent the}} next year at home, during which he took up {{mountain}} biking and climbing {{and worked as a}} fitness instructor at his local leisure centre. He also started running in the summer of 2003 as soon as he had his prosthesis fitted: [...] "I love that sound of air rushing past your ears and the freedom of it. I <b>missed</b> <b>that</b> and I wanted to get that back." [...] After taking up his place at Swansea University to pursue a Bachelor of Science (B.Sc.) in sport and exercise science, he practised on the university's running track and also trained with a local running club, the Swansea Harriers Athletic Club. However, he found running difficult and uncomfortable as his prosthesis was not designed for the purpose, and frequently got damaged. Upon making inquiries at the Federation of Disability Sport Wales (FDSW), he was introduced to carbon-fibre running [...] "blades". He graduated from university with an upper second-class honours degree in summer 2004, taking part in his first race at the Disability Sports Events (DSE) Championships in the UK the same year.|$|E
500|$|Fox left Wellington in late July 1888 for the Caucasus Mountains in the Russian Empire, joining up with William Frederick Donkin and Clinton Dent. The {{three were}} aiming {{to become the}} first climbers to scale Koshtan-Tau, one of the few {{mountains}} in the region yet to be scaled. The three started from Nalchik, though Dent was forced to return home due to ill-health, leaving Fox and Donkin to attempt the climb, along with two Swiss guides. Their initial plan was to climb a glacier on the northern slopes of the mountain, and then make their final ascent on the western side. However, a rock wall on the western slopes prevented this, and they changed their plans to attack the mountain from the east. They planned to meet up with their outfitter to the south-east of the mountain, but after they <b>missed</b> <b>that</b> meeting, a message was sent back to Dent reporting the climbers missing. The Times reported on 6 October that Donkin and Fox, along with their guides, had suffered a mountaineering accident that had led [...] "to the almost certain loss of four lives".|$|E

500|$|With Stankonia, OutKast {{became the}} first hip-hop act to openly {{acknowledge}} rave culture as an influence. [...] During the late 1990s, rappers tended to embrace slow, laid-back beats in their productions. [...] On several tracks on Stankonia, the group employed faster, more chaotic tempos to reflect rave culture {{and the introduction of}} new drugs such as ecstasy into the hip-hop scene. Boston-based DJ Armand Van Helden recalls, [...] "In the nineties, the bpms in hip-hop got slower and the clubs were moody... it just kind of dragged. I really <b>missed</b> <b>that</b> kind of hands-in-the-air shit." [...] A remix of [...] "B.O.B" [...] created by Rage Against The Machine's Zack de la Rocha received airplay on alternative radio stations, expanding the group's fanbase beyond hip-hop and urban listeners. Despite containing anti-war sentiments, [...] "B.O.B" [...] became popular amongst American troops deployed in Afghanistan. [...] While working on her acclaimed album The ArchAndroid (2010), American R singer Janelle Monáe cited Stankonias experimental nature as an influence. Rapper Pill also acknowledged Stankonia, and particularly the production of Organized Noize, as an inspiration: [...] "The sounds, the instrumentation of the samples, the different horns—everything about the tracks were great to me." ...|$|E
500|$|Kaushik and {{his team}} taught the crew [...] "all [...] knew about hockey". In an interview, he later said that he [...] "taught him (Sahni) {{everything}} about the game, starting from how the camp is conducted, how the girls come from different backgrounds and cultures, the psychological factors involved. Also how the coach faces pressure to select girls from different states and teams". After Negi was suggested, the latter assembled a team of hockey players to train the actors. He later said that he [...] "trained the girls for six months. Waking up at 4, traveling from Kandivili to Churchgate. We would retire around 11 in the night. It was tiring. But {{we were on a}} mission ... They couldn't run; couldn't hold the hockey sticks. I ensured none of them [...] cut their nails or eyebrows (as the players do). The girls have worked very hard. I salute them". Some of the actors, such as Chitrashi, Sandia, and Raynia, were cast because they were hockey players. Rob Miller was the Sport Action Director, and worked with Negi to train the actors. About working with Khan, Negi recalled that everything was planned [...] "including the penalty stroke that SRK <b>missed.</b> <b>That</b> shot alone took us nearly 20 hours as I was keen that it should be very realistic. I took the help of a lot of my former teammates. But more importantly, it was so easy working with SRK. He is unbelievably modest and was willing to do as many re-takes as we wanted".|$|E
