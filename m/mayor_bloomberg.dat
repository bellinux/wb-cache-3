Morse supporters were upset about an ad alleging ethical misconduct by Morse, noting that he had been cleared of those allegations. Giron supporters were accused of misrepresenting the issue as a choice on women's rights and abortion.|$|E

Several years earlier the Conservancy had also been promised a total of $980,000 from New York State, the City Council, <b>Mayor</b> <b>Bloomberg,</b> and the Manhattan Borough President's office, but had yet to receive most of the city funds.

25|$|Multiple {{explanations}} {{have been}} proposed for the relatively slow response of the snow cleanup in the New York City metropolitan area. For example, the local media did not fully alert the general public until Christmas Day about the impending storm due to the complexity and lateness of the forecast models predicting the storm; thus, public awareness was delayed. Another possible cause was that <b>Mayor</b> <b>Bloomberg</b> had previously laid off 400 New York City Sanitation workers due to budget cuts; therefore, fewer plows were at work. In addition, some city workers {{who are responsible for}} managing the snow removal process had taken the day off from work during the storm due to the Christmas holiday. Also, a snow emergency was not declared, contributing to the number of abandoned cars on the streets.|$|E

25|$|New Jersey's Hudson Waterfront lies {{opposite}} Manhattan on the Hudson River, {{and during}} the Dutch colonial era, was {{under the jurisdiction of}} New Amsterdam and known as Bergen. Jersey City and Hoboken in Hudson County are sometimes referred to as the sixth borough, given their proximity and connections by PATH trains. Fort Lee, in Bergen County, opposite Upper Manhattan and connected by the George Washington Bridge, has also been called the sixth borough. In the 1920s, soon after the creation of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey there were calls to integrate the rail and subway system in New York and Northern New Jersey by expanding the New York City Subway. After <b>Mayor</b> <b>Bloomberg</b> called for the 7 Subway Extension to continue to Secaucus Junction, a feasibility study was conducted and released in April 2013.|$|E
25|$|If built, the {{extension}} {{would take the}} New York City Subway outside the city's borders and under the Hudson River for the first time. The plan would alleviate pressure on the NJ Transit/Amtrak route under the Hudson River, after the cancellation of the Access to the Region's Core tunnel project by New Jersey Governor Chris Christie in October 2010. It would offer a direct route to Grand Central Terminal {{on the east side}} of Manhattan, while connecting with most other subway routes. New York City spent $250,000 for a consultant to conduct feasibility studies for the project. However, no design work has commenced nor have financing arrangements been made. On October 26, 2011, New York City <b>Mayor</b> <b>Bloomberg</b> reiterated his support for the project, while New Jersey Governor Chris Christie also expressed general concurrence. In April 2013, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority rejected the proposed extension, citing lack of funding.|$|E
25|$|In 1998, an {{extension}} of the BMT Astoria Line to LaGuardia Airport was planned as part of a $1.2 billion package to provide access to the New York City airports with funding from the MTA, the Port Authority and the city. The preferred route would have extended the Astoria Line along 31st Street north onto Con Edison’s property at the edge of Astoria and then east along 19th Avenue to the Marine Air Terminal. The MTA also considered an eastward extension along Ditmars Boulevard, and a plan to reroute LaGuardia-bound trains from Queensboro Plaza through the Sunnyside rail yard and along the eastern edge of St. Michael’s Cemetery to elevated tracks parallel to the Grand Central Parkway. A fourth route was to have trains turn east via Astoria Boulevard. All of the options would have new elevated sections built. $645 million for the LaGuardia extension was included in the MTA’s 2000-2004 Five-Year Capital Plan, and in late 2002, <b>Mayor</b> <b>Bloomberg</b> supported the extension. These option were studied in the LaGuardia Airport Subway Access Study. However, community opposition was strong and therefore the plan was canceled in July 2003.|$|E
