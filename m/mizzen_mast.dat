5|$|After {{fifteen minutes}} of combat, Boston lost its cross-jack yard and by 05:45 had {{suffered}} significant damage to its rigging and sails, rendering the ship significantly less manoeuvrable than Embuscade. At 06:10 the main topmast was knocked over and the <b>mizzen</b> <b>mast</b> badly damaged, and ten minutes later, as he was exhorting his men to greater efforts, a cannonball struck the rail where Captain Courtenay and Royal Marine Lieutenant James Butler were standing. Butler was killed instantly and Courtenay fell to the deck unresponsive, possibly killed. Believing his commander to be dead, Lieutenant John Edwards assumed command and had the bodies thrown overboard {{in an effort to}} prevent his sailors losing morale from the death of their captain. Boston continued to suffer under the heavier guns of the French ship and by 06:40 the <b>mizzen</b> <b>mast</b> was close to collapse and much of the remaining rigging had been shot away. Casualties mounted, with Lieutenant Edwards and Lieutenant Alexander Kerr both badly wounded, the latter blinded in one eye and the former struck on the head and briefly rendered unconscious.|$|E
5|$|After {{consultation}} with Admiralty, Adams {{took advantage of}} this freedom to make four substantive changes to the Tartar design. The ship's wheel was moved from behind the <b>mizzen</b> <b>mast</b> to before it to improve the helmsman's line of sight. The tiller was also relocated, from an exposed position on the quarterdeck to a safer location belowdecks and near the stern. The vessel's hawseholes were relocated from the lower to the upper deck to allow additional storage space inside the hull. Finally, {{in recognition of the}} vessel's likely role in chasing small enemy craft, the leading pair of gunports were moved from the sides of the vessel to the bow in order to form a battery of chase guns.|$|E
5|$|The first udema Gamla was c. 30m (100ft) {{long and}} with a draft of 1.5m (5ft). The later udemas,Torborg and Ingeborg, carried a <b>mizzen</b> <b>mast,</b> and were both longer and wider, 37m (121ft) long and almost 9m (29ft) wide with a draft of just over 3m (10ft). Torborg, built in 1772, had three {{additional}} 12-pounders, eleven in the centerline and two in the bow facing forwards, housed under a decked superstructure with gun ports, but with the rowing seats left undecked. This arrangement proved to be less successful with reports about problems with splintering and lingering gunpowder smoke. She was also a poor sailer and slow under oars, earning the udema a poor reputation.|$|E

50|$|The {{ships were}} {{provided}} with a three-masted barquentine rig, that is, with square sails on the foremast and fore-and-aft sails on the main and <b>mizzen</b> <b>masts.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Although {{smaller than}} the Lugger, the Dabber carries a full yawl rig on main and <b>mizzen</b> <b>masts.</b> However, the Dabber can easily be {{distinguished}} by its bowsprit and transom-hung rudder.|$|R
5|$|Although {{only the}} lower {{fittings}} of the rigging survives, a 1514 inventory {{and the only}} known contemporary depiction of the ship from the Anthony Roll {{have been used to}} determine how the propulsion system of the Mary Rose was designed. Nine, or possibly ten, sails were flown from four masts and a bowsprit: the foremast and mainmast had two and three square sails respectively; the <b>mizzen</b> <b>mast</b> had a lateen sail and a small square sail and the bonaventure mizzen had at least one lateen sail, and possibly also a square sail, and the bowsprit flew a small square spritsail. According to the Anthony Roll illustration (see top of this section), the yards (the spars from which the sails were set) on the foremast and mainmast were also equipped with sheerhooks, twin curved blades sharpened on the inside, that were intended to cut an enemy ship's rigging during boarding actions.|$|E
5|$|A {{more recent}} {{critical}} review of contemporary sources doesn't require a supposed typo in 1771 {{to explain this}} shorter measurement for the mizzen whilst {{at the same time}} offers supporting evidence of its cap being at the taller supposed normal height. Sydney Parkinson's sketches and paintings of Cooks Bark Endeavour along with the 1771 Woolwich Yard Bark Endeavour spar measurements National Maritime Museum in Greenwich NMM ZAZ6594, and other contemporary sources suggest that the shorter <b>mizzen</b> <b>mast</b> was not stepped in the hold/keelson, but instead was stepped in the lower deck 10ft above this as was sometimes done. This would bring its standing height at the cap to within a supposed normal height of around 8– 9ft below the main mast cap and approx 5.5ft below the foremast cap when comparing the heights of the standing mast tops (excludes top and gallant masts) from the level of the water line. Whereas the shorter mizzen stepped in the hold on the keelson instead of the lower deck would make the standing mizzen cap 18ft below the main mast cap which is clearly not the case when critically examining Sydney Parkinson's drawings and the contemporary painting titled HMS Endeavour off the coast of New Holland, by Samuel Atkins c. 1794 {{at the top of this}} page. Zooming this painting also reveals that the position of the mizzen channel is forward to inline with the mast which it is when looking at the angle of the mizzen chainplates on the original as fitted draught NMM ZAZ7844. Using these mizzen chainplate angles from this as fitted draught it is possible to extrapolate where the top of the standing mast could be and combined with the similar shroud angles Sydney Parkinson drew in his sketch of the larboard quarter of Endeavour support this theory of the shorter standing mizzen stepped in the lower deck which would make its standing cap 10 foot higher than if stepped in the hold.|$|E
25|$|A yawl {{is similar}} to a ketch, with a shorter <b>mizzen</b> <b>mast</b> carried astern the {{rudderpost}} more for balancing the helm than propulsion.|$|E
50|$|In 1852, on {{a voyage}} from San Francisco to Hong Kong, {{she lost her}} main and <b>mizzen</b> <b>masts</b> with all sails and rigging {{attached}} during a severe typhoon in the China Sea.|$|R
50|$|In {{the first}} half of the 18th century, most naval sloops were two-masted vessels, usually {{carrying}} a ketch or a snow rig. A ketch had main and <b>mizzen</b> <b>masts</b> but no foremast, while a snow had a foremast and a main <b>mast</b> but no <b>mizzen.</b>|$|R
50|$|A three masted vessel, square rigged on the {{foremast}} and fore-and-aft rigged on {{the main}} and <b>mizzen</b> <b>masts.</b> Some sailors who have sailed on them {{say it is a}} poor-handling compromise between a barque and a ship, though having more speed than a barque or schooner.|$|R
25|$|The crew {{set up a}} jury {{main mast}} and began heading back east towards Portsmouth, {{spending}} {{the rest of the}} day trying to set up a jury <b>mizzen</b> <b>mast.</b>|$|E
25|$|In January 1803 Caldicot Castle was {{returning}} to Liverpool from Quebec {{when she had to}} put in at Crookhaven. She had lost her <b>mizzen</b> <b>mast</b> and rudder, and sustained other damage.|$|E
25|$|On 16 June, Chiffone {{captured}} the East Indiaman Bellona {{on her way}} from Bengal to London. In taking Bellone, Chiffone had her <b>mizzen</b> <b>mast</b> crippled. A prize crew under Ensign Jean-Michel Mahé took Bellona to Mauritius where she arrived a month later.|$|E
50|$|On {{the morning}} of 16 December 1821 Boddingtons was in ballast when she caught fire at St. Catherine's Stairs, Wapping. Her crew scuttled her and {{afterwards}} her main and <b>mizzen</b> <b>masts</b> were cut away. Lloyd's Register for 1823 carries the notation that Boddingtons was rebuilt in 1822.|$|R
5|$|In the {{beginning}} Sea Cloud featured royal-sails over single topgallant- and double top-sails on the fore and <b>mizzen</b> <b>masts.</b> The main mast {{was equipped with}} a royal-sail over double topgallant- and double top-sails. Today the first three masts are rigged with double top-sails, single topgallants, royals and a main skysail.|$|R
60|$|Even {{above the}} noise of the storm, a loud cry was heard, and the crash of {{breaking}} timber as, with the shock, the main and <b>mizzen</b> <b>masts,</b> weakened by the loss of the foremast, went over the sides. The next great wave drove the vessel forward two or three fathoms.|$|R
25|$|After this, Captain George Wolfe assumed command, {{having been}} {{appointed}} in April 1801. On 1 July Galatea came into Plymouth after a cruise of 18 {{weeks in the}} Atlantic and off the western islands. Then during October and November {{she was on a}} 28-day cruise in the Bay of Biscay. Here she not only endured fifteen severe gales, but on 1 and 2 November she nearly foundered. Hurricane-force winds sent her <b>mizzen</b> <b>mast</b> and the main and foretop masts over the side, even though she had no sails set. Furthermore, when the <b>mizzen</b> <b>mast</b> went it took one seaman to go overboard with it and severely injured others. When the winds died down on 3 November, Byng sailed Galatea for Cork. There he jury rigged a rigged a mizzen-mast, main, and foretop-mast. Galatea finally reached Plymouth on 22 November.|$|E
25|$|In 1851, Pacifics {{passenger}} accommodations were {{increased to}} include an additional 80 second-class passengers. On 4 December 1851, Pacific rescued {{the crew of the}} barque Jesse Stevens, which had foundered in the Atlantic several hundred miles southeast of Newfoundland. In 1853, Pacifics <b>mizzen</b> <b>mast</b> was removed, presumably in order to reduce drag.|$|E
25|$|Ships of {{the class}} were armed with two 7-inch (90 cwt) muzzle-loading rifled guns on {{pivoting}} mounts, and four 64-pounder muzzle-loading rifled guns (two on pivoting mounts, and two broadside). Four machine guns and one light gun completed the weaponry. All the ships {{of the class}} were provided with a barque rig, that is, square-rigged foremast and mainmast, and fore-and-aft sails only on the <b>mizzen</b> <b>mast.</b>|$|E
500|$|Gothenburg was {{commissioned}} in 1855 following her construction at Lungley's building yards in Millwall, London. She was a 501-ton, [...] vessel, with a , coal-burning engine. She was rigged as barquentine, with her funnel set well aft between the main and <b>mizzen</b> <b>masts.</b> She was fitted with four lifeboats, two port and two starboard.|$|R
25|$|An action ensued {{at about}} 11a.m. with Trincomalee {{engaging}} Iphigénie and Comet engaging Pearl. The exchange of fire lasted {{about two hours}} when suddenly Trincomalee exploded. She {{was so close to}} Iphigénie that the explosion knocked down Iphigénies main and <b>mizzen</b> <b>masts</b> and ruptured her sides, with the result that she soon started to founder.|$|R
50|$|Gothenburg was {{commissioned}} in 1855 following her construction at Lungley's building yards in Millwall, London. She was a 501-ton, 197 ft vessel, with a , coal-burning engine. She was rigged as barquentine, with her funnel set well aft between the main and <b>mizzen</b> <b>masts.</b> She was fitted with four lifeboats, two port and two starboard.|$|R
25|$|At nightfall, a Dutch pinnace made a probe {{from the}} {{direction}} of the bay. It was assessing the defenses and approached the eastern side of the fort in front of the breastworks. Portuguese guns opened fire and after several shots they managed to score a direct hit. The pinnace lost its <b>mizzen</b> <b>mast</b> and was forced to retire. Thereafter, Dutch ships did not approach the fort from that direction.|$|E
25|$|Captain Pringle Stokes was {{appointed}} captain of Beagle on 7 September 1825, {{and the ship}} was allocated to the surveying section of the Hydrographic Office. On 27 September 1825 Beagle docked at Woolwich to be repaired and fitted out for her new duties. Her guns were reduced from ten cannon to six and a <b>mizzen</b> <b>mast</b> was added to improve her handling, thereby changing her from a brig to a bark (or barque).|$|E
25|$|On 30 September the French frigate Weser, {{under the}} command of captaine de vaisseau Cantzlaat, Chevalier de L'ordre Imperiale de la Reunion, sailed from the Texel for the North Sea. There she {{captured}} two Swedish ships before a gale on the 16th took away her main and <b>mizzen</b> <b>mast.</b> Two days later Scylla encountered her 60 leagues west of Ushant, making her way towards Brest under jury main and mizzen masts. Rather than engage her and risk being crippled and so unable to follow her given the weather, Macdonald decided to follow her.|$|E
50|$|An action ensued {{at about}} 11a.m. with Trincomalee {{engaging}} Iphigénie and Comet engaging Pearl. The exchange of fire lasted {{about two hours}} when suddenly Trincomalee exploded.

50|$|The three steel masts are 28.7, 31.3, and 28.0 metres {{high and}} carry 14 sails totalling 724.3m² (7,965 ft²). There are 3 jibs and 4 square sails on the foremast. The main and <b>mizzen</b> <b>masts</b> are gaff rigged, and both {{can carry a}} gaff-topsail. In addition, there are 3 staysails on the main mast.|$|R
50|$|The action between Crescent and the Dutch frigate Brill {{continued}} {{a little}} longer. She {{was the same}} rate as Castor, mounting twenty-six 12-pounder guns, two 6-pounder guns, and four 4-pounder guns. A shot from Brill brought down Crescents main and <b>mizzen</b> <b>masts</b> on to her decks, rendering her guns inoperable and the ship unmanageable. Packenham was forced to strike his colours.|$|R
25|$|Once {{ownership}} of the vessel had passed into Navy hands, Randall and Taylor were directed to complete her in accordance with an experimental design, as the Royal Navy's first three-masted ship rigged sloop. The quarterdeck was lengthened from the original plans in order to incorporate a <b>mizzen</b> <b>mast,</b> with the intention that the additional sails would enhance speed and maneuverability compared to the traditional two-masted snow rig sloop. This proved sufficiently successful that from 1756 ship rigging became the standard for all subsequent 14-gun and 16-gun sloops in Royal Navy hands.|$|E
25|$|Captain Thomas Wakefield {{received}} a letter of marque on 9 November 1798. On 4 December he sailed from the Downs, bound for Bombay and China. Only five days later, on 9 December, Henry Addison struck the Bembridge Ledge on the Isle of Wight, during a heavy fog. When the tide went out {{the next day she}} bilged. Five crew member drowned while trying to reach shore on a raft. Also, a block falling from the <b>mizzen</b> <b>mast</b> hit a boy on the head, killing him. By 16 December all that was left standing was the forepart of the vessel's upper works. Some casks were saved, but the EIC put the value of the cargo it lost at £29,222.|$|E
25|$|Orders for {{the fleet}} at Tynemouth were given on 28 April. All the ships {{were to be}} ready to weigh anchor at a {{favourable}} wind. The Lord Admiral, Viscount Lisle's flagship would fly the St George Cross on the fore-top mast and two top-lights at night. The ships of the 'vaward', the vanguard, would follow and anchor as near as possible. Hertford and the treasure-ship (Ralph Sadler was treasurer) would follow with his ensign on the main-top mast of the Rose Lion with two night lights on the shrouds. The Earl of Shrewsbury, captain of the rear-ward would fly the ensign on his <b>mizzen</b> <b>mast,</b> with a cresset light in the poop deck at night. The other ships were not to show flags or lights. Any ship that was transporting base or double base guns was to mount them on the fore-deck for the landing.|$|E
5000|$|Due to the {{slowness}} of Warwicks progress Knowles ordered HMS [...] to pass her at 3pm. However it was {{not until}} 4pm that the Knowles flagship HMS , and HMS [...] entered the engagement. This time the combined British ships battered the Spanish and inflicted heavy damage on Conquistador which had soon lost fore and <b>mizzen</b> <b>masts</b> and could only manoeuvre in a small way.|$|R
5000|$|James Baines was a {{very heavily}} sparred ship being 2,275 GRT (Gross Registered Tons), she was wide, {{carrying}} 1,400 tons of cargo in her holds, and accommodating 800 passengers and crew in her 5 decks (3 continuous decks, forecastle and poop decks). Her masts called fore, main, and <b>mizzen</b> <b>masts</b> carried all in all a maximum of 43 sails as a full rigged ship with studding sails. In detail: ...|$|R
50|$|All three masts (with lower, top, and {{topgallant}} masts including royal and skysail masts) had {{a course}} sail, a topsail, a topgallant sail, a royal sail, and a skysail. The main-skysail mast has been lengthened and {{fitted with a}} moonsail later on. Her sail suit was made by Messrs. Porter, Mayhew & Co., Boston. Older pictures show the ship with only four square sails on the fore and <b>mizzen</b> <b>masts,</b> and five on the main mast.|$|R
