500|$|In March 1948 Horne {{appeared}} with Murdoch in six episodes of the BBC Television comedy series Kaleidoscope. In June that year he and Murdoch again appeared {{on television in}} a one-off sitcom, At Home, which they wrote. The following year Horne began his connection with Twenty Questions, an association that lasted, on-and-off, for 20 years. By the fourth series of Much-Binding in 1950, the listener figures had declined to a level that concerned the BBC and they decided against a fifth series. Rather than {{wait to see what}} other offers of work would come in from the Corporation, Horne and Murdoch signed the comedy to a 35-programme series on Radio Luxembourg between October 1950 and June 1951. The programme was poorly received on the commercial channel: Murdoch observed that [...] "it wasn't really a great success—even <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>said</b> it was rotten, and she was my greatest fan". After one series, the show returned to the BBC in 1951–52, although renamed as Over to You. Murdoch and Horne again appeared together, in April 1952, on Desert Island Discs.|$|E
2500|$|Tracey Ullman {{was born}} Trace Ullman in Slough, Buckinghamshire, the younger of two daughters, to Dorin (...) and Antony John Ullman. Her mother was British, with Roma ancestry, {{and her father}} was a Roman Catholic Pole. On the subject of the {{spelling}} of her name: [...] "My real name is Trace Ullman, but I added the 'y.' <b>My</b> <b>mother</b> <b>said</b> it was spelled the American way, but I don't think she can spell! I always wanted a middle name. My mum used to tell me it was Mary but I never believed her. I looked on my birth certificate and I didn't have one, just Trace Ullman." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1966 Brett {{successfully}} {{applied to}} be a music journalist at pop music weekly, Go-Set, and in May she replaced founding feature writer, Doug Panther. She later reflected, [...] "My career is inexplicable and it's a career path that nobody should follow! It basically starts with an 18-year old refusing {{to go to}} university {{because that was the}} one thing that my parents wanted of me, that and to be slim. So I defied both of those desires. <b>My</b> <b>mother</b> <b>said</b> I had to get a job, which shocked me. There was a new newspaper opening up in Australia called Go-Set and I walked into the office and I started work the next day. I don't think this would happen today." [...] The paper's editor was Tony Schauble, and according to Go-Set staff photographer, Colin Beard, [...] " [...] had been to see Schauble several times and had made a favourable impression on him and more importantly, she had a car, which was an attractive incentive to employ her." [...] Fellow writers included Vince Lovegrove, Molly Meldrum, Ed Nimmervoll and Stan Rofe. In November 1966 Brett was interviewed on The Go!! Show, a Victorian-based pop music show, by its host, Johnny Young (also a pop singer). Young described Brett's style [...] "She seemed genuinely interested in the pop stars she interviewed, but she could also be intimidating at times." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Have you forgot," [...] he whispered, [...] "that <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>said</b> as {{she would}} come and see us every night in our bed? If yer cries, she'll see as we're terrible unhappy, and that will make her unhappy too." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nay, sir, 'tis not for that; but <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>said</b> {{she should}} be beaten if ever she spake of the fortune yonder Tibbott told her, and we are sure that she--Tibbott I mean--is a witch, and knows more than she ought." ...|$|E
50|$|Jo’s {{father taught}} her to play baseball. She {{actually}} remembers being a young girl and playing ball {{on the street with}} the boys. She explained that: “a neighbor came up to <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> and <b>said,</b> ‘Why does your daughter act like that? Why can’t she be more ladylike?’ <b>My</b> <b>mother</b> never <b>said</b> a word.” One of her most significant influences was growing up on a street where all her neighbors enjoyed playing baseball. Every single day, they played a game of baseball {{in the middle of their}} street. People from all over town came to watch it.|$|R
6000|$|I was {{too weak}} to contest the matter; I obeyed. My medical {{attendant}} nodded across the bed to <b>my</b> <b>mother,</b> and <b>said,</b> [...] "Now, he'll do." [...] <b>My</b> <b>mother</b> had some compassion on me. She relieved my anxiety in these plain words: ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Is it indeed?' cried he. 'Well, now, many is {{the time}} that <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> has <b>said,</b> when I played her a trick, that my end would be that I should hang {{on the bridge of}} Dublin.' ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Angela," [...] he went on, boldly enough, {{now that}} the ice was broken, [...] "I have often thought about what <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>said,</b> but until now I have never quite {{understood}} her meaning. I do understand it now. Angela, do you understand me?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That is what <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>said</b> to dad. But {{he thinks}} not. He {{thinks it is}} more than likely Mr. Enos died in debt and left his affairs all tangled up, and that the lawyers want my father to help {{straighten}} them out." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'But {{you do not}} {{grieve for}} <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> still?' <b>said</b> Ethel, anxiously. 'Even his grief is a grave joy to him now; and one is always told that such things, as it was with you, are but a very small part of a man's life.' ...|$|R
60|$|Mother, mother. [To LADY FREDERICK.] I'm awfully sorry. I {{feel that}} {{you have a right to}} be angry. For all that you've {{suffered}} I beg your pardon most humbly. <b>My</b> <b>mother</b> has <b>said</b> and done things which I regret to say are quite unjustifiable.|$|R
30|$|I asked <b>my</b> <b>mother,</b> I {{want to give}} my eyes to this. And <b>my</b> <b>mother,</b> but she <b>said</b> {{when you}} {{reincarnate}} after rebirth you will not have eyes if you donate eyesight.|$|R
6000|$|... 'No! {{let me go}} to my own room,' murmured Ferdinand, in a faint voice. 'That {{room where}} <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>said</b> the day would come--oh! what did my mother say? Would there were only mother's love, and then I should not be here or thus.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nonsense! But you {{are rather}} put upon, that's certain. <b>My</b> <b>mother</b> <b>said,</b> {{when she came}} to see me last week, that she would not like a little one of her own to be in your place.--Now, come in, and I've some good news for you." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>My</b> <b>mother</b> <b>said</b> {{nothing in}} that discussion. The word colonies always upset her. She was afraid, I think, {{that if she}} turned her mind in that {{direction}} my errant father might suddenly and shockingly be discovered, no doubt conspicuously bigamic and altogether offensive and revolutionary. She {{did not want to}} rediscover my father at all.|$|E

60|$|Meantime I {{submitted}} to be dressed {{as my mother}} wished, much indeed as I am now, except that my hair was put into little curls, and I had no cap.

6000|$|... "The {{people of}} Helium asked that I be named with my father's name, but <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>said</b> no, {{that you and}} she had chosen a name for me together, and that your wish must be honoured before all others, so the name that she called me {{is the one that}} you desired, a {{combination}} of hers and yours--Carthoris." ...|$|E
60|$|One autumn morning I {{was with}} <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> {{in the front}} garden, when Mr. Murdstone--I knew him by that name now--came by, on horseback.
