5|$|According to Hervé Dumont's Encyclopédie du film historique {{the role}} of Kate Hardcastle was played by Rosemond and {{the role of}} George Marlow was played by Crane. This {{information}} <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> a surviving film still. One surviving film still was used in an advertisement by the Thanhouser Company.|$|E
5|$|Following the drilling, a hole {{opens up}} in the object's {{interior}} wall. Inside, Quatermass and the others find the remains of insect-like aliens resembling giant three-legged locusts, with stubby antennae on their heads giving the impression of horns. As Quatermass and Roney examine the remains, they theorise the aliens <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> a planet habitable five million years ago– Mars.|$|E
5|$|Ragtime was a {{style of}} dance music based around the piano, using syncopated rhythms and chromaticisms; the genre's most {{well-known}} performer and composer was undoubtedly Scott Joplin. Donald Clarke considers ragtime the culmination of coon songs, used first in minstrel shows and then vaudeville, {{and the result of}} the rhythms of minstrelsy percolating into the mainstream; he also suggests that ragtime's distinctive sound <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> an attempt to imitate the African American banjo using the keyboard.|$|E
5000|$|People named [...] "Hergenröther" [...] <b>may</b> well <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> this town.|$|R
50|$|Begnet <b>may</b> not <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> Dalkey, {{despite the}} genealogical note on her origin. Missionaries <b>may</b> <b>have</b> founded the two churches {{in her name}} there.|$|R
25|$|The gold <b>may</b> well <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> {{mines in}} {{the west of the}} Massif Central, which had been in {{operation}} since at least the 5th century BC.|$|R
5|$|Shahaf and Doriel built {{models of}} the wall, {{concrete}} drum and IDF post, and tried to reenact the shooting. A mark on the drum from the Israeli Bureau of Standards allowed them to determine its size and composition. They concluded that the shots <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> a position behind the France2 cameraman, where Palestinian police were alleged to have been standing.|$|E
5|$|Some very fragmentary fossils {{belonging}} to pteranodontian pterosaurs, and possibly Pteranodon itself, {{have also been}} found on the Gulf Coast and East Coast of the United States. For example, some bone fragments from the Mooreville Formation of Alabama and the Merchantville Formation of Delaware <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> Pteranodon, though they are too incomplete to make a definite identification. Some remains from Japan have also been tentatively attributed to Pteranodon, but their distance from its known Western Interior Seaway habitat makes this identification unlikely.|$|E
5|$|The {{general idea}} for Sycorax's {{character}} <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> the classical literature familiar {{to many in}} Shakespeare's day. Sycorax is similar to Medea, a witch in Ovid's Metamorphoses, in that both are powerful, magical female figures. Scholars have {{also pointed out that}} Sycorax resembles the magical Circe from Greek mythology as well as perhaps a version of Circe found in the mythology of the Coraxi tribe in modern-day Georgia.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Recycled stones {{built into}} the weir beneath the bridge. One has the remains of two corbels and <b>may</b> well <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> the pre-1802 medieval castle.|$|R
50|$|Some British Afghans <b>may</b> <b>have</b> {{probably}} <b>come</b> <b>from</b> the North-West Frontier Province (NWFP) of British India {{before the}} declaration of Pakistan, as such subsequent people from NWFP became recognised as Pakistanis.|$|R
5000|$|The fell's unusual name <b>may</b> well <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> a {{distortion}} of [...] "Cat Bields" [...] meaning {{shelter of the}} wild cat, although this is not certain. The fell's name is sometimes written as Catbells.|$|R
5|$|The {{only source}} from which Abuwtiyuw is known is a stone {{inscription}} tablet that <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> the funerary chapel of the dog's owner. The tablet was apparently among spolia {{used to build}} another grave in approximately 2280 BC, a sixth-Dynasty mastaba, after the chapel's demolition. It was discovered on 13 October 1935 by Egyptologist George A. Reisner during a joint Harvard University-Boston Museum of Fine Arts expedition, and removed from the site four days later.|$|E
5|$|Through {{contact with}} {{neighboring}} civilizations, the Egyptians also adopted foreign deities. Dedun, who is first {{mentioned in the}} Old Kingdom, <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> Nubia, and Baal, Anat, and Astarte, among others, were adopted from Canaanite religion during the New Kingdom (c. 1550–1070 BC). In Greek and Roman times, from 332 BC to the early centuries AD, deities from across the Mediterranean world were revered in Egypt, but the native gods remained, and they often absorbed the cults of these newcomers into their own worship.|$|E
5|$|Traditionally Padarn {{was said}} to come {{originally}} from Brittany, but he <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> south-east Wales. He {{was said to}} be both abbot and bishop (the distinction was not so great then as it later became) for many years, and from his base at what is now known as Llanbadarn Fawr (great or high church of St Padarn) he evangelised the neighbouring countryside.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{sport is}} the [...] "game of the sticks" [...] where opponents fence with long sticks. This <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> about <b>from</b> the shepherds {{of the islands}} who would {{challenge}} each other using their long walking sticks.|$|R
6000|$|... “They {{have gone}} for the present, meinheer, but you had better stay where you are. They are quite capable of coming back again {{in the hope that}} you <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> out <b>from</b> some hiding-place they <b>may</b> <b>have</b> overlooked.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{will go down}} {{first on}} to the wall, sahib; and if by chance any man <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> up <b>from</b> below, which is not likely, I can hide," [...] and he at once {{commenced}} to lower himself down.|$|R
5|$|A copy of {{the film}} leaked onto {{peer-to-peer}} file sharing networks just hours after opening in theaters. The film was a time-stamped workprint, suggesting it <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> within the industry rather than from someone who videotaped an advance screening. Eight people were later charged with copyright infringement and distributing material illegally. Documents filed by the Los Angeles District Attorney allege that a {{copy of the}} film was taken from an unnamed Californian post-production office by an employee, who later pleaded guilty to his charges. The illegal copy was passed among seven people until reaching an eighth party, who also pleaded guilty to uploading to an unnamed P2P network.|$|E
5|$|Charles Guinand Blackader {{was born}} in Richmond, Surrey on 20 September 1869. His father, Charles George Blackader, was a teacher to {{a small number of}} {{boarding}} pupils; he had come from an Army family, and taught at Cheltenham College and Clifton College, Bristol, before moving to private tuition. His mother, Charlotte Guinand, {{was born in}} Germany; her family <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> Alsace-Lorraine, as Blackader would later describe himself as half-French. During his childhood, the Blackaders moved from Richmond to Southampton, where his father headed the education department at the Hartley Institute, and then to Boulogne, where he taught at Beaurepaire School.|$|E
5|$|Like other reptiles, dinosaurs are {{primarily}} uricotelic, that is, their kidneys extract nitrogenous wastes from their bloodstream and excrete it as uric acid instead of urea or ammonia via the ureters into the intestine. In most living species, uric acid is excreted along with feces as a semisolid waste. However, {{at least some}} modern birds (such as hummingbirds) can be facultatively ammonotelic, excreting most of the nitrogenous wastes as ammonia. They also excrete creatine, rather than creatinine like mammals. This material, {{as well as the}} output of the intestines, emerges from the cloaca. In addition, many species regurgitate pellets, and fossil pellets that <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> dinosaurs are known from as long ago as the Cretaceous period.|$|E
50|$|William <b>may</b> also <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> the {{settlement}} of Lamberton, near Berwick in the Scottish Borders (Logan Mack 1926). The name Lamberton here {{was derived from the}} Germanic name Lambert, whilst Lambroughton, sometimes spelt Lamberton, is derived from a corruption of the clan McLamroch.|$|R
50|$|The nomen Nasidienus {{probably}} {{belongs to}} a class of names deriving from other gentilicia, in this case perhaps Nasidius. Such names were not very characteristic of Latin nomina, but were quite common in Picenum, suggesting that the Nasidieni <b>may</b> originally <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> that region of Italy.|$|R
5000|$|Gradual [...] "dehydration melting" [...] — leakage {{of water}} stored in hydrate {{minerals}} of Earth's rocks — could {{have formed a}} portion of its water. Water <b>may</b> also <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> volcanism: water vapor in the atmosphere that originated in volcanic eruptions <b>may</b> <b>have</b> condensed to form rain, slowly filling Earth's oceanic basins.|$|R
5|$|The {{extinction}} of megalodon {{set the stage}} for further changes in marine communities. The average body size of baleen whales increased significantly after its disappearance, although possibly due to other, climate-related, causes. Conversely however, the increase in baleen whale size {{may have contributed to the}} {{extinction of}} megalodon, as they may have preferred to go after smaller whales; bite marks on large whale species <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> scavenging sharks. Megalodon may have simply become coextinct with smaller whale species, such as Piscobalaena nana. The extinction of megalodon had a positive impact on other apex predators of the time, such as the great white shark, in some cases spreading to regions where megalodon became absent.|$|E
5|$|The false potto (Pseudopotto martini) is a lorisoid primate of {{uncertain}} taxonomic status {{found in}} Africa. Anthropologist Jeffrey H. Schwartz named it in 1996 {{as the only}} species of the genus Pseudopotto {{on the basis of}} two specimens (consisting only of skeletal material) that had previously been identified as pottos (Perodicticus potto). The precise provenances of the two specimens are uncertain, but at least one <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> Cameroon. Schwartz thought the false potto could even represent a separate family, but other researchers have argued that the supposed distinguishing features of the animal do not actually distinguish it from the potto; specifically, the false potto shares several features with West African pottos.|$|E
5|$|The {{origin of}} the name is unclear as it was not built until long after the reign of King John, who died in 1216. Its present name first {{appeared}} in a 1915 publication, The Heart of Mendip by Francis Knight, when it was being run as a saddler's shop. The royal part of the name <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> {{the fact that there}} was a carved king's head on the building, from a time when The King's Head Inn occupied part of the premises, but whether this represented King John or another king is not known. The head was attached to one corner of the exterior, but is now inside the building, and a replica placed on the outside.|$|E
25|$|A {{couple of}} {{apparently}} Spanish or Portuguese roots, ronki (to snore) and iri (to go), <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> directly <b>from</b> Latin. Since Zamenhof's day, {{a large amount}} of Latinate vocabulary has been added to the language. In 1987, Mattos calculated that 84% of basic vocabulary was Latinate, 14% Germanic, and 2% Slavic and Greek.|$|R
50|$|There is {{a popular}} {{misconception}} that the ships were burned rather than sunk. This misconception {{has been attributed to}} the reference made by Cervantes de Salazár in 1546, as to Cortés burning his ships. This <b>may</b> <b>have</b> also <b>come</b> <b>from</b> a mis-translation of the version of the story written in Latin.|$|R
2500|$|Ingelow and Carpenter's work {{uncovered}} a stone capital which dated from the 12th century. [...] It was retained {{and put on}} display in the north aisle, and is the only fragment that definitely survives from the Norman church—although some stone blocks incorporated into the wall of the south aisle <b>may</b> also <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> it.|$|R
5|$|Despite {{its initial}} {{focus on the}} elites, the Union was {{successful}} in raising funds from across French society. Schoolchildren and ordinary citizens gave, as did 181French municipalities. Laboulaye's political allies supported the call, as did descendants of the French contingent in the American Revolutionary War. Less idealistically, contributions came from those who hoped for American support in the French attempt to build the Panama Canal. The copper <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> multiple sources {{and some of it}} is said to have come from a mine in Visnes, Norway, though this has not been conclusively determined after testing samples. According to Cara Sutherland in her book on the statue for the Museum of the City of New York, 90,800 kilos (200,000 pounds) was needed to build the statue, and the French copper industrialist Eugène Secrétan donated 58,100 kilos (128,000 pounds) of copper.|$|E
5|$|Hilary was {{probably}} born around 1110, and was likely of low birth, {{but nothing is}} known of his ancestry. His brother was a canon of Salisbury Cathedral, and they both <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> around Salisbury. Hilary served as a clerk for Henry of Blois, Bishop of Winchester, and as Dean {{of the church of}} Christchurch in Twynham, Hampshire, probably receiving both offices through the influence of Henry of Blois. Christchurch was a collegiate church of secular clergy, or clergy who were not monks, and Hilary was dean of the church by 1139. He was educated as a canon lawyer, and was an advocate, or lawyer, in Rome in 1144. While in Rome, he also served in the papal chancery, or writing office, in 1146. Some of his coworkers in the chancery were Robert Pullen, John of Salisbury, and Nicholas Breakspear who later became pope, as Adrian IV.|$|E
5|$|In the 1190s, {{however, the}} {{struggle}} for power in France began to swing in favour of Philip II, culminating in the Capetian capture of Normandy in 1204. Philip II started to construct completely circular keeps, such as the Tour Jeanne d'Arc, with most built in his newly acquired territories. The first of Philip's new keeps was begun at the Louvre in 1190 and at least another twenty followed, all built to a consistent standard and cost. The architectural idea of circular keeps <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> Catalonia, where circular towers in castles formed a local tradition, and probably carried some military advantages, but Philip's intention in building these new keeps in a fresh style was clearly political, an attempt to demonstrate his new power and authority over his extended territories. As historian Philippe Durand suggests, these keeps provided military security and were a physical representation of the renouveau capétien, or Capetian renewal.|$|E
60|$|In {{the great}} island of Ceram {{there is also}} an {{indigenous}} race very similar to that of Northern Gilolo. Bourn seems to contain two distinct races,--a shorter, round-faced people, with a Malay physiognomy, who <b>may</b> probably <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> Celebes by way of the Sula islands; and a taller bearded race, resembling that of Ceram.|$|R
25|$|Lucio Russo {{has said}} that Plutarch, in his work On the Face in the Moon, was {{reporting}} some physical theories that we consider to be Newtonian and that these <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> originally <b>from</b> Hipparchus; {{he goes on to}} say that Newton <b>may</b> <b>have</b> been influenced by them. According to one book review, both of these claims have been rejected by other scholars.|$|R
25|$|Makovicky re-examined {{the type}} {{specimen}} of Turanoceratops. Nessov had claimed that this genus was a ceratopsid {{because it had}} horns and teeth with two roots, but Makovicky found that the teeth were single rooted after all and the supposed eye-horn <b>may</b> actually <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> and armored dinosaur. Since it had no good distinguishing traits, Makovicky regarded the genus as dubious.|$|R
