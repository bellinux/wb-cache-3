5|$|Three {{independent}} {{hydraulic systems}} are {{installed on the}} 757, one powered by each engine, and the third using electric pumps. A ram air turbine is fitted to provide power for essential controls {{in the event of}} an emergency. A basic form of fly-by-wire facilitates spoiler operation, utilizing electric signaling instead of traditional control cables. The fly-by-wire system, shared with the 767, reduces weight and provides for the independent operation of individual spoilers. When equipped for extended-range operations, the 757 features a backup hydraulic <b>motor</b> <b>generator</b> and an additional cooling fan in the aircraft's electronics bay.|$|E
5|$|Since {{he did not}} post a {{lap time}} within 107% of the fastest time during Q1, Jenson Button was {{required}} {{to apply to the}} race stewards to be allowed to the start the race; they granted him permission to do so. After qualifying, McLaren had to fit his car with a fifth heat <b>motor</b> <b>generator</b> unit (MGU-H) and a fifth turbo charger for the season. As this exceeded the limit of four units per power unit element, Button was later handed ten-place and five-place grid penalties. As he was already due to start {{from the back of the}} grid, the penalty was substituted with a drive-through penalty, to be served within the first three laps of the race.|$|E
5|$|The {{incident}} allowed Jani to {{move into}} the lead but di Grassi stopped at Farm Curve with a <b>motor</b> <b>generator</b> unit problem shortly afterwards. His team's mechanics were allowed to tend to the Audi after travelling via a course car, extending the full course yellow as it was tended to. Di Grassi's race ended prematurely and one of the mechanics used a fire extinguisher to extinguish smoke bellowing from his car. The race resumed after 23 minutes with Tréluyer attacking Lieb, and upon being delayed by the No. 13 Rebellion Racing car, passed him {{to move into}} the lead on the approach to Maggots corner and pulled away on the Hangar straight. Rast stopped at the entrance of Maggots corner with a fuel pump pressure failure, causing him to lose the LMP2 lead to Watts and rejoined the field in third place in class. Rast recovered and passed Senna for second in LMP2 by using the grass at Stowe corner. Tréluyer was blocked by slower traffic allowing Lieb to close up to him on the Wellington straight. Lieb could not overtake because he was delayed by a pack of LMP2 cars. Rast closed up to Watts and overtook him to retake the LMP2 lead. Tréluyer and Lieb ran closely between each other before the former pulled away from Lieb.|$|E
50|$|Disadvantages of <b>motor</b> <b>generators</b> include lower efficiency, {{generally}} between 83% (lightly loaded machine) and 92% (fully loaded machine). In comparison, cycloconverter efficiency can exceed 95%. Also, <b>motor</b> <b>generators</b> {{require more}} routine maintenance due their nature as rotating machines, given the bearings and slip rings. Today, the outright replacement of <b>motor</b> <b>generators</b> {{would also be}} difficult due to the high manufacturing cost and limited demand for these large 25 Hz machines.|$|R

25|$|On September 7, 1927, Philo Farnsworth's image {{dissector}} camera tube transmitted its first image, a simple straight line, at his laboratory at 202 Green Street in San Francisco. By September 3, 1928, Farnsworth had developed the system sufficiently to hold a demonstration for the press. This {{is widely regarded as}} the first electronic television demonstration. In 1929, the system was further improved by elimination of a <b>motor</b> <b>generator,</b> so that his television system now had no mechanical parts. That year, Farnsworth transmitted the first live human images with his system, including a three and a half-inch image of his wife Elma ("Pem") with her eyes closed (possibly due to the bright lighting required).|$|E
500|$|First, the {{turbocharger}} {{was split}} and positioned alongside the <b>Motor</b> <b>Generator</b> Unit-Heat (MGU-H)—the generator harvesting heat {{energy from the}} exhaust manifold used to power the turbine—and positioned within the cylinder banks forming the 'V' configuration of the engine. In order to make this fit, Honda eschewed {{the use of a}} centrifugal fan in its single-stage compressor in favour of using several smaller fans positioned at intervals along a shaft. Although this would limit the ability of the turbocharger to build up the maximum amount of boost pressure, the 100kg/h fuel flow limit introduced in 2014 minimised the impact of this. The <b>Motor</b> <b>Generator</b> Unit-Kinetic (MGU-K)—the generator harvesting energy from the engine spinning while under braking—was positioned in front of the engine to deliver energy directly to the crankshaft, following the convention established with the introduction of the kinetic energy recovery system in [...] The batteries housing the energy harvested by the MGU-H and MGU-K were merged with the Electronic Control Unit and positioned in front of the engine. Both the MGU-H and MGU-K were capable of harvesting [...] of energy per lap. However, under the 2015 regulations, both systems could only deploy [...] of energy per lap.|$|E

500|$|With each engine {{manufacturer}} on the 2015 grid being granted some limited scope {{to develop their}} engines, McLaren and Honda were given some leeway to develop the RA615H power unit before it was required to be homologated despite having had eighteen months of uninterrupted development prior to the first race. Under the 2015 regulations, the power units were divided into thirty-two areas for development, and Honda were given permission to develop nine {{over the course of}} the season. The first engine updates were introduced at the , aimed at improving the reliability of the <b>motor</b> <b>generator</b> units, but by mid-season, the engine was reported to be producing [...] less power than the Mercedes PU106B Hybrid engine, the benchmark of the 2015 grid.|$|E
500|$|A unique launch system propels riders up the [...] hill. The {{system was}} {{developed}} by Universal Creative and MTS Systems Corporation. A prototype launch system was designed by January 1995. The prototype consisted {{of a series of}} boxcars welded together to form a launch tunnel. A track-mounted dune buggy was then propelled inside the tunnel {{through the use of a}} weight drop launch mechanism. The designers then experimented with different rates of acceleration, each emitting between one and five times the force of gravity. The final system which was implemented on The Incredible Hulk sees trains launch from 0 to [...] in 2 seconds. Riders travel at an angle of 30 degrees through a [...] tunnel, pulling 1G. To power this launch the designers investigated a variety of systems ranging from hydraulic, pneumatic, cable, steam catapult, and conveyor belt. In the end a drive tire system was selected, where 230 electrical motors power a set of tires that pinch the train's underside to provide propulsion. As this system required eight megawatts of power to launch a train, the park built several customized <b>motor</b> <b>generator</b> sets with large flywheels. Without these stored energy units, they would have had to build a whole substation and risk browning-out the local energy grid with every launch. The launch system made The Incredible Hulk the only B ride to feature a launch, until Thunderbird opened at Holiday World in 2015. Unlike The Incredible Hulk, Thunderbird uses a Linear Synchronous Motors (LSM) launch system that was designed by B ...|$|E

2500|$|The 2014 season saw the {{introduction}} of a new engine formula, with turbocharged engines returning to the sport {{for the first time since}} [...] The new engines were a 1.6-litre V6 format with an 8-speed semi-automatic gearbox. The rules dictated the use of a ninety-degree engine bank, with fixed crankshaft and mounting points for the chassis, while the engines were limited to 15,000 rpm. Individual engine units under the 2014 specifications had to last for at least [...] before being replaced, in comparison to the pre-2014 engines, which were required to last for just [...] The engines, now known as [...] "power units", were divided into six separate components: the internal combustion engine (ICE); turbocharger (TC); <b>Motor</b> <b>Generator</b> Unit-Kinetic (MGU-K), which harvested energy that would normally be wasted under braking; <b>Motor</b> <b>Generator</b> Unit-Heat (MGU-H), which collected energy in the form of heat as it was expelled through the exhaust; Energy Store (ES), which functioned as batteries, holding the energy gathered by the <b>Motor</b> <b>Generator</b> Units; and Control Electronics (CE), which included the Electronic Control Unit and software used to manage the entire power unit.|$|E

2500|$|In 2017, the FIA began {{negotiations}} with existing constructors and potential new manufacturers {{over the next}} generation of engines with a projected introduction date of 2021. The initial proposal was designed to simplify engine designs, cut costs, promote new entries and address criticisms directed at the 2014 generation of engines. It called for the 1.6L V6 configuration to be retained, but abandoned the complex <b>Motor</b> <b>Generator</b> UnitHeat (MGU-H) system. The <b>Motor</b> <b>Generator</b> UnitKinetic (MGU-K) would be more powerful, with a greater emphasis on driver deployment and a more flexible introduction to allow for tactical use. The proposal also called for the introduction of standardised components and design parameters to make components produced by all manufacturers compatible with one another in a system dubbed [...] "plug in and play". A further proposal to allow four-wheel drive cars was also tabled, with the front axle driven by an MGU-K unitas opposed to the traditional driveshaftthat functioned independently of the MGU-K providing power to the rear axle, mirroring the system developed by Porsche for the 919 Hybrid sportscar.|$|E
2500|$|The {{kinetic energy}} {{recovery}} system—known from [...] to 2013 as KERS, and renamed from 2014 as ERS-K—was incorporated into {{the design of the}} engine and its usage increased; its function as a supplementary power source was taken by the introduction of the heat-based energy recovery system (ERS). The ERS unit captured waste heat as it was dispelled from the exhaust turbocharger, using an electrical device known as a heat <b>motor</b> <b>generator</b> unit. This waste heat was stored as an electrical charge until it was used by a complementary system called the kinetic <b>motor</b> <b>generator</b> unit. This device was connected directly to the drive train to deliver the additional power in the most direct and efficient way. In combination with the ERS-K it gave drivers an additional [...] for thirty-three seconds per lap, compared to the KERS units used prior to 2014, which gave drivers [...] for six seconds per lap. This energy was released into the powertrain by the electronic control unit (ECU) to promote the most efficient and effective application of the power, but the driver had the ability to manually override the ECU and use the remaining available power instantly.|$|E
