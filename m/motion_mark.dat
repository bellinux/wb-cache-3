40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{correlation}} of two successive scalar images {{for the purpose of}} measuring imaged fluid motions. A method is presented for deforming, or transforming, one image to another. Taylor series expansions of the Lagrangian displacement field are used, in conjunction with an integral form of the equations of motion, to approximate this transformation. The proposed method locally correlates images for displacements, rotations, deformations, and higher order displacement gradient fields, and applies a global minimization procedure to insure a global consistency in the results. An integral form of the equations of motion is employed and, as a consequence, no explicit spatial or temporal differentiation of the image data is required in estimating the displacement field. As a consequence, this method is appropriate for both continuous scalar as well as discrete particle image data. Successive two-dimensional digital CCD images of fluid <b>motion</b> <b>marked</b> with dye, are used to verify the capabilities of the method. The utility of the method is also illustrated using a pair of Voyager 2 images of Jupiter...|$|R

40|$|For {{the past}} 10 years, I have been {{exploring}} {{different approaches to}} and understandings of subjective mapping and place making. My early works explored the intersections between artefact, space, identity, and creativity through the making of installations and artefacts. My inquiry evolved to include explorations of the body as the mapping tool that both records space and, through its actions or practices, makes place (de Certeau). In order to notice transitions, I drew on methods of documentation and observation for these inquiries. I framed them within possibilities for discovery that the peripheral—and peripheral vision in particular—hold (Vaughan 2013). The Contemplative Atlas of Transition is the next evolution in this exploration. In this, I move from {{a focus on the}} linear narrative of the body in <b>motion</b> <b>marking</b> its presence in space like a line on a surface, or a crafted artefact recording the trajectories of others, to what is now a non-linear multiscreen representation of different places.

40|$|Large-sized {{free-form surface}} design {{presents}} some challenges in practice. Especially at the conceptual design stage, sculpting physical models is still essential for surface development, because CAD models are less intuitive for designers {{to design and}} modify them. These sculpted physical models can be then scanned and converted into CAD models. However, if the physical models are too big, designers may have problems in finding a suitable position to conduct their operations or simply the models are difficult to be scanned in. We investigated a novel surface modelling approach by utilising a 3 D motion capture system. For designing a large-sized surface, a network of splines is initially set up. Artists or designers wearing <b>motion</b> <b>marks</b> on their hands can then change shapes of the splines with their hands. Literally they can move their body freely to any positions to perform their tasks. They can also move their hands in 3 D free space to detail surface characteristics by their gestures. All their design motions are recorded in the motion capturing system and transferred into 3 D curves and surfaces correspondingly. This paper reports this novel surface design method associated with some case studies...|$|R

The <b>motion</b> is <b>marked</b> by the relations basic for quantum mechanics: E=hν and Mv_ 0 = h/ particle along the trajectory, i. e. the interval at which the velocity of the particle is periodically altered from v_ 0 to 0 and then from 0 to v_ 0; transition to wave mechanics where λ manifests itself as the de Broglie wavelength and ν is the distinctive frequency of the "particle-wave". A prerequisite for the wave solution to be Lorentz-invariant is treated. A hypothesis for a plausible hydrodynamic description of the relativistic particle motion is covered...|$|R

40|$|In this dissertation, I {{argue that}} the fantasy imagery of tum-of-the-century British illustrators Arthur Rackham, Aubrey Beardsley, and Sidney Sime, and French filmmakers Georges Méliès and Emile Cohl {{functions}} as visual rhetorical "texts" that explicate contemporaneous ideas about the self. At the fin de siecle, models of the self were shaped, in part, by scientific thought that interrogated themes of materiality and immateriality, visibility and invisibility, univalence and multivalence, permanence and impermanence. Dream Work grapples with these oppositions, the questions they brought up, and the provisional answers they elicited. I argue that both the science and the design considered in this study dealt with these oppositions, and the models of the self they elaborated, through a shared visual rhetoric of literal representation or hazy abstraction. I reveal this shared visual rhetoric through analysis of {{the form of the}} design considered in this study and its relationship to visual aspects of contemporaneous scientific discourse. I first show how Rackham's imagery, which echoes the visual vocabulary of physiognomical diagrams, deals with material aspects of self and mind. But Rackham's work likewise positions the mind as part of a grand continuum with the natural world. I describe the ways that Beardsley's imagery fluctuates between expression of material and ethereal elaborations of the self manifested in contemporaneous dream theory. And I show how Sime's imagery - which mirrors late nineteenth-century notions of the realms of other dimensions - probes abstract qualities of the self in strangely material forms. Finally, I discuss the ways that the mystifying abstraction that characterizes tum-of-the-century ideas about time, space, and <b>motion</b> <b>marks</b> the mutable selves expressed in Méliès and Cohl's work. In this dissertation, I likewise challenge the hegemony of the written word and of verbal analytical methods for interpreting visual entities. My goal, however, is not to dispense with the verbal analysis of visual artifacts. Rather, my intention is to foreground visual rhetorical analysis as a powerful method for understanding the visuality of both visual and verbal entities...|$|R
