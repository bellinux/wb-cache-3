25|$|Blue monkey beetles are {{important}} pollinators of the Namaqualand region, especially for <b>Mesembryanthemum</b> and some daisy species, {{on which they}} primarily feed.|$|E
25|$|Flowers of {{the genus}} <b>Mesembryanthemum</b> are common hosts of S. trimeni, as are many of the African daisy species and some Heliophila. For many of these visited species, monkey beetles are key pollinators, {{responsible}} for most of the pollination that takes place.|$|E
25|$|The islands {{with the}} {{greatest}} floristic diversity are East and West Wallabi Islands, with 124 and 97 species respectively. 54 species occur in all three island groups. The most widely distributed species are Nitraria billardierei (nitre bush), which has been recorded on 106 islands; the exotic <b>Mesembryanthemum</b> crystallinum (iceplant), on 88 islands; Threlkeldia diffusa (coast bonefruit), on 72 islands; and Atriplex cinerea (grey saltbush), on 70 islands. On the other hand, Eucalyptus oraria (ooragmandee) and Acacia didyma occur only on East Wallabi Island.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Mesembryanthemums</b> {{are often}} {{cultivated}} as ornamental plants for their showy flowers. Ornamental plants may escape {{into the wild}} and consequently has become widely naturalized outside their native range. They are considered an invasive weed in certain places.|$|R
50|$|Cornwall {{is home to}} many rare flower species, {{especially}} {{at the southern end}} of the Lizard, due to its unique soil and geology. On the Lizard Peninsula, Cornish heath - the floral emblem of Cornwall - <b>mesembryanthemums,</b> butcher's broom, early meadow grass and a wide range of clovers including the Lizard clover, brookweed and yellow wallpepper can be found. The north coast of Cornwall features maritime grassland, heathland and stunted woodland.|$|R
50|$|In {{the swamp}} regions of {{north-east}} Africa papyrus and associated plants, including the soft-wooded ambach, flourish in immense quantities, {{and little else}} {{is found in the}} way of vegetation. South Africa is largely destitute of forest save in the lower valleys and coast regions. Tropical flora disappears, and in the semi-desert plains the fleshy, leafless, contorted species of kapsias, <b>mesembryanthemums,</b> aloes and other succulent plants make their appearance. There are, too, valuable timber trees, such as the Yellow-wood (Podocarpus elongatus), stinkwood (Ocotea), sneezewood or Cape ebony (Pteroxylon utile) and ironwood. Extensive miniature woods of heaths are found in almost endless variety and covered throughout the greater part of the year with innumerable blossoms in which red is very prevalent. Of the grasses of Africa alfa is very abundant in the plateaus of the Atlas range.|$|R
2500|$|In 1907 De Beers {{chairman}} Francis Oats built Porthledden House, a [...] {{country house}} modelled on Groote Schuur, at Cape Cornwall. The ore sorting floors were converted into greenhouses and wineries, while the surrounding cliffs were planted with <b>mesembryanthemum</b> beds.|$|E

6000|$|These {{two species}} (<b>Mesembryanthemum</b> and Crassicornis) are quite {{beautiful}} {{enough to give}} a beginner amusement: {{but there are two}} others which are not uncommon, and of such exceeding loveliness, that it is worth while to take a little trouble to get them. The one is Dianthus, which I have already mentioned; the other Bellis, the sea-daisy, of which there is an excellent description and plates in Mr. Gosse's [...] "Rambles in Devon," [...] pp. 24 to 32.|$|E
5000|$|The Karoo {{formed an}} almost impenetrable {{barrier to the}} {{interior}} from Cape Town, and the early adventurers, explorers, hunters and travelers {{on the way to}} the Highveld unanimously denounced it as a frightening place of great heat, great frosts, great floods and great droughts. Today it is still a place of great heat and frosts, and an annual rainfall of between 50 - 250 mm, though on some of the mountains it can be 250 - 500 mm higher than on the plains. However, underground water is found throughout the Karoo, which can be tapped by boreholes, making permanent settlements and sheep farming possible. [...] The xerophytic vegetation consists of aloes, <b>mesembryanthemums,</b> crassulas, euphorbias, stapelias, and desert ephemerals, spaced 50 cm or more apart, and becoming very sparse going northwards into Bushmanland and, from there, into the Kalahari Desert. The driest region of the Karoo, however, is its southwestern corner, between the Great Escarpment and the Cederberg-Skurweberg mountain ranges, called the Tankwa Karoo, which receives only 75 mm of rain annually. The eastern and north-eastern Karoo are often covered by large patches of grassland. The typical Karoo vegetation used to support large game, sometimes in vast herds.|$|R
60|$|The {{group is}} too windy for cereals, but it grows spontaneously orchil and barilla (<b>Mesembryanthemum</b> nodiflorum), burnt for soda. Few strangers visit it, and many old {{residents}} have never attempted the excursion. It is not, however, unknown to sportsmen, who land--with leave--upon the main island and shoot the handsome 'Deserta petrels,' the cagarras (Puffinus major, or sheerwater), the rabbits, the goats that have now run wild, {{and possibly a}} seal. A poisonous spider is here noticed by the guide-books, and the sea supplies the edible pulvo (octopus) and the dreaded urgamanta. This huge ray (?) enwraps the swimmer in its mighty double flaps and drags him to the bottom, paralysing him by the wet shroud and the dreadful stare of its hideous eyes.|$|E
6000|$|Mervo {{was looking}} its best under the hot morning sun. Mr. Scobell's villa {{stood near the}} summit of the only hill the island possessed, and from the window of the morning-room, where he had just {{finished}} breakfast, he had an uninterrupted view of valley, town, and harbor--a two-mile riot of green, gold and white, and beyond the white the blue satin of the Mediterranean. Mr. Scobell did not read poetry except that which advertised certain breakfast foods in which he was interested, or he might have been reminded of the Island of Flowers in Tennyson's [...] "Voyage of Maeldive." [...] Violets, pinks, crocuses, yellow and purple <b>mesembryanthemum,</b> lavender, myrtle, and rosemary ... his two-mile view contained them all. The hillside below him was all aglow with the yellow fire of the mimosa. But his was not one of those emotional natures to which the meanest flower that blows can give thoughts that do often lie too deep for tears. A primrose by the river's brim a simple primrose was to him--or not so much a simple primrose, perhaps, as a basis for a possible Primrosina, the Soap that Really Cleans You.|$|E
6000|$|The truly {{indigenous}} {{flowering plants}} are about fifty in number, besides twenty-six ferns. Forty {{of the former}} and ten of the latter are absolutely peculiar to the island, and, as Sir Joseph Hooker tells us, [...] "with scarcely an exception, cannot be regarded as very close specific allies of any other plants at all. Seventeen of them belong to peculiar genera, and of the others, all differ so markedly as species from their congeners, that not one comes {{under the category of}} being an insular form of a continental species." [...] The affinities of this flora are, Sir Joseph Hooker thinks, {307} mainly African and especially South African, as indicated by the presence of the genera Phylica, Pelargonium, <b>Mesembryanthemum,</b> Oteospermum, and Wahlenbergia, which are eminently characteristic of southern extra-tropical Africa. The sixteen ferns which are not peculiar are common either to Africa, India, or America, a wide range sufficiently explained by the dust-like spores of ferns, capable of being carried to unknown distances by the wind, and the great stability of their generic and specific forms, many of those found in the Miocene deposits of Switzerland, being hardly distinguishable from living species. This shows, that identity of species of ferns between St. Helena and distant countries does not necessarily imply a recent origin.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Mesembryanthemum</b> is a genus of {{flowering}} {{plants in the}} family Aizoaceae; like many members of this family, it is characterized by long-lasting flower heads. Flowers of <b>Mesembryanthemum</b> protect their gametes from night-time dews or frosts but open in sunlight. There is an obvious evolutionary advantage to doing this; where sun, dew, frost, wind or predators are likely to damage exposed reproductive organs, closing may be advantageous during times when flowers are unlikely to attract pollinators. It is indigenous to southern Africa.|$|E
