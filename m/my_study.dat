25|$|When evening comes, I go back home, {{and go to}} <b>my</b> <b>study.</b> On the threshold, I {{take off}} my work clothes, covered in mud and filth, and I put on the clothes an {{ambassador}} would wear. Decently dressed, I enter the ancient courts of rulers who have long since died. There, I am warmly welcomed, and I feed on the only food I find nourishing and was born to savour. I am not ashamed {{to talk to them}} and ask them to explain their actions and they, out of kindness, answer me. Four hours go by without my feeling any anxiety. I forget every worry. I am no longer afraid of poverty or frightened of death. I live entirely through them.|$|E
25|$|After my father's {{appointment}} by {{his homeland}} as state {{official in the}} customs house of Bugia for the Pisan merchants who thronged to it, he took charge; and in view of its future usefulness and convenience, had me in my boyhood come to him and there wanted me to devote myself to and be instructed {{in the study of}} calculation for some days. There, following my introduction, as a consequence of marvelous instruction in the art, to the nine digits of the Hindus, the knowledge of the art very much appealed to me before all others, and for it I realized that all its aspects were studied in Egypt, Syria, Greece, Sicily, and Provence, with their varying methods; and at these places thereafter, while on business. I pursued <b>my</b> <b>study</b> in depth and learned the give-and-take of disputation. But all this even, and the algorism, as well as the art of Pythagoras, I considered as almost a mistake in respect to the method of the Hindus (Modus Indorum). Therefore, embracing more stringently that method of the Hindus, and taking stricter pains in its study, while adding certain things from my own understanding and inserting also certain things from the niceties of Euclid's geometric art. I have striven to compose this book in its entirety as understandably as I could, dividing it into fifteen chapters. Almost everything which I have introduced I have displayed with exact proof, in order that those further seeking this knowledge, with its pre-eminent method, might be instructed, and further, in order that the Latin people might not be discovered to be without it, as they have been up to now. If I have perchance omitted anything more or less proper or necessary, I beg indulgence, since there is no one who is blameless and utterly provident in all things. The nine Indian figures are: 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1. With these nine figures, and with the sign 0... any number may be written.|$|E
500|$|The {{penetration}} of the bride's infibulation takes anywhere from 3 or 4 days to several months. Some men are unable to penetrate their wives at all (in <b>my</b> <b>study</b> over 15%), and the task is often accomplished by a midwife under conditions of great secrecy, since this reflects negatively on the man's potency. Some {{who are unable to}} penetrate their wives manage to get them pregnant in spite of the infibulation, and the woman's vaginal passage is then cut open to allow birth to take place.... Those men who do manage to penetrate their wives do so often, or perhaps always, {{with the help of the}} [...] "little knife". This creates a tear which they gradually rip more and more until the opening is sufficient to admit the penis.|$|E

500|$|In early 1850, Dickinson {{wrote that}} [...] "Amherst is alive with fun this winter ... Oh, {{a very great}} town this is!" [...] Her high spirits soon turned to melancholy after another death. The Amherst Academy principal, Leonard Humphrey, died {{suddenly}} of [...] "brain congestion" [...] at age 25. Two years after his death, she revealed to her friend Abiah Root the extent of her depression:some {{of my friends are}} gone, and some of my friends are sleeping– sleeping the churchyard sleep– the hour of evening is sad– it was once <b>my</b> <b>study</b> hour– my master has gone to rest, and the open leaf of the book, and the scholar at school alone, make the tears come, and I cannot brush them away; I would not if I could, for they are the only tribute I can pay the departed Humphrey.|$|E

2500|$|Tyler {{has clearly}} spelled out the {{importance}} of her characters to her stories: [...] “As far as I’m concerned, character is everything. I never did see why I have to throw in a plot, too.” [...] In an earlier (1977) interview, she stated that “the real joy of writing is how people can surprise one. My people wander around <b>my</b> <b>study</b> until the novel is done. It’s one reason I’m {{very careful not to}} write about people I don’t like. If I find somebody creeping in that I’m not really fond of, I usually take him out.” [...] Pollitt had even earlier noted how Tyler’s characters seem to take on {{a life of their own}} that she doesn’t seem to totally control: “Her complex, crotchety inventions surprise us, but one senses they surprise her too.” ...|$|E

2500|$|Although {{the latter}} part of his life was spent entirely abroad, Cronin {{retained}} a great affection for the district of his childhood, writing in 1972 to a local teacher: [...] "Although I have travelled the world over I must say in all sincerity that my heart belongs to Dumbarton. ... In <b>my</b> <b>study</b> there is a beautiful 17th century coloured print of the Rock... I even follow with great fervour the fortunes of the Dumbarton football team." [...] Further evidence of Cronin's lifelong support of Dumbarton F.C. comes from a framed typewritten letter hanging in the foyer of the club's stadium. In the letter, written in 1972 and addressed to the club's then secretary, Cronin congratulates Dumbarton on their return to the top division after an absence of 50 years and recalls his childhood supporting the Sons (the club's nickname) and on occasion being [...] "lifted over" [...] the turnstiles (a common practice in times past so that children did not have to pay).|$|E
2500|$|James Worsdale's A Cure for a Scold {{is also a}} ballad opera. First {{performed}} at Drury Lane in 1735, starring Kitty Clive and Charles Macklin, A Cure for a Scold was an adaptation of Lacy's Sauny the Scot rather than Shakespeare's original Taming of the Shrew. Petruchio was renamed Manly, and Katherina was renamed Margaret (nicknamed Peg). At the end, there is no wager. Instead, Peg pretends she is dying, and as Petruchio runs for a doctor, she reveals she is fine, and declares [...] "you have taught me what 'tis to be a Wife, and I shall make it <b>my</b> <b>Study</b> to be obliging and obedient," [...] to which Manly replies [...] "My best Peg, we will exchange Kindness, and be each others Servants." [...] After the play has finished, the actress playing Peg steps forward and speaks directly to the audience as herself; [...] "Well, I must own, it wounds me to the Heart/To play, unwomanly, so mean a Part./What – to submit, so tamely – so contented,/Thank Heav'n! I'm not the Thing I represented." ...|$|E
2500|$|As a {{lecturer}} and orator, Emerson—nicknamed the Sage of Concord—became the leading voice of intellectual {{culture in the}} United States. James Russell Lowell, editor of the Atlantic Monthly and the North American Review, commented in his book <b>My</b> <b>Study</b> Windows (1871), that Emerson {{was not only the}} [...] "most steadily attractive lecturer in America," [...] but also [...] "one of the pioneers of the lecturing system." [...] Herman Melville, who had met Emerson in 1849, originally thought he had [...] "a defect in the region of the heart" [...] and a [...] "self-conceit so intensely intellectual that at first one hesitates to call it by its right name", though he later admitted Emerson was [...] "a great man". Theodore Parker, a minister and transcendentalist, noted Emerson's ability to influence and inspire others: [...] "the brilliant genius of Emerson rose in the winter nights, and hung over Boston, drawing the eyes of ingenuous young people to look up to that great new star, a beauty and a mystery, which charmed for the moment, while it gave also perennial inspiration, as it led them forward along new paths, and towards new hopes".|$|E
