40|$|In this work, Stroh's {{formalism}} is {{endowed with}} causal properties {{on the basis}} of an analysis of the radiation condition in the Green tensor of the elastodynamic wave equation. The modified formalism is applied to dislocations moving uniformly in an anisotropic medium. In practice, accounting for causality amounts to a simple analytic continuation procedure whereby to the dislocation velocity is added an infinitesimal positive imaginary part. This device allows for a straightforward computation of velocity-dependent field expressions that are valid whatever the dislocation velocity [...] -including supersonic regimes [...] - without needing to consider subsonic and supersonic cases separately. As an illustration, the distortion field of a Somigliana dislocation of the Peierls-Nabarro-Eshelby-type with finite-width core is computed analytically, starting from the Green tensor of elastodynamics. To obtain the result {{in the form of a}} single compact expression, use of the modified Stroh formalism requires splitting the Green function into its reactive and radiative parts.

50|$|CD= CD,O + KCL2Where CDO {{is the sum}} of C(D,friction) and C D,thickness, and k for {{supersonic}} flow {{is a function of the}} Mach number. The skin-friction component is derived from the presence of a viscous boundary layer which is infinitely close to the surface of the aircraft body. At the boundary wall, the normal component of velocity is zero; therefore an infinitesimal area exists where there is no slip. The zero-lift wave drag component can be obtained based on the supersonic area rule which tells us that the wave-drag of an aircraft in a steady {{supersonic flow}} is identical to the average of a series of equivalent bodies of revolution. The bodies of revolution are defined by the cuts through the aircraft made by the tangent to the fore <b>Mach</b> <b>cone</b> from a distant point of the aircraft at an azimuthal angle.
