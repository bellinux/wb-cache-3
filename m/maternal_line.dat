5|$|Joy Ibsen, {{a retired}} journalist, died in 2008, leaving three children: Michael, Jeff and Leslie. On 24 August 2012, her son Michael (born in Canada in 1957, a cabinet maker based in London) gave a mouth-swab sample to the {{research}} team to compare with samples from the human remains found at the excavation. Analysts found a mitochondrial DNA match between the exhumed skeleton, Michael Ibsen, and an unnamed second direct <b>maternal</b> <b>line</b> descendant, who shares a relatively rare mitochondrial DNA sequence, mitochondrial DNA haplogroup J1c2c.|$|E
5|$|Nettlecombe {{has never}} been bought or sold. It was held before the Norman Conquest by Prince Godwine, son of King Harold. William the Conqueror assumed {{possession}} of Nettlecombe after defeating King Harold at the Battle of Hastings. In 1160, Henry II granted it to Hugh de Raleigh, and to his heirs in perpetuity. It passed to Warine de Raleigh, and on through direct blood heirs until the 19th century, a claim strengthened by marriages between deep ancestral cousins. The estate became a seat of the Trevelyan baronets (previously spelled as Trevilian), who also held another manor at Basil, by the marriage of Sir John Trevilian in 1481 to Lady Whalesborough, heiress of Nettlecombe via her Raleigh <b>maternal</b> <b>line.</b> Nettlecombe was held in continuity by Trevilian successors until the 20th century {{following the death of}} Joan Trevelyan and her husband Garnet Wolsey.|$|E
5|$|A {{haplotype}} is a {{group of}} genes found in an organism that are inherited together from one of their parents. A haplogroup {{is a group}} of similar haplotypes that share a single mutation inherited from their common ancestor. Mitochondrial DNA (mDNA) passes along the <b>maternal</b> <b>line</b> and can date back thousands of years. A 2005 study compared the mitochondrial DNA sequences of modern wolves with those from thirty-four specimens dated between 1856 and 1915. The historic population was found to possess twice the genetic diversity of modern wolves, which suggests that the mDNA diversity of the wolves eradicated from the western US was more than twice that of the modern population. A 2007 study compared mDNA sequences of modern wolves with those from Beringian wolves. The twenty Beringian wolves yielded sixteen haplotypes that could not be found in modern wolves, compared with seven haplotypes that were found in thirty-two modern Alaskan and Yukon wolves. This finding indicates that Beringian wolves were genetically distinct from modern wolves and possessed greater genetic diversity, and that there once existed in North America a larger wolf population than today.|$|E

40|$|International audienceSequencing of the mtDNA {{control region}} (385 or 695 bp) of 212  Lipizzans from eight studs {{revealed}} 37 haplotypes. Distribution of haplotypes among studs was biased, including many private haplotypes {{but only one}} haplotype was present in all the studs. According to historical data, numerous Lipizzan <b>maternal</b> <b>lines</b> originating from founder mares of different breeds have been established during the breed's history, so the broad genetic base of the Lipizzan <b>maternal</b> <b>lines</b> was expected. A comparison of Lipizzan sequences with 136 sequences of domestic- and wild-horses from GenBank showed a clustering of Lipizzan haplotypes {{in the majority of}} haplotype subgroups present in other domestic horses. We assume that haplotypes identical to haplotypes of early domesticated horses can be found in several Lipizzan <b>maternal</b> <b>lines</b> as well as in other breeds. Therefore, domestic horses could arise either from a single large population or from several populations provided there were strong migrations during the early phase after domestication. A comparison of Lipizzan haplotypes with 56 <b>maternal</b> <b>lines</b> (according to the pedigrees) showed a disagreement of biological parentage with pedigree data for at least 11 % of the Lipizzans. A distribution of haplotype-frequencies was unequal (0. 2 %- 26 %), mainly due to pedigree errors and haplotype sharing among founder mares...|$|R

40|$|Intra-specific {{variation}} in host-plant quality affects herbivore foraging decisions and, in turn, herbivore foraging decisions mediate plant fitness. In particular, {{variation in}} defenses against herbivores, both among and within plants, shapes herbivore behavior. If variation in defenses is genetically based, it {{can respond to}} natural selection by herbivores. We quantified intra-specific variation in iridoid glycosides, trichome length, and leaf strength in common mullein (Verbascum thapsus L, Scrophulariaceae) among <b>maternal</b> <b>lines</b> within a population and among leaves within plants, and related this variation to feeding preferences of a generalist herbivore, Trichopulsia ni Hübner. We found significant variation in all three defenses among <b>maternal</b> <b>lines,</b> with T. ni preferring plants with lower investment in chemical, but not mechanical, defense. Within plants, old leaves had lower levels of all defenses than young leaves, and were strongly preferred by T. ni. Caterpillars also preferred leaves with trichomes removed to leaves with trichomes intact. Differences among <b>maternal</b> <b>lines</b> indicate that phenotypic variation in defenses likely has a genetic basis. Furthermore, these results reveal that the feeding behaviors of T. ni map onto variation in plant defense in a predictable way. This work {{highlights the importance of}} variation in host...|$|R

40|$|The Polish Primitive Horse (PPH, Konik) is a Polish native horse breed managed {{through a}} {{conservation}} program mainly {{due to its}} characteristic phenotype of a primitive horse. One {{of the most important}} goals of PPH breeding strategy is the preservation and equal development of all existing <b>maternal</b> <b>lines.</b> However, until now there was no investigation into the real genetic diversity of 16 recognized PPH dam lines using mtDNA sequence variation. Herein, we describe the phylogenetic relationships between the PPH <b>maternal</b> <b>lines</b> based upon partial mtDNA D-loop sequencing of 173 individuals. Altogether, 19 mtDNA haplotypes were detected in the PPH population. Five haplotypes were putatively novel while the remaining 14 showed the 100 % homology with sequences deposited in the GenBank database, represented by both modern and primitive horse breeds. Generally, comparisons found the haplotypes conformed to 10 different recognized mtDNA haplogroups (A, B, E, G, J, M, N, P, Q and R). A multi-breed analysis has indicated the phylogenetic similarity of PPH and other indigenous horse breeds derived from various geographical regions (e. g., Iberian Peninsula, Eastern Europe and Siberia) which may support the hypothesis that within the PPH breed numerous ancestral haplotypes (found all over the world) are still present. Only in the case of five <b>maternal</b> <b>lines</b> (Bona, Dzina I, Geneza, Popielica and Zaza) was the segregation of one specific mtDNA haplotype observed. The 11 remaining lines showed a higher degree of mtDNA haplotype variability (2 – 5 haplotypes segregating in each line). This study has revealed relatively high maternal genetic diversity in the small, indigenous PPH breed (19 haplotypes, overall HapD = 0. 92). However, only some traditionally distinguished <b>maternal</b> <b>lines</b> can be treated as genetically pure. The rest show evidence of numerous mistakes recorded in the official PPH pedigrees. This study has proved the importance of maternal genetic diversity monitoring based upon the application of molecular mtDNA markers and can be useful for proper management of the PPH conservation program in the future...|$|R

Genetic diversity {{plays a major role in}} the long-term viability of most endangered species, as their populations are small, however, little is known about the genetic diversity in populations of P. hirtus. Seed viability studies are one way to quantify genetic diversity, as germination is one of the many traits that can be observed indicating variation between individuals. Observing a wide range in traits among <b>maternal</b> <b>lines</b> indicates that there is a wide range in genetic variation within the population. We conducted these studies in the OSU greenhouses to examine variation in germination of <b>maternal</b> <b>lines</b> in four populations. Unexpected findings indicate that P. hirtus expresses dormancy, and that this dormancy is most effectively broken with cold stratification. Total germination was highest (and had the highest range) from <b>maternal</b> <b>lines</b> with the largest populations, and the highest assumed genetic diversity.
