40|$|Transformation of the {{solid-state}} {{form of a}} drug {{compound in}} the lumen of the gastrointestinal tract may alter the drug bioavailability and in extreme cases result in patient fatalities. The solution-mediated anhydrate-to-hydrate phase transformation was examined using an in vitro model with different biorelevant media, simulated fasted and fed state intestinal fluids containing bile salt and dioleoylphosphatidylcholine (DOPC) micelles, DOPC/sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) mixture, bile salt solution and water. Two anhydrate compounds (carbamazepine, CBZ and nitrofurantoin, NF) with different overall transformation time into hydrate form were used as model compounds. The transformations were monitored using direct structural information from time-resolved synchrotron X-ray diffraction. The kinetics of these transformations were estimated using multivariate data analysis (principal component analysis, PCA) and compared to those for nitrofurantoin (NF). The study showed that the solution-mediated phase transformation of CBZ anhydrate was remarkably faster in the DOPC/SDS medium compared to transformation in all the other aqueous dispersion <b>media.</b> The <b>conversion</b> time for CBZ anhydrate in water was shorter than for DOPC/SDS but still faster than the conversion seen in fed and fasted state micellar <b>media.</b> The <b>conversion</b> of CBZ anhydrate to hydrate was the slowest in the solution containing bile salt alone. In contrast, the solution-mediated phase transformations of NF did only show limited kinetic dependence on the dispersion media used, indicating {{the complexity of the}} nucleation process. Furthermore, when the CBZ and NF material was compacted into tablets the transformation times were remarkably slower. Results suggest that variations in the composition of the contents of the stomach/gut may affect the recrystallization kinetics, especially when investigating compounds with relatively fast overall transformation time, such as CBZ...|$|R

40|$|The {{potential}} {{efficiency of}} using nonlinear up-conversion techniques {{for the high}} efficiency type lasers (CO,CO 2, and chemical) is assessed. Results indicate that: the small pump photon energy necessitates the use of molecular <b>media</b> for <b>conversion</b> if resonance enhancement {{is to be used}} and that molecular systems present several problems. These difficulties include: their levels are complex; their transition probabilities are often unknown; and the oscillator strengths among vibrational levels in the ground electronic state of a molecule are much smaller than those among electronic states of an atom, thus limiting the magnitude of nonlinear interactions. It is shown that this problem can be eliminated by making use of vibronic transitions which, being primarily electronic transitions have much larger matrix elements and efficient conversion can be achieved with molecular systems...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The recent {{emergence}} of multimedia applications {{has led to}} the deployment of various telecommunication technologies (e. g. IP, wireless) in addition to traditional PSTN (Public Switched Telephone Network) circuit switched networks. In this heterogeneous telecommunication world, users make calls without regard {{to the fact that the}} originating network may differ from the terminating network, and the call may be routed through one or more intermediate networks. For instance, users from two different PSTN networks may communicate through an IP network using Voice over IP (VoIP) technology. In this framework, multimedia gateways perform call routing, call signaling <b>conversions</b> and <b>media</b> format <b>conversions</b> among different networks. This paper investigates algorithms and queuing delays on multimedia gateways in regard to call routing aimed at minimizing the expected call delay. Both centralized and distributed queuing models are considered, and performance measures are derived...|$|R

Single photon generation and single photon-pair generation with little uncorrelated multiphoton emission and the feasibility of <b>media</b> <b>conversion</b> of the quantum states between photon polarization and electron spin are fundamental functions for quantum information applications. Mutual <b>media</b> <b>conversion</b> for the angular momentum between photon polarization and electron spin is also achieved with high fidelity via positively charged exciton state without external magnetic field. This is a clear indication that the coupling of photon polarizations and electron spins keeps secured during whole processes before photon emission.

50|$|As {{transverse}} waves, S-waves exhibit properties, such as polarization and birefringence, {{much like}} other transverse waves. S-waves polarized in the horizontal plane {{are classified as}} SH-waves. If polarized in the vertical plane, they are classified as SV-waves. When an S- or P-wave strikes an interface at an angle other than 90 degrees, a phenomenon known as mode conversion occurs. As described above, if the interface is between a solid and liquid, S becomes P or vice versa. However, even if the interface is between two solid <b>media,</b> mode <b>conversion</b> results. If a P-wave strikes an interface, four propagation modes may result: reflected and transmitted P and reflected and transmitted SV. Similarly, if an SV-wave strikes an interface, the same four modes occur in different proportions. The exact amplitudes of all these waves are described by the Zoeppritz equations, which in turn are solutions to the wave equation.|$|R
