5|$|By 2009, Purina {{was one of}} Nestlé's {{fastest growing}} divisions, due to an {{increasing}} willingness by consumers to spend <b>more</b> <b>money</b> <b>on</b> petcare. In 2008, it formed a separate company called PurinaCare with headquarters in San Antonio, Texas that sold pet insurance. PetCare was later acquired by Pethealth Inc. in 2013. By 2009 Purina had also introduced pet litter products and built new manufacturing facilities in Russia and Thailand. Its Colorado plant built the largest privately owned solar panel system in the state. In September 2010, Nestlé reached an agreement to acquire Waggin' Train, a producer of pet treats with $200 million in annual revenues.|$|E

Some of its pet food brands include Purina Pro Plan, Purina Dog Chow, Friskies, Beneful and Purina ONE. The company {{was formed in}} 2001 by combining Ralston Purina, which was acquired by Nestlé for $10.3 billion, with Nestlé's Friskies Petcare Company.

5|$|In late 1991, {{the group}} had the problem of having spent <b>more</b> <b>money</b> <b>on</b> {{production}} than was covered by returns. The group decided that its gangsta rap style was the cause: Most emcees at the time used similar styles, {{making it difficult for}} Inner City Posse to distinguish itself stylistically. Referring to local rapper Esham's horrorcore style, Bruce suggested the band adapt this genre, in a bid to have Detroit represent acid rap, much as Los Angeles represented gangsta rap. The group agreed, but not to copying the style of Esham closely. Instead, they suggested using horror-themed lyrics as an emotional outlet for all their negative life experiences. They were also unanimous in deciding not to rap openly about Satan, which Esham often did.|$|E

5|$|The first V-22 was {{rolled out}} with {{significant}} media attention in May 1988. The project suffered several blows. That year, the U.S. Army left the program, citing {{a need to}} focus its budget on more immediate aviation programs. In 1989, the project survived two separate votes in the Senate that could have resulted in cancellation. Despite the Senate's decision, the Department of Defense instructed the U.S. Navy not to spend <b>more</b> <b>money</b> <b>on</b> the V-22. When the V-22's projected development budget greatly increased in 1988, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney tried to remove funding from 1989 to 1992 {{in an effort to}} cancel it. He was eventually overruled by Congress, which provided unrequested funding for the program. Multiple studies of alternatives found the V-22 provided more capability and combat effectiveness with similar operating costs. The Clinton Administration was supportive of the V-22 and helped it attain funding.|$|E

25|$|The {{biennial}} 2011 Montana {{state legislature}} cut $2.3 {{million from the}} budget for MSU. The budget problem was worsened by an impending decision by the Montana University System Board of Regents to spend <b>more</b> <b>money</b> <b>on</b> the University of Montana System than the Montana State University System. The MSU Budget Council held campus hearings on the issue, and provided three scenarios: A 3 to 5 percent increase in tuition (equal to $150 to $250 per year for in-state students), tapping reserve funds, {{or a combination of}} both. The reserve funds included the university's general reserve fund (which held $5.4 million), and as many as 30 other contingency funds, multi-year spending funds, or funds which ended the previous budget year with leftover money.|$|E
25|$|Copyrights {{could be}} inherited. The rights of heirs and other legal successors were restored: they were {{entitled}} to receive the full royalties on a work. The reduced rates for heirs of at most 50% of the standard schedule were abandoned, but increased taxation of royalties received by heirs offset this benefit again. If no heirs existed, or the author had disinherited them or had willed his works to the state, copyright ceased with the author's death (this had already been the case under the 1961/1964 laws). Parallel to the new laws, the republics also issued new royalty schedules, generally with decreasing remuneration scales: an author was, for instance, entitled to <b>more</b> <b>money</b> <b>on</b> the first print run than on subsequent runs.|$|E

Lloyd George, wanting to spend <b>more</b> <b>money</b> <b>on</b> {{domestic}} programmes and concerned at persuading an electorate recently tripled in size that high defence spending was needed, launched a defence review in summer 1919 after peace was signed. He wanted to know why, with no major enemies on the horizon, so many more men were needed than in 1914 when the Army had numbered 255,000. Defence spending was £766m in 1919–20, this was to be reduced to £135m of which £75m was to be on the army and air force. Wilson supported the Ten Year Rule which was also formulated at this time.|$|E
