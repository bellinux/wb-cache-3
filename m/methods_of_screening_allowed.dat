40|$|BACKGROUND: Most Yersinia pestis strains {{are known}} to express a capsule-like antigen, {{fraction}} 1 (F 1) (.) F 1 is encoded by the caf 1 gene located on the large 100 -kb pFra plasmid, which is found in Y. pestis but not in closely related species such as Yersinia enterocolytica and Yersinia pseudotuberculosis. In order to find antibodies specifically binding to Y. pestis we screened a large single chain Fv antibody fragment (scFv) phage display library using purified F 1 antigen as a selection target. Different forms of the selected antibodies were used to establish assays for recombinant F 1 antigen and Y. pestis detection. METHODS: Phage antibody panning was performed against F 1 in an automated fashion using the Kingfisher magnetic bead system. Selected scFvs were screened for F 1 -binding specificity by one-step alkaline phosphatase enzyme linked immunosorbant assay (ELISA), and assayed for binding to recombinant antigen and/or Y. pestis by flow cytometry and whole-cell ELISA. RESULTS: Seven of the eight selected scFvs were shown to specifically bind both recombinant F 1 and a panel of F 1 -positive Yersinia cells. The majority of the soluble scFvs {{were found to be}} difficult to purify, unstable and prone to cross-reactivity with F 1 -negative Yersinia strains, whereas phage displayed scFvs were found to be easy to purify/label and remarkably stable. Furthermore direct fluorescent labeling of phage displaying scFv allowed for an easy one-step flow cytometry assay. Slight cross-reactivity was observed when fixed cells were used in ELISA. CONCLUSIONS: Our high throughput <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> selection and <b>screening</b> <b>allowed</b> for time and cost effective discovery of seven scFvs specifically binding Y. pestis F 1 antigen. We describe implementation <b>of</b> different <b>methods</b> for phage-based immunoassay. Based on the success <b>of</b> these <b>methods</b> and the proven stability of phage, we indicate that the use of phage-displayed, rather than phage-free proteins, might generally overcome the shortcomings of scFv antibodies...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (M. Nurs.), College of Nursing, Washington State UniversityThe {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine {{cervical}} cancer screening methods available in developing countries, and to discuss alternative effective <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> <b>screening.</b> Cervical cancer is a preventable and curable disease. However, it continues to threaten the lives of women today. Annual world incidence is an estimated 529, 000 and mortality is 275, 000. Eighty- five percent of cases and the majority of deaths due to cervical cancer occur in developing countries. Cytology via Papanicolaou (Pap) smear, the golden standard <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>screening</b> over the past decades, is not generally a suitable <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>screening</b> in low-resource regions. The implementation and sustainability of Pap smear programs have not yet been possible in those countries. Alternative methods have been developed and tested for low-resource countries, including visual inspection by acetic acid (VIA), HPV-DNA, and careHPV-DNA. These screening methods, along with the preventive vaccine, have a greater potential for decreasing the incidence of cervical cancer in developing countries. Nurses play a vital role in educating both health care providers and women in developing countries about the importance of preventive immunization and cervical cancer screening...|$|R

50|$|In the past, crops were {{inspected}} visually {{to determine}} whether or not they were disease free. Visual inspection was also used as a basis for seed certification. Determination of viral status through visual inspection is incredibly difficult as the symptoms may be masked or the infection latent. As a result, post season tests and inspections were introduced. These tests involved the cultivation of previously harvested material in greenhouses. The resulting plants were inspected for a more accurate estimate of viral status. Although this <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>screening</b> did offer some degree of monitoring of viral presence it was subjective and highly ineffective. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) <b>screening</b> <b>of</b> crops and seed potatoes replaced visual inspection in the early 1970s. The use of ELISA offered routine diagnostic laboratories a quick, effective and sensitive <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>screening</b> for a wide range of potato plant viruses.|$|R

(2) The association between uptake <b>of</b> <b>screening</b> and health risk behaviours and beliefs. Two <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> feedback <b>of</b> <b>screening</b> results were given: simple informational feedback, and more extensive feedback, including target-setting and a written contract. At six month follow-up, {{those who received}} simple informational feedback had lost less weight and had increased their exercise less than those who received more extensive feedback. Attenders believed more strongly {{in the relationship between}} lifestyle and health, perceived themselves as less healthy than others and scored higher on the GHQ than staff who did not attend for screening. These results suggest that belief in the effectiveness of lifestyle change in promoting health, and anxiety about health, can influence uptake <b>of</b> <b>screening.</b> Second, the <b>method</b> <b>of</b> presenting <b>screening</b> results can influence the impact <b>of</b> <b>screening</b> on subsequent behaviour change...|$|R
