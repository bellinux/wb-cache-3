40|$|AIM: Hypoxic {{pulmonary}} vasoconstriction (HPV) causes {{pulmonary hypertension}} {{that may lead}} to right heart failure. We hypothesized that the COX- 2 inhibitor nimesulide and the thromboxane A (2) receptor antagonist daltroban would attenuate HPV. METHODS: Haemodynamic measurements and blood sampling were performed in 18 anaesthetized, mechanically ventilated pigs, with mean ± SEM weights of 31. 3 ± 0. 6 kg, in normoxia (F (i) O (2) ~ 0. 21) and hypoxia (F (i) O (2) ~ 0. 10), before and 5, 15 and 45 min after initiation of right atrial infusion of nimesulide (n = 6) or daltroban (n = 6), respectively, and in six control pigs. RESULTS: Compared with normoxia, hypoxia (n = 18) increased <b>mean</b> <b>pulmonary</b> artery pressure by 15. 8 ± 0. 8 mmHg (P < 0. 001), pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) by 2. 7 ± 0. 3 WU (P < 0. 05) and mean right atrial pressure by 2. 3 ± 0. 3 mmHg (P < 0. 001). In the control pigs, <b>mean</b> <b>pulmonary</b> artery pressure, PVR and mean right atrial pressure remained stable (P = ns) throughout 45 min hypoxia, compared with hypoxia baseline. Nimesulide decreased <b>mean</b> <b>pulmonary</b> artery pressure by 3. 7 ± 1. 3 mmHg after 45 min (P < 0. 013), as well as PVR by 0. 8 ± 0. 2 WU (P < 0. 05), levelling off after 15 min. Daltroban transiently increased (P < 0. 001) <b>mean</b> <b>pulmonary</b> artery pressure and mean right atrial pressure by 7. 2 ± 1. 2 and 2. 7 ± 0. 4 mmHg, respectively, but they returned to hypoxia baseline (P = ns) within 5 min.

40|$|ObjectivesPulmonary endarterectomy is the {{treatment}} of choice for chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension. Although several reports demonstrated excellent medium-term survival after pulmonary endarterectomy, long-term outcomes remain unclear. We reviewed long-term outcomes and determined risk factors for early and late adverse events. MethodsSeventy-seven patients were studied. <b>Mean</b> <b>pulmonary</b> arterial pressure was 47 ± 10 mm Hg and pulmonary vascular resistance was 868 ± 319 dyne · s · cm− 5. Disease was classified as chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension type 1 (n =  61), type 2 (n =  12), or type 3 (n =  4). Median and maximum follow-up periods were 5. 6 and 20 years, respectively. ResultsThere were 11 in-hospital deaths. Nonsurvivors had significantly higher <b>mean</b> <b>pulmonary</b> arterial pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance than did survivors (54 ± 10 vs 46 ± 10 mm Hg; P = . 02; 1124 ± 303 vs 824 ± 303 dyne · s · cm− 5; P < . 01). In multivariate analysis, preoperative pulmonary vascular resistance was associated with in-hospital death (odds ratio, 1. 003; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 001 – 1. 005; P < . 01). During follow-up, there were 10 all-cause deaths, including 5 related to chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension. Freedom from adverse events, including disease-specific death or New York Heart Association functional class III, was 70 % at 10 years. In the Cox proportional hazard model, postoperative <b>mean</b> <b>pulmonary</b> arterial pressure was associated with adverse events (hazard ratio, 1. 12; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 03 – 1. 21; P < . 01). Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed <b>mean</b> <b>pulmonary</b> arterial pressure of 34 mm Hg as cutoff for adverse events. ConclusionsPulmonary endarterectomy had sustained favorable effects on long-term survival.

40|$|Transdermal {{systems for}} {{delivery}} of nitroglycerin {{have been shown to}} provide sustained blood levels of the drug for at least 24 hours. Investigations of hemodynamic effects of transdermal nitroglycerin in patients with heart failure have demonstrated a transient reduction in pressure lasting less than the expected 24 hours. These findings could be due to the development of circulatory tolerance to the vasodilatory effects of nitroglycerin or to insufficient drug dosing. In the present study, we compared the hemodynamic effects of the first and the second doses of high dose (120 mg) transdermal nitroglycerin given 24 hours apart in 11 responders (≥ 20 % reduction in <b>mean</b> <b>pulmonary</b> artery wedge pressure lasting ≥ 2 hours). Initiation of nitroglycerin therapy resulted in a significant reduction in mean right atrial pressure lasting for 14 hours and in a reduction in <b>mean</b> <b>pulmonary</b> artery and <b>mean</b> <b>pulmonary</b> artery wedge pressures lasting 24 hours. After administration of the second dose, mean right atrial pressure at 2 hours (9 ± 5 versus 7 ± 4 mm Hg), 4 hours (8 ± 5 versus 6 ± 4 mm Hg) and 8 hours (8 ± 5 versus 6 ± 3 mm Hg) was higher than after the first dose (p < 0. 05). Both <b>mean</b> <b>pulmonary</b> artery and <b>mean</b> <b>pulmonary</b> artery wedge pressures were significantly higher after the second nitroglycerin dose. <b>Mean</b> <b>pulmonary</b> artery pressure after the second dose was 32 ± 8 versus 28 ± 7 mm Hg at 2 hours (p < 0. 05), 32 ± 7 versus 27 ± 7 mm Hg at 4 hours (p < 0. 01), 33 ± 10 versus 27 ± 6 mm Hg at 6 hours (p < 0. 05) and 31 ± 8 versus 26 ± 7 mm Hg at 8 hours (p < 0. 05). <b>Mean</b> <b>pulmonary</b> artery wedge pressure was 22 ± 7 versus 17 ± 7 mm Hg at 2 hours (p < 0. 01), 21 ± 8 versus 16 ± 6 mm Hg at 4 hours (p < 0. 01), 19 ± 8 versus 16 ± 7 mm Hg at 6 hours (p < 0. 05) and 20 ± 9 versus 15 ± 6 mm Hg at 8 hours (p < 0. 01). It is concluded that in patients with chronic congestive heart failure, the initial hemodynamic changes seen after the administration of high dose transdermal nitroglycerin are significantly attenuated within hours of the first dose. These findings suggest that circulatory tolerance to the effect of sustained nitroglycerin therapy develops early and should be taken into consideration when transdermal nitroglycerin is used in short- and long-term therapy of chronic heart failure...|$|R

Results: Compared to normoxia, hypoxia, increased (p< 0, 05) pulmonary vascular resistance by 3, 4 ± 0, 7 WU, <b>mean</b> <b>pulmonary</b> artery pressure by 13, 7 ± 1, 3 mmHg, mean right atrial pressure by 1, 9 ± 0, 4 mmHg and decreased (p< 0, 02) systemic vascular resistance by 5, 2 ± 2, 1 WU. Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, mean aortic blood pressure, heart rate, cardiac output, stroke volume and blood-O(2) -consumption were unaltered (p=ns). Tezosentan infused during hypoxia, normalised pulmonary vascular resistance, decreased (p< 0, 05) maximally <b>mean</b> <b>pulmonary</b> artery pressure by 7, 5 ± 0, 8 mmHg, systemic vascular resistance by 5, 8 ± 0, 7 WU, mean aortic blood pressure by 10, 8 ± 3, 0 mmHg and increased (p< 0, 04) stroke volume by 8, 5 ± 1, 8 mL.

40|$|Acute hypoxic {{pulmonary}} vasoconstriction can be inhibited by {{high doses}} of the carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, acetazolamide. This study aimed to determine if acetazolamide is effective at dosing relevant to human use at high altitude and to investigate whether its efficacy against hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction is dependent upon carbonic anhydrase inhibition by testing other potent heterocyclic sulfonamide carbonic anhydrase inhibitors. Six conscious dogs were studied in five protocols: 1. Controls, 2. Low dose intravenous acetazolamide (2 mg•kg- 1 •h- 1), 3. Oral acetazolamide (5 mg/kg), 4. Benzolamide, a membrane-impermeant inhibitor and 5. Ethoxzolamide, a membrane-permeant inhibitor. In all protocols, unanesthetized dogs breathed spontaneously during the first hour (normoxia), and then breathed 9 - 10 % O 2 {{for the next two}} hours. Arterial oxygen tension ranged between 35 – 39 mmHg during hypoxia in all protocols. In controls, <b>mean</b> <b>pulmonary</b> artery pressure increased by 8 mmHg, and pulmonary vascular resistance by 200 dyn•s•cm- 5 (p< 0. 05). With intravenous acetazolamide, <b>mean</b> <b>pulmonary</b> artery pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance remained unchanged during hypoxia. With oral acetazolamide, <b>mean</b> <b>pulmonary</b> artery pressure increased by 5 mmHg (p< 0. 05), but pulmonary vascular resistance did not change during hypoxia.

MethodsSeventeen patients with chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (pulmonary vascular resistance, 1015 ± 402 dyne·s·cm− 5 [mean ± SD]) underwent pulmonary thromboendarterectomy with cardiopulmonary bypass and deep hypothermic circulatory arrest. Peripheral arterial blood samples were drawn before sternotomy, during cardiopulmonary bypass before and after deep hypothermic circulatory arrest, and 0, 8, 16, and 24 hours after surgery and were analyzed for big endothelin- 1. The patients were divided into 2 groups according to whether their preoperative big endothelin- 1 plasma level was above or below the cutoff point of 2. 1 pg/mL, as determined by receiver operating characteristic curve analysis (group A, big endothelin- 1 < 2. 1 pg/mL, n = 8; group B, big endothelin- 1 ≥ 2. 1 pg/mL, n = 9). ResultsPatients in group B, with higher preoperative big endothelin- 1 levels (3. 2 ± 1. 0 pg/mL vs 1. 5 ± 0. 4 pg/mL; P <. 001), were poorer operative candidates (preoperative <b>mean</b> <b>pulmonary</b> artery pressure, 51. 3 ± 7. 1 mm Hg vs 43. 6 ± 6. 2 mm Hg; P =. 006) and had a poorer outcome (<b>mean</b> <b>pulmonary</b> artery pressure 24 hours after surgery, 32. 6 ± 9. 5 mm Hg vs 21. 8 ± 6. 2 mm Hg; P <. 001).

RESULTS: The median mPAP, <b>mean</b> <b>pulmonary</b> capillary wedge pressure and mean central venous pressure were 15 [*]mmHg (interquartile range 12 - 19 [*]mmHg), 8 [*]mmHg (interquartile range 6 - 11 [*]mmHg) and 3 [*]mmHg (interquartile range 1 - 5 [*]mmHg), respectively. In mPAP median split survival analysis, patients with an mPAP above the median had a significantly lower long-term survival than patients with or below median mPAP (P [*]=[*] 0. 012). mPAP but not mean central venous pressure or <b>mean</b> <b>pulmonary</b> capillary wedge pressure was independently associated with long-term mortality in multivariable Cox-hazard survival analysis (hazard ratio 1. 10, confidence interval 1. 04 - 1. 16, P [*]=[*] 0. 001). Other factors independently associated with mortality were age at transplantation (hazard ratio 1. 03 per year, confidence interval 1. 01 - 1. 04, P [*]=[*] 0. 002) and serum creatinine (μmol/l) (hazard ratio 1. 003, confidence interval 1. 001 - 1. 010, P [*]=[*] 0. 021). CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that mPAP measured in the stable phase after heart transplantation is an independent prognostic factor for long-term mortality...|$|R
40|$|Background—Pulmonary {{hypertension}} is {{a disease}} characterized by an elevation in pulmonary arterial pressure that is diagnosed invasively via right heart catheterization. Such pathological altered pressures in the pulmonary vascular system should lead to changes in blood flow patterns in the main pulmonary artery. Methods and Results—Forty-eight subjects (22 with manifest pulmonary hypertension, 13 with latent pulmonary hypertension, and 13 normal control subjects) underwent time-resolved 3 D magnetic resonance phase-contrast imaging of the main pulmonary artery. Velocity fields that resulted from measurements were calculated, visualized, and analyzed with dedicated software. Main findings were as follows: (1) Manifest pulmonary hypertension coincides {{with the appearance of}} a vortex of blood flow in the main pulmonary artery (sensitivity and specificity of 1. 00, 95 % confidence intervals of 0. 84 to 1. 00 and 0. 87 to 1. 00, respectively), and (2) the relative period of existence of the vortex correlates significantly with <b>mean</b> <b>pulmonary</b> arterial pressure at rest (correlation coefficient of 0. 94). To test the diagnostic performance of the vortex criterion, we furthermore investigated 55 patients in a blinded prospective study (22 with manifest pulmonary hypertension, 32 with latent pulmonary hypertension, and 1 healthy subject), which resulted in a sensitivity of 1. 00 and specificity of 0. 91 (95 % confidence intervals of 0. 84 to 1. 00 and 0. 76 to 0. 98, respectively). Comparison of catheter-derived <b>mean</b> <b>pulmonary</b> artery pressure measurements and calculated <b>mean</b> <b>pulmonary</b> artery pressure values resulted in a standard deviation of differences of 3. 6 mm Hg. Conclusions—Vortices of blood flow in the main pulmonary artery enable the identification of manifest <b>pulmonary</b> hypertension. Elevated <b>mean</b> <b>pulmonary</b> arterial pressures can be measured from the period of vortex existence. (Cir...|$|R
40|$|The {{response}} of {{atrial natriuretic peptide}} (ANP) release to haemodynamic influences after cardioversion of atrial fibrillation has not been fully examined. We measured plasma concentrations of ANP and assessed haemodynamic changes 60 - 120 min after DC cardioversion in 22 patients with non-valvular chronic atrial fibrillation. Passive leg elevation to enhance volume expansion was performed 60 min after DC cardioversion. Sinus rhythm was restored in 18 of the 22 patients (successful DC cardioversion group). The control group consisted of seven patients with non-valvular chronic atrial fibrillation who did not undergo DC cardioversion (atrial fibrillation control group). In the successful DC cardioversion group, the <b>mean</b> <b>pulmonary</b> artery wedge pressure decreased significantly 15 min after cardioversion (P< 005) and then remained unchanged. Plasma concentrations of ANP also decreased significantly 15 min after cardioversion (P< 0 - 05). Furthermore, there was an additional significant decrease in ANP levels for up to 60 min after cardioversion (P< 005 from 15 min). Passive leg elevation for 15 min led {{to an increase in}} the <b>mean</b> <b>pulmonary</b> artery wedge pressure (P< 001) and right atrial pressure (P< 005), but did not result in increased plasma concentrations of ANP (471 ± 27 - 6 vs 43 - 9 ± 34 - 4 pg. ml' 1, mean ± SD, P-ns). In the atrial fibrillation control group, passive leg elevation increased the <b>mean</b> <b>pulmonary</b> artery wedge pressure (P< 001), the mean right atrial pressure (P< 005) and plasma concentrations of ANP (139 - 9 ± 85 - 8 vs 1681 ± 108 - 2, P< 005). In summary, after successful DC cardio-version of non-valvular chronic atrial fibrillation, plasma concentrations of ANP decreased in conjunction with decreased <b>mean</b> <b>pulmonary</b> artery wedge pressure. The {{response of}} ANP release to volume expansion, however, appears to be dysregulated in this patient population...|$|R
40|$|AbstractPulmonary {{arterial}} hypertension (PAH) is diagnosed by various investigations {{that are essential}} for making the diagnosis, and by additional tests to clarify the category of pulmonary hypertension (PH). A diagnostic algorithm can guide the evaluation of PH, but like all guidelines the algorithm can be modified according to specific clinical circumstances. Most patients are diagnosed {{as the result of}} an evaluation of symptoms, whereas others are diagnosed during screening of asymptomatic populations at risk. Right heart catheterization (RHC) must be performed in patients with suspected PH to establish the diagnosis and document pulmonary hemodynamics. Before initiation of medical therapy, assessment of acute vasoreactivity (during catheterization) is necessary to determine the appropriate therapy for an individual patient. An acute response is generally defined as a decrease in <b>mean</b> <b>pulmonary</b> arterial pressure of at least 10 mm Hg with the <b>mean</b> <b>pulmonary</b> arterial pressure decreasing to 40 mm Hg or below, accompanied by a normal or high cardiac output. After PAH is diagnosed, disease severity should be assessed in order to accurately determine risk:benefit profiles for various therapeutic options. Useful tools to predict outcome include functional class, exercise <b>capacity,</b> <b>pulmonary</b> hemodynamics, acute vasoreactivity, right ventricular function, as well as brain natriuretic peptide, endothelin- 1, uric acid, and troponin levels. Repeating these tests serially on treatment is useful for monitoring the response to a given therapy. Close follow-up at a center specializing in management of PH is recommended, with careful periodic reassessment and adjustment of therapy...|$|R
