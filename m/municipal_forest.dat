2500|$|While {{teaching}} at Wesleyan Female College in Macon, GA, Charlotte Ford cites Andrews as having her first formal contact with botany through {{contact with the}} botany professor, Charles Townsend, although her interest truly sparked from her childhood days exploring the forest around Haywood. Andrews styled herself as an amateur botanist, collecting samples and doing minor research whenever she could find the time. [...] During her botanical career, Andrews became a strong proponent of conservation, using her published pieces to rail against turpentine distillers and developers for destroying woodlands. [...] Her first textbook, Botany All the Year Round, published in 1903, aimed {{at a high school}} audience, was particularly useful for rural schools. It contained activities and labs aimed at attracting these schools to a low-budget scientific discipline that utilized the natural world around them, instead of pricey experimental materials. A Practical Course in Botany, her second textbook, however, was aimed more at a college and university audience and stressed the relationship between botany and more practical fields such as agriculture and economics. [...] Internationally acclaimed, Practical Botany was translated for use in French schools. [...] Andrews was also nominated {{to be a member of}} the Italian International Academy of Science, although she was too old at the time to travel to Naples and accept the honor. In the end she bequeathed the royalties from her books to the city of Rome, GA for a <b>municipal</b> <b>forest</b> reserve, although the city eventually turned the money back over to her estate because of lack of funds, probably due to the depression.|$|E

40|$|Dead wood {{plays an}} {{important}} role for the biodiversity of forest ecosystems and influences their proper development. This study assessed the amount of coarse woody debris in <b>municipal</b> <b>forests</b> in Warsaw (central Poland). Based on the forest site type, dominant tree species and age class, we stratified all complexes of the Warsaw urban forests in order to allocate 55 sample plots. For these plots, we determined the volume of dead wood including standing dead trees, coarse woody debris and broken branches as well as uprooted trees. We calculated the amount of dead wood in the distinguished site-species-age layers and for individual complexes. The volume of dead matter in <b>municipal</b> <b>forests</b> in Warsaw amounted to 38, 761 m 3, i. e. 13. 7 m 3 /ha. The obtained results correspond to the current regulations concerning the amount of dead organic matter to be left in forests. Only in the Las Bielański complex (northern Warsaw) volume of dead wood is comparable to the level observed in Polish national parks or nature reserves, which is still far lower than the values found for natural <b>forests.</b> In general, <b>municipal</b> <b>forests</b> in Warsaw stand out positively in terms of dead wood quantity and a high degree of variation in the forms and dimensions of dead wood...|$|R
