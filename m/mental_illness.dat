5|$|Philosophy of {{psychiatry}} explores philosophical questions relating to psychiatry and <b>mental</b> <b>illness.</b> The philosopher {{of science and}} medicine Dominic Murphy identifies three areas of exploration in the philosophy {{of psychiatry}}. The first concerns the examination of psychiatry as a science, using the tools of the philosophy of science more broadly. The second entails the examination of the concepts employed in discussion of <b>mental</b> <b>illness,</b> including the experience of <b>mental</b> <b>illness,</b> and the normative questions it raises. The third area concerns the links and discontinuities between the philosophy of mind and psychopathology.|$|E

The portrayal of mental health professionals and psychiatric treatment is also discussed. The theories explaining the relationship of how media influences the attitudes and behavior are discussed. Media has also been suggested to be a risk factor for the genesis or exacerbation of <b>mental</b> <b>illnesses</b> like eating disorders and substance use disorders. The potential use of media to understand the psychopathology and plight of those with psychiatric disorders is referred to.

40|$|Background. When {{patients}} {{accept the}} diagnosis of an illness, the common reaction is to ask when they will recover. The {{same is true for}} patients with <b>mental</b> <b>illnesses.</b> Recovery to the lay person is generally taken to mean being restored to one’s former state. However, with <b>mental</b> <b>illnesses,</b> the answer is usually one ofuncertainty. <b>Mental</b> <b>illnesses</b> are often considered chronic with patients being plagued with the presence of residual symptoms. Health providers may not consider such a state as recovery. Health providers are in need of a clear definition of recovery to identify the goals of treating people with <b>mental</b> <b>illnesses</b> and to inform patientsand public of the duration and steps to proceed towards recovery. Aim. This paper is a report of an analysis of the concept of“recovery in mental illnesses”. Method. Using Walker and Avant’s approach to concept analysis the concept of “recovery in mental illnesses” was defined and its essential attributes were discussed. Findings. “Recovery in mental illnesses” is defined as an on-going, dynamic and individualized process that occurs after the development of <b>mental</b> <b>illnesses.</b> It involves an individual actively regaining his or her pre-morbid state in spite of the challenges of <b>mental</b> <b>illnesses,</b> over tim...|$|R

5|$|As Ukrainian {{psychiatrist}} Ada Korotenko notes, {{the use of}} punitive psychiatry allowed {{of avoiding}} the judicial procedure during which the accused might declare the impossibility to speak publicly and the violation of their civil rights. Making a psychiatric diagnosis is insecure and can {{be based on a}} preconception. Moreover, while diagnosing <b>mental</b> <b>illness,</b> subjective fuzzy diagnostic criteria are involved as arguments. The lack of clear diagnostic criteria and clearly defined standards of diagnostics contributes to applying punitive psychiatry to vigorous and gifted citizens who disagree with authorities. At the same time, most psychiatrists incline to believe that such a misdiagnosis is less dangerous than not diagnosing <b>mental</b> <b>illness.</b>|$|E

40|$|People {{with severe}} <b>mental</b> <b>illnesses</b> die early from {{cardiovascular}} disease. Evidence is lacking regarding effective primary care based interventions to tackle this problem. To identify current procedures for, barriers to, and facilitators of {{the delivery of}} primary care based interventions for lowering cardiovascular risk for people with severe <b>mental</b> <b>illnesses.</b> 75 GPs, practice nurses, service users, community mental health staff and carers in UK GP practice or community mental health settings were interviewed in 14 focus groups which were audio-recorded, transcribed and analysed using Framework Analysis. Five barriers to delivering primary care based interventions for lowering cardiovascular risk in people with severe <b>mental</b> <b>illnesses</b> were identified by the groups: negative perceptions of people with severe <b>mental</b> <b>illnesses</b> amongst some health professionals, difficulties accessing GP and community-based services, difficulties in managing a healthy lifestyle, not attending appointments, {{and a lack of}} awareness of increased cardiovascular risk in people with severe <b>mental</b> <b>illnesses</b> by some health professionals. Identified facilitators included involving supportive others, improving patient engagement with services, continuity of care, providing positive feedback in consultations and goal setting. We identified a range of factors which can be incorporated in to the design, delivery and evaluation of services to reduce cardiovascular risk for people with severe <b>mental</b> <b>illnesses</b> in primary care. The next step is determining the clinical and cost effectiveness of primary care based interventions for lowering cardiovascular risk in people with severe <b>mental</b> <b>illnesses,</b> and evaluating the most important components of such interventions...|$|R
40|$|Identifying {{the risk}} factors for <b>mental</b> <b>illnesses</b> is of {{significant}} public health importance. Diagnosis, stigma associated with <b>mental</b> <b>illnesses,</b> comorbidity, and complex etiologies, among others, make it very challenging to study mental disorders. Genetic studies of <b>mental</b> <b>illnesses</b> date back at least a century ago, beginning with descriptive studies based on Mendelian laws of inheritance. A variety of study designs including twin studies, family studies, linkage analysis, and more recently, genomewide association studies have been employed to study the genetics of <b>mental</b> <b>illnesses,</b> or complex diseases in general. In this paper, I will present the challenges and methods from a statistical perspective and focus on genetic association studies.

5|$|The person's {{understanding}} {{of his or}} her <b>mental</b> <b>illness</b> is evaluated by exploring his or her explanatory account of the problem, and {{understanding of}} the treatment options. In this context, insight can be said to have three components: recognition that one has a <b>mental</b> <b>illness,</b> compliance with treatment, and the ability to re-label unusual mental events (such as delusions and hallucinations) as pathological. As insight is on a continuum, the clinician should not describe it as simply present or absent, but should report the patient's explanatory account descriptively.|$|E

5|$|In 1897 Max Weber Sr. {{died two}} months after a severe quarrel with his son that was never resolved. After this, Weber became {{increasingly}} prone to depression, nervousness and insomnia, {{making it difficult for}} him to fulfill his duties as a professor. His condition forced him to reduce his teaching and eventually leave his course unfinished in the autumn of 1899. After spending months in a sanatorium during the summer and autumn of 1900, Weber and his wife travelled to Italy {{at the end of the}} year and did not return to Heidelberg until April 1902. He would again withdraw from teaching in 1903 and not return to it till 1919. Weber's ordeal with <b>mental</b> <b>illness</b> was carefully described in a personal chronology that was destroyed by his wife.

The newly ascribed roles of astrocytes, oligodendrocytes and microglia have led to their examination in brain pathology and <b>mental</b> <b>illnesses.</b> Indeed, abnormalities in glial function, structure and density have been observed in postmortem brain studies of subjects diagnosed with <b>mental</b> <b>illnesses.</b> In this review, we discuss the newly identified functions of glia and highlight the findings of glial abnormalities in psychiatric disorders.

5|$|Norman Osborn {{is shown}} to be {{severely}} manic depressive. This has been referenced several times in a myriad of Spider-Man stories. When he is not {{under the direction of}} a psychiatrist and taking medication, he has dangerous mood swings. At the apex of his mania, he is paranoid, delusional, and suffers from visual and auditory hallucinations, including hearing the voice of his Green Goblin persona and seeing its face in the mirror rather than his own. Previously, Osborn's arrogance caused him to refuse to submit to psychiatric treatment unless forced to; he viewed <b>mental</b> <b>illness</b> as an imperfection and therefore would not admit that he is mentally ill. In later conversations with the Sentry, Osborn revealed that he had come to accept his own <b>mental</b> <b>illness.</b> After having rid of his powers after the confrontation with the Superior Spider-Man (Doctor Octopus), Osborn's sanity apparently restored but remains a villain.|$|E
