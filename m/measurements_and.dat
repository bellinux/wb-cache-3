40|$|Abstract: Authors {{present an}} {{analysis}} {{about the consequences}} of complex <b>measurement</b> <b>and</b> signal processing tasks. They show that <b>measurement</b> <b>and</b> signal processing problems of now-a-days open new dimensions for the interpretation of the basic concepts of <b>measurement</b> <b>and</b> signal processing and make the reevaluation of these concepts necessary. Traditional methods fail in many cases to yield useful solutions, especially when <b>measurement</b> <b>and</b> signal processing problems reveal considerable complexity, involve a wide spectrum of various disciplines and require a multitude of components and methods. Since traditional methods, without a proper resource management supported at the system level, seem inappropriate to solve such problems, qualitatively new methods are needed. The present paper seeks answers to these problems. It gives a brief overview of various imprecise computational methods and discusses their applicability to treat complex <b>measurement</b> <b>and</b> signal processing problems. 1...|$|R

40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to discuss what a fully {{sustainable}} supply chain might look like and the consequences that can be drawn from this view. Also, it develops a practical approach towards sustainability supply chain performance <b>measurement</b> <b>and</b> management.

Little research has been conducted on the issues, existing methods and possible approaches to measure and manage SPSCs. Design/methodology/approach - Literature review and conceptual development of framework. Findings - The paper develops an analytical framework for the assessment of approaches for the <b>measurement</b> <b>and</b> management of SPSCs.
