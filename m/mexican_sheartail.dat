50|$|The <b>Mexican</b> <b>sheartail</b> (Doricha eliza) is {{a species}} of hummingbird in the family Trochilidae. It is endemic to Mexico.|$|E
50|$|Birds of the Veracruz dry forests {{include the}} sharp-shinned hawk (Accipiter striatus), merlin (Falco columbarius), white-winged dove (Zenaida asiatica), lesser {{roadrunner}} (Geococcyx velox), <b>Mexican</b> <b>sheartail</b> (Doricha eliza), Couch's kingbird (Tyrannus couchii), Swainson’s thrush (Catharus ustulatus), red-eyed vireo (Vireo olivaceous), magnolia warbler (Dendroia magnolia), and blue-black grassquit (Vilatinia jacarina). The area {{is rich in}} herpetofauna such as the black-spotted newt (Notophthalmus meridionalis), and Tabasco mud turtle (Kinosternon acutum).|$|E
50|$|The <b>Mexican</b> <b>sheartail</b> {{feeds on}} nectar from flowers {{and has been}} seen visiting Ipomoea, Justicia and Helicteres guazumaefolia. It also {{sometimes}} consumes small arthropods. In Veracruz, breeding takes place from May onwards and in Yucatán, between August and April. The tiny cup-shaped nest is made of lichens, spiders webs and the seeds of daisy family plants. Two eggs are laid and newly fledged young have been reported from Yucatán in February and March.|$|E
50|$|This {{is a tiny}} bird, {{weighing}} only 2.4 to 2.6 g. All <b>Mexican</b> <b>sheartails</b> have a long, curved {{and black}} bill, a dull green crown and bronzy-green nape and upperparts. Males and females are sexual dimorphic. The male, which are 9 to 10 cm including the tail, have a white line behind the eye and a pink-purple throat with a white band below. His underparts are dull green, being clearer on median belly and feathers cover his undertail. The male's tail is long and deeply forked, usually held closed in repose. His inner tail are feathers green, the rest being black with cinnamon inner margins. Female, at 8.5 to 9 cm, has a whitish face with a blackish stripe behind the eye. Her throat, chest and belly are whitish with cinnamon tinges on the sides. The female has a shorter forked tail, the outer feathers of which are reddish with a subterminal black band and white tips. Immatures are similar to females.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>Mexican</b> <b>sheartail</b> {{has a small}} range {{divided into}} parts. There are {{estimated}} to be fewer than 2500 individuals in the Veracruz population and somewhere between 6,000 and 10,000 in the Yucatán coastal strip. Both are suffering habitat degradation, the former from agricultural and residential development and the latter from development related to tourism. It is likely that the population of these birds is in decline and the IUCN have listed this species as being [...] "Near Threatened".|$|E
40|$|We {{reviewed}} morphological variation, taxonomic status, geographic distribution, ecology, {{and behavior}} of the poorly known hummingbird, the <b>Mexican</b> <b>Sheartail</b> (Doricha eliza), based on museum specimens and field studies. Although the broadly disjunct distribution of the species would suggest that two taxa are involved, morphological differences between the populations appear minor, not deserving of formal taxonomic recognition. Ecological {{differences between the two}} populations are stronger, howeve...|$|E
40|$|The <b>Mexican</b> <b>Sheartail</b> (Doricha eliza), an {{endangered}} hummingbird, is endemic to Mexico where two populations have a disjunct distribution. One population is distributed {{along the northern}} tip of the Yucatan Peninsula whereas the other is mostly restricted to central Veracruz. Despite their disjunct distribution, previous work has failed to detect morphological or behavioral differences between these populations. Here we use variation in morphology, mtDNA and nuDNA sequences to determine the degree of morphological and molecular divergence between populations, their divergence time, and historical demography. We use species distribution modeling and niche divergence tests to infer the relative roles of vicariance and dispersal in driving divergence in the genus. Our Bayesian and maximum likelihood phylogenetic analyses revealed that Doricha eliza populations form a monophyletic clade and support their sister relationship with D. enicura. We found marked genetic differentiation, with reciprocal monophyly of haplotypes and highly restricted gene flow, supporting a history of isolation over the last 120, 000 years. Genetic divergence between populations is consistent with the lack of overlap in environmental space and slight morphological differences between males. Our findings indicate that the divergence of the Veracruz and Yucatan populations is best explained by a combination of a short period of isolation exacerbated by subsequent divergence in climate conditions, and that rather than vicariance, the two isolated ranges of D. eliza are the product of recent colonization and divergence in isolation...|$|E
