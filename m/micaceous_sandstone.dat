2500|$|The Bogotá Formation, {{named after}} the capital, is a Paleocene to Lower Eocene {{argillaceous}} unit, concordantly overlying the lower Paleogene sequence. The formation is composed of grey, purple and red shales with <b>micaceous</b> <b>sandstone</b> beds towards {{the top of the}} stratigraphical unit. The thickness in the subsurface of the Bogotá savanna ranges from [...] and outcrops {{at the edges of the}} flatlands. In this formation fossils of the ungulate Etayoa bacatensis, {{named after the}} name for the savanna and its main settlement in present-day Funza, used by the native Muisca; Bacatá, have been found.

50|$|The circle had a {{diameter}} of 80 feet and a circumference of approximately 252 ft. The stones in the circle are green <b>micaceous</b> <b>sandstone</b> originating from the Devonian period. These stones were probably collected in the local area. Following his excavation of several stone settings, the archaeologist Mark Gillings argued that three forms of stone were deliberately incorporated into the article: small uprights, low uprights, and larger stones that are positioned in a sloping position.|$|E
5000|$|The New Oxford Formation is a mapped bedrock unit {{consisting}} {{primarily of}} sandstones, conglomerates, and shales.The New Oxford Formation was first described in Adams County, Pennsylvania in 1929, {{and over the}} following decade was mapped in adjacent York County, Pennsylvania and Frederick County, Maryland. [...] It was described as [...] "red shale and sandstone with beds of <b>micaceous</b> <b>sandstone,</b> arkose, and conglomerate." [...] The majority of this early mapping was done by G. W.

50|$|This {{formation}} {{is similar to}} the underlying Aultbea Formation, the main difference being in grain size, with this formation being noticeably finer-grained. The sequence is made up of 22 m thick cycles, each with a basal erosion surface followed by dark grey shales with desiccation cracks, planar cross-bedded sandstones with wave rippled tops, overlain by trough cross-bedded <b>micaceous</b> <b>sandstones.</b> These cycles are thought to represent repeated progradation of deltas into a lake. A lack of evaporite minerals suggest that the lakes had through drainage. Acritarch microfossils were described from here by Teall in 1907, the first Precambrian fossils described in Britain.|$|R
50|$|The Nam Phong Formation is the basal {{unit of the}} Khorat Group. It {{consists}} of resistant, red-brown <b>micaceous</b> <b>sandstones,</b> conglomerates, siltstone and mudstone of mainly fluvial origin. The sandstones are medium to very fine-grained and are usually calcareous. The conglomerates contain pebbles of quartz, brown and grey chert, and reddish brown siltstone. Cross bedding and plane-bed stratification are common in the sandstones and conglomerates. The sandstones and conglomerates make up approximately 30% of the formation. This sedimentary rock formation is found in Khon Kaen Province, Thailand. It is of Norian to Rhaetian age (Upper Triassic) to (Lower Jurassic) age, and is notable for its fossils of early dinosaurs.|$|R
50|$|The Sixtymile Formation is {{typically}} subdivided into three informal members. They are (1) a lower red siltstone, sandstone, and breccia member; (2) a middle cherty quartzite member; and (3) an upper breccia-bearing sandstone and conglomerate member. The lower member, which is 22 22 m to 27 m thick, consists of beds of a heterogeneous mixture of laminated hematitic sandstone; thin-bedded <b>micaceous</b> <b>sandstone</b> containing rock fragments; monomict and polymict breccia; crudely bedded sandstone; and thin-bedded soft sandy siltstone. Individual beds are discontinuous and local in extent and often grade into each other. Blocks of dolomite from the underlying Walcott Member often {{occur in the}} lower member.|$|E
50|$|The Bogotá Formation, {{named after}} the capital, is a Paleocene to Lower Eocene {{argillaceous}} unit, concordantly overlying the lower Paleogene sequence. The formation is composed of grey, purple and red shales with <b>micaceous</b> <b>sandstone</b> beds towards {{the top of the}} stratigraphical unit. The thickness in the subsurface of the Bogotá savanna ranges from 800 to 2000 m and outcrops {{at the edges of the}} flatlands. In this formation fossils of the ungulate Etayoa bacatensis, {{named after the}} name for the savanna and its main settlement in present-day Funza, used by the native Muisca; Bacatá, have been found.

50|$|The Puente Formation is a deep-marine {{formation}} that {{is characterized}} by pro-delta sediments and an overlapping fan system. This unit lies above the Topanga Group giving it a Late Miocene depositional age and is divided into four members. The La Vida Member is a micaceous, platy siltstone with subordinate amounts of thin-bedded feldspathic sandstone. The next member is the Soquel, which is a thick bedded to massive <b>micaceous</b> <b>sandstone.</b> Locally abundant siltstone, conglomerate, and intraformational breccia {{can also be seen}} in this member. Above the Soquel lies the Yorba Member. This member is a sandy siltstone that is interbedded with a fine-grained sandstone. The Sycamore Canyon Member contains lenses of conglomerate, conglomeratic sandstone, and sandstone. Sandy siltstone and fine-grained sandstones are interbedded with the aforementioned rock types.|$|E
50|$|The river rises on a sandy mid-Pliocene Tangahoe Mudstone, {{formed in}} a shallow sea, then its valley is cut down to early-Pliocene Whenuakura Group rocks (bioclastic limestone, pebbly and <b>micaceous</b> <b>sandstones</b> and massive siltstone), whilst the {{surrounding}} land is covered by mid-Pleistocene beach deposits of conglomerate, sand, peat and clay. The river carries about 43,900 tonnes of sediment to the sea each year. It enters the sea between 30 to 50 m tall cliffs, eroded over the last 15,000 years, following tectonic uplift. Of the rivers flowing into the S Taranaki Bight, the Tangahoe ranks 13th for flow but 9th for sediment input, with a sediment rate of 1.39kg/s.|$|R
50|$|The {{summit of}} the hill is formed in {{sandstones}} and siltstones of the Cae'r Mynach Formation which like all of the rocks are tilted steeply to the southeast {{as part of a}} geological structure called the Myddfai Steep Belt. The flaggy <b>micaceous</b> <b>sandstones</b> of the Tilestones Formation immediately overlies these beds and this is followed in turn by the thick sequence of the Raglan Mudstone Formation. These latter two formations are assigned as the oldest parts of the Old Red Sandstone though date from the Silurian. To the northwest are the various sandstones, mudstones and siltstones of the Aberedw, Hafod Fawr, Cwm Graig Ddu and Halfway Farm Formations. A series of northwest to southeast aligned faults cut through this succession and give rise to minor features in the landscape.|$|R
50|$|The Tilestones, Downton Castle Sandstone, and Ledbury Formation shales are {{occasionally}} {{grouped together}} under the term Downtonian. They are in reality passage beds between the Silurian and Old Red Sandstone, and were originally placed in the latter system by Sir Roderick Murchison. They are mostly grey, yellow or red <b>micaceous,</b> shaly <b>sandstones.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Altar Stone is {{a central}} {{megalith}} at Stonehenge in England, dating to Stonehenge phase 3i, around 2600 BC. It is made of a purplish-green <b>micaceous</b> <b>sandstone</b> and {{is thought to have}} originated from outcrops of the Senni Beds formation of the Old Red Sandstone in Wales, though this is currently in debate. Stone 80 (Altar Stone) was most recently excavated in the 1950s, but no written records of the excavation survive. Stone 55 (a sarsen megalith) lies on top of Stone 80 perpendicular, thought to have fallen across it. The Altar Stone weighs approximately six tons and would have stood nearly two metres tall. It is sometimes classed as a bluestone, because it does not have a local provenance. Now recumbent, it is thought to have originally stood as a single large monolith.|$|E
50|$|The Sambangsan Formations has diverse homogeneous, purple, to greenish gray fine {{sandstone}} and siltstone. Sandstones {{are generally}} massive, greenish gray, and fine grained, showing small-scale bands and are poorly to moderately sorted (Chough 90).They {{are mainly composed of}} fine to very fine quartz, feldspar, mica, and opaque minerals, and show foliations. Quartz are mainly {{made out of}} 70 - 80% of framework grains and the upper parts of the formation are formed by fauna of the middle Middle cumbrian. The occurrence of fine sandstone layers is suggestive of deposition in relatively shallow to deep-water environments (Chough 93).Sambangsan Formation consists of a lot of light grey, green or brown, massive or thick-bedded sandstone (upper part) and red or green shale and sandy shale. Extreme tribes of Middle Cambrian age occur in light brown, thin-bedded medium to coarse-grained, <b>micaceous</b> <b>sandstone</b> beds in {{the upper part of the}} formations (Chough 22).|$|E
50|$|In a more {{restricted}} sense, {{the term}} is used to describe certain thin layers of bony fragments, which occur in well-defined geological strata. One of the best-known {{of these is the}} Ludlow Bone Bed, which is found {{at the base of the}} Downton Sandstone in the Upper Ludlow series. At Ludlow (England) itself, two such beds are actually known, separated by about 14 ft. of strata. Although quite thin, the Ludlow Bone Bed can be followed from that town into Gloucestershire, for a distance of 45 mi. It is almost completely made up of fragments of spines, teeth and scales of ganoid fish. Another well-known bed, formerly known as the Bristol or Lias Bone Bed, exists in the form of several thin layers of <b>micaceous</b> <b>sandstone,</b> with the remains of fish and saurians, which occur in the Rhaetic Black Paper Shales that lie above the Keuper marls, in the south-west of England. It is noteworthy that a similar bone bed has been traced on the same geological horizon in Brunswick, Hanover (Germany), in Franconia and in Tübingen (Germany). A bone bed has also been observed at the base of the Carboniferous limestone series, in certain parts of the south-west of England.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT The Neogene Siwalik {{sequence}} of western Arunachal Pradesh comprises northward dipping thrust sheets structurally below the Main Boundary Fault (MBT) {{and above the}} Main Frontal Thrust (MFT). In the foreland propagating thrust package, the compact and <b>micaceous</b> Dafla <b>sandstone</b> –shale-clay stone sequence is thrusted over the semi con-solidated Subansiri sandstone –clay sequence. Near the zone of cataclasis the <b>micaceous</b> Dafla <b>sandstones</b> show microscale kink folds.

40|$|At Huizui, a {{major centre}} of ground stone tool manufac-ture, five main lithologies were used, each for a particu-lar purpose: oolitic {{dolomite}} for spades; diabase for axes, adzes and chisels; fine <b>micaceous</b> <b>sandstone</b> for knives and sickles; other sandstone for grinding slabs; and fine limestone for lime. This reflects the functional properties of these lithologies. Diabase, oolitic dolomite and fine <b>micaceous</b> <b>sandstone</b> are tough and take sharp edges, which for diabase are particularly sharp and easily re-sharpened. All five rock types are probably available within 8 km of the site. Ground stone tool production {{may have been}} located at Huizui because of its proximity to the adjacent sandstone hills, which provided abundant abrasive material. Overall, raw materials are dominated by oolitic dolomite, which was quarried from a single thin-bedded layer that outcrops as flat pavements. Dia-base was sourced from river cobbles, and <b>micaceous</b> <b>sandstone</b> was quarried. All three of these lithologies were extracted as raw material that required minimal shaping to make tools. This factor was probably respon-sible for the choice of oolitic dolomite over fine-grained dolomite, which is more common and occurs closer to Huizui, but cannot be easily quarried.

30|$|These logs are {{effectively}} used to differentiate among clay-bearing sandstone, arkose sandstone (high K content, low Th content), <b>micaceous</b> <b>sandstone</b> (low K composition, high Th composition), greywackes (equal amounts of Th and K), greensands (glauconite-rich), and heavy mineral bearing sandstones. The level of radioactive minerals in sandstone determines {{the content of}} the heavy minerals and clay, whereas K is usually contained in feldspars and micas. The high U concentration in shales suggests that shale is a source rock. High U with greater solubility and mobility is associated with fault planes, fractures, and formations where the flow has occurred. Since Th has a very low solubility and limited mobility, it is likely to accumulate with heavy minerals (Schlumberger 1989). High Th content is evident in Chanda Deep- 1, coupled with GR at a depth of 4660 – 4680  m. High K content, coupled with a high GR response in a zone indicates that the rock could be <b>micaceous</b> <b>sandstone.</b> As shown in Fig.  6, the Th–K cross-plot indicates the separation of the Th and K in the Chanda- 1 well; the high Th values and lower K values in the Chanda- 1 well indicate <b>micaceous</b> <b>sandstone,</b> while in the Chanda Deep- 1 well high K values indicate arkosic–feldspathic sandstone. We investigated the NGS log plots as an alternative to understand the depositional environments of sandstone types due to non-availability of drill well cuttings from studied wells.|$|E
40|$|Fossil {{plants are}} {{described}} {{from the upper}} part of the Devonian Lolén Formation, Sierra de la Ventana, Buenos Aires Province, Argentina, in the area of Estancia Las Acacias. The sequence is composed mainly of dark grey shales, and fossils were found in a single horizon where thin inter-layered beds of fine reddish-brown <b>micaceous</b> <b>sandstones</b> appear where the environment of marine deposition became more shallow. The age of the Lolén Formation is presently established on the basis of brachiopods, these being characteristic elements of the Malvinokaffric realm from the Gondwana Lower Devonian (Emsian). The fossil plants are remarkably preserved given that they are in rocks that have undergone intense deformation. The plants are identified as Haplostigma sp. and Haskinsia cf. H. colophylla, and suggest a Middle Devonian age (Givetian) for the fossil-bearing levels. Haskinsia, identified on the basis of leaf morphology, is the first well-delimited Middle Devonian lycopsid genus described from Argentina, and the record from the most southerly palaeolatitude. During the Middle Devonian, Haskinsia was distributed in tropical, warm temperate and high southern latitude, ?cool temperate zones...|$|R
40|$|The Red Marble of Baelen {{is a local}} {{ornamental}} stone {{from the}} Limbourg area (Vesdre valley, Eastern Belgium), {{where it has been}} quarried at least since the 16 th century, possibly even from the 9 th century. It represents a local Member of the Middle Famennian (late Upper Devonian) Souverain-Pré Formation. It is the only known or at least the only well-documented Mid Famennian red-stained carbonate mudmound complex worldwide. Carbonate microfacies comprise nodular to lenticular algospongal pack/bindstones and massive stromatactis-bearing microbialitic mudstones, both enclosing lenticular crinoidal grain- to rudstones. Silty nodular bioclastic wacke/packstones, strongly affected by pressure solution, mark the transition with underlying and overlying <b>micaceous</b> <b>sandstones</b> and occur as interbeds within the mudmound core. The Red Marble of Baelen displays a few varieties that have been used for a large spectrum of building and decorative purposes, mostly within a short radius of the production sites, in the former Duchy of Limbourg.

30|$|The Buntsandstein {{forms the}} base of the Triassic sequence. It is {{composed}} of seven dominantly red-coloured sandstone units. At the top of the Buntsandstein formation, the Grès à Voltzia unit is the first light-red <b>micaceous</b> <b>sandstone,</b> so the transition to the Buntsandstein is easily recognizable with the change in colour and high content quartz. In addition, the transition is marked by the presence of the most radioactive peak of the entire sedimentary column. The GR increases from the middle of Keuper to {{the base of}} the Buntsandstein formation. The highest GR signal is quite similar in all the wells and marks the transition to the Buntsandstein.

30|$|Our {{findings}} from wireline logs interpretation confirm the previous findings, suggesting good reservoir potential of fluvio-deltaic succession/delta front facies. The presence of <b>micaceous</b> <b>sandstone</b> as inferred from the NGS logs also support the deltaic environment of Datta {{in the study}} area, as mica-rich sandstones {{are known to have}} been found in deltaic environments. Petrographic analysis by previous researchers has also reported the presence of kaolinite in Datta sandstones (Zaidi et al. 2013) which is in agreement with the results presented in this work. During the early Jurassic, the western margin of the Indian Plate was influenced by fluvial–deltaic settings along the regions characterizing Salt and Tran-Indus Ranges, showing a marked transformation to marine facies in the Hazara and Kohat areas (Meissner et al. 1975; Fatmi 1977).|$|E

The carbonaceous beds dip north 60 degrees and 70 degrees, and run east and west; much quartz rock is intercalated with them, and soft white and pink <b>micaceous</b> <b>sandstones.</b> The coal-seams are few in number, six to twelve inches thick, very confused and distorted, and full of elliptic nodules, or spheroids of quartzy slate, covered with concentric scaly layers of coal: they overlie the sandstones mentioned above.

I may mention, however, that the appearance of inversion of the strata at the foot of great mountain-masses has been observed in the Alleghany chain, and I believe in the Alps.* [Dr. M'Lelland informs me that in the Curruckpore hills, south of the Ganges, the clay-slates are overlain by beds of mica-slate, gneiss, and granite, which pass into one another.] ...|$|R
40|$|A {{detailed}} stratigraphic and facies {{analysis has}} been carried out on the Guardia Pisano sedimentary succession (BARCA et alii, 1992; PITTAU et alii, 2002), the most complete Permian section cropping out in SW Sardinia. This succession has been subdivided into three lithostratigraphic units. The lower unit (approximately 14. 46 m) is formed by laminated, grey to blackish pelites and rare fine sandstones containing both acidic volcanic intercalations (lavas and pyroclastics) and epiclastites deriving from the erosion of volcanic products. Here, siltitic-clayey horizons containing a rich pollen assemblage suggesting an Asselian age (Lower Permian) has been found (PITTAU et alii, 2002). The depositional environment of this unit was a palustrine to alluvial plain (meandering stream) under probably humid climatic conditions, characterized by a certain degree of tectono-magmatic activity. The intermediate unit (approximately 59 m) is built up by reddish siltites and clayey siltites containing subordinate intercalations of <b>micaceous</b> <b>sandstones</b> and rare conglomerates: the high content of micas and K-feldspars of these sandstones is probably due to the erosion of former volcanites. This unit was laid down into a meandering stream environment under conditions of regular rainfall. The upper unit (approximately 45. 8 m) is constituted by rapid alternations of reddish pelites and sandstones with sheet-like and lens-shaped conglomeratic-sandstone intercalations, deposited into a meandering environment under more pronounced subarid conditions with irregular, catastrophic rainfall episodes: several crevasse splays have also been recognized here. These last two units are referable to the «New Red Sandstone» informal unit, showing a red beds facies, and having a sub-continental aspect in the frame of the Permian of Europe. The sedimentological features evidenced suggest a gradual evolution from (warm?) humid to subarid climates during the time of deposition of the succession. The volcanism, aged 297 ± 5 Ma (PITTAU et alii, 2002), pertinent to the lower unit, post-orogenic in type, has been linked to the first opening stages of this Permian basin. Thanks to its extremely good exposure, the succession described, especially the part pertaining to the «New Red Sandstone», has been analysed and subdivided into channelized and overbank elements, using the MIALL’s (1985, 1996) «Depositional Architecture» criteria, so obtaining a clearer understanding of the palaeoenvironments and their evolution...|$|R
