40|$|ABSTRACT The role of Si {{during the}} metal amp; 8722;organic {{vapor phase epitaxy}} of GaN rods is investigated. Already {{a small amount of}} Si {{strongly}} enhances the vertical growth of GaN. Reactive ion etching experiments show that the inner volume of the rod is much more strongly etched than the <b>m</b> <b>plane</b> surface layer. Transmission electron microscopy and energy dispersive X ray spectroscopy measurements reveal that Si is predominiantly incorporated in the surface layer of the <b>m</b> <b>plane</b> sidewall facets of the rods. The formation of a SiN layer prevents growth on and etching of the <b>m</b> <b>planes</b> and enhances the mobility of atoms promoting vertical growth. Annealing experiments demonstrate the extraordinary thermal resistivity in comparison to undoped GaN rod structures and GaN layers. The subsequent InGaN quantum well growth on the GaN rods reveals the antisurfactant effect of the SiN layer. A model based on the vapor amp; 8722;liquid amp; 8722;solid growth mode is proposed. The results help to understand the role of Si during growth of GaN rod structures to improve the performance of rod based light emitting and electronic device...|$|R

40|$|A finite element, large {{displacement}} {{formulation of}} static elastic-plastic analysis of slender arbitrarily curved planar beams is presented. Non-conservative and dynamic loads are sit present not included. The Bernoulli hypothesis of <b>plane</b> <b>cross-sections</b> is assumed {{and the effect}} of hear strains is neglected. Exact non-linear kinematic equations of curved beams, derived by Reissner are incorporated into;a generalized principle of virtual work through Lagrangian multipliers. The only function that has to be interpolated in the finite element implementation is the rotation of the centroid axis of a beam. This is an important advantage over other classical displacement approaches since the field consistency problem and related locking phenomena do not arise. Numerical examples, comprising elastic and elastic-plastic, curved and straight beams, at large displacements and rotations, show very nice computational and accuracy characteristics of the present family of finite elements. The comparisons with other published results very clearly show the superior performance of the present elements. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{an experimental}} investigation of clay brick columns that are externally strengthened by steel wire collars wrapping the horizontal mortar joints. The study aims {{to prove the}} effectiveness of the proposed strengthening technique and detect the efficiency of different numbers of steel collars. Additionally, the effect of eccentric loading is investigated. This paper proves that an analytical expression available in the previous literature can be modified to provide the strength of the equivalent homogeneous cross section in simple compression. To this aim, the biaxial strength domain of the bricks is modified to account for the lateral pressure exerted by the steel collars. Moreover, based on the <b>plane</b> <b>cross-section</b> assumption, moment-axial force domains are derived using mechanical parameters that are experimentally determined for the units, the steel collars, and the masonry under centered compression. Finally, the capacity of these domains to give accurate results in relation to the confinement effect produced by the proposed strengthening technique is discussed...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. We discuss an {{idea for}} how accreting {{millisecond}} pulsars could contribute {{to the understanding of}} the QCD phase transition in the high-density nuclear matter equation of state (EoS). It is based on two ingredients, the first one being a “phase diagram ” of rapidly rotating compact star configurations in the plane of spin frequency and mass, determined with state-of-the-art hybrid equations of state, allowing for a transition to color superconducting quark matter. The second is the study of spin-up and accretion evolution in this phase diagram. We show that the quark matter phase transition leads to a characteristic line in the Ω − <b>M</b> <b>plane,</b> the phase border between neutron stars and hybrid stars with a quark matter core. Along this line a change in the pulsar’s moment of inertia entails a waiting point phenomenon in the accreting millisecond X-ray pulsar (AMXP) evolution: most of these objects should therefore be found along the phase border in the Ω − <b>M</b> <b>plane,</b> which may be viewed as the AMXP analog of the main sequence in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram for normal stars. In order to prove the existence of a high-density phase transition in the cores of compact stars we need population statistics for AMXP’s with sufficiently accurate determination of their masses and spin frequencies...|$|R

With the IT, the one way velocity of light is isotropic only in a privileged reference frame, S 0. In this new theory only a weak form of relativity principle holds. We apply the IT to the collision of an energetic photon with an electron (Compton effect). A theoretical description of the dual quantum mechanical photon having both wave and particle properties is required. From the undulatory point of view we use the IT to deduce the e. m. wave equations in an inertial reference frame S moving with respect to S 0 with (absolute) velocity V �. Using the Maxwell equations in the form suitable to S, we show that the e. <b>m.</b> <b>plane</b> waves in S have the same properties as in S 0 : the fields are perpendicular to one another and perpendicular to the propagation direction of the field energy.
