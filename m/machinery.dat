5|$|DNA viruses : The genome {{replication}} of most DNA viruses {{takes place in}} the cell's nucleus. If the cell has the appropriate receptor on its surface, these viruses enter the cell sometimes by direct fusion with the cell membrane (e.g., herpesviruses) or – more usually – by receptor-mediated endocytosis. Most DNA viruses are entirely dependent on the host cell's DNA and RNA synthesising <b>machinery,</b> and RNA processing <b>machinery.</b> However, viruses with larger genomes may encode much of this <b>machinery</b> themselves. In eukaryotes the viral genome must cross the cell's nuclear membrane to access this <b>machinery,</b> while in bacteria it need only enter the cell.|$|E

25|$|Replication <b>machineries</b> {{consist of}} factors {{involved}} in DNA replication and appearing on template ssDNAs. Replication <b>machineries</b> include primosotors are replication enzymes; DNA polymerase, DNA helicases, DNA clamps and DNA topoisomerases, and replication proteins; e.g. single-stranded DNA binding proteins (SSB). In the replication <b>machineries</b> these components coordinate. In {{most of the}} bacteria, all of the factors involved in DNA replication are located on replication forks and the complexes stay on the forks during DNA replication. These replication <b>machineries</b> are called replisomes or DNA replicase systems. These terms are generic terms for proteins located on replication forks. In eukaryotic and some bacterial cells the replisomes are not formed.|$|R

5|$|In euryarchaea {{the cell}} {{division}} protein FtsZ, which forms a contracting {{ring around the}} cell, and {{the components of the}} septum that is constructed across the center of the cell, are similar to their bacterial equivalents. In cren- and thaumarchaea, however, the cell division <b>machinery</b> Cdv fulfills a similar role. This <b>machinery</b> is related to the eukaryotic ESCRT-III <b>machinery</b> which, while best known for its role in cell sorting, also has been seen to fulfill a role in separation between divided cell, suggesting an ancestral role in cell division.|$|E

40|$|Mitochondria and {{plastids}} {{have their}} own DNAs and are regarded as descendants of endosymbiotic prokaryotes. Organellar DNAs are not naked in vivo but are associated with basic proteins to form DNA-protein complexes (called organelle nuclei). The concept of organelle nuclei provides {{a new approach to}} explain the origin, division, and inheritance of organelles. Organelles divide using organelle division rings (<b>machineries)</b> after organelle-nuclear division. Organelle division <b>machineries</b> are a chimera of the FtsZ (filamentous temperature sensitive Z) ring of bacterial origin and the eukaryotic mechanochemical dynamin ring. Thus, organelle division <b>machineries</b> contain a key to solve the origin of organelles (eukaryotes). The maternal inheritance of organelles developed during sexual reproduction and it is also probably intimately related to the origin of organelles. The aims of this review are to describe the strategies used to reveal the dynamics of organelle division <b>machineries,</b> and the significance of the division <b>machineries</b> and maternal inheritance in the origin and evolution of eukaryotes...|$|R
40|$|Water {{drilling}} in Nigeria was initiated as most other technologies {{in the country}} by much of western technologies and <b>machineries.</b> As early as the 1960 s, huge drilling machines started to be imported into the country for water borehole construction. Together with these <b>machineries</b> came complex spare parts and high maintenance costs.

5|$|Homologous {{recombination}} {{requires the}} presence of an identical or nearly identical sequence {{to be used as a}} template for repair of the break. The enzymatic <b>machinery</b> responsible for this repair process is nearly identical to the <b>machinery</b> responsible for chromosomal crossover during meiosis. This pathway allows a damaged chromosome to be repaired using a sister chromatid (available in G2 after DNA replication) or a homologous chromosome as a template. DSBs caused by the replication <b>machinery</b> attempting to synthesize across a single-strand break or unrepaired lesion cause collapse of the replication fork and are typically repaired by recombination.|$|E
