25|$|The {{ideal self}} and real self involve {{understanding}} {{the issues that}} arise from having {{an idea of what}} you wish you were as a person, and having that not match with who you actually are as a person (incongruence). The ideal self is what a person believes should be done, as well as what their core values are. The real self is what is actually played out in life. Through humanistic therapy, an understanding of the present allows clients to add positive experiences to their real self-concept. The goal is to have the two concepts of self become congruent. Rogers believed that only when a therapist was able to be congruent, a real relationship occurs in therapy. It is much easier to trust someone who is willing to share feelings openly, even if it <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>what</b> the client always wants; this allows the therapist to foster a strong relationship.|$|E
500|$|Critics {{had mixed}} {{feelings}} about the game. Gerstmann said he had an [...] "outstanding time" [...] with it, {{and that it had}} offered an excellent twist to the genre. De Matos said it had successfully branched out the franchise to a new direction, even though it <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>what</b> players of the original Syndicate would expect. However, he said the spirit of the franchise is still maintained and preserved. Gaston said Starbreeze was not able to capture the franchise's vision and that the game was not well-executed overall. Whitehead described the game as [...] "fun", even though he thought Syndicate was a forgettable experience that will live under the shadow of rival shooters.|$|E
500|$|Kant's Grundlegung zur Metaphysik der Sitten (1785) expounded a moral {{system based}} on the {{categorical}} imperative, one formulation of which is: [...] "Act only according to that maxim through which you can {{at the same time}} will that it become a universal law." [...] Rational agents must act on [...] "principles of pure rational agency," [...] writes Moore; that is, principles that regulate all rational agents. But Williams distinguished between thinking and acting. To think rationally is to think in a way compatible with belief in the truth, and [...] "what is takes for one to believe the truth is the same as what it takes for anyone else to believe the truth," [...] writes Moore. But one can act rationally by satisfying one's own desires (internal reasons for action), and what it takes to do that <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>what</b> it takes for anyone else to satisfy theirs. Kant's approach to treating thinking and acting alike is wrong, according to Williams.|$|E

500|$|The Bookseller {{called the}} book [...] "the first {{comprehensive}} encyclopedia of its kind". In {{a review of}} the encyclopedia for The Guardian, Andrew Mueller called it a [...] "beautifully-produced tome" [...] and commented that the work [...] "succeeds, as was probably intentional, in offering some fascinating tours of the byways of history and providing a tantalising alternative universe in which much of what you know <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>what</b> it seems". John Cooper reviewed the encyclopedia for The Times, and described it as [...] "an entertaining compilation of ideas ranging from who was the 'real William Shakespeare' to the BCCI case and al-Qaeda". Cooper noted, [...] "The most fascinating section relates to 'Assassinations'... an unusual fairytale book for Christmas." [...] Martin Samuel gave a more critical review of the encyclopedia for The Times, commenting, [...] "For all the encyclopedia's pretence at sifting the evidence in search of a verdict, if the truth is out there, the authors are damned if they can find it." ...|$|E
2500|$|In this example, the {{variable}} [...] {{will have the}} value 42. Although this <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>what</b> the programmer anticipated, it is a well-defined result. If [...] were a different string, one {{that could not be}} converted to a number (e.g. [...] "Hello World"), the result would be well-defined as well. Note that a program can be type-safe or memory-safe and still crash on an invalid operation; in fact, if a program encounters an operation that is not type-safe, terminating the program is often the only option.|$|E
2500|$|Recent {{research}} by Simone Kühn and Marcel Brass suggests that our consciousness <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>what</b> causes some actions to be vetoed {{at the last}} moment. First of all, their experiment relies on the simple idea {{that we ought to}} know when we consciously cancel an action (i.e. we should have access to that information). Secondly, they suggest that access to this information means humans should find it easy to tell, just after completing an action, whether it was impulsive (there being no time to decide) and when there was time to deliberate (the participant decided to allow/not to veto the action). The study found evidence that subjects could not tell this important difference. This again leaves some conceptions of free will vulnerable to the introspection illusion. The researchers interpret their results to mean that the decision to [...] "veto" [...] an action is determined subconsciously, just as the initiation of the action may have been subconscious in the first place.|$|E

60|$|Of course, {{this is true}} only of {{the large}} {{majority}} of American editors. To say that it is true of all of them would be to cast too great obloquy upon the human race. Also, it would be untrue, for here and there an occasional editor does see clearly--and in his case, ruled by stomach-incentive, is usually afraid to say what he thinks about it. So far as the science and the sociology of the revolution are concerned, the average editor is a generation or so behind the facts. He is intellectually slothful, accepts no facts until they are accepted by the majority, and prides himself upon his conservatism. He is an instinctive optimist, prone to believe that what ought to be, is. The revolutionist gave this up long ago, and believes not that what ought to be, is, but what is, is, and that it <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>what</b> it ought to be at all.|$|E

6000|$|Well, David, {{to make it}} {{as short}} as I can, the man of the icy glance was clean-shaved at last, and the mother who bore him would not have known him as he looked in the glass when it was done. He chucked Poll a diamond worth about a million piastres, and, {{remarking}} that he would not trouble him for the change, he walked out. By this characteristic swagger, of course, he more than confirmed my belief that he was, indeed, the celebrated foreigner the Count of Monte Cristo; whose name and history even YOU must be acquainted with, though you <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>what</b> I have heard my friend Chevy Slime call himself, [...] "the most literary man alive."

60|$|Section 8. If {{we compare}} {{the nervous system}} of {{amphioxus}} with that of any vertebrate, we find at once a number of striking differences. In the first place, the skeletal covering of it, the cranium and the neural arches of vertebrae, are represented only by a greatly simplified connective tissue. In the next, a simple and slight anterior dilatation alone represents the brain. A patch of black pigment anterior to this (e.s.) may or <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>what</b> its name implies an eye-spot. There is a ciliated funnel, c.f. (Figure 1, Sheet 19), opening on the left side, which has been assumed to be olfactory in its functions, and in the mouth chamber a ciliated pit (c.p.), which may, or may not, be an organ of taste. The ventral fissure of the spinal cord is absent. The dorsal nerves are without ganglia, and do not come off in pairs, but alternately, one to the left, then one to the right, one to the left, one to the right, and so on. The ventral nerves are very short, more numerous than the dorsal, and never unite with these latter to form mixed nerves.|$|E
6000|$|He {{lives in}} simple {{obedience}} to school traditions. These may compel him, at one school, {{to speak in}} a peculiar language, and to persecute and beat all boys who are slow at learning this language. At another school he may regard dislike of the manly game of football as the sin with which [...] "heaven heads the count of crimes." [...] On the whole this notion seems a useful protest against the prematurely artistic beings who fill their studies with photographs of Greek fragments, vases, etchings by the newest etcher, bits of China, Oriental rugs, and very curious old brass candlesticks. The [...] "challenge cup" [...] soon passes away from the keeping of any house {{in a public school}} where Bunthorne is a popular and imitated character. But when we reach aesthetic boys, we pass out of the savage stage into hobbledehoyhood. The bigger boys at public schools are often terribly [...] "advanced," [...] and when they are not at work or play, they are vexing themselves with the riddle of the earth, evolution, agnosticism, {{and all that kind of}} thing. Latin verses <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>what</b> conservatives fondly deem them, and even cricket may, it is said, become too absorbing a pursuit, but either or both are better than precocious freethinking and sacrifice on the altar of the Beautiful.|$|E
50|$|The subtle {{connections}} of {{a deputy}} sheriff, a Nashville-bound singer, an ex-con, {{and a single}} mother will intertwine in this tale of small town life. Tommy Carson (Shawn Christian) works around the clock {{to keep the peace}} in Prospect, but Donny (John Hawkes), who is on a downward spiral, makes this even more difficult for the deputy Sheriff. Rhett Ryan (Chris Pine) discovers that the desire to follow his dream conflicts with his desire to be with the woman he loves. While Samantha (Bre Blair) does love the singer-songwriter, she comes to realize that what's best for her daughter (Kali Majors) and their future <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>what's</b> best for him. Les (Adam Hendershott) just wants to fit in with his big brother's friends, but his overbearing mother (Lin Shaye) desperately wants him to stand out.|$|R
