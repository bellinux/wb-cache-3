5|$|John Cage and <b>Marcel</b> <b>Duchamp</b> were {{significant}} influences on Ono's art. She learned of Cage at Sarah Lawrence and met {{him through his}} student Ichiyanagi Toshi in Cage's legendary experimental composition class at the New School for Social Research: She was thus introduced to more of Cage's unconventional neo-Dadaism first hand and his New York City protégés Allan Kaprow, Brecht, Mac Low, Al Hansen and the poet Dick Higgins.|$|E
5|$|Southard {{frequently}} {{traveled from}} Boston to New York City {{to participate in}} Walter Arensberg's salons, bringing scholarship to discussions of contemporary social-science topics. Arensberg was also friends with artists such as <b>Marcel</b> <b>Duchamp.</b> Southard analyzed the dreams of Arensberg's guests, and discussed the meaning of Duchamp's work with the artist. Perhaps influenced by Arensberg and his friends, Southard began to write experimental poetry. He {{was a member of}} the Wicht Club, a social and intellectual group of young Harvard academics.|$|E

5|$|After Cage {{finished}} {{teaching at}} the New School {{in the summer of}} 1960, Ono was determined to rent a place to present her works along with the work of other avant-garde artists in the city. She eventually found a cheap loft in downtown Manhattan at 112 Chambers Street that she used as a studio and living space. Supporting herself through secretarial work and lessons in the traditional Japanese arts at the Japan Society, Ono allowed composer La Monte Young to organize concerts in the loft. Both began organizing a series of events there from December 1960 through June 1961, with people such as <b>Marcel</b> <b>Duchamp</b> and Peggy Guggenheim attending, and both Ono and Young claimed to have been the primary curator of these events, with Ono claiming to have been eventually pushed into a subsidiary role by Young. The Chambers Street series hosted some of Ono's earliest conceptual artwork, including Painting to Be Stepped On, which was a scrap of canvas on the floor that became a completed artwork upon the accrual of footprints. With that work, Ono suggested that a work of art no longer needed to be mounted on a wall and inaccessible. She showed this work and other instructional work again at Macunias's AG Gallery in July 1961.|$|E
