40|$|In {{this thesis}} {{we present a}} new and {{accurate}} series of computation methods for compressible <b>multi-phase</b> <b>flows</b> with capillary effects based upon the full seven-equation Baer-Nunziato model. For that reason, there are some numerical methods to obtain high accuracy solutions, which will be shown here. First, a high resolution shock capturing Total Variation Diminishing (TVD) finite volume scheme is used on both Cartesian and unstructured triangular grids. Regarding the TVD finite volume scheme on the unstructured grid, time-accurate local time stepping (LTS) is applied to compute the solutions of the governing PDE system, in which the results are also compared with time-accurate global time stepping. Second, we propose a novel high order accurate numerical method for {{the solution of the}} seven equation Baer-Nunziato model based on ADER discontinuous Galerkin (DG) finite element schemes combined with a posteriori subcell finite volume limiting and adaptive mesh refinement (AMR). In <b>multi-phase</b> <b>flows,</b> the difficulty is to design accurate numerical methods for resolving the phase interface, as well as the simulation of the phenomena occurring at the interface, such as surface tension effects, heat transfer and friction. This is because of the interactions of the fluids at the phase interface and its complex geometry. So the accurate simulation of compressible <b>multi-phase</b> <b>flows</b> with surface tension effects is currently {{still one of the most}} challenging problems in computational fluid dynamics (CFD). In this work, we present a novel path-conservative finite volume discretization of the continuum surface force method (CSF) of Brackbill et al. to account for the surface tension effect due to curvature of the phase interface. This is achieved in the context of a diffuse interface approach, based on the seven equation Baer-Nunziato model of compressible <b>multi-phase</b> <b>flows.</b> Such diffuse interface methods for compressible <b>multi-phase</b> <b>flows</b> including capillary effects have first been proposed by Perigaud and Saurel. Regarding the high order accuracy of a diffuse interface approach, the interface is captured and allowed to travel across one single possibly refined cell, and is computed in the context of multi-dimensional high accurate space/time DG schemes with AMR and a posteriori sub-cell stabilization. The surface tension terms of the CSF approach are considered as a part of the non-conservative hyperbolic system. We propose to integrate the CSF source term as a non-conservative product and not simply as a source term, following the ideas on path conservative finite volume schemes put forward by Castro and Parés. For the validation of the current numerical methods, we compare our numerical results with those published previously in the literature...|$|R

40|$|In {{the past}} few decades, EIT systems have been {{successfully}} applied to many different industries, such as petroleum, chemical and energy. The performance of existing EIT-based <b>multi-phase</b> <b>flow</b> metering is, however, still challenging, due to incapability of current EIT systems for providing both qualitative spatial and temporal resolution at the same time. On the other hand, one important characateristics of multi-phase upward pipeline flow is that the flow regimes can be assumed in radial symmetrical over the cross-section of the pipe under investigation, which means the central area of a tomogram can be utilised to approximate the whole tomogram when calculating <b>multi-phase</b> <b>flow</b> characteristics, e. g. concentration and velocity.

Experiments were conducted in terms of visualising static objects in a phantom and metering gas-water 2 -phase upward vertical flow. The results demostrated that the proposed approach generates comparable tomograms to the ones obtained by conventional 16 -electrode EIT system, and offers a great temporal resolution, which is suitable for velocity extraction using conventional cross-correlation method, which further improves the performance of EIT-based <b>multi-phase</b> <b>flow</b> metering...|$|E
40|$|An {{improved}} Volume of Fluid (VOF) {{method is}} presented which is applicable to high density ratio 3 D flows {{for a large}} range of bubble Reynolds number (Re). The method {{is based on the}} Navier-Stokes equations for incompressible <b>multi-phase</b> <b>flows</b> which are discretized on a Cartesian staggered grid. The multi-grid technique together with the pressure-velocity coupling scheme for <b>multi-phase</b> <b>flows</b> have resulted in an efficient solver which nearly exponentially converge with the number of iterations. The convergence speed also shows negligible dependence on density ratio, viscosity ratio and Re. A second-order accurate, non-diffusive, mass conservative phase transport model is presented which does not suffer from unphysical over- or under-shoots of the phase variable. The high accurate normal, curvature and surface tension force model in combination with the high-order defect-correction scheme for <b>multi-phase</b> <b>flows</b> shows second-order global accuracy when applied to the transient bubble rise where the viscosity ratio is equal to one. In contrast, the commonly used viscosity model for VOF introduces a first order error for the same problem. The VOF method has been tested for different types of bubble flows at low Re and for path-oscillating and wobbling air bubbles (in water) with a diameter range of 1. 82 < D < 6 mm. The numerical results agree quantitatively with the available experimental data. The investigations show that the proposed high accurate surface tension model can be used successfully for wobbling flows with bubble deformation while maintaining the mass of the phases. The error in mass conservation is directly proportional to the residual in solving the discrete problem. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|R

Subsequently, we expand each variable in power series of this parameter and apply singular perturbation techniques to derive the low-Mach-number equations.
