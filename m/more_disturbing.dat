5|$|In 2008 the {{newspaper}} The Guardian named Myrrha's {{relationship with her}} father as depicted in Metamorphoses by Ovid {{as one of the}} top ten stories of incestuous love ever. It complimented the myth for being <b>more</b> <b>disturbing</b> than any of the other incestuous relationships depicted in the Metamorphoses.|$|E
5|$|Haunting Ground {{was first}} {{revealed}} in September 2004, {{and was released}} next April garnering mixed to average reviews. The graphics and presentation were praised, but critics found the gameplay somewhat repetitive, predictable, and derivative of previous horror titles. The sexual objectification of Fiona was highlighted by some critics {{as one of the}} game's best elements. They found that by illustrating her as an object of desire, the game makes Fiona and therefore the player feel more fragile and endangered, building a <b>more</b> <b>disturbing</b> atmosphere. The fluctuating degree of player control over Fiona has made Haunting Ground a key subject in the study of avatars and their relationship with players in video games.|$|E
5|$|Lynch's {{original}} {{rough cut}} ran for approximately four hours. He was contractually obligated {{to deliver a}} two-hour movie by De Laurentiis and cut many small subplots and character scenes. He also made cuts {{at the request of}} the MPAA. For example, when Frank slaps Dorothy after the first rape scene, the audience was supposed to see Frank actually hitting her. Instead, the film cuts away to Jeffrey in the closet, wincing at what he has just seen. This cut was made to satisfy the MPAA's concerns about violence. Lynch thought that the change only made the scene <b>more</b> <b>disturbing.</b> In 2011, Lynch announced that footage from the deleted scenes, long thought lost, had been discovered. The material was subsequently included on the Blu-ray disc release of the film. The final cut of the film runs at just over two hours.|$|E

5|$|<b>More</b> <b>disturbing</b> to Lord Howe {{were the}} actions of HMS Russell and HMS Caesar. Russell's captain John Willett Payne was criticised at the time for failing to get {{to grips with the}} enemy more closely and {{allowing}} her opponent Téméraire to badly damage her rigging in the early stages, although later commentators blamed damage received on 29 May for her poor start to the action. There were no such excuses, however, for Captain Anthony Molloy of Caesar, who totally failed in his duty to engage the enemy. Molloy completely ignored Howe's signal and continued ahead as if the British battleline was following him rather than engaging the French fleet directly. Caesar did participate in a desultory exchange of fire with the leading French ship Trajan but her fire had little effect, while Trajan inflicted much damage to Caesar's rigging and was subsequently able to attack Bellerophon as well, roaming unchecked through the melee developing {{at the head of the}} line.|$|E

She is usually slightly crazy but is exictable and bubbly, but as the character goes on she turns into a bit of a pyromaniac and takes on a slightly <b>more</b> <b>disturbing</b> persona.|$|E

Ever since we first raised this issue some years ago there still has not been an adequate repudiation of incitement by the Palestinian Authority. It is even <b>more</b> <b>disturbing</b> that the problem appears to have gotten worse. These textbooks don't give Palestinian children an education, they give them an indoctrination.|$|E
25|$|In January 2017, The A.V. Club posted an {{analysis}} of the scene where Zev meets the character John Kurlander. The review noted some surface-level similarities between Norris' work as John and his role as Hank Schrader on Breaking Bad, but its main focus was on how events in 2016 and growing vocalization of white supremacists served to make the scene much <b>more</b> <b>disturbing</b> and realistic than it felt when the film premiered in 2015.|$|E

25|$|The Kemeny Commission {{noted that}} Babcock & Wilcox's {{pilot-operated}} relief valve had previously failed on 11occasions, {{nine of them}} in the open position, allowing coolant to escape. <b>More</b> <b>disturbing,</b> however, {{was the fact that the}} initial causal sequence of events at TMI had been duplicated 18months earlier at another Babcock & Wilcox reactor, the Davis-Besse Nuclear Power Station owned at that time by Toledo Edison. The only difference was that the operators at Davis-Besse identified the valve failure after 20minutes, where at TMI it took 80 minutes, and the Davis-Besse facility was operating at 9% power, against TMI's 97%. Although Babcock engineers recognized the problem, the company failed to clearly notify its customers of the valve issue.|$|E
25|$|Latour, {{moving along}} muddy forest trails amid snow and sleet squalls, fell badly behind schedule. At 10:00am, his column was still {{well to the}} rear of Kollowrat's corps. By this time, the gunfire from Kienmayer's and Kollowrat's combats could be clearly heard to the front. Even <b>more</b> <b>disturbing</b> were sounds of battle from the south. Latour made the {{extraordinary}} decision to divide the divisions of Feldmarschall-Leutnants Prince Friedrich of Hessen-Homburg and Friedrich Hohenlohe-Ingelfingen into small task forces. He sent one infantry battalion and six cavalry squadrons to the north to look for Kienmayer. One battalion and four squadrons marched south to find Kollowrat. After advancing the bulk of his column to the village of Mittbach, Latour sent two battalions and two squadrons to assist Schwarzenberg's attack and three battalions and an artillery battery to help Kollowrat. This left him with only three battalions and six squadrons.|$|E

500|$|Because {{children}} with tics often present to physicians when their tics are most severe, {{and because of}} the waxing and waning nature of tics, it is recommended that medication not be started immediately or changed often. Frequently, the tics subside with explanation, reassurance, understanding of the condition and a supportive environment. When medication is used, the goal is not to eliminate symptoms: [...] it should be used at the lowest possible dose that manages symptoms without adverse effects, given that these may be <b>more</b> <b>disturbing</b> than the symptoms for which they were prescribed.|$|E
500|$|According to Drew Grant of The New York Observer, Claire's season-long storyline {{was similar}} to the real life efforts of United States Senator Kirsten Gillibrand's to legislate an end to {{military}} sexual assault. Based upon the 4-episode preview, Alessandra Stanley of The New York Times says that in season 2 Claire [...] "is still ruthlessly pursuing her own agenda as well as her husband’s. She remains an enigma even as she reveals more and <b>more</b> <b>disturbing</b> secrets from her past." [...] Claire remains composed and stylish with or without her husband and plays the press with aplomb.|$|E
500|$|Tibbitt {{said that}} the [...] "biggest surprise" [...] {{for him in the}} new title {{sequence}} was [...] "the treatment of Painty the Pirate in the beginning" [...] as seen in a fortune teller machine. Mark Caballero, one of its animators, explained [...] "our idea was like our goal is like the <b>more</b> <b>disturbing,</b> the better because I don't think there is a fortune telling machine out there that doesn't disturb when you see it. Tibbitt said [...] "it was a great idea I was just expecting maybe a 3D version of the painting but we got something totally different and it's very cool." ...|$|E

Highlighting perceived hypocrisy from Western progressive and environmental movements, the author confronts what he sees as unfair and excessive criticism of oil sands, stating that the [...] "oil sands are not perfect, and criticizing them is fair game. But why has criticism of the oil sands been so disproportionately loud compared to criticism of other, larger, <b>more</b> <b>disturbing</b> sources of oil?".|$|E
500|$|Development {{lasted about}} {{one year and}} was {{primarily}} done with Amiga 4000 computers to create the FMVs. It {{would be the first}} major release for the still-unknown Eno and WARP, and so Eno felt that if it were not successful he would quit from game development. He added scenes of violence and cannibalism to make the game more striking, however he believed the content would be too extreme for censors or publishers and feared the game would not be permitted for publishing. To ensure these scenes would not be censored, Eno submitted a [...] "clean" [...] version for publisher approval late, knowing they would require him to hand deliver the game to the manufacturer. On his way to the manufacturer, he switched the clean version with his master version containing the <b>more</b> <b>disturbing</b> content.|$|E
500|$|From 1927 to 1928, violent scenes removed {{were those}} in which a gun was pointed at the camera or [...] "at or {{into the body of}} another character". Many shots where machine guns were featured, scenes where criminals shot at law {{enforcement}} officers, some scenes involving stabbing or knife brandishing (audiences considered stabbings <b>more</b> <b>disturbing</b> than shootings), most whippings, several involving choking, torture, or electrocution, and any scenes which could be considered educational in their depiction of crime methods. Sadistic violence and reaction shots showing the faces of individuals {{on the receiving end of}} violence were considered especially sensitive areas. The Code later recommended against scenes showing robbery, theft, safe-cracking, arson, [...] "the use of firearms", [...] "dynamiting of trains, machines, and buildings", and [...] "brutal killings", on the basis that they would be rejected by local censors.|$|E

40|$|Plasma {{magnesium}} {{levels were}} tested {{in a group of}} 155 psychiatric in-patients with a variety of diagnoses and were correlated with the severity of their symptoms. We hypothesized that lower Mg levels would correlate with a higher degree of anxiety, tiredness and other symptoms characteristic of Mg deficiency. No such correlations were observed. However, Mg levels varied widely, with 22. 4 % below, and 10. 4 % above the normal range. There was a strong association for <b>more</b> <b>disturbed</b> and excitable patients to have abnormal (either high or low) levels. We speculate that <b>more</b> <b>disturbed</b> patients might have some abnormality of Mg metabolism with possible therapeutic implications...|$|R
