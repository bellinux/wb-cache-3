30|$|For the {{cytotoxicity}} of DNA tetra as drug carrier, medium containing DNA tetra structures at {{the concentration}} of 0 – 100  μM was added for another 24 - or 48 -h incubation. Then, 100  μL of MTT solution (5  mg/mL) was added to each well, and the mixture was incubated at 37  °C for 4  h. The liquid was then removed, and the cells were lysed and dissolved with 200  μL DMSO. The absorbance of supernatant was measured at 570  nm by <b>Microreader.</b> The non-treated HT- 29 sample was deemed as control group.|$|E
30|$|Cytotoxicity was {{estimated}} using MTT assay. Firstly, cells were seeded in 96 -well plates and cultured overnight to reach 80  % abundance. Then, the medium were removed {{and replaced with}} 100  μL fresh culture medium. Fresh media containing AS 1411, DTNs, or DTNs-AS 1411 at indicated concentrations were incubated with cells for 24  h. 20  μL 5  mg/mL MTT reagent solution was then added to each well, followed by 4  h incubation at 37  °C. Next, cells were lysed with 10  % acid SDS solution (pH[*]=[*] 2 – 3). After centrifugation, the absorbance of supernatant was measured at 570  nm by <b>Microreader</b> (Shimadzu Co, Ltd, Japan).|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to study the in vitro effect of β-hydroxy-β-methylbutyrate (HMB) on the proliferative {{response}} of sheatfish (Silurus glanis) and catfish (Ictalurus melas) lymphocytes stimulated by mitogens at temperatures of 20 °C and 30 °C. The pronephros lymphocytes were isolated from 20 sheatfish and 20 catfish, respectively. Mitogens, ConA at concentration of 64 µg/ml or LPS at concentration of 160 µg/ml were used for stimulation of lymphocytes. The plates were incubated for 72 h at 20 °C and 30 °C without CO 2. The MTT method {{was used for the}} study of proliferative responses of lymphocytes stimulated by mitogens. The plates were read on a <b>microreader,</b> using the test wavelength of 620 nm. Net optical density (OD) values were obtained by subtracting the mean OD of negative control cells (not stimulated by mitogens) from that of stimulated cells. The results showed that the HMB at concentrations 10, 50 and 100 µg HMB/ml of medium significantly (p < 0. 05) increased T-lymphocyte proliferation stimulated by ConA and B-lymphocyte proliferation stimulated by LPS, respectively, at 20 °C and 30 °C, compared to control. The highest proliferative response of T-cells at 30 °C was observed at concentrations 50 and 100 µg HMB/ml in both species. The results showed that HMB stimulated the lymphocyte activity and suggested a possible application of HMB for modulation of cell-mediated immunit...|$|E

40|$|Fine {{chemicals}} and pharmaceuticals are {{high value added}} products that are produced in modest quantities. They are usually seasonal products that are customer specific and have a short shelf life. These characteristics usually placed a significant constraint in their production, such {{that it is not}} uncommon to see labour intensive batch processes being used instead of the more efficient continues process. This usually led to a significant waste generation during the scale-up from the laboratory to production scale. In addition, the use of hazardous and often toxic homogeneous catalysts makes the product purification and waste disposal an important issue in today's stringent environmental regulations. Microchemical systems offer a new paradigm for meeting these challenges. Recent advances in the design and fabrication of micromixers, microseparators and microreactors bring closer the realization of desktop miniature factories and micropharmacies. They represent a cheap alternative way for the production of specialty {{chemicals and}} pharmaceuticals by a continuas process, allowing simpler process optimization, rapid design implementation, better safety and easier scale-up through replication. This enables rapid product deployment to the marketplace and thus ensuring a significant competitive edge. New basic zeolite catalysts obtained by grafting amino groups onto NaX and CsNaX zeolites exhibit excellent catalytic activities for Knoevenagel condensation reaction between benzaldehyde and ethyl cyanoacetate (ECA), ethyl acetoacetate (EAA) and diethyl malonate (DEM). The CsNaX-NH 2 catalyst displays higher conversion compared to aminopropylated MCM- 41 for benzaldehyde reaction with ECA and DEM (Figure. 1). The performance of a membrane <b>microreader</b> was tested and compared with that of microreactor, packed bed reactor (PBR) and packed bed membrane reactor (PBMR) for the Knoevenagel condensation reaction of benzaldehyde and ethyl cyanoacetate to produce ethyl- 2 -cyano- 3 -phenylacrylate. Cs-exchanged NaX faujasite zeolite was used as the base catalyst for this equilibrium-limited reaction. Hydrophilic zeolite membranes were employed in both membrane microreactor and PBMR for the selective removal of water byproduct from the reaction. The product yield per pass was low for the packed bed reactor. Higher yields were observed for the microreactor and PBMR, but the best performance belongs to the membrane microreactor, which displayed both supra-equilibrium conversion and better product purity (Figure 2). Analysis indicated that all water produced by the condensation reaction was completely removed and the membrane was operating below its capacity. This means that the performance of the membrane microreactor is limited mainly by the kinetics, now that both thermodynamic and mass transfer constraints were removed. A nearly fourfold increase in reaction conversion was obtained for the microreactor when CsNaX-NH 2 catalyst was used instead of CsNaX...|$|E
